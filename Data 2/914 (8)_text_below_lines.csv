37,1," In a Supplemental Memorandum filed with the court on June 28, 2002, the plaintiff argues that the opinion of counsel letters 
produced by the defendants state that the Trex products may infringe upon the plaintiff's patent and therefore, the defendants' 
contention that the underlying patent infringement case is baseless is unreasonable. See Dkt. 44. However, the court does not 
agree. The opinion of counsel letter also states that certain claims of the '831 patent may be invalid based on prior public use 
and the Zagelmayer patent. This portion of the letter gives the defendants a reasonable basis to argue that the plaintiff's patent 
is invalid and that the infringement suit is groundless. "
46,1, Terms of the ORIGINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT were as follows:
46,1," . Bresea agreed to pay $ 9 Million CDN to Deloitte, in its capacity as Trustee of the Estate of Bre-X Minerals, Ltd., that 
after the payment of certain expenses, including attorneys' fees, would be available for distribution to Bre-X shareholders in 
the U.S. and Canada. "
47,2," . Bresea would create a pool consisting of shares equal to ten percent of the common equity of reorganized Bresea for the 
benefit of Bresea shareholders in the U.S. and Canada."
47,3," . Bresea would pool any recoveries obtained from certain insider defendants in this action, the Ontario Class Actions, and 
the Trustee's Actions, and Deloitte would distribute those recoveries to Bre-X shareholders. "
48,2," Though not specifically deciding the point at which the certification determination is made, it is clear that other courts have 
taken a similar approach to certification. See Shaw v. Toshiba Am. Info. Sys., 91 F. Supp. 2d 942 (E.D. Tex., 2000) (court 
engaged in extensive Rule 23 analysis after preliminary certification and fairness hearing.) See also In re Engineering Animation 
Securities Litigation, 203 F.R.D. 417 (S.D. Iowa, 2001) (court in shareholder class action addressed in detail the requirements of 
Rule 23 in an order issued after the fairness hearing was held.) Additionally, the purpose of the preliminary approval is to detect 
any obvious defects that will preclude final approval of the settlement, and the purpose of initial certification is so that notice may 
be sent to the proposed class. See Manual for Complex Litigation, Third, pg. 236-237."
48,3," The Court undertook a similar analysis in its January 2002 order as the Court determined that the over-broad nature of the 
proposed settlement class was fatal to any possibility that a settlement class could be finally approved. The Court was required 
to consider the appropriateness of the pre-complaint class members and the post- Freeport MacMoran announcement members 
at the preliminary approval stage because, as was the case in Ortiz, the Court had no other opportunity to address those specific 
issues. "
58,1, The complaint does not specify the nature of this allegation. 
60,2," The dissent argues that we should also consider a third purpose, judicial economy. Dissenting Opinion, infra, at [3]. However, 
the Supreme Court has consistently held that there are only two purposes to consider in determining whether to apply the 
primary jurisdiction doctrine - uniformity and expertise. See  W. Pac. R.R. Co., 352 U.S. at 64. Despite ample opportunity during 
the ninety-five years since it created the doctrine, see supra at [4-7], the Supreme Court has never identified judicial economy as 
a relevant factor. No doubt the reason is that considerations of judicial economy cannot assist a primary jurisdiction analysis, as 
it will always be more economical, from a judge's point of view, to dismiss a case or quickly refer it to an administrative agency, 
instead of adjudicating it himself. We are enjoined to resist this temptation because of ""the virtually unflagging obligation of the 
federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction given them."" Cob. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817, 
47 L. Ed. 2d 483, 96 S. Ct. 1236 (1976) (citations omitted). "
62,3," The dissent argues that reliance on agency expertise favors dismissal. Dissenting Opinion, infra, at [1-3]. The dissent relies on 
the fact that, because Tassy has brought a discrimination claim, the District Court will have to compare Brunswick's treatment of 
him to its treatment of similarly situated physicians of other races and national origins, a comparison that would be better made 
by the PHC. This argument, we suggest, suffers from two flaws. First, there is no reason to believe that the PHC would even be 
able to conduct the comparative analysis to which the dissent alludes. While New York Public Health Law § 2801-b(2) authorizes 
the PHC to determine whether Brunswick properly suspended Tassy's privileges under New York Public Health Law § 2801-b(1) 
(i.e., whether Brunswick suspended Tassy's privileges on the basis of his character), we are not aware of any statute or 
regulation that authorizes the PHC to determine whether Brunswick properly suspended Tassy's privileges under 42 U.S.C. § 
1981 (i.e., whether Brunswick denied Tassy ""the same right. . . to make and enforce contracts. . . as is enjoyed by white 
citizens""). Second, even if the PHC were able - and willing - to conduct this analysis, it still would not implicate the PHC's 
medical expertise. As the dissent points out, Tassy's § 1981 claim is based on his allegation that Brunswick has taken measures 
against him ""which have not been taken against white doctors accused of much more serious indiscretions and much more 
significant misconduct."" Dissenting Opinion, infra, at [1-2]. For the reasons discussed in the text supra, an examination of 
""indiscretions"" and ""misconduct"" directed at a co-worker does not implicate the PHC's medical expertise, regardless of who is 
alleged to have committed the indiscretions and misconduct. "
63,4," The dissent's suggestion that the courts should ""welcome the opportunity for… pre-litigation dispute resolution in a case such 
as this,"" Dissenting Opinion, infra, at [4], we believe, misconceives the nature of the primary jurisdiction doctrine. While courts 
may often prefer that the parties engage in pre-litigation dispute resolution, we cannot require them to do so absent a sound 
legal basis. However ""distasteful"" or ""counter-productive"" a lawsuit may be, id., we cannot dismiss it pursuant to the doctrine of 
primary jurisdiction, and require the parties to litigate before an administrative agency, unless doing so would promote 
consistency and uniformity or unless the agency has some relevant expertise. As for the dissent's statement that parties often 
prefer an opportunity for pre-litigation dispute resolution before an administrative agency, id., nothing in our opinion precludes 
parties who choose to take advantage of such administrative procedures from doing so. Rather, we simply hold that, HN15[
] 
where a party prefers not to litigate before an administrative agency in the first instance, he cannot be forced to do so pursuant 
to the primary jurisdiction doctrine unless the purposes behind the existence of the doctrine are present. "
65,1," In making this point, I do not mean to suggest, as the majority states, Maj. Op., supra, at [11 n.3], that the PHC will analyze 
Tassy's § 1981 claim. Rather, my point is that the agency's investigation of whether Tassy' s privileges were wrongfully 
suspended, which the PHC is authorized under New York law to perform, would produce factual determinations that would aid 
this court's analysis of Tassy's § 1981 claim in the ways described above. Given the inevitable overlap of Tassy's wrongful 
suspension and § 1981 claims, the PHC would consider many of the same factual, if not legal, issues as this court would. Nor is 
there any requirement that the same claims must be brought before both this court and the PHC. See  Johnson v. Nyack Hosp., 
964 F.2d 116 (2d Cir. 1992)(affirming dismissal of plaintiff-physician's antitrust claims for plaintiff-physician's failure to file a 
complaint with the PHC first). "

84,1," The Honorable Michael J. Melloy, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa. Judge Melloy has since been 
appointed United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit and currently serves in that capacity. "
85,2," ACT did not oppose Sylvan's motion for summary judgment on Count III, and that judgment is not before us on appeal. "
86,3," ACT also contends that Sylvan did not move for summary judgment on the basis of Sylvan's lack of knowledge of the MOU and 
the Interim Agreement. But Sylvan did note the existence of the MOU and the Interim Agreement in its memorandum in support 
of its motion for summary judgment. It is true that Sylvan focused primarily on the Proposed Letter Agreement, but then so did 
ACT's complaint. We conclude that ACT was sufficiently on notice that it should defend the summary judgment motion on all five 
elements of tortious interference with contract and address the knowledge question as to all the purported agreements on which 
it was basing its claim. In any event, this Court has indicated that HN4[
] we may affirm a summary judgment on any ground 
supported by the record. Ozark Heartland Elecs., Inc. v. Radio Shack, 278 F.3d 759, 763 (8th Cir. 2002)."
86,4," It is arguable that ACT brought the wrong cause of action on the MOU and the Interim Agreement. Both of these agreements 
were non-exclusive, short-term agreements, intended to be temporary. Neither involved the transfer of the CBT centers from 
NASD to ACT -- unlike Sylvan's ultimate agreements with NASD, the transactions which allegedly interfered with ACT's 
purported contracts with NASD. It is true that NASD, after failing to reach a long-term agreement with ACT, compensated ACT 
and agreed to other terms and conditions to resolve differences that arose upon termination of the MOU and the Interim 
Agreement. But it appears that ACT's recovery of expenses was contemplated by the terms of the agreements because the 
agreements were terminable at will. Under Iowa law, ""contracts terminable at will are more properly protected as a prospective 
business advantage rather than as a contract. Consequently the higher standard of proof requiring substantial evidence that the 
defendant's predominant or sole motive was to damage the plaintiff was required."" Compiano v. Hawkeye Bank & Trust of Des 
Moines, 588 N.W.2d 462, 464 (Iowa 1999) (citation omitted); see also infra pt. III (discussing Iowa cause of action for tortious 
interference with prospective business advantage). We also note, as to the damages element of ACT's cause of action, that the 
record does not reflect that ACT sought to prove and recover damages based on the termination of these short-term 
agreements. With the decision we reach today, however, it is unnecessary for us to address either of these issues. "
91,5," The court initially denied Sylvan's renewed motion for summary judgment, noting that ACT had sought not only damages but 
also injunctive relief and that ACT might be entitled to the equitable relief. The court certified its order granting Sylvan's motion in 
limine for interlocutory appeal; this Court denied leave to file such an appeal. ACT then dismissed its claim for injunctive relief so 
that the court would resolve the summary judgment question. "
106,1," Named Plaintiff ROG-GLO, Ltd. was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice because it no longer met the criteria to be a class 
representative. See Order, June 20, 2001. "
107,2," Unless otherwise noted, the facts are taken from those presented in Defendants' Joint Statement of Undisputed Material Facts 
(""Facts"") and admitted by Plaintiffs."
107,3," Premium brand cigarettes are sometimes called ""full revenue"" or ""FR"" brands, while discount cigarettes are referred to as 
""value for money"" or ""VFM"" brands. "
108,4," On March 6, 1997, RJR announced a list price increase of $ 2.00 per thousand (4 [cents] per pack). Shortly thereafter, Lorillard, 
Liggett, and B&W matched that increase. On March 20, 1997, Philip Morris announced a price increase of $ 2.50 per thousand 
(5 [cents] per pack). The other manufacturers then met Philip Morris' higher increase. Id., P 26 n.4. "
109,5," In their Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs asserted that the testimony of Lawrence Meyer, an outside counsel for Liggett, 
in litigation in the state of Washington would show that Defendants implemented the conspiracy through the Committee of 
Counsel. See Second Amended Complaint, P 78c, at 34-35. Plaintiffs also contended that Mr. Meyer testified that the timing and 
level of price increases was discussed at Committee of Counsel meetings. Id., P 79, at 41. Plaintiffs do not discuss Mr. Meyer's Washington state deposition testimony in their response to Defendants' motions for 
summary judgment, and, thus, its present relevance to this litigation is unclear. Plaintiffs, however, do cite this testimony in 
response to one of Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. Id., P 37 and Resp., P 37. There, Plaintiffs argue that 
Mr. Meyer testified he attended a Committee of Counsel meeting where there was a discussion of whether there had been a 
price increase and of how to respond to wholesalers who engaged in ""trade loading."" Regardless of what Mr. Meyer testified to 
in the Washington state litigation, such testimony could not support Plaintiffs' claims here because Mr. Meyer testified in this 
litigation that he stopped attending Committee of Counsel meetings in 1983, prior to the alleged initiation of the conspiracy at 
issue in this litigation. See Meyer Depo., at 79. The discussions about allocations Mr. Meyer recalled in his Washington state 
deposition occurred in the late 1970s. Id. at 112. Mr. Meyer also testified that there were never any discussions of setting prices 
at the Committee of Counsel meetings. Id. at 68-70. Nor was there a discussion among representatives of the cigarette 
companies to agree to impose allocations on wholesalers. Id. at 82."
109,6," The court is very mindful that this case is before it on motions for summary judgment and that it may not supplant a jury's 
function if it finds a dispute of material fact in the admissible evidence. Although there is much discussion herein of the evidence, 
the court has been careful to limit its evaluation of the evidence to whether allowable inferences are or are not created under the 
various standards. "
110,7," HN2[
] There is no dispute that the cigarette industry in the United States is an oligopoly. See Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227-30, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993); Expert Report (Plaintiffs') of Dr. 
Franklin Fisher (""Fisher Report""), P 137."
110,8," Plaintiffs' proposition of the law would encompass the activities of even lawfully operating oligopolies. Plaintiffs cite American 
Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 809-10, 90 L. Ed. 1575, 66 S. Ct. 1125 (1946), to support this proposition, but 
American Tobacco speaks far more narrowly. There, the Court held that ""no formal agreement is necessary"" because a 
conspiracy could be shown by demonstrating ""a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds 
in an unlawful arrangement."" Id. Even under this statement of the law, Plaintiffs still must show some kind of agreement. "
112,9," Cf. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992): "
113,," The Court's requirement in Matsushita that the plaintiffs' claims make economic sense did not introduce a special burden 
on plaintiffs facing summary judgment in antitrust cases. The Court did not hold that if the moving party enunciates any 
economic theory supporting its behavior, regardless of its accuracy in reflecting the actual market, it is entitled to summary 
judgment. Matsushita demands only that the nonmoving party's inferences be reasonable in order to reach the jury, a 
requirement that was not invented, but merely articulated, in that decision. HN17[
] If the plaintiff's theory is economically 
senseless, no reasonable jury could find in its favor, and summary judgment should be granted. Id. at 468-69 (footnote omitted)."
113,10," HN22[
] It is, of course, the court's responsibility to determine the admissibility of evidence. See Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) (""Preliminary questions concerning . . . the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court . . . .). In making this 
determination, the existence of certain conditions must be found by the judge. See id., advisory committee's note. Whether an 
inference is allowable is really a question of whether it is admissible under Rule 401. To determine its admissibility, the court 
may have to act as a fact finder. See Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) advisory committee's note (""To the extent that these inquiries [about 
the existence of conditions] are factual, the judge acts as a trier of fact. Often, however, rulings on evidence call for an 
evaluation in terms of a legally set standard. . . . These decisions, too, are made by the judge.""). As a fact finder, the court must 
determine, for example, whether an inference is a product of legitimate methodology or whether the evidence tends to make the 
existence of a fact that is of consequence more or less probable. See Fed. R. Evid. 401. "
115,11," Plaintiffs assert that in addition to the actual prices operating in parallel, Defendants also acted in parallel with respect to other 
terms of sale. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that ""credit memos"" issued by Defendants at the same time as price increases were 
announced delayed the price increase ""by allowing purchasers to continue to buy product at the old price for a period of weeks "
116,," after the announcement."" Pls.' Resp., at 26. Plaintiffs contend that the credit memos allowed each company to ""offer"" a price 
increase to the industry which rivals could accept or reject within the time allowed by the credit memo. The only testimony Plaintiffs cite for their contention that credit memos delayed price increases fails to support this assertion. 
Plaintiffs assert that Carl Schoenbachler, former Chief Financial Officer of B&W, testified that the credit memos delayed the 
impact of the price increase for a week or more. See Pls.' Resp., at 26. As B&W responds, however, see B&W Reply, at 7 n.8, a 
more complete reading of Mr. Schoenbachler's testimony shows that Plaintiffs' meaning cannot be attributed to his testimony. Q: So, would I be correct, then, that one of the reasons for sending out the Telex price increase sooner rather than later is 
to let the trade know that there is some period of time until the effective date, and during that -- during which they have the 
opportunity to purchase at the old price? . . . A: No, that's not what I said. The practice -- more recent practice has been, when a Telex is sent out, the Telex states that 
the price increase is effective immediately. All goods ordered on Monday morning will carry the new price; you will be given 
a credit on a notional quantity that you purchased over the past six months on average, the average week's shipments over 
the past six months. So, there's no opportunity for the trade to order at the old price over some period of time. Schoenbachler Depo., at 146. Furthermore, Defendants' price announcements took effect immediately, within one to two days of 
the announcement date. See PM Price Announcements, PM Reply Brief, Ex. 9; RJR Price Announcements; RJR Reply Brief, 
Ex. 36, at 58001 2713; Lorillard Price Announcements, Lorillard Reply Brief, Ex. 3. "
117,12," In their Post-Hearing Submission in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, Plaintiffs dramatically point to 
a ""recently"" produced document to show Defendants ""clearly understood the antitrust concerns raised by many of the practices 
that plaintiffs have identified as 'plus factors.'"" Id. at 12. A review of the document shows it to be a summary of antitrust law and 
the application of that law to the Tobacco Industry Testing Laboratory. The court finds this document has no relevance to the 
present litigation. "
118,13," See PMAT 000072883-2888, Board Notes, Wednesday, October 28, 1992. This document however, explains a decision by 
Philip Morris not to enter the 99 cent category of cigarettes because ""we felt this would have sent a conflicting message to our 
competition and damaged our chances of narrowing the price gap."" Id. at 2884."
118,14," See PMAT 000205367 (""False reporting of a competitive strategy of retail rebates by sales people: This could very well be the 
case. This happens in other industries such as the pharmaceutical industry. One president and CEO stated, 'When the sales 
department controls everything, the danger is that you become price driven because sales organizations look to sell things. A 
marketing office balances that tendency since he's responsible for profitability.' One way to resolve this problem is have sales 
report to an EVP of Marketing and Sales. Another suggestion is for Larry Wexler and/or Bill Campbell to increase the number 
and frequency of interviews with the trade press, local press (RH, Cabarrus), and security analysts, in order to send clear signals 
throughout the industry.""). "
119,15," Plaintiffs' own expert seems to recognize the purpose of this kind of statement. Dr. Fisher testified that he believed there are 
""perfectly good reasons why [companies] would want to tell analysts, we are going to be profitable from now on."" Fisher Depo., 
at 179. Dr. Fisher opines, however, Mr. Broughton's statements ""seem to have gone somewhat beyond that."" Id. He later 
testifies, however, that it would be preferable, meaning more ""legitimate,"" for BAT to say something more akin to ""we are sorry 
there's a price war"" because ""nobody likes price wars."" Id. at 180. The court finds it is splitting hairs to conclude that Mr. 
Broughton's comments, read in their entirety evidence an agreement when Dr. Fisher agreed it was not surprising that Mr. 
Broughton would express displeasure at being caught in a price war. Plaintiffs describe B&W's response to Marlboro Friday as an ""olive branch."" Pls.' Resp., at 40. Plaintiffs point to a document 
written on May 25, 1993, by an unnamed BAT employee asking, ""Should we signal to PM that we are prepared to go up?"" 
BAT303501037-042, at 039. It is claimed that this document refers to Philip Morris' new pricing strategy. A review of that 
document and Plaintiffs' brief, however, provides no context for that statement. The document is handwritten with no indication 
who authored it. As such, the document does not constitute admissible evidence. Furthermore, on the same page as the quote 
cited by Plaintiffs are possible actions BAT considers taking in France and Germany. Thus, it is likely the document does not 
even discuss pricing in the United States. Moreover, there is no indication that any public statement was made related to this 
internal memo. For all of these reasons, the document does not reflect the import ascribed to it by Plaintiffs in their ""olive branch"" 
theory. "
120,16," Furthermore, the Brooke Group Court indicated that measures such as what Philip Morris did on Marlboro Friday should not 
be punished under antitrust law even if ""the ultimate effect of the cut is to induce or reestablish supracompetitive pricing."" 
Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 223-24 (emphasis added). The court also observes that the strategy of mutually assured destruction 
was directed at ""caressing"" the former Soviet Union into a peaceful posture but by no means would one infer that it and the 
United States were conspiring together."
120,17," With regard to the ""two conditions,"" Mr. Black testified that, This is my opinion -- this is my opinion that, as an analyst, if a price increase were going to stick, this is how it would have 
to be structured. This is my opinion, you know, looking at industry pricing structure in the past in other price wars, that these 
are the conditions that, in my opinion, as an analyst, would have to be in order to become bullish on the group. If I saw a different type of price increase, I wouldn't become bullish because I would conclude that it wasn't going to stick. 
This is not something that would have come from the industry. This is my own opinion. Black Depo., at 140-41 (emphasis added)."
120,18," Plaintiffs cite document PM2023769230-232 for the proposition that ""PM, too, appreciated from the clear implication of 
Harper's statements that RJR was willing to accept PM's conditions for a price hike."" Pls.' Resp., at 44. A review of that 
document, however, shows it is a copy of a Gary Black industry report with some portions of the report underlined. It does not 
identify the ""PM executive"" Plaintiffs allege read these ""signals"" into RJR's statement, and thus, Plaintiffs' assumptions are 
based on mere speculation. "
121,19," Significantly, far from being the final link in the conspiracy, the internal memo reflects Philip Morris' uncertainty about the 
market's reaction. Philip Morris determined several possible risks from its strategy: (1) a competitor would exceed Philip Morris' 
increase by $ 0.50 to $ 1.00, (2) a competitor would announce a price increase in advance of Philip Morris', (3) competitors could 
fail to raise prices in the low end of the market, and (4) in the long term, competitors could initiate a mid-year price increase. Id. 
at 2045121129."
121,20," Plaintiffs contend that the amount of RJR's announced price increase in November 1993 must have been agreed upon in 
advance because RJR's $ 2.00 increase matched the $ 2.00 suggested in Philip Morris' internal recommendation of November 
3, 1993. As RJR notes, however, $ 2.00 price increases were common in the industry. See RJR Reply Brief, Ex. 38, Black 
Memo, October 21, 1993, at 4 (""most price increases have been . . . $ 2.00-$ 2.50 per thousand""). "
122,21," Mr. Black repeatedly rejected Plaintiffs' ""signaling"" theory: Q: There is no dispute that from time to time [the companies] did talk about pricing and they did it quite openly, didn't they? MR. O'REILLY: Objection to the form. Vague. A: They would talk about pricing in the context of their cost structure, so that if costs were going up, whether it be 
promotional costs, litigation costs, there was obviously discussion about their economics. Q: And everybody understood what that meant, right, sir? MR. O'REILLY: Object to the form. A: I don't know what you mean. Q: Well, you understood it, didn't you? You understood, when their costs were going up and they were signaling their costs 
were going up, that meant they were talking about a price increase, right? A: No. Black Depo., at 132."
122,22," Mr. Black repeatedly rejected Plaintiffs' counsel's insinuation that he was privy to inside information: Q: My question to you, sir, is what was the source of your information that RJR would likely lead the price increase and 
Philip Morris would follow? . . . A: The source was my understanding of how industries work, that when you have a player like RJR that you could argue 
caused the price war because it was gaining so much share in discount, Philip Morris cut price, RJR was now hurting 
because it had debt commitments that it had to make. I felt that RJR was desperate to try to pull the industry out of the price "
123,," war. That's why I thought RJR would be the one that would lead it, but that was based on my own analysis as an outsider 
looking at the industry. Q: Isn't it true that you had additional information beyond just your own analysis, that being RJR had announced publicly its 
interest in raising its profits? . . . A: No. That's not correct. Q: You are sure? A: I think I'm sure. RJR, during analyst meetings, would say, We would love to get our earnings up because we can't -- we 
are going to have a hard time making our debt payments if this price war gets any worse. So, yes, RJR did say things like 
that, and RJR clearly wanted to get its earnings up, but RJR never said, Well, we are going to raise prices and Philip Morris 
is going to follow; that never happened. Black Depo., at 138-39."
123,23," In response to Plaintiffs' counsel's question as to whether he received information from the industry, Mr. Black testified: ""Not 
from the industry. It would come from the trade, from backing into what number -- what level of pricing do you need to hit the 
profit targets that investors expected from Philip Morris."" Black Depo., at 219-20. Despite Plaintiffs' counsel's exhortations, Mr. 
Black continued to testify that he did not receive price increase information from the industry. Q: Well, nobody could tell you what the price hike would be other than the industry, correct? A: That's incorrect. I could back into it myself what they needed to hit their profit targets. Id. at 220. "
124,24," EOQ allows wholesalers to purchase between 110% and 130% of its previous four week order average. See Baker Aff., P 14. 
Under EOQ, the field sales staff determined whether larger orders would be permitted. See Inventory Management Program, "
125,," October 14, 1993, 6334260060 (instructing field representatives to call on account and do inventory check to see if account 
needs additional product or to determine if account has gained business or needs product due to special promotions); id. at 69 
(during times of national promotion, quantities were automatically increased in the system). "
127,25," The court further notes that this document is labeled as ""Exhibit A,"" but it stands alone in Plaintiffs' compilation of exhibits. 
Thus, Plaintiffs have provided no context or purpose for the generation of this document. "
129,26," As with several other contentions, this one is without appreciable evidentiary support. "
130,27," Plaintiffs' citation to Liggett's description of Philip Morris' Wholesale Master's Program is not contradictory. Liggett indicates 
that the electronic reports include ""detailed retail store information for all manufacturers' products including SKU level detail, on-
hand warehouse inventories and all promotional deals."" LIGG009154. It says nothing about price. Furthermore, this document, 
far from showing a conspiratorial purpose behind the reporting requirements, indicates Liggett's belief that Philip Morris was 
using its market share and the incentives provided to participants in the Wholesale Master's Program to force wholesalers to 
stock more Philip Morris inventory than that of competitors. See id. "
131,28," Moreover, pricing information seems irrelevant to Plaintiffs' more fully articulated theory that Defendants did not use 
MSA/Pittsburgh to obtain pricing, but rather to monitor the conspiracy and to detect ""cheaters."" See Fisher Report, P 110; Fisher 
Depo., at 160 (""continual monitoring of market share data is one way to ensure that cheaters will be detected""). "
133,29," The court also notes that Plaintiffs offer no support for their contention that each modification to the service provided by 
MSA/Pittsburgh was made with the ""joint agreement of all Defendants."" Pls.' Resp., at 54. Rather, the documents cited by 
Plaintiffs show that MSA/Pittsburgh discussed various proposals with each company individually and made modifications to their 
services based on their, MSA/Pittsburgh's, views about what would be the most acceptable to their customers. There is no 
evidence in the documents cited by Plaintiffs that any of the Defendants negotiated together or reached any agreement together 
about what services they would request from MSA/Pittsburgh."
133,30," The court has addressed above Plaintiffs' arguments concerning the permanent allocation program and the sending of data to 
MSA/Pittsburgh. "
134,31," Dr. Fisher did not disagree with this strategic decision. See Fisher Depo., at 68 (testifying that he thought there were 
""legitimate business reasons"" for matching price decreases immediately following Marlboro Friday). "
136,32," The parties also dispute the manner in which wholesalers price cigarettes. Defendants contend that wholesalers raise prices 
on all manufacturers' brands as soon as one manufacturer raises its prices. As such, Defendants argue, they must follow price 
increases because to do otherwise would ""leave money on the table"" for wholesalers. Plaintiffs contend that wholesalers are 
able to price separately all brands of cigarettes, so Defendants would be able to distinguish their prices from competitors. The court need not decide this issue because Plaintiffs have presented no evidence from which a jury could reasonably infer that 
""follow the leader"" pricing was against the economic interest of Defendants or reflective of an agreement to fix prices. The court 
notes, however, that while there is some limited evidence to the contrary, it appears the vast majority of wholesalers act as 
Defendants contend. See, e.g., Supplement No. 4 to Plaintiffs' Response and Objections to Defendants' Interrogatories; Gutlove 
Depo., at 224-25; Nelson Depo., at 79-80; and Wertheim Depo., at 93, 152. "
137,33," Plaintiffs have provided no expert testimony, for example, showing that increased discount sales would have offset the lower 
profit margins, to support their contention that RJR would have been economically better off after Marlboro Friday by pursuing 
the discount market."
137,34," The court understands that where price fixing is alleged, an injury to competition is presumed. It would seem, however, that 
the presumption is somewhat suspect in this case. The demand for cigarettes is fairly inelastic. Further, there is sufficient "
138,," product differentiation so that wholesalers do not have an opportunity to substitute Winstons for Marlboro if Winstons are 
cheaper than Marlboro, so it is difficult to see what the injury to competition is at the wholesale level. There is cross-elasticity of 
demand between brands at the retail level. As such, B&W's decision to discount its VFM brands at the retail level is pro-
competitive and it evidences an intent to maintain its commitment to discount brands. It is by no means an ""unreasonable"" 
business decision, and it is inconsistent with an agreement to fix prices to please Philip Morris."
138,35," Plaintiffs' expert contends that the ""pricing event is difficult to understand outside the context of explicit coordination through 
direct communications between companies."" Fisher Report, at P 78. See also id., at P 82 (""it is difficult to understand R. J. 
Reynolds' decision to lead a price increase unless some explicit communication took place, giving R. J. Reynolds the assurance 
that Philip Morris would follow its price increase.""). As demonstrated below, a full reading of the contemporaneous documents 
shows that, indeed, RJR was concerned about whether other companies would follow its increase, thus, contradicting Dr. 
Fisher's theory. These statements, furthermore, offer no support for a contention that the May 1995 price increases were against 
the economic self-interest of Philip Morris or RJR. "
139,36," The internal review conducted by Philip Morris, and cited by Plaintiffs, is not to the contrary. In that report, Philip Morris 
speculates that RJR might benefit more from the settlement agreements in 1997, but that Philip Morris would have the 
advantage over its competitors in 1998. See PMAT000211925. "
141,37," In re Medical X-Ray Film, 946 F. Supp. 209, cited by Plaintiffs, is not to the contrary. There, the court found HN41[
] that ""the 
presence or absence of a strong motive to enter into the alleged conspiracy"" could be a ""plus factor"" under the circumstances. 
Id. at 218."
141,38," As discussed, Marlboro Friday forced these companies to reexamine the wisdom of that strategy."
141,39," The court addressed above Plaintiffs' allegation that if RJR had continued to push for a market share in the discount segment, 
it could have been the overall new market leader by 1997. "
142,40," As they do on numerous occasions, Plaintiffs attempt to divide the competitive act of Marlboro Friday from its logical 
consequences. Plaintiffs argue that ""part of PM's strategy after Marlboro Friday was to reduce the number of price points and to 
reduce the price gap."" Pls.' Resp., at 47 (emphasis added). The reduction of price points and the price gap was not a policy that 
arose independently after Marlboro Friday; it was one of the goals of Marlboro Friday. See Fisher Depo., at 31. Plaintiffs again 
contend that ""after Marlboro Friday, PM was intent on destroying the deep discount segment, to the detriment of its competitors 
and consumers generally."" Pls.' Resp., at 47. This contention, however, does not support Plaintiffs' theory of a conspiracy. If the 
destruction of the deep discount segment was harmful to Philip Morris' competitors, it could hardly be one of the practices which 
facilitated the operation of the alleged cartel."
142,41," For the same reasons, the court finds inapposite In re Plywood Antitrust Litigation, 655 F.2d 627 (5th Cir. Unit A 1981). There, 
the plaintiffs offered evidence of a series of meetings between plywood producers that the producers themselves described as 
""an opportunity to secure specific competitive information."" Id. at 633. Specific pricing information was exchanged.  Id. at 633-43. 
The court held that the parallel pricing conduct plus ""the numerous items of direct evidence of communication between high-level 
personnel on pricing policy adequately supported the jury's verdict."" Id. at 634 (emphasis added). Here, Plaintiffs have not 
shown that pricing policies were the subjects of any of the meetings among Defendants."
142,42," Although Plaintiffs contend that statements of Mr. Geoffrey Bible, CEO of Philip Morris, illustrate the companies' desire to 
""pass through"" settlements costs in the form of pricing, the specific comments Plaintiffs point to were made during failed 
settlement negotiations in 1997 which anticipated government involvement and an antitrust immunity provision for Defendants. 
Furthermore, as the court described above, Mr. Bible's comments were not related to price, but were made in the context of 
discussing the costs of the settlement agreement allocated based on market share, not pricing. "
143,43," The slim reed upon which Plaintiffs base this assumption is the deposition testimony of William Campbell, former President 
and CEO of Philip Morris, whom Plaintiffs quote as saying the Tobacco Institute ""needed to increase even more the continuing 
cooperation by the members."" Campbell Depo., at 287-88. As Defendants demonstrate, however, a full reading of Mr. 
Campbell's testimony indicates he was not referring to cooperation on issues of price. Rather Mr. Campbell testified that ""most of 
these discussions were the type that, you know, how the organization could be strengthened in its industry efforts against things 
like the Federal Excise Tax and indoor air and so on."" Id. at 288. In fact, Mr. Campbell testified that prices were never discussed 
at Tobacco Institute meetings. Id. at 296-97."
143,44," As described above, although Plaintiffs claim they ""were never given complete access to Committee of Counsel records to 
determine the existence of additional direct evidence of collusion,"" Pls.' Resp., at 56 n.30, the court finds otherwise. "
145,45," In fact, Defendants did respond to discovery requests made by Plaintiffs on the smoking and health issues. Plaintiffs deposed 
two witnesses from RJR. Although the depositions of witnesses from Philip Morris and B&W were noticed by Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs 
cancelled those depositions. See Philip Morris Reply Brief, at 26 n.25. "
146,46," Plaintiffs also contend that Dr. Fisher addresses the significance of these activities in his reports, finding that ""multi-market 
contact facilitates a conspiracy in the United States because it decreases the likelihood that competitors will, for example, violate 
the agreement in the United States for fear of endangering anticompetitive agreements in other countries."" Pls.' Resp., at 58. 
The court, however, has determined that Plaintiffs' allegations of foreign market conspiracies are not probative of collusion as a 
matter of law. The testimony of Plaintiffs' expert does not alter that conclusion. See Blomkest, 203 F.3d at 1038 (finding expert's 
opinion was ""not probative of collusion"" and holding that HN44[
] under Federal Rule of Evidence 703, there must be ""sufficient facts already in evidence or disclosed by the witness as a result of his or her investigation to take such expert testimony out of 
the realm of guesswork and speculation"")."
146,47," Plaintiffs cite two B&W documents to support their description of an eight-part conspiracy. Neither document describes any 
such agreement. See B&W462219869-999 (B&W Five Year Plan 1992-1997); B&W970394991-4996 (unidentified handwritten 
notes)."
146,48," For the first time, in their Post-Hearing Submission in Opposition to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, Plaintiffs 
give the court some indication of their speculation as to how such an agreement might have operated. Plaintiffs assert ""although 
presumably there was no agreement at the outset that specific companies (like B&W) would reduce their shares of the market in 
specific amounts, the necessary consequence of the agreement was that some would lose and others would gain share."" Id. at 
10. ""B&W did not necessarily agree in advance to the reduction [in market share] it experienced; however when faced with its 
pre-conspiracy losses, it acquiesced to a loss (one that would not be inconsistent with its prior loss trend) in exchange for larger 
per-pack profits resulting from the conspiracy."" Id. at 10 n.20. This new theory, however, is clearly inconsistent with Plaintiffs' 
speculation at oral argument where they alleged that B&W agreed to the conspiracy so that it would not be driven out of the "
147,," marketplace by Philip Morris' actions on Marlboro Friday. See Oral Argument, at 88. Moreover, this argument is inconsistent with 
the facts. B&W's market share was not trending down in the years leading up to the conspiracy and thus B&W had no ""pre-
conspiracy losses"" to contend with or give it reason to join a conspiracy. See Annual Shares of U.S. Tobacco Shipments by 
Manufacturer, 1980-2000, Plaintiffs' Exhibits Presented at Oral Argument, at 15. "
148,49," HN46[
] The ""slight evidence"" rule, however, is not favored in the Eleventh Circuit. See United States v. Toler, 144 F.3d"
148,1423," , 1427 (11th Cir. 1998) (explaining that ""slight evidence"" rule was ""banished"" from circuit jurisprudence). Furthermore, it is 
not clear that the ""slight evidence"" rule would apply in a civil conspiracy case on summary judgment. See In re Citric Acid, 996 F. 
Supp. 951, 955 (N.D. Cal. 1998) (holding ""slight evidence"" rule may apply in criminal matters but cannot in civil cases because 
its standard would conflict with standard for summary judgment), aff'd, In re Citric Acid, 191 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 1999). "
151,50," Plaintiffs cite American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 147 F.2d 93, 114 (6th Cir. 1944), for this proposition, but the procedural 
posture of that case was reviewing the guilty verdict rendered by the jury, and thus, the court viewed all possible inferences in 
favor of the jury's verdict. Id. at 101. "
153,51," When asked at his deposition whether he could ""identify any prior price fixing case in which [he has] not given a definitive 
opinion one way or another as to the presence of actual collusion or an explicit agreement,"" Dr. Fisher could only name one 
other case. Fisher Depo., at 410-11."
153,52," The assertions of Dr. Fisher's opinion alone are not sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. See In re Citric 
Acid, 191 F.3d at 1105 n.9 (rejecting plaintiff's claim that the reports of its expert economist ""mandate the denial of [defendant's] 
summary judgment motion"" and finding that the court considered the evidence discussed by the expert and determined that ""no 
piece of evidence tends to exclude the possibility that [defendant] acted independently and is not affected by the conclusory 
statements in the expert report to the contrary"") (citing Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 242). "
156,53," A ""buydown"" is a ""discount in the form of an allowance offered to a retailer. The allowance is conditioned on the retailer 
dropping the non-promoted price of cigarettes by at least the amount of the buydown."" Elzinga Report, at 6."
156,54," Plaintiffs offer no support for their assertion that ""the issue of whether the existence and level of retail competition impacts the 
determination of liability for price-fixing at the wholesale level is one for the finder of fact."" Pls.' Resp., at 84. Rather, Defendants 
are permitted to rebut Plaintiffs' contentions with evidence of their own. See Todorov, 921 F.2d at 1456 n.30. Nor does the court find relevant Plaintiffs' citation to a document purporting to discuss strategy between Philip Morris 
International and BAT in Chile. As the court described above, Plaintiffs have not established the necessary predicate for the 
court to consider this document, even under Rule 404(b)."
156,55," The court has addressed above the issue of whether wholesalers will tend to increase the price of all manufacturers' brands 
when one announces a price increase. "
157,56, The market share figures include those for most of the brands of the American Tobacco Co. acquired by B&W in 1994. 
170,1," Defendants reserved the right to raise the issue of whether they induced a breach for the sole purpose of harming plaintiff, but 
do not argue it here. "
175,2," Holdings alleges it was owed the same rights pursuant to the contractual relationship and to the Producer Agreement. 
Compare Compl. P 181 (pursuant to contractual relationship, ""CCR investigated claims, tried cases, and negotiated settlements 
on a bulk basis on behalf of all of its members"") with Compl. P 188 (pursuant to Producer Agreement, ""CCR investigated claims, 
tried cases, and negotiated settlements on a bulk basis on behalf of all of its members""). In addition, the allegedly interfering 
behavior is the same. Compare Compl. P 182 (""defendants caused CCR to expel GAF"") with Compl. P 190 (""defendants 
intentionally caused CCR to expel GAF in breach of the Producer Agreement""). Finally, the damages are also the same. 
Compare Compl. PP 183-85 (damages include denial of CCR benefits, inability to settle cases and special damages of more 
than $ 20 million as the result of ""establishing and funding a free-standing network of defense counsel and litigating asbestos 
bodily injury cases on its own"") with Compl. PP 191-93 (same). "
176,3," It is true that in D'Andrea, the court recognized that there was a material issue of fact as to the validity of the employment 
contract. However, it did not take its recognition of that fact into consideration when determining whether the tortious interference 
with prospective economic advantage claim should withstand summary judgment. Presumably, if it had done so, the result might 
have been different. In addition, D'Andrea involved a motion for summary judgment, and the narrowing down of claims in that 
manner is more appropriate at the summary judgment stage, after parties have had the opportunity for necessary discovery. "
177,4," The Defendants did not cite any authority to suggest the contrary. Several cases have found, however, that a reasonable 
inference may not be drawn in certain circumstances not applicable here. For instance, in Samuels v. Old Kent Bank, 1997 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 11485, 1997 WL 458434, at *14-*15 (N.D. Ill., Aug. 1, 1997), the court applied Holman and determined that a 
reasonable inference could not be drawn that the plaintiff had pleaded breach of contract and unjust enrichment in the 
alternative. Unjust enrichment may only be pleaded under the applicable state law, Illinois, in the absence of a valid contract. Id. 
The Complaint no where stated that the contract might not be valid, and the unjust enrichment count explicitly incorporated 
paragraphs alleging the existence of a valid contract. Id. Holdings' complaint does not face the same internal inconsistencies as 
it alleges that there was a contractual relationship in addition to the existence of a valid contract."
177,5," The Defendants maintain their challenge to both Counts II and III on the basis that their supposed interference was not 
intended solely to harm GAF. Defendants do not reargue this point here, however, as they already did so unsuccessfully in their 
first motion to dismiss."
177,6," Because the claim is only advanced against the Baron & Budd defendants (the law firm and the individuals), all references to 
""Defendants"" in this section are to the Baron & Budd defendants only. "
179,7," The ""fixing"" allegations are distinguishable from the Baron & Budd Memorandum cases because of the time in which Holdings 
has had the requisite information. Holdings has known for years about the Baron & Budd memorandum, yet continues to plead 
unspecific allegations against Baron & Budd. By contrast, Holdings has only recently obtained the information regarding the 
alleged ""fixing"" and already has provided a more specific set of charges."
179,8," Holdings learned of the specific instances of falsification on January 16, 2002, when a witness being interviewed under the 
auspices of Special Master Fitzpatrick provided the information. Nine days later, Holdings employed those allegations in its 
Second Amended Complaint. "
180,9," HN10[
] With respect to this element, ""there are two general varieties"": the ""defendant may have taken affirmative steps to 
prevent the discovery of the plaintiff's injury, or the nature of the wrong itself may have been self-concealing."" Butala, 916 F. 
Supp. at 319. "
182,10," Holdings suggests that the Second Circuit found closed-ended continuity based on a pattern of predicate acts occurring over a 
period of one year in Azrielli v. Cohen Law Offices, 21 F.3d 512, 520-21 (2d Cir. 1994). However, the Second Circuit in GICC 
cited Azirelli as a case in which open-ended continuity had been found. 67 F.3d at 466. "
185,11," E.g. Wiwa v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3293, 2002 WL 319887, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2002) 
(""Although some authority weighs against recognizing an 'enterprise' that is comprised of a corporation and its agents or 
subsidiaries, recent Supreme Court case law suggests that the 'distinctiveness' requirement imposed by Section 1962(c) is not 
as rigid as prior circuit precedent suggests.""); see also Chen v. Mayflower Transit, Inc., 159 F. Supp. 2d 1112, 1114-15 (N.D.Ill. 
2001) (citing Cedric Kushner for the proposition that the formal legal distinction created by incorporation is sufficient for the RICO 
statute and holding plaintiff pleaded RICO enterprise comprising common carrier corporation and its local agents). "
186,12," Defendants first cite to G-I Holdings, 179 F. Supp. 2d at 262, which did not even discuss the specific allegations of ""fixed"" 
affidavits as those allegations were not part of the FAC. Further, the cited section addresses the requirements of Rule 9(b). 
Defendants cite only one other case for this proposition in their Reply Memorandum, but the portion cited similarly involves a 
discussion of Rule 9(b). Associated Wrecking, Inc. v. Local 95 Pension Fund, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3952, 1994 WL 118987, at 
*5 (S.D.N.Y. March 31, 1994) (dismissing RICO mail and wire fraud claims for, inter alia, failure to allege specific times and 
places that documents were sent). In their Memorandum, Defendants also quoted Grumman Allied Indus. v. Rohr Indus., 748 
F.2d 729, 737-38 (2d Cir. 1984), which deals generally with reliance and not with the fact specific situation here. Id. (""Where 
sophisticated businessmen engaged in major transactions enjoy access to critical information but fail to take advantage of that 
access, New York courts are particularly disinclined to entertain claims of justifiable reliance."""
186,13," The Defendants appear to concede this argument in their reply memorandum and focus instead on the reliance argument. 
Defs.' Reply Mem. at 25 (""Proximate Cause Cannot Substitute for the Reliance Requirements""). Because they did not expressly 
do so, it nevertheless will be discussed. "
188,14," Former Paragraph 138 stated in pertinent part: ""The consideration for the Futures Agreements included CCR's agreement to 
settle some 50,000 pending asbestos cases for approximately $ 750 million."" "
189,15," Such defense would be fruitless. Holdings fails to allege even a time frame for these ""other occasions"" much less the other 
more specific information that Holdings also fails to allege with regard to the alleged May incident. "
190,16," For instance, it was sufficient at this stage of the proceedings for Holdings in Count XII to identify a group of cases that likely 
contained the falsified affidavits."
190,17," Section 306-b provides: HN26[
] Service of the summons and complaint … shall be made within one hundred twenty days after their filing … . If 
the service is not made upon a defendant within the time provided in this section, the court, upon motion, shall dismiss the 
action without prejudice as to that defendant, or upon good cause shown or in the interest of justice, extend the time for 
service."
190,18," If the purportedly backdated amended complaint was not served within 120 days of the purported stamp, Holdings could not 
reasonably have relied on it as such complaint would be subject to summary dismissal pursuant to § 306-b."
190,19," Holdings does not directly state that it was a named defendant; rather it states that ""the named defendants"" relied on the false 
date, Compl. P 315, and that Holdings ""incurred expenses in defending"" the complaint. Id. at P 316. "
191,20," Counsel stated that Holdings may wish to amend the complaint if the Special Master's investigation yields more information. If 
particularly specific facts leading to meritorious claims are uncovered, Holdings may move to replead. Holdings may not replead 
as of right except as to Count XIII, and any such pleadings without seeking leave of court will be summarily dismissed. "

Plaintiffs do not dispute this, nor do they dispute that the agreement with Verisign for the cosmos.com domain name now 
mandates a WIPO arbitration proceeding."
204,9," The complaint was assigned to a sole arbitrator, an attorney from the United Kingdom, the location of defendant's principal 
place of business. "
205,10," HN1[
] Worth noting here is that the result reached in the WIPO proceeding is neither admissible, nor entitled to any 
deference, with respect to the merits issues presented in this suit. Review here must be de novo and independent of any WIPO 
panel conclusion. See International Bancorp v. Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers a Monaco, 192 F. Supp. 2d 
467, 475 n.16 (E.D. Va. 2002) (citing Parisi v. Netlearning, Inc., 139 F. Supp. 2d 745, 752 (E.D. Va. 2001))."
205,11," The tortious interference and abuse of process claims were dismissed because (i) plaintiffs were unable to establish the 
necessary elements of their claims; (ii) the Noerr-Pennington doctrine confers immunity to defendant's seeking WIPO redress to 
protect its mark; and (iii) plaintiffs' prior agreement to submit to a WIPO proceeding precluded their claims. See  Eurotech, 189 F. 
Supp. 2d at 390-94."
205,12," The motions were resolved as follows (i) plaintiffs' motion to strike expert report and bar expert testimony of defendant's 
expert, Michael Rappeport, was denied; (ii) plaintiffs' motion to strike defendant's reply brief in support of defendant's motion for 
summary judgment was denied; (iii) defendant's motion to withdraw its claims for a monetary award was granted; (iv) plaintiffs' 
claim for unlawful conversion was dismissed; and (v) defendant's motion to strike jury demand was granted. See Eurotech, Inc. 
v. Cosmos European Travels Aktiengesellschaft, Civil Action No. 01-1689-A (E.D. Va. July 12, 2002) (order)."
205,13," The parties reiterated during oral argument on July 12, 2002 that the case should be adjudicated on the existing summary 
judgment record. "
206,14," These five criteria establish a claim by a registered mark holder for trademark infringement and unfair competition pursuant to 
Sections 1114 and 1125(a). See  Doughney, 263 F.3d at 364."
206,15," Although plaintiffs no longer provide travel information at the website found at the cosmos.com domain name, see supra note 
6, such a move does not absolve plaintiffs from any liability they may have incurred. To begin with, cosmos.com still provides 
travel related information in the form of the prominent link to cosmotravels.com, which along with related websites, contains 
travel information. Further, it is well-established that HN4[
] ""a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does 
not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice."" City of Mesquite v. Aladdin's Castle, Inc., 455 
U.S. 283, 289, 71 L. Ed. 2d 152, 102 S. Ct. 1070 (1982); see also  American Legion Post 7 of Durham, N.C. v. City of Durham, 
239 F.3d 601, 605 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). Thus, plaintiffs have not shielded themselves from liability by moving the direct travel-
related links from cosmos.com to cosmotravels.com. "
207,16," Notwithstanding the issue of incontestability, it is quite apparent that the marks ""Cosmos"" and ""Cosmos Tourama"" are 
distinctive, not generic, and therefore protectible under the Lanham Act. Indeed, because it is clear that these marks are either 
arbitrary or suggestive, they are deemed distinctive without requiring a showing of secondary meaning. See  Washington 
Speakers Bureau, Inc. v. Leading Authorities, Inc., 33 F. Supp. 2d 488, 494 (E.D. Va. 1999) HN7[
] (holding that both arbitrary 
and suggestive marks are deemed distinctive and are afforded the highest protections under the Lanham Act). Plaintiffs argue that because the term ""Cosmos"" is, ostensibly, a commonly-used term, the mark ""Cosmos"" is generic. This is not 
so; simply because a word is commonly-used does not render it generic. Rather, many commonly-used terms receive Lanham 
Act protection within a particular industry: ""Delta"" faucets, ""Polo"" clothing, and ""Apple"" computers."
207,17," A distinguished commentator has also noted that HN9[
] while the generic nature of a term is not on the Section 1115(b) list, the Lanham Act also requires that no incontestable right shall be acquired in a generic name. See McCarthy § 32:149. Cf.  Lone 
Star, 43 F.3d at 930 (not recognizing this additional exception). In any event, the terms ""Cosmos"" and ""Cosmos Tourama"" are 
not generic. See infra note 16. "
208,18," HN10[
] Plaintiffs are required to prove abandonment by ""clear and convincing evidence."" McCarthy § 17:12."
208,19," HN11[
] Even if a mark somehow loses its incontestable status, it may still be found to be protectible if the remaining requirements of Section 1125(a) are met. See McCarthy § 31:60 (noting that a mark holder's ""separate federal rights in 
unregistered marks under [Section 1125(a)] continue unabated even if a registration is disregarded or cancelled""); see also  
Orient Express Trading Co. v. Federated Dep't Stores, Inc., 842 F.2d 650 (2d Cir. 1988) (holding that fraud in the registration 
process leading to cancellation of registrations does not bar possible relief based upon a [Section 1125(a)] claim for infringement 
of unregistered rights). Thus, even if defendant's ""Cosmos"" mark were unregistered, the mark would still be protectible because 
it is ""arbitrary"" or ""suggestive."" Such marks are categorically deemed distinctive and therefore entitled to the highest level of 
protection. See supra note 16."
208,20," This lack of ""naked"" licensing distinguishes the case at bar from CNA Financial Corp v. Brown, 922 F. Supp. 567, 574 (M.D. 
Fla. 1996), the case plaintiffs cite in support of their claim of abandonment. "
209,21," It is also well-established that HN14[
] although ""the likelihood of confusion is factual issue dependent on the circumstances 
of each case…, summary judgment is appropriate when the material, undisputed facts disclose a likelihood of confusion,"" a 
determination that courts make in light of the seven factors. Resorts of Pinehurst, Inc. v. Pinehurst Nat. Corp., 148 F.3d 417, 422 
(4th Cir. 1998). Thus, although likelihood of confusion is a factual issue, ""weighing the seven factors that determine likelihood of 
confusion is a judicial function."" International Bancorp, 192 F. Supp. 2d at 483 (citing Pinehurst, 148 F.3d at 422). Furthermore, 
in determining whether a likelihood of confusion exists, courts should consider the specific facts and circumstances of each 
case. See  Anheuser Busch, 962 F.2d at 318."
209,22," HN15[
] The burden falls upon defendant, the putative senior mark holder, to establish likelihood of confusion. Defendant 
argues that this burden ought to fall upon plaintiffs because they have engaged in copying defendant's mark. For the burden to 
shift to plaintiffs, however, such copying must be shown to be intentional. See  Larsen v. Terk Technologies Corp., 151 F.3d 
140, 149 (4th Cir. 1998); International Bancorp, 192 F. Supp. 2d at 483. Because the evidence of intentional copying is not 
compelling, the analysis here proceeds with defendant as the party bearing the burden of proving likelihood of confusion."
209,23, The same proof establishes trademark infringement and unfair competition under Sections 1114 and 1125(a). 
210,24," The ACPA bad faith factors are: (1) the trademark or other intellectual property rights of the registrant, if any, in the domain name; (2) the extent to which the domain name consists of the legal name of the person or a name that is otherwise commonly 
used to identify that person; (3) the person's prior use, if any, of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of any goods or services; (4) the person's bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible under the domain name; (5) the person's intent to divert consumers from the mark owner's online location to a site accessible under the domain 
name that could harm the goodwill represented by the mark, either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or 
disparage the mark; (6) the person's offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any third party for financial 
gain without having used, or having intent to use, the domain name in the bona fide offering of any goods or services or the 
person's prior conduct indicating a pattern of such conduct; (7) the person's provision of material and misleading false contact information when applying for the registration of the 
domain name, the person's intentional failure to maintain accurate contact information, or the person's prior conduct 
indicating a pattern of such conduct; (8) the person's registration or acquisition of multiple domain names that the person knows are identical or confusingly 
similar to the distinctive marks of others or are dilutive of the famous marks of others; and (9) the extent to which the mark incorporated in the domain name is distinctive and famous within the meaning of the 
Federal Trademark Dilution Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(i). "
211,25, See supra note 15. 
212,26," It is also apparent that plaintiffs fall outside the ACPA's ""safe harbor,"" which provides that ""bad faith intent… shall not be found 
in any case in which the court determines that the person believed and had reasonable grounds to believe that the use of the 
domain name was a fair use or otherwise lawful."" 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B)(ii). Nothing in the record reflects that plaintiffs meet 
this standard."
212,27," See  International Bancorp, 192 F. Supp. 2d 467, 485 (noting that it is permissible to look beyond the nine ACPA factors to 
determine whether a putative infringer acted with the requisite bad faith); Cnnews.com, 177 F. Supp. 2d at 522 (same)."
212,28," HN22[
] The Lanham Act, standing alone without the ACPA, is sufficient to order the transfer of domain names and the 
issuance of an injunction. See  Washington Speakers, 33 F. Supp. 2d at 488; McCarthy § 25:71. Such a result does not render the ACPA meaningless, for it, inter alia, (i) reinforces the concept established in cases such as 
Washington Speakers that courts may transfer ownership of infringing domain names, (ii) provides an in rem cause of action, 
and (iii) provides a statutory damages remedy, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1117(d), relief not sought by defendant here. "
213,29," Of course, Virginia choice of law rules apply here. See  ITCO Corp. v. Michelin Tire Corp., Commercial Div., 722 F.2d 42, 49 
n.11 (4th Cir. 1983) (holding that in federal question cases, a district court entertaining pendent state claims should follow the 
choice of law rules of the forum state) (citing Klaxon Co v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496, 85 L. Ed. 1477, 61 S. Ct. 
1020 (1941)); Jones v. R.S. Jones and Assoc., Inc., 246 Va. 3, 431 S.E.2d 33, 34 (Va. 1993) (holding that Virginia applies the 
lex loci delicti, the law of the place of the wrong); Diaz Vicente v. Obenauer, 736 F. Supp. 679, 690 (E.D. Va. 1990) (""The rule of 
lex loci delicti is well-settled in Virginia; the place of the injury supplies the government law in tort actions."")."
213,30," See, e.g.,  Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Inc. v. Contico Intern., Inc., 836 F. Supp. 1247, 1262 (W.D. Va. 1993) (holding 
that ""the requirements for success on the merits of [a Virginia trademark] claim are substantially similar to those for the federal 
Lanham Act claim""). "
221,1," The facts as stated in this Memorandum and Order are taken from Defendant's Counterclaim and should not be construed as 
findings of this Court. In a motion to dismiss, the Court is obligated, for the purposes of that motion, to accept as true the facts 
set forth by the non-moving party, in this case, the Defendant."
221,2, SBC Ameritech Ohio is a trade name under which The Ohio Bell Telephone Company conducts its business.
221,3," CoreComm explains that a LATA is a geographic market section that was established when AT&T was broken up. There are 
six LATA's in Ohio. "
223,4," The parties also included a clause in their Interconnection Agreement in which they agreed that ""no remedy under this 
Agreement is intended to be exclusive and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or 
remedies now or hereafter existing under applicable law or otherwise."" Interconnection Agreement § 26.6."
223,5," Prior to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, it was well settled that there was no repugnancy between the antitrust laws and the 
regulatory scheme that was then applicable to the telecommunications industry. See  Southern Pac. Communications Co. v. 
AT&T, 238 U.S. App. D.C. 309, 740 F.2d 980, 999-1000(D.C. Cir. 1984)(citations omitted). While the 1996 Telecommunications "
224,," Act added additional requirements, both the 1996 Act and the prior regulatory scheme subjected rates or tariffs, and other 
conditions for interconnections and other access to local distribution facilities to FCC approval. Id. "
225,6," It is possible that although these activities don't state independent antitrust claims in the context of this case, they could be 
additional evidence of SBC's alleged intent to maintain its monopoly."
225,7," An exception to the general rule that competitors, outside of an essential facilities claim, have no duty to assist or even deal 
with their competitors was established in Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 
105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985). This exception, however, does not apply under the facts set forth in the Counterclaim. In Aspen, the 
competitors had a previous history of voluntary cooperation in a joint marketing venture that had proven profitable for both 
parties. In this case, there is no history of prior cooperation, and no allegation that SBC's cooperation with CoreComm would be 
profitable for SBC. The only basis alleged for any agreement or cooperation between SBC and CoreComm has been forced 
through regulation. "
226,8," None of the cases cited by SBC in support of its motion to dismiss addressed a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Though in the cited 
cases, the facts did not bear out a distinction between the contract claims at issue and the additional misrepresentation claims, 
these cases were decided at the summary judgment stage or later after there had been more opportunity for factual 
development of the claims. "
233,1," Dee-K does not appeal the denial of its Rule 50 motion. It does, however, appeal the denial of its motion for a new trial, 
asserting that the jury's finding of no substantial effect was against the weight of the evidence. In fact, the producers provided 
the jury with a good deal of evidence supporting the challenged finding, including evidence that increased latex prices or 
antidumping duties, or both, accounted for rubber-thread price increases. Given these alternatives, nothing about this case 
presents the ""exceptional circumstances"" that might lead us to conclude that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. 
See Bristol Steel & Iron Works, Inc. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 41 F.3d 182, 186 (4th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted); see also 
Poynter v. Ratcliff, 874 F.2d 219, 223 (4th Cir. 1989); see generally 11 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and 
Procedure § 2819 (2d ed. 1995 & Supp. 2002)."
233,2," We recognize that the Ninth Circuit has suggested that the foreign-conduct question affects the substantive analysis of a 
particular offense under the antitrust laws. See Metro Indus. v. Sammi Corp., 82 F.3d 839, 844-45 (9th Cir. 1996). Although 
market effect of course has its place in substantive antitrust analysis, we follow the Supreme Court and Congress in treating 
allegations that an antitrust case involves only foreign conduct as raising a jurisdictional issue. See 15 U.S.C.A. § 6a (West 
1997) (addressing the presence of certain types of foreign conduct in an antitrust case by providing that the Sherman Act does 
not apply to such cases at all); Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 795-96; see also Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of 
the United States § 415, reporter's note 3 (1987) (""Accurate analysis distinguishes between the requirement of sufficient effect 
on commerce of the United States to support application of United States law, and the requirement of sufficient injury or anti-
competitive effect to establish liability.""); Wilbur L. Fugate, Foreign Commerce and the Antitrust Laws § 2.14 at 16 (Supp. 2002) 
(criticizing the Metro Industries court on this point); IA Philip Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 273 (2d ed. 2000) 
(""We emphasize that 'jurisdictional' and 'substantive' inquiries are not wholly independent.""). "
234,3," Not even the producers suggest that we should, by analogy or otherwise, borrow the FTAIA standard in this import case. "
235,4," After Alcoa as before, a wholly domestic antitrust case does not necessarily require any proof of an effect on commerce. See, 
e.g., Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Superior Ct. Trial Lawyers Ass'n, 493 U.S. 411, 432-36, 107 L. Ed. 2d 851, 110 S. Ct. 768 (1990) 
(expounding on the rationale for per se antitrust rules that create a presumption of effect in many cases); McLain, 444 U.S. at 
242 (explaining that antitrust jurisdictional requirements in a domestic case may be satisfied by a showing that ""the defendants' 
activity"" of any magnitude ""is itself in interstate commerce"")."
235,5," Nor, as Dee-K notes, did the Court resolve whether the Sherman Act might also apply to foreign conduct (however defined) 
that meets some lesser standard -- that is, whether intent alone, substantial effect alone, or some ""effect"" less than ""substantial"" 
coupled with intent might suffice. Instead, the Court stated that the Sherman Act does apply to foreign conduct when intent and 
substantial effect exist, without explicitly excluding the possibility of jurisdiction in other circumstances. 509 U.S. at 796; see also 
IA Areeda & Hovenkamp § 273. (Indeed, the parties presented no jurisdictional issue to the Court in Hartford Fire; rather, the "
236,," defendant reinsurers ""conceded"" jurisdiction, but contended that ""the District Court should have declined to exercise such 
jurisdiction under the principle of international comity."" 509 U.S. at 795-97.) However, we need not decide whether the Hartford Fire formulation is the only test for jurisdiction in antitrust cases involving 
foreign conduct, because Dee-K has waived this argument by failing to pursue it in the district court. Dee-K now contends that 
the district court should have applied a test drawn from the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law § 415(2), permitting a 
lesser effects test if the intent to affect the United States was a ""principal purpose"" of the conduct -- but Dee-K never so much as 
mentioned a ""principal purpose"" requirement in the district court, nor objected to the jury instructions or special verdict form on 
this basis. Never having proposed its theory or alternative test to the district court, Dee-K cannot prevail on this argument on 
appeal. "
237,6," The Hartford Fire Court specifically declined to decide whether the FTAIA governed a refusal to sell a service into the United 
States, even though the lower courts had held that the FTAIA did not apply to such conduct. See In re Ins. Antitrust Litig., 723 F. 
Supp. at 486, aff'd on this ground, 938 F.2d at 932, rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 796 n.23 (taking 
no position on the applicability of the FTAIA). Perhaps the Court declined to decide the issue because a refusal to sell a service 
into the United States does not 'enter' the United States in some sense, as an import does. "
238,7," The Nippon Paper court stated that the Sherman Act treated civil and criminal jurisdiction alike and then extended criminal 
jurisdiction by applying the Hartford Fire test from the civil context. See 109 F.3d at 4-8. Dee-K seeks to distinguish Nippon 
Paper on the ground that it involved goods not directly sold into the United States market by the price-fixers themselves. 
However, Dee-K can point to no authority applying per se condemnation to foreign price fixing simply because the price fixing 
was on directly imported goods. Moreover, nothing in Nippon Paper suggests that the corporate layer between the price-fixers 
and the United States market protected the price-fixers from full domestic treatment, i.e., that the case might have been 
analyzed as domestic conduct if the price-fixing scheme had not been indirect. Indeed, the commentators see Nippon Paper as 
novel, not because it applied an effects test as a prerequisite for jurisdiction, but because it asserted jurisdiction at all in a 
criminal context. See Fugate § 2.14 at 14, 15 (Supp. 2002); IA Areeda & Hovenkamp § 272i at 364-68. "

253,8," Many of the cases in this consolidated action were transferred to this District pursuant to the MDL Transfer Order. Although a 
transferee court in an MDL action consolidated for pretrial purposes under 28 U.S.C. § 1407 can exercise personal jurisdiction to 
the same extent that the transferor court could, In re Agent Orange, 818 F.2d at 163; In re Telectronics Pacing Systems, 953 F. 
Supp. 909 (S.D. Oh. 1997), the parties have not presented evidence or argument regarding BASF AG's or BASF Coatings's 
contacts with respective jurisdictions of the transferor courts."
253,9," Although this interpretation of Section 12 appears to conflict with HN10[
] the general canon of statutory construction that 
""referential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent[,] [i.e.,] the 
last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence,"" see NORMAN J. 
SINGER, SUTHERLAND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION § 47.33 (6th ed. 2000), the rule is merely an aid to interpretation and 
is not inflexible or uniformly binding. Id. See also Tippins, 37 F.3d at 93 (stating that the canons of interpretation are more 
appropriately applied to divine intent from statutes that carefully worded and assiduously compiled than from imprecise statutory 
language); Shendock v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 893 F.2d 1458, 1464 (3d Cir. 1990); Paper 
Systems Inc. v. Mitsubishi Corp., 967 F. Supp. 364, 367 (E.D. Wisc. 1997). "
254,10," We note that even the D.C. District Court, bound by the Circuit's holding in GTE, has ""questioned whether the holding of GTE 
comports with the goals of the antitrust laws . . . ."" In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 94 F. Supp. 2d 26, 27, n.3 (D.D.C. 2000). 
Originally, in that case, the district court upheld the national contacts standard espoused in Go-Video.  In re Vitamin Antitrust 
Litig., 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12405, 1999 WL 728100 (D.D.C., July 29, 1999). However, in light of the D.C. Circuit's subsequent 
holding in GTE, the district court reconsidered its decision and ruled that Section 12 does not permit a national contacts test in 
determining the existence of personal jurisdiction. 94 F. Supp. 2d at 27, n.2. The district court nevertheless expressed its 
concern with the effect of the GTE holding on the consolidation and management of multidistrict litigation.  Id., at 30 and n.2. "
255,11," We have no occasion here to determine whether any of the general venue statutes would, in addition to Section 12, be 
applicable to domestic corporations sued under the federal antitrust laws."
255,12," Having held pursuant to Section 12 of the Clayton Act that Plaintiff may establish personal jurisdiction based on Defendants' 
national contacts, we will not address Plaintiffs' arguments under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2). We note, however, application of Rule

transport and termination of telecommunications. 47 U.S.C. § 251(b). Section 251 also imposes additional obligation on ILECs, 
including the duty to interconnect their networks with that of any requesting telecommunications carriers ""on rates, terms, and 
conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory,"" and to negotiate in good faith the agreements establishing the 
rates, terms, and conditions of these interconnections. 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(1) and (2)."

arbitration must be submitted for approval to the respective state public service commission (""PSC"").  47 U.S.C. § 252(e). "
271,5," The district court, however, did not dismiss Covad's antitrust claims in their entirety; it found that allegations that ""BellSouth 
engaged in predatory advertising and promotion"" could support an antitrust violation and dismissed these claims only to the 
extent that they alleged misuse of proprietary information, a subject that is ""covered by paragraph 9 of the Interconnection

Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition."" H.R. Conf. Rep. 104-458, 1996 WL 46795, at *1 (1996). "
274,8," The Goldwasser court stated: Nevertheless, when one reads the complaint as a whole these allegations appear to be inextricably linked to the claims 
under the 1996 Act. Even if they were not, such a conclusion would then force us to confront the question whether the 
procedures established under the 1996 Act for achieving competitive markets are compatible with the procedures that 
would be used to accomplish the same result under the antitrust laws. In our view, they are not. The elaborate system of 
negotiated agreements and enforcement established by the 1996 Act could be brushed aside by any unsatisfied party with 
the simple act of filing an antitrust action. Court orders in those cases could easily conflict with the obligations the state 
commissions or the FCC imposes under the § 252 agreements. The 1996 Act is, in short, more specific legislation that 
must take precedence over the general antitrust laws, where the two are covering precisely the same field. Goldwasser, 222 F.3d at 401. The district court interpreted this language to mean that a Sherman Act antitrust claim cannot ever be brought if it alleges 
conduct also covered by the 1996 Act. We disagree that Goldwasser stands for such a broad proposition, and note that 
Goldwasser tied its conclusion to the specific allegations of the complaint in that case. We do agree, however, with the Second 
Circuit in Trinko, when it concluded that ""HN15[
] controlling case law does not support the theory that specific legislation 
meant to encourage competition necessarily takes precedence over the general antitrust laws,"" Trinko, ___F.3d at ___ (citing 
Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359, 93 S. Ct. 1022 (1973)). The Second Circuit also noted 
that ""it is unlikely that allowing antitrust suits would substantially disrupt the regulatory proceedings mandated by the 
Telecommunications Act."" Id. While acknowledging that injunctive relief in such suits may require judicial restraint, the Trinko 
court stated that ""awarding damages for the willful maintenance of monopoly power would not substantially interfere with the 
regulatory scheme envisioned by the Telecommunications Act,"" noting that in some instances, ""it is possible that the antitrust 
laws will be needed to supplement the regulatory scheme"" to bring competition to the local phone service markets. Id. at ___ 
(footnote omitted)."
274,9," In Goldwasser, the plaintiff pleaded 20 counts, seventeen of which explicitly cited violations of the 1996 Act. Goldwasser then 
alleged that ""all of these practices . . . violate both § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, and the 1996 Act itself."" Goldwasser, 
222 F.3d at 395. None of the charges involved any allegations of anticompetitive intent; rather, the complaint merely asserted 
that the defendant was a monopolist, and that it had violated the 1996 Act. The Seventh Circuit observed, consistent with what 
we have said above, that such allegations of mere failure to fulfill obligations under the 1996 Act are insufficient to state a claim 
under the Sherman Act: ""The fundamental fallacy in the plaintiffs' theory is that the duties the 1996 Act imposes on ILECs are 
coterminous with the duty of a monopolist to refrain from exclusionary practices. They are not."" Id. at 399. The Goldwasser court 
further observed that there exists no independent duty to help competitors under the antitrust laws. Therefore, ""[a] complaint like 
this one, which takes the form 'X is a monopolist; X didn't help its competitors enter the market so that they could challenge its 
monopoly; the prices I must pay X are therefore still too high' does not state a claim under Section 2."" Id. at 400. "
275,10," Consolidated Gas I was reinstated, en banc, by 912 F.2d 1262 (11th Cir. 1990) (""Consolidated Gas II""), which was then 
vacated and remanded in 499 U.S. 915 (1991), because the parties reached a settlement and the case therefore became moot."" "
276,11," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), HN23[
] the Eleventh Circuit adopted as 
binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981."
276,12," We stress here that our inquiry is limited by the standard of review appropriate to BellSouth's Rule 12(b)(6) motion. Covad 
need only have alleged necessary elements of the relevant claims. We are not presented here with deciding, for example, 
whether telephone lines are in fact essential facilities for providing high-speed internet service, or whether BellSouth in fact had 
monopolistic intent in performing the alleged anticompetitive conduct. The standard of review at this stage is, of course, different 
than those at summary judgment or at trial. "
277,13," BellSouth cites to a number of cases denying essential facilities claims, but those cases are distinguishable from the present 
case. For example, Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. v. John Labatt, Ltd., 90 F.3d 737, 748 (3d Cir. 1996), affirming summary judgment, 
involved alleged overcharges under the parties' contract, not denial of access to essential facilities.  Anserphone, Inc. v. Bell Atl. "
278,," Corp., 955 F. Supp. 418, 428-29 (W.D. Pa. 1996), found plaintiff's evidence of poor service an insufficient ""constructive denial"" of 
access to withstand summary judgment. Twin Labs., Inc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 569 (2d Cir. 1990) and Valet 
Apt. Servs. Inc. v. Atlanta Journal & Constitution, 865 F. Supp. 828, 830-31 (N.D. Ga. 1994), involved fact-bound disputes about 
whether and where to place print advertisements."
278,14," BellSouth's argument that the essential facilities claim is really an ordinary breach of contract claim does not support its motion 
to dismiss. Covad's allegations of anticompetitive conduct can and do ""support antitrust liability"" at the pleading stage.  Mr. 
Furniture Warehouse, 919 F.2d at 1522-23 (monopolist's refusal to deal supports Section 2 claim where it is ""designed to have 
an anticompetitive effect""). HN27[
] Breach of contract and antitrust are not mutually exclusive. See  City of Vernon, 955 F.2d at 1368. "
279,15," BellSouth argues that Covad's complaint contains no specific allegation that BellSouth has forgone any economic advantage 
by failing to provide Covad with the accommodations it desires. Although it may be true that there is no specific allegation of this 
sort, the entire complaint alleges that BellSouth's failure to live up to its contractual duties was motivated by its will to 
monopolize, and showing that BellSouth has forgone an economic advantage is simply a fact that, if true, would tend to support 
the contention of monopolistic intent in the fact of a proffered legitimate business justification. Here, on motion to dismiss, there 
is no proffered legitimate business justification for Covad to refute, so the absence of specific factual allegation is irrelevant. See, 
e.g.,  Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 483-84 (ruling on a summary judgment motion and noting that after plaintiff's presentation of 
evidence of Kodak's exclusionary action with monopolistic intent, Kodak bore the initial burden of presenting evidence of ""valid 
business reasons"" to justify its actions). "
280,16," Again, this case is presented to us on a motion to dismiss. BellSouth's response that it has not in fact refused to deal, while an 
appropriate issue for consideration on motion for summary judgment or at trial, is not open to consideration here."
280,17," BellSouth cites Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 223, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 
2578 (1993) (rejecting ""the notion that above-cost prices that are below . . . the costs of a firm's competitors inflict injury to 
competition cognizable under the antitrust laws""); Indeck Energy Servs., Inc. v. Consumers Energy Co., 250 F.3d 972, 978-79 
(6th Cir. 2000) (plaintiff ""has no statutory right to compete in the economic marketplace on [its] own terms and in such a manner 
as to accumulate expected profits""). Compare Br. of Amici Curiae Competitve Telecomm. Ass'n at 29 n.11 (arguing that 
BellSouth should have raised retail prices to protect competitors). "
281,," Covad responds with City of Kirkwood, 671 F.2d at 1179, and Fed. Power Comm'n v. Conway Corp., 426 U.S. 270, 279 (1976) 
(""When costs are fully allocated, both the retail rate and the proposed wholesale rate may fall within a zone of reasonableness, 
yet create a price squeeze between themselves."") (citation omitted). "
291,1," The Russian term is 
. The English transliteration of this term is Krest'yanskiy."
291,2," The Amended Complaint also includes a claim for violation of Pennsylvania's Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection 
Law (Count X). Fresh Made, however, wishes to withdraw the claim, and it will be dismissed. "
292,3," Lifeway and Smolyansky joined in the motion to dismiss, but the Court will refer throughout this memorandum to the parties 
collectively as ""Lifeway."" Danone was originally a defendant as well, but Fresh Made moved to dismiss Danone as a defendant, 
and by order of March 11, 2002, Danone was dismissed from the case. See Docket # 25."
292,4," The settlement agreement has a choice of law clause which selects New York law to govern the terms of the agreement. See 
Agreement at P 17. At oral argument, Fresh Made's counsel conceded that New York law governs the agreement. Tr. of March 
8, 2002 Hr'g (""Tr.""), 3. However, in supplemental briefing, Fresh Made argued that federal common law should govern the 
agreement insofar as it is applied to bar any antitrust claim. HN2[
] The Third Circuit has held that there is no federal policy 
which mandates a uniform national rule to govern the effect of a contractual release as applied to antitrust claims.  Three Rivers 
Motors Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 522 F.2d 885, 889 (3d Cir. 1975). Therefore, as long as state law ""guards against the antitrust 
violator's use of deception to avoid the federally-created cause of action"", state law is properly applied to interpret releases of 
antitrust claims.  Id. at 892 (applying Pennsylvania law). Because contractual releases procured by fraud are not enforceable 
under New York law, the Court finds that New York law appropriately governs the interpretation of the release at issue. See  
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. v. Imaging Diagnostic Sys., Inc., 176 F. Supp. 2d 199, 204 (S.D.N.Y. 2001); Steen v. Bump, 233 
A.D.2d 583, 649 N.Y.S.2d 731, 732 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996). See also,  VKK Corp. v. Nat'l Football League, 244 F.3d 114, 121-22 
(2d Cir. 2001) (applying New York law to determine the validity of a release encompassing antitrust claims)."
292,5," By its terms, the release does not bar any cause of action arising after the date of the release agreement. For that reason, to 
the extent that Fresh Made alleges claims that post-date the release, such claims survive Lifeway's motion to dismiss based on 
the release. "
293,6," As the Second Circuit recently noted, the ""part and parcel"" doctrine has been ""rarely discussed and more rarely applied."" VKK 
Corp., 244 F.3d at 125. In fact, the VKK Court observed that no court of appeals ""has ever applied the part and parcel theory to 
invalidate a release."" Id. at 126."
293,7," At oral argument, Fresh Made also argued that the release should not be applied at the motion to dismiss stage to bar its 
claims. Under New York law, Fresh Made argues, courts interpreting broad release language are required to go behind the 
language to determine what the intent of the parties to the agreement was. The caselaw relied on by Fresh Made, however, 
merely holds that when parties enter into a release ""purporting to exempt a party from liability for injuries which may occur in the 
future"", the release covers only those claims which were ""within the contemplation of the parties at the time"" of execution. 
Bradley Realty Corp. v. State of New York, 54 A.D.2d 1104, 389 N.Y.S.2d 198, 199 (N.Y. App. Div. 1976) (emphasis added). 
See  Beardslee v. Blomberg, 70 A.D.2d 732, 416 N.Y.S.2d 855, 856-57 (N.Y. App. Div. 1979). The release in this case does not 
seek to exempt either party from liability for future conduct, but releases only past claims. Therefore, because the HN4[
] 
release language is clear and unambiguous on its face, the Court need not look to extrinsic evidence to give meaning to its 
terms. See, e.g.,  Goldberg v. Mfr's Life Ins. Co., 242 A.D.2d 175, 672 N.Y.S.2d 39, 44 (N.Y. App. Div. 1998)."
293,8," HN6[
] Because a release procured by fraud in the inducement is voidable at the option of the defrauded party, that party can 
choose to affirm or disaffirm the contract. See  Laudenberg, 176 F. Supp. 2d at 204. In order to disaffirm the contract, the 
defrauded party must offer to return the consideration received. Id. Fresh Made asserts that it may maintain the current action "
294,," without returning the $ 30,000 it received under the agreement because it is entitled to affirm the contract and seek to recover 
damages in an amount equal to the difference between the actual value of the contract and the value as fraudulently 
represented by Lifeway. Fresh Made argues that there is a question of fact about whether or not the $ 30,000 was given by 
Lifeway as consideration for the release or consideration for the purchase of labels. For that reason, Fresh Made believes that it 
is entitled to affirm the contract for the purchase of labels and to maintain its suit while avoiding the release. Under New York 
law, a party is entitled to affirm a contract and bring an action alleging fraud, while avoiding the defense of release. See  
Goldsmith v. Nat'l Container Corp., 287 N.Y. 438, 442-43, 40 N.E.2d 242 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1942) (""the releases given by the 
plaintiff, which the defendants' answer pleads as a defense, do not bar the present action at law whereby the plaintiff seeks 
damages due to alleged fraudulent misrepresentations and concealments which induced him to give such releases""). For that 
reason, Fresh Made need not, at this point, return the $ 30,000 received under the April 2000 agreement in order to avoid the 
release through its allegations of fraud."
294,9," To recover damages, a private antitrust plaintiff must also allege that it has suffered an ""injury in fact"" that is attributable to 
something the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. See  J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 562, 68 
L. Ed. 2d 442, 101 S. Ct. 1923 (1981). The Amended Complaint alleges that Fresh Made suffered economic losses such as ""lost 
income, revenues and profits"", that it has been deprived of the opportunity to expand, grow or otherwise become more profitable, 
and that its participation in the market has been restricted or reduced. Am. Compl. at PP 100, 101, 105(b). These allegations 
sufficiently state that Fresh Made has suffered an injury in fact. See ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law 
Developments, 762 (4th ed. 1997). In addition, as a direct competitor of Lifeway, the injuries to Fresh Made's business and 
participation in the market fall into the category of injuries that flow from the conduct that the antitrust laws were intended to 
prevent. See  Merican, Inc. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 713 F.2d 958, 964 & n.14 (3d Cir. 1983). "
295,10," The United States can, in appropriate instances, be a relevant geographic market. See, e.g.,  United States v. Grinnell Corp., 
384 U.S. 563, 575, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966)."
295,11," HN10[
] Reasonable interchangeability of use implies that ""one product is roughly equivalent to another for the use to which 
it is put."" Queen City, 124 F.3d at 437. Reasonable interchangeability can be indicated by cross-elasticity of demand between 
the product itself and substitutes for it. Id. Products in a relevant market are ""characterized by a cross-elasticity of demand, in 
other words, the rise in the price of a good within a relevant product market would tend to create a greater demand for other like 
goods in that market."" Id. (quoting Tunis Bros., 952 F.2d at 722)."
295,12," Fresh Made does allege that its products serve the needs of the ""Russian-speaking immigrant community that has taken 
residence in the United States."" Am. Compl. P 17. Fresh Made also alleges that it is these immigrants who represent the market 
for the ""niche or specialty dairy products"" that it produces. Id. at P 19. These allegations suggest that Fresh Made may be able 
to plead a relevant sub-market within the overall dairy market. See  Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325, 8 L. 
Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962) HN11[
] (holding that within a ""broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist which, in 
themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes""). Factors indicating whether the finding of a sub-market is 
appropriate include ""industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar 
characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and 
specialized vendors."" Id. See  Tower Air, Inc. v. Federal Express Corp., 956 F. Supp. 270, 280 (E.D.N.Y. 1996); Tasty Baking 
Co. v. Ralston Purina, Inc., 653 F. Supp. 1250, 1258 (E.D. Pa. 1987). However, a complaint alleging a submarket is not excused 
from grounding its allegations with facts regarding reasonable interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand. "
296,13," There is no allegation that Danone is a competitor of Lifeway in the relevant market, so any argument that any alleged 
agreement between those two parties is sufficient to state a horizontal boycott would be unavailing. "
297,14," Courts have, however, extended Copperweld to situations where the parent corporation owned all but a de minimis portion of 
the subsidiary. See  Siegel Transfer, 54 F.3d at 1132-33 (applying Copperweld because 99.92% stock ownership was de 
minimis variation from 100% ownership); Julian O. von Kalinowski, et al., 1 Antitrust Laws and Trade Regulation, § 11.02[2][a][iii] 
at 11-16 through 11-17 (2d Ed. Matthew Bender, 2001) (citing cases)."
297,15," Fresh Made also cites a pre-Copperweld case from the Northern District of California to support its argument that single firm 
behavior can be litigated under Section 1 under a ""thin conspiracy"" theory. See  Gen. Communications Eng'g, Inc. v. Motorola 
Communications and Elecs., Inc., 421 F. Supp. 274 (N.D. Cal. 1976). However, as it pre-dates Copperweld, it is of little value."
297,16," Lifeway argues that because these persons or entities are unnamed, the allegation is insufficient. At oral argument, Fresh 
Made stated that if granted leave to amend the complaint, it would name at least some of the manufacturers, distributors, and 
store owners involved in the conspiracy. Tr. at 52. Such an amendment should alleviate Lifeway's concern."
297,17," Lifeway also argues that Fresh Made's allegations of conspiracy between Lifeway and manufacturers, distributors, and store 
owners describe statements made exclusively by Lifeway, and action by the other entities only under duress. See Am. Compl. 
PP 36-40. However, ""even if one is coerced by economic threats or pressure to participate in an illegal scheme, that does not 
make him any less a co-conspirator"" for purposes of Section 1. E.g.,  Otto Milk Co. v. United Dairy Farmers Coop. Ass'n, 261 F. 
Supp. 381, 385 (E.D. Pa. 1966), aff'd 388 F.2d 789 (3d Cir. 1967)."
297,18," Section 2 can support a claim for monopolization or attempted monopolization. The Amended Complaint states only a claim 
for attempted monopolization. Am. Compl. PP 112-117."
297,19," Lifeway did not challenge the Amended Complaint's allegations of anti-competitive conduct. In addition, Fresh Made alleges 
that Lifeway had specific intent to achieve monopoly power, and the alleged statements of Smolyansky are a sufficient factual 
basis for this assertion. See Am. Compl. PP 74 & 112. "
298,20," HN18[
] To establish a Lanham Act violation, a plaintiff must prove that: (1) the defendant has made false or misleading 
statements as to his own product or another's; (2) that there is actual deception or at least a tendency to deceive a substantial 
portion of the intended audience; (3) that the deception is material in that it is likely to influence purchasing decisions; (4) that the 
advertised goods traveled in interstate commerce; and (5) that there is a likelihood of injury to the plaintiff in terms of declining 
sales, loss of good will, or the like. U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Blue Cross of Greater Phila., 898 F.2d 914, 922-23 (3d Cir. 1990)."
298,21," Of course, because Fresh Made has alleged that the release was procured by fraud, the release cannot, at this stage, act to 
bar the Lanham Act claim. "
299,22," The Court also recognizes that it is questionable whether a plaintiff can recover damages under a common law restraint of 
trade theory in Pennsylvania. Some courts have concluded that there is no private remedy for damages under a common law 
restraint of trade theory, while others have left the question open. See  Collins, 304 A.2d at 498 (finding an agreement in 
restraint of trade to be invalid, but awarding only injunctive relief, holding that the record did ""not provide any legal basis for an 
award of damages""); Lakeview Ambulance, 1995 WL842000 at *4 (recognizing that certain courts have recognized a common 
law anti-trust cause of action, ""but only in the limited circumstances of trademarks, trade secrets, or restraint of trade pursuant to 
statute""); XF Enters. Inc. v. BASF Corp., 47 Pa. D. & C.4th 147, No. 9906-1477, 2000 WL 33155746, *1 (Pa. Ct. Comm. Pleas 
July 13, 2000) (""No court to date has held that a private remedy is available for damages under Pennsylvania's common law on 
antitrust violations.""). Even if a private plaintiff in Pennsylvania could recover under common law restraint of trade theory, the 
Amended Complaint has failed to state such a claim. Therefore, the Court need not, at this point, decide whether it would be 
possible for a plaintiff to recover under such a theory. "
300,23," To the extent that Fresh Made's conspiracy claim is based on a conspiracy between Fresh Made and the unnamed 
manufacturers, distributors and store owners, the claim is also on unsound footing. See, e.g.,  Fox, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
19370, 1997 WL 793590 at *2 (dismissing civil conspiracy claim where the identity of the co-conspirators was ""unclear at best""). 
As mentioned above, Fresh Made has indicated that it would name certain of the manufacturers, distributors and store owners if 
granted leave to amend. Tr. 52. This could cure any defect in the identification of any such conspirators."
300,24," The tort of wrongful use of civil proceedings makes a person liable for initiating or continuing a civil proceeding if he acts (1) in 
a grossly negligent manner or without probable cause and primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the proper 
discovery, joinder of parties or adjudication of the claim in which the proceedings are based; and (2) the proceedings have 
terminated in favor of the person against whom they are brought. See  Rosen v. Am. Bank of Rolla, 426 Pa. Super. 376, 627 
A.2d 190, 191-92 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1993) (citing 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 8351). Here there are no allegations that any of the "
301,," court proceedings initiated by Lifeway terminated in favor of Fresh Made (indeed, the parties settled two of the lawsuits and one 
is ongoing), and the tort of wrongful initiation of civil proceedings is not applicable."
301,25," As an illustration, Lifeway distributes its products to some 15,000 stores nationwide. Tr. at 55. Because the proposed relevant 
market encompasses the entire country, each of these stores is potentially implicated by Fresh Made's allegations. "
302,26, Fresh Made's intention to name certain stores and distributors in any amended pleading could address this shortcoming. 
312,1," Judge Politz was a member of the panel that heard oral arguments. However, due to his death on May 25, 2002, he did not 
participate in this decision. This case is being decided by a quorum pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(d) (1996)."
312,2," In its complaint, Apani stated that the property ""owned and operated"" by the City consisted of twenty-seven facilities."
312,3, This contract provided for a ten-year term and the automatic right to renew for an additional five years. 
314,4," Although Brown Shoe Co. involved a violation of § 7 of the Clayton Act, the tests for determining a geographic market under §§ 
3 and 7 of the Act are similar.  Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. at 329; United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 366, 10 
L. Ed. 2d 915, 83 S. Ct. 1715 (1963). Thus, cases determining a geographic area under § 7 are equally applicable to cases 
brought under § 3.  Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. at 329-330. "
316,5," HN15[
] Monopsony refers to price fixing or monopolization by a single buyer.  In re Beef Industry Antitrust Litigation, 600 F.2d 1148 (5th Cir.1979). "
317,6," Tampa Elec. Co., 365 U.S. at 331-32. "
321,7," CCE also claims that in order to show a violation of Article I, Section 26 of the Texas Constitution, Apani must establish the 
elements necessary to sustain a cause of action under federal antitrust laws, namely, a relevant market. The district did not 
address this issue. Because we find that Apani has failed to demonstrate a viable cause of action under Section 26, we need not 
address this alternative basis for affirmance. "
322,8," With respect to Apani's assertion that the alleged violation of the bidding laws is an unlawful act, which may support its tortious 
interference claim, we find this argument meritless. As the district court correctly stated, in denying Apani's motion to alter or 
amend summary judgment, Apani had failed to address or provide any authority supporting its conclusion that an independent 
cause of action under the Texas bidding statutes may be asserted against a third party who enters into a contract with a 
governmental entity. HN24[
] Since Apani did not present any evidence at the district court level on this issue, nor argue this 
question in its brief, we conclude that the issue is not properly before us.  St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Williamson, 224 F.3d 425, 
445 (5th Cir. 2000) (""We deem abandoned those issues not presented and argued in an appellant's initial brief, nor do we 
consider matters not presented to the trial court.""). "
332,1," Bell Atlantic is now known as Verizon. For the purposes of this Opinion, the Court will refer to the collective plaintiffs and the 
Third Party defendant as Verizon. When necessary, the Court will refer to the individual parties as Verizon Pennsylvania, 
Verizon New Jersey and Verizon Maryland. "
333,2," This matter was originally assigned to the Honorable Anne E. Thompson, U.S.D.J. and subsequent to her decision on Verizon's 
original motion, this matter was transferred to the undersigned. "
335,3," As highlighted by Verizon, Section 252(c)(4) of the Telecommunications Act does not exist. See Verizon Br. at 11 n.5. Ntegrity 
confirms that it intended to cite § 251(b) and (c). See Ntegrity Br. at 38 n.5. "
337,4," Ntegrity urges this Court to disregard the instant motion to dismiss the Counterclaim arguing that Judge Thompson has already 
considered the sufficiency of the Counterclaim and impliedly rejected the holdings of the Seventh Circuit in Goldwasser 222 F.3d 
390. However, the holding in Goldwasser was not mentioned in the prior opinion, nor was the origin of the relationship between 
the these two parties. As such, this Court is obligated to consider issues of law which might preclude the antitrust causes of 
action. Further, Ntegrity's Counterclaim and Third Party Complaint were amended after the previous motion practice, thus 
inviting review of the revised pleading. Therefore, the Court will consider the instant motion because the rule of law created by 
Goldwasser was not fully briefed or considered in the prior motion to dismiss. "
342,5," Each of the three interconnection agreements between the parties have been included in the pleadings of each plaintiff. The 
contract between Verizon Pennsylvania and Ntegrity was attached to plaintiff's initial Complaint, as was the contract between 
Verizon New Jersey and Ntegrity. Verizon Maryland included a copy of its interconnection agreement along with its Third Party 
Counterclaim. HN19[
] As these documents are relied upon and referred to by each of the Complaints and the Counterclaim, 
this Court may refer on the contents of these contracts in ruling on the instant motion to dismiss. See  In re Burlington Coat 
Factories Securities Litigation, 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). Each of the agreements are substantively similar, and the 
Court will refer to the collective agreements as the ""Contracts"" unless a specific provision varies in the context of an individual 
contract. "
344,6," Ntegrity argues that its claim is cognizable under sections 206 and 207 of the 1934 Act because those provisions provide for 
federal court jurisdiction over violations of the Act. However, as stated, HN24[
] Ntegrity has not properly pled violations of the section 251. Therefore, there is no violation of the Act which would be cognizable under §§ 206 and 207. This conclusion also 
moots the question of whether this Court may address disputes arising under interconnection agreements, or if it may only act 
once a state commission has made a final determination as Verizon urges. As Ntegrity has failed to state a claim, the Court does 
not need to reach this issue."
344,7," Verizon does not argue that Ntegrity's state law claims are precluded under the Telecommunications Act. However, the 
Contracts between the parties specifically provide for dispute resolution by any means ""that may be available under this 
Agreement or at law or in equity."" See Contracts P 22. Although the issue has not been briefed by the parties, it does not appear 
that section 252(e)(6) precludes Ntegrity's state law claims. See HN26[
]  47 U.S.C. § 152 (expressly preserving antitrust and additional causes of action in light of the Act). Further, the Court notes that if Ntegrity's state law claims for breach of contract are 
precluded by the Telecommunications Act, Verizon's breach of contract actions would also be precluded. "
352,1," Shaffer's deposition testimony makes clear that it wasn't until just days before being deposed that he had ever read about 
some of the crucial economic issues in this case. When asked to ""define the relevant market for antitrust purposes,"" Shaffer 
replied, ""You asked that question, and I was asking for some definition, because I know of relevant market … primarily from what 
I read of the materials that you saw earlier, so you're basically asking me to parrot … back something that I've just learned just 
over the last few days."" Shaffer Dep. I at 215. Shaffer's lack of knowledge as to other specific economic issues was apparent 
later in the deposition: Q. What is a diversion ratio for market definition purposes? A. I don't know. Q. Have you ever heard of the Elzinga-Hogarty procedure for a geographic market definition? A. I have not. Q. Do you know what the price correlation test for market definition is? A. No. Q. Do you know how an economist would define market power? A. I read some things about that in the material that you saw this morning, and from that I can tell you I do not know how an 
economist would define it, but I intend to investigate that further. Q. Do you know how an economist goes about diagnosing the presence or absence of market power? A. No. Although, again, I did see some tests. I mean, you will see in that literature that you saw this morning there will be 
tests that give some bullet points about the presence or absence of market power, and so I would - I'm not an economist, 
but I would start with that list. Q. I take it you're not familiar, then, other than what you've read, or what you were supplied with by Mr. Sykes, with any 
standard reference literature on the presence or absence of market power; is that correct? A. Correct. Id. at 226-28. "
357,2," See  Va. Vermiculite, 98 F. Supp. 2d at 732-33 (""Though related to a relevant market determination in an antitrust issue, there 
are differences between an analysis for business investment and an analysis for antitrust purposes. For one, market analyses 
performed for business usually provide information regarding the various places a product would be sold, uses for which it might 
be sold, and the regions in which it might be traded. These analyses do not go into the detail required for antitrust matters. For 
instance, defining where a product could be sold is only a small part of defining a geographic market as there can be relevant 
markets that are narrower or broader than where individual producers sell their products.""). "
361,1," The parties address per se and quick-look together in their analysis. We do the same to avoid needless repetition and because 
the principles are substantially similar. See Cal. Dental. Ass'n, 526 U.S. at 779. "
362,2," Moreover, Plaintiffs rely on § 2 monopoly cases for this proposition of law. In § 2 cases, cost savings and efficiencies are 
irrelevant because we are concerned with the dangers inherent in overwhelming market power. Plaintiffs have not brought a § 2 
claim. See XIII Hovenkamp P2101, at 17 (""Joint ventures are analyzed under the 'restraint of trade' standard rather than the 
monopoly standard.""). "
363,3," At oral argument, Plaintiffs pointed out that Equilon and Motiva at least temporarily relied on their parents' former pricing 
systems. Equilon and Motiva apparently relied on the old pricing systems until new ones could be developed. Developing a new 
system would be one of the challenges faced by the joint ventures as they combined the considerable assets of their parents. 
The fact they temporarily relied upon the old systems does not explain why, as a matter of law, they should be required to do so 
indefinitely. "
364,4," To the extent Plaintiffs believe Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States, 394 U.S. 131, 89 S. Ct. 927, 22 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1969), 
requires complete mergers, we disagree. Citizen Publishing did not ""prevent all forms of joint operation."" Id. at 135; see also 
infra Section II.D.3. "
365,5," The ""sole risk"" provisions apply to refining, not marketing. "
366,6," Plaintiffs allege that Texaco is currently negotiating its withdrawal from the ""Alliance, necessitated by Texaco's agreement to be 
acquired by Chevron."" Joint Argument at 17. Chevron's acquisition of Texaco, resulting in Texaco's need to withdraw, serves as 
an example of why joint venturers provide for dissolution upon consent or reasonable notice. "
367,7," At most, Defendants have exchanged information relating to the marketing of Shell and Texaco branded gasoline. However, 
information exchange is not per se illegal. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. at 440-41 & n.16. Some information exchange 
between Equilon and Motiva is necessary to protect and develop the jointly shared brands as resources."
367,8," We recognize that a price fixing conspiracy offends § 1 whether former competitors agree beforehand to fix prices immediately 
upon formation or agree to wait eight months after formation to raise prices. Here, Plaintiffs have not raised a triable issue of fact 
as to a price fixing conspiracy. "
368,9," Even if we assume Equilon and Motiva controlled over twenty-five (25) percent of the branded gasoline in specific markets, 
Pls.' Facts P33, we have no evidence that Equilon and Motiva contributed to the national rise in wholesale prices. Even in a 
concentrated market, ""rising prices do not themselves permit an inference of a collusive market dynamic."" See Brooke Group 
Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., 509 U.S. 209, 236-37, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). "
369,10," Even if Defendants' non-compete clauses were analogous, Plaintiffs waived any right to recover under a § 1 theory of market 
division. Thus, this aspect of Citizen is inapposite. "
370,11," Congress overruled Citizen by statute as it applied to combinations between newspapers. See Haw. Newspaper Agency v. 
Bronster, 103 F.3d 742, 744 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing Newspaper Preservation Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1801-04 (1970))."
370,12," Plaintiffs carry the ultimate burden of proof at trial and have the burden of showing entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. 
See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Because we conclude they failed to even raise a triable issue of material fact, they cannot show 
entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. "
376,1," The Amended Answer and Counterclaims were filed on February 1, 2002 by Defendant R&S USA LP only and were not joined 
by Defendant Reitter & Schefenacker GmbH & Co. KG (""R&S GmbH""). (See Amended Answer and Counterclaims, Dkt. No. 
147.) "
377,2," These patents are U.S. Patent Nos. 4, 733, 336 (""the '336 patent""); 5, 671, 996 (""the '996 patent""); and 5, 938, 321 (""the '321 
patent"")."
377,3," When a patent infringement suit is used for the purpose of stifling competition with the patent holder's sale of an unpatented 
product, the defendants in the patent infringement suit are entitled to the patent misuse defense. Kolene Corp. v. Motor City 
Metal Treating, Inc., 440 F.2d 77, 84 (6th Cir. 1971). This defense has been subsequently limited by other case law. See, e.g., 
Virginia Panel Corp. v. MAC Panel Co., 133 F.3d 860, 868-871 (Fed. Cir. 1997)."
377,4," Walker Process fraud is the enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the patent office and may constitute a violation of the 
Sherman Act § 2, provided the other elements necessary to a Sherman Act case are present. See Walker Process Equip., Inc. 
v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 174, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247, 86 S. Ct. 347 (1965)."
377,5," R&S USA LP's ""sham litigation"" claim made under § 2 of the Sherman Act seeks to demonstrate Donnelly undertook litigation 
against Defendants for the sole purpose of hindering and disrupting R&S USA LP's business operations. See Re/Max Int'l, Inc. 
v. Realty One, Inc., 173 F.3d 995, 1005 (6th Cir. 1999). "
378,6," Another federal court in this District has held that Michigan's unfair competition claim is mostly limited to ""palming off,"" although 
recognizing unauthorized duplication and deception of the public are also theories under which unfair competition claims have 
been sustained. See Action Publ'ns, Inc. v. Panax Corp., 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24846, 1984 WL 2268, at *11 (W.D. Mich. Nov. 
30, 1984) (Miles, J.) (citing Schwannecke, 247 N.W. at 762 (main source of ""palming off"" theory); A & M Records, Inc. v. M.V.C. 
Distributing Corp., 574 F.2d 312 (6th Cir. 1978) (unauthorized duplication theory); Clairol, Inc. v. Boston Discount Center of 
Berkley, 608 F.2d 1114, 1119-20 (6th Cir. 1979) (deception of public theory)). "
380,7," Clipper Belt cites from 2 Nims on Unfair Competition § 4, at 12-16 (1917), which is apparently from where the statement quoted 
supra was reported. See Clipper Belt, 194 N.W. at 128. Also, Clipper Belt takes note of the statement which was later quoted 
and made famous in Michigan law by Schwannecke in 1933, see supra, which came from a different treatise or source identified 
as 26 R.C.L. 826 et seq. See id. The Clipper Belt Court uses both statements in a manner suggesting they both constitute 
Michigan common law of unfair competition. See id."
380,8," This Court presumes that Illinois state law was at issue in Zenith, although the Federal Circuit did not specify. Cf. Zenith, 182 
F.3d at 1342 (referring to ""the state's unfair competition laws,"" where the case originated in the Northern District of Illinois). "
382,9," Further discussion of the limits of this defense may be found in Virginia Panel Corp., 133 F.3d at 868-871. "
394,1," Some counts of the plaintiffs' original complaint have already been dismissed. See Berlyn, Inc. v. The Gazette Newspapers, 
Inc., 157 F. Supp. 2d 609 (D. Md. 2001)."
394,2," The plaintiffs argue that the Post exercises substantial control over Gazette, and that, in essence, the two function as one. The 
plaintiffs note that: (1) Gazette expenditures require the Post's approval; (2) Gazette's acquisitions were studied, strategized, 
negotiated, and funded by the Post; (3) Gazette regularly reported to the Post; (4) Gazette's CEO and CFO received their 
paychecks from the ""Washington Post Newsweek Tech Media""; and (5) they had mutual interests in acquisitions of the assets of 
companies such as Comprint and the Chesapeake Publishing Company. "
398,3," It is unclear whether expert testimony, as a matter of law, is a necessary predicate to finding a market definition. Courts within 
this Circuit (and some outside) have indicated that a plaintiff must provide expert testimony on this issue. See Military Servs. 
Realty, Inc. v. Realty Consultants of Va., Ltd., 823 F.2d 829, 832 (4th Cir. 1987) (affirming summary judgment because, inter 
alia, the plaintiff's experts ""were simply unable, when deposed, to provide any facts concerning injury to competition, nor could 
they adequately identify the relevant market""); Cogan v. Harford Memorial Hosp., 843 F. Supp. 1013, 1020 (D. Md. 1994) (""To 
allow a jury to make a finding as to the geographic market, [the plaintiff] must provide the Court with expert testimony on this 
highly technical economic question.""); Am. Key Corp. v. Cole Nat'l Corp., 762 F.2d 1569, 1579 (11th Cir. 1985) (""Construction of 
a relevant economic market or a showing of monopoly power in that market cannot . . . be based upon lay opinion testimony.""). 
The Supreme Court has indicated otherwise. See Brooke Group, Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 242, 
125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993) (""Expert testimony is useful as a guide to interpreting market facts, but it is not a 
substitute for them.""). As a practical matter, however, it would seem impossible to prove such a complex economic question 
without the assistance of a qualified expert, viz., an economist."
398,4,"  The court in Virginia Vermiculite explained that the purpose behind an offered market study can be critical: Though related 
to a relevant market determination in an antitrust issue, there are differences between an analysis for business investment 
and an analysis for antitrust purposes. For one, market analyses performed for business usually provide information 
regarding the various places a product would be sold, uses for which it might be sold, and the regions in which it might be 
traded. These analyses do not go into the detail required for antitrust matters. For instance, defining where a product could 
be sold is only a small part of defining a geographic market as there can be relevant markets that are narrower or broader 
than where individual producers sell their products. In addition, market analyses for antitrust markets generally require 
some expertise in the field of industrial organization. Individuals with expertise in defining markets for [a given product] 
generally would not possess the skill and training of a professional economist necessary to define relevant market for 
antitrust purposes."
398,98, F. Supp. 2d at 732-33. 
399,5," This Court has already found that ""the Copperweld doctrine makes clear that Post and Gazette are incapable of conspiring 
under this statute."" Berlyn, Inc., 157 F. Supp. 2d at 615. "
402,6," Plaintiffs' substantive argument that Press Network denied them access to an ""essential facility"" is found in their memoranda 
supporting preliminary injunctive relief. In arguing that their essential facility theory was adequately stated in the amended 
complaint, the plaintiffs cite the amended complaint at paragraphs 12, 23(d) & (e), 28 (f), 30(d), and 47-49. Paragraph 12 of the 
amended complaint describes how Press Network came to be half owned by Gazette and states the circulation and revenue 
figures for papers involved in the Network. Paragraphs 23(d) and 23(e) consist of allegations that Press Network conspired with 
Gazette to restrain trade due to unlawful rate card practices, an allegation which has nothing to do with plaintiffs' theory that 
Press Network was an essential facility or that it deliberately excluded Rossignol and Sentinel. Paragraph 28 (f) is similarly 
without reference to recovery on essential facility grounds. Paragraph 30(d) describes Sentinel's damages. Finally, paragraphs 
47-49 relate to the plaintiffs' breach of contract cause of action."
402,7," Because HN15[
] a cause of action for conspiracy to monopolize requires a showing of concerted action, see Advanced Health -- Care Servs., 910 F.2d at 150, and because the plaintiffs have failed to show concerted action between Press Network 
and any other defendant, see Section III.B.1, supra, the plaintiffs cannot prevail on a conspiracy to monopolize theory as a "
403,," matter of law. Also, as noted in this Court's August 2001 opinion, the Copperweld doctrine prevents a finding that Gazette and 
the Post are capable of conspiracy. Moreover, this Court previously held that Press Network could not be held liable for 
attempted monopolization, as it is not a competitor in the weekly newspaper market. Berlyn, Inc., 157 F. Supp. 2d at 620. "
405,8," In arguing their Section 2 claims, the plaintiffs also discuss ""hiring allegations"" and ""merger and expansion allegations,"" 
presumably as evidence of specific intent on the part of the defendants to monopolize the proposed markets. The plaintiffs 
apparently wish this Court to find that Gazette's hiring of certain Sentinel employees in 1999 speaks to a specific intent to 
monopolize or to eliminate competition in general. The plaintiffs, however, offer insufficient evidence that these hires were 
anything but legitimate. The plaintiffs' other ""hiring allegations"" are plainly irrelevant. First, the plaintiffs offer evidence that Press 
Network (not a proper Section 2 defendant) hired employees of the Journal, which is not a party to this case. Next, the plaintiffs 
offer evidence that the Post hired a Washington Times employee as a consultant concerning the market for legal advertising in 
the Washington, D.C. area. As for the plaintiffs' ""merger and expansion allegations,"" these are similarly irrelevant to the plaintiffs' Section 2 claims. In short, 
the plaintiffs point to evidence that, over the years, the Post has considered a number of acquisitions, some of which it 
consummated. Most of these acquisitions had little to do with the specific markets alleged here, and the company's mere desire 
to expand is insufficient to raise an inference of anticompetitive intent. Moreover, the plaintiffs have failed to identify evidence 
which indicates that each of these acquisitions (or decisions not to acquire) were inconsistent with the Post's rational business 
purposes. Plaintiffs also describe a variety of agreements between the Post or Gazette and third parties, including facially 
appropriate marketing agreements and covenants not to compete. The plaintiffs have failed to show how such agreements were 
against the defendants' rational business interests, and they cannot support an inference that Gazette or the Post intended to 
monopolize any of the proposed relevant markets. "
407,9," Even if there were some evidence of any of these elements somewhere in the substantial record generated during discovery, it 
is the plaintiffs' affirmative burden to identify admissible evidence that warrants denial of a motion for summary judgment.

417,*," The Honorable Donald P. Lay, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation. "
418,1," We do not distinguish between the various sections of the federal antitrust laws relied upon by Flamingo in its complaint -- 15 
U.S.C. §§ 1, 13, 13a, 14, 45 -- because all of these sections are subject to the same analysis as to the sovereign immunity issue 
presented. "
420,2," Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619, 91 S. Ct. 1999 (1971) (recognizing an implied cause of 
action against federal officials who violate the Constitution). "
421,3," Since Global Mail was decided, the Lanham Act was amended to expressly cover the United States and its instrumentalities as 
""persons."" See Pub. L. No. 106-43, §§ 4(c), 6(b), 113 Stat. 219, 220 (1999) (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1127). "
422,4," The Postal Service points out that Global Mail holds that Lanham Act claims, which are federal tort claims, may be brought 
against the Postal Service. According to the Postal Service, this is contrary to the law of this circuit under Pereira v. United 
States Postal Serv., 964 F.2d 873 (9th Cir. 1992). In Pereira, we held that the Postal Service is immune from suit for federal torts 
because the sue-and-be-sued clause is limited by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).  Id. at 876-77. However, subsequent to 
Pereira, the Supreme Court held that the FTCA does not limit a sue-and-be-sued waiver as to federal tort claims because the 
FTCA only applies to state tort claims.  Meyer, 510 U.S. at 476-79 . This overruled Pereira. "
423,5," 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4) imports Administrative Procedures Act (APA) standards of review into procurement cases under 28 
U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1).  39 U.S.C. § 410(a) exempts the Postal Service from most of the APA. In Emery Worldwide Airlines, the 
court noted the possibility that 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4) and 39 U.S.C. § 410(a) are in conflict, although the court avoided deciding 
the issue. See  Emery Worldwide Airlines, 264 F.3d at 1084-85 . We do not see a conflict.  HN18[
]  28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4) incorporates by reference the APA review standards into cases under 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(1); 28 U.S.C. § 1491(b)(4) does not 
create APA liability. "
434,**," The Honorable G. Thomas Van Bebber, Senior District Judge, United States District Court for the District of Kansas, sitting by 
designation."
434,*," This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law or the case, res judicata, and collateral 
estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited 
under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3. "
435,1," At the close of Trane's evidence, the district court entered judgment against Trane on several counterclaims which are not at 
issue in this appeal. "
437,2," Haynes also urges us to apply the principles of the Wisconsin Fair Dealership Law (""WFDL"") to import a good cause 
requirement into the sales franchise agreement. The WFDL is inapplicable, because it applies only to ""dealers"" operating within 
the state of Wisconsin. Wis. Stat. Ann. § 135.02(2). Haynes did not operate his franchise in Wisconsin. We decline to impose the 
obligations of the WFDL on parties to an agreement not covered by the WFDL. "
438,3," Haynes alleged that Trane breached the implied covenants in both performance of the contract and termination of the contract. 
After reviewing the jury instructions, we conclude that the district court instructed the jury to find whether Trane breached the 
implied covenants only with regard to termination of the contract. We also note that Haynes's expert witness only testified about 
damages resulting from termination of the contract. "
439,4," Haynes submitted a requested jury instruction on equitable estoppel (Haynes Supp. App. 639) and also argued that his 
equitable estoppel claim should be submitted to the jury in opposition to Trane's Rule 50(a) motion (App. 3458-59). "
442,5," Because we find that the fraud counterclaim must be retried, we need not decide Trane's assertion that the court had no 
authority to vacate the verdict without a post-verdict motion by HTSA."
442,6," The instruction, in pertinent part read: For Trane to . . . recover from [HTSA] on its counterclaim for fraud by following a pattern or practice of falsifying documents 
submitted in support of claims for payment under the claimback program . . ., you must find that Trane has proven all of the 
following by a preponderance of the evidence:"
442,1, . [HTSA] regularly made false representations of past or present fact.
442,2, . The fact was material.
442,3," . [HTSA] made the representations knowing them to be false, or [HTSA] was aware that [HTSA] did not know whether it 
was true or false."
442,4, . [HTSA] made the representations with the intent that Trane act in reliance on the representations.
442,5, . Trane relied on the representations.
442,6, . Trane's reliance was justified; and
442,7, . This reliance caused damage to Trane by causing it to make payments to which HTSA was not entitled. 
443,7," HTSA also argues that the district court committed reversible error when it admitted evidence of fraudulent acts under Fed. R. 
Evid. 406. However, HTSA has not indicated where in the record it preserved this objection for appeal. In any event, the 
question is moot, because we have determined that the evidence was properly admitted under Fed. R. Evid. 402. HN20[
] ""If 
evidence is admissible under any of the Federal Rules of Evidence, this court may affirm the admission."" United States v. 
Robinson, 978 F.2d 1554, 1562 (10th Cir. 1992). "
444,8," HTSA's assertion that Trane failed to offer adequate proof of its waived counterclaims is without merit, since the substance of 
those claims was never before the court or the jury. "

476,9," Generic drug manufacturers can obtain approval from the FDA to market generic drugs by submitting detailed information 
proving that the generic version is equivalent to the previously approved brand name version. Bioequivalence is demonstrated 
by showing that the generic drug delivers to the body the same amount of active ingredient at the same rate and extent as its 
brand name counterpart. Once bioequivalence is established and the FDA approves the manufacturing controls and labeling of 
the generic substitute, the FDA grants approval for release of the generic drug to the market and assigns an ""AB"" rating. (Id. at

] The Delaware Consumer Fraud statute, 6 Del. C. §§ 2511 et seq., protects non-residents as well as residents from unfair or deceptive merchandising practices conducted ""in part or wholly within"" the State. See  Lony v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours 
and Company, Inc., 821 F. Supp. 956, 961 (D. Del. 1993) (finding standing for citizen of Germany where the alleged 
misrepresentation commenced in Delaware). Hence, class members from other states can assert Delaware law in this case, so 
long as the members' own state consumer fraud statutes do not have material conflicts with the Delaware statute and Delaware 
has significant contacts with the asserted claims of these plaintiffs. See  Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 814-823, 
86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 105 S. Ct. 2965 (1985). Plaintiffs have alleged here that defendant's deceptive conduct ""arose, was directed

484,17," The Northern District of Illinois certified separate nationwide consumer and TPP classes in a class action brought under 
federal antitrust law and the consumer fraud statutes of two states.  In re Synthroid Marketing Litigation, 188 F.R.D. 295 (N.D. 
Ill. 1999) (consumer class certification); In re Synthroid Marketing Litigation, 188 F.R.D. 287 (N.D. Ill. 1999) (TPP class

MS276 (TFH), 2002 WL 246664 (D.D.C. Feb. 1, 2002). A Michigan court certified a class of indirect prescription drug purchasers

Litigation, 200 F.R.D. 326 (E.D. Mich. 2001)."
484,18," The defendant in In re Prudential allegedly engaged in a common, nationwide scheme to defraud customers through 
standardized, deceptive sales presentations. 148 F.3d 283 at 314. The Third Circuit affirmed the district court's determination 
that common issues predominated over individual issues, and rejected an objector's contention that predominance was defeated 
because the claims were subject to the laws of fifty states. 148 F.3d 283 at 315."
484,19," See, e.g., Georgine v. Amchem Products, Inc., 83 F.3d 610, 630 (3d Cir. 1996), aff'd, Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521

multiplicity of individualized factual and legal issues, magnified by choice of law considerations,"" and because some class 
members would develop their injuries sometime in the future and other members were presently injured) "
487,20," A ""fixed co-pay"" as it is used here means the insured pays the same co-pay amount for prescription drugs regardless of 
whether they are name-brand or generic. Plaintiffs assert that most insureds who have co-pays pay a higher co-pay for name-
brand prescription drugs than for generic drugs. Another type of co-pay is a ""percentage co-pay,"" in which the insured pays a 
percentage of the drug's cost. "
491,21," Dr. French states that he is a Senior Vice President of Nathan Associates Inc., an economic and management consulting firm 
that provides economic research and analysis to public and private clients in the United States and abroad. He holds masters 
and doctoral degrees in economics and has experience analyzing economic and financial issues in antitrust and other complex 
litigation. (D.I. 238 at PP1-3) "
492,22," According to the French affidavit, a Narrow Therapeutic Index drug is one in which the tolerance to the drug is so narrow that 
too small a dose can be useless and too large a dose can be dangerous to the patient's health. (D.I. 238 at 5 n.4)"
492,23," This includes $ 105.63 million in damages to Coumadin customers who would have switched to the generic, and $ 28.14 
million to those who would have continued using Coumadin, based on 2.5% supracompetitive pricing for Coumadin (D.I. 238 at 
P10) "
493,24," Dr. French also assumed that Coumadin cost each user an average of $ 23.15 per month (total sales price, including amounts 
paid by consumers and by TPPs). He calculated this figure by dividing $ 500 million annual Coumadin sales equally among 1.8 
million Coumadin users. (D.I. 280 at 11-12) "
494,25," Supplemental submissions by plaintiffs show consumer claimants are likely to receive 100% of their claims, based on the 
number of claims received by the April 30, 2002 deadline. (D.I. 280 at 5; D.I. 281 at P5)"
494,26," Objector also cites In re Rezulin Products Liability Litigation, 171 F. Supp. 2d 299 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), for the proposition that 
TPPs cannot collect damages for payments made on behalf of insureds. The case at bar can be distinguished from Rezulin, 
however, in that plaintiffs here allege economic injury due only to price overcharges, whereas the crux of the Rezulin claims was 
the marketing of a defective pharmaceutical product that caused physical injury or threat of physical injury to consumers."
494,27," See  In re Synthroid, 264 F.3d 712 at 717 (approving settlement including class of TPPs and noting that if TPPs had not been 
included in distribution they could have ""held back and sued [consumers] in subrogation.""). "
495,28," At least one court has applied the collateral source rule to allow a consumer class to pursue the full overcharge for brand 
name prescription drugs in an antitrust case, even though insurance companies paid all or some of the overcharge. See  Goda 
v. Abbott Laboratories, No. 01445-96, 1997 WL 156541 (D.C. Super. Ct. Feb. 3, 1997). "
496,29," The original request was for $ 835,882.84, but the reported expenses were subsequently reduced by $ 3500 when detailed 
expense records were submitted to the court. (See D.I. 256) "
497,30," The court ordered supplementation of the record and further responses by all parties in interest to make up for this deficiency. 
(D.I. 273)"
497,31," The court is not inclined to order yet another supplemented record, and while the court is not questioning whether the 
expenses were actually incurred, the court has no way of divining whether the time and effort reflected in the consolidated 
expense record submitted was significantly related to the result. "
498,32," Contrary to one objector's suggestion, the case at bar is not a ""megafund"" case that warrants significant downward departure 
from the typical 20-30% fee range. See, e.g., In re Prudential, 962 F. Supp. 450 at 585. "
507,*," The Honorable William J. Haynes, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Tennessee, sitting by designation. "
510,1," Neels also discussed a damages theory, termed ""loss of control,"" that sought to recapture damages sustained by Avery as a 
result of the fact that Avery no longer controlled the formulas and technologies. The idea is simple -- Avery is diminished "
511,," because FP can pass Avery secrets and technologies on to even more competitors. Neels did not place a specific monetary 
amount on this loss. FP argues that this brief discussion of ""loss of control"" allowed the jury to engage in open ended 
speculation as to the amount of damages. The theory was not pursued, however, except to the extent that Neels's reasonable 
royalty calculation took into account the open-ended nature of the hypothetical license agreement in determining a $ 73 million 
amount."
511,2," In relation to this argument, FP alleges that Avery did not state with specificity which trade secrets were misappropriated, or tie 
them to any FP products. They base this claim on the district court's statement that it was impossible to determine which items 
were found to be trade secrets. This is a misquotation of the record. The court denied Avery's Application for Injunctive Relief, 
filed after trial. In so doing, the court stated: ""It is certain from the Jury's Answers to Interrogatories and the General Verdict that 
Four Pillars or P.Y. Young made use of trade secrets, but it is uncertain which items specifically were found to be trade secrets."" 
In denying injunctive relief, therefore, the court merely admitted that it was unable to determine which trade secrets the jury had 
relied on in making their findings, not that Avery had made an insufficient showing of FP's use of stolen Avery technologies. "
520,1," HN1[
] These facts, which are derived from the complaint, must be taken to be true because the case was dismissed on the 
pleadings for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. United States v. One 1997 Mercedes E420, 175 F.3d 1129, 1131 n. 
1 (9th Cir. 1999)."
520,2," The complaint also alleged a mail fraud RICO predicate in sending forms falsely verifying employment eligibility to the 
government. In a ruling that has not been appealed, the district court held that the mail fraud scheme did not provide an 
adequate RICO predicate act because the employees were not the party defrauded."
520,3," The district court ""remanded"" the remaining state law claims against the growers. As the parties acknowledge, dismissal, not 
remand, was called for because this suit was originally brought in federal court. See 28 U.S.C. § 1447. "
522,4," The growers suggest that the employees would have to show a ""property right"" in the lost wages, by showing that they were 
promised or contracted for higher wages. This argument is misplaced in the context of RICO. This case does not implicate 
procedural due process; rather, what is required is precisely what the employees allege here: a legal entitlement to business 
relations unhampered by schemes prohibited by the RICO predicate statutes. 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c), 1961(1); Dumas v. Major 
League Baseball Prop., 104 F. Supp. 2d 1220, 1222 (S.D. Cal. 2000), aff'd sub nom. Chaset v. Fleer/Skybox Int'l, LP, 300 F.3d

525,5," The statute restricts supplemental jurisdiction in certain cases where the underlying basis for federal jurisdiction is diversity. 28 
U.S.C. § 1367(b). This provision is not at issue in this case, which rests on federal question jurisdiction. "
538,1," While the Parties appear to be in some disagreement as to the correspondence of Cablevision's ten ""claims"" to the ""counts"" 
enumerated in the Complaint (Def.'s Mem. Law at 12-14; Pl.'s Mem. Law at 3-4), for the purposes of clarity and simplicity, this 
Court will refer to the Counts alleged rather than the Claims enumerated by Defendant."

] The definition of the relevant market involves the specification of its dimensions, specifically, its product, 
geographic and time dimensions. 2 Earl W. Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law § 12.2 (1980). The Second Circuit has

monopolize as ""the employment of methods, means and practices which would, if successful, accomplish 
monopolization, and which, though falling short, nevertheless approach so close as to create a dangerous probability 
of it""). "

competitors.""  Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 596, n. 20, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 
2847 (1985)."
544,11," Cablevision asserts that YES' phrasing that it has suffered harm to reputation is not a cognizable antitrust injury. 
That may be so, but other claims in the complaint sufficiently allege that YES complains of being forced out of 
business and/or of being unable to compete for the purchase of broadcast rights. See Compl. PP9,10,124-26. "
547,12," While the Court has found that the allegations in the Complaint, taken as a whole, describe conduct that support 
standing for an antitrust claim under a number of theories, as discussed supra and infra, the Court is cognizant of 
Defendant's point that there is no separate Count for an attempted monopolization or monopoly leveraging of the 
market for the sale of advertising. For the purposes of clarity, Plaintiff, should it decide to pursue such a claim, shall 
file an amended complaint which explicitly sets all surviving claims pursuant to this Opinion, out in separate Counts. In 
amending, Plaintiff should also be cognizant of the Second Circuit's admonition in Law Offices of Curtis Trinko that 
monopoly leveraging claims are distinct from attempted monopolization claims,  294 F.3d at 326 n.13, and should state 
its claims clearly and succinctly so that Defendant may answer them as such. In answering, Defendants should 
correlate its responses to Plaintiff's enumerated Counts."
547,13," HN31[
] The Second Circuit has stated that essential facilities include: ""'facilities that are a natural monopoly, 
facilities whose duplication is forbidden by law, and perhaps those that are publicly subsidized and thus could not 
practicably be built privately.' Most of the successful essential facility claims fall within [these] categories… In cases 
finding liability in other categories, however, the facility in question was more than dominant; it was effectively the only "
548,," one in town.""  Twin Labs, Inc. v. Weider Health & Fitness, 900 F.2d 566, 569 (2d Cir. 1990)(quoting Areeda & 
Hovenkamp, P736.2 (Supp. 1998))."
548,14," While the Supreme Court, unlike the Tenth Circuit, did not rely on the essential facilities doctrine, the case is 
concerned with a vertical integration and is often cited in lower court cases involving alleged essential facilities. See, 
e.g., Areeda & Hovenkamp, § 772c at 182."
548,15," The Court is aware of the intent behind the leased access provisions,  47 U.S.C. § 532 (2002) where: ""Leased access 
is aimed at assuring that cable channels are available to enable program suppliers to furnish programming when the 
cable operator may elect not to provide that service as part of the program offerings he makes available to 
subscribers."" S.Rep.No. 102-92, at 29 (quoting H.R.Rep.No. 98-934, at 47 (1984)). Nevertheless, the key question 
remains whether forcing YES to lease a system for which Cablevision pays its affiliates constitutes a competitive injury 
accompanied by high entry barriers such that competition in the marketplace is impaired. Absent such impairment, it 
could very well be that YES is simply an unintegrated rival whose injury reflects nothing more than Cablevision's ability 
to reduce its costs without the concomitant injury to competition. However, for the purposes of this motion, YES' 
allegation that Cablevision has refused to deal in terms which are reasonable in order to keep its monopolistic position 
from eroding is taken as true . "
549,16," Simply re-characterizing YES' attempted access claim as an attempt to sell a service cannot result in a dismissal 
where YES' allegations meet the threshold requirements under the essential facilities doctrine and YES is entitled to all 
facts construed in its favor at this juncture. That is not to say, however, that the record at summary judgment would not 
permit this Court to find the essential facilities doctrine unavailable because the distribution system cannot be fairly 
characterized as a ""facility"" or where the mode of access offered by Cablevision is not so patently unreasonable by 
industry standards to constitute a ""denial."""
549,17," Defendant relies on  Paladin Assocs., Inc. v. Montana Power Co., 97 F. Supp. 2d 1013, 1038 (D.Mont. 2000) for the 
proposition that the essential facilities doctrine is unavailable to a plaintiff seeking ""preferential treatment"" over its 
competitors. Paladin, however, found simply, after discovery was conducted, that plaintiff failed to sustain a ""denial to 
facility"" claim since it was engaged in an active contract with defendant, though on terms not to its liking.  Id. at 1038. 
Those facts are clearly not mirrored here, where plaintiff alleges a denial associated with Cablevision's status as a 
vertically integrated monopolist in the cable distribution market. Further, Paladin is of limited value because it involved 
a combination in restraint of trade, not single firm conduct. As such, HN36[
] Sherman Act ramifications are quite 
different for combinations versus individuals. See  Copperweld, 467 U.S. 752 at 767-69, 774-77, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. 
Ct. 2731 (while a combination may be liable for effecting a mere restraint of trade, for a single firm to be liable there 
generally must be either monopolization or the threat of monopolization)."
549,18," Proof of a tying arrangement generally requires evidence that the supplier's sale of the tying product is conditioned 
upon the unwilling purchase of the tied product from the supplier or an unwilling promise not to purchase the tied 
product from any other supplier. See, e.g.,  Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. 2 at 12, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (""The 
essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying 
product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did not want at all, or might have 
preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms."");  Wells Real Estate, 850 F.2d 803 at 814 (""Tying arrangements 
involve the use of leverage over the market for one product … to coerce purchases of a second product….""). "
550,19," Comparisons of the instant matter to the other cases cited by Defendant are misplaced. 3  Penny Theater Corp. v. 
Plitt Theatres, Inc., 1985 WL 5138, at *1 (N.D.Ill. November 25, 1985), struck almost 30-year-old antitrust convictions, 
where the Plaintiff admitted it was relevant to the claims only to establish defendants' 'corporate character'.  Tivoli 
Realty v. Paramount Pictures, 80 F. Supp. 800, 804 (D.C.Del. 1948), struck a paragraph in the Complaint alleging the 
violation of another judicial decree as immaterial, but denied the striking request as to paragraphs which ""furnished 
background material as to the nature, extent and character of the alleged conspiracy.""  In re Potash, 1994 WL 1108312 
at *6 (D.Minn. 1994) found that any potential relevance of the allegations of decades-old previous misconduct was 
substantially outweighed by their likelihood for prejudice. Further, the Potash Court declined to strike a description of 
conduct which was in close proximity to the Plaintiff's claims and ""provided a setting for the events which, the 
Plaintiffs contend, spawned the conduct that they assert as unlawful."" Id. at *7. "
551,20," YES' vague and conclusory allegation of coercion as to some ""national non-networked advertising cooperative"" is a 
wholly insufficient basis for a Donnelly Act claim."
551,21," YES alleges: ""Cablevision has owned a majority interest in FSNY for many years; in 1995, after several years of effort, 
Cablevision acquired a 50% interest in MSG, and acquired a controlling interest in 1997"" Compl. P7."

569,12," In some cases, the courts held that common questions predominated, and that class actions therefore were permissible. See 
In re Flat Glass, 191 F.R.D. 472 (W.D. Pa. 1999); In re Sugar Indus. Antitrust Litig., 73 F.R.D. 322 (E.D. Pa. 1976); Hedges

In re Glassine & Greaseproof Paper Antitrust Litig., 88 F.R.D. 302 (E.D. Pa. 1980). On the other hand, other Third Circuit District 
Court cases have expressed the view that questions relating to fraudulent concealment in antitrust class actions do not present 
sufficiently common issues as to permit class action treatment. See Chevalier v. Baird Sav. Ass'n, 72 F.R.D. 140 (E.D. Pa. 
1976); In re Anthracite Coal Antitrust Litig., 78 F.R.D. 709 (M.D. Pa. 1978); Wolfson v. Artisans Sav. Bank, 83 F.R.D. 547 (D. 
Del. 1979); Susquehanna v. H & M, Inc., 98 F.R.D. 658 (M.D. Pa. 1983). "
570,13," Appellants introduced evidence that ""each of the five named plaintiffs stands in a unique position with respect to fraudulent 
concealment that will have to be individually adjudicated if that plaintiff is to recover."" International Paper Appellant's Brief at 46. 
They refer to Lisa Garrett, president of Garrett Paper, who testified that she was ""sure"" that something illegal was afoot when 
Garrett Paper's prices for corrugated boxes increased during the alleged class period, that she ""plain as day told [her] salesman 
that"" Appellants were fixing prices, and that she knew such activity was illegal. International Paper Appellant's Brief at 46-47. Similarly, Appellants contend that Appellee Oak Valley was also aware of the price increases and allegedly told Stone Container 
that ""you'd better lower your box prices,"" though Oak Valley is uncertain whether that conversation took place during the class 
period. International Paper Appellant's Brief at 47. They emphasize that Oak Valley testified that it ""accepted the increases in the 
matter of course and never really questioned it."" Id. They assert also that although Local Baking now says it had no knowledge 
during the alleged class period of changes in the average market price for corrugated products, or of any downtime taken by 
linerboard manufacturers, Local Baking has testified that it was told by Appellant Stone Container that prices were increasing 
because of a decrease in linerboard. They refer to the testimony of David Halper, president of Alfred I. Halper Corrugated Box 
Co., Inc., who testified that he was aware of the increased prices that Appellants had charged Halper during the class period, 
and that he had even complained to Appellants about the increases. Appellants argue that Halper has no greater knowledge 
today about the existence of a conspiracy than he did during the alleged class period. Finally, they note that General Refractories sold all of its operating assets in 1994, in the middle of the class period and years 
before any complaint was ever filed in this case. They state that there were no communications, other than invoices, between 
Appellants and General Refractories during the class period, and that General Refractories could not identify any facts 
discovered after the class period that led to filing its complaint, and in particular none that led to the naming of entities other than 
Stone Container as defendants. International Paper Appellant's Brief at 48-49. And, in contrast to Garrett Paper and Halper, 
Appellants contend that General Refractories does not appear to have had any suspicion of wrongdoing during the alleged class 
period based on price increases for corrugated sheets. It is Appellants' case that the factual complexities relating to these five named plaintiffs underscores the inherently individualized 
nature of a fraudulent concealment analysis. Appellants insist that the named Appellees would have to prove, among other 
things: (1) that Garrett Paper's conceded awareness of alleged illegality does not qualify as actual ""discovery;"" (2) that Garrett 
Paper's considered inaction in the face of such awareness qualifies as ""due diligence;"" (3) that Garrett Paper's asserted small 
size excuses its inaction; (4) that none of the other named Appellees knew or had reason to know about the alleged illegality in 
the exercise of due diligence, even though some of them complained about the price increases whereas others were not even 
aware of those increases; (5) that something was ""fraudulently concealed"" from all putative class members, even though some 
of them have conceded that they are aware of no more incriminating facts now than they were during the alleged conspiracy; (6) 
that unique relationships do not affect the due-diligence inquiry; (7) that named Appellees who claimed not to have known of 
Stone Container's downtime exercised ""due"" diligence, when such downtime was widely publicized in the industry at the time; (8) 
that General Refractories, which went out of business in the middle of the class period, is held to a due-diligence standard even 
after that point; and (9) that alleged oral misrepresentations made to some named Appellees but not others, regarding the 
reasons for the price increases does not affect the due-diligence analysis. Id. at 49-50. "
571,14," See, e.g., Abramovitz v. Ahern, 96 F.R.D. 208, 218 (D. Conn. 1982) (issue of whether fraudulent concealment would toll the 
statute of limitations was common to all class members); In re Plywood Antitrust Litig., 76 F.R.D. 570, 586 (E.D. La. 1976) 
(""fraudulent concealment issues appear to be generally common to all members in each class""); In re Sugar, 73 F.R.D. at 348; 
In re Fine Paper, 82 F.R.D. at 154-155 (""The key question on the issue of fraudulent concealment will relate to whether 
defendants successfully concealed the existence of the alleged conspiracy, and the proof of this contention [what defendants 
did] will necessarily be common among the class members.""). "
575,1," Hundreds of state and federal cases, too numerous to mention, have Cited Illinois Brick. "
576,2," Comes, in a footnote, refers to In re Microsoft Corporation Antitrust Litigation, 127 F. Supp. 2d 702 (D. Md. 2001). That decision 
held the plaintiffs as indirect purchasers were barred from bringing claims for alleged overcharges under federal law, pursuant to 
Illinois Brick, but reserved comment on whether Illinois Brick was incorporated into the state law of a number of states. "
578,1," Under Illinois Brick, indirect purchasers lack standing to proceed. The rationale behind the rule, as explained by the United 
States Supreme Court, is that ""the direct purchaser rule serves, in part, to eliminate the complications of apportioning 
overcharges between direct and indirect purchasers."" Kansas v. UtiliCorp United, Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 208, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 
L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990). It also ""serves to eliminate multiple recoveries."" Id., at 497 U.S. 199, 212, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169, 110 S. Ct. 
2807. Finally, the rule provides the direct purchasers, those in the best position to observe an alleged violator's conduct, with 
incentives to bring private antitrust actions and thus promotes the vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws. Id. at 214-215. The 
Court recognizes that its decision in Illinois Brick often denies relief to consumers who have paid inflated prices because of their 
status as indirect purchasers. Utilicorp, 497 U.S. at 211-212. "
589,*," The Honorable Jane A. Restani, Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation."
589,1," IATA was founded in 1945 by the then-major global airlines, with the goals of promoting international air transportation and 
providing a means for collaboration. Section 412(b) of the Federal Aviation Act required the Civil Aeronautics Board to approve 
any agreement by air carriers it did not find ""adverse to the public interest"" or ""in violation of the act."" See Federal Aviation Act of 
1958, 49 U.S.C. § 1382, amended by International Air Transportation Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-192, 94 Stat. 35 (1979); see 
also CAB Order 80-4-113, Apr. 15, 1980 (describing the statute). In addition, § 414 of the Federal Aviation Act required the CAB 
to immunize from the antitrust laws transactions specifically approved or necessarily contemplated by an order of approval under 
§ 412, provided such immunity was found to be required in the public interest. Id. Before the passage of the Airline Deregulation 
Act of 1978, such immunity attached automatically under § 414 upon approval. Id. The CAB approved the organization of IATA in 1946 and granted indefinite approval to the IATA in 1955, after several one-year 
temporary approvals. IATA Traffic Conference Resolution, 6 CAB 639 (1945); CAB Order E-9305, June 15, 1955. Prior to 1979, 
agreements affecting foreign air transportation were approved and immunized by the CAB under broad public interest standards. 
After the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act, IATA amended its agreement, replacing its ""Provisions for the Conduct of the 
IATA Traffic Conferences."" See CAB Order 80-4-113 (describing the amendment). The government has continued, more recently in the form of the Department of Transportation, to exercise regulatory oversight 
over the Provisions for the Operation of IATA Traffic Conferences. See generally DOT Order 88-3-67, Mar. 31, 1988. "
591,2," HN4[
]  15 U.S.C. § 4 provides, ""The several district courts of the United States are invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of [the Sherman Act]."""
591,3," As the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has observed, ""The federal courts have generally disagreed as to the 
extraterritorial reach of the antitrust laws . . . . However, as far as this appeal is concerned, our work is simplified by Congress' 
passage in 1982 of the FTAIA, which specifically exempts certain foreign conduct from the antitrust laws."" Statoil, 241 F.3d at 
423-24. "
592,4," HN7[
] Challenges to subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) may be ""facial"" or ""factual."" Facial attacks, like this one, contest the sufficiency of the pleadings, and the trial court must accept the complaint's allegations as true. NE Hub Partners, L.P. 
v. CNG Transmission Corp., 239 F.3d 333, 341 & n.7 (3d Cir. 2001). In contrast, a trial court considering a factual attack accords 
plaintiff's allegations no presumption of truth. In a factual attack, the court must weigh the evidence relating to jurisdiction, with 
discretion to allow affidavits, documents, and even limited evidentiary hearings. Accord Garcia v. Copenhaver, Bell & Assocs., 
104 F.3d 1256, 1260-61 (11th Cir. 1997); Ohio Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 922 F.2d 320, 325 (6th Cir. 1990); Oaxaca v. 
Roscoe, 641 F.2d 386, 391 (5th Cir. 1981). In Cestonaro v. United States, 211 F.3d 749 (3d Cir. 2000), we said, ""Because the 
government's challenge to the District Court's jurisdiction was a factual one under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), we are not confined 
to the allegations in the complaint (nor was the District Court) and can look beyond the pleadings to decide factual matters 
relating to jurisdiction."" Id. at 752 (citation omitted). "
593,5," Whether plaintiffs are United States citizens is irrelevant to our inquiry. 15 U.S.C. § 15 (""Suits by persons injured"") provides 
jurisdiction for damage claims brought by ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything 
forbidden in the antitrust laws . . . ."" Id. The legislative history of the Export Trading Company Act states, ""Foreign purchasers 
should enjoy the protection of our antitrust laws in the domestic marketplace, just as our citizens do. Indeed, to deny them this 
protection could violate the Friendship, Commerce and Navigation treaties this country has entered into with a number of foreign 
nations."" H.R. REP. NO. 97-686, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2495. And in Pfizer, Inc. v. India, 434 U.S. 308, 54 L. Ed. 2d 
563, 98 S. Ct. 584 (1978), the Supreme Court held that allowing foreign plaintiffs to enforce United States antitrust laws helped 
compensate victims while deterring future violations. Id. at 314-15."
593,6," Plaintiffs contend the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act's principal purpose was to reduce the growing United States 
trade deficit. For this reason, they suggest the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act does not bar their suit because their 
claim involves neither ""export"" nor ""wholly foreign"" commerce, the only types of activity covered by the statutory language. 
Because defendants, United States companies, allegedly colluded within the United States to fix prices paid in United States 
dollars, plaintiffs maintain the conduct at issue cannot be described as ""export commerce"" or ""wholly foreign commerce."" We disagree. Shreds of the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act's legislative history can be interpreted as supporting 
plaintiffs' argument relating to the statute's purpose. E.g., H.R. REP. NO. 97-686, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2499 
(employing the ""export or purely foreign commerce"" language. But as noted, the legislative history contains other justifications 
for the Act as well. E.g., id., reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2494 (noting the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act's 
""promotion of certainty in assessing the applicability of American antitrust law to international business transactions and 
proposed transactions""). It would therefore appear that the text of the Act demonstrates more than one purpose. More 
importantly, the Supreme Court has held that HN10[
] ""absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, 
[statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive."" Escondido Mut. Water Co. v. La Jolla, Rincon, San Pasqual, 
Pauma & Pala Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765, 772, 80 L. Ed. 2d 753, 104 S. Ct. 2105 (1984) (quotation and citations 
omitted). HN11[
] The plain language of the statute does not limit its scope to ""export"" or ""wholly foreign"" commerce. Instead, it 
addresses whether defendants' conduct ""involves trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign 
nations."" 15 U.S.C. § 6a. We must, of course, apply the plain text of the statute. "
594,7," Of course, the conduct need not necessarily be one or the other."
594,8," Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate commerce and 
""commerce with foreign nations."""
594,9," Moreover, plaintiffs' argument is undermined by their pleadings. Section One of the Sherman Act, on which plaintiffs base their 
claims, prohibits ""trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. The complaint does not 
allege trade or commerce ""among the several States."" Therefore, to be cognizable, plaintiffs' allegations must depict a restraint 
of ""trade or commerce with foreign nations."" Plaintiffs cannot argue their allegations do not encompass ""trade or commerce . . . 
with foreign nations"" for Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act purposes without sacrificing their ultimate statutory claim 
under the Sherman Act."
594,10," Plaintiffs contend our holding in Carpet Group established a general rule that if defendants' alleged conduct is ""based"" in the 
United States, the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act is no bar to federal antitrust jurisdiction. But Carpet Group provides "
595,," no such bright line. In Carpet Group the defendants' ""import"" activity was clear: ""Plaintiffs charge that Defendants engaged in a 
course of activity designed to ensure that only United States importers, and not United States retailers, could bring oriental rugs 
manufactured abroad into the stream of American commerce."" 227 F.3d at 72. To that extent, the facts of Carpet Group are 
clearly distinguishable."
595,11," As noted, 15 U.S.C. § 6a provides:""[The Sherman Act] shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than 
import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations unless . . . ."" "
596,12," The Supreme Court's opinion in Pfizer does not alter our analysis, because it preceded the enactment of the Foreign Trade 
Antitrust Improvements Act by four years. Moreover, the holding in Pfizer is cabined to the question of whether a foreign 
government qualified as a ""person"" under the Sherman Act. 434 U.S. at 320 (holding ""that a foreign nation otherwise entitled to 
sue in our courts is entitled to sue for treble damages under the antitrust laws to the same extent as any other plaintiff"")."
596,13," To reiterate, while the analysis of the ""trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations"" 
prong focuses exclusively on defendants' conduct, the analysis of the ""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable"" prong 
focuses exclusively on the geographical effect of defendants' conduct. "
597,14," The Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act's legislative history provides, ""The full committee added language to the 
Sherman and FTC Act amendments to require that the 'effect' providing the jurisdictional nexus must also be the basis for the 
injury alleged under the antitrust laws."" H.R. REP. NO. 97-686, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2496-97."
597,15," The travel agents were permanently located outside the United States, where they performed services for travelers based in 
their countries and elsewhere, including the United States. In this sense, the facts here are distinguishable from those described 
in the dissenting opinion in Statoil: ""The claim is that defendants allocated the market for hundreds of millions of dollars of 
commerce -- an allegation that placed United States markets at the mercy of monopoly charges in an industry vital to national 
security. The charged conspiracy was no foreign cabal whose secondary effects only lapped at United States shores."" 241 F.3d 
at 431 (Higginbotham, J., dissenting). "
598,16," For this reason, undoubtedly, the issue has not been extensively briefed by the parties. "
606,*," The Honorable David K. Winder, Senior District Judge, United States District Court for the District of Utah, sitting by 
designation. "
607,1," According to one witness, early termination fees could be as high as $ 7,200 on a location that might be paying the location 
owner only about $ 200 a year in commissions."
607,2," By way of further example, many of Southwestern Bell's contracts called for a 50% reduction in the commissions payable by 
Southwestern Bell to the location owner if the location owner allowed competitive pay phones on its location alongside 
Southwestern Bell's pay phones. This was tantamount to precluding competitive pay phones because, in the unlikely event that 
the additional phones would increase total revenues for that location (there was evidence that Southwestern Bell would usually 
already have placed the optimal number of phones at a given location), the location owner would receive a much smaller 
percentage of those revenues. The damage Southwestern Bell did to the property when withdrawing its phones also made the 
property less attractive to providers of competitive pay phones. "
611,3," The contracts themselves do not establish whether Southwestern Bell is more properly viewed as the buyer or seller, providing 
simply that the location owner, in exchange for prescribed commission payments, ""hereby grants SWBT the right to install and 
maintain SWBT public pay telephone(s) and associated equipment . . . at the location specified herein,"" and that the phone 
remains the property of Southwestern Bell during the contract period."
611,4," HN9[
] ""Monopsony"" is a ""condition of the market in which there is but one buyer for a particular commodity."" Black's Law 
Dictionary 1007 (6th ed. 1990)."
611,5," As stated earlier, at least on this record, the Plaintiffs have not yet demonstrated that cell phones and pay phones are not 
reasonably interchangeable at the end-user level. "
615,6," Southwestern Bell's challenges to the other aspects of Chamberlain's testimony fall flat, as the only testimony potentially 
problematic under Noerr-Pennington - the fact that Southwestern Bell opposed the fresh look proposal - was elicited by 
Southwestern Bell during cross-examination. See Whiteley v. OKC Corp., 719 F.2d 1051, 1055 (10th Cir. 1983). "
616,7," Cf. Central Telecomm., Inc. v. TCI Cablevision, Inc., 800 F.2d 711 (8th Cir. 1986), where the Eighth Circuit rejected a cable 
provider's argument that ""as a matter of law, it could not have possessed monopoly power because [the municipality] regulated 
price and entry in the cable television business."" Id. at 726. The court recognized that TCI had the power to raise the price of 
premium channels without the approval of the municipality and that it ""used its entrenched position and . . . various unethical or 
illegal practices . . . to exclude competition."" Id. Of course, in the case before us, Southwestern Bell cannot even claim that its 
long-term contracts with coercive terms and its anti-competitive ""Blitz"" were regulated, or even known, by the OCC. "
618,8," Southwestern Bell cites Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 885 F.2d 683 (10th Cir. 1989), as support, but 
that case by no means forecloses the consideration of contractual activity in determining monopoly liability. In Colorado 
Interstate Gas, the potential monopolist's market power derived solely from a contract with a fixed expiration date, and the court 
found this to be an insufficient basis for monopoly liability under the circumstances in light of ""the certainty that the market will 
return to the status quo at a predetermined date and the fact that [the alleged monopolist] has no power to prevent the erosion of 
its market share."" Id. at 697 n.24. By contrast, Southwestern Bell's liability was based on a whole system of contracts with 
exclusionary terms (including provisions that the district court found could cause many of them, in fact, to last forever), as well as 
an abundance of other anti-competitive conduct. "
620,9, All outstanding motions are denied.
620,1," Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 79, § 203 provides in pertinent part: A. Every act, agreement, contract, or combination in the form of a trust, or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or 
commerce within this state is hereby declared to be against public policy and illegal. B. It is unlawful for any person to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or 
commerce in a relevant market within this state. . . . . D. As used in this section:"
620,1," . ""Monopolize"" means: a. the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, and b. the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power by exclusionary conduct as distinguished from growth or development 
as a consequence of a superior product and/or service, business acumen, or historic accident;"
620,2," . ""Monopoly power"" means the power to control market prices or exclude competition; . . . . "
621,," See also Harolds Stores, Inc. v. Dillard Dep't Stores, Inc., 82 F.3d 1533, 1543-44 (10th Cir. 1996) (discussing elements of 
restraint of trade in Oklahoma)."
621,2," In defining the relevant product market as a matter of law, the district court effectively rejected SWBT's contention that it should 
be evaluated at the level of the end users. This legal ruling is before us. See Ruyle v. Continental Oil Co., 44 F.3d 837, 841 (10th 
Cir. 1994). "
623,3," Okla. Const. art. 9, § 18 provides in part: The Commission shall have the power and authority and be charged with the duty of supervising, regulating and controlling 
all transportation and transmission companies doing business in this State, in all matters relating to the performance of their 
public duties and their charges therefor, and of correcting abuses and preventing unjust discrimination and extortion by 
such companies; and to that end the Commission shall, from time to time, prescribe and enforce against such companies, 
in the manner hereinafter authorized, such rates, charges, classifications of traffic, and rules and regulations, and shall 
require them to establish and maintain all such public service, facilities, and conveniences as may be reasonable and just, 
which said rates, charges, classifications, rules, regulations, and requirements, the Commission may, from time to time, 
alter or amend. "
624,4," The Plaintiffs argue that this transcript should be stricken as it was not before the district court. See United States v. Kennedy, 
225 F.3d 1187, 1190-91 (10th Cir. 2000). I would grant SWBT's motion to supplement the record pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 
10(e)(2)(C), because the substance of Mr. Chamberlain's comments is contained in his testimony before the district court, Aplt. 
App. 4622, and the payphone regulatory system in Oklahoma was always an issue in this case. Further, given that the district 
court held that the state-action doctrine did not apply, inclusion of this transcript in no way results in the appellate court deciding 
an issue with evidence that might have made a difference to the district court. "
629,1, IVAX recently settled with the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs. 
630,2, Direct purchasers are those entities that purchased terazosin principally for resale.
630,3," Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), this Court certified its December 13, 2000 Order for review by the Eleventh Circuit, which 
subsequently accepted the appeal. As of this date, there has been no ruling from the Eleventh Circuit."
630,4," Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f), this matter is also pending before the Eleventh Circuit."
630,5," Specifically, the Court dismissed those claims brought under the laws of: Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, New 
Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia."
630,6," In a footnote, Defendants also challenge the standing of named Plaintiffs Clarence Reid, who purchased Hytrin in the District of 
Columbia during the relevant time period, and David Grund, who purchased Hytrin in Maine during the relevant time period. 
(Defs.' Memorandum at 7, n. 6). Essentially, Defendants argue that these two individuals do not adequately represent the entire 
end payers class in their respective states and thus Plaintiffs' claims in those states should be dismissed. Realizing, however, "
631,," that such an argument is more appropriately addressed on a motion for class certification, Defendants abandon this argument in 
their reply memorandum. (Defs.' Reply Memorandum, Ex. B). Accordingly, the Maine and District of Columbia claims remain."
631,7," Plaintiffs indicate in their Response that they are withdrawing their New York claim based on N.Y. Gen. Bus. L. § 349. 
(Plaintiffs' Memorandum in Opposition at 20, n. 12). Accordingly, that claim will be dismissed with prejudice."
631,8, Those claims brought under Arizona law were dismissed with prejudice on other grounds.
631,9, UWSI is now known as Cobalt Corporation. 
632,10," It is worth noting that with respect to standing requirements in general, the required showing depends on the stage of the 
litigation at which the standing issue is being decided. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. 
Ed. 2d 351(1992). ""At the pleading stage, general factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant's conduct may suffice, 
for on a motion to dismiss we presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the 
claim."" Id. at 561. Similarly, many of Defendants' substantive arguments with respect to UWSI' s adequacy as a named Plaintiff 
and whether its claims are typical of those of the class are more appropriately raised in response to Plaintiffs' already filed 
motions for class certification."
632,11," Alabama's antitrust law applies only to conduct that is completely intrastate in nature. See Abbott Labs. v. Durrett, 746 So. 2d 
316, 329 (Ala. 1999). In Illinois, an antitrust class action on behalf of indirect purchasers may only be brought by the Attorney 
General. See 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/7(2) (2002); see also Gaebler v. New Mexico Potash Corp., 285 Ill. App. 3d 542, 676 
N.E.2d 228, 230, 221 Ill. Dec. 707 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996). "
633,12," For the reasons stated above in section III(D), Plaintiffs' Nevada unjust enrichment claim remains. "
638,1," Nothing, however, prevents an individual or firm from offering these same services to these businesses independent of NU's 
Small Business Program. "
640,2," Defendants note that by distinguishing between NU C/A services and non-NU C/A services ""Plaintiffs have argued themselves 
out of the realm of antitrust law altogether."" If customers of the Small Business Program would not purchase conservation 
services unless the services were free, then there exists in reality no market for such services and no opportunity to create a 
monopoly. "

650,5," We note that the defendant claims that the existence of such exclusivity provisions was not established by the evidence 
presented at the hearing. "
652,6," Both of the parties and the trial court treated the probable cause standard for evaluating an alleged cause of action set forth in 
Berger v. Cuomo, supra, 230 Conn. at 1, as the applicable standard in this case. Accordingly, we leave for another day the 
questions of whether (1) the standards governing equitable bills of discovery also govern petitions filed pursuant to § 52-156a; 
see Cadle Co. v. Drubner, 64 Conn. App. 69, 777 A.2d 1286 (2001)  [***15] (applying Berger standards to § 52-156a petition); 
and (2) the probable cause language in Berger was an unduly constricted interpretation of our prior jurisprudence governing bills 
of discovery. See Aetna Life & Casualty Co. v. Union Trust Co., 230 Conn. 779, 788 n.5, 646 A.2d 799 (1994) (HN8[
] when 
parties have not briefed or argued law that could affect case, ""we decide [the] case on the basis on which it was tried and 
decided in the trial court, and briefed and argued in this court"")."
652,7," Both parties agree that the evidentiary standard for determining whether unchallenged factual findings support the granting of a 
bill of discovery is whether the findings  [***18] constitute probable cause to believe that the plaintiff has a cause of action 
against the defendant. See footnote 6 of this opinion. The parties do not address, however, the question of what is the proper 
evidentiary standard for evaluating disputed factual findings. "
654,8, See footnotes 2 and 3 of this opinion for the text of those statutes. 
655,9," General Statutes § 35-44b provides: HN16[
] ""It is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-
46, inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."" "
658,10," As we have noted, the only injury claimed by the plaintiff is that the inability to publish the eleven Sunday comic strips at issue 
may make its planned weekend edition less competitive than it otherwise would have been. "
660,1," I discuss later in this opinion my disagreement with the majority regarding the quantum of proof necessary to meet the probable 
cause standard for the issuance of a bill of discovery. "
661,2," Although we did not expound upon our suggestion in Pottetti that a party seeking to sustain  [***52] a bill of discovery and relief 
bears a greater burden than one who utilizes a pure bill of discovery, the reasoning behind such a distinction is obvious. As 
previously indicated, a bill of discovery and relief goes beyond an informational request and requires the court to resolve a 
party's substantive claims. Because, in that circumstance, the function of the court does not end upon disposition of the pure 
discovery request, but rather continues through a consideration of the merits of the case, it makes sense to require the court to 
determine, at the outset, whether there exists probable cause to support the various elements of the causes of action alleged. 
When dealing with a pure bill of discovery, however, the court's only function is to pass upon the necessity of a party's 
informational request. Imposition of the more stringent probable cause standard articulated in Berger is thus improper in such a 
case because the underlying claims are not before the court for disposition on the merits, as are the claims in a proceeding on a 
bill of discovery and relief. "
667,1," Defendants in this action are Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, Columbia Pictures Industries Inc., Dreamworks Distribution 
L.L.C., Lions Gate Films Inc., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Distribution Co., Miramax Film Corp., New Line Cinema Corp., Paramount 
Pictures Corp., Sony Pictures Releasing Corp., Universal Firm Exchanges Inc., Warner Bros. Distributing, and USA Films L.L.C. "
669,2," The record does not suggest that the Distributors prefer clearances over the York Square, but rather that clearances are a 
required condition of the Showcases' bids to license certain movies available through the Distributors; the Distributors apparently 
acquiesce to the Showcases' demands for clearances. These circumstances certainly affect the degree of unfairness of 
Distributors' actions, but do not eliminate the possibility of CUTPA liability against the present defendants. "
670,3," Plaintiff's exhibits are numbered according to the tab number they appear after in Plaintiff's Exhibits and Declarations in 
Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. At times these numbers differ from the number listed for the same 
exhibit in Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment."
670,4," The Distributors cite evidence that both the York Square and the Showcases advertise in the New Haven Register newspaper 
as support for the proposition that the cinemas draw from the same, greater New Haven market. The Register also includes 
listings for movie theaters throughout Connecticut and carries ads for movie theaters in Fairfield County. Additionally, both the 
Showcases and the York Square list show times in the Connecticut Post, a newspaper with a readership drawn primarily from 
Fairfield County. Evidence of ad placement in the same Connecticut papers provides little, if any, support for the Distributors' 
contentions that the York Square and Showcases serve the same geographic market and that they are in substantial 
competition. "
671,5," The Distributors cite, inter allia, Computer Assocs. Int'l v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693, 716 (2d Cir. 1992); Harper & Row, 
Publishers v. Nation Enters., 723 F.2d 195, 200 (2d Cir. 1983); Titan Sports v. Turner Broadcasting Systems, 981 F. Supp.

673,**," After an examination of the briefs and the record in Nos. 01-3229 and 01-3230, we have concluded that oral argument is 
unnecessary. Thus, those appeals are submitted on the briefs and the record. See FED. R. APP. P. 34(a)(2)."
673,*," For purposes of this opinion we are using the current name of the bank, which is JPMorgan Chase & Co. That entity includes 
both J.P. Morgan & Co., Inc., and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York. "
687,***," The fact that the defendants were hoping to profit in the physical market, ultimately, through their manipulation of the separate 
futures market, also has implications for their arguments related to the so-called ""umbrella standing"" theory. The defendants 
object to the possibility that they might be held responsible for higher copper prices throughout the physical market, rather than 
just for the sales they made. If this were an ordinary cartel case, in which cartel members A and B sell to customers X and Y, 
and then non-cartel member firm C makes sales at or near the enhanced cartel price to customer Z, the question arises whether 
A and B are liable to Z for the overcharges it paid. See generally, ABA Section of Antitrust Law, 1 Antitrust Developments 
(Fourth) at 778-79 & n. 128 (1997) (collecting cases on umbrella standing). Here, however, we have a conspiracy to rig prices 
for the entire physical market, accomplished through manipulation of the Comex futures market. Another possible analogy might 
be to rigging product standards, which affects everyone who tries to participate in a particular product market. In the latter case, 
the defendants who manipulated the standards cannot be heard to complain that they should be immune from damages for a 
product they did not sell. We leave this issue open for further exploration at the district court level, now that we have clarified 
how the direct purchaser rule and the remoteness doctrine of AGC apply here. "
704,1," The court expresses no views on whether the oral statements alleged in Paragraph 27(1)(3) are actionable in themselves. See 
Medical Graphics Corp. v. SensorMedics Corp., 872 F. Supp. 643, 650 (D. Minn. 1994) (plaintiff unlikely to prevail on claims 
based on alleged oral statements to one customer); American Needle & Novelty, Inc. v. Drew Pearson Mktg., Inc., 820 F. Supp. 
1072, 1077-78 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (dismissing claim based on single letter). "
705,2," Compare practices in legal brief-writing, in which an advocate may cite favorable authority and ignore unfavorable authority, at 
least if the unfavorable authority is not from the applicable controlling jurisdiction. See Indiana Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 
3.3(a)(3) (requiring disclosure of directly adverse and controlling legal authority if known to lawyer and not disclosed by opposing 
counsel). (Whether it is advisable to cite non-controlling but adverse authority is a matter of professional judgment rather than 
rule.) And regarding the change from the 1995 ASHRAE Handbook, one might consider the parallel problem with a brief that 
cites overruled or out-of-date authority. For example, plaintiff's brief cites repealed versions of statutes regarding civil remedies 
for victims of crimes, though the error was harmless."
705,3," As noted above, the Seventh Circuit wrote in Hemenway v. Peabody Coal Co., 159 F.3d 255, 261 (7th Cir. 1998), that the 
district court had erred by dismissing a fraud claim based on the plaintiff's failure to plead reliance. In Sanderson's case, 
however, it is clear that he is not claiming that his commercial foes' allegedly false statements fooled him; he is claiming they 
deceived prospective customers. Indiana's common law of fraud does not reach such claims. "
721,1," Although defendants have not argued that the alleged conspiracy cannot be considered illegal per se, plaintiffs contended at 
oral argument that any boycott of credit is per se illegal. (Tr. at 13.) However, this Court notes that not all horizontal group 
boycotts are per se illegal. See Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery and Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 294, 
86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985); Bogan, 166 F.3d at 514. ""The scope of the per se rule against group boycotts is a 
recognized source of confusion in antitrust law."" Bogan, 166 F.3d at 514 (citation omitted). Moreover, the agreement alleged 
here does not reflect ""the classic model of a group boycott -- that is, a 'concerted attempt by a group of competitors at one level 
to protect themselves from competition from non-group members who seek to compete at that level.'"" Bogan, 166 F.3d at 514 
(citing Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 193 U.S. App. D.C. 19, 593 F.2d 1173, 1178 (D.C. Cir. 1978)); see also Capital Imaging, 996 
F.2d 537, 542 (2d Cir. 1993) HN7[
] (""Conduct considered illegal per se is invoked only in a limited class of cases, where a 
defendant's actions are so plainly harmful to competition and so obviously lacking in any redeeming pro-competitive values that 
they are conclusively presumed illegal without further examination.""). "
724,2," CIT also alleged that plaintiffs Section 2 claims should be dismissed because they failed to allege an antitrust injury. As 
discussed above, plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded an antitrust injury at this stage. "
726,3," The remaining 10 percent of Stella Bishop is owned by a third shareholder. Any dissenting shareholder of Stella Bishop could

750,1," Lakestates, Steelcase, Inc. and SFSI will be collectively referred to as the Steelcase Parties. Holland will be referred to 
separately."
750,2," There have been several appeals from the bankruptcy court in this case. In one appeal, the Steelcase Parties appealed from 
the denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Spradlin from violating the NCA. The Court affirmed the bankruptcy 
court. See Order dated January 5, 2000. The second appeal was Spradlin's appeal from the bankruptcy court's determination 
that Michigan law exempts only one of Spradlin's Individual Retirement Accounts, which the parties settled prior to a decision by 
the Court. The third appeal followed the bankruptcy court's findings and fact and conclusions of law on counts I and II of the 
Steelcase Parties' counter claim. As to Count I, the bankruptcy court found that the NCA was a dischargeable debt. As to Count 
II, the bankruptcy court found that Spradlin unlawfully converted a 1993 Ford Dump Truck, a laptop computer, and a set of four 
first-row Red Wings season tickets, and therefore these debts were not dischargeable. The Bankruptcy Court also found that a 
1994 Jet Ski trailer, a 1994 Chrysler Wagon, a 1995 Pontiac Bonneville, a 1994 Dodge Viper, an expensive red amber vase, and 
certain checks were not unlawfully converted and therefore dischargeable debts. The Court affirmed the bankruptcy court on 
both counts. See Memorandum and Order dated January 5, 2001. "
752,3," This section, known as section 2 of MARA was derived from section 2 of the Uniform State Antitrust Act."
752,4," Spradlin also argued that the NCA was not enforceable under a so-called ""Negative-Inference Theory,"" under which Spradlin 
argued that under MARA, all non-competition agreements other than those between an employer and an employee are invalid. 
The bankruptcy court rejected this argument, and Spradlin does not raise it on appeal."
752,5," The bankruptcy court based its determination that no good will from Spradlin and the CI companies was given as part of the 
transfer of assets to the Steelcase Parties on the deposition testimony of William Geiger, who managed the CI companies for 
Steelcase and was a negotiator for SFSI in the SSA, and who stated that in his opinion, the Steelcase Parties did not purchase 
any good will as part of the SSA and NCA. Even assuming that the bankruptcy court was correct in holding that the failure to 
include good will dooms the NCA, this is scanty evidence. Also noteworthy is Spradlin's statement that there was no good will 
left in the CI companies at the time the SSA was executed because Steelcase had ""looted"" the CI companies."
752,6, The parties agree that Michigan law applies. The NCA states as much. See P 11. 
753,7," The Court's decision to analyze whether the NCA is reasonable under Michigan law logically follows from the contemporaneous 
order withdrawing the order of reference to the bankruptcy court. As indicated at the hearing on August 28, 2002, the Court 
desires to proceed expediently with this case. Moreover, the parties' papers addressed the issue of whether the NCA is 
reasonable and the Court is satisfied with the parties' presentation of the issue. "
759,1," The ""exclusive"" contracts entitled HMO's or Preferred Provider organizations (PPO's) to up to a 25% discount of billed charges 
if the provider designated North Oaks as the sole provider of certain medical services, including outpatient surgery, within a 
designated geographic area. "
760,2," See  Surgical Care Ctr. of Hammond, L.C. v. Hospital Serv. Dist. No. 1 of Tangipahoa Parish, 171 F.3d 231, 232 (5th Cir. 
1999)(en banc) (holding that the Louisiana legislature ""did not make sufficiently clear an intent . . . to insulate its creature of state 
government from the constraints of the Sherman Antitrust Act. . . ."")."
760,3," HN1[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Act makes it unlawful for any person or firm to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several 
States."" 15 U.S.C. § 2."
760,4," HN2[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that ""Every contract . . . or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states"" is illegal.  15 U.S.C. § 1. "
761,5," The district court alternatively ruled that even if one were to accept St. Luke's definition of the outpatient surgery market as 
limited to North Oaks's service area, St. Luke's still had failed to show a dangerous probability of North Oaks' achieving 
monopoly power. The district court emphasized that (1) North Oaks' 42-44% share of the outpatient surgery market (as narrowly 
defined by St. Luke's) was not dominant; (2) St. Luke's expert opined that there are ""few if any classic barriers to entry into the 
ambulatory surgical services market""; (3) St. Luke's obtained 24.7% of the outpatient surgery market in its first full year of 
operations, even though North Oaks already had entered into exclusive agreements with several managed care companies; and 
(4) St. Luke's expert admitted that North Oaks would have only a ""very limited ability"" to raise prices above the competitive level 
if St. Luke's went out of business. "
762,6," St. Luke's appears to concede this point in its brief, noting that the rule articulated by the district court ""generally applies to St. 
Luke's Sherman Act claims . . . [but] has no application to St. Luke's allegations based on Louisiana's monopoly laws."" The state 
law claims will be discussed below."
762,7," St. Luke's argued in its brief to this court that remand was unnecessary because the record contained ample evidence of a § 1 
violation. St. Luke's suggested that remand would be appropriate only if evidence as to any element of a § 1 violation was not 
allowed or was otherwise not presented at trial. At oral argument, though, St. Luke's counsel requested remand and stated that 
relevant § 1 evidence was either not presented or not admitted at trial. We will not permit an off-the-cuff statement to contradict 
the considered admission in St. Luke's brief. "
763,8," The parties agree that this case involves interstate commerce, and there is a plausible argument that the Louisiana Monopolies 
Act applies only to wholly intrastate restraints on trade.  Terrebonne Homecare, Inc. v. SMA Health Plan, Inc., 271 F.3d 186, 189 
(5th Cir. 2001)(noting that the question is unresolved); Free v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 164 F.3d 270, 276 (5th Cir. 1999)(certifying

772,1," Published as Livingston Downs Racing Ass'n v. Jefferson Downs, Corp., 192 F. Supp. 2d 519 (M.D. La. 2001). "
773,2," The vast number of named defendants and their very different relationships to each other and the complained of actions 
presents the Court with the possibility of unintended ambiguity. To minimize that possibility the Court adopts the following 
conventions for referring to the members of the defendant group and subgroups of it. Where it is possible to distinguish among 
the original defendants by referring to them individually or in easily denominated groups, the opinion will do so. When it is 
preferable to refer to groups of the defendants collectively, the following conventions will apply. When the word ""defendant"" is 
capitalized, it refers to all the persons and corporations who remained parties to the case before this ruling. Hence, ""Defendants"" 
refers to Jefferson Downs, Fair Grounds, Finish Line, Bryan Krantz, Marie Krantz, the Committee to Control Gambling, Peter 
Henry, George Boudreaux, and Larry Bankston. Where ""defendants"" is not capitalized, the word will refer to some other 
subgroup of the original defendants. The surrounding text will always provide the necessary context to tell precisely what subset 
of the original defendant group is intended. "
774,3," These dismissed defendants were all state actors. All but Melinda Tucker were members of the Louisiana State Racing 
Commission. Melinda Tucker worked as an Assistant Attorney General for the Louisiana Attorney General's Office. The 
settlement required the Louisiana State Racing Commission to grant Livingston Downs a license to operate its planned racetrack 
so long as Livingston Downs managed to obtain appropriate financial backing. Ultimately, the Commission refused the license 
because of a flaw with the financing. Livingston Downs sued to force the Commission to grant the license, but lost on appeal. 
Jefferson Downs Corp., Inc. v. Louisiana State Racing Commission, 751 So. 2d 465 (La.App. 4th Cir. 2000), cert. denied,

of their settlement. Doc. 428."

licensed before June 30, 1987. LA. REV. STAT. § 4:211(5). Under that law, Livingston Downs could not obtain the OTB license 
once held by Jefferson Downs. Livingston Downs challenged that law on equal protection grounds in an independent lawsuit and 
ultimately lost on appeal. Livingston Downs Racing Ass'n v. State, 705 So. 2d 149 (La. 1997). "

779,12," The mail and wire fraud statutes are two of many criminal statutes that may serve as predicate violations under the RICO 
statute. Without at least two predicate violations--two acts of racketeering--there can be no RICO violation. "
780,13," In the September 23 ruling, the Court referred to all the Defendants collectively as ""Fair Grounds,"" following defendants' lead, 
because it was not important for the purpose of that ruling--as it is for this one--to distinguish among them. It bears noting, as 
well, that Livingston Downs also claims that the Defendants violated § 1962(a) and (b) and conspired to violate these 
substantive subsections. The discussion above mentions only the subsection (c) violation solely to simplify the narrative."
780,14, 297 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir. 2002). 
781,15," An independent problem with Livingston Downs' mail fraud theory of liability is that Livingston Downs would have to establish 
that it was deprived of a property interest to substantiate its claim. To be guilty of mail fraud, the defrauder must have an intent to 
use deceit for the purpose of divesting another person of a property interest. Seemingly, Livingston Downs' complaint is that the 
Krantzes connived to deprive it of state licenses and of the voter approval required to use those licenses. Interestingly, in 
another case which involved Larry Bankston and Louisiana gambling licenses, the Supreme Court held that a license in the 
hands of the state is not property for the purpose of the mail fraud statute. See  Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 20, 
121 S. Ct. 365, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221 (2000) (holding that the mail fraud statute ""does not reach fraud in obtaining a state or 
municipal license of the kind here involved, for such a license is not 'property' in the government regulator's hands.""). This Court 
does not rule on this alternate ground because the parties have never focused on the issue. "
784,16, 677 F. Supp. 1477 (D. Or. 1987).
784,17," HN14[
] Whether an antitrust conspiracy is possible does not require a factual determination. In Bell Atlantic, the court 
reasoned as follows: Under the reasoning of Copperweld and its progeny, it is not necessary to conduct a factual inquiry to determine whether a 
parent and a subsidiary over which the parent has legal control can conspire in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. "
785,," Copperweld found that a parent and a wholly-owned subsidiary are considered the ""same entity"" for antitrust purposes 
because the parent has the power to exercise full control over its subsidiary. For the same reasons, a parent and a 
subsidiary over which the parent has legal control cannot conspire to restrain trade. Bell Atlantic, 849 F. Supp. at 706."
785,18," It is irrelevant that these agents may have, in addition to the duties they owe their employers, distinct individual motivations for 
pursuing the same acts. What is important is that they are, in fact, pursuing the interests of their employers. So, for example, 
Larry Bankston may have been driven solely by a desire to run up legal fees or out of personal animus for the ownership of 
Livingston Downs. These facts would not matter. The only important fact is that the Krantzes or their corporations hired 
Bankston to perform certain duties for pay. That relationship removes Bankston from the universe of potential co-conspirators for 
the Krantzes. The only exception to this general rule applies when an agent seeks to advance her own interests as a 
marketplace actor. Siegel Transfer, Inc. v. Carrier Exp., Inc., 54 F.3d 1125, 1136-37 (3d Cir. 1995)(""For HN16[

of a conspiracy between a principal and an agent to apply in the antitrust context, the exception to the general rule should arise 
only where an agent acts to further his own economic interest in a marketplace actor which benefits from the alleged restraint,

deprive another of the intangible right of honest services."" This section answers a conflict over the scope of the mail and wire 
fraud statutes. The honest services doctrine developed by judicial construction specifically to address breaches of fiduciary duty 
including local political corruption. The Supreme Court subsequently disapproved the doctrine. United States v. McNally, 483 
U.S. 350, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d. 292 (1987). Then Congress passed § 1346 to abrogate the Supreme Court decision

purchased a PC from PB. (Appellant's Br. at 20 n.5.)"
802,8," Although Gravity's complaint was filed prior to resolution of the public enforcement action, the factual predicate is similar, and 
on appeal, relies upon many of the D.C. Circuit's findings for general support for its propositions."

] A single criminal conspiracy generally is demonstrated by an ""overlap of key actors, methods, and goals."" United States v. Strickland, 245 F.3d 368, 385 (4th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also  United States v. 
Bowens, 224 F.3d 302, 308 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding that it was not error for the district court to refuse to instruct the jury on 
multiple conspiracies where there was evidence of common methods of operation and common participants linked by a mutual 
interest); United States v. Squillacote, 221 F.3d 542, 574 (4th Cir. 2000) (""A single conspiracy exists where there is one overall 
agreement, or one general business venture."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because Gravity does not argue that its 
allegations are sufficient to demonstrate this type of overlap but instead only advocates our adopting the concept of a rimless 
wheel conspiracy, we need not decide whether the same test that applies to demonstrate a single criminal conspiracy would 
apply in the context of the Sherman Act."
804,13," The dissent's confusion in applying Kotteakos is understandable by reference to its reliance on the Sixth and Eighth Circuits, 
both of which appear to have misinterpreted Kotteakos. Post at 30-31 (citing Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dep't 
Stores, Inc., 459 F.2d 138 (6th Cir. 1972); Impro Prods., Inc. v. Herrick, 715 F.2d 1267, 1279 (8th Cir. 1983)). In Elder-Beerman, 
the Sixth Circuit stated that ""there is much discussion in the Kotteakos decision indicating the possibility that such a 'rimless 
wheel' theory might be used in a civil case though not appropriate in a criminal case."" Elder-Beerman, 459 F.2d at 147. In Impro 
Products, the Eighth Circuit compounded the Sixth Circuit's error by describing the test set forth in Elder-Beerman for a rimless 
wheel conspiracy (which is adopted by the dissent, post at 29-30) and then concluding that a rimless wheel conspiracy 
constitutes a single conspiracy in civil actions.  Impro Prods., 715 F.2d at 1279 & n.14. Nothing in Kotteakos suggests, however, 
that the definition of a rimless wheel conspiracy turns on whether the conspiracy is civil or criminal in nature; the Sixth and the 
Eighth Circuits' contrary belief apparently stems from the distinction between criminal and civil actions that was drawn in 
Kotteakos for purposes of analyzing harmless error. In any event, even if we were to further distort the clear holding set forth in Kotteakos by following the Sixth and Eighth Circuits 
in the manner suggested by the dissent, our resolution of Gravity's claims would be unaffected. Regardless of whether Gravity 
has alleged a single conspiracy among the OEM Defendants and Microsoft or two separate agreements, its § 1 and § 2 claims 
would be subject to dismissal for failure to allege facts demonstrating a significant likelihood of anticompetitive effects. "
805,14," Arguably, however, these allegations are insufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate that either Compaq or Dell possessed 
specific intent to maintain Microsoft's alleged monopolies under § 2. See  TV Communications Network, Inc. v. Turner Network 
Television, Inc., 964 F.2d 1022, 1026-27 (10th Cir. 1992) (""Because the cable operators would have no rational motive to create 
[a monopolistic environment], TVCN's allegations do not provide an inference of specific intent to conspire to achieve the stated 
goal of the conspiracy."")."
805,15," Justice Brandeis in Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918), explained HN11[ ] the rule of reason as follows: The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant "
806,," facts. This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because 
knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences. Id. at 238."
806,16," Nor do we suggest whether any such anticompetitive effect, if shown to be likely and substantial in magnitude, would be 
outweighed by a procompetitive justification. See, e.g., Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 59 (noting, under traditional rule of reason 
analysis, if the plaintiff successfully demonstrates anticompetitive effect, then the burden shifts to the defendant to proffer a 
procompetitive justification for its conduct). "
807,17," Gravity alleged that Microsoft ""maintained a monopoly share (in the range of 90%) in the personal computer operating 
software market"" throughout the ""class periods,"" (J.A. at 473), and maintained a market share in the range of 80-90% in the 
word processing and spreadsheet software markets throughout the class period. HN14[
] For antitrust purposes, market power 
""is the power to force a purchaser to do something that he would not do in a competitive market."" Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image 
Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 464, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). ""It has been 
defined as the ability of a single seller to raise price and restrict output."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Market share is 
defined as ""the percentage of a market that is controlled by a firm."" Black's Law Dictionary 971 (6th ed. 1991). Market power 
generally is identified, in part, by examining market share. See, e.g., Andrew Chin, Note, Antitrust by Chance: A Unified Theory 
of Horizontal Merger Doctrine, 106 Yale L.J. 1165, 1169-72 (1997) (discussing movement away from strict reliance on 
calculation of market share in antitrust analysis). For purposes of Rule 12(b)(6), we consider Gravity's allegations regarding 
Microsoft's market share sufficient to allege Microsoft's power in the relevant software markets."
807,18," Gravity contends that because the relevant markets are in software, there is no need to evaluate Compaq's or Dell's power in 
the PC market. Compaq's and Dell's power in the PC market is critical in the analysis, however, because both OEMs pre-install 
Microsoft's software on their PCs; neither operates independently in the software market. Thus, Compaq's and Dell's ability to 
influence competition in the relevant software markets through their separate agreements with Microsoft is dependent on their 
ability to influence competition in the PC market. Cf.  Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 18, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 
104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) HN15[
] (""Any inquiry into the validity of a tying arrangement must focus on the market or markets in 
which the two products are sold, for that is where the anticompetitive forcing has its impact."")."
807,19," Gravity asserts that it need not show that Microsoft's agreements with Compaq and Dell were each a sole cause of any 
anticompetitive effects but need show only that the agreements were each a ""material cause"" of anticompetitive effects. See  
Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114 n.9, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969) (""It is enough "
808,," that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the injury; a plaintiff need not exhaust all possible alternative sources of 
injury in fulfilling his burden of proving compensable injury under § 4.""). Without an allegation of market share or market power of 
either Compaq or Dell, however, Gravity cannot make the latter showing. Cf.  Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, 429 U.S. 
477, 487-88, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977) (holding that HN16[
] an antitrust claim fails as a matter of law when the 
plaintiff would have suffered the identical loss without regard to the claimed anticompetitive conduct); 2 Areeda & Hovenkamp P 
363a-b, at 219-23 (noting that no material cause can be demonstrated where an independent cause fully accounts for the 
claimed antitrust injury)."
808,20," Gravity did allege that Compaq and Dell were the ""largest PC makers"" and were ""among the largest distributors of Microsoft's 
products."" (Appellant's Br. at 11.) The dissent relies on this as a sufficient allegation of Compaq and Dell's respective influences 
in the PC market. Post at 34. Being the ""largest"" in a relevant market, however, says nothing of a firm's ability to affect 
competition in that market. For example, Compaq and Dell each may possess only five percent of the market share, whereas 
many other OEMs each possess four percent of the market share, in which case, despite being the largest PC makers and 
software distributors, neither Compaq nor Dell would have the ability, through their separate conspiracies with Microsoft, to affect 
competition in the relevant software markets. Cf., e.g., Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 26, 80 L. Ed. 2d 
2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 & n.43, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (holding, as a matter of law, that thirty percent 
share of the relevant market is insufficient to confer market power). Accordingly, Gravity's allegations that Compaq and Dell were 
the largest PC makers and software distributors provide no basis whatsoever to conclude that either had sufficient share of the 
PC market to affect competition in the relevant software markets. "
809,21," The cumulative harm of Microsoft's actions ""outside"" the two licensing agreements at issue has been subject to review in the 
public enforcement action and will be further subject to review in the consumer class actions brought against Microsoft 
individually and in any suits brought by OEMs against Microsoft. As noted above, supra at 19-20, the focus of this § 1 inquiry is 
not Microsoft's actions standing alone, but the extent to which its concerted actions with each of the two individual OEMs 
promoted Microsoft's monopoly power or otherwise restrained trade."
809,22," HN19[
] Section 2 states: "
810,," Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nationals, shall be deemed guilty 
of a felony . . . ."
810,15, U.S.C.A. § 2 (West 1997). 
811,23," While the dissent notes as ""unexceptional"" the proposition that a plaintiff may not rely on a bare legal conclusion to avoid 
dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), it proceeds to rely solely on Gravity's bare legal conclusions to find its complaint sufficient. Post at 
37 n.1."

] Illinois Brick's indirect purchaser rule, when applicable, bars only compensatory damages relief and does not apply 
to injunctive relief. See  Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, 479 U.S. 104, 111 n.6, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, 107 S. Ct. 484 (1986); 
Campos v. Ticketmaster, 140 F.3d 1166, 1172 (8th Cir. 1998); McCarthy v. Recordex Serv., Inc., 80 F.3d 842, 856-57 (3d Cir. 
1996). "
817,1," The majority also parenthetically quotes Mun. Utils. Bd. of Albertville v. Alabama Power Co., 934 F.2d 1493, 1501 (11th Cir. 
1991): ""A plaintiff must plead sufficient facts so that each element of the alleged antitrust violation can be identified."" Ante at 24. 
But the majority omits the important qualifier contained in the same paragraph: ""However, the alleged facts need not be spelled 
out with exactitude, nor must recovery appear imminent."" Mun Utils. Bd, 934 F.2d at 1501. Finally, Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford 
Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1106 (8th Cir. 1984), stands for the unexceptional and well-worn proposition that a plaintiff must at 
least ""outline or adumbrate"" a violation of the Sherman Act, instead of relying on a bare legal conclusion. Id. "
819,2," To the extent that the litigation subsequently revealed true Illinois Brick issues, such as if the defendant OEMs switched sides 
and sued Microsoft, see  Paper Sys., 281 F.3d at 632, I agree that Illinois Brick might then require dismissal of Gravity's claims. "

824,2," Plaintiffs brought another suit in state court against the CHP group and the City alleging breach of contract and tort claims. 
When the present case was decided in the United States District Court the state suit was still pending, and we are not informed 
of its present status. "
825,3, No party has objected to this approach. 
830,4," The district court did not address the question of whether AFB and PRC had entered into a contract but considered only 
interference with AFB's prospective contractual relations. No party suggests that this was error. "
857,1," Remaining as Plaintiffs in this case, but not addressed in this Memorandum Opinion, are the States of California, Connecticut, 
Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Utah, and West Virginia, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia. "
860,2," In the former companion case, State of New York, et al. v. Microsoft Corp., the States of New York, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin have entered into a conditional settlement with Microsoft as to the 
issue of remedy. Those Plaintiff States--""Settling States""--are awaiting approval by this Court of the settlement in this case 
before entry of the settlement in State of New York, et al v. Microsoft Corp. pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Because the proposed final judgment addresses the Settling States as well as the United States in its terms, the 
Court, where appropriate, refers to both the United States and the Settling States as ""Plaintiffs"" in this Memorandum Opinion."
860,3," Pursuant to the stipulation filed with the Court on November 6, 2001, Microsoft began complying with portions of the proposed 
final judgment on December 16, 2001, as if ""it were in full force and effect."" Stipulation at 2. On August 28, 2002, the United 
States submitted a ""Notice"" to the Court advising ""the Court of Microsoft's compliance with various milestones established by the 
Second Revised Proposed Final Judgment ('SRPFJ')."" Notice at 1 (Aug. 28, 2002). In general terms, the Notice indicates that 
Microsoft is in compliance with its requirements and ""takes seriously its obligations under the SRPFJ."" Id. at 7. "
862,4," The Court notes that the objective of ""terminating the illegal monopoly,"" United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 391 U.S. 
244, 250, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562, 88 S. Ct. 1496 (1968), is incompatible with the facts of this case. Neither the district court, nor the 
appellate court concluded that Microsoft had unlawfully obtained its monopoly. See  Microsoft, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 
34; Microsoft, 87 F. Supp. 2d 30; see also  Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1452 (observing in the precursor to this case that ""the 
government did not allege and does not contend--and this is of crucial significance to this case--that Microsoft obtained its 
alleged monopoly position in violation of the antitrust laws"") (emphasis in original). Moreover, as noted by the appellate court, 
""the District Court expressly did not adopt the position that Microsoft would have lost its position in the OS market but for its 
anticompetitive behavior."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 107 (citing Findings of Fact P 411). In this context, outright termination of the 
monopoly is a questionable remedial goal, as such action would exceed the limits of the controversy presented to the Court. 
Accordingly, the Court's inquiry into the extent to which the proposed consent decree ""terminates the illegal monopoly,"" United 
Shoe, 391 U.S. at 250, will be limited, and the Court will instead focus upon terminating the illegal maintenance of the monopoly. "
863,5," In referring to ""Plaintiffs"" throughout this Memorandum Opinion, the Court refers to the United States, as well as the Plaintiff 
States in Civ. No. 98-1233, who entered into a settlement agreement with Microsoft. See supra note 1. The Court notes, 
however, that the appellate court's opinion applies not only to the claims brought by the United States and the Settling States, 
but also to those states who have C in State of New York, et al. v. Microsoft, No. 98-1233 (D.D.C.)."
863,6," ""PC"" is short for ""personal computer."" Findings of Fact P 1."
863,7," The appellate court, relying upon the factual testimony presented to the district court, explained the functions of a PC operating 
system: Operating systems perform many functions, including allocating computer memory and controlling peripherals such as 
printers and keyboards. Operating systems also function as platforms for software applications. They do this by ""exposing""-
-i.e., making available to software developers--routines or protocols that perform certain widely-used functions. These are 
known as Application Programming Interfaces, or ""APIs."" For example, Windows contains an API that enables users to 
draw a box on the screen. Software developers wishing to include that function in an application need not duplicate it in 
their own code. Instead, they can ""call""--i.e., use--the Windows API. Windows contains thousands of APIs, controlling 
everything from data storage to font display. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 53 (citations omitted)."

864,9," ""APIs"" are applications programming interfaces. As Judge Jackson explained: [An] operating system supports the functions of 
applications by exposing interfaces, called ""application programming interfaces,"" or ""APIs."" These are synapses at which the

turn perform crucial tasks, such as displaying text on the computer screen. Findings of Fact P 2."

thereby make it easier for applications that rely in whole or in part on the functionality supplied by that software product to

884,27," Although identified as an OEM in the appellate court's opinion, the Court observes that Apple does not fit into the definition of 
OEM provided in the SRPFJ because it does not license Microsoft's operating system product. SRPFJ § VI.O. The Court 
remains unconcerned by this fact because the protections afforded to OEMs concern their licensing of Windows, and therefore, 
it would make little sense to include Apple within the purview of these protections. See, e.g., SRPFJ § III.A-C, H. Moreover,

912,11," The appellate court, relying upon the factual testimony presented to the district court, explained the functions of a PC 
operating system: Operating systems perform many functions, including allocating computer memory and controlling peripherals such as 
printers and keyboards. Operating systems also function as platforms for software applications. They do this by ""exposing""-
i.e., making available to software developers-routines or protocols that perform certain widely-used functions. These are 
known as Application Programming Interfaces, or ""APIs."" For example, Windows contains an API that enables users to 
draw a box on the screen. Software developers wishing to include that function in an application need not duplicate it in 
their own code. Instead, they can ""call""-i.e., use-the Windows API. Windows contains thousands of APIs, controlling 
everything from data storage to font display. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 53 (citations omitted)."

912,13," ""APIs"" are applications programming interfaces. As Judge Jackson explained: [An] operating system supports the functions of 
applications by exposing interfaces, called ""application programming interfaces,"" or ""APIs."" These are synapses at which the 
developer of an application can connect to invoke pre-fabricated blocks of code in the operating system. These blocks of code in 
turn perform crucial tasks, such as displaying text on the computer screen. Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 12 P 2. For a supplemental definition of ""API,"" see infra note 35. "
913,14," Such software takes the name ""middleware"" because ""it relies on the interfaces provided by the underlying operating system

920,23," Beyond this single liability finding, which the Court raised with the parties, Plaintiffs have not directed the Court to other 
instances where the district court ascribed liability, and the appellate court's treatment of that finding is unclear or absent. "
921,24," In that case, which is often recognized as the precursor to this case, the appellate court noted that ""the government did not 
allege and does not contend-and this is of crucial significance to this case-that Microsoft obtained its alleged monopoly position 
in violation of the antitrust laws."" Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1452 (emphasis in original). "
922,25," Relying upon the appellate court's discussion of causation, Microsoft has argued that Plaintiffs have not satisfied the 
requirements of antitrust standing (""causation"") and ""antitrust injury"" and must do so in this remanded proceeding in order to 
obtain any remedy. As explained in great detail in the Court's Memorandum Opinion dated June 12, 2002, these issues were, of 
necessity, addressed in conjunction with the finding and affirmance of liability by the district court and appellate court. See State 
of New York, et al. v. Microsoft Corp., 209 F. Supp. 2d 132, slip op. passim (D.D.C.2002). In setting up this straw-man argument, 
Microsoft ignores the distinction between the establishment of some type of causation, which is fundamental to a finding of 
liability and an assessment of the strength of the causal connection between the anticompetitive behavior and the maintenance 
of the monopoly for purposes of crafting a remedy. Only the latter of these inquiries is presently before the Court."
922,26," As the parties' arguments reflect, it is unclear whether the appellate court intended only for this court to re-examine the 
existing evidence relevant to the ""causal connection"" in conjunction with crafting a remedy, or whether Plaintiffs were to be given 
an opportunity to supplement the evidence relating to causation. "

931,31," For example, pursuant to the definition of ""Non-Microsoft Middleware,"" products competitive with Microsoft Office would 
receive protection from various types of adverse action by Microsoft, notwithstanding the fact that Microsoft Office is a product 
which has always been separate and distinct from Microsoft's operating system."
931,32," The term ""automatic invocations"" refers generally to the launching of a particular piece of software functionality without the 
direct invocation of such software by the user. "
933,33," Indeed, Judge Jackson relied upon the separate distribution of browser functionality in the Windows 95 Service Pack to 
identify the separation between Microsoft's browsing functionality and its operating system functionality. Findings of Fact,84 F. 
Supp. 2d at 56, P 190."
933,34," Were Microsoft to make a practice of doing so in a manner which thwarted the objective of the remedy in this case, Plaintiffs 
could petition the Court for relief on this point. "
934,35," One particularly helpful definition of ""API"" explains: An API, in effect, is a doorway between programs that can be used for specified purposes. For example, a PC operating 
system will generally control how images are displayed on the PC's computer screen. By exposing an API, the operating 
system may enable other programs also to display images on the computer screen without the need to replicate all of the 
code of the operating system that performs this function. Ledbetter P 32."
934,36," These portions of Plaintiffs' remedy proposal refer to ""non-Microsoft middleware,"" which is not itself a defined term in Plaintiffs' 
remedy proposal. As a result, non-Microsoft takes its plain meaning and merely serves to modify the defined term ""middleware."" 
See SPR §§ 2.c, 5, 10."
934,37," Section 22.x of Plaintiffs' remedy proposal provides: ""Microsoft Middleware Product"" means i. Internet browsers, e-mail client software, media creation, delivery and playback software, instant messaging software, 
voice recognition software, digital imaging software, directories, Exchange, calendaring systems, systems and enterprise "
935,," management software, Office, Handheld Computing Device synchronization software, directory services and management 
software, the Common Language Runtime component of the .Net framework, and Compact Framework, whether provided 
in the form of files installed on a computer or in the form of Web-Based Software, or ii. Middleware distributed by Microsoft that - (1) is, or in the three years preceding this Judgment has been, distributed separately from an Operating System Product, 
any successors thereto, or (2) provides functionality similar to that provided by Middleware offered by a Microsoft competitor. SPR § 22.x. Oddly, this definition does not specify that the software products listed in subpart ""i"" must be Microsoft software 
products. The Court presumes, however, that Plaintiffs intended that such products would be Microsoft products given that the 
term is ""Microsoft Middleware Product."" Subpart ""ii"" does not suffer from a similar infirmity, as it specifies that the products must 
be ""Middleware distributed by Microsoft."" Id. § 22.x.ii (emphasis added). "
936,38," In contrast, Microsoft's proposed remedy, in the context of discussing API disclosures, identifies the particular Microsoft 
middleware technology as specific software code. SRPFJ §§ III.D; VI.J. From these identifications of the code for middleware 
technology present in Windows, Microsoft is able to identify the APIs relied upon by the middleware to obtain functionality from 
the remainder of the Windows operating system."
936,39," One of Microsoft's computer science experts, Dr. Stuart E. Madnick, described a similar problem with regard to the inability to 
identify the precise code implicated in other portions of Plaintiffs' remedy proposal. See id. P 164 (discussing § 12 of Plaintiffs' 
remedy proposal)."
936,40," ""Microsoft Platform Software"" is defined in Plaintiffs' remedy proposal as ""a Windows Operating System Product or Microsoft 
Middleware Product or any combination of a Windows Operating System Product and a Microsoft Middleware Product."" SPR §

such that ""the lines between set-tops and PCs are blurring as set-tops acquire more computing functionality and the PC acquires 
more television functionality"" and the two will ultimately be a ""unified device,"" id. P 81. See generally id. PP 37-40. "
939,46, Palm sells both hardware and software for handheld devices. Mace P 9. 
940,47," Dr. James Allchin, Group Vice President for Platforms at Microsoft, Allchin PP 1, 13, provided an example of Web services: 
""The Web services model permits an automobile manufacturer's computer system to communicate via the Internet with a piston 
supplier's computer to place new orders without any human intervention. There is no Web-browsing software involved at all."" 
Allchin P 43."
940,48," Because of the limited relationship between Web-browsing software and Web services, the Court's discussion and 
conclusions regarding Web services are unrelated to the manner in which the Court's remedy will address Web-browsing 
software. The Court's remedy treats Web-browsing software as middleware. See infra Parts III.C.5, III.B.2.a. "
941,49," Despite this position, Microsoft has addressed at least one area of technology, servers and network computing, in one 
provision of its proposed remedy. See SRPFJ § III.E (mandating the disclosure of communications protocols). "
942,50," Notwithstanding this conclusion, as the Court discusses, infra Part III.C.2, if interactive television software evolves as Plaintiffs 
predict, it will be protected by portions of the Court's remedy. "
943,51," The Court focuses, in this section, upon the platform potential of that portion of the software which resides on the set-top box. 
The platform potential of the portion of set-top software which runs on a server can be subsumed into the more general analysis 
of the capabilities of network computing. See supra Parts III.B.3.a, III.C.1."
943,52," Treatment as ""Non-Microsoft Middleware"" affords protections against retaliation and with regard to OEM installation of an icon, 
shortcut, or menu entry. Treatment as a ""NonMicrosoft Middleware Product"" would, in specifically defined instances, enable 
interactive television software to be invoked in place of the Microsoft technology which would otherwise launch automatically. If the Microsoft counterpart to interactive television software falls within the definition of ""Microsoft Middleware,"" at some point in 
the future, Microsoft will be required to disclose the APIs and related technical information for interfaces that are relied upon by 
the Microsoft version of the interactive television software to receive services from the remainder of Windows. See infra Part 
IV.E. "
944,53," Inasmuch as Plaintiffs' view the handheld device as a substitute for the PC, Plaintiffs' argument for the inclusion of handheld 
devices in the scope of the remedy represents an ironic about-face from Plaintiffs' earlier position-taken in conjunction with the 
identification of the relevant market in the liability phase-that handheld devices are not interchangeable with the PC. Microsoft, 
253 F.3d at 52; Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 15, P 23. In this regard, the Court observes that, unlike middleware, 
handheld devices were not treated as ""nascent threats"" during the liability phase. "
945,54," More clearly established than the relationship between handheld devices and this proceeding is the fact that Microsoft's 
primary competitor in the handheld market would benefit from the inclusion of handheld devices within the definitions of 
""middleware"" and ""Microsoft Middleware Product."" In fact, the evidence establishes that Palm was intimately involved in the 
inclusion of such software in Plaintiffs' proposed remedy and stands to benefit competitively from such inclusion because 
inclusion of handheld devices in the remedy would, for example, afford Palm access to significant information regarding 
Microsoft's proprietary technologies and would hinder Microsoft's ability to compete in a market already dominated by Palm. See 
supra Part III.B.3.c; see, e.g., SPR §§ 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15. This fact, although hardly dispositive of the issue, gives the Court 
concern as to the legitimacy of the inclusion of handheld-related software in the scope of the remedy. Plaintiffs' inclusion of 
handheld devices in the scope of their proposed remedy appears to be more closely related to Palm's fears that Microsoft will 
pose a competitive threat to its dominance in the market for hand held device operating systems, than to any legitimate concern 
that Microsoft will engage in unlawful conduct. "
946,55," The Court notes as an aside that the viability of the latter theory, known as a ""monopoly leveraging"" theory, ""is in serious 
doubt."" Microsoft, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14231, 1998 WL 614485 at *26. The district court in this case rejected an earlier 
attempt to advance a monopoly leveraging theory in this case on this basis. Microsoft, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14231 at [WL] *26-
27. "
947,56," Reflecting Plaintiffs' view that middleware is any software which exposes APIs, many of Plaintiffs' witnesses testified 
throughout this proceeding that particular pieces of software are ""middleware."" The Court rejects this use of the term as 
fundamentally in conflict with the use of the term throughout the liability phase of this proceeding."
947,57," The Court notes for the sake of clarity that the significance of Microsoft's incorporation of particular functionality into its 
operating system programs in conjunction with the liability findings pursuant to § 2 of the Sherman Act, though based upon a 
common set of facts, is unrelated to Plaintiffs' now-defunct claim that such incorporation constitutes illegal tying in violation § 1 of 
the Sherman Act. See  Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 84 (""The facts underlying the tying allegation substantially overlap with those set 
forth . . . in connection with the § 2 monopoly maintenance claim."")."
947,58," Admittedly, one might argue that some of the functionalities identified in Microsoft's definition of ""Microsoft Middleware 
Product"" have not been shown to be true middleware, but there exists no objection by either party to the inclusion of these 
functionalities in the scope of protections afforded by the remedy and, thus, no issue for the Court to resolve in this regard. "
951,59," ""Open source"" refers to a ""movement"" or business model within the software community in which the source code for the 
software is made publicly available, often pursuant to terms which grant a license free of charge, with the proviso that any 
redistribution of the source code, whether modified or unmodified, must also be made publicly available for license free of 
charge. Tiemann P 33."
951,60," The Court discusses the extent to which Microsoft will be required to disclose communications protocols pursuant to the 
remedy in this case infra Part IV.E. To the extent that the CIFS and SMB protocols are natively supported by Windows and are 
used to interoperate, or communicate, with a Microsoft server, they will be disclosed pursuant to the Court's remedial decree. Id. 
Such mandatory disclosure, however, is not based upon a determination that Plaintiffs' allegations of ""bad"" acts warrant a 
remedy, but upon the Court's determination that network/server computing is sufficiently akin to middleware that communications 
protocols used by Windows to interoperate natively with Microsoft servers should be disclosed in order to facilitate interoperation 
between Windows clients and non-Microsoft servers. See supra Part III.C; infra Part IV.E. "

to be ""the leading distributor of the Linux operating system."" Tiemann P 1. "
955,62," Microsoft has maintained that Plaintiffs are not entitled to any remedy in this case. The Court rejected these arguments, which 
were primarily advanced in Microsoft's ""motion to dismiss"" in an earlier Memorandum Opinion. State of New York, et al. v. 
Microsoft, 209 F. Supp. 2d 132, slip op. (D.D.C.2002). "
962,63," ""Preventing an OEM from removing IE deters it from installing a second browser because doing so increases the OEM's 
product testing and support costs; by contrast, had OEMs been able to remove IE, they might have chosen to pre-Install 
Navigator alone."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 66 (citing Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 49, P 159). "
963,64," This problem of technically separating the ""operating system"" from other functionality, such as browsing functionality, also 
arose in conjunction with Plaintiffs' claim, pursuant to § 1 of the Sherman Act, of illegal tying and, in fact, has its roots in the 
predecessor litigation: United States v. Microsoft Corp., 331 U.S. App. D.C. 121, 147 F.3d 935 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In that case, the 
D.C. Circuit observed that ""as was the case with Windows 95, the products--the full functionality of the operating system when 
upgraded by IE 4 and the 'browser functionality' of IE 4--do not exist separately."" Id. at 951-52. In the instant case, Plaintiffs 
alleged that Microsoft illegally tied its browser, IE, to its operating system. Ultimately, the appellate court was unable to conclude 
that the two identified ""products"" were, in fact, separate.  Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 85-95. In this regard, the appellate court noted 
that Plaintiffs had failed to provide precise definitions of ""browser"" and the browser market. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 95. The 
appellate court made the same observation in the context of its discussion of Plaintiffs' attempted monopoly claim, noting 
Plaintiffs' ""failure to articulate and identify evidence before the District Court as to . . . what constitutes a browser (i.e., what are 
the technological components of or functionalities provided by a browser)."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 81-82. "
969,65," Microsoft, dubbing this technological binding more attractively as ""integration,"" presented testimony extolling the virtues of 
integration for both consumers and other industry participants. See, e.g., Sanders PP 11-40. The Court declines to enter any 
findings with regard to whether integration of new technology into Microsoft's PC operating system products is, as a general 
proposition, suitable or beneficial. Such determinations would have been more appropriate during the liability phase, in 
conjunction with the balancing of the pro- and anticompetitive benefits of technological binding or ""integration,"" whereas a 
determination regarding the propriety of ""integration"" is not called for at this late stage in the proceeding. Instead, it is sufficient 
to note that the appellate court rejected Judge Jackson's broad condemnation of Microsoft's technological binding or 
""integration"" as a violation of § 2."
969,66," ""Default"" in this context indicates that in some of the circumstances where the Windows operating system would invoke some 
aspect of browsing functionality, it would automatically rely upon the browsing functionality provided by IE, without first seeking 
input from the user. "
970,67," As noted earlier in this Opinion, the Court's remedial decree adopts the definition of ""Microsoft Middleware Product"" provided 
in Microsoft's remedy proposal. See supra Part III.B. "
971,68," The liability in this case is clear with regard to Microsoft's history of retaliation and threats of retaliation against other industry 
participants, such as ISVs and IHVs. See, e.g., Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 72-74 (discussing Microsoft's dealings with Apple); 
Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 77-78 (describing Microsoft's ""threat to Intel""). Although Microsoft has a history of retaliation against 
OEMs, see, e.g., Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 38-43, PP 115-32, such retaliation did not provide a clear basis for liability. 
See generally  Microsoft, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34; see also supra Part II.B. "
972,69," Retaliation or other forms of adverse action against industry participants for their support of products which compete with other 
product lines offered by Microsoft that are substantially unrelated to the monopoly market in this case, such as handheld devices 
and the like, see supra Part III.B-C, are too far removed from the liability in this case to be treated as ""of the same type or class"" 
as the illegal conduct in this case. Zenith Radio, 395 U.S. at 132-33."
972,70," As illustrated in other portions of the appellate court's opinion, it is the conditioning of the receipt of consideration upon some 
degree of exclusivity which raises antitrust concerns. See, e.g., Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 75 (""Again, we reject the District Court's 
condemnation of low but non-predatory pricing by Microsoft. To the extent that Microsoft's First Wave Agreements with the ISVs 
conditioned receipt of Windows technical information upon the ISVs' agreement to promote Microsoft's JVM exclusively, they 
raise a different competitive concern.""). "
973,71," Though not clearly implicated in actions that gave rise to liability addressed by the appellate court, Judge Jackson's Findings 
of Fact reflect that Microsoft manipulated the terms of its license agreements in conjunction with its attempt to quash the 
middleware threat posed by Navigator. See, e.g., Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 67, P 234 (""In return for Compaq's 
capitulation and revival of its commitment to support Microsoft's Internet strategy, Microsoft has guaranteed Compaq that the 
prices it pays for Windows will continue to be significantly lower than the prices paid by other OEMs. . . . Compaq's license fee 
for Windows is so low that other OEMs would still pay substantially more than Compaq even if they qualified for all of the royalty 
reductions listed in Microsoft's Market Development Agreements ('MDAs'). What is more, while Microsoft requires other OEMs to 
verify actual compliance with particular milestones in order to receive Windows 98 royalty reductions, Microsoft has secretly 
agreed to provide the full amount of those discounts to Compaq regardless of whether it actually satisfies the specified 
conditions."")."
973,72," Admittedly, there are minor differences in the two remedies even on these common points. Compare SPR § 2.a, with SRPFJ § 
III.B. "
974,73," The appellate court devoted a section of its analysis to Microsoft's treatment of Intel in response to Intel's development of a 
""high performance, Windows JVM,"" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 75 (quoting Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 107, P 396), 
recounting the numerous ways in which Microsoft ""pressured Intel not to support cross-platform Java,"" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 77. 
Microsoft's pressure in this regard was based upon the threat to the Windows monopoly posed by cross-platform Java. Id. The 
appellate court found Microsoft's pressure tactics to be clear in their anticompetitive effect and wholly without procompetitive 
justification. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 77-78. Because of the exclusionary effect of Microsoft's threats to Intel, which Microsoft 
""lamely characterized . . . as 'advice,'"" the appellate court deemed Microsoft's conduct in this context to violate § 2 of the 
Sherman Act. Id. In a similar section, the appellate court examined Microsoft's dealings with Apple, which included an agreement by Apple not to 
""position icons for nonMicrosoft browsing software on the desktop of new Macintosh PC systems or Mac OS upgrades,"" as well 
as an agreement prohibiting Apple from ""encouraging users to substitute another browser for IE."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 73 
(quoting Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 95-96, PP 350-52). These promises not to support competing products had the 
effect of exclusivity, the anticompetitive effect of which was unmitigated by procompetitive justification. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 73-
74. In the absence of procompetitive justification, the appellate court deemed this conduct to violate § 2 of the Sherman Act. Id. "
978,74," The Court determined supra, Part III.B.3.a, that the term ""interoperate"" encompasses a continuum, rather than an absolute 
standard of information exchange. See also Appendix A, Part VI.A. Because Microsoft's disclosure obligations in this portion of 
the Court's remedial decree are fixed by the definition of ""API"" and are merely circumscribed by the requirement that the 
disclosures be provided for the ""sole purpose of interoperating,"" the Court does not limit the definition of ""interoperate"" to any 
particular degree of interoperation within the reasonable scope of the continuum."
978,75," Recalling again that the term ""interoperate"" captures a continuum, rather than an absolute standard, see supra Part III.B.3.a., 
in the mandating the disclosure of communications protocols relied upon by Windows clients to interoperate natively with 
Microsoft servers, the Court's remedial decree utilizes a very simple definition of the term which is intended to capture the 
reasonable spectrum of the continuum. Hence, the Court's remedial decree requires that Microsoft disclose communications 
protocols necessary for a Windows client to ""interoperate, or communicate, natively"" with a Microsoft server. See Appendix B. "
979,76," Plaintiffs further argue that broad interoperability disclosures are necessary to ""lessen the potential that Microsoft will be able 
to lock in developers, consumers, and businesses through undisclosed proprietary interfaces and protocols."" Pl. Prop. Finding of 
Fact P 629. This justification for broad interoperability disclosures is flawed, as it is essentially a new, and vastly unsupported, 
allegation of attempted monopolization, or a resurrection of the previously Courtrejected ""monopoly leveraging"" argument. See 
supra Part III.C; Microsoft, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14231, 1998 WL 614485 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1998), at *26-28. "
982,77," The combination of Plaintiffs' unjustifiably broad disclosure provision and the royaltyfree license would effect a drastic 
expropriation of substantial amounts of Microsoft's intellectual property in the absence of any compensation to Microsoft and 
despite the absence of additional evidence of a causal connection. "
984,78," Of additional concern to the Court is the schedule pursuant to which the special master would be required to proceed through 
his or her many duties. The Court finds this schedule to be rigid and inflexible, as it does not take into account the volume of 
complaints which the special master must assess, or the degree of complexity of the issues raised in these complaints. The 
Court is cognizant of the need for expediency in resolving complaints of non-compliance and lauds Plaintiffs' attempt to ensure 
their prompt resolution. Still, the Court remains unconvinced that Plaintiffs' desire for structure and certainty has materialized into 
a workable scheme. Accordingly, the Court declines to adopt the stringent deadlines proposed by Plaintiffs for the resolution of 
complaints of non-compliance. Mindful of the rapid pace of change in the industry and the harm which will be caused by 
violations of the Court's remedial decree, the Court assures the parties that complaints of non-compliance will be handled by the 
Court with the understanding that time is of the essence. "
985,79," Plaintiffs have not directed this Court to any evidence that Microsoft has a history of non-compliance with judicial decrees. In 
this regard, the Court notes that Microsoft was a party "
988,80," Although Microsoft's dealings with Apple did play a role in the imposition of liability, the act for which Microsoft was found to 
have violated § 2 concerned Microsoft's targeting of Navigator, rather than Microsoft's direct competition with Apple.  Microsoft, 
253 F.3d at 72-74. Microsoft's conduct relating to Apple was found to be anticompetitive because it excluded Navigator from a 
significant portion of the market.  Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 73-74."
988,81," In particular, Plaintiffs' counsel offered the argument that the divestiture of IE was an appropriate remedy based upon the 
theory that it is the ""fruit"" of Microsoft's illegal conduct. See Pl. Prop. Findings of Fact P 1116 (citing Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 103). 
Neither the evidentiary record from the liability phase, nor the record in this portion of the proceeding, establishes that the 
present success of IE is attributable entirely, or even in predominant part, to Microsoft's illegal conduct. See Appendix A, Part 
X.A. Accordingly, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that IE should be divested as the ""fruit"" of Microsoft's illegal conduct. "
990,82," The only testimony that touched on this topic was the testimony of Anthony Fama, of Gateway. Mr. Fama alleged that 
Microsoft had ""threatened"" retaliation against his firm in response to Mr. Fama's participation in this litigation. See Appendix A, 
Part X.F. Although the Court cannot agree with Mr. Fama that Microsoft's conduct was, in fact, a threat, see id., the Court 
observes that, pursuant to the Court's remedial decree, Gateway will receive protection from any true retaliation or threat thereof 
which is based upon its support for products competitive with Microsoft's monopoly product, as well as the many other 
protections afforded to OEMs which the Court described above. The Court regards such protections as entirely sufficient to 
address the concerns raised by Mr. Fama. "
992,83," HN36[

upon the parties themselves. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c). Plaintiffs have not established that additional protections against groundless 
claims of intellectual property infringement are either appropriate "
995,84," NICCOLO MACHIAVELLI, THE PRINCE, ch. 18 (1514). "
997,85," The clear discord between this aspect of Plaintiffs' proposed remedy and the appellate court's opinion, as well as the absence 
of a coherent explanation of the anticipated benefit to competition in the monopolized market, calls attention to the substantial 
involvement of Microsoft's competitors in drafting this portion of Plaintiffs' remedy proposal. This involvement raises a concern 
that the provision will accrue to the benefit of specific competitors, rather than to the benefit of competition. Indeed, Mr. 
Borthwick readily conceded that AOL had proposed the inclusion of the alternative user interface and ""third-party licensing"" 
aspects of § 2 of Plaintiffs' proposed remedy and that the provision was plainly beneficial to AOL's business. Tr. at 2263-65, 
2273-74 (Borthwick); see also Def. Ex. 692. "
998,86," Indeed, in their criticism of § III.C.2, the only evidence upon which Plaintiffs focus in their Proposed Findings of Fact is the 
inability of one of Microsoft's economic experts to identify a ""real world"" example of a shortcut that would impair the functionality 
of the user interface. Pl. Prop. Findings of Fact P 496. In the Court's view, the inability of an economist to envision examples of 
extreme conduct in the context of software design is of little consequence. Moreover, Mr. Jones offered a rather clear example of 
product design which would be covered by the language in § III.C.2 of Microsoft's proposed remedy. Jones P 46."
998,87," Mr. Jones of Microsoft explained that when a program launches automatically, at the end of the initial boot sequence, for 
example, the result is that once the computer has turned on and is presented for use by the end user, the automatically 
launched program is already started for the user, and the user need not take any action in order to invoke that program's 
capabilities. Tr. at 5129 (Jones). "
1000,88," The appellate court noted that Microsoft's claims regarding the need to preserve Windows' ""principal value . . . as a ""stable 
and consistent platform . . . that is familiar to users,"" were unsubstantiated. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 63-64 (quoting Microsoft's 
""Opening Br."" at 102). This observation continues to be true. Microsoft has not offered any evidence beyond the largely self-
serving testimony of its own software designers that instability and consumer confusion would result from the inclusion of IAP 
registration offers during the initial boot sequence. See Jones P 50. "
1001,89," To the extent that Plaintiffs' witnesses offered testimony critical of § III.H.1 because it incorporates Microsoft's more narrow 
definition of ""Microsoft Middleware Product,"" see, e.g., Barksdale PP 78-79; Kertzman P 85, these concerns are resolved by the 
Court's preliminary discussion of appropriate treatment of ""middleware"" in the remedy for Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct. 
See Memorandum Opinion, Part III.B-C. "
1002,90," As the Court concluded in Part III.B.2.b of the attached Memorandum Opinion, Plaintiffs' definition of ""middleware"" renders 
essentially any block of software code that exposes an API to be ""middleware."""
1002,91," It is noteworthy, once again, that the appellate court rejected any imposition of liability based upon the aspect of Microsoft's 
product design which overrode the user's ""default browser"" based upon the ""valid technical reasons"" advanced by Microsoft to 
justify such an override. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 67."
1002,92," There are, however, limited portions of Windows unrelated to Web-browsing functionality, for which there already exists the 
mechanism, like that described by Judge Jackson in P 171 of the Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 52, to designate non-
Microsoft software for invocation. Tr. at 5242-45 (Jones). This ability exists because Windows was designed to permit the 
designation of a non-Microsoft software to perform a particular function. Id. "
1005,93," Admittedly, there are minor differences in the two remedies even on these common points. Compare SPR § 2.a, with SRPFJ § 
III.B."
1005,94," Pursuant to its settlement agreement with the United States, on December 16, 2001, Microsoft commenced the use of uniform 
licenses. The terms of the settlement agreement match the terms of Microsoft's proposed remedy. "
1006,95," Mr. Fama reluctantly acknowledged that the gross royalty rates Gateway would pay under the new uniform licenses were 
lower than those previously paid by Gateway. Tr. at 124445 (Fama). Mr. Fama also acknowledged that the new uniform licenses 
included provisions which Gateway considered to be more favorable than under the negotiated licenses, but Mr. Fama insisted 
that such benefits were negligible. Id. at 1245-46."
1006,96," For ease of reference, the Court refers to MDAs, MDPs, and similar discount programs collectively as ""MDPs."" "
1007,97," The uniformity specified for MDPs is subject to two volume discounts: one uniform discount for the ten largest OEMs and the 
second for the eleventh through twentieth largest OEMs, with the size of the OEM measured by volume of licenses. SRPFJ § 
III.B.3. "
1008,98," In his Findings of Fact, Judge Jackson noted that Intel is both an IHV and an ISV. Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 34, P 95 
(""Although Intel is engaged principally in the design and manufacture of microprocessors, it also develops some software."")."
1008,99," Plaintiffs' arguments that § 8 is not intended to address the conduct cited as an example by Mr. Gates, along with Plaintiffs' 
insistence that § 8 would not apply in such a circumstance, indicate that the provision is, if not overly broad, at least ambiguous 
on this point. "
1009,100, The Court considers the effect of SPR § 8 on OEMs infra.
1009,101," ""Microsoft Platform Software,"" as a defined term in Microsoft's remedy proposal, means ""(i) a Windows Operating System 
Product and/or (ii) a Microsoft Middleware Product."" SRPFJ § VI.L. In the attached Memorandum Opinion, the Court has 
addressed the definition of ""Microsoft Middleware Product"" in detail and determined that it is not inappropriately narrow. See 
Memorandum Opinion, Part III.B. The term ""Windows Operating System Product,"" is defined in the SRPFJ as the software code 
which constitutes the Windows operating system family of products including Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP Home, 
Windows XP Professional, and ""their successors, including upgrades, bug fixes, service packs, etc."" SRPFJ § VI.U."
1009,102," For example, as the Court concluded in the attached Memorandum Opinion, Parts III.B.3.a, III.C.1, server operating systems-
in the context of server/network computing-can be said to ""compete"" with Microsoft's operating system because they serve as a 
platform for applications running for the PC. As a result, Microsoft's proposed anti-retaliation provision would protect server 
operating systems from retaliation for supporting server capabilities which facilitate use of the server as a platform for 
applications running ""for"" the PC. See Memorandum Opinion, Parts III.B.3.a, III.C.1. "
1010,103," Although liability was not clearly ascribed by the appellate court for this conduct, see Memorandum Opinion, Part II.B, it is 
noteworthy that Microsoft has a history of using threats and retaliation as a means to coerce OEMs to prefer Microsoft products 
over non-Microsoft products. See Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 68, P 236 (finding that Gateway's refusal to switch internal 
use to IE and stop shipping Navigator has resulted in the payment of higher prices for Windows by Gateway than its 
competitors), Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 59, P 203 (""Microsoft threatened to terminate the Windows license of any OEM 
that removed Microsoft's chosen icons and program entries from the Windows desktop or the 'Start' menu. It threatened similar 
punishment for OEMs that added programs that promoted third-party software to the Windows 'boot' sequence.""). "
1011,104," Mr. Mace acknowledged that Palm does not manufacture or distribute an Intel-compatible PC desktop operating system, nor 
any PC desktop operating system for that matter. Tr. at 1858-59 (Mace). Mr. Mace did not testify that Palm manufactured 
middleware with the potential to perform as a multi-purpose platform across multiple operating systems, nor that there exists 
middleware which enables applications written for a handheld device to run on a personal computer. See Memorandum Opinion, 
Part III.B.3.c. Instead, Mr. Mace argued that the handheld device has the capacity to supplant the personal computer as more 
applications become available on handheld devices. See generally Mace PP 12-18. As such replacement of products in the 
marketplace has not been shown to have an impact upon Microsoft's monopoly in the market for Intel-compatible PC desktop 
operating systems, what Mr. Mace describes is not true competition with the Windows operating system. See Memorandum 
Opinion, Parts III.B.3.c, III.C.3. "
1012,105," The Court observes that, notwithstanding Mr. Mace's assertions as to what should be deemed a ""personal computer,"" the 
definition of ""personal computer"" § VI.Q of Microsoft's proposed remedy is consistent with Judge Jackson's treatment of 
personal computers in this proceeding. See Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 12, PP 1, 3."
1012,106," Mr. Fama attempted to illustrate this fear by reference to Gateway's receipt, in a single day, of four notices of termination of a 
license agreement with Microsoft. Fama P 53; Pl. Exs. 1243-46 (all filed under seal). Mr. Fama's example is of limited relevance, 
as the notices of termination did not concern Windows or any part thereof, but instead concerned a separate Microsoft product. 
Tr. at 1260-62 (Fama). Moreover, the notices merely notified Gateway of its violation and demanded that Gateway cure the 
violation or face termination of the license. See Pl. Exs. 1243-46 (all filed under seal). Notably, Mr. Fama did not deny that 
Gateway, was in fact, in breach of the license, nor did Mr. Fama offer any evidence of bad faith on Microsoft's part in issuing the 
notices. Tr. at 1261-62 (Fama). Ultimately, no license was terminated as a result of the notices referenced by Mr. Fama. Id. at 
1262. "
1013,107," The Court observes that Mr. Fama's testimony refers only to a ""material breach,"" despite the fact that the comparable 
provision in Plaintiffs' remedy proposal, § 2.a, does not include any requirement of materiality, but instead requires ""good cause"" 
for termination. In this regard, Mr. Fama appears to have conflated the concept of ""good cause"" with the separate and distinct 
concept of a ""material breach."" This conflation is again reflected in Plaintiffs Proposed Findings of Fact. See, e.g., Pl. Prop. 
Findings of Fact P 410. The concept of ""good cause"" is broader than that of ""material breach."" For example, a company which 
discontinues a particular product line has ""good cause"" to terminate its supply contract, despite the absence of a ""material 
breach."" "
1014,108," Strikingly similar to § 11 of Plaintiffs' proposed remedy is § 6.a, which prohibits Microsoft from entering into agreements ""in 
which another party agrees, or is offered or granted consideration to . . . restrict its development, production, distribution, 
promotion or use of (including its freedom to set as a default), or payment for, any non-Microsoft product, service, feature or 
technology."" SPR § 6.a. Plaintiffs do not offer testimony which distinguishes the specific effect of § 6.a from § 11 in their 
proposed remedy. "
1016,109," Plaintiffs' remedy proposal uses the term ""redistributable code,"" but does not define the term. SPR § 6.b. ""Redistributable 
code"" is understood to be the code that Microsoft distributes separately from its Windows operating system in order to update 
portions of the operating system. See Tr. at 5166-67 (Jones). "
1018,110," Mr. Richards, of RealNetworks, asserts that § III.G.2 of Microsoft's proposed remedy is flawed because it does not extend its 
terms to software developers. Richards P 210. Mr. Richards argues that the provision would not stop Microsoft from offering an 
ISV placement on Windows for the ISV's software on the condition that it refrain from promoting middleware that competes with 
a Microsoft offering. Id. Mr. Richard's criticism, though technically accurate, ignores the fact that such agreements, because they 
condition consideration on refraining from supporting a competing product, would be prohibited pursuant to § III.F.2 of 
Microsoft's proposed remedy. See infra Part V.A; Tr. at 6753-54 (Elzinga). "
1020,111," Plaintiffs' computer science expert, Dr. Appel, coyly avoids the cloning issue by utilizing the term ""copy"" in his testimony. 
Appel PP 99-100. As a ""clone,"" meaning a replicate functionality, can be created in the absence of literal copying, Dr. Appel's 
selective word choice serves only to obscure the issue. "
1024,112," The disclosure provisions in Microsoft's remedy proposal, § III.D, would result in the documentation disclosure of some 
interfaces which are presently ""internal"" or undisclosed but plainly this disclosure would not be of a quantum comparable to that 
associated with Plaintiffs' remedy proposal. See Jones P 107. "
1027,113," The vast majority of Plaintiffs' criticisms of § 4 are rendered irrelevant by the Court's ruling regarding the scope of the remedy, 
see Memorandum Opinion, Part III.B-C. Plaintiffs offer one additional, very narrow criticism of § III.D of Microsoft's proposed 
remedy, however, which is not addressed by the Court's rulings on the issue of the scope of the remedy. This criticism rests 
upon the assertion that, at present, Microsoft will not be required to make disclosures of APIs relied upon by the most recent 
version of the Windows Media Player, which was included with Windows XP. Richards P 87. This criticism arises from the fact 
that, despite its inclusion in Microsoft's most recent version of the Windows operating system, Windows Media Player XP (also 
known as Windows Media Player 8.0) has not been distributed separately from Windows. As a result of the definition of 
""Microsoft Middleware,"" see Memorandum Opinion, Part III.B.2.a.iv, complain Plaintiffs, the APIs which permit ""Windows Media 
Player"" to interact with other portions of Windows do not fall within the API disclosure requirements in Microsoft's proposed 
remedy. In the Court's view, this criticism overstates the issue. The fact that Microsoft has not yet distributed Windows Media Player XP 
separately from Windows XP will not excuse Microsoft from providing API disclosures with regard to the APIs used by the 
separately distributed code from Windows Media Player 7.0 to interact with Windows 2000 Professional. As a factual matter, 
Windows Media Player XP uses essentially the same interfaces to interoperate with Windows XP that Windows Media Player 
7.0 uses to interoperate with Windows 2000 Professional. Poole P 75. Microsoft is already in the process of identifying those 
interfaces for disclosure. Id. Microsoft's Vice President of Media Platforms, Will Poole, id. P 1, testified that Microsoft will 
""distribute the next major version of [Windows Media Player], code-named the 'Corona player,' separately from the rest of the 
Windows operating system."" Id. P 76. The ""Corona player,"" which will be called Windows Media Player 9.0, is the successor to 
both Windows Media Player 7.0 and Windows Media Player XP. Id. Mr. Poole testified that the commercial release of Windows 
Media Player 9.0 will occur during the second half of this year. Id. By virtue of its separate distribution, the APIs relied upon by 
Windows Media Player 9.0 to interact with Windows would have to be disclosed pursuant to § III.D. Id. P 77. Based upon this 
testimony, there appears to be little, if any, impact flowing from the fact that Windows Media Player XP has not been distributed 
separately from Windows XP. "
1028,114," SBC Operations, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SBC Communications Inc. Pearson P 1"
1028,115, Plaintiffs' remedy contains no substantial counterpart to § III.J of the SRPFJ. 
1030,116," Judge Jackson explained network effects as follows: Consumer demand for Windows enjoys positive network effects. A positive network effect is a phenomenon by which the 
attractiveness of a product increases with the number of people using it. The fact that there is a multitude of people using 
Windows makes the product more attractive to consumers. The large installed base attracts corporate customers who want 
to use an operating system that new employees are already likely to know how to use, and it attracts academic consumers 
who want to use software that will allow them to share files easily with colleagues at other institutions. Findings of Fact,84 F. Supp. 2d at 20, P 39. The appellate court referred to this phenomenon as the ""chicken-andegg "" 
situation: ""This 'chicken-and-egg' situation ensures that applications will continue to be written for the already dominant 
Windows, which in turn ensures that consumers will continue to prefer it over other operating systems."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 
55. "
1031,117," ""Microsoft Office"" is software which provides an ""'office productivity suite,' which typically includes a word processor, a 
spreadsheet application, a database, and presentation software."" Tiemann P 86; see also  Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 73."
1031,118," Other witnesses testifying on behalf of Plaintiffs contend that the release of IE into the public domain will ensure that Microsoft 
does not use its control over the browser market to control other technology markets, such as the market for Web services. 
Schwartz P 159; Pearson PP 10, 48, 96 (asserting that § 12 of Plaintiffs' proposed remedy ""ensures"" that Microsoft will not 
""modify IE by adding proprietary or other non-disclosed protocols or extensions in such a way that they would prevent or 
degrade interoperability with non-Microsoft server operating systems.""). These assertions reflect an attempt to argue either a 
new attempted monopolization claim or the previously court-rejected ""monopoly-leveraging"" theory of liability by extending that 
""leveraging"" argument to emerging areas of technology. United States v. Microsoft Corp., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14231, 1998 
WL 614485 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1998), at *26-28. The Court therefore declines to enter factual findings relating to this testimony on 
the grounds that it is irrelevant. See Memorandum Opinion, Parts III.B.3.d, III.C.4; III.D. "
1032,119," Mr. Tiemann testified further that the divestiture of IE was an appropriate kind ""justice"" because, ""Microsoft never had the 
right to the intellectual property of the dominant browser; they secured the rights to the dominant browser through illegal tactics."" 
Tiemann P 113. Mr. Tiemann argued that ""Microsoft should not be heard to complain when restoring the right to the dominant 
browser to the community."" Id. Mr. Tiemann's position in this regard is unsupported. Mr. Tiemann does not offer or identify any 
empirical evidence which quantifies the success of IE and attributes that success to Microsoft's violations of § 2 of the Sherman 
Act. Contrary to Mr. Tiemann's unsupported implication, the precise factors which led to IE's present success are unclear on the 
existing record. See Findings of Fact, 84 F. Supp. 2d at 98, P 358. At a minimum, the present record belies this attempt to 
attribute IE's success entirely or predominantly to Microsoft's illegal conduct. Id."
1032,120," In this regard, the Court observes that if Microsoft Office is truly the ""albatross around Red Hat's neck,"" Tiemann P 87, it 
appears it is so largely because of Red Hat's own business decisions. Tr. at 1034-35 (Tiemann). "
1033,121," Moreover, Plaintiffs did not offer any testimony in the remedy phase to establish that IE was the ""fruit"" of the anticompetitive 
conduct affirmed by the appellate court. See, e.g., Tr. at 3596 (Shapiro) (""I understand a significant-a component of how-why it's 
in the remedy is under the notion of denying Microsoft the fruits of its illegal activity, and I'm not addressing that part of it, and I'm 
discussing how I think it will affect competition going forward.""). "
1036,122," As the Court observed previously, see Memorandum Opinion, Part III.B.2.b, Plaintiffs' proposed remedy defines middleware 
very broadly, such that virtually any block of software code which exposes an API constitutes middleware. "
1038,123," The colloquy proceeded as follows: Q. (by Plaintiffs' Counsel Mr. Hodges): Could you explain what ways in your opinion Microsoft could comply with Section 1 
of the States' proposed remedy? A. (by Plaintiffs' computer science expert Dr. Appel): One way is to simply let the Microsoft middleware product be 
removable. Another way is to let subcomponents of the Microsoft middleware products be removable. The States remedy doesn't 
require that, but it permits that. And then in the case of, for example, MS HTML, the rendering engine the subcomponent of 
the browser, an OEM might choose to leave that component in even if they want to substitute a different browser, and then 
there's no chance of degradation of the functionality of other components that depend on that HTML rendering. Another option, as I have explained, is to take necessary fragments of functionality and embed them in other products, 
other than Microsoft middleware products, so they don't expose APIs. Another kind of way to comply is just to reduce the inherent commingling, or I should say interdependence between the 
Microsoft middleware products. This would be not really a mechanical engineering task; one requiring some design to make 
the Microsoft middleware products a little less dependent on each other, and Microsoft might choose to do this, for 
example, if it doesn't like the other options because it doesn't want to be dependent for functionality on a non-Microsoft 
substitute. Tr. at 3208-09 (Appel). "
1039,124," Dr. Bennett estimated ""conservatively"" that § 1 of Plaintiffs' proposed remedy would produce more than a thousand variants 
of Microsoft's PC operating system due to the fact that each OEM could choose a different combination of middleware 
components. Bennett PP 47, 55; accord Gates P 200-01."
1039,125," Plaintiffs, of course, ignore Microsoft's view of its own products and insist that because Windows is sold as an ""operating 
system,"" any ""middleware"" functionality which accompanies that sale is extraneous and can be removed without creating a 
different version of ""Windows."" From Plaintiffs' perspective then, the addition or removal of Microsoft's middleware products still 
leaves the ""operating system""-plus or minus a Microsoft middleware product that, like any other application, can be added or 
removed. Tr. at 422-24 (Barksdale)."
1039,126," ""Backward compatibility"" can be understood to mean that the APIs that are exposed by older versions of Windows are also 
supported by the new Windows versions. Tr. at 5093 (Jones). "
1041,127," Defendant presented additional unrebutted evidence that server vendors would be harmed by the fragmentation which would 
result from Plaintiffs' unbinding proposal. Richard Ulmer, a Vice President of Unisys Corporation, a provider of server and server-
related products, Ulmer PP 1, 7, testified that interoperation between clients and servers will be severely hindered as a result of 
the removal of code from the Windows operating system. Id. PP 29-32. "
1044,128," Section 9 of Plaintiffs' proposed remedy also bans adverse action against participants in the suit instituted by the United 
States, United States v. Microsoft, No. 98-1232 (D.D.C.)."
1044,129," Plaintiffs offer the testimony of Mr. Fama, who recounted that he perceived Microsoft to be unhappy about Gateway's 
participation in this litigation. Fama PP 144-46. Mr. Fama offered the strained opinion that a refusal by a Microsoft employee to 
engage in a particular discussion out of fear that it might find its way into the courts was a threat. Id. The Court is not convinced 
that the circumstances described by Mr. Fama reflect a threat of retaliation by Microsoft. "
1045,130," The Court similarly rejects the contention that distribution of the JVM through Microsoft is imperative because it is 
impracticable for OEMs to distribute the technology and similarly impracticable for end users to download the technology from 
the Internet. Green PP 104-05. Far more persuasive is Dr. Allchin's testimony explaining that ""it is fairly common today to have 
software programs of the same general size as a JVM downloaded in huge numbers."" Allchin P 77; see also Elzinga P 121; Tr. 
at 293 (Green) (""[A] compressed JVM with associated class libraries typically ranges from 5 to 12 megabytes in size.""). Once 
downloaded, a user would not incur any further delay in using the JVM. Allchin P 77. Similarly, Mr. Green's conclusion that it is 
infeasible to depend on OEMs for distribution is unsupported. Green P 105. Rather than infeasibility, the evidence establishes 
that Sun does not consider it worthwhile to attempt to obtain distribution through the OEM channel and would prefer, instead, to 
use this litigation as a means by which to obtain ubiquity. Tr. at 295-97 (Green); see also Green PP 10506 . Lastly, Mr. Green 
takes the view that OEMs have little incentive to distribute a Suncompliant JVM. Green P 105. The Court finds this complaint to 
be meritless, as a lack of incentive to distribute a particular product reflects a problem of a competitor, not a problem with 
competition. Allchin P 79. "
1046,131," CLR stands for ""Common-Language Runtime."" Green P 118. Like Java, the CLR is a type of ""component-software 
middleware"" developed by Microsoft. Appel PP 44, 74-75. CLR is part of Microsoft's .NET framework. Madnick P 163."
1046,132," Mr. Green further relies upon the claim that OEMs fear retaliation by Microsoft for distribution of a competing platform. Green 
P 105. Given that both of the proposed remedies in this case address such retaliation, the potential for retaliation should not 
continue to be a concern."
1046,133," In his testimony, Dr. Elzinga warned that the Court must guard against ""rent-seeking"" by Microsoft's competitors. Elzinga P 
16. ""Rent-seeking in economics,"" according to Dr. Elzinga, applies to ""activities by economic agents (individuals or firms) that do 
not create value, but only influence how existing rewards are distributed."" Id. Section 13 is an example of such ""rent seeking"" by "
1047,," Sun Microsystems. Elzinga P 56 and Table 3. Sun proposed inclusion of a remedy nearly identical to § 13 of Plaintiffs' proposed 
remedy. Def. Ex. 841 at Sn-R025963-64, 025966-69. Sun is presently seeking the same remedy in a private lawsuit filed against 
Microsoft. Tr. at 170 (Green). Sun stands to benefit significantly by the imposition of § 13 of Plaintiffs' proposed remedy. Id. at 
201. Indeed, Sun has ""repeatedly offered Microsoft the opportunity to distribute a compatible, current JRE as part of its browser 
and operating system products, [and] Microsoft has refused."" Green P 19. Given these facts, there is little doubt that § 13 
reflects the wish of a particular Microsoft competitor, the granting of which is likely to ""have very little effect"" upon the 
""development of cross-platform middleware."" Tr. at 3614 (Shapiro). As such, the Court regards § 13 of Plaintiffs' proposed 
remedy as an unjustified manipulation of the marketplace. Sun's request for redress in this regard is best resolved, if at all, 
through its already-pending private lawsuit. "
1048,134," The Court notes that § 16 of Plaintiffs' remedy proposal is not limited in any way to reflect the relevant market in this case. 
SPR § 16. Rather, the provision applies to all segments of Microsoft's business. Id. "
1049,135," Plaintiffs fail to offer any evidence that any such ""regulatory authorities"" are interested in receiving information from Microsoft 
pursuant to the Court's remedial order in this case, nor that the provision of information would prove useful to such regulatory 
authorities."
1049,136," In response to criticism of § 20 by Mr. Gates, Plaintiffs, in their proposed findings of fact suggest that the provision could be 
modified to limit the reporting requirements to investments ""in an amount larger than 1% of the target company"" and that the 
reporting requirement could exempt from reporting ""the acquisition of inventory acquired in the normal course of business."" Pl. 
Prop. Finding of Fact PP 1432-33. While helpful, these modifications do not cure the most significant defect related to § 20 of 
Plaintiffs' remedy; namely, that there exists no justification for including in the remedy a requirement that Microsoft report its 
investment activity. There remains no logical relationship between Microsoft's investment activity and the findings of liability in 
this case, nor have Plaintiffs established that such reporting will benefit competition. "
1065,1," In the former companion case, State of New York, et al. v. Microsoft Corp., the States of New York, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin have entered into a conditional settlement with Microsoft as to the 
issue of remedy. Those Plaintiff States-""Settling States""-are awaiting approval by this Court of the settlement in this case before 
entry of the settlement in State of New York, et al v. Microsoft Corp. pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure. Because the proposed final judgment addresses the Settling States as well as the United States in its terms, the 
Court, where appropriate, refers to both the United States and the Settling States as ""Plaintiffs"" in this Memorandum Opinion. "
1066,2," Pursuant to the stipulation filed with the Court on November 6, 2001, Microsoft began complying with portions of the proposed 
final judgment on December 16, 2001, as if ""it were in full force and effect."" Stipulation at 2. On August 28, 2002, the United 
States submitted a ""Notice"" to the Court advising ""the Court of Microsoft's compliance with various milestones established by the 
Second Revised Proposed Final Judgment ('SRPFJ')."" Notice at 1 (Aug. 28, 2002). In general terms, the Notice indicates that 
Microsoft is in compliance with its requirements and ""takes seriously its obligations under the SRPFJ."" Id. at 7. "
1068,3," The Court notes that the objective of ""terminating the illegal monopoly,"" United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 391 U.S. 
244, 250, 20 L. Ed. 2d 562, 88 S. Ct. 1496 (1968), is incompatible with the facts of this case. Neither the district court, nor the 
appellate court concluded that Microsoft had unlawfully obtained its monopoly. See  Microsoft, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 
34; Microsoft, 87 F. Supp. 2d 30; see also  Microsoft, 56 F.3d at 1452 (observing in the precursor to this case that ""the 
government did not allege and does not contend-and this is of crucial significance to this case-that Microsoft obtained its alleged 
monopoly position in violation of the antitrust laws"") (emphasis in original). Moreover, as noted by the appellate court, ""the 
District Court expressly did not adopt the position that Microsoft would have lost its position in the OS market but for its 
anticompetitive behavior."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 107 (citing Findings of Fact P 411). In this context, outright termination of the 
monopoly is a questionable remedial goal, as such action would exceed the limits of the controversy presented to the Court. 
Accordingly, the Court's inquiry into the extent to which the proposed consent decree ""terminates the illegal monopoly,"" United 
Shoe, 391 U.S. at 250, will be limited, and the Court will instead focus upon terminating the illegal maintenance of the monopoly. "
1069,4," In referring to ""Plaintiffs"" throughout this Memorandum Opinion, the Court refers to the United States, as well as the Plaintiff 
States in Civ. No. 98-1233, who entered into a settlement agreement with Microsoft. See supra note 1. The Court notes, 
however, that the appellate court's opinion applies not only to the claims brought by the United States and the Settling States, 
but also to those states who have opted to litigate the issue of remedy in State of New York, et al. v. Microsoft, No. 98-1233 
(D.D.C.)."
1069,5," ""PC"" is short for ""personal computer."" Findings of Fact P 1."
1069,6," The appellate court, relying upon the factual testimony presented to the district court, explained the functions of a PC operating 
system: Operating systems perform many functions, including allocating computer memory and controlling peripherals such as 
printers and keyboards. Operating systems also function as platforms for software applications. They do this by ""exposing""-
i.e., making available to software developers-routines or protocols that perform certain widely-used functions. These are 
known as Application Programming Interfaces, or ""APIs."" For example, Windows contains an API that enables users to 
draw a box on the screen. Software developers wishing to include that function in an application need not duplicate it in 
their own code. Instead, they can ""call""-i.e., use-the Windows API. Windows contains thousands of APIs, controlling 
everything from data storage to font display. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 53 (citations omitted)."
1069,7," ""In 1985, Microsoft began shipping a software package [for the PC] called Windows. The product included a graphical user 
interface, which enabled users to perform tasks by selecting icons and words on the screen using a mouse."" Findings of Fact P 
7. In 1995, Microsoft introduced an updated version of its Windows software known as ""Windows 95."" Id. P 8. Similarly, in 1998, 
Microsoft released ""Windows 98."" Id. Since that time, Microsoft has continued to update, revise, and re-create its ""Windows"" PC 
operating system."
1069,8,"  ""APIs"" are applications programming interfaces. As Judge Jackson explained: [An] operating system supports the functions 
of applications by exposing interfaces, called ""application programming interfaces,"" or ""APIs."" These are synapses at which 
the developer of an application can connect to invoke pre-fabricated blocks of code in the operating system. These blocks 
of code in turn perform crucial tasks, such as displaying text on the computer screen. "
1070,, Findings of Fact P 2.
1070,9," Such software takes the name ""middleware"" because ""it relies on the interfaces provided by the underlying operating system 
while simultaneously exposing its own APIs to developers"" and, therefore, is said to reside in the middle. Findings of Fact P 28."
1070,10," ""Although certain Web browsers provided graphical user interfaces as far back as 1993, the first widely-popular graphical 
browser distributed for profit, called Navigator, was brought to market by the Netscape Communications Corporation ('Netscape') 
in December 1994."" Findings of Fact P 17. "
1071,11," Manufacturers of PCs are known as ""original equipment manufacturers"" or ""OEMs."" Findings of Fact P 10."
1071,12," ""The Active Desktop was a Microsoft feature that, if enabled, allowed the Windows user to position Web pages as open 
windows that appear on the background, or 'wallpaper' of the Windows desktop."" Findings of Fact P 314."
1071,13, Internet Explorer is Microsoft's Web browser. Findings of Fact P 17. 
1072,14," ""PCs typically connect to the Internet through the services of Internet access providers ('IAPs'), which generally charge 
subscription fees to their customers in the United States."" Findings of Fact P 15. "
1073,15," ""The Java technologies include: (1) a programming language; (2) a set of programs written in that language, called the 'Java 
class libraries,' which expose APIs; (3) a compiler, which translates code written by a developer into 'bytecode'; and (4) a Java 
Virtual Machine ('JVM'), which translates bytecode into instructions to the operating system. [Findings of Fact] P 73. Programs 
calling upon the Java APIs will run on any machine with a 'Java runtime environment,' ['JRE'] that is, Java class libraries and a 
JVM. Id. PP 73, 74."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 74. The terms ""JRE"" and ""JVM"" are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to the 
Java platform. The court uses the term JVM throughout this Memorandum Opinion for that purpose. "
1074,16," Plaintiffs' complaint also included a separate claim of ""monopoly leveraging"" under § 2 of the Sherman Act. Judge Jackson 
granted summary judgment in favor of Microsoft as to this claim on the grounds that the theory runs ""contrary to both economic 
theory and the Sherman Act's plain language."" United States v. Microsoft, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14231, 1998 WL 614485, at * 
27 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1998)."
1074,17," Plaintiffs' tying claim alleged that ""Microsoft's contractual and technological bundling of the IE Web browser (the 'tied' product) 
with its Windows operating system ('OS') (the 'tying' product) resulted in a tying arrangement that was per se unlawful."" 
Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 84. "
1076,18," ""Covered OEMs"" is a defined term. Pursuant to § VI.D, ""'Covered OEMs' means the 20 OEMs with the highest worldwide 
volume of licenses of Windows Operating System Products reported to Microsoft in Microsoft's fiscal year preceding the effective 
date of the Final Judgment."" SRPFJ § VI.D. "
1078,19," Trademarked is defined in the SRPFJ to have the following meaning: distributed in commerce and identified as distributed by a name other than Microsoft (R) or Windows (R) that Microsoft has 
claimed as a trademark or service mark by (i) marking the name with trademark notices, such as (R) or TM, in connection 
with a product distributed in the United States; (ii) filing an application for trademark protection for the name in the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office; or (iii) asserting the name as a trademark in the United States in a demand letter or 
lawsuit. Any product distributed under descriptive or generic terms or a name comprised of the Microsoft (R) or Windows 
(R) trademarks together with descriptive or generic terms shall not be Trademarked as that term is used in this Final 
Judgment. Microsoft hereby disclaims any trademark rights in such descriptive or generic terms apart from the Microsoft (R) 
or Windows (R) trademarks, and hereby abandons any such rights that it may acquire in the future. SRPFJ § VI.T. "
1079,20," The SRPFJ defines ""Non-Microsoft Middleware"" as a non-Microsoft software product running on a Windows Operating System Product (i) that exposes a range of functionality 
to ISVs through published APIs, and that could, if ported to or made interoperable with, a non-Microsoft Operating System, 
thereby make it easier for applications that rely in whole or in part on the functionality supplied by that software product to 
be ported to or run on that non-Microsoft Operating System, and (ii) of which at least one million copies were distributed in 
the United States within the previous year. SRPFJ § VI.N. "
1080,21," In the Findings of Fact, Judge Jackson noted that Intel is both an IHV and an ISV. Findings of Fact P 95 (""Although Intel is 
engaged principally in the design and manufacture of microprocessors, it also develops some software."")."
1080,22," However, Microsoft may establish a two tiered discount schedule, one for the ten largest Covered OEMs, and another for the 
eleventh through the twentieth Covered OEMs. SRPFJ § III.B.3.a. "
1088,23," Any such condemnation would likely be reflected in the imposition of liability for illegal tying, rather than liability for illegal for 
monopoly maintenance. Cf. generally  United States v. Microsoft Corp., 331 U.S. App. D.C. 121, 147 F.3d 935 (D.C. Cir. 1998). 
Such a tying claim was offered by Plaintiffs pursuant to a per se analysis and was ultimately rejected by the appellate court.  
Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 89. "
1089,24," An ""IHV"" is an ""independent hardware vendor that develops hardware to be included in or used with a Personal Computer 
running a Windows Operating System Product."" SRPFJ § VI.H."
1089,25," In contrast, the appellate court declined to find Microsoft liable for entering into similar deals with ICPs on the grounds that 
Plaintiffs ""failed to demonstrate that Microsoft's deals with the ICPs have a substantial effect upon competition."" Microsoft, 253 
F.3d at 71."
1089,26," Although identified as an OEM in the appellate court's opinion, the Court observes that Apple does not fit into the definition of 
OEM provided in the SRPFJ because it does not license Microsoft's operating system product. SRPFJ § VI.O. The Court 
remains unconcerned by this fact because the protections afforded to OEMs concern their licensing of Windows, and therefore, "
1090,," it would make little sense to include Apple within the purview of these protections. See, e.g., SRPFJ § III.A-C, H. Moreover, 
Apple appropriately receives protections afforded to ISVs. Id. §§ III.D, F-G, I and VI.I."
1090,27," The proposed consent decree's prohibition on exclusive or fixed-percentage agreements extends beyond the specific findings 
of liability to apply to ICPs and IHVs. This extension is appropriate, as ""the public does not suffer because [the defendant] 
consented to limitations on its activities that could not otherwise be imposed."" Bechtel, 648 F.2d at 666. "
1092,28, Section III.F.1 is discussed supra Part III.B.1.c. 
1097,29," During the public comment period, some entities lodged complaints about RPFJ § III.I.5, which required a cross-license of 
certain intellectual property rights. In response, the United States and Microsoft agreed to amend § III.I to remove subsection I.5 
in its entirety. Compare SRPFJ § III.I, with RPFJ § III.I. "
1101,30," The SRPFJ provides this power equally to the United States and the Settling States but requires that the States shall consult 
first with the ""States' enforcement committee to minimize the duplication and burden of the exercise of [such] powers, where 
practicable."" SRPFJ § IV.A. "
1114,1," Effective June 8, 1995, the patent laws were amended to change the term of a patent from seventeen years measured from the 
date the patent issued to twenty years measured from the filing date of the earliest U.S. application for which priority benefit is 
claimed. Applications that were filed on or after June 8, 1995 have a twenty year term measured from the date of filing. All 
patents that were in force on June 8, 1995, or that issued on an application that was filed before June 8, 1995, have a term that 
is the greater of the twenty year term or seventeen years from the patent grant.  35 U.S.C. § 154(c)(1) (2000). The '921 patent 
was filed on April 23, 1979, claimed priority to a divisional application filed on May 10, 1978, and issued on February 17, 1981. 
Thus, the '921 patent expired on May 10, 1998, not April 23, 1999 as Pingel's attorney incorrectly advised. "
1115,2," In making this determination, the district court excluded portions of Golan's declaration as hearsay and for lack of foundation, 
and excluded Exhibit B to Golan's declaration on these grounds as well as failure to produce previously the document in 
discovery."
1115,3," The district court declined to grant Pingel's motion for summary judgment regarding the trademark claim but, subsequently, the 
parties stipulated to dismissal without prejudice of Pingel's trademark counterclaims and of Golan's claim for declaratory 
judgment of noninfringement of Pingel's trademark. The district court ultimately ordered the trademark claims dismissed without 
prejudice. Although the district court did not provide a Rule 54(b) certification or other entry of final judgment, this case appears 
to satisfy the final judgment rule. HN1[
] This court applies the law of the pertinent regional circuit, here the Ninth Circuit, to 
determine whether the district court's entry was final relative to all pending issues. See  CAE Screenplates Inc. v. Heinrich 
Fiedler GMBH & Co., 224 F.3d 1308, 1314-15, 55 USPQ2d 1804, 1808 (Fed. Cir. 2000). HN2[
] The Ninth Circuit recently 
issued an opinion that expressly approved of the exercise of jurisdiction ""in a situation indistinguishable from ours,"" in which the 
Sixth Circuit held ""that appellate jurisdiction exists where plaintiff, with the district court's permission, dismissed without prejudice 
the remaining claims in order to make the judgment appealable."" James v. Price Stern Sloan, Inc., 283 F.3d 1064, 1069 (9th Cir. 
2002) (citing Hicks v. NLO, Inc., 825 F.2d 118, 120 (6th Cir. 1987)). "
1118,4," This determination renders harmless any abuse of discretion the district court might have committed in excluding Golan's 
evidence regarding the flow rate of the filter element itself. "
1120,5," We do not place much weight on the fact that Pingel did not intend to sue Rivera, its customer, for patent infringement, as 
HN21[
] a decision not to sue one's own customers is not particularly probative of bad faith conduct. "
1123,1," Corporate officers or directors are generally personally liable for all torts which they authorize or direct or participate in, and a 
showing of intent or bad faith is not required to prove liability under §1114. (Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Repeat-O-Type Stencil 
Manufacturing Corp., et al., 1995 W.L. 552168 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (sustaining summary judgment against a corporation's president 
and majority stockholder, where the undisputed facts indicated that he was involved and participated in the conduct giving rise to 
the corporation's trademark infringement liability). Therefore, the Court will not discuss Paravar's liability separately from that of 
Zeotec Diamonds, Inc. "
1124,2," In SUF ¶ 47, Zeotec denies substituting a non-genuine bracelet clasp, but does not deny other allegations regarding non-
genuine components. Furthermore, Zeotec's response that ""Rolex does not make diamonds and the claim to ""genuine"" Rolex "
1125,," diamonds is meaningless"", ignores as Rolex points out - that Rolex defined non-genuine components as components not 
authorized by Rolex in SUF ¶ 44."
1125,3," Zeotec's only response to this and other allegations of non-genuine parts, except as otherwise noted, was that ""Rolex"" does not 
make diamonds and the claim to ""genuine"" diamonds is meaningless. However, they did not provide any factual support for this 
assertion or appear to address Rolex's defining non-genuine to mean ""components not authorized by Rolex."" Thus, these facts 
will be deemed undisputed. "
1126,4, Zeotec disputes Rolex's allegations that they use a non-genuine dial place and cite to Paravar's Decl. ¶ 9. 
1127,5," This price is from the SUF ¶ 76, the GIMF erroneously reported that the comparable price was $7,750, but declared that SUF ¶ 
76 undisputed. "
1149,1," Also included with Woman's Clinic are the individual physicians who own and operate Woman's Clinic. These physicians will 
hereinafter be collectively referred to as ""plaintiff physicians"". "
1151,2, St. John's also purchased the Thomas D. McClain Orthopedic Surgery Center. 
1152,3," Count III alleges that St. John's has violated Missouri's antitrust laws found at Mo. Rev. Stat. § 416.031. HN5[
] Missouri's 
antitrust laws are almost identical the Sherman Antitrust Act, hence the reasoning of all federal antitrust cases will be equally 
applicable to state claims. "
1153,4, The Business Covenant is also the subject of Counts II and III and will be discussed more fully below. 
1154,5," Some of the contracts were terminable upon twenty days notice, others upon ninety days notice."
1154,6," Woman's Clinic asserts it has factually disputed the ability to terminate the contracts and has shown that contracts are de facto 
long term contracts because of automatic renewal provisions and because few payors actually terminate their contracts with St. 
John's. Woman's Clinic argues that several additional factual disputes preclude summary judgment. Though perhaps disputed, 
these facts are not material. It is true the contracts with St. John's and the payors automatically renew, unless terminated. The 
simple fact is that payors have the power to terminate contracts if they feel such action is warranted. Whether payors have or 
have not terminated or switched is not a material dispute. Even if no payors have ever switched, that does not establish any 
harm to competition. In fact, it likely suggests the opposite; that competition is keeping payors satisfied. "
1155,7," In his report, Dr. Lagenfeld used OB-GYN physician data from a 21-county region around Springfield. This accounted for 48 
OB-GYN physicians. Three of those 48 physicians are not in the 12-county area being used as the relevant geographic market. 
Of those three, two had affiliation with Cox, and the other was, presumably, affiliated elsewhere. In the end, this difference only 
effected the total number of physicians and not the number of St. John's physicians used to calculate the percent of OB-GYN 
physicians affiliated with St. John's"
1155,8," Woman's Clinic asserts that the Cox network is closed to the plaintiff physicians, and therefore all the market is foreclosed. The 
fact that some plaintiff physicians have applied and been turned down by Cox does not mean the network is closed. It only 
means that the Cox network has no need for more OB-GYN physicians."
1155,9," Because Woman's Clinic has devoted so much of its case to tying the conduct of the Cox network into this lawsuit, it bears 
repeating once more: the conduct of Cox is irrelevant. When one player in any given market begins to consolidate downstream 
distributors into a network, it is only natural that the other players in the market follow suit. Where antitrust becomes concerned 
is when upstream and downstream competition is cut off. In this case, there is upstream competition between Cox and St. John's 
for payor contracts. There is also downstream competition for physician referrals within the two respective networks. While 
Woman's Clinic disputes whether the competition is ""vigorous"" the fact is that Cox and St. John's are competitors for the same 
market of payor contracts. If anything has been ""vigorous"" is Woman's Clinic's attempt to obfuscate this matter by bombarding 
the Court with pounds of arguably irrelevant information. Plaintiff physicians should heed the following well: HN10[
] antitrust is 
concerned with the protection of competition, not individual competitors. Ryko, 823 F.2d at 1234. "
1157,10," Thus summary judgment is also granted in favor of St. John's to the extent Woman's Clinic claimed the Business Covenant 
was an alleged restraint on trade in Count I. "
1158,11," The Court asks, perhaps not so rhetorically, is that not the function of all non-compete agreements? To say that a covenant 
not to compete is invalid because it prohibits future competition would be to invalidate every single non-compete agreement ever 
entered into, without regard to reasonableness or legitimate interests. "
1170,1, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 1999-2000 version unless otherwise noted. 
1171,2," HN2[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 100.30(3) provides in full: (3) Illegality of loss leaders. Any sale of any item of merchandise either by a retailer, wholesaler, wholesaler of motor vehicle fuel 
or refiner, at less than cost as defined in this section with the intent or effect of inducing the purchase of other merchandise or of 
unfairly diverting trade from a competitor, impairs and prevents fair competition, injures public welfare and is unfair competition 
and contrary to public policy and the policy of this section. Such sales are prohibited. Evidence of any sale of any item of 
merchandise by any retailer, wholesaler, wholesaler of motor vehicle fuel or refiner at less than cost as defined in this section 
shall be prima facie evidence of intent or effect to induce the purchase of other merchandise, or to unfairly divert trade from a 
competitor, or to otherwise injure a competitor. The policy underlying the Act is expressly stated in HN3[
] Wis. Stat. § 100.30(1): Unfair sales act. (1) Policy. The practice of selling certain items of merchandise below cost in order to attract patronage is 
generally a form of deceptive advertising and an unfair method of competition in commerce. Such practice causes commercial 
dislocations, misleads the consumer, works back against the farmer, directly burdens and obstructs commerce, and diverts 
business from dealers who maintain a fair price policy. Bankruptcies among merchants who fail because of the competition of 
those who use such methods result in unemployment, disruption of leases, and nonpayment of taxes and loans, and contribute 
to an inevitable train of undesirable consequences, including economic depression."
1171,3," HN5[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 100.30(2)(am)lm.b and c provide:"
1171,1," m. With respect to the sale of motor vehicle fuel, ""cost to retailer"" means the following: …. b. In the case of the retail sale of motor vehicle fuel by a wholesaler of motor vehicle fuel, who is not a refiner, at a retail station 
owned or operated either directly or indirectly by the wholesaler of motor vehicle fuel, the invoice cost of the motor vehicle fuel to 
the wholesaler of motor vehicle fuel within 10 days prior to the date of sale, or the replacement cost of the motor vehicle fuel, 
whichever is lower, less all trade discounts except customary discounts for cash, plus any excise, sales or use taxes imposed on 
the motor vehicle fuel or on its sale, and any cost incurred for transportation and any other charges not otherwise included in the 
invoice cost or replacement cost of the motor vehicle fuel, plus a markup of 9.18 of that amount to cover a proportionate part of 
the cost of doing business; or the average posted terminal price at the terminal located closest to the retail station plus a markup 
of 9.18 of the average posted terminal price to cover a proportionate part of the cost of doing business; whichever is greater. c. In the case of the retail sale of motor vehicle fuel by a person other than a refiner or a wholesaler of motor vehicle fuel at a 
retail station, the invoice cost of the motor vehicle fuel to the retailer within 10 days prior to the date of sale, or the replacement 
cost of the motor vehicle fuel, whichever is lower, less all trade discounts except customary discounts for cash, plus any excise, 
sales or use taxes imposed on the motor vehicle fuel or on its sale and any cost incurred for transportation and any other 
charges not otherwise included in the invoice cost or the replacement cost of the motor vehicle fuel, plus a markup of 6 of that 
amount to cover a proportionate part of the cost of doing business; or the average posted terminal price at the terminal located 
closest to the retailer plus a markup of 9.18 of the average posted terminal price to cover a proportionate part of the cost of 
doing business; whichever is greater."
1171,4," ""Terminal"" is defined as the ""storage and distribution facility that is supplied by a pipeline or marine vessels, from which facility 
motor vehicle fuel may be removed at a rack and from which facility at least 3 refiners or wholesalers of motor vehicle fuel sell 
motor vehicle fuel."" Wis. Stat. § 100.30(2)(j). "
1172,5," HN6[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 100.30(2)(a) provides: (2)(a) ""Average posted terminal price"" means the average posted rack price, as published by a petroleum price reporting 
service, at which motor vehicle fuel is offered for sale at the close of business on the determination date by all refiners and 
wholesalers of motor vehicle fuel at a terminal plus any excise, sales or use taxes imposed on the motor vehicle fuel or on its 
sale, any cost incurred for transportation and any other charges that are not otherwise included in the average posted rack price. 
In this paragraph, ""average"" means the arithmetic mean. HN7[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 100.30(2)(cg) defines ""determination date"" as: (cg) 1. Except as provided in subd. 2., ""determination date"" is the day preceding the day of the sale at retail of motor vehicle fuel."
1172,6," Under the invoice/replacement formula, one starts with the invoice cost within ten days of the sale or replacement cost, 
whichever is lower, deducts specified discounts, and adds taxes, transportation, other charges not already included, and a 
markup to cover the cost of doing business-6 for a retailer and 9.18 for a wholesaler. Wis. Stat. § 100.30(2)(am)1m.b and c."
1172,7, The complaint alleged other claims that Gross is not pursuing. 
1173,8, Private causes of action must be brought within 180 days of the violation.  Wis. Stat. § 100.30(5m).
1173,9," From here on, we use ""Gross"" to refer to both plaintiffs unless the context indicates otherwise. "
1174,10," The ten-day window relates to the ""determination date,"" which affects the ATP price. See Wis. Stat. § 100.30(2)(c)2(cg)."
1174,11," The figures he used changed during three time periods, which he identified, and were: for gasoline, 48.8 cents, 49.2 cents, 
and 49.8 cents, and for diesel fuel, 55.1 cents, 55.5 cents, and 56.1 cents. "
1175,12," Woodman's also objected to certain of Gross's statements as legal conclusions, and the circuit court agreed with Woodman's 
and did not consider them. For reasons that are not clear to us, Woodman's renews these objections on appeal. We do not 
discuss them further because the circuit court correctly did not consider Gross's legal conclusions in deciding whether Gross's 
submissions established a prima facie factual case, and we do not either.  Hooper v. City of Madison, 79 Wis. 2d 120, 130, 
256 N.W.2d 139 (1977) (HN13[
] court is to disregard conclusions of law contained in affidavits on motion for summary 
judgment). Woodman's challenged other submissions of Gross in the circuit court, which it renews on appeal: the affidavits of 
Kevin LeRoy, Joseph Veenstra, Paul Dingee, and Michael Stoker (paragraph 17 of his January 2001 affidavit). We do not 
discuss these objections because these submissions are not necessary to our analysis."
1175,13," Sparta Co-op Services is Woodman's fuel supplier and is not relevant to this appeal; we identify the documents in this way for 
ease of reference. "
1176,14," The court added that the later affidavit of Joseph Veenstra contained the certification necessary to authenticate the DATCP 
documents. However, that certification was of other DATCP records, which are not relevant to our analysis. See footnote 12."
1176,15," HN14[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 910.06 provides: Summaries. The contents of voluminous writings, recordings or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in court 
may be presented in the form of a chart, summary or calculation. The originals, or duplicates, shall be made available for 
examination or copying, or both, by other parties at a reasonable time and place. The judge may order that they be produced in 
court."
1176,16," At the hearing before the circuit court, counsel for Woodman's explained that the calculations on the copies of Sparta 
documents that Wysocki submitted with his affidavit were added in response to the litigation to explain what Wysocki had done 
when he set the prices. The court stated that, in deciding whether any of Woodman's business records arguably met the ""meets 
competition exception,"" it would not consider that set of copies, but only the set of copies Woodman's produced in discovery, 
which Gross had submitted with his supplemental affidavit."
1176,17," The court arrived at these dates by eliminating from the chart Gross filed: (1) days on which Woodman's did not sell diesel 
fuel; (2) days on which Woodman's sold only ethanol-blend fuel; (3) days on which any of Woodman's service records had a 
notation of another competitor's fuel price; (4) days when there was incomplete data on Gross's chart; (5) March 8 through 
March 14 where a factual dispute exists over Woodman's motor vehicle fuel price; and (6) Christmas Day, when Woodman's 
was not open for business. "
1177,18," HN15[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 100.30(5m) provides: (5m) Private cause of action. Any person who is injured or threatened with injury as a result of a sale or purchase of motor 
vehicle fuel in violation of sub. (3) may bring an action against the person who violated sub. (3) for temporary or permanent 
injunctive relief or an action against the person for 3 times the amount of any monetary loss sustained or an amount equal to $ 
2,000, whichever is greater, multiplied by each day of continued violation, together with costs, including accounting fees and 
reasonable attorney fees, notwithstanding s. 814.04 (1). An action under this subsection may not be brought after 180 days after 
the date of a violation of sub. (3)."
1177,19," HN16[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 808.03(2) provides: (2) Appeals by permission. A judgment or order not appealable as a matter of right under sub. (1) may be appealed to the court 
of appeals in advance of a final judgment or order upon leave granted by the court if it determines that an appeal will: (a) Materially advance the termination of the litigation or clarify further proceedings in the litigation; (b) Protect the petitioner from substantial or irreparable injury; or (c) Clarify an issue of general importance in the administration of justice. The trial court's order granting summary judgment was a nonfinal order because the alleged violations eliminated by Gross and 
the court for summary judgment remained for trial. "
1178,20," HN21[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 907.02 provides: Testimony by experts. If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the 
evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, 
may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise."
1178,21," The question whether the invoice/replacement formula or the ATP formula is the correct one depends on which results in a 
higher cost.  Wis. Stat. § 100.30(2)(am)1m.b and c. Since Gross's submissions showed that Woodman's prices were below cost 
based on the ATP formula, it was unnecessary for him to establish, as part of a prima facie case, what the results of application 
of the invoice formula would be. If the invoice/replacement formula results in a lower cost than the ATP formula, the ATP formula 
is the statutory minimum; if the invoice/replacement formula results in a higher cost than the ATP formula, that would not reduce 
the number of sales below the statutory minimum. "
1179,22," HN22[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 906.02 provides: Lack of personal knowledge. A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding 
that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need not, consist of the 
testimony of the witness. This rule is subject to the provisions of s. 907.03 relating to opinion testimony by expert witnesses."
1179,23," Woodman's argues that the general rule is that expert opinion testimony may not be considered on summary judgment, citing 
Dean Medical Center v. Frye, 149 Wis. 2d 727, 733, 439 N.W.2d 633 (Ct. App. 1989). However, we concluded in Dean that 
this rule did not apply if the issue is one on which expert testimony must be produced at trial.  Id. at 734-35. Woodman's itself 
argues that expert testimony is needed on the correct statutory minimum price; its objection is that Gross does not have the 
requisite expertise. Therefore, Dean does not support its position. "
1180,24," HN23[
] Wisconsin Stat. § 100.30(2) defines ""retailer"" and ""wholesaler"": (2)(e) ""Retailer"" includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail within this state, but, in the case of a 
person engaged in the business of selling both at retail and at wholesale, such term shall be applied only to the retail portion of 
such business. …. (m) ""Wholesaler of motor vehicle fuel"" includes any of the following:"
1180,1, . A person who stores motor vehicle fuel and sells it through 5 or more retail outlets that the person owns or operates.
1180,2," . A person who acquires motor vehicle fuel from a refiner or as a sale at wholesale and stores it in a bulk storage facility other 
than a retail station for further sale and distribution."
1180,3, . A person engaged in the business of making sales at wholesale of motor vehicle fuel within this state.
1180,4," . A person engaged in the business of selling diesel fuel if that person's sales of diesel fuel accounted for at least 60 of that 
person's total sales of motor vehicle fuel in the previous year or, if that person did not engage in the business of selling diesel 
fuel in the previous year, if that person reasonably anticipates that sales of diesel fuel will account for at least 60 of that person's 
total sales of motor vehicle fuel in the current year."
1180,25," Woodman's does not argue that it is not Gross's competitor with respect to the sale of regular, mid-grade, and premium 
unleaded gasoline. "
1181,26," American Heritage Dictionary (3rd ed. 1993) pp. 707, 437. HN26[
] We are to interpret language in statutes according to its 
common and ordinary usage, unless another meaning is indicated, and we may consult a standard dictionary for the common 
meaning of a word.  Swatek v. County of Dane, 192 Wis. 2d 47, 61, 531 N.W.2d 45, 50 (1995). Use of a dictionary to establish 
the meaning of a word does not mean that it is ambiguous.  State v. Curiel, 227 Wis. 2d 389, 404-05, 597 N.W.2d 697 (1999). "
1182,27," Wisconsin Stat. § 100.30 was originally enacted by Laws of 1939, ch. 56. With the changes made by Laws of 1941, ch. 75, § 4 
defined a violation only in terms of proscribed intent; ""or effect"" was added to § 4 by Laws of 1965, ch. 629."
1182,28," Although we may not use legislative history to create an ambiguity in a statute, we may use it to reinforce a conclusion that the 
statute is indeed unambiguous.  Novak v. Madison Motel Assoc., 188 Wis. 2d 407, 416, 525 N.W.2d 123 (Ct. App. 1994)."
1182,29," Woodman's refers us to two California cases- Tri-Q, Inc. v. Sta-Hi Corp., 63 Cal. 2d 199, 404 P.2d 486, 488, 491, 45 Cal. 
Rptr. 878 (1965), and Dooley's Hardware Mart v. Food Giant Markets, Inc., 21 Cal. App. 3d 513, 98 Cal. Rptr. 543 (1971). 
However these cases are not helpful because the language of the California statute differs significantly from that of Wis. Stat. § 
100.30(3) in that it prohibits a below cost sale if ""for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition"" and ""proof of 
[such a sale], together with proof of the injurious effect of such acts, is presumptive evidence of the purpose or intent to injure 
competitors or destroy competition."" Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17043, 17071, cited in Tri-Q, 404 P.2d at 488, 491, and 
Dooley's, 21 Cal. App. 3d at 516 n.2, 517 n.4. We also note that these cases do not address the evidence of intent that is 
sufficient to entitle a defendant to summary judgment, but, rather, address findings made after a trial to the court. "
1183,30," For example, the Sparta document for January 22, 1999, contains this handwritten notation at the bottom: ""94.9 Matching 
Conoco West Salem."" Gross's chart and the circuit court's addendum show Woodman's price on that date was 94.9 cents for 
regular gasoline and 99.9 for mid-grade gasoline, and that the statutory minimum price was, respectively, 96.10 and 101.690. 
We do not count the regular gasoline as a violation because we assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the notation is a 
business record that satisfies Wis. Stat. § 100.30(6)(a)7 and shows that Woodman's lowered the price of regular gasoline below 
the statutory minimum price to match Conoco's price. However, this notation does not even arguably explain why the price for 
mid-grade gasoline was set below the statutory minimum price. Therefore, Woodman's price of mid-grade gasoline is not based 
on evidence in Woodman's possession as required by subd. (6)(a)7. We set out this example because Woodman's appears to 
be of the view that if the Sparta documents show a competitor's price for any grade of fuel on a particular date, sales of all 
grades on that date come within the exception in subd.(6)(a)7. However, we conclude the only reasonable interpretation of subd. 
(6)(a)7, as applied to this case, is that the exception must be established for each grade of fuel Woodman's sells."
1183,31," For March 9, 1999, Gross's chart lists only diesel fuel, with Woodman's price at 99.9, which is below the statutory minimum for 
that day and for the ten-day window as shown on the chart. However, the notation on the Sparta document for that day says 
""95.9 to 99.9 matching Kwik Trip,"" which arguably refers to diesel fuel, since we have no record of another fuel that was matched 
on that date. The same is true for March 12: Gross's chart lists only diesel fuel, with Woodman's price at 99.9, below the 
statutory minimum for that day and the ten-day window; the Sparta document notation shows competitor's prices from 95.9 to 
105.9. "
1184,32," Woodman's relies on Open Pantry Food Marts of Southeastern Wisconsin v. Falcone, 92 Wis. 2d 807, 810-11, 286 
N.W.2d 149 (Ct. App 1979), in which we held that the treble damages provision of Wis. Stat. § 133.01, the Wisconsin Antitrust 
Law, made it punitive as well as remedial, and therefore the statute of limitations in Wis. Stat. § 893.21, for private party actions 
""upon a statute penalty or forfeiture …,"" applied."
1184,33," We have also, in the context of an ordinance that provides for a forfeiture, applied the following standard: A law regulating conduct must give adequate notice of what is prohibited, so as not to delegate ""basic policy matters to 
policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis."" Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 
108-109, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222, 92 S. Ct. 2294 (1972). Thus, ""a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so 
vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first 
essential of due process of law."" Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 70 L. Ed. 322, 46 S. Ct. 126 (1926). Dog Fed'n v. City of South Milwaukee, 178 Wis. 2d 353, 377-78, 504 N.W.2d 375 (Ct. App. 1993). "
1185,34," In State v. Eau Claire Oil Co., 35 Wis. 2d 724, 151 N.W.2d 634 (1967), the seller also objected to the requirement under then 
Wis. Stat. § 100.30(2)(j) (1963) that, when items of merchandise were sold in combination but separately priced, each separate 
item was subject to the markup provisions of the statute. The seller asserted there was no economic justification for this when 
there was an overall profit, and that it was arbitrary in comparison to the manner in which gifts were treated under the statute. 
The court concluded that these were policy judgments for the legislature to make and were not unconstitutional.  Id. at 735-37."
1185,35," Woodman's also argues that the current statute, unlike the statute at issue in State v. Ross, 259 Wis. 379, 48 N.W.2d 460 
(1951), and State v. Eau Claire Oil Co., 35 Wis. 2d 724, 151 N.W.2d 634 (1967), mandates a minimum markup, thus forcing 
sellers of motor vehicle fuel to set prices above those that take into account their actual costs. Woodman's does not elaborate 
further on the specific provisions it is challenging. Presumably Woodman's means that the specified markup for doing business "
1186,," is required now in all cases, whereas in earlier versions the seller could use a lower markup if it could prove its cost of doing 
business was less. Cf. Wis. Stat. § 100.30(2)(am)1m.b and c with § 100.30(2)(a) and (b) (1949) and (1963). Woodman's, 
however, has presented no evidence that its cost of doing business is less than the statutory markup, and the evidence is that 
Woodman's used the statutory markup in setting its prices. In the absence of a developed argument that relates the facts of this 
case to the provision Woodman's challenges, we decline to address it. "

1205,2," Shortly before the filing of this opinion, we were informed by the parties to this case that they have settled the underlying 
litigation, although they do not seek dismissal of proceedings in this court. When parties settle a case after oral argument, we 
may nonetheless exercise our discretion to issue an opinion ""to resolve the legal issues raised, which are of continuing public 
interest and are likely to recur."" ( People v. Eubanks (1996) 14 Cal.4th 580, 584, fn. 2 [59 Cal. Rptr. 2d 200, 927 P.2d 310].) The 
certified question asks us to decide a general point of law regarding an aspect of California's trade secret statute. Accordingly, 
although the matter is apparently rendered moot, we exercise our discretion to resolve the legal question. "
1206,3," Computer software programs are written in specialized languages called source code. The source code, which humans can 
read, is then translated into language that computers can read. The computer readable form, which operates on a binary 
system, is called object code. "
1207,4," In the present case, it is unclear from the above facts whether the acquisition of the trade secret was itself improper and 
therefore a misappropriation, or whether the subsequent use of the secret was the initial misappropriation. In any case, the 
parties agree that Avant! had both acquired and used the trade secret prior to signing the Release. We will assume for purposes 
of addressing the certified question that the initial misappropriation occurred with the first use of the secret and will, for purposes 
of this case, equate ""initial misappropriation"" with ""initial use."" "
1210,5," Patent law has no equivalent to section 3426.6. The limitations on patent actions set forth in 35 United States Code section 286 
differ considerably from section 3426.6. It provides in pertinent part: ""Except as otherwise provided by law, no recovery shall be 
had for any infringement committed more than six years prior to the filing of the complaint or counterclaim for infringement in the 
action."" (35 U.S.C., § 286.) ""This provision has been said not to constitute a 'statute of limitations' in the usual sense of the term, 
in that 35 U.S.C. section 286 does not say that no suit shall be maintained. . . . The limitation contained in the 35 U.S.C. section 
286 . . . does not bar infringement actions, but merely limits recovery of damages to infringements occurring during the six years 
preceding any damages action brought."" (Rosenberg, 3 Patent Law Fundamentals (rev. 2d ed. 2001) § 17.06 [1][d], p. 17-100.) 
The federal statute does not employ ""continuing misappropriation"" or any equivalent concept. "
1211,6," Cadence also cites in support of its position a letter from Assemblyman Elihu Harris, the sponsor of the UTSA, to Governor 
Deukmejian urging him to sign Assembly Bill No. 501 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.), the UTSA, in order to bring ""clarity and uniformity

1224,1," Plaintiffs allege that their product, FieldTurf(R), embodies the claims of U.S. Patent No. 4,337,283 and is, in keeping therewith, 
a playing surface for athletic games, comprising a firm, stable subsurface, blades of synthetic grass tufted to a uniform height, 
and having a specially-mixed infill composed of resilient material and specially graded silica sand. The history of this patent and 
its subsequent assignment and licensing is recited hereinbelow."
1224,2," Southwest entered the sports surfacing business as a manufacturer and installer of running tracks in 1984, later expanding into 
the artificial turf business by first acquiring the rights and assets in the United States for a well-known conventional turf system, 
AstroTurf(R), from Balsam AG and its American subsidiary in a bankruptcy sale. In 1994, Southwest began developing a ""filled"" 
turf product, later marketed as AstroPlay(R), placing a layer of granulated rubber against a carpet backing and trapping it there, 
so that it could not be displaced by the sand also contained in the product over time, preventing the sand from compacting. 
Curled nylon fibers were sewn into the carpet backing, and the nylon ""root zone"" fibers held the rubber particles in place. 
Defendant subsequently modified the specifications of some AstroPlay(R) systems such that they contained no sand, only 
granulated rubber. The AstroPlay(R) ""filled"" systems are marketed with the option of an underlying shock-absorbing pad."
1224,3," Claim 1 of the '283 Patent defines the patented invention as a ""playing surface for athletic games comprising: (a) a firm, stable 
subsurface; (b) a pile fabric having a flexible backing and normally upstanding pile elements resembling grass; the length of said 
pile elements being substantially uniform and lying in the range from 1/2 to 2 inches; and (c) a compacted top-dressing layer 
comprising a mixture of from 25 to 95 volume percent resilient particles and from 5 to 75 volume percent fine sand interspersed 
among the pile elements and on the backing to a substantially uniform dept at least 1/2 the length of the pile elements."" "
1225,4," FieldTurf's President, John Gilman, has stated in deposition testimony that his company's infill products have typically been 
more expensive than comparable Southwest products, this in spite of the fact that FieldTurf does not use a shock-absorbing pad 
under its products, a measure that arguably translates into savings for customers. While Plaintiffs describe the price differential 
as a distinction in quality, Plaintiffs do not deny and a principal of their distributor, TurfUSA, has testified that FieldTurf's system 
of distributorship creates a mark-up in price on their systems not experienced by Southwest with its vertically integrated system 
of manufacture, sale, distribution, and installation of fields. "

1227,8," Plaintiffs allege that Defendant provided information on ASTM testing as compared to Clegg testing to the City of Lake 
Oswego. Plaintiffs also allege that, without permission of the City or its consultants, Southwest conducted its own ASTM testing 
on the fields, publishing the results so obtained to customers and to the city. "
1228,9," Plaintiffs rely on shipping and invoice records describing rolls of ""ASTROPLAY"" shipped from sources within the United States 
to demonstrate the movement of the product from the United States to sites abroad and that billing was initiated from within the 
United States. "
1230,10," Defendant argues that Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue a claim under KY. REV. STAT. 367.175, the antitrust provision of the 
Kentucky Consumer Protection Act. HN7[
] While it has been stated that the Act ""provides no civil remedies to private plaintiffs 
for violations of 367.175,"" it is also stated that ""Kentucky Consumer Protection Act was broadly designed to curtail unfair, false 
misleading or deceptive practices in the conduct of commerce."" Kentucky Laborers Dist. Council Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. 
Hill & Knowlton, Inc., 24 F. Supp.2d 755, 773 (W.D.Ky. 1998); Com ex rel. Stephens v. North American Van Lines, Inc., 600 
S.W.2d 459, 462 (Ky. App. 1979). Considering such a broad reading and the statement of a federal antitrust claim, Judge 
Wilhoit's order of October 6, 2001, stated that FieldTurf had standing to pursue a claim under KY. REV. STAT. 367.175. 
Accordingly, the Court will not now dismiss the state antitrust claim for lack of standing. As HN8[
] the antitrust law of the Commonwealth is so similar to its federal counterpart, the Sherman Antitrust Act, and may be interpreted where appropriate with regard to federal law, the Court shall dispatch with the claim under KY. REV. STAT. 
367.175 upon its analysis of the federal antitrust claim as stated in this order. See  Mendell v. Golden-Farley of Hopkinsville, 
Inc., 573 S.W.2d 346, 349 (Ky.App. 1978). "
1231,11," HN10[
] Where a defendant allegedly acquires or maintains monopoly power, the commission of the unlawful predicate act 
must either itself establish monopoly power or occur at a time when the defendant already possesses monopoly power. See  Re/ 
Max Int'l., Inc. v. Realty One, Inc., 173 F.3d 995, 1016 (6th Cir. 1999). Where the defendant allegedly attempts to monopolize, 
the predicate act must occur at a time when the defendant is dangerously close to establishing monopoly power. See  White and 
White, Inc. v. American Hosp. Supply Corp., 723 F.2d 495, 506 (6th Cir. 1983). "
1232,12," HN14[
] For example, ""low prices which remain above predatory levels do not constitute an antitrust injury because they 
benefit consumers regardless of how they are set."" Louisa Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Co., Inc., 
94 F. Supp.2d 804, 814 (E.D.Ky. 1999). ""Predatory pricing"" becomes actionable where the defendant prices its products below 
the cost of producing them for the purpose of driving its competitors out of business so that the defendant may then raise prices 
to anticompetitive levels and recoup its past losses. Brooke Group, Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 
222-24, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993); Richter Concrete Corp. v. Hilltop Concrete Corp., 691 F.2d 818, 823 (6th Cir. 
1982). Where the defendant's prices are below the ""average variable costs"" of producing the product, a prima facie case of predatory 
pricing is established and the burden shifts to the defendant to show that the pricing was justified. D.E. Rogers Assoc., Inc., 718 
F.2d 1431, 1436 (6th Cir. 1983). Where the pricing is above ""average variable costs"" but below the defendant's ""total costs"" it is 
presumed that the pricing scheme is not predatory and the plaintiff may not prevail absent detailed and convincing economic "
1233,," analysis establishing a clear correlation between the pricing scheme and an untimely anticompetitive result. Id. When the 
defendant's prices are above the ""average total costs"" of producing the product; a claim for predatory pricing will not survive. Id. Defendant's pricing remained not only above its average variable costs, but also above its average total costs. This is to say that 
between May 1999 and the end of 2000, Southwest was earning ""net profits"" (its sales revenues exceeded its total costs)-
making, not losing, money in the arguably relevant time period. Notably, FieldTurf's expert, J. Donald Fancher, indicated that 
during the relevant time Defendant maintained profit margins around 20%. It follows, inexorably, that Plaintiffs' claims premised 
on predatory pricing would necessarily fail, as well."

has suggested that the fact that certain customers excluded competitors who lacked certain ""experience"" requirements 
demonstrates a barrier to entry into the artificial turf market. However, experience requirements are not substantial barriers to 
entry as they apply to everyone equally. See  Rebel Oil Co. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421 (9th Cir. 1995). "
1234,14," ""Puffing"" is a claim of general superiority or an exaggerated blustering or boasting statement. Pizza Hut, 227 F.3d at 496. "

Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Marion Merrell Dow, Inc., 93 F.3d 511, 515 (8th Cir. 1996)."
1235,16," The Court further remarks that the relative safety of Defendant's own product with a pad, insofar as it is supported by ratings 
on appropriate tests, accomplishes little more than the type of ""puffery"" one anticipates in any competitive sales environment."
1235,17," Plaintiffs have relied only on the testimony of John Ingram to substantiate that consumers were misled by Southwest's alleged 
statements. Such testimony by Ingram has been excluded from this matter as hearsay on the Court's order of November 4, 
2002. "

1236,19," HN25[
] A dismissal with prejudice is a final adjudication on the merits. England v. Automatic Canteen Co., 349 F.2d 988,"
1236,989," (6th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 925, 15 L. Ed. 2d 845, 86 S. Ct. 928 (1966) (dismissal of a suit with prejudice bars 
subsequent action seeking the same relief); see also  Hallco Mfg. Co. v. Foster, 256 F.3d 1290, 1297. "
1237,20," Plaintiffs' novel theory that the Settlement Agreement states that all AstroPlay(R) is, by definition, in violation of Claim 1 of the 
'283 Patent (by virtue of the pile length stated therein) is bold but nonsensical. Following FieldTurf's interpretation, if the paper on 
which this order is printed or the computer monitor on which it appears were called ""AstroPlay,"" they would infringe the '283 
Patent notwithstanding their lack of an ""infill"" or usefulness as a location for sporting events. This Court will not stand for such 
obnoxious and inflated interpretation of the clear language of an agreement between the parties. For the same reason, the Court declines to apply the doctrine of equivalents as suggested by Plaintiffs. HN27[
] The doctrine 
prevents infringers from creating the infringing product with only insubstantial changes to avoid directly replicating the exact 
claims of the patent and to disingenuously avoid the prohibitions of the patent laws. Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Lande Air Prods. 
Co., 339 U.S. 605, 94 L. Ed. 1097, 70 S. Ct. 854, 1950 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 597 (1950). Regardless of the length of the pile in the 
allegedly infringing installations, which by Defendant's accounts would exceed the length claimed in the invention described in 
the '283 Patent, so long as Defendant's product did not contain the sand infill, it would both lack an element required by the 
patent as intimated in the Settlement Agreement. Where the pile length was less than or in excess of the 1/2 to 2 inch length 
stated in Claim 1 of the '283 Patent, this Court is not convinced that doctrine of equivalents is implicated as FieldTurf has stated 
that even minor changes in the length of the pile elements substantially affect performance. This is to say that, as FieldTurf itself 
suggests, the installation would no longer perform as the patented invention was designed to perform and such installations 
could not be the patented invention. "
1238,21," To decide otherwise would effectively extend the term of a patent beyond its expiration date by requiring competitors to wait 
until after the expiration to ""gear up"" to offer competing and no-longer infringing products in the marketplace, a result that this 
Court finds untenable with the limited monopoly, both temporally and substantively, permitted under patent law. "
1239,22," Even where prospective customer visited defendant's headquarters in the United States weeks before defendant submitted a 
bid, defendant worked on bid proposal and prepared pricing information in the United States, the Federal Circuit found the actual 
offer to sell took place outside the United States and other activities were insufficient as matter of law to establish an ""offer for 
sale"" within the boundaries of the United States of the infringing equipment at issue. Rotec Indus., Inc., 215 F.3d 1246. "
1240,23," HN36[
] Courts have interpreted this language narrowly in order to avoid giving extraterritorial effect to otherwise domestic 
patent protection. See  Waymark Corp., 245 F.3d at 1368; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc., 2001 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 16895 at *20."
1240,24," Plaintiffs attempts to divide the pile fabric component into two parts, having previously treated the pile fabric as a single 
component of the '283 Patent, are not well taken by this Court. In any event, where the two alleged elements are so intimately 
intertwined and distinct from the other stated elements as to have been previously construed by the parties as a single element 
of the invention, the Court finds that whether 1 of 4 or 2 of 5 elements are so provided it will not rise to the level of providing the 
requisite ""substantial portion of the patented invention."" "
1241,25," Further, as Defendant reminds the Court, inventor Haas has testified that the pile fabric was manufactured prior to the time 
Haas applied for his patent. This suggests, and Plaintiffs do not demonstrate otherwise, that the pile fabric is hardly a feature 
specific only to those fields constructed with '283 Patent technology."
1241,26," Commonwealth common law does not recognize a separate cause of action for ""commercial disparagement."" "
1247,1," Federal Rule of Evidence 702, as amended December 1, 2000, states: HN1[

1250,3," Mr. Parisi's deposition transcript on this point provides as follows: Q: Let me ask about the other part of your conclusions where you concluded that they are not [sic] noncollusive. What is it 
that leads you to believe that these three bids are noncollusive? A: Well I see that the numbers are, again, consistent with what I'm familiar with. Nothing was glaring. I would have no 
reason to think that it was something that was conspired or together. Q: Okay. Is there a way to tell from the relationship of one bid to another, either from the relationship of one bid to another 
in terms of dollars or the relationship of one or more bids to a budget figure, whether or not the bids are collusive? [Objection to form] A: Well, you know, when I look at these numbers -- like, for instance the Donofrio bid was high within the three -- I have 
about five years worth of work with him bidding, and he was the exact same way. I don't see him varying in any way from 
what he normally does for me in my bids. To me, you know, that was an indication that he -- unless he's collusive with my 
bids too. Q: Which we'll presume he is not. A: I didn't see anything here that would lead me to believe that it was collusive. Q: What hypothetically would you look for to see if, in your view, bids were collusive? A: I don't really look for that sort of thing. I don't take that approach to my business. Q: Okay. A: But I guess if I saw something that all the numbers were out of whack completely, I would just throw them all out. I 
wouldn't entertain any. (Pl. Mot. Exh. B at 43-44.) "

1257,3," Viazis asserts that Dohn's statements to the effect that GAC might experience national repercussions are ""inconsistent with 
localized complaints,"" and he claims that Dohn's prediction that Viazis would suffer adverse professional consequences as a 
result of his seminar are ""consistent with ongoing communications."" Neither these statements nor any other of the passages 
cited by Viazis contain explicit reference to an agreement between GAC and any other party."
1257,4," Viazis contends that he introduced evidence of a conspiracy through testimony that the district court improperly disregarded. 
The testimony at issue related to whether GAC had a policy against advertising directly to consumers before the events at issue. 
Dohn testified that GAC had a policy against advertising directly to the public, although Barry Mervine, GAC's representative in 
Dallas, testified that he was unaware of any such policy. In addition, Viazis testified that GAC had foreknowledge of, and input 
into, a mailer through which he advertised to the public but failed to object to its contents. Although, in ruling on a motion for j.m.l., a district court should refrain from making credibility determinations, see  Conkling v. 
Turner, 18 F.3d 1285, 1300 (5th Cir. 1994), the court did not necessarily do so here. Mervine's testimony does not establish that 
GAC advertised directly to consumers, nor even that GAC lacked a policy prohibiting such advertising. All Mervine's testimony 
establishes is that if such a policy existed or such advertisement took place, he was unaware of it. His testimony, therefore, does 
not directly contradict Dohn's. Viazis's testimony has a greater tendency to undercut the existence of a longstanding policy 
against direct advertisement but does not contradict GAC's contention that it had not engaged in direct advertisement in the 
preceding decade. In any event, even if the court improperly evaluated the credibility of these two witnesses in arriving at its conclusions, the legal 
result would be the same. Although proof of a preexisting policy tends to support an inference of independent con duct, see  
Matrix Essentials, Inc. v. Emporium Drug Mart, Inc., 988 F.2d 587, 594 (5th Cir. 1993); Culberson, Inc. v. Interstate Elec. Co., 
821 F.2d 1092, 1094 (5th Cir. 1987), the absence of such a policy does not necessarily support an inference of conspiracy. As 
discussed in part I.B.2 infra, GAC was entitled to act in response to customer complaints irrespective of whether it had a 
preexisting policy."
1257,5," Culberson, 821 F.2d at 1094; see also  Matrix Essentials, 988 F.2d 587."
1257,6," See  Culberson, 821 F.2d at 1093. Viazis's attempts to distinguish the Monsanto line of cases are unpersuasive. He accurately 
notes that the reasoning in Monsanto and its progeny reflects some concern that allowing dealer complaints to serve as 
evidence of conspiracy would deter legitimate business strategies, such as the adoption of marketing strategies using nonprice 
restrictions. Viazis contends that such concerns are not implicated here, because ""conspiracies aimed at stamping out promising 
new technology should not be made unduly difficult to prove."" Even if manufacturers' ability to impose legitimate nonprice restrictions were the principal focus of Monsanto, this conclusional 
statement fails to offer any ground for distinguishing the present case. This case implicates GAC's ability to enforce its particular 
marketing strategy, namely, that of marketing to health professionals rather than the public, and therefore is not distinguishable 
from Monsanto on the ground argued by Viazis. Further, Viazis ignores the fact that the Monsanto Court dealt with the ""two important distinctions that are at the center of [any] 
distributor-termination case."" Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761 (emphasis added). The distinction between price and nonprice 
restrictions was the second of these; the first was ""the basic distinction between concerted and independent action."" Id. The 
Court dealt with this distinction by reaffirming the principle that ""[a] manufacturer of course generally has a right to deal, or refuse 
to deal, with whomever it likes, as long as it does so independently."" Id. (citing United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, "
1258,307," , 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465, 1919 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 460 (1919)). GAC's ability to deal or refuse to deal with Viazis is 
implicated by these proceedings."

losing the business of disgruntled dealers.""). "
1259,9," During the appeal of Viazis's suspension, Dr. Hershey, one of the panelists, told Viazis: ""It's not your work Tony. Next time, play 
by the rules."" This comment is certainly suspicious, but it is not direct evidence of conspiracy, because it does not explicitly 
reference any agreement. In addition, Hershey's statement is not inconsistent with the committee's finding that Viazis violated 
the AAO's prohibition of deceptive advertising. The committee could have found Viazis's bracket to be a good product, while still 
concluding that Viazis had used inappropriate methods to promote it. In any event, in light of the fact that GAC ended its 
marketing arrangement with Viazis over a year before his suspension, the exclusion of which Viazis complains had long since 
occurred."

1269,2," On April 1, 1930, the New York State Legislature reconstituted and continued the Board ""as a body, corporate and politic, in 
perpetuity."""
1269,3," The distinction between the Board and Pirnie is not relevant for purposes of this appeal, and our legal conclusions regarding 
the Board apply equally to Pirnie. "
1270,4," The plaintiff also challenged the legitimacy of the Board's status as a non-profit entity, alleging that the Board's exemption from 
income taxes enabled it to earn ""excess profits"" that accrued to the benefit of its for-profit members. Amend. Compl. PP 45, 113. "
1271,5," The plaintiff does not allege that the Village has created a monopoly in the sense that it forbade property owners from hiring the 
plaintiff. The plaintiff's allegation is, rather, that the Village's requirement that every owner submit a Board-issued certificate of 
compliance in order to receive a certificate of occupancy effectively eliminated demand for the plaintiff's services. The implicit 
assumption, which we have no reason to doubt, is that property owners have little need for additional inspection services once 
they have obtained a certificate of occupancy. "
1273,6," While, under the principles announced Omni Outdoor, it is not for us as a federal court of appeals to decide on this appeal 
whether the Village's acts are ultra vires, neither do we decide that had a state court determined that the acts were ultra vires, 
we would nonetheless conclude that the municipality or the private actor was entitled to state-action immunity. "
1275,7," The plaintiff also argues that the decision of New York Supreme Court, Broome County, in Atlantic-Inland, Inc. v. Union, 126 
Misc. 2d 509, 516, 483 N.Y.S.2d 612, 618, collaterally estops the Board from asserting a state-action immunity defense in this 
case. The fact pattern of Atlantic-Inland was similar to that of the instant case: An electrical inspection firm, alleging violations of 
its constitutional rights and New York antitrust law (i.e., the Donnelly Act), sued a municipality that had designated the Board its 
exclusive provider of required electrical inspections. The Board intervened on the side of the municipality. The court entered 
judgment against the defendants, holding that ""the [municipality's] ordinance is anticompetitive and an unwarranted monopoly in 
violation of the Donnelly Act."" Id. at 517, 483 N.Y.S.2d at 618. Although the court's opinion in Atlantic-Inland does not mention 
the state-action immunity defense, the plaintiff argues that the Board could have raised the defense in that case, and so its 
defeat precludes it from raising the defense now. The plaintiff's collateral estoppel argument fails as a matter of law. Unlike the federal antitrust laws, the Donnelly Act 
contemplates no state-action exception.  Elec. Inspectors, Inc. v. Village of Lynbrook, 293 A.D.2d 537, 538, 740 N.Y.S.2d 412, 
413 (2d Dep't 2002). Thus, even if the Board raised state-action immunity in Atlantic-Inland, rejection of that defense was not 
necessary to the disposition, and so that case does not preclude the Board from raising the defense here. See   Fuchsberg & 
Fuchsberg v. Galizia, 300 F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 2002) (collateral estoppel applies only to issues necessarily resolved in 
previous proceeding)."
1275,8," In a supplemental brief that we requested at oral argument, the Board asserted for the first time a defense under the Local 
Government Antitrust Act of 1984, 15 U.S.C. § 34 et seq. Because the Board did not raise the defense in its principal appellate 
brief, the Board has abandoned the defense and we do not consider it. See, e.g.,   Thomas v. Roach, 165 F.3d 137, 146 (2d Cir. 
1999). "

1287,1," The summary judgment motions and responses were originally filed under seal, and were unsealed by Court Order on June 24,

1288,2," Morris claims that journalistic integrity requires a journalist to report on news first-hand, if possible, instead of relying on what 
the creator of the news reports to the journalist or in some fashion to have the ability to verify questionable facts that come to 
their attention before publishing them. Morris's goal in this suit is to get access to the PGA Tour's scoring system, which will 
allow Morris to report scores of golfers, but only the scores that the PGA Tour relays to Morris, through a procedure the PGA 
Tour developed and has in place to gather simultaneous scores in its golf tournament. If Morris were to prevail on its claims, its 
journalists would, by its own standards, publish information gathered by others. Morris employees do not actually view the action 
they report on, but merely copy numbers provided by PGA Tour, whether in the media tent or through the PGA Tour's web site. If 
Morris's reporters believe the PGA Tour's information is incorrect, they may ask that the PGA Tour verify it in order to maintain 
journalistic integrity, but Morris would only seek to verify unusual scores. For example, if a golfer scores a 9 on a par 3 hole (par 
is the average or expected number of strokes a player would use to complete the hole), Morris contends that it would alert the 
PGA Tour and ask that the unusual score be verified. However, Morris would not ask to verify a golf score of 2 or 4 on a par 3 
hole, even though that score might be as inaccurate as the score of 9."

1288,5," Morris Communications Corp. v. PGA Tour, Inc., 117 F. Supp.2d 1322 (M.D. Fla. 2000). "
1289,6," Under newly developed technology known as ""Shotlink,"" the walking scorers themselves will be able to relay scores directly to 
the production truck. In addition, the new technology allows the scorers to transmit additional data such as club selection, the lie 
of the ball, and the distance to the pin. Morris has not sought to syndicate any information obtainable from Shotlink other than 
the raw score."
1289,7," Morris has also argued that it would be socially wasteful for it to duplicate the PGA Tour's efforts in implementing such a 
system. "
1290,8," While Morris was the only major competitor in the syndication market, many competitors, such as www.thegolfchannel.com, 
www.nbc.com, and www.golfonline.com, still vied for market share in the distribution of golf scores on the Internet."
1290,9," Although it is a matter of contention when the scoring information becomes legally available to the public, the PGA Tour has 
conceded that golf scores are in the public domain once they are published on pgatour.com or are publically broadcasted on 
either television or radio. "
1291,10," The Court also concluded that Morris had not satisfied its burden with respect to showing irreparable harm or that the balance 
of harms and the public interest weighed in favor of injunctive relief. Morris, 117 F. Supp.2d at 1330-31."
1291,11," The ""consumers"" in the syndication market refer generally to web-site publishers who pay other publishers for real-time 
scoring information; advertisers, who usually represent the primary source of revenue for Internet web sites; and Internet users, 
who log on to the various web sites. "
1292,12," PGA Tour counters by noting that ""cash"" consideration (as opposed to promotional equivalents) is the same and that the new

] Free-riding is obtaining a benefit at another's expense without contributing to it. See Garner, Black's Law Dictionary,"
1293,7, th ed. at 676.
1293,14," Morris's claim that replication of RTSS would be socially wasteful belies its claim that it does not free-ride. Replication would 
be wasteful, precisely because the PGA Tour has invested time, money, and resources that Morris has not and does not wish to 
expend. "
1294,15," Similarly, any single spectator at a basketball, baseball, or football game knows the score of the game, as all the action takes 
place within his or her sight."
1294,16," As the Court finds the ""hot-news"" claim inapplicable, it does not address the five requirements to prove a ""hot-news"" claim. 
See Motorola, 105 F.3d at 845."
1294,17, Nor can a single spectator at a golf tournament know the score of all the players.
1294,18," The PGA Tour also publishes the scores of the top players to the spectators, who are present under a license from the PGA 
Tour which prevents their dissemination of the scores off the course."
1294,19," Currently, the PGA Tour allows Morris to publish the scores as quickly as it can re-key them from the media center, but the 
PGA Tour does not allow Morris to sell or syndicate that information. Also, a compiler of information can limit the dissemination 
of that information through contracts, including contracts found on tickets. See ProCD Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447, 1451 
(7th Cir. 1996)"
1294,20," Even if the information were in the public domain, the PGA Tour would have the ability to limit the use of the information it 
provides to Morris under contract law. See ProCD Inc. v. Zeidenberg, 86 F.3d 1447 (7th Cir. 1996)(holding that producers of a 
CD, consisting of the content of publicly available phone books, could, under contract law, enjoin purchasers from selling the 
information, which was clearly in the public domain and not protected by copyright). "
1295,21," Morris has been capitalizing on this type of externality, ever since it has included golf scores in its newspapers' sports 
sections."
1295,22," The Court, in its discussion of free-riding supra, found that the information and scores when first published in the media center 
are not in the public domain. "
1296,23," In Bruce v. Weekly World News, Inc., 150 F. Supp.2d 313 (D. Mass. 2001), the court accepted the opinion of both sides' 
experts who agreed that the Internet was a separate medium, distinct from print media, requiring a separate license for use on 
the Internet. The court awarded additional damages because of the infringing use on the Internet. Id. at 321. If a separate 
license is required to use a copyrighted picture on the Internet, the producers of a marketable product, like golf scores, should 
also be able to sell rights on that new meduim."
1296,24," With the emergence of ""web-casting"" and ""streaming"" video and other rapid advancements in technology, a negative answer 
to the question of whether the PGA Tour has broadcast rights on the Internet would stymie advancement and reduce incentive to 
create entertainment and sports programming by foreclosing a lucrative market. See generally, Kellis, Note: A new Technology 
Question of Olympic Proportions: Should NBC's License to Broadcast the Games Include Internet Broadcasting Rights?, 8 J. "
1297,," Intell. Prop. L. 245 (2001). To hold otherwise would be similar to a court finding that Major League Baseball could not sell 
broadcasting rights to television stations in the 1940s with the advent of television."
1297,25," Whether it would be a violation of antitrust law for the PGA Tour to be the sole outlet of golf scores on the Internet without 
offering to sell or license that information is not a question before the Court. "
1298,26," Theoretically, the PGA Tour could limit the media's access to the tournament and the media center to those willing to pay a fee 
or to the one willing to pay the highest price. Although such a practice would be a departure from its past practice, it would not 
violate Aspen. The PGA Tour could justify the change with the business justification that the PGA Tour would be better off 
charging the press an access fee, than gaining the corollary benefit of increased publicity. A court would not be in a position to 
second guess the business model selected by a company, unless it unnecessarily excluded competitors. "
1299,27," If the Court were to rule for Morris, the Court would have to decide what price Morris would need to pay in order for it to be 
placed on an equal footing with the PGA Tour. Such rate making is not the appropriate role for a court. See generally, 
Consolidated Gas Co. of Florida v. City Gas Co., 912 F.2d 1262, 1320 (11th Cir. 1990)(Tjoflat, C.J. dissenting). "

for each violation of its prohibition against false or misleading statements. "
1313,4," In Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th 163, a section 17200 unfair competition case, the court developed a definition but expressly 
limited it to anticompetitive cases and excluded cases such as the one at bar involving injury to consumers. The court defined 
""unfair"" AS FOLLOWS: ""When a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a direct competitor's 'unfair' act or practice 
invokes section 17200, the word 'unfair' in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or 
violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or 
otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition."" (Cel-Tech, at p. 187 & fn. 12.) The Cel-Tech court disapproved the definition of ""unfair"" proposed in People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, Inc. (1984) 
159 Cal. App. 3d 509 [206 Cal. Rptr. 164] (Casa Blanca). Therein, the People charged that it was both unlawful and unfair under 
section 17200 that there was insufficient staff at the defendant's facilities. Relying upon FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co. (1972) 
405 U.S. 233 [31 L. Ed. 2d 170, 92 S. Ct. 898] (Sperry & Hutchinson), the Casa Blanca court held that an unfair business 
practice exists ""when it offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous 
or substantially injurious to consumers."" (Casa Blanca, at p. 530.) The Cel-Tech court criticized this wording, stating in part: 
""Vague references to 'public policy,' for example, provide little real guidance. ' ""[P]ublic policy"" as a concept is notoriously 
resistant to precise definition, and . . . courts should venture into this area, if at all, with great care and due deference to the 
judgment of the legislative branch, ""lest they mistake their own predilections for public policy which deserves recognition at law."" 
' [Citation.]"" (Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 185.) Sperry & Hutchinson, supra, 405 U.S. 233, describes the test for fairness as one developed by the Federal Trade Commission to 
determine ""whether a practice that is neither in violation of the antitrust laws nor deceptive is nonetheless unfair."" The test as 
stated by the court is as follows: "" '(1) whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, 
offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise--whether, in other words, it is within at 
least the penumbra of some common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, 
unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other 
businessmen).' "" (Id. at pp. 244-245, fn. 5.) Although the Cel-Tech court disapproved of the version of this test found in Casa 
Blanca, supra, 159 Cal. App. 3d 509, the court expressed ""no view on the application of federal cases such as FTC v. Sperry & "
1314,," Hutchinson Co. . . . that involve injury to consumers and therefore do not relate to [anticompetitive] actions like this one."" (Cel-
Tech, supra, 20 Cal. 4th at p. 187, fn. 12.) The Cel-Tech court also disapproved the definition of ""unfair"" as set forth in State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Superior Court, 
supra, 45 Cal.App.4th at page 1104: ""[T]he court must weigh the utility of the defendant's conduct against the gravity of the harm 
to the alleged victim . . . ."" (Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 184.)"

length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the willfulness of the defendant's misconduct, and the defendant's assets,

relevant part: HN14[

1319,10," ""The financial return from selling an estate plan was much less than that potentially involved in the sale of [appellant's]

1319,11," However, appellant makes several assertions in support of an argument that AMA's conduct should not be attributed to it, 
claiming the following occurred: 1. AMA presented its sales methods as ""wholly-legitimate and above-board."" 2. Appellant did 
not perceive it had an obligation to investigate or assume responsibility for AMA's sales conduct, based on industry custom and 
its agreement with AMA. 3. Although appellant ""may have understood the general structure of AMA's sales method,"" it lacked 
knowledge of how the AMA marketing plan actually affected consumers. 4. Appellant had ""no ability to observe AMA's agent 
training or monitor agent conduct in the field"" and therefore was forced to rely on AMA information, which was not always 
complete or accurate. 5. Appellant's conclusion that AMA was not engaged in the practice of law was due to the complexity of 
the legal question in combination with AMA's misrepresentations to appellant. Appellant also notes here that the $ 2.5 million 
penalty is much greater than the $ 100,000 penalty imposed on AMA. "
1320,12," The statement of decision included the following: ""[T]here are both advantages and disadvantages connected with 
[appellant's] annuities--as compared with other annuities and as compared with other investments."" "
1321,13," Appellant's expert, in explaining various calculations employed to reach the financial gain number, stated that appellant's 
profits for 1996 were $ 17 million. Appellant represents elsewhere in its brief that in 1998 it had approximately $ 24 million in 
assets and $ 6 million in liabilities, resulting in a net worth of less than $ 19 million."
1321,14," Section 17206.1, subdivision (a) reads as pertinent: HN22[
] ""In addition to any liability for a civil penalty pursuant to Section"

citizens or disabled persons, may be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($ 2,500) for each 
violation . . . ."" "
1322,15," Section 17203 reads as relevant: HN24[
] ""Any person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair 
competition may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction. The court may make such orders or judgments . . . as may 
be necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition, as defined in 
this chapter, or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which may 
have been acquired by means of such unfair competition."" (Italics added.) Section 17535 is similar and reads as pertinent: HN25[

1333,1," The MFJ split AT&T's local service into seven Regional Holding Companies (RHCs): U.S. West, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern 
Bell, Ameritech, Nynex, Bell Atlantic, and BellSouth. The MFJ also employed various line-of-business restrictions which, for 
example, precluded the RHCs from providing long distance service or information services. "
1334,2," The provision states: Any conduct or activity that was, before the date of enactment of this Act [Feb. 8, 1996], subject to any restriction or 
obligation imposed by the AT&T Consent Decree shall, on and after such date, be subject to the restrictions and obligations 
imposed by the Communications Act of 1934 as amended by this Act . . . and shall not be subject to the restrictions and 
obligations imposed by such Consent Decree."
1334,3," The statute provides that ""within 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Commission shall complete all actions necessary to 
establish regulations to implement the requirements of this section."""
1334,4," As the Seventh Circuit explained: Long before the 1996 Act was passed . . . it had become clear that comprehensive regulation of the rapidly advancing 
telecommunications markets was not a task well suited to the federal courts. Thus, one of the first things Congress did in 
the 1996 Act was to shift the remaining authority the district court was exercising under the MFJ over to the FCC. Goldwasser v. Ameritech Corp., 222 F.3d 390, 393 (7th Cir. 2000)."
1334,5," These include: the duty to negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith; the obligation to interconnect with competitors; 
the obligation to provide competitors with unbundled access to its network elements (""UNEs"") at reasonable rates; the duty to 
offer for resell at wholesale rates any telecommunications service that the ILEC provides at retail; and the duty to allow 
collocation of the CLECs' equipment on the ILEC's premises. See 47 U.S.C. § 251(c). The 1996 Act thus envisions ""three entry 
options: entry through resale, entry through pure facilities-based competition, and entry via the purchase of unbundled network 
elements."" Stuart Benjamin, Douglas Lichtman, & Howard Shelanski, Telecommunications Law and Policy 718 (2001)."
1334,6," There are thousands of existing agreements throughout the United States, and over 400 in BellSouth's territory."
1334,7," Section 252(e)(2) allows state commissions to reject an interconnection agreement only if the agreement discriminates against 
a third-party CLEC or is inconsistent with ""the public interest, convenience, and necessity."""
1334,8, Section 252(e)(5) instructs the FCC to act in the event of a PSC default.
1334,9," Section 252(e)(6), governing federal review of PSCs, provides that ""any party aggrieved by such determination may bring an 
action in an appropriate Federal district court to determine whether the agreement . . . meets the requirements of section 251 of 
this title and this section."" There is no special review statute for the FCC, which is therefore reviewed by the courts of appeals 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2344. "
1335,10," ""RBOC"" is an acronym for ""Regional Bell Operating Company."" RBOCs were the subdivisions of AT&T that provided local 
service throughout the nation prior to the MFJ. Under the MFJ, each RHC consisted of several RBOCs."
1335,11," ""DSL"" stands for ""digital subscriber line."" DSL is ""a high-speed data service provided over conventional telephone networks. 
DSL refers to the technology that allows telephone carriers to attach certain electronics to the telephone line that can transform 
the copper loop that already provides voice service into a conduit for high-speed data traffic."" See Stuart Benjamin, Douglas 
Lichtman, & Howard Shelanksi, Telecommunications Law and Policy 1048 (2001)."
1335,12," A ""price squeeze"" claim is premised upon an illegal wholesale/retail differential. For example, Covad states in its complaint 
that BellSouth's retail prices ""are set so low related to its unbundled wholesale loop prices that Covad cannot meet BellSouth's 
wholesale or retail prices and still make a reasonable return on investment."""
1335,13," Covad's complaint contains twenty-three causes of action. Count one seeks relief under section 2 of the Sherman Act 
pursuant to the ""essential facilities doctrine."" Count two seeks the same relief under section 2 of the Sherman Act based upon 
BellSouth's alleged ""monopolization."" Count three seeks the same relief under section 2 of the Sherman Act based upon 
BellSouth's alleged ""attempted monopolization."" All of the section 2 allegations are thus folded into count 3. Counts six, seven 
nine, ten, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-two, and twenty-three replicate counts two and three 
under the laws of the following states: Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Counts eight, 
eleven, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty-one allege that BellSouth interfered with business relations in violation of the laws of 
the same six states. Count four is a claim for breach of contract. Finally, count five asserts a cause of action directly under the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996. In the ""prayer for relief"" at the end of its complaint, Covad asks for treble damages on its 
antitrust claims, punitive damages on its state law tort claims, compensatory damages on the remaining claims, and ""such other 
and further relief as the Court deems just and proper."" One must assume that the latter relief would include injunctive orders 
necessary to ensure BellSouth's compliance with the antitrust laws, the 1996 Act, and the parties' interconnection agreement. "
1336,14," The Seventh Circuit clearly articulated what the world would have looked like if, counterfactually, Congress had opted to 
choose a ""simple antitrust solution"" rather than the extraordinary obligations placed upon ILECs: It would have been possible for Congress to have passed a statute that simply lifted the regulatory prohibitions found in 
sources such as the Telecommunications Act of 1934, the MFJ, and other sources, that barred companies in different parts 
of the telecommunications market (i.e. long distance and local markets, generally speaking) from entering one another's 
domains. Anyone who wanted to compete with an ILEC would have had the burden of duplicating its physical infrastructure 
or of persuading the ILEC to contract with it on mutually satisfactory terms, but this is the normal way in which competitive 
markets work . . . . In other words, Congress could have chosen a simple antitrust solution to the problem of restricted competition in local 
telephone markets. It did not. Instead, in an effort to jump-start the development of competitive local markets, it imposed a 
host of special duties on the ILECs; it entrusted supervision of those duties to the FCC and the state public utility 
commissions; and it created a system of negotiated agreements through which this would be accomplished. These are 
precisely the kinds of affirmative duties to help one's competitors that we have already noted do not exist under the 
unadorned antitrust laws. Goldwasser, 222 F.3d at 399-400 (citations omitted)."
1336,15," The panel, citing MCI Communications v. Am. Tel. & Tel., 708 F.2d 1081, 1132-33 (7th Cir. 1983), held that there are four 
elements to a claim under the essential facilities doctrine: (1) control of the essential facility by a monopolist; (2) a competitor's 
inability practically or reasonably to duplicate the essential facility; (3) the denial of the use of the facility to a competitor; and (4) 
the feasibility of providing the facility.  Covad, 299 F.3d at 1286. The panel never mentioned the horizontal/vertical distinction 
that I discuss, infra. "
1337,16," We rejected a similar claim in another case: This argument reveals the heart of the plaintiffs' claim: they want the right to benefit from [the defendant's] economies of 
scale. The plaintiffs are seeking a ""free ride"" - since they do not have a large enough operation to produce significant 
economies of scale and are unable, or unwilling, to finance the growth necessary to achieve these economies, they want to 
use, to their benefit, [the defendant's] size and the capital outlays used to achieve it . . . . The plaintiffs then are asking us to equip them with [the defendant's] competitive advantage. This is not a function of the 
antitrust laws. The antitrust laws are not intended to support artificially firms that cannot effectively compete on their own. Seagood Trading Corp. v. Jerrico, Inc., 924 F.2d 1555, 1572-73 (11th Cir. 1991). "
1338,17," The panel maintained that before a complaint can pass Rule 12(b)(6) muster, it must allege more than monopoly power and 
breach of contract; it must also allege that the defendant engaged in conduct ""with an intent to monopolize."" I cannot think of a "
1339,," situation, however, in which an ILEC would be liable in breach and yet a creative plaintiff's lawyer could not also allege that the 
breach was made with an eye toward benefitting the ILEC and thus preserving the ILEC's position in the relevant market."
1339,18," Covad did not specifically ask for injunctive relief in is complaint, although it requested ""such other relief as the Court deems 
just and proper."""
1339,19," In this case, for example, the alleged anticompetitive acts of BellSouth could easily be mistaken for breaches of the 
Covad/BellSouth interconnection agreement."
1339,20," This is true if the BellSouth/Covad agreement was the product of arbitration before the PSC. It is unclear from the complaint 
whether the agreement was voluntary or arbitrated. "
1340,21," See  BellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v. MCImetro Access Transmission Servs., 278 F.3d 1223 (11th Cir. 2002)."
1340,22," The panel made this argument in the context of its discussion of the 1996 Act's antitrust savings clause. See 
Telecommunications Act of 1996 § 601(b)(1), codified at 47 U.S.C. § 152 note (""Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by 
this Act shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of the antitrust laws.""). No one has ever contended 
that ""in enacting the 1996 Act, Congress did not explicitly supersede the salience of the antitrust laws in the telecommunications 
industry."" Judge Wood of the Seventh Circuit, who is a former antitrust professor and high-ranking attorney with the U.S. 
Department of Justice Antitrust Division, never made that argument. Neither do I. Rather, we contend that the 1996 Act 
established a regulatory scheme that went beyond anything required by the antitrust laws. It is likely that Congress perceived the 
1996 Act as imposing additional obligations, and that Congress therefore wanted to bring home the point that pre-1996 
obligations under the antitrust laws continue to have vitality in the post-1996 world. The panel, on the other hand, evidently 
believes that the 1996 Act is merely a more specific application of the forced-accessed requirements that ordinarily would be 
required by the antitrust laws."
1340,23," This proposition stems from several observations. First, there are thousands of interconnection agreements and thus 
potentially thousands of Covad-like antitrust cases lurking across the Circuit (and, indeed, the United States). Second, many 
parties will be involved in the litigation. In Goldwasser, for example, consumers (not CLECs) were the plaintiffs. There might well 
be multiple consumer class actions in future cases. Moreover, the panel's ""price squeeze"" holding, which will compel BellSouth 
to raise the retail price of its DSL service, will affect existing contracts. DSL customers must therefore be joined as indispensable 
parties - possibly in the form of another class action. If one adds to this picture the problem of apportioning damages, see, e.g., 
Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Auth., 921 F.2d 1438, 1451-52 (11th Cir. 1991), and the issue of state court proceedings (which 
obviously cannot be consolidated), then the drain on scarce judicial resources becomes apparent. I do not suggest that 
otherwise meritorious lawsuits should be dismissed merely because their complexity will drain judicial resources; rather, I 
contend that the drain ought to at least provoke a second look as to whether these suits are really meritorious in the first place."
1340,24," CLECs also have an incentive to delay the negotiation of interconnection agreements, for any damages CLECs sustain 
because of an ILEC's failure to yield access to its network will potentially be subject to trebling by a district judge. "
1341,25," I suggest that CLECs filing suit against BellSouth in the district courts of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits may invoke the 
doctrine of collateral estoppel in response to BellSouth's argument that federal antitrust claims such as those Covad presents in 
this case are not cognizable under section 2 of the Sherman Act. In short, the panel's decision is not only of ""exceptional 
importance"" in the Eleventh Circuit, it will be of importance to the courts and litigants in these other circuits as well. "
1344,*," Judge Wilfred Feinberg recused himself from consideration of this matter after oral argument took place and did not participate 
in this decision. Because the remaining two panel members agree on the disposition of this appeal, they act in accordance with 
2d Cir. R. 0.14. "
1345,1," The statute states: HN1[
] ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or 
instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national 
securities exchange . . . to effect either alone or with one or more other persons any series of transactions for the purchase 
and/or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange for the purpose of pegging, fixing, or stabilizing the price 
of such security in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors."" 15 U.S.C. § 78i(a)(6). "
1359,1," The opinion cited State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Superior Court, supra, 45 Cal.App.4th 1093, 1103-1104, which followed 
the Motors, Inc., decision. "
1360,2," The Supreme Court denied a petition for review on February 24, 1999, less than two months before its decision in Cel-Tech."
1360,3," In our reading of Cel-Tech, we differ somewhat from the interpretation in Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. 
(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700, 720, footnote 23 [113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 399],, which expressed the view that Cel-Tech ""did not signal a 
retreat (at least in noncompetitor cases), from [the Supreme Court's] earlier statements in Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn. 
. . ."" "

1368,1," Pueblo made no motion to dismiss Sunny Isle's remaining claims, namely Count III (waiver) and Count IV (estoppel)."
1368,2," The initial term of the lease was 21 years, but permitted Grand Union to extend the lease term four times, with each extension 
having a term of five years. "
1369,3," The space Sunny Isle intended to lease to Kmart was originally used by F.W. Woolworth Company [""Woolworth""]. Woolworth 
had entered into a lease with Sunny Isle on September 15, 1969 to operate a ""department store business."" According to Sunny 
Isle, Woolworth, in addition to operating its premises as a department store, marketed and sold ""an extension line of food 
products for consumption off premises."" Woolworth terminated its lease with Sunny Isle in 1997."
1369,4," Paragraph 29 of the Sunny Isle-Kmart lease provides in part: ""Landlord acknowledges that [Kmart] intends to sell food for 
consumption off premises, and hereby agrees notwithstanding the Pueblo Exclusive, [Kmart] shall have the right to sell food for 
consumption off premises."" Sunny Isle also agreed to defend at its own cost Kmart's right to sell such foods."
1369,5," 48 U.S.C. § 1612(a). The complete Revised Organic Act of 1954 is found at 48 U.S.C. §§ 1541-1645 (1995 & Supp.2001), 
reprinted in V.I. CODE ANN. 73-177, Historical Documents, Organic Acts, and U.S. Constitution (1995 & Supp.2001) (preceding 
V.I. CODE ANN. tit. 1). "
1372,6," Sunny Isle argues that it alone has the ability and desire to bring this antitrust action. In particular, it notes that K-Mart has been 
unwilling to enter into the fray and consumers cannot realistically be expected to bring an action. Whether or not either of these 
are true, they are beside the point."
1372,7," Absent local law to the contrary, the restatements provide the substantive law of the Virgin Islands. See 1 V.I.C. § 4. "
1373,8," RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF PROPERTY, LANDLORD & TENANT, § 7.2 (noting that HN16[
] a tenant may terminate the 
lease upon the landlord's breach and recover damages or continue the lease and obtain equitable and legal relief)."
1373,9, The Restatement has acknowledged these three approaches in the Reporter's Note to Section 7.2. See id. at 256-58. 
1378,1," Though recognizing that the federal antitrust law (the Sherman Act) is not always directly probative of the legislative intent 
underlying the Cartwright Act, California courts frequently look to judicial interpretations of the Sherman Act as helpful authority 
because of the similarity in language and purpose in the federal and state statutes. (Morrison v. Viacom, Inc. (1998) 66 
Cal.App.4th 534, 541, fn. 2.) "
1380,2," We recognize that section 17200 may apply even when the conduct does not violate a specific statute if the conduct is 
nonetheless ""unfair"" or ""fraudulent."" (Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 
163, 180- 187, 973 P.2d 527.) However, Wallis has based his section 17200 claim solely on a Cartwright Act violation, and has 
never argued defendants' conduct was otherwise unfair or fraudulent. In any event, there is nothing in Wallis's complaint that 
would support a theory that defendants may be liable for unfair or fraudulent conduct if the alleged price-fixing conduct did not 
violate antitrust laws. "
1381,3, Peralta did not say whether these hours were per week or per month. 
1388,*," Honorable John M. Walker, Jr., Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, originally a member 
of the panel, recused himself after oral argument, and the appeal is being disposed of by the remaining members of the panel, 
who are in agreement. See Second Circuit Local Rule § 0.14(b); Murray v. Nat'l Broad. Co., 35 F.3d 45, 47, 48 (2d Cir.1994). "
1390,1," PepsiCo, citing AD/SAT, 181 F.3d at 228, maintains that fountain syrup delivered by IFDs is the relevant market if enough 
customers have sufficient preference for that product to raise prices ""significantly above the competitive level,"" despite the fact 
that others might shift to substitutes at supracompetitive prices. PepsiCo also contends that none of the many customers who 
continue to use or have recently converted to bottler distributors for delivery of fountain syrup, such as Au Bon Pain, Arthur 
Treacher's, Sbarros, Hard Rock Cafe, Planet Hollywood, and major franchise groups of Wendy's, Arby's, and Subways, are 
""similarly situated"" to the type of customer that prefers systems distribution. Although this argument, in theory, may have merit, 
we agree with the district court that PepsiCo failed to adduce evidence to support its application in this case. "
1391,2," For a more extensive discussion of these principles, see generally Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, P 530. "
1392,3," We note that Coca-Cola's figures exclude service distributors that serve only one company's stores (so-called ""captive"" or 
""dedicated"" distributors) from the IFD category on the ground that, according to Coca-Cola, its loyalty provisions are inapplicable 
to captive distributors (i.e., because they only carry the fountain syrup their one client purchases). By Coca-Cola's calculations, 
IFDs accounted for only 32.3 percent of all fountain syrup deliveries in 1998. Because we are reviewing the district court's grant 
of summary judgment, we use the figures most favorable to PepsiCo. See  Adjustrite Sys., 145 F.3d at 547."
1392,4," PepsiCo repeatedly asserts that Coca-Cola has an 80 percent or 84 percent market share, but fails to explain precisely what 
market it is referring to or how the 80 percent or 84 percent figures were derived. "
1401,1," Nevertheless, in an article published a few years after the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act was signed into law and came into 
effect, Arturo Estrella wrote ""there is no doubt that the Puerto Rican statute of 1964 was basically inspired by the Federal 
legislation, from which it draws heavily, …"" and the state act establishes the same objectives as those of the federal antitrust 
statutes. Arturo Estrella, Antitrust Law in Puerto Rico, 28 Rev. Colegio de Abogados, 582-89 (1968). "
1404,2," The record reflects that at least two stockholders of Amigo, Steven Lausell (""Lausell"") and William Gonzalez (""Gonzalez""), 
became stockholders of the company that the FTC approved to be the buyer of the four stores that were the issue of the 
divestiture. "

Cir. 2001). "
1416,9," Pursuant to FED. R. EVID. 201(b)(2), the Court hereby takes judicial notice of the fact that during Martinez and Defendant's 
tenure at the PRDOJ, at least three other mergers have taken place. First, the sale of Puerto Rico Cement Co. this past year to 
Cemex, S.A., a Mexican company. Also, V. Suarez & Co. acquired Cadierno Corp. in 2001. Finally, Grupo Gloria, a Peru-based 
company has recently signed an agreement with Dean Foods Co., parent company to Suiza Foods, to acquire all the operations 
of Suiza. This foreign capital acquisition of a local company that covers two-thirds of the local fresh-milk market, has not been 
under the scrutiny of the PRDOJ even though their agreement was signed in early November 2002, after the PRDOJ and the 
government became aware of potential public policy and political concerns that can ensue as a result of this type of transaction. 
No evidence was introduced with regards to the PRDOJ's oversight of any of these recent transactions. See Jose L. Carmona,

1416,10," As has been evident throughout this discussion section, the claims raised in this case challenge the Secretary's pretextual 
enforcement of the Puerto Rico Anti-Monopoly Act, not validity of the statute itself. "
1421,1," Atlas Liquors, Inc. "
1425,2," The section provides as follows: HN2[
] ""No licensee authorized under this chapter to sell alcoholic beverages to wholesalers or retailers shall -- ""(a) Discriminate, directly or indirectly, in price, in discounts for time of payment or in discounts on quantity of merchandise 
sold, between one wholesaler and another wholesaler, or between one retailer and another retailer purchasing alcoholic 
beverages bearing the same brand or trade name and of like age and quality; ""(b) [Deleted by St. 1970, c. 140, § 1.] ""All price lists or price quotations made to a licensee by a wholesaler shall remain in effect for at least thirty days after the 
establishment of such price list or quotation. Any sale by a wholesaler of any alcoholic beverages at prices lower than the 
price reflected in such price list or quotation within such thirty day period shall constitute price discrimination under this 
section."" G. L. c. 138, § 25A, as amended through St. 1971, c. 494. "
1426,3," The final paragraph of § 25A is a so-called ""post and hold"" provision that requires those who sell alcoholic beverages to 
wholesalers or retailers to submit to the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC) periodic schedules of prices at which 
they are prepared to sell such beverages and then to maintain those prices for a period of thirty days after the schedule 
becomes effective. In Canterbury Liquors & Pantry v. Sullivan, 16 F. Supp. 2d 41 (D. Mass. 1998), the United States District 
Court for the District of Massachusetts held that the post and hold provision was a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 1, because that provision allowed sellers to set prices without effective State oversight and consequently did not qualify 
for a ""State action"" immunity from the antitrust laws under the principles articulated by the Supreme Court of the United States in 
Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). See Canterbury Liquors & Pantry v. Sullivan, 999 F. Supp. 
144 (D. Mass. 1998). See generally California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 63 L. Ed. 2d 
233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980). In Canterbury Liquors & Pantry v. Sullivan, 16 F. Supp. 2d at 44, the Federal District Court reached 
that conclusion on the basis of a Ninth Circuit decision, Miller v. Hedlund, 813 F.2d 1344 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 
1061, 98 L. Ed. 2d 983, 108 S. Ct. 1018 (1988), and a dissent in a Second Circuit decision, Battipaglia v. New York State Liquor 
Authy., 745 F.2d 166, 179 (2d Cir. 1984) (Winter, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1027, 84 L. Ed. 2d 782, 105 S. Ct. 1393 
(1985), but without citing M. H. Gordon & Son, Inc. v. Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., 386 Mass. 64, 70-73, 434 N.E.2d 986 
(1982), which held that the ABCC did exercise sufficient supervision over execution of the post and hold provisions of G. L. c. 
138, §§ 25B, 25D, to immunize them from the antitrust laws. In any event, the Federal District Court entered judgment declaring 
that the § 25A post and hold provision and the implementing regulations found in 204 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 6.00-6.07, were 
invalid and unenforceable. The ABCC did not appeal and, after dismissal of an appeal brought by another party, see Sea Shore 
Corp. v. Sullivan, 158 F.3d 51, 59 (1st Cir. 1998), the judgment became final."
1426,4," When filed, the complaint also alleged that the defendants had violated the § 25A ""post and hold"" provision. See note 3, supra. 
The Federal litigation over that provision was pending at the time and the plaintiff had intervened in that litigation as a plaintiff to 
urge that the provision violated the Sherman Act. When the plaintiff and others prevailed in the Federal litigation, the plaintiff was 
given leave to amend the Superior Court complaint to eliminate the ""post and hold"" claim. The amended complaint is the subject 
of the present appeal and contains no reference to alleged ""post and hold"" violations. In view of the result we reach on the merits, we need not explore the defendants' contention that the plaintiff's representations to 
the Superior Court about its intentions after resolution of the Federal action estopped it from pursuing the present claims."
1426,5," The plaintiff named nine additional wholesalers as defendants in the action, making similar allegations against each and 
claiming that Merrimack and the other nine were involved in a conspiracy to violate § 25A and ""the laws which govern the sale of 
alcoholic beverages in Massachusetts."" The plaintiff likewise named three other retailers, making allegations similar to those it 
made regarding Atlas. Read as a whole, the complaint alleged that the wholesalers were giving the retailers, and the retailers 
were seeking and receiving from the wholesalers, forbidden discounts or that, put somewhat differently, competition between 
wholesalers was impermissibly flourishing. The other wholesalers and retailers settled and consequently play no role in this 
appeal."
1426,6," At some point before the motion to dismiss was allowed, the plaintiff filed affidavits dealing with discovery issues and with 
certain aspects of the plaintiff's damages claim. HN3[
] In considering a motion filed under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), however, the court is limited to the contents of the complaint itself. See Epstein v. Seigel, 396 Mass. 278, 278-279, 485 N.E.2d 947 "
1427,," (1985). Nothing in the record suggests that the motion judge considered the contents of those affidavits in ruling on the motion to 
dismiss, and their content likewise plays no role in our review."
1427,7," Because of the result we reach regarding the plaintiff's claim against Merrimack, we need not separately assess Atlas's claim 
that it cannot be liable in any circumstances for receiving the benefits of any price discrimination because G. L. c. 138, § 25A, is aimed solely at brand owners and wholesalers. But, c. 93A § 11, not c. 138, § 25A, per se, is the focus of the plaintiff's 
complaint. As to that, see note 11, infra."
1427,8," Accordingly, we are not required to decide whether such an action exists. We note, however, that c. 138 contains no express 
provision for a private right of action and that § 25A was added to the General Laws by St. 1946, c. 304, the emergency 
preamble to which noted that the acts the statute prohibited ""contributed to a disorderly distribution of alcoholic beverages"" and 
that deferred operation of the statute would ""be contrary to the interests of temperance."" See Supreme Malt Prod. Co. v. 
Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., 334 Mass. 59, 62, 133 N.E.2d 775 (1956); Miller Brewing Co. v. Alcoholic Bevs. Control 
Commn., 56 Mass. App. Ct. at 807. But cf.  Capital Distrib. Co. v. Heublein, Inc., 50 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 342, 737 N.E.2d 498 
(2000). We also note that G. L. c. 138, § 23, provides that the licensing scheme at the heart of the chapter's regulatory 
mechanism is not intended to create rights for individuals engaged in the liquor distribution business but is instead designed to 
serve the public need and common good. Finally, we note that each reported case dealing with the subject has rejected private 
efforts to coax a right of action out of some alleged violation of c. 138.  Cimino v. Milford Keg, Inc., 385 Mass. 323, 327, 431

Wholesalers of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Net Contents, Inc., 10 F. Supp. 2d 84, 86-87 (D. Mass. 1998) (general violations of c. 
138). See generally All  Brands Container Recovery, Inc. v. Merrimack Valley Distrib. Co., 54 Mass. App. Ct. 297, 300-303, 764 
N.E.2d 931 (2002)."
1427,9," The plaintiff could have, but did not, move to amend the complaint after the motion to dismiss was allowed. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 
15(a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974); Smith & Zobel, Rules Practice § 15.4 (1974). It chose not to seek an amendment and elected to 
stand on the theory expressed in the amended complaint as initially pleaded. "
1428,10," Although the FTC Act ""has heavy historical roots in antitrust law,"" Purity Supreme, Inc. v. Attorney Gen., 380 Mass. 762, 773 
n.15, 407 N.E.2d 297 (1980), the FTC's powers are not constrained by the antitrust laws' precise contours. See PMP Assocs., 
Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 366 Mass. 593, 595-596, 321 N.E.2d 915 (1975); Ciardi v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., 436 Mass. at 
68-70 (Sosman, J., dissenting). See also note 11, infra."
1428,11," The cited portion of § 11 is one of the exceptions countenanced by the broad provision of G. L. c. 93, § 14A, that ""the 
Massachusetts Antitrust Act shall have no effect upon the provisions of [c. 93A], except as explicitly provided in said [c. 93A]."""
1428,12," When it adopted the broad language of § 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act, Congress ""considered, and rejected, the notion that it reduce 
the ambiguity of the phrase 'unfair methods of competition' by tying the concept of unfairness to a common-law or statutory 
standard or by enumerating the particular practices to which it was intended to apply."" Federal Trade Commn. v. Sperry & 
Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 240, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170, 92 S. Ct. 898 (1972). The FTC nevertheless has, recently at least, 
exercised sparingly the enforcement and interpretive powers that broad language invites. As the FTC explained in In re Gen. 
Foods Corp., 103 F.T.C. 204, 365 (1984), ""While Section 5 may empower the [FTC] to pursue those activities which offend the 'basic policies' of the antitrust laws, we 
do not believe that power should be used to reshape those policies when they have been clearly expressed and 
circumscribed"" (footnote omitted). See, e.g., E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co. v. Federal Trade Commn., 729 F.2d 128, 137-138 (2d Cir. 1984). In the area 
nominally covered by the Robinson-Patman Act, the FTC's only significant movement beyond the Act itself has occurred in the 
area of knowing buyer inducements of discriminatory promotional allowances and services, which, unlike knowing inducements 
of prohibited discriminatory prices, the Act itself does not prohibit. See 15 U.S.C. § 13(f). See generally Grand Union Co. v. 
Federal Trade Commn., 300 F.2d 92 (2d Cir. 1962); Giant Food, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commn., 113 U.S. App. D.C. 227, 307

1428,13," Section 2(a) also prohibits discrimination that injures competitors of a seller's favored customers (secondary line competition), 
Federal Trade Commn. v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 42-44, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822, 44 F.T.C. 1499 (1948), or has an 
adverse impact on competing customers of the favored and disfavored purchasers.  Falls City Indus., Inc. v. Vanco Bev., Inc., "

Price Discrimination Regulation, 16 B.C. Indus. & Com. L. Rev. 151, 178-183 (1975). Those types of discrimination, and the 
separate analytical matrices attendant on them, are inapplicable here."
1429,14," At the secondary line, which this case does not involve, the Robinson-Patman Act does protect against injury to competitors. 
See note 13, supra. See also In re Gen. Motors Corp., 103 F.T.C. 641, 701 (1984). See generally Scher, Antitrust Advisor § 4.03 
(4th ed. rev. 2001). "
1430,15," Disappearance of the section is consistent with two features of the new, streamlined Massachusetts Antitrust Act. First, § 5 of 
the new Act globally prohibited all attempts to monopolize, of which old § 8 violations were but one variety. Second, insofar as 
competition at the primary line was concerned, G. L. c. 93, § 14F, which had been inserted by St. 1938, c. 410, and amended by 
St. 1941, c. 494, and which was unaffected by the 1978 changes, prohibited certain predatory pricing, whether or not 
discriminatory, done with the intent to injure either competition or competitors. At the primary line, therefore, § 14F already did 
the work of old § 8 and then some."
1430,16," Referral to the ABCC was necessary because trade practices permitted by a State agency charged with responsibility for 
overseeing a particular industry typically do not violate c. 93A. SDK Med. Computer Serv. Corp. v. Professional Operating Mgmt. 
Group, Inc., 371 Mass. 117, 126-127, 354 N.E.2d 852 (1976). Moreover, the impact and effect of some industry practices are 
arcane and can be determined only with insights flowing from administrative expertise. See, e.g., Whitehall Co., Ltd. v. Alcoholic 
Bevs. Control Commn., 7 Mass. App. Ct. 538, 389 N.E.2d 419 (1979); M. H. Gordon & Son, Inc. v. Alcoholic Bevs. Control

Mass. App. Ct. 381, 551 N.E.2d 545 (1990)."
1430,17," Given the allegations of the complaint, allegations that are tantamount to a claim that the defendants were engaged in illegal 
competition and not the restraint thereof, see note 5, supra, our decision is concerned solely with the existence in this case of a 
private right of action. It has no impact on the ABCC's power to enforce the price discrimination provisions of c. 138, § 25A, 
through administrative proceedings aimed at an alleged offender's license. See Miller Brewing Co. v. Alcoholic Bevs. Control 
Commn., 56 Mass. App. Ct. at 805-808. "
1445,1," Rule 12(b) provides that if HN1[

relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be 
treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable 
opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (emphasis added). However this Court has ""complete discretion to determine whether or not to accept any 
material beyond the pleadings that is offered in conjunction with a 12(b)(6) motion."" Stauske v. Healtheast, Inc., No. 91-cv-1265,

Procedure § 1366 (1966)). "
1447,2," Although Plaintiff's first count alleges violations of Section 1, it also uses phrases, such as ""monopoly power"" which are, strictly 
speaking, Section 2 concepts, see § B infra. However, consistent with principles of liberal construction of the complaint, the court 
will ignore these technical misstatements. "
1449,3," As discussed below, for purposes of determining whether concerted action is unreasonable, courts usually analyze the alleged 
combination as either ""horizontal"" (between or among competitors on the same level of business) or ""vertical"" (between entities 
operating on different levels, e.g., manufacturer and distributor)."
1449,4," If the Commonwealth had succeeded in demonstrating any of these types of anticompetitive conduct, the defendants may have 
lost the protection they otherwise would have had under the Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act of 1980, 15 U.S.C. §§ 3501-
3503. See  PepsiCo, Inc. 836 F.2d at 175. "

where complaint alleged ""highly implausible"" conspiracy) (aff'd 2 F. Supp. 2d 226, 230 (D.R.I. 1998) (quoting Matsushita's 
""rational economic motive"" language in dismissing complaint)); United Magazine Co. v. Murdoch Mag. Distrib., 146 F. Supp. 2d

motion for summary judgment, not a motion to dismiss, here, the plaintiffs have pled facts which, even if true and viewed in the

at this stage.""). Cf.  Car Carriers v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1109-10 (7th Cir. 1984) (pre-dating Matsushita, yet holding 
dismissal was appropriate where complaint set forth no facts showing anti-competitive effect and alleged conspiracy was

43 (N.D. Miss. 2000) (granting Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings where plaintiffs failed to establish inference of 
conspiracy, in part due to lack of rational economic motive to conspire). "
1453,6," Plaintiff places much emphasis on the Third Circuit's decision in Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 462 (3d Cir. 
1998). There, the plaintiff, a price-cutting distributor, alleged that his full-price competitors had joined together and persuaded 
their mutual suppliers not to sell to him. The Court of Appeals concluded that the plaintiff's allegations should be analyzed using 
the per se framework. The economic impact of their actions -- driving a price-cutting competitor out of business -- is clear …. Importantly, all of this 
[conspiratorial] activity was done against the backdrop of [the competitors'] dissatisfaction with Rossi's price-cutting 
proclivities, and thus an inference can be drawn that the conspiracy was at least partially conceived as a price restraint. For these reasons, we find it implausible that the alleged behavior by the defendants would ""enhance overall efficiency and 
make markets more competitive,"" Northwest Wholesale Stationers, 472 U.S. at 294. Rossi 156 F.3d at 464 (emphasis added). The conspiracy alleged in Rossi was not completely horizontal, in that the plaintiff's 
theory involved both horizontal and vertical components, i.e., the distributors who competed with Rossi and the suppliers who 
allegedly acquiesced in the boycott. In the instant case, even if this Court were to find horizontal, as well as vertical components, 
there is no allegation of price cutting, or any other impact on price, whatsoever. For that reason, the Rossi decision, though 
insightful, does not bear directly on these facts. "
1457,7," As a recent economic commentator noted, ""The antitrust laws and antitrust enforcement institutions are not designed or well 
suited to identify and ""fix"" all market imperfections that lead markets to depart from textbook models of perfect competition. 
Neither the state of economic science, nor the capabilities of public and private policy enforcement institutions, would make it 
feasible or desirable for antitrust policy to seek to identify a wide range of market imperfections, and associated firm behavior 
and market structures, and then to evaluate each case to determine whether some way can be found to improve economic 
efficiency by changing the structure of the market or constraining firm behavior. This kind of micromanagement of firms and 
markets cannot be successful because it would involve enormous transaction costs. U.S. antitrust policy is primarily a deterrence system not a regulatory system. That is, antitrust policy and the associated 
enforcement hierarchy are not, in general, designed broadly to scrutinize, screen, or approve firm behavior or market structures 
throughout the economy. Instead, antitrust policy relies on administrative and case law developed through public and private 
antitrust enforcement actions to develop a set of ""antitrust legal rules"" which businesses are expected to internalize into their 
decisions. The incentives firms have to understand and adhere to antitrust rules derive from the potential costs of treble damage 
actions, administrative restrictions on their behavior, other equitable relief (e.g., divestiture), and for certain infringements (e.g., 
price fixing), fines and prison terms all weighted by the probability of getting caught and convicted."" Joskow, ""Transaction Cost Economics, Antitrust Rules, and Remedies"", Journal of Law, Economic and Organization (April 
2002). "
1458,8," It is not clear from the Amended Complaint whether Plaintiff wishes to also make a claim of conspiracy to monopolize under 
Section Two Nevertheless, the facts alleged do not support such a claim. HN32[
] To properly state a conspiracy to 
monopolize claim a plaintiff ""must allege facts constituting the conspiracy, its period and object, and what the alleged participants 
did to achieve the conspiracy's object."" Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, Inc. v. American Bar Ass'n, 855 F. Supp. 108, 
110 (E.D. Pa. 1994), aff'd 107 F.3d 1026 (3d Cir. 1997). Plaintiff has made no effort to describe the supposed ""combination,"" 
other than the vague allegation that Nielsen and Arbitron have ""entered into a corporate financial relationship by which Nielsen 
and Arbitron are related in regard to the new system, the details of which are not known to plaintiff."" Amended Complaint P 11. "
1477,1," When Chevron purchased the Vernal phosphate mine it assumed an existing phosphate sales contract with Cominco, Ltd., a 
phosphate fertilizer producer in western Canada. Prior to the time the pipeline became operational, Chevron supplied Cominco 
by trucking phosphate to a railhead near Park City, Utah. In 1988, Cominco cancelled its phosphate contract with Chevron, 
concluding that it could obtain all the phosphate it needed at a lower cost from its own mining operations. Neither Chevron nor its 
successor-in-interest, SF, ever sold phosphate concentrate to a third-party after 1988, despite repeatedly trying to find outsider 
purchasers. During the entire time Chevron owned and operated the pipeline, no additional phosphate mines were developed in 
the United States and, after 1988, there were no third-party phosphate sales from a western United States phosphate mine. In 
1992, Chevron completely exited the business by selling its interest in the entire integrated fertilizer project to SF for $ 64 million, 
only half of what it paid for the Vernal mine alone."
1477,2," As set out more fully below, Ashley Creek has no employees, no credit history, and no assets other than these undeveloped 
phosphate leases. John Archer, Ashley Creek's sole shareholder, pays, on behalf of Ashley Creek, $ 11,000 per year for the 
leases. "
1478,3," The ICC Termination Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (1995), abolished the ICC and transferred certain 
functions and pre-existing proceedings to the STB effective January 1, 1996."
1478,4," Appended to the 1996 Order were several tables evaluating the reasonableness of the tariffs at different volumes of phosphate 
shipped through the pipeline."
1478,5," The parties vigorously contested before the district court, and continue to contest on appeal, whether the 1996 Order 
definitively concluded that the published tariffs were unreasonable or, instead, merely provided a framework for analyzing the 
reasonableness of the tariffs for the district court to apply. The district court concluded that the 1996 Order merely set out an 
analytical framework to be applied by it and that the necessary analysis ""hinged on the resolution of substantial factual 
questions."" Utilizing a new tariff published by SF in 1999, along with the three previously published tariffs utilized by the STB in 
conducting its analysis, the district court ultimately concluded that the tariffs were reasonable. In light of this court's affirmance 
infra of the district court's conclusion that Ashley Creek lacks standing to bring its antitrust claims, we need not address the 
propriety of the district court's alternative ruling that the published tariffs were reasonable."
1478,6," In 1999, SF published a new tariff, the fourth tariff to be published since 1989. The fourth tariff recovers only operating and new 
capital costs, not original capital costs. Although this fourth tariff played a key role in the district court's decision that the 
published tariffs on the pipeline were reasonable, this court need not reach the issue. "
1481,7," To the extent that Ashley Creek's appellate filings could be read to hint at an antitrust claim relating to its potential entry into the 
phosphate fertilizer market, we agree with the district court that there is absolutely no evidence in the record that Ashley Creek 
was ever prepared to enter that market. Accordingly, this court, like the district court, restricts its analysis to Ashley Creek's 
claims regarding the phosphate concentrate market. "
1482,8," We note with some frustration that Ashley Creek completely fails to distinguish between the actions of Chevron and SF in 
asserting that it was prepared to enter the market for phosphate concentrate. Whether Ashley Creek was prepared to enter the 
market during the time Chevron controlled the pipeline is a distinct question from whether Ashley Creek was prepared to enter 
the market when SF was in control of the pipeline. Likewise, whether the actions of Chevron or SF rendered such preparation 
futile presents different questions. Ashley Creek never distinguished between the actions of Chevron and SF before the district 
court and does not do so on appeal. Nevertheless, our review of the entire appellate record leads this court to conclude that 
Ashley Creek was never prepared to enter the market during the entire time frame at issue."
1482,9," Although Ashley Creek asserts in its brief that it ""obtained a contract"" for water, it does not appear that such a contract was 
ever executed. Instead, the record demonstrates only that it engaged in negotiations with the Uintah Water Conservancy District 
and the Department of Interior regarding water supplies."
1482,10," In support of this assertion, Ashley Creek cites to page 669 of SF's appendix. This citation is to the text of Ashley Creek's own 
memorandum in opposition to SF's motion for summary judgment. That memorandum does assert that Ashley Creek began 
negotiations with the BLM to acquire an appropriate parcel of land in Rock Springs for drying and loading facilities. Nevertheless, 
the cited exhibits attached to the memorandum do not support the proposition. Instead, the referenced exhibits relate exclusively 
to negotiations between Ashley Creek, the Department of Interior, and the Uintah Water Conservancy District regarding water 
supplies for a potential mining project. Accordingly, Ashley Creek has not directed this court to any record support for the 
assertion. We further note that Ashley Creek's consistent practice of citing to its own factual assertions in its various legal 
memoranda filed below, rather than citing to the relevant portions of the record supporting a given factual assertion has seriously 
delayed the resolution of this appeal. "
1483,11," It is far from clear how this supposed preparatory step is different from the fifth preparatory step identified by Ashley Creek as 
both are supported by the same ultimate citation to a Notice of Intention to Commence Mining Operations and Mining and 
Reclamation Plan, Form MR-1."
1483,12," In support of this assertion, Ashley Creek cites to three separate pages of its memorandum in opposition to SF's motion for 
summary judgment. Although the memorandum does use the term ""customers,"" only one customer, Cominco, is identified and 
supported by a citation to record evidence."
1483,13," In support of this assertion, Ashley Creek cites to page 669 of SF's appendix, again a citation to Ashley Creek's memorandum 
in opposition to SF's motion for summary judgment rather than a citation to record evidence. The only relevant material on the 
referenced page is the following paragraph: Discussions with potential customers and regarding financing were necessarily preliminary and inconclusive. While a 
number of correspondents indicated interest if the pipeline were constructed and available at economic rates, in the 
absence of a reliable statement of pipeline transport costs, no estimate of Ashley Creek's potential price for phosphate 
concentrate FOB Rock Springs could be given potential customers allowing discussions to go further. Absent clear 
expressions of interest from potential customers, discussions of financing could not progress. The assertions in Ashley Creek's memorandum regarding commencing inquiries as to financing are not supported by a citation 
to record evidence. Accordingly, Ashley Creek has once again directed this court to a portion of the voluminous record that does 
not support its factual assertions. Counsel is reminded that HN11[
] this court ""will not search the record in an effort to 
determine whether there exists dormant evidence which might require submission of the case to a jury."" Gross v. Burggraf 
Constr. Co., 53 F.3d 1531, 1546 (10th Cir. 1995). Accordingly, Ashley Creek has provided no record support for the assertion 
that it made initial inquiries regarding financing. "
1484,14," Ashley Creek, 129 F. Supp. 2d at 1305-06; see also supra pp. 18-19 (discussing district court's analysis of Ashley Creek's 
futility claim). "
1485,15," The history of these particular mineral leases reveal multiple failed attempts to develop the phosphate deposits. Archer first 
acquired the leases from Utah in 1963; he immediately sold the leases to Mountain Fuel Supply Company. Mountain Fuel failed 
to develop a mine and, instead, allowed the leases to lapse. Archer reacquired the leases in 1974 and assigned them to Utah 
International in 1975. Utah International also failed to develop a mine, after determining that development was not feasible at 
then-current and projected phosphate prices. After the leases were re-assigned to Archer in 1984, he attempted to sell them to 
Chevron and Cominco. Both companies indicated that they were not interested. In 1997, Archer approached Agrium about its 
interest in investing in the leases. Agrium declined the invitation. Accordingly, the record reveals that every company Ashley 
Creek approached has failed or declined to develop the leases."
1485,16," That is, when the plaintiff's claimed injury to property flows from its claim that it would have used the property as part of an 
anticipated business venture. "
1488,17," See, e.g., SF's Reply Memorandum in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss, at 2-3 (""Ashley Creek is appealing a 1998 Utah District 
Court decision denying Ashley Creek's motion to dismiss the SF Defendant's counterclaims on the pleadings. On March 12, 
2001, the district court dismissed these same claims without prejudice. As a result of that dismissal, Ashley Creek's appeal no 
longer relates to a live case or controversy. Since the SF Defendants may never refile the counterclaims, it is at best uncertain 
whether a ruling by this Court would have any effect. Certainly, Ashley Creek cannot guarantee that any decision by this Court 
whether the district court should have dismissed the counterclaims because they were not pled properly would be anything but 
an academic exercise."")."
1488,18," In so ruling, the Jarvis court was careful to indicate that the result would have been entirely different if the district court had 
declined to rule on the merits of the employer's motion for summary judgment. Jarvis v. Nobel/Sysco Food Servs. Co., 985 
F.2d 1419, 1425(10th Cir. 1993). In such a circumstance, the employer would have presented an issue not passed upon by the 
district court; appellate courts generally will not consider such issues in the first instance. Id.(citing Pell v. Azar Nut Co., 711 F.2d 
949, 950 (10th Cir. 1983)). HN22[
] District courts would be wise to keep in mind the rule set out in Jarvis and Pell when faced with a complaint invoking 
the court's federal question jurisdiction which also includes pendent state law claims. As this court noted in Bauchman ex rel. 
Bauchman v. West High Sch., 132 F.3d 542, 549(10th Cir. 1997), The United States Supreme Court has counseled, pendent jurisdiction ""need not be exercised in every case in which it is found 
to exist. . . . Needless decisions of state law should be avoided both as a matter of comity and to promote justice between the "
1489,," parties, by procuring for them a surer-footed reading of applicable law."" [United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726, 16 L. 
Ed. 2d 218, 86 S. Ct. 1130 (1966)]. If federal claims are dismissed before trial, leaving only issues of state law, ""the federal court 
should decline the exercise of jurisdiction by dismissing the case without prejudice."" [Carnegie-Mellon University v. Cohill, 484 
U.S. 343, 350, 98 L. Ed. 2d 720, 108 S. Ct. 614 (1988); Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 726]. HN23[
] Taken together, Jarvis, Pell, and Bauchman counsel against deciding dispositive motions addressed to pendent state 
law claims unless it appears that a federal claim will proceed to trial or a decision is necessary because of some peculiar aspect 
of the case (e.g., coordination of trial docket and discovery). This is especially true where, as here, the state law the district court 
must apply to dispose of the motion is undeveloped. Absent such restraint, the parties may well be deprived of the ""surer-footed 
reading of applicable law"" that would be provided them by the relevant state court.  Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 726."
1489,19," This is so because HN26[
] the gravamen of the misconduct . . . is not the wrongful procurement of legal process or the wrongful initiation of 
criminal or civil proceedings; it is the misuse of process, no matter how properly obtained, for any purpose other than that 
which it was designed to accomplish. Therefore, it is immaterial that the process was properly issued, that it was obtained 
in the course of proceedings that were brought with probable cause and for a proper purpose, or even that the proceedings 
termination in favor of the person instituting or initiating them. The subsequent misuse of the process, though properly 
obtained, constitutes the misconduct for which the liability is imposed under this rule . . . ."" Restatement (Second) of Torts § 682, cmt. a (1977); see also William L. Prosser, Prosser on Torts § 121, at 856(4th ed. 
1971)(""The HN27[
] gist of the tort [of abuse of process] is not commencing an action or causing process to issue without 
justification, but misusing, or misapplying process justified in itself for an end other than that which it was designed to 
accomplish. The purpose for which the process is used, once it is issued, is the only thing of importance. Consequently, . . . it is 
unnecessary for the plaintiff to prove that the proceeding has terminated in his favor . . . ."" (footnote omitted)). "
1490,20," Cf. also Mann v. Genoa Twp., 2002 Ohio 727, 2002 WL 221112 at 7(Ohio Ct. App. Feb. 11, 2002)(holding that trial court erred

222, 525 N.Y.S.2d 978, 979 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988)(holding that defendant's counterclaim for abuse of process actually stated

397 So. 2d 1160, 1166 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1981)(noting that a malicious prosecution claim does not ripen until the termination of 
the underlying proceedings supposedly giving rise to the claim)."
1490,21, Chevron's ripe counterclaim is identical in substance and substantially similar in text. 
1491,22," Because this court concludes that this aspect of Chevron's and SF's counterclaims is facially deficient, we need not address 
Ashley Creek's contention that the claim fails because Chevron and SF were actually intervenors in the relevant proceedings. "
1517,1," By letter dated November 8, 2002 (Doc. # 870), the court was advised that Hospital Defendants, Children's Hospital of 
Michigan, Detroit Receiving Hospital and University Health Center, The Johns Hopkins Health System, Loma Linda University 
Medical Center and St. Anthony Hospital - Central are presently represented by LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae (""LeBoeuf,

Angeles, Irvine, and San Diego, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, University Hospital at the University of New 
Mexico School of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital, Children's Hospital - San Diego and University Medical 
Center (Tuscon, Arizona). "
1518,2," Both sides handed up supplemental authorities following oral argument, the court has reviewed such authorities, however, 
because of their bulk, the submissions were not filed. Plaintiffs and Defendants submitted additional arguments and authorities 
by letters dated November 12th, 13th, 18th and 21st, 2002 (Doc. Nos. 871, 872, 873, and 874, respectively)."
1518,3, Taken from the pleadings and papers filed in connection with the instant motion and cross motion.
1518,4," As a result of prior motions to dismiss and withdraw, the number of Plaintiffs has been reduced to 154."
1518,5," At oral argument, Plaintiffs stated the present number was now closer to 10,000. "
1519,6," As noted, 14 Hospital Defendants have been dismissed based on various immunity and personal jurisdiction grounds, and two 
Hospital Defendants were dismissed following settlements with Plaintiffs. Thus, 12 Hospital Defendants, all private 
organizations, remain in the action, including Forsyth Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit Receiving Hospital

Medical Center, Lutheran General Hospital, Mercy Catholic Medical Center - Misericordia Division, Mercy Hospital and Medical

1519,7," Following commencement of this action, the Board of Certification of Emergency Medicine (""BCEM"") was established which 
permitted physicians to become certified with an emergency medicine residency qualification or, until 1997, based on 10,000 
hours of experience in emergency medicine practice over at least six years. Defendants' Memorandum at 19. As of May 2000, 
60 Plaintiffs have become BCEM certified. "

1522,9," Although Defendants' cross motion is brought pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P 12(b)(1) (lack of subject matter jurisdiction), the court 
finds that the motion attacks Plaintiffs' standing based on whether Plaintiffs have ""a sufficient stake in a judicial controversy to 
obtain judicial resolution of that controversy."" Siena Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 731-32, 31 L. Ed. 2d 636, 92 S. Ct. 1361 
(1972). See also Physicians Health Services, supra, at 116-17 (distinguishing between a lack of standing based on absence of 
an injury in fact sufficient to create a case or controversy under Article III and other statements of the standing doctrine). 
Accordingly, the court treats Defendants' motion as one brought pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). See Finkelstein v. Aetna 
Health Plans of New York, Inc., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10759, 1997 WL 419211, *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 1997) (dismissing, upon

Volumes II (Keil-Wayne) or III (Alexander - Gross), Exhibit K of Appendix to Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Opposition to 
Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification and In Support of Defendant's Cross-Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing (Doc. Nos. 
773-775) filed under seal. "
1527,11," Despite Plaintiffs' contention at oral argument, the court finds Plaintiffs have not alleged a group boycott. HN8[
] To be 
actionable under the antitrust laws, boycotts or concerted refusals to deal ""generally involve[] joint efforts by a firm or firms to 
disadvantage competitors by 'either directly denying or persuading or coercing suppliers or customers to deny relationships the 
competitors need in the competitive struggle.'"" Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationary and Printing Co., 472 
U.S. 284, 292, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, 105 S. Ct. 2613 (1985) (citing authorities and cases) (underlining added). However, Plaintiffs 
have alleged that ""defendants' unlawful conspiracy in closing the practice track has precluded the plaintiffs … from attaining 
ABEM certification or ABEM eligibility and thereby competing with ABEM eligible physicians."" Second Amended Complaint P 8 
(underlining added). Plaintiffs construe their allegations in a similar manner. ""In the present case, plaintiffs have clearly alleged 
that there is a market for ABEM - certified emergency - medicine physicians to which they have been denied access."" Plaintiffs' 
Reply at 11. (underlying added). It is unclear how Plaintiffs can be considered competitors in the relevant market if they allege 
the conspiracy deprives them of that status. Significantly, in each case relied on by Plaintiffs, the plaintiff was an established 
competitor of defendants. However, assuming for the sake of analysis that Plaintiffs have asserted a group boycott because, as 
discussed, Plaintiffs seek to benefit from the same credential that will enable them to realize higher compensation -- and thus 
costs to consumers -- their inability to demonstrate a procompetitive effect by lowering prices through greater competition, 
resulting from greater access to the market, defeats antitrust standing. Even allowing for application of the principles of liberal 
construction and alternate theories of pleading, the court fails to see how Plaintiffs can be found to have asserted group boycott 
claims sufficient to establish antitrust standing on that basis. "
1530,12," The fact that inTodorov plaintiff sought lost profits as an independent business entity and in this case, Plaintiffs seek extra 
compensation typically as employees of a hospital or medical corporation providing services to a hospital under contract is 
irrelevant. In either event, the alleged lost profits in Todorov or the lost additional compensation in the form of extra salary "
1531,," claimed as damages in the instant action derive from artificially high pricing levels created by the antitrust violation challenged by 
the respective plaintiffs."
1531,13, A copy of the decision is attached to Doc. No. 871. 
1533,14," As Plaintiffs discuss first the eligibility of Plaintiffs' motion under Rule 23(b)(3), Plaintiffs' Revised Memorandum at 25, the court 
will follow this order. "
1537,15," Referring to orders staying discovery directed to the merits of Plaintiffs' causes of action and Defendants' defenses dated April 
29, 1994 (Doc. No. 139) and February 21, 1996 (Doc. No. 470). "
1544,16," Decl. refers to the aforementioned Plaintiffs' respective Declaration attached to Plaintiffs' Revised Memorandum of Law 
(Doc. No. 761). "
1545,17," Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' Rule 23(b)(2) certification was not pleaded in the Second Amended Complaint. However, 
certification was alleged ""pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23 as a proper action."" Second Amended Complaint P 1. While P 44 refers to 
Rule 23(b)(3) the prayer for relief, Second Amended Complaint Section X, requests relief pursuant to Rule 23. Moreover, 
Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Support of Class Certification filed February 24, 1994 (Doc. No. 70) and Plaintiffs' Revised 
Memorandum of Law argue for certification under Rule 23(b)(2) as well as (b)(3). Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law in Support of 
Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification at 29-31; Plaintiffs' Revised Memorandum at 34-37. Given the requirement that federal 
pleadings be liberally construed, the court should treat Plaintiffs' motion as one brought pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2)and (b)(3)."
1545,18," In Visa Check the estimated damages were $ 63 billion, Visa Check, 192 F.R.D. at 88-89; in this case, assuming a class of 
only 10,000 and based on the 14 years that have elapsed since 1988, without trebling and interest, the requested damages are 
$ 7 billion. Using Plaintiffs' start date of 1994, when the Second Amended Complaint was filed as suggested, without authority, 
by Plaintiffs, at oral argument, based on the alleged class of 14,000, the damages would be $ 4.2 billion. "
1546,19," The court notes HN42[
] cases where the mere request for treble damages in an antitrust action was held to place the action outside the parameters of class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). See Hall v. Burger King Corp., 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18687, 
1992 WL 372354, * 11 (S.D.Fla. Oct. 26, 1992) (""it is settled that where antitrust plaintiffs seek treble damages, certification 
under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper even if injunctive relief is sought at well); Christiana Mortgage Corporation v. Delaware 
Mortgage Bankers Association, 136 F.R.D. 372, 381-82 (D. Del. 1991) (""it is generally inappropriate in an antitrust suit seeking 
treble damages to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2)""); In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litigation, 73 F.R.D. 322, 341-42 (E.D.Pa. 
1976) (concluding that class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is inappropriate where treble damages are ""significant part"" of the 
action's damage aspect); and Al Barnett & Son, Inc. v. Outboard Marine Corp., 64 F.R.D. 43, 53 (D.Del. 1974) (holding class 
certification in antitrust action was only available under Rule 23(b)(3) as recovery of treble damages was predominant 
consideration, rendering class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) inappropriate). "
1555,1, The second motion-Motion to Dismiss Complaint-is brought by a group of eight other Defendants besides Powerex.
1555,2, The PX is no longer operational. 
1557,3," Section 824e(a) states, in pertinent part, that FERC ""shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, 
regulation, practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force, and shall fix the same by order."" See 16 U.S.C. § 
824e(a)."
1557,4," Judge Walker's opinion in Lynch contains a comprehensive and in-depth discussion regarding the history and genesis of the 
filed rate doctrine. "
1558,5," Although not binding authority, the Court notes that in Day v. AT&T Co., 63 Cal. App. 4th 325, 336, 74 Cal. Rptr. 2d 55(1998), 
the California Court of Appeals held, in a case involving claims brought under the UCL challenging rates that had been filed by 
common carriers with the Federal Communications Commission, that ""[a] claim attacking rate practices made public in the filed 
tariff schedules asks this court in involve itself in the rate-making process, which it cannot do."" Further, the court held that 
plaintiffs ""may not seek to recover any money from respondents, whether they label their request one for disgorgement or 
otherwise."" 63 Cal. App. 4th at 337 (emphasis added). "
1562,6," In regard to its first argument, Plaintiff also points out that the FPA contains a policy declaration that federal regulation of the 
transmission and sale of electric energy was ""to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States."" "
1563,16," U.S.C. § 824(a). Plaintiff claims that California antitrust and unfair competition regulation of utilities were areas of state 
regulation contemplated by the policy declaration. The Supreme Court has rejected this contention, however, stating: HN16[
] 
""the policy declaration that federal regulation is 'to extend only to those matters which are not subject to regulation by the States' 
is one of great generality. It cannot nullify a clear and specific grant of jurisdiction, even if the particular grant seems inconsistent 
with the broadly expressed purpose."" Connecticut Light & Power Co. v. Federal Power Comm'n, 324 U.S. 515, 527, 89 L. Ed. 
1150, 65 S. Ct. 749 (1945)."
1563,7," The Supreme Court's decision in Schneidewind also dispels Plaintiff's argument that the relief it requests must directly regulate 
Wholesale rates to be preempted. There, the state statue regulating the issuance of securities did not directly regulate wholesale 
rates, but was nevertheless preempted because it could force gas companies to raise rates by preventing them from issuing 
securities. 485 U.S. at 308(""By keeping a natural gas company from raising its equity levels above a certain point, Michigan 
seeks to ensure that the company will charge only what Michigan considers to be a 'reasonable rate.' This is regulation of 
rates.""). "
1564,8," Plaintiff also cites several cases that followed Otter Tail and concluded electric utilities are not immune from federal antitrust 
laws. See, e.g. Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579, 596 n.35, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1141, 96 S. Ct. 3110 (1976). These cases do 
not deal with the issue of federal preemption of state law, however, and also have little bearing here. "
1587,1," Eventually, of course, plaintiffs must establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, either at a pretrial evidentiary 
hearing or at trial. Behagen v. Amateur Basketball Ass'n of U.S.A., 744 F.2d 731, 733 (10th Cir. 1984); Wilson v. Olathe 
Bank, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5509, 1998 WL 184470, at *1 (D. Kan. March 2, 1998). "
1588,2," The court notes that this affidavit indicates defendant Ueno USA did not sell sorbates products to four of the five plaintiffs 
herein. The affidavit does not reference plaintiff Falley's, Inc. "
1590,3," The court notes that, HN12[
] in contrast to claims of tortious behavior, a civil antitrust violation brought pursuant to federal 
antitrust law may be established without evidence of unlawful intent. A showing of an anticompetitive effect may be sufficient. 
McLain v. Real Estate Bd. of New Orleans, Inc., 444 U.S. 232, 62 L. Ed. 2d 441, 100 S. Ct. 502 (1980); United States v. 
United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854, 98 S. Ct. 2864 (1978). "
1592,4," The court finds these allegations are uncontroverted by any of defendant Ueno USA's submittals. Although defendant Ueno 
USA's affidavit indicates that it does ""not sell any sorbates products to any resident of Kansas"" and sets out the distribution 
channels through which it receives and sells its sorbate products, it does not refute plaintiffs' allegations that its business 
activities of selling and distributing sorbates were placed in the stream of commerce. In fact, defendant Ueno USA's affidavit 
indicates that, at one point in the distribution chain through which it receives its sorbates, goods are delivered ""for sale to 
customers in the United States."" (Def. Ueno USA's Mot., Komatsu aff. at P5). "
1595,5," The court finds that the plaintiffs' allegations regarding the placement of the defendants' products in the stream of commerce or 
the effect that their placement had on the Kansas economy have not been controverted by either defendant Chisso Corp. or 
defendant Ueno Ltd. Defendant Ueno Ltd. made the same showing as noted above for defendant Ueno USA. In addition, 
defendant Chisso Corp. verified that it ""sells sorbates to several Japanese corporations"" that then ""resell the sorbates to other 
distributors that sell the product either to still other distributors or to the end users."" (Def. Chisso's Mot., Akuzawa aff. at P2). 
Defendant Chisso also verified that it ""does not control the activities of [the corporations] that sell its products."" "
1605,*," Honorable Barbara S. Jones, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
1621,1," Practice Book Section 17-45 provides in part: HN4[
] ""A motion for summary judgment shall be supported by such documents 
as may be appropriate, including but not limited to affidavits, certified transcripts of testimony under oath, disclosures, written 
admissions and the like."" Plaintiffs maintain the motion should be denied because no affidavit was filed. Defendants argue that, 
since they admit all the allegations of plaintiffs' complaint for purposes of the motion, and defendants do not raise any factual 
issues, they are entitled to summary judgment in this case as a matter of law as if it were common law motion for judgment on 
the pleadings. See Boucher v. Zimmer, 160 Conn. 404, 408, 279 A.2d 540 (1971). The court agrees."
1621,2," The complaint alleges that the following activities violate the provisions of Connecticut's Antitrust Act: provisions in the 1988 
Waterford-New London agreement require the parties' best efforts to deter the construction and operation of new water systems 
in these municipalities and prohibit Waterford from developing and connecting any additional source of water supply available to 
it unless New London makes the determination that a ""water supply emergency"" exists; a 1990 agreement between Waterford 
and Montville restricts Montville's ability to develop its own water sources or water system or to purchase water from other 
sources; New London and Waterford have identified Miller's Pond as an existing and future component of their water supply 
systems in various public statements and documents without obtaining plaintiffs' consent, thereby interfering with plaintiffs' ability 
to develop and market Miller's Pond as a water source; the defendants have refused to respond to plaintiffs' attempts to sell 
them water and have refused the plaintiffs access to essential water facilities; and New London has misrepresented the capacity 
of its system to provide water to its customers in order to prevent the development of Miller's Pond as a competitive source of 
supply. R "
1623,3," As previously noted, in this case the defendants have admitted as true the factual allegations in the complaint for purposes of 
this motion only. There are no factual issues in dispute. "
1639,1," Count I also alleges that the defendants ""conspired . . . to allocate markets and to artificially raise, fix, maintain or stabilize 
pharmaceutical reimbursement rates and co-payment levels, resulting in higher prices for prescription pharmaceutical products . 
. . restraint of competition among providers . . . and an unlawful increase in market power by Defendants"" but those allegations 
are neither explained in the plaintiffs' memoranda nor supported by any proffered evidence. Am. Compl. P 72. "
1640,2," The only material difference between R.I. Gen. Laws § 6-36-6 and § 3 of the clayton Act is that § 6-36-6 applies to agreements 
for the sale of services as well as commodities. "
1645,3," It appears that an additional twenty-five percent are insured by UHC, but that statistic is of questionable relevance given the 
fact that the plaintiffs are no longer excluded from the UHC/PHS network. "
1646,4," To the extent that the alleged increase in retail prices refers to prices paid by consumers who are not covered by health care 
plans, it is difficult to see what bearing the alleged price disparity would have on the plaintiffs' claim since the plaintiffs have 
defined the relevant market as the market for reimbursed prescription pharmaceuticals. "
1649,*," Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation. "
1652,1," Going beyond the allegations of the complaint, defendants' memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss states that 
plaintiff was fired because ""in [ARC's] principals' considered view, she was not performing her duties adequately."" Yet 
defendants chose to test the complaint by Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and the district court judge quite appropriately considered the 
motion under the Rule 12(b)(6) standards. "
1659,1," ""Bull-nose"" corners are rounded corners. There are at least two different methods that can be used to create rectangular 
shortbread cookies. One method is to bake a sheet of shortbread and then cut the shortbread into rectangles, which gives the 
resulting cookies squared-off, crumbly corners. The second method, used by both BIC and Cookie Corner, is to cut the dough 
into rectangles before baking the shortbread; the baked cookies have rounded, smooth corners. "
1660,2," BIC itself confuses the questions of functionality and distinctiveness in the Oct. 30 motion. In Section I.A. of the Oct. 30 motion, 
which argues that the BIC Cookie design and packaging are nonfunctional, BIC states: ""[The BIC Cookie] trade dress does not 
serve any utilitarian function. The trade dress is distinctive and identifies BIC."" Oct. 30 Mot. at 12. "
1661,3," Fabrica's distinction between ""trade dress"" and ""product features"" is somewhat confusing given that ""trade dress"" includes 
product shape and configuration. See 1 McCarthy § 7:54. "
1662,4," Cookie Corner contends that Clicks and Pagliero can be reconciled by equating a ""purely aesthetic feature"" (which is 
nonfunctional according to Clicks) with a ""mere arbitrary embellishment, a form of dress … primarily adopted for the purposes of 
identification and individuality"" (which is nonfunctional under Pagliero). Presumably, Cookie Corner then intends to argue that 
the BIC Cookie design is neither ""purely aesthetic"" nor ""mere arbitrary embellishment."" It is not entirely clear to the court how, 
under these circumstances, reliance on Pagliero would help Cookie Corner establish that the BIC Cookie design was functional. "
1663,5," The statements highlighted by Cookie Corner include Ikawa's statements that BIC ""couldn't find a machine that could provide 
the proper angle of chocolate,"" and that the dipping line is efficient because production switches between shortbreads and 
dipped products to chocolate batches. The article also explains how BIC Cookies are manufactured."
1663,6," The court considers the articles offered by Cookie Corner, because statements directly or indirectly attributed to BIC's 
President are not hearsay, and the articles themselves are offered as evidence of touting rather than as assertions of truth. "
1664,7," McCarthy notes that there is a great deal of ""semantic confusion"" in the case law with respect to ""acquiescence,"" ""laches,"" and 
""estoppel by laches."" 5 McCarthy § 31:41. "
1666,8," While some of these cases indicate that local use may ""affect,"" rather than ""substantially affect,"" interstate commerce, the 
common view is clearly that intrastate infringement of a mark substantially affects interstate commerce when the trademark 
owner's reputation and goodwill have been ""built up by use in interstate commerce."" Franchised Stores of N.Y., Inc. v. Winter, 
394 F.2d 664 (2d Cir. 1968); 4 McCarthy § 25:56. See also  Wells Fargo & Co. v. Wells Fargo Express Co., 556 F.2d 406, 427 
(9th Cir. 1977) (citing Franchised Stores and stating that ""purely intrastate infringing activities which [have] a substantial adverse 
impact on the reputation and good will of of a registrant whose products [are] sold in interstate commerce [are] actionable""). "
1667,9," See also 4 McCarthy § 25:57 (noting that ""modern decisions interpreting the 'use in commerce' requirement for infringement of 
federally registered marks have virtually eliminated the 'local use' defense""). "
1675,1," As the majority notes, the present case is governed by the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign 
Arbitral Awards, 21 U.S.T. 2517, T.I.A.S. No. 6996, implemented by 9 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq. (""Convention"").  9 U.S.C. § 207 
commands a court to enforce an arbitration award under the Convention unless one of the grounds for refusal to enforce found 
in the Convention is present. Article V(2)(b) of the Convention allows a court to refuse to enforce an arbitration award when 
""recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of that country."""
1675,2," There is no dispute that Baxter's Ohmeda is the only generic competitor in the sevoflurane market for the foreseeable future, 
nor is there a dispute that the arbitral decision's prohibition on the sale of generic sevoflurane by Baxter preserves monopoly 
prices and levels of output of Abbott's sevoflurane product. "
1676,3," It is an important distinction that this rather meta-juridical antitrust claim ""decided"" by the arbitrators was not a simple claim by 
Baxter against Abbott, but rather a request by Baxter that the arbitrators step back and consider the larger implications of their 
underlying decision. This distinction becomes clear when one recognizes that this issue could simply have been ignored by the 
arbitrators and considered for the first time in the district court--the arbitrators' interpretation of the license and the DRA did not 
involve antitrust issues. But, if Baxter had not raised the antitrust issue during arbitration, it would have risked being met with a 
defense of waiver to consideration of the issue here. Yet, on the other hand, Baxter's position here might well have been 
strengthened if it had chosen not to bring the question forward during arbitration and thereby armed Abbott with the (dispositive, 
as it turns out) argument for deference to the arbitration award."
1676,4," The Convention itself provides grounds for refusing to confirm an award under ""public policy"" principles. This circuit has 
recognized grounds (under the Federal Arbitration Act) for refusing to confirm if an arbitration panel acts in manifest disregard of 
the law, or, as otherwise viewed, if the arbitrators' decision commands a party to act unlawfully.  George Watts & Son, Inc. v. 
Tiffany & Co., 248 F.3d 577 (7th Cir. 2001). Rather than repeatedly referring to the applicable tests, I will simply refer to 
""unlawful conduct."""
1676,5," It is clear that the arbitrators were doing exactly that-- reviewing their own decision--and not deciding issues of law necessary to 
interpret the various agreements. The panel's ""decision"" on the antitrust issues is that ""it considers that no illegality results from 
the interpretation of the Sevoflurane Agreements in this Award."" Supp. App. at 18-19. "
1677,6," My analysis takes place in the context that the meaning of the Sevoflurane Agreements, as interpreted by the arbitrators, is not 
contested by Baxter. Therefore, although the arbitrators' findings seem a bit far-fetched to me, I take as a given that the DRA 
contains a broad, if implied, covenant not to compete that prohibits Baxter from competing with Abbott in any way in the 
sevoflurane market. This, of course, does not respond to the issue of lawfulness, which is the subject of my substantive analysis."
1677,7," The majority bolsters its deference argument by glossing over some significant nuances in the various Baxter-Maruishi-Abbott 
agreements and the arbitral decision. The arbitrators did not hold ""that the license is exclusive in the strong sense. ""Maj. Op. at 
3. In fact, the arbitrators found that the license, which is limited solely to the one-step process and all associated know-how and 
technology, was not violated in any way by Baxter's actions regarding the three-step process. Supp. App. at 13-14. The ""strong"" 
noncompete was implied from the DRA, which the arbitration panel found contained its own independent cause of action and 
provided relief to Abbott for any conduct by Baxter that reduced the monopoly revenue Abbott would otherwise receive under the 
one-step licenses. In theory, under the broad language of the arbitral award, even if Baxter invented and brought to market 
(before 2005) a completely new and different inhalable anesthetic that competed with sevoflurane and reduced Abbott's 
revenues from it, Baxter would be in violation of the DRA and enjoined from any manufacture and sale. See Supp. App. at 15, 
PP 25, 26."
1677,8," I note briefly the questions raised by the Fourth Circuit's decision in Compton v. Metal Products, Inc., 453 F.2d 38 (4th Cir. 
1971). In that case, a patentee licensed its patented technology together with a broad (express) noncompete that went far 
beyond the scope of the patented technology. The court found this agreement not to compete an unlawful restraint of trade. I am 
unconvinced by the district court's efforts to distinguish Compton from the present case on the basis of the degree to which 
Baxter was restricted.  Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Intern., Inc., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5475, 2002 WL 467147, *9 (N.D. Ill March 27, 
2002). The point of Compton is that restraints on competition beyond the scope of the licensed patented technology are 
unlawful.  453 F.2d at 45 (""We think that by agreeing to restrictions on his own competition which he could not compel of others, 
the patentee has extended the monopoly granted by the patent laws beyond its legal bounds.""). This agreement to restrictions 
that extend and enhance the scope of the patent monopoly is also what is objectionable here. "
1678,9," In fact, an argument can be made that Baxter was disadvantaged compared to other competitors by virtue of its agreement with 
Abbott and association with the one-step process. Baxter would face, as it did in the arbitration in the present case, the hurdle of 
showing that it did not succumb to the temptation to use any of its existing knowledge and technology base, a hurdle not faced 
by an outside competitor. "
1683,1," This Court will treat LSNY's motion for judgment on the pleadings as a motion to dismiss as the same standard applies to both 
motions. See  Burnette v. Carothers, 192 F.3d 52, 56 (2d Cir. 1999). "
1684,2," The six other sub-grantee organizations are: Brooklyn Legal Services Corporation A, Brooklyn Legal Services Corporation B, 
Bedford-Stuyvesant Legal Services, Harlem Legal Services, MFY Legal Services, and Queens Legal Services. LSNY seeks to 
reorganize all seven of its sub-grantee organizations into wholly-owned subsidiaries."
1684,3," Plaintiff made this argument for the first time at oral argument. Nonetheless, this Court will address it. "
1685,4," With the exception of the effect on interstate commerce, the Donnelly Act was patterned after the Sherman Act. Therefore, the 
Donnelly Act is generally interpreted consistently with the Sherman Act. See  Empire Volkswagen Inc. v. World-Wide 
Volkswagen Corp., 814 F.2d 90, 98 n.4 (2d Cir. 1987); Kramer v. Pollock-Krasner Found., 890 F. Supp. 250, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 
1995). "
1686,5," In an order dated August 8, 2002, this Court granted defendants' motions for summary judgment in that case and dismissed 
that Complaint in its entirety. See  Bronx Legal Servs. v. Legal Servs. Corp., No. 00 CIV. 3423, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14674 , 
2002 WL 1835597 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 8, 2002). "
1687,6," Neither BLS nor Queens Legal Services were served with subpoenas, nor named as respondents in the enforcement 
proceeding in D.C. District Court."
1687,7, The Legal Aid Bureau was not a party to the appeal.
1687,8," See Thompson Aff. P 73, Pl's Mot. for a Prelim. Inj. "
1688,9," ""OLSC"" stands for Operating Legal Services Corporation. This is the term given to the seven legal services organizations in 
New York City (including BLS) that sub-contracted with LSNY to receive LSC funds. "
1689,10," Plaintiff's breach of fiduciary duty claim against LSC is based upon its allegation that LSC ""conspired"" with LSNY to breach 
LSNY's fiduciary duties to plaintiff. However, conspiracy to commit a tort is not in itself a cause of action under New York law. 
See  Alexander & Alexander v. Fritzen, 68 N.Y.2d 968, 503 N.E.2d 102, 510 N.Y.S.2d 546 (N.Y. 1986). Therefore, the claim 
against LSC for conspiracy to breach the fiduciary relationship must also fail for this separate and independent reason. For the 
same reasons, plaintiff's ""conspiracy"" claim against LSC for tortious interference with business relations must also fail."
1689,11," Plaintiff's request for leave to amend the Complaint in the event any of its claims are found deficient is denied. Plaintiff has 
also filed a motion for Preliminary Injunction enjoining LSNY from withholding grant funding from BLS after January 1, 2003. 
That motion is based solely upon plaintiff's claims for breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference with business relations. 
As today's decision disposes of all claims in favor of defendants, plaintiff's motion for a Preliminary Injunction is also denied. "
1712,1," I nonetheless agree with the majority's determination that the district court lacked discretion to exercise supplemental 
jurisdiction once it had dismissed all of the appellants' claims under United States law. See maj. op. at 34-36."
1712,2," Notably, the word ""claim"" in the quoted language refers to the specific claim asserted by the injured party. "
1716,1," That is a general principle, not a characterization of the particular expert retained by Defendant. Dr. Pozdena's report indicates 
that he has more than 20 years of experience researching the forest products industry. "
1717,2," ""Causal antitrust injury"" means an ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which 
makes defendants' acts unlawful."" Atlantic Richfield v. USA Petroleum, 495 U.S. 328, 334, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 
(1990). ""The antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if the loss stems from a competition-reducing 
aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior."" Id. at 344. "
1718,3," I recognize that Defendant has evidence it believes depicts a very different picture of Weyerhaeuser's actions, and the reasons 
why the Plaintiffs' sawmills are  [*13] now out of business. However, on a motion for summary judgment the evidence must be 
viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party."
1718,4," Plaintiffs repeatedly use the term ""submarket,"" as do some Ninth Circuit opinions. See, e.g., Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs, 
924 F.2d at 1490 (""A submarket exists if it is sufficiently insulated from the larger market so that supply and demand are inelastic 
with the larger market."") However, the concept of a ""submarket"" adds little to the analysis. See, e.g., Phillip Areeda, ANTITRUST 
LAW, P 533 (2d. ed 2002) (""[s]peaking of 'submarkets' merely confuses the issue""). The task is to define the relevant market in 
a given case, which is a fact-based inquiry. That the relevant market may be defined more narrowly in a given case does not 
change the ultimate inquiry. "
1719,5," The identical question and answer are in the requests for admissions posed to the other Plaintiffs (though numbered 
differently)."
1719,6," The continuing validity of this principle was restated in Blue Shield v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 472, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 
2d 149 (1982). "
1720,7," Entry barriers are ""additional long-run costs that were not incurred by the incumbent firms but must be incurred by new 
entrants."" Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1439, citing Los Angeles Land Co. v. Brunswick Corp., 6 F.3d 1422, 1427-28 (9th Cir. 1993). 
Examples of such barriers include: (1) license requirements; (2) control of an essential or superior resource; (3) entrenched 
buyer preferences for established brands; (4) capital market evaluations imposing higher  [*22] capital costs on new entrants; 
and (5) economies of scale. Id."
1720,8," Cf. Oahu Gas Service, Inc. v. Pacific Resources Inc., 838 F.2d 360, 368-69 (9th Cir. 1988) (discussing when a monopolist's 
refusal to aid a competitor violates the antitrust laws). Clearly antitrust liability may be premised upon theories other than mere 
predatory retail pricing. "
1729,1," Contrary to the defendant's paraphrasing, the court did not style this element as requiring only some kind of interference and 
no resultant breach. See Answering Brief at 9."
1729,2," Although the defendant acknowledges that ""a review of the relevant case law shows that the cases are universally precipitated 
by a breach of contract,"" it maintains that ""the absence of a total breach does not foreclose recovery for damages caused by 
improper interference."" Answering Brief at 10-11. This assertion is unpersuasive as it applies to interference with a contract, 
particularly given Allen's conspicuous failure to cite any supporting caselaw for it. Furthermore, Allen's contention that a breach 
of contract is not required in such a case because ""the applicable tort here is, for a reason, labeled 'tortious interference with 
contractual relations' not 'tortious breach of contractual relations,'"" Answering Brief at 12 n.5 (emphasis added), is astounding in 
its fatuity. The tort is not labeled ""tortious breach of contractual relations"" because a non-party to a contract generally is not 
bound by the contract and thus can not breach the contract. See, e.g.,  Traffas v. Bridge Capital Investors II, 1993 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 12028, 1993 WL 339293 (D. Kan. 1993), at *3 HN5[
] (""It would be a novel holding for the court to rule that a breach of 
contract action can be maintained against a person who is not a party to the contract being sued upon …. A party to a contract 
cannot sue a person who is not a party to that contract for breach of contract.""); Credit Gen. Ins. Co. v. Midwest Indem. 
Corp.,916 F. Supp. 766, 772 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (finding ""ludicrous"" the defendants' contention that a non-party to a contract can 
breach that contract)."
1729,3," The court is mindful of Allen's contention that ""much of this may … be a matter of semantics."" Answering Brief at 12 n.6. Allen 
argues that, because the original AT&T contract was modified subsequent to TruePosition's initiation of the present suit, it 
suffered a complete loss of the original anticipated contract. Id. Apparently, Allen wishes the court to view this ""loss"" as a breach. 
However, HN6[
] a mutual modification of a contract certainly is not a breach. See, e.g.,  Anderson v. Golden, 569 F. Supp."
1729,122," , 140 (S.D. Ga. 1982) (distinguishing between breach and mutual modification). To the extent such a loss represents the loss 
of an economic expectation, the corresponding tort is interference with a prospective business opportunity. The court reiterates 
that Delaware law requires a breach to sustain the tort of interference with a contract. "
1731,4," Of course, as already stated, a violation of antitrust law underlies any sham exception to antitrust immunity. Although the 
defendant has not specifically pled a violation of the Sherman Act in Counterclaim V, the invocation of the sham litigation 
doctrine is sufficient to give notice of the basis of its claim. This is particularly true in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to 
dismiss, and in light of both the liberal pleading philosophy of the Federal Rules and the court's responsibility 'to examine the 
complaint to determine if the allegations provide for relief on any possible theory.' O ' Boyle v. Jiffy Lube Int'l, Inc., 866 F.2d 88, 
93 (3d Cir. 1989) (quoting C. WRIGHT & A. MILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, § 1357, at 601-02 (1969) 
(footnotes omitted))."
1731,5," Unlike the defendant, however, the court recognizes a distinction between the Noerr- Pennington doctrine, which shields 
petitioners from antitrust liability, and the sham litigation exception, which strips this immunity when the petition is meritless and 
anticompetitive in nature. See, e.g., Answering Brief at 15 ('… the Noerr-Pennington [i.e., ""sham litigation""] doctrine …'). "
1732,6," In this vein, the court stresses that the defendant, of course, will be tasked in the ensuing litigation with proving the elements of 
the sham litigation exception, namely, that the present patent infringement suit is objectively baseless and subjectively motivated 
by an intent to interfere with competition. See  Carroll Touch, 15 F.3d at 1583 (holding that sham litigation counterclaim could not 
survive summary judgment because defendant did not establish a genuine issue regarding whether the patent infringement 
action was baseless)."
1732,7," Because the court has found that Alien's pleadings satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b), it need not 
address the defendant's argument that Rule 9(b) may not apply to allegations of inequitable conduct. "

consumer, for employment purposes, in connection with the underwriting of insurance involving the consumer, in connection with

1750,2," The court will, in the main, refer only generally to dollar amounts and other quantitative matters, because much of this

1752,3," The transcript reflects (Tr. 271) that Mr. Skinner acknowledged on cross examination that the net operating loss for the 
gasoline operations for this period for the three stations exceeded $ 300,000. The court's review of the exhibits suggests that the 
correct amount is slightly less than $ 250,000. "
1756,4," It is perhaps also noteworthy at this point that, in Oklahoma Retail Grocers Ass'n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 605 F.2d 1155, Wal-
Mart stipulated that selling or offering to sell merchandise at less than cost ""would destroy or lessen competition"" Id. at 1157."
1756,5," It is arguable that the third and fourth items identified by Judge Russell as proscribed intents and purposes are actually 
legislative declarations of the effects of the first two proscribed intents and purposes. That possible variation in construction is 
immaterial on the facts of this case. "
1767,1," At the January 9, 2003 oral argument, the Plaintiff had an extensive opportunity to bring forth any facts which would buttress its 
federal antitrust claims. The Seventh Circuit has questioned whether a district court should ""'flesh out'"" an antitrust complaint, 
and has noted that ""it is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss."" Car 
Carriers v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1107 (7th Cir. 1984). However, the Court allowed SBS to rectify orally the facial deficiencies in its Amended Complaint because at this procedural 
stage, the Court must draw all reasonable inferences in the Plaintiff's favor and consider, in the interests of justice and efficiency, 
the Plaintiff's best arguments. Moreover, the Eleventh Circuit has even permitted district courts to consider claims first raised at a 
motion to dismiss hearing so long as the court also considers the factual allegations offered orally to support that claim. See  
Oxford Asset Mgmt., Ltd. v. Jaharis, 297 F.3d 1182, 1195(11th Cir. 2002); see also  Crowe v. Coleman, 113 F.3d 1536, 1541 n.4 
(11th Cir. 1997) (""when motions are orally argued [even when the pertinent hearing is for argument only and not one for the 
presentation of evidence], important things sometimes happen which impact on the factual record-for example, the judge while 
interrogating the lawyers obtains stipulations, concessions, and so on."")."
1767,2," For purposes of the motion to dismiss, CC did not contest the Plaintiff's definition of the relevant market: the top-ten Spanish-
language radio listening markets."
1767,3," HBC resulted from the 1997 merger of Clear Channel-owned Heftel Broadcasting Corporation and Tichenor Media Systems, 
Inc. CC owned 63% of Heftel Broadcasting before the merger, and after the merger, CC owned 26% of the new company, HBC."
1767,4," These ten largest markets in descending size order are: Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Houston, Chicago, San Francisco, 
San Antonio, Dallas, Brownsville and Phoenix. SBS competes with HBC in Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Chicago, and San

in terms of a product here is the sale of advertising by radio stations in each of those [ten] markets. We are not talking about the 
sale of radio stations . . ."")."
1768,7," To operate a radio station in the United States, a company must first obtain one of the limited number of licenses from the 
Federal Communications Commission (""FCC""). The FCC granted these licenses long ago, and they are infrequently sold. A 
radio company seeking to enter a market or expand its current market presence ordinarily must raise capital to acquire existing 
stations. Am. Compl. P 13."
1768,8," SBS alleges three particular actions. First, in December 1996, CC induced SBS's long-time sales representative, Katz Hispanic 
Media, to breach its contract with SBS and to become HBC's national sales representative. Second, in May 1999, SBS selected 
Lehman Brothers (""Lehman"") as sole lead manager and selected Merrill Lynch and BT Alex Brown (""BTAB"") and CIBC to be the 
co-managers of SBS's Initial Public Offering (""IPO""). Randall Mays (CC's Executive Vice-President and CFO) told Lehman's 
Managing Director that Raul Alarcon, Jr. (SBS's CEO) was a ""drug user and/or drug trafficker"" and thus not to proceed with the 
IPO. Am. Compl. P 21(b). The IPO proceeded nonetheless. Third, after BTAB was selected as a co-manager, CC called BTAB 
and stated that if BTAB participated in SBS's IPO, CC would take its business ($ 30 million in annual fees) elsewhere. Thus, 
BTAB was forced to withdraw from the underwriting syndicate."
1768,9," According to the Plaintiff, CC and HBC took steps to depress SBS's stock price by seeking to limit or eliminate coverage of 
SBS by leading securities analysts, specifically: (a) CC pressured a leading BTAB analyst not to cover SBS; (b) CC and HBC 
orchestrated the departure of a leading Lehman radio analyst who had prepared to cover SBS stock; and (c) HBC threatened to 
deny normal analyst access to another Lehman radio analyst if he continued to cover SBS. HBC also attempted to get SBS's shareholders to sell their shares and thus depress SBS's stock price. HBC leaked confidential 
acquisition discussions between SBS and HBC and made disparaging remarks about SBS's future to SBS's leading institutional 
investors such as Putnam Investment Management and Janus Capital, Inc. Am. Compl. P 22(c)(i)-(ii)."
1768,10," For example, SBS alleges that CC wrongfully appropriated a business opportunity SBS proposed to Golden West 
Broadcasters, operators of a Los Angeles radio station (KSCA-FM) in 1996. Am. Compl. P 23(a). CC purchased the option on 
KSCA-FM and then assigned it to HBC in Feb. of 1997. SBS alleges that CC or HBC interfered with SBS's acquisition of other 
radio stations by driving up the prices SBS paid for those stations. See Am. Compl. P 23(b)-(c). "
1769,11," SBS contends that HBC pressured Cardenas-Fernandez Associates (which is 50% owned by CC) to discontinue advertising 
on SBS stations. Am. Compl. at P 20."
1769,12," CC has veto power over any HBC plan to: sell or transfer substantially all of its assets; issue any shares of preferred stock; 
amend HBC's certificate of incorporation to adversely affect the shareholder rights of CC's class of stock; declare or pay any 
non-cash dividends or any non-cash distribution; and amend the articles of incorporation concerning HBC's capital stock. CC 
also appoints two of HBC's five-member Board of Directors. Am. Compl. P 26."

divisions; (3) group boycotts or concerted refusals to deal; and (4) tying arrangements.  Moecker, 144 F. Supp. 2d at 1302. 
SBS does not allege that the Defendants engaged in any of these activities."
1770,15," Other HN6[
] factors include: ""(1) whether the products and services have sufficiently distinctive uses and characteristics; (2) 
whether industry firms routinely monitor each other's actions and calculate and adjust their own prices on the basis of other 
firm's prices; (3) the extent to which consumers consider various categories of sellers as substitutes; and (4) whether a sizeable

1772,18," The U.S. Anchor court noted that the quantity of actual goods or services sold to consumers, as compared to revenues, is the 
appropriate determinant of market power; ""actual unit sales must be used whenever a price spread between various products 
would make the revenue figure an inaccurate estimator of units sales."" 7 F.3d at 999. At this procedural stage, the Plaintiff's 
measure of market share is assumed to be correct."
1772,19," HBC cites Caribbean Broadcasting System., Ltd. v. Cable & Wireless PLC, 331 U.S. App. D.C. 226, 148 F.3d 1080 (D.C. Cir. 
1998), as an example of where a court found that a plaintiff had given sufficient notice of injury to the relevant market to survive 
a motion to dismiss on its Sherman Act claim. There, however, the plaintiff alleged facts that the defendant's conduct injured the 
consumer in the relevant market and that U.S. customers in the relevant market suffered antitrust injury.  148 F.3d at 1086-87. "
1773,," Nowhere in the Amended Complaint or during oral argument does SBS argue facts, rather than present a conclusionary 
statement on this element. Moreover, SBS cites Full Draw Productions v. Easton Sports, Inc., 182 F.3d 745, 754 (10th Cir. 
1999), for the proposition that ""eliminating or diminishing a competitor's ability to vie for business is precisely the type of injury 
that the antitrust laws were intended to protect against."" Pl's Opp., at 15. However, in Full Draw, the Tenth Circuit noted that the 
plaintiff in that case had alleged that the elimination of the plaintiff as a competitor would ""directly and substantially reduce 
'output' of exhibitor space and directly and substantially reduce the ability of the consumers of such space to purchase exhibitor 
space."" 182 F.3d at 753-54. Plaintiff's complaint continued: ""because FDP [an archery show promoter] produced one of only two 
archery business trade shows in the United States, the purposeful and wrongful destruction of FDP's business by Defendants 
directly injured competition as well as injuring FDP."" Id. at 754 (emphasis added)."
1773,20," The Plaintiff has not alleged that there was an already existing agreement between two or more competitors in the relevant 
market. Since there is no legal basis for CC's liability under Section One, it follows that there can be no conspiracy liability 
against HBC. HBC cannot conspire with itself. "

1788,2, Rule 23(a) provides: 
1789,," One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class, and (5) the suit is not against this state for the recovery of a tax imposed by chapter 10-39, 10- 39A, 10-40, 10-41, 10-43, 10-44, 10-

1792,7," This type of analysis has also been adopted by the United States Supreme Court concerning the quantum of proof required for 
antitrust plaintiffs to recover. In Truett v. Chrysler Motors, 451 U.S. 557, 566-67, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 1929, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981), 
the Court reasoned: ""Any other rule would enable the wrongdoer to profit by [its] wrongdoing at the expenses of [its] victim. . . .Failure to apply it 
would mean that the more grievous the wrong done, the less likelihood there would be of a recovery."" Our willingness to accept a degree of uncertainty in these cases rests in part on the difficulty of ascertaining business damages . 
. . The vagaries of the marketplace usually deny us sure knowledge of what [the] plaintiff's situation would have been in the 
absence of the defendant's antitrust violation. But it does not ""'come with very good grace'"" for the wrongdoer to insist upon 
specific and certain proof of the injury which it has itself inflicted. (internal citations omitted). "
1793,8," The actual Daubert hearing with full evidentiary and legal arguments comes later in the judicial proceeding than the class 
certification issue. However, the two may still be connected as a Daubert hearing may convince the circuit court that its initial 
certification of the class can no longer be justified, thus resulting in a decertification of the class. Under NDRCiv P 23(b), a trial court generally considers issues about certification of a class action ""as soon as practicable after 
the commencement of a class action,"" and at that stage of the proceeding, issues regarding a joint or common interest may not 
be fully crystallized. A trial court may amend a certification order at any time before entry of judgment on the merits. NDRCivP 
23(b)(3). Under similar language in FedR CivP 23(c)(1), federal trial courts are free to decertify, subclassify, or modify a class 
certification previously granted. In Richardson v. Byrd, 709 F.2d 1016, 1019 (5thCir 1983), the court aptly explained a federal 
trial court ""must define, redefine, subclass, and decertify as appropriate in response to the progression of the case from 
assertion to facts."" Howe, 2003 ND 12, P29, 656 N.W.2d 285 (citing Rose v. United Equitable Ins. Co., 2002 ND 148, P18, 651 N.W.2d 683)."

has preformed complex economic analysis in antitrust cases for many years. Dr. Leffler has been qualified as an expert in 
proceedings before both federal and state courts. He has assisted the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department in 
their investigation of Microsoft's activities in the early 1980's and 1990's. "
1794,10," Dr. Hausman is the MacDonald Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His academic and 
research specialties are econometrics (the use of statistical models and techniques on economic data) and microeconomics (the 
study of consumer behavior and behavior of firms). He has substantial experience in computer programming. He has testified in 
nine antitrust trials in the United States and has given seminars to the American Bar Association, the Justice Department and 
the Federal Trade Commission on topics in anti-trust economics. "
1795,11," In so doing, we respectfully decline to adopt the standard adopted by the Court in Howe, that being: ""as long as the basis of 
the expert's opinion is not so blatantly flawed that, on its face, it would be inadmissible as a matter of law. . ."" 2003 ND 12, P27, 
656 N.W.2d 285. "
1796,12," The obvious exception to this would be where the evidence is undisputed such as occurred in Lick. In such instances all that is 
left for the circuit court to do is correctly apply the law to those undisputed facts."
1796,13," See Melnick v. Microsoft Corp., Nos. CV 99-709-752, 2001 WL 1012261 (Me SuperCt, Aug. 24, 2001) and A&M Supply Co. "
1801,*," This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 
Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. "
1807,1," The Guidelines contain six tests or ""screens"" by which Defendant evaluates dealer applicants. The six screens include: (a) the 
written application (50 points); (2) a math and reading comprehension test (50 points); (3) a Hogan Personal Inventory (50 
points); (4) an initial interview (50 points); (5) a credit review (50 points); and (6) a panel interview (100 points). If an applicant 
receives a score of at least 300 points, the applicant is approved unless he has failed the credit review. See Paper no. 79, App. 
A, Tab 2, Ex. B. Singh scored only 259.8 points and had the most difficulty in the initial and panel interviews, where he allegedly 
failed to demonstrate sufficient business acumen. "
1809,2," The Assignability Riders also provide that if a ""valid state statute specifically applicable to the transfer of branded motor fuel 
contracts or retail motor fuel store leases requires Exxon [Mobil] to consider giving consent"" to a proposed assignment, then the 
franchisee must give ExxonMobil a right of first refusal with regard to any proposed assignment. See Paper no. 79, App. A, Tab 
2, Ex. A. These riders, however, do not establish a contractual right for Plaintiff to assign its franchises. "
1810,3," Plaintiff also makes an unsubstantiated assertion that Defendant purposefully withheld the transfer of the service stations as 
part of a personal vendetta against Mangum, without any consideration of the qualifications of the proposed transferees. Plaintiff 
offers no evidence, other than Mangum's own deposition, to support this theory. The assertion in his deposition that Defendant's 
representative John Greco told Corporate Investment's broker Bryan Smyth who then told Mangum that Defendant was ""not 
going to approve any purchaser"" is multiple hearsay. HN10[
] Hearsay evidence does not provide sufficient support to defeat a 
summary judgment motion. See Evans v. Tech. Applications & Serv. Co., 80 F.3d 954, 962 (4th Cir. 1996). Moreover, it makes 
no sense that if Defendant had a vendetta against Mangum that it would withhold consent to transfer his franchises; if Defendant 
truly did not like Mangum, it would make more sense to approve the transfer and no longer have to do business with him. "
1811,4," Plaintiff concedes in its opposition that it has ""little physical documentation to support"" these claims, but suggests that its lack of 
evidence is due to Defendant's obstruction of the discovery process. See Paper no. 82 at 4, 8. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that 
Defendant refused to schedule the depositions of Exxon executives John Allred and Jim Carter, and inhibited Plaintiff's efforts to 
obtain documents from competitor Exxon stations. See id. Plaintiff's complaints about discovery at this time are inappropriate and insufficient. Plaintiff had more than enough time to 
conduct discovery on its claims; in fact, excluding the time the case was stayed due to Plaintiff's bankruptcy, Plaintiff had close 
to two years to take discovery. Moreover, during the years this case has been pending, Plaintiff never filed a motion to compel 
discovery. Plaintiff never moved to compel the depositions of Carter or Allred or responses to interrogatories or document 
requests. Plaintiff may not do so for the first time at summary judgment. Finally, even if it were appropriate at this stage to express discovery-related complaints, Plaintiff has not complied with 
FED.R.CIV.P. 56(f), which HN12[
] requires that a party alleging inadequate discovery must file an affidavit setting forth the 
specific discovery that needs to be taken and the reasons for the needed discovery. See Nguyen v. CNA Corp., 44 F.3d 234, 
242 (4th Cir. 1995). Plaintiff neither filed an affidavit nor described with specificity the materials he seeks to uncover. For all of 
these reasons, Plaintiff's complaints about discovery are irrelevant. "
1813,5," Because the court finds that Defendant's termination of the franchise was justified under § 2802(b)(2)(A), it is unnecessary to 
consider whether the termination was also justified under § 2802(b)(2)(C)."
1813,6," To the extent that Plaintiff has argued for the first time in its reply that Defendant somehow forced it to breach the Franchise 
Agreement by charging Plaintiff discriminatory prices and unreasonably disapproving assignment to Aziz and Singh, that 
argument is without merit. As discussed earlier in this opinion, Plaintiff has not provided evidence that Defendant charged 
discriminatory prices or that Defendant's disapproval was unreasonable. Moreover, the lengthy record in this case indicates that 
Mangum made the decision on his own for Plaintiff to breach the Franchise Agreement. See, e.g., Mangum Dep. at 217-18, 220-
22 (Paper no. 79, App. A, Tab 1). "
1826,1," Although Ahmed Hegazi did not actually place bids and purchase stamps, he is considered a ""Stamp Dealer"" here because he 
allegedly compiled the secret bids for the dealers prior to the auctions. See id. P 30."
1826,2," On January 28, 2002, John D. Apfelbaum and Earl P.L. Apfelbaum pled guilty to criminal charges of violating section 1 of the 
Sherman Act. See Am. Compl. P 34. On April 16, 2002, Davitt Felder and Davitt Felder, Inc. pled guilty to the same charges. 
See id. P 35."
1826,3," The Amended Complaint includes contradictory allegations that the Ring drove stamp prices above competitive levels and that 
it brought stamp prices below competitive levels. Compare Am. Compl. P 54 (""Any non Ring member dealer would be forced to 
bid at a level, where a profit on that lot was minimal or actually resulted in loss when resold."") with id. P 58 (Defendants' actions 
restrained trade by ""reducing the prices paid by Ring members to sellers below their competitive levels.""). For the purpose of the 
Rule 12(b)(6) motion, all inferences must be drawn in Stolow's favor. Accordingly, it is fair to infer that the Ring would bid both 
above and below competitive prices. "
1827,4, The Amended Complaint mistakenly labels two separate claims as Claim VI.
1827,5," The following Stamp Dealers have not appeared in this action: Anthony Feldman, Dana Okey, Stephen Osborne, Edward 
Younger, and Ahmed Hegazi. There has also been no appearance by the Auction House of Matthew Bennett Inc. "
1828,6, Stolow is seeking treble damages for the antitrust violations pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 15.
1828,7," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that HN7[
] ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 
U.S.C. § 1 (2002)."
1828,8," The Donnelly Act provides: HN8[
] ""Every contract, agreement, arrangement or combination whereby . . . competition or the 
free exercise of any activity in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service in this state is 
or may be restrained . . . is hereby declared to be against public policy, illegal and void."" N.Y. Gen. Bus. § 340 (2002). The Sherman Act and Donnelly Act claims are discussed as if one claim because HN9[
] ""New York's antitrust law . . . is 'modeled on the Sherman Act and should be construed in light of federal precedent.'"" Granite Partners, L.P. v. Bear Stearns & 
Co., 17 F. Supp. 2d 275, 298 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)(quoting Kramer v. Pollock-Krasner Found., 890 F. Supp. 250, 254 (S.D.N.Y. 
1995)). "
1830,9," 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a) provides: HN14[
] It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of 
racketeering activity . . . to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in 
acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of 
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce."
1830,10," Stolow adequately alleges that defendants constitute an enterprise. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4); United States v. Turkette, 452 
U.S. 576, 583, 69 L. Ed. 2d 246, 101 S. Ct. 2524 (1981); Feinberg v. Katz, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13771, No. 99 Civ. 45, 2002 
WL 1751135, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. July 26, 2002)(citing Procter & Gamble Co. v. Big Apple Indus. Bldgs., Inc., 879 F.2d 10, 18 (2d 
Cir. 1987)). He asserts that the Stamp Dealers were a group of individuals who formed the Ring for the purpose of bid-rigging. 
See Am. Compl. P 13. The Auction Houses are described as a group of corporations that worked together to assist the Ring in 
the bid-rigging scheme. See   id. P 14. Together these individuals and corporations were an association-in-fact operating as an 
enterprise engaged in the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud. See   id. P 80."
1830,11," Paragraph 11(b) of the RICO Statement asks Stolow to ""describe the use or investment of [the racketeering] income."" Stolow's 
response states ""Not known."" "
1831,12," Stolow also brings a claim under HN19[
] section 1962(d), which makes it unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any provision of section 1962. See Am. Compl. PP 78-85; RICO Statement P 14. Because Stolow has alleged that two or more 
persons agreed together to violate section 1962(c), the motion to dismiss the section 1962(d) claim is denied. "
1832,13," HN24[

1835,14," HN33[
] The statute of limitations is not tolled by State actions brought under the Clayton Act. Additionally, private actions brought under the Donnelly Act are not tolled by New York Attorney General proceedings. See N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 342-c 
(2002) (providing for the ""tolling of the period of limitations by proceedings of the United States"") (emphasis added). "
1836,15," Although Stolow's claims under sections 1962(a) and (b) have been dismissed for lack of standing, they are also dismissed as 
time-barred. "
1842,1," Plaintiff expressly disavows any challenge based on an agreement among members of defendant association, stating, ""Plaintiff 
does not claim that a group of Ranch residents conspired or agreed to restrain trade * * *. The antitrust violation here is the 
anticompetitive agreement between the County and the Ranch."" "
1843,2," Defendant also contends that plaintiff cannot prevail under ORS 646.725 because he claimed only damages personal to 
himself and did not claim ""antitrust damages,"" that is, damages to competition. The trial court did not reach that issue, nor do we. "
1854,1," If it did, then the Fourth Circuit's decision in Metrix Warehouse would provide a quick resolution to the antitrust injury 
requirement in this case. "
1856,2," The only circuit court decision arguably adopting this approach is Larry R. George Sales Co. v. Cool Attic Corp., 587 F.2d 266 
(5th Cir. 1979). In this court's opinion, however, the Cool Attic opinion leaves it unclear whether injury to a competitor or injury to 
competition is necessary for antitrust injury. The plaintiff in Cool Attic was an independent broker hired on commission by an attic 
fan manufacturer to arrange sales to attic fan distributors.  Id. at 269. Eventually, however, the purchasing agent for the attic fan 
distributor began dealing directly with the manufacturer and began demanding and receiving commissions from the 
manufacturer. Id. The independent broker brought a section 2(c) commercial bribery claim, but the court dismissed the claim for 
lack of antitrust injury. The independent broker's only injury, the court explained, arose from the breach (if any) of the brokerage 
agreement, not from the fact that the purchasing agent was now allegedly receiving illegal commissions from the manufacturer. 
Id. at 272. Thus, the independent broker had not suffered an antitrust injury. Certain aspects of the court's reasoning appear to support the defendant's position. For example, the court stated that ""recovery 
and damages under the antitrust law is available to those who have been directly injured by the lessening of competition."" Id. at 
271. At another point, however, the court stated that ""only if Plaintiff was in the same business and in competition with [either the 
manufacturer or the distributor] … would he have standing."" Id. at 272. This implies that injury to an individual competitor, 
regardless of injury to competition as a whole, would suffice for antitrust injury standing. The lack of clarity on this point is 
understandable, as the plaintiff in Cool Attic lacked standing under either theory of antitrust injury. Because of the ambiguities in 
Cool Attic regarding the precise contours of antitrust injury, this court does not rely on that case."
1856,3," Several other cases are sometimes cited by courts as holding that injury to competition need not be alleged to satisfy antitrust 
injury for a section 2(c) claim, but these cases do not address the antitrust injury standing requirement directly and thus are not 
reliable precedent on point. For example, in Fitch v. Kentucky-Tennessee Light & Power Co., 136 F.2d 12, 15 (6th Cir. 1943), 
the court affirmed a judgment for a section 2(c) plaintiff whose employee had been bribed, stating that ""the buyer is suing for 
damages … because, on account of the fraud, it was obliged to pay more for its coal than it would otherwise have paid in a 
competitive market."" Thus the court permitted a claim, very similar to the one alleged here, based on injury to a competitor 
without also requiring proof of injury to competition. However, it seems that the parties did not raise the issue of standing and 
antitrust injury, and the court never mentioned the antitrust injury requirement. The plaintiffs also cite 2660 Woodley Rd. Joint 
Venture v. ITT Sheraton Corp., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 439, No. Civ. A. 97-450, 2002 WL 53913 (D. Del. Jan 10, 2002), where 
the court held that the plaintiff had produced sufficient evidence to prove antitrust injury based on evidence that the hotel had 
suffered higher purchasing costs vis-a-vis its rivals as a result of the commercial bribery. 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 439, [WL] at *9. 
But the defendant in 2660 Woodley Road only argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the hotel had in fact paid 
higher prices than other hotels, not that such an injury, even if proven, would not constitute an antitrust injury. 2002 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 439, [WL] at *8. Therefore, the court did not address the issue of whether an antitrust injury must result from an injury to 
competition. See also  Calnetics Corp. v. Volkswagen of Am., 532 F.2d 674, 696 (9th Cir. 1976) (holding, without acknowledging 
the antitrust injury requirement, that ""if [Volkswagen Pacific] is able on remand to prove that [Calnetics] indeed committed acts of 
commercial bribery in violation of section 2(c), then the defendants ought to be allowed any damages proximately caused by that 
violation.""). "
1857,4," The plaintiffs quote at length from the court's decision in Philip Morris. This court has not discussed that case extensively, in 
part because the court does not fully endorse the reasoning in Philip Morris. For example, the court in Philip Morris declined to 
impose a ""competitive injury"" requirement on section 2(c) plaintiffs because, among other things, it concluded that commercial 
bribery always injures competition. See  Philip Morris, 67 F. Supp. 2d 134-36. As the defendant points out, this analysis 
confuses the elements of a section 2(c) claim -- which does not require proof of injury to competition -- with the antitrust injury 
standing requirement of section 4 of the Clayton Act -- which limits private party standing to those injured in the manner the 
antitrust laws were designed to prevent. Whether the defendant's conduct is inherently harmful to competition is a different 
question from whether the plaintiff was injured as a result of the competition-reducing aspect of that behavior. See  Atlantic 
Richfield, 495 U.S. at 335 (even for per se Sherman Act claim, in which injury to competition is presumed, the plaintiff must still 
prove competitive injury to have standing under section 4). This is not to say that this court disagrees with the Philip Morris court 
at all points in the analysis. The court simply wishes to emphasize, particularly in light of the plaintiffs' heavy reliance on Philip 
Morris, that it does not fully adopt the reasoning of Philip Morris (or any other decision cited), except to the extent that the court 
does so expressly in this opinion."
1857,5," Indeed, as indicated in footnotes 2 and 3, no circuit court has directly addressed this issue. "
1858,6," Stephen Jay simply holds the converse -- that alleged commercial bribery that does not involve corruption of the agency 
relationship does not violate section 2(c)."
1858,7," Although for that matter, it is not clear whether even this aspect of section 2(c) fits within the broader goals of the antitrust laws. 
Even as to its dummy brokerage/ price discrimination function, section 2(c), like the Robinson-Patman Act as a whole, has been 
roundly criticized for being out of step with, and in some cases in direct conflict with, the general pro-competition aims of the 
antitrust laws. See Hovenkamp P 2301 (explaining that price discrimination by a supplier among various dealers is not, absent 
market power, harmful to competition); id. 2362, at 234 (results under section 2(c) ""can be quite at odds with general antitrust 
goals""). "
1859,8," This second injury-the loss of business vis-a-vis competitors-sounds something like a ""competitive injury."" Of course, this court 
has concluded that competitive injury need not be plead as part of the antitrust injury requirement in a section 2(c) claim. 
Accordingly, the court need not, and does not, evaluate whether this second allegation would satisfy that requirement. Some 
courts imposing a competitive injury standing requirement in section 2(c) claims have held that similar allegations are sufficient; 
others have held that such allegations are insufficient. Compare Hansel ' N Gretel Brand, Inc., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17615, 
1997 WL 543088, at * 10 (allegations that the defendant ""sold its products to HNG's competitors at a lower price than it charged 
to HNG, or charged HNG more than HNG's competitors were paying for the same kind of merchandise,"" were sufficient to state 
antitrust injury); with  Fed. Paper Bd. Co., 693 F. Supp. at 1388 (even though complaint alleged that the plaintiff had paid above-
market rates for wastepaper because its purchasing agent had taken bribes from certain suppliers, ""without allegations of 
additional facts that demonstrate how [other] suppliers were precluded from taking competitive actions in order to secure sales 
with Federal, the amended complaint does not sufficiently allege anticompetitive effect"")."
1859,9," Marriott also argues that the plaintiffs fail to adequately allege antitrust injury because they do not allege facts sufficient to 
define the relevant market in which competition was impaired. Because the court has concluded that an injury flowing from a 
reduction in competition need not be alleged to satisfy the antitrust injury requirement in the context of section 2(c), the plaintiffs 
of course need not define the relevant market in which competition has been reduced. "
1860,10," Section 47-11A-3 is actually a criminal statute that makes this conduct a misdemeanor. The plaintiffs may pursue a private 
cause of action based on this statute because HN15[
] West Virginia law creates a private right of action for unfair trade practices. See W. Va. Code § 47-11A-9."
1860,11," Marriott cites Marco Marine for the contrary proposition that UPAs only cover injury to a competitor of the party granting the 
rebate, not the party receiving the rebate. But Marco Marine holds to the contrary. The court specifically rejected the defendant's 
contention that the Act ""does not apply to buyers who receive secret allowances of unearned discounts, but only to the sellers 
who provide them."" Marco Marine 16 Cal. App. 4th at 214. Instead, the court held that ""both sellers and buyers should generally 
be held liable in the event of such discounts."" Marco Marine 16 Cal. App. 4th at 214-15. Marriott also cites Burge v. Pulaski 
County Special Sch. Dist., 272 Ark. 67, 612 S.W.2d 108 (Ark. 1981), for support of its position. It is true that the Burge court held 
that ""the Act provides a remedy only in favor of one seller against another seller, not in favor of a seller against a buyer or vice 
versa."" Burge 612 S.W.2d at 110. But this does not mean that the Act covers sellers but not buyers, only that sellers are only 
covered vis-a-vis other sellers. (The court does not address whether buyers are covered vis-a-vis other buyers.) Moreover, the 
Burge court did not provide much explanation for its limitation of the right to recovery under the Acts, and it also justified 
dismissing the case on the alternative ground that the payments were not secret. Id. To the extent that Burge does stand for the 
plaintiffs' proposition that the Acts cover only injuries to competitors of the party granting the rebate, not the party receiving the 
rebate, this court declines to follow Burge. "
1862,12," In addition to this general argument that the contract explicitly permits the alleged wrongful conduct, Avendra presents several 
arguments that depend necessarily on the court accepting this conclusion. For example, Avendra argues that the claim for aiding 
and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty must be dismissed because there can be no breach of fiduciary duty in the first place 
when the contract explicitly permits the conduct alleged. As the court has rejected the premise upon which all of these 
arguments rely, they are likewise without merit and do not warrant further discussion. "
1863,13," In its memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss, Avendra initially states that the plaintiffs must comply with Rule 9(b) in 
their claims for ""fraud, violations of the West Virginia Unfair Practices Act, and breaches of fiduciary duties …."" (Avendra Memo. 
at 4.) At the conclusion of this argument, however, Avendra states that ""because all of the claims against Avendra allege 
intentional, fraudulent conduct, Plaintiff's failure to satisfy Rule 9(b) mandates reversal."" 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 439, [WL] at 6. It 
is thus unclear which counts Avendra believes must satisfy Rule 9(b). To the extent that Avendra implies that all of the claims 
must do so, it is incorrect. For example, a claim for commercial bribery under section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman contains no 
fraud element and therefore need not be plead with particularity. The court will limit its discussion of Rule 9(b) to the three counts 
specifically identified by Avendra: fraud, WVUPA violations, and breach of fiduciary duty. "
1864,14," HN21[
] When, as here, the plaintiff relies on a contract in its complaint, and indeed includes a copy of that contract as an 
attachment to the complaint, ""it [is] proper for the district court to consider if in ruling on [a] motion to dismiss."" Darcangelo v. 
Verizon Comms., Inc., 292 F.3d 181, 195 (4th Cir. 2002)."
1864,15," Indeed, Avendra was not created until years after the Agreement was signed. "
1871,1," Although defendant Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry, Ltd. and defendant Chisso Corporation joined in the pending motion (Docs. 
113 & 114), on January 8, 2003, the court dismissed these defendants from the lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction. "
1873,2," See generally Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540, (1982) (examining the 
concept of ""standing"" in the antitrust context); Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535 n.31, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983) (noting ""the focus of the doctrine of 'antitrust 
standing' is somewhat different from that of standing as a constitutional doctrine)."
1873,3," Although the Smith court cites the treble damages provision as § 50-801, an examination of the historical statutes of Kansas 
shows that § 50-801 is a predecessor of § 50-161. "
1874,4," The Williams action refers to Williams Foods, Inc. v. Eastman Chemical Co., Case No. 99C 16680, brought on behalf of 
Williams Foods, Inc. and similar individuals and entities that indirectly purchased sorbates in the State of Kansas from certain 
named defendants from January 1, 1979, through December 31, 1996. The state court approved a settlement in Williams on 
July 25, 2001."
1874,5," The court recognizes that the Kansas District Court in Johnson County, Kansas gave final approval to the Williams settlement 
and noted that ""based on the difficulty in calculating class-wide damages for end consumers and business entities who 
purchased products containing sorbates solely for resale (such as grocery stores and restaurants),"" and ""considering the 
hundreds of grocery stores who have not chosen to opt-out or file objections"" to this amount, and based on the facts presented 
to support the award, that the cy pres award of $ 50,000 agreed to by the parties was reasonable. However, this court must base 
its decision on the record before it on this Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. "
1876,6," At the time McCue was decided, a predecessor provision of § 60-512 was in effect. The statutory provision referenced in 
McCue--Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-306--is identical in relevant part to Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-512. HN17[
] Similar to § 60-512, § 60-"
1876,306," set a three-year limitations period for ""an action upon a liability created by statute, other than a forfeiture or penalty."" See 
Notes to Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-512(2); Bd. of Comm'rs of Montgomery County v. McKittrick, 141 Kan. 283, 285-86, 40 P.2d 352, 
354 (Kan. 1935) (citing Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-306). "
