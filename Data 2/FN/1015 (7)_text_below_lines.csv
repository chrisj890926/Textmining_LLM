28,2," In Associated General, the Court found that two factors, the causal connection between the plaintiff's alleged injuries and the

29,4," In Fallis, the court held that a sales representative lacked standing to maintain an antitrust action against his former employer 
based on a claim that he was discharged because he refused to participate in a vertical price fixing scheme. The court stated 
that although the representative's alleged role as a ""fulcrum"" for employer's pressure on discounters weighed in favor of 
standing, this factor was outweighed by indirectness of his injury, existence of more direct victims, and resulting danger of 
double recovery or complex apportionment of damages. Fallis, 866 F.2d at 212. "

41,6," The ""overview"" portion of this memorandum is drawn largely from Capital Imaging, P.C. v. Mohawk Valley Medical Assoc., 996

690 (1977). In Brunswick, the Court noted the type of damage required to state a claim under the Sherman Act: [Antitrust] HN10[
] plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to 
prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect 
either of the violation or of the anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation. Brunswick Corp., 429 U.S. at 489."
42,8," An exception to this rule, not directly relevant here, occurs when the conspirators fix prices at ""predatory"" levels. A predatory 
price (price below cost) is designed to eliminate competition and ensure later monopoly profits. "
43,9," Monopsony, the mirror image of monopoly, refers to ""market power . . . on the buying side of the market."" AREEDA ET AL., 
ANTITRUST LAW, P 574."
43,10," Areeda and Turner summarize the effect on prices as follows: The monopsony buyer, unlike the competitive buyer, can reduce the purchase price by scaling back its purchases. Because 
the monopsonist ordinarily reduces its buying price by purchasing less, it sells less downstream. This reduction in its own 
output will, if it has market power on the selling side, mean higher prices for customers. Thus, lower buying prices upstream 
may translate into higher selling prices downstream. AREEDA ET AL., ANTITRUST LAW, P 574 (footnotes omitted)."
43,11," The defendants' memorandum in support reads: . . . the sole basis for Addamax's price-fixing claim is that OSF itself allegedly sought to purchase security software at a 
reduced price. However, a joint venture such as OSF is not a ""walking conspiracy,"" and as a matter of law, neither OSF's 
simple existence nor its unilateral actions with respect to price is sufficient to establish a conspiracy among OSF and the 
Sponsors. Defendants' Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, p.12. "
44,12," The Supreme Court in Timken made explicit reference to joint ventures in the antitrust context: Nor do we find any support in reason or authority for the proposition that agreements between legally separate persons and 
companies to suppress competition among themselves and others can be justified by labeling the project a ""joint venture."" 
Perhaps every agreement and combination to restrain trade could be so labeled. Id. at 598 (citations omitted)."
44,13," The scope of the Massachusetts Antitrust Act, 93 M.G.L. ch. 93 § 4, is statutorily tied to its federal law analog, § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. See M.G.L. ch. 93 § 1; Winter Hill Frozen Foods and Services, Inc. v. Haagen-Dazs Co., 691 F. Supp. 539 
(D.Mass. 1988). Discussion of Addamax's state law claim is accordingly ""subsumed"" into the discussion of the applicable federal 
statutes. Id., at 543 n.5. "
45,14," A second reason for the more lenient treatment given joint purchasing agreements is a result of the relationship between the 
likely plaintiff and the likely defendant: the company alleging the violation is not a direct competitor of the companies forming the 
buying cartel."
45,15," There is one relevant exception to the ""rule of reason"" standard for buyer's cartels. A joint buying agreement will be illegal per 
se if ""the buyer [is] . . . a 'sham' organization seeking only to combine otherwise independent buyers in order to suppress their 
otherwise competitive instinct to bid up price."" Kartell v. Blue Shield of Massachusetts, 749 F.2d 922, 925 (1st Cir. 1992). Again, 
however, Addamax has produced no evidence that OSF was formed to in order to suppress the sponsors' ""competitive instinct 
to bid up price."" Addamax's buyer's cartel claims do not warrant per se scrutiny. "
46,16," The fact that OSF's alleged anticompetitive purpose was directed at Sun and AT&T, not Addamax, is not relevant to the 
analysis. It is sufficient that the harm to Addamax ""flowed from"" OSF's anticompetitive purpose. See part IV.A., supra."
46,17," For reasons discussed earlier in this memorandum, a seller to a collusive monopsony must establish that the conspiring 
defendants exercised market power on two relevant markets: the market for the seller's inputs and the market for the buyers' 
output. The search for relevant markets here is complicated by several features unique to the computer industry. The market for 
computer systems is unlike the market for ""widgets"" that typically frames antitrust analysis. The technology at issue, by its very 
nature, is not sold in units. Sales agreements may be for licenses, royalties, or combinations of the two, and one company's 
choice of technology may have important repercussions on the industry as a whole. In addition, as noted earlier, systems are 
often assembled from existing technology, further complicating the search for the ""relevant market"" in antitrust terms."
46,18," The defendants' objection to Addamax's definition of the relevant markets is limited to a single footnote. Defendants' 
Memorandum in Support, 24 n.18. Without passing on the validity of Addamax's market definitions, the court limits its inquiry to 
the arguments fully developed in this motion for summary judgment. "
47,19," Several documents suggest that OSF's original sponsors recruited IBM and other computer companies in a conscious effort to 
increase OSF's leverage on the market. See Plaintiff's Appendix I, Volume II, Tab 61 at HP53240; Id. at Tab 72, F052024; Id., 
Volume I, Tab 37 at HP72176. This evidence, though not entirely unambiguous, supports the inference that the sponsors 
themselves believed that OSF could influence the market. These documents, particularly when viewed in the light most 
favorable to the nonmoving party, clearly raise genuine issues of fact with respect to the defendants' collective monopsony 
power. "
48,20," A general lack of activity suggests that the true purpose in joining forces is not to integrate resources, but rather to exploit its 
market power. Timken, 341 U.S. at 597-98. "
49,21," The defendants submit that ""the only indicia of Sponsorship is one seat on the Board of Directors."" Defendants' Memorandum 
in Support, 30 & n.21. In fact, however, the Sponsors may have obtained considerably more in exchange for their initial cash 
contributions. The Formation and Funding Agreement, Plaintiff's Appendix I, Vol. I, Tab 48, and OSF's by-laws, plaintiff's 
Appendix III, Tab. 2, suggest that the Sponsors retain rights apart from and beyond their seat upon the board of directors. The 
Sponsors may, for example, alter, amend or repeal the by-laws without the consent of the board."
49,22," Having found that the defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on all state antitrust claims, the court finds it 
unnecessary to consider the defendant's motion with respect to Addamax's M.G.L. ch. 93A, § 11 claim."
49,23," It is important to note, with respect to this element of Addamax's claim, that a plaintiff need not establish that the defendants 
actions were motivated by malice towards the plaintiff. It is sufficient that Addamax show that (1) the defendants were aware of 
Addamax's business relations, and (2) that their illegal conduct interfered with these relations. United Truck Leasing, 406 Mass. 
811, 551 N.E.2d 20, 23 (Mass. 1990). "
50,24," The timing of Addamax's several contractual relations may of course be relevant to the issue of whether or not the defendants 
interfered with Addamax's business relations. For the purposes of this motion, however, it is sufficient to note that the timing of 
the contracts, in and of itself, does not preclude Addamax's claim. "

complaint also set out facts showing that another airplane engineer who worked for Cessna through an agency was covered by 
the alleged agreement. See Aplt. App. at 4. "
68,2," The facts alleged here are distinguishable from the circumstances present in cases such as Sharp v. United Airlines, Inc., 967 
F.2d 404 (10th Cir. 1992). In Sharp, former employees of Frontier Airlines who lost their jobs when Frontier ceased operations 
brought suit against United Airlines seeking antitrust damages for their claim that they were injured by the anticompetitive 
practices United allegedly used to drive Frontier out of business. In denying standing, we held that HN5[
] ""employees simply 
cannot establish an antitrust injury when they lose their employment as a result of some allegedly anticompetitive activity 
directed at or involving their employer."" Id. at 408 (emphasis added). As we noted in Sharp, see id. at 408 n.4, that case is to be 
distinguished from a case like the one before us in which the anticompetitive practices are directed toward the employees 
themselves. "
74,1, Traffic reports represented only a small percentage of the total programming offered by the subscribing stations. 
75,2," In 1989, advertisers paid approximately $ 25- $ 40 per spot and were rotated among stations and time slots. Traffic Scan 
charged considerably less when it first entered the business and had less attractive stations to offer its advertising clients."
75,3," At some point before its acquisition by Traffic Camera, Traffic Scan also entered the traffic reporting business in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana, Mobile, Alabama, Palm Beach, Florida, and Miami, Florida."
75,4," Pollet was employed as an engineer with a local radio station. He developed the technology used by Traffic Camera to gather 
traffic information. His wife was both the traffic reporter and salesperson. Winston described the two as ""unsophisticated"" and 
""understaffed."" "
76,5, Winston described the deal as hurried because Traffic Camera's owners had already received several offers.
76,6," Plaintiff claims that Traffic Camera not only matched Traffic Scan's car incentive program but surpassed it by offering luxury 
automobiles."
76,7," In light of plaintiff's theory that the relevant product market is traffic reports, the relevance of its claims of below-cost advertising 
rates is not clear. Moreover, while Traffic Scan's evidence suggests that Traffic Camera charged a wide range of prices to 
advertisers, the circumstances surrounding the cited transactions were not discussed. Low advertising prices, without more, do 
not raise an inference of anticompetitive conduct. Indeed, representatives of both companies indicated that their spot rates were 
much lower when they had less attractive stations to offer advertisers. Moreover, John Marshall, former CEO of Traffic Scan, 
testified that market conditions often forced Traffic Scan to charge a wide variety of prices for advertising time. Marshall testified 
that Traffic Scan had sold advertising time for as little as $ 1. When asked why the price had been so low, Marshall stated 
""Because I couldn't get two."" Since Traffic Camera operated under the same market conditions as Traffic Scan, plaintiff's 
evidence is as consistent with the theory that the parties competed with a host of other suppliers of radio advertising time in a 
highly competitive market as it is with the theory that Traffic Camera was engaged in anticompetitive conduct."
76,8," This matter is in dispute between the parties. Defendants, however, have conceded the point for purposes of its motion. "
77,9," Given Marshall's concession that Traffic Camera's antitrust activities had not commenced by the summer of 1990, Traffic 
Camera apparently contends that Traffic Camera brought about its demise in 3 to 6 months."
77,10," Although plaintiff claims that the asset purchase agreement and conditional settlement represented the culmination of Traffic 
Camera's predatory pricing scheme, this litigation did not follow immediately after the closing on the deal. Rather, plaintiff began 
complaining about defendants' conduct only after Traffic Camera notified Traffic Scan in February 1992 that it intended to 
exercise its right to reduce the purchase price due to a radio station's cancellation of its contract with Traffic Camera. This suit 
was commenced several months later."
77,11," Traffic Camera apparently has accounts with 36 of approximately 40 radio stations in the New Orleans area. There has been 
at least one entry into the traffic reporting business by one of Traffic Camera's former officers, John Mikovich, doing business as 
Traffic Updates. Mikovich entered the business at the invitation of WWL, a powerful radio station, when its contract with Traffic 
Camera expired. Traffic Camera bought out Mikovich's contract for $ 200,000."
77,12," Plaintiff's complaint also mentions claims against defendants for a conspiracy to monopolize and for monopolization. 
Monopolization, an attempt to monopolize, and a conspiracy to monopolize are three separate legal claims under Section 2 of 
the Sherman Act. Plaintiff could therefore have chosen to assert all three claims. However, in response to defendants' motion for "
78,," summary judgment, plaintiff characterized its claim under Section 2 as an attempt to monopolize claim among affiliated 
companies. See Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition, Rec. Doc. no. 116, at pp. 17, 28-29, 31. Plaintiff apparently chose to 
disavow the alternative theories of liability available under Section 2 either to avoid the Copperweld issues raised by the 
defendants with respect to plaintiff's Section 1 claim or in the mistaken belief that Section 2 ""has nothing to do with conspiracy or 
concerted action."" Id. at 31. Since plaintiff has expressly chosen to pursue only an attempt to monopolize claim, the Court will 
treat this as an attempt to monopolize case. "
80,13," If anything, the evidence in the record suggests that Traffic Camera had a cost advantage in producing traffic reports in that its 
camera technology was much cheaper than the airplanes used by Metroscan. Marc Winston Deposition at 47-48."
80,14," As noted earlier, plaintiff contends that Traffic Camera priced its advertising below its costs. This does not assist plaintiff's 
predatory pricing claim, however, because plaintiff claims that the relevant product was the provision of traffic reports to 
broadcasting media, not advertising to advertisers. Thus, the plaintiff must establish that Traffic Camera priced the traffic reports 
to the radio stations below its average variable cost, which it has failed to do. Moreover, the testimony of principals from both 
Traffic Camera and Traffic Scan indicated that Traffic Camera sold advertising in competition with the radio stations themselves, 
which is a far broader market than plaintiff claims. Obviously, if all 40 radio stations selling advertising time in the New Orleans 
area are included in the relevant market, plaintiff's monopolization theory could never be sustained. "
81,15," Of these documents, the only one made part of the record is Marc Winston's deposition. An expert report's conclusions are 
only probative if based on evidence in the record. The Court could thus disregard plaintiff's expert report on this basis alone. "
82,16," Although not discussing the product market, plaintiff's expert states elsewhere in his report that ""there is likely some significant 
product uniqueness"" generated by the multiple-station packaging offered to advertisers by traffic reporting services. Plaintiff's 
expert does not cite any evidence in support of this statement. Moreover, plaintiff claims that the relevant product is traffic 
reporting, not advertising, and it has not produced any evidence to suggest that this product is unique. "
83,17," HN13[
] Barriers to entry are defined as either ""additional long-run costs that were not incurred by incumbent firms, but must 
be incurred by new entrants,"" or ""factors in the market that deter entry while permitting incumbent firms to earn monopoly 
returns."" ARREDA & HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW P 409, at 509-10 (1992 Supp)."
83,18," At oral argument, plaintiff's counsel stated that companies were always coming in and going out of the traffic reporting 
business. In a supplemental brief to the Court, plaintiff's counsel retreats from this statement by arguing that there has been only 
one entry into the market since 1990. He argues that Traffic Camera immediately bought out that entry for $ 200,000 so as to be 
able to continue to recoup its losses. However, simply because Traffic Camera acquired the assets of one new entrant does not 
mean that Traffic Camera could continue to do this indefinitely. Rather, Traffic Camera simply would not be able to afford to buy 
out new entries continually. To illustrate, plaintiff stated at oral argument that the profit margin for the dominant firm in the traffic 
reporting business was $ 60,000 - $ 80,000 annually. If we assume Traffic Camera's range of profitability is something in the 
same order of magnitude (no evidence of its profits or losses before or after its acquisition of plaintiff having been submitted), it 
would take nearly six years to make up the purchase price of the new entrant, not to mention the losses it allegedly sustained by 
driving Traffic Scan out of business. Nor does plaintiff's theory account for any future losses that would be incurred in order to 
eliminate other new entrants. Cf. Advo, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191 (""High prices will attract a stream of competitors who will eventually 
sap the predator's bank account.""). "
93,1," All parties agree that under Massachusetts law the town had the authority to enact the by-law. See M.G.L. c. 111, §§ 31A and 
31B (granting cities and towns in the Commonwealth wide authority to regulate the removal and transportation of solid waste 
that originates in their jurisdiction). Franklin's right to enact by-laws in this area generally is therefore not at issue. "
96,2, Those local purposes were:
96,1, . maximization of the rate of recycling and recovery;

96,3, . prevention of the illegal disposal of solid waste;

such waste was accidently commingled with solid waste shipped to out of state facilities;"
96,5, . facilitation of planning for solid waste transportation; and
96,6," . facilitation of overall long term planning. Id. at 783-85. The Town Defendants have not argued that these -- or any -- local purposes motivated its decision to enact the by-
law, and have not pointed to any specific state policy served thereby. "

129,5," The named defendants were: Lehman Brothers, an investment firm; Great Western Financial and Financial Corporation of 
America, financial holding companies owned by Lehman Brothers; Great Western Savings and Loan Association; Security Title 
Insurance Company; American Title Company; Summit Title Company; and Sherwood Escrow Company. Many of these 
defendants were not engaged in the insurance industry and thus did not hold certificates and/or licenses which the 
commissioner could revoke. The commissioner does have the power to seek an injunction against anyone who is violating or 
about to violate any provisions of the Insurance Code or regulations issued thereunder. (§ 12928.6.) Plaintiffs competed directly with Summit Title Company and American Title Company for the business of title insurance 
companies. "
130,6," Possibly the most telling rebuttal to defendants' claim that Chicago Title held that antitrust and unfair competition statutes other 
than the UIPA did not apply to the insurance industry is found by negative implication in the dissent of Justice Mosk. (Chicago 
Title, supra, 69 Cal. 2d 305, 328 (dis. opn. of Mosk, J.).) In that dissent, Justice Mosk disagreed with the court's conclusion that 
the complaint did not state a cause of action under the Cartwright Act. The reasoning is directed exclusively to the allegations 
necessary to plead such a cause of action. Had the court held that the Cartwright Act was superseded by the UIPA, as 
defendants argue, the absence from the dissent of any reference to or acknowledgment of that holding would be quite 
remarkable. Moreover, had the majority held that the UIPA precluded any Cartwright Act claim, the opinion would certainly have responded 
to the dissent by observing that in light of the holding on the effect of the UIPA, the adequacy of the allegations pleading those 
causes of action was irrelevant. "
132,7," Records of the Insurance Commissioner of which the Court of Appeal took judicial notice reflect that in a memorandum to the 
Insurance Commissioner at the time Assembly Bill No. 1530 was introduced, his chief assistant advised that the acts proscribed 
by the bill were covered by other statutes, and in particular the acts of boycott, threat, or intimidation were proscribed by the 
Cartwright Act. The chief assistant expressed concern that notwithstanding other sections of the UIPA, it could be construed to 
preclude use of the sanctions available under existing law. That concern led to the inclusion of section 790.09 in the proposed 
legislation."
132,8," The Insurance Commissioner, whose office proposed inclusion of section 790.09 in the UIPA to ensure that existing remedies 
would be preserved, continues to take the position that the Legislature did not intend, by adoption of the UIPA, to supersede the 
Cartwright Act or any other state laws. Appearing as amicus curiae in support of plaintiff, the commissioner expresses his belief 
that regulatory enforcement by his office is complementary to the Cartwright Act and the UCA. Both the commissioner and the 
California District Attorneys Association, which also appears as amicus curiae, express the belief that the public interest is 
served by vigorous enforcement of all three statutes. The California District Attorneys Association asserts that actions under the 
UCA have become the principal law enforcement instrument of prosecutors in the areas of consumer protection and unfair 
competition, with more than 200 such actions being prosecuted annually. The UCA is also the basis for prosecutions brought to 
supplement provisions of the Health and Safety Code and the Labor Code to remedy public health and sanitation and public 
safety violations, and its use to supplement other provisions of law has been upheld repeatedly. (See, e.g., People v. McKale 
(1979) 25 Cal. 3d 626, 632 [159 Cal. Rptr. 811, 602 P.2d 731]; People v. Los Angeles Palm, Inc. (1981) 121 Cal. App. 3d 25, 33

A.L.R.4th 661].)"
132,9," The request of plaintiff that this court take judicial notice of this and other materials related to the adoption of the UIPA, much of 
which was considered by the Court of Appeal, is granted. HN5[
] Pursuant to Evidence Code section 459, a reviewing court "
133,," must take judicial notice of any matter that was properly noticed by the trial court or of which the trial court was required to take

133,10," Illinois, New Jersey, and Washington have enacted express exemptions from state antitrust law for those activities of insurers 
which are regulated by their insurance commissioners and/or authorized by statute. (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 60-5 (1969); N.J. 
Stat. Ann. § 56:9-5, subd. (b)(4); Wash. Rev. Code § 19.86.170; see B & L Pharmacy, Inc. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (1970) 46

whom such extension, renewal or other act is to be granted or performed negotiate any insurance or renewal thereof covering 
such property through a particular insurance agent or broker."""
134,12," Contrary to defendants' assertion, Maler v. Superior Court, supra, 220 Cal. App. 3d 1592, did not uphold the sustaining of a 
demurrer to a UCA cause of action. The trial court had overruled that demurrer ( id. at p. 1596) and the only issue before the 
Maler court was whether the court erred in sustaining a demurrer to a cause of action for violation of section 1861.03, the section 
added by Proposition 103 which states that the insurance industry is subject to antitrust and unfair business practices laws.  (220 
Cal. App. 3d at p. 1595.) "
135,13," Defendants appear to argue both that the insurance industry is exempt from antitrust regulation generally and that no private 
civil remedy for such conduct exists. "
136,14," Section 1851 excludes eight categories of insurance from the partial antitrust exemption conferred by the McBride-Grunsky 
Act. Life insurance is among the excluded lines. The others are: reinsurance, marine, title, disability, workers' compensation, 
mortgage, and county mutual fire insurance."
136,15," Section 1861.13: ""This article shall apply to all insurance on risks or on operations in this state, except those listed in Section 
1851."" Section 1851, like section 1861.13, is part of chapter 9 of division 1 of the Insurance Code, a chapter directed to rates and 
rating. "
137,16," Business and Professions Code section 17204, a part of the UCA, provides that an action for an injunction against unfair 
competition may be prosecuted by, among others, ""any person acting for the interests of itself, its members or the general 
public."" "
138,17," HN9[

139,1," ""FOR EXAMPLE: 'We are persuaded . . . that appellants' vague and conclusionary pleadings fail to allege facts which might 
reasonably be construed to reveal a wrongful combination.' ( Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western Financial Corp., supra, 69 
Cal. 2d at p. 315.) "" '[T]he factual allegations, as illustrated, fail in each instance to support the charge. Just as the earlier counts state facts 
insufficient to establish proscribed conduct on the parts of the alleged actors and thus cannot reach their purported conspirators, 
so the final counts charging antitrust infringements fall for similar reasons.' (69 Cal. 2d at p. 323, brackets original.) "" 'The allegation of boycott cannot be supported in this instance because everyone has the unrestricted right to select customers 
and sources of supply.' (69 Cal.[2]d at p. 324.)"""

146,*," The Honorable Douglas W. Hillman, United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan, sitting by designation."
146,1," The Banks are Bank of Bartlett, Boatmen's Bank of Tennessee, First American National Bank, First Tennessee Bank, N.A., 
Leader Federal Bank for Savings, National Bank of Commerce, NationsBank, Tri-State Bank of Memphis and Union Planters 
National Bank."
146,2," For purposes of brevity, we will refer to both of these types of fees as ""NSF"" throughout the opinion. "
147,3," The Banks argued to the District Court that on a statewide level, NSF fees varied by as much as 44%, varied by as much as 
26.67% on a citywide level, and varied within individual banks' branches by as much as 90%. The NSF fees varied from $ 10.00 
to $ 20.00 per transaction. "
148,4," For instance, one bank's affidavit stated that ""when NSF, DRI and other overdrafts are honored, unsecured and often unsound 
extensions of credit result which may go uncollected. In addition, check kiting and other fraudulent schemes that result in losses 
to banking institutions can arise out of presentation of overdraft items. Setting NSF charges at their current levels . . . is designed 
to discourage this undesirable conduct."" Another affidavit stated that ""excessive overdrafts are detrimental to the banking system 
because at some level they will cause a loss of confidence in checks as a medium of payment . . . . First American does not 
want customers who continually bounce checks. First American's procedures require that the account of a customer who 
bounces an excessive amount of checks in a twelve month period be closed."" Another bank's affidavit contained the statement 
""to contend that [NSF charges are] an area of business that is encouraged by NationsBank is pure folly. The ideal customer is 
one who keeps large balances in the account, makes deposits, writes few checks and is never overdrawn."""
148,5," For instance, public dissemination of prices can violate the Sherman Act where the publication serves little purpose other than 
facilitating collusion, Petroleum Products, 906 F.2d at 448, or where prices are published in advance by a price leader to 
communicate its intention and to gauge reactions of competitors. Id. at 446. The fees are published here together with other 
charges to advise customers of the charges they must pay. "
149,6," The Banks argue that the District Court should not have considered Zate's affidavit. They contend that the affidavit was 
submitted after the discovery deadline established by the District Court's scheduling order and that plaintiffs stated that no 
experts had been retained in their responses to expert interrogatories. The District Court found it unnecessary to reach these 
issues in light of its order granting summary judgment. Likewise, we need not address these arguments. "
153,1," Molson Breweries is a partnership owned by The Molson Companies Limited (""Molson Limited"") (40 %), Foster's Brewing 
Group (""Foster's"") (40 %) and Miller (20 %). Old Molson is a wholly owned subsidiary of Molson Breweries."
153,2," Molson Limited and Miller-owned Molson Breweries, U.S.A., Inc. (""Molson USA"") are the other party defendants in this action. 
Miller Brewing of Canada, Limited (""Miller Canada"") was dismissed from this action by stipulation of the parties. For ease of 
reference, ""Miller"" will be used to refer collectively to defendants Miller Brewing and Molson USA and ""Molson"" will be used to 
refer collectively to defendants Molson Limited, Old Molson and Molson Breweries. "
154,3," Coors further alleges Miller has an incentive to restrain Coors unlawfully and to leverage its access to Coors' proprietary and 
strategic information because Coors' growth represents a ""threat"" to Miller, particularly in the important ""light"" beer market that 
accounts for 40 % of Miller's volume and in which Coors has obtained a 21.5 % share."
154,4," As an example, Coors alleges Jefferson J. Carefoote, a former old Molson employee with ""intimate knowledge"" of Coors' 
competitive strength and strategies, is now a Vice President of Miller Brewing's wholly owned subsidiary Molson USA."
154,5," Upon determination that a workload imbalance was affecting the parties adversely, Chief Judge Matsch reassigned this case to 
me on February 23, 1995."
154,6," See slip op. at 4, 15-16. The Tenth circuit invited this court to reconsider the latter conclusion once the parties have had an 
opportunity to conduct discovery and refine their theories. Id. at 16. "
155,7," To the extent Coors relies on Molson's access to its confidential and proprietary market information in its control claim against 
Miller, the practical effect of the Tenth Circuit's ruling is less clear. It is difficult to determine at this stage of the proceedings how 
a stay of Coors' dispute with Molson over Molson's access to confidential information will affect Coors' ability to conduct 
discovery on its control claim against Miller."
155,8," Section 4 of the Clayton Act permits the recovery of damages by ""any person . . . injured in his business or property by reason 
of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 15 (1988). Section 16 entitles ""any person . . . threatened [with] loss or 
damage by a violation of the antitrust laws"" to obtain an injunction. Id. § 26."
155,9," A brief history leading up to the enactment of § 6a is in order. Since the early cases involving concerted activities by shipping 
companies engaged in the transport of passengers and cargo to and from the United States, it has been clear that an activity 
partly within and partly outside the United States falls within the coverage of the United States antitrust laws. See, e.g. Thomsen 
v. Cayser, 243 U.S. 66, 88, 61 L. Ed. 597, 37 S. Ct. 353 (1917). Activity outside the United States, however, has long been 
subject to the United States' antitrust jurisdiction only if it has an anticompetitive effect inside the United States.  United States v. 
Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945) (""Alcoa""). Before enactment of § 6a in 1982, the ""effects test"" articulated 
by Judge Learned Hand in Alcoa had been subject to different applications in the various circuits, becoming an ""effects only"" "
156,," test, a ""direct or substantial effects"" test, a ""direct and substantial effects"" test, and a ""some effects, regardless of whether they 
are intended or substantial,"" test. See Daniel T. Murphy, Moderating Antitrust Subject Matter Jurisdiction: The Foreign Trade 
Antitrust Improvement Act and the Restatement of Foreign Relations Law (Revised), 54 U. Cin. L. Rev. 779, 806 (1986) 
(footnotes and citations omitted). Section 6a was Congress' attempt to temper what many perceived to be the over-application of 
United States antitrust laws to extraterritorial commercial conduct under the more expansive of these tests. See id. at 779, 782-
84 (citations to legislative history omitted)."
156,10," I note here the guidance provided by the American Law Institute's comprehensive restatement of United States antitrust 
jurisdiction law set forth in the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law § 415 (1987). While the Restatement's 
""reasonableness"" approach focuses on balancing United States and foreign interests, it synthesizes and reviews both the 
legislative and judicial efforts in the United States to control the extraterritorial application of federal antitrust laws and should 
prove helpful in future efforts to apply the FTAIA. See generally Reporters' Notes, § 415 pp. 288-94. "
157,11," The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed into law by President Clinton on December 27, 1993. Its 
purpose was to expand trade and the economic relationships between Canada, Mexico and the U.S. by reducing barriers and 
liberalizing restraints on investment and services."
157,12," See International Shoe Co. v. State of Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 90 L. Ed. 95, 66 S. Ct. 154 (1945)."
157,13," I reject the Molson defendants' argument in their Reply that Coors has confessed the motion to dismiss by failing to refute the 
affidavit testimony attached to Molson's opening brief with affidavits of its own as hypertechnical. Affidavits prepared in support 
of Coors' Motion for Preliminary Injunction -- part of the record in this case -- contain statements by Peter Coors and Mark 
Stankovic recounting at least one visit to Colorado by Bruce Pope, the President and CEO of Molson Breweries (a partnership 
owned in part by Molson Limited), to inform Coors of Molson's decision to enter into the Alliance, see Coors Affid. at P 8; and 
documenting the free flow of information and communications between Old Molson and Coors in Colorado, see Stankovic Affid. 
at P 6. I also note an on-line review of pending cases in which the Canadian Molson defendants are parties revealed at least one 
case in which Molson Breweries (ergo, Molson Limited) and Old Molson have submitted to the jurisdiction of a federal court. See 
Labatt v. Molson Breweries, et al., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 699, No. 93-75004 (E.D. Mich. 1993) (while defendants deny minimum 
contacts with the forum, they do not challenge venue there). In at least two other cases, the submission by these defendants to 
the courts' jurisdiction is unclear. See Pearl Brewing Co. v. Miller Brewing Co., et al., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16841, No. SA-93-
CA-205 (W.D. Tex. 1993) (opinion dismissing action for lack of standing published at 1993 WL 424236); Labatt v. Molson 
Breweries, et al., 56 F.3D 13, Nos. 93-CV-75004, 94-CV-71540 (S.D.N.Y.) (discovery ongoing). "
158,14," This does not mean, necessarily, that plaintiff must prove the merger actually drove it from the market before it can recover 
under § 4 of the Clayton Act. Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489 n.14. The short-term effect of some types of anticompetitive behavior, 
e.g., below-cost pricing, may be to stimulate price competition. Id. What plaintiff must show is an injury that reflects the 
anticompetitive effect either of the antitrust violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the violation. Id. at 489."
158,15," While Cargill requires antitrust plaintiffs to plead standing and antitrust injury as necessary elements of claims for damages 
under the Clayton Act, it does not heighten the notice standard for pleading those elements. The rule in this circuit has been that 
HN8[
] complex antitrust litigation is subject to no greater pleading requirements than the Rules of Civil Procedure provide for 
ordinary litigation. See, e.g., Perington, 631 F.2d 1369, 1372-73 (amended complaint charging conspiracy to violate antitrust 
laws sufficient to give fair notice of basis of claim); New Home Appliance Center, Inc. v. Thompson, 250 F.2d 881 (10th Cir. 
1957); c.f. Mountain View Pharmacy v. Abbott Laboratories, 630 F.2d 1383, 1387-88 (10th Cir. 1980) (blanket statement that 
twenty-eight defendants conspired to fix prices on drug sales to thirteen plaintiffs provided inadequate notice for responsive 
pleading). Cargill does not, in my opinion, alter this general rule. See generally Wright, C. Law of Federal Courts, § 68 at 475-76 
(5th ed. 1994) (efforts by some district courts to apply strict rules as to the contents of antitrust complaints generally resulted 
only in a waste of time and longer pleadings, with no corresponding gain). "
159,16," Without relying on this document in ruling on the present motion to dismiss, I note Coors has come forward with an expert 
affidavit to support its contentions regarding the anticompetitive effects of the Alliance. In this affidavit, submitted as part of 
Coors' pending motion for preliminary injunction, Dr. Douglas Greer explains the nature of the United States and North American 
beer markets, and the parties' relevant status in those markets both generally as well as in the ""premium"" and ""light"" market 
segments. According to Dr. Greer, the Miller-Molson combination, considered in light of both Coors' status as ""the main 
competitor"" to Miller and Anheuser-Busch in these markets and the broad discretionary power over Coors' brands granted 
Molson under the Coors-Molson Licensing Agreement, ""may substantially lessen competition"" in the U.S. market generally and 
in the ""premium"" and ""light"" beer market segments in particular. See Affid. of Professor Douglas F. Greer, Ph.D. in Supp. Pl.'s 
Mot. Preliminary Inj., p. 3-5 (emphasis original)."
159,17," Acknowledging the murky nature of Coors's theory regarding the anticompetitive effect of Miller's alleged ability, through the 
Alliance, to control Coors, the Tenth Circuit in dicta nevertheless stated Coors had ""presented a sufficient factual outline to 
suggest it might develop a theory"" of antitrust injury, and stated Coors was ""therefore entitled to conduct discovery and refine its 
theories."" Coors v. Molson et al., 889 F. Supp. 1394, No. 94-1217, slip op. at 16 (inviting Molson, however, to challenge the legal 
sufficiency of Coors' claims ""at a later point in this litigation""). As I indicated supra, at n.7, Coors' ability to prove Miller has 
sufficient control over Coors to restrain competition in the U.S. and North American beer markets is confounded somewhat by 
the Tenth Circuit's imposition of a stay of Coors' claims against Molson to the extent those claims relate to the Coors-Molson 
Licensing Agreement upon which that control is premised. "
160,18," For example, Coors asserts the Miller-Molson Alliance has already affected competition in the U.S. market by preventing 
Coors from pursuing an intention of using Molson to brew Coors beer in Canada for import into certain areas of the U.S. where it 
would be cost-effective to do so, e.g., northern New England. Mem. Opp. Mot. Dismiss at 27 (citing Greer Affid., P 34). "
164,1," The complaint alleges violations of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), the Wilson Tariff Act (15 U.S.C. § 8 et seq.), and 
the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 12 et seq.)."
164,2," The Cartwright Act ( Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16700 et seq.) is the California counterpart of federal antitrust laws. The Unfair 
Practices Act ( Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17000 et seq.) prohibits “unfair, dishonest, deceptive, destructive, fraudulent and 
discriminatory practices by which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented.” ( Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17001.)"
164,3," Code of Civil Procedure section 526a provides, in relevant part: “An action to obtain a judgment, restraining and preventing any 
illegal expenditure of, waste of, or injury to, the estate, funds, or other property of a county, town, city or city and county of the 
state, may be maintained against any officer thereof, or any agent, or other person, acting in its behalf, either by a citizen 
resident therein, or by a corporation, who is assessed for and is liable to pay, or, within one year before the commencement of 
the action, has paid, a tax therein.”"
164,4, All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code except when otherwise indicated.
164,5," Due to the nature of the issue presented, the court invited the Attorney General to appear in this appeal as amicus curiae. He 
accepted the invitation and filed a letter brief on April 11, 1995. That brief states that “although the matter is not free from doubt, 
the Attorney General has exclusive authority to bring statewide class actions for treble damages under state and federal antitrust 
laws on behalf of political subdivisions and other public agencies of the state.” We address specific arguments in the amicus 
brief at various points below. "
167,6," County counsel serves as legal adviser to the county if the county has created such position. ( Gov. Code, § 26526.) Further, 
“whenever the board of supervisors appoints a county counsel pursuant to this chapter, he shall discharge all the duties vested 
by law in the district attorney other than those of a public prosecutor.” ( Gov. Code, § 27642.) In the federal class action, the 
county is represented by county counsel and by private counsel. To the extent the county has an independent right of action 
under section 16750, subdivisions (a) and (b), appellant does not contend county counsel and private counsel are inappropriate 
attorneys for the county. Appellant simply disagrees there is such a right of action in the present circumstances. Appellant does 
argue that the section 16750, subdivision (g) powers of the district attorney cannot be exercised by county counsel pursuant to 
Government Code section 27642. Because we hold that the power to prosecute the Cartwright Act class action arises from 
section 16750, subdivision (a), and not section 16750, subdivision (g), we need not reach appellant's contention. The right to sue 
under federal antitrust laws is conferred by those laws. (See, e.g., Georgia v. Evans (1942) 316 U.S. 159, 162 [86 L. Ed. 1346, 
1350, 62 S.Ct. 972].)"
167,7," A case cited by both parties is a clear example of this duality. In People ex rel. Freitas v. City and County of San Francisco 
(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 913 [155 Cal.Rptr. 319], the district attorney, in his “public official” role sued his own government entity, 
the City and County of San Francisco, for antitrust violations in setting taxi fares. The city and county was represented by the city 
attorney, acting in the role of “government lawyer.” "
168,8," That sentence now reads: “The Attorney General may bring an action on behalf of the state or of any of its political subdivisions 
or public agencies to recover the damages provided for by this section, or by any comparable provision of federal law, provided 
that the Attorney General shall notify in writing any political subdivision or public agency of his or her intention to 
bring any such action on its behalf, and at any time within 30 days thereafter, such political subdivision or public 
agency may, by formal resolution of its governing body or as otherwise specifically provided by applicable law, 
withdraw the authority of the Attorney General to bring the intended action.” The portion set out in boldface was not 
contained in the amendments as originally proposed. "
169,9," We find nothing at all implausible or absurd, as suggested by amicus curiae, about a statutory scheme that reserves to the 
local elective governing body the determination to use local resources to sue on a statutory cause of action. Such power is 
normal for a local governing body. (See Gov. Code, § 23005 [“A county may exercise its powers only through the board of 
supervisors or through agents and officers acting under authority of the board or authority conferred by law”].)"
169,10," Thus, properly viewed, subdivisions (d) and (g) of section 16750 are new and supplementary grants of enforcement power. As 
such, there is no anomaly in the Attorney General's responsibility to supervise the new power of the district attorney, but lack of 
responsibility to supervise the previously existing enforcement authority of local governmental entities. Instead of such 
supervisory responsibility in the case of actions initiated by local governments, the Attorney General is authorized to “render 
legal services as special counsel to” the local entity under certain circumstances. (See § 16750, subd. (e).)"
169,11," This statutory scheme finds a parallel in section 16760. There, individuals retain all rights to sue for individual violations of 
antitrust laws, but the Attorney General and the district attorney are given concurrent power to sue on behalf and in the name of 
such individuals as a class. The creation of a concurrent power in the Attorney General or the district attorney does not divest 
individuals of the initial power to file suit on their own behalf, nor to “opt out” of such a suit, just as the local entity can under 
section 16750. (See § 16760, subd. (b)(2); see Bruno v. Superior Court (1981) 127 Cal.App.3d 120, 133 [179 Cal.Rptr. 342].) "
170,12," We express no opinion about the validity of a legislative restriction that expressly prevented local governments from seeking 
an otherwise available federal court remedy, such as a class-wide damages judgment under the Sherman Act. We have 
concluded in the present case that section 16750 is not such a legislative restriction on local government entities. "
177,1," The Court notes that the sur-reply brief filed by Kendiesel violates the rules of this Court and, therefore, was not considered by 
the Court in rendering its decision. "
178,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act states in relevant part: ""Every contract, combination in the form a trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 
U.S.C. § 1. Section 2 of the Sherman Act states: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or 
conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign, nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding one 
million dollars if a corporation, or, if any other person, one hundred thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three 
years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
179,3," In Kodak, the Supreme Court affirmed the denial of summary judgment in a case where the plaintiff was accused by the 
defendant of tying the sale of parts to the sale of service in an attempt to drive out independent service dealers. Importantly, the 
Court in Kodak analyzed the defendant's antitrust allegations under the more stringent standards of Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 56. In this case, the Court is analyzing defendant's antitrust allegations under the more lenient standard of Federal 
Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). "
181,4," The Court can see nothing unlawful in Lucas reminding the SDs of the contractual commitments. Therefore, the Court will strike 
this portion of paragraph 10. "
190,1," Plaintiff's citation to Federal Trade Commission v. Ticor Title Insurance Co., 504 U.S. 621, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 119 L. Ed. 2d 410 
(1992) is inapposite. That case concerned state-action immunity from antitrust laws. 112 S. Ct. at 2175. The state-action 
doctrine is premised upon ""principles of federalism,"" 112 S. Ct. at 2176, citing Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 187 
L. Ed. 315 (1943), where the doctrine was first announced. The state-action doctrine has nothing to do with the McCarran-
Ferguson Act."
190,2," The exception does not apply to a Clayton Act claim. Thus, the analysis above is sufficient basis for judgment on the pleadings 
in favor of Defendants with respect to the Clayton Act claim without considering the boycott exception. "

211,2," To the extent that Count VIII is based on the conduct which forms the basis of Count V, defendant seeks summary judgment as

212,3," Since the only element challenged by defendant's motion is that of injury, the court limits its discussion herein to said element

elements of plaintiff's equitable estoppel claim. "

216,5," Lago's March 1992 Accounts Payable Report shows that between June 1989 and September 1989 Lago did not pay Hood 
invoices totaling $ 215,358.84. "
218,6," Section 2(a) provides, in relevant part, HN19[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, either directly or indirectly, 
to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality . . . where the effect of such 
discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, 
destroy, or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or 
with customers of either of them . . . . """
218,15," U.S.C. § 13(a) (1973). HN20[
] Section (d) makes it unlawful "
219,," for any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for the benefit of a customer of 
such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any service or facilities furnished by or 
through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of any products or commodities 
manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or consideration is available on proportionally 
equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities."
219,15, U.S.C. § 13(d) (1973).
219,7," Hood concedes, for the purpose of the present motion only, that an antitrust violation has occurred and that Lago has been 
damaged by it. Hood's Reply Memorandum at 2. Accordingly, the court assumes that Hood's conduct, in selling its dairy 
products to its direct-buy retailers at lower prices than it sold those same products to Lago for resale to other retailers, may have 
lessened, injured, destroyed, or prevented competition for the sale of Hood dairy products at the retail level in violation of the 
Robinson-Patman Act. The court further assumes that Lago was damaged thereby. "
221,8," The court notes that the Affidavit of Josephine R. Raczkowski (Hood's Reply Exhibit B) reveals that some of Nugent's price 
comparisons are incorrect and further demonstrates that Lago received lower prices than Hood's direct-buy retailers on some 
Hood products during the time period in question. "
222,9," In so finding, the court has considered Hood's well-argued contention that there are numerous factors which could have 
rendered Lago's retailers unable to compete with Hood's direct-buy retailers for the sale of Hood dairy products. However, it is 
not necessary for Lago to prove that Hood's antitrust violation is the sole cause of its injury. Instead, as the Supreme Court 
stated in Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 395 U.S. 100, 114 n.9, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 (1969), ""It is enough 
that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the injury; a plaintiff need not exhaust all possible alternative sources of 
injury in fulfilling his burden of proving compensable injury under § 4."" See also Sullivan v. National Football League, 34 F.3d 
1091, 1103 (1st Cir. 1994) (""'Plaintiffs need not prove that the antitrust violation was the sole cause of their injury, but only that it 
was a material cause.'"" (quoting Engine Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 446 
U.S. 983, 64 L. Ed. 2d 839, 100 S. Ct. 2964 (1980))), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1252 (1995). Further, where there is evidence 
""that the decline in plaintiff's profits . . . was not caused by an antitrust violation and instead resulted from other factors, . . . 
resolution of the issue ordinarily is for the trier of fact."" ANTITRUST LAW DEVELOPMENTS (SECOND), chp. VII, § C.1, at 408. "
224,10," The court notes that other courts ""have interpreted Supreme Court caselaw and the antitrust laws more narrowly, holding that 
a plaintiff must be a market participant in order to establish antitrust injury."" Sullivan, supra, 25 F.3d at 49 (citing cases). 
Although the First Circuit has not yet decided which of these interpretations apply in this circuit, this court finds the reasoning 
employed by the courts following the broader rule to be persuasive and applies that rule herein. Those courts reason that the injury suffered by a plaintiff used as a means to effect an antitrust violation is within the core of Congressional 
concern underlying the antitrust laws, which is ""'to create a private enforcement mechanism that would deter violators and 
deprive them of the fruits of their illegal actions and would provide ample compensation to the victims of antitrust violations.'"" Sullivan, supra, 25 F.3d at 49 n.11 (quoting Ashmore, supra, 843 F. Supp. at 770 (quoting McCready, supra, 457 U.S. at 472); 
see also Ostrofe, supra, 740 F.2d at 746-47). "
226,11," Lago's damages are, however, limited to the time period during which Lago was a distributor of Hood dairy products. "
227,12," The court further notes that Lago's lost profits analysis results in a lost gross profits figure. The correct measure of damages, 
which is the measure Lago must prove at trial, is lost net profits. See, e.g., Eastman Kodak Co. v. Southern Photo Materials Co., 
273 U.S. 359, 379, 71 L. Ed. 684, 47 S. Ct. 400 (1927)."
227,13," The court notes that the antitrust standing hurdle is only the first of several hurdles Lago must clear to recover treble damages 
under § 4 of the Clayton Act. At trial, Lago will be required to prove that Hood violated the Robinson-Patman Act in the manner 
alleged and that Lago suffered an actual injury attributable to said violation. J. Truett Payne, supra, 451 U.S. at 562. Lago must 
also submit sufficient evidence ""to support a 'just and reasonable inference' of damage."" Id. at 566. "
247,1," The Court also grants Anti-Monopoly's motion to redefine the market to include a submarket of ""monopoly-type family board 
games,"" but notes, without at this time so holding, that the definition appears too narrow to be relevant for purposes of an 
antitrust claim."
247,2," Anti-Monopoly would not be responsible for costs incurred in formulating elements of the initial defense that are still valuable to 
Hasbro for purposes of a new defense. It is not at all clear which costs incurred to date as a result of Anti-Monopoly's original 
market definition will remain of value throughout this litigation."
247,3, Anti-Monopoly has withdrawn Count IX as to Toys and K-Mart. (Pl. Reply Br. at 9.)
247,4," Having granted Anti-Monopoly's motion to amend the Complaint, all references to a Complaint are to the Second Amended 
Complaint unless otherwise noted. "
248,5," The Court reminds Plaintiff of the warning of Judge McCurn of the Northern District of New York: ""[Plaintiff has] made the 
court's task in deciding these motions particularly arduous due to [its] poorly drafted pleadings and memoranda of law. Counsel 
[is] forewarned that in the future motion papers such as these will simply be returned. The court is burdened enough without 
having to do legal research for counsel and speculate as to the exact nature of a given claim or argument."" Repasky v. Orzel, 
1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2668. "
252,6," Rather than focusing on the sufficiency of the allegations, Hasbro bases its motion on Anti-Monopoly's requested relief for an 
order compelling divestiture of the acquisitions. However, the issue for the Court at this time is not what relief is appropriate, but 
whether Anti-Monopoly has stated a claim under the law. "
264,1," In fact, Guirguis' policy did not provide for copayments at any level. ""Among the choices of coverages which were offered to Dr. 
Guirguis, Guirguis chose that level of coverage which provided for Guirguis to pay the first $ 10,000 of annual medical expenses 
for himself or for a covered dependent, with the contracting Blue Cross Defendant responsible for the balance of covered 
charges."" (Amended Complaint, p. 3). It is unclear whether the Guirguis Class consists only of insureds with these types of 
contracts, or whether it includes insureds whose policies provide for copayments, at some level, but who incurred medical 
expenses that did not exceed the deductible threshold. For purposes of this motion, it is assumed that the Guirguis Class 
includes both types of insureds."
264,2," The price-fixing alleged in this paragraph is asserted only as part of the fraud under the RICO claim, not as an antitrust claim. "
265,3," The Treasurer of Virginia filed a claim on behalf of persons who were entitled to, but did not, file claims. The record does not 
reflect the resolution of this effort to have those funds escheat to the Commonwealth under state law. "
267,4," Other courts have employed a four-part test to determine whether the McCarran-Ferguson Act precludes application of a 
federal statute. Under that approach, the inquiry is whether: (1) the federal statute relates specifically to the business of 
insurance; (2) the acts challenged under that statute constitute the business of insurance; (3) the state has enacted a law 
regulating the challenged acts; and (4) the state law would be invalidated, impaired or superseded by application of the federal 
statute. See Merchants Home Delivery Service, Inc. v. Frank B. Hall & Co. Inc., 50 F.3d 1486, 1489 (9th Cir. 1995); Cochran v. 
Paco, Inc., 606 F.2d 460, 464 (5th Cir. 1979); Everson v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ohio, No. 93cv7534, 1994 WL 6752000, at 
*10 (N.D. Ohio June 15, 1994); Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., 827 F. Supp. 1498, 1520 (D. Nev. 1993); First Nat'l Bank of Pa. v. 
Sedgwick James of Minnesota, Inc., 792 F. Supp. 409, 417 (W.D. Pa. 1992); Senich v. Transamerica Premier Ins. Co., 766 F. 
Supp. 339, 340-41 (W.D. Pa. 1990). However, because the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has never 
adopted this four-part test, and because the Supreme Court did not subscribe to it in Fabe, the analytical framework to be used 
here will be the one used by the Supreme Court in Fabe. See infra note 5. "
269,5," Some post-Fabe decisions considering the first clause of Section 2(b) have continued to analyze whether the practice that is 
the subject of the federal law constitutes the ""business of insurance."" See Merchants Home Delivery Serv., Inc. v. Frank B. Hall 
& Co., Inc., 50 F.3d 1486 (9th Cir. 1995); Everson v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Ohio, 1994 WL 675200 (N.D. Ohio, June 15, 
1994). This seems somewhat at odds with the standard clearly articulated in Fabe, which requires a court to focus on the 
purpose of the state statute at issue. Fabe, 113 S. Ct. at 2210. The courts which have followed that approach have used the 
four-part test developed before Fabe to determine whether the McCarran-Ferguson Act precludes application of a federal 
statute. See supra note 4. The second prong of that test requires the court to ask whether the practices challenged under the 
federal statute themselves constitute the business of insurance. However, Fabe seems to require a broader analysis where the 
first clause of Section 2(b) is at issue because the Court expressly held that the category of laws enacted ""for the purpose of 
regulating the business of insurance . . . necessarily encompasses more than just the business of insurance."" Fabe, 113 S. Ct. 
at 2210. It is for this reason that here the court adheres to the analysis articulated in Fabe. "
270,6," In fact, National Securities expressly states that ""the selling and advertising of policies"" constitutes the business of insurance. 
National Securities, 393 U.S. at 460. "
271,7," The same result would obtain upon application of the second facet of the four-part test applied in Merchants Home Delivery 
and Everson because the practice at issue in this action is the business of insurance and is not an ""'anillary activity' that do[es] 
not affect performance of the insurance contract or enforcement of contractual obligations."" Fabe, 113 S. Ct. at 2209 (quoting 
Pireno, 458 U.S. at 134 n. 8.). "
273,8," The SCC has acted under these, and other, provisions of the state insurance law to stop the discounting practices, to impose a 
$ 5 million civil penalty and to secure the insurers' agreement to a consent order by which they are required to implement, under 
the supervision of the SCC, a comprehensive refund program which has produced more than 128,000 refunds amounting to a 
total payment of $ 21.9 million. Those punitive and corrective measures were the product of a comprehensive investigation 
which considered the offending practices, the interests of the insurers, the need for remedial action, the need for punishment 
and the public interest. With those factors in mind, the SCC effectuated the remedial program and imposed the punishment it 
thought best satisfied all interests. "
274,9," The court also recognizes that some of the district courts whose decisions are cited above might be required to reach different 
results in light of the decisions issued by their respective courts of appeals. "
280,1," Though the factual record remains to be fully developed through trial of these matters, the Court believes that the facts stated 
herein are generally undisputed, based on the proceedings to date."
280,2, Midland Fumigant is not a defendant in this case.
280,3," Non-defendants Sinochem (China), Lian Yun Gang (China), and Excel Industries (India) also manufactured aluminum 
phosphide products for sale and distribution in the United States."
280,4," Of the defendants in this case, McShares and Bernardo Chemicals (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Casa Bernardo) were not 
charged in the criminal case. "
281,5," Because he has devoted his career to partisan adjudicatory purposes, it is perhaps no surprise that Dr. Hoyt's professional 
stature is unequal to that of defendants' expert, Dr. John J. Siegfried. Dr. Siegfried is a professor of economics at Vanderbilt 
University, where he has served with distinction for 22 years. His professional credentials include numerous visiting 
professorships throughout the world, service as a Fulbright Senior Scholar (1991-92), selection as current president-elect of the 
Southern Economic Association (the largest regional association of economists in the United States), and service on the senior 
staff of President Gerald Ford's Council of Economic Advisors. In 1990, the National Association of Economic Educators 
honored Dr. Siegfried for lifetime contributions to research on economics education. In additional, Dr. Siegfried has authored 
more than 100 books and articles in prestigious economic journals throughout the United States, and currently serves on the 
editorial boards of three such journals. In noteworthy contrast with Dr. Hoyt, Dr. Siegfried has testified as an expert in six to nine 
cases. Dr. Siegfried does not advertise his availability as an expert witness and he devotes only five to eight percent of his time 
to consulting."
281,6," For purposes of this ruling, the Court notes that Dr. Hoyt's report was intended and required to contain a complete statement of 
all opinions to be expressed at trial, on direct examination, with the reasons and basis therefor. Plaintiffs have clearly understood 
and acknowledged their duty under Rule 26(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Letter from Angela K. Green to 
Hon. Kathryn H. Vratil (May 19, 1995). Out of an abundance of caution, however, and to avoid any arguable unfairness as 
counsel and the Court chart new paths under the 1993 amendments to Rule 26 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., 125 L. Ed. 2d 469,     U.S.    , 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), the Court has construed Dr. Hoyt's report of March 27, 1995, as 
supplemented by his testimony at the hearing on May 16, 1995."
281,7," According to Dr. Hoyt, the following factors provided defendants the ability and economic incentive to maintain prices at higher 
than competitive levels: four firms (Degesch America, Pestcon, Research and Bernardo) controlled 90% of the market; demand 
was inelastic and declining during the time period; market entry was limited by relatively high barriers in the form of licensing "
282,," and/or registration requirements by the United States government; and aluminum phosphide products are fungible. Expert 
Report of Richard C. Hoyt, at p. 7, P 6."
282,8," For purposes of this motion, the Court refers to Degesch Weyers, Degesch Divisions, and Detia Export as the ""Degesch 
companies."" "
283,9," According to Dr. Hoyt, when differences between the actual prices and the 1993 normative prices are multiplied times the 
quantities actually purchase, the total overcharge to plaintiffs is $ 6,263,428.24."
283,10," Dr. Hoyt's complaints to the contrary are not credible, and indeed are contradicted by his own testimony at the hearing on May 
16, 1995."
283,11," Dr. Hoyt offers no scientific rationale for his refusal to consider data from the pre-conspiracy period. Whether we accept his 
premise that a ""before or after"" model is just as valid as a ""before and after"" model, we must hold Dr. Hoyt to those conclusions 
and opinions which are grounded in the methods and procedures of science and not based on subjective belief or unsupported 
speculation. Dr. Hoyt's method fails to address (let alone account for) an obvious sign of error in his analytical approach -- the 
elevated pre-conspiracy price structure -- and to this extent it is not grounded in the methods and procedures of the science of 
economics."
283,12," As noted earlier, the grand jury issued subpoenas in the late summer or early fall of 1991. The government did not unseal the 
indictments until November 1, 1993. Thus it appears that Dr. Hoyt confused the terms ""indictment"" and ""subpoena"" in his 
testimony. "
284,13," See Expert Report of Richard C. Hoyt (March 27, 1995) at 6- 7, paragraphs 5-6."
284,14," Dr. Siegfried applied the dummy variable approach to Dr. Hoyt's purported normative period, with surprising results. For two of 
the four companies on which Dr. Siegfried performed the dummy variable analysis, the statistical indicator method revealed that 
defendants' prices were actually lower than what would have been expected during the conspiracy period, January, 1988 
through December, 1992. As a result, Dr. Siegfried concluded that Dr. Hoyt's benchmark period had ""no basis."""
284,15," The before and after model cannot be properly applied unless an appropriate normative period, however selected, has been 
identified. In view of the Court's finding with respect to Dr. Hoyt's selection of the normative period in this case, the proposed 
before and after model cannot be properly applied. Therefore, it is arguably unnecessary to discuss Dr. Hoyt's conclusion that 
the difference in prices between the conspiracy period and the post-conspiracy period results solely from the alleged conspiracy. 
In order that the record is complete, however, the Court finds in the alternative that defendants' motion should be sustained for 
additional reasons as well. "
285,16," It is improper to assume that all prices compared to 1993 are non-normative, because if one looks to the period before 
January, 1988, one sees much higher prices than occur in 1993."
285,17," An economist could go farther, by identifying specific demand and supply factors such as the cost of aluminum and 
phosphorus ingredients, stocks of grains, numbers of competitors, and so forth. Dr. Siegfried explained, however, that under the 
minimalistic analysis use of time as a variable ""folds those into a single variable that's capturing all of those things put together."""
285,18," Dr. Hoyt determined the amount of damages by using separate benchmark prices for each defendant, based on the individual 
defendant's average 1993 price, as opposed to a single average 1993 benchmark price for the entire industry. This approach is 
contrary to Dr. Hoyt's assumption that aluminum phosphide products are fungible. According to Dr. Hoyt, the fungible nature of 
aluminum phosphide is one of the market factors which allowed defendants the economic incentive and ability to maintain prices 
at higher than competitive levels. Expert Report of Richard C. Hoyt, p. 7, P 6. Under well-accepted economic theory, however, 
fungible products -- or products which are the same -- will be sold at the same price in a competitive market. Dr. Hoyt uses 
multiple benchmark prices, ranging from $ 190 for Inventa to $ 400 for Degesch America. As Dr. Siegfried stated, this is an 
""enormous price difference for a product that is supposedly the same."" If aluminum phosphide products are truly fungible, then a 
prudent economist would use a single benchmark price to calculate the amount of damages. Thus, Dr. Hoyt's selection of 
individual benchmark prices is inconsistent with the way an economist would do it, and his methodology is clearly calculated to 
exaggerate the amount of damages, without any basis in economic theory or principle."
285,19," See, e.g., Parker, Measuring Damages in Federal Treble Actions, 17 Antitrust Bull. 497, 506 (1972); Hovenkamp, Economics 
and Federal Antitrust Law, p. 418 (1985) (before-and after model must be adjusted to account for changes in market) (cited in 
Expert Report of Richard C. Hoyt at p. 8, n.7). "
286,20, Dr. Hoyt does not seek to exclude causation factors other than higher costs.
286,21," Dr. Hoyt also relied on SIC 2879, Agricultural Chemicals, which measures the industry costs for miscellaneous agricultural 
chemicals produced in the United States. Because the scope of this index is not limited to aluminum phosphide products and 
covers only United States companies, it is less probative than Degesch America's cost information. "
294,1," N.Y. PUB. HEALTH L. § 230, subd. 11 (McKinney 1990 & Supp. 1992). "
295,2," Dr. Johnson's brief argued that his delay in seeking a PHC ruling was justified because the PHC lacked jurisdiction and, in any 
case, because the PHC -- which in Dr. Johnson's view would not itself examine the medical issues relating to his care of patients 
-- would benefit from the detailed review then being conducted by the OPMC. The first of these arguments was rejected by the 
Second Circuit in Johnson I. 964 F.2d at 121-22."
295,3," The parties are at loggerheads over the extent to which the charges rejected by the OPMC were bases for the hospital's 
revocation of Dr. Johnson's privileges. In view of the disposition of this motion, there is no need to address that issue. "
298,4," While Dr. Johnson commenced Johnson I three days before the expiration of the statute on the civil rights claims, he did not 
assert any of those claims in that case."
298,5," This contrasts sharply with the principle applied to continuous courses of wrongful conduct in other areas of the law, where 
each act in furtherance of the wrongful scheme or pattern begins a new limitations period but does not reach back to render 
timely claims based on acts outside the statutory limitation period. E.g., Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 
392 U.S. 481, 502, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. Ct. 2224 (1968) (continuing antitrust violation); Singleton v. City of New York, 632 
F.2d 185 (2d Cir. 1980); Rutkin v. Reinfeld, 229 F.2d 248 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Kaplow v. Reinfeld, 352 U.S. 844, 1 "
299,," L. Ed. 2d 60, 77 S. Ct. 50 (1956) (continuing conspiracy); II PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST 
LAW P 338(b), at 149 (rev. ed. 1995) (continuing antitrust violation)."
299,6," There are important differences between Title VII cases and actions based on claims under Sections 1981 and 1985(3) that 
may warrant different treatment with respect to continuing violations. The limitation period in Title VII cases is 180 to 300 days, 
recovery of back pay is capped at two years, and compensatory and punitive damages are capped at legislatively determined 
amounts, even in continuing violation cases. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981a, 2000e-5(g) (1988 & Supp. 1993). The limitation period in 
Section 1981 and 1985(3) cases is much longer. Even more important, there is no cap on the period for which monetary 
damages may be awarded. Hence, simple transplantation of the continuing violation doctrine from Title VII to Sections 1981 and 
1985(3) may produce unintended consequences. In view of this Court's conclusion that the requirements of the continuing 
violations doctrine, as it is applied in Title VII cases, are not satisfied here, this issue need not be decided."

301,10," The first prong of the Berry standard assumes that the act within the period of limitation itself constitutes a violation of the civil 
rights laws, as it must in light of Delaware State College's holding that a mere consequence within the period of an earlier 
violation is insufficient to trigger the continuing violation doctrine. 449 U.S. at 257-58. The parties therefore have debated 
whether the 1994 reinstatement application involved, as Dr. Johnson claims, an unprincipled manipulation or, as the hospital 
claims, a straightforward application of the credentialing process established by the hospital's By-Laws. If it was the former, there "
302,," may well be a basis for concluding that Dr. Johnson has established a prima facie case that the 1994 incident was a violation of 
the same character alleged with respect to the 1987 decision. If it was the latter, there probably is not. In view of the basis upon 
which the Court disposes of this motion, it need not determine this issue. "

325,7," In response to these motions, Plaintiffs make several arguments that can be dealt with summarily. First, Plaintiffs contend that 
summary judgment is inappropriate because some of the Defendants asserted the Fifth Amendment during their depositions. 
This argument is clearly without merit. Defendants' subsequent assertion of their right to be free from self incrimination cannot 
possibly impact the preclusive effect of prior decisions by a competent tribunal. Second, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants waived their right to assert issue preclusion by not raising it in their answer. This 
argument is without merit. Plaintiffs admit that Defendants raised an affirmative defense of res judicata. The term res judicata is 
often used to encompass both issue and claim preclusion. Migra v. Warren City School District, 465 U.S. 75, 77 n.1, 79 L. Ed. 2d 
56, 104 S. Ct. 892 (1984); Robi v. Five Platters, Inc., 838 F.2d 318, 320 (9th Cir. 1988); In the Matter of the Dowsett Trust, 7 
Haw. App. 640, 644 n.2, 791 P.2d 398 (1990). Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants' assertion of this affirmative defense was 
premature because the state courts had not yet ruled on the state actions. This contention is likewise without merit. Plaintiffs' 
state court action was pending when Defendants filed their answer. Accordingly, it was appropriate for Defendants to raise the 
defense of res judicata at that time. If the actions were not final by the time this court considered their preclusive effect, the 
defense would simply fail. Third, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should not give the prior actions preclusive effect because they have discovered new 
evidence since those decisions were rendered. This alleged discovery, however, does not alter the preclusive effect of the prior 
decisions. If anything, the evidence provides Plaintiffs a grounds for challenging the validity of the actions in the state courts. "
326,8," Issue preclusion and claim preclusion have historically been called collateral estoppel and bar or merger respectively. ""Res 
judicata"" has also been used narrowly on occasion to refer solely to claim preclusion. Both the United States Supreme Court and 
the Ninth Circuit, however, have indicated a preference for the use of the modern terms of issue and claim preclusion to avoid 
confusion. Migra, 465 U.S. at 77 n.1; Robi, 838 F.2d at 320; see also, Dowsett Trust, 7 Haw. App. 640, 644 n.2, 791 P.2d 398 
(1990). "
328,9," In September, 1990, the Hawaii legislature amended Rule 12 to provide that a dismissal for want of prosecution where no 
pretrial statement has been filed is without prejudice. Rules of Circuit Courts, Rule 12(q) (emphasis added). "
330,10," HN27[
] Rule 29 of the Rules of the Circuit Courts provides that ""a case may be dismissed with prejudice for want of 
prosecution after notice of not less than 5 days where all defendants are in default and if the plaintiff fails to obtain entry of 
default and fails to apply for default judgment within six months after all defendants are in default."" "
331,11," In fact, in 1989, Plaintiffs indicated to the state court that they were considering such action, but had decided not to. In this 
Court's Order filed December 18, 1990, the Court refused to assert supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' other state court "
332,," claims. However, this was because the Court found the allegations concerning the state claims to be ""woefully inadequate."" The 
Court was unwilling to waste time and resources allowing Plaintiff's to amend their complaint for the fifth time."
332,12," The Court notes that Rule 12(q) of the Hawaii Rules of the Circuit Courts, providing for dismissal for lack of prosection prior to 
the filing of a pretrial statement is not applicable because Plaintiffs had filed such a statement on February 7, 1990 (emphasis 
added). "
337,13," Fasi's claim of absolute and/or qualified immunity is in fact an argument in the alternative. His primary contention is that he 
""did not have the authority, duty or responsibility to enforce the applicant's compliance with the Conditional Use Permit (""CUP"")."" 
See Fasi's Memorandum In Support Of Motion 5 at 2. He states that approval of the CUP, enforcement of the CUP conditions, 
and other matters associated with the CUP (including appellate review) did not involve his vote, opinion, judgment, exercise of 
discretion, or other action as a public servant. Id. Instead, Fasi alleges, ""the person who had the authority, duty, and 
responsibility to enforce compliance with the CUP was the Director of the DLU, not Fasi."" Id. "
339,14," Plaintiffs have submitted Conciliation Agreements demonstrating that the FEC found ""reason to believe"" that Royal Hawaiian 
Country Club, YYVC, Tetsuo Yasuda (a.k.a. Han Soo Chun) and Yasuo Yasuda (a.k.a. Han Kuk Chun) violated 2 U.S.C. § 
441e, prohibiting foreign nationals from contributing to candidates for political office. The parties participated in informal 
conciliation prior to a finding of probable cause and agreed to findings that the statute was violated. RHCC, YYVC and the 
Yasuda's were assessed civil penalties for these violations. "
342,15," The Court rejects Defendants' argument that there has been a ""final, adjudicated finding that the City acted properly and within 
its discretion in accepting the CUP in this case."" Defendants are referring to the companion case of Aurio v. Fasi, Civil No. 90-
00526, in which Plaintiffs brought an action against the City of Honolulu for inverse condemnation. The Court dismissed that 
action as not ripe for federal review because Plaintiffs had not yet pursued all available state remedies. In an order denying 
Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of this dismissal, the Court noted that ""Plaintiffs charge the City with unlawfully approving 
the relocation plan under the Conditional Use Permit (""CUP"") in this case and the related RICO action of Pedrina v. Chun, 906 F. 
Supp. 1377, Civ. 89-00439 ACK. Yet, all evidence before this Court shows that the City acted within their discretion and for a 
public purpose."" This dicta by the Court on motion for reconsideration of a dismissal without prejudice does not adequately 
demonstrate that the issue was ""actually litigated"" for purposes of issue preclusion. "
357,1," These traditional cable reps are companies founded in the early 1980s and are owned by the cable companies. National Cable 
is a limited partnership in which four cable companies are limited partners. The other two are corporations whose stock is owned 
by cable companies. All three operate nationally representing only cable companies, but not always the same ones. "
358,2," As Thompson Everett's chief operating officer explained in response to questioning: Q. If the interest of the advertiser are inconsistent with selling spot cable for a particular cable operator, you are going to do 
what is in the advertiser's interests, not what is in the interests of the cable operator; is that correct? A. That's correct. "
359,," She also stated that the company does not sign exclusives because it will utilize alternative means, such as placing advertising 
into other media, if the cable spot time is not well-suited or properly priced for the advertiser's purposes. "
368,1," The plaintiff-intervenor class will be referred to collectively as ""intervenors,"" and the defendant infant formula manufacturers will 
be referred to as ""manufacturers."" "
369,2," The specific grounds found in the defendants' motion for summary judgment are as follows: A. The claims asserted by plaintiff-intervenors, although couched in the language of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices 
Act (""DTPA""), are cognizable only under the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act (the ""TFEAA""); plaintiff-intervenors, as 
indirect purchasers of infant formula, have no standing under the TFEAA to bring such claims. B. In the alternative, even if plaintiff-intervenors' claims are cognizable as DTPA claims, plaintiff-intervenors still have no 
standing because the later-enacted TFEAA, which specifically addresses the claims asserted by plaintiff-intervenors, bars 
suits by indirect purchasers. The concurrence focuses on only the first half of the first ground and determines that the intervenors' claims have no merit as 
DTPA claims. This is an issue we need not decide because even if the motion for summary judgment could be read as raising 
an issue on unconscionability, we choose to dispose of this case on the primary grounds argued by the parties in both the trial 
court and on appeal. "
370,3," Section 15.04 provides: HN2[
] The purpose of this Act is to maintain and promote economic competition in trade and commerce occurring wholly 
or partly within the State of Texas and to provide the benefits of that competition to consumers in the state. The provisions 
of this Act shall be construed to accomplish this purpose and shall be construed in harmony with federal judicial 
interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes to the extent consistent with this purpose. (emphasis added)."
370,4," It is possible, with sufficient simplifying assumptions, to determine a formula for calculating how the overcharge is to be 
distributed between the direct purchaser and the indirect purchasers. The formula would assume that the market for the direct 
purchaser's product is perfectly competitive, the overcharge is imposed equally on all indirect purchasers, and that the direct 
purchaser maximizes its profits. If this is the case, the ratio of the shares of the overcharge borne by the direct purchaser and 
the indirect purchaser will equal the ratio of the elasticities of supply and demand in the market for the direct purchaser's product.  
Illinois Brick 431 U.S. at 741; see also Schaefer, Passing-On Theory in Antitrust Treble Damage Actions: An Economic and 
Legal Analysis, 16 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 883 (1975). This analysis further relies on the assumption that the proper elasticities can 
be determined by an already overburdened judicial system. "
372,1," The Court does not frame its analysis as one of preemption in the traditional sense, but instead concludes that in order to 
harmonize the provisions of the DTPA and the Antitrust Act, we must consistently apply the limitation on suits by indirect 
purchasers. While the indirect purchaser rule may be consistent with the policies and goals of antitrust law, I am not convinced 
that the policies and goals of the DTPA are sufficiently similar to warrant the incorporation of this rule in DTPA law. "
379,1," See, e.g., Birchfield v. Texarkana Memorial Hosp., 747 S.W.2d 361, 368 (Tex. 1987) (refusing to limit statute to recovery for 
affirmative deceptive acts, practices, or representations and refusing to find DTPA exemption for health care liability for claims 
arising before enactment of express exemption); Melody Home Mfg. Co. v. Barnes, 741 S.W.2d 349, 352 (Tex. 1987) (refusing 
to require actual payment to establish ""consumer"" standing); Mayo v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 711 S.W.2d 5, 6 
(Tex. 1986) (rejecting argument that insured's recovery of penalties under Article 3.62 precluded suit under Article 21.21); Vail v. 
Texas Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 754 S.W.2d 129, 132, 135 (Tex. 1985) (holding that recovery under an insurance contract 
does not preclude statutory recovery, and that the legislature did not intend to exempt insurers from DTPA liability); Big H Auto 
Auction, Inc. v. Saenz Motors, 665 S.W.2d 756, 758 (Tex. 1984) (refusing to exclude purchasers who bought goods for resale 
from the definition of ""consumer""). "
380,2," A Ross Laboratories Training Manual emphasized the importance of the hospital staff: Ross Hospital Feeding System is designed to provide an early and convenient means of getting infants started on Similac . 
. . and ultimately sent home with instructions that they continue to use Similac. Never underestimate the importance of nurses. If they are sold and serviced properly, they can be strong allies. A nurse 
who supports Ross is like an extra salesperson. "
388,1," The court was notified per letter dated March 20, 1995, that NAT, L.C., has been renamed Northwest Arkansas Times, L.C. "
389,2, Steve Trollinger and Mike Brown own a small percentage of the stock in CPI.
389,3," Plaintiff CPI has also desired to purchase the Times. Steve Trollinger, the President of CPI and the publisher of the Daily 
Record, has sent a number of letters over the years to Thomson about purchasing the Times. "
390,4," ""Operational synergies"" is a term used in the newspaper industry to refer to the economies of scale that can be achieved by 
combining functions or departments, including accounting, administration, press rooms, and composing departments. "
391,5," This clearly more effective way of doing business contrasted with the manner in which other prospective bidders were required 
to negotiate and bid. They were relegated to dealing through and with a Thomson employee much further down the chain-of-
command than the CEO. That is also the manner in which the CPI-WEHCO unsuccessful bid was made. "
392,6," In setting forth the standards that govern market definition, the court will utilize case law and the 1992 horizontal merger 
enforcement guidelines (""Merger Guidelines"") issued jointly by the two agencies with antitrust enforcement authority, the Justice 
Department and the Federal Trade Commission. 4Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) P 13,104. It is well-recognized that the Merger 
Guidelines do not have the force of law, see e.g. Olin Corp. v. FTC, 986 F.2d 1295, 1300 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 
114 S. Ct. 1051, 127 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1994), but many courts still cite them, and the expert testimony in this case shows that they 
represent mainstream economic thinking."
392,7," Cross-elasticity of demand refers to ""whether consumers will shift from one product to the other in response to changes in their 
relative costs."" SuperTurf, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 660 F.2d 1275, 1278 (8th Cir. 1981) (citations omitted). When products have 
""high cross-elasticity, it means that small changes in the price or quality of one product has dramatic effects on the sales of the 
other. When products have ""low"" cross-elasticity, it means that price and quality changes in one product causes little or no 
change in the sales of the other."
392,8," There can be no doubt as a matter of case law, the Merger Guidelines, and economic theory, that market constraints work not 
only to limit one's ability to raise prices above a competitive level, but also to limit one's ability to reduce quality or service below 
competitive levels. United States V. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 368-69, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963) 
(recognizing that competition can exist at many levels other than price); Merger Guidelines § 0.1, n. 6 (""Sellers with market 
power also may lessen competition on dimensions other than price, such as product quality, service, or innovation.""); Id. § 1.11 
(agency will consider buyer and seller ""response to relative changes in price or other competitive variables"") (emphasis added). "
393,9," In Brown Shoe, the practical indicia were meant to define a so-called ""submarket,"" which is to be contrasted with the ""broad 
product market."" But the emerging consensus of antitrust scholars and case law seems to be that the term ""submarket"" is 
unnecessary. Whether you call it a submarket or a broad product market, it is still the relevant market for antitrust purposes and 
must be marked by reasonable interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand. One approach, adopted by the Eighth Circuit, and described above, would simply do away with the term ""submarket"" and treat 
the ""practical indicia"" of Brown Shoe as types of evidence that establish the relevant market, whether it be a submarket or a 
broad product market. H.J., Inc. v. Internat'l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 867 F.2d 1531, 1540 (8th Cir. 1989) (""the same proof which 
establishes the existence of a relevant product market also shows (or . . . fails to show) the existence of a product submarket"") 
(citing Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 518.1 at 311-15 (1987 Supp.)); accord IIa Phillip E. Areeda, Herbert Hovenkamp 
& John L. Solow, Antitrust Law P 533a-g (1995). "
394,10," A slight increase is usually referred to as five or ten percent. All parties to the suit use the five to ten percent figure, but it 
should be noted that this figure does not appear in the Merger Guidelines. "
395,11," Defendants argue that there is no proof ""that the Court should exclude local television, radio, weekly newspapers, etc, from 
the relevant market for readers."" As the government notes, it is curious for defendants to suggest that television and radio are in 
""the relevant market for readers."" "
398,12," However, the government did present solid evidence that the two papers competed directly for legal advertising on at least 
one occasion. "
399,13," Prior to November 1994, the Morning News was actually two newspapers: the Northwest Arkansas Morning News based in 
Rogers and the Springdale Morning News based in Springdale. Both were owned by Donrey, which merged them. "
400,14," It is obviously good public policy that the guidelines be interpreted as consistently as possible with the case law which is 
binding. Steven A. Newborn & Virginia L. Snider, The Growing Judicial Acceptance of the Merger Guidelines, 60 Antitrust L.J. 
849, 851 (1992) (""if the Guidelines and the bench diverge, merger law would be forced into a morass of nonmerger analysis--a 
possibility as attractive as becoming involved in a land war in Asia""). "
403,15," Even if it were to be found that the relevant geographic market was the Fayetteville Metropolitan Area, as the government 
defines it, there would still clearly be a violation of Section 7 because the Times and the Morning News compete in that area, 
without question. Thus, the result would be the same with the possible exception of available remedies. If such a finding resulted 
in the remedy of rescission not being available, the court would employ what it believes to be the second best remedy under the 
facts of this case--divestiture. However, as Shearin is an advertiser in the Morning News, it is a consumer in the Fayetteville 
market and rescission would still be available on the basis of its standing in that market. See a discussion of these issues under 
Section X of this opinion. "
405,16," Actually, this court believes that even Bigelow required some proof that there was a threat of predatory or anticompetitive 
conduct. In Bigelow, a merger was presumptively illegal based on market share data, but on summary judgment, the district 
court held there was no evidence of a threat of antitrust injury ""absent some evidence of past instances of predatory pricing or 
present intent to engage in predatory behavior following the merger…."" Bigelow, 867 F.2d at 105. The court of appeals reversed 
since Lipton's 84% post-merger market share ""threatened to be decisive,"" giving Lipton the ability to engage in predatory 
conduct and ""eliminate competition in that market by, inter alia, reducing [plaintiff's] access to supermarket shelf space for its 
products."" Id. at 111. Bigelow has been criticized for holding that a threat of predation may be uncritically presumed from market 
share data. Facts other than market share must be known before a market can realistically be judged susceptible to predation. II 
Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp Antitrust Law P 373d2, 373d4 (Rev. ed. 1995); William H. Page and Roger D. Blair, 
Controlling the Competitor Plaintiff in Antitrust Litigation, 91 Mich. L. Rev. 111 (1992). Cargill, 107 S. Ct. at 494 n. 15 required a 
realistic threat of predation, and the court finds that facts indicating such a realistic threat are present in this case. "
406,17," While the court was impressed with the sincerity and honesty of Mr. Jack Stephens and every other witness from his 
organization who testified, the court is still left with the gnawing feeling that it is inevitable that someday, maybe sooner rather 
than later, the newspapers will be operated as one and the Northwest Arkansas Times will disappear from the scene just as two 
other venerable hometown papers, the Springdale News and the Rogers Daily News have disappeared under the Stephens 
family ownership. It simply makes economic sense, and humans, being the type of animal they are, almost always act in their 
own best interests. There appears to be little dispute but that the Times simply was not worth, as a stand-alone newspaper, what 
Jack Stephens paid for it. It is worth more if it is operated in conjunction with other Stephens owned papers in the area, so the 
court is certain that, sooner or later, that will happen irrespective of how sincere Mr. Stephens' present protestations to the 
contrary are. "

413,22," It appears that Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits monopolization and attempts to monopolize, has been applied 
even less frequently than Section 1 to mergers and acquisitions."
413,23," Thomson also argued that Section 7 did not reach the conduct of a seller. We held it was appropriate to grant relief against 
sellers if necessary to eliminate the effects of an unlawful acquisition. See United States v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 575 F.2d 222, 
227 (9th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 959, 99 S. Ct. 362, 58 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1978). See also United States v. E.I. du Pont de 
Nemours & Co., 366 U.S. 316, 326-31, 81 S. Ct. 1243, 6 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1961). "
417,24," Thomson argues that it would be punished if rescission is ordered because the current market conditions including the chilling 
effects of this lawsuit on the potential sale of the Times would result in it being unable to obtain fair market value in its attempt to 
sell the Times to another interested party. The court notes that this difficulty, if it is a difficulty, was created at least in part by 
Thomson's decision to speedily close a transaction which it knew was being challenged under the antitrust laws. "
418,25," NAT argues that there is little assurance that any bidders will come forward other than CPI and/or WEHCO. It notes that there 
were only four expressions of interest in the period of time the Times was on the market before NAT purchased the assets. only 
nineteen days elapsed between Thomson's public announcement of the sale and the closing of the sale. This allowed little time 
for other interested bidders to come forward. Further, the court notes that Harrington testified that the Times was held separate 
from the other group of 24 papers Thomson was selling because the Fayetteville market was much more promising than the 
market areas of the other 24 papers. "
425,1," This court will refer to Howard M. Addis, M.D., Howard M. Addis, M.D. Surgeon, Inc. and TJB Partnership collectively as

432,1," Since the hearing on the motions, plaintiffs have submitted applications for leave to file supplemental briefs accompanied by 
the supplemental briefs. Defendants have objected to plaintiffs' applications and have also submitted briefs in opposition to 
plaintiffs' supplemental briefs. The court does not find  [*2] good cause for allowing the supplemental briefs and sustains 
defendants' opposition to them. However, even if the briefs were considered, they would not change the outcome of this motion. "
433,2," Plaintiffs cite Texaco v. Hasbrouck, 496 U.S. 543, 110 S. Ct. 2535, 110 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1990) in support of their Cartwright 
claims. However, Hasbrouck is a price discrimination case under the Robinson Patman Act. Plaintiffs have not pleaded such a 
claim in the instant suit, and, therefore, the Hasbrouck discussion of what constitutes a legitimate functional discount is of no 
help in resolving the issues presented. "
435,3," Although plaintiffs offer the testimony of an expert economist to support their definition of the relevant market, this does not 
necessarily preclude  [*12] the court from finding lack of market power as a matter of law. See Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. 
v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 594, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (upholding trial court's finding that 
implausible economic claim and economic expert opinion had little probative value in comparison with court's own analysis of 
relevant factors). "
447,1," In fact, in a declaration submitted by Plaintiffs in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Dr. Michael Alexander 
claimed that Mull had told him Howerton and Antley had prevented him from obtaining privileges at Grace during the period 
when Blue Ridge provided services. Declaration of Michael S. Alexander, M.D., in Opposition to Defendants Grace 
Hospital's and Piedmont Medical Imaging's Motions for Summary Judgment, filed May 7, 1993. Mull, a competing 
radiologist, ultimately formed PMI. "
448,2," It appears that during the process of litigation, Blue Ridge has obtained access to MRI equipment."
448,3," The Court notes Plaintiffs' objection to the Magistrate Judge's finding of fact on this issue, but finds that Plaintiffs' evidence 
shows the fact as stated. "
449,4," Mull, a competing radiologist, alleged that he had been denied privileges at Grace while Blue Ridge had the exclusive 
arrangement for radiology. According to Plaintiffs' evidence, he was delighted at the opportunity to receive retribution. "
453,5, The initial 4-year period of the contract has terminated and the contract is renewable on a yearly basis.
453,6," Plaintiffs claim the fact that Mull later refused to forego nonexclusivity in order to allow Howerton and Antley to participate in 
inpatient services shows anticompetitive conduct. When a group of doctors approached Mull about this prospect, he declined. 
This occurred after the fact; that is, after Grace had already offered and entered into the exclusive contract with PMI. HN21[

454,7, The parties do not dispute there are no other facilities competing in the area.
454,8," The Court notes the declaration of John Andrews, another expert for Plaintiffs. Dr. Andrews opines that Blue Ridge did not 
have sufficient earnings to pay the average radiologist's salary in the southeast in 1991 and 1992, $ 237,000 and $ 250,000 per 
year, respectively. Many young businesses are not able to provide high salaries to their owners during the start up phase. That 
is not a ground upon which to base an antitrust action. Declaration of John J. Andrews, Ph.D., filed May 7, 1993. "

certain time in the future. The seller agrees to repurchase the same securities at a given time in the future at a price which 
determines the amount of interest for the use of the funds. In a reverse repo, the repo buyer delivers the funds and receives 
securities in exchange. At contract maturity the buyer receives sums, including interest and returns the securities. See 
Department of Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Joint 
Report on the Government Securities Market (""Joint Report""), Appendix A at A-11 (1992)."
459,2," Due to the use of repos, there is no limit to the quantity of securities in the aggregate that can be held ""long"" or ""short"" in the 
Treasury market. See Horowitz Aff. at P 4. "

472,1," For convenience, the term ""resident"" is used to refer to a person who was a shareholder and proprietary lessee of the Co-op 
Corporation."
472,2," The parties disagree about the amount of the increase. For example, plaintiffs allege that the conversion increased the market 
value of the Mouzon unit from $ 93,000 as a co-op to $ 118,000 as a condominium, and increased the market value of the 
Williams unit from $ 109,000 as a co-op to $ 145,000 as a condominium. Defendants point out that those values are only 
appraised estimates, and that these appraised values do not reflect or take into account the substantial marketing costs required 
to make sales. In any event, resolution of this dispute is not required for any of the conclusions reached in this opinion. "
473,3," Contrary to defendants' assertions, Falk's statements at the meeting are not inadmissible hearsay, at least as to some 
defendants, since Falk is both a party and an agent of the defendant corporations. See Rule 801(d)(2), Fed. R. Evid. In addition, 
the statements are not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted if they are introduced not to show that the Board initially 
intended to pay the units' condominium value, but instead merely to show that Falk misstated the plan's terms, giving rise to 
expectations on the part of plaintiffs that were not fulfilled. See Rule 801(c), Fed. R. Evid."
473,4," Defendants contend that they could not have received any unfair benefit from the fact that some shareholders did not purchase 
their units as condominiums because the Condominium Association had to assume significant debt to purchase the non-
participating units. Of course, the debt assumed would have been even greater had the Condominium Association paid a higher 
price for the non-participating units. "
474,5," For example, in Greenville Publishing, the panel held that the defendant newspaper company could be deemed to have 
conspired with its president to eliminate the plaintiff's competing newspaper because the president also had an interest in a third 
newspaper, one that would also have benefitted from elimination of the plaintiff's business. See 496 F.2d at 400."
474,6," The Co-op Corporation and the Condominium Association are not unrelated, independent entities. See infra note 8 and 
accompanying text. As a result, plaintiffs cannot persuasively argue that the directors could conspire with one of the defendant 
corporations because they had an independent personal stake in the other defendant corporation. Cf. Freeman v. Medevac 
MidAmerica of Kansas, Inc., 719 F. Supp. 1014, 1015 (D.Kan. 1989) (finding individual could conspire with two independent 
corporations, both of which he served as an officer)."

conspiracy), modified on other grounds, 821 F. Supp. 1213 (E.D.Mich. 1993)."
475,10," There is, for example, no allegation that the Condominium Association agreed to any limits on its future sale of the twenty-two 
units. In fact, defendants point out that the Condominium Association must sell the non-participating and defaulted units in order 
to retire the debt incurred to purchase them. "
476,11," See also Larry R. George Sales Co. v. Cool Attic Corp., 587 F.2d 266, 272 (5th Cir. 1979) (recognizing that Sherman Act 
""does not purport to afford remedies for all torts committed by or against persons engaged in interstate commerce"")."
476,12," Because plaintiffs' claim of conspiracy to monopolize is without merit for the reasons discussed, the Court need not reach 
defendants' additional arguments that the plaintiffs have improperly defined the relevant market as consisting only of twenty-two 
units in one apartment building, or that defendants' control of this market constituted a natural monopoly."

476,15," For the same reasons, plaintiffs' allegations concerning the rent charged to the non-participating shareholders after the 
conversion do not state a valid antitrust claim. "
477,16," Plaintiffs raised this allegation in memoranda and oral argument. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, the Court will construe 
the complaint's general antitrust claims as encompassing this allegation, as well."
477,17," Defendants have already submitted one affidavit which seems to indicate that plaintiffs' allegations are an inaccurate account 
of the facts. The Board's minutes indicate only that the ""exact amounts"" of the appraisals would not be publicized. According to 
defendants, there was no effort to suppress any information. The Board merely refrained from distributing a memorandum 
containing the target appraisal figures because it knew that the value of individual units might differ greatly from the target 
appraisals, and the Board did not want residents to be disappointed by failed attempts to market their units at prices near the 
target values. The appraisals were discussed at the Board's meeting and included in its minutes, both of which were open to the 
public. Moreover, the target appraisals were disclosed to the residents in time for them to sell their units prior to the conversion, 
which occurred in January 1995. Thus, the appraisals were made available to the shareholders at informational meetings in 
August 1994 and at the corporation's annual meeting in September 1994, and were published in an offering statement 
distributed to shareholders in connection with the conversion. In addition, defendants point out that the Board heavily 
emphasized to the shareholders at all times that the proposed conversion would benefit everyone by increasing the market value 
of the building's units. "
478,18," These statistics were not included in plaintiffs' complaint, but were submitted by defendants at the Court's direction. Plaintiffs 
have not challenged these figures."
478,19," These 92 units were owned by approximately 80 individuals, since some owned more than one unit for investment purposes. 
This fact, not taken into account in the standard deviation analysis discussed here, would marginally diminish the significance of 
the observed disparities."
478,20," Each party, not surprisingly, Presents the statistics in the light most favorable to it. For example, defendants emphasize that 
80% of African-American residents purchased their units, as opposed to approximately 97% of white residents. By contrast, 
plaintiffs prefer to state that 20% of African-American residents were left out of the conversion, as compared to only 3% of white 
residents. Alternatively, one might say that 8.3% of the building's residents were African-American, but 33.3% of those who did 
not participate in the conversion were African-American. The use of standard deviations to measure fluctuations from a predicted 
value is intended to eliminate the need to choose among these alternative, arguably deceptive, ways of characterizing the same 
underlying numbers. "
479,21," In several opinions, Judge Widener vigorously attacked the Fourth Circuit's failure to apply correct statistical principles, 
especially standard deviation analysis, in evaluating evidence of discrimination. In particular, he emphasized that statistical 
significance tests properly account for sample size. See Moultrie v. Martin, 690 F.2d 1078, 1083-84 & nn.7-10 (4th Cir. 1982); 
American Nat'l Bank, 680 F.2d at 967-69 nn.3-6 (dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). Yet, even following Judge 
Widener's analysis, it is impossible to conclude that a prima facie case has not been presented here, for the largest disparity in 
this case, 3.02 standard deviations, is significant at a 95% confidence level."
479,22," A standard deviation is a statistic used to measure the dispersion of a distribution from an expected value. For example, 
8.33% (10 out of 120) of the building's units were occupied by African-Americans. Thus, if 6 units in the building were not 
purchased as condominiums, one would expect that, on average and all other things being equal, 0.5 of these non-participating 
units would have been occupied by African-Americans. In fact, the actual number of such units occupied by African-Americans 
was 2. Standard deviation calculations are used to measure the significance of the difference between the expected value of 0.5 
and the observed value of 2. Courts applying standard deviation analysis in discrimination cases have typically used the formula 
for a binomial distribution. Yet, a true binomial distribution involves what is known as ""sampling with replacement."" See Freund & 
Simon, Modern Elementary Statistics 147, 183 (8th ed. 1992). This case, like most others, involves sampling from a finite pool 
without replacement. For example, if one had randomly selected one of the building's units, there was an 8.33% (10 out of 120) 
chance of picking the unit of an African-American resident. But if one had then randomly selected a second, different unit, the 
odds would have changed. If the first unit selected was occupied by African-Americans, the odds of selecting a second African-
American unit from the remaining pool would fall to 7.56% (9 out of 119). If an African-American unit was not selected first, the 
odds of selecting such a unit on the second try would rise to 8.40% (10 out of 119). On selecting a third unit, still different odds 
would apply. In other words, each ""trial"" or selection is not independent of the others, because units selected are not ""replaced"" 
into the pool and no unit can be selected twice. As a result, this case involves what is known as a hypergeometric distribution. 
See Lilly v. Harris-Teeter Supermarket, 720 F.2d 326, 336 n.18 (4th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 951, 80 L. Ed. 2d 539, 
104 S. Ct. 2154 (1984). HN12[
] The binomial distribution serves as a satisfactory approximation for the hypergeometric 
distribution where the number of ""trials"" is very small relative to the entire pool from which selections are made. See Freund & 
Simon, supra, at 191-93. In many discrimination cases, the pool is very large, such as all the potential jurors or employees in an 
entire city or county. Here, the pool consists of only 120 units. Thus, it is preferable here to use the formula for a hypergeometric 
distribution, which is: Variance = n"
479,*,  a * b
479,*,"  a + b - n (a + b) n 2 a + b - 1 where n equals the number of trials (the 6 non-participating units), a equals the number of items of one kind (the 10 units with 
African-American residents), and b equals the number of the remaining items in the pool (the 110 units with non-African- "
480,," American residents). See Freund & Simon, supra, at 209. The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance. In 
this example, the standard deviation is approximately 0.663. Thus, the difference between the expected value of 0.5 and the 
observed value of 2 is a span of approximately 2.26 standard deviations. Similar calculations result in disparities of 1.57 
standard deviations for Hispanic persons, and 2.26 standard deviations for disabled persons. The same analysis can be done for 
the combination of the three protected groups, namely African-American persons, Hispanic persons, and disabled persons. A 
total of 23 of the building's 120 units were occupied by persons within at least one of the three groups, while 4 of the 6 non-
participating units were occupied by a person in at least one of the groups. The calculation for the three groups in combination 
reveals a disparity of approximately 3.02 standard deviations."
480,23," Indeed, defendants' own arguments suggest that the disparity observed here is not random. They submit that the plan had a 
significant disparate impact, if at all, only because African-American, Hispanic, and disabled persons continue to suffer a general 
economic disadvantage in American society. Because they have less money and less access to credit, they were less likely to 
purchase condominiums during the conversion. Discrimination by lenders might also exist, further exacerbating the disparity, but 
these defendants would not be liable for that discrimination. Finally, defendants' argue, a Fair Housing Act violation cannot arise 
from a disparity attributable to this general statistical link between wealth and race, ethnicity, and handicap status. See Boyd v. 
Lefrak Org., 509 F.2d 1110, 1113 (2d Cir.) (""A businessman's differential treatment of different economic groups is not 
necessarily racial discrimination and is not made so because minorities are statistically overrepresented in the poorer economic 
groups.""), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 896, 46 L. Ed. 2d 129, 96 S. Ct. 197 (1975). Even assuming, arguendo, that defendants' 
premise is correct, that economic inequality was the sole cause of the asserted disparities, defendants are still not entitled to 
threshold dismissal of plaintiffs' claim. See Robinson v. 12 Lofts Realty, Inc., 610 F.2d 1032, 1037-38 n.10 (2d Cir. 1979) 
(rejecting Boyd's suggestion that Title VII's burden-shifting scheme does not apply under Fair Housing Act); Huntington Branch, 
NAACP v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 934 (2d Cir.), aff'd, 488 U.S. 15, 102 L. Ed. 2d 180, 109 S. Ct. 276 (1988); Tinsley 
v. Kemp, 750 F. Supp. 1001, 1010-11 (W.D.Mo. 1990). While these defendants ultimately may not be held liable under the Fair 
Housing Act for economic discrimination, HN13[
] the existence of a significant statistical disparity, even one resulting from 
economic inequality, is sufficient to create a prima facie case and shift the burden to the defendant to come forward with a 
legitimate business justification for the challenged practice. If the defendant succeeds, the burden shifts finally back to the 
plaintiff to prove that there was discrimination by showing that the proffered justification is pretextual. At that point, defendant 
must prevail if it appears that the disparity was attributable to economic inequality rather than impermissible discrimination. In 
sum, defendants' argument may ultimately prove to be dispositive, but it does not dispose of plaintiffs' claim at this stage."
480,24," In addition, defendants may respond to plaintiffs' allegation that they were charged exorbitant rents to continue living in the 
building during the six-month grace period following the conversion. "
481,25," HN17[
] The statute provides that, upon termination of a cooperative, ""the respective interests of proprietary lessees are the 
fair market values of their cooperative interests immediately before the termination."" Va. Code § 55-454(E)(1). Each side in this 
case interprets the word ""termination"" differently, and therefore each believes that the statute would support its position if 
applied. Defendants argue that the statute provides for valuation immediately prior to termination of cooperative ownership of the 
building, and so requires valuation of the units as cooperative apartments. Plaintiffs argue that the statute requires valuation 
immediately prior to termination, or dissolution, of the Co-op Corporation. By the time the Co-op Corporation was dissolved, the 
conversion to condominium ownership had occurred, and therefore plaintiffs contend that valuation of the units as condominiums 
was appropriate. It is unnecessary to resolve this dispute because the statute does not apply to this case. "
482,26," Plaintiffs' claim for breach of contract is essentially identical to their claim for breach of fiduciary duty, since it is based on the 
principle that shareholders' rights are contractual in nature. See Gaskill v. Gladys Belle Oil Co., 16 Del. Ch. 289, 146 A. 337, 339 
(Del.Ch. 1929) (""It is elementary that the rights of stockholders are contract rights."")."
482,27," This principle applies to all Delaware corporations by statute and case law. See Del.Code § 8-151(a), (d) (stock shall have 
only those preferences stated in, or adopted by resolution authorized by, certificate of incorporation); Grover v. Simmons (In re 
Sea-Land Corp. Shareholders Litig.), 642 A.2d 792, 799-803 (Del.Ch.) (discussing Delaware's ""rule of equality""), aff'd without 
published opinion, 633 A.2d 371 (Del. 1993). In addition, plaintiffs point to a provision in the Co-op Corporation's by-laws 
requiring that all shares receive a ratable portion of the corporation's assets in the event of dissolution."
482,28," It is important to note that the defendant corporations had no control over the shareholders' dealings with potential lenders. 
See Sea-Land, 642 A.2d at 803 (""To be chargeable with having violated a fiduciary duty involving equal treatment precepts, the 
board must at the very least have approved the transaction creating the disparity."")."
482,29," Thus, HN18[
] Delaware courts recognize that ""in some circumstances Delaware law permits shareholders (as distinguished 
from shares) to be treated unequally."" Sea-Land, 642 A.2d at 799 n.10. While the Co-op Corporation treated all shares equally, 
an inequality arose because of the shareholders' varying economic and credit status."
482,30," In September 1993, an amendment to the Co-op Corporation's by-laws provided the Board with discretion to implement a 
conversion plan in the shareholders' ""best interests"" subject to challenge only for bad faith. Yet, a by-law amendment surely 
cannot eliminate directors' fiduciary duty of loyalty and fairness to shareholders. See Del. Code tit. 8, § 102(b) (providing that 
certificate of incorporation may limit directors' personal liability, but may not waive liability for breach of duty of loyalty). "
483,31," The relevant considerations and methods for determining fair value have been set forth in numerous opinions. See, e.g., 
Baron v. Pressed Metals of America, Inc., 35 Del. Ch. 581, 123 A.2d 848 (Del. 1956); Alcott v. Hyman, 42 Del. Ch. 233, 208 
A.2d 501 (Del. 1965). It is important to note that the fair value of the units here was not necessarily the ""co-op value"" or the 
""condominium value."" While no rational purchaser would have paid more than the condominium value, reasonable parties to 
such a sale might well have negotiated a price somewhere in between so as to divide the benefits accruing from the sale."
483,32," HN20[
] An individual is ""interested"" in a sale transaction if she serves as a director, or shareholder, of both the selling and 
purchasing corporations. See Alcott, 208 A.2d at 505-06; Abelow v. Symonds, 40 Del. Ch. 462, 184 A.2d 173, 175 (Del.Ch. 
1962), aff'd sub nom., Abelow v. Midstates Oil Corp., 41 Del. Ch. 145, 189 A.2d 675 (Del. 1963). Here, disinterested director 
approval was impossible, because the two corporations involved had the same five directors. Similarly, at the time they voted on 
the conversion plan, the Co-op Corporation's shareholders intended later to become shareholders of the Condominium 
Association and, with the exception of plaintiffs and the other non-participating shareholders, they eventually did so. Thus, the 
majority of the selling corporation's shareholders had an expectant interest in the purchasing corporation, and their approval of 
the sale was not disinterested. Defendants have submitted evidence indicating that one of the plaintiffs, Julia Williams, voted in 
favor of the conversion plan. Had a majority of the non-participating shareholders voted in favor of the plan, it would be 
necessary to decide whether this constituted disinterested shareholder approval."
483,33," See Tri-Continental Corp. v. Battye, 31 Del. Ch. 523, 74 A.2d 71, 72 (Del. 1950) (recognizing that ""the basic concept of value 
under the appraisal statute is that the stockholder is entitled to be paid for that which was taken from him""); Chicago Corp. v.

of the corporate action unless exclusion would be inequitable""); ALI-ABA Model Business Corp. Act § 81(a)(3) (2d ed. 1969) 
(same)."
484,37," Authority other than Delaware case law, although meager, indicates that the principle applies in non-appraisal cases. See 
Perkins v. Public Serv. Co., 93 N.H. 459, 45 A.2d 210, 212-14 (N.H. 1945); Annotation, 48 A.L.R.3d at 451, § 4[a]; Annotation, 
38 A.L.R.2d at 450, § 4[b]. Delaware cases offer mixed signals on this point. Compare Sterling v. Mayflower Hotel Corp., 33 Del. 
Ch. 293, 93 A.2d 107, 111 (Del. 1952) (disregarding increased value of target corporation's stock attributable to attempted 
merger, where minority shareholders sued to enjoin allegedly unfair merger), with Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor, Inc., 63 
U.S.L.W. 2291, 1994 WL 568654, at *9 (Del.Ch. 1994) (noting, in suit for breach of fiduciary duty, that merger's terms reflected 
fair allocation of ""synergistic value"" arising from merger, without mentioning appraisal statute or suggesting Delaware law 
requires court to disregard such value in evaluating merger's fairness), and Tanzer v. International Gen. Indus. Inc., 402 A.2d 
382, 393-95 (Del.Ch. 1979) (suggesting that, while appraisal statute precludes dissenting shareholders from sharing in 
appreciation caused by merger, same rule does not apply in nonappraisal cases, but concluding evidence that merger increased 
company's value was too speculative to demonstrate merger's unfairness)."
484,38," On this question, authority from other states suggests that mergers and sales of assets are treated identically. Appraisal 
statutes in most states apply to both mergers and sales of assets, and therefore courts apply the same valuation principles to 
each. See, e.g., In re Clark's Will, 257 N.Y. 487, 178 N.E. 766, 768 (N.Y. 1931). Yet, Delaware's legislature and its courts have 
previously shown a unique propensity to distinguish mergers and sales of assets with regard to valuation and the rights of 
dissenting shareholders. For example, HN23[
] Delaware is one of the small minority of states where appraisal is generally not 
available after a sale of all or substantially all of a corporation's assets. See Del. Code tit. 8, § 262(c) (appraisal rights apply after 
sale of assets only if certificate of incorporation provides); Tanzer, 402 A.2d at 390-91 (appraisal rights generally not available 
for sale of assets). Moreover, Delaware courts have declined to find that a properly executed sale of assets may be treated as a 
""de facto merger"" to which appraisal rights extend. See Hariton v. Arco Elecs., Inc., 40 Del. Ch. 326, 182 A.2d 22, 26-27 
(Del.Ch. 1962), aff'd, 41 Del. Ch. 74, 188 A.2d 123 (Del. 1963); Heilbrunn v. Sun Chem. Corp., 38 Del. Ch. 321, 150 A.2d 755, 
757-59 (Del. 1959). More specifically, in two cases, Delaware courts have implied that where minority shareholders challenge a 
sale of assets, as opposed to a merger, valuation may take into account an increase in the assets' value that is attributable to 
the sale itself. See Sterling, 93 A.2d at 111-14 (holding that, upon a merger, minority shareholders are entitled to receive 
property substantially equivalent in value to what they had before the merger was proposed, but repeatedly emphasizing that 
case did not involve a sale of assets); Tanzer, 402 A.2d at 390-91 (discussing minority shareholders' argument that ""cash-out"" 
merger was unfair because it enabled majority shareholders to appropriate entire accession to company's value caused by 
merger, when alternative forms of same transaction, such as sale of assets, would have enabled minority shareholders to share 
accession)."
484,39," It is unclear whether Delaware law provides for any exception. One court has recognized that an exception exists where fraud 
is present. See Jones v. Missouri-Edison Elec. Co., 233 F. 49, 50 (8th Cir. 1916). A second possible exception exists for 
shareholders involuntarily excluded from the disputed merger or sale. A shareholder who opposes and elects not to participate in 
a transaction should neither share in the gain if the transaction increases the company's value, nor share in the loss if it has the 
opposite effect. See, e.g., In re West Waterway Lumber Co., 59 Wash. 2d 310, 367 P.2d 807, 810 (Wash. 1962). Yet, this 
reasoning does not apply to shareholders who have no choice whether to participate. Thus, appraisal statutes in many states 
expressly provide that the increased value of a corporation arising from a sale or merger is not excluded from valuation if ""such "
485,," exclusion would be inequitable."" See, e.g., Colo. Rev. Stat. § 7-113-101(4); Idaho Code § 30-1-81(a) (3); N.H. Rev. Stat. § 293-
A:13.01(3); S.D. Codified Laws § 47-6-40(3); Va. Code § 13.1-729. Although this proviso has received little judicial interpretation, 
the commentary to the Model Business Corporation Act indicates that it aims to distinguish a minority shareholder ""excluded 
against his will,"" such as by a ""squeeze-out"" merger, from one who willingly ""refuses to maintain a continuing interest"" in the 
corporation after the merger or sale. See Conrad, Amendments of Model Business Corporation Act Affecting Dissenters' Rights 
(Sections 73, 74, 80, and 81), 33 Bus. Law. 2587, 2601 (1978). Here, plaintiffs do not fit neatly into either category, for the 
corporation invited them to participate in the conversion by buying their units as condominiums, but they were excluded by their 
inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms."
485,40," Although not alleged in their complaint, plaintiffs have cited one additional manner in which the defendants allegedly breached 
their fiduciary duties, namely by their suppression of certain target appraisals of the units' value as condominiums. See supra 
Part II.D. If privy to the target appraisals, plaintiffs argue, they could have sold their Co-op Corporation stock prior to the 
conversion at a price higher than the stock's ""co-op value."" Plaintiff may seek to add this allegation to their complaint by 
amendment, and, if so, defendants may test the presence of factual support for it by way of motion for summary judgment. See 
supra note 17."
485,41," See Del. Const. art. IV, § 11(9); Del. Supreme Court Rule 41(a)(ii); Rales v. Blasband, 626 A.2d 1364 (Del. 1993). "
489,1," Actually, Allied had taken over VASP in 1986 and therefore was the named defendant in the first action. However, this 
distinction is immaterial for this brief recitation of the background."
489,2," The parties dispute whether VIL assigned this know-how to Enprotech or merely licensed it. That argument will be addressed 
infra."
489,3," Verson claims that VIL's arguments are merely ""rehashed"" from its memorandum in opposition to Verson's motion for 
reconsideration and to amend its complaint, and that we rejected these arguments in granting Verson leave to amend its 
complaint. However, in allowing Verson to amend its complaint we did not rule on any of the arguments VIL advances here. 
Rather, our opinion focused exclusively on whether we should allow Verson to amend its complaint to present a different theory 
of recovery, and we concluded that Verson should have a second chance to present a cognizable claim. Verson has attempted 
to do so and VIL is now free to attack the complaint. "
490,4," Specifically, the settlement agreement stated: Allied agrees not to seek the return or to restrict the use of any know-how which it or its predecessor has transmitted to VIL, 
or which may be transmitted to VIL under this Settlement (collectively, the ""Transmitted Know-How""). Allied hereby waives 
all claims and defenses relating to VIL's entitlement to the possession or use of the Transmitted Know-How."
490,5," Although VIL at one point argued that a mutual release signed by the parties in 1991 bars the action here, it has since made 
clear that it has abandoned that claim and instead focuses solely on the 1990 settlement. "
492,6," The Farmland decision explicitly relied on state law to answer the question presented. In that the later federal cases hold that 
the assignability of patent licenses is a question of federal law, see Unarco, 465 F.2d at 1306, VIL's reliance on Farmland may 
be misplaced. "
493,7," Indeed, were VIL correct, the long-established federal rule against the implied right to assign patent licenses, see Unarco 
Industries Inc., 465 F.2d at 1306, would open every patent holder to an antitrust lawsuit."
493,8," Although the Supreme Court in Waterman v. Mackenzie, 138 U.S. 252, 34 L. Ed. 923, 11 S. Ct. 334 (1981) created a three-part 
test to determine whether a patentee has assigned or licensed his right for the purposes of determining who may sue for patent 
infringement, neither party argues that the Waterman test should be employed here. In that the only issue addressed by 
Waterman is whether the plaintiff had standing, we agree that rigid application of that case here would be inappropriate. "
494,9," Although the parties are delineated as ""Licensor"" and ""Licensee,"" and the agreement is denominated a ""License,"" these HN6[ ] labels are not dispositive of our inquiry here. Waterman, 138 U.S. at 255. Rather, the focus should be on the substantive rights conferred by the agreement. Id."
494,10," Deciding this issue as a matter of law is even less appropriate when considering the language used in the Enprotech 
agreement. In the agreement VIL ""assigns"" to Enprotech its intellectual property and ""sells"" to it the know-how. This language is 
much more consistent with an assignment than with a transfer of a mere license. Indeed, the Federal Circuit has held that HN7[ ] ""the term 'assignment' has a particular meaning in patent law implying formal transfer of title."" Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG,"
494,944," F.2d at 875. Moreover, in the agreement, VIL warrants that it has good title to the know-how and is free to assign it. Again, 
this provision is more consistent with an assignment than a license. "

504,7," The Court reaches the same conclusion whether it examines the complaint, accepting as true all well pleaded facts, or whether 
it construes plaintiffs' evidence in the most favorable light. There appears to be some tension concerning the proper procedural 
posture for the antitrust standing inquiry. For example, in Rooney, the learned judge stated that standing is determined from the 
complaint, but went on to conclude that plaintiffs had not adduced sufficient evidence on the standing issue to withstand 
summary judgment. 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7420 at *16-18; see also BCB Anesthesia Care, Ltd. v. Passavant Memorial Area 
Hosp. Ass'n, 36 F.3d at 669 (dissenting opinion by Cudahay, J., criticizing the majority for upholding dismissal on the pleadings 
alone). The Court finds that adequate discovery took place in the instant case to determine standing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f)."

rate-making related activities which assist insurers writing workers' compensation business. In Alabama, NCCI also serves 
as the Administrator of the Workers' Compensation Insurance Plan, the state-approved and regulated structure by which 
Alabama employers unable to obtain workers' compensation insurance in the voluntary market can apply for and obtain 
such insurance."

]  28 U.S.C. § 1441 (1994) states: (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district 
courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district 
court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending. For purposes of 
removal under this chapter, the citizenship of defendants sued under fictitious names shall be disregarded. (b) Any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under the 
Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States shall be removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the 
parties. Any other such action shall be removable only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as 
defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought. "
533,4," It has been argued that artful pleading applies whenever the plaintiff is deliberately trying to deny the defendant federal court 
jurisdiction. This overly broad interpretation of the exception of artful pleading directly contradicts the doctrine that the plaintiff is 
the master of his or her complaint and may deliberately choose to base the claims on state law. See King Provision Corp. v. 
Burger King Corp., 750 F. Supp. 501, 505-06 & nn.3-5 (M.D. Fla. 1990). See generally 14A Charles A. Wright et al., Federal

preempt Illinois antitrust laws, the court looked at the merits of the case, decided that the commerce activity alleged in the 
complaint was interstate, and ruled that Illinois law was inapplicable ""although neither of the parties have cited any law on this 
point and the Court has found no law on this point . . . ."" Mechanical Rubber, 747 F. Supp. at 1295-96. The case has been

535,7," The remand in In re Romulus was not based on § 1441 or § 1447, but rather the district court followed United Mine Workers v.

risks, thus sharing in the risks of the insurance. Id. at P6. NCCI's employee, William Vieweg, is the Administrator for National 
Pool. "
539,11," If Alabama law is considered controlling, the outcome would be the same. The court has found neither a statutory definition 
nor a case law definition of unincorporated association in Alabama. From this, the court infers that the common law definition 
remains in effect. See, e.g., Gulf South Conference v. Boyd, 369 So. 2d 553, 555 (Ala. 1979) (the Gulf South Conference is 
an unincorporated association composed of nine colleges and universities with a stated purpose and a self-imposed government

League of Women Voters] is a non-profit, unincorporated association, the general purpose of which is to promote political 
responsibility.""). National Pool is an unincorporated association under the common law definition. "
544,1," Because the Cartwright Act has objectives identical to the federal antitrust acts, the California courts look to cases construing 
the federal antitrust laws for guidance in interpreting the Cartwright Act. ( Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal. 3d 311, 320 [216 
Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58]; Partee v. San Diego Chargers Football Co. (1983) 34 Cal. 3d 378, 382 [194 Cal.Rptr. 367, 668 P.2d

Bowl-O-Mat, Inc. (1977) 429 U.S. 477, 489 [50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 712-713, 97 S. Ct. 690]. Yet, in Associated General Contractors 
the Supreme Court clarified that the nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury is but one of several factors to be considered. "
545,3," In light of our decision we find it unnecessary to reach the argument raised in Waste Management's supplemental brief that 
plaintiff is collaterally estopped from proceeding with his state court action because his lawsuit filed in federal court was 
dismissed. The requests for judicial notice of the federal court proceedings are denied. "
555,1," Datagate's standing to sue under the antitrust laws is not at issue in this appeal. HP did not contend before the district court 
that Datagate had not suffered causal antitrust injury. HN6[
] Unlike Article III standing, the question of standing to sue under 
the antitrust laws does not go to subject matter jurisdiction, and thus need not be considered sua sponte. See Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d 
at 1433 (question of causal antitrust injury goes to scope of protection afforded by antitrust laws). "
558,2," Datagate argues that, even if there is a ""multiple purchaser"" requirement, it presented evidence sufficient to create a disputed 
issue of material fact regarding more than a single tying arrangement. As we have concluded that Datagate's tie-in claim 
survives summary judgment on the basis of the disputed issues of material fact concerning the alleged Rockwell tying 
arrangement, we need not address Datagate's alternative argument. "
564,1," The following excerpts from Plaintiff's Complaint illustrate this point. Plaintiff asserts that ""defendant in its capacity as a 
commercial disseminator of information is under a duty as a licensee of public utilizes [sic] in the nature of a monopoly for that 
purpose not to deprive plaintiff of her right to freedom of speech."" (Complaint P 5.) Plaintiff believes that she has a First 
Amendment right to ""deliver[] information"" to the defendant. (Complaint P 3.) She claims that when she ""protested the denial of 
her constitutional right to publicize the protected racketeering practiced by the defendant,"" she was ""required to leave the 
building and the information was withheld from dissemination."" (Complaint P 6.) "
566,2," Because Plaintiff did not suffer any injury as a result of a predicate racketeering act by Defendant, she also lacks standing 
under RICO. See Hecht v. Commerce Clearing House, Inc., 897 F.2d 21, 25 (2d Cir. 1990) (plaintiff found to lack standing 
because act of discharging an employee was not predicate racketeering act; ""standing may be founded only upon injury from 
overt acts that are also section 1961 predicate acts, and not upon any and all overt acts furthering a RICO conspiracy."")."
566,3," Plaintiff apparently believes that a conspiracy against ""whistleblower"" teachers exists between the New York City Board of 
Education, the United Federation of Teachers and the New York City Corporation Counsel's Office. See Complaint PP 4, 7. 
Conclusory allegations of conspiracy are insufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See San Filippo v. U.S. Trust 
Co. of New York, 737 F.2d 246, 256 (2d Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1035, 105 S. Ct. 1408, 84 L. Ed. 2d 797 (1985); 
Ostrer v. Aronwald, 567 F.2d 551 (2d Cir. 1977) (per curiam); Srubar v. Rudd, Rosenberg, Mitofsky & Hollender, 875 F. 
Supp. 155, 159 (S.D.N.Y. 1994)."
566,4," I note that Plaintiff was suspended from her job as a teacher many years before the incident with Defendant which is described 
in the Complaint. Any economic harm Plaintiff suffered as a result of losing her employment is unconnected to the harm she is 
alleged to have suffered as a result of Defendant's failure to listen to or print her story, and was the subject of separate litigation, 
initiated almost twenty years ago, against the New York City Board of Education and various psychiatrists. See, e.g., Newman v. 
Board of Education of City School Dist. of New York, 594 F.2d 299 (2d Cir. 1979); Newman v. Board of Education of City School 
Dist. of New York, 508 F.2d 277 (2d Cir. 1974); Newman v. deSola Pool, No. 78 Civ. 1088, LEXIS GENFED Library, DIST File

the damages by him sustained and the cost of suit, including reasonable attorney's fees."""
567,6," The Court assumes that Plaintiff intends this word to be ""utilities."" "
568,7," In addition, Plaintiff has failed to plead any facts which could even suggest the existence of any federally cognizable claim 
under the United Nations Charter. "
577,1," The action against Frank P. Crivello and Crivello Investments has been stayed pursuant to § 362 of the United States 
Bankruptcy Code, as the result of their filing under Chapter 11 of the Code. "
578,2," The trial court dismissed the claim under § 134.01, STATS., because it believed that the violation of an underlying legal right 
was required (relying on our statement in Century Shopping Center Fund I v. Crivello, 156 Wis.2d 227, 239, 456 N.W.2d 858, 
864 (Ct. App. 1990), that there is no violation of § 134.01 ""unless a legal right has been invaded"") and that Howell Plaza had no "
579,," legal right to compel the Sentry defendant to operate a food store at the shopping center. Our statement in Century Shopping 
Center Fund, however, was predicated on our holding to that effect in Maleki v. Fine-Lando Clinic Chartered, S.C., 154 
Wis.2d 471, 481-486, 453 N.W.2d 208, 212-214 (Ct. App. 1990). The supreme court overruled our decision in Maleki on this 
point.  Maleki v. Fine-Lando Clinic Chartered, S.C., 162 Wis.2d 73, 91-95, 469 N.W.2d 629, 636-638 (1991). The supreme 
court's decision in Maleki thus also overruled, sub silentio, its own decision on this point in Cranston v. Bluhm, 33 Wis.2d 192, 
198-200, 147 N.W.2d 337, 340-341 (1967), which it did not cite and which held that a conspiracy claim based on the closing of a 
theater for six months was properly dismissed when there was ""no affirmative requirement in the lease that the theatre [sic] be 
operated at least six months in any lease year."""
579,3," HN7[
] RULE 802.09(3), STATS., provides: RELATION BACK OF AMENDMENTS. If the claim asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the transaction, 
occurrence, or event set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date 
of the filing of the original pleading. An amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted relates back if the 
foregoing provision is satisfied and, within the period provided by law for commencing the action against such party, the 
party to be brought in by amendment has received such notice of the institution of the action that he or she will not be 
prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits, and knew or should have known that, but for a mistake concerning the 
identity of the proper party, the action would have been brought against such party."
579,4," As Northwest Power Products explains: HN8[
] ""An instance where the result of antitrust law and unfair competition law enforcement may not conflict is when a firm with substantial market power, perhaps approaching that of a monopoly, uses unfair competition to augment its 
position by eliminating a rival concern from the market. But it is the elimination of the competition, by fair means or foul, that 
is the concern of the antitrust law, and it is only the unfair method on which the law of unfair competition focuses."" Id., 576 F.2d at 89 (emphasis added). See also Grams v. Boss, 97 Wis.2d 332, 347, 294 N.W.2d 473, 481 (1980) (""Allegations 
that the defendants conspired or combined to engage in acts of unfair competition with intent to injure or destroy the plaintiff as a 
competitor"" state an antitrust-violation claim under § 133.03(1), STATS.). "
580,5," The per se doctrine is a broad-bladed sword, unable to make distinctions with any precision. It is pressed into service by the 
dual engine of instinct and necessity. It spares victims of presumed inherently pernicious practices the burden of demonstrating 
the market impact of those practices, which would be required under the so-called ""rule of reason,"" because adverse market 
impact is assumed. See Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 7-8, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 (1979); Northern 
Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958). Membership criteria for this club of 
convenience, however, is strict: the practice must threaten the ""central nervous system of the economy."" United States v. 
Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 224 n.59, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940). As we have already noted, the antitrust 
laws protect competition not competitors. See Northwest Power Products, Inc. v. Omark Industries, Inc., 576 F.2d 83, 88-90 
(5th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1116, 59 L. Ed. 2d 75, 99 S. Ct. 1021; Mid-West Underground Storage, Inc. v. Porter, 
717 F.2d 493, 497 (10th Cir. 1983). The per se rule's rationale has weakened as markets have expanded and the tools with 
which to compete in those market have become more efficient. Frank H. Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 1, 
19 (1984). Accordingly, there has been a retrenchment from the rigidity of the per se rule, see, e.g., National Collegiate 
Athletic Ass'n v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984); Copperweld Corp. v.

to assume the greater regulatory burden, Easterbrook, 63 Tex. L. Rev. at 29. "
581,6," In its brief and on oral argument, the Sentry defendant focussed on Juster Associates v. City of Rutland, 901 F.2d 266 (2nd 
Cir. 1990), as, in the Sentry defendant's view, requiring affirmance of the trial court's dismissal of the antitrust claims. In Juster, 
a shopping center owner complained because the City of Rutland ""subsidized or otherwise aided"" the developers of a competing 
shopping center--thus increasing competition in the relevant market, id., 901 F.2d at 269; here, on the other hand, Century 
complains that the defendants have conspired to destroy, not help, a competitor--thus decreasing competition. Juster 
recognized that ""increased competition and reduced profits resulting from an agreement between other parties does not 
constitute an antitrust injury."" Ibid. Juster is wholly inapplicable. "

At the trial, evidence may be given of any such unlawful damage that was committed on or between the dates alleged. (5) The department of natural resources shall maintain a registry of prominent features in the landscape of state-owned

584,12," Inasmuch as we have reversed the trial court's dismissal of the complaints, we do not reach the issue of whether the trial court 
erred in denying leave to the plaintiffs to replead. See Gross v. Hoffman, 227 Wis. 296, 300, 277 N.W. 663, 665 (1938) (only 
dispositive issue need be addressed). "
589,1," Plaintiff also asserts violations of New York State antitrust law, N.Y. G. B. L. § 340, (the ""Donnelly Act""), and a common law 
claim for tortious interference with contract. "
590,2," Further tying allegations through which plaintiff implicates the horsemen's associations' consent power, allegedly exercised in 
violation of antitrust include: 1) that the SBOA-NY threatened management at Yonkers raceway that they would withdraw their 
consent to interstate simulcasting from Yonkers if Yonkers proceeded to simulcast in-state to Saratoga. Saratoga is now unable 
to receive simulcasts from Yonkers; and 2) that defendants caused the horsemen's association at Vernon Downs to exercise a 
contractual provision to withhold their consent to simulcasting of Vernon's races to Saratoga."
590,3," SBOA-NJ offers no basis for the Court to reconsider its earlier determination that assertion of personal jurisdiction over these 
defendants would not offend due process. See Omni Capital Int'l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 104-105, 108 S. Ct. 
404, 98 L. Ed. 2d 415 (1987); Mareno v. Rowe, 910 F.2d 1043, 1046 (2d Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1028, 112 L. Ed. 2d 
673, 111 S. Ct. 681 (1991) HN1[

domiciliary to jurisdiction federal courts must consider both the state statutory basis for jurisdiction and whether application of 
that statutory jurisdiction comports with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment). "
591,4," As the Sixth Circuit recently held, HN6[
] ""One permissible interpretation of the Act suggests that a racetrack obtain the 
horsemen's consent during regular contract negotiations with the trade association that the horsemen choose to represent them; 
if a racetrack did not previously negotiate with a representative trade association, the racetrack would be required to obtain the 
consent directly from the owners."" Kentucky Division of the Horsemen's Benevolent Assoc. v. Turfway Park, 20 F.3d 1406 (6th 
Cir. 1994). "
592,5," Defendant places particular emphasis on this sentence as evidence that it never contractually negotiated for or consented to 
simulcasting. In the Court's, view, however, this sentence simply establishes that execution of the instant agreement is not of 
itself consent to simulcasting: consent must be further sought and granted under the contractual consent terms which follow. 
Nothing in this sentence, however, precludes SBOA-NJ from exercising their power to consent in the future under this contract."
592,6," With Monticello Raceway, Vernon Downs, Yonkers Racetrack, Batavia Downs, Buffalo Raceway, and the Capital District and 
Nassau County OTBs, all in New York. (DeSantis Aff. Ex. A, B)."
592,7," In a footnote SBOA-NJ argues that under the Court's analysis, by entering into contracts with New Jersey racetracks wherein 
they do not consent to interstate simulcasting, they could be found to have contracted to provide simulcasting services in each of 
the 50 states. Of course this does not follow: it is only where SBOA-NJ consents to simulcasting into a state according to their 
own contractual consent provision, and participates in that simulcasting and the proceeds therefrom under the negotiated explicit 
terms of their contract with the New Jersey race tracks, that they can be found to have contracted to provide simulcasting 
services for that state's jurisdictional purposes. "
594,8," Although the Court did not reach the question in its original decision from the bench, upon review of the briefing and filings on 
the original motion as well as plaintiff's response to the motion for reconsideration, the Court has little doubt that personal 
jurisdiction is likewise proper under N.Y. Civ. Prac. L. & R. § 302(a)(3)(ii), under an analysis similar to that conducted in 
Broadcasting Rights 675 F. Supp. at 1445-46. See Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Medicine, 802 F. Supp. 912, 919 
(W.D.N.Y. 1992) (""An action alleging violations of antitrust laws is a claim for injuries sustained, and therefore is in the nature of 
a tort and long-arm jurisdiction would apply.""); Harrison Conference Services, Inc. v. Dolce Conference Services, Inc., 768 F.

gave the following statement: Before closing, there is one additional area I'd like to discuss. (Pause) No doubt due to the recessionary economy, some suppliers and numerous other companies have increased their efforts to 
secure a portion of your parts orders. Some Caterpillar dealers are utilizing, to varying degrees, these alternative sources. You may be thinking, ""this doesn't apply to us."" You might be surprised. Some well-intentioned employee may have found 
what appears to be a cheaper source for a few parts such as seals, hardware, electrical components, or friction material. 
This employee probably feels it's the same as Caterpillar supplies, but costs less. Perhaps your company is one of the 
Caterpillar dealers who has taken on a line of filters to supplement our line. You may find that in certain cases, the other 
line gets substituted for Caterpillar because ""that's what the customer wants."" These examples and others are starting to 
happen all too frequently, even though you may fully intend to totally represent Caterpillar, as your agreement requires. "

] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any 
contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and 
on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding one million dollars if a corporation, or if any other person, 
one hundred thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the 
discretion of the court."
619,15," U.S.C. § 1 (1985). The punishments provided for in this provision were increased by amendment in 1990. See Antitrust 
Amendments Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-588, § 4(a), 104 Stat. 2879, 2880 (1990) (now codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1). The 
amended provisions are not applicable to the instant complaint."
619,92," Section 3 of the Clayton Act provides as follows: HN10[
] It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a 
sale or contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities . . . or fix a price charged 
therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement or understanding that the lessee or 
purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies or other commodities of a 
competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, 
agreement or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of 
commerce."
619,15, U.S.C. § 14 (1985).
619,93," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides, in pertinent part, as follows: "
620,," (a) Amount of recovery; prejudgment interest. . . . Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason 
of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue there for . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, 
and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The court may award under this section, pursuant to a motion by 
such person promptly made, simple interest on actual damages for the period beginning on the date of service of such 
person's pleading setting forth a claim under the antitrust laws and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period 
therein, if the court finds that the award of such interest for such period is just in the circumstances. In determining whether 
an award is just in the circumstances, the court shall consider only -- (1) whether such person or the opposing party, or either party's representative, made motions or asserted claims or 
defenses so lacking in merit as to show that such party or representative acted intentionally for delay, or otherwise 
acted in bad faith; (2) whether, in the course of the action involved, such person or the opposing party, or either party's representative, 
violated any applicable rule, statute, or court order providing for sanctions for dilatory behavior or otherwise providing 
for expeditious proceedings; and (3) whether such person or the opposing party, or either party's representative, engaged in conduct primarily for the 
purpose of delaying the litigation or increasing the cost thereof."
620,15, U.S.C. § 15 (1985).
620,94," Section 15 of the Clayton Act provides, in pertinent part, as follows: Injunctive relief for private parties; exception; costs. Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United 
States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, . . . when 
and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage 
is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, and upon the execution of proper bond against 
damages for an injunction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, 
a preliminary injunction may issue. . . . In any action under this section in which the plaintiff substantially prevails, the court 
shall award the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee, to such plaintiff."
620,15, U.S.C. § 26 (1985). 
623,95," See also Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at 723 (""Per se rules are appropriate only for conduct that is manifestly 
anticompetitive""); Lie, 964 F.2d at 569 (""[A per se violation involves an] agreement[] whose nature and necessary effect [is] so 
plainly anticompetitive, no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish its illegality""); National Soc'y of Professional 
Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978); National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Bd. of 
Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 103-104, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1977) (""Per se rules are invoked when 
surrounding circumstances make the likelihood of anticompetitive conduct so great as to render unjustified further examination of 
the challenged conduct.""). "
624,96," Even if the prices have been increased to some degree, this fact only aids the plaintiff's competitive position with consumers. 
The higher the prices that Caterpillar charges for its parts, the more likely the consumer will shop elsewhere (i.e., look to 
Caterpillar's competitors)."
624,97," The Smith Machinery scenario is not the typical vertical restraint because competitors can still sell their products to the dealer, 
while they arguably cannot in the instant case. See Smith Machinery, 878 F.2d at 1295 n.5 (""In this particular case, the alleged 
line forcing might better be termed a vertical 'arrangement' rather than 'restraint' since Smith was not prohibited from carrying the 
product lines of competitors as it would be under an exclusive dealing arrangement, the classic 'vertical restraint.'""). 
Nevertheless, the Tenth Circuit's analysis is still relevant here, and its relevance is demonstrated by the applicability of the Smith 
Machinery analysis to the Taylor case which is very similar to this case. In Taylor, the dealer was prohibited from buying patty 
paper from Hollymatic's competitors like the dealers in this case; a typical vertical non-price restraint. Yet, despite that difference 
between Smith Machinery and Taylor, Taylor was still decided on the same basis and consistent with the same principles as 
Smith Machinery. Therefore, the fact that this case is distinguishable from Smith Machinery in to Caterpillar dealers does not 
undermine the relevancy of the Smith Machinery analysis to this case."
624,98," See Taylor, 28 F.3d at 1384 (""It [the agreement between Taylor and Hollymatic] was in effect an exclusive-dealing agreement 
in which Hollymatic required Taylor to sell Hollymatic, and only Hollymatic, patty paper."")."
624,99," This court is not convinced that even typical tying arrangements should be subject to per se analysis and would likely agree 
with Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in Jefferson Parish. See Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. 2, 34-35 (O'Connor, J. 
concurring) (arguing in favor of abandoning per se test for tying arrangements and applying rule of reason analysis instead). 
However, the law in its current form retains quasi-per se treatment for some tying claims. See infra pp. 18-19. "
625,100," Caterpillar dealers have not completely stopped purchasing non-genuine parts. Many dealers still use such parts in 
emergency situations and others still use them on occasion. See e.g., Blake Quinn Aff. (Dealer principal of Quinn Co., a 
California Caterpillar dealership) (noting dealership's policy of using non-genuine parts on occasion if the part is unavailable from 
Caterpillar, if a customer requests a non-genuine part on a particular job, or due to price considerations). It is notable that Volpp 
has not been completely cut out of the Caterpillar dealership ""mini-market,"" and Caterpillar has never terminated a dealership for 
stocking non-genuine parts. "
626,101," The Sales and Service Agreement between Caterpillar and its dealers contains no provision that expressly requires the 
purchase of replacement parts in order to also buy Caterpillar equipment. Plaintiff alleges, however, that the contract's mandate "
627,," to ""adequately promote the sale of Caterpillar products"" and its provision that dealer affiliation with other organizations that are 
""substantial operator[s] of products"" would adversely affect that obligation to promote Caterpillar products, amounts to the 
express conditioning necessary to set out a tying arrangement. Such strong language, although indicative of Caterpillar's serious 
commitment to regaining lost sales of replacement parts, is not an express tie. There is nothing in the language of the 
agreement that absolutely requires Caterpillar dealers to stock only genuine parts. For that reason, plaintiff cannot prove that an 
express tying agreement between Caterpillar and its dealers exists."
627,102," Commentators have recognized that Jefferson Parish limited the scope of the per se rule. See e.g., Daniel E. Lazaroff, 
Reflections of Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc.: Continued Confusion Regarding Tying Arrangements and 
Antitrust Jurisprudence, 69 Wash. L. Rev. 101, 114 (1994) (""The shift in the Supreme Court's general attitude regarding tying 
arrangements became strikingly evident in Jefferson Parish Hospital District No.2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 
1551 (1984). In Hyde, four justices concurred with a five justice majority and specifically called for a repudiation of any per se 
approach to tie-ins. These four justices were, in essence, calling for rule of reason treatment of tie-ins as just another non-price 
vertical restraint. Even the majority, which did not wish to repudiate the per se approach, severely limited its applicability.""). "
628,103," The court will not discuss each individual act of alleged ""coercion,"" but the typical instances reflect the type of conduct alleged 
and suffice to explain the court's conclusion. "
629,104," The court notes that plaintiff has not provided any testimony from the more than 70 dealer principals that plaintiff claims were 
coerced. Instead, plaintiff focused its discovery on low-level employees in dealer parts departments even though plaintiff's expert 
conceded the relevance of dealer testimony on the issue of coercion. Kyler Tr. 463, Ex. 89. "
630,105," Because the court has already held that no unlawful tying arrangement exists in this case, it need not reach the antitrust injury 
or damages issues."
630,106," Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-25-101 provides as follows: HN22[
] All arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations made with a 
view to lessen, or which tend to lessen, full and free competition in the importation or sale of articles imported into this state, "
631,," or in the manufacture or sale of articles of domestic growth or of domestic raw material, and all arrangements, contracts, 
agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations designed, or which tend to advance, reduce, or 
control the price or the cost to the producer or the consumer of any such product or article, are declared to be against 
public policy, unlawful and void."
631,107," Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-25-106 provides as follows: HN23[
] Any person who may be injured or damaged by any such arrangement, contract agreement, trust, or 
combination, described in this part may sue for and recover, in any court of competent jurisdiction, of any person operating 
such trust or combination, the full consideration or sum paid by him for any goods, wares, merchandise, or articles, the sale 
of which is controlled by such combination or trust. "
632,108," The court further notes that even if Tennessee law applied, plaintiff's claim for intentional interference with prospective 
economic advantage would fail because that tort has never been recognized by the Tennessee courts. See Chilton Air Cooled 
Engines, Inc. v. Omark Indus., Inc., 721 F. Supp. 151, 156 (M.D. Tenn. 1988) (finding that Tennessee has not developed any 
case law concerning interference with prospective business relations). Although the Tennessee courts have never expressly 
rejected such a cause of action, quality Auto Parts v. Bluff City Buick, 876 S.W.2d 818, 823-24 (Tenn. 1994) (""We conclude that 
the question of whether Tennessee law recognizes the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage 
should be postponed to another day""), this court declined to create a cause of action for interference with economic advantage 
in Valley Prods. Co., Inc. v. Landmark, 877 F. Supp. 1087, 1994 WL 772307 (W.D. Tenn. 1994). Because such a claim does not 
presently exist under Tennessee law, this court would once again decline to create a cause of action that has never before been 
recognized. See Chilton Air, 721 F. Supp. at 156 (dismissing claim because ""Tennessee has not recognized tort of interference 
with prospective business relations.""). "

sufficient volume of photofinishing work so as to make a captive lab cost-effective. "
640,3," The Court discussed a number of situations that may constitute a showing of changed circumstances, including: where 
changed factual conditions make compliance with the decree ""substantially more onerous""; where the decree proves unworkable 
because of unforeseen obstacles; or where enforcement of the decree would be detrimental to the public interest. See 502 U.S.

644,5," The government's contention that Kodak film commands a significant premium price in the United States is discussed infra in

645,6," The theory that price discrimination is one of the indicia of market power also has received acceptance in the academic 
community. See, e.g., Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law § 522, at 125 (1995) (price discrimination ""can usefully show the 
existence and degree of market power if cost differences (or their absence) are readily determinable""); id. § 534d, at 183-85 
(price discrimination also is relevant to market definition process); Robert Pitofsky, New Definitions of Relevant Market and the 
Assault on Antitrust, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1805 (1990) (arguing that definition of relevant market should be adjusted if seller can 
discriminate against certain classes of consumers). "

676,3," General Portland relies almost entirely on the ""law of the case"" from French I, and essentially leaves it to us to ferret out its

Moreover, it is not helpful to the court, which is what briefs are for."
676,4," French does not appeal the district court's reaffirmed ruling on the inadmissibility of co-conspirator hearsay, so we do not revisit

678,5," Because we do not reverse the exclusion of the French declaration, and because we agree with the district court that the 
deposition testimony of Mr. Watkins is insufficient to raise a reasonable inference of a concrete price fixing conspiracy (a 
conclusion with which French does not take issue on appeal), we need not address the merits of the legal theory for which this 
evidence is intended to provide support: that French could prove a relevant market for purposes of the GP-Conrock conspiracy 
claim by showing a price fixing conspiracy among West Los Angeles concrete sellers.  French I, 885 F.2d at 1402 (Farris, J., 
concurring). In any event, French has failed to argue the merits of this theory in its briefs to this court. "
697,1," On August 1, 1995, following oral argument, the Court, in a minute order, granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants

702,6," Defendants have admitted, solely for summary judgment purposes, the assertions of Nichols' expert regarding percentage of 
sales of various motorcycle tire brands in certain markets, because they believe that these assertions are immaterial to the 
Court's inquiry into whether the parties agreed to fix prices. The relevant expert data is contained in Plaintiff's Exhibit (""PX"") 608 
at 19. "
703,7," Nichols was beaten by Bell Industries in 1991, in terms of Dunlop distributor purchases, by .9 percent. This was the only year 
between 1990 and 1992 that Nichols did not finish fourth. See PX 608, App. Table D-3. "

Nichols' theory of concerted activity to consolidate market share and to fix prices."
705,9," HN1[
] Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been labelled horizontal restraints, and 
those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints; thus the nature of a restraint is 
determined by the type of agreement that gives rise to the restraint rather than the anticompetitive economic effects of the 
restraint. See Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730 (1980)."
705,10," Under the Colgate doctrine, ""independent action is not proscribed. A manufacturer of course has a right to deal, or refuse to 
deal, with whomever it likes, as long as it does so independently."" Id. "
706,11," HN5[
] The per se presumption simply eliminates the plaintiff's burden of proving anticompetitive impact to the finder of fact 
through market analysis by an expert economist, as required under the rule of reason; it does not eliminate the need to find 
antitrust injury, nor does it relieve the plaintiff of its burden to identify and articulate the precise anticompetitive impact caused by 
the per se price-fixing violation. An antitrust injury flows from pricefixing agreements which plainly reduce competition. However, 
some pricefixing agreements do not ""restrain trade"" and are therefore reasonable.  Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 
495 U.S. 328, 339-40 (1990). It is important to note, however, that "" the antitrust laws were enacted for 'the protection of 
competition, not competitors.'"" Id. at 338 (citing Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 320 (1962)). Thus, a competitor 
""may not complain of conspiracies that set minimum [or maximum] prices at any level."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith 
Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585, n.8 (1986) (minimum prices); Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145 (1968) (maximum prices), 
unless the dangers identified by Albrecht are present (i.e., the smaller competitor is eliminated from competition pursuant to the 
price agreement and distribution is then channelled ""through a few large or specifically advantaged dealers."").  Atlantic Richfield, 
495 U.S. at 327. Therefore, finding an agreement is only the first step; the agreement is not illegal under § 1 of the Sherman Act 
unless the nature of the pricefixing agreement reduces competition and injures dealers or consumers. Id. The Court must 
therefore carefully scrutinize the competitive effect of the pricefixing agreement alleged to be illegal per se. Because the 
presumption of injury eliminates the need for a plaintiff to produce an economist, this theoretical hurdle is now a question of law 
for the court on summary judgment. This Court is extremely cognizant of this important distinction, recently recognized by the 
Seventh Circuit in Israel Travel Advisory Serv., Inc. v. Israel Identity Tours, Inc., Nos. 94-1451, 94-1554, 94-1815, & 94-1816, 
1995 WL 425224, *5 (7th Cir. July 20, 1995) (Easterbrook, J.) (""the antitrust injury doctrine applies with full vigor to the per se 
offenses."
706,12," HN6[
] An agreement to terminate a distributor without evidence of a related agreement on price is not sufficient to establish 
a per se violation. However, an agreement to terminate, if proven to have an anticompetitive impact, could be illegal under the 
rule of reason as a nonprice restraint. See Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at 724, 726. Nonprice restraints are not alleged in this 
case. "
707,13," Unlike Title VII cases, however, the Plaintiff cannot prove an agreement to conspire merely by showing that the defendants' 
assertions of independent conduct was a pretext for pricefixing and illegal termination agreements. "
708,14," In a footnote, the Court explained: HN10[
] The concept of a meeting of the minds or a common scheme [to fix prices] in a distributor termination case 
includes more than a showing that the [nonterminated] distributor conformed to the [manufacturer's] suggested resale price. 
It means . . . that evidence must be presented [by the plaintiff that shows] that the distributor [not only] communicated its 
acquiescence or agreement, [but] that this [acquiescence] was [also] sought by the manufacturer. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761 n.90. "
709,15," As a practical matter, it may be difficult to draw a distinction between direct and unambiguous circumstantial evidence, since 
the characterization depends upon the facts of an individual case. Cf. 6 Areeda, Antitrust Law § 1410 at 64 HN12[
] (""Direct 
evidence [of an agreement includes] such [things] as documents, meetings, and participant testimony that defendants 
exchanged commitments or otherwise collaborated by some means other than making a marketplace decision.""). In this case, 
the documents and testimony that will be reviewed do not manifest an agreement that is so obvious that the Court need not 
pause in reaching a decision under Section 1. Quite the contrary, the evidence in this case never exceeds the outer limit of 
ambiguity."
709,16," References to the Exhibits submitted in this case are as follows: Defendants' Joint Exhibits are marked ""DX---""; Plaintiff's 
Exhibits are marked ""PX---."" Deposition testimony is designated by name and page number."
709,17," The Court has attempted to summarize the Plaintiff's most relevant evidence. The fact that every single piece of Plaintiff's 
evidence is not contained in this summary does not mean that the evidence was not evaluated by this Court. The Court has fully 
evaluated all the evidence cited by the Plaintiff in deciding the motions addressed in this Opinion and has followed the urging of 
Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of No. Am., 974 F.2d 1358, 1364 (3d Cir. 1992), to view the evidence as a whole. "
710,18," This price war consisted of aggressive price discounting by Dunlop distributors to dealers nationwide. However, Dunlop 
discounting was particularly fierce in southern California, which was an important market for motorcycle tires. 12(N)(b)(3) P 20

711,19, This agreement contained an alleged jury trial waiver which is discussed at the end of this Opinion.
711,20," In many instances, the testimony in this case is in conflict. Plaintiff claims that this conflict creates a credibility issue for the 
jury. Defendants correctly point out that Plaintiff cannot establish genuine issues of material fact with credibility arguments. Trans 
Aire Int'l, Inc. v. Northern Adhesive Co., Inc., 882 F.2d 1245, 1257 (7th Cir. 1989) (affirming entry of summary judgment and

F.2d 427, 434 (7th Cir. 1988) (""A motion for summary judgment cannot be defeated merely by an opposing party's incantation of 
lack of credibility over a movant's supporting affidavit.""). "

712,22," Parts Unlimited claims that it issued the revised price list on March 19, 1993, rather than March 22, 1993. Because the portion 
of that memorandum (PX 444) dated March 19, 1993, is redacted, it is impossible for the Court to make this determination. 
However, the portion of the memo dated March 22, 1993, appears to confirm the revision just as well."
712,23," According to Plaintiff, Parts Unlimited had never before issued revised prices prior to publication of its next annual catalog and 
never before had its ""best quantity"" prices (the subject matter of the March 22, 1993, Gregg Letter) been the same as 
Tucker/Rocky's prices--they were generally lower. "
714,24," Interbrand competition means competition between different manufacturers; intrabrand competition means competition among 
different distributors selling the same product. "
716,25," There is no other evidence in the record that any other distributor, including Tucker/Rocky and Parts Unlimited, ever 
threatened to stop selling Dunlop if Dunlop did not respond to their price complaints or other grievances. "
718,26," Buckley's testimony regarding his ""loss leader"" theory is found in his deposition at DX 13 at 114-121. "
720,27," Nevertheless, the Court expressly notes that even the addition of this ambiguous evidence would not have altered the 
conclusions it has reached herein. "
722,28," Plaintiff suggests that the Court need not find evidence of an agreement to terminate Nichols, because an agreement to 
terminate discounting distributors like Nichols is sufficient. Although we agree with this proposition, there is no significant 
difference in this case between the two agreements, because an agreement does not exist under either theory."
722,29," During their depositions, both Fred Fox and Bob Gregg guessed what these conversations were about. Fox asserts that the 
February phone call involved a conversation between Jim and Sharon Ricci who left Parts Unlimited and were at that time 
talking to their prospective employer, Tucker/Rocky, in February 1993. Gregg speculates that the March phone call covered the 
subject of ""SBS brake pads."" Parts Unlimited was the exclusive distributor for these pads, and Tucker/Rocky wanted to sell 
them. 12(N)(3)(b) Reply at P 31(i); Transcript at 141. "
723,30," Conversely, an agreement to terminate Nichols, without a price agreement, would limit Nichols to a nonprice rule of reason 
claim which it has not asserted. "
725,31," Plaintiff's counsel admitted during oral argument that ""Dunlop would have an independent right to reduce distributors to shake 
out the market so long as it did not terminate Nichols pursuant to a conspiracy."" Transcript at 25. "
726,32," Thus, there is no need to consider whether the presence of the so called ""plus factors""--conspiratorial motivation and acts 
against self-interest--support a conspiracy inference. See 6 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law §§ 1433-1434, at 218-221. "
727,33," The fact that neither Nichols, nor any other distributor, is ever mentioned in either the first page of the Gregg Letter, or the 
price analysis, indicates that Tucker/Rocky is responding to the complaints Dunlop received from Parts Unlimited regarding 
Tucker/Rocky's 1993 published prices. "
728,34," The Court must draw this inference, despite Parts Unlimited's ""credit inquiry"" theory, see Transcript at 131-32, because all 
reasonable inferences go to the Plaintiff as the nonmoving party. "
729,35," Even if the March Gregg Letter constituted an agreement to terminate Nichols, it is not sufficient to state a per se claim under 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, because it would at most constitute a nonprice restraint which, if it had an anticompetitive impact, 
would need to be tested under the rule of reason. Plaintiff has not alleged a nonprice restraint under the rule of reason, so the 
Court does not reach that question. "
730,36," The idea of applying a rule of reason analysis to a vertical pricefixing violation was discussed in Monsanto in a footnote, 465 
U.S. at 760 n.7, but was not ruled on because it was not raised at the district court level. The Court has not found any case since 
Monsanto that discusses this theory for recovery. "
736,37," The third measure of damages, lost sales on non-Dunlop products is not cognizable because Dr. Pisarkiewicz uses a 
statistical regression analysis to determine the percentage of Dunlop buyers who would also buy non-Dunlop products and the 
amount of these products that the buyers would purchase, without demonstrating evidence of a causal connection between the 
injury and the asserted damages. See, e.g., BASF Corp. v. Old World Trading Co., 41 F.3d 1081, 1093 (7th Cir. 1994) HN29[

(finding causation to be established where the plaintiff presented evidence that many customers would not have purchased from 
the defendant had they known of the defendant's wrongdoing and that the plaintiff's position in the market would have been 
more advantageous absent the defendant's wrongful conduct); Alpo Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co., 778 F. Supp. 555, 560 
(D.D.C. 1991)(noting that statistical regression analyses, ""while useful for demonstrating general trends and the broad impact of 
certain actions, are simply not usable with respect to the type of specific, concrete evidence needed. Without the regression 
analyses, however, there is nothing in the record from which this Court can deduce a lost profits figure without speculation.""),

such as the possible effect on sales of a declining trend in the popularity of [the product], the appearance of several competitors, 
vigorous price competition and, most importantly, [the plaintiff's] poor marketing strategy.""). For example, Plaintiff would need to 
offer something along the lines of testimony from buyers who would have bought non-Dunlop products from Nichols who went 
elsewhere because of price discrimination on Dunlop products."
736,38," Both Tucker/Rocky and Parts Unlimited note that Dunlop's pricing structure was highly individualized and flexible, and that 
there was no way for them to determine independently the amount of the discounts that another distributor might be receiving. 
See, e.g., Tucker/Rocky Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. Judg. at 31-32. "

and that the remaining 25 percent was divided between United Exposition Services and several smaller exposition contractors. 
These contractors also refused to rent from MCM at McCormick Place, as they allegedly had been told that problems would

771,8," In its second amended complaint filed after the dismissal with prejudice of its section 1 claim, MCM also alleged that Hogan, on 
April 17, 1992, agreed to grant A-B certain work rule concessions if it terminated its business relationship with MCM and rented 
equipment at McCormick Place only from OG. Although the district court had no opportunity to consider this allegation in 
connection with MCM's antitrust claim, it suggests that AB's actions may not have been entirely coerced, as A-B was able to 
negotiate concessions from the Teamsters in return for conduct in conformance with Hogan's wishes. Because the allegation 
was not before the district court, however, and because MCM does not allege that FDC received similar concessions, we will 
disregard that additional allegation when considering MCM's antitrust claim and will treat A-B and FDC both as coerced parties. 
On remand, however, MCM should be afforded the opportunity to include this potentially significant allegation in an amended 
complaint. "
773,9," FDC maintains that two more recent decisions ""buttress"" its argument (FDC Br. at 14-15 (citing Fineman v. Armstrong World 
Indus., Inc., 980 F.2d 171 (3d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 122 L. Ed. 2d 677, 113 S. Ct. 1285 (1993); Garshman v. Universal 
Resources Holding, Inc., 625 F. Supp. 737 (D.N.J. 1986)), yet neither case holds that concerted action is absent when the 
coerced party is named as a defendant. In Fineman, the Third Circuit considered whether the plaintiff had shown a conspiracy 
between a manufacturer and one of its distributors where the manufacturer had pressured the distributor into refusing to deal 
with one of its competitors. 980 F.2d at 212. The district court directed a verdict for the defendant manufacturer on the ground 
that no conspiracy had been established because the distributor did not share the manufacturer's purpose of eliminating the 
competitor from the market. Id. The Third Circuit reversed, believing that the district court's ruling would have the effect of 
rendering ""section 1 unavailable to private litigants suffering antitrust injury as a result of concerted action in a vertical matrix."" Id. 
The court held that a conspiracy could be found in that circumstance even if the manufacturer and distributor had different 
motives for engaging in anticompetitive conduct.  Id. at 215. In reaching that conclusion, the court mentioned Professor Areeda's 
suggestion that a distributor should not always be subject to liability when coerced by a manufacturer. Yet that question was not 
actually presented in Fineman, as the coerced distributor had not been sued. Id. The court addressed the point only to show that 
Professor Areeda would find a conspiracy in the case actually before the court even if the distributor had its own motives for 
acquiescing in the manufacturer's plan. Id. In Garshman, the court also discussed Professor Areeda's treatise and was reluctant to find a conspiracy where such a finding 
would subject a possible victim of coercion to liability for treble damages.  625 F. Supp. at 743. Yet the court did not base its 
decision on that ground, as it found other defects warranting dismissal of the complaint even if the facts alleged would support 
an inference of conspiracy. Id. "

] ""(b) In order to insure the continuance of adequate 
transit services when it appears that the holder of the franchise is or will be incapable of continuing to offer satisfactory service to 
meet present or future public passenger transportation requirements and it is improbable that such franchise will be sought by 
any other private concern, the public utilities control authority, on its own initiative, may or, on request of the transit district or the 
legislative body of one or more municipalities in the area served, shall fix a time and place for a hearing as to whether such 
franchise is suitable for acquisition by a transit district. Said authority shall give written notice of such hearing to the board of 
selectmen of each town, or in the case of cities and boroughs to the chief executive of each, within the area not less than 
fourteen days prior to such hearing, and shall cause to be published twice, not more than fourteen nor less than seven days prior 
to such hearing, notice of such hearing in a newspaper or newspapers having a substantial circulation in each municipality within 
such area. Suitability of a franchise for acquisition by a transit district shall be determined from the following considerations: (1) 
That public convenience and necessity require the continuance of transit service within the area, (2) that the present franchise 
holder is or will be incapable of continuing to offer satisfactory service, (3) that it is improbable that such franchise will be sought 
by a private concern and (4) that continuance of transit service may require the operation of such service by a transit district. 
After a public hearing thereon and consideration of the above-mentioned factors, the public utilities control authority may declare 
such franchise suitable for acquisition by a transit district, provided such declaration shall not affect the authority of the 
municipalities in the area to establish such a district. Ability to offer satisfactory service shall be based upon the financial stability 
of the franchise holder as determined from past, current and projected net income and from an estimate of financial ability to 
meet future public passenger transportation requirements in the area. The public utilities control authority may make periodic 
inspections of transit system franchise holders to determine the financial stability of each and for this purpose may examine the 
books, accounts and other pertinent documents of such franchise holders and shall have the power to compel the attendance of 
witnesses and the production of books, accounts and other pertinent documents by the issuance of a subpoena. ""(c) A transit district shall have the power to acquire real property and interests and rights in real property by eminent domain in 
the name of the transit district for the purposes of the transit district subject to the prior approval of the legislative body or bodies

damages. Where the transit district and the owner of such property cannot agree upon the amount to be paid to the owner for 
any property thus taken, the transit district shall proceed in the same manner specified for redevelopment agencies in 
accordance with sections 8-129 to 8-133, inclusive. Where the public utilities control authority has determined that a franchise is 
suitable for acquisition pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the transit district shall have the power to acquire by eminent 
domain all or any part of the franchise and of the holder's transit system, including the holder's real estate or interests therein, 
personal property, and funds under the control or held for the use of or the benefit of such holder. Where the transit district and 
the holder of such franchise and property cannot agree upon the amount to be paid to the holder for any franchise or property 
thus taken, the transit district shall proceed in the same manner specified for redevelopment agencies in accordance with

794,10," General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) § 7-273b (g) provides in relevant part: HN8[
] ""Whenever any transit district is formed under 
the provisions of this chapter, no provision of chapter] . . . 287 [regulation of taxicabs] . . . shall apply to the operation of transit 
systems by such district."""
794,11," Cumpstone testified that, had the defendant been subject to regulation by the commission, it would not have received 
permission to operate the number of vehicles it proposed because Westport's requirements did not justify the increases. 
Furthermore, he stated that the commission would not have approved the defendant's rates because they were below cost and 
below existing rates."
794,12," If the defendant had assumed the commission's regulatory powers, the plaintiff would have had a right to appeal from the 
defendant's actions. See footnote 8."
794,13," The trial court further found that the defendant had misrepresented its intended treatment of the plaintiff to the transportation 
authority in order to obtain funding for the project. Because the transportation authority is concerned about the impact that 
government subsidized transport districts may have on private operators, it evaluates this impact when considering an "
795,," application for a grant. Although the defendant's application assured that private operators would receive fair treatment, the trial 
court found that the defendant had failed to comply with these assurances."
795,14," General Statutes § 35-27 provides: ""Monopolization or attempt to monopolize unlawful. Every contract, combination, or 
conspiracy to monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or monopolization of any part of trade or commerce is unlawful."""
795,15," The trial court arrived at this figure as follows: $ 12,144.00 Lost profits"
795,14," ,026.32 Prejudgment interest on lost profits"
795,150," ,000.00 Value of business"
795,173," ,250.00 Prejudgment interest on value of business $ 349,420.32 Subtotal multiplied by 3 Trebled $ 1,048,260.96 Total treble damages "
796,16," The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly based its conclusion that the defendant had violated the act on its 
determination that the defendant had the power to acquire the plaintiff's franchise and should have exercised that power. This 
claim mischaracterizes the opinion of the trial court and we conclude that it is without merit. The court based its findings of 
monopolistic intent upon the actions and statements of the defendant relating to achieving domination of the relevant market and 
driving competitors out of business. Furthermore, the trial court determined that the defendant's predatory pricing was anti-
competitive and illegal. On that basis, the court imposed liability upon the defendant. The defendant's failure to acquire the 
plaintiff was not a significant factor in the trial court's analysis of this issue and we need not address it further. In addition, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly trebled the prejudgment interest award. Because we conclude 
that the plaintiff is not entitled to prejudgment interest, we do not address this claim. Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly awarded treble damages against it because it was a government 
agency against which such damages may not be awarded unless there is explicit statutory authority for such an award. For the 
same reasons set forth in part III of this opinion in which we decline to review the defendant's claim that it is shielded from 
liability by governmental immunity, we likewise do not review this claim. It was not raised before the trial court, either by special 
pleading or otherwise, and the record does not indicate the nature of the defendant with respect to its governmental 
characteristics. See footnote 25. The plaintiff raises as an alternate ground for affirmance that the trial court properly awarded the plaintiff compensation because 
the defendant infringed on the plaintiff's property right to be free from competition absent a finding of public convenience and 
necessity. Because we affirm the treble damages awarded by the trial court, with the exception of prejudgment interest, we do 
not reach the alternate ground for affirmance. "
797,17," We note that in 1992, the legislature explicitly incorporated into law its intent that the judiciary be guided by interpretations of 
federal antitrust statutes when it enacted No. 92-248 of the 1992 Public Acts, now General Statutes § 35-44b, which provides 
that ""it is the intent of the general assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, the courts of this state shall be 
guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."" "
798,18," Marginal cost ""is traditionally defined as 'the increment to total cost that results from producing an additional increment of 
output.'"" Northeastern Telephone Co. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 651 F.2d 76, 87 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 455 
U.S. 943, 102 S. Ct. 1438, 71 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1982). ""Average variable cost is the sum of all variable costs those that vary with 
output -- divided by output."" Morgan v. Ponder, 892 F.2d 1355, 1360 n.11 (8th Cir. 1989). Variable costs are those costs that are 
dependent on a firm's output, while fixed costs are not.  Kelco Disposal, Inc. v. Browning Ferris Industries of Vermont, Inc., 845 
F.2d 404, 407 (2d Cir. 1988), aff'd on other grounds, 492 U.S. 257, 109 S. Ct. 2909, 106 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1989). "
799,19," The defendant contends that it did not provide premium ride service and therefore did not compete with the plaintiff in this 
area. The trial court determined, however, that the services that the defendant offered were substantially similar to those offered 
by the plaintiff. This finding is supported by the testimony of commission investigator Cumpstone. There was evidence that 
although shared ride service comprised most of the market for taxi services, the defendants provided premium service when it 
was requested. Its application to the transportation authority, which was incorporated by reference into the contract between the 
defendant and the federal government, stated that ""[a] fully integrated taxi service will offer premium ride, shared-ride and small 
package delivery services within the town of Westport . . . ."" Furthermore, Paul Green, one of the organizers and directors of the 
defendant, testified that Maxytaxy at times offered the equivalent of premium ride service. Finally, in its request for proposal for a 
personnel and management services contract pertaining to what became the Maxytaxy, the defendant stated that, in addition to 
shared ride service, it intended to provide ""special market services,"" which was described as a demand response, advance 
request service. This is an apparent description of premium ride service. We conclude that there is ample evidence to support 
the trial court's conclusion that the defendant did compete with the plaintiff."
799,20," The trial court's found that the defendant intended to raise its prices to eliminate the government subsidy and this finding was 
supported by the evidence and is not clearly erroneous. Furthermore, the defendant admitted that it intended to raise its prices in 
order to continue to operate after the subsidy was expended."
799,21," In Brooke Group, Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., supra, 113 S. Ct. 2578, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant 
had engaged in price discrimination in violation of the Clayton Act as amended by § 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Price 
Discrimination Act.  15 U.S.C. § 13 (a) (1982). The court recognized that the standard for analyzing recoupment is somewhat 
different under the Sherman Antitrust Act, which provides for a general prohibition against monopolistic business practices, 
comparable to General Statutes § 35-27.  15 U.S.C. § 2 (1982). The Sherman Antitrust Act has been interpreted to require the 
plaintiff to show that there was a dangerous probability that the defendant would recoup its investment in below cost pricing. 
Brooke Group, Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., supra, 2588. Therefore, under federal law the level of probable 
recoupment that the plaintiff must show varies according to which act the plaintiff alleges that the defendant violated. Because, 
in this case, we conclude that the defendant had no investment or losses to recoup, we leave for another day the issue of the 
level of probability of recoupment that must be shown in order to prove predatory pricing under the Connecticut act. "
800,22," The parties have been unable to point to any analogous case involving a similar instance of an alleged predatory pricing 
scheme that was federally funded either in Connecticut or elsewhere. In addition, our research has not revealed such a case."
800,23," Maxytaxy's only competition after May, 1978, was from Teddy's Taxi which, under new ownership, reinitiated its limousine 
services in the fall of 1978. The town of Westport conditioned the lease for livery service at the train station on a requirement that 
Teddy's Taxi provide limited taxi service. As a result, that taxi service, which operated at a substantial loss, totaled two taxis and 
averaged ten rides per day within Westport."
800,24," General Statutes § 35-31 (b) provides: ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person when 
said activity is specifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States."" "
801,25," We note that in Gauvin, although governmental immunity was not specially pleaded and the trial court therefore refused to 
consider it for that reason, this court remanded the case for articulation regarding whether the defendant was entitled to 
governmental immunity because the trial court had requested certain clarifications from the parties after the trial wherein the 
defendant raised the defense. We concluded that, because the trial court specifically requested the information through which 
the defense was introduced, the court created the opportunity for the defense to be raised and, therefore, we held that the court 
had no discretion regarding whether to consider the defense.  Gauvin v. New Haven, supra, 187 Conn. 185-86. More 
importantly, however, this court based its decision on the determination that there was apparently ""an adequate basis for the trial 
court to determine whether . . . the defense of governmental immunity could have been sustained."" Id., 187. In the case before 
us, the issue was introduced in the normal coarse of filing posttrial memoranda of law, and there was no evidence introduced by 
the defendant upon which the court could make a determination on the merits."
801,26," The defendant also argues that because the federal antitrust laws exempt local government from liability, it should also be 
protected under the Connecticut act. In 1984, long after the actions at issue in this case took place, the Local Government 
Antitrust Act was enacted, which exempts local government entities from federal antitrust damage awards.  15 U.S.C. §§ 34-36 
(1989). Prior to the amendment, however, municipalities were liable under federal law for treble antitrust damages. See Palm 
Springs Medical Clinic, Inc. v. Desert Hospital, 628 F. Supp. 454, 459-60 n.4 (C.D. Cal. 1986). In Connecticut, municipalities "
802,," have not been exempted by statute from antitrust damages. Accordingly, we reject the defendant's argument that its actions 
during 1977 and 1978 should be exempt from antitrust liability."
802,27," Although the trial court discussed governmental immunity in its memorandum of decision, and held that the defendant was not 
entitled to it, the court reached this conclusion by determining that governmental immunity is not available to transit districts 
pursuant to General Statutes § 7-273h. Section 7-273h (a) provides in relevant part: ""Any district operating a transit service 
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be responsible for any injury or damage to persons or property, happening or 
arising by reason of the maintenance or operation of the same, in the same manner and to the same extent as though the same 
were owned and operated by individuals or by a private corporation. . . . Because we are unable to determine in the first instance 
whether the defendant would have otherwise been entitled to governmental immunity, we leave for another day the question of 
whether § 7-273h constitutes a waiver of immunity from liability under the Connecticut act. "
803,28," The defendant contends that the trial court incorrectly calculated the plaintiff's damages based on the rates for premium ride 
service in the surrounding localities because the defendant did not compete with the plaintiff in this area. There was 
contradictory testimony on this point. See footnote 19. The trial court concluded that the defendant and the plaintiff provided 
substantially the same services and this conclusion is supported by the testimony presented at trial. A related argument that the defendant sets forth is that the trial court improperly applied the premium ride service rate of $ 2.70 
to calculate the plaintiff's damages. There was a wide range of rates that applied according to the distance traveled. The trial 
court determined that $ 2.70 was the rate charged for the average distance traveled. There was no evidence offered to show 
that shared ride service resulted in lower per ride revenues to the taxi companies than premium ride service. On the contrary, 
although the record is unclear regarding how shared rider service was charged, it was reasonable for the trial court to assume 
that although individual shared ride passengers paid less than they would have for premium service, the total revenue to the taxi 
company was at least the same as premium service. Therefore, we conclude that the use by the trial court of an average 
distance and rate was reasonable. "
804,29," In addition, John Riley, a senior rate specialist with the commission who was responsible for the development and approval of 
taxi rates, testified that if the plaintiff had requested a fare increase in 1977, the commission would have approved such an 
increase to the rate of $ 2.70 for a three mile trip that was charged in other nearby localities."
804,30," The defendant argues that, because the plaintiff generated greater revenues in 1977, after the defendant initiated the 
Maxytaxy, than in 1974, before the defendant began its operations, the plaintiff, therefore, was not negatively impacted by the 
Maxytaxy. This argument is without merit. It is true that the plaintiff's revenues from taxi operations were $ 114,070 in 1977, as 
opposed to $ 100,362 in 1974. We have already affirmed the trial court's determination, however, that if the defendant had not 
competed illegally at below cost prices in order to drive the plaintiff out of business, the plaintiff's revenue would have been much 
higher. This is the dispositive issue that entitles the plaintiff to lost profits."
804,31," In addition to revenues from its taxi operations, the plaintiff also earned revenue from a rental car business, vending machines 
and the sale of lottery tickets. The trial court subtracted all revenue that was not directly derived from the plaintiff's taxi services 
from its damage calculations. The defendant does not dispute the trial court's calculations or conclusion regarding the plaintiff's 
actual profits for this period."
804,32," The defendant argues that the trial court improperly based its calculations on the assumption that the defendant did not exist 
at all and awarded damages according to what the plaintiff would have earned without any competition from the defendant. It is impossible to speculate regarding what would have happened if the defendant had chosen to compete legally. It certainly 
would have had to charge fares sufficient to perpetuate its existence. What those fares would have been is not determinable 
and, therefore, as the trial court stated, the level of competition the defendant would have given the plaintiff is similarly 
indeterminate. Contrary to the defendant's allegation, however, the trial court did not assume the defendant's nonexistence when it calculated 
the plaintiff's damages. The trial court used the plaintiff's actual ridership during the period between 1977 and 1978, which had 
been adversely impacted by competition from the defendant and was lower than it otherwise would have been. Michael Gilbertie 
testified that the plaintiff's ridership dropped noticeably in 1977. In contrast, the defendant's ridership increased from 1458 in 
April, 1977, to 11,319 in January, 1978. It is reasonable to assume that a substantial portion of the plaintiff's lost ridership was 
the defendant's gain. Therefore, a competitive impact was included in the calculation."
804,33," The trial court further determined that this outcome was reasonable because it was within the range that the commission 
deemed an acceptable profit margin. The plaintiff's adjusted revenue for 1977 would have been $ 176,587, which amounts to a 
net operating ratio of 87 percent."
804,34," The defendant has not challenged on appeal any aspect of the mathematic methodology employed by the trial court and, 
therefore, we do not review it."
804,35," The defendant argues that any decrease in revenues between 1976 and 1977 was due to the closing of the plaintiff's evening 
operations, which was, in turn, due to the death of John Gilbertie, who worked as the night dispatcher. Michael Gilbertie testified, 
however, that the decision was precipitated by the fact that, due to competition from the defendant, the evening operations were 
not profitable and that was the basis of the decision to discontinue them. The trial court obviously decided to credit his testimony 
and the defendant has failed to show that the court's decision was clearly erroneous. "
805,36," The trial court capitalized $ 17,903 at between 10 to 12 percent, and valued the plaintiff's taxi franchise at between 
approximately $ 149,000 and $ 179,000."
805,37," Michael Gilbertie explained: ""We just saw no way from a business point of view that we should risk our private property to 
continue beating our head against the wall and competing with these people. And like my father said, don't throw good money 
after bad. And we were in a no win situation. So we just said, close the doors . . . ."" "
806,38," The defendant further claims that the plaintiff did not suffer a total loss when it chose to discontinue operations and that the 
trial court did not properly credit the defendant for several transactions and retained assets. First, the defendant contends that 
the plaintiff's Weston operation and package delivery service should have been deducted from the damages awarded. We do 
not agree. The defendant's illegal conduct caused the plaintiff to lose its entire business, not only the parts in which the plaintiff 
and the defendant directly competed. The defendant offered no evidence that the plaintiff could have continued to run a 
profitable enterprise by operating one taxi in Weston and delivering packages. The defendant next contends that the plaintiff's certificate of public necessity and convenience had value and should have been 
deducted from its damages. Although the defendant did not raise this issue at trial and the trial court did not make any findings 
regarding the certificate, it reasonably could have found that the certificate was worthless at the time the plaintiff ceased 
operations. The below cost fares offered by the defendant would have been a serious disincentive for any private taxi operator to 
begin operations in Westport, and it is doubtful that any such operator would have attempted to enter the Westport market. Finally, the defendant claims that the plaintiff retained two cars and its dispatching equipment and that the value of this 
equipment should have been discounted from the damage calculation. We disagree. The plaintiff unsuccessfully attempted to 
sell its dispatching equipment and sold two fully depreciated taxis for between $ 200 and $ 300. Accordingly, the dispatching 
equipment had no value and the value of the cars was negligible. We conclude that none of the defendant's contentions shows 
that the trial court's damage determination was clearly erroneous."
806,39," In addition to arguing that the act includes no provision for prejudgment interest, the defendant alleges that the plaintiff is not 
entitled to prejudgment interest because it did not seek prejudgment interest in its amended complaint. HN52[
] It is well 
established that interest need not be specially claimed in the demand for damages in order to recover. Practice Book § 140. 
HN53[
] ""'The allowance of interest as an element of damages is . . . primarily an equitable determination and a matter lying 
within the discretion of the trial court.'"" State v. Stengel, 192 Conn. 484, 487, 472 A.2d 350 (1984). We conclude that the 
plaintiff's claim for prejudgment interest was properly before the trial court. "
807,40," Practice Book § 285A requires that ""if a party intends to raise any claim of law which may be the subject of an appeal, he must 
either state the same distinctly to the court before his argument is closed or state it in a written trial brief. If this is not done, it will 
not be the duty of either the trial court or the appellate court to decide the claim."""
807,41, Reference is made to our discussion of plain error review in part III of this opinion.
807,42, See footnote 16.
807,43," General Statutes § 37-3a provides: ""Rate recoverable as damages. Except as provided in sections 37-3b, 37-3c and 52-192a, 
interest at the rate of ten per cent a year, and no more, may be recovered and allowed in civil actions or arbitration proceedings "
808,," under chapter 909, including actions to recover money loaned at a greater rate, as damages for the detention of money after it 
becomes payable. Judgment maybe given for the recovery of taxes assessed and paid upon the loan, and the insurance upon 
the estate mortgaged to secure the loan, whenever the borrower has agreed in writing to pay such taxes or insurance or both. 
Whenever the maker of any contract is a resident of another state or the mortgage security is located in another state, any 
obligee or holder of such contract, residing in this state, may lawfully recover any agreed rate of interest or damages on such 
contract until it is fully performed, not exceeding the legal rate of interest in the state where such contract purports to have been 
made or such mortgage security is located."""
808,44," Treble damages are punitive damages.  Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 203 Conn. 667, 671, 526 
A.2d 522 (1987); 3 P. Areeda & D. Turner, supra, P 630c."
808,45," We note that the federal statutes include no equivalent to § 35-44 and that there is no discussion of this provision in the 
legislative history of the act. Therefore, we cannot ascertain the precise legislative intent for its enactment. Title 15 of the United 
States Code, § 21, details, however, how federal antitrust actions must be handled procedurally. Section 21 discusses at length, 
for example, the issuance of complaints for violations, hearing procedures, review of orders, jurisdiction, conclusiveness of 
findings, finality of judgment and service of process. No such procedural detail is included in the Connecticut antitrust act and it 
is reasonable to assume that the legislature included § 35-44 to indicate that state antitrust actions are to be managed 
procedurally in the same manner as any other civil action unless otherwise stated in the act. "
809,46," Our research has revealed only two cases in which prejudgment interest had been awarded in an antitrust action.  Uniroyal, 
Inc. v. Jetco Auto Service, Inc., 1980-81 Trade Cas. CCH P 63,806, pp. 78,315, 78,321 (S.D.N.Y. 1981); Eiberger v. Sony Corp. 
of America, 459 F. Supp. 1276, 1289 (S.D.N.Y. 1978), rev'd on other grounds, 622 F.2d 1068 (2d Cir. 1980). This precedent was 
effectively overruled in Strobl v. New York Mercantile Exchange, 768 F.2d 22 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.  Simplot v. Strobl, 
474 U.S. 1006, 106 S. Ct. 527, 88 L. Ed. 2d 459 (1985), which affirmed the lower court's adoption of the reasoning in Trans 
World Airlines, Inc. v. Hughes, 449 F.2d 51, 80 (2d Cir. 1971), rev'd on other grounds, 409 U.S. 363, 93 S. Ct. 647, 34 L. Ed. 2d 
577 (1973), that mandatory treble damages are sufficient to compensate a plaintiff in an antitrust action. See Strobl v. New York 
Mercantile Exchange, 590 F. Supp. 875, 882-83 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (providing detailed discussion of why prejudgment interest is 
unavailable where damages are trebled)."
809,47," Title 15 of the United States Code § 15 (a) (1982) provides in relevant part: ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor . . . and shall recover threefold the damages by 
him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The court may award under this section . . . simple 
interest on actual damages for the period beginning on the date of service of such person's pleading setting forth a claim under 
the antitrust laws and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period therein, if the court finds that the award of such 
interest for such period is just in the circumstances. In determining whether an award of interest under this section for any period 
is just in the circumstances, the court shall consider only -- ""(1) whether such person or the opposing party, or either party's representative, made motions or asserted claims or defenses 
so lacking in merit as to show that such party or representative acted intentionally for delay, or otherwise acted in bad faith; ""(2) whether, in the course of the action involved, such person or the opposing party, or either party's representative, violated 
any applicable rule, statute, or court order providing for sanctions for dilatory behavior or otherwise providing for expeditious 
proceedings; and ""(3) whether such person or the opposing party, or either party's representative, engaged in conduct primarily for the purpose of 
delaying the litigation or increasing the cost thereof."""
809,48," We note that there is a divergence in the federal act between damages available to private plaintiffs and to the United States 
as plaintiff. While prejudgment interest may be awarded to a private plaintiff on actual damages only; see 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) 
(1982); the United States may recover prejudgment interest on its threefold damages.  15 U.S.C. § 15a (1982). "
810,49," Judgment shall enter in the amount of $ 12,144 for lost profits and $ 150,000 for the value of the lost business, totaling $ 
162,144. These damages are to he trebled and the total judgment to be rendered is $ 486,432. "
816,1," Plaintiff attempts to distinguish Anago as factually inapposite because it is a merger case. (Plaintiff's memorandum in support, 
pp. 20-21, R.Doc. 290.) While Anago did involve a merger, its facts do not lessen the principle of law set forth therein."
816,2," In the instant motion, Doctor's Hospital offers no new contentions specifically as to ""antitrust injury"" in terms of standing other 
than new supporting evidence for its contention as to the effect on consumer choice. This new proof is discussed herein. "
822,1," In doing so, the Court referred to this Circuit's recent decision in United States v. Microsoft Corporation, 56 F.3d 1448 (D.C. Cir. 
1995), which held that a proposed antitrust consent decree was in the public interest. As discussed herein, this action is not 
subject to the requirements of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, 15 U.S.C. § 16(b)-(h), which governed the court 
proceedings in Microsoft. Nonetheless, we show here that the relevant public interest standards that apply to the consent 
settlement met in this case. See, e.g., SEC v. Randolph, 736 F.2d 525 (9th Cir. 1984). "
823,2," We note that the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act (""Tunney Act""), 15 U.S.C. § 16(b)-(h), to which the government's 
proposed consent decree in Microsoft was subject, requires that any proposal for a ""consent judgment"" submitted by the United 
States in a civil case filed ""under the antitrust laws"" be filed with the court at least 60 days in advance of its effective date, 
published in the Federal Register and a newspaper for public comment, and reviewed by the court for the purpose of 
determining whether it is in the public interest. The FTC Act is not an ""antitrust law"" within the meaning of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 12(a). Accordingly, it is well settled that any action brought pursuant to the FTC Act for the recovery of civil penalties is 
not subject to the requirements of the Tunney Act. Even in procedures involving the assessment of civil penalties under Section 
11(1) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 21(1), for violation of Federal Trade Commission orders, the courts have not required use 
of Tunney Act procedures in cases involving only the payment of civil penalties. Indeed, this Court has consistently entered 
consent judgments for civil penalties under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18a, without 
employing Tunney Act procedures. See, e.g., United States v. Harold A. Honickman, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18148, 1992-2 
Trade Cas. (CCH) P17,018 (D.D.C.); United States v. Beazer, plc, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12755, 1992-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) 
P62,923 (D.D.C.); and United States v. Atlantic Richfield Company, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 738, 1992-1 Trade Cas. (CCH) 
P69,695 (D.D.C.)."
823,3," Section 5(1) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(1) provides that: Any person, partnership, or corporation who violates an order of the Commission after it becomes final, shall forfeit and pay 
to the United States a civil penalty of not more than $ 10,000 for each violation, which shall accrue to the United States and 
may be recovered in a civil action brought by the Attorney General for the United States. Each separate violation of such an 
order shall be a separate offense, except that in the case of violation through continuing failure to obey or neglect to obey a 
final order of the Commission, each day of continuance of such failure or neglect shall be deemed a separate offense . ."
823,4," On June 9, 1995, the Commission notified the Attorney General of its intention to commence the civil penalty action against the 
defendant in accordance with Section 16(a)(1) of the FTC Act. On July 19, 1995, the U.S. Department of Justice informed the 
Commission that it could file the action at any time without allowing 45 days to elapse. "
824,5," See SEC v. Randolph, 736 F.2d 525, 529 (9th Cir. 1984) (""unless a consent decree is unfair, inadequate, or unreasonable, it 
ought to be approved."")."
824,6," To have any deterrent effect, a penalty must be large enough to be more than just a license fee or an acceptable cost of doing 
business. On the other hand, a penalty must not be so large that it threatens the financial health or competitive viability of the 
penalized entity. See United States v. I.T.T. Continental Baking Co., 420 U.S. 223, 231, 43 L. Ed. 2d 148, 95 S. Ct. 926 (1975)."
824,7," See United States v. J.B. Williams Co., Inc., 354 F. Supp. 521, 551 (S.D.N.Y. 1973), rev'd and modified on other grounds, 498 
F.2d 414 (2d Cir. 1974)."
824,8," At the same time, it should be noted that the defendant is not charged with de novo violations of the antitrust laws. The 
principal conduct alleged in the complaint in this matter involves the defendant, one of its independent sales representatives and 
one of its former retail dealers with which the defendant was in litigation at the time the Commission's investigation was 
commenced. The former retail dealer, Best Buy, had filed suit against the defendant alleging that it had been terminated due to 
its failure to continue participating in a nationwide resale price maintenance conspiracy among the defendant and all its dealers. 
The Commission's complaint does not allege that defendant was engaged in a resale price maintenance conspiracy with its 
dealers or that defendant's former retail dealer, Best Buy, was terminated by the defendant in violation of any provision of the 
order in Docket No. C-3092."
824,9," For example, the age of the evidence concerning the alleged order violations was considered by the Commission. "
825,10," The Commission also considered the following factors before determining to accept the settlement: (1) the good or bad faith of 
the defendant; (2) any benefits that the defendant may have derived from its alleged violation of the order; and (3) the harm to 
the public resulting from the defendant's alleged conduct. "
831,1," The Court notes that although Plaintiff Hialeah seems reluctant to admit that Defendant FHBPA is the relevant ""horsemen's 
group"" as defined by the IHA, Plaintiff Hialeah does not contest the status of Defendant FHBPA as the relevant horsemen's 
group in any of Plaintiff's moving papers."
831,2," This refusal by Defendant FHBPA to give consent to the simulcasts has been referred to by Defendants as the ""horsemen's 
veto."""
831,3," Although Plaintiff Hialeah has not affirmatively asserted that it has obtained the necessary consent from the appropriate ""host 
racing commission"" and the ""off-track racing commissions"" to simulcast the races, Defendants have also not asserted that 
Plaintiff Hialeah has failed to obtain the consent of these agencies. "

Eurystheus imposed the twelve labors upon Hercules, so the E & O Underwriters imposed upon the Court below the Herculean 
task of resolving a number of exceedingly complex issues in their motions to dismiss.""). "
845,2," The stipulation to dismiss claims against Sturge arising from two Outhwaite syndicates was filed pursuant to the settlement 
agreement in Stockwell v. R.H.W. Outhwaite (Underwriting Agencies) Limited, Nos. 89-2729, 91-1501 (Q.B. Comm'l Ct. filed 
Dec. 18, 1989) (Eng.). Leslie subsequently dismissed all claims against Sturge, apparently for reasons of litigation strategy."
845,3," Some of the Lloyd's documents adopt Sturge's arguments by reference. Therefore, the Court will address, as necessary, any 
arguments adopted by reference."

846,5," In contrast with a ""claims-made"" policy, an ""occurrence"" policy provides ""long-tail"" coverage. A claims-made policy covers only

policyholder need only buy one insurance policy to be covered for occurrences within a particular year, a ""claims-made"" 
policyholder ordinarily must purchase subsequent policies from year to year, or a separate ""long-tail"" policy, in order to obtain 
extended coverage. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California,     U.S.    ,    , 113 S. Ct. 2891, 2896, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612, 61 U.S.L.W.

612, 61 U.S.L.W. 4855 (1993) (Insurance Antitrust Litigation), held that allegations by the attorneys general of nineteen states

customary practices of the Lloyd's insurance market). The Court considers unpersuasive any characterization of Lloyd's as roughly similar to the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), 
because this analogy ignores dramatic differences between the two institutions. See contra Bonny v. Society of Lloyd's, 3 F.3d 
156, 158 n.2 (7th Cir. 1993), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 114 S. Ct. 1057, 127 L. Ed. 2d 378, 62 U.S.L.W. 3551 (1994); Roby v.

U.S.L.W. 3319 (1993). First, Lloyd's has greater similarity to a private club than it does to a public stock exchange. Virtually 
anyone in the world may buy and sell securities listed on the NYSE, except, for example, certain nationals of foreign states 
subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or the Trading With The Enemy Act. In contrast, 
the opportunity to participate in Lloyd's underwriting syndicates is strictly limited to approximately 30,000 individuals who have 
applied for and qualified as ""Names."" More importantly, business conducted on the NYSE, whether by United States citizens or 
by foreign nationals, is subject to comprehensive regulation by an independent government agency with extensive enforcement 
authority. In contrast, the government of England has elected not to regulate the Lloyd's insurance market. See Lloyd's Act, 1982 
(Eng.). Except to the extent Lloyd's or its syndicates issue or sell securities, insurance, and services abroad, the Lloyd's 
insurance market, at least in theory, is largely self-regulating."

848,19," This statement is only true for the time period in which Leslie participated in underwriting at Lloyd's. Lloyd's 1993 Annual 
Report states, ""The business plan, published in April 1993, set out a programme of profound change for all sectors of the

Peter Rowland states: We set ourselves to creating, by the end of 1995, the largest reinsurance / run-off company the world has ever seen. . . . I

the Cromer Report to outside Names until October 1986, after Leslie had executed the General Undertaking containing the 
contested forum selection clause. Incidentally, about this time, entities participating in the American insurance industry were 
actively misrepresenting the intended effect of ""sudden and accidental"" pollution-exclusion clauses to insurance regulators.

up to the time he signed the General Undertaking. In other papers Leslie has filed with the Court, Leslie claims that appropriate 
underwriting and accounting practices would have required these syndicates to accumulate significantly greater reserves to 
cover future losses, rather than paying temporary ""profits"" which would be called hack later as losses on open or reopened 
accounting years. See Dkt. #117, at 20, P 35."

event of insolvency, declaring bankruptcy, (2) if possible, buying reinsurance from ""insiders"" or existing Lloyd's syndicates, for a 
premium equal to or greater than the discounted present value of expected future losses, (3) recruiting new ""outsiders"" with 
sufficient capacity to reinsure his risks, and reinsuring to them, or (4) if possible, reinsuring to NewCo / Equitas (i.e. paying a 
similar premium as would be paid to ""insiders, or treating policyholders as ""outsiders,"" as the case may be)."

""conflict-of-law"" approach to international securities and antitrust cases, and adopting instead a rebuttable presumption that the 
relevant statutes apply extraterritorially). "
860,45," Incidentally, the English Parliament in 1980 passed The Protection of Trading Interests Act, 1980, ch. 11 (Eng.), which was 
primarily responsive to extraterritorial application of the Sherman Act by the United States. This legislation includes a ""clawback"" 
provision creating a cause of action in England for recovery as damages any monies awarded in a foreign jurisdiction (i.e. the 
United States), and actually collected, in excess of compensatory damages (i.e. Sherman Act treble damages). Of course, this 
statute does not indicate there is any ""true conflict"" between the requirements of English law and the prohibitions contained in 
United States antitrust, racketeering, or consumer protection laws. However, the Protection of Trading Interests Act is an 
indication that English and American policies differ considerably insofar as the remedies each country provides for wrongdoing."
860,46," Like Rule 10b-5 violations, Sherman Act violations by foreign defendants with a direct and substantial effect on United States 
commerce have long been held actionable in United States courts, despite the presumption stated in Foley Bros. Matsushita

EEOC, 111 S. Ct. at 1232-1233). Congress recently attempted to clarify the standard for extraterritorial application of the 
Sherman Act when it passed the Foreign Antitrust Improvements Act. 15 U.S.C. § 6a (""Section 1 to 7 of this title shall not apply 
to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations unless . . . such 
conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably forseeable effect [on interstate commerce, import commerce, or export

861,47," Lloyd's might have more success making this argument if the facts in this case were more similar to the facts in Hirsch v. 
Oakely Vaughn Underwriting, Ltd., No. H-87-3727 (S.D. Tex., Dec. 14, 1988), aff'd, 904 F.2d 704 (5th Cir., May 31, 1990) (No.

English cousin and conducted the bulk of the transaction in England. The only meeting in Houston, the trial court said, was ""to

that a foreign sovereign was not immune from a suit brought in United States courts, solely by non-U.S. plaintiffs, for breach of

held that issuing such debt was ""commercial activity,"" as that term is used in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976

862,50," The 1992 report of the Lloyd's Task Force, LLOYD'S OF LONDON, LLOYD'S: A ROUTE FORWARD 26, at Ex. 6 (1992), 
reports that United States Names in 1991 constituted 7.7% of the total membership base of Lloyds, or roughly 2044 out of 
26,539 Names. United States Names in 1981 accounted for 6.6% of the membership base, or roughly 1263 out of 19,137 
Names. In contrast, Names anywhere outside the United Kingdom in 1971 accounted for only one percent of the total 
membership base, or roughly sixty out of 6,020 total names."
862,51," MCG provides a fine example of how an issuer of securities in a foreign market can avoid the application of the United States 
securities laws: As reflected in the prospectus prepared by Brown, the Great Western Shares, as foreign securities, were not registered 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they had to be offered exclusively to investors who were 
neither citizens, residents, nationals, nor chartered residents of the United States. MCG, 896 F.2d at 172. "
863,52," Lloyd's conducts a considerable portion of its underwriting business with United States customers. A 1992 report by Lloyds 
indicates that, excluding inter-syndicate reinsurance, the United States market accounted for thirty-two percent (32%) of Lloyd's 
underwriting business in 1990. LLOYD'S OF LONDON, LLOYD'S: A ROUTE FORWARD 49 & Ex. 28 (1992). Only the U.K. 
market, which accounted for 36% of Lloyd's overall business in 1990, is more important to Lloyd's. Id. In 1989, the U.S. market 
was the source of twenty-eight percent (28%) of Lloyd's direct insurance premiums, but accounted for over thirty-eight percent 
(38.3%) of Lloyd's reinsurance premiums excluding inter-syndicate reinsurance -- more than the 31.3% share of reinsurance 
premiums associated with the U.K. market. Id. at 185 & Ex. 96. "
864,53," The forum-selection / choice-of-law (""FS/COL"") clauses, in substance, are the 1986 General Undertaking. The remainder of 
the revised General Undertaking consists of (1) an agreement ""to comply with the provisions of [the] Lloyds Acts,"" subordinate 
legislation, and decisions of designated Lloyd's officials, (2) a clause continuing the FS/COL clauses in effect ""notwithstanding 
that the member ceases, for any reason, to be a Member of . . . Lloyd's,"" and (3) a savings clause, in the event ""any term of this 
Undertaking shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable."" "
865,54," The further possibility remains that ""the laws of England,"" as the term is used in the General Undertaking, include English 
choice-of-law principles. These choice-of-law principles could potentially refer back to United States or Texas law as governing 
interpretation of the General Undertaking in this case, a phenomenon known as ""renvoi."" See Nailen v. Ford Motor Co., 873 F.2d

the choice-of-law rules of the state in which they sit, and from there to the law of another jurisdiction, resembles a form of renvoi 
called ""transmission""). Of course, the tricky question of what law provides the substantive rule of decision concerning the 
retroactivity issue is largely irrelevant if the substantive rule is the same in both England and the United States. See Kramer, "
866,," Return of the Renvoi, 66 N.Y.U. L. Rev. at 1012 (""First, the court must determine whether there is in fact a conflict of laws, since 
the mere fact that the parties disagree about the principle of law does not mean that these laws actually conflict.""). However, the 
Court need not answer these questions unless the forum-selection clause is enforceable against Leslie."
866,55," Perhaps these courts all decided, sub silentio, that the enforceability of such clauses is and should be a matter of federal 
common law -- something proposed in academic circles for some time. Cf. Stewart Org., Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22, 28-29, 
108 S. Ct. 2239, 2243, 101 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1988) (cited in Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., 499 U.S. at 589, 111 S. Ct. at 1522); Caldas

Inc. v. Lexington State Bank, 46 F.3d 13, 15 (5th Cir. 1995) (per curiam) (not addressing this question). However, none of them 
said so expressly or dealt with any Erie or Klaxon problems this might create. Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct.

states, except where the Constitution or treaties of the United States or Acts of Congress otherwise require or provide, shall be 
regarded as rules of decision in the courts of the United States, in cases where they apply.""); see also Lampf, 501 U.S. at 355, 
111 S. Ct. at 2778 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1652). The other cases cited by the Bonny, Roby, Riley, and Shell courts, Mitsubishi 
Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985), and Scherk v. Alberto-
Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 94 S. Ct. 2449, 41 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1974), involve the enforceability of arbitration agreements under 
authority of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, see Scherk, 417 U.S. at 510, 94 S. Ct. at 2453 (the Act ""reversed centuries 
of judicial hostility to arbitration agreements""), an issue this case no longer presents. See also Mastrobuono v. Shearson 
Lehman Hutton, Inc.,     U.S.    ,    , 115 S. Ct. 1212, 1215-16, 1219, 131 L. Ed. 2d 76, 63 U.S.L.W. 4195 (1995); Allied-Bruce

course, the Scherk exception to the rule in Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427, 74 S. Ct. 182, 98 L. Ed. 168 (1953), is no longer of any 
moment because Wilko has been squarely overruled. Rodriguez de Quijas Shearson/American Express, 490 U.S. 477, 484, 109 
S. Ct. 1917, 1921, 104 L. Ed. 2d 526 (1989). Moreover, one commentator has argued: A final issue not adequately addressed by the Seventh Circuit in Bonny is the possibility that the solicitation of the plaintiffs 
in the United States to invest in Lloyd's would constitute sufficient contacts to overcome the presumptive validity of the 
forum selection and choice-of-law clauses. The majority in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co. conceded that there may be some 
situations where the foreign contacts are so insignificant or attenuated that the principles of Wilko should still apply. This 
concession was in response to the dissent's concern in Scherk that the majority's analysis could result in American 
investors being forced to arbitrate their claims in a foreign country despite the fact that material misrepresentations inducing 
them to invest in a foreign corporation were made in the United States; a fact pattern very similar to Bonny. Jennifer M. Eck, Note, Turning Back the Clock: A Judicial Return to Caveat Emptor for U.S. Investors in Foreign Markets, 19 
N.C. J. Int'l L. & Comm. Reg. 313 (1994) (footnotes omitted). "
867,56," Both parties and all U.S. courts that have examined the matter appear to agree that enforcement of the Lloyd's forum-selection 
clause will operate ""in tandem"" with the Lloyd's choice-of-law clause to render any 10b-5, section 12(2), or RICO cause of action 
unenforceable in England. See Bonny, 3 F.3d at 160-61; Roby, 996 F.2d at 13645; Riley, 969 F.2d at 958; Shell, 850 F. Supp. 
at 622-23; see also Jennifer M. Eck, Note, Turning Back the Clock: A Judicial Return to Caveat Emptor for U.S. Investors in 
Foreign Markets, 19 N.C. J. Int'l L. & Comm. Reg. 313 (1994) (criticizing Bonny v. Society of Lloyd's) (""The Seventh Circuit still 
failed . . . adequately [to] address the issue of whether plaintiffs were prospectively waiving their Securities Act remedies 
because the court's analysis ignored the fact that remedies available in England are not substantially similar to U.S. statutory 
remedies.""). The possibility is intriguing that English courts might recognize that ""modern approaches assume that . . . legislative 
jurisdictions of different states overlap,"" and conclude that it is not inconsistent with English law to enforce rights based upon 
certain United States statutes, see Larry Kramer, Return of the Renvoi, 66 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 979, 990, 991 (""The traditional theory 
purports to find a complete scheme for determining the parties' rights in the principle of territoriality. . . . But the territorial 
principle does not resolve cases that involve transactions or occurrences connected to several states, because applying the law 
of any (and none) of these states is consistent with its premise.""); see also Laker Airways Ltd. v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines, 
235 U.S. App. D.C. 207, 731 F.2d 909, 921-26 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (discussing overlapping bases for national legislative 
jurisdiction), or even that English courts might conclude that choice-of-law or comity principles require them, in appropriate 
cases, to enforce legal rights grounded upon United States statutes so long as those statutory rights are not inconsistent with 
English public policy. Cf. K.D.F. v. Rex, 878 S.W.2d 589, 593-96 (Tex. 1994) (discussing principles of comity concerning the 
enforcement of another sovereign's laws in the interstate context). However, Riley, Roby, Bonny, and Shell reinforce the 
conclusion that enforcement of the FS/COL clauses necessarily precludes Leslie's enforcement in England of any right arising 
under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act or the DTPA."
867,57," English law, apparently, is not far different. See The Bremen, 407 U.S. at 11 n.12, 92 S. Ct. at 1914 n. 12; Ted. L. Stein, 
Jurisprudence and Jurists' Prudence: The Iranian-Forum Clause Decisions of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, 78 AM. J. INT'L. L. 
1, 21-22 (1984) (comparing United States and English law). In Texas, courts are not ""bound by forum selection clauses if the 
interests of. . . public policy strongly favor jurisdiction in a forum other than the one consented to in the contract,"" particularly 
when a claim arises under the DTPA. See Greenwood v. Tillamook Country Smoker, 857 S.W.2d 654, 656 (Tex. App. -- 
Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, no writ); Pozero v. Alfa Travel, Inc., 856 S.W.2d 243, 244-45 (Tex. App. -- San Antonio 1993, no writ);

868,58," Lloyd's of course objects that the 1986 General Undertaking is not an adhesion contract. As a standard-form contract without 
negotiable terms, drafted by Lloyd's, and offered to Leslie on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, the revised General Undertaking is by 
definition an adhesion contract. See Carnival Cruise Lines, 499 U.S. at    , 111 S. Ct. at 1527; id. at    , 111 S. Ct. at 1530-31 
(Stevens, J., dissenting). "
872,59," As mentioned above, see supra note 45, the English Parliament has passed a specific act to counter extraterritorial application 
of the Sherman Act, including a ""clawback"" provision to counter treble damage awards. The Supreme Court in Hartford Fire Ins. 
Co. nevertheless held that international comity would not require United States courts to refrain from exercising Sherman Act 
jurisdiction. Lloyd's has not directed the Court's attention to any comparable English legislation intended to counter application of 
United States securities and consumer protection laws to English businesses conducting transactions in the United States. "
873,60," The Texas forum non conveniens statute applies only to personal injury or death actions filed in state court after September 1, 
1993. Therefore, it is not controlling in this case. "
879,1," The original plaintiffs were John, Jeannine, Gilbert, and Daniel Leonard. John Leonard has not appealed from the final order of 
the district court, and thus we need not decide the validity of the order of dismissal of John's claims with prejudice, which was 
entered after the notice of appeal was filed in this action. Defendants claim that because John Leonard's claims have been 
dismissed, his wife, Jeannine, has no interest in any sublicense and thus is not a proper party to this appeal. Because the 
complaint alleged that Mrs. Leonard did purchase interests in several of the sublicenses, Mrs. Leonard's claims do not depend 
upon the survival of her husband's. Thus, the defendants' suggestion that Mrs. Leonard is not a proper party to this appeal is a 
HN1[
] challenge to the federal courts' subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of her standing to sue these defendants. Such a 
challenge cannot be waived. See Smith v. County of Albemarle, 895 F.2d 953, 954 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 823 (1990); 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). However, the Pro Wear defendants admitted in their answer that Jeannine Leonard did purchase, with her husband, several 
interests in Pro Jersey kiosks, and the record evidence cited by the defendants to refute this jurisdictional fact does not establish 
that Mrs. Leonard owned no interest in any Pro Jersey location. Whether she owned an interest in each of them, as the 
complaint alleges, need not be decided here, because that is not a jurisdictional question but an issue to be proved on the merits 
of her claims. It is sufficient for purposes of determining jurisdiction that Mrs. Leonard has established without dispute that she 
owned some interest in the kiosks. We thus reject the challenge to Mrs. Leonard's standing to sue these defendants. "
883,2," The Appendix references relied upon by plaintiffs (J. A. 1120, 1127-35) do not support in fact that Pro Wear had otherwise 
contractually agreed to guarantee the plaintiffs' purchase of merchandise. "
892,*," The Honorable Wesley E. Brown, Senior District Judge, United States District Court for the District of Kansas, sitting by

892,1," The complaint also contained a tying claim under section 3 of the Clayton Act, which was dismissed as well; because PMBR 
does not pursue it in its opening brief, we deem it waived.  State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. Mhoon, 31 F.3d 979, 984 n.7 (10th 
Cir. 1994) (citing Headrick v. Rockwell Int'l Corp., 24 F.3d 1272, 1277-78 (10th Cir. 1994)). "
895,2," The practice exam within the BAR/BRI course and the practice exam in the separate Gilbert workshop had previously covered 
the same ground but with different exam questions. "
896,3," The district court also erred by relying, for its analysis of this section 1 issue, on Telex Corp. v. IBM Corp., 510 F.2d 894 (10th 
Cir.), cert. dismissed, 423 U.S. 802 (1975), a section 2 monopolization case."
896,4," Product improvements may be the cause and/or effect of changes in consumer demand, but the nature of that demand is what 
counts. "
898,5," Unfortunately for litigants, neither the Supreme Court nor we have taken a position on which of various cost measures is the 
definitive one, although we have spoken of marginal and average variable costs as being relevant. See Brooke Group, 113 S. 
Ct. at 2588 n.1; Instructional Sys., 817 F.2d at 648; Pacific Eng'g & Prod. Co. of Nevada v. Kerr-McGee Corp., 551 F.2d 790, 
797 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 879, 54 L. Ed. 2d 160, 98 S. Ct. 234 (1977)."
898,6," Separate from but closely related to the question of whether a defendant's acts are likely to succeed is the question of whether 
a defendant with a monopoly in one market would have any plausible reason to use its monopoly profits in that market to 
subsidize predation in a second market. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 596 (requiring a showing of plausible motive for predatory 
pricing and observing that ""a conspiracy to increase profits in one market does not tend to show a conspiracy to sustain losses in 
another""). Here, where PMBR has presented evidence that it was probably the most likely challenger to the Defendants' monopoly in the 
Colorado full-service market, we cannot say as a matter of law that Defendants would find it economically irrational to price 
below cost in the MBE market for the summer 1992 course as part of a larger scheme, employing tie-ins and schedule conflicts, 
to monopolize the supplemental market, in order to discipline PMBR for refusing to allocate markets and to deprive PMBR of the 
resources necessary to continue its full-service market incursions."
898,7," Although the record below is somewhat ambiguous, HBJL and CBR do not appear to seriously dispute on appeal that if the 
BAR/BRI-Gilbert package does comprise two separate products, then the relevant product for predatory pricing's cost-price 
analysis is the supplemental workshop, rather than the package. "
900,8," We recognize the split among the circuits regarding the legality of so-called ""monopoly leveraging,"" i.e., using a monopoly in 
one market to gain a competitive advantage in a second, where the purpose is not to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the 
second market. Compare, e.g., Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 275-76 (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 
444 U.S. 1093, 62 L. Ed. 2d 783, 100 S. Ct. 1061 (1980), with Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, Inc., 948 F.2d 536, 546-49 
(9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 977, 112 S. Ct. 1603, 118 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1992). Our case falls outside this debate, 
however, because PMBR has specifically alleged an attempt to monopolize the supplemental MBE workshop market."
900,9," It may seem contradictory that a product improvement motivation--at least without something more, such as demonstrated 
efficiencies--will not save an otherwise illegal tying arrangement under section 1, see Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 25 n.41, but it 
may still weigh in the balance in section 2 analysis. The two sections are distinct, however, and the section 2 balancing test is 
different from the analysis for per se offenses under section 1."
900,10," Professors Areeda and Hovenkamp, who argue for a rule of presumptive legality for all product changes, concede the possible 
anticompetitive nature of what they term ""implicit tying"" through product integration. See Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra P P738.1 
& 738.4. But they say an inquiry into whether a defendant's intent was actually to harm rivals, as distinct from making a better 
product, is difficult, costly, and usually pointless, because the evidence is frequently mixed or ambiguous. See id. P738.4e. And 
they say an objective appraisal of whether a product change truly is an improvement--let alone whether a given improvement 
could have been achieved with less harm to competition--will often be beyond the courts' competency and may seriously chill 
innovation. See id. P738.4f. We are sensitive to both the difficulties and the dangers of these inquiries. Where, as here, however, the claimed product 
improvement takes the form of a marketing change, rather than some complex technological integration of previously separate 
functions, our degree of deference to product designers is reduced. "
901,11," While the evaluations are not from Colorado students, neither side has suggested they are irrelevant because either the 
Gilbert course or the students taking it are different in Colorado than elsewhere. "
902,12," Defendants argued below that they had no duty to accommodate PMBR's scheduling. They analyzed the situation as a 
monopolist's refusal to cooperate with a competitor and read Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 
603, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985), as standing for the proposition that a monopolist has a duty to assist a competitor 
only where the monopolist has accommodated the competitor in the past and then abruptly terminates assistance. We do not 
necessarily interpret Aspen Highlands as narrowly as do the Defendants, but principles governing refusals to deal do not control 
here anyway. PMBR's complaint goes beyond merely alleging that Defendants refused requests to affirmatively accommodate PMBR's 
course. PMBR alleges that the Defendants deliberately created schedule conflicts to avoid helping PMBR, and in fact, to harm 
PMBR. Since the Defendants naturally would not create conflicts between their BAR/BRI full-service course and their own MBE 
workshop, Gilbert, see Plaintiff-Appellant's App. at 370 (Feinberg Aff. P 58), there is a triable issue as to whether schedule 
conflicts between BAR/BRI and PMBR's MBE workshop would disproportionately raise PMBR's costs. See Premier Elec. Constr. 
Co. v. National Elec. Contractors Ass'n, Inc., 814 F.2d 358, 368 (7th Cir. 1987) (citing Thomas G. Krattenmaker & Steven C. 
Salop, Anticompetitive Exclusion: Raising Rivals' Costs to Achieve Power Over Price, 96 Yale L.J. 209 (1986)). This would 
qualify as anticompetitive conduct unless HBJL and CBR could demonstrate a legitimate business justification for it. "
903,13," Professors Areeda and Turner, in their earlier, 1978 main volume, said some courts have required a showing that a defendant 
possessed a significant share of the target market at the time when the challenged conduct was undertaken, and they cite, inter 
alia, to one of our cases as standing for that proposition. See E.J. Delaney Corp. v. Bonne Bell, Inc., 525 F.2d 296 (10th Cir. 
1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 907, 47 L. Ed. 2d 758, 96 S. Ct. 1501 (1976) (cited in Areeda & Turner, supra P P 831, 835a). We 
do not read Delaney as clear support for such a rule, but even if it were, we would hold it distinguishable from this case, where 
the Defendants are accused of leveraging their monopoly power in a second market to gain a new monopoly in the target 
market."
903,14," The Defendants complain that PMBR arrived at the high market share for them by counting every sale of the Defendants' full-
service course as a sale of a supplemental MBE workshop after the Gilbert inclusion in the summer of 1992. But they do not 
show why this is conceptually wrong, at least for 1993, when the evidence shows that part of the fee increase charged to 
enrollees was to cover Gilbert costs, so that we can fairly call the Gilbert enrollments ""sales."" At any rate, we accept PMBR's 
numbers for summary judgment purposes. See Kodak, 112 S. Ct. at 2076-77. "
906,15," Although the 1990 settlement agreement released any claims PMBR might have had against HBJL based on pre-1990 
activities, PMBR contends that it still has a cause of action for that time period against CBR, which was not a party to the 
settlement. But even assuming that CBR is not protected by the 1990 release, PMBR's evidence that HBJL proposed or entered 
into market allocation agreements with other companies in other states in 1969, 1976, 1980, and 1989, without more, is simply 
too remote to furnish the basis for a conspiracy claim against CBR on grounds that CBR and HBJL, or their predecessors, 
allocated the Colorado and Wyoming markets in 1974, 1982, 1986, and 1988. (The latter dates are the years when CBR made 
or renewed its written license agreements.) "

911,2," We recognize the subtle distinctions that may alter an analysis from per se to the rule of reason and the potential blurring of 
those distinctions when faced with a combination such as we have here. See SCFC ILC, Inc. v. Visa USA, Inc., 36 F.3d 958, 963 
(10th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 2600 (1995) (No. 94-1719); see also 7 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust law PP 
1511, 1511' (1986 & Supp. 1994) (discussing the collapsing inquiry). We need not anatomize the precedents to crystallize their 
theoretical development, however. Suffice it to say that our analysis of the relevant economic structures and market forces at 
issue here makes it evident that this is not a situation requiring per se treatment. See generally National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n 
v. Board of Regents of the Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 104 n.26, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 (1984) (noting that ""per se 
rules may require considerable inquiry into market conditions before the evidence justifies a presumption of anticompetitive 
conduct""). Nor do the Associations' claims that the market power vested in the Foundation by the combination of its members 
represents a facility essential to competition. Given the apparent facial validity of the exclusion of the Associations by the 
Foundation, whatever restraint that exclusion poses must be analyzed under the rule of reason to determine the extent of its 
power and effect on competition. This will in turn answer the question whether indeed the Foundation is an essential facility and 
if any denial of access is truly anticompetitive in nature. See Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, PP 736.2a, 736.2f (Supp. 1994) 
(asserting that denial of access to an essential facility is never deemed per se unlawful). This is entirely consonant with the usual

944,9," Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been labelled horizontal restraints, and those 
imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints; thus the nature of a restraint is 
determined by the type of agreement that gives rise to the restraint rather than the anticompetitive economic effects of the 
restraint. See Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730 n.4, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1980)."

945,11," The per se presumption simply eliminates the plaintiff's burden of proving anticompetitive impact to the finder of fact through 
market analysis by an expert economist, as required under the rule of reason; it does not eliminate the need to find antitrust 
injury, nor does it relieve the plaintiff of its burden to identify and articulate the precise anticompetitive impact caused by the per 
se price-fixing violation. An antitrust injury flows from price-fixing agreements which plainly reduce competition. However, some 
price-fixing agreements do not ""restrain trade"" and are therefore reasonable.  Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 
U.S. 328, 339-40, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333, 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990). It is important to note, however, that ""the antitrust laws were 
enacted for 'the protection of competition, not competitors.'"" Id. at 338 (citing Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 
320, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962)). Thus, a competitor ""may not complain of conspiracies that set minimum [or 
maximum] prices at any level."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585, n.8, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106

prices), unless the dangers identified by Albrecht are present (i.e., the smaller competitor is eliminated from competition 
pursuant to the price agreement and distribution is then channelled ""through a few large or specifically advantaged dealers."").  
Atlantic Richfield, 495 U.S. at 327. Therefore, finding an agreement is only the first step; the agreement is not illegal under § 1 of 
the Sherman Act unless the nature of the price-fixing agreement reduces competition and injures dealers or consumers. Id. The 
Court must therefore carefully scrutinize the competitive effect of the price-fixing agreement alleged to be illegal per se. Because 
the presumption of injury eliminates the need for a plaintiff to produce an economist, this theoretical hurdle is now a question of 
law for the court on summary judgment. This Court is extremely cognizant of this important distinction, recently recognized by 
the Seventh Circuit in Israel Travel Advisory Serv., Inc. v. Israel Identity Tours, Inc., 61 F.3d 1250, Nos. 94-1451, 94-1554, 94-
1815, & 94-1816, 1995 WL 425224. *5 (7th Cir. July 20, 1995)(Easterbrook, J.)(""the antitrust injury doctrine applies with full vigor 
to the per se offenses"")."
945,12," An agreement to terminate a distributor without evidence of a related agreement on price is not sufficient to establish a per se 
violation. However, an agreement to terminate, if proven to have an anticompetitive impact, could be illegal under the rule of 
reason as a nonprice restraint. See Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at 724, 726. Nonprice restraints are not alleged in this case. "
946,13," Unlike Title VII cases, however, the Plaintiff cannot prove an agreement to conspire merely by showing that the defendants' 
assertions of independent conduct were a pretext for price-fixing and illegal termination agreements. "
947,14," In a footnote, the Court explained: The concept of a meeting of the minds or a common scheme [to fix prices] in a distributor termination case includes more 
than a showing that the [nonterminated] distributor conformed to the [manufacturer's] suggested resale price. It means . . . 
that evidence must be presented [by the plaintiff that shows] that the distributor [not only] communicated its acquiescence 
or agreement, [but] that this [acquiescence] was [also] sought by the manufacturer. Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 761 n.9. "
948,15," As a practical matter, it may be difficult to draw a distinction between direct and unambiguous circumstantial evidence, since 
the characterization depends upon the facts of an individual case. Cf. 6 Areeda, Antitrust Law § 1410 at 64 (""Direct evidence 
[of an agreement includes] such [things] as documents, meetings, and participant testimony that defendants exchanged 
commitments or otherwise collaborated by some means other than making a marketplace decision.""). In this case, the 
documents and testimony that will be reviewed do not manifest an agreement that is so obvious that the Court need not pause in 
reaching a decision under Section 1. Quite the contrary, the evidence in this case never exceeds the outer limit of ambiguity."

948,17," The Court has attempted to summarize the Plaintiff's most relevant evidence. The fact that every single piece of Plaintiff's

951,22," At most, the admissions on record indicate that Jeff Fox of Parts Unlimited felt it was necessary to point out to Logue that 
Tucker/Rocky's published prices were lower than those published by Parts Unlimited. This evidence, taken at face value, reflects 
only Parts Unlimited's complaint and general expectation, which it believed Dunlop should hear about, that Tucker/Rocky should 
raise its prices in 1993. Logue's subsequent and contemporaneous discussions with Nickell of Tucker/Rocky, and 
Tucker/Rocky's mysterious phone call to Parts Unlimited, while sufficient to raise a question in the factfinder's mind, do not tend 
to point in the direction of an agreement to fix prices. Without evidence regarding the subject of these conversations, the 
suspicious timing alone does not take plaintiff's Section 1 case past Monsanto."
951,23," Parts Unlimited claims that it issued the revised price list on March 19, 1993, rather than March 22, 1993. Because the portion 
of that memorandum (PX 444) dated March 19, 1993, is redacted, it is impossible for the Court to make this determination. 
However, the portion of the memo dated March 22, 1993, appears to confirm the revision just as well."
951,24," According to Plaintiff, Parts Unlimited had never before issued revised prices prior to publication of its next annual catalog and 
never before had its ""best quantity"" prices (the subject matter of the March 22, 1993, Gregg Letter) been the same as 
Tucker/Rocky's prices--they were generally lower. "
953,25," Interbrand competition means competition between different manufacturers; intrabrand competition means competition among

959,28," Nevertheless, the Court expressly notes that even the addition of this ambiguous evidence would not have altered the 
conclusions it has reached herein. "
961,29," Plaintiff suggests that the Court need not find evidence of an agreement to terminate Nichols, because an agreement to 
terminate discounting distributors like Nichols is sufficient. Although we agree with this proposition, there is no significant 
difference in this case between the two agreements, because an agreement does not exist under either theory."
961,30," During their depositions, both Fred Fox and Bob Gregg guessed what these conversations were about. Fox asserts that the 
February phone call involved a conversation between Jim and Sharon Ricci who left Parts Unlimited and were at that time 
talking to their prospective employer, Tucker/Rocky, in February 1993. Gregg speculates that the March phone call covered the 
subject of ""SBS brake pads."" Parts Unlimited was the exclusive distributor for these pads, and Tucker/Rocky wanted to sell 
them. 12(N)(3)(b) Reply at P 31(i); Transcript at 141. "
962,31," Conversely, an agreement to terminate Nichols, without a price agreement, would limit Nichols to a nonprice rule of reason 
claim which it has not asserted. "
964,32," Plaintiff's counsel admitted during oral argument that ""Dunlop would have an independent right to reduce distributors to shake 
out the market so long as it did not terminate Nichols pursuant to a conspiracy."" Transcript at 25. "
965,33," Thus, there is no need to consider whether the presence of the so called ""plus factors"" -- conspiratorial motivation and acts 
against self-interest -- support a conspiracy inference. See 6 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law §§ 1433-1434, at 218-221. "
966,34," The fact that neither Nichols, nor any other distributor, is ever mentioned in either the first page of the Gregg Letter, or the 
price analysis, indicates that Tucker/Rocky is responding to the complaints Dunlop received from Parts Unlimited regarding 
Tucker/Rocky's 1993 published prices. "
967,35," The Court must draw this inference, despite Parts Unlimited's ""credit inquiry"" theory, see Transcript at 131-32, because all 
reasonable inferences go to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party. "
968,36," Even if the March Gregg Letter constituted an agreement to terminate Nichols, it is not sufficient to state a per se claim under 
Section 1 of the Sherman Act, because it would at most constitute a nonprice restraint which, if it had an anticompetitive impact, 
would need to be tested under the rule of reason. Plaintiff has not alleged a nonprice restraint under the rule of reason, so the 
Court does not reach that question. "
969,37," The idea of applying a rule of reason analysis to a vertical price-fixing violation was discussed in Monsanto in a footnote, 465 
U.S. at 760 n.7, but was not ruled on because it was not raised at the district court level. The Court has not found any case since 
Monsanto that discusses this theory for recovery. "
975,38," The third measure of damages, lost sales on non-Dunlop products is not cognizable because Dr. Pisarkiewicz uses a 
statistical regression analysis to determine the percentage of Dunlop buyers who would also buy non-Dunlop products and the 
amount of these products that the buyers would purchase, without demonstrating evidence of a causal connection between the 
injury and the asserted damages. See, e.g., BASF Corp. v. Old World Trading Co., 41 F.3d 1081, 1093 (7th Cir. 1994) (finding 
causation to be established where the plaintiff presented evidence that many customers would not have purchased from the 
defendant had they known of the defendant's wrongdoing and that the plaintiff's position in the market would have been more 
advantageous absent the defendant's wrongful conduct); Alpo Petfoods, Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co., 778 F. Supp. 555, 560 
(D.D.C. 1991)(noting that statistical regression analyses, ""while useful for demonstrating general trends and the broad impact of 
certain actions, are simply not usable with respect to the type of specific, concrete evidence needed. Without the regression 
analyses, however, there is nothing in the record from which this Court can deduce a lost profits figure without speculation.""), 
aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 997 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1993); Nikkal Indus., Ltd. v. Salton, Inc., 735 F. Supp.

such as the possible effect on sales of a declining trend in the popularity of [the product], the appearance of several competitors, 
vigorous price competition and, most importantly, [the plaintiff's] poor marketing strategy.""). For example, Plaintiff would need to 
offer something along the lines of testimony from buyers who would have bought non-Dunlop products from Nichols who went 
elsewhere because of price discrimination on Dunlop products."
975,39," Both Tucker/Rocky and Parts Unlimited note that Dunlop's pricing structure was highly individualized and flexible, and that 
there was no way for them to determine independently the amount of the discounts that another distributor might be receiving.

entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). "
979,42," Note that the ""good faith"" response is only one part of the test. The other part of the test regards the objective and verifiable

999,2," One commentator argues that the difficulty in measuring market definition in health care cases is attributable to the structure 
and nature of the health care market and the dynamic changes that the health care market today is undergoing. He believes that 
the third-party payor system has made market definition difficult because it has eliminated both seller and buyer responsiveness 
to price, that the health care market lumps together a wide variety of services, some of which compete with each other and some 
of which do not, and that market definition must be based on historical data, but that, given the dynamic changes taking place in 
health care, the historical data often is not probative. Sylvia H. Walbolt, William McD. Miller III, Jeffrey Cross, Phillip A. Proger,

999,3," In assessing a possible product market of general acute-care inpatient hospital services, the focus is on the substitutability of 
alternative services that are competitive with inpatient care. According to economists, this question is divided into two inquiries. 
The first is to ask whether the consumers of inpatient care can easily turn to other services in lieu of inpatient care. If they can, 
then there is ""demand substitution""; i.e., ""inpatient care"" is too narrow a definition, and the relevant product definition should 
embrace the substitute service. The second inquiry is whether suppliers of services other than inpatient care could easily modify 
their activities to provide inpatient care. If so, then there is ""supply substitution"" and these suppliers should also be counted as 
competitors in the market because, even if they do not currently supply the relevant product, they would if the price rose slightly.

the Court defined a cluster market of central station protective services. Grinnell established that the cluster approach is not 
limited to market definition under the Clayton Act, the statute enforced in Philadelphia National Bank. The protective service 
clusters in Grinnell are supply substitutes although they are not demand substitutes. Jonathan B. Baker, The Antitrust Analysis

1002,5," According to one commentator, the most important factor limiting the geographic scope of markets for the services offered by 
hospitals is the unwillingness of patients to patronize hospitals far from their residences. The longer the distance a patient must 
travel, the farther his or her friends and relatives must also travel to visit him and the farther his or her physicians must travel. 
Long distances between home and hospital are disfavored because a patient may be forced by physical affiliations to switch 
doctors if he or she wishes to select a distant hospital. Physician preferences and affiliation are likely to count strongly in the 
patient's decision. Third party payers may also create financial incentives for patients to favor hospitals in a narrow geographic 
area. Jonathan B. Baker, The Antitrust Analysis of Hospital Mergers and the Transformation of the Hospital Industry, 51-SPG 
Law & Contemp. Probs. 93 (Spring 1988)."
1002,6," The Merger Guidelines hypothesize a ""small but significant and nontransitory"" price increase imposed by a hypothetical 
monopolist of the relevant product at the location of the merging parties. (1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 1.21.) If enough 
buyers would switch to alternative sellers, so as to make the hypothetical price increase unprofitable, the location of the alternate 
sellers would be included in the geographic market. The process is designed to identify a region within which such a hypothetical 
monopolist could profitably impose at least a ""small but significant and nontransitory"" increase in price. "
1003,7," One commentator explains why the Elzinga Hogarty percentage should be adjusted for overinclusiveness: Markets based on patient flows [the Elzinga Hogarty approach] may overstate the geographic markets relevant to antitrust 
merger analysis when the product market includes hospital services that are not perfect substitutes. In this case, those 
patients with strong preferences for obtaining services at distant hospitals such as many tertiary care patients… [may be 
willing to travel] even if most patients are unwilling to travel. A hospital market that includes these distant institutions will 
therefore encompass a region larger than the smallest region in which a hospital cartel could successfully collude….Distant 
hospitals can be excluded from the market even if a fraction of patients from the market obtain care there, so long as those 
patients traveling long distances obtain quantitatively different services from the services available nearby. Jonathan B. Baker, The Antitrust Analysis of Hospital Mergers and the Transformation of the Hospital Industry, 51-ZPG Law &

1004,10," The Cellophane Fallacy is described in a law review article: The prevailing price for cellophane [in United States v. E.I. du Pont Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 S. 
Ct. 994 (1956)] was arguably supracompetitive and…at that price consumers regarded a number of other flexible wrapping 
materials as good substitutes for cellophane…If consumers regarded these other products as good substitutes for 
cellophane at the prevailing, supra-competitive prices, then they probably would not have regarded them as good 
substitutes if cellophane were priced competitively. By charging a supra-competitive price, then, du Pont (the producer of 
cellophane) had already exercised most or all of its market power, i.e., it had raised the price of cellophane until other 
flexible wrapping materials were regarded as good substitutes…. The Court, then mistakenly interpreted du Pont's inability 
to raise its prices further as an indication that du Pont had no market power at all, rather than as an indication that du Pont 
had already exhausted its market power. Gene C. Schaerr, The Cellophane Fallacy and the Justice Department's Guidelines for Horizontal Mergers, 94 Yale Law Journal 
670, 677-78 n. 52 (1984-85). "
1005,," Schaerr argues that a monopoly price enlarges the geographic market because it expands the geographic area from which other 
sellers of the product and its substitutes could profitably transport their goods to customers of the merging firms. He explains: Suppose, for example, that widgets are produced in cities A,B, and C, and are sold for $ 1 in all three cities. Suppose also 
that it costs $ 1 to transport one widget from any city to any other, and that at prevailing prices it is not profitable for any 
producer to sell outside the city in which its widget plant is located. In this situation, each city is a separate geographical 
market. Now suppose that producers in city B form a cartel and in so doing raise the prices of widgets to $ 2.01. This 
makes it profitable for producers in cities A and C to transport widgets to city B, so that any market including producers in 
city B also includes producers in cities A and C. If producers in city B now merge, the relevant market will include cities A 
and C as well as city B. Schaerr, Cellophane Fallacy, supra, at 676, n. 42. Schaerr contends that ""such overstatement of the size of the market leads to 
understatement of the market power of the merging firms, and therefore to understatement of the anti-competitive consequences 
of the merger. (footnote omitted)"" Id. at 677. The Cellophane fallacy is not without its critics. Judge Posner of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has rejected 
this theory. See R. Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 128-29 (1976). "
1006,11," Given a product market of inpatient services and a geographic market of Santa Cruz County, plaintiffs' data indicates that 
Dominican had a market share in excess of 45% prior to acquisition and that, post-acquisition, Dominican controls approximately 
70% of the market. The HHI prior to the transaction was in excess of 3500 and after the acquisition, the HHI value is in excess of 
6400. (Melnick Declaration PP13 & 14). Defendant's relevant product market of hospital and non-hospital providers and 
geographic market of Santa Cruz, Northern Monterey and Santa Clara Counties produces an HHI index in the 1200 to 1300 
range. (McCarthy Decl. P59.)"
1006,12," In its opposition to defendant's motion for partial summary judgment, plaintiffs have, for the first time, alleged tying 
arrangements with health plans other than Secure Horizons. Defendants object on the basis that, after discovery is closed and in 
the middle of dispositive motions, plaintiffs should not be permitted to throw in any surprise theories they choose. Plaintiffs claim 
that the ""including but not limited to"" language in the complaint permits them to allege tying arrangements with other health 
plans. Defendant counters that the language relates to other forms of monopoly exploitation, not to tying arrangements with 
other health plans. Paragraph 24 of the complaint provides: ""After the Acquisition, DOMINICAN has engaged in willful acts to 
maintain, extend and exploit its monopoly power, acts which include, but are not limited to, the following…."" Plaintiffs proceed to 
enumerate six forms of monopoly exploitation. Paragraph 24(f), the only paragraph that refers to tying, provides: ""attempting to 
leverage its monopoly power in the acute care market by negotiating an agreement with a Medicare HMO, Secure Horizons, 
tying the purchase of hospital services to the purchase of exclusive physician services from PSI [PMG]."" The court sustains 
defendant's objection to the new allegations. It is unfair to defendants to permit plaintiffs, on the eve of trial, to allege tying 
arrangements with health plans other than Secure Horizons without having sought leave to amend their complaint. The court 
expresses no opinion as to whether Dominican has exploited its monopoly power by tying the sale of Dominican's services to the 
purchase of physicians' services from PMG with respect to PruCare, LifeGuard or any health plan other than Secure Horizons. "
1007,13," The provision at issue states: C. PacificCare [Secure Horizons] agrees that the cost of all medical and hospital services provided to Secure Horizons 
members who have selected Physician [sic] Medical Group of Santa Cruz will amount to at least eighty-six percent (86%) of 
premium through 1994, 85% in 1995, 84% in 1996 and 1997…In the event the cost of medical and hospital services does 
not amount to the above percentages, the excess will be paid to Physicians Medical Group of Santa Cruz. …. E. PacificCare and Hospital agree that the reimbursement provisions contained in this Attachment A apply only to Secure 
Horizons members who select Physicians Medical Group of Santa Cruz. Hospital agrees to consider other physician 
entities in the future based upon separate compensation provisions. (McNaughton Declaration, Exhibit I). Although the provision deals generally with the cost of services, there is no evidence of the actual effect of the provision. 
Plaintiffs fail to explain whether this requirement provides a substantial cost saving to Secure Horizons when its members select 
PMG, and if so, by how much the cost for members who do not select PMG exceeds the cost for members who select PMG. In 
any event, both parties characterize the provision as a pricing concession, and neither party disputes the fact that Dominican 
may be purchased separately from PMG. "
1008,14," In deposition testimony, Wayne Boss, plaintiffs' Rule 30(b)(6) spokesperson on the subject of plaintiffs' tying claim, stated that 
Health Net ""had a much better penetration of patient enrollees in the major employers in Northern California than Pacific Care 
[sic] did, [and] we felt it was appropriate to pursue the Health Net relationship for the commercial product, and entered into 
agreements with both Health Net and TakeCare to establish a Medicare at risk program through their plans rather than through 
Secure Horizons."" (Boss Depo. 60:10-17, Rosch Decl., Exhibit 4.)"
1008,15, Plaintiffs rely only on a per se tying theory and do not attempt to prove their theory on a rule of reason basis.
1008,16," Both parties recognize that the term PMG is used in the contract provision not to refer to Physicians Medical Group of Santa 
Cruz, but rather as an abbreviation for the generic term ""physicians medical group."" The specific PMG referred to here is Santa 
Cruz Medical Clinic. "
1009,17," Neither party argues that TakeCare or Dominican is currently requiring Santa Cruz Medical Clinic to refer all cardiac patients 
to Dominican. It is undisputed that it is Santa Cruz Medical Clinic's policy to refer cardiac patients to Good Samaritan Hospital 
except in emergencies. Santa Cruz contends that Dominican has refrained from enforcing the provision because of the instant 
lawsuit. Dominican maintains that the provision is unenforceable because Santa Cruz is not a party to the contract. "
1013,1," HN1[
]  AS 36.30.699 provides: In AS 36.30.560 -- 36.30.695, ""interested party"" means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose economic interest 
may be affected substantially and directly by the issuance of a contract solicitation, the award of a contract, or the failure to 
award a contract; whether an actual or prospective bidder or offeror has an economic interest depends on the 
circumstances. "
1014,2," Royal Contractors bid $ 7.57 per ton. Gunderson submitted the third lowest bid, at $ 8.18 per ton. ARRC bid $ 10.20 per ton, 
the fifth lowest bid. "
1015,3," Gunderson raised the following causes of action against UAF: (1) breach of contract; (2) breach of duty of confidentiality and 
expropriation of intellectual property; and (3) due process violations. "
1016,4," Thus Gunderson concedes that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine applies to his state antitrust law claims under AS 45.50.562-
.596 (Alaska Restraint of Trade Act). He also concedes that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine may bar a party from bringing related 
business tort and § 1983 claims. See Video Int'l Prod. v. Warner-Amex Cable Communications, Inc., 858 F.2d 1075, 1084 (5th 
Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 491 U.S. 906, 105 L. Ed. 2d 697, 109 S. Ct. 3189 (1989) (holding that HN5[
] conduct protected from antitrust liability under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is also shielded from business tort and § 1983 claims)."
1016,5," On appeal, Gunderson also contends that ARRC's protest falls within the ""sham"" exception because he was improperly 
excluded from the April 1992 hearing in violation of his due process rights. However, Gunderson did not present this argument to 
the trial court or include this issue in his points on appeal. Therefore it is waived. See Moran v. Holman, 501 P.2d 769, 769-70 
(Alaska 1972) (this court will not consider on appeal arguments which were not raised before the trial court or which were not 
included in statement of points on appeal). In any case, Gunderson makes no attempt to argue that ARRC affirmatively sought to exclude Gunderson from the hearing or 
that ARRC was involved in any way in the hearing officer's decision. As ARRC points out, in the absence of any such 
connection, Gunderson's exclusion from the hearing process has no bearing on its right to Noerr-Pennington immunity. "
1018,6," In a related argument, Gunderson contends that the superior court improperly ""assumed"" that the sole source contract was 
illegal under AS 36.30.300. Essentially, Gunderson is arguing that UAF should be able to award a sole source contract to a 
business which comes up with an innovative service, even if other businesses are equally capable of providing the proposed 
service. However, this argument has no bearing on whether ARRC is entitled to Noerr-Pennington immunity. Even if the superior 
court were to ultimately conclude that UAF could properly award Gunderson a sole source contract in these circumstances, 
ARRC would still be entitled to immunity as long as there was a legitimate basis for its protest. See Columbia Pictures,  [*330]  
113 S. Ct. at 1928 n.5 (noting that a losing lawsuit does not prove that the litigation was a sham). "
1019,7," Because we conclude that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine bars Gunderson's claims, we need not address the other grounds 
raised by ARRC for affirming the superior court's dismissal. "
1031,1," EDS also argues that Tricom should be judicially estopped from making a refusal to deal claim. The doctrine of judicial estoppel 
bars a party who has ""successfully and unequivocally"" argued a position in a prior court proceeding from taking an inconsistent 
position in a later proceeding.  Edwards v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 690 F.2d 595, 598 (6th Cir. 1982). The requirement that the party 
must have ""successfully"" asserted a prior position means that the party must have been successful in persuading the first court 
to expressly adopt the position.  Id. at 599. In other words, judicial estoppel does not prevent a party from contradicting itself, it 
only bars the party from contradicting itself where a court previously adopted the party's prior position. Teledyne Industries, Inc. 
v. N.L.R.B., 911 F.2d 1214, 1217-18 n.3. (6th Cir. 1990). The issue of whether Tricom asserted a refusal to deal claim was not 
previously expressly presented to the court, and thus the court did not expressly adopt any parties' position on the issue. Thus, 
judicial estoppel does not apply."
1031,2," This issue may come up at trial in the context of whether EDS has a business justification for tying its software to its mainframe 
and whether the tie is the least restrictive means for achieving its business purposes. See Mozart Co. v. Mercedes-Benz of N. 
Am., Inc., 833 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 102 L. Ed. 2d 148, 109 S. Ct. 179 (1988) (business 
justification is defense only if there was no less restrictive means to satisfy the legitimate business objective). "
1032,3," It should also be noted that Tricom does not seek to deprive EDS the value of its copyright. If EDS chooses to license its 
software to a designer, EDS sets the price for the license. Tricom merely claims that it should be able to compete with EDS in 
selling CPU time to the designer to enable the designer to use the software. Every designer who comes to Tricom wishing to use 
CGS on Tricom's mainframe would have to obtain the right to use the CGS software from EDS. "

Defendants assert that Miss. Code Ann. § 75-24-19 now governs the recovery of attorneys' fees and only allows recovery to the 
Plaintiff when a violation of section 75-24-5 is knowing and willful. Defendants further assert that Mississippi law only allows the 
recovery of attorneys' fees when provided by statute. Stokes v. Board of Directors of La Cav Improvement Co., 654 So. 2d 524, 
1995 WL 242266 (Miss. 1995). The Court need not address this issue as it is not necessary for a decision on the Motion to

requirements of the local Board of Health, Police and Fire Departments, and state and federal authorities, respecting the

1106,9," Although the Cieris and Query both relied on the principals announced in Eastern Star, they disagreed as to its application. The 
Cieris contended that, under HRS § 480-13, an award of attorneys' fees is mandatory and, therefore, must be included in the 
calculus of the ""greater amount"" of recovery dictated by Eastern Star; Query disagreed and argued that an award of attorneys' 
fees is not considered when determining the ""'greater amount"" of recovery. See infra section II.B. "
1108,10," An undercurrent in federal antitrust law, as hinted at by the above-quoted language from Northern Pacific, is, in the event of a

[conducive] to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions,""  Northern Pacific, 356 U.S. at 4, that the

1115,15," The Rewald investment case revolved around a pervasive local ""pyramid"" investment scheme in which earlier investors were 
paid with money obtained from subsequent investors.  In re Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald, Dillingham & Wong, Inc., 69 Haw. 523, 
525, 751 P.2d 77, 78 (1988). In Rewald, Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald, Dillingham & Wong, Inc. (the Rewald firm) held itself out as 
""one of Hawaii's oldest and largest privately-held international investment and consulting firms"" dealing only in ""secured, safe, 
non-risk"" investments. The Rewald firm was incorporated in 1979 and fifty percent of its stock was held by Ronald Rewald, who 
was the chairman of its board of directors and its treasurer. The remaining fifty percent was held by Sunlin Wong, its president. 
The Rewald firm guaranteed its investors a minimum twenty percent annual return on investments, and gathered more than 
twenty million dollars in five years, investing only a fraction of what was received. "
1116,16," Having concluded that the Cieris have standing to sue under HRS chapter 480 and that the trial court properly applied HRS 
chapter 480 to the present case, we need not reach the Cieris' argument that they are ""indirect purchasers"" and thus qualify as 
""consumers."" "
1118,17," We further agree with the Cieris' contention that Eastern Star differs procedurally from the present case in that, in Eastern 
Star, the trial court's verdict contained no fraud award and only a statutory award. The ICA thus had no choice but to remand for 
retrial on the fraud count. In contrast, the verdict in the present case contains findings both as to fraud and statutory recovery. 
Therefore, unlike Eastern Star, we need not remand the present action to the trial court for further proceedings. We need only 
affirm the trial court's judgment based on the jury's award on the statutory claim. "

1129,2," Even though Plaintiffs' Complaint will stand if either a per se or a ""rule of reason"" violation is properly alleged, the proof at trial 
may differ depending on which theory is pursued by Plaintiffs. See Phillip E. Areeda, Antitrust Law § 1728(b) (1991) (""The per 
se rule is . . . a shortcut that allows us to condemn a restraint as unreasonable without the usual inquiries.""). For that reason, the 
above-indicated bifurcated analysis will be undertaken."
1129,3," HN10[
] Courts in this Circuit have not been uniform in holding that anticompetitive effects in the tied market is a distinct 
element of a per se illegal tying claim. See infra, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14982, at *13-15. "
1131,4," The alleged advantage possessed by Defendant and not shared by its competitors in the tying product market was the 
opportunity to sell, separate from the sale of its entire business, a propane-handling facility in Suffolk County. (See Compl. PP 
12-15.)"
1131,5," The Court notes that the Complaint at issue merely alleges that a single purchaser (Audell) was ""forced"" with respect to the 
purchase of the tied items. If the total volume of propane and transportation services purchased by Audell was sufficiently 
alleged to have been ""not insubstantial,"" then arguably its plight would implicate the antitrust laws, notwithstanding Audell's 
status as a ""single purchaser."" See Areeda, supra note 2, § 1721 (""If the dollar volume meets the usual test, excepting the 
single-purchaser tie seems inconsistent with the logic of that test.""); but see Reisner v. General Motors Corp. 511 F. Supp. 1167,

se approach, under which several courts have found, and this Court agrees, that a restraint of trade is presumed. E.g., Car 
Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1108 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1054, 84 L. Ed. 2d 821, 105 S. Ct.

1139,1," The Court notes that, pursuant to an order of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (R.Doc. 238), Laitram has been granted 
leave to file a claim of infringement as to its patent number 4,862,794 (hereinafter the ""'794 patent""). Skrmetta's motion for 
summary judgment does not address this claim."
1139,2," This section provides, in pertinent part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint

Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
1141,4," In Matsushita, the Supreme Court stated: Respondents correctly note that HN6[
] ""on summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts . . . 
must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion."" But antitrust law limits the range of 
permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 1 case. Thus, . . . conduct as consistent with permissible 
competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy. To survive a 
motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict, a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of § 1 must present 
evidence that ""tends to exclude the possibility"" that the alleged conspirators acted independently. Respondents . . . in other 
words, must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action 
or collusive action that could not have harmed respondents. Id. at 587-88, 106 S. Ct. at 1356 (citations omitted). "
1143,5," The Court notes that Skrmetta does not object to the authenticity of any of the documents referred to herein as exhibits 
attached to Laitram's memorandum in opposition, presumably because they were produced in discovery. As such, the Court 
relies on them in finding that there are genuine issues of material fact under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The Court also notes that the three letters written to Laitram's customers also requested that these entities cease and desist 
from using Laitram's infringing equipment until they sign a license agreement SEDCO. (Exhs. 39-41, attached to Laitram's 
memorandum in opposition, R.Doc. 229.) Laitram alleges that Skrmetta participated in the conspiracy because Ray Skrmetta, 
among other things, provided the names of these customers to the Florida corporation's attorney. Id., Exh. 37. "
1144,6," As noted, these questions of fact include Ray Skrmetta's statement to G. Charles Lapeyre before the trade-secrets lawsuit was 
filed and -- according to the record -- before the letters at issue were sent Laitram's customers that ""we've got you."" (Affidavit of 
Lapeyre, paragraph 15, Exh. 2, attached to Laitram's memorandum in opposition, R.Doc. 229.) Another question of fact is 
Skrmetta's offer of ""all help possible"" to SEDCO's attorney. (Exh. 37, attached to Laitram's memorandum in opposition, R.Doc. 
229.) "
1145,7," The Court would reach the same decision if Skrmetta's contention were tested under the standard for summary judgment. 
Because there are genuine issues of material fact as to the extent of Skrmetta's participation in the publication of the letters to 
Laitram's customers, as set forth above, summary judgment would be improper on this issue. "
1148,1," Although plaintiff has labeled its present complaint a ""First Amendment Complaint,"" the court will refer to it as the amended 
complaint as it is the only amended complaint filed thus far. "
1149,2," Defendant interprets these allegations, contained in paragraph 21 of the amended complaint, to state that there are other 
manufacturers of filling machines in the market. The court does not find defendant's interpretation to be reasonable, however. 
The fact that defendant and plaintiff possess less than one-hundred percent of the market does not reasonably imply that any 
other manufacturer has a market share, especially when paragraph 21 expressly states that ""no other producers of filling/sealing 
machines have yet entered the market."" "
1150,3," Curiously, the sales agreement submitted as an exhibit to plaintiff's amended complaint shows a cost for that particular 
machine of $ 6,690 less a ten percent discount. "
1152,4," At this juncture it is important to reiterate that plaintiff has not alleged, as defendant suggests, that there were other 
manufacturers of filling machines in the marketplace. Paragraph 21 of the amended complaint expressly states that ""no other 
producers of filling/sealing machines have yet entered the market."""
1152,5," Interestingly, plaintiff has not alleged that any of defendant's conduct prohibits it from producing pill cards that would be usable 
with defendant's machine without any modification or template use. "
1160,1," Indeed, the plaintiffs may not be able to recover damages under RICO because their purported damages may not have been 
proximately caused by the defendants' actions but rather by the plaintiffs' failure to timely report the extortion to the authorities. 
See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp. et al., 503 U.S. 258, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532, 112 S. Ct. 1311 (1992) (Supreme 
Court found that HN4[
] the imposition of civil remedies pursuant to the RICO Act required the defendant's acts to be the 
proximate cause as well as cause in fact of the plaintiff's injuries). "
1161,2," In pari delicto means ""in equal fault"" and is a common law doctrine which bars a plaintiff's recovery due to his own wrongful 
conduct. This defense is grounded on two premises: ""first, that courts should not lend their good offices to mediating disputes 
among wrongdoers; and second, that denying judicial relief to an admitted wrongdoer is an effective means of deterring 
illegality."" Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. V. Berner, 472 U.S. 299, 306, 86 L. Ed. 2d 215, 105 S. Ct. 2622 (1985) (holding

1173,2," The Goings action was originally assigned to Judge Phaelzer in this district. On September 26, 1995, the Goings case was 
transferred to this Court."
1173,3," The Borgeson OSC was issued on August 31, 1995. However, the Goings action was not transferred to this Court's docket until 
September 26, 1995. Therefore, the Court's OSC only related to the Borgeson case. Because the Goings and Borgeson cases 
are fundamentally identical, this Court's Order will apply to both matters."
1173,4," On August 28, 1995, Defendant ADM filed Notices of Joinder in both of Staley's Notices of Removal (in the Borgeson and 
Goings actions). On August 28, 1995, Defendant Cargill filed a Notices of Joinder in Staley's Notices of Removal. On August 25, 
1995, Defendant CPC filed Notices of Removal in both actions. On August 30, 1995, Defendant CPC filed Notices of Joinder in 
Staley's Notices of Removal."
1173,5," On September 15, 1995, Plaintiff Goings joined in the Response by Plaintiff Borgeson to the OSC, supporting remand to state 
court."
1173,6," Because the Court finds this issue well briefed by the Parties, the Court has taken the matter under submission. "
1175,7," In their Notice of Removal, Defendant STALEY states that Defendant ADM is a Delaware corporation, when in fact, Defendant 
ADM is a Minnesota corporation. Notice of Removal, p.4, P 7. However, this misstatement is irrelevant for the purposes of 
determining diversity jurisdiction. "
1176,8," HN6[

courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties 
under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as 
plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising

1178,13," Defendant Staley's argument that the Court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the claims of the class members 
hinges on the additional argument that the named Plaintiffs meet the amount in controversy requirement. Defendant Staley argues that the amount in controversy requirement can be met for the named Plaintiffs in these cases by 
attributing all the attorneys' fees to them. Defendant Staley suggests that the Court should be persuaded on this issue by the 
Fifth Circuit's reasoning in Abbott, 51 F.3d at 526. This argument directly contradicts Ninth Circuit authority holding that 
attorney's fees must be attributed to each member on a pro rata basis, and more specifically that attorneys' fees cannot be 
agggragated for jurisdictional purposes. Goldberg v. CPC Int'l, Inc., 678 F.2d 1365, 1366-67 (9th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 
U.S. 945 (1982); Czechowski v. Tandy Corp., 731 F. Supp. 406, 409-10 (N.D. Cal. 1990). "
1179,," Staley asserts that Goldberg is no longer sound authority due to the Goldberg court's reliance on Zahn. As discussed above, 
Zahn is still good authority; therefore, so is Goldberg. Because the Court finds the doctrine of Zahn to be unaffected by the Act, 
thereby erasing any grounds for the extension of supplemental jurisdiction in this case, Defendant Staley's arguments on the 
subject of attorneys' fees are irrelevant."
1179,14," The Cartwright Act provides for group rights through the public cause of action. West's Ann.Cal.Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 16750 et 
seq. (1987). "
1180,15," Defendant Staley argues that Plaintiffs could amend their Complaints to ask for punitive damages in lieu of treble damages. 
But the Court is bound to evaluate jurisdiction based on the claims in the Complaints as they now stand. If in the future, Plaintiffs 
amend their Complaints to pray for punitive damages, and the Defendant believed that the Amended Complaint stated a basis 
for federal jurisdiction, then Defendant could seek to remove once again. The Defendants' right to remove would commence 
when first put on notice that federal jurisdiction might exist. Schwarzer, et al., P 2:666 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)). However, the 
Court is not presented with this question today."
1180,16," It has been argued that the Ninth Circuit impliedly gave its approval to the Northern District court's reasoning, but when the 
Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded that decision, the Ninth Circuit said only that the district court asserted ""jurisdiction on the 
basis of diversity of citizenship"" without stating whether jurisdiction was proper and if so, on which of the two (2) alternative 
grounds. In re: Northern Dist. of California ""Dalkon Shield"" IUD Products Liability Litigation, 693 F.2d 847, 849 (9th Cir. 1982), 
cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1171 (1983). "
1189,1, The case was reassigned to the undersigned Judge upon Judge Revercomb's untimely death. 
1190,2," Dr. Johnson's claims were filed against Greater Southeast as well as individually named defendants. At the time of the filing of 
the complaint, plaintiff had separated the individually named defendants into two classes. The first class -- ""Individual Non-
Medical Defendants"" -- included: Thomas Chapman, President of the Greater Southeast Community Hospital; Raymond Turner, 
M.D., President for Medical Affairs; Mary Lou Meyers, Vice President and General Counsel of Greater Southeast. Complaint P 
12. The second class of defendants -- ""Individual Medical Defendants"" -- included: Mahmood Mohamadi, M.D., Chairman of the 
Credentials Committee and member of the Hospital Board of Directors; Odell McCants, M.D., President of the Medical Staff; 
Victor Nelson, M.D. Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology; William R. Coyle, M.D., member of the 
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology; and Gail Van Wingerden, M.D., member the Department of Obstetrics and 
Gynecology. Complaint P 14. One final defendant -- Edward Hinman, member of the Hospital Board of Directors -- was not 
classified. Complaint P 13. Since the initiation of this suit, plaintiff's claims against Mr. Darr, Dr. Mohamadi, and Dr. Van Wingerden have been dismissed. 
Plaintiff's antitrust claims remain pending against Greater Southeast and all remaining defendants. Complaint PP 43, 47, 50. 
Plaintiff's civil rights were originally filed and remain pending against Greater Southeast, and individual defendants Chapman, 
Turner, Mayers, Hinman, McCants, and Nelson. Complaint PP 56, 61. Plaintiff's claim of tortious inducement to breach was 
originally filed and remains pending only against defendant Hinman. Complaint P 67. "
1191,3," The court rejected plaintiff's argument that the terms of the monitoring and supervision agreement constituted ""injury"" based on 
a finding that plaintiff had entered into the agreement voluntarily and that plaintiff had demonstrated neither temporary nor 
permanent damage to his practice as a result of compliance with the agreement. See Mem. Op., at 9."
1191,4," The D.C. Circuit declined to rule on the district court's denial of Dr. Johnson's motion for summary judgment because a court 
ordered denial of a summary judgment motion is not appealable. See Johnson, 951 F.2d at 1270. "
1194,5," In light of the court's dismissal of plaintiff's antitrust claims with respect to plaintiff's membership and privileges at Greater 
Southeast, on ripeness grounds, the court also shall deny all of defendant's pending motions for summary judgment on this 
issue as moot. "
1195,6," It should be noted that, even if plaintiff's antitrust claims were ripe for adjudication, the court would nevertheless be compelled 
to grant defendants' motion for summary judgment on all antitrust claims because plaintiff did not oppose any of them, except for 
defendants' motion for summary judgment on the grounds of HCQIA immunity. Although plaintiff opposed defendants' original 
motion for summary judgment, which was filed prior to the appeal, plaintiff did not oppose any of defendants' subsequent 
motions for summary judgment on all antitrust claims filed after the case was remanded to this court for further proceedings. 
Under local Rule 108(b), a court may treat an unopposed motion for summary judgment as conceded by the non-moving party."
1195,7," During this time, defendants also filed motions for summary judgment on the antitrust claims and a motion for summary 
judgment on plaintiff's claims against defendant Hinman."
1195,8," These four motions were: Motion of Defendants for Summary Judgment on Counts I, II, III, and IV of the Complaint; Motion for 
Defendants for Summary Judgment on Antitrust Claims For The Absence of Antitrust Injury; Motion of Defendants For Summary 
Judgment on Civil Rights Claims; and Motion of Defendant Edward J. Hinman, M.D., For Summary Judgment on Count VI. "
1196,9," In light of the court's denial of plaintiff's motion to file out of time, defendants' motion to strike plaintiff's late submissions on the 
civil rights issue is denied as moot. "
1197,10," The Supreme Court granted certiorari, but did not reach the merits of the decision. It simply vacated the judgment and 
remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of what impact the newly enacted Civil Rights Act of 1991 might 
have on the decision. In Gersman II, the court affirmed the district court's dismissal of plaintiff's § 1981 claims based on the 
Patterson decision. 975 F.2d 886, 887 (D.C. Cir. 1992). "
1198,11," 42 U.S.C. § 1985, also known as the ""Ku Klux Klan Act,"" was designed to deter the Klan from committing vile transgressive 
acts against the rights of African-American citizens. See Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 29 L. Ed. 2d 338, 91 S. Ct. 1790 
(1971). HN17[
] Subsections (1) and (2) prohibit acts that may prevent a federal law enforcement official from performing his 
duty or otherwise obstruct justice. Neither of these subsections is applicable to this case."
1198,12," HN18[
]  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) provides in pertinent part as follows: (a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer -- "
1199,," (1) to fail or refuse to hire or discharge any individual, or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his 
compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment . . . . Id. HN19[
] An ""employer"" is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b) as a ""person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees . . . ."" Id. HN20[
] An ""employee"" is simply ""an individual employed by an employer. . . ."" Id. at §"
1199,2000, e(f).
1199,13," Plaintiff acknowledged in his deposition that he has never been an employee of the Greater Southeast. See Dep. of Plaintiff, p. 
481. "
1200,14," Courts in other jurisdictions that have confronted this issue have reached the same conclusion. See, e.g., Mitchell v. Frank R. 
Howard Memorial Hospital, 853 F.2d 762 (9th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1013, 103 L. Ed. 2d 186, 109 S. Ct. 1123 
(1989) (holding that ""as a matter of law [plaintiff's] allegations that the hospital interfered with his relationships with his patients 
fail to state a claim for relief under Title VII.""); Beverley v. Douglas, 591 F. Supp. 1321, 1328 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (""[A physician's] 
relationship to her patients is not that of employer and employee -- and defendants accordingly are entitled to summary 
judgment on the Title VII claim.""). "
1202,15," Even if the court had jurisdiction to hear the matter, plaintiff's claim still fails as a matter of law because defendant Hinman 
engaged in his allegedly tortious conduct on behalf of Greater Southeast and therefore lacks the ""third party"" status required for 
this cause of action. See Press v. Howard University, 540 A.2d 733, 736 (D.C. 1988). In affirming the trial court's dismissal of 
plaintiff's tortious interference claim, the D.C. Court of Appeals stated: The individual defendants, all of whom were officers of the University, were acting as agents of the other party to the 
contract, and . . . the University through their actions could not tortiously interfere with its own contract. Id. at 763. The court's decision in Press is supported by ample authority. See Newman v. Legal Serv. Corp., 628 F. Supp. 535, 
541 (D.D.C. 1986); Donohoe v. Watt, 546 F. Supp. 753, 757 (D.D.C. 1982), aff'd, 230 U.S. App. D.C. 70, 713 F.2d 864 (1983); 
Wilmington Trust Co. v. Clark, 289 Md. 313, 327-330, 424 A.2d 744, 754-755 (1981); W. Keeton, Prosser and Keeton on the 
Law of Torts § 129, at 990 (5th Ed. 1984). "
1217,1," After the hearing, this Court also found Mr. Kortsch in contempt of Court for violation of his obligation under Local Rule 
111.1(b). "
1218,2," Although the parties refer to the motion raised by Defendants at the close of Plaintiffs' case-in-chief as a ""motion for directed 
verdict,"" the 1991 amendments to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 abandoned the term ""directed verdict"" in favor of the more 
precise term ""judgment as a matter of law."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) Advisory Committee's Note (1991 Amendment). However, 
because the parties have employed the ""directed verdict"" terminology, the Court, rather than standing on linguistic formalities, 
adopts the parties' terminology when discussing this motion. "
1221,3," Although Boyle does not address this concern, the case upon which Boyle relies, City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 
119-20, 108 S. Ct. 915, 921-22, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988), specifically notes that the party claiming error in a jury instruction had 
raised and preserved the relevant legal issues by filing a pretrial motion for summary judgment, a motion for directed verdict, and 
a motion for judgment notwithstanding the law. The opposing party thus was put on notice, both before and during the trial, of 
the issues involved in the dispute over the jury instruction. Defendants here cannot show that Plaintiffs were similarly apprised of 
Defendants' most recent argument. Cf. Graham v. Davis, 279 U.S. App. D.C. 341, 880 F.2d 1414, 1420 (D.C. Cir. 1989) 
(distinguishing Praprotnick on the ground that the party objecting to jury instructions had at best raised the underlying legal 
issues by submitting proposed instructions during the trial that stated the law differently)."
1221,4," Plaintiffs also contend that argument IV above -- i.e., that Plaintiffs failed to exhaust internal union remedies -- should not be 
addressed by this Court. The Court agrees, but for a different reason discussed later in this opinion. "
1222,5," HN8[
] Section 411(a)(5) of the Act states: No member of any labor organization may be fined, suspended, expelled, or otherwise disciplined except for nonpayment 
of dues by such organization or by any officer thereof unless such member has been (A) served with written specific 
charges; (B) given a reasonable time to prepare his defense; (C) afforded a full and fair hearing."
1222,6," This assumes that § 411(a)(5) has some relevance to this case, a proposition that will be explored later in this opinion. "
1224,7," HN9[
] Section 411(a)(4) states: No labor organization shall limit the right of any member thereof to institute an action in any court, or in a proceeding before 
any administrative agency, irrespective of whether or not the labor organization or its officers are named as defendants or 
respondents in such action or proceeding, or the right of any member of a labor organization to appear as a witness in any 
judicial, administrative, or legislative proceeding, or to petition any legislature or to communicate with any legislator: 
Provided, That any such member may be required to exhaust reasonable hearing procedures (but not to exceed a four-
month lapse of time) within such organization, before instituting legal or administrative proceedings against such 
organizations or any officer thereof: And provided further, That no interested employer or employer association shall directly 
or indirectly finance, encourage, or participate in, except as a party, any such action, proceeding, appearance, or petition. "
1225,8," In an effort to determine whether the ""Teamster spokesman"" quoted in the Detroit Free Press article truly was a spokesperson 
for the Union, the reporter who wrote the article was subpoenaed to testify concerning the source of the comment attributed to 
that spokesperson. After a hearing, the Court found that the reporter could not be compelled to divulge his source, and the 
reporter refused to do so voluntarily. Because the comment in the article was offered both for its truth -- i.e., that the purpose of 
the state lawsuit was to ""temper"" Plaintiffs -- and to show union complicity in the lawsuit, and because, pursuant to the Court's 
ruling, neither basis for admission could be established, the Court excluded the article on both foundation and hearsay grounds."
1225,9," In particular, the Court reasoned that ""public figures usually enjoy significantly greater access to the channels of effective 
communication and hence have a more realistic opportunity to counteract false statements [than] private individuals normally 
enjoy."" 418 U.S. at 344, 94 S. Ct. at 3009. "
1226,10," Indeed, if a heightened standard of proof were to apply at all, it would seem that it would have applied to Defendants' 
defamation claims against Plaintiffs, because the individual Defendants, as union officers, arguably are ""limited purpose"" public 
figures. See Gertz, 418 U.S. at 351, 94 S. Ct. at 3013."
1226,11, Counsel for Defendant Local 243 appeared to abandon this argument at the hearing on this matter.
1226,12," It should be noted that at trial Defendants neither requested a jury instruction to this effect nor objected to the instruction 
actually given. "
1227,13," Those allegations were based on a provision in the NLRA defining unfair labor practices by an employer. See HN12[
]  29 U.S.C. § 158(a). That provision states, in relevant part: It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer-- (1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed in section [7 of the Act];"
1227,*," * * * * (4) to discharge or otherwise discriminate against an employee because he has filed charges or given testimony under this 
Act. Section 7 guarantees employees ""the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, . . . and to engage in 
other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection."" 29 U.S.C. § 157. "
1230,14," Moreover, the availability of a malicious prosecution cause of action under state law does not render unnecessary a claim 
under Title I of the LMRDA. As noted by the Court in Bill Johnson's: Dual remedies are appropriate because a State has a substantial interest in deterring the filing of baseless litigation in its 
courts, and the Federal Government has an equally strong interest in enforcing the federal labor laws. The Federal 
Government need not rely on state remedies to ensure that its interests are served."
1230,461," U.S. at 747 n.14, 103 S. Ct. at 2172 n.14. "
1235,1," The motion of the California Cable Television Association to file an amicus curiae brief on behalf of appellants is granted. The 
brief submitted on May 2, 1994 is deemed filed."
1235,2," These so called ""private customers"" live in private or gated communities represented by homeowner associations. The 
associations enter into contracts with cable television operators to provide service throughout the communities. The associations 
are billed directly for cable service and typically pass the costs onto the individual residents as part of the monthly dues."
1235,3," HN1[
] California Business and Professions Code § 17043 provides in relevant part: ""It is unlawful for any person engaged in business within this State to sell any article or product at less than the cost thereof . . . . for the purpose of injuring competitors or 
destroying competition."" "
1236,4," Section 543(a) of the 1984 Cable Act provides that ""any Federal agency or State may not regulate the rates for the provision of 
cable service except to the extent provided under this section."" 47 U.S.C. § 543(a) (1988). In the 1992 Act, the wording of the 
clause was changed slightly and recodified as § 543(a)(1). That section reads in part: HN4[
] ""no Federal agency or State may 
regulate the rates for the provision of cable service except to the extent provided under this section and section 532 of this title."" 
47 U.S.C. § 543(a)(1) (Supp. IV 1992)."
1236,5," Other cases relied upon by appellants are also distinguishable, as noted by the district court, because they do not concern 
statutes of general applicability. See, e.g., Westmarc Communications, Inc. v. Conn. Dep't. of Pub. Util. Control, 807 F. 
Supp. 876 (D. Conn. 1990) (involving an order affecting rates directly aimed at a cable company); Housatonic Cable Vision v. 
Dep't of Publ. Util. Control, 622 F. Supp. 798 (D. Conn. 1985), and Comcast Cablevision, Inc. v. City of Sterling Heights, 178 
Mich. App. 117, 443 N.W.2d 440 (Mich. 1989) (involving fees unrelated to rates for the provision of cable services)."
1236,6," The theory of implied preemption, not argued by the appellants, is nevertheless unavailable here because ""implied antitrust 
immunity is not favored, and can be justified only by a convincing showing of clear repugnancy between the antitrust laws and 
the regulatory system."" United States v. Nat'l Ass'n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., 422 U.S. 694, 719-20, 45 L. Ed. 2d 486, 95 S. Ct. 2427 
(1975). Appellants have failed to make that showing. "
1237,7," Appellants note that § 27 appears only as a note in the codification of the laws. However, it is undeniably part of the Statutes at 
Large, since it was approved by the Committee and the full Senate, and is part of the ""Congressional Findings and Policy for 
Pub. L. 102-385."" The district court properly decided that § 27 ""cannot be relegated to the status of legislative history simply 
because it is not codified in the United States Code."" See, e.g., Chicago Professional Sports Ltd. Partnership v. National 
Basketball Ass'n, 808 F. Supp. 646 (N.D. Ill. 1992) (citing section 27 as support for the proposition that state antitrust acts are 
not preempted)."
1237,8," The context of the remarks in the Congressional Record is as follows: MR. METZENBAUM: The third matter that has been of concern to me has to do with the question of whether or not this act 
would in any way provide an exemption from the antitrust laws. The amendment [§ 27] makes it clear that cable companies will 
still be fully subject to the antitrust laws. The amendment is actually needed because S. 12 [the 1992 Cable Act] contains provisions which are designed to prevent 
anticompetitive conduct by cable companies and some cable companies might very well argue that Congress intended to have 
the procompetitive regulatory provisions of S. 12 serve as a substitute for the antitrust laws. This amendment will prevent 
needless litigation over this issue by clarifying that the antitrust laws still apply in full to the cable industry. "
1238,," . . . It is my understanding that this amendment is in accord with the intention of the managers of the bill, and if that is the case, I 
am prepared to move forward with this amendment. MR. INOUYE: Madam President, the amendment before us is the result of over 10 hours of discussions and consultations 
involving the distinguished Senator from Ohio, several members of the committee, and countless numbers of staff people. We have studied the amendment very carefully, and we find that it is acceptable. MR. DANFORTH: Madam President, after discussing this matter with Senator Metzenbaum earlier in the day, we have 
discussed it with the staff of the Judiciary Committee . . . The amendment is not objectionable . . . THE PRESIDING OFFICER: The amendment (No. 1518) was agreed to."

1243,1," The combined generating capacity of CAPCO members prior to construction of the plants was approximately 13,000 
megawatts, and CAPCO anticipated that the new plants would add an extra 4,500 megawatts.  5 N.R.C. at 143. "
1244,2," Ohio Edison Co., 36 N.R.C. 269, 280 (1992). At the request of the Licensing Board, this question was formulated in a joint 
statement filed by the parties. They agreed that if Licensees prevailed on this issue, the Board would then hold a second, 
evidentiary proceeding to assess whether the power produced by Licensees' facilities was, in fact, higher in cost than available 
alternative sources. If Licensees did not prevail at the first stage on the legal question, the proceedings would terminate prior to 
a determination of the comparative costs of available power sources.  Id. at 280-81."
1244,3," Although the NRC did not parse any further the meaning of the parties' joint articulation of the ""bedrock"" issue, we assume the 
cost of power from ""alternative"" sources means sources that are available to Licensees' purchasers. See, e.g., 34 N.R.C. at 254 
n.80 (Prehearing Conference Order) (""bedrock"" issue involves comparison of ""actual facility costs for Davis-Besse and Perry"" 
plants with ""non-nuclear power costs""); 36 N.R.C. at 279 (comparison of ""cost of electricity generated at a nuclear facility"" with 
""that from other competing sources""); 36 N.R.C. at 291 (comparison of cost of electricity produced by nuclear facility with that of 
""rival producers""). It should be noted that at oral argument, counsel for the Licensees contended that the NRC should have examined another 
variable in considering the ""bedrock"" issue: the cost of alternative sources of power, coupled with other factors such as their 
reliability and accessibility. Licensees did not explore this issue in their briefs, and were in fact able to point to only one oblique 
reference in their reply brief to this expanded definition of ""alternative."" It might be the case that if other utilities have not only 
cheaper sources of power, but also equivalent reliability and access to transmission facilities, more expensive power from a 
nuclear plant could not pose a competitive threat and § 105(c) conditions would not be needed. That question, however, was not 
considered by the NRC, and it is not before this court now. "
1245,4," HN5[
] In addition, we may consider a provision's legislative history in the first step of Chevron analysis to determine whether 
Congress' intent is clear from the plain language of a statute. See, e.g., American Scholastic TV Programming Found. v. FCC, 
310 U.S. App. D.C. 256, 46 F.3d 1173, 1180 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing Associated Gen. Contractors v. California State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983)); Ohio v. United States Dep't of the Interior, 279 U.S. App. 
D.C. 109, 880 F.2d 432, 450 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (""We next examine the legislative history … to ascertain if there are any 
countervailing indications to our conclusion and also to check on [whether] certain parts of the history are inconsistent with our 
conclusion and so render the statute ambiguous within the meaning of Chevron.""). Because the legislative history of § 105(c) is 
not dispositive even for purposes of determining whether the NRC's interpretation was reasonable, see infra part II.B., we do not 
discuss it further here. "
1246,5," Although the Commission's decision spoke of § 105(c) as ""requiring"" a traditional antitrust analysis under a ""plain meaning"" 
reading, its lengthy opinion treated fulsomely why such a multifaceted economic analysis was necessary to give meaning to the 
provision.  36 N.R.C. at 287-306. We note that the NRC also argued in its brief to this court that it should prevail under both the 
first and second steps of Chevron. In those circumstances, we are authorized to affirm the Commission under a Chevron step 
two analysis, despite our rejection of the Commission's Chevron step one argument. See GMC v. National Highway Traffic 
Safety Admin., 283 U.S. App. D.C. 151, 898 F.2d 165, 171-72 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (reviewing court may resolve statutory 
interpretation question under Chevron step two analysis without remand where agency has woven ""policy and administrative 
concerns"" into its textual and historical arguments)."
1246,6," Licensees initially appeared to make a ""changed circumstances"" claim before the NRC. Later, though, they clarified their intent 
to abandon that line of argument and focus solely on the ""bedrock"" legal issue. Although of course we do not consider the 
viability of a changed circumstances argument here, Licensees remain free to raise such a claim in a subsequent application 
proceeding. "
1247,7," Our determination that § 105(c) does not require the NRC to focus solely on the cost of nuclear power accords with the position 
of the one other circuit that has considered the scope of the NRC's antitrust authority under § 105(c). In Alabama Power Co. v. 
NRC, owners of a nuclear plant argued that the NRC could examine only the direct activities of a licensed plant in assessing 
whether antitrust conditions were appropriate, rather than evaluating prior anticompetitive activities by the licensee as well.  692 
F.2d 1362, 1367-68 (11th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 816 (1983). The court held that a § 105(c) analysis necessitates a

exhausted all administrative remedies as to its claim regarding the NRC's authority to consider suspension requests, and the 
Commission issued a final ruling on this specific issue when it denied Cleveland's appeal from the Licensing Board's decision.

55,000 kw. Purchasing 55,000 kwh of power at an excess cost of $ .04 per kwh would result in a total excess cost of $ 2200 per

] Federal courts should avoid interfering in 
prison administration whenever prisoners are inconvenienced or suffer de minimis injuries. See, for example, Hernandez v.

103 S. Ct. 897 (1983), the Supreme Court of the United States set forth a flexible, case-by-case standard for resolving an 
antitrust standing issue and emphasized that courts should consider the following factors: (1) a causal connection between an 
antitrust violation and harm to the plaintiff, (2) an intent by the defendants to cause the harm, (3) the existence of an antitrust 
injury, (4) the directness of a causal link between the injury and the market restraint, (5) the speculative nature of the damages, 
and (6) the risk of duplicate recoveries or complex apportionment of damages. Subsequently, in Amey, Inc. v. Gulf Abstract & Title, Inc., 758 F.2d 1486, 1496 (11th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1107, 89

1334,5," There is a split among the circuits as to whether monopoly leveraging is illegal and, thus, whether such a claim can be asserted

1349,1," Citing Winks v. Feeney Oil Co., 731 F. Supp. 322, 327 (C.D. Ill. 1990), Khan asserts that State Oil has already conceded that 
its first notice was defective by issuing the second notice. The court respectfully disagrees with the Winks court. The court will 
not imply that a franchisor concedes a defective first notice when it issues a complying second notice. By punishing the issuance 
of a correct notice, the incentive for franchisors' to correct possibly defective notices would be removed."
1349,2," Khan's response to State Oil's motion states: In the action before Judge Norgle prior to its remand, State Oil moved for summary judgment, which was denied by Order 
dated May 12, 1993. Judge Norgle found that the January 27, 1993 Notice of Termination . . . was not reasonable nor 
justified under the circumstances. (Pls.' Mem. In Opp'n to Summ. J. at 4.) Khan seems to ignore the court's later opinion and order remanding the case to the 
Circuit Court of DuPage County, which explains: "
1350,," The court has not already made a finding that State Oil's original notice of termination was defective or unreasonable. The 
court in its May 12, 1993 minute order on State Oil's motion for summary judgment found only that State Oil failed to 
convince the court that providing ninety-days notice would not have been reasonable as a matter of law. The court did not 
conclude the opposite: that ninety-days notice would not have been unreasonable, or that the five-day notice was itself 
unreasonable. That issue may thus be revisited. State Oil v. Khan, 839 F. Supp. 543, 544 n.1 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (Norgle, J.) (emphasis added)."
1350,3," In part, the court's order states as follows: As a matter of law, the mere appointment of a receiver by the Circuit Court for the 18th Judicial Circuit did not constitute a 
termination of the contract between the parties. Generally, appointment of a receiver does not determine the rights of the 
parties. Rather, a receiver acts as an officer of the court, managing the property for the benefit of both parties. First Nat'l 
Bank of Vandalia v. Trail Ridge Farm, 143 Ill. App. 3d 244, 251, 97 Ill. Dec. 371, 492 N.E.2d 1030 (5th Dist. 1986); see also 
People ex rel. Scott v. Pintozzi, 50 Ill. 2d 115, 277 N.E.2d 844 (1971); In re marriage of Pick, 167 Ill. App. 3d 294, 299, 118 
Ill. Dec. 53, 521 N.E.2d 121 (2d Dist. 1988) (purpose of receivership is to prevent injury and avoid injustice). The decision to appoint a receiver lies within the discretion of the court. Asset Guar. Reinsurance Co. v. American Nat'l 
Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 254 Ill. App. 3d 713, 627 N.E.2d 179, 194 Ill. Dec. 63 (Ill. App. 1st Dist. 1993). State Oil's 
mere petition for a receiver could not have served as a termination of the agreement. Rather, it was the court's discretionary 
decision that placed Plaintiff's property in receivership. The court's appointment of a receiver was not a termination of the 
franchise agreement by State Oil. September 11, 1995 (Doc. # 72). "
1351,4," The PMPA specifically provides that the court, rather than a jury, shall determine whether exemplary damages or attorney fees 
should be awarded. 15 U.S.C. § 2805 (d)(2)-(3). No case or statute recognizes a mere defective notice, without alleged injury, as 
a violation entitling a plaintiff to fees or exemplary damages. Accordingly, Khan has set forth no facts which could give rise to 
such an award."
1351,5," As a precursor to its antitrust discussion, the court notes the ambiguity of much of the current antitrust case law: The courts . . . [have]. . . spawned an enormous body of interpretations and judgements without great uniformity or 
consistency. Almost any term in a contract that was alleged in one decisions to be . . . ""anticompetitive,"" and thus illegal, 
has been found in another decision to be legal. Armen A. Alchian & William R. Allen, Exchange and Production: Competition, Coordination & Control 272 (3d ed. 1983). The 
standards of summary judgment loom heavily in the face of this ambiguity. The court acknowledges the challenge of 
demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact under such circumstances."
1351,6," Vertical price-fixing involves an agreement to set retail prices between a retailer and a wholesaler, as opposed to an agreement 
between two wholesalers or two retailers (horizontal price-fixing). See Black's Law Dictionary 1400 (5th ed. 1979). "
1352,7," Under the ""per se"" analysis, a violative provision is one which makes ""the likelihood of anti-competitive conduct so great as to

99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 (1988) (citation omitted). "
1360,*," The Honorable Samuel P. King, Senior United States District Judge, for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation. "
1364,1," While we were considering this opinion, we learned that the Federal Circuit decided a parallel case, FilmTec Corp. v. 
Hydranautics, 67 F.3d 931, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 28215, 1995 WL 599982, (Fed. Cir. 1995) (petition for rehearing pending). In 
that case, the district court had denied Hydranautics' motion for leave to amend its answer to the patent infringement case to 
assert an antitrust counterclaim, because the motion came too late. The case had gone through judgment, appeal, and 
spreading of the appellate mandate, before the motion to amend was filed. The Federal Circuit held that the delay was 
excusable, because until Hydranautics defeated the patent claim, it had good reason not to file the antitrust claim. The Federal 
Circuit nevertheless affirmed the denial of leave to amend, because the antitrust claim would have been futile under the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine. We do not decide whether the case at bar is distinguishable, on the ground that FilmTec's alleged fraud would render FilmTec's 
patent infringement claim objectively baseless. The Federal Circuit held that as a matter of law, FilmTec's case was not 
objectively baseless, but said ""there is no dispute over the facts."" In the procedural posture of the case before us, it would not be 
correct to say that there is no dispute as to the facts. Hydranautics alleges fraud, and FilmTec denies it. We must assume for the 
purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) that Hydranautics could prove that FilmTec obtained the patent fraudulently. Nor do we decide 
whether the issue of objective baselessness is res judicata, on account of the Federal Circuit case. These questions should, if 
raised on remand, be decided in the first instance by the district court. "
1369,1," The Court granted SWI's request that its reply memorandum be treated as its response to Water 1's motion for summary

the fact that SWI has had several months to conduct discovery."

acquiring 15% or more of a company's voting stock (thereby becoming an ""interested shareholder"") may not engage in any 
business combination, including a merger, for three years after becoming such, unless that person obtains or has obtained 
certain approvals by the Board of Directors, or the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not 
owned by the interested HN3[
] shareholder. See 8 Del. C. § 203."
1414,6," Article Ninth, entitled ""Certain Business Combinations,"" is designed to impede coercive and inadequate tender offers. It 
prohibits certain business combinations by any ""interested shareholder"" (defined to include any person who directly or indirectly 
owns 20% or more of the outstanding voting power of Wallace, or an affiliate or assignee thereof), unless the affirmative vote of 
at least 80% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding shares of Wallace stock is obtained. D.I. 1, PP 34, 35. Like 
the poison pill, Article Ninth was in place years before the initiation of the Moore tender offer."
1414,7," Testimony at the November hearing was to the effect that financing had been obtained, with a commitment for the same 
extending to December 11, 1995. "
1415,8," The fee arrangement negotiated between Wallace and Goldman merits a brief description at this point, since Moore argues that 
the compensation arrangement biased Goldman in favor of finding inadequacy. Under the provisions of the arrangement, if 
Wallace remained independent, Goldman would receive $ 500,000 initially, plus additional $ 1.5 million increments, up to a total 
of $ 8 million. If Moore's $ 56 tender offer succeeded, Goldman would receive 6.2% of the total amount of the offer, up to 
approximately the same $ 8 million. However, because the fee is structured on a percentage scale, Goldman would obviously 
receive more than the $ 8 million if the eventual offer was for a price over $ 56 per share."
1415,9," The report prepared for the August 14th presentation differed from that prepared for the August 11th presentation, because the 
latter contained two assumptions which were inconsistent with one another, yielding an incorrect result. "
1416,10," A major asset of Wallace is its recently-developed computer system known as the ""Wallace Information Network"" (""WIN""). The 
WIN system is a set of computer programs that links together several other Wallace systems, such as its order entry, order 
management, manufacturing, inventory management, distribution and billing systems, for the purpose of delivering services and 
assisting the customer, as well as reducing costs. Tr. 220. The benefits WIN provides largely accrue to large, out-source 
customers because it enables them to control inventories, manage accounts and identify items for consolidation Moore's internal 
documents reveal that (1) the WIN system is a superior system; (2) Moore entered into an agreement with Electronic Data 
Systems in a bid to engage in a technological catch-up which has not been successful, Tr. 60; and (3) Wallace has been beating 
Moore in head-to-head competition for large, forms-intensive customers with multiple locations."
1416,11," The Wallace Board is entitled under its poison pill to redeem the rights or make the poison pill inapplicable to the offer and 
proposed merger by an amendment to the rights agreement. D.I. 1, P 30. The Board is also empowered under Article Ninth to 
avoid the shareholder vote requirement by approving the transaction by a majority vote of the Board. Id. P 36. Finally, the Board 
has the right to opt out of Section 203's protection under Delaware law. Id. P 31. While the court notes that Moore also seeks to 
compel Wallace to make inapplicable Article Ninth of its Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and opt out of the protection of 8 
Del. C. § 203, Moore's briefs submitted before and after oral argument confine its discussion to the poison pill. Additionally, no 
portion of oral argument was devoted to these defenses. Accordingly, the Court will so limit its discussion. "
1417,12," The ""entire fairness"" standard of review applies ""where a self-interested corporate fiduciary has set the terms of a transaction 
and caused its effectuation."" AC Acquisitions Corp. v. Anderson, Clayton & Co., 519 A.2d 103, 111 (Del. 1986). A reviewing 
court must review the transaction and determine that the merits satisfy the court of its entire fairness, id., including scrutiny of 
both ""fair dealing"" and ""fair price."" Mills Acquisition Co. v. Macmillan, Inc., 559 A.2d 1261, 1280 (Del. 1988). The ""entire fairness"" 
standard applies ""only if the presumption of the business judgment rule is defeated,"" Grobow v. Perot, 539 A.2d 180, 187 (Del. 
1988) (citing Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 812-17 (Del. 1984)), due to allegations of board self-dealing. See, e.g., Unitrin Inc. 
v. American Gen. Corp., 651 A.2d 1361, 1372 (Del. 1995) (""The Court of Chancery concluded that the Board's implementation of 
the poison pill and the Repurchase Program, in response to American General's Offer, did not constitute self-dealing that would 
require the Unitrin Board to demonstrate entire fairness.""). Since there are no allegations in the present case of an interested 
transaction, this standard is inapplicable and will not be discussed. "
1419,13," HN21[
] A ""coercive"" offer is a term of art used to describe an offer which has the effect of compelling shareholders to tender 
their shares out fear of being treated less favorably in the second stage. A classic example of a coercive offer is a partial, front-
loaded tender offer In that case, a shareholder might elect to tender immediately, since he cannot be guaranteed the same 
terms should he elect not to tender and the tender offeror succeeds. At that point, as a minority shareholder, he might be treated 
adversely. A ""noncoercive"" offer, on the other hand, is one which does not create that compulsion. An example of a noncoercive 
tender offer would be an all shares, all cash, fully negotiable tender offer, where all shareholders are treated equally, no matter "
1420,," when they tender. For a detailed explanation of these terms, see City Capital Assoc. v. Interco Inc., 551 A.2d 787, 797 (Del. Ch. 
1988)."
1420,14," In an effort to delineate different types of threats for the purposes of Unocal, the Time Court quoted the collected views of 
commentators as set forth in Ronald J. Gilson & Renier Kraakman, Delaware's Intermediate Standard for Defensive Tactics: Is 
There Substance to Proportionality Review?, 44 Bus. Law. 247, 267 (1989). Types of threats include the following: HN24[
] (i) opportunity loss . . . [where] a hostile offer might deprive target shareholders of the opportunity to select a 
superior alternative offered by target management [or, we would add, offered by another bidder]; (ii) structural coercion, . . . the risk that disparate treatment of non-tendering shareholders might distort shareholders' tender 
decisions; and (iii) substantive coercion, . . . the risk that shareholders will mistakenly accept an underpriced offer because they disbelieve 
management's representations of intrinsic value. Time, 571 A.2d at 1153 n.17. "
1421,15," Characteristic of the opinions of Wallace Board members as to the future success of the company is the following excerpt from 
the testimony of Mr. Doyle: I think that Wallace, personally, is the epitome of what a successful American company ought to be. If we go back to the 
middle sixties, Wallace decided that it would change basically -- would start to change from being basically a manufacturing 
and production company to a sales/marketing-oriented company that was very customer-oriented. It has -- today, it is, in my 
judgment, the best company in its field with respect to technology. It has an exceptionally dedicated and high-morale work 
force. It has a good experienced management. It has an excellent balance sheet with very little debt and a large cash 
position. It's in a -- in a market where many of its competitors are in trouble and, therefore, Wallace has great opportunity 
for success over the next five, ten years. Tr. 459-60. "
1422,16," For example, in the Business Forms Division, fiscal 1995 actual growth rate was 21%, as compared to its projected growth 
rate for fiscal 1996, at 14% and for fiscal 1997, at 10%. The same conservative approach was taken with other segments of 
Wallace's business. In its Continental Division, the 1995 actual growth rate was 24%. Its projected growth rates for fiscal years 
1996 and 1997, respectively, were 17% and 15%. Similarly, in its TOPS Division, the actual growth rate for fiscal 1995 was 45%, 
while its projections for fiscal 1996 and 1997 were, respectively, 14% and 5%."
1422,17," For example, Mr. Cronin testified that some of the markets in which Wallace is engaged are declining. The business forms 
industry is predicted to decline between 3% and 5% per year, according to industry analysts. Tr. 317. Thus, a declining market 
would probably require Wallace to predict declining sales and profits growth in that area."
1422,18, The following series of numbers excludes takeover-related costs.
1422,19," Moore argues that these increasing numbers demonstrate a phenomenon other than Wallace's continued success in the 
business. In particular, Moore argues that the recent strike at Ampad, a Wallace competitor, caused Wallace to receive a 
percent of the industry's business it would otherwise not have enjoyed. Second, Moore argues that Wallace's unexpected ability 
to pass on the increase of paper costs to customers yielded unexpected profits. The Court is unpersuaded, in light of the fact 
that Wallace is so well-positioned in the industry with its technologically advanced computer services system, that these external 
events were the primary cause of Wallace's upward growth trend."
1422,20," On November 20, 1995, Wallace reported results from the first quarter of fiscal 1996 as follows: Wallace Computer Services, Inc. . . . reported that sales for its first quarter ended October 31, 1995 increased 35.4 percent 
to $ 214.4 million compared to $ 158.4 million for the first quarter last year. Before takeover expenses, net income rose 
65.6 percent to $ 19.3 million compared to $ 11.6 million last year, and earnings per share rose 63.5 percent to 85 cents 
compared to 52 cents per share achieved in fiscal 1995. These results exceeded the company's most recent forecast and 
all analyst projections. D.I. 181, at Exh. A."
1422,21," The Court also recognizes that these increases in growth have been somewhat retarded by the pendency of the Moore bid. As 
Wallace's November 20, 1995 press releases states, ""the hostile takeover bid was delaying the signing of some new contracts, 
and in its absence, results could be even higher."" D.I. 181 at Exh. A. "
1423,22," The eight-person Wallace Board is comprised of two insiders, Cronin and Dimitriou (the former Chief Executive Officer treated 
as an insider), and six independent directors. The independent directors are successful businessmen with proven track records. 
Mr. Doyle has held positions as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer and a member of the 
board at various major domestic corporations. Mr. Olsen is the former President of IGA, a wholesale and retail grocery company. 
Mr. Canning is the former President of the Walgreen Company, a drug retailer. Mr. Lane is Chairman of both General Binding 
and Lane Industries. Mr. Ewers is the former Executive Vice President of Wrigley, a chewing gum manufacturer. Mr. Sterns is 
the former President of a major company. Suffice it to note that all the members of the Wallace Board have substantial 
experience in serving as high level executives and board members. There was no evidence that Wallace management had 
either the ability or desire to influence the thinking of the independent directors with respect to the adequacy of the offer. "
1426,23," The Wallace Board also had concerns as to whether the acquisition of Wallace by Moore would violate federal antitrust law. 
Although this Court has, for preliminary injunction purposes, concluded that it would not, as appears infra, one cannot say there 
was not legitimate substance to this concern. If there were antitrust standing, it is unknown what result would obtain after a full-
blown trial. "
1430,24," Forms-intensive has been described by one Wallace witness as referring to either the significance of the form within the 
customer's organization, or to the volume of forms within the organization, or both. Testimony of Michael Leatherman, Tr. 255. "
1432,25," An econometric study is the ""use of statistical techniques to analyze economic data."" Testimony of Jerry Hausman, Tr. 541."
1432,26, Jobbers have been described as forms distributors that do not manufacture the forms they distribute. Tr. 179. 
1441,27," The parties have not argued for the Court's consideration of the relevant product market under the U.S. Department of Justice 
Merger Guidelines (""Merger Guidelines""), which call for analysis of factors similar to some noted in Brown Shoe. Courts have 
frequently looked to these Merger Guidelines (most recently promulgated in 1992) as an advisory aid in determining the relevant 
product market, see 57 Fed.Reg. 41552 (1992); see e.g., Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co., 414 F.2d at 524; Ansell Inc. v. Schmid, 757 F. 
Supp. at 475. Because neither party has advanced evidence or data supporting a relevant product market using Merger 
Guideline analysis, the Court will refrain from considering whether the Merger Guidelines would have yielded that same 
conclusion as reached under decisional law. However, as discussed infra, Moore has offered evidence under the Merger 
Guidelines as to the effects of a Moore-Wallace merger on competition within the relevant market. "
1443,28, Relativity of harm to the plaintiff and defendant has been combined into one factor in the text. 
1452,1," Courts talk loosely about a particular state law or action as not being preempted because it does not affect the relations 
between primary ERISA entities when suits are brought by third parties against the plan. Thus Hospice of Metro-Denver v. 
Group Health Insurance, 944 F.2d 752, 756 (CA 10, 1991) a health care provider was not preempted from bringing suit against a 
benefit plan for failure to make promised payment for services rendered. cf DiPietro-Kay v. Interactive Benefits Group, 825 F. 
Supp. 459, 462 (D. Conn. 1993). Actions of this type may have an economic impact on the plan but they don't affect the actual 
structure of the plan and its administration - the plan has been already set up and operates and there is simply a claim that it 
violated legal rights given to outside parties that such parties would have against any other entity to which they delivered 
services of a similar nature. "
1454,2," I will not discuss the other reasons advanced by the defendant as a non-ERISA basis for granting its motion as to the fourth 
count. Failure to establish this preliminary element warrants the granting of the motion. "
1462,1," Conflicting evidence was presented on many of the matters set forth in this section. Generally, the facts are recited in a manner 
favorable to the jury's findings and the judgment rendered."
1462,2," Each of these clinics is a separate corporation. The record is unclear regarding the relationship between American Chiropractic 
and these other clinics. There is evidence showing that they shared a common payroll account and had joint staff meetings."
1462,3," In his brief, Liechty states that he was the sole shareholder of ACC."
1462,4," Throughout the trial, the parties referred to Spence being made a ""partner."" However, it is clear that the parties were 
contemplating a sale of 50% of the stock of American Chiropractic to Spence. We will follow the parties convention and speak in 
terms of partnership."
1462,5," Spence also testified that at the time of the meeting with the bank, he had already decided that he was not going to become a 
partner with Liechty due to ""other factors."" He later recanted this and testified that he would have become a partner had 
acceptable financing been available. "
1463,6," Appellants do not challenge the trial court's modification of the noncompetition provision and we express no opinion on it. Over 
Spence's objection, the jury was not advised of the trial court's modification of the geographical scope of the noncompetition 
agreement. "
1464,7," HN4[
] Section 15.05(a) of the business and commerce code is interpreted consistent with section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust. DeSantis v. Wackenhut, 793 S.W.2d 670, 687 (Tex. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1048, 112 L. Ed. 2d 775, 111 S. Ct. 755 
(1991); see TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.04 (Vernon 1987) (Texas antitrust laws ""shall be construed in harmony with 
federal judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes . . . ""). The supreme court has referred to section 15.04 as 
legislative mandate.  Abbott Labs., Inc. v. Segura, 907 S.W.2d 503, 505 (Tex. 1995). Thus, we will rely on federal authority to 
supplement the available Texas authority on antitrust issues."
1464,8, All future references will be to the Texas Business and Commerce Code unless otherwise indicated.
1464,9," HN6[
] ""The rule of reason"" and ""rule of reason"" are terms of art in securities law. The terms refer to the test used to evaluate 
restraints of trade which are not per se violations of antitrust laws. "
1465,10, Section 15.50 provides: 
1466,," Notwithstanding Section 15.05 of this code, a covenant not to compete is enforceable if it is ancillary to or part of an otherwise 
enforceable agreement at the time the agreement is made to the extent that it contains limitations as to time, geographical area, 
and scope of activity to be restrained that are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the 
goodwill or other business interest of the promisee. Because the trial court reformed the geographical scope of the subject non-competition agreement and because ACC makes no 
argument on appeal on the basis of section 15.50, we express no opinion as whether section 15.50 affects this case beyond 
being an indicia of legislative intent and public policy. See DeSantis, 739 S.W.2d at 688 n.9."
1466,11," However, an argument could be made that the product was chiropractic physicians. See Bhan, 929 F.2d at 1413. As will be 
shown below, we need not determine which product(s) is in issue as it would not affect our disposition of Spence's antitrust 
claim."
1466,12," The record does contain evidence showing that most patients obtain their chiropractic care within five miles of their homes. 
However, as Spence did not present any evidence establishing the availability of chiropractic care generally in Dallas or around 
the Mesquite clinic, that was no evidence of anticompetitive effect on the relevant market. Further, the evidence showed that a 
number of patients Spence treated at the Mesquite clinic sought and obtained chiropractic care from Spence outside the ten-mile 
noncompetition area and outside Dallas. Spence testified that his patients would travel ten miles to see him."
1466,13," In his appellate brief, Spence discusses certain billing practices and treatment plans ACC used with various insurance 
companies and patients. Spence's position is that these billing practices and treatment plans were improper in that they resulted 
in excessive charges and unnecessary treatment. Spence asserts, ""the jury could have concluded that ACC was better able to 
pull off such a scheme if it avoided competition from the departing doctors who were aware of it."" There is no evidence linking 
the subject practices to ACC's market power, the noncompetition agreements, or the cost or availability of chiropractic care in 
the relevant market; therefore, the practices were not evidence of anticompetitive affect on the relevant market. "
1467,14," With respect to fraud, the jury was charged as follows: Do you find that Paul Liechty or ACC fraudulently induced Spence into going to work or continuing to work for ACC under the 
Employment Agreements? You are instructed that a ""fraudulent inducement"" has occurred in this case if you find each of the following elements: (1) One or more promise was made; (2) The promise(s) was false; (3) The false promise(s) was made with no intention to perform at the time it was made; (4) The promise(s) was made with the intention that Spence act on it; and (5) Spence justifiably acted in reliance on the promise(s), to his detriment. "
1468,," The jury answered the question affirmatively as to Liechty and American Chiropractic. The above question encompassed 
misrepresentations which might have been made before Spence began working for ACC and representations made after he 
began work there which induced him to remain."
1468,15, Either finding is supported by the evidence and the charge as submitted. 
1469,16, ACC challenges the amount of damages the jury awarded for fraud in its fourth point of error. 
1471,17," Spence's employment contract provided for either a fixed rate of compensation or a percentage of his billings once they were 
collected, whichever was greater. At trial, ACC took the position that it was not obligated to pay Spence for billings attributable to 
him that were collected after he stopped working for ACC. Spence took the contrary position and prevailed. "
1472,18," ACC did object to a jury question on attorneys' fees. However, it appears the objection was to a question which was not 
submitted to the jury in the final charge. ACC objected as follows: Plaintiff objects to Question No. 12 because attorneys' fees have not been properly pleaded for this claim. Defendant pled 
general attorneys' fees without making reference to any statute whatsoever, certainly not to this statute, and this issue should 
not be submitted as a result of the insufficient pleading. In the final charge, question number twelve addressed whether ACC knew the noncompetition clause was unreasonable. ACC's 
objection seems to have been with respect to an issue on fraud in a stock transaction. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 
27.01(e) (Vernon 1987). In his cross-point of error, Spence complains of the trial court's refusal to submit an attorneys' fees 
question pursuant to section 27.01(e). "
1473,19," We also note that Spence obtained judicial modification of the noncompetition agreement. Attorneys' fees are recoverable for 
a promisor who prevails in obtaining modification of a noncompetition agreement. TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 15.51(c) 
(Vernon Supp. 1995). "
1487,1," Throughout the course of this litigation, CSU has levelled accusations of monopolistic activity based on internal Xerox 
documents pertaining to ISO competition. While certainly relevant to CSU's antitrust claims, these documents do not 
affirmatively establish misuse by Xerox of its copyrights. "
1491,1," Plaintiff CBS is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands. CBS owns three FM radio 
stations in the Eastern Caribbean on the island of Tortola. Plaintiff Korngold is a U.S. citizen and resident, and is president and

1491,4," Defendant CCC is a limited liability company organized pursuant to the laws of Montserrat, West Indies. CCC owns and 
operates an FM radio station on the island of Montserrat. CCC's corporate headquarters is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin."
1491,5," Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act provides that ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 
U.S.C. § 1 (1982). Section 2 of the Sherman Act supplements section 1 by dealing with the end product of unreasonable 
restraints, namely, monopolization. Section 2 declares that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or 
combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several 
States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony. . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2 (1982)."
1491,6," Count 1 alleges that CCC disseminated false and misleading information about its radio network, in violation of Section 43(a) of 
the Lanham Trademark Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1124(a). "
1492,7," Although there are three Motions to Dismiss filed by three separate Defendants, this Court will only address the Motions to 
Dismiss filed by C&W and WI. These two motions are identical and have been consolidated for the purpose of opposition and 
reply. When referring to both Defendants, the Court will refer to them as ""C&W."" Judge Harold Greene's Order of December 22, 
1993 mandated that ""no opposition or reply directed to the pending motion to dismiss filed by CCC need be filed unless and until 
the Court, by further order entered after the Court's ruling on the motions of C&W and WI to dismiss the complaint, sets dates for 
such opposition and reply."" (Order at 2). Therefore, Defendant CCC's alleged violation of the Lanham Act will not be considered 
herein."
1492,8," Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982, 15 U.S.C. § 6a, provides that the Sherman Act is inapplicable to conduct 
involving foreign commerce, except U.S. import commerce, unless the conduct has a ""direct, substantial, and reasonably 
foreseeable"" adverse effect on commerce in the U.S. or on the export commerce of U.S. businesses. See also Matsushita Elec. "

604 F. Supp. 256, 261 n.23 (D.D.C. 1984)."
1493,9," An antitrust plaintiff must allege harm to competition, not just harm to itself as plaintiff; any other rule ""would raise the specter of 
an antitrust action being used as a remedy for any tortious conduct during the course of competition."" Havoco of Am., Ltd. v. 
Shell Oil Co., 626 F.2d 549, 558 (7th Cir. 1980); see also Hunt v. Crumboch, 325 U.S. 821, 826, 89 L. Ed. 1954, 65 S. Ct. 1545

in interstate commerce)."
1493,10," Plaintiffs' only connection to U.S. commerce is that some of their broadcasts from Tortola are heard by some listeners in the 
U.S. and that some U.S. advertisers purchase time on their stations. Such a de minimis connection to U.S. commerce is not 
sufficient to justify jurisdiction. "
1495,11," Plaintiffs' reliance on the sole proprietorship of CBS was not asserted in the original complaint; rather, it was raised only by 
way of opposition to defendants' Motion to Dismiss."
1495,12," Despite the assertion in Plaintiff's Opposition that CBS did not exist until 1989 as an incorporated entity (Opposition at 37), the 
Complaint states that CBS, not Korngold, was the applicant for licensing in 1984. Complaint at P 35. "
