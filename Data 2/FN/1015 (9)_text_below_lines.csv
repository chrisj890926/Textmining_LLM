lease and/or operation of numerous other service stations in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. R.1, Complaint, at P 7. Although the final sentence of this paragraph arguably alleges the existence of other State Oil dealers, it 
is clear from the record in this case that Khan did not present the case to the district court on this theory. The summary judgment 
record is devoid of any evidence suggesting that other State Oil dealers also are subject to the price restraint challenged by 
Khan. Because the case was not presented to the district court on the theory that the restraint had been imposed by multiple 
wholesalers or upon multiple dealers, we do not view this unsupported allegation in Khan's complaint as sufficient to make this 
case factually analogous to Albrecht. "

93,7," As discussed more thoroughly below, no genuine issue of material fact exists. In this regard, it should be noted that although 
MSL continues to seek further discovery, thus far in this litigation, there have been 44 depositions taken, many of them over 
multiple days, in 14 states and two countries. Moreover, more than 100,000 pages of documents have already been produced. "
94,8," See also Sanjuan v. American Bd. of Psychiatry and Neurology, 40 F.3d 247 (7th Cir. 1994) (Easterbrook, J.) (rejecting an 
antitrust claim brought against a trade association that declined to ""certify"" the plaintiff-doctors)."
94,9," An excerpt from Mr. Velvel's deposition aptly states the school's position: Question: And it is your belief that the reason that the students are less interested in the school today is because they 
cannot be admitted to the bar in states other than Massachusetts? Answer: I am certain of it to a moral certainty, Mr. Pritikin. I think there is no legitimate doubt about it. I don't think that all the 
fancy lawyers and economists in the world would ever be able to remotely prove the contrary 'cause the contrary is not true. (Velvel Dep., 8/25/95, at 30:1-15; Velvel Aff., 3/22/95, at P23(a); Compl. P18). "
95,10," MSL also contends that it has suffered two additional injuries -- in an effort to treat its hardworking faculty fairly, to maintain 
faculty morale, and to ""have any chance of accreditation,"" MSL raised the salaries of its professors and bought more books for 
its library. (Velvel Aff., 3/22/95, P41(a); Pl.'s Surreply Br. in Further Opp'n to ABA's Mot. for Summ. J., at 3-5). MSL admits that, 
notwithstanding the increase, its starting salaries lag behind those at ABA accreditated schools. Despite this fact, MSL has 
consistently maintained that it has a highly skilled and ""hardworking"" faculty. (Complaint P 12; Velvel Aff., 3/22/95, P41(b)). 
Therefore, although it contends that ABA's standards have artificially inflated faculty salaries, MSL admits that it has been able to 
avoid some of these high costs without sacrificing quality. Thus, rather than injuring MSL, ABA's standards have provided it with 
a competitive advantage -- it can spend less on faculty than ABA schools and still purchase quality teaching services. Moreover, 
as these additional ""injuries"" result from MSL's unilateral decisions, I find that they are not an appropriate basis for potential ABA 
antitrust liability."
95,11," MSL also contends that the cases like Noerr are inapposite because they involved situations where the plaintiff's injury 
resulted from governmental adoption of allegedly anticompetitive doctrines, while in the instant case the state governments have 
merely relied upon ABA's accreditation decisions and not officially adopted the ABA's standards. This argument also misses the 
mark. In Sessions Tank Liners, although many local governments formally adopted the challenged standards into law, in some 
cities and towns, the standards were enforced not through explicit codification, but rather by having local officials refuse to issue 
permits for structures or activities that were inconsistent with the code. 17 F.3d at 296. In these cities and towns, the 
governments accepted the conclusions that the standards produced without explicitly adopting the standards themselves. See 
Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P204 at 75-76 (1994 Supp.). This is identical to the instant case, where government has 
accepted the conclusions that ABA's standards produce without explicitly adopting the standards themselves. The alleged injury 
in both circumstances, however, is the same: graduates are precluded from being admitted to the practice of law in certain 
jurisdictions. As discussed, this injury results from a governmental, not private, decision and cannot therefore give rise to 
antitrust liability. "
96,12," I note that any stigma that MSL suffered as a result of ABA denying accreditation must be viewed in context. Since authorizing 
MSL to grant degrees, the administrative council in charge of educational standards in Massachusetts has repeatedly expressed 
concern over many aspects of MSL's educational program. In fact, in January of 1994, the council threatened to revoke MSL's 
degree-granting authority unless MSL could demonstrate that its admissions standards were reliable. (Ex. D in Supp. of ABA's 
Mot. for Summ. J., p.2; Fallon Dep. at 54:6). The council was concerned that MSL was matriculating unqualified students so as 
to finance its more qualified ones. The council also expressed concern over the unprecedented number of formal written student 
complaints filed against MSL. (Fallon Dep. at 15:20-17)."
96,13," This conclusion is strengthened by the Ninth Circuit's language in Sessions. Discussing Noerr, the Ninth Circuit wrote that: The Noerr Court also rejected the proposition that petitioning immunity was limited to injuries flowing directly from 
governmental action. It held that the railroads were also shielded from liability for the harm the truckers suffered in their 
relationships with their customers. In the Court's view, that injury was ""incidental"" to the defendant's campaign to influence 
legislation. Sessions, 17 F.3d at 299; see also Allied Tube, 486 U.S. at 499."
96,14," MSL has presented some evidence which might be construed to mean that ABA has attempted directly to persuade potential 
students to attend accreditated schools. For example, Mr. Velvel has testified that: The ABA accreditors thus possess a monopoly not only because in most states it is necessary to graduate from an ABA 
school in order to take the bar examination and practice law, but also because by continuous efforts they have persuaded 
potential law school applicants, employers and the public that ABA accreditation is a sine qua non of quality and should be 
regarded as essential even in states (like Massachusetts) where the graduates of an unaccreditated school such as MSL 
can take the bar examination and practice law. "
97,," Here Velvel is not talking about injury to MSL, but to the reason why he feels ABA has an accreditation monopoly. He goes on, 
however, Many other persons who would otherwise apply to and attend MSL will not do so even though they wish to practice law in 
Massachusetts, where MSL graduates can take the bar examination and practice law. The reason [these people] will not 
apply to MSL is that the ABA has persuaded them and others that a law school cannot be a quality law school if it is not 
ABA accreditated . . .. (Velvel Aff., 3/22/95, at P27, P28(a) (emphasis added)). This statement merely points out what the ABA contends are the benefits of its accreditation product. While the corollary of 
attending an accredited school is not attending a school that has not been accredited, the injury remains incidental to the 
government's action. There is nothing wrong with the ABA's marketing its product -- nothing wrong with its contending that its 
evaluation process provides benefits to prospective students and to the profession. The fact that various states agree does not 
make what ABA does unlawful."
97,15," MSL reasons that if extended to its logical extreme, this First Amendment analysis would protect ""discussions by price fixing 
conspirators about the reasonable level at which prices should be adhered to in the marketplace . . .."" (Pl.'s Resp. to Def. ABA's 
Mot. for Summ. J. at 30). However, the problem with MSL's reasoning here is that the illustration that it cites as the ""logical 
extreme"" involves conduct -- conspiring to fix prices. In fact, in order for a conspiracy to fix prices to be actionable, there must be 
an overt act. United States Anchor Mfg., Inc. v. Rule Indus., Inc., 7 F.3d 986 (11th Cir. 1993). This act or conduct is not protected 
by the First Amendment. MSL concedes as much when it states that this First Amendment rationale ""can fare no better than an "
98,," argument that the restrictive trade association activities involved in Allied Tube should be exempt from the antitrust laws . . .."" 
(Pl.'s Resp. to Def. ABA's Mot. for Summ. J. at 30 (emphasis added)). Allied involved restrictive activities, not expression. 
Moreover, it is a fallacy to suppose that just because a core concept of antitrust law cannot logically be extended indefinitely 
that the core concept is faulty."
98,16," This is different from the situation where an association states its position and then engages in conduct related to its stated 
position because where there is conduct, there is a basis for antitrust liability -- the association has gone beyond expression."
98,17," The governmental decision to exclude graduates of unaccreditated schools from taking certain bar examinations is protected 
under Noerr. Because governmental action is responsible for this injury, ABA conduct is not."
98,18," MSL might attempt to distinguish the Schachar analogy by reasoning that, unlike the plaintiff in that case, it challenges ABA 
standards not ABA accreditation decisions. However, this is a distinction without a difference. No doubt, the association in 
Schachar maintained some standards. One standard might have provided that: a procedure is termed ""experimental"" until it has undergone two years of testing. However, even if the association maintained such a standard, there is no conduct on which to base antitrust liability because by 
promulgating this standard, the association has done nothing more than to express its views on when a procedure is safe to 
perform. The situation would be different if the association's standard provided that: a procedure is termed ""experimental"" until it has undergone two years of testing and no member of the association shall 
deal or otherwise transact business with a doctor who performs ""experimental"" procedures. In this latter scenario, the association has engaged in conduct directed at restraining trade. However, there was no such conduct 
in Schachar as there is no such conduct in the instant case. "
99,19, A quick search in Martindale-Hubbel revealed that at least six MSL graduates have already joined ABA.
99,20," In its complaint, MSL points out that its students cannot transfer their credits to ABA accreditated law schools, and its students 
cannot obtain LL.M. degrees from ABA accreditated law schools. (Complaint PP 37(d), 37(e)). Although an argument might be 
made that these two rules amount to ABA conduct, I find that such alleged conduct is insufficient to preclude summary judgment. 
First, MSL has not produced any evidence indicating that it has been injured because of these two ABA rules. In fact, there is 
evidence indicating that MSL vigorously attempts to frustrate any student from transferring to an ABA-accreditated law school by 
withholding transcripts and generally not cooperating with transfer efforts. In one instance, an MSL student needed to 
commence a lawsuit against the school to release her transcripts. Riley v. Massachusetts School of Law, Inc., No. 91-910 (Sup. 
Ct. Mass.) Mr. Velvel had refused to cooperate with the student's transfer efforts because he maintained that the student had 
entered the school in bad faith, not intending to graduate, but instead planning all along to transfer to an accreditated school. 
Moreover, the council in charge of higher education in Massachusetts noted: we continue to receive complaints from students who are unable to resolve complaints on their own with the law school. 
This includes the law school's refusal to accept certified mail from students, and difficulties in obtaining transcripts and other 
information from various members of the administrative staff. (Def.'s Ex. D to Mot. for Summ. J., at 3). Second, these ABA rules are essentially extensions of the protected speech. ABA's speech would be meaningless if students of 
unaccreditated schools could shoe-horn their unaccreditated credits into an ABA accreditated law school."
99,21," In fact, if a school disagrees with the standards, it should not simply pay lip service to them. Indeed, at least some members of 
MSL's faculty appear to agree with this sentiment as Mr. Velvel noted that ""there are people on our faculty who believe we'd be 
better off without [ABA accreditation]."" Dick Dahl, Massachusetts Weekly, January 18, 1993, ""A Maverick Law School's Maverick 
Pitch."""
99,22," Nor do any of the other defendants engage in conduct detrimental to MSL's ability to compete for customers. Just like ABA, 
these other defendants may express opinions about quality within the profession, but they take no affirmative action. MSL 
maintains that LSAC also excludes it from certain LSAC recruitment forums. (Plf.'s Resp. to ABA's Mot. for Summ. J., Vol. II, at 
120). MSL might contend that this is ""conduct"" which, through its conspiracy theory, is relevant in taking this case outside of the 
First Amendment's protection. However, as Judge Easterbrook noted in Schachar, ""antitrust law does not compel your 
competitor to praise your product or sponsor your work. To require cooperation or friendliness among rivals is to undercut the 
intellectual foundations of antitrust law."" 870 F.2d at 399. MSL cannot use the Sherman Act to compel LSAC, one of the 
organizations that administers the LSAT which MSL has publicly rejected as racially biased and unreliable, to assist MSL in 
marketing its product. "
100,23," As I have found that MSL's alleged harm is not a proper basis for recovery, I need not consider the other grounds for summary 
judgment raised in ABA's motion. "
109,1," ""Complaint"" refers to UCC's Third Amended Complaint, filed on January 18, 1996. If reference is made to a prior complaint, the 
full title will be used (i.e., Original Complaint, First Amended Complaint, Second Amended Complaint). "
112,2," Under the proposed project, UCC and SOC would both contribute their existing half interest in the UCC/Shell Venture and the 
Seadrift plant; SOC would contribute its Norco polypropylene resin plant and its SHAC catalyst business; UCC would contribute 
its supporting training and engineering services business; and UCC and SOC would contribute capital in appropriate amounts to 
achieve a 50/50 interest. Cplt. P 88."
112,3," The parties also increased their research and development expenditures supporting the UCC/Shell venture by approximately 
30%, anticipating that Nautilus would become a reality. UCC also prepared cost estimates for constructing the new 
polypropylene plants, and SOC informed polypropylene resin customers that it was considering an expansion of the UCC/Shell 
Venture's polypropylene manufacturing capacity. Cplt. P 89. "
113,4," This Memorandum contemplated the formation of Sophia on January 1, 1993. SOC would contribute its solely-owned 
polypropylene assets, including its Norco polypropylene resin plant and its SHAC-II catalyst plant then under construction. SOC 
would also contribute its propylene manufacturing assets and/or propylene purchase arrangements. Further, Shell Canada was 
to contribute its Sarnia, Ontario polypropylene plant. Cplt. P 118. "
115,5," Count II also alleges that SPC had a fiduciary relationship with UCC and Seadrift by virtue of ""the purported assignment of 
[SOC's] rights and obligations under the CUA, the Seadrift Partnership Agreement, and related agreements . . . ."" Cplt. P 231. 
UCC alleges that SPC breached this duty by continuing or assisting the actions of SOC that constitute a breach of fiduciary duty. 
Id. P 232. For simplicity, in the discussion of this Count, I will refer only to SOC, although the analysis applies with equal force to 
the relationship between UCC/Seadrift and SPC. "
116,6," This Opinion will refer to briefs in the following manner. Moving briefs are called ""[name of defendant group] Mem."" Plaintiff's 
opposition to the moving brief of a particular defendant group is called ""UCC Opp. Mem. ([name of defendant group])."" Finally, 
reply briefs are called ""[name of defendant group] Reply."""
116,7," SOC concedes that ""the Seadrift Partnership Agreement may have created a fiduciary relationship,"" but states that ""that 
fiduciary relationship was limited to the subject matter of that agreement,"" which was ""'to construct, own, and operate the 
Seadrift plant, which became operational in May 1985.'"" SOC/SPC Reply Mem. at 4 (quoting Cplt. P 64). SOC thus implies that 
because UCC's allegations in Count II do not relate to the operation of the Seadrift plant, any fiduciary duty arising from the 
Seadrift Partnership Agreement is irrelevant to this Count. It is unnecessary, however, to address the significance of the Seadrift 
Partnership Agreement to Count II because I find that UCC has properly alleged a breach of a fiduciary duty between UCC and 
SOC based on the CUA. "
117,8," The arguments are made jointly with SPC, which is SOC's wholly-owned subsidiary (see Cplt. P 20). SPC is implicated in the 
fraud claim's allegation that ""SPC has also defrauded UCC by falsely representing to UCC that the mixed-solvent recovery 
system was not Joint Development Technology of UCC and [SOC] and by assisting [SOC] in misrepresenting to the appraiser 
the relevant facts relating to the allegedly separate mixed-solvent recovery business."" Cplt. P 226. "
119,9," UCC alleges breach of the implied duty ""to the extent such conduct does not breach express provisions of the CUA"" or the 
Catalyst Sales Contract. Cplt. PP 296-97."
119,10," SOC raises two other grounds for dismissing this Count. Because I am granting the motion to dismiss Count XIII, there is no 
reason to address SOC's additional contentions. "
120,11," Thus I specifically decline to address the import in this case of the recent ruling of the New York Court of Appeals, which held 
that an actual breach of contract is required (or at least a showing that performance is rendered impossible) in order to state a 
claim of interference with existing contractual relations. See NBT Bancorp Inc. v. Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Inc., 87 N.Y.2d 
614, 620-21, 641 N.Y.S.2d 581, 664 N.E.2d 492 (1996). Further, despite the request of Shell/Montell, I decline to require UCC to replead this count in order to specify ""what allegations 
relate to actual breaches of contract that it claims were caused by interference from the defendants."" Shell/Montell Reply at 10. 
Instead, I refer the Shell/Montell defendants to Paragraphs 131-55 and 271 of the Complaint. "
121,12," The Shell/Montell defendants also argue that UCC's purchase of the assets of SPC at 85% of fair market value (as determined 
by an independent appraiser) has eliminated any damage claimed by UCC as a result of SOC's assignment of and withdrawal 
from the CUA. Shell/Montell Mem. at 19; see also Cplt. P 271(g) (alleging breach by SOC through its purported assignment of 
the CUA). Shell/Montell suggests that UCC's allegation that it bought the assets of SPC ""in part to mitigate UCC's damages"" 
limits the amount of damages to which UCC is entitled for Count VII. See Cplt. P 156. At this point, I note only that UCC has 
properly alleged the damage element of its claim for tortious interference with existing contractual relations. Id. P 263. While 
these damages may be limited by UCC's purchase of SPC's assets, they are not eliminated. It is premature at this stage of the 
litigation to attempt to assess damages for a claim that UCC has yet to prove, and I decline to do so. "
123,13," Defendants contend that the claim accrued in January 1992, when Shell Canada ""informed UCC . . . that it was deferring a 
UNIPOL licensing decision, and committed to participation in the Sophia discussions."" Cplt. P 113. However, I need not decide 
this issue, because the relation-back issue is dispositive. If the claim, raised in January 1996, does not relate back to the Original 
Complaint, it must have accrued no earlier than January 1993. Thus it would be time barred whether January or July 1992 is 
used as the date of accrual. "
124,14," The Shell/Montell defendants contend that ""according to UCC, . . . the Shell defendants ceased all 'further UNIPOL licensing 
discussions with UCC' in December 1991."" Shell/Montell Mem. at 16. This phrasing is somewhat disingenuous, in that it implies 
that RDS told UCC in December 1991 that it [RDS] was ceasing licensing discussions. UCC actually alleges that ""RDS and Shell 
Canada also did not pursue any further UNIPOL licensing discussions with UCC after the Letter of Intent was signed in 
December 1991."" Cplt. P 110. "
126,15," Volvo North America Corp. v. Men's Int'l Professional Tennis Council, 857 F.2d 55, 74 (2d Cir. 1988), lends no support to 
UCC. In that case, the complaint actually named third parties who plaintiff alleged were sent letters by defendant that denigrated 
the plaintiff."
126,16," Actually, Montedison makes this argument (and the next one) in opposition to UCC's entire claim for tortious interference with 
prospective contractual relations. Because I have already dismissed all of the claim except as it relates to prospective 
contractual relations with RDS, I will apply Montedison's arguments only to that remaining portion. "
127,17," SOC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shell Petroleum Inc., and is a member of the Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) Group. That 
group also includes Shell Petroleum Inc., Shell Petroleum N.V., The Shell Petroleum Co. Ltd., Shell International Chemical Co. 
Ltd., Shell International Research Maatschappij B.V., and Shell Canada Limited. The RDS Group is controlled directly or 
indirectly by Royal Dutch Petroleum (60%) and the Shell Transport and Trading Co. (40%). These two entities also together own 
a fifty percent interest in Montell. See Cplt. PP 14-24. "
128,18," Because I find that UCC has alleged facts sufficient to justify piercing the corporate veil, I need not address UCC's agency 
theory, which it advanced in its brief. In addition, Shell/Montell urges dismissal of this Count as against Shell Canada because in Paragraph 274, UCC does not name 
Shell Canada in its listing of members of the RDS Group. However, UCC clearly implicates ""RDS Group affiliates"" in its claim, 
and does not state that its charge is limited to those affiliates it names in that paragraph. UCC specifically alleges that ""Shell 
Canada is a member of the Royal Dutch Shell Group."" Cplt. P 22. Accordingly, the claim against Shell Canada stands."
128,19," See, e.g., K. Bell & Assocs., Inc. v. Lloyd's Underwriters, 827 F. Supp. 985, 989 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (complaint stated affirmative 
claim for equitable estoppel); Lapkin v. Lapkin, 224 A.D.2d 199, 637 N.Y.S.2d 140, 140 (1st Dep't) (granting plaintiff leave to 
amend complaint ""to add a cause of action for equitable estoppel""), appeal dismissed, 88 N.Y.2d 843, 644 N.Y.S.2d 689, 667 
N.E.2d 339 (1996); Special Event Entertainment v. Rockefeller Center, Inc., 458 F. Supp. 72, 77 (S.D.N.Y. 1978) (""a claim 
based on the doctrine of equitable estoppel has been stated""); but see Chemical Bank v. City of Jamestown, 122 A.D.2d 530, 
504 N.Y.S.2d 908, 909 (4th Dep't), appeal denied, 68 N.Y.2d 608 (1986) (""HN26[
] 'An estoppel does not originate a legal 
right; it merely forbids the denial of a right claimed otherwise to have arisen'"") (quoting Morrill Realty Corp. v. Rayon Holding 
Corp., 254 N.Y. 268, 275, 172 N.E. 494 (1930)); 57 N.Y. Jur. 2d Estoppel § 15 (1986) (same). "
129,20," Defendants' remaining contentions--that UCC has not adequately pled the elements of estoppel, and that UCC has failed to 
assert any specific statements of SOC or the Shell defendants on which UCC relied--are similarly without merit."
129,21," UCC's Complaint contains four antitrust claims (Counts III through VI). Defendants have moved to dismiss two of the claims in 
full and two claims in part. The Shell/Montell defendants briefed the issues; Montedison joined in their arguments with respect to 
all four Counts, and Technipol joined in their arguments with respect to Counts IV and V (the only antitrust claims in which 
Technipol is implicated). See Montedison/Technipol Mem. at 2 n.3 and 3."
129,22," HN27[
] That section of the Sherman Act provides, in part, that ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, 
or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal . . . ."" 
15 U.S.C. § 1 (1973). "
130,23," None of Defendants' remaining arguments justifies dismissing Count III on the ground that it does not allege anticompetitive 
conduct."
130,24," All the cases Defendants cite in support of their position are appeals of grants of summary judgment, appeals after a jury 
verdict, or (in one case) a decision after a bench trial. None involves a motion to dismiss."
130,25," HN31[
] That section of the Clayton Act provides, in relevant part: No person engaged in commerce or in any activity affecting commerce shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any 
part of the stock or other share capital and no person subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission shall 
acquire the whole or any part of the assets of another person engaged also in commerce or in any activity affecting 
commerce, where in any line of commerce or in any activity affecting commerce in any section of the country, the effect of 
such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly."
130,15, U.S.C. § 18 (West Supp. 1996). 
132,26," Defendants also seek dismissal of the ""portions"" of Counts IV and V that challenge the formation of Montell. Plaintiff maintains 
that the Court may not dismiss part of a claim, while Defendants argue the opposite. Because UCC has standing to challenge 
the formation of Montell, there is no need to resolve this dispute. No portion of Counts IV, V or VI will be dismissed. In addition, Defendants contend that damages claimed by UCC on its antitrust claims are limited by certain statements UCC's 
counsel made during the preliminary injunction hearing in February 1995. Specifically, Defendants maintain that UCC is 
precluded from ""recovering damages with respect to any claims that rely on assertions of 'uncertainty' or 'lack of confidence' 
among existing or potential licensees after the June 28, 1995 announcement that UCC would purchase the assets of SPC."" 
Shell/Montell Mem. at 10. As stated earlier (see note 12, supra), a discussion of damages at this stage of the litigation is 
premature."
132,27," UCC may not replead that portion of the claim relating to the expansion of the UCC/Shell Venture through Nautilus because it 
is time-barred. Also, UCC may not attempt to cure the defect in Count XIII through repleading. "
139,1," In outlining its background, the court accepts the government's characterization of the case as a conspiracy involving horizontal 
and vertical relationships. As explained in detail below, the parties dispute whether the indictment adequately pleads the theories 
of the conspiracy advanced by the government in its memorandum opposing Nippon's motion for failure to state a claim under 
section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
140,2," Nippon previously challenged the propriety of the service of process. On March 13, 1996, Chief Magistrate Judge Alexander 
denied Nippon's motion to quash. Nippon does not here challenge that decision. "
143,3," Fed. R. Crim. P. 18 limits venue to a district in which the offense was committed. For purposes of its motion to dismiss for lack 
of personal jurisdiction, Nippon does not challenge the government's allegation that co-conspirators committed overt acts in 
Massachusetts in furtherance of the conspiracy."
143,4," The court notes that some courts have suggested that due process may protect against abusive selection of a venue by the 
federal government. See Petition of Provoo, 17 F.R.D. 183 (D. Md.), aff'd, 350 U.S. 857, 100 L. Ed. 761, 76 S. Ct. 101 (1955). 
There is, however, no suggestion in this case that the prosecution has acted in bad faith in selecting the present forum. "
145,5," The government cites two criminal cases as applying the Sherman Act to foreign conduct: United States v. R.P. Oldham Co., 
152 F. Supp. 818, 822 (N.D. Cal. 1957) and In re Grand Jury Investigation of the Shipping Industry, 186 F. Supp. 298, 313 
(D.D.C. 1960). Both of these cases, however, specifically premise their holding on the fact that co-conspirators committed overt 
acts in the United States. Oldham, 152 F. Supp. at 821 (""the only commerce sought to be regulated is the importation and sale 
of wire nails on the West Coast of the United States""); Shipping Industry, 186 F. Supp. at 314 ("" American Banana Co. v. United 
Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347, 53 L. Ed. 826, 29 S. Ct. 511 (1909), does not preclude Sherman Act jurisdiction over agreements in 
restraint of trade carried out, at least in part, within the United States.""). Indeed, Oldham makes ""clear that there is no attempt 
here to regulate Japanese commerce as such, or to indict Japanese firms or Japanese nationals."" Oldham, 152 F. Supp. at 821. "
147,6," Because Jujo no longer exists, the court considers Nippon's motion for dismissal as made on behalf of both defendants named 
in Count I of the Indictment. Accordingly, dismissal of the indictment will enter as to both Nippon and Jujo. "
161,1," Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint adds PANAMSAT, L.P. as a party and is otherwise identical. "
165,2," Plaintiffs did not argue on this motion that Intelsat had any other intent in effecting the waiver, but restricted themselves to the 
argument that the Court should not reach the issue of Intelsat's intent. "
170,3," See also Pls.' Opp'n Mem. at 7 (""As will be shown, all of this other conduct, from the joint ventures to ATV to the tax certificate 
to the disparagement to the refusal to take capacity on PAS-1, was directly and inextricably connected with the separate 
systems boycott, and furthered that conspiracy. Accordingly, the separate acts cannot be compartmentalized, but must be 
viewed in the context of the evidence as a whole."") (emphasis added); id. at 47 (""Because the underlying boycott was the cause 
of PAS's injury, and the other acts were incidental to and in furtherance of the boycott, PAS has not attempted to attribute 
damages to each of those subsidiary actions.""). "
174,4," Defendant does not present any evidence tending to show that the alleged conspiracy, if successful, would operate contrary to 
the interests of the alleged conspirators. Counterintuitively, Plaintiffs present the strongest evidence that the alleged boycott 
would have operated against the interests of the PTTs, and therefore that a heightened showing is required. Plaintiffs argue that PAS offered substantial advantages over the Intelsat system, including lower prices, higher power and the 
opportunity to resell PAS capacity for incremental profits. See Pls.' 3(g) Statement P 17 (citing Saralegui Dep. Vol. 1 at 187-89 
(alleging obstruction of PAS through the Intelsat process), Vol. 2 at 256-57 (alleging that PAS offered the PTTs a percentage in 
return for access and required no service functions from the PTTs); PAS Ex. 82 (handwritten notes comparing PAS and 
Comsat); Skjei Dep. at 39-42 (discussing PAS Ex. 82 and advantages of PAS over Comsat, including price); Giarman Dep. at 
84 (discussing PAS Ex. 82); Crockett Dep. Vol. 2 at 328-31 (discussing PAS Ex. 82 and advantages of PAS over Comsat, 
including price and power); Carroll Dep. Vol. 1 at 50-52 (discussing PAS Ex. 82 and advantages of PAS power and flexible 
pricing), 97-98 (discussing shortage in Comsat Ku-band capacity); Alewine Dep. Vol. 2 at 188-91 (acknowledging Comsat 
capacity shortage prior to Intelsat-K and Intelsat VI satellites coming on line); Kopinski Dep. at 40-41 (acknowledging Comsat 
shortage of station-kept, Ku-band capacity prior to Intelsat-K), 126-27 (acknowledging a lack of high-power Ku capacity on 
Intelsat in 1990, before Intelsat-K and the Intelsat VI and VII satellites), 132-35 (acknowledging shortage in full-time voice grade 
capacity to Latin America prior to Intelsat VI satellites); PAS Ex. 2894 (ISS Strategic Business Plan, 1991-93); Popkin Dep. at 
54-62 (listing alleged advantages of PAS as reported by potential customers, including digital compression service, orbital 
location and station kept signal), 71-73 (acknowledging shortage of station-kept capacity but denying knowledge of any PAS 
offer to sell capacity to Comsat); Salvati Dep. at 38-40 (acknowledging a shortage in Ku-band capacity on Comsat until launch 
of Intelsat K-4 in 1992, and denying effort to obstruct major broadcasters from switching to PAS); Schnicke Dep. at 22-23 
(acknowledging periods of capacity shortages on Comsat); Tanner Dep. Vol. 1 at 16-17 (acknowledging shortages in Ku-band 
capacity); Twining Dep. at 30-31 (acknowledging shortages of Ku-band capacity); Comsat Ex. 988 (Statement of Reynold 
Anselmo, Chairman of PAS, July 28, 1994, before the Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on 
Telecommunications and Finance); PAS Ex. 1102 (March 24, 1989 Comsat/Entel Chile Joint Venture Proposal); Balz Dep. at 
80-85 (discussing licensing of private providers of voice telephony services within the former East Germany to meet the 
exceptional demand created by reunification)). Plaintiffs then reason that the PTTs, in the face of these advantages, should have 
switched to PAS. The fact that the PTTs did not enthusiastically switch to PAS, Plaintiffs claim, can only be explained by the 
existence of the alleged conspiracy. In other words, according to Plaintiffs the fact that the alleged conspiracy makes no 
economic sense helps to prove its existence. Despite Plaintiffs' reliance on this argument, the Court finds that the alleged conspiracy is not economically implausible and 
therefore a heightened showing is not required."
174,5," The other prerequisite identified in the record is formal approval under Article XIV of the Intelsat agreements, which ensures the 
technical compatibility of any proposed new operator. Article XIV(c) approval or ""consultations"" allow domestic transmissions, 
and Article XIV(d) consultations allow international transmissions. A service provider seeking to enter a market generally would undertake to secure Article XIV consultations prior to seeking an 
operating agreement, although there is some disagreement between the parties on this point. Assuming no technical conflicts, 
the Board of Governors generally grants Article XIV consultations a short time after the local PTT monopoly submits a formal 
letter requesting consultations on the party's behalf. A PTT therefore could have refused to deal with PAS by declining to submit 
a formal letter of request for consultations on PAS's behalf, or by delaying such a letter. Plaintiffs, however, do not argue that the "
175,," alleged PTT conspirators denied or delayed PAS's requests for Article XIV consultations (even though many of Plaintiffs' 
sources allege exactly that), presumably because such denials or delays would be the result of PTT signatory conduct and 
therefore outside the scope of this litigation."
175,6," Although Defendant argues that no bottleneck existed-- because operating agreements were not required in some countries 
and the issuance of landing rights was often controlled by a government agency and not the PTT--Defendant does not dispute 
that the PTTs were traditionally monopolies with significant control over their home markets."
175,7," Plaintiffs claim that the Colombian PTT Telecom required PAS to execute an exclusive operating agreement, only then to 
refuse to provide service under it. See Pls.' Opp'n Mem. at 11."
175,8," Plaintiffs' submissions suggest an effort to conceal the perceptible lack of support for Plaintiffs' claims in the record. In addition 
to failing to provide page indicators and explanatory references, Plaintiffs frequently refer to the same document within the same 
citation by two or more exhibit numbers. See, e.g., Pls.' 3(g) Statement P 36 (citing Argentina: Comsat Exs. 160 & 262, PAS Ex. 
2252; Comsat Exs. 28 & 520; Brazil: Comsat Exs. 36 & 244; Venezuela: Comsat Ex. 420 & PAS Ex. 1901; Colombia: Comsat

466 & PAS Ex. 2072; Comsat Ex. 526 & PAS Ex. 2110; Comsat Ex. 528 & PAS Ex. 1898). Plaintiffs also frequently repeat 
nearly identical string citations in support of different propositions. Compare Pls.' 3(g) Statement P 24 with P 25 and P 32. These 
practices so completely fail to present the material issues for review that they cause the Court to question whether they are not a "
176,," calculated attempt to survive the motion not on the merits but by overwhelming judicial resources with a mountain of paper. 
Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, the Court has inspected each citation provided."

sports leagues are like law firms, law firms are single entities, therefore sports leagues are single entities. See, e.g., Myron C.

Consumer Welfare Model, 82 Mich. L. Rev. 1, 23-35 (1983); Maj. Op. at 7-8. This argument is only valid, however, if law firms 
should be treated as single entities. If law firms do, in fact, have some of the same potential for inefficiencies as sports leagues 
because of the diverse economic interests of the partners, the economically correct solution is still to treat sports leagues as joint 
ventures. A mere analogy to law firms is not convincingly invoked by those seeking to defend their arguments on purely 
economic (rather than precedential) grounds. Applying the same logic in reverse, there is considerable precedent for treating sports leagues as joint ventures. Nat'l Collegiate

278,4," Although the court has serious doubts as to whether Martin A. Thomson's Declaration is sufficient to provide facts necessary to 
support a motion for summary judgment, the court finds that even if the declaration is sufficient, there is a genuine issue of 
material fact. John Tierney's affidavit, attached to plaintiff's brief as exhibit B, states that municipalities do not set rates included 
in bids. (Tierney Aff. at PP 14, 15.) "
292,1, Dr. Crosby presented other state law claims which are not relevant to this appeal. 
293,2," This case involves Crosby's claim that he was denied staff privileges because he was an osteopathic as opposed to an 
allopathic physician. We have described the difference between the two as follows: Generally, osteopathy assists the body's remedial capabilities by focusing on the interaction of the biological systems and 
stressing musculoskeletal manipulative therapy, while allopathy treats disease by producing effects incompatible with the 
condition to be alleviated…. Although Georgia licenses both D.O.'s and M.D.'s to practice medicine, the state distinguishes 
between the two medical educations, referencing them separately in the licensing statutes. O.C.G.A. §§ 43-34-20(3), 43-
34-26 (1984). Silverstein v. Gwinnett Hosp. Authority, 861 F.2d 1560, 1563 (11th Cir.1988). "
294,3," All members of the medical staff agreed to abide by the Bylaws. Further, the Bylaws were adopted and approved by the 
Authority."
294,4," Specifically, Dr. Crosby was not ""board certified or board eligible"" as designated by the American Board of Orthopedics (""ABO"") 
because he had not completed an osteopathic orthopedic residency training program that was approved by the ABO. 
Accordingly, the Orthopedic Service concluded, in part, that Dr. Crosby did not satisfy the Bylaws' residency requirements."
294,5," In other words, the recommendation of the Credentials Committee dropped the Orthopedic Service's second ground for 
denying Dr. Crosby's application."
294,6, Dr. Crosby was represented by counsel at this hearing.
294,7," Under the Bylaws, although the various staff committees provide recommendations to the Authority, the Authority wields 
ultimate decisionmaking power over staff credentialing decisions. (Bylaws, Article V, § 2). In this regard, the Authority exercises 
meaningful control over the ultimate decision. It has the power to follow, modify, or even disregard staff committee 
recommendations. (Id. at Article V, § 2(g)-(j)). "
295,8," By consent of parties, Dr. Crosby abandoned all but his federal antitrust claims.  Crosby, 873 F. Supp. at 1570."
295,9," Because we affirm the district court's ruling with respect to state action immunity and immunity from damages under the LGAA, 
we need not reach its decision regarding immunity under the HCQIA. "
296,10," We use the terms ""municipality"" and ""political subdivision"" interchangeably throughout this opinion. Cf.  Askew v. DCH 
Regional Health Care Authority, 995 F.2d 1033, 1037 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1012, 114 S. Ct. 603, 126 L. Ed. 2d 568 
(1993) (""Ordinarily, when a local government entity seeks immunity from antitrust liability, it must show that it is a political 
subdivision of the state and that the challenged conduct is authorized under a ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed 
policy of the state.' ""); Bolt IV, 980 F.2d at 1385 (""Political subdivisions, including municipalities, … can obtain protection under 
the state-action immunity doctrine if they can ""demonstrate that [they acted pursuant to a clearly articulated stated policy 
displacing competition with regulation].' "")."
296,11," In City of Lafayette, the Court suggested that state action immunity would apply to a municipality only if: (1) the municipality 
acted pursuant to clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy; and (2) the anticompetitive conduct was actively 
supervised by the State. 435 U.S. at 410, 98 S. Ct. at 1135. In Town of Hallie, the Court held that only the first of the these two 
prongs applies to municipalities. 471 U.S. at 46-47, 105 S. Ct. at 1720. In California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal 
Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105, 100 S. Ct. 937, 943, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980), the Court held that both prongs apply to private 
parties."
296,12," Cf.  City of Lafayette, 435 U.S. at 412-13, 98 S. Ct. at 1136-37 (""In light of the serious economic dislocation which could result 
if cities were free to place their own parochial interests above the Nation's economic goals reflected in the antitrust laws, … we 
are especially unwilling to presume that Congress intended to exclude anticompetitive municipal action from their reach.""). "
297,13," Appellees cite a number of factually-distinguishable cases for the proposition that ""hospital authorities"" in general are political 
subdivisions. In Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Authority, 921 F.2d 1438 (11th Cir.1991) and Askew, supra, for example, we 
examined hospital authorities created by the Alabama Health Care Authorities Act. This Act specifically provided that Alabama's 
hospital authorities acted as political subdivisions of the State when exercising their powers, even if such exercise violated 
federal antitrust law. These cases are not dispositive because Georgia's statutes are not nearly so explicit. "
299,14," The parties have not argued and we decline to address the Supreme Court's invitation to employ a ""market participant"" 
exception to state action immunity. See City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, 499 U.S. 365, 374-75, 379, 111 S. Ct. 
1344, 1351, 1353, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1991). See also Genentech, Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co., 998 F.2d 931, 948 (Fed.Cir.1993), 
cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1140, 114 S. Ct. 1126, 127 L. Ed. 2d 434 (1994). "
301,15," State action immunity remained an issue in the case as to one of the hospital defendants who had presented a new state-
action argument in its brief on rehearing en banc.  Bolt III, 891 F.2d at 818 n. 12, 823 n. 22. "
302,16," The court in Bolt III also examined whether one of the hospital defendants was entitled to state action immunity. Id. at 823-25. 
See supra note 15. It held that the Florida legislature had not clearly articulated a policy to displace competition because it had 
not foreseen that the hospital would conspire with its medical staff to deny plaintiff staff privileges on pretextual grounds.  891 
F.2d at 825. Accordingly, because the State had not foreseen that particular type of anticompetitive conduct, the court found that 
the hospital was not protected by Parker immunity. However, in Bolt v. Halifax Hosp. Medical Center (Bolt IV ), 980 F.2d 1381 
(11th Cir.1993), we held that the Supreme Court in City of Columbia rejected this part of Bolt III: The Court [in City of Columbia ] rejected federal judicial inquiry into the state officials' intent in undertaking the challenged 
action. Such an inquiry, the Court stated, ""would require the sort of deconstruction of the governmental process and probing 
of the official ""intent' that we have consistently sought to avoid."" [Cit.] … The inquiry into whether the reasons for [the hospital's] denial of staff privileges were pretextual would require probing into 
the ""official intent"" of HHMC, an inquiry expressly denounced by the Supreme Court. [Cit.] Bolt IV, 980 F.2d at 1388 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we held that City of Columbia implicitly overruled Bolt III in part. City of Columbia left untouched, however, Bolt III 's rejection of Copperweld 's intraenterprise immunity doctrine in the 
context of hospital peer review decisions. This portion of Bolt III remains the law of this circuit."
302,17," The hospital bylaws at DCH required a peer review process for credentialing decisions that was similar in relevant respects to 
the process at issue in the instant case. "
303,18," In the alternative, the district court held that the radiologists were protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Id. Opting to 
base our decision on other grounds, we declined to affirm on these grounds.  Id. at 1446 n. 14."
303,19," In the text we explain how Todorov is distinguished from this case because it merely rejected the same-legal-entity rationale. 
Todorov is also distinguishable on its facts. In Todorov, the challenged actions of the individual doctors were not actions in the 
performance of official duties as peer review committee members; rather, the individual doctors merely gave negative 
recommendations about plaintiff to the relevant peer review committees. By contrast, the challenged actions of the individual 
doctors in the instant case were all taken within the scope of their official duties as members of the hospital's peer review 
committees. See infra note 20. "
304,20," The district court found that each individual doctor defendant acted within the scope of his or her duty as a member of the 
various credentialing committees.  Crosby, 873 F. Supp. at 1571. This finding is not clearly erroneous."
304,21," At this hearing before the Authority, Crosby was free to present evidence and argument that the several recommendations of 
the hospital's peer review committees were influenced by improper and irrelevant anticompetitive motives. We must assume that 
the Authority would have favorably entertained such arguments and evidence had they been persuasive; we must neither 
deconstruct the Authority's mental processes nor probe its intent.  City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 377, 111 S. Ct. at 1352. "
305,22," O.C.G.A. § 31-7-15, provides, in relevant part: HN22[
] (a) A hospital … shall provide for the review of professional practices in the hospital … for the purpose of 
reducing morbidity and mortality and for the improvement of the care of patients in the hospital…. This review shall include, 
but shall not be limited to, the following: … (3) The evaluation of medical and health care services or the qualifications and professional competence of persons 
performing or seeking to perform such services. (b) The functions required by subsection (a) of this Code section may be performed by a ""peer review committee,"" defined 
as a committee of physicians appointed by a state or local or specialty medical society or appointed by the governing board 
or medical staff of a licensed hospital or ambulatory surgical center or any other organization formed pursuant to state or 
federal law and engaged by the hospital … for the purposes of performing such functions required by subsection (a) of this 
Code section. (c) Compliance with the above provisions of subsection (a) of this Code section shall constitute a requirement for granting 
or renewing the permit of a hospital…. (e) Nothing in this or any other Code section shall be deemed to require any hospital or ambulatory surgical center to grant 
medical staff membership or privileges to any licensed practitioner of the healing arts."
305,23," See, e.g., William S. Brewbaker, ""Antitrust Conspiracy Doctrine and Hospital Enterprise,"" 74 B.U.L.Rev. 67 (1994)."
305,24," In this case, we need not and do not address the issue of whether Midcal 's active state supervision requirement would apply 
to the activities of peer review committee members if the peer review committees exercised unbridled discretion in making staff 
privilege decisions--i.e., if the Authority had completely delegated this function to the peer review committees of the medical 
staff."
305,25," Dr. Crosby rejoins that the reasons proffered by the various peer review committees were a mere pretext for their true 
anticompetitive motives. As City of Columbia directs, however, once it is determined that the denial of Crosby's application for 
staff privileges was ""state action,"" the individual motives underlying that action become irrelevant.  City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 
377-78, 111 S. Ct. at 1352 ("" ""Where the action complained of … was that of the State itself, the action is exempt from antitrust 
liability regardless of the State's motives in taking the action.' "") (quotation omitted). ""Any action that qualifies as state action is 
""ipso facto … exempt from the operation of the antitrust laws'…."" Id., 499 U.S. at 379, at 1353 (quoting Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 
U.S. 558, 568, 104 S. Ct. 1989, 1995, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984)). Because the individual staff members were acting as agents of 
the Authority in making their peer review recommendations, they were acting at the behest of and as an arm of the State and, 
therefore, their motives are irrelevant so long as the challenged actions were undertaken pursuant to clearly articulated state "
306,," policy. Crosby had an opportunity at the hearing before the Authority to demonstrate that the peer review committee members 
made their recommendations for improper and irrelevant anticompetitive reasons. We cannot probe the Authority's intent in 
rejecting any such arguments by Crosby."
306,26," The district court stated that whether Georgia has authorized the challenged conduct was not at issue.  873 F. Supp. at 1578 
n. 10. Crosby has not argued otherwise and, accordingly, we do not specifically address this issue. We note, however, that in 
examining whether Georgia, through its statutes, has clearly articulated a state policy in favor of the alleged anticompetitive 
conduct, we necessarily touch on this issue."
306,27," Dr. Crosby also alleges that the Authority denied his application because he is an osteopathic physician. To the extent this 
claim fits into the antitrust model, it is subsumed in the argument set forth in the text. "
307,28, See infra Section II.D.
307,29," In his brief, Dr. Crosby states: Appellant, Dr. Crosby, has not and does not seek an order directing that the Authority grant him staff privileges. He seeks to 
have injunctive relief to ensure that he is placed on a level playing field with his allopathic competitors. He also seeks 
monetary damages for the conduct of the private defendant physicians who participated in the denial of his staff privileges. "
308,30," Our conclusion that Georgia has reasonably anticipated the anticompetitive effects of hospital peer review decisions also 
derives strong support from O.C.G.A. § 31-7-15, the statute authorizing peer review. See supra note 22. This statute indicates 
the legislature's recognition that staff credentialing decisions will be aided by the use of peer review committees. Accord Bolt IV, 
980 F.2d at 1386."
308,31," Cf.  Atlanta Center Ltd. v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 848 F.2d 146, 148 (11th Cir.1988) (""The state of Georgia has expressed, both in 
its constitution and in its statutory law, a strong public policy disfavoring contractual restraints on competition and trade.""). "
309,32," Dr. Crosby urges that a different conclusion is mandated by FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 119 L. 
Ed. 2d 410 (1992). His argument focuses on Ticor 's insistence on real compliance with the active supervision requirement.  Id., 
504 U.S. at 633-39, 112 S. Ct. at 2177-79. The foregoing discussion makes clear that this aspect of Ticor has no bearing on this 
case because we need not reach the ""active supervision"" requirement. As to the ""clear articulation"" requirement, the Court in 
dicta reiterated that ""in the usual case, Midcal 's requirement that the State articulate a clear policy shows little more than that 
the State has not acted through inadvertence…."" Id., 504 U.S. at 636, 112 S. Ct. at 2178. As the discussion supra makes clear, 
Georgia's statutory action reasonably portends the challenged anticompetitive conduct in this case."
309,33," Dr. Crosby essentially concedes that the Authority falls within the definition of ""local government"" and that the individual 
committee members are ""persons"" within the meaning of the LGAA by failing to argue otherwise on appeal. See Cheffer v. 
Reno, 55 F.3d 1517, 1519 n. 1 (11th Cir.1995) (issues not argued in brief deemed abandoned); see also Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(6). "
310,34," See infra, note 35."
310,35," We recognize that our holding, supra, that the actions of the individual doctors should be considered actions of the Authority 
for purposes of state action immunity may mean the individual doctors are directly immune under the LGAA, 15 U.S.C.A. § 
35(a). Section 35(a) provides that no damages may be recovered from a local government, or an official or employee thereof 
acting in an official capacity. However, we also recognize that the specificity of the LGAA's language in § 35(a) (""local 
government, or official or employee"") might suggest that agents other than ""officials"" or ""employees"" are not directly immune. In 
any event, we need not decide whether the individual committee members should be deemed the equivalent of the local 
government, or an official or employee of the local government for purposes of the LGAA because the two-prong Midcal test is 
so readily satisfied, and the doctors are clearly immune under § 36(a). "
321,1," In addition to the filing of a Joint Motion and Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment, the Defendants -- with the 
exception of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc. and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Sales Limited (collectively 
""PCS"") -- filed Supplemental Motions for Summary Judgment, which separately addressed those issues that were unique to 
each, individual Defendant."

322,3," ""Potash"" is a generic name for a variety of potassium forms. The potassium found in potash, together with nitrogen and 
phosphorus, constitute the three basic raw materials used in the production of fertilizers. The predominant form of potash is 
""muriate of potash,"" which is otherwise known as ""potassium chloride."" Muriate of potash, which constitutes nearly all of the 
potash consumed in the United States, is available in three varieties of particle size: standard, coarse, and granular. Plaintiffs' 
Third Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint (""Third Amended Complaint"") at P136. In addition to its employment 
as a fertilizer, a small portion of potash is consumed in various industrial applications. Potash is typically mined from 
underground land deposits, either through conventional or through ""solution"" mining. The potash, that is produced through 
solution mining, is white in color, whereas the potash, that is mined through conventional means, is typically red. Only white 
potash is suitable for industrial uses. Expert Report of Andrew W. Rosenfield (""Rosenfield Rept."") at P59, attached as Exhibit 17, 
Defendants' Joint Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment, Affidavit of Gordon Busdicker (""Defs.'Jt.Memo. Aff."")."
322,4," On August 19, 1993, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred to this Court, in order that they might be 
consolidated with the twelve actions that this Court had previously combined, certain proceedings, which had originated in the 
District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois, and for the Western District of Virginia, and which involved the same or similar 
issues. "
323,5," As to PPG and Rio Algom, their involvement in the sale of potash, in the United States, arises from their ownership of one or 
more of the co-Defendants. For example, until November of 1987, PPG owned and operated Kalium as a business unit. PPG's 
Memorandum in Support of Summary Judgment (""PPG Memo."") at 1. On August 20, 1987, PPG agreed to sell its interest in 
Kalium to S&P Canada, Ltd. and S&P U.S., Inc. (collectively ""S&P""), and that transaction was completed on November 17, 1987. 
Id. at 1 n. 1. Rio Algom, on the other hand, acquired, in 1986, the Potash Company of America, Inc. (""PCA Canada""), which is a 
Canadian company that operated two Canadian potash mines, and that merchandised potash in the United States. Declaration 
of John A.H. Bush at P2, attached to PCA's and Rio Algom's Memorandum in Support of Summary v Judgment (""PCA/Rio 
Algom Jt.Memo.""). PCA Canada operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rio Algom until December 31, 1987, when Rio Algom 
created a division (""Division"") which oversaw the operations of the two mines. Id. at P3. On that same date, Rio Algom 
transferred the responsibility, for the sale and marketing of potash in the United States, to PCA, which operated as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Rio Algom. Id. at P4. Thereafter, in October of 1993, PCA's assets, and the potash mining assets of the 
Division, were sold to PCS. Id. at P5."

324,7," The mechanics at play here, in the context of a concentrated industry, were succinctly recounted by then Circuit Judge, and 
now Justice Breyer, as follows: A firm in a concentrated industry typically has reason to decide (individually) to copy an industry leader. After all, a higher-
than-leader's price might lead a customer to buy elsewhere, while a lower-than-leader's price might simply lead competitors 
to match the lower price, reducing profits for all. One does not need an agreement to bring about this kind of follow-the-
leader effect in a concentrated industry. Clamp-All Corp. v. Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute, 851 F.2d 478, 484 (1st Cir. 1988); see also, United States v. FMC Corp., 306 F. 
Supp. 1106, 1139 (E.D.Pa. 1969) (""Due to the relative inelasticity of demand for the products a lower price will not increase the 
size of the total market; no producer can successfully sell at a higher price than its competitors; and if a seller attempts to sell at 
a lower price * * * its competitors will be given the opportunity to meet its lower price, thereby resulting in uniform prices again, 
but at a lower level; and without any increase in the original seller's net share of the market.""), order supplemented, 317 F. Supp. 
443 (E.D.Pa. 1970). "
325,8," The ensuing portions of this Report are unavoidably rife with the dramatis personae of the potash industry, as it existed during 
the period of the alleged conspiracy. For ease of reference, we append to this Report a listing of the identities of those persons 
whose names reoccur in our discussion of the issues. See, Appendix A. "
326,9," In years past, the potash industry had been the subject of an antidumping action, and of prorationing legislation. For example, 
because of production increases, potash prices fell approximately 50 percent in the latter half of the 1960's. In August of 1969, 
the United States determined that dumping had occurred and, contemporaneously, the Saskatchewan government enacted a 
prorationing scheme in order to increase the price of potash that was to be sold in the United States. Under this scheme, not 
only was each producer granted a production quota, but a minimum price was established which, if violated, would threaten a 
cancellation of the producer's production license. See, e.g., Picketts, Schmitz & Schmitz, Rent Seeking: The Potash Dispute 
Between Canada and the United States, Amer.J.Ag.Econ. 255, 260 (May 1991), attached as Exhibit 7. Defs.'Jt.Memo.Aff. 
Nevertheless, this prorationing legislation was eventually overturned, in the Canadian Courts, for the setting of a floor price 
would, impermissibly, infringe upon trade. Haglund & von Bredow, The Politics of Antidumping: The Potash ""War"" of 1986-1988, 
in U.S. Trade Barriers and Canadian Minerals: Copper, Potash and Uranium (1990), at 78, attached as Exhibit 5. Defs.'Jt. 
Memo.Aff."
326,10," In pertinent part, the Suspension Agreement provided as follows: Each signatory producer/exporter of potassium chloride from Canada, individually, agrees that the price it will charge for 
each entry of potassium chloride exported to the United States from Canada for consumption in the United States will be 
such that the any amount by which the estimated foreign market value exceeds the United States price will not exceed 15 
percent of the weighted-average amount by which the estimated foreign market value exceeded the United States price for 
all less-than-fair-value entries by such signatory producer/exporter that were examined during the Department's 
investigation. Suspension of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Potassium Chloride From Canada, 53 Fed.Reg. 1393, 1394 (January 19, 1988), 
attached as Exhibit 35, Defs.'Jt.Memo.Aff. "
328,11," Of course, not every agreement that restrains competition will violate the Sherman Act. It is well settled that Section 1 prohibits 
only those agreements which unreasonably restrain competition. In identifying such offending agreements, the Supreme Court 
has held that certain kinds of accords are unreasonable per se, such as agreements among competitors to fix prices.  United 
States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 224-26 n. 49, 84 L. Ed. 1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940); Capital Imaging v. Mohawk 
Valley Medical Assoc., 996 F.2d 537, 542-43 (2d Cir. 1993) (listing the types of per se violations that have been recognized by 
the Supreme Court), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 947, 126 L. Ed. 2d 337, 114 S. Ct. 388 (1993). Here, the Plaintiffs have alleged a 
horizontal price fixing conspiracy -- that is, one that involves concerted action on only one level in a product's distribution chain -- 
and, therefore, the only inquiry is whether the agreement existed, since the unreasonableness of such a restraint is presumed. 
Cf., Valley Liquors, Inc. v. Renfield Importers, Ltd., 822 F.2d 656, 659 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1987). "
329,12," The Plaintiffs have produced no direct evidence of a price fixing agreement. Otherwise stated, the plaintiffs have not pointed to 
a single document, or excerpt of testimony, that, were we to accept the evidence as true, would establish the alleged conspiracy. 
Indeed, at the Hearing on the Motions, Plaintiffs' counsel conceded that there is ""no direct evidence of an agreement per se."" 
Transcript of Summary Judgment Hearing at 137. Rather, the Plaintiffs exclusively rely upon circumstantial evidence in their 
proof of the alleged conspiracy. Accordingly, our task is to determine whether that circumstantial evidence, and any justifiable 
inferences that may be drawn therefrom, are sufficient to create genuine issues of material fact that would warrant the 
submission of their case to a Jury. "
331,13," Although not expressly denominated as ""plus factors,"" our Court of Appeals has required antitrust plaintiffs to proffer evidence, 
that is additive to conscious parallelism, in order to avert an award of Summary Judgment. In Admiral Theatre Corp. v. Douglas "
332,," Theatre Co., 585 F.2d 877, 883 (8th Cir. 1978), the Court looked to whether the parallel conduct was ""inconsistent with the self-
interest of the individual actors."" Indeed, in a related context, the Court concluded that a manufacturer's simple refusal to sell to 
dealers, who would not sell at suggested retail prices, was insufficient to support a finding that there was an illegal combination 
to fix retail prices.  Russell Stover Candies, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission, 718 F.2d 256, 260 (8th Cir. 1983). Notably, the 
Court found that there were ""no 'plus factors' to take the case beyond Colgate,"" a Supreme Court decision that had permitted 
such conduct. Id. at 260, citing United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 63 L. Ed. 992, 39 S. Ct. 465 (1919). Accordingly, 
we believe that, if confronted with this issue, our Court of Appeals would adopt the reasoning of those Courts, which have 
analyzed the sufficiency of an antitrust plaintiff's evidence, that is proffered in opposition to a Motion for Summary Judgment, on 
""plus factor"" grounds."
332,14," We think that the parameters of the applicable analytical regime were well-stated in Reserve Supply v. Owens-Corning 
Fiberglas, 971 F.2d 37, 49 (7th Cir. 1992): In [ruling on Motions for Summary Judgment on price fixing claims], the court should first examine the plaintiff's evidence of 
a conspiracy among the defendants. Next it should examine whether the defendants have offered evidence tending to show 
that the conduct complained of is as compatible with the defendants' legitimate business activities as with illegal conspiracy. 
If the court concludes that the foregoing analysis leaves the evidence of conspiracy ambiguous, it should then determine 
whether the plaintiff can point to any evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the defendants were pursuing their 
legitimate independent interests. See also, Petruzzi's IGA v. Darling-Delaware, 998 F.2d 1224, 1231-33 (3rd Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 994 (1993); 
Dunnivant v. Bi-State Auto Parts, 851 F.2d 1575, 1583 (11th Cir. 1988); Apex Oil Co. v. DiMauro, 822 F.2d 246, 252-54 (2nd Cir. 
1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 977 (1987); but see, In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings, 906 F.2d 432, 440 (9th Cir. 1990),

332,15," We have conscientiously attempted to address each of the items of evidence that the parties have drawn to our attention, but 
we recognize that one scintilla or another will, almost certainly, escape specific comment. We merely note here that we have 
conducted both a microscopic and a macroscopic review of the evidence and, if a particular document, or depositional reference, 
has not been specifically discussed, that does not suggest that the evidence has not been closely considered in our view of the "
333,," evidence as a whole. See, e.g., Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of North America, 974 F.2d 1358, 1364 (3rd Cir. 1992), cert. 
denied, 507 U.S. 912, 122 L. Ed. 2d 659, 113 S. Ct. 1262 (1993)."
333,16," The Advisory Committee's Notes, on Article VIII of the Federal Rules of Evidence, expressly recognizes the tension between 
excluding all hearsay evidence, and admitting that which, for one reason or another, is regarded as sufficiently reliable. In the 
Committee's words: The solution evolved by the common law has been a general rule excluding hearsay but subject to numerous exceptions 
under circumstances supposed to furnish guarantees of trustworthiness. See, also, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 590 n. 9, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993)."
333,17," As explained by the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 602, Federal Rules of Evidence: ""* * * The rule requiring that a witness who testifies to a fact which can be perceived by the senses must have had an 
opportunity to observe, and must have actually observed the fact"" is a ""most persuasive manifestation"" of the common law 
insistence upon ""the most reliable sources of information."" Quoting, McCormick § 10, p. 19; see also, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., supra at 590 n. 9. "
334,18," We note that, as one might expect, the Plaintiffs' ""plus factors"" roughly track the development of the alleged conspiracy. For 
example, the evidence of ""motive and opportunity"" generally corresponds to those months preceding April of 1987, whereas the 
evidence of ""self-interest"" and of ""interfirm communication,"" approximates the period in which the Defendants are alleged to 
have conspired in fixing prices."
334,19," Canpotex was a lawful cartel, created pursuant to Canadian law, which set prices for potash that would be sold outside of the 
United States. Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Memo. at 36 n. 41. "
341,20," Referring to Williams' Memorandum as a ""mystery"" Memorandum, the Plaintiffs imply that it would not be admissible at Trial. 
The Plaintiffs' objections are threefold: it is incomplete in that it ends in mid-sentence; it was produced several months after 
IMC's other documents were produced, and it bears a Bates number that is out of sequence with those earlier documents; and, 
although it is dated September 10, 1987, it refers to events that are dated September 11, 1987. Pltfs.'IMC Opp.Memo. at 2-3. 
We do not agree that these asserted anomalies would, necessarily, render the Memorandum inadmissible but, in any event, the 
unrebutted testimony of the Memorandum's author, Kip Williams, reveals that IMC did not attempt to undercut the $ 35 increase 
because ""we were concerned with the production controls."" Deposition of Christopher C. Williams at 64, attached as Tab 56, 
Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. "
342,21," With respect to both PCA and Noranda, which were high-cost producers, the Plaintiffs' expert testified that each acted in a 
manner, that was consistent with their own self-interest, by entering into the Suspension Agreement. Deposition of Gordon 
Rausser at 539 and 655, attached as Exhibit 54, Defs.'Jt. Memo.Aff. The following testimony is illustrative: ""I believe PCA was 
above the average [of the preliminary dumping margins]. So the response to your question would be that they would prefer [to 
enter the Suspension Agreement]."" Id. at 655. "
345,22," Kalium's price list reflected prices for each grade of potash which were one dollar higher than that announced in the Canpotex 
Memorandum. Kalium January 11, 1988 Price List (AK 620389), attached as Tab 3, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. "
346,23," In fairness, at the Hearing on this Motion, Plaintiffs' counsel disavowed any claim of conspiracy that was predicated upon the 
Defendants' decision to rebate the surcharge. See, Transcript of Summary Judgment Hearing at 107 (""They didn't conspire to 
give back the 35, but they conspired to raise it 35 bucks but some of them gave it back, you know, kicking and screaming."") 
Nevertheless, the Plaintiffs' Memorandum pointedly implies that the occurrence of the rebates suggested a prior agreement, as 
follows: ""The circumstances surrounding the Suspension Agreement and the attendant price rollback are also indicative of a 
conspiracy."" Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Memo. at 11. "
349,24," Thus, evidence that PCS viewed the Market Correction Program as the ""2 X 4 approach"" does not assist the Plaintiffs in 
establishing that the Program was intended to retaliate against those firms which departed from the alleged conspiracy. PCS 
Handwritten Strategy Memorandum, undated (PC 292882-83), attached as Tab 2, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. Rather, this document 
merely shows that the Program was implemented in furtherance of PCS's goal of being the price leader. The reference to the ""2 
X 4"" approach is listed with ""Raised Prices $ 35"" and ""Gave Rebates - Left Price up $ 18"" under the heading ""Re-examine Our 
Strategy -- Should We Be Bold Enough to Take Drastic Action Again?"" Id. Notably, the Memorandum goes on to report that 
""prices continue to deteriorate."" Id. Likewise, we cannot draw a reasonable inference of conspiracy from a Noranda Memorandum that records a conversation 
between the author, who appears to be a Noranda employee, and an employee at PCS, which occurred at the Saskatchewan 
Mining Association, in February of 1990. Noranda Memorandum (NOR 167913), attached as Tab 6, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. Referring 
to this conversation, the Memorandum states: Casual conversation at the SMA meeting with a fairly senior PCS guy got quite pointed about the ""market correction plan"" 
and he was happy to indicate that they could do it again and to lower price levels because they were more efficient than the 
rest of us and didn't have to worry about the DOC at levels that would cause the other producers to ""dump."" In our view, this Memorandum is consistent with PCS's intent to use the Program as a means to stabilize market prices. "
353,25," Robert Turner (""Turner""), who was the Vice-President of Sales at Kalium, described cutoffs, as they related to price changes, 
in the following terms: There are generally four price periods in the fertilizer year. * * * One would be summer fill program, then you have the fall 
use period, then you have a winter fill program and a spring use period. Generally the prices in the fill programs are lower 
than prices in the use periods. So if we put our a price list for the summer fill program that is due to cut off on September 
15, by means of the price list we say that product that is ordered and shipped after September 15 will go at a higher price. 
Our distribution system occasionally gets swamped and is unable to deliver all of the orders by September 15. So to make 
certain that our customers are protected on their price, if they have accepted orders in by the cutoff date, prior to the cutoff 
date, we sometimes have to ship beyond the cutoff date. Deposition of Robert Turner at 25-26, attached as Tab 52, Pltfs.' Jt.Opp.Aff.; see also, Deposition of Clifford Kelly at 242-43 
(stating reasons why list prices usually increased during the growing season), attached as Exhibit C, Kal.Rep.Aff. "
354,26," In contradistinction to horizontal agreements, or agreements between competitors at the same level in market structure, a 
vertical agreement exists between firms at different levels of the market structure, such as between manufacturers and 
distributors."
354,27," While not cited in the Plaintiffs' Memoranda, the Record indicates that, in July of 1989, Doyle telephoned Turner to express his 
displeasure at Kalium's practice of shipping product, after a price cutoff, at pre-cutoff prices. Deposition of Robert Turner at 107, 
attached as Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff.; Summary of Competitor Communications at 12, attached as Tab 1, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. We have also 
considered the import of this communication in the analysis that proceeds in the text of this Report. "
355,28," The enforcement of cutoffs, the Plaintiffs assert, also prevented potash resellers from accumulating potash inventories, prior to 
a price increase, for resale after the increase went into effect. In this respect, the Plaintiffs proffer a PCS internal Memorandum 
of March 9, 1989, which, at first blush, appears to support their view: We must get control back in the hands of the producers. * * * We must control inventories, to not beef-up at any specific 
locations, at the request of the operator/customer or sales manager in anticipation of a block sale. It is important that we get 
the word out on block sales. * * * We need to set a policy or at least send some indicator as to our thinking. PCS Memorandum (PC 024187), attached as Tab 2, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. This evidence is indeterminate, however, for it shows nothing more than PCS's frustration over the conduct of potash 
wholesalers which impeded PCS's ability to sell product after a price increase. Further, the fact that Turner expressed a similar 
concern to Gillette, on January 15, 1992, is not probative of a conspiracy. See, Deposition of Robert Turner at 142 (""I also told 
him I was concerned about reseller activity after 1/31 at old prices.""), attached as Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. Absent some showing that the 
content of these communications supports a reasonable inference of a conspiracy, a discussion between rivals, of a common 
marketing concern, cannot singularly suffice to exclude the real possibility that the competitors were acting, individually, in their 
own, respective, self interests. "
356,29," Likewise, evidence that, on December 19, 1991, Turner told Bo Thompson (""Thompson""), who was a representative of 
Potocan, which is a non-Defendant potash producer, that Kalium intended to have all of its deliveries completed by 1/31, is non-
probative. Not only is Potocan not a Defendant in this action, but Kalium's intent to have deliveries completed by 1/31 had 
previously been expressed in a letter to its customers. Deposition of Robert Turner at 138, attached as Tab 52, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. 
Further, we find Turner's statement to Steve Gillette, who was the Manager of National Accounts at PCS, that Kalium intended to 
""make our cutoff date * * * with only a few mechanical exceptions,"" and that Kalium did not intend to ""deviate from my letter to 
customers on the price list,"" to be equally non-probative. Id. at 142. Lastly, while the vast majority of the Plaintiffs' ""cut-off"" evidence involves PCS and Kalium, PCA's Ripperger recalled one 
instance when Doyle asked him if PCA intended to implement a price increase that PCA had announced, and ""that [PCA] not 
make sales at the old price after the effective date of the announced price increase."" Deposition of John Ripperger at 216, 
attached as Tab 43, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. Although Ripperger could not recall either the date of the conversation, or his specific 
response, he believed PCA ""did what we wanted to do as far as running our business."" Id. at 218. The Plaintiffs have pointed to 
no evidence to the contrary. Although we do not condone such conduct, absent evidence that either Kalium or PCA modified 
their behavior, we conclude that Doyle's remarks are inadequate, by themselves, to support the inference of a collusive 
agreement."
356,30," As additional evidence that the Defendants had disclosed sensitive material regarding their production capacity, the Plaintiffs 
cite a Kalium Memorandum in which MacKay recounts the events at a dinner meeting of the Saskatchewan Potash Producers 
Association. According to the Memorandum, MacKay attended the meeting to talk with representatives of the Canadian "
357,," Government. Kalium Memorandum (AK 616130), attached as Tab 3, Pltfs.'Jt. Opp.Aff. Notwithstanding the Plaintiffs' claim, that 
the Defendants exchanged information ""which would have been closely guarded secrets between true competitors,"" Pltfs. 'IMC 
Memo. at 7, the date of the Memorandum was February 18, 1986, which predates the alleged conspiracy by over a year and, 
therefore, related to a period of time that the Plaintiffs cite as one of intense competition within the potash industry."
357,31," Although not cited by the Plaintiffs, independent research has drawn our attention to United States v. Container Corp., 393 
U.S. 333, 21 L. Ed. 2d 526, 89 S. Ct. 510 (1969), which, upon a first reading, gave us pause. There, under circumstances which "
358,," bear a similarity to those before us, the Supreme Court concluded that the conduct of price verifications, within a concentrated 
industry, could give rise to liability, under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, even in the absence of an illegal agreement. In a 
concurring opinion, Justice Fortas took pains to assure that the decision would not be read as holding that the exchange of price 
information, even in an oligopoly, should be treated as a per se violation of the Sherman Act. Id. at 339. Consistent with the Plaintiffs' approach, the Defendants also have not addressed the ruling of the Court in Container Corp., but 
have tacitly addressed that ruling by addressing a prior decision of the Court that Container Corp. left intact. See, Cement 
Manufacturers Protective Association v. United States, 268 U.S. 588, 69 L. Ed. 1104, 45 S. Ct. 586 (1925) (recognizing the 
validity of exchanging pricing information so as to curtail arguably fraudulent client practices). Further, the Defendants have 
pointedly relied upon the Supreme Court's subsequent holdings, in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 
441 n. 16, 57 L. Ed. 2d 854, 98 S. Ct. 2864 (1978), and United States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 113, 
45 L. Ed. 2d 41, 95 S. Ct. 2099 (1975), which implicitly adopted Justice Fortas' concurrence as the governing law. We are satisfied that, even if the price verification activities of the Defendants were as systemic and pervasive as those 
suggested in Container Corp., that decision has no continuing viability. Whatever vestiges of Container Corp. remained after the 
Court's subsequent decisions, in Citizens and Gypsum, would surely be eradicated by the Court's pronouncements in Monsanto 
Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 1464 (1984), and in Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. 
Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986). Where, as here, sporadic price verifications have 
occurred, but were generated by the legitimate business purpose of assuring that a customer was not misleading a producer, as 
to the market value of potash, the circumstance of the price verification is ambiguous evidence of price fixing. Accordingly, the 
cases which we cite in the text of this Opinion are, in our view, reflective of the prevailing weight of authority. "
359,32," The Plaintiffs citation to an additional Memorandum, which was authored by Marshall, and dated December 3, 1992, is equally 
non-probative. The Memorandum, which has price lists from IMC and PCS appended to it, stated: ""PCS is not increasing prices 
until Feb. 1, 1993."" NMP/Eddy Memorandum (001525), attached as Tab 8. Pltfs.Jt.Opp.Aff. Once again, however, the manner in 
which Marshall obtained the information contained in the Memorandum is entirely unclear and, by every appearance, PCS's 
stated intent -- not to raise its prices until February 1 -- was intimated on the face of its price list."
359,33," Unfortunately, we are unable to locate this document. Nevertheless, portions of the document's contents have been quoted in 
the Plaintiffs' Cominco Opposition Memorandum, during Hoffman's Deposition, and during the Summary Judgment Hearing. We "
360,," have no cause to doubt the reliability of the contents there quoted. See, Pltfs.'Com. Memo. at 7; Deposition of Steve Hoffman at 
195, attached as Tab 29, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff.; Transcript of Summary Judgment Hearing at 269. "
361,34," Proops' testimony reveals that the document he received from Childers did not include the analysis of IMC and Cominco, 
which had been included in the original Memorandum. Deposition of Jay Proops at 46-47, attached as Tab 41, 
Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Memo. We note that the original version, in addition to separate analyses of Cominco and IMC, also included the 
following summary: PCS's May market share performance is a direct result of low priced selling from our chief competitors, IMC and Kalium. 
Market developments took several forms ranging from broker based activity to freight manipulation. The fact remains that 
IMC and Kalium have not come close to supporting the list price. PCS Spring Competitive Analysis -- Non-Redacted (PC 074283-85), attached as Tab 2, Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Memo. "
362,35," The November 18, 1988 follow-up Memorandum is significant in that it not only supports Kalium's claim, that its pricing did not 
change after Childers' visit, but it also suggests aggressive competition on the part of IMC, Cominco, and Noranda. In this 
regard, the Memorandum states: IMC has set the standard for market share since the beginning of the 1988 calendar year. * * * Market share strides have 
resulted once again from freight manipulation, below market pricing and low prices selling through third parties (brokers). 
Third party selling has produced the greatest market share gains for IMC."
362,*," * * Cominco has missed very few opportunities to sell aggressively. * * * Although menacing, market aggression by Cominco 
was much less frequent and certainly not as wide spread as IMC and Kalium."
362,*," * * Noranda through Terra showed absolutely no support for market pricing. As the fall market weakened Terra managed to 
remain $ 2.00 to $ 4.00/S.T. below competitive levels."
362,*," * * PCS' chief competitors, IMC and Kalium, simply took advantage of PCS market discipline. * * * The lack of competitor 
discipline has had a snow-balling effect on market share. IMC and Kalium have noticeable market share increases as a 
result of the lack of support for market pricing. PCS Competitive Market Analysis (PC 171624), attached as Exhibit 30. Defs.'Jt.Rep.Aff. On December 13, 1988, Jackson summarized PCS's year from a market share perspective. The analysis was included in a 
Memorandum directed to Doyle, which concluded with the following language: "
363,," When assessing the market share situation, it is clear that PCS losses this year result from competitor's low market selling, 
freight manipulation and terms in special situations. PCS has been very disciplined and has refused to sell under the above 
circumstances. Our chief competitors IMC, Kalium and Cominco have taken the ""whatever it takes to get the business"" 
selling approach. PCS 1988 Business Loss Analysis (PC 171619), attached as Exhibit 31. Defs.'Jt.Rep.Aff. In our view, the market analyses performed by PCS not only fail to support the Plaintiffs' alleged conspiracy, but they strengthen 
the Defendants' contention that their pricing activities were not concerted. Lastly, the portrayal of Cominco's aggressive selling undermines the Plaintiffs' assertion that Cominco participated as a 
""teamplayer"" in the conspiracy. Pltfs.'Com.Memo. at 7. To support this assertion, the Plaintiffs have pointed to the following 
statements in the PCS June Competitive Analysis Memorandum: ""Very little of the information we have points to problems 
generated by Cominco. In a few instances Cominco was found to be below the market but their general behavior pointed to 
responsible selling."" PCS Spring Competitive Analysis -- Non-Redacted (PC 074283-85), attached as Tab 2. Pltfs.'Jt.Opp.Aff. 
Even without the follow-up market analyses, however, we conclude that PCS's use of the term ""responsible selling"" is nothing 
more than its unilateral characterization of price-following behavior. "
367,36," While the majority of the Plaintiffs' claims are timely, those claims, which arise more than four years before this action was 
commenced, require proof of fraudulent concealment if they are to remain viable. See, Title 15 U.S.C. § 15b (""any action to 
enforce any cause of action under sections 15 or 15a of this title shall be forever barred unless commenced within four years 
after the cause of action was accrued.""). As the District Court has previously explained, ""the doctrine of fraudulent concealment 
requires plaintiffs to show (1) defendants concealed the conduct complained of and (2) despite the exercise of due diligence, 
plaintiffs failed to discover the facts that form the basis of their claim."" In re Potash Antitrust Litigation, 159 F.R.D. 682, 698-99 
(D. Minn. 1995). Nevertheless, since we have found that an inference of conspiracy is not reasonable, there cannot be a 
concealment of that which does not exist. Accordingly, we do not reach the Defendants' Statute of Limitations defense. "

392,1," The complaint also included nine state-law claims for restraint of trade, intentional or negligent conspiracy to interfere with

394,4," For example, ratepayer subsidization might be available for the construction of NGV fueling stations but the CPUC could 
require that revenues from the operation or transfer of the stations be used to ""repay"" the ratepayers. Or, ratepayer subsidization 
might be allowed only so long as no nonutility enterprises participated in the NGV-infrastructure market."
394,5," This policy is also embodied in § 740.3 of the Public Utilities Code, subsection (a) of which directs the commission to ""evaluate 
and implement policies to promote the development of equipment and infrastructure needed to facilitate the use of . . . natural 
gas to fuel low-emission vehicles"". The legislature specifically directed the commission to implement policies on ""the rate-basing 
of . . . compressor stations for natural gas fueled vehicles"", § 740.3(a)(1), and required that ""the commission's policies . . . 
ensure that utilities do not unfairly compete with nonutility enterprises"", § 740.3(c)."
394,6," We have previously approved the taking of judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) of published decisions of the

396,7," While the CPUC's November 1995 decision may not directly govern the question of state-action immunity for any of the 
SoCalGas activity at issue in this appeal, since Cal CNG filed its complaint in January 1995, the ruling is nonetheless useful in 
assessing California's policy on utility participation in the NGV-infrastructure market in the period leading up to the decision. "
397,8," The complaint does not specifically allege the dates on which the challenged SoCalGas conduct occurred, but it appears that 
the conduct alleged must have taken place between May 1993 and January 1995."
397,9," Neither party has raised the question of whether the ""state action"" immunity for SoCalGas's activities extends beyond July 1993 
for some ""reasonable period"" required for the utility to bring its NGV programs into conformity with the guidelines. We therefore 
need not reach that question on this appeal. "

424,11," Notwithstanding the clarity of these general rules, Plaintiff and Defendant have done an admirable job of pinpointing a 
tendency toward inconsistency in courts' assessment of summary judgment motions in antitrust cases: "
425,," ""The Supreme Court . . . has articulated specific rules which make summary judgment more readily available in cases 
alleging violations of section 1 of the Sherman Act."" DeLong Equipment Co. v. Washington Mills Abrasive Co., 887 F.2d 
1499, 1505 (11th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1081, 108 L. Ed. 2d 943, 110 S. Ct. 1813 (1990). ""Summary judgment should be used cautiously in antitrust cases."" Dunnivant v. Bi-State Auto Parts, 851 F.2d 1575, 1584 
(11th Cir. 1989). "
437,*," Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation."
437,**," Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation."
437,1," The additional distributorships were granted to Defendants-Appellees Cesar Castillo, Inc. and UMECO, Inc., which filed a 
separate brief. At oral argument, Becton Dickinson argued for the Appellees as a group. Where we refer to Becton Dickinson in 
the course of this opinion, we mean our statements to apply to Appellees as a group except where otherwise indicated. Similarly, 
to avoid confusion where referring to the testimony of Jonathan Borschow, Borschow's president, we will refer to him as Mr. 
Borschow and to the company simply as Borschow. "
438,2," At Mr. Borschow's deposition, the parties marked the Distribution Agreement as BDX-1 and the undated outline as BDX-3, and 
throughout its brief Appellant refers to the documents by those numbers. To avoid confusion, however, the Court will refer to 
BDX-1 and BDX-3 as the Distribution Agreement and the Outline, respectively. "
439,3," Judge Acosta took senior status before the motion for reconsideration, and the case was reassigned to Judge Casellas. "
442,4," While the Puerto Rico parol evidence rule permits extrinsic evidence to establish fraud, Borschow does not allege that it was 
fraudulently induced into signing the Distribution Agreement. Nor is a claim of equitable estoppel properly before us. Borschow 
contends for the first time on appeal that Becton Dickinson should be estopped from denying the existence of an exclusive 
contract because of the conduct of its agent, Vallance. As this argument was not made below, it is waived.  Executive Leasing 
Corp., 48 F.3d at 70."
442,5," See Amended Verified Complaint PP 28-29. Plaintiff also asserts a claim under the Clayton Act, § 3, that we need not 
separately address. See Grappone,  Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 858 F.2d 792, 793 (1988) (pointing out that essential 
elements of unlawful tying arrangement are same for alleged violations of Sherman Act § 1 or Clayton Act § 3). In addition, 
Borschow conceded at oral argument that our holding that the Distribution Agreement was non-exclusive would foreclose relief 
on all of its antitrust claims except its tying claim."
442,6," Borschow does not articulate a ""rule of reason"" theory of tying liability. Although the amended verified complaint contains 
conclusory allegations that Becton Dickinson's conduct generally had an adverse effect on competition, there is no evidence in 
the record to support the allegation that the threats of tying had such an adverse impact, or to provide a basis for providing "
443,," further discovery pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). See Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 29-31, 80 L. Ed. 
2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (noting that in absence of per se liability, antitrust plaintiff must prove that defendant's conduct had 
an ""actual adverse effect on competition""); R.W. International Corp. v. Welch Food, Inc., 13 F.3d 478, 487-88 (1st Cir. 1994) 
(rejecting request for further discovery despite conclusory allegations of antitrust injury where plaintiff distributors were in same 
position as defendant to ascertain effect of conduct at issue)."
443,7," This holding also disposes of Borschow's discovery claim. Borschow contends that the district court abused its discretion by 
refusing to allow further discovery. However, no amount of discovery would uncover evidence of a non-existent tie. "
446,1," Rea and Johnson administered the antigens in small doses to their patients in order to determine the patient's sensitivity to the 
substance."
446,2," Rea and Johnson also manufactured and administered ""transfer factor,"" a blood product that is used to fight infections and 
enhance the immune system. Because transfer factor is an ""investigational drug"" requiring approval of the Hospital's Internal 
Review Board, which had not approved it, the Hospital directed Rea and Johnson not to administer it at the Hospital. 
Notwithstanding this instruction, they administered transfer factor to at least one patient after the prohibition. "
447,3," The Hospital's Bylaws provide for the summary suspension of admitting privileges ""whenever action must be taken immediately 
in the best interest of patient care . . . ."" Hospital Bylaws § 8.2. The Bylaws further require, however, that complaints about 
doctors be submitted in writing to the MEC, which is then to forward the complaint to the department head where the activities 
occurred--here, the Department of Internal Medicine. Bylaws § 8.1-1-5. The department head is then required to investigate the 
matter or appoint an ad hoc committee to investigate. Hospital Bylaws § 8.1-3. A written report of the investigation is then sent to 
the MEC, which may then take action. Id. Under this framework, Firstenberg, as the Chairman of Internal Medicine, alone had authority to appoint the members of the 
Committee. "
448,4," The district court found the Hospital, Health Services and Martin jointly and severally liable to Drs. Rea and Johnson for $ 
122,154.00. In addition, the court found the Hospital, Health Services, Martin, Haberer, and Linton jointly and severally liable for 
an additional sum of $ 75,774.00. "
449,5," Rea and Johnson do not appeal the dismissal of their breach of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation claims."
449,6," We note that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a corporation of which a suspended physician is the sole 
shareholder has no standing to sue for damages stemming from the denial of the physician's admitting privileges. See Todorov 
v. DCH Healthcare Auth., 921 F.2d 1438, 1441 n.1 (11th Cir. 1991). In Todorov, the Eleventh Circuit reasoned that ""it is [the 
physician], not [his] corporation, who [is] seeking privileges at [the Hospital] and, thus, the relief prayed for in this case."" Id. Unlike the plaintiff in Todorov, Rea and Johnson do not seek injunctive relief since the Hospital has reinstated their admitting 
privileges. Even if, however, Rea and Johnson sought injunctive relief, PA2 would have constitutional standing to seek damages 
as it was injured by the Hospital's summary suspension of its primary assets, Rea and Johnson. "
450,7," Rea and Johnson also sued under state antitrust law. See Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act, Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code 
§ 15.05(a). Because the Texas Act mandates that its provisions be interpreted in harmony with federal antitrust law, id. at § 
15.04(a), we do not separately analyze the plaintiffs' state law antitrust claims."
450,8," In addition to finding no antitrust conspiracy, the court also found that Rea and Johnson failed to prove that the alleged 
conspiracy unreasonably restrained trade. "
451,9," Six weeks after the Hospital closed the ECU, it was sold by its parent, Health Services, to a new entity, Bedford-Northeast 
Community Hospital, Inc. (""BNECH""). Thus, Rea and Johnson assert that prior to its closing, the Hospital and its soon-to-be 
parent, BNECH, conspired to close the ECU. In addition, they maintain that after the ECU's closing, the Hospital and its previous 
parent, Health Services, conspired not to reopen the ECU. "
454,10," With much less explanation, the district court granted immunity to Firstenberg and Feingold. The court simply found that the 
latter ""did not act with malice and are, therefore, entitled to"" civil immunity."
454,11," Because Rea and Johnson admitted patients at the Hospital only to the ECU, and because, as we have held, supra, the 
Hospital had the proprietary right to close the ECU, they would have generated no patient revenue from hospital admission after 
this date even if their admitting privileges had not been suspended. They therefore can demonstrate no damages after this date 
stemming from the suspension of their admitting privileges. Arguing that the Hospital's closure of the ECU is ""mere subterfuge or retaliation,"" Rea and Johnson urge that the defendants 
""should not be permitted to dichotomize their accountability"" for the damages to Rea and Johnson stemming from their 
suspension. In effect, they argue that they are entitled to damages even after March 26, even though neither they nor any other 
doctor could admit patients to the ECU. We cannot agree. Were we to accept this, the Hospital would be required to pay 
damages to Rea and Johnson notwithstanding its superior legal right to close the ECU. Because the revenue Rea and Johnson 
generated from admitting patients to the ECU would have ceased with the ECU's closure even if they had not been suspended, 
any damages to them resulting from the closure have no causal connection to the denial of their patient privileges, and thus the 
damage award they ask for would give Rea and Johnson a windfall. "
458,1," Blue Cross asserted that Delta Dental no longer followed its recommendations regarding fee schedules, and further claimed 
that Delta Dental had hired an outside consultant to take on Blue Cross' management role."
458,2," Blue Cross formally began competing with Delta Dental upon the January 1993 termination of the Administrative Agreement, 
and thus filed an amended complaint in July of 1993 encompassing the post-entry claims. "
459,3," In its complaint, Blue Cross alleged that by 1991 Delta Dental insured 30% of Rhode Island's population, encompassing 70% of 
the market for Rhode Island dental care financing and services. "
460,4," Local Rule 32 combines the approaches of both the statute and the Federal Rule, listing the eight exceptions in § 636(b)(1)(A) 
as well as using the dispositive-nondispositive language of Rule 72. See D.R.I. R. 32(b) & 32(c). "
462,5," See also 12 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 3076.5 (Pocket Part 1996) (""Rule 72 is in keeping with 
the legislative intent that, at the very least, the eight motions listed in the statute will be governed by the procedures and de novo 
review of Rule 72(b)."")."
462,6," The Court also notes that Giangola has recently been called into question by a subsequent case from the same district. In 
Campbell v. International Business Machs., the district court discusses a post-Giangola Third Circuit decision characterizing an 
order as ""dispositive"" on the ground that ""'it determined with finality the duties of the parties.'"" 912 F. Supp. 116, 119 (D.N.J. 
1996) (quoting N.L.R.B. v. Frazier, 966 F.2d 812, 817 (3d Cir. 1992)). In finding that remand orders are nondispositive, the 
district court stated its belief that ""Giangola would have been decided differently if N.L.R.B. v. Frazier had been on the books."" 
Campbell, 912 F. Supp. at 119."
462,7," ""Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts 
of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or the defendants, to the district court of the 
United States for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending."" 28 U.S.C. § 1441(a)(1994)."
462,8," ""A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 
days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district 
court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. . . . The State court may thereupon proceed with such case."" 
28 U.S.C. § 1447(c)(1994). "
463,9," ""For the purposes of this section and section 1441 of this title [removal] -- (1) a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of 
any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has a principal place of business . . . ."" 28 U.S.C. § 
1332(c)(1994)."
463,10," ""The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the 
United States."" 28 U.S.C. § 1331(1994). "
464,11," The Court notes that a few district courts have given Moitie a broader reading than these circuit courts. See Mechanical 
Rubber & Supply Co. v. American Saw & Mfg. Co., 747 F. Supp. 1292, 1294-96 (finding claim ""sufficiently federal in character"" 
to support removal, where state antitrust claim could have been brought under federal law), vacated in part, 810 F. Supp. 986 
(C.D. Ill. 1990) (relevant portion of prior decision not vacated); Reid v. Walsh, 620 F. Supp. 930, 932-34 (M.D. La. 1985) (federal 
claims ""necessarily presented"" by state securities law claims, where federal lawsuit on same facts filed on same day as state 
action). "
471,1," It is not clear from defendants' motion papers whether they are proceeding under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c). Since defendants 
have filed answers to the amended complaint, the Court treats the motion as having been brought pursuant to Rule 12(c), See 
Ad-Hoc Comm. of Baruch Black & Hispanic Alumni Ass'n v. Bernard M. Baruch College, 835 F.2d 980, 982 (2d Cir. 1987); see 
also 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1367, at 514-17 (1990)."
471,2," These cases are: Victoria Orthopedic Assoc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 93 CV 5904; Nutri-Dyn Midwest Inc. v. Eastman Kodak 
Co., 93 CV 5940; Imco, Ltd. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 93 CV 5941; Westmoreland Professional Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 94 
CV 889; and Michael Cook v. Eastman Kodak Co., 94 CV 890."
471,3," The class in each complaint is defined as: all person, firms, corporations and other entities in the United States (excluding (a) federal, state and local governmental 
entities and political subdivisions, and (b) defendants and co-conspirators, and other manufacturers of medical x-ray film, 
their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates) that purchased medical x-ray film directly from any defendant, or any 
parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, at any time during the period from January 1, 1989 to the present. "
474,4, The deposition does not specify the year in which this meeting took place.
474,5, Bloomquist believes that Gessert showed him this document but did not give it to him.
474,6," Rule 12(b) HN3[
] provides that if, on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleadings are presented and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary 
judgment … and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such a motion by 
Rule 56. "
475,7," Horizontal price fixing involves price-setting agreements entered into by competitors at the same level of the market structure, 
while vertical price fixing consists of pricing agreements between firms at different levels of the market structure, such as 
manufacturers and distributors. See K.M.B. Warehouse Distrib., Inc. v. Walker Mfg. Co., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7253, No. 92 
Civ. 1167, 1994 WL 250115 at *6 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. June 1, 1994), aff'd, 61 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 1995). "
480,8," Because the Court has denied defendant's motion, the Court need not consider the sufficiency of plaintiffs' affidavit filed 
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f). Moreover, because Rule 12(c) provides that all parties be given a reasonable opportunity to 
present materials relevant to a motion that has been converted to one for summary judgment, plaintiff's cross-motion to strike 
defendant's Local 3(g) statement for failing to comply with the Local Rules is denied. "
488,1," At oral argument, the plaintiffs stated that, on appeal, they did not wish to challenge the district court's dismissal of their 
racketeering claims against the Town. Plaintiffs also stipulated that they would not attempt to assert such claims against the 
Town in the future. Accordingly, vis-a-vis the Town, the only damage claims we address are those pursuant to section 1983. "
490,2," In deciding not to address the broader issues discussed in the concurring opinion, we need not necessarily quarrel with our 
respected colleague's analysis. Concededly, dismissal of the complaint based on appellees' assertion of a fact-intensive ""equal 
involvement"" defense would be inappropriate on the undeveloped record presently before the court. The concurring opinion 
hypothesizes that the substance of any such defense would be informed by preexisting federal statutes embodying comparable 
defenses. By contrast, the district court's dismissal depends entirely on the existence, vel non, of either an absolute innocent-
victim ""standing"" requirement or a law-based in pari delicto defense, each of which, by its very nature, is more readily 
susceptible to summary disposition than a fact-intensive ""equal involvement"" defense. Thus we caution that nothing we have 
said is meant to suggest that Congress intended to create either such a ""standing"" requirement or an in pari delicto defense. "
492,3," The federal bribery and gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201, does not, by its terms, apply to local officials such as those involved 
in the instant case, 18 U.S.C. § 201(a)(1), although cases have held the statute applicable where local officials administer 
federally funded programs. See United States v. Velazquez, 847 F.2d 140, 142 (4th Cir. 1988) (concluding deputy sheriff was a 
""public official"" with respect to federal bribery statute, where county jail was under contract with federal government to supervise 
federal prisoners); United States v. Gallegos, 510 F. Supp. 1112, 1114 (D.N.M. 1981) (ruling state government employee who 
worked under direct supervision of federal official in administration of federal grant program was ""public official"" for purpose of 
federal bribery statute). But see United States v. Del Toro, 513 F.2d 656, 662 (2d Cir.) (concluding city administrator who was 
city employee was not a public official even though he administered model cities program, for which the federal government 
provided 100% funding), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 826, 96 S. Ct. 41, 46 L. Ed. 2d 42 (1975). No allegation has been made that the 
defendants' bribery/extortion scheme was in connection with a federal contract or federal funding. "
493,4," Similar to federal RICO, R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-15-2(c) provides that "
494,," it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise to conduct or participate in the conduct of 
the affairs of the enterprise through racketeering activity or collection of an unlawful debt. Rhode Island law also uses broad standing language that resembles that of 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c) in its provision for civil liability 
for racketeering offenses. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-2 (stating that HN14[
] ""whenever any person shall suffer any injury . . . by 
reason of the commission of any crime or offense . . . he [or she] may recover his [or her] damages for such injury in a civil 
action against the offender"") (emphasis added). "
495,5, A successful civil RICO plaintiff may collect reasonable attorney's fees in addition to treble damages.  18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). 
496,6," See, e.g., Kevin Roddy, RICO in Business and Commercial Litigation (1993) (describing Blakey as ""the acknowledged author"" 
of the federal RICO statute and of ""excellent"" commentaries on RICO application)."
496,7," At oral argument, plaintiffs stipulated that their RICO claim is not asserted against the town, but only against the individual 
defendants. "
497,8," Of course, other questions about the parameters of RICO standing are not raised by this case, which concerns only whether 
there is an ""innocent victim"" requirement."
497,9," The court relies on a statement by Representative Steiger on October 7, 1970, that ""it is the intent of this body, I am certain, to 
see that innocent parties who are the victims of organized crime have a right to obtain proper redress."" 116 Cong. Rec. 35,346-
47 (1970). That statement was made during debate over a proposed amendment, ultimately withdrawn, which would have 
authorized private injunctive relief. See Abrams, The Law of Civil RICO § 1.4, at 30 (1991). The district court's characterization of 
the remarks as coming from ""the sponsor of the provision that eventually created a private civil remedy"" could cause a 
misapprehension. In fact, RICO originated in a bill filed in the Senate, S. 30. By October 7, 1970, the Judiciary Committee had 
already reported out that bill, which included ""the RICO provision ultimately enacted as section 1964(c), which created a treble 
damage remedy."" Id. at 30. The debate in which Representative Steiger made the quoted remarks was over private injunctive 
relief. Further, Representative Steiger referred, in the very same remarks relied upon by the district court, to victims of ""organized 
crime."" Yet it was clear to both the House and the Senate that the reach of civil RICO extended well beyond organized crime. 
""Congress knew what it was doing when it adopted commodious language capable of extending beyond organized crime."" H.J., 
Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 492 U.S. 229, 246, 106 L. Ed. 2d 195, 109 S. Ct. 2893 (1989); see also Sedima, 473 U.S. at 
499 (""Congress wanted to reach both 'legitimate' and 'illegitimate' enterprises. The former enjoy neither an inherent incapacity 
for criminal activity nor immunity from its consequences. The fact that § 1964(c) is used against respected businesses allegedly 
engaged in a pattern of specifically identified criminal conduct is hardly a sufficient reason for assuming that the provision is 
being misconstrued."" (citation omitted)); Abrams, supra, § 1.1, at 5 (""RICO's name might suggest that the private cause of action 
reaches primarily racketeers and other organized crime figures. Developments since RICO's 1970 enactment, however, have 
laid firmly to rest any suggestion of limited reach.""). "
498,10," Caselaw holding that minority shareholders suffer no injury to their property apart from the injury the corporation suffers and so 
have no standing to sue under RICO provides no comfort to defendants. Such caselaw does not support the principle that 
reference should be made to state law to determine the contours of any ""innocent victim"" defense. It is true that some decisions 
refer to state law to define property interests of shareholders as opposed to corporations to determine whether the former may 
bring a RICO action. See, e.g., Leach v. FDIC, 860 F.2d 1266 (5th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 491 U.S. 905, 109 S. Ct. 3186, 105 
L. Ed. 2d 695 (1989). Other caselaw, including that of this circuit, see Roeder v. Alpha Indus., 814 F.2d 22, 29-30 (1st Cir. 
1987), refers to general principles of corporate law to hold that a shareholder may not sue under RICO to vindicate a duty owed 
to the corporation. See Rand v. Anaconda Ericsson, Inc., 794 F.2d 843, 849 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 987, 93 L. Ed. 2d 
582, 107 S. Ct. 579 (1986); Warren v. Manufacturers Nat'l Bank of Detroit, 759 F.2d 542, 545 (6th Cir. 1985); Abrams, supra, § 
3.3.6, at 147-52. In any event, the issue of whether state law should be referenced in defining the term ""property"" is simply not 
present in this case."
498,11," If it were, then I would agree that on the facts pleaded it is impossible to draw the conclusion that this case involves 
exclusively bribery."
498,12," This reference to state law is in the context of RICO's definition of predicate offenses. From this, defendants would infer a 
Congressional desire -- expressed nowhere in the statute -to reference state law with respect to affirmative defenses as well. "
499,13," But cf. Sunstein, Standing and the Privatization of Public Law, 88. Colum. L. Rev. 1432, 1433 (1988) (arguing that ""for 
purposes of standing, the principal question should be whether Congress has created a cause of action"")."
499,14," It may also be, as the district court suggested, see Roma, 906 F. Supp. at 82 n.1, that the plaintiffs' relative culpability may be 
considered in deciding, under Holmes, the issue of proximate causation based on the evidence presented. See, e.g., Perma Life 
Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 142-47, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982, 88 S. Ct. 1981 (White, J., concurring) (treating 
relative culpability, in antitrust context, as part of causation analysis), overruled on other grounds by Copperweld Corp. v. 
Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984). The issue of proximate cause may not be 
decided at the pleading stage given the allegations in this complaint. Relative culpability may also be relevant to the measure of damages. The opinions in Perma Life posit that the benefits received 
by a plaintiff from its participation in wrongdoing ""can of course be taken into consideration in computing damages."" Perma Life, 
392 U.S. at 140; see also II Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P365c3, at 248 (1995 rev. ed.)."
499,15," This common law defense derives from the Latin in pari delicto potior est conditio defendant is: ""In a case of equal or mutual 
fault . . . the condition of the [defending] party is the better one."" Black's Law Dictionary 791 (6th ed. 1990). The in pari delicto "
500,," defense, though ""in its classic formulation . . . narrowly limited to situations where the plaintiff truly bore at least substantially 
equal responsibility for his injury . . ."" is now generally given ""a broad application to bar actions where plaintiffs simply have been 
involved generally in 'the same sort of wrongdoing' as defendants."" Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299, 
306-07, 86 L. Ed. 2d 215, 105 S. Ct. 2622 (1985) (quoting Perma Life, 392 U.S. at 138)."
500,16," See, e.g., discussion in footnote 14 supra."
500,17," In Perma Life, five concurring Justices, in four separate opinions, recognized the existence of the equal involvement defense. 
Justice White wrote that he ""would deny recovery where plaintiff and defendant bear substantially equal responsibility for [the] 
injury resulting to one of them . . . ."" 392 U.S. at 146 (White, J., concurring). According to Justice Fortas, ""if the fault of the 
parties is reasonably within the same scale -- if the 'delictum' is approximately 'par' -- then the doctrine should bar recovery."" 392 
U.S. at 147 (Fortas, J., concurring). Justice Marshall wrote that he ""would hold that where a defendant in a private antitrust suit 
can show that the plaintiff actively participated in the formation and implementation of an illegal scheme, and is substantially 
equally at fault, the plaintiff should be barred from imposing liability on the defendant."" 392 U.S. at 149 (Marshall, J., concurring). 
Justice Harlan, in an opinion joined by Justice Stewart, indicated that the defense should be allowed in cases where ""the 
plaintiffs were substantially as much responsible . . . as the defendants."" 392 U.S. at 156 (Harlan, J., concurring in part and 
dissenting in part). "
501,18," There may be situations, not present here, in which the state has such an exceptionally strong policy interest in the 
enforcement of its own laws that Congress would choose to accommodate that interest in the RICO enforcement scheme. This 
may be more true under RICO than other statutes in as much as Congress has referred to violations of state law in defining 
predicate offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)(A). However, the recognition of an interest in enforcement is not the same as the 
recognition of an interest in a defense. The Rhode Island bribery and extortion statutes do not evidence such an overwhelming "
502,," interest in affording defendants an in pari delicto defense, even before reaching the issue of whether Congress would have 
wanted to import Rhode Island law into RICO."
502,19," The district court was very troubled by the notion of rewarding people who pay bribes to public officials with RICO treble 
damages, whatever the circumstances of the payment.  Roma, 906 F. Supp. at 82-83. That is certainly a reasonable concern. 
Policy arguments may be made both for and against such a result. In the antitrust field, the Supreme Court has noted that 
because of the ""important public purposes"" served by private suits, it is inappropriate to invoke ""broad common-law barriers to 
relief."" Perma Life, 392 U.S. at 138. Thus ""the plaintiff who reaps the reward of treble damages may be no less morally 
reprehensible than the defendant, but the law encourages his suit to further the overriding public policy in favor of competition."" 
Id. at 139. This strong enforcement rationale certainly is present in RICO, a statute intended to increase the arsenal of weapons striking at 
criminal activity. In addition, it may be inherently unfair to deny plaintiffs any ability to pursue a RICO claim where their fault is 
relatively small. An absolute ""innocent victim"" requirement would create such an undesirable imbalance. "
512,1," These included special LCE ingredients such as Pan Pan Dough and special spice mixes. Plaintiffs are not challenging Blue 
Line's exclusive distribution of these items. These are different from the ""logoed products"" involved in this motion. These ""logoed 
products"" are not a secret part of the ultimate product being sold and consumed by customers, but cups, boxes, and packaging 
with the famous Little Caesar figure on them that can be produced to quality and design specifications set by LCE."
512,2," The amended Franchise Agreement prevented franchisees from seeking alternate suppliers from ""signage or other products 
bearing the Little Caesar name and Proprietary marks."" Lockridge Declaration, Exhibit 12, referring to § 7 of the Little Caesar 
Franchise Agreement of form AC(8/90). While signage is covered by this agreement, it is a one-time purchase of an outdoor sign 
that requires supplier expertise, and this opinion will use the term ""logoed paper products"" throughout as dealing with the 
relevant limitation in these post mid-1990 franchise agreements. "
516,3," HN7[
] This Court is given broad discretion in dealing with class actions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. Rule 23(c)(1) states that ""[A class certification] order under this subdivision may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the 
merits."" Carpenter v. Stephen F. Austin State University, 706 F.2d 608, rehg. denied, 712 F.2d 1416 (5th Cir. 1983), allowed 
substitution of adequate class representatives for representatives found to be inadequate during the course of the class claims. 
Affording plaintiffs the opportunity to provide such substitutes is the common practice in cases where, although the current 
named representatives are inadequate, adequate representatives are known and available as substitutes.  Davis v. Thornburgh, 
903 F.2d 212, 233 (3rd Cir.) (Becker, CJ, concurring in part and dissenting in part), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 970 (1990); see also, 
Hanzley v. Blue Cross of Western New York, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9308, Unpub. op. No. CIV-86-35E, 1989 WL 39427 
(W.D.N.Y. 1989) (copy attached). Thus, this Court could permit a substitute class representative if it becomes necessary. 
Because any substitute class representative was covered in the earlier motion for class certification and by this motion, the 
statute of limitations has been tolled for substantial periods during this litigation and will continue to be tolled if this proposed 
class is certified. Wright, Miller & Kane, 7B Federal Practice & Procedure: Civil 2d at §§ 1791, 1994. "
517,4," Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d at § 1781, notes: In this connection it uniformly has been held that differences among the members as to the amount of damages incurred 
does not mean that a class action would be inappropriate. Rather, the question of damages can be severed from that of 
liability and tried on an individual basis. Allowing split proceedings furthers the Rule 23 purpose of promoting judicial 
economy . . . . (Footnote omitted.)"
517,5," See, e.g., Story Parchment v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 562, 75 L. Ed. 544, 51 S. Ct. 248 (1931): The rule which precludes recovery of uncertain damages applies to such as are not the certain result of the wrong, not to 
those damages which are definitely attributable to the wrong and only uncertain in respect of their amount. "

521,7," While it could be argued that demonstration of coercion by proofs extrinsic to the contract should preclude class treatment 
under Rule 23(b)(8), it is clear that in Bogosian, proof of the practical economic effects would indeed require such extrinsic 
proofs, probably by an economic expert, as to the practical market effects and limitations a gas station operator faced in light of 
the various contract terms."
521,8," Bogosian noted that several cases involving coercion in a tie-in setting dealt with a pattern of making a request or suggestion 
that the buyer acquire the tied product from the seller ""coupled with pressure, intimidation, in short . . . coercion."" 561 F.2d at 
451. It is clear, in a case in which the tie is to be established by a request or a suggestion followed by pressure, intimidation, or 
traditional types of coercion, that individual proofs would generally predominate and a class action would be inappropriate."
521,9," Other courts have explained why HN15[
] coercion is implied where a contract explicitly requires the tie because a contract ""is 
backed by the force of law."" Halverson v. Convenient Food Mart, Inc., 69 F.R.D. 331, 335 (N.D. Ill. 1974); McCoy v. Convenient 
Food Mart, Inc., 69 F.R.D. 337, 340 (N.D. Ill. 1975). Coercion remains a necessary element of an unlawful tying arrangement but 
it is inferred on a class-wide basis; a contractual provision is coercive in and of itself because it is backed by the force of law. 
See also, 7- Eleven Franchise Antitrust Litigation, 1972 Trade Cas. (CCH) P74,156 (N.D.Cal. 1972). "
523,10," As noted above, the Third Circuit state in Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086, 
55 L. Ed. 2d 791, 98 S. Ct. 1280 (1978), that the rule against ties ""seeks to deter the act of the seller conditioning sale of one 
product on the purchase of another."" 561 F.2d at 450 (emphasis in the original). ""The issue is whether the seller acted in a 
certain way, not what the buyer's state of mind would have been absent the seller's action."" Id."
523,11," Defendants here argue that this requires an inquiry into whether Little Caesar franchisees felt coercion to buy from Blue Line. 
Yet, for reasons stated below, the actual and anticompetitive effects in the marketplace can occur without proof that the 
individual franchisees knew of them or of the reasons for them. "
524,12," If the issue of whether defendants would have purchased from Blue Line at higher costs (even if they had a choice) was 
relevant, then individual proofs of each franchisee would predominate."
524,13," Martino v. McDonald's System, Inc., 81 F.R.D. 81 (N.D. Ill. 1979) (prior to the express tie-in in 1964, from 1961-1964 
McDonald's had a uniform policy of tying a lease from a subsidiary of the defendant to McDonald's franchisees.)"
524,14," Hill v. A-T-O, Inc., 535 F.2d 1349, 1354 (2d Cir. 1976) (The sale of a vacuum cleaner was tied to the sale of membership in a 
buying club. The sale of these items was done by door-to-door salespersons, and it was undisputed that the only way one could 
buy a membership in the buying club was to also purchase a compact vacuum cleaner.) "
525,15," In Image Technical Services v. Eastman Kodak Co., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12652, 1994 WL 508737 (N.D.Calif. 1994), Kodak 
was selling replacement parts for its copiers only to buyers who agreed not to buy service for the machines from independent 
service organizations. In certifying a class action, the district court addressed the 23(b)(3) issue of predominance by noting that 
plaintiffs sought to prove coercion under Ninth Circuit case law that permits coercion to be implied from proof that ""an 
appreciable number of buyers have accepted burdensome terms, such as a tie-in, and there exists sufficient economic power in 
tying market."" Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews and Co., 550 F.2d 1207, 1217 (9th Cir. 1977). See also, Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice 
Cream Co., 78 F.R.D. 108, 118-19 (C.D. Cal. 1978)."
525,16," While the Ninth Circuit accepts such proofs as adequate proofs of coercion, the Third Circuit in Ungar v. Dunkin' Donuts, 531 
F.2d 1211, 1225 (3d Cir. 1976), discussed in detail above, held that such proofs constitute ""some evidence of coercion,"" but 
could not ""accept the proposition that such proof, alone, would suffice to establish, prima facie the coercion element of an illegal 
tie-in claim."""
525,17," Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 78 F.R.D. 108, 118-19 (C.D. Cal. 1978). The defendant had admitted to the Federal 
Trade Commission that its subsidiary was the prime lessor on all of its stores, and that all stores were fully equipped and ready 
for operation when turned over to a franchisee. Id. at 118. The court noted that in the absence of such an admission of the 
universal acceptance of the lease and initial equipment package, the court would not certify a class. Id. at 119. While the court 
found that the coercion element in its case was amenable to common proof on the tie between the franchise and the lease and 
equipment package, these claims were not certified for class treatment because common proofs did not exist on the fact of 
damage with respect to these alleged ties. "
532,18," An issue that has not been briefed or argued and awaits further judicial resolution is whether the subclass of ""hybrid"" 
franchisees, who also had an old franchise agreement without the restrictive language and were permitted to seek alternate 
suppliers of paper products but failed to do so, have a tie-in claim? "
534,19," Obviously an ultimate issue for the Court is whether defendants' strategy to limit access to the logoed products was a legal or 
an illegal business practice. For purposes of this motion for class certification, this Court must assume that plaintiffs' legal theory 
on this is correct, unless this Court wishes to invite and resolve motions for summary judgment of the issue prior to determining 
whether to certify a class. Compare Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 955 
(1972), where it was held impermissible for the franchisor to control distribution of items needed for operation of a franchise 
when the criteria for those items could be set by specifications, with Krehl v. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream Co., 78 F.R.D. 108 
(1978), in which the court held that the franchisor could control distribution of the product when it was the ultimate product being 
consumed by the customer. In the present case, the logoed items are sold to the customer, but, unlike Baskin-Robbins, these 
are not the products actually consumed by the customer."
534,20," In a June 19, 1989, letter from David Deal when he was Senior Vice-President at Blue Line to Fred Dietrick at Food Services 
Enterprises, Inc., in Rocky River, Ohio, Deal noted that they had compared Blue Line's cost with that of a competitive distributor, 
Gordon's. He noted that Blue Line was producing a comparable cost result. With regard to ""lower volume food items on the list,"" 
Deal acknowledged ""we are purchasing much lower volumes than our competition and I would expect [these items] to be 
somewhat higher"" (Bates # 00064). "
535,21," In a January 21, 1993, memo from AmeriServ, it was noted that ""without the logo products, it will be very difficult to make a 
successful program."" Plaintiffs' Exh. 19. "
536,22," It could be honestly said that Siwek and Nelson were stating that I had also made a similar mistake in my earlier Report and 
Recommendation when I suggested that impact could only be proven on a regional basis. For reasons stated in footnote 29 
below, I believe I did make this mistake in my earlier Report."

537,24," Again, in Bogosian there had to be proofs external to the contract to show its practical economic effect."
537,25," See also, Bogosian (Remand) opinion, 596 F. Supp. 621 (E.D.Pa. 1984). "
538,26," As noted by Areeda, Hovenkamp and Elhauge: The best way to test whether buyers would otherwise have taken the defendant's tied product would be to offer the tying 
and tied products separately. If the best the defendant can say about an otherwise unlawful tie is that it has no effect, there 
is little reason to tolerate it. (Footnote omitted.) Areeda, supra at 296."
538,27," See Areeda, Hovenkamp and Elhauge, supra, § 1756, pp. 314-323."
538,28," The ""one-stop"" v. ""two-stop"" preference is not a critical issue if alternate competitors cannot compete without logoed goods as 
part of their mix. Also, the Court need not hear from every franchisee to determine whether offering ""one-stop"" shopping with a 
full line of products is a competitive advantage over offering only the non-logoed products. If it is a competitive advantage of 
some significance, as defendants seem to admit in their memoranda, and if it is obtained by an impermissible means, then an 
illegal tie-in could be established on this by predominately common proofs. "
539,29," If one uses heuristically the Deal to Ilitch memo of April 20, 1992, to posit the hypothetical assumption that plaintiffs could 
prove that Blue Line would lower its profit margin by ""1.0 to 1.255 percentage points"" in areas faced with a potential competitor 
and ""about one-half that amount at other [Blue Line distribution] centers,"" then the issue of impact could be shown nationwide 
with common proofs. The analysis in my earlier Report and Recommendation at pp. 55-58, on the need for regional proofs, then 
would be applicable only to the exact measure of damages--i.e., does the class member get damages of 1% of past purchases 
because there was an available alternate distributor in the region or only 1/2% of past sales as damages because there was no 
immediately available alternate distributor. In my earlier Report and Recommendation, I discounted plaintiffs' asserted common 
proofs of impact and confused them with the types of proofs needed to prove actual damages. Such fact-finding is inappropriate 
in a determination on class certification, and in this Report and Recommendation I do not wish to repeat this error."
539,30," As noted by the Sixth Circuit in Sterling v. Velsicol Chemical Corp., 855 F.2d 1188, 1197 (6th Cir. 1988): No matter how individualized the issue of damages may be, these issues may be reserved for individual treatment with the 
question of liability tried as a class action. Consequently, the mere fact that questions peculiar to each individual member of 
the class remain after the common questions of the defendant's liability have been resolved does not dictate the conclusion 
that a class action is impermissible. I am also familiar with In re Consumers Power Securities Litigation, 105 F.R.D. 583 (E.D. Mich. 1985). In that case the damages 
issues involved sales on multiple dates at different prices of Consumers' various securities, which prices were allegedly inflated 
due to varying degrees of non-disclosure about the problems that Consumers Power was having with the development of its 
nuclear power facility at Midland, Michigan. The difference money calculations for each sale of security based upon an imputed 
actual fair market value had disclosures been made involved damages calculations of complexities at least equal to those in this 
case, if not far more complex."
539,31," Plaintiffs' experts Siwek and Nelson have proposed various formulaic methods to compute damages. Even if this Court does 
not select a formulaic method to compute damages on a class-wide basis or by regions, it is not clear that a series of individual 
mini-trials would be necessary given the historical trend that many complex cases settle once the liability issues have been 
determined. "
540,32, See footnote 3 above and surrounding text.
540,33," The Court may determine that injunctive relief is not necessary in light of the fact that defendants recently have approved 
alternate distributors and have given them access to logoed products."
540,34, See footnote 3 above and surrounding text. 
547,1, The facts relevant to the instant motions either have been alleged by the plaintiff or are not in dispute.
547,2, The defendants have not moved for summary judgment on the count III claims that allege violations of RSA § 356:3. 
549,3," Section 766 of the Restatement provides: Intentional Interference with Performance of Contract by Third Person HN5[
] One who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract (except a contract to marry) 
between another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract, is subject 
to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to the other from the failure of the third person to perform the contract."
549,4," Section 766B of the Restatement provides: Intentional Interference with Prospective Contractual Relation HN6[
] One who intentionally and improperly interferes with another's prospective contractual relation (except a contract 
to marry) is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary harm resulting from loss of the benefits of the relation, whether 
the interference consists of (a) inducing or otherwise causing a third person not to enter or continue the prospective relation or (b) preventing the other from acquiring or continuing the prospective relation. "
550,5," The statute provides: HN12[
] Any individual entitled to insurance benefits under this subchapter may obtain health services from any 
institution, agency, or person qualified to participate under this subchapter if such institution, agency, or person undertakes 
to provide him such services."
550,42, U.S.C.A. § 1395a (West 1992). 
551,6," The court pauses to note that its resolution of the instant motion has been hampered by the amoebic nature of the plaintiff's 
claims. Prior to specifying the provisions of § 1395 under which it is seeking relief, the plaintiff distinguished Mays and Currie on 
the ground that they involved provisions that were ""entirely different"" than those implicated by the instant action. Memorandum of 
Law in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss at 6. It was only after twice being ordered by the court to specify the provisions under 
which it was proceeding that the plaintiff made reference to § 1395a, the very provision under which Mays and Currie were 
decided, and § 1395nn."
551,7," HN15[
] RSA § 125:25-b requires physicians with ownership interests in the entities to which they refer patients to disclose the nature of their interests to their patients. RSA § 125:25-c requires health care practitioners and entities owned by health care 
practitioners to disclose such interests to the state division of public health services."
551,8," HN16[
] The statute requires practitioners having an ownership interest in an entity to which he is referring patients to include 
the following language conspicuously on the face of a written referral: The referring health care practitioner maintains an ownership interest in the facility to which you are being referred. You are 
not required to utilize the facility to which you are being referred for these services. These services may be available 
elsewhere in the community. This office will provide an alternate referral upon your request. RSA § 125:25-b(III). "
557,1," Plaintiffs seek to interpret this definition as including those who purchased citric acid outside the United States, as well. The 
definition is not susceptible to this interpretation. "
560,2," The Court's analysis is hindered by the failure of either side to provide complete deposition transcripts. This evaluation is 
therefore based only on review of selected excerpts."
560,3," Moreover, defendants' allegations of unfamiliarity frequently overstate the case. For example, defendants suggest that Daniel 
Weiss, corporate representative for Trans-Packers Services, had ""no idea"" about Trans-Packers' purchase volume in recent 
years. Def. Mem. at 7. In fact, the deposition transcript reveals that Mr. Weiss characterized the volume as small, and merely 
stated that he could not give precise percentages. Weiss Dep. at 17. Read in context, the testimony of the corporate 
representatives does not demonstrate startling unfamiliarity. "
561,4," Defendants assert that purchasing through a cooperative is not the norm. This fact actually supports the need for class 
representatives who used cooperatives to assure that their interests do not go unheard in the litigation. "
562,5," Defendants correctly identify shortcomings with plaintiffs' other proposed methodologies; Dr. Harris does not suggest an 
industry to which citric acid can be compared for purposes of evaluating economic rate of return, and he cannot ""confidently 
recommend"" the capacity utilization approach. Harris Decl. at 16. "
568,1," Under § 1, plaintiff also must show that the restraint affects interstate or foreign commerce. However, since there is no dispute 
that Delta's alleged conduct affects interstate commerce, I do not discuss this element here."
568,2," ""HN5[
] Per se rules of illegality are appropriate only when they relate to conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive."" Continental T.V., Inc. v. Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 49-50, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. Ct. 2549 (1977). "
569,3," The Continental T.V. Court took note of the fact-intensive inquiry the rule of reason analysis requires, stating: One of the most frequently cited statements of the rule of reason is that of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Chicago Board of Trade 
v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918): ""HN6[
] The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby 
promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question 
the court must ordinarily consider facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before 
and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effects, actual or probable. The history of the 
restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be 
attained, are all relevant factors."" Continental T.V., supra, at 49. "
571,4," Rule 7 provides: Verification program. Delta Dental at all times reserves the right to review services rendered and fees charged by 
participating and nonparticipating dentists or group practices with respect to which benefits are sought. Such review may 
encompass, without limitation verification of … fees charges and collections made with respect to non-subscriber patients… Complaint, P 14. "
572,5," This point is highlighted by the difference in postures between Kartell and the case here. In Kartell, the plaintiff represented a 
group of physicians challenging Blue Shield's policy, in large part because Blue Shield's reimbursement rates were so low that 
they reduced physician profits. These low prices, however, benefitted Blue Shield enrollees through lower premium rates. Here, 
plaintiff is the United States. Rhode Island dentists apparently do not disapprove of Delta's Prudent Buyer clause. In fact, the 
chair of Rhode Island Dental Association's Council on Dental Programs supports Delta's Prudent Buyer policy because he feels 
that the policy sets a floor on dentists' fees. Memorandum of the United States in Opposition to the Defendant's Objections to the 
Magistrate's Report and Recommendation, at 9; Complaint, P22. "
575,6," Plaintiff's non-discrimination clause, as Delta notes in its memorandum in support of their objections to the Magistrate's Report 
and Recommendation, is similar to Delta's Prudent Buyer clause. "
576,7," In fact, the Oregon Dental court ""looked to federal decisions interpreting section 2 of the Sherman Act for persuasive … 
guidance."" Oregon Dental, supra, at 640. "
581,7," Justice Bass, who retired on May 31, 1993, continues to sit by assignment for the disposition of this case, which was submitted 
prior to that date. "
582,1," The defendants describe Dr. Winston as having received temporary staff privileges while his application for permanent staff 
privileges was being considered. This application for permanent status was what was later denied and then withdrawn. Dr. 
Winston notes that he was not unknown to the Hospital when he filed the '81 application. While Dr. Winston was completing his 
medical residency, he received privileges beginning in April 1979 limited to the Department of Emergency Medicine."
582,2," The type of staff privileges sought by Dr. Winston would allow him to admit patients, provide care, and perform certain general 
types of medical and surgical procedures at the hospital. "
586,3," See National Soc'y of Professional Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 688-92, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 1363-65, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 
(1978), for an analysis of the distinction between these types of trade restraints. "
589,4," Defendants also urge our consideration of Gutierrez v. Lee, 812 S.W.2d 388, 392 (Tex. App.--Austin 1991, writ denied). In 
Guiterrez, the Austin Court found 16.064 inapplicable to the facts of the case before it for substantive reasons. We are not bound 
by the court's suggestion of how 16.064 would have been unhelpful to the Lees even if it did apply."
589,5," Because we resolve the case as to all parties later in the opinion with regard to the causes of action arising from the denial of 
Dr. Winston's application for staff privileges, it is unnecessary here to distinguish between the corporate and individual 
defendants relative to application of the tolling statute. Obviously, the corporate defendant had not left the state. "
590,6," We note that under Dr. Winston's theory of the case, the denial of staff privileges was not an end in itself, but evidence of a 
broader illegal objective, the taking of his medical business. We have not been asked to discuss other acts allegedly taken in 
furtherance of the alleged conspiracy, such as the hiring of Dr. Winston's office manager, as they might impact our consideration 
of the limitations issues. "
591,7," Justice Bass, who retired on May 31, 1993, continues to sit by assignment for the disposition of this case, which was submitted 
prior to that date. "
601,1," For purposes of this motion, I treat plaintiffs' factual allegations as true. "
602,2," I will hereafter refer to the Ninth Circuit's decision as ""Hartford"", to conform to the title of the case in the Supreme Court. "
603,3," The text of the Act submitted with the motion papers includes all amendments as of June 30, 1993. "
606,4," These statements run equally counter to defendants' invocation of the doctrines of international comity and foreign sovereign 
compulsion. "
608,5," Whatever limitations on this principle may arise from § 402 of the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA), 
15 U.S.C. § 6a, do not apply to the case at bar, since the FTAIA specifically excludes from its coverage ""import trade or import 
commerce."" "
609,6," While the amended complaint does not name the cooperatives or make them parties defendant, that does not render the 
pleading defective. HN15[
] There is ""no requirement that a plaintiff name . . . all co-conspirators as long as their existence is 
set forth in the complaint."" Eye Encounter, Inc. v. Contour Art, Ltd., 81 F.R.D. 521, 524 (S.D.N.Y. 1981). The pleading's 
reference to collective conduct on the part of New Zealand dairy farmers is sufficient to implicate the cooperatives, and of course 
defendants know who they are. See also Volvo North America Corp., 857 F.2d at 71 (requisite plurality of conspirators 
sufficiently pleaded where named association consisted of multiple entities acting as joint venturers, although those entities were 
not named or made parties defendant). "
611,7," Defendants' brief also challenges the sufficiency of plaintiff's Sherman Act § 1 claim for failing to allege the relevant market or 
the factors involved in rule of reason analysis. But the amended complaint clearly alleges HN18[
] a horizontal price-fixing 
conspiracy which, if proved, constitutes a per se violation; to sustain that claim, plaintiffs need not plead or prove a relevant 
market, 7 Areeda, Antitrust § 1510 at 415, nor demonstrate that defendants' conduct was economically reasonable, Topco, 405 
U.S. at 608-12; United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U.S. 392, 397-98, 71 L. Ed. 700, 47 S. Ct. 377 (1927). "
612,8," I construe the phrase ""co-conspirators"" to mean the 15 dairy cooperatives. Even if the named defendants and the cooperatives 
should be regarded as a single economic entity so that they could not conspire together, see discussion under Point III-A supra, 
their joint conduct may constitute the possession and exercise of monopoly power in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. "
636,1," Federal Express argues that neither MAC nor any other federal government instrumentality are a ""person"" within the meaning 
of the Sherman Act. Deft's Motion at 19 (citing United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 85 L. Ed. 1071, 61 S. Ct. 742

638,2," Joint ventures present a difficult concept for antitrust analysis, defying neat classification and precise definition and, by 
extension, well established rules for evaluating their competitive impact. COMPACT v. Metropolitan Govt. of Nashville & 
Davidson Cty., 594 F. Supp. 1567, 1574 (M.D. Tenn. 1984). "
646,1," The Revised Organic Act of 1954 is found at 48 U.S.C §§ 1541-1645 (1995), reprinted in V.I. CODE ANN., Historical 
Documents, 73-177 (codified as amended) (1995) [""Revised Organic Act""]. "
647,2," The issue in United States v. Cooper, 312 U.S. 600, 85 L. Ed. 1071, 61 S. Ct. 742 (1941), was whether the United States could 
bring treble damage civil actions against antitrust violators. Cooper held that United States was not a ""person"" under the antitrust 
laws. In 1955 Congress responded to issue raised in Cooper by adding section 4(a) to the Clayton Act, which authorizes the 
United States to sue alleged antitrust violators for actual, but not treble, damages. See Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Alaska R.R., 
212 U.S. App. D.C. 197, 659 F.2d 243, 245 (1981). The congressional action did not disturb Cooper's holding that the United 
States is not a ""person."" "
648,3," The District of Columbia is governed by Congress under art. I, § 8, cl. 17 of the Constitution, whereas Congress derives its 
authority over the territories under Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2. The two constitutional grants of power to Congress often have 
been considered together and treated as having similar parameters. See, e.g., O'Donoghue v. United States, 289 U.S. 516, 541-
42, 77 L. Ed. 1356, 53 S. Ct. 740 (1933)."
648,4," Puerto Rico is fundamentally an unincorporated territory, still subject to art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 of the Constitution, even though the 
people of Puerto Rico have entered into a compact with the Congress by which Puerto Rico has its own 'constitution' and is 
called a 'commonwealth'. See Statement of the Hon. Elton Gallegly, June 26, 1996, available in WESTLAW, USTESTIMONY 
library, 1996 WL 374770 (during committee markup of H.R. 3024, the United States-Puerto Rico Status Act, Gallegly stated, "
649,," ""The 'Commonwealth' choice in the bill now accurately describes the current Commonwealth status as a territory, which is not 
permanent, and cannot guarantee equal benefits and rights for the people of Puerto Rico. Congress retains discretion under the 
Constitution's Territory Clause as to what laws apply to Puerto Rico.""); compare United States v. Sanchez, 992 F.2d 1143, 1151 
(11th Cir. 1993) (Puerto Rico is still constitutionally a territory and not a separate sovereign); with United States v. Andino, 831 
F.2d 1164, 1168 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that for double jeopardy purposes Puerto Rico is a separate sovereign like a state)."
649,5," See Ngiraingas v. Sanchez, 858 F.2d 1368, 1371 (9th Cir. 1988), aff'd, 495 U.S. 182, 110 S. Ct. 1737, 109 L. Ed. 2d 163 
(1990). "
650,6," Since the Government of the Virgin Islands has an autonomy similar to that of a state, including such attributes as sovereign 
immunity, the statutory construction for our dual system of government is as appropriate for the Virgin Islands as it is for a state. 
See Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 at 346, 351, 87 L. Ed. 315, 63 S. Ct. 307 (1943). "
651,7," WICO cites a fifth circuit case to support its contention that the clear articulation test has been met. Independent Taxicab 
Drivers' v. Greater Houston Transportation, 760 F.2d 607 (1985). Independent Taxicab Drivers involved a challenge to a city's 
grant of an exclusive contract to one taxicab company for the transportation of passengers from the city's airport. Like WICO the 
city was authorized to operate the airport and ""enter into contracts, leases and other arrangements . . . ."" Unlike WICO, however, 
the city was also authorized to ""regulate, license and fix the charges and fares made by any person"" who owns or operates 
taxicabs. Thus the state empowered the city with broad authority to regulate the taxicab industry and the airport. Here, WICO is 
simply vested with authority to enter into contracts; it is not vested with broad authority to regulate the taxicab industry."
651,8," Such ""non-fundamental"" provisions of the Constitution are applicable to an unincorporated territory only to the extent Congress 
makes them applicable. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244, 266-67, 45 L. Ed. 1088, 21 S. Ct. 770; Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 
298, 312-13, 66 L. Ed. 627, 42 S. Ct. 343; cf. Dorr v. United States, 195 U.S. 138, 145, 149, 49 L. Ed. 128, 24 S. Ct. 808. "
653,9," The second sentence of section one of the Fourteenth Amendment is applicable to the Virgin Islands. Revised Organic Act § 3; 
48 U.S.C. § 1561. That sentence reads in full: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor 
shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its 
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. U.S. CONST. Amend. XIV, § 1. "
658,1," Plaintiff also alleges that defendants violated the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act, breach of duty of good faith and fair 
dealing, unjust enrichment, and Mississippi laws. "
659,2," BFI is a Delaware holding company of BFIT and other subsidiary companies with its principal place of business in Texas. 
Plaintiff has acknowledged that BFIT is the principal defendant. "
660,3," Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire 
with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, . . ."""
660,4," This action was ended by a consent injunctive decree and it does not appear that federal jurisdiction (interstate commerce) was 
questioned. "
661,5," Indeed, if plaintiff is unable to establish the necessary predominantly intrastate activity there is no basis for a state antitrust 
claim. "
666,*," The Honorable William D. Browning, United States District Judge for the District of Arizona, sitting by designation."
666,1," ""A 'tariff' is a document that a regulated firm files with its regulatory agency, requesting that it be required to charge certain 
prices, offer certain prices, offer certain packages of services, have certain policies respecting treatment of customers, and the 
like. Once the tariff has been approved by the agency, the firm is legally obliged to follow the tariff."" H. Hovenkamp, Federal 
Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and its Practice § 20.3 at 677 n.5 (West 1994)."
666,2," The complaint alleges that the ""relevant market"" includes ""a geographic area extending from approximately Everett, 
Washington, to the north, to Chehalis, Washington, to the south, and east as far as Monroe, Washington."" "
667,3, WNG concedes that it has a monopoly over gas delivery.
667,4," Neither the district court's order nor any of the parties' appellate briefs discusses the latter two of CMS's four theories. 
Accordingly, we will not reach the merits of those allegations. "
668,5," For a comprehensive discussion of the state action immunity doctrine, see Federal Antitrust Policy, supra at §§ 20.1 - 20.8. "
669,6," WNG urged this court that Tanner Elec. v. Puget Sound Power & Light, 128 Wash. 2d 656, 911 P.2d 1301 (Wash. 1996) was 
controlling with respect to the preeminence of regulatory law. In light of our conclusion on the applicability of the state action 
immunity doctrine, we need not consider that case on these facts."
669,7," The phrase ""Keogh doctrine"" is usually applied in cases involving rates filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, 
whereas the ""filed rate doctrine"" applies more broadly to cases involving rates filed with any regulatory body. See, e.g., Lifschultz 
Fast Freight, Inc. v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware, 805 F. Supp. 1277, 1294 n.32 (D.S.C. 1992), aff'd, 998 F.2d 
1009 (4th Cir. July 6, 1993) (unpublished disposition), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 993, 126 L. Ed. 2d 454, 114 S. Ct. 553 (1993). 
However, we have also applied the ""Keogh doctrine"" in cases involving state regulatory agencies. See, e.g.  Brown v. Ticor Title 
Ins. Co., 982 F.2d 386, 393-94 (9th Cir. 1992), cert. granted, 510 U.S. 810, 114 S. Ct. 56, 126 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1993), cert. 
dismissed as improvidently granted, 511 U.S. 117, 114 S. Ct. 1359, 128 L. Ed. 2d 33 (1994). Accordingly, we will use the terms 
""Keogh doctrine"" and ""filed tariff doctrine"" interchangeably. "
671,8," Justice Marshall dissented, noting that ""Judge Friendly cogently and comprehensively explained why the reasoning of [Keogh] 
has been rendered obsolete by subsequent developments in the law."" Square D, 476 U.S. at 424-25 (Marshall, J., dissenting)."
671,9," The Court's description of the Keogh rule clarifies that Keogh only precludes claims based specifically on rates approved by the 
relevant regulatory agency. See Keogh, 260 U.S. at 161 (""The instrument by which Keogh is alleged to have been damaged is 
rates approved by the Commission.""); Square D, 476 U.S. at 414 (Keogh precludes ""a treble-damages action based on the filed 
tariffs"") (emphasis added). Accordingly, the only one of CMS's allegations which might arguably be barred by Keogh is its 
allegation that WNG has included anticompetitive provisions within Tariff 57; this is, in effect, an action ""based on the filed tariff."" 
However, to the extent that CMS's other allegations are not ""rate-related,"" they would not be barred by Keogh. See, e.g., In re 
Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation, 998 F.2d 1144, 1159 (3rd Cir.) (Keogh ""does not preclude liability based on non-
rate anticompetitive activity""), cert. dismissed, 510 U.S. 1021 (1993); Pinney Dock & Transport Co. v. Penn Cent. Corp., 838 
F.2d 1445, 1457 (6th Cir.) (""To the extent that these alleged acts are unrelated to defendants' rates, any damages suffered 
therefrom would not be barred by Keogh.""), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 880, 102 L. Ed. 2d 166, 109 S. Ct. 196 (1988). "
672,10," We note that one district court, which relied on Pinney Dock, also held that Keogh bars competitor suits. See Lifschultz Fast 
Freight, Inc. v. Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware, 805 F. Supp. 1277 (D.S.C. 1992), aff'd, 998 F.2d 1009 (4th Cir. 
July 6, 1993) (unpublished disposition), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 993, 126 L. Ed. 2d 454, 114 S. Ct. 553 (1993). "
674,11," For a discussion of the primary jurisdiction doctrine, see Federal Antitrust Policy, supra § 19.4 at 655-57. "
675,12," We note in passing that we are not entirely persuaded that the doctrine should be applied in any event to allow a federal court 
to ""route"" issues to a state agency for resolution. In Industrial Communications Sys., Inc. v. Pacific Tel. & Tel. Co., 505 F.2d 152 
(9th Cir. 1974), we did apply the doctrine to stay proceedings in federal court pending a decision by the California Public Utilities 
Commission on whether certain proposed tariffs would become effective. However, in our more recent decisions, we have 
emphasized that because ""the primary jurisdiction doctrine is in effect, a power-allocating mechanism, a court must not employ 
the doctrine unless the particular division of power was intended by Congress."" General Dynamics, 828 F.2d at 1363 n.13 
(emphasis added); see also P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application Par. 
213, at 79 (1978) (noting that the primary jurisdiction doctrine ""is designed to harmonize the conflicting commands of the same 
sovereign"" and is ""not well-suited for a situation in which the conflict is between commands of two different sovereigns, one of 
whom is superior by force of the Constitution""). However, because we conclude that the doctrine is inapplicable in this appeal in 
any event, we need not decide this question."
675,13," We have explained that HN8[
] to show antitrust injury, a plaintiff must prove that his loss flows from an anticompetitive aspect or effect of the 
defendant's behavior, since it is inimical to the antitrust laws to award damages for losses stemming from acts that do not 
hurt competition. If the injury flows from aspects of the defendant's conduct that are beneficial or neutral to competition, 
there is no antitrust injury, even if the defendant's conduct is illegal per se. Rebel Oil Co., Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1433 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 133 L. Ed. 2d 424, 116 S. Ct. 515 
(1995). "
676,14," The question of whether a party possesses monopoly power is essentially one of fact.  Los Angeles Land Co. v. Brunswick 
Corp., 6 F.3d 1422, 1425 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1197, 127 L. Ed. 2d 658, 114 S. Ct. 1307 (1994)."
676,15," The terms ""market power"" and ""monopoly power"" are used interchangeably herein. "
677,16," See also Federal Antitrust Policy, supra § 7.9, at 283-85 (criticizing Berkey Photo's ""monopoly leveraging"" theory). "
678,17," ""Predatory pricing occurs when a company that controls a substantial market share lowers its prices to drive out competition 
so that it can charge monopoly prices, and reap monopoly profits, at a later time."" Transamerica Computer Co., Inc. v. 
International Business Machines Corp., 698 F.2d 1377, 1384 (9th Cir.) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 955, 78 L. Ed. 
2d 329, 104 S. Ct. 370 (1983)."
678,18," Judge Sneed dissented from the majority's conclusion that the plaintiff's claim stated a cause of action under Section 1, rather 
than Section 2, of the Sherman Act: ""Our cases have always treated predatory pricing as a violation of Section 2, not Section 1."" 
Id. (Sneed, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). "
687,1," Lawson Mardon's predecessor-in-interest, Crocker, was the previous licensee. "
689,2," ""This evolution in judicial thinking is based on a reevaluation of the economic theory associated with tying. Originally, tying was 
condemned because of a fear that a firm with monopoly power in the tying product market would be able to use that power as a 
lever into the tied product market. The leverage theory underpinning the per se treatment of tying has lost favor, however, as 
economists today generally concede that tying cannot transfer monopoly power from one market to another."" Servicetrends, Inc. 
v. Siemens Medical Systems, Inc., 870 F. Supp. 1042, 1060 n.11 (N.D. Ga. 1994)."
689,3," Compare Graphic Products Distributors v. Itek Corp., 717 F.2d 1560, 1568 (11th Cir. 1983) (holding anticompetitive effect to be 
""at the center of the analysis"" of vertical nonprice restraint claim). "
691,4," Dr. Seaman's survey is of little value for purposes of determining the cause of the alleged price differential. First, Southern Card 
did not file the supporting information with Dr. Seaman's affidavit. Second, any price differential may be caused by the biased 
sample of local view postcard purchases from Orlando gift and souvenir shops, rather than from lower-cost retail outlets served 
by Southern Card. Third, Dr. Seaman fails to factor in differentials in the cost of living (or cost of a vacation) in the various parts 
of the state. "
692,5, The Court addresses this issue in greater detail supra. 
694,6," ""In every area in Florida outside of the greater Orlando area, local view cards occupy the vast majority of rack space in retail 
outlets and greatly outsell all other postcards."" Doc. 61 at 2."
694,7," Dr. Blair uses the analogy of the varying demand for Coca Cola and RC Cola in the cities of Los Angeles and Houston. Despite 
the wide differences in demand in the two separate cities, the two colas are in the same product market. "
695,8," HN16[
] Section 2 provides that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt Lo monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or person, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, 
shall be deemed guilty of a felony …."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 2 (West Supp. 1996)."
695,9," The Court also reviewed Dr. Seaman's supplemental affidavit filed on July 31, 1996 (Doc. 78) in opposition to Lawson Mardon's 
motion for summary judgment, and found no mention of an opinion as to the § 2 claims. "
700,1," The petition is stamped October 10, 1994 and has an entry date of October 12, 1994."
700,2," In two paragraphs the state alleges that the children who suffered damages are plaintiffs but they are not listed in the caption. 
Only the school systems are in the caption."
700,3," The Attorney General and Borden make reference to an amended petition which included a number of Catholic dioceses. The 
record does not contain an amended petition. "
701,4," The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Act of 1976 provides that any Attorney General of a state has the authority to sue parens 
patriae for treble damages for a Sherman Act violation.  15 U.S.C. § 15c."
701,5," Loew's Incorporated, Delaughter, and Diliberto use La. C.C. art. 3536, which was subsequently incorporated into La. C.C. 
3492. "
702,6," At issue in Delaughter, 364 F.2d at 624, was Borden's alleged offering and paying of rebates and discounts, violations of the 
Louisiana Orderly Milk Marketing Act, which declared that each day's violation constituted a separate offense. The U.S. Fifth 
Circuit adopted Louisiana's one year prescriptive period because the Louisiana Supreme Court utilized the one year period in 
Loew's Inc., 237 La. at 132, 110 So. 2d at 553, which was a private anti-monopoly action. The Fifth Circuit reversed the district 
court's decision that the action prescribed because prescription ran from the month that Delaughter knew of Borden's injurious 
activities, and the action was filed more than one year afterward, and allowed Delaughter's claims for injuries sustained within 
one year of the filing of suit. "
703,7," The petition is poorly drafted, but Borden did not complain about the drafting; it only filed a prescription exception. The petition 
erroneously declares that ""antitrust liability is established, leaving only damages to be proven at trial."" However, the petition, 
which includes a number of school systems not mentioned in the federal complaint, is not limited to the ending date in the 
federal judgment. "
709,1," As it has done in its previous motions for a temporary restraining order, Cyber continues to argue that unless a temporary 
restraining order is issued enjoining AOL from blocking Cyber's e-mail advertisements from reaching AOL's subscribers, AOL 
will go out of business. Despite the absence of any such orders, Cyber is not only still very much in business but, as the Roach 
affidavit discloses, has actually increased the amount of e-mail advertisements it sends to AOL servers to 1.9 million per day. In 
short, Cyber will not be irreparably harmed in the absence of the temporary restraining order it seeks. "
710,2," Numerous other commercial online services including CompuServe, Prodigy and the Microsoft Network compete with AOL for 
the growing number of potential online customers. Indeed, an article about AOL in the October 31, 1996 edition of the Wall 
Street Journal which Cyber has attached to its Motion for Injunctive Relief as part of Exhibit H states that ""AOL is besieged by 
competition."" As stated above, the parties have also stipulated that ""private companies compete with AOL in the online 
business."" In fact, in order to keep up with its competition, AOL only recently announced that it was offering its subscribers a flat 
rate of $ 19.95 per month for unlimited access to AOL's electronic services as well as the Internet. "
711,3," Thus, we find it ironic that Cyber states in its Reply Memorandum that ""the fact remains … that AOL is the only 'game in town'. 
Those who want to send commercial advertising material electronically to AOL's subscribers can either pay the freight or go 
elsewhere."" Reply Memorandum of Cyber in Support of Motion for Temporary Restraining Order at 7. Cyber, of course, has 
never even offered to ""pay the freight"" to advertise on AOL's system."

732,8," For example, after Domestic Securities Inc. broke the spread on Intel Corp. on a trading day in late summer 1994, defendant 
Weeden & Co. flashed a message of ""pathetic"" on the trading terminal of Domestic Securities Inc. and defendant Morgan 
Stanley & Co. called immediately and complained ""did you guys break the spread for 1,000 shares?"" Complaint P 108. Similarly, after Domestic Securities Inc. broke the spread for Chiron Corp. stock, Keith Balter, the head of over-the-counter 
trading for defendant Weeden & Co., immediately telephoned Domestic Securities Inc. and stated ""you're embarrassing and 
pathetic … you're breaking the spreads for everybody."" Id. On July 15, 1994, Domestic Securities Inc. broke the spread in Xilinx Corp. stock, and, in response, defendant Hambrecht & 
Quist called Domestic and stated ""This is bull    . I have institutional customers come to me and I have to meet your price. It's 
bull    , you guys going down 1/8 for 1,000 shares."" Id."

736,15," The Attorney General has acknowledged that retirement system funds are not ""public funds,"" but rather belong to the 
employee members of the systems, such that the State has no interest. Mr. Ieyoub admitted that the State has no interest in the 
monies owned by the Original and Late Filing Systems. Louisiana Attorney General Opinion No. 94-44. "

744,19," Where a class is certified under Rule 23(b)(3), notice must be provided individually to each class member who can be 
identified through reasonable efforts. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2). Notice under Rule 23(b)(2) is flexible, and may consist 
entirely of published notice in appropriate circumstances. Here, a Subclass will be certified consisting of Class members who, at the time of class notice, are current customers of 
Defendants and to whom Defendants send periodic mailings. As to this Subclass, the notice requirement of (b)(3) can be 
satisfied by an insert in Defendants' regular monthly mailing, at Plaintiffs' expense. See, e.g., Sollenbarger v. Mountain States 
Telephone & Telegraph Co., 121 F.R.D. 417, 437 (D.N.M. 1988) (telephone company required to enclose antitrust class notice 
in defendant's monthly billing envelopes); In re Domestic Air Transportation Antitrust Litigation, 141 F.R.D. 534, 549-52 (N.D. 
Ga. 1992) (rejecting defendants' objections to inclusion of notice in the defendants' inflight magazines). As the Supreme Court 
noted with approval in Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders, 437 U.S. 340, 355 n.11, 57 L. Ed. 2d 253, 98 S. Ct. 2380 (1978), ""a 
number of courts have required defendants in Rule 23(b)(3) class actions to enclose class notices in their periodic mailings to 
class members in order to reduce the expense of sending the notice."" (citing, inter alia, Ste. Marie v. Eastern R.R. Assn., 72 
F.R.D. 443, 450 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 1976), aff'd, 650 F.2d 395 (2d Cir. 1981); Gates v. Dalton, 67 F.R.D. 621, 633 (E.D.N.Y. 1975); 
Popkin v. Wheelabrator-Frye, Inc., 20 Fed. R. Serv. 2d (Callaghan) 125, 130 (S.D.N.Y. 1975)). Such ""piggyback notice"" will 
significantly reduce the cost of providing mailed notice under Rule 23(b)(3). "
750,20," Rule 23(c)(1) provides in relevant part that any order certifying a class ""may be altered or amended before the decision on the 
merits."" Rule 23(d) HN36[
] provides in relevant part that the Court may make ""appropriate orders"" dealing with ""procedural 
matters"", which may be altered or amended ""from time to time"", including orders ""determining the course of proceedings or 
prescribing measures to prevent undue repetition or complication in the presentation of evidence or argument"". Rule 23(d) 
provides that these orders ""may be combined with an order under Rule 16"". Rule 16(c) provides that ""the court may take 
appropriate action"" with respect to inter alia: ""the avoidance of unnecessary proof and of cumulative evidence""; ""the possibility of 
obtaining admissions of fact and of documents which will avoid unnecessary proof""; ""an order establishing a reasonable limit on 
the time allowed for presenting evidence""; ""an order for a separate trial pursuant to Rule 42(b) with respect to a claim … or with 
respect to any particular issue in the case""; or ""referring matters to a … master"". "
753,21," The court in the In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions envisioned that the determination and allocation of individual damages would 
occur in an administrative process, rather than in a second trial phase: Damages would be awarded on a class-wide basis, if and when liability was established, and individual claims could then 
be processed administratively after entry of judgment."
753,333," F. Supp. at 283. In a subsequent opinion, the Court followed up on its tentative decision that the class would be 
manageable by finding, on a more developed record, that the class in fact was manageable. In re Antibiotic Antitrust Actions, 
333 F. Supp. 291 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). "
757,22," See also In Re Corrugated Container, 80 F.R.D. at 253; Dennis, 1975-2 CCH Trade Cases P 60,396 at 66,749 (""It is the 
court's conclusion that at this point, the defendants' assertion that measuring the impact of the conspiracy and calculating 
individual damages will be an unmanageable task should not defeat plaintiff's motion. . . . However, when discovery is completed 
if it appears that, contrary to plaintiffs' assertion no general measure of damages can be proven and that any trial will involve 
separate analysis of the impact of the conspiracy on thousands of different styles of clothing, then the court, pursuant to the 
flexibility in Rule 23, will reconsider class certification.""). "
759,23," Defendants cite In re Air Passenger Computer Reservation Systems Antitrust Litigation, 116 F.R.D. 390, 393 (C.D. Cal. 1986), 
in support of their position that a witness might be able to avoid discoverability of his CID deposition testimony by simply refusing 
to request a copy of it. 116 F.R.D. at 393. The dictum upon which Defendants rely has been superseded by statute. See In re 
Woolworth Corp. Securities Class Action Litigation, 166 F.R.D. 311, 313 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (dictum in Air Passenger pre-dates the 
1991 Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and rejected by Woolworth court)."
759,24," To the extent Defendants have already provided, pursuant to the Pretrial Order, lists of employees deposed by the DOJ, 
Defendants will be required to update those lists. "
760,25," Moreover, HN53[
] pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1313(c)(3), the Government may not disclose materials obtained through CIDs without the target's consent. If Plaintiffs here were allowed to obtain all CID materials by forcing Defendants to invoke their 
general right to discovery of the DOJ's evidence against them, Defendants would be effectively denied the protection intended 
by § 1313(c)(3). "

767,1," The acronym SLAPP stands for ""strategic lawsuit against public participation."" SLAPPs can be described briefly as lawsuits 
lacking merit brought primarily for the purpose of chilling the defendant's exercise of the right to free speech and to petition the 
government for a redress of grievances. ( Wilcox v. Superior Court (1994) 27 Cal. App. 4th 809, 823.) For a detailed discussion 
of SLAPPs see Wilcox, supra, 27 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 815-817.) "
768,2, All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure until further notice.
768,3," Ordinarily, an appeal will not lie from an order striking the defendant's cross-complaint against the plaintiff. However, we 
elected to decide the issues raised by the granting of the SLAPP motion in order to avoid further delay which would prejudice 
respondents and would undermine the very purpose of the SLAPP statute, which is to permit rapid disposition of actions brought 
to chill the exercise of constitutional rights of free speech and petition. (See Wilcox, supra, 27 Cal. App. 4th at p. 823.) Peters' cross-complaint alleged causes of action in addition to defamation and restraint of trade, however he does not discuss 
these additional claims on appeal. Therefore he has waived any objections to the trial court's striking these causes of action. "
769,4," We postpone our consideration of the admissibility of the Burnett and Harris declarations until we reach the question whether 
Peters made a prima facie showing in support of his defamation cause of action. (See Part II below.) For purposes of the present 
discussion, the result is the same whether or not the Burnett and Harris declarations were properly admitted. "
770,5," As to Saunders' comparison of Peters' organization to the Mafia, an expression of opinion or an exercise in hyperbole is not 
defamatory. ( Fletcher v. San Jose Mercury News (1989) 216 Cal. App. 3d 172, 190-191, 264 Cal. Rptr. 699.) Clearly, the 
comparison of one organization to another expresses the opinion of the person making the comparison. ( Holy Spirit Ass'n. v. 
Harper & Row Publishers (N.Y.Sup.Ct. 1979) 101 Misc. 2d 30, 420 N.Y.S.2d 56, 59 [comparison of ""Moonies"" to Nazis an 
expression of opinion not actionable as defamation].) "
771,6," We are not suggesting the trial court should refrain from excluding inadmissible evidence on its own motion. A trial judge, after 
all, is not a bucket of rocks sitting behind the bench and the authority to exclude evidence on the court's own motion is well 
established. (3 Witkin, Cal. Evid. (3d ed. 1986) § 2032, p. 1994.) What we are suggesting is that trial courts should be cautious 
in exercising their authority to exclude evidence on their own motion when the proponent of the evidence does not have fair 
notice of the ground for exclusion. (See discussion below, pp. 15, 16.) "
773,7," The situation would be different if the Harris declaration had been admitted and Saunders was the appellant. Under those 
circumstances, notions of fairness and justice would have required him to confine his argument to the hearsay objection he 
specifically raised at trial. To allow the appellant to assert a new objection to the evidence on appeal would not only deprive his 
opponent of the opportunity to cure the defect it would allow a party knowing of a defect in the evidence to take his chance on a 
favorable verdict with the power and intent to annul it should it go against him. (1 Wigmore on Evidence (Tillers rev. 1983) § 18, 
p. 793.) "
774,8," Had the caller said, ""Hello, this is Mark Saunders,"" or words to that effect, an hearsay objection would lie if this statement was 
being offered to prove the caller was in fact Mark Saunders. However, no such statement was offered into evidence in this case. "
775,9, All future statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise noted. 
776,10," Ms. Devine-Hall states she had previously met Saunders. Therefore, the trier of fact could draw the inference she knew it was 
he on the telephone. (See discussion, supra, at p. 1831.) "
777,11," Federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act are applicable as an aid in interpreting California's antitrust statute. ( Marin County 
Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Palsson, (1976) 16 Cal. 3d 920, 925, 130 Cal. Rptr. 1, 549 P.2d 833.) "
778,12," To avoid confusion over terminology, it should be noted the Marin court used the term ""indirect boycott"" to refer to boycotts 
where the refusal to deal was only a byproduct of the agreement between the parties as compared to a ""direct boycott"" aimed at 
coercing parties to adopt noncompetitive practices.  (16 Cal. 3d at p. 932.) Thus, when the court in Marin referred to ""direct 
boycotts"" it was referring to the type of combination in which the defendant attempts to shut off the target competitor's source of 
material or labor which is generally referred to as an indirect or ""secondary"" boycott. "
779,13," Eastern Railroad Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc. (1961) 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523; United 
Mine Workers v. Pennington (1965) 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585; California Transport v. Trucking Unlimited 
(1972) 404 U.S. 508, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, 92 S. Ct. 609. "
780,14," Saunders argues the amendment to the statute did not take effect until January 1, 1993, and therefore it does not apply to his 
contact with Devine-Hall which occurred in 1992. As we have previously pointed out, however, the unfair competition statute is 
remedial in nature (see supra, p. 1842) and therefore the general rule a statute does not apply retroactively is not applicable 
here. ( Kuykendall v. State Bd. of Equalization (1994) 22 Cal. App. 4th 1194, 1211, fn. 20.) A statute which is remedial or 
procedural in nature ""may be given effect as to pending and future litigation even if the event underlying the cause of action 
occurred before the statute took effect."" ( Pacific Coast Medical Enterprises v. Department of Benefit Payments (1983) 140 Cal. 
App. 3d 197, 204, 189 Cal. Rptr. 558.)"

789,1," A more complete description of the background and proceedings in the companion Multidistrict Action is set forth in the Opinion 
in that action issued by the Court today."
789,2," At least two other investigations into the operation of the Nasdaq exchange have been commenced. On November 14, 1994, 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") announced that it would review the operation of NASDAQ, including the 
spreads issue alleged in the Consolidated Amended Complaint and broader issues concerning the structure of the market itself. 
On November 20, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers (""NASD"") announced the formation of a seven-member 
panel to undertake a plenary review of the effectiveness of its own operation and surveillance. "
791,3," Plaintiffs' discovery motion in the companion Multidistrict action is decided by a separate opinion issued by this Court today. On 
November 15, 1996, the Government filed its Response to Public Comments and moved for entry of the proposed Order. "
794,4," Plaintiffs also contend that intervention in this action is necessary to challenge the non-disclosure provision, because if they 
wait to challenge the provision in a separate proceeding, the Defendants will argue that they were precluded from litigating an 
issue that could have been litigated during the consent decree proceedings. It seems unlikely that Plaintiffs would actually be 
barred from challenging the provision in later proceedings. If Plaintiffs were not permitted to intervene as parties in this action, 
they would not be bound by traditional principles of collateral estoppel. HN9[
] Under the collateral estoppel doctrine, once a 
court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision is conclusive in a subsequent suit involving a 
party to the prior litigation.  United States v. Mendoza, 464 U.S. 154, 158, 78 L. Ed. 2d 379, 104 S. Ct. 568 (1984). Even so-
called ""non-mutual"" collateral estoppel can only be asserted against parties (or privies of parties) to the prior action. See id. at 
159 n.4 (describing offensive and defensive non-mutual collateral estoppel). While the Supreme Court has indicated that an 
individual's failure to intervene in a prior proceeding could preclude that individual from making offensive use of a prior 
advantageous judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 331, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552, 99 S. Ct. 645 (1979), there is no 
reason that such a non-party would be bound by an adverse determination in a case to which it was not a party. Further, it is not likely that Defendants could successfully argue in a later proceeding that Plaintiffs should be precluded from 
litigating the validity of the prospective non-disclosure provision of the decree because the Government represented Plaintiffs' 
interests in the prior action. In Sam Fox Publishing Co. v. United States, 366 U.S. 683, 689, 6 L. Ed. 2d 604, 81 S. Ct. 1309 
(1961), the Supreme Court denied a private parties' intervention in a government antitrust action on the grounds that ""HN10[
] 
a person whose private interests coincide with the public interest in government antitrust litigation is nonetheless not bound by 
the eventuality of such litigation."" Moreover, HN11[
] the entry of the consent decree is not an adjudication on the merits that 
can give rise to issue preclusion of the sort Plaintiffs fear. See IAM National Pension Fund v. Industrial Gear Mfg. Co., 232 U.S. 
App. D.C. 418, 723 F.2d 944, 949 & n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (consent decree no basis for issue preclusion because no judicial 
determination of questions of law or fact). "
797,5," This court ruled in the companion Multidistrict action that the CID materials (which are presumably referenced in the Settlement 
Memorandum) are not protected by a privilege that Defendants in that action may assert.  In re Nasdaq, 929 F. Supp. at 725-26. 
However, this does not mean that the Government can be compelled to disclose the materials in this action, since 15 U.S.C. § 
1313(c)(3) expressly prohibits the Government from disclosing such documents without permission from the targets.  Id. at 725."
797,6," This Court notes with some dismay the fact that the existence, and perhaps some of the allegedly confidential contents, of the 
Settlement Memorandum were apparently shared with members of the press. See, e.g., Scot J. Paltrow, ""Nasdaq Dealers Mull 
Next Move in Light of U.S. Probe Evidence,"" The Los Angeles Times, June 7, 1996, at B4 (Washington Edition). However, since 
it is not possible to identify the parties responsible for this disclosure, the parties cannot be held to have waived the 
confidentiality of the documents. "
798,7," Indeed, in an opinion issued today in the companion Multidistrict Action, this Court grants Plaintiffs' motion for discovery of the 
CID deposition transcripts in the control of the Multidistrict Defendants. "

816,4," It is unclear whether the Sixth Circuit would even recognize this independent personal stake exception. In Potters Medical 
Center v. City Hospital Ass'n., 800 F.2d 568, 573 (6th Cir. 1986), the court stated, ""Although several courts have recognized the 
'independent personal stake' exception to the rule that officers and agents lack capacity to conspire with their corporation, . . . 
this circuit has never endorsed the exception. In fact, this court has noted the 'rather substantial policy reasons for not adopting 
such an exception.'"" Id. (citations omitted). "
817,5," The parties agree that the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act is virtually identical to the Sherman Antitrust Act and has been

818,6," HN5[

833,7," The court notes the credentials and background of Dr. Frey and Dr. Reib are strikingly similar. Dr. Frey completed a family 
practice residency in 1983, while Dr. Reib completed a family practice residency in 1984. Following completion of their 
respective residency programs, Dr. Frey and Dr. Reib each spent three to four years in the Navy. Apparently, the two doctors 
were stationed together on Guam and became friends. Dr. Frey and Dr. Reib each entered a private family medicine practice 
after their respective stints in the Navy. "
835,8," 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) HN7[
] provides in pertinent part, ""any person who shall be injured … by reason of anything forbidden in the 
antitrust laws … shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."" "
837,9," The defendants appear to argue the testimony of Dr. Lindley is irrelevant because the defendants presented evidence from a 
number of doctors who testified the review panel's actions satisfied the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 11112(a). According to the 
defendants, ""a difference of opinion among experts"" does not raise an issue as to the objective reasonableness of the inquiry. 
We are not persuaded by the defendant's view. Under its theory, a peer review participant would be absolutely immune from 
liability for its actions so long as it produced a single expert to testify the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 11112(a) were satisfied. 
This would be in direct contravention to Congress' intention to provide ""qualified immunity."" Moreover, to remove a plaintiff's 
claims from the jury simply because ""a difference of opinion among experts"" exists would abrogate the jury's responsibility to 
weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses. See, e.g., Moe v. Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation, 727 
F.2d 917, 930 (10th Cir.) (""entire jury system is anchored to the jurors' determination of credibility of witnesses and the weight to 
be given their testimony""), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 853, 83 L. Ed. 2d 110, 105 S. Ct. 176 (1984). Thus, HN16[
] in determining 
whether a peer review participant is immune under the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, the proper inquiry for the court is 
whether Dr. Brown has provided sufficient evidence to permit a jury to find she has overcome, by a preponderance of the 
evidence, any of the four statutory elements required for immunity under 42 U.S.C. § 11112(a). See, e.g., Austin, 979 F.2d at 
734. In this case, we believe Dr. Brown presented sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption and allow the issue to be 
decided by the jury. "

the quote. "
853,8," Several members of Congress apparently took seriously the charge that Korea had paid inflated prices for U.S. rice: 111 
members of Congress signed a letter to the president of Korea, accusing the Korean government of ""improprieties in the 
purchase of U.S. rice."""
853,9," The sole defendants to go to trial were Connell Rice, Grover Connell, and Joseph Alioto. RGA and Errecarte were voluntarily 
dismissed with prejudice in 1986. FRC was apparently never served and was dismissed in 1986. "
854,10," Plaintiffs accused Alioto of masterminding and perpetrating the alleged monopolization conspiracy for over thirty years, and 
alleged Alioto had orchestrated defendants' alleged anticompetitive activities in 1981-82. Particular allegations were that Alioto 
attempted to obstruct Korean contracts with the independent mills by allegedly lying to Korean officials about the price of rice; 
falsely accusing independent mill PIRMI of bribery of Korean officials; knowingly serving illegal subpoenas on Korean diplomats 
to deter them from contracting with the independent rice mills; masterminding the alleged sham litigation and sham 
administrative proceedings aimed at obstructing the independent mills' efforts to sell rice to Korea; and concealing the nature of 
RGA's attempted purchase of the PIRMI mill in an attempt to evade U.S. Department of Justice antitrust review. "
855,11," The United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, filed suit under Sections 7 and 15 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 
18 and 25, seeking to enjoin RGA's acquisition of PIRMI assets. The district court entered judgment for the United States in 
1986, finding that the attempted acquisition would result in a market concentration that could ""substantially . . . lessen 
competition in the market for the purchase or acquisition for milling of paddy rice grown in California,"" and thus would violate

Act of 1976, 15 U.S.C. § 18(a)."" Id. at * 13."

the California Unfair Practices Act, Calif. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17045-17048 and 17200. Additionally, plaintiffs brought a claim 
suit under Section 7 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, alleging defendants' actions ""lessened competition or [] tended to create 
a monopoly in a line of commerce in a section of the country."""
855,13," Connell Rice's counterclaims allege plaintiffs and the independent rice mills conspired to monopolize the California rice market 
through commercial bribery, and engaged in abuse of process in bringing their antitrust claims. "
858,14," On two occasions below, the district court denied similar motions by defendants-appellees. First, in a pre-trial ruling in 
response to defendants' motion for summary judgment, which was based on plaintiffs' purported lack of standing and was 
therefore treated as a motion to dismiss, the district court held that plaintiffs had standing. Amarel v. Connell, 1986-2 Trade 
Cases Par. 67,233, 1986 WL 10613, * 2-3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 8, 1986). Second, in a post-trial order in response to defendants' 
motion for judgment as a matter of law, the trial judge summarily rejected defendants' contention that plaintiffs lacked standing. "
868,15," Under Federal Rule of Evidence 703, these exhibits were inadmissible ""as general proof of the truth of the underlying matter,"" 
Paddack, 745 F.2d at 1261 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Nonetheless, even had the district court not admitted 
Defense Exhibit 781A and Defense Exhibit 529A into evidence, defendants' expert could have discussed the information 
contained in Defense Exhibits 781A and 529A as a basis for criticizing plaintiffs' expert's analysis under Federal Rule of 
Evidence 703. Actually admitting the data into evidence was therefore not prejudicial. We disagree, moreover, with plaintiffs' 
contention that their expert was ""unable to respond"" to defendants' expert's testimony. This argument mischaracterizes the 
record. In fact, plaintiffs' expert did offer specific arguments to rebut defendants' expert's criticism of his models."
868,16," Plaintiffs characterize the district court's Noerr-Pennington rulings as a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule 
of Civil Procedure 50(a). Because it appears from the record that the district court ruled during trial that defendants failed to meet 
the legal standard necessary to invoke the ""sham"" litigation exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, we analyze the rulings 
under the standard of review for a directed verdict."
868,17," The district court made its ruling before the Supreme Court had issued its decision in Professional Real Estate Investors. We 
must apply that decision to this appeal, since a federal civil rule of law applies retroactively to appeals pending at the time the 
rule is announced.  Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509 U.S. 86, 113 S. Ct. 2510, 125 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1993). "
881,1," Plaintiffs contend that motions to dismiss antitrust claims should be more disfavored than motions to dismiss other types of 
claims. The court disagrees. Under present law, motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), 
including those directed at antitrust claims, are greatly disfavored by the federal courts. NL Indus., Inc. v. Gulf & Western Indus., 
650 F. Supp. 1115, 1122 (D. Kan. 1986). Enhancing the 12(b)(6) movant's already difficult burden would accomplish little more 
than transforming the dismissal into an impractical formality, and would virtually eliminate a procedural tool, which, when used 
cautiously, can promote the liberal rules of pleading and protect the interests of justice. "
883,2," For the remainder of this Memorandum and Order, the terms ""Classic"" and ""plaintiff"" denote Classic Cable, Inc. "
885,3," In dismissing Classic Cable's Sherman antitrust claim, the court assumed as true Classic's allegation that Rural and several of 
the Cities' council members ""were one and the same."" Therefore, no purpose would be served by permitting Classic Cable to 
conduct additional discovery concerning Rural's influence on the Cities' decisions. "
886,4," Unlike Plaintiff's original complaint, plaintiff's first amended complaint contains no allegations of equal protection violations. "
893,1," The Pac-10 includes: the University of Washington, Washington State University, University of Oregon, Oregon State 
University, University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, University of California, Los Angeles, University of Southern 
California, Arizona State University and the University of Arizona."
893,2," Because the penalty period imposed on UW has ended, the appellants' claims for injunctive relief are moot. "
894,3," Prior to filing this appeal, the players stipulated to the dismissal of the NCAA as a defendant. Thus, only the Pac-10 remains as 
a defendant-appellee. "
895,4," As the Supreme Court explained in NCAA, The NCAA seeks to market a particular brand of football - college football. The identification of this ""product"" with an 
academic tradition differentiates college football and makes it more popular than professional sports to which it might 
otherwise be comparable, such as, for example, minor league baseball. In order to preserve the character and quality of the 
""product,"" athletes must not be paid, must be required to attend classes, and the like. And the integrity of the ""product"" 
cannot be preserved except by mutual agreement; if an institution adopted such restrictions unilaterally, its effectiveness as 
a competitor on the playing field might soon be destroyed. Thus, the NCAA plays a vital role in enabling college football to 
preserve its character, and as a result enables a product to be marketed which might otherwise be unavailable. In 
performing this role, its actions widen consumer choice - not only the choices available to sports fans but also those 
available to athletes - and hence can be viewed as procompetitive. NCAA, 468 U.S. at 101-02. "
897,1," In Thermogenics, 890 F.2d at 146, we also looked at ""the nature of the plaintiff's claimed injury."" However, this factor is more 
properly considered when performing the ""antitrust injury"" analysis. "
905,1," The doctors are Dr. Neufeld of Columbus, Ohio and Dr. Brown of Minneapolis, Minnesota."
905,2," The competitors are (1) Value Drug, Ltd., a Hawaii corporation; (2) Creative Health Care Services, an Arizona corporation; and 
(3) Home Parenteral Care, Inc., an Oregon corporation. "
906,3," If the class is ultimately not certified, therefore, this order, or portions thereof, may no longer be applicable. The Court is mindful 
that pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) the issue of class certification must be ruled on ""as soon as practicable."" See e.g. 
Wright, 742 F.2d at 543."
906,4," Defendants did not specifically challenge Plaintiffs' § 1962(d) claims which alleged that Defendants conspired to violate § 
1962(c) and § 1962 (a). See Plaintiffs' Complaint at P 48, 55. The Court, therefore, will not address Plaintiffs' 1962(d) claims."
906,5, Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs' failed to establish this element. 
907,6," The Court will not address Plaintiffs' state law bribery claims because it finds that the complaint does not allege them. See 
Plaintiffs' Complaint P 47 (""defendants have engaged in . . . (a) bribery, or attempted bribery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 201."") If 
the Paintiffs want to allege state law bribery, they can amend their complaint. "
908,7, Defendants would provide the therapy to the employee in exchange for payment from the federal government.
908,8," This analysis, however, applies only to scenarios involving federal insurance programs."
908,9," Exhibits submitted with the complaint may be considered as part of the complaint for purposes of a motion to dismiss without 
converting it into a summary judgment motion. See Hal Roach Studios v. Richard Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1555 (9th Cir. 
1990). However, other evidence submitted by the parties such as newspaper articles would convert this motion into one for 
summary judgment. For that reason, this Court has decided to exercise its discretion and disregard that evidence so as not to 
transform this motion into one for summary judgment. See e.g. Skyberg v. United Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union, 5 
F.3d 297, 302 fn.2 (5th Cir. 1993)."
908,10," Because the analysis for these counts is identical, the Court will address them together. See Dischner, 974 F.2d at 1518 n. 16."
908,11," Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs misconstrue the plea agreements is misplaced. The Court reminds the Defendants that at 
this juncture, the Court must accept as true the Plaintiffs' allegations contained in the complaint and view them in a light most 
favorable to the Plaintiffs. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S. Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1974). Therefore, "
909,," absent the pleas, the Court still has to accept as true Plaintiffs' allegations concerning a national scheme to defraud. But see 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b); footnote 17, infra."
909,12," The Court reads ""market share"" and the ""right to a level playing field"" to only have semantic differences. After all, in Lancaster, 
the behavior Plaintiffs accused Defendant of -- engaging in kickbacks to gain customers -- certainly deprived the Plaintiff of the 
""right to a level playing field,"" but the Ninth Circuit instead addressed it as ""market share."" 940 F.2d at 405."
909,13," The Court is also unpersuaded by the fact that the acts alleged constituted a pattern because whether they were a pattern or 
not, Congress ""cannot criminalize conduct that has already occurred, U.S. Const., Art. I § 9 cl. 3, and mail [and wire] fraud is a 
criminal offense."" Lancaster, 940 F.2d at 405; but see United States v. Paradies, 98 F.3d 1266, 1284 (11th Cir. 1996) (upholding 
conviction under § 1346 when scheme spanned from 1985 to 1990); United States v. Garfinkel, 29 F.3d 1253, 1259-60 (8th Cir. 
1994); United States v. Hammen, 977 F.2d 379, 385 (7th Cir. 1992). "
910,14," Clearly, neither of the rights asserted -- a level playing field or the doctors' fiduciary duty -- concern tangible property. 
Accordingly, they will be analyzed under the ""intangible property"" portion of the mail fraud statute."
910,15," Plaintiffs try to portray In re American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 1996 W.L. 534796, as support for a ""market share"" theory 
although the Court did not rely on such a theory. Instead, the Court relied on the Plaintiffs' ""contractual rights"" to cars. Id. at 13-
14 fn. 21. Here, however, Plaintiffs try to assert a property right over the patients absent any contract."
910,16," The Court recognizes the irony in holding that a nationwide class of Plaintiffs have failed to establish their mail fraud claims 
when the Defendants have pled guilty to two counts of mail fraud. The pleas however concern the taking of tangible property, i.e. 
money, from the government. See e.g. Plaintiffs Complaint, Minnesota Plea Agreement Joint Stipulation of Facts (""Defendant did 
knowingly devise and intend to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud the FEHBP and CHAMPUS programs and to obtain 
money and property by false and fraudulent premises . . . ."") "
911,17," Any effort by Plaintiffs to amend their complaint should bear in mind that Fed. R. Civ. P. § 9(b) requires that mail and wire 
fraud RICO claims be pleaded ""with particularity [as to] the time, place and manner of each act of fraud, plus the role of each 
defendant in each scheme."" Lancaster Community Hospital v. Antelope Valley Hosp. D., 940 F.2d 397, 405 (9th Cir. 1991). Only 
two mailings, however, need be established with particularity. Id. The present Complaint has clearly established the two mailings with regard to the mail fraud action. In the Ohio and Minnesota 
Pleas, Caremark admits to using the mails twice at a certain time, place and manner in violation of the mail fraud statute. See 
Plaintiff's Complaint, Exhibits B and D. The agreements, however, do not refer to Caremark's commission of wire fraud. 
Consequently, the Complaint does not plead the wire fraud claim with the requisite particularity. Perhaps, this case could justify 
a relaxation of the standard but at this time such a determination would be premature. Wool v. Tandem Computers, Inc., 818 
F.2d 1433, 1439 (9th Cir. 1987) (relaxing the 9(b) particularity requirement concerning ""matters peculiarly within the opposing 
party's knowledge . . . [because] in cases of corporate fraud, the plaintiffs cannot be expected to have personal knowledge of 
the facts constituting the wrongdoing."") Id."
911,18," Finally, in their 120 pages of papers filed in support of this motion, the Defendants do not contest the fact that if the Plaintiffs 
established the existence of predicate acts, the requirement for a pattern would not also be fulfilled. "
912,19," Defendants' other case, Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro v. Lerner, 31 F.3d 924 (9th Cir. 1994), also involved a two-tiered or ""pass 
on"" scenario. In Pillsbury, the plaintiffs, a law firm, sued various entities over a raise in their rent which they alleged was due to a 
money laundering and mail fraud scheme involving the likes of Michael Milken. Id. The Court found that the law firm lacked 
standing because it was a subtenant of the building. Id. Its rent increase, therefore, depended on the tenant ""passing on"" its rent 
increase to the plaintiffs. Id. at 928-9. Thus, Pillsbury is not applicable to this case, which only involves a one-tiered injury."
912,20," Moreover, in discussing the need for establishing proximate cause in a Civil RICO action, the Supreme Court relied on 
causation principles enunciated in antitrust cases. Holmes, 503 U.S. 258, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532, 112 S. Ct. 1311; see also Mid A. 
Telecom v. Long Distance Services, 18 F.3d at 263; but see Israel Travel Advisory Service v. Israel Iden. Tours, 61 F.3d 1250, 
1257. Under causation principles of antitrust law, Plaintiffs have standing. See Discussion, supra pg. 29. "
914,21," This enterprise fulfills another requirement that the defendant must be different than the enterprise. The Ninth Circuit clearly 
allows some defendants to also be members of the alleged association-in-fact enterprise. River City Markets v. Fleming Foods 
West, 960 F.2d 1458, 1461 (9th Cir. 1992) (""in multiple-defendant RICO cases, some of the individual defendants may also be 
identified as members of the alleged association-in-fact enterprise). "
916,22," Defendants reliance on Harris v. Duty Free Shoppers Limited Partnership, 940 F.2d 1272 (1991) to establish the contrary is 
misplaced. In Harris, the ""intermediary"" between the buyer and the seller -- the tour bus -- did not have any particular expertise 
that would convince the tourists that they should buy from the Defendant. Id. at 1275 (relying on the fact that ""the tour guides 
were not shopping 'experts'""). Here, however, the doctors are clearly experts of the goods they sold. Moreover, the Harris court also relied on the fact that ""the tourists are free to purchase their souvenirs and gift items anywhere; 
in fact, they are free not to purchase at all."" Id. That is not the case here. Patients with such diseases as AIDS and cancer that 
require alternate site infusion therapies are not ""free not to purchase,"" nor can they purchase anywhere if they are not informed 
of other providers. Unlike a duty-free store, one does not just come across an alternative site infusion therapy store. For these 
reasons, the Court finds Harris inapposite."
916,23," HN14[
] 2(c) in its entirety states: (c) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to pay or grant, or to receive 
or accept, anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in lieu 
thereof, except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, merchandise, either to the 
other party to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is 
acting in fact for or in behalf, or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the 
person by whom such compensation is so granted or paid."
916,15, U.S.C. § 13(c) (emphasis added).
916,24," At the hearing for this motion, Plaintiffs seemed to concede that the doctors performed some services in exchange for 
Defendants' payments. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs allege that the payments were far above fair market value for the services 
performed. The latter allegation alone would seem to make the ""services rendered"" exception as defined by the Ninth Circuit 
inapplicable: ""a price allowance or discount to compensate for the reasonable value of such services would come within the 
exception of section 2(c) and would not be unlawful."" Federal Trade Commission v. Washington Fish & Oyster Co., 282 F.2d 
595, 599 (9th Cir. 1960)."
916,25," The Court notes that Defendants do not claim that Plaintiffs have not stated a substantive claim under the statute. Instead, 
they argue standing, lack of necessity, and constitutional infirmities. The Court concurs in Defendants' decision finding that 
bribery, mail fraud and antitrust violations, if true, would constitute an unfair business practice. See People v. McKale, 25 Cal. 3d 
626, 602 P.2d 731 (1979) (holding that statute applies to wrongful business conduct in whatever context.) "
917,26," HN16[
] Cal Bus & Prof Code § 17203 states as follows Any person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition may be enjoined in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. The court may make such orders or judgments, including the appointment of a receiver, as may be 
necessary to prevent the use or employment by any person of any practice which constitutes unfair competition, as defined 
in this chapter, or as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any money or property, real or personal, which 
may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition."
917,27," Even if Plaintiff did pursue the argument, clearly the Defendants withdrawal from the business obviates the need for an 
injunction. See Donald v. Cafe Royale, Inc., 218 Cal. App. 3d 168, 184, 266 Cal. Rptr. 804 (finding that injunction unnecessary 
when Defendants no longer in business)."
917,28," The Court does not interpret Plaintiffs' claim under this provision as one for damages, but rather for disgorgement of 
Defendants' profits. See People v. Powers, 2 Cal. App. 4th 330, 340 (1992) (""although there are few cases which have 
examined the remedies sanctioned by section 17203, there is little question but that the broad range of remedies provided for 
therein includes restitution and/or disgorgement of profits."") "

regardless of ownership or affiliations, not more than one of the newspaper publications involved in the performance of such 
arrangement was likely to remain or become a financially sound publication: Provided, That the terms of a renewal or

a newspaper publication or newspaper publications to such arrangement. (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to enter into, perform, or enforce a joint operating arrangement, not already in effect, 
except with the prior written consent of the Attorney General of the United States. Prior to granting such approval, the Attorney 
General shall determine that not more than one of the newspaper publications involved in the arrangement is a publication other 
than a failing newspaper, and that approval of such arrangement would effectuate the policy and purpose of this chapter. (c) Nothing contained in the chapter shall be construed to exempt from any antitrust law any predatory pricing, any predatory 
practice, or any other conduct in the otherwise lawful operations of a joint newspaper operating arrangement which would be 
unlawful under any antitrust law if engaged in by a single entity. Except as provided in this chapter, no joint newspaper 
operating arrangement or any party thereto shall be exempt from any antitrust law. § 1804. Reinstatement of joint operating arrangements previously adjudged unlawful under antitrust laws "

958,3," The Ordinance states, in part: "
959,," An Ordinance consenting to exchange of certain property within the City between [PGE] and [PP&L] on certain conditions in 
order to permit reduction of poles and wires and duplication of facilities in various areas of the City. The City of Portland ordains: Section 1. The Council finds that both [PGE] and [PP&L] operate electric power systems which serve patrons within the 
City, that both companies operate under non-exclusive franchises and that the obligation to supply properties within the City 
must remain binding upon both companies; that at the present time, however, in many areas of the City poles and wires are 
duplicated between the companies for service purposes . . . . ; that to reduce the visual impact of duplicating facilities, to 
promote safety, to promote economy, to simplify subsequent undergrounding and to work toward the lowest possible rates 
for users within the City, an interchange of properties between the companies should be permitted as hereinafter set forth; .

[PGE] and [PP&L] as follows . . . . Portland, Or., Ordinance 134416 (Apr. 26, 1972) (emphasis added). "

so that the revenues from the sales of electricity of each company will remain substantially the same over the period 
required to accomplish transfer of all customers involved. . . . There is no reference to customer accounts in Section 1 of the 1972 Agreement, which provides for the exchange of facilities. In 
referring to the transfer of customers, Section 7 does not use the ""shall transfer and convey"" language used in Section 1. Thus 
the language and structure of the 1972 Agreement, as well as the language of the 1972 Order quoted in the text, suggest that 
the transfer of customers was treated as a necessary incident to the exchange of facilities. For a further discussion of the 
transfer of customers, see infra pp. 17-19."

commission approving an application for the allocation of territory""). Or. Rev. Stat. § 758.400(1). Section 758.410(1) permits

only applies if the state actively supervises the challenged anticompetitive conduct). Resp. of Portland General Elec. Co. to 
Appellant's Pet. for Reh'g and Amicus Brief of United States, at 18. In making this argument, PGE relies on Praxair, Inc. v. 
Florida Power & Light Co., 64 F.3d 609, 612 (11th Cir. 1995) HN7[
] (""If [the defendant engaged in anticompetitive conduct] 
presumably because of a territorial agreement, but the area in question was never approved by the Commission, the 
[defendant's] action would not merit state action immunity because of the lack of 'active state supervision.'"") (quoting FTC v. 
Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 636, 119 L. Ed. 2d 410, 112 S. Ct. 2169 (1992)), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 1678, 134 L. Ed. 2d 
781 (1996). "
963,," Praxair does not help PGE. As the Court explained in Ticor, the case on which Praxair relies, HN8[
] ""Midcal's two elements . . 
. [are both] directed at ensuring that particular anticompetitive mechanisms operate because of a deliberate and intended state 
policy."" Ticor, 504 U.S. at 636. Praxair is nothing more than a fact specific application of the Midcal test. The anticompetitive 
conduct had been authorized by a Florida Public Service Commission order approving an allocation of service territories, and the 
Eleventh Circuit merely held that the order was intended to include a particular county in the exclusive service territories created. 
See Praxair, 64 F.3d at 613. Since the Oregon statute speaks solely of authorizing the OPUC to approve exclusive service 
territories, the state's clearly articulated policy is to have the OPUC decide whether to sanction anticompetitive conduct. It 
follows, therefore, that we must look to the decisions of the OPUC to determine whether PGE's conduct was part of a clearly 
articulated state policy. Cf.  Ticor, 504 U.S. at 636-37 (first prong of Midcal test intended to ensure state has not acted through 
inadvertence)."
963,9," Section 758.460 provides in relevant part: HN9[
] (1) The rights acquired by an allocation of territory may only be assigned or transferred with the approval of the 
commission after a finding that such assignment or transfer is not contrary to the public interest. Or. Rev. Stat. § 758.460."
963,10," In particular, there is no reference in the 1972 Order to Or. Rev. Stat. § 758.410, HN10[
] which permits utilities to contract with each other ""for the purpose of allocating territories and customers between the parties."" Nor is there any reference to § 
758.425, which gives the OPUC its authority to approve such contracts, even though an exclusive service territory can be 
established only HN11[
] ""by a contract between persons furnishing a similar utility service and approved by the commission or . . . by an order of the commission approving an application for the allocation of territory."" Or. Rev. Stat. § 758.400(1) (defining 
""allocated territory""). "
964,11," Columbia Steel argues that PGE and PP&L intentionally introduced ambiguity into the 1972 Agreement in order to slip a 
monopolistic agreement past the city of Portland. We need not address this argument because, whether or not ambiguity was 
introduced into the contract for the self-serving purpose of making it less politically vulnerable, the utilities' failure to include the 
""exclusively served"" language in the 1972 Agreement that had been included in the plan submitted to the City Council certainly 
had the effect of creating ambiguity in the 1972 Order. "
965,12," PGE also cites Pub. Util. Comm'n of Or., Orders 73-688 (Oct. 25, 1973), 75-704 (Aug. 13, 1975), and 79-055 (Jan. 12, 1979)."
965,13," As Columbia Steel puts it, ""whether, as a matter of fact, the utilities competed is an entirely different inquiry from whether, as a 
matter of law, the utilities secured lawful allocations of exclusive service territory."" Columbia Steel Reply Brief at 11. "
966,14," The 1992 Order states, in relevant part: Because [the 1972 Order] did not expressly refer to ORS Chapter 758 with respect to future service in Portland under the 
allocation statutes and because the order did not say that exclusive territorial allocations are being created in Portland, . . . 
perhaps it did not unambiguously allocate exclusive service territories to PGE and PP&L. However, the order did create 
boundaries that the utilities observed as if they were allocated territories until Columbia Steel's attempt to switch utilities in 
1989. The Commission made the required statutory findings to allocate exclusive service territories and acted as if it had 
approved a territorial allocation in its 1972 order. The behavior of the utilities and the Commission demonstrates an 
understanding that exclusive service territories had been created. For the foregoing reasons, it appears to the Commission that [the 1972 Order] is not a complete and accurate memorial of 
the 1972 decision of the Commissioner . . . : the order omits a reference to the statute under which its findings were actually 
made when the Commissioner approve the PGE/PP&L contract. Pursuant to ORS 756.568, the Commission will amend 
[the 1972 Order], nunc pro tunc, to conform to the actual decision intended and followed."
966,1992, Order at 14-15. 
967,15," HN16[
] Oregon law provides that one tribunal may give preclusive effect to the prior determination of an issue by another 
tribunal only if ""the issue in the two proceedings is identical."" Hickey v. Settlemier, 318 Ore. 196, 864 P.2d 372, 375 (Or. 1993). HN17[
] Oregon law also provides that the second tribunal may give preclusive effect to an earlier decision only if ""the party 
sought to be precluded has had a full and fair opportunity to be heard on that issue."" Id. Columbia Steel argues that it was not 
given such an opportunity before the OPUC issued the 1992 Order. Columbia Steel denies having waived its right to a hearing 
on the merits, pointing to record evidence that it only agreed to postpone the submission of evidence to the OPUC until the 
OPUC ruled on Columbia Steel's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. We need not decide whether Columbia Steel was 
denied a fair opportunity to be heard in the proceeding before the OPUC because, as we explain in the text, the issue in that 
procedure is not ""identical"" to the issue of state-action immunity in this federal antitrust action. Id."
967,16," For the same reason, there can be no issue preclusion based on the judgment of the Marion County Court affirming the 1992 
Order on the ground that the it was ""supported by substantial evidence."" See Columbia Steel Casting Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n 
of Or., Marion County Circuit Court No. 92C-12005, Judgment affirming Public Utility Commission of Oregon Order Nos. 92-557 
& 92-1135, at 2, aff'd without opinion, Oregon Ct. of Appeals (Dec. 15, 1993)."
967,17," HN19[
] It is fundamental that an order or judgment is not entitled to full faith and credit if the issuing tribunal had no subject 
matter jurisdiction over the matter before it.  Underwriters Nat'l Assurance Co. v. North Carolina Life & Accident & Health Ins. 
Guar. Ass'n, 455 U.S. 691, 704-05, 71 L. Ed. 2d 558, 102 S. Ct. 1357 (1982). We do not know whether the OPUC and the 
Marion County Court had subject matter jurisdiction as a matter of state law to amend the 1972 Order retroactively. We believe, 
however, that it is questionable whether either had subject matter jurisdiction to decide the federal antitrust question of state-
action immunity that is now before us. We need not decide this jurisdictional question because the lack of identity between the 
issue decided in the 1992 Order and the issue of state-action immunity deprives the 1992 Order of any preclusive effect in this 
federal antitrust action."
967,18," PGE's reliance on California Aviation, Inc. v. City of Santa Monica, 806 F.2d 905 (9th Cir. 1986), and the cases on which it 
relies, for the proposition that Midcal can be satisfied retroactively is misplaced. In California Aviation, the later statute 
""articulated and affirmed a pre-existing state policy of allowing [particular anticompetitive conduct]."" Id. at 909 (emphasis added). "
968,," In contrast, there was no pre-existing state policy to eliminate competition in the Portland market for the OPUC to articulate or 
affirm in its 1992 Order. "
970,19," Columbia Steel also argues that the refusal in 1987 of PGE's coconspirator PP&L to service the steel casting plant over the 
objection of PGE was also an overt act that restarted the statute of limitations. We need not consider the significance of the 
events in 1987 to the statute of limitations question because we hold that the statutory period was restarted in 1990. The 1987 
events are, however, relevant to Columbia Steel's cross-appeal regarding damages, which we address in Part V, infra. "
994,1," Pakzad characterizes these publications not as advertisements, but as ""salutes"" to people with style. Nevertheless, the fact 
remains that the publications -- whether meant to advertise or to honor -- announce the identities of certain Bijan customers."
994,2," Katzman worked to form Harrison James during his tenure with Bijan -- but on his personal time. There is no evidence, 
however, to suggest that Katzman was working to undermine or to compete with Bijan while he was its employee. "
995,3," Pakzad admits that he told vendors that he would not do business with them should they sell to Katzman, but denies 
threatening them to cut off all ties with his former employee."
995,4," Originally, plaintiff also accused Katzman of approaching several manufacturers and attempting to persuade them to sell to 
Harrison James goods that they had agreed to sell exclusively to Bijan. However, while it still asserts the veracity of this 
allegation, plaintiff has withdrawn the claim pending further discovery. "
996,5," Bijan also moves to enjoin Katzman from soliciting individuals who were employed by Bijan during the term of Katzman's tenure 
to terminate their employ with Bijan. However, it fails to show how the Agreement or any other legal theory would support the 
issuance of such relief. Moreover, Bijan flounders in its attempt to show that Katzman has raided Bijan and solicited its 
employees to work for him. Indeed, of the two former Bijan employees working for Harrison James, one worked for Bijan years 
ago, while the other testified unequivocally that she approached Katzman for a job. Accordingly, Bijan's plea to obtain an 
injunction preventing Katzman from hiring Bijan employees is denied."
996,6," Additionally, HN3[
] a court may enforce restrictive covenants between employer and employee if (1) it is reasonable 
temporally and geographically and (2) the employee's services are unique or extraordinary.  Columbia Ribbon & Carbon Mfg. 
Co., Inc., 398 N.Y.S.2d at 1006-07 (1977). However, as there is no allegation that Katzman possesses such unique or 
extraordinary abilities, the Court will not address this issue. "
997,7," Katzman does not argue that the covenant is overbroad in geographic scope, and thus the Court will not treat the issue at this 
time."
997,8," The Court notes that even HN5[
] if it found the five-year term unreasonable, it could ""blue pencil"" the covenant to reduce the 
term to a reasonable time frame. See South Nassau Control. Corp. v. Innovative Control Mgmt. Corp., 95 Civ. 3724, at *5, 1996 
WL 496610 (E.D.N.Y. June 10, 1996); Webcraft Techs, Inc. v. McCaw, 674 F. Supp. 1039, 1047 (S.D.N.Y. 1987); Karpinski v. 
Ingrasci, 28 N.Y.2d 45, 320 N.Y.S.2d 1, 6-7, 268 N.E.2d 751 (Ct. App. 1971). "
998,9," Bijan's motion seeks to enjoin Katzman from engaging in any contact with Bijan's customers. This relief, if granted, would 
prevent Katzman from doing business with these customers even if they sought his services without solicitation on his part. 
Indeed, it would require Katzman to actively avoid such customers. Such HN8[
] an injunction would operate in a harsh and 
oppressive manner, and thus would be void as against public policy. See American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., 438 N.Y.S.2d 
at 486; Mohawk Maintenance Co. v. Kessler, 74 A.D.2d 511, 424 N.Y.S.2d 907 (App. Div. 1980), aff'd, 52 N.Y.2d 276, 437 
N.Y.S.2d 646, 419 N.E.2d 324 (Ct. App. 1981). Additionally, the Court notes that a restrictive covenant seeking to prevent an 
employee from contacting friends or associates, i.e. utilizing ""normal friendships and business contacts"", is overbroad. See 
Great Lakes Carbon Corp. v. Koch Industries, Inc., 497 F. Supp. 462, 471 (S.D.N.Y. 1980); Arnold K. Davis & Co., Inc. v. 
Ludemann, 160 A.D.2d 614, 559 N.Y.S.2d 240, 242 (App. Div. 1990) (holding that it would be inequitable to enjoin employee 
from calling upon his ""experience, knowledge, [and] friendships…."") "
1000,10," HN17[
] New York State's antitrust act, the Donnelly Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340 (McKinney 1988), was modeled on the Sherman Act, see State v. Mobil Oil Corp., 38 N.Y.2d 460, 381 N.Y.S.2d 426, 344 N.E.2d 357 (1976), and generally is construed 
in accordance with that act, Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Abrams, 71 N.Y.2d 327, 525 N.Y.S.2d 816, 820, 520 N.E.2d 535 (1988). 
Since Katzman identifies no state policy or difference in the statutory language that would justify construing the Donnelly Act 
differently from the Sherman Act in this case, his motion under New York antitrust law fails for the same reasons it does under 
federal antitrust law. "

General Foods, Inc., because judicial notice of the content of court records is appropriate only when the existence of the record 
itself precludes contravention or where collateral estoppel or res judicata applies. (See Columbia Casualty Co. v. Northwestern 
Nat. Ins. Co. (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 457, 473; Sosinsky v. Grant (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1569.) Appellants wish to rely on 
the decision for their purposes but preclude respondents from doing so. Because all parties failed to obtain rulings on their 
evidentiary objections, the objections are waived and not preserved for appeal. (Ann M. v. Pacific Plaza Shopping Center (1993) 
6 Cal.4th 666, 670, fn. 1.) ""Although many of the objections appear meritorious, for purposes of this appeal we must view the 
objectionable evidence as having been admitted in evidence and therefore as part of the record."" (Ibid.) In any case, even if the 
""facts"" or findings in State v. Kraft General Foods, Inc., are not subject to judicial notice, we look to them to ascertain whether 
appellants'  [*18] reliance upon that opinion to support their causes of action is well founded. "

immunity; Westmac, Inc. v. Smith, 797 F.2d 313, 318 (6th Cir. 1986); that immunity should be denied, even in the pursuit of valid

Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 694 F.2d 466, 472 (7th Cir. 1982); and that ""success on the merits does not . . . preclude"" proof

1022,4," Recently, this rule of construction was explicitly incorporated into the Connecticut Antitrust Act by the passage of Public Acts

interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."" "
1024,5," At least one of the defendants has argued that the plaintiff could not have been delayed, hindered or prevented from entering 
the airport valet parking business by the bringing and maintaining of the subject administrative appeal because the pendency of 
that appeal did not operate to stay the ZBA's approval of the plaintiff's building permit, or thus to prevent the construction and 
opening for business of the planned valet parking facility. Because this argument requires proof of facts outside the allegations

1033,2," While PSI argues on appeal that Honeywell's tying arrangement is illegal under both per se and rule-of-reason analysis, these 
two theories have, in effect, merged in recent years. Under traditional per se analysis, restraints of trade were condemned 
without any inquiry into the market power possessed by the defendant. See, e.g., Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 
U.S. 1, 5, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545, 78 S. Ct. 514 (1958). However, under tying's per se rule, the seller must possess substantial market 
power in the tying product market. In addition, tying's per se rule provides for an inquiry into whether the defendant's conduct 
has procompetitive effects. See Kodak, 504 U.S. at 478-79. Such an extensive factual inquiry is hardly the stuff of per se 
analysis. Under rule-of-reason analysis, the antitrust plaintiff must show, inter alia, an adverse effect on competition. See 
Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 29-30, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984). This circuit adopted the 
HN6[
] following three-step analysis for determining whether a tying arrangement is likely to cause such an anticompetitive 
effect: ""(1) the seller must have power in the tying product market; (2) there must be a substantial threat that the tying seller will 
acquire market power in the tied-product market; and (3) there must be a coherent economic basis for treating the tying and tied 
products as distinct."" Hand v. Central Transp., Inc., 779 F.2d 8, 11 (6th Cir. 1985). Thus, in this circuit, market power in the tying 
product market is an indispensable requirement under either per se or rule-of-reason analysis. As Professors Areeda, Elhauge, "
1034,," and Hovenkamp comment, ""the per se rule against tying is 'per se' in only one respect--namely, dispensing with proof of 
anticompetitive effects . . . ."" 10 PHILLIP E. AREEDA ET AL., ANTITRUST LAW P 1760e, at 372 (1996). The merger of these 
two theories is apparent in the majority opinion in Kodak, which does not even mention the terms ""per se"" or ""rule of reason,"" 
even though Kodak was technically a per se case. "
1036,3," Honeywell's reasons for attempting to constrain PSI to a relevant market consisting of all components on Honeywell boards are 
obvious, since ninety-five percent of the components on its boards are widely available in the market. Nevertheless, it is 
questionable whether such a market definition would benefit Honeywell. Even though market power is normally established by 
controlling a substantial share of the market, market power also exists ""when the seller offers a unique product that competitors 
are not able to offer."" See Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 17. In this case, Honeywell itself describes its own board components as 
""proprietary,"" and there is substantial evidence that competitors are unable to offer these components."
1036,4," In Kodak the Court found that the ISOs had conceded that Kodak lacked market power in the equipment market.  Kodak, 504 
U.S. at 465 n.10. "
1049,1," The franchisees pay Exxon the ""Dealer Tank Wagon"" (DTW) price for a supply of gasoline delivered to their stations. The 
jobbers, independent distributors who buy and transport Exxon gasoline from the refinery, pay a generally lower ""rack"" price."
1049,2," According to Exxon, independent service station operators, served by the jobbers, are located in rural areas, whereas the 
franchisees are located in metropolitan areas. "
1050,3," In addition, numerous other cases in the state raise the same or similar issues. (See also Ajir v. Exxon Corp. (N.D.Cal. No. C-
93 20830 RMW PVT) [summary judgment granted on same issues].) "
1051,4," State courts have liberally applied federal Sherman Act doctrine in interpreting the Cartwright Act. (See, e.g., Roth v. Rhodes 
(1994) 25 Cal. App. 4th 530, 542 [30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 706]; Cellular Plus, Inc. v. Superior Court (1993) 14 Cal. App. 4th 1224, 1242 
[18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 308]; Bert G. Gianelli Distributing Co. v. Beck & Co. (1985) 172 Cal. App. 3d 1020, 1042 [219 Cal. Rptr. 203] 
(Gianelli).) However, in their final brief, plaintiffs insist the Cartwright Act is much broader than the Sherman Act, and thus they should not 
be bound by cases interpreting the Sherman Act, especially concerning vertical restraints and market definition. (See State of 
California ex rel. Van de Kamp v. Texaco, Inc. (1988) 46 Cal. 3d 1147, 1160-1164, 1168 [252 Cal. Rptr. 221, 762 P.2d 385] 
[Cartwright Act modeled after earlier Texas and Michigan acts, but not broader than Sherman Act].) They cite, for example, 
Texaco, Inc. v. Hasbrouck (1990) 496 U.S. 543 [110 L. Ed. 2d 492, 110 S. Ct. 2535], wherein the Supreme Court held that 
discounts to wholesale buyers who also resold gasoline at retail were illegal price discrimination because Texaco failed to prove 
the discounts were functionally related. But Hasbrouck was a price discrimination case brought under the Robinson-Patman Act, 
and here plaintiffs have made no Robinson-Patman (or similar California Unfair Practices Act) allegations in their complaint. "
1052,5," ""A leading commentator on vertical restraints has suggested that proof of the antitrust defendant's 'substantial' market power 
should be a preliminary hurdle in all restricted distribution (vertical restraint) cases. '[I]f a firm lacks market power, it cannot affect 
the price of its product,' and thus any vertical restraint could not be anticompetitive at the interbrand level. Posner, The Next Step 
in the Antitrust Treatment of Restricted Distribution: Per Se Legality, 48 U.Chi.L.Rev. 6, 16 (1981)."" (Muenster Butane, supra, 
651 F.2d at p. 298.) "
1053,6," Leffler's statements imply that anticompetitive injury results only if all major producers use the same dual distribution system. 
Then, according to him, the market becomes dominated by that system in such a way that the price of gasoline is kept artificially 
high because all these producers keep the price higher for their franchised dealers than for the rack market. While this might be 
a statement of a monopoly situation, it lacks the essential element of combination or illegal agreement. There are no such 
allegations in the complaint. Leffler's assertion that an individual producer such as Exxon is free to use the system since it will 
not suffer in competition by keeping its prices high so long as everyone else does the same thing is speculative. "
1054,7," As plainly described by the court in Muenster Butane: ""Muenster Butane's fundamental mistake throughout this case has been 
to view the product market as confined to Zenith sets. The record contains no suggestion that Zeniths are unique or that Zenith 
dealers enjoy a downward sloping demand curve for their sets. Indeed, the uncontradicted testimony of Nick Heffley indicates 
that competition between Zenith dealers and dealers in other brands of television sets was 'so keen' that he could not fix a 
minimum price for his Zeniths."" (651 F.2d at p. 296.)"
1054,8," Exxon's assertion that plaintiffs' tying claims are barred by a consent decree entered in Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp. (E.D.Pa. 
1985) 621 F. Supp. 27, a case where such arrangements were allegedly validated as part of the consent decree and in which 
many plaintiffs here were class members, is unsupported by appropriate documentary evidence showing terms, identities and 
facts. "
1055,9," Even the trial court acknowledged that ""plaintiffs have not met Exxon's assertion that the gas price was 'smack dab in the 
middle.' "" "
1056,10," Plaintiffs complain that their contract with Exxon specifies they are ""independent"" dealers. However, under the sales 
agreement complained of here, plaintiffs and Exxon have contracted for gasoline sold and supplied. A separate lease agreement 
contains a paragraph setting forth the dealers' independent status for purposes of third party liability."
1056,11," Plaintiffs argue that a summary adjudication of this point does not dispose of an entire cause of action and is therefore not a 
proper subject of summary adjudication under the new statute. ( Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (f)(1).) However, plaintiffs 
pleaded their case by combining causes of action. Exxon remains entitled to present summary adjudication motions that dispose

1067,2," Coupled with their response to defendants' motion is a motion by the plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 15(b) to amend their Second 
Amended Complaint to conform to the evidence adduced at trial. Essentially, this motion seeks to make clear that all the 
defendants' overt acts that made up the Section 1 claim constituted predatory conduct under Section 2. Rule 15(b) is intended to 
promote the objective of deciding cases on their merits rather than in terms of the relative pleading skills of counsel, or on the 
basis of a statement of the claim that was made at a preliminary point. Consequently, courts should interpret subdivision (b) 
liberally and permit an amendment whenever doing so will effectuate the underlying purpose of the rule. 6A Wright, et al., 
Federal Practice & Procedure, § 1491. Accordingly, the motion will be granted. "
1068,3," We note that the Court of Appeals used the conjunctive ""and"", rather than the disjunctive ""or"" when restating the third criterion. 
The authority cited by the Rebel Oil court, Ryko Mfg. Co. v. Eden Serv., 823 F.2d 1215, 1232 (8th Cir. 1987) and Ball Memorial 
Hosp., Inc. v. Mutual Hosp. Ins., 784 F.2d 1325, 1335 (7th Cir. 1986), both state the test in the disjunctive, i.e., plaintiff must 
show significant barriers either to the entry of new competitors or to increased output by existing competitors. We need not 
ponder this discrepancy at any length. In the instant situation, where we deal with the provision of a licensed professional 
service, entry barriers and the ability to increase output are the same. In cases dealing with the manufacture of goods, an 
increase in output is dependent upon idle capacity or the ability of competitors to quickly retool existing capacity to provide the 
goods in short supply due to the actions of the monopolist. An increase in capacity to provide a licensed professional service is 
dependent primarily upon staffing. Thus, while anesthesiologists use machines and other equipment in the provision of their 
services, the ability to increase output is limited primarily by the entry barriers we discuss below. "
1070,4," We observe in passing that, to a great extent, the ""real"" parties in interest in this matter are the HMO's and third party payors 
who let the contracts for the provision of anesthesia services. Plaintiffs brought this suit presumably to get a bigger piece of that 
market. Given the jury's verdict on the conspiracy claims, it is problematic whether plaintiffs could have received injunctive relief 
against the HMOs even if they been parties. We wait to see how plaintiffs will prove to the jury they would have received a part 
of this income stream, but for the conduct of the defendants, since the HMOs were free to contract with whomever they chose to 
provide the services they required. Anything less than direct testimony that the HMOs were prepared to give them contracts, but 
for the defendants' illegal conduct, might not be sufficient. It is not enough to ask the jury to speculate; plaintiffs must 
demonstrate actual antitrust injury. "

signed approximately 25 agreements and proposed agreements with builders/developers since July 23, 1993. Of these, only 
four contained an all-electric commitment, two dated July, 1993, one dated August, 1993, and one dated September, 1993"")). "
1105,5," Plaintiffs expert report refers to documents revealing PP&L's intent to maintain or increase market share. These documents 
state that (1) PP&L aimed for saturation levels of 85% for single homes and 75% for apartments; (2) programs were needed to 
improve saturation results; ""[3] our efforts in the first 3 years have been in the new construction market and we have taken total 
saturation of electric heat from 61% to 84% in 1986 . . . . There are 750,000 homes in our service area with fossil fuel systems 
as the only potential market which can add significantly to . . . growth;"" ""[4] the only market which has significant potential above 
what we are presently addressing is the residential conversion market;"" the heat pump program was proposed ""to maintain our 
market share and counter anti-heat pump efforts by the gas and oil companies;"" (5) PP&L needed to obtain a higher heat 
saturation in new construction; and ""[6] competition in the residential heating market has intensified and PP&L must expand 
marketing efforts for the electric heat pump to achieve market share goals."" (Def.'s Ex. 22 at 20-23). "
1114,6," The Court is not persuaded by PP&L's reliance on Empire Gas. While Empire Gas found low barriers to entry in the liquid 
petroleum retail gas industry, the Court considers the competitive forces unique to this relevant market dispositive. A finding 
contrary to Empire Gas from a different region suggests that concerns unique to the market in question control, and no 
established rule exists that a certain industry has low or high barriers to entry. The Court believes this finding varies from case to 
case. See Oahu Gas Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Resources, Inc., 838 F.2d 360, 367 (9th Cir.) (finding sufficient evidence to support the 
""conclusion that high barriers to entry existed in the Hawaiian propane market""), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 109 S. Ct. 180, 102

""to determine if monopoly power exists, it is first necessary to define the relevant market in which the power to control prices or 
and/or exclude competitors exists . . . . The same tests used to determine the relevant market in cases of actual monopolization 
are applied in attempted monopolization actions"") (citing inter alia Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 113 S. Ct.

1119,8," Asserting the agreements are inherently suspect restraints, Plaintiffs ask the Court, in the alternative, to apply the abbreviated

blown industry analysis is not required to demonstrate the anticompetitive character of an inherently suspect restraint."" Orson, 
79 F.3d at n.9 (citation omitted). In the instant case, in order to assess the anticompetitive effects, if any, of PP&L's allegedly 
violative conduct, the Court must conduct a rather comprehensive examination of the home heating industry in PP&L's service 
area. Accordingly, the Court does not consider the ""quick look"" approach applicable. "
1120,9," HN33[
] Under the traditional rule of reason: The true test of illegality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes 
competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the court must 
ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the 
restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be obtained, and all relevant 
facts. United States v. Brown Univ. in Providence in the State of Rhode Island, 5 F.3d 658, 668 n.8 (3d Cir. 1993) (citing Board of 
Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 243-44, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918)). "
1121,10," In assessing PP&L's market share, the Court defines the relevant market as residential home heating in PP&L's service area 
and the submarket as new residential construction in PP&L's service area. While this definition mirrors that employed in 
disposing of the Sherman Act § 2 claim, the Court cannot fashion, and the parties have not put forth, a more germane definition 
designed specifically for the Sherman Act § 1 claim. Compare 2 Von Kalinowski § 6.02[2] (stating that while ""market power 
under § 1 is not necessarily the same as monopoly power under § 2 of the Sherman Act, defining markets under § 1 involves the 
same analysis as under § 2 of the Sherman Act"") with Kellam, 668 F. Supp. at 889 n.41 (""defining the relevant market for 
purposes of an attempted monopolization claim is different than defining the market for an exclusive dealing claim. In an 
exclusive dealing context, the law is only concerned with the market in the product under contract""). "

Protection Procedures Act. D.C. Code § 28-3905(k)(1) (1996 Repl.) and under the common law of unjust enrichment. The

this opinion we will address the arguments presented by Robert Bogan, making explicit reference to Scott Bogan's claims only 
where they differ from Robert's."
1150,3," The origin and sponsorship of this ""Metropolitan Agreement"" are difficult to discern from Bogan's submissions to this court. He 
states in his 3(g) statement that ""beginning no later than 1984, the General Agents reached an agreement called the 
Metropolitan Agreement which restricted agents in one agency from transferring to another area agency either voluntarily or 
upon termination."" Bog. 3(g) stmt. P 35. He apparently asserts that the substance of this agreement is contained in the 
document ""Company Policy on Metropolitan Transfers."" Bog. 3(g) stmt. P 37 (""In 1989, NML decided for legal reasons that the 
Agreement would look better and have a better legal defense if it were called a company policy.""). For his part, Hodgkins apparently does not dispute that what he calls the ""Metropolitan Policy,"" (see Hdgk. Exh. V), emerged 
from a 1989 meeting of NML General Agents. However, he asserts that the document is ""improperly characterized"" as an 
agreement amongst General Agents, when it is merely the NML company policy. Although Bogan, as the non-moving party, is 
entitled to have all disputed facts construed in a light favorable to him, for simplicity's sake, this Court will refer to Exh. V by its 
title -- the ""Metropolitan Policy."" However, for purposes of the merits of Bogan's claim, where relevant, this Court will assume 
that the General Agents agreed to its provisions. "
1151,4," See Hdgk. Exh. C, 6/2 Memo from Bogan to Hodgkins, stating: ""I'm sure we can find a livable/workable solution even if that 
means my stepping down."""
1151,5," Hodgkins claims that this termination for cause was perfectly justified under Bogan's District Agency Contract. The contract 
provides in relevant part:"
1151,12," . Records - District Agent shall hold and preserve all records relating to transactions by or for the company . . . and shall 
surrender them to the General Agent or the Company on demand."
1151,20," . Term of Agreement - … It may be terminated by the General Agent upon written notice to the District Agent, by reason of . . . (ii) Failure of the District Agent to comply with any of the terms hereof, . . . It may be terminated by either party at any time, without cause, upon thirty days' written notice. Exh. A, NML 3(g) stmt. "
1152,6," The copy of the Metropolitan Policy submitted as Exh. V is very poor. This Court has attempted to transcribe it as accurately as 
possible. It states, in relevant part, that: Transfers within a metropolitan area are a touchy subject. Our first objective is to operate in the best interests of the 
Company and its General Agency system. Second, we seek reasonable solutions consistent with applicable federal and 
state law involving trade and commerce. In addition, we want to minimize Home Office interference in the conduct of local 
business because we feel it is contrary to the spirit of the General Agency System. However, the Company and the General 
Agents have to protect investments of time, energy and money in the recruitment, training, development and support of 
agents and in the General Agency system. Therefore, we need to operate within certain guidelines to provide a modicum of 
structure and some basic ""rules of the road"" with reference to transfers, especially in areas where several Agencies operate 
within the same territory. Our policy on operating General Agencies in metropolitan areas, as it relates to transfers, is as follows:"
1152,1," . Active, contracted Agents residing within shared territory shall not transfer between General Agencies without the 
approval of both General Agents. (This includes proposed transfers where a change in contract to include management or 
specialist responsibilities is involved.) . . ."
1152,3," . Agents who are ""terminated"" by a General Agency will not automatically be prevented from contracting with another 
General Agency unless the reasons for termination involved failure to comply with company rules or ethical practices or to 
meet other standards for holding a Northwestern Mutual Contract. "

1153,7," As a preliminary matter, we assume that Bogan has standing to bring an antitrust claim here. As a prominent commentator has 
noted, most courts have concluded that ""HN3[
] employees may challenge antitrust violations that are premised on restraining 
the employment market but not violations premised on restraining competition in the downstream product market in which their 
employers sell."" AREEDA, ANTITRUST LAW, P 377a, p. 311. But see Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 800 (2d Cir. 1994). 
Balaklaw held that a doctor excluded by a hospital did not have standing under the antitrust laws because he had not shown 
anticompetitive effects in the relevant market. Since the question of the proper market is central to the analysis of the underlying 
antitrust claims, rather than summarily dismissing this case without analysis of the merits of those claims, we reserve 
consideration of this matter for our discussion of the § 1 conspiracy claim."
1153,8," HN4[

of regulating the business of insurance, or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business, unless such Act specifically 
relates to the business of insurance; Provided, That after June 30, 1948, the Act of July 2, 1890, as amended, known as the 
Sherman Act, and the Act of October 15, 1914 known as the Clayton Act, and the Act of September 26, 1914, known as the

Circuit as being inconsistent with its ruling in Wood v. Nat'l Basketball Ass'n, 809 F.2d 954 (2d Cir. 1987). See U.S. Football, 842 "
1155,," F.2d 1335 at 1372. Wood held that a basketball player's claim that certain practices of the NBA teams were a per se violation of 
§ 1 was preempted by the collective bargaining provisions of labor law.  Wood, 809 F.2d at 958-62 (challenging salary cap, 
college draft and prohibition of player corporations arrived at through collective bargaining.) Smith ruled that the labor laws do 
not preempt a challenge to the NFL draft under the antitrust laws. Smith, 593 F.2d at 1179 n.22. Mackey ruled that a challenge 
to an NFL league rule regarding compensation of free agent's former club by new owners was not preempted by the labor laws 
because it was not the product of bona fide arm's length bargaining.  Mackey, 543 F.2d at 615. It appears that all that the Wood 
court intended to criticize were the portions of the Smith and Mackey decisions which ruled that there was no preemption."
1155,10," This discussion was not essential to the holding in Fuchs. Relying upon the insufficiency of evidence of a conspiracy, the 
Fuchs Court found that a Sugar refiner and its general (non-exclusive) brokers were not guilty of a § 1 conspiracy in restraint of 
trade because in eliminating the general dealers (in favor of exclusive dealers), the refiner had acted unilaterally.  602 F.2d 1025 
at 1031. "
1156,11," It is not clear, however, that the contract should be taken at face value. Both parties, at various times, urge that the contract is 
not representative of the actual relationship between the parties. Although Bogan strenuously urges that the General Agents are 
not one entity with NML, at another point he contends that ""NML has treated all agents as agents of NML and it regularly 
controls their conduct by various means, up to and including directing or threatening their termination."" (Pl. Br. p. 3, Bog. Aff. PP 
24-34). Hodgkins, likewise, while insisting that NML and its various agents should be treated as one entity, allegedly has 
""repeatedly stated"" that NML does not control the agents and that they are free to run their own businesses. Tamscin Aff. P 16; 
S. Bog. Aff. P 16."
1156,12," Hodgkins urges that this court should follow the Tenth Circuit's lead in Card v. Nat'l Life, 603 F.2d 828 (10th Cir. 1979), 
affirming a summary judgment for an insurer accused of conspiring with its General Agents to establish and enforce an exclusive 
agency agreement. There, the General Agents of National Life formed a corporation known as the General Agents Association, 
which was owned, controlled and financed by National Life General Agents. The General Agents met with officers of National "
1157,," Life and consulted with them on all major policy decisions.  Id. at 830. (According to Tamscin, the General Agents of NML also 
had an ""independent"" organization, with its own officers and management, to ""handle matters of interest to their members and 
represent their members' interests in matters pertaining to their relationship with NML."" Tamscin Aff. (Scott Bogan) P 8.) The Tenth Circuit found this Association, as well as individual general agents to be ""really part of the National Life Structure"" and 
thus incapable of being regarded as conspirators.  Id. at 834. See also Pa. Indep. Bus. Assoc. v. Unicorn Mktg., 1985 WL 2812 
at *3-4 (If a corporation and its independent and separately incorporated subsidiary cannot form an antitrust conspiracy because 
the required 'different interests' do not exist, then it is highly unlikely that a corporation can conspire with its agents . . . An 
agent's interests ultimately coincide with those of the corporation and do not constitute the different interest required for 
concerted action under the antitrust laws."") However, in addition to having very little solid information as to what the role of the NML General Agents' association was in the 
formation of NML company policy, we do not believe the exclusive agency agreement at issue in Card to be analogous to the 
no-transfer agreement at issue here. In Card, all General Agents had the same interest in disallowing the writing of outside 
business by their subordinate agents -- the loss of prospective commissions. Here, the General Agents have competing interests 
in recruiting the most productive agents from other General Agencies. Therefore, we do not find Card compelling. "
1158,13," Recall from fn.9 that this case and Mackey v. Nat'l Football League, 543 F.2d 606 (8th Cir.), cert. dism'd, 434 U.S. 801, 98 S. 
Ct. 28, 54 L. Ed. 2d 59 (1977), were criticized by the Second Circuit, likely on the issue of labor law preemption of the antitrust 
laws."
1158,14," In making this statement, we do not mean to suggest that we are convinced that Hodgkins' proffered justification for firing 
Bogan was not pretextual and that the Metropolitan Policy did not provide some assistance to Hodgkins in his efforts to end 
Bogan's relationship with NML. Although Hodgkins offered considerable evidence that some of Bogan's subordinates considered 
him a difficult and ""dictatorial"" supervisor, the facts as Bogan presents them paint a picture that he was highly successful and 
that he was drummed out by Hodgkins, who conditioned his further employment on his allowing his Soliciting Agents to break 
their exclusive agency contracts with NML. Bogan suggests this was a mere pretext for taking over his agency. Hodgkins 
counters that he fired Hodgkins for legitimate reasons -- causing unrest in the office and refusing to turn over Slocum and 
Wintrich's records -- and that the absence of a conspiracy is shown by the fact that another General Agent did agree to contract 
with Bogan. Hodgkins adds that it was NML (not Hodgkins) that disapproved of the Bogan's proposed contract with another 
General Agent, that NML was perfectly justified in doing so, and that Bogan's failure to sue NML itself for antitrust violations is 
instructive. While these facts provide evidence that there was no such conspiracy, they do not establish that conclusion as a 
matter of law. A reasonable jury might find that through the Metropolitan Policy, Hodgkins and NML used coercion aimed at 
getting Bogan to ""go along"" with Hodgkins' alleged policy of ""don't ask, don't tell"" with respect to the Soliciting Agents' violations 
of their exclusive agency contracts, that Bogan was not justly fired for cause, and that the Metropolitan Policy that facilitated his 
permanent termination could be considered a ""boycott."" All this being said, we still cannot conclude that the challenged pattern 
of behavior constitutes the type of boycott that is illegal per se. "
1160,15," There are countless cases discussing whether to denominate similar agreements as vertical or horizontal conspiracies. Many 
find such arrangements to be vertical. See, e.g., Blanton Enter., Inc. v. Burger King Corp., 680 F. Supp. 753, 765 (D.S.C. 1988) 
(refusal by Burger King of franchise to plaintiff was vertical restraint, despite complaints of franchisees). We believe, however, 
that the best characterization of the Metropolitan Agreement is that it was both vertical and horizontal in nature. "
1161,16," Bogan argues that even if agent services are not considered a market, the Sherman Act protects the benefits of competition in 
""vital matters such as claim policy and quality of service."" Bog. Br. p. 27 (citations omitted). While he is certainly correct about 
the law, he is still incorrect in defining the proper market -- it is not simply NML claim policies and the quality of service available 
to NML customers that is protected, but policies and level of service in the entire industry, or at least the New York Metropolitan 
area."
1161,17," Recall from fn.9 that this case has been criticized by the Second Circuit, likely on the issue of labor law preemption of the 
antitrust laws."
1161,18," The Court noted that ""absent a facial showing of anticompetitive purpose underlying the adopting or enforcement of a rule, the 
disciplinary activity of a sports organization must be evaluated under the Denver Rockets test or the rule of reason."" 675 F.2d 
445 at 455 (referring to Denver Rockets v. All-Pro Management Inc., 325 F. Supp. 1049, 1064-65 (C.D. Cal 1971)). "
1162,19," Bogan himself testifies in detail as to the importance and expense of training agents. See, e.g., R. Bog. Aff. P 16, P 55 (""The 
recruiting, training and performance of Sales Agents determines 100 percent of management revenue."")."
1162,20," This is a further reason that the Metropolitan policy cannot be considered a ""group boycott."" Topps Chewing Gum, supra, 641 
F. Supp. at 1186, suggests that such group boycotts must have a ""pernicious effect on competition and lack any redeeming 
virtue."" "
1163,21," Bogan would have us apply the ""Quick Look"" approach to the rule of reason, arguing that ""Because these are restraints by 
horizontal competitors, as Hodgkins admits, the 'Quick Look' approach requires Hodgkins to justify the restraint by proving that 
procompetitive effects outweigh anticompetitive effects and are the least restrictive available."" Hdgk. Br. p. 34. To justify the 
application of the ""Quick Look"" approach, he quotes the Seventh Circuit in Chicago Pro Sports, infra, as stating that such an 
approach applies because ""there was a 'naked restraint' of a horizontal nature because it was an agreement among competitors 
as to certain issues concerning how they would compete with each other."" This quotation ""cherry picks"" a phrase from its context 
-- the ""naked restraint"" must be one on ""price or output"". See, e.g., Chicago Pro Sports, 961 F.2d at 674. As discussed above, 
the conspiracy alleged here does not constitute a price restriction in the relevant market -- that of the labor of agents industry-
wide, or at least metropolitan-area-wide. Nor does it affect output. Bogan does not allege that it affects the number of policies 
sold or agents hired. The Metropolitan Policy merely prevents transfers of agents between NML General Agencies."
1163,22," Even though Bogan has since recontracted with Massachusetts Mutual and still apparently uses the same offices, he alleges 
that he lost a significant client base that did not transfer with him to Massachusetts Mutual as well as generous retirement 
benefits. See Bog. Aff. PP 12-13. We find these assertions credible, and thus sufficient to establish personal harm from his 
termination, although his subsequent contract with Massachusetts Mutual provides evidence that interbrand competition was 
increased by his termination."
1163,23," Even if NML agents were the proper market (which we do not believe), there is no evidence before this court that anyone other 
than Robert (and perhaps Scott) Bogan was prohibited from transferring. In fact, Scott Bogan concedes in his deposition that 
Stephen Gilberg had stated in a June 11th meeting that the Metropolitan Policy ""would not be an inhibition . . . [to recontracting]"" 
and that ""there have been transfers of agents previously between agencies; and that it wasn't an issue. Nobody would be 
encumbered."" S. Bog. Depo. p. 455 (emphasis added). "
1164,24," Balaklaw was actually decided on the basis of standing; the Second Circuit found that since plaintiff had not shown injury to 
competition in the relevant market, he had not demonstrated antitrust injury and had no standing.  Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 798-800. 
The court noted: HN14[
] For standing purposes, however, whether there was or was not a per se violation is irrelevant. Regardless of any substantive violation of the Sherman Act, sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act still require plaintiffs to establish that the 
defendants engaged in anticompetitive conduct that caused them an antitrust injury . . . Although the per se rule relieves 
plaintiff of the burden of demonstrating an anticompetitive effect, which is assumed, it does not excuse a plaintiff from 
showing that his injury was caused by the anticompetitive acts. Id. (citations omitted.) Since we decide that for the same reasons, Bogan has failed the rule of reason test, we need not reach 
the standing issue."
1164,25," Bogan strenuously urges that this situation is analogous to that of a professional sports player who is not allowed by the 
league to transfer between teams. While these cases have numerous similarities, the one fatal dissimilarity Bogan fails to 
perceive is that here, there are other insurance agencies for whom he could work. In fact, Bogan is apparently working for one 
now. Hdgk. Br. p. 7. When the NFL forbids a player to transfer without compensation of his prior team, see Mackey, supra, he is 
effectively prevented from playing elsewhere. "
1169,1," As a further result of the investigation, two additional athletic shoe manufacturers signed consent orders with the FTC and 
settled ""companion"" parens patrie suits filed in this Court by the fifty states and the District of Columbia. See State of New York

1173,2," Although the Court, having already determined that alternate grounds warrant dismissal, need not address this portion of 
Defendant's argument, the Court will nonetheless address this question in order to avoid relitigation of this motion to dismiss in 
the event Plaintiffs refile the Complaint in accordance with the Court's standing analysis. "
1177,1," Defendants object also to the fact that the second amended complaint contains claims which previously have been dismissed. 
The objection is without merit. Plaintiffs are merely preserving their rights with respect to the dismissed claims. The grant of

1182,12," Dr. Johnson contends that the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine should not apply here because the policies that produced it

59. Girard and Herrmann foreclose the argument before this Court."
1182,13," Plaintiff's reliance on Garza v. City of Omaha, 814 F.2d 553 (8th Cir. 1987), is misplaced. While Garza did find the 
intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine inapplicable, it did so principally because there was evidence that the individual defendants 
acted out of ""personal animosity."" Id. at 557. To be sure, the panel referred also to evidence of personal bias. But it did not 
address the point here presented. To whatever extent it is fairly read as supporting plaintiff's position, the Court declines to follow 
it for the reason adduced in the text. Cases such as Walker v. Woodward Governor Co., 631 F. Supp. 91 (N.D. Ill. 1986), also 
relied upon by plaintiff, which reject the intraenterprise conspiracy doctrine in the Section 1985(3) context are inconsistent with 
Girard and Herrmann and therefore inapplicable in this Circuit."
1182,14," Plaintiff actually contends that it should be confined to cases involving ""no more than a single act of discrimination by a single

(3) failure to allow plaintiffs to recover profits on sales to Lucent during 1994 to 1995; and (4) failure to allow plaintiffs to continue 
to sell cordless telephones to Lucent at the price at which plaintiffs could recover their profits. Plaintiffs allege that Lucent

1195,15," Lucent notes correctly that, in Schwimmer, the court allowed the introduction of parole evidence ""only for the purpose of 
interpreting the writing-- not for the purpose of modifying or enlarging or curtailing its terms."" 96 A.2d at 656. Lucent, however, is 
incorrect in characterizing plaintiffs' claims as ""seeking to modify, enlarge or curtail the terms of the GPAs."" (D.I. 14 at 6-7 n.9) 
Plaintiffs' argument that the terms of the GPAs do not apply to its other agreements involves interpreting what the parties 
intended the terms of the GPAs to mean."
1195,16," In Brautigam, the New Jersey Supreme Court considered a contract without an integration clause. The Brautigam court simply 
held that the contract was incomplete upon examining its terms.  89 A. at 763. The court recognizes that in Zone Co. the New 
Jersey Supreme Court held that the contract was integrated because ""there is a clear implication of fact from the writing itself."" 
57 A.2d at 564. However, the New Jersey Supreme Court in Zone Co. also specifically declined to pursue the question of 
whether extrinsic evidence is admissible in determining whether a contract was integrated. 57 A.2d at 564. "
1196,17," In the alternative, Lucent argues that the statute of frauds renders any oral contract regarding the purchase of telephones 
unenforceable. (D.I. 9 at 8) Plaintiffs cite California Natural, Inc. v. Nestle Holdings, Inc., for the proposition that they can avoid 
the application of the statute of frauds through the doctrine of promissory estoppel.  631 F. Supp. 465, 472 (D.N.J. 1986) 
(applying New Jersey law). In response, Lucent argues that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs cannot show reasonable reliance on 
the alleged agreements because the GPAs contain explicit terms to the contrary. However, without first considering extrinsic 
evidence relating to the GPAs and other agreements, the court cannot determine, as a matter of law, that plaintiffs' reliance was 
unreasonable.  Id. at 473 (stating that ""until all factual issues are resolved . . . the court cannot rule as a matter of law that 
[plaintiff's] reliance was unreasonable"")."

] Under New Jersey law, a breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing may be established if a 
defendant encourages a plaintiff to make substantial investments while actively concealing its decision to terminate a contract.

1197,," not actively conceal its decision to terminate the contract). In the present case, plaintiffs allege that Lucent concealed its decision 
to terminate its relationship, while it encouraged plaintiffs to invest in new or expanded facilities. (D.I. 11 at 20)"
1197,19," Under New Jersey law, in order to state a claim for promissory estoppel a plaintiff must allege the following: (1) a clear and 
definite promise was made by the promisor; (2) the promise was made with the expectation that the promisee would rely on it; 
(3) the promisee must in fact reasonably rely on the promise; and (4) the promisee suffered detriment on a definite and 
substantial nature in reliance on the promise.  R. J. Longo Constr. Co. v. Transit Am., 921 F. Supp. 1295, 1305 (D.N.J. 1996).

1198,21," Lucent also argues that plaintiffs' antitrust claim should be dismissed because they fail to allege (1) that Lucent had a 
dangerous probability of success in attempting to monopolize the relevant market and (2) fail to allege an antitrust injury. The 
court declines to address these issues since it finds that plaintiffs have failed to establish jurisdiction. "
1199,22," The court declines to follow the ruling in Eskofot A/S v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., cited by plaintiffs.  872 F. Supp. 81 
(S.D.N.Y. 1995). The majority of cases, cited above, establish that the ""import trade or import commerce"" exception in the FTAIA 
applies only to domestic importers. Furthermore, plaintiffs' case is factually different from Eskofot A/S. In Eskofot A/S, the plaintiff 
alleged that both it and the defendant planned to market and sell their products in the United States.  Id. at 85. In the present 
case, the complaint contains no allegations that plaintiffs imported or planned to import any products into the United States 
themselves."

1207,3," Two leading antitrust commentators have addressed whether those displaced by a merger have standing to sue under the 
antitrust laws. Many mergers have been challenged by suppliers (including dealers, franchisees, and employees providing the merging 
firms with distribution and other services) displaced as a result of the merger. Injury-in-fact may be doubtful when 
equivalent opportunities are available elsewhere. If other opportunities do not exist [as alleged by Florida Seed], displaced 
suppliers made redundant by a merger suffer actual losses but not antitrust injury, for the rationale for condemning a 
merger lies in its potential for supracompetitive pricing, not in its potential for cost savings and other efficiencies. A merger 
that actually brings about supracompetitive prices and diminished output reduces the need for inputs and can therefore 
injure suppliers. Although such an injury connects more closely with the rationale for finding a violation, it is still not antitrust 
injury because it is neither the means by which output is restricted nor the direct concern of antitrust rules protecting 
product market competition. PHILIP AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, Antitrust Law P 381 (rev. ed. 1995) (emphasis added). Professors Areeda and 
Hovenkamp support our view that Florida Seed has suffered no antitrust injury from Monsanto's acquisition of Ortho. "

and that of Dr. James Bolling who is affiliated with the Mayo Clinic. "
1214,4," Whether there is an actual combination or conspiracy appears to be an issue among the parties. Defendants seem to argue 
that BEI is a legitimate joint venture and that the referral of patients exclusively to FRI is reasonably necessary to effectuate its 
purpose. However, assuming defendants can establish the existence of a joint venture, its practices would not thereby 
automatically be immune from antitrust scrutiny. See 2 EARL W. KINTNER, FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW § 9.15 (1980). "
1216,5," In early 1994, the Florida EyeCare Network was formed. Plaintiffs' principals were among the initial shareholders of the network 
and are the only retina specialists in the network, although, according to Plaintiff, there is no agreement to refer retina patients 
solely to RA. Plaintiff also refers to the Florida EyeCare Network as an unsuccessful venture, but does not appear to attribute 
that lack of success to any allegedly illegal conduct of defendants. A third network, Eye Care Associates of North Florida, has 
also been formed. Dr. Bolling, of the Mayo Clinic, is the exclusive retina care provider for that network. "

services. B-704. These figures are not relevant in comparison to ISD's revenues because ISD only provided infusion 
pharmaceutical products and did not provide nursing services. As noted above, plaintiff no longer asserts any direct claims 
against VNA, the entity that provides nursing services in conjunction with ISD products. See supra n. 2. "

Newspapers, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191, 1203 (3d Cir. 1995), indicated leveraging claims were under attack for being ""economically 
groundless."" See Delaware Health Care, Inc. v. MCD Holding Co., 893 F. Supp. 1279, 1288 n.2 (D. Del. 1995). Nevertheless, 
the Court does not read Advo to repudiate all leveraging claims. Id. "
1226,10," This distinction is most vividly described in Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy § 3.6d, at 113-14 (1994) (footnotes 
omitted) (quoted in Bathke v. Casey's Gen. Stores, Inc. 64 F.3d 340, 346 (8th Cir. 1995)): Fifteen miles outside of City A is a small town, Town B, which contains a single shoe store, Smith's Clothing. The only 
people who ever shop in Smith's Clothing are residents of Town B. When Smith's is accused of monopolization, the 
plaintiffs argue that Town B defines the relevant geographic market, since all of the store's customers come from there. In 
that case, Smith's market share is 100%. But further inquiry shows the following. Last year 800 residents of Town B purchased shoes. 400 of them purchased from 
Smith's Clothing, and the other 400 purchased from the numerous shoe stores in City A. Note that this conclusion is 
absolutely consistent with the proposition that Smith's ""trade area"" is Town B. The only customers Smith's had were from 
Town B, assuming no one drove from City A to buy shoes at Smith's. In fact, Smith's is probably in close competition with 
the City A shoe stores. To the extent Town B residents go into City A to work or to shop, they regard the City shoe stores 
as interchangeable, and would respond to any local price increase by purchasing even more of their shoes in City A. In sum, ""trade area"" considers the extent to which customers will travel in order to do business at Smith's. ""Relevant 
market"" considers the extent to which customers will travel in order to avoid doing business at Smith's. Unfortunately, this 
means that using discovery to obtain the addresses of a seller's customers seldom provides us with useful information 
about geographic market. What we really need to know is the extent to which people from the immediate area can readily 
turn to alternative sellers . . . . "
1227,11," There are eight hospitals in New Castle County. Three are psychiatric hospitals, and thus compete with MCD but only to the 
limited extent MCD offers psychiatric inpatient hospital care. A fourth, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, was not considered 
by plaintiff's expert to compete with MCD because it serves a different population. Of the remaining three, two are affiliated with 
MCD -- A.I. DuPont Institute, a children's hospital, and Riverside Hospital, which was acquired by MCD in 1995. The remaining 
hospital is St. Francis. See B-580 (Solow Decl.)."

1227,13," The label ""Little In From Outside"" may seem somewhat of a misnomer when what is measured is actually the percentage of 
customers who remain in the market or leave the market to purchase goods or services. However, the aim of ""Little In From 
Outside"" is to calculate the proportion of sales of goods or services purchased in the provisional market that were produced by 
suppliers located outside the provisional market -- which may be accomplished by measuring the percentage of customers who 
left the market when they purchased the goods or services at issue. See B-574."
1227,14," Similar to the LIFO label, ""Little Out From Inside"" seems the wrong designation for this calculation. However, its aim is to 
calculate the percentage of goods or services produced within the provisional market that are sold to consumers residing in the 
market versus those consumers who reside outside the provisional market. That calculation may be achieved by measuring the 
percentage of consumers who entered the market to purchase services. See id. "
1229,15," The figure for MCD includes beds at the A.I. DuPont Institute, an MCD affiliate, and Riverside Hospital, which was acquired by 
MCD in 1995. See supra n. 11; B-580. "
1230,16," In requiring proof of this element, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals differs from the Second and Sixth Circuits, which require a 
lesser showing of ""competitive advantage"" in the ""downstream"" market, see Kerasotes Michigan Theatres, Inc. v. National 
Amusements, Inc., 854 F.2d 135 (6th Cir. 1988); Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263 (2d Cir. 1979), cert

1233,22," The fact that hospitals outside New Castle County are a potential source of business for plaintiff is not inconsistent with the 
Court's earlier holding a question of fact exists as to whether New Castle County is the relevant geographic market for inpatient 
hospital services in this case. The relevant geographic market measures where consumers could look for services; however, 
DHC does not face similar constraints in where it can market patients."

injury. "
1235,*," The Honorable Ellsworth A. Van Graafeiland, United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit, sitting by designation. "
1240,1," Originally this action was brought solely against Greenville, but it was amended to include Greenville's general partner, Forum 
Group, Inc., an Indiana corporation, as an additional defendant. Greenville is 50% owned by Forum Group and 50% owned by 
three individual limited partners. Forum Group manages or owns 44 retirement facilities throughout the United States."
1240,2," The Stonegates Declaration provides that ""each unit, other than the Service Units, and all Common Elements shall be used 
and occupied exclusively for residential purposes and as a single family dwelling."""
1240,3," Article 11 of the Residence Agreement entered into by all Stonegates' unit owners grants Greenville an ""exclusive an 
irrevocable option"" to repurchase their unit in the event of the owner's death or termination of residency for any other reason. "
1241,4," It appears that Greenville chose to use the condominium structure for Stonegates, rather than entering into leasing agreements 
with tenants, in order to obtain financing and tax benefits for both the residents and Greenville. This structure for a continuing 
care retirement community is not entirely unique and is recognized as a viable structure for such a facility by the Delaware Life 
Care Registration Act 18 Del. C. Ch. 46."
1241,5," Pursuant to the Code of Regulations, the Council has complete governance control over the affairs of the condominium. The 
Declaration of Stonegates provides that Greenville, as the owner of the two service units, is entitled to designate the majority of 
its members."
1241,6, Forum Group receives 8 percent of the gross operating revenue of Stonegates as its management fee.
1241,7," Greenville is under no obligation to enter into a Residence Agreement with any individual who applies to purchase a 
condominium unit. Therefore, Greenville has the ability to control who buys units in the retirement community, whether from 
Greenville itself or from a unit owner, in the event that Greenville did not exercise its repurchase option."
1241,8," As of March 1995, only two types of improvements made by unit owners were entitled to be calculated into the repurchase 
sales price formula. Unit owners would be given credit for up to $ 8,000 spent on constructing a screened in porch and up to $ 
25,000 for adding a glass enclosed room on the patio of a unit. The sales price would not be increased for any other types of 
improvements."
1241,9," Net proceeds of unit sales are used by Greenville to pay for operating expenses, improvements, and services provided at 
Stonegates, as well as providing Greenville with net profit. If Greenville did not receive these proceeds, it contends that it would 
be operating Stonegates at a net loss unless it increased certain fees. "
1242,10," Generally, such fees appear to be of the same magnitude, or higher, than the purchase price of a unit at Stonegates."
1242,11," Each resident is assured the availability of a semi-private room in the Health Care unit, if needed, and has access to a 24 hour 
on call nursing staff."
1242,12," Apparently, there has been no change in the number of units or impact on common expenses since Greenville pays the 
proportionate share of common expenses owed by the two units and covered all costs of the modifications. Greenville's 
expenses are offset by the additional revenues it receives from the services provided to residents in these units."
1242,13," Greenville has stated that it could and would seek retroactive 80% approval of its uses of the two units, and reconvert such 
units to residential use, at its own expense, if such approval was not granted. Mr. Maddock concedes apparently that this would 
ameliorate any continuing technical violation of the Declaration. "
1243,14," Mr. Maddock apparently was aware of the Bankruptcy Court proceeding when he filed his original complaint which expressly 
refers to the proceeding. "
1244,15," In a Fifth Circuit case involving tying, Imperial Point Colonnades-Condominium v. Mangurian, the court found that a collection 
of payment for the tied product created a new cause of action which was actionable regardless of whether the tying contract was 
executed prior to the statute of limitations period. See 549 F.2d 1029 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 859."
1244,16," See Sherrelldein Price v. Wilmington Trust Company, Del. Ch., C.A. No. 12476, Allen, C. (May 19, 1995), 1995 Del. Ch. 
LEXIS 65 at *6-8 (finding in breach of contract case that each alleged overcharging gave rise to a separate cause of action, 
triggering a new statute of limitations period, because the continuing wrong could be segmented into independent wrongful acts). "
1245,17," In Greene v. E.H. Rollins & Sons, Inc., Del. Ch., 22 Del. Ch. 394, 2 A.2d 249, 252 (1938), this Court stated that: HN1[
] Individuals have authority in law to enter into all sorts of contracts. But this general power to make contracts does 
not of course mean that every term in a contract which individuals may choose to adopt, shall in every instance be 
recognized as valid and binding. No individual may exercise his broad power to enter into contract relations with another so 
as to offend against what the law deems to be sound public policy."
1245,18," Mr. Maddock has cited several cases to support the proposition that state courts have power to refuse to enforce contracts 
found to violate the Sherman Act. While this is true, it is not relevant in this case where it is the plaintiff asking for relief pursuant 
to the federal antitrust law. In Lyons v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., Judge Hand explained that violations of federal antitrust 
law may be raised in a state court as a defense only where the plaintiff's claim is an attempt to enforce ""an undertaking itself 
forbidden."" 222 F.2d 184, 190 (2d. Cir. 1955); see Rohm and Haas Co. v. Polycast Technology Corp., 297 A.2d 53, 55 (1972)."
1245,19," Using this power, the state attorney general pursued an illegal tying action involving a trailer park which required purchasers of 
their lots to purchase their mobile homes from a specific company. See In the Matter of Attorney General's Investigation of 
Creekside Homes, Inc., Del. Ch., C.A. No. 6869, Longobardi, V.C. (Sept. 15, 1982)."
1245,20," Recent United States Supreme Court jurisprudence, tending to narrowly construe statues when asked to recognize an implied 
private cause of action, suggests that this is the correct result. See Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 578, 61 L. 
Ed. 2d 82, 99 S. Ct. 2479 (1979) (Rehnquist opinion discussing a new, stricter standard to be applied where a party is "
1246,," requesting the recognition of an implied private cause of action). The fact that Section 2109 of the state statute provides that a 
final judgment in an action initiated by the attorney general ""is prima facie evidence against [the defendant] in any other action 
as to all matters with respect to which the judgment or decree would be an estoppel between the parties thereto,"" is insufficient 
to find that a implied private cause of action was intended by the legislature. "
1247,21," This type of restraint on alienation can have the effect of preventing or discouraging the sale of property, or property 
improvements, because the owner is unable to realize the full value of the property at the time of sale. See, e.g., American Law 
of Property, Little Brown & Co., 1952, A. James Casner, Editor-in-Chief, § 26.65; Restatement of the Law, Property (2d), 
Donative Transfers, § 4.4 (1983)."
1247,22," For a complete list of the factors, see McInerney, 1988 Del. Ch. LEXIS 47 at *20-21. "
1248,23," Mr. Maddock argues that this case is analogous to McInerney v. Slights, where a contract providing the plaintiff with a right of 
first refusal to purchase land at a set price, substantially below the market value of the property at the time of trial, was held to be 
an unreasonable restraint on alienation. Id. at *2. Although several of the elements of the restraint were similar, this Court found 
that none of the Restatement factors tending to indicate reasonableness were present in McInerney v. Slights. Id. at 21. Only the 
unique set of facts presented in McInerney v. Slights merited this Court to take the highly unusual step of invalidating a contract. 
See Filasky v. von Schnurbein, Del. Ch., C.A. 10545, Jacobs, V.C. (Jan. 17, 1990) 1990 Del. Ch. LEXIS 5 at *7-8. The restraint 
on alienation imposed on Stonegates' residents appears to be reasonable and enforceable when analyzed in the context of 
Greenville's plan to provide continuing care retirement community services. "
1256,1," Unless otherwise specified, all statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code. "
1258,2," Needless to say, we repudiate the dissent's suggestion we have ""perverse[ly]"" attempted to ""introduce[] into the statute an 
ambiguity that is not present if the words are taken to mean what they say."" (Dis. opn., post, at p. 1272.) In our view, the text of 
section 17045 is not so much ambiguous as simply silent on the question before us; it neither restricts ""competition"" to the 
primary line, nor expressly extends to competition in the secondary line. The dissent, like MECA, relies heavily on a supposed 
implication arising from section 17045's reference to the prohibited acts of sellers, but, as we have seen, any such implication 
dissolves when the statutory context--especially sections 17046, 17047 and 17048--is considered. In any event, the dissent's 
inferential method of interpretation hardly justifies its claim of unique fidelity to the plain statutory text. "
1259,3," MECA concedes ABC had standing to bring this action, but maintains ABC is nonetheless required to plead and prove injury to 
one of MECA's competitors."
1259,4," The parties have not provided, and our own research has not discovered, any direct legislative history relating to the enactment 
of section 17045's predecessor. Of necessity we rely on broader evidence of the legal and economic concerns motivating the 
law. "
1261,5," Representative Wright Patman, introducing his 1935 bill in the House of Representatives, described both aspects of the chain 
store problem in characteristically vivid language: ""In the field of merchandise distribution a Goliath stands against divided forces 
plying a powerful weapon with a skillful hand against the vulnerable weaknesses of his opponents. [P] The Goliath is the huge 
chain stores sapping the civic life of local communities with an absentee overlordship, draining off their earnings to his coffers, 
and reducing their independent business men to employees or to idleness. [P] His weapon is huge buying power, by the 
manipulation of which he threatens manufacturers and others with financial stringency or even bankruptcy if they refuse him the 
prices and terms he demands. His opponents are not only these manufacturers, not only the independent competitors whom he 
seeks to eliminate, but the consuming public, whom he hopes then to have at his mercy."" (Remarks of Rep. Wright Patman 
introducing H.R. No. 8442, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 79 Cong. Rec. 9077 (June 11, 1935) reprinted in 4 Kintner, The Legislative 
History of the Federal Antitrust Laws and Related Statutes (1980) p. 2927 (hereafter Kintner).) Elsewhere Representative 
Patman emphasized that the chains were enriching themselves at the expense of independent merchants not through fair and 
open competition but through ""secret rebates"" and ""special discounts"" not available to the independents. (House Debate on H.R. 
No. 8442, 74th Cong., 2d Sess., 80 Cong. Rec. 8102 (May 27, 1936) reprinted in 4 Kintner, supra, at p. 3268.)"
1261,6," By 1938, there were a large number of state unfair practices acts, commonly prohibiting unjustified price discrimination as well

1263,7," Section 17040 provides: ""It is unlawful for any person engaged in the production, manufacture, distribution or sale of any article 
or product of general use or consumption, with intent to destroy the competition of any regular established dealer in such article 
or product, or to prevent the competition of any person who in good faith, intends and attempts to become such dealer, to create 
locality discriminations. [P] Nothing in this section prohibits the meeting in good faith of a competitive price."" Section 17031 provides: ""Locality discrimination means a discrimination between different sections, communities or cities or 
portions thereof, or between different locations in such sections, communities, cities or portions thereof in this State, by selling or 
furnishing an article or product, at a lower price in one section, community or city, or any portion thereof, or in one location in 
such section, community, or city or any portion thereof, than in another."" "
1264,8," In support of its interpretation, MECA also cites Plotkin v. Tanner's Vacuums (1975) 53 Cal. App. 3d 454 [125 Cal. Rptr. 697], 
and Carlock v. Pillsbury Co. (D.Minn. 1989) 719 F. Supp. 791. Plotkin did not involve unearned discounts or any form of 
discriminatory pricing, and discussed only sections 17040 and 17043. The discussion in Carlock concerned only section 17040. 
Similarly, the dissenting opinion's reliance on Beam v. Monsanto Co., Inc. (1976) 259 Ark. 253 [532 S.W.2d 175, 181-182] (dis. 
opn., post, at p. 1279, fn. 2) is misplaced, as that decision concerned only a locality discrimination prohibition modeled on 
sections 17031 and 17040."
1264,9," For the proposition that the UPA operates ""horizontally"" rather than ""vertically,"" we cited, in Harris, three law review articles, two 
of which MECA cites for the same proposition. None specifically addresses the question before us. The principal authority relied 
upon, Professor Ewald Grether, appears to have meant, in distinguishing between the ""horizontal"" UPA and the ""vertical"" Fair 
Trade Law, merely that under the UPA ""action . . . need not wait upon the initiative of manufacturers or distributors at the apex of 
the distributive pyramid, but may arise at any level."" (Grether, supra, 24 Cal.L.Rev. at p. 686.) One should also note that 
Professor Grether, in the cited article, focused on the historical background and prospects for enforcement of the UPA and Fair 
Trade Law, and disavowed any intent to engage in ""[i]nterpretation of the law, technically speaking."" ( Id. at p. 641.) The 
reference to ""the horizontal concept of trade regulation"" in Cupp, The Unfair Practices Act (1936) 10 So.Cal.L.Rev. 18, is brief 
and nonspecific. The final academic passage quoted in Harris, supra, 64 Cal. 2d at pages 461-462, deals specifically with 
primary versus secondary line injury, but was concerned only with the locality discrimination provisions, which, of course, were 
also the only provisions at issue in this part of Harris. (Bermingham, Legal Aspects of Petroleum Marketing Under Federal and 
California Laws (1960) 7 UCLA L.Rev. 161, 246-247.) None of the cited passages persuades us to MECA's view of section 
17045. "
1265,10," In its brief, MECA also contends certain allegations in ABC's current and superseded complaints contradict and ""negate"" 
ABC's necessary allegations of competitive injury (at any level) and secrecy. The issues thus raised were not among those 
specified in the petition for review or the answer, and are not fairly included in them. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 29.3(c).) We 
decline to expand the scope of review. "
1266,11," Section 17200 defines ""unfair competition,"" for purposes of the code chapter that includes section 17203, to include any 
unlawful business act or practice. In its second cause of action, ABC alleged MECA's violation of section 17045 constituted 
unfair competition within this definition. HN10[
]"
1266,12," MECA also cites and provides the court with selected staff analyses, reports and letters accompanying the 1976 amendment 
of section 17203 by which the explicit authorization for restitutionary relief was added. None of them discuss the question before 
us, although the language of some reveals the authors' assumptions that restitution would be ancillary to an injunction. Whatever 
value these materials might have provided in resolving the present question evaporates upon examination of other reports, 
analyses and letters cited and provided by an amicus curiae supporting ABC's position--materials that, in some cases, reflect the 
opposite assumption as to the independence of restitution from injunctive relief, and in other cases neutrally describe the 
proposed amendments without making any such assumption. Neither set of legislative materials indicates the Legislature 
actually considered and resolved the question before us. (See California Teachers Assn. v. Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified 
School Dist. (1997) 14 Cal. 4th 627, 648 [59 Cal. Rptr. 2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175] [""we hesitate to accord much weight to an 
anonymous staff report that was merely summarizing the effect of a proposed bill""].) "
1267,13," In light of our conclusion, we need not address the question whether ABC should have been permitted to amend its complaint 
to seek an injunction. Nor do we address MECA's contention ABC has ""disguised"" a claim for damages as one for restitution. To 
the extent MECA's unelaborated assertion can be understood, it appears to dispute ABC's ability to prove MECA illegally 
enriched itself at ABC's expense, rather than the sufficiency of the complaint to state a cause of action. "
1271,1," Prior to its repeal in 1975 (Stats. 1975, ch. 402, p. 878), section 1 of the Fair Trade Act declared legal contract terms for the 
sale of ""commodit[ies]"" by which the buyer agreed not to resell ""except at the price stipulated by the vendor,"" and authorized "
1272,," buyers to require their buyers ""to agree that [they] will not, in turn, resell except at the price stipulated by such vendor or by such 
vendee."" (Stats. 1931, ch. 278, § 1, p. 583.) As Grether pointed out, ""The vertical nature of the rights under the [Fair Trade] [A]ct 
are clearly indicated by Section 2: 'This act shall not apply to any contract or agreement between producers or between 
wholesalers or between retailers as to sale or resale prices.' "" (Grether, supra, 24 Cal.L.Rev. at p. 641.)"
1272,2," Opinions from other jurisdictions with unfair competition statutes of the same provenance as the California act follow the 
horizontal interpretation we adopted in Harris, supra, 64 Cal. 2d 454, often relying on our opinion. In Beam v. Monsanto Co., Inc. 
(1976) 259 Ark. 253 [532 S.W.2d 175, 181-182], for example, the Arkansas Supreme Court wrote that ""It is apparent that the 
[Unfair Practices Act] is intended to foster competition for the primary benefit of the general public by protecting dealers . . . from 
unfair competition by large dealers. . . . Appellants' argument for 'vertical competition' would broaden the Act to not only protect 
dealers . . . from unfair competition by other dealers, but would also protect buyers from competition by [other] business buyers 
who use and purchase the same . . . product for use in their . . . businesses."" (See also Carlock v. Pillsbury (D.Minn. 1989) 719 "
1273,," F. Supp. 791, 849 [applying Harris to state-based unfair practices claim]; USA Petroleum Co. v. Atlantic Richfield Co. (C.D.Cal. 
1983) 577 F. Supp. 1296, 1307 [distinguishing Harris in a ""true"" horizontal case]; Chapiewsky v. G. Heilemann Brewing Co. 
(D.Wis. 1968) 297 F. Supp. 33, 41 [following Harris]; William Ingliss, etc. v. I.T.T. Continental Baking Co. (9th Cir. 1982) 668 
F.2d 1014 & William Inglis & Sons v. Continental Baking (9th Cir. 1991) 942 F.2d 1332 [relying on Harris as to state law claims]; 
Burge v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. (1981) 272 Ark. 67 [612 S.W.2d 108] [Arkansas Unfair Practices Act applies only 
horizontally]; Rose v. Vulcan Materials Co. (1973) 282 N.C. 643 [194 S.E.2d 521, 67 A.L.R.3d 1] [same].) This account of the scope of unfair practice provisions of other states differs, it is apparent, from the majority's evaluation. (Maj. 
opn., ante, at p. 1261, fn. 6.) The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals' gloss on the Arkansas act, cited by the majority, merely 
declares, without analysis or discussion, that it was passed in 1937 shortly after the Robinson-Patman Act, ""and was obviously 
designed to prohibit similar types of business conduct."" ( Ideal Plumbing Co. v. Benco, Inc. (8th Cir. 1976) 529 F.2d 972, 978, fn. 
7 [42 A.L.R.Fed. 266].) I am persuaded by the contrary reasoning and result of the Arkansas cases cited above interpreting that 
state's statute as ""horizontal."" The opinion of the Wyoming Supreme Court in State v. Langley (1938) 53 Wyo. 332 [84 P.2d 
767], also cited by the majority, involved a criminal prosecution under a statute prohibiting sales below cost; although a provision 
of the statute contains language similar to section 17001, the opinion is too obscure to stand for much, other than the statement 
that the provision prohibiting such sales ""was probably intended mainly for"" the independent merchant.  (84 P.2d at p. 774.) The 
price discrimination provision of the Wisconsin act, also cited by the majority, is almost identical to section 17045, and at least 
one Wisconsin appellate court has construed it as applying vertically. ( Jauquet Lumber v. Kolbe & Kolbe Millwork (1991) 164 
Wis.2d 689 [476 N.W.2d 305, 309].) As noted, however, the Arkansas statute, also modeled on the California provision (see 
McAllister, supra, 4 Law & Contemp. Probs. at p. 298, fn. 141), has received a contrary construction. "
1284,1," At oral argument, appellant's counsel argued that while Viacom's San Francisco and Marin systems are subject to regulation, 
they are not currently being regulated. However, the documents of which the trial court took judicial notice indicate that both the 
San Francisco and Marin systems are currently being regulated. The documents include two Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) opinions and orders resolving complaints about the prices respondent charged for cable programming 
service in Marin and in San Francisco."
1284,2," Even if section 543(b)(7) applies to nonregulated companies, as respondent contends, it would be error to focus on the 
enactment date of the statute as the trial court did in this case. Section 543(b) did not become effective until 180 days after its 
enactment. (See 47 U.S.C.A. § 543, Historical and Statutory Notes.)"
1284,3, The substance of this provision was also contained in the 1984 Cable Act. (See 47 U.S.C.A. § 543(b)(1).) 
1285,4," As noted above, during oral argument, appellants' counsel attempted for the first time to distinguish between companies that 
are regulated and companies that are subject to regulation. Whether this distinction is valid and relevant to the determination as 
to when respondent became subject to section 543(b)(7) (i.e., when it became subject to regulation or when it was actually 
regulated) is an issue the parties may address to the trial court, which has not yet had the opportunity to consider this matter. "
1288,5," Respondent contends it is irrelevant that enforcing the Cartwright Act in this context may actually further the purpose of the 
cable acts because the United States Supreme Court has held that ""an express preemption clause displaces all state laws that 
fall within its sphere, including consistent ones."" (Citing Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., supra, 504 U.S. at pp. 386-387 
[112 S. Ct. at pp. 2038-2039] (Morales).) But the preemption clause at issue in Morales, a provision of the Airline Deregulation 
Act of 1978 (ADA), is not comparable to section 543(a) of the cable acts. In contrast to section 543(a), the ADA preemption 
provision prohibited ""States from enforcing any law 'relating to rates, routes, or services."" (504 U.S. at pp. 378-379 [112 S. Ct. at 
p. 2034].) The Morales court held that the scope of this preemption clause was so wide that it preempted even consistent state 
laws which had a connection with or reference to airline rates, routes, or services. ( Id. at pp. 386-387 [112 S. Ct. at pp. 2038-
2039].) However, the court did not announce a general rule that all preemption clauses automatically preempt consistent state 
laws. The additional cases cited by counsel during oral argument are similarly unavailing because, among other things, they involve 
federal statutes which Congress clearly intended to have broad preemptive effects. (See San Diego Unions v. Garmon (1959) 
359 U.S. 236, 239 [79 S. Ct. 773, 776, 3 L. Ed. 2d 775] [National Labor Relations Act]; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. 
Massachusetts (1985) 471 U.S. 724, 739 [105 S. Ct. 2380, 2388-2389, 85 L. Ed. 2d 728] (Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act].)."
1288,6," Respondent's contention that section 27 cannot negate statutory provisions which expressly preempt appellants' claims begs 
the question. Our review of the relevant statutes and authority leads us to the conclusion that no statutory provision expressly 
preempts appellants' claims. Respondent's reliance on section 556(c) of the cable acts is also misplaced. Section 556(c) provides that state laws inconsistent 
with the acts are ""deemed to be preempted and superseded."" (47 U.S.C.A. § 556(c).) As our analysis illustrates, the Cartwright 
Act provisions at issue in the present case are not inconsistent with the cable acts. "
1290,7," The Doyle court did embrace the view that ""[t]he rate structure is a federal matter and state consumer laws that impact upon it 
conflict with the operation of the rate structure."" (Doyle, supra, 66 F.3d at p. 882.) However, we decline to take this statement out 
of the context in which it occurs. Indeed, the Doyle court expressly acknowledged the limitation of its holding by declining to 
disagree with Time Warner Entertainment Co., L.P. v. F.C.C., supra, 56 F.3d 151. In that case, the Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia held that the cable act did not preempt state and local negative option billing laws. ( Id. at p. 194.) Instead of 
disagreeing with the Time Warner court's analysis (an analysis consistent with our conclusion in the present case), the Doyle 
court simply found that it faced a different issue, i.e., ""whether the FCC regulation specifically preempts the enforcement of state 
negative option billing laws in the narrow situation of relatively minor adjustments in programming."" (Doyle, supra, 66 F.3d at p. 
880, fn. 17.) "

1297,3," Prior to January 1991, Norwest had a different policy with Voyager that contained additional endorsements. This policy is not 
relevant here. Roe also claims that Norwest imposed an additional charge for calculating his premium based on the outstanding 
principal balance rather than the sum of principal and interest. However, Norwest introduced undisputed evidence that no such 
charge was made to Roe's account because the charge applies only to simple-interest accounts, which Roe's was not."
1297,4," Roe argues that Norwest has raised this issue for the first time on appeal. This assertion is patently untrue. See Report and 
Recommendation of Dec. 21, 1995, at 4 (""Defendant makes a compelling argument that [the charges] are not interest for any 
purpose.""). "
1299,5," The opinions in the Kenty case express different views of the collateral protection insurance in that case. On a motion to 
dismiss, the district court held that insurance charges that were ""unauthorized and unnecessary to protect the collateral"" could 
be considered interest on the loan. See Kenty v. Bank One, Columbus, N.A., 1992 WL 170605, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 23, 1992). 
At the summary judgment stage, however, the court concluded that state law imposed no maximum on the allowable interest 
rate, so that it did not matter whether any portion of the insurance charges was considered interest. See Kenty v. Bank One, 
Columbus, N.A., 1993 WL 592532, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Oct. 25, 1993). The Sixth Circuit saw Kenty's argument slightly differently, 
believing Kenty was complaining about the bank's charging interest on the insurance charges. That court concluded that the 
insurance premiums were themselves loans, and so state law permitted the bank to charge any amount of interest on the 
premiums. See 92 F.3d at 393. None of these opinions addresses the Comptroller's interpretation of § 85."
1299,6," At times in his brief and at oral argument, counsel for Roe seemed to be challenging a third endorsement, entitled ""Automatic 
Coverage,"" which covers collateral retroactively to the date on which the borrower's own insurance lapsed. We see no reason to 
treat this endorsement any differently from the others, as it also merely replicates the coverage Roe was contractually obligated 
to provide. "
1301,7," We disagree with trial court decisions from within our Circuit opining that a tie is a per se violation of § 1972. See JST 
Properties v. First Nat'l Bank, 701 F. Supp. 1443, 1449 (D. Minn. 1988); Sharkey v. Security Bank & Trust Co., 651 F. Supp. 
1231, 1232 (D. Minn. 1987). "
1302,8," Despite the apparent agreement of the parties to the contrary, the application of the McCarran-Ferguson Act in this case does 
not require a specific conclusion that the allegedly improper activities of Voyager constituted the ""business of insurance."" Fabe 
recognizes that the three-part test of Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U.S. 119, 129, 73 L. Ed. 2d 647, 102 S. Ct. 3002 
(1982), for determining whether a particular practice constitutes the business of insurance is relevant only in cases involving a 
conflict between state law and federal antitrust law, a conflict which is the subject of a separate provision of the McCarran-
Ferguson Act. See Fabe, 508 U.S. at 504-05."
1302,9," Roe argues that our opinion in First Nat'l Bank v. Taylor, 907 F.2d 775 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 972, 112 L. Ed. 2d 425, 
111 S. Ct. 442 (1990), holds that the McCarran-Ferguson Act is inapplicable to a national bank, and that because he alleges that 
Voyager was acting as the agent of a national bank, the Act cannot apply here. We believe Roe misreads that case, which relies 
on the conclusion that the bank was specifically authorized by the National Bank Act to undertake the insurance-like activity that 
was the subject of the case. See Taylor, 907 F.2d at 778-79. In any event, Voyager is an insurance company and is subject to 
Minnesota's laws regulating insurance companies; that it may have been working on behalf of a bank adds nothing to this 
analysis."
1302,10," Evidence in the record on appeal suggests that the actual goings-on were quite different. Norwest contracts with G.D. Van 
Wagenen Company, which is not a party here, to administer the collateral protection program by verifying whether borrowers 
have provided proof of insurance and sending notices to borrowers about Norwest's right to purchase insurance to protect its 
collateral. Van Wagenen is also a Voyager agent and is authorized to place insurance with Voyager when Norwest purchases it. 
An affiliate of Norwest, Norwest Insurance, Inc., which is also not a party to this suit, serves as the broker for the purchase of the 
insurance and receives commissions from Voyager on the premiums. Nevertheless, for purposes of this motion to dismiss, we 
must accept Roe's allegations as true. "
1303,11," Although Murff contains language suggesting that impairment will exist only in the case of a direct conflict between state and 
federal law, that language is certainly dictum in light of the Court's conclusion that application of the ADEA would have a de 
minimis effect, at most, on the insolvency proceedings. See Murff, 97 F.3d at 292 (citing Missouri statute giving policyholders 
priority over claims of employees). In addition, the ADEA, like the federal securities laws, is designed to protect parties other 
than policyholders. Murff therefore fits well within the framework of National Securities, see 393 U.S. at 463, and does not 
control here. "
1308,1," Handgards, inc. v. Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 986, 995 (9th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1025, 62 L. Ed. 2d 659, 100 S. Ct.

1308,4, 12 F.3d 155 (9th Cir. 1993). 
1318,1," The Court has also ruled on several motions in limine to exclude expert testimony. The expert testimony at issue in those 
motions is only relied upon by this Court in deciding ARCO's Summary Judgment Motion to the extent that testimony was 
deemed admissible in this Court's previous rulings."
1318,2," This factual background is a condensed version of the extensive background given in Rebel Oil Co. Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield 
Co., (""Rebel I"") 51 F.3d 1421 (9th Cir.), cert. denied,     U.S.    , 116 S. Ct. 515, 133 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1995). "
1320,3," ARCO alleges that Matsushita creates a new summary judgment standard for antitrust plaintiffs, one in which if circumstantial 
evidence is as consistent with competition as with conspiracy, plaintiffs must come forth with additional evidence. However, 
Matsushita addressed a Sherman Act § 1 conspiracy, not a Robinson-Patman Act case. Therefore, this Court analyzes Rebel's 
claim under the traditional summary judgment standard in light of the principles of the Matsushita decision."
1320,4," Rebel's misinterpretation of the Ninth Circuit's holding in Rebel I is illustrated by Rebel's argument that the Ninth Circuit found 
that ""Rebel's evidence is sufficient . . . to raise a disputed question of material fact"" precluding summary judgment. What the 
Ninth Circuit in fact found was that ""Rebel's evidence is sufficient . . . to raise a disputed question of material fact as to whether 
ARCO achieved sufficient market power to enforce supra competitive oligopoly pricing."" (emphasis added). "
1321,5," In fact, in Rebel I, this Court limited discovery solely to the issue of whether ARCO had sufficient market power to charge prices 
above competitive levels.  Rebel I, 51 F.3d at 1232. No discovery was conducted on predatory pricing, intent and collusion. Id."
1321,6," In Rebel I, the court noted the relationship between the wholesale and retail markets in Rebel's claim. The court found that 
where sufficient retail outlets exist, a defendant must control output at the wholesale level to pose any real threat of 
monopolizing the retail market. The court stated, ""In essence, Rebel must show that ARCO had monopoly power, or was 
dangerously close to achieving it, at the wholesale supply level."" 51 F.3d at 1442. The court then went on to find that Rebel had 
sufficient market power to sustain its price discrimination claim.  Id. at 1448."
1321,7," Below cost pricing was not an issue before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Rebel I, and no substantial discovery on 
ARCO's costs had taken place at the time of the Ninth Circuit's ruling. Upon remand, extensive discovery has occurred, and 
substantial new evidence concerning costs is before this Court. Therefore, even if Rebel I was law of the case as to below cost 
pricing, an exception to law of the case doctrine applies. "
1322,8," HN12[
] A primary line price discrimination claim exists when the price differential is between geographical markets, as 
opposed to price discrimination between two purchasers.  Rebel I, 51 F.3d at 1445. "
1323,9," At trial, Rebel would bear the burden of showing that the time period from which damages are calculated is similar to the 
predatory pricing period but for the impact of the anticompetitive conduct.  Inglis II, 942 F.2d at 1340-41. ARCO has merely 
alleged that Rebel has failed to show the periods were similar, but ARCO has offered no evidence that the two time periods or 
that the Los Angeles/Las Vegas markets are dissimilar. Since all inferences must be taken in Rebel's favor, summary judgment 
is inappropriate on this issue. "
1324,10," In Rebel I, the court addressed only antitrust injury under the Robinson-Patman Act. The court found that Rebel must prove 
that ARCO had a degree of market power to threaten oligopolization, not monopolization, which is the requirement under the 
Sherman Act. 51 F.3d at 1447."
1324,11," HN17[
] Marginal cost is the cost a firm incurs in the production of one additional unit of output. Rebel I, 51 F.3d at 1431. Average variable cost measures costs which vary with output, and is a generally accepted substitute for marginal cost in antitrust 
cases. Average total cost (""ATC"") is an average of variable costs and fixed costs."
1324,12," In Universal Analytics, the court found that the plaintiff's predatory pricing claims failed as a matter of law because there was 
no indication that the defendant set prices below its marginal or average variable cost.  707 F. Supp. at 1179. "
1325,13," All of the presumptions are rebuttable by a showing of predatory or nonpredatory purpose.  In re Air Passenger Comp. Res. 
Sys. Antitrust Litigation, 694 F. Supp. 1443, 1464 (C.D. Cal. 1988)."
1325,14," In Transamerica, the court noted situations in which prices above ATC would be illegal. First, a monopolist cannot set prices 
above ATC but below the short-term profit-maximizing level so as to discourage new entrants and maximize profits over the long 
run (""limit pricing"").  698 F.2d at 1387. While it may be difficult in many instances to asses the long-run consequences of these 
policies, where these difficulties can be overcome, plaintiffs should be allowed to prove these violations exist. Id. The court was 
hesitant to create a ""free zone"" in which monopolists can exploit their power without fear of legal scrutiny. ""A rule based 
exclusively on cost forecloses consideration of other important factors, such as intent, market power, market structure, and long-
run behavior in evaluating the predatory impact of a pricing decision."" Id."
1325,15," The Supreme court in Cargill, 479 U.S. at 117 n. 12, declined to determine whether above-cost pricing coupled with predatory 
intent is ever sufficient to state a claim of predation. "
1326,16," Courts have held that similar ""swaps"" are trades, not sales, and therefore not subject to attack under the Robinson-Patman 
Act. See Airweld, Inc., v. Airco, Inc., 576 F. Supp. 676, 679 (D. Or. 1983). "
1327,17," Rebel cites Areeda and Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, Vol. III (Revised Edition 1996). On pages 378-79, the authors discuss 
Rebel I, and state that if ARCO was unable to supply its own refineries, and purchased more gasoline from independent 
suppliers, this would measure marginal cost. If ARCO paid more than it charged upon resale, its price would be below marginal 
cost. However, the central concern regarding the Tosco agreement is that Rebel has not alleged ARCO purchased gas or 
incurred any direct cost in obtaining the gasoline. As Rebel's expert Dr. Leffler (""Leffler"") admits, ARCO did not purchase 
additional barrels of gasoline, so there was no ""cost"" to ARCO in terms of a purchase price. Rebel evaluates ARCO's cost solely 
by the market price of oil. Leffler states that the marginal cost to ARCO is the market price of oil, whether ARCO purchased, 
exchanged, or was given the oil. Thus, Areeda and Hovenkamp's analysis, which may apply if ARCO purchased the gasoline, is 
inapplicable when Rebel values of the exchange solely on the prevailing market price of oil. "
1328,18," Rebel alleges that ARCO's price in Los Angeles was below its Las Vegas price during the period of recoupment. This has no 
bearing on whether ARCO charged below cost prices during the predatory period. These are two different requirements under 
an antitrust claim."
1328,19," According to economic theory, in a perfectly competitive market, a firm's price is equal to its marginal cost."
1328,20," Holcombe is qualified to testify as an expert in the petroleum industry, but is not qualified to testify as an economic expert. 
However, for purposes of addressing the PSI method of determining ARCO's costs, this Court will assume Holcombe's 
testimony is admissible. "
1335,1," In their Memorandum in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint, the Hospital and the Consortium note 
that since the Noerr-Pennington defense has been fully briefed in Defendant AMR's motion to dismiss, the Hospital and the 
Consortium did not feel it was necessary to file a motion to dismiss of their own. Apparently, the Hospital and the Consortium are 
relying on their affirmative defense as the sole basis for dismissing the action against them. "
1336,2," The complaint does not explain why the alleged agreement not to use wheelchair vans as a lower cost alternative to 
ambulance services threatened Better Health's business."
1336,3," The members of the Consortium are AMR, the Hospital, and 13 emergency rescue squads."
1336,4, The Complaint is silent as to the other two County defendants -- Northampton County and Warren County.
1336,5," N.C.G.S. § 153A-250 provides, in relevant part, as follows: HN1[
] (a) [a] county may by ordinance franchise ambulance services provided in the county to the public at large, 
whether the service is based inside or outside the county. The ordinance may: (1) Grant franchises to ambulance operators on terms set by the board of commissioners; (2) Make it unlawful to provide ambulance services or to operate an ambulance in the county without such a franchise; (3) Limit the number of ambulances that may be operated within the county; (4) Limit the number of ambulances that may be operated by each franchised operator; (5) Determine the areas of the county that may be served by each franchised operator; (6) Establish and from time to time revise a schedule of rates, fees, and charges that may be charged by franchised 
operators; . . . (8) Establish other necessary regulations consistent with and supplementary to any statute or any Department of 
Human Resources regulation relating to ambulance services. . . . If a person, firm, or corporation is providing ambulance services in a county or any portion thereof on the effective date of 
an ordinance adopted pursuant to this subsection, the person, firm, or corporation is entitled to a franchise to continue to 
serve that part of the county in which the service is being provided. The board of commissioners shall determine whether 
the person, firm, or corporation so entitled to a franchise is in compliance with Chapter 130, Article 26 [now § 131E-155, et 
seq.]; and if that is the case, the board shall grant the franchise. "
1337,6," HN2[
] N.C.G.S. § 153A-250(a) provides that ""if a person, firm, or corporation is providing ambulance services in a county or any portion thereof on the effective date of an [ambulance franchise] ordinance adopted pursuant to this section, the person, 
firm, or corporation is entitled to a franchise to continue to serve that part of the county in which the service is being provided. 
The board of commissioners shall determine whether the person, firm, or corporation so entitled to a franchise is in compliance 
with Chapter 130, Article 126 [now § 131E-155, et seq.]; and if that is the case, the board shall grant the franchise. "
1338,7," On occasion, for the sake of simplicity, this Court will refer to the three nongovernmental defendants, collectively, as simply the 
Consortium, since both the Hospital and AMR are members of the Consortium, and since all three nongovernmental 
defendants have raised the same defense. "
1340,8," Whether or not the Counties had the authority, under North Carolina's ambulance franchise statute, to grant the Consortium 
complete discretion to divide up the market for ambulance services, will only become relevant when this Court considers the 
Counties' claims of immunity under the state action doctrine, the applicability of which depends on the Counties having 
implemented state policy."
1340,9," The first claim for relief is against all defendants, including the nongovernmental defendants, for an alleged violation of § 1 of 
the Sherman Act; the second claim for relief is against the Consortium and AMR, for an alleged violation of § 2 of the Sherman 
Act; and the third claim for relief is against the Hospital, for an alleged violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. "
1341,10," HN7[
] § 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in relevant part, that ""every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States . . . is hereby declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1 HN8[
] § 2 of the Sherman Act provides, in relevant part, that ""every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several 
states . . . shall be deemed guilty of a felony."" 15 U.S.C. § 2 "
1343,11," When Halifax County issued its ambulance franchise Ordinance, on July 10, 1995, the state regulations concerning the 
provision of ambulance services were set forth in N.C.G.S. Chapter 130, Article 26, which was repealed on November 1, 1995, 
and can now be found in N.C.G.S. § 131E-155 et seq."
1343,12," The complaint also conspicuously fails to allege any governmental action whatsoever on the part of Northampton and Warren 
Counties, both of whom are named as defendants. The only ambulance franchise Ordinance mentioned in the complaint was 
passed by Halifax County. Apparently, Plaintiff expects this Court to assume that after the Consortium conspired with the 
Commissioners of Northampton County, and with the Commissioners of Warren County, to shut Plaintiff out of the relevant 
market in those two counties, the Consortium's monopoly in Northampton and Warren Counties spontaneously came into 
existence, and with such force, that Plaintiff's business was instantly obliterated as a result. This Court will make no such 
assumption. Plaintiff's failure to allege any governmental action by Northampton and Warren counties is a sufficient basis in itself 
for dismissing the federal antitrust claim against them. "
1345,13," Since the Consortium and the Hospital only raised the Noerr-Pennington doctrine as an affirmative defense, and did not file 
motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court, sua sponte, dismisses the action against them. "
1368,1," In 1967, the Bar Review Institute, Inc. (""BRI"") bar review course was founded in Illinois by Richard Conviser and others. In the 
early 1970s, Bay Area Review, Inc. (""BAR"") offered a bar review course in California. In 1974, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 
acquired BAR and BRI. BAR and BRI merged into Harcourt and began doing business under the trade name ""BAR/BRI."" By 
1974, BAR and BRI were offering full service bar review courses in various jurisdictions. BRI was offering full service bar review "
1369,," courses in Illinois, Arizona, Colorado, Washington D.C., Georgia, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Maryland (as 
a joint venture). BAR was offering full service bar review courses in California and other Western states. BAR and BRI, as part of 
a joint venture, began offering a bar review course in New York in 1973 under the name BAR/BRI. "
1370,2," American alleged that Harcourt intended to monopolize the full service bar review market of those states in which it possesses 
monopoly power. BAR/BRI allegedly enjoyed a complete monopoly or control, either by itself or through an affiliation, of over 
70% of the full service bar review markets in Georgia, Minnesota, Alabama, Nevada, Hawaii, North Carolina, Colorado, 
Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, South Carolina, Wyoming, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In those states where it 
has substantial competition, Harcourt allegedly has pursued a policy of offering students substantial discounts from the price 
which they would pay for a full service bar review course if they contracted for the course at a time early in their education. "
1373,3," American argues that the district court ignored the jury's award of $ 110,000 (before trebling) of damages specifically arising 
from Harcourt's monopoly attempt in New York. American claims that the trial evidence established that it was forced to abandon 
plans to offer its Barpassers course in New York as a result of Harcourt's alleged anti-competitive conduct in California. Because 
Harcourt is not liable for attempted monopolization in California and American failed to prove evidence on its New York claim, 
American's argument is unavailing."
1373,4," Harcourt also cross-appeals various evidentiary rulings at trial. In light of our decision to affirm the JMOL, we need not rule on 
those contentions. "
1379,1," The members of the Credential Committee were Donald Garrett, M.D., Allen Aycock, M.D., John Carter, M.D., and Rex 
Stockard, M.D."
1379,2," The members of the Hearing Panel were Robert Hillis, M.D., Ron Cagle, M.D., and Ron Woodson, M.D."
1379,3," The members of the Board of Trustees are Donald S. Bentley, Shon Erwin, Mary Louise Lawson, Herb Stonehocker and 
Urbane Skinner. "
1380,4," In conformity with Local Rule 56.1(b), defendants began their brief with ""a concise statement of material facts to which the 
moving party contends no genuine issue of fact exists."" In his response brief, plaintiff did not specifically dispute any of the 
material facts presented by defendants. Local Rule 56.1(c) provides that ""all material facts set forth in the statement of the 
movant shall be deemed admitted for the purpose of summary judgment unless specifically controverted by the statement of 
material facts of the opposing party."" In accordance with Local Rule 56.1(c), defendants' statement of material facts is deemed 
admitted."
1380,5," Four of the patients had been treated by plaintiff, while the fifth had been treated by Fahey. With respect to Fahey's patient, 
Griffin found that ""the operation was performed in a capable fashion."" Exhibit 31 to Defendants' Motion at 3. "
1381,6," It should be noted that while Donald Garrett was a member of the Credentials Committee, he was not present at the May 16, 
1994 meeting when the recommendation was made to revoke plaintiff's privileges. Exhibit 4 to Defendants' Motion at P 3. As a 
result, he did not vote on the motion to revoke plaintiff's privileges. Id. "
1382,7," Because the Complaint uses imprecise language, it is not clear whether the antitrust claims are asserted against any other 
defendants. "
1383,8," Defendants contend that the Health Care Act provides ""absolute immunity from Federal and State law private civil liabilities."" 
Defendants' Motion at 21 (emphasis in original). This statement is incorrect. The Health Care Act provides only a qualified 
immunity from damages. See Brown v. Presbyterian Healthcare Services, 101 F.3d 1324, 1334 n.9 (10th Cir. 1996). "
1385,9," It is not clear to the court whether plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief is still viable. In his Complaint, plaintiff sought injunctive 
relief because ""if such actions and practices of the Defendant continue, Plaintiff may be forced to terminate his practice in the 
Lawton area. . . ."" Complaint at P 30. It is undisputed that plaintiff did, indeed, move from the Lawton area in 1996 and now 
practices in Idabel, Oklahoma. Exhibit 18 to Defendants' Motion at 27-29."
1385,10," Plaintiff does refer to a ""price fixing conspiracy"" in his Complaint, but there are no factual allegations regarding such a 
conspiracy. Complaint at P 23. "
1386,11," See Exhibit 37 to Defendants' Motion at 37 (""Appointment to the medical staff is a privilege which shall be extended only to 
professionally competent individuals who continuously meet the qualifications, standards and requirements set forth in this policy 
and in such policies as are adopted from time to time by the Board."") (emphasis added); at 39 (""Continued appointment after the 
[six month] provisional period shall be conditioned on an evaluation of the factors to be considered for reappointment.""); and at 
62 (""Reappointment, if granted by the Board, shall be for a period of not more than two years . . . ."")."
1386,12," In his brief in response to defendants' motion, plaintiff complains that he: "
1387,," was given no opportunity to present reasons before the Credential's (sic) Committee why the proposed action should not be 
taken. Plaintiff had no right to call witnesses before such Committee. Dr. Le Baud had no opportunity to know the evidence against him at that time. Since no evidence was presented, he had no opportunity to have the Credential's (sic) Committee's decision based solely 
on the evidence presented. He had no ability to question or cross-examine evidence or witnesses before such Committee. Because the Credential's (sic) Committee took action without even a minimal hearing and with none of the safeguards 
normally associated with due process, there was no opportunity for any meaningful review of the Committee's decision. Plaintiff's Answer at 36."
1387,13," Plaintiff was clearly apprised of this fact at the hearing when counsel for the Credentials Committee stressed, ""We have to 
remember that it's the board that grants or revokes staff privileges. It's not the credentials committee. It's not this hearing panel. 
It is only the board that can take that action."" Hrg. Tr. at 5."
1387,14," Although plaintiff's surgical privileges were summarily suspended without a hearing, no due process violation occurred as ""not 
even an informal hearing . . . must precede a deprivation undertaken to protect the public safety."" Caine v. Hardy, 943 F.2d 
1406, 1412 (5th Cir. 1991) (en banc), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 936, 112 S. Ct. 1474, 117 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1992). It is undisputed 
that Smith and Curry suspended plaintiff's surgical privileges only after receiving the unfavorable oral report from Kan and 
Lippman and determining that plaintiff was scheduled to perform surgery on a child the following Monday. In this case the need 
for quick action was followed by an adequate post-deprivation remedy in the form of the hearing before the Hearing Panel. The 
court finds the analysis of the en banc Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a strikingly similar case to be persuasive. See 
Caine, 943 F.2d at 1411-15. Under the balancing test enunciated in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18, 96 
S. Ct. 893 (1976), plaintiff received all the process he was due."

side of the story.'"" Benavidez v. City of Albuquerque, 101 F.3d 620, 627 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 546)."
1387,16," Plaintiff's argument that his due process rights were violated because the burden of proof was unfairly placed on him at the 
Hearing Panel is without merit. Plaintiff received extensive predeprivation process, including the ability to confront and to cross-
examine witnesses, to present evidence and to state his position both orally and in writing. To the extent any burden was placed 
on plaintiff during the hearing, it does not rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation. See Benavidez, 101 F.3d at 626-28. "
1388,17," Plaintiff cannot assert a libel claim against Curry based on the reports sent to the National Practitioners Data Bank because 
such reports are privileged pursuant to the Health Care Act. See, supra, at 13."

1405,3," The Supreme Court has explained that the doctrine of antitrust standing demands a showing of more than the constitutional 
standing requirement of injury in fact; a plaintiff must also demonstrate that it is the proper party to bring a private antitrust 
action.  Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535 n.31, 74 L. Ed. 2d 
723, 103 S. Ct. 897 (1983). In suits for damages, courts may assess several factors in an antitrust standing analysis: (1) the 
nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury (i.e., whether the plaintiff can prove antitrust injury); (2) the directness of the injury; (3) the 
speculative measure of the harm; (4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and (5) the complexity in apportioning damages.  T.O. Bell, 
847 F.2d at 1183 (construing Associated Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. 519). HN6[
] The Supreme Court, however, has 
distinguished the standing analysis for injunctive relief under Section 16 by explaining that some of the factors (other than 
antitrust injury) that are appropriate to a determination of standing in an action for damages are not relevant in an action for 
injunctive relief. Such irrelevant factors would include the threat of multiple lawsuits or duplicative recoveries.  Cargill, 479 U.S.

] In broad terms, a horizontal merger occurs when the merging firms are in the same product and geographic market. 
1984 DOJ Merger Guidelines § 3.0, reprinted in ANTITRUST LAWS AND TRADE REGULATION PRIMARY SOURCE 
PAMPHLET (Matthew Bender 1996) [hereinafter PRIMARY SOURCE]. The basic economic reason for limiting horizontal 
mergers is the generally accepted theory that horizontal mergers increase market concentration, which, in turn, can substantially 
lessen competition among rivals, particularly with respect to price. 4 PHILLIP AREEDA & DONALD R. TURNER, ANTITRUST 
LAW P 1000a (1980). In contrast, HN9[
] a vertical merger joins companies that share a supplier-customer relationship.  Brown Shoe v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 323, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962). Unlike horizontal mergers, vertical arrangements do not 
inherently remove an independent competitor from the market. 2A PHILLIP AREEDA, HERBERT HOVENKAMP & JOHN L. 
SOLOW, ANTITRUST LAW P 570a (1995). Vertical integration may be ""upstream"" (when a firm produces supplies or 
component materials that could have been supplied by independent producers) or ""downstream"" (when a firm processes or 
distributes products that could have been sold to independent producers or distributors). 3 AREEDA & TURNER, supra, at P 
723. HN10[
] Whereas horizontal mergers are commonly analyzed in terms of market concentration, there is no comparable 
theoretical basis for evaluating the anticompetitive effects of a vertical merger. This is because firms that merge vertically are 
engaged in different product markets; thus, a simple vertical merger neither combines market concentrations nor increases the 
market power of the merging entities. 4 id. at P 1000(a). Courts therefore evaluate the anticompetitive effects of a vertical 
merger in terms of other structural consequences or economic barriers such as whether the merger ""forecloses"" competitors of 
the merging entities from a source of supply that would otherwise be open to them. Id.; see also Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 324. "
1407,5," Multispecialty physician clinics have been described as an alternative to the traditional, single specialty practices offered by 
members of a medical staff. In general, multispecialty clinics are designed to provide ""one-stop shopping"" for various medical 
specialties and are intended to be a cost-effective means of health care delivery. They may also provide extended hours, house 
calls and other patient benefits. See Remarks of Mary Lou Steptoe, Acting Director FTC Bureau of Competition, delivered 4/5/95 
to ABA Antitrust Section, reprinted in 1995 WL 150724 (F.T.C.). "
1410,6," For example, it is not entirely clear (logically speaking) why pediatricians should be considered a submarket of primary care but 
ob/gyns are not. Neither party has proposed this seemingly plausible, parallel submarket structure nor introduced evidence to 
support it."
1410,7," HN14[
] DOJ's Antitrust Division has recognized that general surgery services are ordinarily considered a separate product 
market. See DOJ Business Review Letter, 1996 WL 285712 (D.O.J.), at n.1 (March 19, 1996)."

services"" as the relevant product market. E.g., Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 357 (products and services constituting 
commercial banking were sufficiently inclusive to be deemed a distinct line of commerce). The reliability of using a cluster of services approach in evaluating hospital mergers has been called into question recently by the 
court in F.T.C. v. Butterworth Health Corp., 946 F. Supp. 1285, 1996 WL 570479 (W.D. Mich. 1996). In light of the evolving 
and increasingly complex health care services market, the Butterworth court expressed a concern that the cluster approach 
might lead to distorted results. Id. at *19 n.5. "
1412,10," As used in the managed care industry, Pitts defined ""provider"" to mean anyone who delivers health care services such as 
physicians, hospitals, home health agencies and emergency service companies. Perhaps most frequently, the term is used in 
reference to physicians. A ""network of providers"" refers to the total health care delivery system constructed by the managed care 
company and offered to its customers. The network is comprised of all health care providers who have contracted with the 
managed care company to provide health care services. (Trial Tr. at 270-71.)"

] The Elzinga-Hogarty (""E-H"") test is a well-known tool of economists that was devised by Professor Kenneth B. 
Elzinga of the University of Virginia and Thomas F. Hogarty, formerly professor of economics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and 
State University. Kenneth G. Elzinga & Thomas F. Hogarty, The Problem of Geographic Market Delineation in Antimerger Suits, 
18 ANTITRUST BULL. 45 (1973) [hereinafter Elzinga & Hogarty, Market Delineation]; Kenneth G. Elzinga & Thomas F. Hogarty, 
The Problem of Geographic Market Delineation Revisited: the Case of Coal, 23 ANTITRUST BULL. 1 (1978) [hereinafter Elzinga 
& Hogarty, Market Delineation Revisited]. In a merger setting, the purpose of the E-H test is to analyze patterns of consumer 
origin and destination and then to use that information to identify geographically the relevant competitors of the merging firms.  
F.T.C. v. Freeman Hosp., 69 F.3d 260, 264-65 (8th Cir. 1995); United States v. Rockford Memorial Corp., 717 F. Supp. 1251, 
1266 (N.D.Ill. 1989), aff'd 898 F.2d 1278 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 920, 112 L. Ed. 2d 249, 111 S. Ct. 295 (1990). As 
explained by Professor Elzinga, a geographic market is an area where there are (1) relatively few imports of the product (little 
comes in from the outside or LIFO); and (2) few exports of the product (little goes out from the inside or ""LOFI""). Kenneth G. 
Elzinga, Defining Geographic Market Boundaries, 26 ANTITRUST BULL. 739, 742 (1981) [hereinafter Elzinga, Market 
Boundaries]. At trial, Dr. Eisenstadt explained in basic terms that the E-H test is a matter of looking at how many people leave an 
area to get services (outflow) and how many people come into an area to get services (inflow). (Trial Tr. at 2064-66.) Both inflow 
and outflow are important in determining how much prices would have to increase within that area before lost business would 
make the price increase unprofitable. (Id.) The methodology used in performing a traditional E-H analysis entails a minimum of four steps and employs two key 
calculations: LIFO and LOFI (defined above). Elzinga & Hogarty, Market Delineation I at 73-76 (outlining four-step process for "
1415,," estimating market size in terms of area and volume). The analysis begins by locating the larger of the merging firms and drawing 
a hypothetical market area around the firm. Professors Elzinga and Hogarty initially suggested that the analysis should begin by 
drawing the minimum geographic area necessary to account for 75% of product shipments from the merging firm. This 
hypothetical area would be redrawn or adjusted throughout the analysis to reflect the results of the LIFO and LOFI calculations. 
Id. at 73-74. They subsequently ratcheted upward the initial 75% benchmark. Elzinga & Hogarty, Market Delineation Revisited, 
supra, at 2; see discussion infra at note 15. To better illustrate the mechanics of the analysis, an economist studying a hospital merger would begin by drawing a 
hypothetical or provisional ""service area"" around the larger of the merging hospitals. The provisional service area would 
represent the economist's initial estimate of the basic area from which the merging hospital attracts its patients. Freeman Hosp., 
69 F.3d at 264. In order to pinpoint where patients reside, the economist would compile a record of patient zip codes from the 
hospitals' patient discharge data. Using patient zip codes, the economist could then study the patients who reside within the 
provisional service area to determine where those patients go for hospital services. If it is discovered that the patients who live 
within an area use hospitals outside of that area, the economist has a basis for concluding that the outlying hospitals will act as a 
check on the exercise of market power by the merging hospitals.  Id. at 264-65 & n.9; Rockford, 717 F. Supp. at 1266. Once satisfied with the hypothetical LIFO market, the economist would use zip code data to perform a LOFI measurement of the 
percentage of hospital patients who reside within the service area. This calculation assists the economist in determining whether 
a significant number of ""immigrating patients"" (i.e., patients who reside outside of the service area) travel into the service area 
for hospital care. If a large number of immigrating patients use hospitals located within the service area, the economist may 
conclude that outlying hospitals located nearer to the immigrating patients' residences could act as a check on the exercise of 
market power by the service area hospitals.  Rockford, 717 F. Supp. at 1266. In essence, LOFI measures patient immigration into the service area (or ""inflow"" in Dr. Eisenstadt's terminology), and LIFO 
measures patient outmigration (or ""outflow"").  Rockford, 717 F. Supp. at 1266-67. Although often used in merger studies, the E-H test is not without its critics. E.g., Elzinga & Hogarty, Market Delineation 
Revisited, supra, at 1-17; Elzinga, Market Boundaries, supra, at 739-52 (responding to Gregor y J. Werden's criticism of E-H test 
for, among other things, its focus on shipments data as the proper variable for estimating geographic market areas); see also 
Rockford, 717 F. Supp. at 1267 (court acknowledged general efficacy of the E-H test but criticized defendants' result-oriented 
application of the test). "
1416,14," Not only is there no record evidence to prove that patients willingly drive thirty-six mile distances irrespective of the direction 
traveled, but the theory itself defies logic. It seems much more logical to this Court that simple reasons such as highway 
conditions and the quality of the services available at the end of the road will effect a person's decision to drive or not to drive."
1416,15," The proper inclusion percentage or ""cutoff point"" is hotly debated among experts and generally falls, depending on the product 
involved, in the range of 75% (the benchmark initially endorsed by Professors Elzinga and Hogarty) to 90% (now accepted as 
indicating a ""strong market""). See discussion supra at note 13; Freeman Hosp., 69 F.3d at 264. In a physician services market, 
for example, this percentage is nothing more than the economist's determination of what portion of the patient population should 
be included in the service area in order to paint an accurate picture of the physicians' main patient base. It therefore defines ""the 
degree of inclusiveness of the service area, or the degree to which the area accounts for the physicians' business."" Freeman 
Hosp., 69 F.3d at 264 n.8. An inverse relationship thus develops: the lower the cutoff point, the higher the amount of patient 
business that is not included in the analysis. Despite this dichotomy, experts may favor a low cutoff point, if, for example, 
immigrating patients are not representative of the main patient base because they overwhelmingly seek specialized services. Id. "

cement.  Callaway Mills Co. v. F.T.C., 362 F.2d 435, 444 (5th Cir. 1966). In contrast, differentiated products are commonly 
associated with service sectors such as commercial banking or health care. A merger of differentiated product markets is said to "
1418,," occur when the products of the merging firms are close but not perfect substitutes. ANTITRUST ADVISER § 3.23 (Irving Scher 
ed. 1995). Because the entire notion of market share in the economist's competition model rests on the premise that all 
competing firms produce identical products, product differentiation presents an added wrinkle in estimating the anticompetitive 
consequences of a merger. HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ECONOMICS AND FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW § 11.6 (1985)."
1418,17," However, only three of the zip codes included in Mr. Oliver's 90% provisional hospital market for the Vicksburg area overlap 
with the relevant Methodist zip codes. (Exhibits DQ-616-17.) According to Mr. Oliver's analysis, the overlap (zip codes 39066, 
39180 and 39194) accounts for just 3.33% of Methodist's patients who receive the shared procedures."
1418,18," The Eighth Circuit in Freeman Hospital found that the FTC's prima facie case contained a fatal flaw because the agency failed 
""to present evidence addressing the critical issue of where consumers of acute care inpatient hospital services could practicably 
turn for alternative sources of the product should the … merger be consummated and … prices become anticompetitive."" 
Freeman Hosp., 69 F.3d at 268. The Court notes that, unlike the plaintiff in Freeman Hospital, Columbia addressed the issue of 
alternative sources at various times throughout this trial. (E.g., Trial Tr. at 103-04, 903, 1145-48; Exhibits PX-448-49.) The issue 
of alternative sources is further discussed at Part I.C.3.b.4. below. "
1419,19," The 70% figure represents market share calculated by office visits in the primary care geographic market that the Court 
accepted in Part I.C.2.a. above. That geographic market roughly consists of Warren County, Tallulah, Port Gibson, Hermanville, 
Pattison and Redwood. (Exhibit PX-419.) If the market were comprised solely of Warren County, Columbia claims that the 
market share based on office visits would rise to 92%. (Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at P 95.) Columbia concedes in its briefs that, if postmerger market share for primary care physician services is calculated by total primary 
care physician headcount rather than by patient office visits, the market share drops to 55% in the geographic market that the 
Court has accepted. (Id. at n.10.) "
1420,20," The Court observes that, even if Columbia had been able to prove undue market concentration in the pediatrics submarket, its 
recent and successful recruitment of Dr. Venters, a pediatrician and internist, would seriously undercut any claim that significant 
barriers to entry exist in the pediatrics market.  United States v. Syufy Enter., 903 F.2d 659, 664 (9th Cir. 1990) (a high market 
share will not raise an inference of monopoly power in a market with low entry barriers or other evidence of a defendant's 
inability to control prices or exclude competitors). "

costs, a single firm has declining average costs at the level of demand in the industry, such that the single firm can supply the 
service more cheaply than two firms could."" United Distribution Cos. v. F.E.R.C., 319 U.S. App. D.C. 42, 88 F.3d 1105, 1122 n. 4 
(D.C. Cir. 1996) (citing RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW § 12.1, at 343-45 (4th ed. 1992). One court

Reporting Co. v. Alderson Reporting Co., Inc., 763 F.2d 1020, 1023-24 (8th Cir. 1985). For example, a small town may not be able to support more than one movie house. 3 PHILLIP AREEDA & DONALD R. 
TURNER, ANTITRUST LAW P 621 (1978). In such a case, demand is too thin and monopoly is inevitable. Id. Where the 
character of the market makes monopoly inevitable, commentators have observed that it would be futile and a waste of judicial 
resources to hold such a monopoly unlawful. Id. Natural monopolies do not run afoul of the antitrust laws so long as the monopoly in question acquired and maintained its 
position by business acumen, superior quality or other honest means and did not exclude competitors improperly.  Nat'l 
Reporting, 763 F.2d at 1023-24; see also Marshfield Clinic, 65 F.3d at 1412-13. "
1422,22," For example, excerpted from Dr. Kuiper's cross-examination testimony is the following: … That's the whole point I'm trying to make. And as a clinician I've understood for years we are in competition with 
Jackson, absolutely. (Trial Tr. at 3074-75.) "
1424,23," By name, the primary care physicians included in this tally are: family practitioners Abraham, Barnes, Butler, Easterling, Ford, 
Johnston, McMillan and Stanley; internists Bouldin, Edney, Habeeb, Low, Pierce, Ross, Tribble and Williams; and pediatricians 
Roy, Sluis, Smith, Weiland and Weller. (Plaintiff's Response to Defs.' Proposed Findings of Fact at 7-8; Exhibit P-455.) Although 
the Court has found that Columbia failed to carry its burden of proof in the pediatrics submarket, the Court will nonetheless 
include pediatricians in its headcount of primary care physicians."
1424,24," The physician headcount at the Mission Clinic includes Drs. Chiarito, Giffin, Masterson, Sessums and, for the reasons given in 
Part I.C.3.a. above, Venters. Because the evidence indicated that Dr. Burford's partners have no expectation that she will return 
to practice, the Court has not included her in the physician headcount. (Trial Tr. at 93.) The remaining nine substitute primary care physicians according to Quorum are: in Port Gibson, Drs. Headley, Barnes, Marshall 
and Amork; and, in Tallulah, Drs. Newman, Newman, Shenier, Polquitt and Perry. (Exhibit DVC-395.)"
1424,25," Dr. Eisenstadt's supposition about Tallulah's and Port Gibson's limited primary care services is not corroborated by any 
specific record evidence, and the Court therefore views it as conjecture. See Freeman Hosp., 69 F.3d at 270-71 (district court 
did not err in refusing to credit plaintiff's testimony regarding limited quality and range of services in outlying hospitals where 
record lacked sufficient data and contained no formal analysis in support of such assertions). The Court found more creditworthy 
the testimony of Charles Pitts, CEO of United Health, who indicated that his company would have no qualitative problem with 
including physicians in outlying towns on its managed care panel; his only concern was proximity to Vicksburg. (Trial Tr. at 282.) 
Similarly, Rissa Richardson, another managed care witness, voiced no qualitative opposition to the primary care physicians in 
Port Gibson and Tallulah. Richardson noted that, if the Warren County Medicaid pilot project begins operations, participating 
Medicaid patients would be required to visit primary care physicians located within thirty minutes average travel time from the 
patient's residence. There is no reliable data in the record to prove that any potential Medicaid patient would be foreclosed from 
visiting a Port Gibson or Tallulah physician because of distance or travel time. "
1425,26," HN24[
] Antitrust case law exhibits a long-drawn-out battle over what percentage share of a given market is sufficient to 
demonstrate market power. E.g., Fineman v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 201-02 (3d Cir. 1992) (a plaintiff 
must show a ""significantly larger"" market share than 55% to establish a prima facie case of market power), cert. denied, 507 
U.S. 921, 122 L. Ed. 2d 677, 113 S. Ct. 1285 (1993); White Bag Co. v. Internat'l Paper Co., 579 F.2d 1384, 1387 (4th Cir. 1974) 
(defendant must control at least 70% of the relevant market to be subject to a monopolization charge); United States v. 
Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1945) (""[Over 90%] is enough to constitute a monopoly; it is doubtful 
whether sixty or sixty-four percent [60 or 64%] would be enough; and certainly thirty-three percent [33%] is not.""). 
Understandably, the Supreme Court has never defined ""undue percentage share"" in terms of a hard and fast numerical 
threshold.  Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. at 363 (merger that produces a firm controlling an ""undue percentage share of the 
relevant market, and results in a significant increase in the concentration of firms in that market, is inherently likely to lessen 
competition substantially); see ANTITRUST ADVISER § 3.21 (Irving Scher ed. 1995). Notably, since the Supreme Court 
rendered its decision in United States v. General Dynamics Corp., 415 U.S. 486, 39 L. Ed. 2d 530, 94 S. Ct. 1186 (1974), the 
emphasis in Section 7 merger cases has been to analyze carefully the likely harm to consumers, instead of accepting a firm's 
postmerger market share as conclusive proof of its market power.  United States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 285 U.S. App. D.C. 222, 
908 F.2d 981, 990-91 & n.12 (D.C.Cir. 1990). "
1426,27," The ""timely-likely-sufficient"" standard has its origins in the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission Horizontal 
Merger Guidelines (the ""Guidelines""). 1992 DOJ and FTC Horizontal Merger Guidelines § 3, reprinted in PRIMARY SOURCE, 
supra note 4. It is important to note that the Guidelines are not binding on the courts or the agencies.  Olin Corp. v. F.T.C., 986 
F.2d 1295, 1300 (9th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1110, 127 L. Ed. 2d 373, 114 S. Ct. 1051 (1994). At the heart of this standard is the theory that a ""merger is not likely to create or enhance market power or to facilitate its 
exercise, if entry into the market is so easy that market participants, after the merger, either collectively or unilaterally could not 
profitably maintain a price increase above premerger levels."" Guidelines § 3.0 (emphasis added). ""Easy"" entry is evaluated 
under the Guidelines by applying the timely-likely sufficient standard. Id. Essentially, to be ""timely,"" the new entrant must be able 
to enter the market and achieve a significant market impact within two years of the merger. Id. at § 3.2. To be ""likely,"" the entry 
must be profitable at premerger prices, and the new entrant must be able to obtain those prices. Id. at § 3.3. The final and 
strikingly circular step in the analysis states that an entry or multiple entries will be ""sufficient"" to deter or counteract 
anticompetitive postmerger effects whenever such entry passes muster under the ""likely"" test in section 3.3 of the Guidelines. Id. 
at § 3.4. Although both expert witnesses acknowledged the propriety of using the timely-likely-sufficient standard to evaluate market 
entry, they reached polar opposite conclusions regarding the existence of significant barriers to entry. Not surprisingly, Dr. 
Eisenstadt concluded that entry barriers were significant, but Mr. Oliver concluded that they were not. (Compare Trial Tr. at 
2168, 2171 with id. at 2626-27, 2849.) "
1427,28," Another nonantitrust concern that has dampened Columbia's recruitment prospects is the lack of additional physical space for 
any new physicians at the Mission Clinic. (Trial Tr. at 1659.) "
1429,29," Illustrative of the overly speculative nature of Columbia's theory is the following excerpt from Dr. Sessums's testimony on 
cross-examination: COUNSEL: You're not suggesting to us, are you, that Dr. Kuiper and his partners at the Vicksburg Clinic would make a 
decision based on their equity ownership in this hospital following the merger … to hospitalize and overrule their patients' 
preference because of this equity ownership? DR. SESSUMS: I don't know. I don't know. That requires a lot of speculation and things that I don't have any knowledge 
thereof. (Trial Tr. at 181.) Even more illuminating is the cross-examination testimony of William Patterson, Columbia's chief executive officer at VMC: COUNSEL: And so you would agree, would you not, that doctors then will bring patients to Vicksburg Medical Center even 
though they may have a financial interest in ParkView. PATTERSON: I think that that's -- that that's possible. (Id. at 1692.) "
1430,30," The Court is compelled to make a final observation regarding Columbia's financial incentive theory, which is prompted by 
William Patterson's response to a query from the bench: COURT: … Have you talked to any of the [Vicksburg Clinic doctors] about their willingness to continue to use your facility 
post-merger if the merger is allowed? PATTERSON: Well, I don't know that I've posed that question to them directly in that sort of way. No, sir, I really haven't 
asked that question. I always hoped that they would but never really made that direct inquiry as to what their plans would 
be in that regard. (Trial Tr. at 1721.) The Court is perplexed by this testimony. If Columbia's executive officer at VMC, who has a professional and, in some cases, 
social relationship with the Vicksburg Clinic physicians, has sought no direct knowledge of the physicians' postmerger plans 
(notwithstanding his apparent ability to do so), how can this Court accept, instead, mere assumptions about the physicians' 
possible actions?"
1430,31," Columbia's Section 2 conspiracy claim is not to be confused with a monopolization or attempted monopolization claim under 
that same statute. See statute reproduced supra note 2. Indeed, the claims of monopolization, attempt and conspiracy to 
monopolize under the Sherman Act are separate offenses that require distinct proofs. E.g., Joe Westbrook, Inc. v. Chrysler 
Corp., 419 F. Supp. 824, 844-45 (N.D.Ga. 1976) (see case citations therein). If the Section 2 allegation in this case were based 
on monopolization or attempted monopolization rather than conspiracy to monopolize, there could be no Sherman Act violation 
by virtue of the Court's prior findings with respect to the Clayton Act claims.  Syufy, 903 F.2d at 671 & n.21 (by finding that 
defendant lacked power to set prices or to exclude competition under the Clayton Act, district court also disposed of plaintiff's 
monopolization and attempted monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act). However, in a Section 2 conspiracy case, 
there is no need to consider monopoly power or market power in a relevant market.  United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 
218, 225-26, 91 L. Ed. 2010, 67 S. Ct. 1560 (1947), overruled on other grounds by Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube 
Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984); Joe Westbrook, 419 F. Supp. at 845. "
1431,32," In response to a question from the bench, Columbia executive Patterson testified: COURT: … What would the result be, as a practical matter, if you had been successful in your bid for the Vicksburg Clinic, 
which you were trying to acquire -- … -- and if you had also been successful in getting the Street Clinic in 1996, how would 
your situation then be different from the situation that the defendants in this suit are now trying to accomplish, insofar as 
Vicksburg and the patients are concerned? PATTERSON: I think our situation would be similar in nature, that we would be able to attract more patients, we would be 
able to attract more managed care contracts, we would have the competitive advantages that my competitor now sees by 
purchasing the Vicksburg Clinic. (Trial Tr. at 1602.)"
1431,33," Parkview Medical Corp.'s Private Placement Memorandum dated June 7, 1996 gives the following reasons for the merger: ParkView Corp.'s Reasons for the Merger The ultimate goal of the merger is to expand the current ParkView Corp. integrated delivery system to continue to provide 
health care services to central and western Mississippi and eastern Louisiana as well as to enhance recruiting abilities for 
additional subspecialties. … Integrated delivery systems have the potential to deliver patient care more efficiently. … Vicksburg Clinic's Reasons for the Merger … The main reasons were the force of competition from the Jackson-Metropolitan area market penetrating the Vicksburg 
market, the allowance of recruitment of specialty services to supplement various physicians' practices, the ability to utilize 
the highest quality of personnel which would be available for delivery of each medical service and the ability to reduce the 
cost of duplication of services. … (Exhibit PX-96 at 16.) "
1433,34," The Court notes that Columbia expressly excluded outpatient services from its definition of the relevant hospital services 
market in its Clayton and Sherman Act claims. (Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law P 119.) "
1435,35," As Dr. Hopson explained: I think the citizens will have more services in Vicksburg than they have ever had before if [the merger is] allowed to go 
through. I think they will have to travel less miles. I think they will actually have better medical care. (Trial Tr. at 2599.) "

Committee Report on S. 1185 make any mention of antitrust concerns. See 1978 U.S.S.C.A.N. at 4144. "
1445,7," See, e.g., Nat. Society of Professional Engineers v. U.S., 435 U.S. 679, 688, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978) (""read

1452,1," The grand jury also named another Japanese manufacturer, Jujo Paper Co., Ltd. (Jujo), as a codefendant. Two years earlier, 
however, NPI had been formed and, the government alleges, had assumed Jujo's assets and liabilities. Because the issue of 
successor liability is not before us, we treat NPI as if it were the sole defendant and as if it, rather than Jujo, were alleged to 
have committed the acts described in the indictment. "
1453,2," Inasmuch as we hold that activities committed abroad which have a substantial and intended effect within the United States 
may form the basis for a criminal prosecution under Section One of the Sherman Act, we need not address the government's 
alternative argument that the indictment in this case alleges that some overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were 
perpetrated in the United States. "
1454,3," As NPI reminds us, four Justices dissented in Hartford Fire. This is cold comfort, however, for the dissenters expressed 
complete agreement with the majority's view on extraterritoriality. See Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 814 (Scalia, J., dissenting). By 
the same token, NPI's attempt to distinguish Hartford Fire on the ground that the defendants there conceded the United States' 
jurisdiction over their conduct fails for two reasons. In the first place, the assertion is no more than a play on words. The majority opinion in Hartford Fire stated that the district court 
""undoubtedly"" had jurisdiction over the civil claims, ""as the London reinsurers apparently concede."" Id. at 795. It is obvious, 
therefore, that jurisdiction did not depend on the concession; to the contrary, jurisdiction would ""undoubtedly"" have existed in any 
event. In the second place, one of the London defendants did not join in this apparent concession, but the Court nonetheless 
held that defendant's foreign conduct to be within the Sherman Act's proscriptive ambit because it was part of a scheme which 
""was intended to and did in fact produce a substantial effect on the American insurance market."" Id. at 795 n.21. "
1456,4," Indeed, the Bowman Court stated that it regarded American Banana as an appropriate analogy because the antitrust statute ""is 
criminal as well as civil."" 260 U.S. at 98. This seems to support the notion that the presumption is the same in both instances 
and leaves little room to argue that the Bowman Court was attempting to craft a special, more rigorous rule for criminal 
proceedings. "
1457,5," We note in passing that, by their use of the disjunctive in this section, the drafters of the Restatement seem to suggest a more 
permissive standard then we, and other American courts, see, e.g., Alcoa, 148 F.2d at 444, would deem meet."
1457,6," Leaving aside the lower court's decision in this case, no reported opinion has questioned the applicability of Hartford Fire's 
exercise in statutory construction to the precincts patrolled by the criminal law. Nevertheless, Hartford Fire's rendition of the 
statute has drawn criticism from the academy. See, e.g., Kenneth W. Dam, Extraterritoriality in an Age of Globalization: The 
Hartford Fire Case, 1993 Sup. Ct. Rev. 289, 307-13 (1993). "

1462,11," While criminal prosecution may come as a surprise, NPI should have known that civil antitrust liability could include treble

U.S.C. § 2. Treble damages obviously do not include a similar cap. "
1466,1," Because regulation will presumably have been holding the firm's rates below the profit-maximizing level, the rate increases 
resulting from this artificial cost inflation will not reduce the firm's profit. Such rate increases presumably would reduce profit for

be resolved as a matter of law. "
1501,7," In resolving the standing issue, some courts have drawn the distinction between ""expansion of a present business into a new 
market"" and ""growth in an ongoing business."" Heatransfer Corp. v. Volkswagenwerk, A.G., 553 F.2d 964, 986 (5th Cir. 1977), 
cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1087, 55 L. Ed. 2d 792, 98 S. Ct. 1282 (1978). ""The line to be drawn between expansion into new areas 
and growth in established ones is not easily defined and one that must be determined from the facts of each case."" Id. Even if 
the court applied this standard and accepted Xerox's contention that CSU is truly expanding into a ""new"" area, the court still 
must address whether the ""new"" area is all domestic expansion or expansion into 16 different geographic areas. "
1502,8," For example, CSU has presented no direct evidence that it intended to enter the Charlotte, Louisville, Memphis, and Nashville 
markets. CSU took no affirmative steps towards expansion into these markets and has not yet expanded to any of these cities. 
According to CSU's damage calculation, CSU projected to expand to Louisville in April 1994, Memphis in August 1994, Atlanta in 
April 1995, Nashville in August 1995, and Charlotte in December 1995. CSU claims that it considered Charlotte, Louisville, 
Memphis, and Nashville as expansion candidates (as ""spoke"" cities) from its Atlanta hub office. CSU actually expanded to 
Atlanta in October 1995 but it has not expanded to any of the other four cities. CSU's actual practice of expansion appears to be 
inconsistent with its projected expansion dates for each market and CSU's ""hub and spoke"" theory of expansion. "
1510,1," Toys ""R"" Us, Inc. (""TRU"") and K Mart Corporation (""Kmart"") have settled their dispute with AMI and are no longer defendants in 
the action. AMI alleged other violations of the antitrust laws that were dismissed in an earlier Memorandum and Order of the 
Court. See Anti-Monopoly, Inc. v. Hasbro, Inc., 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16355, 1995 WL 380300 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)."
1510,2," Prior to the completion of discovery, Magistrate Judge Peck, who oversaw discovery in this action, stayed AMI's apparently 
onerous discovery requests relating to AMI's secondary-line Robinson-Patman Act claims to allow Hasbro to move before this 
Court for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss those claims. See Opinion and Order of Magistrate Judge Peck, dated March 6, 
1996. Because the Court grants Hasbro's motion, the issue of discovery relating to those claims is now moot. The remainder of 
discovery is complete."
1510,3," In addition to the above motions, AMI moves for summary judgment as to liability on certain of its antitrust claims and Hasbro 
moves for sanctions claiming that AMI's motion is frivolous. Because the Court grants Hasbro's motion dismissing AMI's Second 
Amended Complaint in its entirety, AMI's motion is denied. Hasbro's motion for sanctions is also denied."
1510,4," For a brief history of the board game Monopoly and the trademark litigation, see Anti-Monopoly v. General Mills Fun Group, 
611 F.2d 296, 299-300 (9th Cir. 1979). "
1511,5," AMI also produces a third board game, Star Peace. "
1512,6," In addition, AMI proposes a relevant submarket, which it coins ""monopoly-type family board games"" and defines as ""family 
board games based on some of the monopolistic features of real estate and/or public utilities, including the payment of rents to 
owners or users thereof."" (Second Am. Compl. P 12.) Because AMI has failed to provide factual support for this alleged 
submarket, the Court will not consider it."
1512,7," In addition to the facts based on deposition testimony and sworn declarations, AMI has submitted purported expert opinions 
based on a long litany of ""assumed"" facts, which were prepared by AMI's counsel. (See Person Decl. Exs. C, D, E, F, G, I.) In 
these assumed facts, AMI asked its experts to accept as true, among other things: (1) AMI's alleged market definition; (2) the 
allegations of Hasbro's illegal pricing practices and their anticompetitive effects contained in AMI's complaint; (3) the ""fact"" that 
Hasbro's prices are predatory; and (4) the ""fact"" that Hasbro and TRU conspired to refuse to deal with Anti-Monopoly in "
1513,," exchange for discriminatory discounts. Needless to say, the Court does not accept these unsupported and assumed facts as 
true for the purposes of the instant motions. "
1515,8," Hasbro objects to these documents on two grounds: (1) they violate Rule 26 because they were first submitted in response to 
Hasbro's summary judgment motion; (2) Magistrate Judge Peck precluded Vencill and Anspach from offering any opinions in this 
case other than those based on the assumed facts they relied on in their initial Rule 26(a)(2) expert reports. (Hasbro Reply Mem. 
8-9.) Hasbro is simply incorrect that AMI's expert submissions violate Magistrate Judge Peck's order. The substance of that order was 
to preclude AMI's experts from using certain information produced by Hasbro to supplement their expert analyses. (Harrington 
Decl. Ex. 1, at 26-29.) However, the Vencill and Anspach declarations explicitly indicate that they are based on independently 
acquired information; not information produced by Hasbro. (Vencill Decl., 7-14-96, P 14; Anspach Decl., 7-15-96, P 13.) While 
Hasbro may be correct that these expert analyses violate Rule 26, Hasbro has not shown that it is prejudiced by their 
submission because it admittedly possessed the information upon which AMI relied for its own reports. "
1516,9," Hasbro also claims that the nature of the competition among toy and game retailers negates a finding of market power. Hasbro 
explains that the top five retailers in the toy and game industry in the United States sell approximately 50% of all toys and 
games. TRU, the largest of these retailers, sells approximately 20% of all toys and games. (Harrington Decl. Ex. 13.) According 
to Hasbro, TRU is so powerful that the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") claims TRU was able to stop Hasbro from selling its 
products to various customers, including warehouse clubs. (Hasbro Mem. 8; Harrington Decl. Ex. 14, PP 4-7.) The record does not allow the Court to draw the inferences necessary to conclude that competition in the retail business for 
games restricts Hasbro's ability to control prices in the putative family board game market. First, Hasbro cites to information for 
the broader toy and game industry. Thus, the record does not sufficiently establish who the retail players are in the family board 
game market nor their effect on Hasbro. Second, even if the FTC complaint upon which Hasbro relies for its claim, were 
sufficient to show that TRU was able to restrain the quantity of Hasbro sales to TRU's retail competitors -- which it is not -- it still 
would not show that TRU sufficiently restrains Hasbro's ability to control prices on the games sold to TRU or other retailers. "
1517,10," Hasbro correctly points out that, under the Robinson-Patman Act, a secondary-line violation would occur if game retailers, that 
is, Hasbro's customers, suffered antitrust injury because of Hasbro's alleged price discrimination. See Best Brands Beverage, 
Inc. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 842 F.2d 578, 583-84 (2d Cir. 1987). In contrast, a primary-line injury refers to injury to Hasbro's 
competitors, such as AMI. Id. AMI does not have antitrust standing to pursue the alleged secondary-line claims of Hasbro's 
customers. For that reason, Hasbro's motion for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss AMI's secondary-line Robinson-Patman 
Act claims is granted. "
1519,11," The Court also notes that, under New York state law, the failure to provide argument on a point at issue constitutes 
abandonment of the issue. See Bombard v. Central Hudson Gas & Electric, 205 A.D.2d 1018, 614 N.Y.S.2d 577, 580 (3d 
Dep't 1994); see also Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Cosprophar, Inc., 828 F. Supp. 1114, 1129 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (recognizing 
that parties failure to address claim raised in adversary's papers may indicate abandonment), aff'd, 32 F.3d 690 (2d Cir. 1994). 
AMI failed to provide any argument opposing Hasbro's motion relating to AMI's state law claim, which provides an independent 
basis for dismissal. "
1528,1," GAF was Standard's major supplier of roofing products in the 1980s. Standard was also GAF's major customer in New Jersey 
and one of its top five customers nationwide. Standard bought over $ 7.7 million worth of GAF product from GAF in New Jersey 
in 1989, substantially more than any other customer in New Jersey. "
1530,2, Passaic did not sell Rossi any GAF products until September of 1989.
1530,3, Strober had already been called by GAF instructing them not to sell the shingles to Rossi Roofing.
1530,4, It is not clear whether plaintiffs are contending that this incident was caused by any of the defendants. 
1533,5," There is no evidence that this case presents a price fixing per se case, and the Court finds that it is not a price fixing case. 
Although plaintiff alleges that he was present at a lunch where the conversation involved setting prices, there is no evidence that 
price fixing ever occurred with regard to the two defendants against whom this allegation is made. Such an allegation, standing 
alone, is not enough to propel this case into the range of a per se violation. "
1534,6," As Bud Krusa from GAF testified: Q. And you don't recall whether or not any of those conversations Mr. Roth complained to you about Mr. -- any price that 
Mr. Rossi had on any particular job? A. No different than anybody else complaining about the same thing, or Mr. Rossi calling about somebody else's prices. 
Everybody complained about everybody . . . . Krusa Dep., T22:25-T23:7. "
1535,7," Perhaps the most important distinction between the case sub judice and Big Apple is that, in Big Apple, the denial of the 
franchise to the plaintiff meant that the plaintiff could not even open its business. Here, plaintiff was in business and was able to 
obtain alternate products from other manufacturers. "
1536,8," In plaintiff's opposition brief, it is alleged that GAF, Wood Fiber, Celotex, Certainteed, Wolverine, Atlas, Johns Manville, 
Suprador, Hastings Aluminum, US Intec, Tamko, Karnak, Owens Corning, Vipco, and Nailite refused to sell product directly to 
plaintiff. Plaintiff only sued GAF, Certainteed, Wolverine, Nailite, and Wood Fibre. GAF and Wood Fiber are the only 
manufacturer defendants still remaining in the case."
1536,9," This is to lessen plaintiff's concerns that defendants, in filing separate summary judgment motions, are in effect asking this 
Court to review in isolation plaintiff's evidence with respect to each defendant. "
1537,10," Although it appears that plaintiff testified in another proceeding that he did not know why he was terminated from Standard, 
this Court will not engage in a credibility determination on summary judgment. "
1541,11," Although defendants have raised an issue regarding Joseph Rossi's individual standing as a plaintiff, the Court need not reach 
that issue. He acted at all times through his corporation, and he alleges that he was damaged by the inability of Rossi Roofing to 
get product. He also was allegedly damaged by his inability to utilize his own funds or obtain alternative financing after the failure 
of Rossi-Florence/Rossi Roofing. Because the Court has found that no antitrust violation exists, it will not engage in the standing 
analysis described by the Third Circuit in In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation, 998 F.2d 1144, 1165-66 (3d Cir. 
1993). "
1550,1," Rohlfing brings this case as the executor of the estate of Samuel Taylor, the individual who was the victim of the defendants' 
allegedly unlawful conduct. As it would be cumbersome to continually refer to ""Taylor's estate"" as the plaintiff, this opinion will 
frequently refer to Rohlfing as if he himself were the plaintiff in this action."
1550,2," This opinion will refer to the ""defendants"" (in the plural) because they are separate corporations, even though this usage is 
somewhat at odds with the fact that they are under common ownership. This stylistic decision should not be taken as a 
prejudgment of the question of whether these companies should be viewed as a single entity under the law. This question is 
critical to the antitrust and RICO claims, and is discussed in Part III, infra."
1550,3," With respect to both the motion for class certification and the motion to dismiss we are required to assume the truth of the 
allegations in the complaint. See Richmond v. Nationwide Cassel L.P., 52 F.3d 640, 644 (7th Cir. 1995) (motions to dismiss); 
Hardin v. Harshbarger, 814 F. Supp. 703, 706 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (motions for class certification). In accordance with this principle, 
this opinion will generally dispense with qualifying terms such as ""allegedly"" when describing the facts, but this should not be 
understood as indicating that we have made factual findings. Also, Rohlfing has filed an amended complaint in this case. 
Consequently, any references to ""the Complaint"" in this opinion are to the amended complaint. "
1551,4," The Complaint neglects to allege the date of Taylor's death or the duration of his stay at Manor Care. Although this deficiency is 
not fatal given the requirement that pleadings be liberally construed, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(f), it should be corrected as soon as 
possible. "
1554,5," In a similar vein, the defendants also contend that it will have localized defenses to the plaintiffs' antitrust claims because many 
of its allegedly anticompetitive practices are required by particular state regulations. Conceivably such state law variations may 
eventually require the formation of subclasses as well, but not necessarily. The state regulations issue is intertwined with the 
central questions of whether Manor Care engaged in an illegal conspiracy or a ""willfull acquisition"" of monopoly power: to the 
extent Manor Care can prove that its practices arose from state regulatory schemes rather than an intent to achieve an 
anticompetitive objective, this tends to disprove the existence of a Sherman Act violation. Thus, the defendants' contentions 
regarding state law regulations are critical to the all the potential class members, regardless of the laws of their particular state."
1554,6," Manor Care also argues that individual issues will predominate with respect to the question of the degree of injury suffered by 
each plaintiff because of the scheme to defraud, but even if so, this does not preclude class certification on the question of 
liability for the same reasons set forth supra with respect to the antitrust claims."
1554,7," The complaint alleges no oral misrepresentations, which distinguishes this case from those cited by the defendants for the 
proposition that individualized proof of fraud is necessary. See Def.'s Br. at 13-14; cf.  Arenson, 164 F.R.D. at 665 (finding that 
common questions predominated where written rather than oral misrepresentations were alleged). "
1555,8," The Complaint alleges that all parties entering Manor Care facilities received these brochures, but the definition of the 
proposed class does not include receipt of the brochure as an element. For the sake of clarity--and because of the importance of 
the brochures to the fraud claims--receipt of the brochure should be added to the class definition. "
1556,9," Though we need not reach this question given our interpretation of the ICFA, the near-complete lack of contact between the 
claims of the non-Illinois plaintiffs and Illinois might render it impossible for us to apply Illinois law to the claims of non-Illinois 
plaintiffs without violating the constitutional requirements of procedural due process. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 
U.S. 797, 821, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 105 S. Ct. 2965 (1985) (holding that the Due Process Clause forbids a forum state from 
applying its own law to every member of a class unless the state has a ""'significant contact or significant aggregation of contacts' 
to the claims asserted by each member of the plaintiff class, contacts 'creating state interests'"" (quoting Allstate Ins. Co. v. 
Hague, 449 U.S. 302, 312-13, 66 L. Ed. 2d 521, 101 S. Ct. 633 (1981)))."
1556,10," Perhaps in recognition of the fact that there is no other reason to apply the ICFA to the claims of the non-Illinois plaintiffs, the 
plaintiffs suggest that the defendants' fraud scheme ""emanated"" from Illinois. See Compl. P 76; Pl.'s Reply Br. at 11. We are not 
sure exactly what the import of this cryptic assertion is: the plaintiffs have not provided any justification for applying the ICFA to 
claims by non-Illinois parties merely because a scheme ""emanated"" from the minds of persons in Illinois. Even giving the 
broadest possible reading to Martin and its progeny, we think the ICFA cannot apply to claims by out-of-state parties unless the 
""deceptive act or practice"" of which they complain was perpetrated in Illinois. We draw support for this view from an article on the 
applicability of the ICFA authored by Rohlfing's counsel. See Daniel A. Edelman, Applicability of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act 
in Favor of Out-of-State Consumers, 8 LOY. CONSUMER L. REP. 27, 34 (1996) (concluding that the ICFA should apply to 
transactions in which an Illinois business injures consumers located in other states because it is ""the fact that prohibited conduct 
takes place [in] Illinois [that] establishes that the state officials have an interest in regulating such conduct""). Here, the non-Illinois 
plaintiffs were injured by misrepresentations or omissions made outside of Illinois, so Illinois officials have no interest in 
regulating the conduct that injured them."
1556,11," For the Illinois residents included in the plaintiffs' proposed class, common issues clearly predominate with respect to the ICFA 
claim. The elements of an ICFA claim, as discussed supra, are all related to the conduct and intent of the defendants, and 
individual reliance on the deceptive acts is irrelevant. In the instant motion, however, plaintiffs have not requested certification of 
a class limited to Illinois residents for purposes of their ICFA claim. "
1557,12," We note that some of our colleagues have disagreed with our view in Koutsoubos that a breach of fiduciary duty should be 
viewed as a tort claim rather than a contract claim for choice of law purposes. See, e.g., Bankard v. First Carolina 
Communications, Inc., 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17916, No. 89 C 8571, 1991 WL 268652, at *11 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 5, 1991) (applying 
contract choice of law principles to a fiduciary duty claim); T-Bill Option Club v. Brown & Co. Sec. Corp., 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
8028, No. 88 C 8461, 1990 WL 103584, at *1 (N.D. Ill. July 2, 1990) (same). The application of contract or tort choice of law 
principles makes no difference in this case, however: both lead to the conclusion that the claims of the plaintiffs should be 
governed by the laws of the various states in which their Manor Care residences are located."
1557,13, We derive the number 13 from the fact that Vitalink operates at Manor Care facilities in 13 states. See Compl. P 7.
1557,14," To pick just one example of a potentially important nuance, Illinois law provides that a plaintiff making a fiduciary duty claim 
that does not rest on one of the traditional ""per se"" fiduciary relationships must establish the existence of a fiduciary relationship 
by ""clear and convincing"" evidence. See Burdett v. Miller, 957 F.2d 1375, 1382 (7th Cir. 1992). Do any of the other 12 states 
involved in this case impose a similar burden on plaintiffs? Rohlfing gives us no indication. "
1558,15," This is the formulation employed by Illinois courts; obviously the 12 other states involved in this case may use different 
language."
1558,16," In contrast to plaintiffs' ICFA claim, the commonality problem is not eliminated by limiting the class to parties from Illinois: the 
key individualized fact question (degree of influence and superiority) still remains even if Illinois law applies to every plaintiff. 
Thus, the fiduciary duty claim will survive only with respect to the named plaintiff."
1558,17," The defendants' observation that ""courts have frequently found nationwide classes inappropriate and unmanageable,"" see 
Def.'s Br. at 16, is both true and irrelevant; courts also frequently find nationwide classes to be appropriate, efficient, and 
manageable. The defendants make no attempt to explain why this case is more similar to the unmanageable cases than the 
manageable ones. "
1559,18," Individual testimony and evidence are likely to be necessary if the plaintiffs prevail on the liability issues and we are required to 
calculate damages. As we have already discussed, however, the potential need for individualized damages inquiries does not 
prevent class certification on the common questions of liability at this stage of the game."
1559,19," The disposition of the various claims addressed below will be binding on the classes certified supra in Part II. Thus, the 
disposition on the antitrust and RICO claims will affect all members of Rohlfing's proposed class who do not opt-out. The 
disposition of the ICFA and fiduciary duty claims affects only Rohlfing, since no class has been certified with respect to these 
claims. "
1560,20," The defendants also present several other reasons for dismissing plaintiffs' § 1 claims, see Def.'s Br. at 2-5, but we need not 
address these given our resolution of the Copperweld argument."
1560,21," We are not persuaded by the two contrary cases cited by Rohlfing. First, in Tunis Bros. Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 763 F.2d 
1482 (3d Cir. 1985), vacated on other grounds, 475 U.S. 1105, 89 L. Ed. 2d 909, 106 S. Ct. 1509 (1986), the Third Circuit found 
that a parent could conspire with a subsidiary in which it owned 79% of the equity stock, see id. at 1495 n.20. The court provided 
no explanation for this outcome, which seems particularly questionable given that the parent owned 100% of the subsidiary's "
1561,," voting stock, see id. at 1486. Moreover, we think that Tunis's precedential value is limited in light of the Third Circuit's recent 
opinion in Siegel, a case cited supra in the text, which endorses a liberal application of the unity of interest test. Second,  in 
Aspen Title & Escrow, Inc. v. Jeld-Wen, Inc., 677 F. Supp. 1477 (D. Or. 1987), the court found that a parent could conspire with 
subsidiaries in which it held 60% and 75% interests, see id. at 1486. Like Tunis, Aspen provides no explanation for why there 
was no unity of interest between the parent and the subsidiaries, and, also like Tunis, the value of Aspen has been undercut by 
a subsequent opinion of the same court. See Leaco Enters., Inc. v. General Elec. Co., 737 F. Supp. 605, 609 (D. Or. 1990) 
(precluding a conspiracy claim where a parent owned 91.9% of a subsidiary). "
1562,22," The plaintiff's only attempt to address demand-side substitutability is its argument that Manor Care patients were unable to find 
an interchangeable substitute at Manor Care. See Compl. P 64 (alleging that the defendants have ""precluded plaintiff and other 
residents of Manor Care facilities from purchasing or obtaining medication at a competitive price""). Even if true, this argument is 
like a consumer going to McDonald's and complaining that the only hamburgers available for purchase are those prepared by 
McDonald's. This is perfectly true, at McDonald's. But any consumer who is not content with a McDonald's hamburger may leave 
and choose from a myriad of available alternatives. McDonald's refusal to sell Whoppers does not mean that it has monopolized 
a relevant market for hamburgers."
1562,23," We emphasize that for purposes of this motion to dismiss we are expressing no view on what the relevant market actually is: 
we are constrained by the principle that ""proper market definition . . . can be determined only after a factual inquiry into the "
1563,," 'commercial realities' faced by consumers."" Kodak, 504 U.S. at 482. At the same time, the burden is on antitrust plaintiffs to 
allege a legally sufficient relevant market. Where the relevant market proposed by the plaintiff is not even alleged to encompass 
all interchangeable substitute products, the market is legally (rather than factually) insufficient, and a motion to dismiss is 
appropriate. See Lee v. Life Ins. Co., 23 F.3d 14, 18-19 (1st Cir. 1994) (indicating that inadequate allegations regarding the 
scope of the relevant market were a proper ground for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)); TV Communications Network v. Turner 
Network, 964 F.2d 1022, 1025 (10th Cir. 1992); Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 922 F. Supp. 1055, 1062 (E.D. 
Pa. 1996) (dismissing a § 2 claim for failure to allege a legally sufficient relevant market). "
1564,24," For the time being, Rohlfing has simply identified these employee defendants as ""John Does 1-10."" See Compl. P 75. 
Because the particular identities of these employees is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the corporate defendants, and 
because the allegedly fraudulent acts committed by these employees are clearly described, we believe this form of pleading is 
acceptable. Needless to say, after Rohlfing has had an opportunity to conduct discovery he will need to identify these individuals 
and their roles in the alleged fraud scheme with particularity."
1564,25," The defendants have also asserted Rule 9(b) as a reason to dismiss the ICFA claims in the complaint. For the reasons set 
forth above, we reject this argument."
1564,26," Understandably, Rohlfing elected not to commit itself to one particular enterprise/person combination in its complaint. Indeed, 
based on the allegations, a number of satisfactory enterprise/person combinations appear possible. There is no need for us to 
set forth more than one of these possibilities in the context of this motion to dismiss. "
1565,27," The defendants do not argue that the alleged acts of racketeering activity are unrelated, so we need not discuss this element. 
See Def.'s Br. at 12-15 (discussing only continuity). "
1566,28," The defendants also contend that their failure to disclose the relationship between Manor Care and Vitalink does not violate 
the ICFA because this fact is a matter of public record. See Def.'s Br. at 16. But even if so, this does not warrant dismissal of 
Rohlfing's ICFA claims; as discussed in the text, Rohlfing has properly alleged other deceptive statements and omissions."
1566,29," The defendants correctly observe that a party claiming the existence of a fiduciary duty where such a relationship does not 
exist as a matter of law (such as lawyer-client or principal-agent) must prove the existence of the relationship by clear and 
convincing evidence. See Pommier, 967 F.2d at 1119; Kolze, 107 N.E.2d at 690. This point will no doubt be highly relevant at 
trial or on a motion for summary judgment, but it is irrelevant with respect to this motion to dismiss: for now, Rohlfing must 
merely allege the fiduciary relationship, not prove it."
1566,30," We agree with the defendants' suggestion that Rohlfing cannot allege a breach of fiduciary duty based on the events 
surrounding the signing of the residency agreement and his selection of Vitalink as his provider of pharmaceuticals services. See 
Def.'s Reply Br. at 22. At the time of these events, prior to Taylor's residency at Manor Care, no confidence or influence could 
have been present since the parties were still dealing at arm's length. This has no impact, however, on Rohlfing's claim that after 
he took up residency at Manor Care he was overcharged for pharmaceuticals in violation of the defendants' fiduciary duty. "
1570,1," Counter-plaintiffs have requested summary judgment only on their trademark and unfair competition claims. The court need not 
address, therefore, whether summary judgment might be appropriate on their remaining claims. "
1571,2, Counterplaintiffs do not assert that their mark has obtained incontestible status. 
1572,3," See Credit Counseling Ctrs. of Am. v. National Found, for Consumer Credit, Inc., 62 F.3d 395 (5th Cir. 1995) (per 
curiam) (""[CCCA] must seek a hearing on the merits in which they may be able to convince the trier of fact that in truth and in 
fact what is being argued about is a generic terms and not protectable, and if it is protectable, that they have a right to use it 
under the fair use defense to the Lanham Act."")."
1572,4," Because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the mark's protectability, the court need not address the other elements 
of counterplaintiffs' trademark claim. "
1573,5," CCCA seeks leave to conduct additional discovery based on Intervenors' introduction of Noerr-Pennington issues into this case 
after the completion of the discovery period. The purpose of additional discovery would be to permit CCCA to obtain additional 
information about ""the objective knowledge"" of Intervenors as to the likelihood of success on the merits of their trademark claim 
and their ""subjective intent"" in filing this claim. See Decl. of Kenneth R. Matticks, Esq. at P 3. The court denies the request. Evidence of the type requested would be unavailing. This court's ruling on the inapplicability of the sham exception depends 
neither on Intervenors' opinion of the strength of their claim nor on their subjective intent in bringing it. Instead, the court's 
opinion rests on an independent evaluation of the merit of Intervenors' trademark claim, as required by Professional Real Estate 
Investors, 508 U.S. at 60-61. Additional discovery on these issues would therefore serve no purpose and CCCA's request is 
denied. "
1583,1," This Order encompasses the antitrust and intentional interference portions of the following motions: (1) Square D's Motion for

1584,3," On July 10, 1996, the Court heard arguments on UL's September 22, 1995, motion for partial summary judgment against PBS 
on Noerr-Pennington immunity. The Court took that motion under submission, and incorporates its decision as to that motion in 
this Order. "
1585,4," None of Defendants alleges all of these bases of liability. For instance, GCB does not allege that Plaintiffs developed and 
circulated false and misleading ads and press statements, and Pencon/GMEW does not include an abuse of process allegation. 
However, the Court addresses each of these bases as if pleaded by each Defendant against each Plaintiff. "
1588,5," The Court notes that the declarations of GCB and Pencon/GMEW's experts, Richard Smith and Roy Weinstein, do not account 
for injury that may have been caused exclusively by non-Noerr-Pennington protected activity. The Court also notes that PBS 
provides no evidence on the issue of antitrust injury to its business as a result of Plaintiffs' activities. "
1589,6," HN12[
] Activities that can constitute per se violations include price-fixing, group boycotts, tying arrangements, and horizontal 
territorial divisions."
1589,7," When this matter was originally filed in 1988, the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson represented all four Plaintiffs, and filed nearly 
identical complaints on behalf of each Plaintiff. The Court finds that representation by one law firm is not grounds for antitrust 
liability.  Lemelson v. Bendix Corp., 104 F.R.D. 13, 17-18 (D. Del. 1984). "

1592,9," IACs consist of technical experts who have a familiarity with UL and its programs. (UL App. at 236.) If UL were considering a 
program such as a rebuilt circuit breaker certification or standard, it is not unusual for UL to raise the issue with an appropriate 
IAC. "
1593,10," The evidentiary cornerstone of Defendants' claim is the article by Arthur Freund, entitled Circuit Breakers--Boon or Bomb?, 
which appeared in EC&M magazine in June, 1989. The Court already found that this article was not actionable against any of 
the Plaintiffs on either trade libel or defamation grounds. (See Order, dated February 24, 1997 (granting summary judgment in 
favor of Plaintiffs on Defendants' trade libel and defamation counterclaims)). The Court also found that Defendants did not 
sustain their burden on the issue of conspiracy. (See Order, dated February 24, 1997.)"
1593,11, See supra at 6-10 (discussing Noerr-Pennington immunity). 
1595,12," The Court finds that the expert testimony of Smith and Weinstein is not objectionable under Daubert v. Merrell Dow 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), and Federal Rule of Evidence 702."

1603,2," A technology market has been defined as a market consisting of ""the intellectual property that is licensed (the 'licensed 
technology') and its close substitutes -- that is, the technologies or goods that are close enough substitutes significantly to 
constrain the exercise of market power with respect to the intellectual property that is licensed."" 1 William C. Holmes,

1604,3," DMI's allegations of fraud relate to the prosecution of patent applications that resulted in the Gregg and Bailey patents which 
purportedly cover technology in the encoded CD and CD replication technology markets. (D.I. 133, Ex. A at 10-11) In its brief, 
DMI alleges that the allegations of fraud relating to the Bailey patents supports its claim that DiscoVision monopolized or 
attempted to monopolize the CD mastering technology market as well. (D.I. 197 at 10) "
1605,4," DMI alleges that Philips, Sony, and Nimbus are major suppliers of mastering equipment. (D.I. 133, Ex. A at 25) "
1607,5," Pioneer and DiscoVision have also moved to strike the corresponding affirmative defenses in DMI's answer to DiscoVision's 
patent infringement suit. (D.I. 172 at 11 n. 10, 35) At this time, Pioneer and DiscoVision do not seek the dismissal of DMI's 
allegations relating to (1) fraudulent actions in the PTO and (2) objectively baseless infringement suits. (D.I. 172 at 11 n.9)"
1607,6," HN4[
] A continuation application is a patent application that is entitled to the filing date of an earlier ""parent"" application. See"
1607,35," U.S.C. § 120. See, generally, Schwartz, ""Patent Law and Practice,"" Federal Judicial Center (2d ed. 1995) at 19-21. A patent 
issued from a continuation application benefits from the earlier filing date for the purpose of determining its validity in view of 
prior art. ""A continuation application is an application whose specification is the same as that of the parent application, but whose 
claims may be the same or different from those of the parent application."" Id. at 20. "
1608,7," DiscoVision acknowledges that DMI's allegations of fraud are sufficient to state a claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act. (D.I. 172

1608,9," The GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) implementing legislation altered the patent term from seventeen years 
from the date of issuance to the term that begins on the date the patent issues and ends twenty years from the date of the filing 
of the patent application or, under certain conditions, the date of an earlier filed applications that are referenced in the later filed 
application. See 35 U.S.C. § 154(a) and (b) (Supp. 1996) (As amended by Pub. L. No. 103-465); see generally Schwartz, 
Herbert, ""Patent Law and Practice,"" Federal Judicial Center, at 86 (1995). The term may also be extended under certain 
conditions. See 35 U.S.C. §§ 155, 156, and 157 (Supp. 1996)."

26."
1608,11," Patents that remain ""submerged"" during a long ex parte examination process and then ""surface"" upon the grant of the patent 
have been labeled ""submarine patents."" A patent application may have a long examination period due to delays by the PTO 
and/or from continuation applications. A holder of a ""submarine patent"" may be able to demand high royalties from nonpatent "
1609,," holders who invested and used the technology not knowing that a patent would later be granted. In the GATT implementing 
legislation, Congress addressed the perceived problem of ""submarine"" patents by amending the patent term provision in the 
Patent Act. Pub. L. No. 103-465, codified at 35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2). The amended section, however, does not apply to patentees 
of record as of June 7, 1995. Id."

1623,1," It is immaterial whether CSU purchased these parts at less than a reasonable price from Xerox or third parties. In either case, 
CSU cannot establish that Xerox's high prices were exclusionary and therefore constitute misuse. In addition, CSU has failed to 
come forward with specific evidence to establish its suppliers of each of the various patented parts (Xerox or third parties) and 
the price it pays for those parts. Even if the court reviewed what Xerox charged for the seven patented parts, rather than what 
CSU paid, the record evidence establishes that Xerox's prices as a whole were approximately 3% higher than what CSU claims 
is a reasonable price. This evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to establish patent misuse. "
1624,2," See Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961); 
United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965). "
1627,3," The court notes that CSU's misuse and antitrust allegations regarding Xerox's refusal to sell and high pricing of its patented 
parts are based on the legal theory prohibiting monopoly leveraging.  Kodak, 504 U.S. at 479 n.29. "
1628,4," In addition, difficulties could arise if the relevant market definitions change over time. For example, the relevant market may 
include both parts and service at the time a patent holder researches and creates an invention for a copier part. A patent holder 
certainly would undertake his research with the expectation that he could exclude others from use of the invention in the relevant 
market which includes parts and service. If the relevant market changed after the patent holder marketed his invention so that 
parts and service became separate markets, then the patent holder's right to exclude would be severely diminished. In fact, the 
patent holder's right to exclude would be practically meaningless if the patent holder wanted to continue to compete in both 
markets."
1628,5," As Xerox correctly notes, ""no patent states that it confers a monopoly in any relevant [antitrust] market. A patent only defines 
the invention. Because each use of that invention may be prevented by [the patent holder], the patent may have some 
anticompetitive effect in each market in which it is used [or not used]."" "
1629,6," Courts also have struck the same balance between the patent and antitrust laws. See, e.g., SCM, 645 F.2d at 1205-06. Under 
CSU's interpretation of Kodak, inventors would have very little incentive to develop products useful in more than one relevant 
antitrust market because they could not exclude competitors in more than one market (assuming the patent holder competes in 
both markets). To preclude patent holders from realizing the full value of their inventions by unilaterally excluding others seems 
to stand the patent law on its head."
1629,7," CSU also fails to explain why the court should assume that Xerox's monopoly over the parts market was created first and then 
used as leverage to gain a monopoly over the service market. It appears that Xerox's monopoly in both markets may have been 
created simultaneously. In any event, it was Xerox's refusal to license its patented parts that created both monopolies. "
1630,8," Among these other allegations, CSU claims that Xerox refused to sell unpatented parts to ISOs, implemented burdensome 
procedures for customers ordering parts, threatened to impose enormous costs for customers switching service between ISOs 
and Xerox, and cut service prices in an effort to eliminate ISO competition."
1630,9," Even if price discrimination by a patent holder could be illegal under the antitrust laws, the court doubts that the evidence 
presented by CSU in opposition to Xerox's summary judgment motion is sufficient. CSU's only evidence of price discrimination is 
a contract between the Navy and Xerox which does not appear to be comparable to a contract between CSU and Xerox. In 
addition, the R&D settlement specifically prohibited Xerox from charging its self-servicers a lower price than ISOs. "
1631,10," CSU filed a motion for discovery sanctions against Xerox on March 13, 1997. CSU claims that Xerox should be estopped from 
denying CSU's laches and statute of limitations defenses because of Xerox's discovery conduct. The court accordingly will defer 
consideration of the merits of these defenses until CSU's pending motion for sanctions is decided. "
1637,1," For convenience, the defendants will be identified herein as ""Columbia."" "
1643,2," The clinic correctly notes there is some support for the conclusion that hiring can be predatory and anticompetitive. Perryton 
Wholesale v. Pioneer Distrib'ng, 353 F.2d 618 (10th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 945, 16 L. Ed. 2d 208, 86 S. Ct. 1202 
(1966). However, as Columbia also correctly notes, the continued validity of the early Perryton decision is questionable. See 
Military Services Realty v. Realty Consultants, 823 F.2d 829, 831 (4th Cir. 1987). "
