28,1," Plaintiffs allege that ""from 1997 through 2001, Barrick's spot-deferred contracts enabled it, through J.P. Morgan, to borrow gold 
at 1.5%, sell it into the spot market, invest the proceeds at 6.5% … and postpone repayment of the borrowed gold for 15 years."" 
(Rec. Doc. 73 at P 9)."
28,2," Plaintiffs claim that ""Barrick recognizes that its 'Premium Gold Sales Program' is unique,"" and that Barrick admits that ""no other 
gold producer has available to it the combination of margin-free hedging, 10 to 15 year terms and flexible delivery dates."" (Rec. 
Doc. 73 at P 35). As a result, Plaintiffs claim that ""in combination with bullion banks such as J.P. Morgan, Barrick, alone among 
gold mining companies, is positioned to manipulate the price of gold at will."" (Id.). "
30,3," Plaintiffs' LUTPA claims and claims against Barrick for libel, slander and defamation and the standards applied thereto, are 
discussed below in Part III.C and E respectively. "
31,4," As will be set forth, infra, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a claim under the Sherman Act, despite 
Plaintiffs' inartful attempt to demonstrate Defendants' conduct as predatory. Although inartfully pleaded, especially with respect 
to the predatory pricing claim, the Complaint, liberally construed; sufficiently alleges a claim for illegal restraint of trade, 
monopolization and attempted monopolization. HN5[
] As for predatory pricing, that claim has two elements: ""1) the prices 
complained of are below an appropriate measure of the alleged [would-be] monopolist's costs and 2) … the alleged [would-be] 
monopolist has a reasonable chance of recouping the losses through below-cost pricing."" Taylor Publ'g Co. v. Jostens Inc., 216 
F.3d 465, 477 (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting Stearns Airport Equip. Co. v. FMC Corp., 170 F.3d 518, 528). Plaintiffs' petition fails to 
allege facts specific enough to establish that Defendants sold gold into the spot market below an ""appropriate measure"" of cost. 
See Malek Wholesaler, Inc. v. First Film Extruding, Ltd., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3674, *9-10, 97 C 7087 (N.D.Ill. Mar.24, 1998) 
(dismissing predatory pricing claim where complaint failed to allege below cost pricing and reasonable prospect of recoupment); 
see also Syncsort Inc. v. Sequential Software, Inc., 50 F. Supp.2d 318 (D.N.J. 1999) (holding that failure to allege an essential 
element of an antitrust claim is sufficient grounds for dismissal). Further, the Court is not certain that Plaintiffs' predatory pricing 
claim is intelligible in this context -- the selling of gold at admittedly market price, albeit a market allegedly manipulated 
downward by the defendants. Nonetheless, excising Plaintiffs' reliance on predatory pricing from the Complaint, the Court finds 
that a cognizable claim for monopolization survives. Ignoring the minutiae, the Complaint alleges that Barrick, in combination 
with Morgan is artificially manipulating the gold market by the sheer size and volume of its activity. This claim will stand or fall on 
whether the alleged conduct creates an artificial market that manipulates the price of gold or whether the complained of 
consequences are simply the byproduct of stellar business acumen."
31,5," Although the official gold-based international monetary system or the gold standard was abandoned by the United States in 
1971, gold ""remains an important element of global monetary reserves."" World Gold Council, ""Chronology of Gold in the 
International Monetary System"" at <http://www.gold.org/index.html> (reporting on the Washington Agreement entered into by 
fifteen European central banks to regulate gold reserves, especially the leasing of gold due to its ""destabilising effect on the gold 
market""). "
33,6," The Court recognizes that ""market power"" as defined in National Collegiate as ""the ability to raise prices above those that 
would be charged in a competitive market,"" is generally followed as the standard definition. Id., 468 U.S. at 109 n. 38. However, 
in that same opinion the Supreme Court offered a broader definition of ""market power"" as the ""ability to alter the interaction of 
supply and demand."" Id. at 109. In the instant action, Plaintiffs' essentially allege that Defendants' market power is used to "
34,," depress the price of gold, injuring gold consumers, primarily investors holding gold as a monetary instrument. The Court finds 
that HN11[
] in defining ""market power"" the mechanics of the anticompetitive act -- raising prices above those supported in a 
competitive market -- is less significant than the general ability to manipulate the relationship between supply and demand. In 
other words the focus of inquiry should be on alleged injury to consumers and not the mechanics of the complained of conduct. 
See e.g., Valley Liquors, Inc. v. Renfield Importers, Ltd., 678 F.2d 742, 745 (7th Cir. 1982) (discussing market power as the 
ability to ""seriously threaten consumer welfare,"" protection of which is the objective of the Sherman Act). Here, in the 
extraordinary market for gold and gold derivatives, consumers/investors are readily injured by market participants with sufficient 
market power to depress price. "
35,7," Previously, in this opinion the Court recognized for antitrust standing and anticompetitive effect purposes that all gold markets 
alleged by Plaintiffs are ""integrated"" and synonymous markets, however, for the purpose of alleging monopoly power the Court 
finds that the gold mining market and the gold derivatives market are sufficiently differentiated such that a claim for 
monopolization in each market can be properly alleged. The Court finds no inherent contradiction in this finding. "
37,8," The Court appreciates that termination of the existing contracts between the Defendants might jeopardize the various central 
banks' ability to recover gold which they have leased. However, the Court declines to consider this potential issue until discovery 
sheds more light the nature and extent of the interests involved. Defendants may then reurge dismissal of this remedy if 
necessary and appropriate. "
38,9," The Court considers the slander and libel allegations encompassed within its analysis of Louisiana defamation law. See Smith 
v. Berry Co., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2948, No.Civ.A. 96-1899, 1997 WL 104972, at *1 n. 2, (E.D.La. Mar. 6, 1997) (citing 
Neuberger, Coerver & Goins v. Times Picayune Publishing Co., 597 So.2d 1179, 1183 (La.App. 1 Cir. 1992)."
38,10," This standard is often stated in four parts with falsity and defamatory words comprising a single element. See Trentecosta v. 
Beck, 703 So.2d 552, 559 (La. 1997) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts § 558 (1977)). "
39,11," On June 6, 2003, Donald Doyle, Chief Executive Officer of Blanchard and Neal Ryan, Assistant Vice-President of Blanchard 
(collectively the ""Intervenors"") filed a First Supplemental and Amending Complaint in Intervention (""Complaint in Invention"") 
asserting an analogous claim for defamation based on the identical statements found in the Complaint. (Rec. Doc. 74). Because 
the Court finds that Blanchard's defamation claim against Barrick is not actionable, the Court dismisses the Complaint in 
Intervention for the same reasons. "
52,1," HN3[
] The remedies available for copyright infringement are contained in Title 17 U.S.C. § 504. Under that provision, the aggrieved party may elect to recover the actual damages and profits of the infringer, or to recover statutory damages. See, 
Section 504(a). If the copyright owner can prove willful infringement, the maximum statutory damages, which may be awarded, 
increases from $ 30,000.00 to $ 150,000.00. See, Section 504(c)."
52,2," Although the Plaintiff objected to the Defendants' argument, that the Court should consider granting Summary Judgment in 
favor of the Defendants, because the Defendants had not formally filed such a Motion, we agree with the Defendants that such a 
result is permissible under the law of this Circuit. Our Court of Appeals has recently reiterated that HN4[
] a Court might 
properly grant Summary Judgment, in favor of the non-moving party, even if the Court does so, sua sponte, as long as ""the 
losing party was on notice that she had to come forward with all of her evidence."" Lerohl v. Friends of Minnesota Sinfonia, 322 
F.3d 486, 492 (8th Cir. 2003), quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 326, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265, 106 S. Ct. 2548 (1986). 
Here, the Defendants' brief placed the Plaintiff on notice that the Defendants also sought the entry of Summary Judgment, and 
the Plaintiff was afforded an opportunity to address that question in its Reply Memorandum. As a result, if we should find that 
there are no genuine issues of material fact precluding Summary Judgment, and that the law compels a Judgment for the 
Defendants, there is no procedural bar to the grant of such Judgment, under the circumstances here. "
53,3," As conceded by defense counsel: Superficially on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, they're right. They win[,] if it's not a fair use because we used 
them [i.e., the Plaintiff's stickers]. We used them. They're theirs. We sold them. They are out in the world. We can't claim we 
didn't do it. Didn't have permission, didn't have a license. Those facts are agreed to. Transcript of Hearing on June 13, 2003, at p. 32 [Tr. at 32]."
53,4," As expressed by defense counsel, during the course of the Hearing on the Motions: This is, as your Honor noted[,] a case with many interesting issues, but as to the copyright issue I think which is interesting 
to me is for the first time that I've ever defended a summary judgment motion. I'm not going to stand here and say there's 
any disputed facts. I don't think [there] are. I think this is now a nice legal question. The parties have put together a factual record that is as 
good as it is going to get. We aren't fighting about it and your Honor is pretty much able to take it and apply the law [to] the facts and give us an 
answer. Tr. at 31. "
56,5," We note that HN15[
] the use of ""transformed,"" in this context, is not the same as the using the word ""transformative,"" as that 
term is used in the first element of the fair use test. See, Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group, Inc., 150 
F.3d 132, 143 (2nd Cir. 1998). ""Although derivative works that are subject to the author's copyright transform an original work 
into a new mode of presentation, such works -- unlike works of fair use -- take expression for purposes that are not 
'transformative.'"" Id. "
57,6," The Defendants disagree, and assert that their books also contain instructive text, as did the consumer guide books, and that, 
as a result, their Idea Books are complementary, and not infringing uses of the Plaintiff's copyrights. We cannot agree. The 
contents of the Defendants' Idea Books simply list the items displayed on a page, and contain nothing that is evaluative, or in the 
nature of a critical commentary. Further, the Defendants' argument, that their Idea Books promote the purchase of the Plaintiff's 
stickers, is only partially correct for, as the Plaintiff underscores, it also sells idea books, which also employ its own stickers. 
Again, its copyrights should allow the Plaintiff to enjoy the derivative uses of those copyrights, and not inure to the competing 
benefit of the Defendants. "
58,7," In her Affidavit, DeBonoPaula avers that, while she was employed as a consultant for the Plaintiff, she taught people how to 
make scrapbooks with the Plaintiff's stickers and, in order to be more effective in selling the Plaintiff's products, she developed 
designs for sticker scrapbook pages. Affidavit of Lisa DeBonoPaula, at P3. "
59,8," HN19[
] In considering this second factor, the Court is also to look at whether the work is published, or unpublished, because 
the right of first publication may also be implicated in the use of an unpublished work. Nunez v. Caribbean International News 
Corp., 235 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2000), citing Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, supra at 564. Here, all of the 
stickers, which the Defendants used in their Idea Books, were ""published"" by the Plaintiff, as they were already publically 
available. Thus, the scope of fair use is broader, than would be the case if the stickers had not yet been marketed. See, CSM 
Investors, Inc. v. Everest Development, Ltd., 840 F. Supp. 1304, 1313 (D. Minn. 1994) (noting that the scope of fair use is more 
narrow as to unpublished, than published works); citing Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, supra at 564. "
99,1," PPR also claims that all of E-Z Bowz's patents are invalid because they were allegedly filed after the '618 Application was 
abandoned. See Def. Mem. at 14-15. However, the prosecution history of the '618 Application shows that E-Z Bowz abandoned 
that application on January 24, 1995, see Express Abandonment, dated January 24, 1995 (reproduced in '618 History), at 1, and 
the USPTO acknowledged the abandonment on February 9, 1995. See Notice of Abandonment, dated February 9, 1995 
(reproduced in '618 History), at 1. It is undisputed that the applications for the '979 and '733 Patents were filed on January 11, 
1995, see Def. 56.1 Statement PP 9, 11 -- prior to the notice and recognition of abandonment. "
106,2," The fact that this Court has recommended finding the '998 Design Patent invalid due to the on-sale bar does not abrogate its 
relevance to the question of functionality. HN34[
] A design patent cannot be issued if the invention is functional. See, e.g., Hupp v. Siroflex of Am., Inc., 122 F.3d 1456, 1460 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (""A design or shape that is entirely functional . . . does not 
meet the statutory design criteria of a design patent."") (citing cases). It follows that ""because a design patent is granted only for 
non-functional designs, it can serve as evidence that a plaintiff's trade dress is not functional."" Krueger Int'l, 915 F. Supp. at 605 
(citations omitted). The expiration of a design patent does not remove its relevance to the functionality question. See Topps Co., 
1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18556, 1996 WL 719381, at *10. That such a patent may be invalidated due to the on-sale bar is also of 
no logical relevance to the question of whether the patent as granted showed non-functionality."
106,3," E-Z Bowz has not moved for summary judgment in its favor with regard to PPR's counterclaim of patent invalidity and non-
infringement of E-Z Bowz's patents or trade dress. See PPR Complaint PP 102-07. As discussed in section III.A above, the 
Court has already determined that PPR's motion for summary judgment on this count should be granted in part and denied in 
part. "
108,4," PPR has not even shown there was any ""fraud"" in obtaining the patents at issue. The fact that the Court has found the '998 
Patent invalid due to the on-sale bar does not establish fraud. See Digital Equip. Corp. v. Diamond, 653 F.2d 701, 719 (1st Cir. 
1981) (""At most, the USPTO has established that [the inventor] was 'negligent' in not exploring . . . the possibility that the early 
commercial activity constituted an 'on sale' bar. Such negligence is not by itself equivalent to fraud.""). "
124,1," After this dismissal, the parties entered into a stipulation to dismiss with prejudice the intentional interference claim against 
Avid, without prejudice to Digital Images' right to appeal and reinstatement in the event of reversal. The intentional interference 
claim is not an issue in this appeal. "
126,2," The first and second amended complaint make consistent allegations regarding the antitrust injury suffered. The district court 
viewed Digital Images' allegations more favorably in its decision dismissing the first amended complaint. "
128,3," The district court believed also that Digital Images' injury was ""exacerbated by the very thing the antitrust laws are designed to 
promote"" because its ""current inventory of editing products is harmed the more innovative and productive the joint-venture 
between Avid and Tektronix."" The district court went on to conclude that ""granting relief to [Digital Images] for a reduction in the 
value of its inventory as a result of a merger would . . . have the perverse effect of punishing mergers that lead to the production 
of better products in proportion to the superiority of the merged entity's products."" [ER 287.] This analysis is sheer speculation. 
Nothing in the record supports the proposition that the joint venture produced better products, innovation, or productivity. In fact, 
the complaint alleges that the effect of the agreement was to diminish innovation and quality of the product. "
130,4," Nor is it (1) Hairston v. Pac. 10 Conf., 101 F.3d 1315 (9th Cir. 1996) (where I would have denied antitrust standing to 
basketball players unhappy with NCAA sanctions against their school); (2) R.C. Dick Geothermal Corp. v. Thermogenics, Inc., 
890 F.2d 139 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc) where there was no agreement to restrict the output of the product involved; or (3) ARCO 
v. U.S.A. Petroleum, 495 U.S. 328 (1990) (one competitor held not to have demonstrated antitrust injury from rival's vertical, 
maximum price fixing agreement)."
130,5," Defendants argue that ""by 1998 the demand for Lightworks' products had declined drastically."" This decline in demand may 
make it more difficult for Digital Images to prove damages in a certain amount or to demonstrate the ""direct"" or causation 
element for antitrust standing, but it does not impact our finding of antitrust injury. Moreover, the defendants muddy the Rule 
12(b)(6) waters by injecting assertions of factual disputes into their argument, such as (1) Lightworks was not discontinued but 
""sold to a third party and is in business,"" and that Digital Images knew it, and (2) ""Ms. Shott [the owner of Digital Images], 
shutdown her own company and went off to write a novel."" Whether this is true or not, and whether it is relevant is to be decided 
at a stage later through a motion to dismiss for lack of standing pursuant to Rule (12)(b)(6). It is true of course, that an antitrust 
cause of action is susceptible of dismissal at any stage once it does appear factually that the injury complained of was not 
antitrust in nature. As illustrated in Brunswick, ""judgment must be given to the defendant whenever it appears that any essential 
element of the plaintiff's claim is missing . . . ."" Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 335e2. (2d ed. 2000); 
R.C. Dick Geothermal, 890 F.2d at 145 (standing is properly raised at any stage of the litigation). Finally, we do not address the 
validity of defenses such as ""failing business,"" ""exiting assets,"" and ""failing division."" See Antitrust Law Developments (Fifth), 
Appendix C § 5. "
133,6," The district court identified the fifth statement (Tektronix's representation that it had ""people actively developing a real-time 
effects system, and will unveil it next year [1997]""), as actionable and not subject to dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), but 
did not address the statement during subsequent summary judgment proceedings. It should do so on remand. "
139,*," Honorable William H. Stafford, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation. "
140,1," Zenith came to a tentative settlement following the district court's order granting partial summary judgment and is not a party to 
this appeal."
140,2," ""Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, 
within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes 
the patent."" 35 U.S.C. § 271(a). "
141,3," Specifically, any patent claiming the drug or method of using the drug that ""could reasonably be asserted if a person not 
licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug."" 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1)."
141,4,"  It shall be an act of infringement to submit an application under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
[21 U.S.C. § 355(j)] . . . for a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent . . . if the purpose of such 
submission is to obtain approval under such Act to engage in the commercial manufacture, use, or sale of a drug . . . 
claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in a patent before the expiration of such patent."
141,35," U.S.C. § 271(e)(2)(A). This definition of infringement was added by Hatch-Waxman to allow the invocation of the procedures 
described in the following paragraph of this opinion"
141,5," The patent holder is, of course, free to sue the applicant for infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(2)(A) after the 45 day 
window expires. The 30-month stay of FDA approval, however, will not be triggered. "
142,6," When the agreements at issue were entered into, the FDA regulations defined the relevant court decision triggering the end of 
the 30-month stay or the start of the first filer's 180-day exclusivity period as the decision of the appellate court hearing the 
infringement action against the first filer. This rule was challenged in court and held invalid by TorPharm Inc., v. Shalala, No. 97-
1925, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21983 (D.D.C. Sep. 15, 1997), appeal withdrawn and remanded, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 4681 (D.C. 
Cir. Feb. 5, 1998), vacated on other grounds (D.D.C. April 9, 1998) (30-month stay expires upon judgment of the district court 
holding the patent not infringed), and by Mylan Pharms., Inc., v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000) (180-day exclusivity 
period triggered by judgment of the district court holding the patent invalid). Though the FDA was initially committed to continued 
adherence to the appellate judgment rule, see 62 Fed. Reg. 63,268 (Nov. 28, 1997), it dropped the rule following the Mylan 
decision, see 65 Fed. Reg. 43,233, 43,234 (July 13, 2000) (interim rule). The FDA now considers the 180-day exclusivity period 
to be triggered by any district court judgment holding the patent invalid, not infringed, or unenforceable, whether or not the 
judgment comes from the district court hearing the infringement suit against the first filer. See Granutec, Inc., v. Shalala, 1998 
U.S. App. LEXIS 6685, Nos. 97-1873 & 97-1874, 1998 WL 153410, *8-9 (4th Cir. April 3, 1998) (unpublished, table decision 
reported at 139 F.3d 889) (endorsing the FDA's position that, if the successful defense requirement is invalid, the court decision 
triggering the 180-day exclusivity period is the decision of any district court). See also Teva Pharms., USA, Inc. v. FDA, 337 U.S. 
App. D.C. 204, 182 F.3d 1003 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (reversing district court's denial of an injunction to require the FDA to recognize 
the dismissal with prejudice of an infringement suit against a subsequent filer as triggering the first filer's 180-day exclusivity 
period). See post at n.12 for a discussion of the successful defense requirement."
142,7, The facts are largely uncontested by the parties.
142,8," Terazosin hydrochloride is a crystal. Dihydrate terazosin hydrochloride is a particular crystalline polymorph of terazosin 
hydrochloride. The opinion will refer to terazosin hydrochloride and its polymorphs simply as terazosin hydrochloride unless 
greater specificity is appropriate."
142,9, The active ingredient in these two drugs is anhydrous terazosin hydrochloride.
142,10," The '207 patent, issued on April 2, 1996, claims a method of preparing anhydrous terazosin hydrochloride. The patent is due 
to expire in October of 2014. "
143,11, The active ingredient of this drug is anhydrous terazosin hydrochloride.
143,12," Prior to 1998, the FDA applied the ""successful defense"" requirement to ANDA filers hoping to take advantage of the 180-day 
exclusivity period. A subsequently-filed ANDA would only have its approval date delayed by 180 days if the first-filer had 
successfully defended against an infringement suit. See 59 Fed. Reg. 50,338, 50,367 (Oct. 3, 1994) (adopting successful 
defense regulation as a final rule, codified at 21 C.F.R. § 314.107). If Zenith's ANDA were ready for approval before Geneva 
successfully defended Abbott's infringement suit, then the ANDA would be approved without the 180-day delay. If Zenith were 
forced to make a paragraph IV certification with respect to Abbott's '095 and '207 patents, however, Abbott could invoke the 30-
month stay of approval, giving Geneva more time to defend Abbot's infringement action against it. The successful defense requirement was eventually held to be an unreasonable interpretation of the Hatch-Waxman Act by two 
courts of appeals. See Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 329 U.S. App. D.C. 341, 140 F.3d 1060, 1069-70 (D.C. Cir. 1998); 
Granutec, 1998 U.S. App. LEXIS 6685, 1998 WL 153410, at *6-7. The Mova court enjoined the FDA from enforcing the 
regulation, and the FDA dropped the requirement effective November 10, 1998. See 63 Fed. Reg. 59,710, 59,711 (Nov. 5, 1998) 
(interim rule)."
143,13," The '532 patent claims dihydrate terazosin hydrochloride, the active ingredient in Hytrin. That patent expired on February 17, 
2000. "
145,14," Defendants also argued that the Agreements were immune from antitrust liability under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, see 
United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference 
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); that the Agreements were not subject to per se 
treatment because of their novelty; and that the Agreements could not have anti-competitive effects because independent 
regulatory prohibitions prevented market entry by Geneva and Zenith until at least August of 1999. The court rejected these 
arguments, as well. The defendants do not raise their Noerr-Pennington or ineffective restraints arguments on appeal. "
146,15," Indeed, all of appellants' arguments rely primarily on the circumstance that the Agreements arose in the context of patent 
litigation. "
147,16," The '207 patent was, of course, declared invalid on September 1, 1998, a judgment affirmed on January 10, 2000. The 
antitrust consequences of this subsequent invalidation will be addressed below. "
148,17," We say ""may"" because we do not hold that the '207 patent would have allowed Abbott to obtain a preliminary injunction or a 
stay of an adverse judgment pending appeal. We mean only that these are among the considerations that the district court 
should address on remand. We do note that appellees have not at this stage argued that Abbott would have been unable to 
obtain such relief."
148,18," Appellees argue that the Agreements have broader exclusionary tendencies in that they also prohibited the marketing of non-
infringing terazosin products, prohibited Geneva from marketing infringing products beyond the date a district court held the '207 
patent invalid, and prohibited Geneva from waiving its 180-day exclusivity period. As we explain below, these prohibitions may 
be beyond the scope of Abbott's lawful right to exclude and, if so, would expose appellants to antitrust liability for any actual 
exclusionary effects resulting from these provisions that appellees can prove at the causation and damages stages of litigation. 
Our point thus far is that appellees have failed to prove that appellants should face per se antitrust liability for treble damages for 
the failure of Zenith and Geneva to market admittedly infringing products when no court had declared Abbott's patent invalid or 
unenforceable at the time of the Agreements."
148,19," That is, appellees have neither alleged nor asserted that the patent was procured by fraud, that appellants knew the patent 
was invalid, that there was no objective basis to believe that the patent was valid, or any such similar allegations. We therefore 
are not called upon to decide what the antitrust consequences of such circumstances might be. "
150,20," The cost and complexity of most patent litigation is a familiar problem to the court system. See, e.g., Blonder-Tongue Lab. v.

Techs., Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1475-76 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Rader, J., dissenting) (discussing claim construction); Matter of Schering-
Plough Corp., 2002 FTC LEXIS 40, No. 9297, 2002 WL 1488085, *166-67 & *239-40 (F.T.C. June 27, 2002), also available at 
http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/d9297.htm. See also Crane, 54 Fla. L. Rev. at 757. The cost savings of settlement, both to the 
parties and to the public, are equally widely-recognized. See Aro Corp. v. Allied Witan Co., 531 F.2d 1368, 1372 (6th Cir. 1976) 
(""Public policy favors settlement of disputes without litigation. Settlement is of particular value in patent litigation, the nature of 
which is often inordinately complex and time consuming."")."
150,21," Similarly, it has been suggested that the ""sham"" exception to the antitrust immunity afforded by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine 
is or may be available also to antitrust plaintiffs seeking to pierce the patent immunity. See Independent Services Organizations, 
203 F.3d at 1326-27. Because the parties have not briefed such potential exceptions to the patent immunity from antitrust 
liability, we do not address them at this time. "
151,22," For example, the size of the payments might be evidence supporting a claim that the patentee knew that the patent was 
procured by fraud, or knew that the patent was invalid, or that there was no objective basis to believe the patent was valid. See 
discussion in Part B, supra."
151,23," For example, it seems reasonable to assume that part of the payments to Geneva were in return for Geneva's agreement not 
to waive its 180-day exclusivity period. Payments for provisions other than the acknowledgment of validity would not shed light 
on the parties' evaluations of the merits of the validity issue."
151,24," Neither appellees nor the district court have offered any similar suspicions with regard to the structure of payments under the 
Zenith Agreement."
151,25, The terms of the agreements at issue in the Cardizem CD case were similar to the terms of the Agreements in this case. 
152,26," The Sixth Circuit seems to have placed considerable reliance upon the generic's agreement to delay entering the market in 
exchange for exit payments, although it may also have been influenced by other provisions of the agreement which might more 
readily seem to exceed the potential exclusionary power of the patent. For example, the Sixth Circuit mentioned the effect of the 
agreements regarding the 180-day exclusivity period as well, and its reference to the district court opinion in that case might 
reflect some reliance on the restriction on non-infringing products. See Cardizem CD, 332 F.3d at 907-08; In re Cardizem CD 
Antitrust Litig., 105 F. Supp. 2d 682, 705 (E.D.Mich. 2000). However, the Sixth Circuit opinion did not purport to measure the 
several provisions against the exclusionary power of the patent, or differentiate between provisions that fell within the scope of 
the patent's protection and those which did not. Cf. Cardizem CD, 105 F. Supp. 2d at 701 (""The anticompetitive effects of [the] 
patent are likewise not at issue.""). To the extent that the Sixth Circuit suggests that a settlement of patent litigation was a per se 
violation of the antitrust laws merely because it involves a generic's agreement to delay marketing until resolution of the patent 
infringement case in exchange for exit payments, we respectfully disagree. We believe that the potential exclusionary power of 
the patent must first be considered."
152,27," Application of rule of reason analysis is similarly inappropriate, as the anticompetitive effects of exclusion cannot be seriously 
debated. Rule of reason and per se analysis are both aimed at assessing the anticompetitive effects of particular conduct; what 
is required here is an analysis of the extent to which antitrust liability might undermine the encouragement of innovation and 
disclosure, or the extent to which the patent laws prevent antitrust liability for such exclusionary effects. "
153,28," We express no view at this time on what role the FDA's regulation of market entry might play in the appropriate antitrust 
analysis."
153,29," Courts have not hesitated to apply traditional antitrust principles to agreements not within the scope of the patent protection. 
See Line Material, 333 U.S. at 307, 68 S. Ct. at 560 (holding a patent pooling agreement that fixed the prices at which licensees 
would sell the patented product per se illegal); Masonite, 316 U.S. at 274, 62 S. Ct. at 1076 (holding a price-fixing agreement 
among patentees and their licensees per se illegal)."
153,30," Because the appellants' arguments supporting the application of the rule of reason rely primarily on the circumstance that the 
Agreements arise out of patent litigation, and because the determination of the appropriate analysis should await the inquiries to 
be made on remand, we decline at this time to address the issue further. We note, however, that the application of the rule of 
reason is not synonymous with exhaustive factual inquiry. ""Some rule-of-reason cases can be disposed of merely on the basis of 
the parties' arguments and, more often, on the basis of a limited summary judgment record."" Hovenkamp, P 1508."
153,31," This is not to suggest that the provisions should be considered in isolation; agreements that are anticompetitive when 
considered in isolation (such as covenants not to compete) can still be lawful if they are ancillary to another agreement and, 
when viewed in combination, will have the overall effect of enhancing competition. See Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs.

(1988), Polk Bros., 776 F.2d at 189. We simply suggest that careful consideration of individual provisions may be helpful should 
it appear that the Agreements are unlawful only in part. "

162,3," The HMOs also contend that the district court abused its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing prior to its Daubert

] Although in limine hearings are generally recommended prior to Daubert determinations, see Padillas v. Stork- Gamco, Inc., 186 F.3d 412, 418 (3d Cir. 1999), they are not required, see Lauzon v. Senco Prods., Inc., 270 F.3d 681, 685-86 
(8th Cir. 2001). The only legal requirement is that the parties ""have an adequate opportunity to be heard"" before the district court 
makes its decision. See, e.g., Nelson v. Tenn. Gas Pipeline Co., 243 F.3d 244, 249 & n.3 (6th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 
822, 151 L. Ed. 2d 25, 122 S. Ct. 56 (2001); Cortes-Irizarry v. Corporacion Insular De Seguros, 111 F.3d 184, 188 n.3 (1st Cir. 
1997). Here, the parties were allowed to exceed the normal page limits in their briefs on Tobacco's motion for summary "
163,," judgment, and the district court permitted the HMOs to present written submissions by Dr. Harris and other experts in support of 
their argument. We thus conclude that the HMOs had an adequate opportunity to be heard on the Daubert matter. The HMOs also argue that because there was no Daubert hearing we should review the district court's exclusion of Dr. Harris's 
testimony de novo. Our case law is clear, however, that we review the exclusion of testimony under Daubert for an abuse of 
discretion despite the absence of a hearing. Lauzon, 270 F.3d at 685-86. "

194,27," The relevant portions of 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) provide: HN22[
] ""racketeering activity"" means any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of Title 18, United States Code: Section 1341 (relating to mail fraud); Section 1343 (relating to 
wire fraud); Section 1951 (relating to interference with commerce, robbery, or extortion); Section 1952 (relating to racketeering 
enterprises involving interstate travel or transportation); and Section 1954 (relating to unlawful employee benefit plan payments, 
bribes or kickbacks)."
194,28," Because the plaintiff's mail and wire fraud claims are almost identical factually, we consider them concurrently. ""As we have 
noted, HN23[
] the wire fraud and mail fraud statutes differ only in form, not in substance, and cases . . . interpreting one 
govern the other as well."". See United States v. Morelli, 169 F.3d 798, 806 n.9 (3d Cir. 1999). "
195,29," Defendants argue that plaintiffs' mail and wire fraud claims based solely on omissions must fail, contending that the Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized that non-disclosure cannot form the basis of a fraud claim absent a special relationship 
between the parties. See Kehr Packages, 926 F.2d at 1416. There the Third Circuit stated: ""Since Donnelly never represented 
that he had lending authority, or that the funds would be provided, his non-disclosure cannot reasonably said to be deceptive."" In 
Kehr Packages, the Third Circuit relied upon the Second Circuit decision in United States v. Von Barta, 635 F.2d 999, 1006-
1007 (2d Cir. 1980), which stated that non-disclosure is not actionable under mail fraud statute absent some duty to disclose. In this case, defendants' blanket assertion is too broad. In Kehr Packages the Third Circuit only recognized that HN25[
] an 
omission must be deceptive in nature absent a special relationship. See 926 F.2d at 1416. Moreover, the Court explicitly stated: 
""The scheme need not involve affirmative misrepresentation . . ., but the statutory term 'defraud' usually signifies the deprivation 
of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching."" 926 F.2d at 1415 (internal quotations and citations omitted). In 
addition, in Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494, 528 (3d Cir. 1998), the Third Circuit recognized that 
omission need only be ""reasonably calculated to deceive"" to constitute a ""scheme to defraud"". HN26[
] The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has explained what is required for an omission to constitute fraud, absent 
a special relationship of fiduciary duty: United States v. Keplinger, 776 F.2d 678, 697 (7th Cir. 1985), holds ""that omissions or concealment of material information 
can constitute fraud . . . cognizable under the mail fraud statute, without proof of a duty to disclose the information pursuant 
to a specific statute or regulation."" In that case a laboratory had omitted from a report on the toxicity of a drug an opinion by 
a consultant that the drug had some toxic effects, and we held that the jury was entitled to find that this omission was 
fraudulent, given the impression, conveyed by the report, of the utter harmlessness of the drug. Plenty of cases say that 
""merely failure to disclose"" is not, without more, mail fraud, e.g., Reynolds v. East Dyer Development Co., 882 F.2d 1249, 
1252 (7th Cir. 1989), and we certainly have no quarrel with this proposition. Whether a failure to disclose is fraudulent 
depends on context, United States v. Biesiadecki, 933 F.2d 539, 542-43 (7th Cir. 1991) . . . . Emery v. American General Finance, Inc., 71 F.3d 1343, 1346-1347 (7th Cir. 1995). In addition, the Tenth Circuit stated in U.S. v. Cochran, 109 F.3d 660, 665 (10th Cir. 1997): HN27[
] ""Even apart from a 
fiduciary duty, in the context of certain transactions, 'a misleading omission is actionable as fraud . . . if it is intended to induce a 
false belief and resulting action to the advantage of the misleader and the disadvantage of the misled.'"". "
196,30," Defendants note that generally a court ruling on a motion to dismiss may only consider the pleadings in deciding the motion, a 
document specifically relied upon in the complaint may be examined without converting the motion to dismiss into one for 
summary judgment. See In Re: Burlington Coat Factory Securities Litigation, 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). Defendants 
have therefore attached a copy of the HMO-physician agreement, signed by plaintiff in December of 1998, and a 2001 copy of 
the Keystone Health Plan Central Administrative Manual referenced in the agreement for our consideration. Although we concur that we may consider the copy of the signed agreement, we do not believe that we can consider the 
attached edition of the manual because it was published over two years after the parties entered into the agreement. HN29[
] 
""[A] court may consider an undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the 
plaintiff's claims are based on the document."" In Re: Donald J. Trump Casino Securities Litigation-Taj Mahal Litigation, 7 F.3d 
357, 368 n.9 (3d Cir. 1993). Because in this case we have no way of knowing that the subsequently published edition of the 
manual accurately reflects the terms of the 1998 agreement alleged to contain the relevant misrepresentations and omissions, 
we decline to consider the 2001 edition of the manual provided by defendant."
196,31," The HMO-physician agreement defines a ""Member"" as ""an individual who has entered into a contract with KHP Central (or on 
whose behalf a contract has been entered into) for the provision of medical and hospital services, and the eligible dependants of 
such individual, who have selected or been assigned to Primary Care Physician."" "
197,32," According to plaintiffs, defendants use criteria in these statements to evaluate and award bonus payments to physicians to 
offset the administrative costs of processing claims as directed by defendants. (Complaint at P 43)."
197,33," Attachment C of the HMO-physician agreement provides that quarterly Full Service Bonus Capitation (FSBC) is ""the product of 
Member Months for the respective quarter (MM), the current Reward Ratio (RR) and 3.1 [FSBC = MM x RR x 3.1]"". Attachment B explains how the Reward Ratio is calculated: Primary Care Physician's eligibility and participation in the Full Service Bonus Capitation will be determined based in part 
on a Reward Ratio calculated for each Primary Care Physician practice as follows: The Reward Ratio will be calculated by dividing the total number of Reward Points awarded to the Primary Care Physician 
practice by KHP Central in each of three categories: a) Quality Assurance, b) Morbidity Index and c) Efficiency; by the total 
number of points possible. The Quality Assurance ratings are based on KHP Central's most recent Quality Assurance Review of the Primary Care 
Physician practice as well as several member satisfaction factors. The factors defining the Quality Assurance rating are: a 
chart review including preventive health criteria and quality of medical record documentation; a site visit determination of 
the office environment, and the scope of services provided by the Primary Care Physician. The member satisfaction rating 
are based on the transfer rate of members to a different KHPC Primary Care Physician practice, the complaint rate per 
1000 members and the results of the member satisfaction survey. The Morbidity Index is based on the severity of illness of the population within the Primary Care Physician's practice. This 
measure is calculated using the Codman Research software. The Efficiency Index is based on the utilization of resources, adjusted for the severity of illness of the practice population. 
This measure is also calculated using the Codman Research software. "
198,34," Plaintiffs contend that technology has significantly increased the number of capitated injectable drugs that they are expected 
to provide, such that the cost far surpasses yearly capitation rates for some patient populations. Such an increase appears to be 
a factor of scientific progress rather than a misleading omission on the part of the defendants and an issue better suited for 
future contract negotiations. "
199,35," Because we must accept the facts as presented by the plaintiffs, we turn to their RICO Case Statement, which provides a 
cogent explanation of how the underlying payment system operates: Defendants contract with physicians and physicians groups - such as plaintiffs - to provide medical services to their insured 
members. These physicians and physicians groups . . . receive compensation for their services under two types of payment 
arrangements: (1) capitation, and (2) fee for services. Under the capitation arrangement, plaintiffs receive monthly ""Primary 
Capitation/Eligibility Statements . . . . (Plaintiffs' RICO Case Statement at 3-4)."
199,36," Defendants contend that the agreement authorizes them to change the amount to be paid by stating: ""It shall determined by 
KHP Central at the lower of the Primary Care Physician's actual charge, his/her filed fee as filed with KHP Central, or the 
prevailing fee for the applicable procedure as determined by Pennsylvania Blue Shield, or according to any applicable KHP 
Central reimbursement schedule."" However, we conclude that this provision is sufficiently broad and ambiguous to leave a question of fact as to what the 
appropriate payments should have been. "
200,37," As former Chief Judge Becker pointed out in Brokerage Concepts, Pennsylvania lacks an ""Any Willing Provider"" statute: Indeed, if Pennsylvania had such a law not only might the outcome of this suit, at least as it pertains to the RICO counts, be 
different, but it is likely that the underlying facts would never have occurred. Those facts, which demonstrate how heavy- "
201,," handed tactics can be effectively applied by a large corporation (U.S.Healthcare) against a small firm (Gary's) in this 
context, might suggest to the Pennsylvania General Assembly that it is time to enact an Any Willing Provider law in 
Pennsylvania. Brokerage Concepts, 140 F.3d at 526 n.22."
201,38," In a footnote in Brokerage Concepts, the Third Circuit alluded to the possible use of antitrust laws: This is also not a case where U.S. Healthcare exerted monopoly power in the market for pharmaceutical customers. Under 
such circumstances, the antitrust laws might well confer on Gary's the legal right to be free of the economic coercion arising 
from U.S. Healthcare's monopoly. However, we are not presented with such a case and thus do not opine on the potential 
success of such a theory. Brokerage Trust, 140 F.3d at 526 n.23. "
202,39," In their reply to plaintiffs' opposition to the motion to dismiss, defendants briefly suggest that plaintiffs have taken inconsistent 
positions as to whether ERISA preempts a claim for damages based on alleged delays in making payments and therefore the 
bribery claim should be dismissed. Defendants, however, do not fully explain their argument and cite no caselaw for support. 
Therefore, we do not consider it. "

222,*," Honorable Jane A. Restani, Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation. "
223,1," Liggett Group, Inc. is not a party to this action. 3"
223,2," As these labels suggest, the difference between these categories of cigarettes is simply one of price."
223,3," For example, between 1993-2000, over 90 of Lorillard's sales were in the premium market. "
224,4," For example, PM's income from operations dropped by more than $ 2 billion in 1993 alone. Moreover, on April 2, 1993 the 
stock of its parent company, now called Altria Group, Inc., plummeted from a price of $ 64 1/8 to $ 49 3/8, a 23 loss that reduced 
the company's market capitalization by approximately $ 13 billion."
224,5," As the district court recognized, and will be discussed infra, this statement is taken out of context. Broughton's full statement 
was that ""BAT may be one of those who started the price war in the U.S., but we have no wish to escalate it. But we shall be 
ready to respond tactically where necessary."" Williamson Oil Co. v. Philip Morris Cos., 231 F. Supp. 2d 1253, 1278 (N.D. Ga. 
2002) (emphasis added). "
225,6," There are 20 cigarettes in a standard pack and 10 packs (200 cigarettes) in a standard carton. Actually, RJR's November 8, 
1993 pricing action increased premium wholesale prices by approximately 4 from their post-Marlboro Friday levels and 
increased discount wholesale prices by approximately 5 from their post-Marlboro Friday levels. "
226,7," This allegation is distinct from the class's argument that appellees' adoption of permanent allocation programs was a signal to 
their competitors. However, appellees answer both of these allocation-based attacks in the same way, as explained infra."
226,8," Specifically, PM required its wholesale distributors to provide it with information concerning their shipments of all brands of 
cigarettes."
226,9, It is undisputed that since 1977 Lorillard has not participated in any of the foreign markets discussed by appellants. 
228,10," Although this meeting of the minds need not be formal, it must transpire."
228,11," We have observed that: An oligopoly differs from a monopoly in that no one firm can control the market price of a product merely by altering its own 
output. Where a market is highly concentrated, however, it is possible for sellers to share market power sufficient to control 
prices ""by recognizing their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output 
decisions."" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 227, 113 S. Ct. at 2590. ""Thus, the distinctive characteristic of oligopoly is "
229,," recognized interdependence among the leading firms: the profit-maximizing choice of price and output for one depends on 
the choices made by others."" IIA [Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 404a (2d ed. 2002)]. Bailey v. Allgas, Inc., 284 F.3d 1237, 1251 (11th Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). "
235,12," This is so regardless of the particular means by which PM's competitors could have attempted to re-widen the price gap. For 
example, they could have tried to (1) raise premium prices while keeping discount prices constant or lowering them; (2) keep 
premium prices constant while lowering discount prices; or (3) lower premium prices and lower discount prices even further. We 
note, however, that the revenue crunch created by Marlboro Friday rendered the last two options less feasible than the first."
235,13," Although the class argues that ""whether this statement, in conjunction with all the other evidence cited by Plaintiffs, permits the 
inference that Defendants agreed to fix prices is a question for the jury, not for the district court,"" this contention is wrong in a 
number of respects. First, the standard is not whether Broughton's statement ""permits the inference"" of conspiracy, but instead 
whether such an inference would be reasonable. In other words, we must ask whether this statement tends to exclude the 
possibility of independent behavior or, conversely, tends to establish a collusive price fixing arrangement. Second, this threshold 
question of the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the statement is a legal question that, under Matsushita, 
properly is addressed, at least initially, by the district court. "
237,14," This sixth factor was addressed briefly and quickly rejected as a plus factor by the district court. In sum, the class argued that: Major tort cases against [appellees] were settled in 1997. The shares of the initial payment (equal to about 1% of the total 
settlement) were computed on the companies' share of total market capitalization. Subsequent annual payments were 
allocated based on market share. [Appellants] argue that it was against the economic self-interest of Philip Morris to agree 
that the up-front payments be based on market capitalization rather than market share. Williamson Oil Co., 231 F. Supp. 2d at 1304. The court simply held that ""there is no evidence that Philip Morris could have 
settled on a more favorable basis at that time"" and that appellants' ""thesis [failed to] take into account all the known facts,"" and "
238,," consequently that PM's actions ""failed to create an inference of any sort."" Id. Not only does the class not challenge these 
conclusions, but also there does not appear to be any viable grounds on which they could be contested. "
239,15," To the extent that the class argues that PM's decision to follow the May, 1995 price increase was contrary to its own pricing 
plans, this argument is based on a mischaracterization of the comments of PM's CEO. According to appellants, the CEO said 
that ""we plan no price increase in 1995."" However, what the CEO actually said is ""we plan no price increase in 1995. . . . If the 
competitive environment changes significantly, however, we will respond immediately and appropriately."" Thus, as the district 
court noted, PM ""did not say under any circumstances would it not raise prices in 1995; it left open the need to respond to 
competitors' actions."" Williamson Oil Co., 231 F. Supp. 2d at 1303. "
240,16," Although Lorillard implemented its program prior to the alleged inception of the conspiracy, RJR did so in September, 1993; 
B&W in October, 1993; and PM in November, 1993."
240,17," RJR, B&W and Lorillard matched PM's increases. "
242,18," It is not perfectly clear whether the remaining factors addressed by the class are offered as plus factors or merely as evidence 
that the pricing decisions made by the manufacturers during the 1990s were not independent. Regardless, none of them 
constitute plus factors or are especially probative of collusive behavior. "
243,19, The testimony in question reads as follows: 
244,," Q: So, would I be correct, then, that one of the reasons for sending out the Telex price increase sooner rather than later is 
to let the trade know that there is some period of time until the effective date, and during that -- during which they have the 
opportunity to purchase at the old price? . . . . . A: No, that's not what I said. The practice -- more recent practice has been, when a Telex is sent out, the Telex states that 
the price increase is effective immediately. All goods ordered on Monday morning will carry the new price; you will be given 
a credit on a notional quantity that you purchased over the past six months on average, the average week's shipments over 
the past six months. So, there's no opportunity for the trade to order at the old price over some period of time. Williamson Oil Co., 231 F. Supp. 2d at 1274 n.11. "
246,20," Appellants also argue that the district court erred by ""dismissing"" Fisher's testimony and conclusions regarding appellees' 
adoption of permanent allocation programs as being contrary to their economic interests. To the extent that the class uses 
""dismissing"" synonymously with ""excluding,"" as in refusing to admit Fisher's testimony regarding the allocation programs, we 
evaluate their contention infra."
246,21," Specifically, the district court excluded Fisher's testimony that appellees' alleged signaling was indicative of collusive price 
fixing, see Williamson Oil Co., 231 F. Supp. 2d at 1277; that their adoption of permanent allocation programs was indicative of 
price fixing, see id. at 1288; and that their exchange of information through MSA was part of a price fixing conspiracy, see id. at 
1295-96. "
255,1," As Defendants keenly point out, Black's Law Dictionary defines the term ""gentlemen's agreements"" as ""unsigned and 
unenforceable agreements made between parties who expect its performance because of good faith."" Black's Law Dictionary at 
473 (6th ed. 1991). Nonetheless, the Court will interpret Plaintiff's description of these agreements as oral contracts between the 
parties. The enforceability of said agreements is a matter of law for the Court to resolve, not for the parties to establish through 
their casual characterizations."
255,2," Plaintiff has also brought suit against the individual Defendants Ramon Torres Morales and Juan Arruza Latimer. It is unclear 
from Plaintiff's complaint whether these Defendants are being sued in their official or personal capacities. To the extent that they 
are being sued in their official capacities, such a suit is equivalent to a suit against the Port of Ponce, which is also equivalent to 
a suit against the Municipality of Ponce, as will be discussed later. Since they are all one and the same, we will refer to all of 
these Defendants as the Port of Ponce. On the other hand, to the extent that Plaintiff intended to bring suit against these 
individual Defendants in their personal capacity, we note that there are no allegations in the complaint whatsoever which 
establish any actions by these Defendants which might be related to Plaintiff's alleged injuries. In fact, there are no specific 
allegations regarding these Defendants, other than the fact that they were the Director and Sub-director of the Port of Ponce. 
Under these circumstances, any causes of action against them must be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. "
256,3," On the other hand, we do not believe it would be appropriate to interpret that Plaintiff intended to sue Cemex Ten Investments, 
B.V. Plaintiff's complaint specifically states that the party sued under the name ""Cementos de Mexico, S.A. a/k/a Cemex"" is a 
corporation duly organized pursuant to the laws of the United States of Mexico. Cementos de Mexico, S.A. a/k/a Cemex, 
however, is a private company with limited liability organized and existing under the laws of the Netherlands. "
257,4," It should be noted that the bare allegations regarding tortious conduct of ""Cemex"" included in the complaint refer to the 
corporation which merged with PRCC, not to Defendant Cemex, S.A. de C.V. "
261,5," As mentioned in a previous footnote, Plaintiff has also brought suit against the individual Defendants Ramon Torres Morales 
and Juan Arruza Latimer. It is unclear from Plaintiff's complaint whether these Defendants are being sued in their official or 
personal capacities. To the extent that they are being sued in their official capacities, such a suit is equivalent to a suit against 
the Port of Ponce, which is also equivalent to a suit against the Municipality of Ponce, as will be discussed in more detail in this 
section of the Opinion and Order. Since all these Defendants are one and the same, we will refer to all of them as the Port of 
Ponce. "
263,6," Of course, Plaintiff's claims of conspiracy to monopolize against Defendant AYACOL must be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE 
since, having dismissed all monopoly claims against all other Defendants, there is no one left with whom Defendant AYACOL 
could have conspired to monopolize. "
264,7," The Court wishes to comment on one detail regarding said motions. All Defendants, but Defendants AYACOL and PRTC in 
particular, should be aware that, even though they did succeed in having their claims dismissed (or most of them, anyway), their 
failure to engage in discovery was in direct contravention to this Court's Case Management Order, which explicitly states that 
""the filing of dispositive motions does not disrupt the pretrial procedures or suspend the deadlines set herein."" Docket 
# 33 at 5. The only Defendants who had legitimate reasons to ignore the Court's Order and refuse to engage in discovery were 
Cemex, who was raising meritorious allegations regarding this Court's lack of personal jurisdiction over it, and the Government 
Defendants, who were raising the defense of immunity from suit. The other two Defendants' disregard of this Court's Order is, 
however, inexcusable. "
269,1," HN1[
] In ruling on these motions, I construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving parties and enter 
summary judgment only if the undisputed material facts demonstrate that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See 
Navarro v. Pfizer Corp., 261 F.3d 90, 94 (1st Cir. 2001). "
270,2," A dealer's days supply was ""calculated every day a sales report [was] generated by taking the total number of vehicles reported 
. . . minus allowable demos. This number [was] divided by the base sales rate established during the most recently concluded 
two complete industry months."" Defs.' App. at Tab 60, Eddy Aff., Ex. A."
270,3," Vehicles are also often equipped with accessories installed by Fuji Heavy Industries at the factory. I use the term ""accessories"" 
more narrowly to refer only to accessories installed after SNE receives a vehicle from SOA."
270,4, All dollar values cited in this Memorandum and Order are stated in 2001 dollars. 
271,5," A ""sold order"" results when a dealer sells a car that the dealer does not presently have on his lot, but that SNE lists in its 
inventory. The dealer submits the ""sold order"" to SNE for fulfillment."
271,6," I refer to both forms of conditioning collectively as SNE's ""conditioning practices."" "
272,7," SNE does not challenge plaintiffs' contention that it is an ""automobile manufacturer"" as that term is defined in the ADDCA. 
HN3[
] See 15 U.S.C. § 1221(a) (1998) (an automobile manufacturer is ""any person, partnership, corporation, association or other form of business enterprise engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of passenger cars, trucks, or station wagons, 
including any person, partnership, or corporation which acts for and is under the control of such manufacturer or assembler in 
connection with the distribution of said automotive vehicles""). "
273,8," Unlike the other New England states which leave the term ""coerce"" undefined, New Hampshire defines the term as HN6[
] 
""the failure to act in a fair and equitable manner in performing or complying with any terms or provisions of a franchise or 
agreement; provided, however, that recommendation, persuasion, urging or argument shall not be synonymous with 'coerce' or 
lack of 'good faith'."" RSA 357-C:1, XX."
273,9," Maine omits the comma: ""coerce or attempt to coerce."" Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1174(2) (1997 & Supp. 2002)."
273,10," The Maine Legislature amended the Maine dealer act in 1997 to also state that ""the allocation of new motor vehicles in the 
State must be made on a fair and equitable basis."" Maine Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1174(3)(A) (Supp. 2002). Plaintiffs do not 
base their dealer act claims on this provision."
273,11," The Massachusetts legislature amended the Massachusetts dealer act in 2002 to specifically allow distributers to use up to 
15% of all vehicles for discretionary purposes. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. Ch. 93B § 4(2)(b) (1997 & Supp. 2003). Since this 
amendment was not in effect during the class period, it does not alter my analysis."
273,12," These provisions were recodified by the 2002 amendment to the act. See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. Ch. 93B § 4(2)(b) (1997 & 
Supp. 2003). "
274,13," Plaintiffs have not offered a distinct argument based on the text of either the Connecticut dealer act, which makes it unlawful 
for a manufacturer to ""require"" the purchase of accessories, Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 42-133bb, or the Vermont dealer act, which 
makes it unlawful for a manufacturer to ""require or to coerce"" such purchases, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9 § 4096. This is understandable 
because, while neither act expressly requires proof of coercion, the accessory purchase provisions of both acts share the same 
legislative purpose as the other dealer acts at issue in this case: that is, to prevent manufacturers from using undue economic 
pressure to compel dealers to purchase accessories. Thus, while I recognize that a manufacturer would violate both states' acts 
if it required dealers to purchase accessories to obtain a dealership or to obtain something of value to which the dealer is 
otherwise entitled, I do not construe either act to ordinarily bar a manufacturer from requiring that dealers purchase accessories 
in order to obtain a benefit to which the dealer is not otherwise entitled. "
275,14," Plaintiffs also allege that initial allocation vehicles were not distributed fairly. While I agree that, if proved, such conduct might 
well be unlawful, I am not convinced that those claims are amenable to class action treatment. Since much of the evidence is 
anecdotal and dealer or district manager specific, I treat those allegations as category II claims, and analyze them below. "
277,15," Defendants dispute plaintiffs' claim that they were locked into the purchase of Subaru vehicles. To support their position, 
defendants note that Subaru dealers are free to own other dealerships; that they may terminate their dealerships at any time on 
60-days notice; that SNE must purchase most inventory and Subaru specific tools when a distributorship is terminated; and that 
dealerships and the real estate investments that have been made by dealers to develop their dealerships are readily saleable. 
While this argument may well have merit, I nevertheless accept for purposes of analysis plaintiffs' contention that they were 
contractually locked into the purchase of Subaru vehicles. "

308,12," Dr. Rausser computed nationwide end-payer damages attributable to an assumed eleven-month delay of the entry of generic 
versions of Cardizem CD. Plaintiffs claim that damages continued to accrue after generic competition began because CD prices 
continued to be higher than they would have been but for the delay of generic competition. Plaintiffs also claim that damages 
should be measured until the date in the future when the prices of CD are the same as they would have been without any delay 
of generic competition. Defendants contended, without conceding any liability, that If they were liable, the liability would have 
terminated when the Cardizem CD monopoly ended, or, alternatively, when Andrx's 180-day exclusivity period terminated. Dr. 
Rausser's analysis conservatively assumes that this date would occur 2.5 years after Andrx's generic entry. (9/19/03 Rausser 
Aff. P 6.) The damages period was certain to be a fiercely contested issue on summary judgment and/or trial. However, even 
with a longer damages period, the settlement amount represents a substantial recovery. For use in settlement negotiations, State Law Plaintiffs had expert economist, Cornerstone Research, Inc., prepare a damages 
analysis on a national basis and on a state-by-state basis. In those negotiations, State Law Plaintiffs disclosed to Defendants 
certain summary results of Cornerstone's analysis. among the results disclosed was Cornerstone's conclusion that, for the 
period July 1998 through a projected market equilibrium date in 2003, national aggregate single damages for consumer and third 
party payer class members in the 19 states under whose laws State Law Plaintiffs had asserted antitrust-related claims were in a 
range with a low end of $ 67 million. Assuming all United States consumers and third party payers had valid state law damages 
antitrust-related claims, Cornerstone estimated that aggregate damages for the four and one-half year damage period would be 
in a range with a low end of $ 150 million. (9/22/03 Lowey Decl. P 41.) These damages estimates were based on certain 
assumptions of fact that were hotly contested by Defendants and on which Plaintiffs would bear the burden of proof at trial. 
Mindful of these facts, the settlement amount compares favorably with the Cornerstone damages' estimates and represents a 
substantial recovery. "

350,9," The ""indirect-purchaser rule"" does not apply to New York's antitrust statute, the Donnelly Act. See N.Y. Gen. Bus. L. § 340(6) 
(""In any action pursuant to this section, the fact that the state, or any political subdivision or public authority of the state, or any 
person who has sustained damages by reason of violation of this section has not dealt directly with the defendant shall not bar 
or otherwise limit recovery[.]"")."
350,10," The reason for the double liability is that in Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Mach. Corp, 392 U.S. 481, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231, 88 S. 
Ct. 2224 (1968), the Supreme Court ruled that HN11[
] an innocent intermediary can recover the full amount caused by the 
antitrust violation, without deduction for the amount passed on to consumers. See II Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law § 
346, at 359 (2d ed. 2000)."
350,11," Several circuits recognize this exception to Illinois Brick where the co-conspirator of a defendant is named as a defendant in 
the same suit. See, e.g., Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193 (4th Cir. 2002); Link v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 
788 F.2d 918 (3rd Cir. 1986). "
351,12," It should be noted that if plaintiffs move to vacate the default judgments to amend their pleadings to name the sightholders as 
co-defendants, they must demonstrate that there are no other innocent intermediaries in the chain of distribution between 
DeBeers (and the sightholders) and the consumers. That is, if the sightholders do not themselves sell the diamonds and 
diamond jewelry to the consumers but rather to another party (a retailer or diamond cutter, for example), if that were the case the 
putative members of the class remain indirect purchasers of the conspirators and the problems identified in Illinois Brick remain. "
352,13," As part of the motion for class certification, plaintiffs submitted an affidavit by Professor Gilbert in which he stated that there 
are many ""well regarded"" economic tools, such as econometric analysis, that ""can be used to calculate, on a formulaic basis, the 
impact of Defendants' alleged activities on US diamond and diamond jewelry prices."" Gilbert Aff. 6/15/02, at 2. Judge Maas 
rejected this affidavit as conclusory."
352,14," Professor Gilbert also compared the year-to-year price changes for diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires over the period 
of 1983-1999, and found that the price of diamonds was less volatile than the price of emeralds, rubies, and sapphires (7.8% 
compared to respectively 28.3%, 19.8% and 34.3%). Professor Gilbert concluded that this difference in volatility reflects price 
stabilization through anti-competitive practices. "
353,15," Plaintiffs do not object to Judge Maas's determination that the requirements of Rule 23(a) were satisfied and this 
recommendation was not clearly erroneous. "
354,16," Plaintiffs argue that because their ""Third Claim for Relief"" only sought injunctive relief, it is ""not subject to the balancing test 
described in Robinson."" Plaintiffs clearly misconstrue the meaning of ""claim"" inRobinson; they also rewrite their pleadings. What 
they here denominate as the ""Third Claim for Relief"" is in fact listed in their Complaint as one of their ""Prayers for Relief."" The 
""claims"" in their Complaint refer to the specific laws which they allege DeBeers has violated -- i.e., ""claims"" used in the 
Complaint is synonymous with ""causes of action."" To follow plaintiffs' argument would entirely eviscerate Robinson, because a 
plaintiff could assure class certification under (b)(2) merely by delineating a request for injunctive relief in a paragraph separate 
from its claim for monetary damages."
354,17," Section 349(h) provides: HN25[
] Any person who has been injured by reason of any violation of this section may bring an action in his own name 
to enjoin such unlawful act or practice, an action to recover his actual damages or fifty dollars, whichever is greater, or both "
355,," such actions. The court may, in its discretion, increase the award of damages to an amount not to exceed three times the 
actual damages up to one thousand dollars, if the court finds the defendant willfully or knowingly violated this section. The 
court may award reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff."
355,18," The comments to 23(b)(3) add: ""It is only where this predominance exists that economies can be achieved by means of the 
class-action device. In this view a fraud perpetrated on numerous persons by the use of similar misrepresentations may be an 
appealing situation for a class action, and it may remain so despite the need, if liability is found, for separate determination of the 
damages suffered by individuals within the class."""
355,19," HN28[
] These management tools include: (1) bifurcating liability and damage trials with the same or different juries; (2) appointing a magistrate judge or special 
master to preside over individual damages proceedings; (3) decertifying the class after the liability trial and providing notice 
to class members concerning how they may proceed to prove damages; (4) creating subclasses; or (5) altering or 
amending the class. "

(285 Ill. App. 3d 542, 676 N.E.2d 228, 221 Ill. Dec. 707 [Ill App 1st Dist 1996]). The court stated that, even though the statute 
covers unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices, ""[t]here is no indication that the legislature 
intended that the Consumer Fraud Act be an additional antitrust mechanism,"" and allegations of the price-fixing agreement must 
be brought under the antitrust law and not under the consumer deception  [*26] act. Id. at 544 (internal quotations and citation

Corporation, et al. have filed a separate Opposition (""HCSC Opp'n"")."
384,2," All of the Plaintiffs mentioned in the instant motion originally filed one joint complaint, but later filed two separate Second 
Amended Complaints under the same civil action number [01-2646]. Subsequently, the Court directed on June 25, 2002 that 
Plaintiffs BCBS Minnesota, Federated, and BCBS Massachusetts be severed from civil action number 01-2646 and be assigned

385,3," Defendants also claim that HCSC has failed to state a claim under the Illinois Antitrust Act for Sales that occurred in Texas and 
New Mexico. This argument is discussed infra at 28-32. "
386,4," Defendants make the same argument regarding Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. 
Ct. 2540 (1982), which is cited at several points throughout this opinion. "
388,5," Based on the allegations in the Plaintiffs' complaints in this case, the Court finds that separate discussions of the first two AGC

393,6," The Defendants do not dispute that BCBS Massachusetts constitutes a ""person"" under this definition. "

412,2," Oklahoma law provides a mechanism for county commissioners to release designated lands from a water district. Under 82 
Okla. Stat. tit. 1991, § 1324.21, ""fifty-one percent . . . of the affected landowners may petition the county commissioners to 
release those lands from the district."" Upon review of that petition, if the Board of County Commissioners determines that ""the 
granting of the petition is to the best interests of the affected landowners and the affected district,"" id., then the designated lands 
are released, or ""deannexed"" from the water district's territory. "
417,3," See also Charles Wright and Arthur Miller, 18 B Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 4469.1 (2003) (""A decision not on the merits also does not 
oust federal jurisdiction to decide on the merits.""); Whiteford v. Reed, 155 F.3d 671, 674 (3d. Cir. 1998) (""This court has 
consistently held that where a state action does not reach the merits of a plaintiff's claims, then Rooker-Feldman does not 
deprive the federal court of jurisdiction."")."
417,4," We note also that unlike Rooker-Feldman, none of these doctrines goes to ""jurisdiction"" as the district court phrased it. Rather, 
preclusion doctrines provide affirmative defenses once a court exercises jurisdiction over a civil action, and they are subject to 
waiver where not timely raised. See, e.g., Horwitz v. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs of State of Colo., 822 F.2d 1508, 1512 (10th Cir. 
1987). "
422,5," The Senate Report of the bill that enacted § 1926 stated: This section would broaden the utility of this authority [of the Department of Agriculture to aid rural entities] somewhat by 
authorizing loans to associations serving farmers, ranchers, farm tenants, and other rural residents. This provision 
authorizes the very effective program of financing the installation and development of domestic water supplies and 
pipelines serving farmers and others in rural communities. By including service to other rural residents, the cost per user is 
decreased and the loans are more secure in addition to the community benefits of a safe and adequate supply of running 
household water. A new provision has been added to assist in protecting the territory served by such an association against 
competitive facilities, which might otherwise be developed with the expansion of the boundaries of municipal and other 
public bodies into an area served by the rural system. S. Rep. No. 566, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1961 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2243, 2309 (emphasis supplied). "
423,6," Thus, the § 1926 protections, to the extent Pitt-7 qualified for such protections, were established as of June 15, 1994, and not 
altered by the deannexation. Federal, not state law, controls the geographic scope of the § 1926 protections, which attach as of 
the entry into the loan agreement and remain as long as the conditions for § 1926 protection discussed above - FMHA 
indebtednesss and service ""made available"" - are met. We therefore need not address the parties' dispute concerning whether 
under Oklahoma law, water districts may only sell water within the district's borders. "
424,7," McAlester does not advance this argument regarding Group 3 customers, presumably because, since the § 1926 protections 
would have attached prior to the Group 3 customer sales, there were no customer relationships of McAlester's to ""take."" "
427,8," Aplt's App. at 819 (Brief in Support of Motion of Defendants City of McAlester and the McAlester Public Works Authority for

McAlester's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Response to McAlester's Statement of Undisputed Facts), filed April 13, 
2001). "
431,1," The plaintiffs also alleged violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1 and 2, Sections 2(a), (e), and (f) of 
the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 13(a), (e), (f), the Puerto Rican statute dealing with price discrimination, 10 L.P.R.A. § 
263, and the Puerto Rican statute dealing with transactions in restraint of trade, 10 L.P.R.A. § 258. The district court's decision is 
unchallenged with respect to these other claims. "
432,2," Tex-Shield is wholly owned by Blucher USA, which in turn is wholly owned by Blucher GmbH. Creative Apparel is, like DJM, a 
clothing and equipage manufacturer. Tex-Shield, the Cloth's sole supplier, also makes finished chemical and biological 
protective clothing. "
433,3," The Federal Anti-Dumping Act reads in pertinent part: It shall be unlawful for any person importing or assisting in importing any articles from any foreign country into the United 
States, commonly and systematically to import, sell or cause to be imported or sold such articles within the United States at 
a price substantially less than the actual market value or wholesale price of such articles, at the time of exportation to the 
United States, in the principal markets of the country of their production, or of other foreign countries to which they are 
commonly exported after adding to such market value or wholesale price, freight, duty, and other charges and expenses 
necessarily incident to the importation and sale thereof in the United States: Provided, That such act or acts be done with 
the intent of destroying or injuring an industry in the United States, or of preventing the establishment of an industry in the 
United States, or of restraining or monopolizing any part of trade and commerce in such articles in the United States."
433,15," U.S.C. § 72 (2003) (emphasis added). Clearly, the Puerto Rican legislature did not merely adopt the provision wholesale, but 
rather changed significant portions of it."
433,4," See Arturo Estrella, Antitrust Law in Puerto Rico, 28 Revista del Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico, 505, 624-25 (1968). "
434,5," We assume that the official translations included in the record contain all relevant portions of the legislative history. See, e.g., 
Estades Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am., 345 F.3d 25, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 20066, *11 (1st Cir. 2003) (reiterating that ""'this 
Court may not consider non-English documents unless a translation is provided'"") (quoting Ramos-Baez v. Bossolo-Lopez, 240 
F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir. 2001))."
434,6," Only Tex-Shield has provided excerpts of legislative history for this Court's consideration. In its response brief, DJM merely 
analyzes the excerpts provided by its opponents and does not bring to the Court's attention any other relevant portions of the 
legislative history. Previously, DJM relied on a plain language argument rather than resorting to legislative history, which 
certainly suggests that there is little or no history to support DJMs interpretation."
434,7," With regard to the issue of whether the statute applies to vertical competition, none of the excerpted portions of the legislative 
history brought to the Court's attention address the issue. We need not decide if the statute covers both vertical and horizontal 
competition, however, because we find that only cases involving the charging of lower prices in Puerto Rico can be brought 
under the provision. "
450,1," Under Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 
(1961) (Noerr), and its successive cases, concerted efforts to restrain trade by petitioning government officials and bodies are 
immune from antitrust liability. "
452,2," In arguing that Sessions is inapplicable, see Sherman Act Resp. Memo. at 32-34, Plaintiffs focus erroneously on the parts of 
the decision that do not involve causation, namely the discussion of Noerr immunity and the question of antitrust injury. They fail 
to refute Defendants' interpretation of the causation analysis and fail to offer competing case law."
452,3," Plaintiffs contend that Handgards is inapplicable because it was a case brought under § 2 of the Sherman Act, not § 1. 
However, the discussion in Handgards about antitrust injury is in general terms, as evidenced by the fact that Brunswick, the 
case upon which it relies, was an antitrust action brought under the Clayton Act. Moreover, Plaintiffs fail to identify a single Ninth 
Circuit decision discussing causation under § 1, or any alternative controlling case law upon which the Court should rely. "
453,4," Although the NFPA's rejection of the proposed 781 standard and retention of NFPA 780 are related, Plaintiffs admitted at the 
hearing that the mere retention of 780 (despite the Plaintiffs' efforts to have it withdrawn) does not giver rise to an antitrust claim. 
In particular, Plaintiffs provide no evidence of injury or damages flowing from the NFPA's decision not to withdraw 780. To do so, 
Plaintiffs would have to present evidence of a but-for market where there were no NFPA standards at all. As discussed in Part C, 
concerning Mr. Guth's expert report, Mr. Guth performed no such calculations, and Plaintiffs present no such evidence. "
454,5," The date at which the NFPA Technical Meeting Convention Rules, attached as Exh. 35 to PSOF, were passed is unclear from 
the document and related testimony. Also, Defendants have moved to strike PSOF P71, 72, and 154 regarding the prohibition 
on handouts. The Court has relied on the underlying testimony rather than Plaintiffs' characterization in their SOF."
454,6," Plaintiffs are correct that HN11[
] ex post approval by a standards-setting organization does not provide conclusive evidence 
of propriety of a member's anticompetitive actions. See American Soc. of Mech. Engineers, Inc. v. Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 
556, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 S. Ct. 1935 (1982) (liability found even where standards-setting organization decided that all 
members had acted properly). Hydrolevel, however, is not exactly analogous, because it involved a case where a member's 
actions were vicariously imputed to the organization itself, such that the organization was essentially conducting an investigation 
into the propriety of its own conduct. The NFPA's investigation here was an investigation into whether third parties violated 
NFPA procedures. "
455,7," Defendants have moved to strike some of the Statement of Facts in support of these allegations. PSOF P107, claiming that 
Heary Bros. was not informed of LPI's comment solicitation efforts, is unsupported by the evidence and will be stricken. Larsen 
testified only that he personally never informed Kenneth Heary of the solicitation. PSOF P108, claiming that LPI solicited 
negative comments, is a speculative characterization of what occurred and will be stricken. Though a jury could infer that LPI 
desired negative comments, there is no admissible record evidence that they specifically sought them out. PSOF P117, 
describing Thompson's funding to New Mexico Tech, will not be stricken because it is supported by the record. See Steffes 
6/2/93 letter, Exh. 58 to PSOF. "
456,8," Defendants have moved to strike PSOF P27, which is the evidence supporting the allegation that LPI encourages its members 
to participate on the 780 Committee. This statement will be stricken, because the only evidence in the record is a fax from 
Thompson to LPI enclosing a draft letter, upon which the statement is based. Plaintiffs have not proven that the letter was sent, 
and there is no evidence upon which a jury may reasonably infer such a fact."
456,9," The Court notes that Rison is not a named Defendant or a paid expert for any Defendant, although his attendance at the NFPA 
meeting was financed by Defendants. It is therefore unclear whether Defendants may be held liable for his statements. The 
Court need not resolve that question, because, as discussed below, the sum total of alleged improprieties in insufficient to 
support a finding of causation. "
457,10," Defendants have moved to strike PSOF P205 because it is a deposition taken from prior litigation. However, Steffes himself 
was present at the deposition, taken on behalf of LPI, and he offered part of the transcript as an exhibit to his Affidavit. 
Therefore, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4), other parts of the deposition should be considered ""in fairness."" What is more, it is 
admissible as not hearsay because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Fed. R. Evid. 801. "
458,11," Even if Plaintiffs could show that the NFPA had somehow discouraged or prevented Plaintiffs from presenting their case to the 
membership, that fact would not necessarily show liability on the part of Defendants, since it would only show that the NFPA, 
which is not a Defendant, intervened to alter the outcome of the floor vote. "
462,12," Heary Bros. claimed lost profits from a failed agreement with Home Depot to supply residential and small business kits for 
installing ESE systems. Id. at 20. In 1994, while NFPA was being evaluated, Heary Bros. negotiated with Home Depot a draft 
contract to supply these kits. Id. According to this document, Heary Bros. would supply Home Depot with 5000 kits during the 
second quarter of 1995 at a unit price of $ 400. Id. Mr. Guth estimated that at Heary Bros.'s average profit margin of 18%, Heary 
Bros. would have made a profit of approximately $ 360,000. Id. at 21. However, because 781 was not issued, the agreement 
was not implemented. Id. To analyze damages, Mr. Guth estimated the present value of the Home Depot agreement opportunity 
beginning in 1995, producing estimates ranging from $ 2,979,180 to $ 3,624,793. (Id.) "
463,13," The Supreme Court blurred the lines between methodology and conclusion in Joiner v. Gen. Elec. Co. by stating that 
HN16[
] ""conclusions and methodology are not entirely distinct from one another. . . . A court may conclude that there is simply 
too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered."" 522 U.S. 136, 146, 139 L. Ed. 2d 508, 118 S. Ct. 512 
(1997). "
465,14," The Court recognizes that Mr. Guth disclaims following a particular ""model,"" maintaining that he merely used ""a relationship 
from the Cournot model."" Guth Aff. PP21, 23. As explained below, Mr. Guth did not use a unitary economic model for every facet 
of his damages calculation. The Court's use of the term ""Cournot model"" recognizes that Mr. Guth did not use a unitary model, 
but that, as he admits, he used the economic relationship that forms the foundation of the Cournot model in performing one 
aspect of his calculations."
465,15," In support of their motion, Defendants submit the Affidavit of James R. Kearl, an expert economist. Exh. 1 to Daubert Motion. 
The Court's explanation in informed by Mr. Kearl's analysis in addition to the parties' and Mr. Guth's arguments and analysis. "
466,16," At the hearing, Plaintiffs also advanced the argument that the difference between the Heary and NLPC market share can be 
explained by production capacity. Plaintiffs cite footnote 34 of the original report, but that footnote does not mention capacity. 
Indeed, the Court cannot identify any portion of Mr. Guth's report or affidavit where he explains how capacity would affect the 
economic model, which, as discussed above, considers only a limited number of variables. "
469,17," Specifically, the Court will strike the following paragraphs of Mr. Heary's July Affidavit, insofar as they profess a legal 
conclusion: PP4-6; P7; first sentence of P8; P9; first sentence of P31; P32; P35. Plaintiffs contend that Mr. Heary may profess 
his ""understanding"" of East Coast's allegations and legal arguments. "
470,18," The Fiske letter states that ""it is important to note that ITS does not draft standards nor does it guarantee safely of products. 
ITS only evaluates products according to established standards that were developed for purposes of safety."" Exh. L to EC 
SSOF. The Feeney letter indicates that ""the tests performed by ITS, pursuant to the draft NFPA 781 standard (now withdrawn) 
do not confirm Heary Bros.' claims of a 'zone of protection. . .' Since Heary Bros.' mathematical formula has not been accepted 
or adopted by a national standards organization such as the NFPA, ITS did not and cannot certify or confirm Heary Bros.' 'zone 
of protection' claims."" Exh. N to EC SSOF (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs point out that the second letter is directed at an 
independent lightning protection distributor, not Heary/LPA, but that objection is not relevant to evaluating ETS' opinion 
regarding its testing results, Plaintiffs' formula, and an alleged zone of protection. "
471,19," Plaintiffs' Statements of Facts which are based on this evidence will be stricken as well. The Court will strike PP5, 6 of 
Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Fact in Support of their Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. # 245]."
471,20," At times, Plaintiffs allude to the testimony of Gerard Berger, who at one time was disclosed as an expert witness, but who now 
is offered only as a fact witness. Any testimony of the scientific or technical underpinnings of a foreign standard would require 
specialized scientific knowledge. Plaintiffs have withdrawn Dr. Berger as an expert witness, so his testimony is not admissible in 
that regard. "
472,21," Mr. Heary volunteers that the submitted portions of the Technical Manual were ""downloaded from the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers website,"" but provides no pinpoint citation. Heary Supp. Aff. P10. The document is available at 
http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/armytm/tm5-689."
472,22," Rule 803(8)(A)and (C) provide the most relevant hearsay exceptions. The Army Manual is clearly not admissible as a 
business record pursuant to Rule 803(6) because Plaintiffs offer no evidence of a regularly conducted business activity nor the 
testimony of a custodian or otherwise qualified witness. Also, Rule 803(8)(B) does not apply because Plaintiffs provide no 
evidence of a ""duty imposed by law as to which matter there was a duty to report."" "
474,23," In their Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs also alleged that the same literally false advertising statements supported a 
claim for common law unfair competition. At the hearing, the parties clarified that these common law unfair competition claims 
were also abandoned along with the common law claims discussed in Part V. "
475,24," Plaintiffs also allude to representations made by NFPA about the 780 standard in 1997 or 2000, and though the relevance of 
these statements is unclear, it is uncontested that the NFPA's position did not change in the year before the summary judgment 
motions were filed. "
477,25," Certainly, the Court is not prepared to conclude that Plaintiffs' counsel is inept and incapable of perceiving the merit and 
quality of its claims and arguments. "
481,1," The Malley plaintiffs have fully settled and compromised their claims against the defendants and their joint motion to dismiss 
their action with prejudice was granted by an Order dated September 16, 2003. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide no mechanism by which a ruling that issues exist for trial can be obtained. The 
plaintiffs' motion seeking that ruling will be regarded as in furtherance of their opposition to the defendants' motion for partial 
summary judgment."
481,2," On May 6, 2002, the Seventh Circuit affirmed Judge Kocoras's grant of the wholesaler's motion for summary judgment, which 
dismissed the individual plaintiffs' claims against them. In re BNPD Antitrust Litig., 288 F.3d 1028, 1032-35 (7th Cir. 2002) 
(holding evidence insufficient to show that wholesalers knew of manufacturers' alleged conspiracy to price discriminate between 
retailers and hospitals (and HMOs) via chargeback system)."
481,3," However, the individual plaintiffs raise an additional claim based on a boycott theory which the Court addressed in a 
Memorandum and Order dated August 21, 2002. "
483,4," A defendant may also withdraw from a conspiracy by reporting the conspiracy to the authorities. See United States v. Borelli, 
336 F.2d 376, 388 (2d Cir. 1964) (withdrawal requires an affirmative action, which may be ""the making of a clean breast to the 
authorities.""); accord United States v. Greenfield, 44 F.3d 1141, 1149-50 (2d Cir. 1995)."
483,5," The law of withdrawal from a conspiracy has developed primarily in the criminal context; however the same standard has been 
applied to civil conspiracy cases. See, e.g., Morton's Mkt., 198 F.3d at 838. (11th Cir. 1999) (applying Gypsum principles in 
considering withdrawal from an alleged civil antitrust conspiracy); In re BNPD Antitrust Litig., 123 F.3d 599, 616 (7th Cir. 1997) 
(same)."
483,6," The defendants do, however, dispute plaintiffs' contention that they were ""precluded"" from participating in the settlement 
proceedings based on the fact that sixty- four (64) pharmacies that were part of the Boies/Gravante group (who neglected to 
timely opt-out of the class) raised objections to the Amended Settlement, which Judge Kocoras considered and rejected. (See 
Def. Opp'n Br. to Mot. for Ruling and for Expedited Discovery at 6-7.) In addition, the individual plaintiffs could have intervened in 
the class action with respect to the Amended Settlement Agreement, but chose not to. See In re BNPD Antitrust Litig., 115 F.3d "
484,456," (7th Cir. 1997) (dismissing the opt-out plaintiffs' appeal from the Amended Settlement Agreement because they failed to 
intervene in the district court). "
506,1," The term ""base commissions,"" which are at the heart of this litigation, refers to a payment by an airline to a travel agent of a 
percentage of the price of the ticket sold by the travel agent to a consumer. Dep. of Steve Sear (Northwest) (""Sear Dep."") at 38. 
Base commissions historically were publicly available information, were paid to all travel agents regardless of an agent's sales 
volume on a particular airline, and, after deregulation, were a payment set by each airline without any individual negotiations 
between the airline and the travel agent. Travel agents may also earn additional commissions from an airline under an 
individually negotiated incentive contract. These additional commissions, also known as ""overrides,"" are considered ""quite 
proprietary airline by airline."" Gunn Dep. at 68; see also Dep. of William Brunger (Continental) (""Brunger Dep."") at 74-75; Dep. of 
Adolfo Lenza (Northwest) (""Lenza Dep."") at 74; Dep. of Sean Menke (Frontier) (""Merike Dep."") at 75."
506,2," This allegation was previously the subject of a motion to strike made by United and other defendants, which the court denied, 
finding that the allegation was relevant to plaintiffs' contention that a ""reduction in commission rates would be contrary to 
defendants' economic interest if done unilaterally and independently."" Order of 22 Feb. 2001 at 7. As evidenced from the 
language quoted by the court, United has acknowledged the commission action and subsequent rescission in its answer, but "
507,," has essentially denied that the rescission was because other airlines did not match the action. However, the court will assume 
this to be the case for the purposes of the instant motions for several reasons. First, as a general matter, evidence on a 
summary judgment motion is to be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Second, United has 
acknowledged that when it ""reverted back"" to percentage base commissions, it was aware that no other airline had matched the 
cut. Dep. of Christopher Bowers (United) (""Bowers Dep."") at 72-73. Third, the court notes that United only moved to strike the 
allegation on the ground that it is a ""'superfluous historical allegation""' with ""no connection . . . [to] the charges of a conspiracy on 
commissions"" in the instant litigation, 8/1/00 Mem. Supp. Mot. Strike at 4, which is not an attack on the accuracy of the 
allegation. Finally, there is more than adequate evidence that airlines considering initiating base commission reductions would 
likely rescind those cuts if they were not matched by competitors, and airlines considering matching base commission cuts did 
not think the implemented cuts could be sustained in the marketplace absent substantial matching. Bowers Dep. at 28-29; Dep. 
of Theresa Fox (US Air) (""Fox Dep."") at 36; Gunn Dep. at 74-76, 109-110; Sear Dep. at 27."
507,3," While the DOT report ""does not immunize [defendants] from antitrust liability, [it is] entitled to weight in considering whether 
[plaintiffs have] stated a claim."" Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. v. British Airways PLC, 872 F. Supp. 52, 63 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 1994). "
509,4," AirTran Holdings, Inc., is named as a defendant in plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint. ""AirTran Holdings, Inc., is a holding 
company that itself conducts no [airline] operations,"" AirTran's Br. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. at 1 n. 1, and the court questions the 
viability of plaintiffs' claims against this defendant on that basis alone. However, AirTran did not brief the court on this issue, and 
in fact has chosen ""to proceed as if other AirTran entities are included in the litigation"" id and the court will also proceed 
accordingly."
509,5," At this point, the court reminds the parties that although it previously held, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, that a delayed 
""interval between alleged conspiratorial acts cannot"" prove that those acts were not parallel, Order of 16 August 2002 at 11-12, 
the court also noted at that time that the same defendant ""might be able to show at the summary judgment stage that [a] . . . 
commission reduction was consistent with rational, unilateral conduct and was not part of a pattern of uniform business 
practices"" id at 12. Therefore, the court considers this and other defendants' arguments regarding delays between commission 
actions not as dispositive of whether they indicate independent action, but rather, whether they indicate independent action 
when considered in combination with other evidence."
509,6," Pursuant to the court's order filed 9 January 2003, plaintiffs filed one brief in opposition to five individual motions for summary 
judgment brought by defendants AirTran, America West, Frontier, Midwest Express, and Alaska. This brief was not to exceed 42 
pages. While the brief itself is only 41 pages long, the court notes that it makes numerous, substantive references to plaintiffs' 
brief in opposition to the joint motion for summary judgment. See e.g., Pls.' Br. Opp. at 8 (referring the court to pages 19-24 of 
their other brief), 9 (referring the court to pages 15-19 and 27-37 of their other brief), 10 (referring the court to pages 27-29 of 
their other brief), 11 (referring the court to pages 34-37 of their other brief), 12 (referring the court to pages 63-65 of their other 
brief), and 15. Not only does this essentially lengthen plaintiff's brief well beyond the allotted 42 pages, it also forces the court to 
jump back and forth between two different briefs and two sets of exhibits, as plaintiffs have not only cited to argument contained 
in their other brief, but also to ""portions of the record cited therein."""
509,7," ""The ATP litigation"" refers to the case of United States v. Airline Tariff Pub. Co. 836 F. Supp. 9 (D.D.C. 1993), in which the 
United States brought an action against eight domestic airlines and the Airline Tariff Publishing Company (""ATP""), alleging that 
the defendants used ATP's fare dissemination system to fix airline ticket prices in violation of the Sherman Act by ""signaling"" 
other airlines on desired price changes. The term ""signaling"" is described in more detail infra at n. 15. The ATP litigation was 
resolved by entry of a consent judgment enjoining defendants from engaging in certain practices ""without trial or adjudication of 
any issue of fact or law, . . . . [which] shall not be evidence against or an admission by any party with respect to any issue of fact 
or law."" U.S. v. Airline Tariff Pub. Co., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11904, No. 92-2854 (SSH), 1994 WL 502091 at *1 (D.D.C. Aug. 
10, 1994)."
509,8," Tad Hutcheson, AirTran's Director of Marketing, is perhaps the best example of the weakness of plaintiffs' allegations against 
AirTran. The court notes that he came to work for AirTran in June 1997, three months before the September 1997 commission 
cut that triggered this litigation, from KIWI International Air Lines, who is not a party to this litigation, nor apparently to any of the "
510,," prior litigations. See Pls.' Br. Opp., Exh. PX1167. Plaintiffs point to the fact that Mr. Hutcheson has also worked in the ""planning 
and marketing departments at Delta Air Lines"" but fail to show how Mr. Hutcheson could possibly have been involved in any of 
the conspiratorial activity alleged by plaintiffs."
510,9, It appears that plaintiffs did not depose anyone at AirTran. See AirTran's Reply Br. at 3.
510,10," While the instant motions were pending before the court, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals decided this case on appeal by 
published opinion, ""affirming in all respects the district court's final summary judgment in favor of the [defendants]."" Williamson 
Oil, 346 F.3d 1287, 1323. The Eleventh Circuit specifically noted that ""the district court's treatment of the wealth of complicated 
issues in this case was nuanced, insightful and, ultimately, correct."" 346 F.3d 1287, 1291. Therefore, the court cites to the district 
court and appellate court opinions as appropriate. A copy of the Eleventh Circuit opinion was furnished to the court by the joint 
defendants on 24 September 2003 pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(g). On 6 October 2003, plaintiffs filed a ""Response to Defendants' 
Notice of Supplemental Authority"" questioning the applicability of the opinion to the motions before the court on several grounds, 
including an argument that the Eleventh Circuit's analysis would be incorrect under Fourth Circuit standards. See Pls.' 10/6/03 
Resp. at 3 (arguing the Eleventh Circuit does not recognize certain plus factors that are recognized in the Fourth Circuit). 
Plaintiffs' arguments will be addressed in more detail infra but the court sets the issue out here briefly to note that the court 
agrees with plaintiffs' response to the extent that it states that Fourth Circuit analysis is binding on the court, and that the court 
applies Fourth Circuit analysis even when citing to other case law it finds persuasive and applicable."
510,11," The PTCC is a conference within the IATA. For a more complete explanation of the history and purposes of the IATA and 
PTCC, see Joint Defs.' App. III (8 October 2002 Report of Joint Defs.' Exp. Witness Bert W. Rein (""Rein Report""))."
510,12," Specifically, plaintiffs point to base commission cuts and caps which occurred after meetings of these various organizations in 
support of their contention that these organizations facilitated antitrust activity. See Pls.' Br. Opp. at 8-9; Pls' Br. Opp. Joint Mot. "
511,," at 12. However, if Alaska did not join these organizations or attend these meetings, it is difficult to see how it could have the 
opportunity to conspire on travel agent commissions. Furthermore, ""opportunity to conspire"" without a showing of actual 
conspiracy is insufficient to create a plus factor which would survive summary judgment. See infra p. 19."
511,13," Plaintiffs also assert that Alaska is a ""'Domestic Airline Partner[] . . . in the Hotwire web site, an Orbitz partner launched in 
October 2000"" through the membership of its affiliate Aloha Airlines, Pls.' Br. Opp. at 8, but it appears that this assertion is 
incorrect. See Alaska's Reply Br., Exh. 1, Tab C (listing Hotwire Domestic Airline Partners and noting that Alaska is not listed as 
an airline having an agreement with Aloha Air). Plaintiffs also state that Alaska ""is an alliance partner with American, Northwest, 
KLM, and Continental."" Pls.' Br. Opp. at 21. Although the court is uncertain of the meaning of the term ""alliance partner,"" and 
plaintiffs neither elaborate on the meaning of this term nor demonstrate how being in such an alliance tends to exclude the 
possibility that Alaska engaged in unilateral conduct, Alaska states that these ""alliances"" are ""simply . . . code-sharing 
arrangements with those (and certain other) airlines on specific routes,"" Alaska's Reply Br. at 7, and the court is satisfied that 
this argument in opposition to the motion for summary judgment is without merit."
511,14," According to plaintiffs, the time between a major airline's decision to cut commissions and Frontier's decision to do so ranged 
from 18 days to 6 1/2 months. Pls.' Br. Opp. at 4. Plaintiffs' own economic expert only states that ""no . . . analysis or 
consideration [of the risks and benefits of reducing base commissions] could take place within the day or two that transpired 
before most rival airlines followed the leader's action to reduce commissions."" 8/20/02 Comanor Report at 17 (emphasis added). "
512,15," HN8[
] ""'Signaling' is a pejorative term as used in this context. Its import is either that a competitor is inviting all to make a 
traditional price-fixing agreement, or that there already exists such an agreement and it is being carried out through indirect 
communications."" Williamson Oil Co., 231 F. Supp. 2d at 1275."
512,16," America West's base commission cuts appear to have occurred within a range of three days to two years after other airlines 
decided to make base commission cuts. See Pls.' Br. Opp. at 4; America West's Reply Br. at 6. Plaintiffs' comment that America 
West's base commission cuts, which occurred shortly after a major airline's initial announcement, could not possibly have been 
made after a careful analysis because ""according to Frontier, at least a month would be needed to evaluate share gains from 
paying higher commissions,"" Pls.' Br. Opp. at 18 (citing Menke Dep. at 50-51, 53-54), is completely unconvincing. There is 
absolutely no evidence before the court that such a time frame is an industry standard, or even that any other airline would 
agree with the Frontier executive who made that statement. The statement also contradicts plaintiffs' own expert witness as 
discussed supra n. 14. "

1992)(citing Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2722). See also Merck-Medco, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21487, 
1999 WL 691840 at **4. "
514,18," In their 6 October 2003 response, plaintiffs specifically disagree with this portion of the Williamson Oil opinion, stating that it 
""conflicts directly with the Fourth Circuit's enumeration of 'opportunity to conspire' and 'high level of interfirm communications' as 
a plus factor in the Merck-Medco decision."" Pls.' 10/6/03 Resp. at 4 (italics in original). Even if plaintiffs are correct, the evidence 
they have produced is insufficient to overcome the motion(s) for summary judgment under the holding in Merck-Medco. In that 
case, the plaintiff produced evidence of ""over 450 instances of contact [in approximately 3 1/2 months] between defendants and 
others,"" and were able to show a direct correlation between those contacts and defendants' desire to thwart plaintiff's efforts to 
secure a contract for the prescription drug benefits program for employees of the State of Maryland, but still were unable to 
preduce evidence to support an inference of concerted action. Merck-Medco, 1999 U.S. App. LEXIS 21487, 1999 WL 691840 at 
**3, **14. Plaintiffs here have merely shown occasional trade association meetings, such as IATA meetings that occurred 
approximately once a year, and meetings of the board of directors for Orbitz, which take place ""every three months or so,"" 
Caminiti Dep. at 14. Not only are these instances of contact far more infrequent, they also are not convincingly related to the 
conspiracy alleged by plaintiffs absent some speculative inferences."
514,19," The court considers this motion immediately prior to the joint motion, because Northwest and KLM are two of the joint 
defendants, because it is undisputed that they expressly agreed on travel agent commissions in the U.S. on international flights 
that they operated together, and because the only question is whether their concerted action is in violation of antitrust law 
and/or a grant of immunity issued by the DOT in 1993."
514,20," Plaintiffs appear to dispute only the first prong; the court notes that the DOT Order contemplates continued supervision, as it 
requires Northwest and KLM to ""submit [any]. . . subsidiary agreements implementing the . . . Agreement for prior approval."" 
DOT Order at 21. "
515,21," To the extent plaintiffs offer evidence that Northwest views the Agreement as permitting it ""to make decisions [regarding 
commissions] for KLM out of North America,"" Sear Dep. at 51-52, this likewise is within the purview of the DOT and well outside 
the scope of the instant litigation before the court, which is limited to alleged antitrust activity in setting base commissions for 
travel agents in the U.S. It may also be outside the subject matter jurisdiction of this court. See Turicentro, S.A. v. American 
Airlines, Inc., 303 F.3d 293 (3rd Cir. 2002)(alleged conspiracy by domestic airlines to fix commissions paid to foreign travel 
agents, where the conspiracy caused no injury which was felt in the U.S. or which affected the American economy in any way, is 
outside the subject matter jurisdiction of the United States courts under the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, 15 U.S.C. 
§ 6a)."
515,2," American and Delta both joined in the joint motion and filed separate motions for summary judgment, but the separate motions 
were accompanied only by declarations and state that they are relying upon the memorandum filed in support of the joint motion. 
Therefore, the court will not consider these motions separately from the joint motion, and will include the declarations in the 
evidence in support of the joint motion. In addition, as the court briefly noted in its introduction, plaintiffs have filed a motion for 
partial summary judgment against Northwest and KLM, two of the joint defendants. "
516,23," However, this does not mean that the defendants agreed to cut commissions by ""offer and acceptance"" as plaintiffs contend. 
Pls.' Br. Opp. Joint Mot. at 24. HN13[
] ""The public announcement of a pricing decision cannot be twisted into an invitation or 
signal to conspire; it is instead an economic reality to which all other competitors must react."" United States v. General Motors, 
1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6569, 1974 Trade Cas. P 75253 (E.D. Mich. 1974). Furthermore, plaintiffs' reliance on the Supreme 
Court's holding in Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 83 L. Ed. 610, 59 S. Ct. 467 (1939), in support of their ""offer 
and acceptance"" theory is misplaced. In Interstate Circuit there was evidence of written proposals seeking agreement to 
concerted action, which were followed by a ""substantial unaninuty of action, J"" and the Supreme Court concluded that the district 
court had correctly inferred an agreement from that evidence. Interstate Circuit, 306 U.S. at 216 n.3, 221. Here, plaintiffs have no 
evidence even approaching the level of evidence before the court in Interstate Circuit. See also Williamson Oil Co., 231 F. Supp. 
2d at 1276 (noting that ""the cases which have found that an inference of traditional agreement from indirect communications 
took place show far more detailed communications [than public announcements] with no public purpose"")(citing In re Medical X-

Antitrust Litig., 906 F.2d 432, 459-60 (9th Cir. 1990)). "
517,24," Furthermore, Mr. Rein's report indicates that plaintiffs' characterizations of the PTCC display a fundamental misunderstanding 
of the PTCC's activities. For example, although plaintiffs insinuate that the public filing of PTCC resolutions with the DOT 
somehow facilitates an antitrust conspiracy among the defendants, the PTCC files these resolutions because it is required to do 
so by United States law. Rein Report at 10. In addition, the court is not even convinced that these commission resolutions 
constitute agreements in restraint of trade under the Sherman Act, because U.S. carriers are not required to follow them, and the 
resolutions are only effective under a rule of unanimity."" ""[A] unilateral decision by a single carrier to oppose revalidation [of a 
resolution] amounts to a veto causing a rescission of the resolution . . . . Members . . . that are no longer supportive of a 
resolution are likely to act in the manner they are proposing regardless of whether the PTCC follows their recommendation."" 
Rein Report at 3-4, 15. Because any PTCC member may unilaterally choose to discontinue following a resolution, the court is 
unconvinced by plaintiffs' argument that the IATA's removal of Resolution 016a (which set a base commission of 9 percent for 
travel agents outside the United States) from the handbook for Canadian travel agents before the resolution was actually 
rescinded indicates that ""IATA was aware that the airlines had agreed on what the result [of the proposed rescission] would be."" 
Pls.' Br. Opp. Joint Mot. at 16-17. As plaintiffs concede, Air Canada had proposed the rescission of Resolution 016a, Pls.' Br. 
Opp. Joint Mot. at 17, and therefore there was no reason for the IATA to believe that Resolution 016a would continue to be "
518,," followed in Canada. ""Neither IATA nor the PTCC has an enforcement mechanism . . . . [and] any carrier, by itself, can cause the 
rescission of a resolution at such time that it no longer wishes to have that resolution in effect."" Rein Report at 4."
518,25," The joint defendants particularly dispute this last argument as being ""plainly wrong."" Joint Defs.' Reply Br. at 11 n.9. Without 
deciding whether it is wrong, the court finds it to be unpersuasive. "
520,26," Lufthansa and Air Canada also filed motions (D.E. # 5 718, 722) for summary judgment. Plaintiffs filed one response to the 
three foreign carrier motions. As previously stated, Lufthansa has been dismissed pursuant to a settlement agreement, and the 
case is stayed as to Air Canada due to its bankruptcy, and therefore the court considers only Air France's motion."
520,27," As with many of the smaller defendant airlines, plaintiffs do not contend that Air France joined in the alleged conspiracy at its 
inception in 1995, but instead allege ""that [Air France] . . . knowingly joined the continuing conspiracy initiated by the major 
airlines, and then actively assisted and participated in that conspiracy, specifically through the IATA meetings in 1997, 1998, and 
1999."" Pls.' Br. Opp. Fgn. Mots. at 26. "

530,3," In support of their Motion to Dismiss, defendants also contend that the Complaint must be dismissed on substantive grounds 
because: (1) the possible loss of future business opportunities is not actionable contractual interference under 42 U.S.C. § 1981; 
(2) plaintiff's New York human rights claim under N.Y. EXEC. LAW § 290 et seq. fails because she did not allege facts 
establishing the requisite employment relationship; (3) plaintiff's tortious interference with prospective business claim fails 
because she did not demonstrate defendants' interference with an existing business relationship between plaintiff and a specific, 
identifiable third party; (4) plaintiff's slander claim fails to allege who made the statements, when they were made and to whom 
they were made; (5) plaintiff lacks standing to bring a private federal or state antitrust action because she does not allege 
adequate antitrust injury in the form of damages to the competitive market; (6) defendants lack the capacity to conspire with 
each other to violate the Sherman Act; and (7) the medical profession is exempt from liability under New York state antitrust 
law. (Defs. Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 8-9, 11, 13-14, 25.) We dismiss plaintiff's Complaint in its entirety as a result of: (1) her 
failure to file her claim initially with the PHC pursuant to N.Y. PUB. HEALTH LAW § 2801-b; and (2) her failure to allege who 
made the slanderous statements, when they were made and to whom. Accordingly, we need not reach defendants' other

548,6," For a detailed history of the syndicate system in the United States, this Court refers to then-District Judge Harold Medina's 
learned opinion in Morgan, 118 F. Supp. at 635-55. Briefly, a company desiring to sell stock to the public (an ""issuer"") hires an 
investment bank (the ""managing underwriter"") to effect the public distribution of shares at a fixed price agreed upon by the issuer 
and the managing underwriter (the ""offering price""). In almost all instances, the offering price is set below the estimated market 
value of the stock to ensure its attractiveness to purchasers. The managing underwriter organizes an underwriting syndicate, 
which is a consortium of investment banks responsible for distributing shares to the public. The syndicate members make a 
concurrent public offering of the issuer's shares at the offering price, with uniform concessions at each level of the distribution.

In Rothery Storage, the court held the independent stakeholder exemption did not apply to agents of common carriers who 
served on the board of directors for a van line because common carriers are exempt from Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and 
Congress passed no statute expressly applying the independent stakeholder exemption to them. Id. at 226. Fur Breeders 
contends that, like common carriers, cooperatives are exempt from Section 1 and no statute has been passed expressly 
applying the independent stakeholder exemption to cooperatives. Because we are able to easily resolve this issue applying the 
independent stakeholder exemption, we decline to address this argument on appeal, thereby leaving it for future resolution."

the benefit of all their members to the detriment of outside competitors or entities which were not members of the cooperatives. 
Specifically, they attack Fur Breeders' reliance on Green, 692 F.2d at 1155; Sunkist Growers, 370 U.S. 19, 8 L. Ed. 2d 305, 82 
S. Ct. 1130; United Egg Producers, 312 F. Supp. 319; and United States v. Maryland Co-op. Milk Producers, Inc., 145 F. Supp. 
151 (D.D.C. 1956). However, we find the fundamental principles in Green and the other cases instructive in determining whether 
Fur Breeder and its board members are shielded by the Clayton and Capper-Volstead Acts and whether their actions fall within 
the independent stakeholder exception. Moreover, the Bells' argument contradicts their own reliance on cases that also involve 
restraint of trade affecting outside competitors and entities. Relying on National Broiler Mktg. Ass'n, 436 U.S. 816, 56 L. Ed. 2d 
728, 98 S. Ct. 2122; United States v. Topco Assoc., 405 U.S. 596, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972); United States v. 
Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238, 87 S. Ct. 1847 (1967); Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers, 362 U.S. 458, 4 L. Ed. 
2d 880, 80 S. Ct. 847; Alexander v. Nat'l Farmers Org., 687 F.2d 1173 (8th Cir. 1982); Greenville Publ'g, 496 F.2d 391; Knuth v. 
Erie-Crawford Dairy Co- op. Ass'n, 395 F.2d 420 (3d Cir. 1968) (subsequent negative history omitted)."
571,7," Fur Breeders contends that if the Bells' ranch were included in the delivery route: 1) the cooperative's actual delivery costs 
would increase anywhere from $ 25,000 to $ 80,000 annually, depending on the number of days the Bells required delivery each 
week, and 2) an additional truck and driver would be required because the route's deliveries could not be completed in one day, 
thereby further increasing its costs. On the other hand, if instead Fur Breeders paid the Bells the estimated hauling costs they 
are claiming, the cost to the cooperative increase $ 16,787.20 annually. Thus, regardless of whether Fur Breeders paid the Bells 
their estimated hauling costs or extended the delivery route to their ranch, the cooperative's costs would substantially increase. "
572,8," The Bells also argue the district court erred because he applied equitable principles, rather than antitrust law, in granting 
summary judgment to Fur Breeders. In support, they rely solely on the judge's comment at the summary judgment hearing that if 
Fur Breeders paid Jack Bell's actual costs rather than reducing the price of picked-up feed by the average cost of delivery, ""all 
the other members end up subsidizing him because of his distance."" We reject the Bells' argument as this is not the only 
grounds on which the district court judge based his decision. Even without considering the subsidy issue, we find sufficient other 
grounds exist to support the district court's decision. See Roederer, 11 F.3d at 977. Moreover, the district court's statement on 
subsidizing the Bells was not improper. One of the cooperative's written goals, articulated in its ""Board Discussion Item,"" is to 
ensure members do not subsidize each other with respect to feed costs. "
573,9," Relying on FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U.S. 536, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1385, 80 S. Ct. 1267 (1960); Black Gold, Ltd. v. Rockwool

583,1," In its response, Gulfstream asked this Court to grant Gulfstream summary judgment on counts 1 and 2 (preemption) of its 
second amended complaint. "
584,2," In addition, the State of Florida, and a number of greyhound racetracks, jai alai frontons, and Ocala Breeder Sales, Inc. (a 
training facility) intervened as Defendants in this action. The three intervening defendants (the two pari-mutuel groups and the 
State of Florida) joined in TBD's motion for summary judgment with respect to counts 1, 2, and 3 (preemption and enforceability 
of exclusive dissemination agreements) of Gulfstream's second amended complaint (Dkts. # 133, 140, 145)."
584,3," Ocala Breeder Sales, Inc. does not conduct a pari-mutuel sport, but is a training facility."
584,4," The types of non-live wagering that can be conducted at a pari-mutuel venue are simplified and presented here from the 
perspective of someone who wants to wager on thoroughbred horse racing. There are other ITW and ITWS wagers available on 
other pari-mutuel sports, but those sports have their own complex and detailed regulations. Thoroughbred horse racing was 
utilized in this Order because horse racing is the pari-mutuel sport most relevant to this dispute."
584,5, Gulfstream is not allowed to accept ITWS or ITW wagers when it is not conducting live racing.
584,6," The second and third categories of wagering are referred to as ""simulcasting."" See Fla. Stat. § 550.002(32)"
584,7," From a technical perspective, however, the out-of-state racetracks simulcast their races through satellite television signals to 
the in-state racetracks and the ITWS sites. Simulcasting through use of satellite signals to both the in-state racetracks and ITWS 
sites is relatively new to the pari-mutuel industry. Previously, signals were transmitted to the in-state racetracks via cable and re-
transmitted to the ITWS sites. Now, out-of-state racetracks provide decoders to the authorized venues that allow them to 
unscramble their signals."
584,8," Only four of the thoroughbred racetracks are currently offering live races: TBD, Gulfstream, Calder Race Course, Inc., and 
Tropical Park, Inc. "
585,9," In addition, two of the four racetracks, Calder and Tropical Park, are owned by the same corporate parent and have in recent 
times operated out of the same racetrack."
585,10," HN4[
] The ITWS sites place wagers electronically, which are transmitted first to the in-state racetrack's totalisator and then 
to the out-of-state racetrack's totalisator. A ""totalisator"" is a computer system that is ""used to accumulate wagers, record sales, 
calculate payoffs, and display wagering data"" in a pari-mutuel facility. Fla. Stat. § 550.002(36)."
585,11," ""Full card"" simulcasting refers to unlimited simulcasting."
585,12," The number of tracks (and number of locations) that were subject to exclusive dissemination agreements increased over time. 
In 2003, Gulfstream had fourteen exclusive dissemination agreements. Six of the 2003 exclusive dissemination agreements 
were with racetracks that are owned or controlled by Gulfstream's parent company, Magna Entertainment Corp. (""Magna"")"
585,13," Calder Race Course, Inc. and Tropical Park, Inc. also obtained or attempted to obtain exclusive dissemination agreements 
beginning in 2000. Their exclusive dissemination addendum is identical to the one utilized by Gulfstream. For the 2002-2003 
racing season, Calder and Tropical Park received exclusive dissemination rights from approximately eleven out-of-state 
racetracks. For example, Fair Grounds Corp. granted Tropical Park and Calder exclusive dissemination rights from December 
11, 2002 through January 2, 2003. TBD operated during this time period. During the 2002-2003 season, Calder and Tropical 
Park's racing season overlapped TBD's racing season for a total of thirty days. TBD's racing season in 2002-2003 lasted one 
hundred thirty four days."
585,14," Except for with Fair Grounds Corp.'s simulcast contract, the addendum was attached to the Racing Industry Uniform Simulcast 
Wagering Agreement, Version 002 (the ""Uniform Agreement""). In relevant part, the Uniform Agreement contains a clause in 
Section 17(L) addressing ""Third Parties."" Section 17(L) states that: Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is intended to confer any rights or remedies under or by reason of 
this Agreement on any person other than the Parties, the Host and Guest Racing Commissions, and their respective 
successors and permitted transferees and assigns, nor is anything in this Agreement intended to relieve or discharge the 
obligation or liability of any third persons to any Party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision give any third person any 
right of subrogation or action over or against any Party to this Agreement. However, whenever this Agreement requires or "
586,," contemplates action by a third party, such action shall not be an obligation of a Party to this Agreement unless expressly 
stated therein, but only a condition of the obligations of the obligations of the Parties hereto. Fair Grounds had its own contract to which the addendum was attached. Fair Grounds' contract does not contain a provision 
either providing for or restricting third party beneficiaries."
586,15," The Uniform Agreement contains a limited license for the in-state thoroughbred racetrack to use and retransmit the out-of-
state racetrack's copyrighted material. For example, neither Gulfstream nor TBD were assigned the ability to enforce an out-of-
state racetrack's copyrights."
586,16, Calder and Tropical Park undertook similar actions in response to outside ITWS sites wagering through TBD.
586,17," In 1997, TBD filed a similar complaint with the Division about Gulfstream's exclusive dissemination agreements. The Division 
concluded that, at that time, it was ""unable to assist"" TBD. The research memoranda attached to the Division's opinion letter 
addressed the potential liability for Florida for undertaking any action against Gulfstream's dissemination agreements. The 
research memoranda do not provide an alternate interpretation for the applicable statutes and rule."
586,18," None of the racetracks are a party to this dispute. It is also undisputed that none of the out-of-state racetracks have registered 
any copyrights on any simulcasts. "
587,19," Gulfstream spends an inordinate amount of time in its response to TBD's motion for summary judgment on count 3, discussing 
whether TBD complied with its simulcast agreements with out-of-state racetracks and violated the IHA. This Court would note 
that whether TBD complied with its simulcast agreements is completely irrelevant to the enforceability of Gulfstream's exclusive 
dissemination agreements. Further, Section 3005 of the IHA does not allow Gulfstream to bring an action for damages against 
TBD under the IHA. See 15 U.S.C. § 3005. "
588,20," HN11[
] Florida Administrative Code rule 61D-9.001(1)(b) states in relevant part: ""no permitholder shall enter a contractual agreement that is in violation of, or may be construed as waiving, the requirements of these rules or Chapter 550, Florida 
Statutes."" "
589,21," HN13[
] Section 550.3551(5) reads: A pari-mutuel permitholder licensed under this chapter may not receive broadcasts of races or games from outside this 
state except from an out-of-state pari-mutuel permitholder who holds the same type or class of pari-mutuel permit as the 
pari-mutuel permitholder licensed under this chapter who intends to receive the broadcast. Fla. Stat. § 550.3551(5)."
589,22," Gulfstream also argues that it did not restrain TBD from transmitting its signal. However, Gulfstream's own president testified 
that the purpose of getting exclusive dissemination agreements was to exclude TBD from competition in providing ITWS signals 
and wagering to the outside ITWS sites. See Dep. of Scott Savin, Vol. I, at 49. Based on his testimony, this Court concludes that 
Gulfstream's exclusive dissemination agreements violate Section 550.615(3) and Rule 61D-9.001(1)(b)."
589,23," HN15[
] To the extent that Section 550.6305(9)(g)(1) requires dissemination by an in-state thoroughbred track to an ITWS site within sixty miles of another in-state thoroughbred racetrack currently conducting live races, 15 U.S.C. § 3004(b)'s approval 
requirement can be read in without creating a conflict with Florida Statutes Section 550.6305(9)(g)(1)."

590,26," Numerous of the corporate representatives for the out-of-state racetracks stated that it did not matter to them between 
Gulfstream or TBD who disseminated their simulcast signal for interstate wagering to the outside ITWS sites."
590,27, Count 1 of TBD's counterclaim sought declaratory relief on both the copyright preemption and enforceability issues.
590,28," In its response to TBD's motion for summary judgment, Gulfstream argued that two additional sections of Chapter 550 
(Sections 550.6305(10), 550.6305(11)) are preempted by the Copyright Act. Gulfstream's second amended complaint makes no 
reference to these sections, and the deadline for amending pleadings has expired. This Court declines to consider whether 
either Section 550.6305(10)or 550.6305(11) are preempted by the Copyright Act. This Court would note that neither section is 
directly implicated by the allegations contained in the second amended complaint. For example, Section 550.6305(10) only 
applies to races conducted at an in-state racetrack and does not apply to a re-broadcast of an out-of-state horse race. See Fla. 
Stat. § 550.6305(10)."

] The Copyright Act then limits this preemptive effect by excluding certain rights or remedies that arise under the 
common law or state statutes, including any rule or statute that provides a right or remedy that is not equivalent to any exclusive 
copyright right. 17 U.S.C. § 301(b). Courts have interpreted that limitation as not preempting various causes of action that have "

Copyright Act."
591,32," If this Court concluded that the Florida laws were preempted, the remaining provisions regulating the pari-mutuel industry 
would also be invalid. Fla. Stat. § 550.71."
591,33," The IHA regulates the relationships between out-of-state racetracks, in-state racetracks, both state gaming authorities, and 
both racetracks' horsemen groups. The Florida laws regulate the relationship between the in-state racetracks and the ITWS 
sites."

managers. Guth proposed that such a discrete choice survey of ultimate bettors be performed to determine the relevant market, 
but TBD elected not to pursue such a survey. Instead, Christiansen's conclusion was based upon his experience in the gambling 
industry and results of six informal, unscientific interviews with presidents or general managers of Defendants."
595,40," While this Court is using the term ""price,"" in actuality what is at issue in this case is the percentage of the net proceeds (the 
amount of the takeout after certain amounts are deducted) that an ITWS site receives. Florida statutorily mandates that ITWS 
sites receive thirty three percent (with several statutory exceptions who receive more). See Fla. Stat. § 550.6305(9)(b). TBD 
claims that in the future in-state thoroughbred racetracks will share a higher percentage of net proceeds with ITWS sites when 
the in-state racetracks compete. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 550.6305(9)(c)."

649,10," It should be noted that this issue of the availability of a “pass-on defense” in antitrust law still remains an open question in 
California, at least according to the only case that has cited to B.W.I. Custom Kitchen, supra, 191 Cal. App. 3d 1341, on this 
point, Basurco v. 21st Century Insurance Company (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 110, 120 [133 Cal. Rptr. 2d 367]. At this class 
certification stage of the action, we need not address this issue on the merits. However, we will also be referring to it in part II.B, 
post, as it arises in the context of whether the proponents of the class have made an adequate showing that they can prove "
650,," classwide injury as indirect purchasers of copper products. (See also In re Methionine Antitrust Litigation (2001) 204 F.R.D. 161, 
166.) "
661,*," Honorable William H. Stafford, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation. "
662,1," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides in relevant part: HN1[
] Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an 
agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the 
cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. 15 U.S.C. § 15(a)."
662,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: HN2[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal. 15 U.S.C. § 1."
662,3," The text of Rule 23(b)(3) is quoted in this opinion at infra, n.13."
662,4," The class originally certified by the district court in its September 20, 2001 Order Granting Plaintiffs' Consolidated Motion for 
Class Certification encompassed ""all purchasers of both brand name and generic drugs who also purchased terazosin 
hydrochloride directly from Abbot at any time during the period commencing March 31, 1998, through the time when the illegal 
agreements terminated."" In re Terazosin Hydrochloride, 203 F.R.D. at 560-61. The district court subsequently amended this 
order, and redefined the class as ""all entities who purchased Hytrin, also known by the chemical name terazosin hydrochloride, 
directly from Abbot at any time during the period commencing March 31, 1998, through August 13, 1999."" See id. at 561."
662,5," Rule 23(f) provides: HN3[
] A court of appeals may in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying class 
action certification under this rule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of the order. An appeal does not stay 
proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f)."
662,6," Geneva did not originally join the Rule 23(f) application brought by Abbot and Zenith because it had reached a potential 
settlement with plaintiffs. That settlement fell through, however, and Geneva subsequently moved to join in this appeal. Zenith 
later reached a tentative settlement of its own with the plaintiffs and consequently withdrew from the appeal before the parties 
submitted their briefs to this court. "
663,7," Valley Drug reversed a separate ruling by the district court that condemned the two settlement agreements entered into by 
Abbot and Zenith and Abbot and Geneva as per se violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 344 F.3d at 1304."
663,8," The relevant statute here is the Drug Price Competition & Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 
1585 (1984) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. § 355). This act, which modifies the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 
301-91 (""FDCA""), is generally referred to as the ""Hatch-Waxman Amendments."" As noted by this court in Valley Drug, the Hatch-
Waxman Amendments set forth the legal rules established by Congress to promote competition between companies that 
pioneer the development of a new drug and companies that develop generic substitutes. 334 F.3d at 1298. Pursuant to the 
amendments, a company that includes in its application a ""paragraph IV certification"" (which certifies that the relevant patents 
challenged by the applicant are invalid or will not be infringed) must notify the original patent holder of its challenge. Id. Once 
notification is received, the statute provides the owner of the challenged patent with the right to bring a lawsuit against the 
challenging party within a certain time period (45 days) in order to delay FDA approval of the generic drug manufacturer's 
application. Id. 344 F.3d at 1298."
663,9," Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, applications for FDA approval of a new drug can be filed in one of two ways: as 
a new drug application (""NDA"") under § 355(b) or as an ANDA certification under § 355(j). An ANDA applicant is entitled to rely 
on the safety and efficacy studies filed with the application of a drug already listed and recorded by the FDA in the so-called 
""orange book."" Id. "
664,10," The Hatch-Waxman Amendments create a strong incentive for a generic competitor to be the first to file an ANDA and receive 
FDA approval: a 180-day period of marketing exclusivity vis-a-vis other generic competitors. In other words, the first filer to 
receive FDA approval is entitled to market the generic versions of the drug for 180 days without competition from any other 
generic drug manufacturers. This period of exclusivity does not begin, however, until any related patent litigation is resolved. 
Prior to 1998, the FDA's ""successful defense"" regulation provided an additional twist on winning the 180-day exclusivity prize: if 
a second or subsequent generic drug manufacturer files an ANDA and successfully defends itself against a patent infringement 
challenge by the branded-drug manufacturer before the first filer, the 180-day exclusive marketing period is no longer an option 
for the first filer. The second filer can then enter the market first, but is not entitled to the period of exclusivity the first filer would 
have received had it prevailed first in its own challenge of the branded-drug manufacturer's patents. The successful defense 
requirement was eventually held to be an unreasonable interpretation of the Hatch-Waxman Act by two courts of appeal. See 
Mova Pharm. Corp. v. Shalala, 329 U.S. App. D.C. 341, 140 F.3d 1060, 1069-70 (D.C.Cir.1998); Granutec, Inc. v. Shalala, 46 
U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1398 (4th Cir. 1998) (unpublished, table decision reported at 139 F.3d 889). After being enjoined from 
enforcing the regulation by the Mova court, the FDA dropped the requirement effective November 10, 1998. See Valley Drug, 
344 F.3d at 1301, n.12."
664,11," As noted previously at infra, n.7, we reversed this decision of the district court in Valley Drug, 344 F.3d at 1298. "
665,12," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981."
665,13," In their entirety, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b) state: HN7[
] (a) Prerequisites to a Class Action. One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties 
on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of 
law or fact common to the class, (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or 
defenses of the class, and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. HN8[
] (b) Class Actions Maintainable. An action may be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of subdivision 
(a) are satisfied, and in addition: (1) the prosecution of separate actions by or against individual members of the class would create a risk of (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would establish incompatible 
standards of conduct for the party opposing the class, or (B) adjudications with respect to individual members of the class which would as a practical matter be dispositive of the 
interests of the other members not parties to the adjudications or substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their 
interests; or (2) the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, thereby making 
appropriate final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class as a whole; or (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to the members of the class predominate over any questions 
affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient 
adjudication of the controversy. The matters pertinent to the findings include: (A) the interest of members of the class in 
individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning 
the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of 
concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be encountered in the 
management of a class action. Fed.R.Civ.P.23(a) and (b). "
666,14," Rule 23(c)(1) provides: HN11[
] As soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action, the court shall determine 
by order whether it is to be so maintained. An order under this subdivision may be conditional, and may be altered or 
amended before the decision on the merits. Fed. R.Civ. P. 23(c)(1)."
666,15," HN12[
] Although the trial court should not determine the merits of the plaintiffs' claim at the class certification stage, the trial court can and should consider the merits of the case to the degree necessary to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 
will be satisfied. See, e.g., Gen. Tel. Co. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 2372, 72 L. Ed. 2d 740 (1982)."
666,16," In its brief discussion of whether the proposed class satisfied the ""adequacy of representation"" inquiry, the district court stated, 
""the defendants have not reported any actual or apparent conflicts of interest between Louisiana Wholesale or Valley Drug and 
the proposed class."" In re Terazosin Hydrochloride II, 203 F.R.D. at 555. This statement cannot be reconciled with the record 
of this case which indicates that one of Abbot's primary arguments throughout the course of the litigation is that some of the 
class members actually benefitted from the allegedly illegal settlement agreements because they profited more from selling 
branded Hytrin in the absence of generic competition than they would have from selling Hytrin in combination with generic 
terazosin hydrochloride drugs at lower prices. That Abbot may not have couched its arguments to the district court in terms 
directly applicable to Rule 23(a) does not mean that it failed to report any actual or apparent conflicts because the substance of 
Abbot's position is that a conflict existed among the class members. At any rate, the burden to prove whether class certification 
is appropriate rests on the plaintiffs: thus Abbot can hardly be deemed to have ""waived"" its Rule 23(a) challenge as plaintiffs 
contend. "
667,17," In Pickett, cattle producers acting on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated brought claims against Iowa Beef 
Processors, Inc. (""IBP""), under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C. § 192, alleging that ""forward contracts"" or ""marketing 
agreements"" employed by the defendant constituted illegal, unfair business practices. 209 F.3d at 1278. Because the class 
certified consisted of ""all cattle producers who had sold fed cattle directly to IBP,"" it included producers who had benefitted from 
the forward contracts as well as those who claimed harm. Id. at 1277, 1280."
667,18," As of 1996, there were six national wholesalers: McKesson HBOC (""McKesson""), AmeriSource, Bergen-Brunswig, Cardinal, 
Foxmeyer, and Bindley Western Industries (""BWI""). Foxmeyer subsequently filed for bankruptcy in August 1996 and McKesson 
acquired its assets. See In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12534, No. 94 C 897, 
MDL 997 (N.D.Ill.Aug. 6, 1998). AmeriSource and Bergen-Brunswig later merged, as have Cardinal and BWI, resulting in only 
three national wholesalers existing today, all of whom are included in the class certified by the district court. "
668,19," Because both parties have raised the issue in their brief, HN16[
] it is worth noting that a distinction can and should be drawn 
between the cost-plus contracts employed in this industry and the cost-plus exception discussed by the Supreme Court in 
Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968), and in Kansas v. 
UtiliCorp United Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990). Although the defendants have noted that industry 
buyers negotiate contracts on a ""cost-plus"" basis, the fact that the buyers employ this terminology does not in and of itself 
establish that the pharmaceutical industry would be covered by the cost-plus exception from the Hanover Shoe rule. Accord 
UtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 216, 110 S. Ct. at 2817 (""The rationales underlying Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick will not apply with 
equal force in all cases. We nonetheless believe that ample justification exists for our stated decision not to 'carve out exceptions 
to the [direct purchaser] rule for particular types of markets.'"") (quoting Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 744, 97 S. Ct. 
2061, 2071, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977) (alteration in original). "
670,20," We note that the three national drug wholesalers--McKesson, Cardinal, and Bergen-Brunswig--are sophisticated businesses 
that are more than capable of bringing a suit on their own behalf: each of these companies has been ranked in the top 100 of the 
recent Fortune 500 list. Given the high level of sophistication of the national drug wholesalers, these entities do not suffer a 
hardship from not being included in the proposed class because they are very able to proceed with individual claims if they feel 
they have been harmed. Accord, Ansari v. New York University, 179 F.R.D. 112, 115 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) HN22[
] (adequate 
financial resources of class members considered as a factor that weighs against the need for class certification)."
670,21," Because the issue is not expressly before the court, we do not rule on the question of whether those class members who 
potentially experienced a net gain from defendant's conduct can form a class of their own to challenge the defendants for their 
alleged antitrust violations. Although we do not reach this issue, we believe the holdings of the Supreme Court in Hanover Shoe 
and Illinois Brick make this the likely conclusion provided the other prongs of Rule 23(a) are satisfied and at least one of the 
three alternative requirements under Rule 23(b) are met. "
671,22," Even if we assume ex arguendo that all of the plaintiff class members share one common interest, e.g., vindicating the nation's 
antitrust laws, this common interest alone would not be sufficient to satisfy Rule 23(a)(4) because a fundamental conflict still 
exists where the actual economic interests and objectives of the class members diverge because some members experienced a 
net benefit from the defendant's conduct while others are harmed. See Pickett, 209 F.3d at 1280; See Phillips, 502 F.2d at 366-
67; Cf., Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32, 44-45, 61 S. Ct. 115, 119-20, 85 L. Ed. 22 (1940) HN23[
] (""It is one thing to say that 
some members of a class may represent other members in a litigation where the sole and common interest of the class in the 
litigation, is either to assert a common right or to challenge an asserted obligation. It is quite another to hold that all those who 
are free alternatively either to assert rights or to challenge them are of a single class, so that any group, merely because it is of 
the class so constituted, may be deemed adequately to represent any others of the class. . . . Such a selection of 
representatives for purposes of litigation, whose substantial interests are not necessarily or even probably the same as those 
whom they are deemed to present, does not afford that protection to absent parties which due process requires.""). "
686,1," Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) provides, in relevant part, HN12[
] ""In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting 
fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity."" "
691,2," The Court notes, however, that this unfortunate ""misnomer"" has developed a life of its own. Initially, courts were careful in 
referring to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine only by analogy when discussing the First Amendment right to petition. See e.g., WE, 
Inc., 174 F.3d at 326-27 (""This court, along with other courts, has by analogy extended the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to offer 
protection to citizens' petitioning activities in contexts outside the antitrust area as well."") (emphasis added) (emphasis added); 
Eaton v. Newport Bd. of Educ., 975 F.2d 292 (6th Cir. 1992) (finding ""support by analogy to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine"" that 
immunity extends to petitioning activity) (emphasis added). However, courts and practitioners citing those initial cases have 
loosely referred to the immunity afforded by the Petition Clause as the ""Noerr-Pennington"" doctrine. Consequently, there is a 
marked inconsistency in the manner in which immunity afforded by the First Amendment is discussed."
691,3," Since the Court finds that the Petition Clause does not afford DIRECTV immunity from suit, the Court finds it unnecessary to 
decide whether the prelitigation threats communicated in the EUDG demand letters constitute or implicate a ""petition"" to the 
government. "
713,1," The trial court quoted § 123 in its reasons; § 122 provides in pertinent part as follows: ""every . . . conspiracy in restraint of trade 
or commerce in this state is illegal."" La. R.S. 51:122. "
714,2," A third, mid-level category has been recognized called the ""quick look"" rule. See Continental Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, 
Inc., 277 F.3d 499, 508-09 (4th Cir. 2002)(noting that boundaries between the three categories are fluid). This category reflects 
the ""recent decisions indicating a tension between a per se rule and a more flexible approach."" 10 A Fletcher Cyc. Corp. § 4973 
(Perm. Ed.). This category, however, is not applicable to this case. "
719,3," The minority position is articulated in Monument Builders of Grdeater Kansas City, Inc. v. American Cemetery Ass'n, 891 F.2d 
1473, 1484 (10th Cir. 1989), which held that ""'conspiracy to monopolize is a separate offense under Section 2, requiring less in 
the way of proof than the other Section 2 offenses"" and cited as an example that ""the 'market power in a 'relevant market' need 
not be proved.'"" Id. "
734,1," Plaintiffs name the following distributors as defendants in this action: Columbia Pictures, Walt Disney, Universal Studios, 
Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Fox Entertainment Group, and Dreamworks. "
735,2," In an impressive display of compound words, plaintiffs define TCFs as ""newly-released first-run industry-anticipated top-
grossing commercial films."" (Compl. P 2.)"
735,3," For a list of the distributors named as defendants, see supra note 1."
735,4, Kaplan and Karsh are also named as defendants in this action. 
738,5," Du Pont, 353 U.S. at 595-96, cited by plaintiffs, does not contradict this view: there, the relevant geographic market was 
defined as the national product market for automotive finishes and fabrics, in which plaintiff was a participant. See also R.C. 
Bigelow, Inc. v. Unilever N.V., 867 F.2d 102, 103-04 (2d Cir. 1989) (national product market for tea). Similarly, in Blue Shield of 
Virginia v. McCready, the Supreme Court held that although the plaintiff, a consumer of psychotherapy services, was not a 
competitor in the health insurance market, she was clearly a consumer in the relevant market, and was therefore ""within that 
area of the economy endangered by that breakdown of competitive conditions"" resulting from defendant's conduct. 457 U.S. 
465, 480-81, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982) (internal quotations omitted). Although McCready undoubtedly broadened 
the Court's approach to standing cases in terms of the allowable market role of the plaintiff, it did not alter the Court's prior 
holdings as to the relevant geographic market. See Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. at 622 (""The relevant geographic market or 
appropriate section of the country is the area in which the acquired firm is an actual competitor.""). Other cases cited by plaintiffs in which parties have been afforded standing involved vertical mergers in which the acquisition 
itself threatened to deprive the plaintiff of an input plaintiff needed in the relevant geographic product market. See Six West 
Retail Acquisition, Inc. v. Sony Theater Management Corp., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2604, 2000 WL 264295, at *22-*24 (S.D.N.Y. 
Mar. 9, 2002); Yankees Entertainment Sports Network, LLC v. Cablevision Sys. Corp., 224 F. Supp. 2d 657 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), or 
involved mergers where plaintiff was an imminent entrant into the relevant geographic product market, see McCaw Pers. 
Communications, Inc. v. Pacific Telesis Group, 645 F. Supp. 1166, 1170 (N.D. Cal. 1986)."
738,6," The regions in which the mergers took place include Washington D.C., Chicago, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, 
Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Virginia, Arkansas, New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, the Pacific Northwest, and Nevada (Compl. PP 62, 67, 68); countries listed include the United States, Canada, 
and even South Korea (Compl. P 62). Defendants argue that these markets are not sufficiently defined in the complaint for 
purposes of pleading a violation of section 7. (Exhib. Br. 12-16.) Because plaintiffs lack antitrust standing, the question of the 
sufficiency of plaintiffs' pleadings in this respect need not be reached. "
739,7," Admittedly, of the cases cited above, none except Tasty Baking addressed precisely such a scenario. See 653 F. Supp. 1250. 
And, as plaintiffs urge, Tasty Baking arguably could be read more broadly to apply section 7 liability to situations where a 
competitor removes competition in one market to reap monopoly profits in another, unrelated market. However, to the extent that 
it may be read to stand for this proposition, the Court declines to apply its reasoning to the instant case for the reasons outlined 
in Part I-B, below. "
741,8," In considering the question of antitrust standing, the Supreme Court has likened the analysis to that of proximate cause. See 
Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 761, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977); Crimpers Promotions, 724 F.2d at 294. 
Such an analysis is consistent with the finding here that plaintiffs' injuries are simply too remote in ""the chain of causation"" to 
confer standing. See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S. at 540. "
742,9," However, plaintiffs have fairly alleged the underlying Sherman Act violations making up the separate components of group 
boycott, that is, the vertical agreement between exhibitors and distributors and the separate horizontal conspiracy between Onex 
and Oaktree. See Valley Disposal, Inc. v. Central Vermont Solid Waste Management Dist., 31 F.3d 89, 94--95 (2d Cir. 1994) 
(plaintiff must allege facts which, if proved, would directly or inferentially satisfy each element of a claim). Should evidence 
produced during the course of discovery indicate that the horizontal conspiracy and the vertical clearance agreements in 
question were linked, plaintiffs may be able to pursue this theory later in the proceedings. "
743,," By contrast, plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled the elements of ""circuit dealing,"" which courts have held unlawful. HN18[
] 
Circuit deals are agreements whereby exhibitors use their monopoly power (or near monopoly power) in one or more areas to 
negotiate blanket exclusive agreements with distributors covering all of their theaters, including areas where they may have 
competition. See United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 107-09, 92 L. Ed. 1236, 68 S. Ct. 941 (1948), rev'd on other grounds, 
Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 771-72, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984); Beech 
Cinema, Inc. v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., 622 F.2d 1106, 1110 (2d Cir. 1980). Plaintiffs raise the allegation of circuit 
dealing for the first time in their opposition papers, having nowhere alleged in the complaint that defendants negotiated contracts 
with distributors at a circuit-wide level. (See P. Opp. Br. 16-17.) The complaint not only fails to allege facts sufficient to support 
the allegation of circuit dealing, it also fails to assert even the components of such a theory. It therefore fails to meet the 
requirement HN19[
] under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 that plaintiff's claim include ""[a] statement of a claim for relief that gives notice to the opposing party."" Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 198 (2d Cir. 2001). Plaintiffs may not amend their complaint through 
their opposition brief. Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 1998); Mathias v. Daily News, L.P., 152 F. Supp. 
2d 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). Absent the filing of an amended complaint that properly pleads the components of circuit dealing, 
the Court will not consider this allegation."
743,10," Defendants further assert that plaintiffs' allegations of higher box office and concession prices and reduced discounts are 
""overly conclusory [and] devoid even of alleged facts."" (Dist. Br. 17). However, HN20[
] at the pleading stage, ""a short, plain 
statement of a claim for relief that gives notice to the opposing party is all that is necessary in antitrust cases, as in other cases 
under the Federal Rules."" Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d at 198. Here, plaintiffs have ""identified the co-conspirators and 
described the nature and effect of the alleged conspiracy,"" which is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. Alco Standard 
Corp. v. Schmid Bros., 647 F. Supp. 4, 6 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). To require more would be to hold plaintiffs to a higher pleading 
standard than is required under the Federal Rules and to thwart congressional intent in providing a private remedy for antitrust 
violations. See Nagler, 248 F.2d at 322-23. The Court also rejects defendants' argument that plaintiffs lack standing to assert price-increases as a resulting harm to the 
market because plaintiffs themselves benefit from the price increases. (Exhib. Br. 8 n.2). It would be nonsensical for the law to 
insist that plaintiffs allege harm to the entire market and then refuse them standing to bring such allegations."
743,11," Defendants' argument that overall box-office revenue, the number of screens and the number of movies shown in the Lower 
Manhattan Zone have increased since Regal's entry into the market is as irrelevant as it is self-evident. There is no dispute that 
when Regal entered the market, the number of screens increased and overall box-office revenue climbed in the relevant market. 
It is not Regal's entry into the market, however, that is the subject of antitrust challenge. Rather, plaintiffs make the simple ""but- "
744,," for"" argument that both their own revenues and consumer choice in TCFs would be higher, and box-office prices lower, if not for 
the illegal agreements between exhibitors and distributors and the conspiracy between Onex and Oaktree. (P. Opp. Br. 21 n.7.) "
745,12," HN23[
] Under this framework, a plaintiff must first produce evidence that defendants' actions have had substantial adverse 
effects on competition; the burden then shifts to the defendant, who must provide a procompetitive justification for their actions; if 
defendant does so, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff ""to prove either that the challenged restraint is not reasonably 
necessary to achieve the defendants' procompetitive justifications, or that those objectives may be achieved in a manner less 
restrictive of free competition."" Visa, 344 F.3d at 238; see also Clorox Co. v. Sterling Winthrop, Inc., 117 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 
1997) (same). "
746,13," Defendants also assert that plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under section 1 because they have failed to allege that 
Oaktree or Kaplan and Karsh are ""able to control Regal's decisions."" (Oaktree Repl. Mem. 8-9.) This argument is frivolous. It is 
difficult to comprehend why defendants would make lengthy arguments refuting the existence of their control over Regal's 
decision making if plaintiffs had failed to allege such control. Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged actual control through their 
assertions that Oaktree owns 17% of the voting power in Regal and has a seat on its board, and that Kaplan and Karsh are able 
to ""coordinate"" the activities of Regal and Loews. (See Compl. PP 6, 15, 75, 78.) "
747,14," Again, although the question inBrager was whether a parent and a subsidiary were liable for conspiring in violation of Sherman 
Act section 1, its reasoning holds equally true for the purposes of section 2. Whether an entity is considered a competitor should 
not vary depending upon the section of antitrust law at issue. "
748,15," The cases defendants cite for the proposition that a non-competitor may not be held liable under section 2 can be 
distinguished on grounds that defendants in those cases neither coordinated nor derived benefit from the alleged monopoly, and 
thus could not be viewed as competitors in the relevant market. See Discon, 93 F.3d at 1062; Spanish Broad. Sys. v. Clear 
Channel Communications, Inc., 242 F. Supp. 2d 1350, 1363 (S.D. Fla. 2003); Berlyn v. Gazette Newspapers, Inc., 157 F. Supp. 
2d 609, 620 (D. Md. 2001). In any event, none of these cases is binding on this Court."
748,16," HN31[
] In order to state a claim under section 8, a plaintiff must also demonstrate that the corporations in question are actual ""competitors"" within the meaning of the antitrust laws, and that each of the corporations meets a certain threshold for 
competitive sales, capital, surplus, and undivided profits. 15 U.S.C. § 19(a)(1). It is undisputed that Regal and Loews are 
competitors in the market, and that each is subject to section 8 under the statutory financial requirements. The sole issue in 
dispute with respect to plaintiffs' section 8 claims is whether Oaktree can be held liable by virtue of the fact that it has officers 
who serve on the boards of both Loews and Regal. "
749,17," Indeed, the parties refer to the Delaware code, which provides that ""the board of directors of a corporation shall consist of 1 or 
more members, each of whom shall be a natural person."" Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, § 141(b). Both Regal and Loews are Delaware 
corporations. The parties do not refer to any state that permits a corporation to act as a director of another corporation. It should 
be noted, however, that there is no conceptual reason why a state that so chose could not allow a corporation to sit as a director 
of another. Of course, the corporation would have to exercise its responsibilities through an individual agent, and the prohibition 
of section 8 would prevent a corporation in such a hypothetical jurisdiction from being a director of two competing corporations. "
751,18," Defendants also point to subsequent legislative history, and primarily to two committee reports issued in 1965 and 1990, to 
demonstrate that later Congresses viewed section 8 as applying only to direct interlocks. See Staff of the House Antitrust 
Subcommittee, 89th Cong., Staff Report to the Antitrust Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary (Comm. Print 1965) 
(section 8 ""does not apply where a director of one corporation is a major officer or employee of the other company. Indirect 
interlocks, similarly, are not covered, notwithstanding the fact that such relationships may dilute competition as much as the 
direct interlock that is prohibited""); Interlocking Directorate Act of 1990, Report of the Committee on the Judiciary, H.R. Rep. No. 
101-483 at 4 n.8 (2d Sess. 1990) (""Section 8 only regulates direct interlocks.""). Further sections of the record highlighted by 
defendants fall into two categories: either casual mentions by Congressmembers of the term ""individual"" when considering 
amendments to the antitrust laws, or reports given to Congress by third-parties or agencies as to the status of the law. See, e.g., 
136 Cong. Rec. 10,425 (1990) (remarks of Rep. Feighan); Federal Trade Commission, Report of the Federal Trade Commission 
on Interlocking Directorates, H.R. Doc. No. 81-652 at (2d Sess. 1950) (""[Section 8] is applicable only to direct interlocks among 
competitors …. The law does not encompass indirect interlocks, whatever may be their character and significance.""); The 
Interlocking Directorate Act of 1986: Hearing on s.2163 Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 99th Cong., 13-23 (1986) 
(Statement of D. Ginsburg, Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Div.). In considering this evidence in the aggregate, the Court heeds the Supreme Court's caution that HN34[
] ""the views of a 
subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one."" Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. "
752,," GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 117, 64 L. Ed. 2d 766, 100 S. Ct. 2051 (1980). As a result, ""subsequent legislative history will 
rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its 
enactment."" Id. at 118 n.13. The views of congressional committees or individual members of subsequent Congresses, let alone 
of subcommittee staff members or of testifying agencies, cannot be taken as indicating the intentions of the enacting Congress 
fifty or seventy-five years earlier. Still less can such views trump the clear import of the statutory language itself."
752,19," This interpretation is also consistent with the position advanced for over thirty years by both the the Federal Trade 
Commission (""FTC"") and the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, the two agencies charged with interpreting and enforcing 
the statute. (United States Br. Amicus Curiae 9-10); see also United States v. Cleveland Trust, 392 F. Supp. 699 (prosecution by 
government under section 8 based on deputization theory); United States v. Int'l Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 
1994-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) P 70,813, 1994 WL 728884 (D.D.C. June 14, 1994) (consent decree applying section 8 to prohibit 
separate agents of a union from sitting simultaneously on the boards of competing airlines); SCM Corp., 565 F.2d at 811 
(adopting FTC's interpretation of statute as applying to corporations as well as individuals); U.S. Dept. of Justice, Antitrust 
Division, Business Review Letter to UAW, Trade Reg. Rep. (CCH) P 50,425 (advising that ""the government has previously taken 
the position that a corporation sat on the boards of competing corporations through representatives""). There is no need to decide 
how much, if any, deference is due to the Government's views. At a minimum, they offer persuasive support for the proposition 
independently adopted here. In addition, the leading academic treatise on antitrust law adopts the same view, noting that ""where [company] C has a director 
on the boards of [competitors] A and B, serious anticompetitive consequences could arise if C has an interest in limiting A-B 
competition."" 5 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 334 (2d ed. 2003). The authors proceed to note that 
""there seems little reason to preclude [section] 8 from embracing the Cleveland Trust fact situation, which involved directors who 
were important bank officers subject to the control and direction of their employer."" Id. at 335. "
753,20," Plaintiffs argue that because violations of Section 8 are considered per se illegal, they need not allege injury in order to seek 
injunctive relief, although they would need to do so In order to seek damages. (P. Opp. Br. 67 (citing Jicarilla Apache Tribe v. 
Supron Energy Corp., 728 F.2d 1555, 1572 (10th Cir. 1984) (Seymore, J., concurring in part); Protectoseal Co. v. Barancik, 484 
F.2d 585, 589 (7th Cir. 1973).) However, the Court need not reach this issue, as plaintiffs have adequately alleged antitrust 
injury resulting from the interlock."
753,21," Alternatively, defendants argue that should plaintiffs' federal claims be dismissed, their state claims must similarly be 
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. However, because plaintiffs' claims under the Sherman Act §§ 1and 2 and the Clayton Act § 8 
survive, ancillary jurisdiction is present over all related state claims. "
754,22," The Donnelly Act was modeled on the Sherman Act, not the Clayton Act, and the Court is unaware of any case that has 
specifically held that such Donnelly Act claims are to be interpreted in light of section 7 of the Clayton Act. However, given that 
claims for relief have been sustained based on Clayton Act-type violations, there is no reason to depart from the general 
mandate to interpret the New York statute in light of equivalent federal antitrust precedent. See X.L.O. Concrete Corp. v. 
Rivergate Corp., 83 N.Y. 2d 513, 518, 634 N.E.2d 158, 611 N.Y.S.2d 786 (1994); Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 997 F. Supp. at

754,24," Plaintiffs have also failed to demonstrate that defendants have ""received a benefit of money or property belonging to the 
plaintiff."" Granite Partners, L.P. v. Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., 17 F. Supp. 2d 275, 313 (S.D.N.Y. 1998). Plaintiff had no entitlement

Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim that defendants have ""received profits to which they were not entitled … [a] large portion of "

conspiracy); Harrison v. Paramount Pictures, 115 F. Supp. 312, 317 (E.D. Pa. 1953) (landlord's lowered rental income resulting

778,12," Hanford sought to preclude Norbrook from introducing evidence that its trade secret was the ""trial and error"" process that Dr. 
Quinn engaged in while at Norbrook. Hanford, however, was on notice of the ""trial and error"" component of Norbrook's theory. In 
its complaint, Norbrook indicates that it invested ""approximately [four] years and considerable expense"" to develop its in situ 
method. Dkt. No. 1, Compl. at P 17. In addition, the William Toner's declaration submitted in support of Norbrook's motion for a 
preliminary injection and expedited discovery affirmed that the Norbrook Process required years of experience in combining the primary ingredients … under controlled conditions … 
Norbrook became aware of the critical specifics (e.g., temperatures, type of mixing, length and rate of mixing, etc.) only 
after considerable research and development. The Norbrook Process is not simply the result of chemical and mathematical 
calculations, but exhaustive trial and error and examination of trial data that allowed Norbrook to become skilled in the art of 
such a process. Dkt. No. 4, Toner Decl. at PP 16 and 18. Furthermore, in its letter to the court dated April 10, 2003, written in response to Hanford's motion to compel Norbrook to identify 
its trade secret with greater specificity, Norbrook stated that its ""process was developed, refined and put into production by [Dr. 
Quinn] through years of work and literally hundreds of trial batches of product. Norbrook has produced … laboratory records 
from 1985 to 1992-a six-year period, which recounts the painstaking trial and error work that went into the Norbrook process."""
778,13," Rule 26(e)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that HN7[
] ""a party is under a duty seasonably to amend a

782,15," ""Know-How"" was a book that plaintiff licensed that included an extensive compilation of plaintiff's collected knowledge in the

782,16," The trial court had denied plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction because of agreements made between the parties. 
""'Were this an ordinary trade secrets case … injunction would issue … This, however, is not such a case because the rights and 
obligations of the parties which might otherwise obtain have been altered and defined by the agreements which they made.""' 
Imperial Chem. Indus. Ltd. v. Nat'l Distillers and Chem. Corp., 342 F.2d at 740 (quoting the trial court's conclusions of law). "
784,17," Conversely, the fact that Norbrook conducted a considerable amount of lab scale and development work demonstrates that its 
in situ method is a trade secret within the meaning of New York law. Dkt. No. 69, Trial Tr. at 510."
784,18," The court does not mean to imply that Hanford's achievement of an in situ method of manufacture for PGP injections would 
have been a foregone conclusion, albeit one requiring a greater investment of time and money, ad Hanford not consulted with 
Dr. Quinn. Nor can the court conclude that Hanford would never have developed the in situ method had it not consulted with Dr. 
Quinn. Therein lies the problem: because Hanford consulted with Dr. Quinn to the extent that it did, it is all but impossible to 
determine what Hanford might have accomplished on its own. The record, however, demonstrates that Dr. Quinn's consultancy 
with Hanford allowed it to develop the in situ method."
784,19," Although not specified as a factor by the Restatement, the extent to which Norbrook's in situ method was known by others in 
the veterinary pharmaceutical industry was limited to general theories as opposed to the application, confirmation or refinement 
of those theories to a practicable and detailed method of manufacture."
784,20," Although neither party raised the issue, Norbrook's claim against Hanford for misappropriation of its trade secret is timely. 
HN23[
] New York trade secret misappropriation claims are governed by a three-year statute of limitations for suits based on 
injury to property. N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214(4) (McKinney 2003). HN24[
] ""Accrual of a claim for trade secret misappropriation 
occurs as follows: If a defendant misappropriates and discloses a trade secret, he becomes liable to plaintiff upon disclosure. On 
the other hand, if the defendant [misappropriates and] keeps the secret confidential yet makes use of it to his own commercial "
785,," advantage, each successive use constitutes a new actionable tort for purposes of the Statute of Limitations."" Architectronics, 
Inc. v. Control Systems, Inc., 935 F. Supp. 425, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (citing Lemelson v. Carolina Enterprises, Inc., 541 F. 
Supp. 645, 659 (S.D.N.Y. 982)). Here, Hanford continued to use Norbrook's trade secrets until the court's previous order 
granting Norbrook's motion for a preliminary injunction, having applied to the FDA to amend its commercial manufacturing 
process for PGP injections on January 24, 2002."
785,21," Bearing this in mind, some of Hanford's employees testified that they were not comfortable with Dr. Quinn's involvement on 
the project. Dkt. No. 71, Trial Tr. at 680-81; Cross Dep. at 67, 82-82, and 129. Similarly, the court finds it somewhat curious that 
Mr. Ward inquired no further after Dr. Quinn revealed that he had been involved in prior litigation with Norbrook. Dkt. No. 67, 
Trial Tr. at 244. "
786,22," Contrary to Hanford's assertion, the court is not necessarily compelled to consider Norbrook's trade secret misappropriation 
claim and unfair competition claim as a single cause of action. See Continental Dynamics Corp. v. Kanter, 64 A.D.2d 975, 408 
N.Y.S.2d 801, 802 (2d Dep't 1978) (finding that while no trade secret existed in customer lists, ""an employee's physical taking or 
studied copying of such lists may, nevertheless, form the basis for a cause of action for unfair competition"") (internal quotation 
marks omitted). In any event, because the court found that Norbrook possessed a trade secret and that Hanford misappropriated 
it, no further discussion of this matter is required. "
796,1," No member of the panel nor judge in regular active service of the Court having requested that the Court be polled on 
Rehearing En Banc (FED. R. APP. P. and 5th CIR. R. 35), the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied. "
797,2," Witness Peter Yueh provided evidence of a smaller regional competitor joining the conspiracy. Yueh was a former vice 
president of a company that sold laminated fiberglass primarily in Texas; he testified that his former company became part of the 
conspiracy in January 1994. "
798,3," For this same reason, we also reject Supreme's brief argument that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. "
800,4," Notably, the Court did not rely on the fact that the conspirators had failed to show abandonment or success in concluding that 
the conspiracy continued to exist."
800,5," A leading antitrust treatise supports this understanding of the statute of limitations as it relates to an antitrust conspiracy. 2 
HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION 208 
(2d ed. 2000). In explaining continuing antitrust conspiracies, the treatise states that ""the idea of the continuing conspiracy or 
violation is that the defendant continues to commit acts in furtherance of the violation and each of these additional acts causes 
additional injury. The statute is said to be tolled as long as such qualifying acts continue to be committed."" Id."
800,6," Although Zenith was a civil suit, the stated principle should also be true in the criminal context because criminal proceedings 
require a higher burden of proof than civil proceedings. "
801,7," The Government argues that the rationale of a recent Second Circuit opinion, United States v. Spero, 331 F.3d 57 (2d Cir. 
2003), should control here. We disagree. In Spero, the Second Circuit held that a RICO conspiracy would continue, even into the 
limitations period, until the defendants made an affirmative showing that they had withdrawn. United States v. Spero, 331 F.3d at 
60-61. As a preliminary matter, this case is two steps removed from the instant case. First, this case occurs in the Second 
Circuit--not the Fifth. Second, this case arises in the RICO context--not antitrust. The Second Circuit has not actually applied the 
cited rationale in the context of a price-fixing agreement. For these two reasons, alone, Spero is not persuasive. More 
importantly, the rationale of Spero appears to conflict with Kissel, and expressly conflicts with Al George, Poster Exchange, 
Brown, and Inryco. Even if precedent did not speak to this issue, Spero is not persuasive. ""Limitations serve the same functions in anti-trust as 
elsewhere in the law: to put old liabilities to rest, to relieve courts and parties from 'stale' claims where the best evidence may no 
longer be available, and to create incentives for those who believe themselves wronged to investigate and bring their claims 
promptly . . . ."" 2 HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR 
APPLICATION 205 (2d ed. 2000). Adopting the Second Circuit's rule would circumvent the policy underlying the law of 
limitations. The rule of Spero allows the government to bring claims well after any evidence is found to substantiate the original 
act of conspiracy. It nullifies much of the incentive to bring a claim after the last alleged injurious act because the statute of 
limitations would only begin running from the time that the defendant made a showing of abandonment. We therefore decline to 
adopt the Second Circuit's rationale in the context of a price-fixing conspiracy. "

841,11," When confronted with the precise issue, the Supreme Court has declined to resolve whether a § 1962(d) RICO conspiracy 
claim must be predicated on an actionable violation of §§ 1962(a)-(c). Beck, 529 U.S. at 506 n.10."
841,12," Defendants' reliance on McCowan v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 908 F.2d 1099 (2d Cir. 1990) in support of their proposition that 9 
U.S.C. § 3 requires a mandatory stay is similarly misplaced as it is factually distinguishable. In McCowan, the plaintiffs sued 
Sears, with whom they had no arbitration agreement, based upon ""controlling person"" liability under the Virginia Securities Act 
for the acts of Dean Witter, with whom the plaintiffs did possess an arbitration agreement. 908 F.2d at 1106. While the Second 
Circuit reversed the trial court's denial of a mandatory stay under § 3 to Dean Witter, it did not reverse the denial of the stay 
against the other defendant Sears. McCowan, 908 F.2d at 1107. In fact, the Court declined to pass judgment on the viability or 
abitrability of Sears' claims. Id. The continuing value of McCowan is also in doubt as it has been implicitly repudiated by later 
precedent. See Citrus MArketing Board of Israel and Agrexco v. J. Lauritzen A/S, 943 F.2d 220, 224-25 (2d Cir. 1991). 
Moreover, this argument invites the Court to disturb previous rulings. "
842,13," Courts have stressed the opposite logic - i.e., requiring Plaintiffs to prove injury from a racketeering act first prevents them 
from simply alleging a RICO conspiracy and therefore evading the other elements of a RICO action. Sec Beck v. Prupis, 162 
F.3d 1090 (11th Cir. 1998)."
842,14," Other courts have also followed this line of analysis. See, e.g. Blue Cross of California v. Anesthesia Care Associates Medical 
Group. Inc., 187 F.3d 1045 (9th Cir. 1999) (holding that ""Providers' claims, which arise from the terms of their provider 
agreements and could not be asserted by their patient-assignors, are not claims for benefits under the terms of ERISA plans 
…""); Lakeland Anesthesia, Inc. v. Louisiana Health Serv. & Indemnity Co., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18626, 2000 WL 1801834

843,15," HN32[
] In order for state law claims to be subject to ERISA complete preemption, four elements must be present: (1) a 
relevant ERISA ""plan""; (2) the plaintiff must have standing to sue; (3) the defendant must be an ERISA entity; and (4) the 
complaint must seek relief akin to what is available under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a). Butero v. Royal Maccabees Life Ins. Co., 174 
F.3d 1207, 1212 (11th Cir. 1999). "

] A civil action may be brought - (1) by a participant or beneficiary Afor the relief provided for in subsection (c) of this section, or (B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to 
clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan; (2) by the Secretary, or by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 1109 of this title; (3) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter 
or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any 
provisions of this subchapter or the terms of this plan."

859,25," In finding that the Plaintiffs have successfully alleged direct liability, the Court does not reach the two other bases of parent-
subsidiary liability: (a) the agency theory where the parent corporation uses a subsidiary to do its bidding; and (b) the 
instrumentality theory, under which the plaintiff must establish that the parent exercised a significant degree of control over the 
subsidiary's decision-making See, e.g., Frank v. U.S. West, Inc., 3 F.3d 1357, 1362 n.2 (10th Cir. 1993) (veil will be pierced

870,2," The first and second amended complaint make consistent allegations regarding the antitrust injury suffered. The district court 
viewed Digital Images' allegations more favorably in its decision dismissing the first amended complaint. "
871,3," The district court believed also that Digital Images' injury was ""exacerbated by the very thing the antitrust laws are designed to 
promote"" because its ""current inventory of editing products is harmed the more innovative and productive the joint-venture 
between Avid and Tektronix."" The district court went on to conclude that ""granting relief to [Digital Images] for a reduction in the 
value of its inventory as a result of a merger would . . . have the perverse effect of punishing mergers that lead to the production 
of better products in proportion to the superiority of the merged entity's products."" [ER 287.] This analysis is sheer speculation. "
872,," Nothing in the record supports the proposition that the joint venture produced better products, innovation, or productivity. In fact, 
the complaint alleges that the effect of the agreement was to diminish innovation and quality of the product. "
874,4," Nor is it (1) Hairston v. Pacific 10 Conference, 101 F.3d 1315 (9th Cir. 1996) (where antitrust standing was questionable and

""procompetitive objectives could be achieved in a substantially less restrictive manner""); (2) R.C. Dick Geothermal Corp. v. 
Thermogenics, Inc., 890 F.2d 139 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc) where there was no agreement to restrict the output of the product 
""in the market"" and no anticompetitive effect demonstrated with respect to the alleged restraint; or (3) ARCO v. U.S.A. 
Petroleum, 495 U.S. 328 (1990) (one competitor held not to have demonstrated antitrust injury from rival's vertical, maximum 
price fixing agreement)."
874,5," Defendants argue that ""by 1998 the demand for Lightworks' products had declined drastically."" This decline in demand may 
make it more difficult for Digital Images to prove damages in a certain amount or to demonstrate the ""direct"" or causation 
element for antitrust standing, but it does not impact our finding of antitrust injury. Moreover, the defendants muddy the Rule 
12(b)(6) waters by injecting assertions of factual disputes into their argument, such as (1) Lightworks was not discontinued but 
""sold to a third party and is in business,"" and that Digital Images knew it, and (2) ""Ms. Shott [the owner of Digital Images], 
shutdown her own company and went off to write a novel."" Whether this is true or not, and whether it is relevant is to be decided 
at a stage later through a motion to dismiss for lack of standing pursuant to Rule (12)(b)(6). It is true of course, that an antitrust 
cause of action is susceptible of dismissal at any stage once it does appear factually that the injury complained of was not 
antitrust in nature. As illustrated in Brunswick, ""judgment must be given to the defendant whenever it appears that any essential 
element of the plaintiff's claim is missing . . . ."" Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 335e2. (2d ed. 2000);

Appendix C § 5. "
876,6," The district court identified the fifth statement (Tektronix's representation that it had ""people actively developing a real-time 
effects system, and will unveil it next year [1997]""), as actionable and not subject to dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), but 
did not address the statement during subsequent summary judgment proceedings. It should do so on remand. "

894,3," No issue is raised with respect to the court's ruling on the portion of Red and White's sixth cause of action alleging false 
advertising in violation of section 17500. Therefore, we omit any further discussion of this cause of action from this opinion. "
897,4," Not directly relevant here, section 17050 describes five specific situations in which a seller's below-cost selling will not violate 
section 17043, including when a seller is selling goods in connection with discontinuing its business, selling seasonal or 
perishable goods after the optimal time for their sale, selling damaged goods, selling goods pursuant to a court order, and selling 
goods at a low price in a good faith effort to meet a competitor's legal price. "
901,5," While the decisions in  People v. Black's Food Store, Garner v. Journeyman Barbers' etc. Union, and  Ellis v. Dallas, among 
others, are cited in the Western Union opinion to support the court's cost analysis, what is apparently overlooked is that liability 
in each case was premised on anticompetitive conduct involving below-cost pricing of only some of the defendants' products."
901,6," The hyperbole arises not from the characterization of these promotional activities as below-cost sales—for clearly they are—
but from the supposition that they evince predatory intent and are actionable. Section 17044 prohibits the use of “loss leaders” to 
injure competitors. A “loss leader” is defined as any article or product sold “[w]here the effect is to divert trade from or otherwise 
injure competitors.” (§ 17030, subd. (c).) Despite the broad definition of “loss leaders,” commercial users of this marketing tool 
face potential liability only if its use is undertaken with an intent to injure competitors or to destroy competition, and not simply to 
increase sales. ( Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., supra, 20 Cal.4th at pp. 175–179.) "
903,7," When his deposition was taken, Blue & Gold's president, Ron Duckhorn, explained that it refused to sell Alcatraz tickets to Red 
and White to avoid “[c]onfusing the public.” "
906,8," Another court has noted that relevant factors to this analysis may also include “the relative strength of the parties[,] the 
proportionate volume of commerce involved in relation to the total volume of commerce in the relevant market area[,] and … the 
probable immediate and future effects which preemption of that share of the market might have on effective competition therein.” 
( Curly's Dairy, Inc. v. Dairy Cooperative Association (D. Or. 1962) 202 F. Supp. 481, 485, italics omitted.) "
907,9," A tying arrangement may be condemned also under section 16720, as an unreasonable restraint of trade. However, a 
plaintiff's proof is more exacting to establish a violation under section 16720. ( Suburban Mobile Homes, supra, 101 Cal. App. 3d 
at p. 549.) The distinction between the proof required under the two sections is that under “section 16727 the plaintiff must 
establish … either the seller enjoys sufficient economic power in the tying product to appreciably restrain competition in the tied 
product or if a not insubstantial volume of commerce in the tied product is restrained. Under [the]  section 16720 standard, both 
conditions must be met. [Citation.]” (Ibid.) This alleged tying is also the basis for part of Red and White's section 16720 claim in 
its third cause of action. The court denied Blue & Gold summary adjudication as to Red and White's tying claim based on section 
16720, a ruling that is not at issue here. "
909,10," In view of this conclusion, we need not address Red and White's claims alleging numerous irregularities in the procedure 
used by the trial court in making its final ruling on summary adjudication. We do not anticipate that these issues will reoccur upon 
remand. "
919,1," Mesa witnesses testified at the preliminary injunction hearing that United would have no concerns about low-fare competition 
from Independence Air because United faces competition everywhere. United's internal documentation and the testimony 
concerning the United/ACA negotiations are to the contrary, as is common sense concerning a competitive threat estimated at 
one-half billion dollars. "
920,2," This lawsuit began when Atlantic Coast submitted its initial Motion for a Preliminary Injunction based on the first preliminary 
consent statement. Since then, Mesa has filed two revised preliminary consent statements with the SEC that reflect changes 
addressing specifically Atlantic Coast's concerns. The ACA Reply is the first substantive briefing on the disclosure issues since 
the filing of the Consent Statement in December 2003. Atlantic Coast's Memorandum in Support of Its Amended Motion for a 
Preliminary Injunction analyzes only the antitrust claims. This decision will address the securities claims identified in the ACA 
Reply, supplemented by the oral argument on December 10, 2003, as they provide the best indication of Atlantic Coast's current 
legal position. "
922,3, Lipton Decl. Exh. 4.

reasons for refusing to recognize target standing. HN17[
] Courts have regarded any alleged injury suffered by a target in a 
merger as being inherent to the merger process rather than flowing from any anticompetitive effect of the merger.""Id. (citing 
Burnup & Sims, Inc. v. Posner, 688 F. Supp. 1532 (S.D. Fla. 1988)). ""Rather than suffering injury, the target and its shareholders 
ultimately benefit from any increased prices or decreased competition stemming from the merger."" Id. (citing Anago, 976 F.2d at 
251). ""Finally, courts have even found that disingenuous antitrust suits may be brought by targets to thwart the loss of control to 
be suffered by management, as opposed to any motives relating to antitrust."" Id."
925,7," Whenever the Court refers to§ 1 of the Sherman Act in its Analysis, it also refers to the claims brought under the parallel 
provision of the D.C. Doce, § 28-4502."
925,8," The Court's ruling that Atlantic Coast does not have standing to bring its Clayton Act claim has little practical impact on this suit 
since the parties have concentrated their attentions and arguments on the Sherman Act claim. "
926,9," Mesa had no answer to the Court's question as to why Atlantic Coast did not have standing as a potential competitor, even if 
not as a target, and the Court deems the issue almost conceded. "
927,10," See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588 HN21[
] (""To survive a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict, a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of § 1 must present evidence 'that tends to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators 
acted independently. [A plaintiff], in other words, must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the 
competing inferences of independent action …."")(internal citations omitted). "
929,11," There are many instances in the transcript of the injunction hearing of testimony by Mesa's witnesses that was internally 
inconsistent and not entirely forthcoming, and, therefore, it is not fully credited. For example, Mesa testified that there might not 
be any records of the discussions between United and Mesa over a two-week period, which the Court concludes is an unlikely 
state of affairs for critical negotiations with a major carrier that is in the midst of a bankruptcy reorganization. "
930,12," Atlantic Coast does not argue that the alleged conspiracy between Mesa and United is per se unlawful. See generally United 
States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972). "
931,13," Mesa testified that the consent solicitation and change to the ACA Board were more attractive than Mesa's original stock 
exchange offer because a change in the board, unlike an acquisition, would not allow Delta Air Lines to cancel certain contracts 
with Atlantic Coast on which older aircraft are in use. Inasmuch as Mesa did no due diligence before making its exchange offer, 
and admittedly made the proposal because Mesa feared that United would contract with new UAX partners for Dulles traffic 
without including Mesa, the possibility of a stock exchange offer between Mesa and Atlantic Coast remains very uncertain and is 
not considered in balancing the harms. "

Quinn engaged in while at Norbrook. Hanford, however, was on notice of the ""trial and error"" component of Norbrook's theory. In 
its complaint, Nobrook indicates that it invested ""approximately [four] years and considerable expense"" to develop its in situ 
method. Dkt. No. 1, Compl. at P 17. In addition, the William Toner's declaration submitted in support of Norbrook's motion for a 
preliminary injection and expedited discovery affirmed that the Norbrook Process required years of experience in combining the primary ingredients … under controlled conditions … 
Norbrook became aware of the critical specifics (e.g., temperatures, type of mixing, length and rate of mixing, etc.) only 
after considerable research and development. The Norbrook Process is not simply the result of chemical and mathematical "
952,," calculations, but exhaustive trial and error and examination of trial data that allowed Norbrook to become skilled in the art of 
such a process. Dkt. No. 4, Toner Decl. at PP 16 and 18. Furthermore, in its letter to the court dated April 10, 2003, written in response to Hanford's motion to compel Norbrook to identify 
its trade secret with greater specificity, Norbrook stated that its ""process was developed, refined and put into production by [Dr. 
Quinn] through years of work and literally hundreds of trial batches of product. Norbrook has produced … laboratory records 
from 1985 to 1992-a six-year period, which recounts the painstaking trial and error work that went into the Norbrook process."""

957,17," Conversely, the fact that Norbrook conducted a considerable amount of lab scale and development work demonstrates that its 
in situ method is a trade secret within the meaning of New York law. Dkt. No. 69, Trial Tr. at 510."
957,18," The court does not mean to imply that Hanford's achievement of an in situ method of manufacture for PGP injections would 
have been a foregone conclusion, albeit one requiring a greater investment of time and money, had Hanford not consulted with 
Dr. Quinn. Nor can the court conclude that Hanford would never have developed the in situ method had it not consulted with Dr. 
Quinn. Therein lies the problem: because Hanford consulted with Dr. Quinn to the extent that it did, it is all but impossible to 
determine what Hanford might have accomplished on its own. The record, however, demonstrates that Dr. Quinn's consultancy 
with Hanford allowed it to develop the in situ method. "
958,19," Although not specified as a factor by the Restatement, the extent to which Norbrook's in situ method was known by others in 
the veterinary pharmaceutical industry was limited to general theories as opposed to the application, confirmation or refinement

974,7," Jury Instruction No. 59 provided: Plaintiffs' fourth theory of recovery is intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. In order to recover on this 
claim, plaintiffs [Dr. Chandler] and Dr. Borrello must prove the following five things by a prepon derance of the evidence:"
974,1, . a prospective business relationship existed between plaintiffs and patients;
974,2, . defendants had knowledge of the prospective relationship and intended to prevent its fruition;
974,3, . the prospective business relationship did not culminate in pecuniary benefit to plaintiffs;
974,4," . defendants' conduct interfered with the pro spective relationship; and 5. the interference caused the plaintiffs' damages. If you find that plaintiffs have proven each of the above five things by a preponderance of the evidence, you have determined 
that defendants intentionally interfered with plaintiffs' prospective business relationship with patients. If you do not find that 
plaintiffs have proven each of the above five things by a preponderance of the evidence, you must return a verdict for the 
defendants on this claim. If you decide it is more likely true than not true that all these things happened with respect to one or more of the defendants and 
one or more of the plaintiffs, then you must decide if the defendants' conduct was legally justified or privileged. I previously told 
you how to determine whether the defendants' conduct is legally justified or privileged . . . . [deleted orally]. If you decide that [it 
is] more likely true than not true as to all of these elements and you decide that the defendants' conduct was not legally justified 
or privileged, then you must return a verdict in favor of that plaintiff or plaintiffs and against that defendant or those defendants 
on this claim. Otherwise, you must return a verdict for the defendants on this claim. I have already defined ""intent"" and ""legal cause"" for you. I have also instructed you on how to determine whether a defendant's 
conduct was legally privileged or justified. The court instructed on how to determine whether a defendant's conduct was justified or privileged as follows. Jury Instruction 
No. 57 provided: "
975,," I will now instruct you on how to determine whether a defendant's conduct was justified or privileged. The law recognizes that 
certain kinds of conduct under certain circumstances are not improper, or in legal terms, are justified or privileged. A defendant's 
interference with a contract is justified or privileged when he has a direct financial interest related to the contract, and his 
conduct is predominately motivated by a desire to protect his economic interest. A defendant's conduct is not justified or 
privileged when it is motivated by spite, malice, or some other improper objective."

jury were to fail to find that the conduct was not legally justified it could not find in favor of the plaintiffs."

that physicians, not hospitals, make referrals, (2) that Chandler and Borrello had no legal right to referrals, and (3) that 
Chandler's business was in fact growing from 1995 to 1998 but made less money after the exclusive was lifted. As to the first, 
although the Group's argument may be true, it does not necessarily eliminate Providence from liability if, as evidence 
demonstrated here, Providence allowed the Group to impose itself as a clearinghouse for referrals by hospital employees. As to 
the second, though the doctors had no right to referrals, some Providence employees testified that they would have referred 
patients to Borrello and Chandler but for the exclusive, and that it would have been beneficial if more patients were referred to 
outside doctors. As to the third, the issue is not whether Chandler's business was growing, but rather whether Chandler 
demonstrated injury by producing evidence that he would have earned more money but for the exclusive. See, e.g., PHILLIP E.

most prolific and respected scholar on proximate cause is cited as having written in his Rationale of Proximate Cause, 135-36 
(1927) as follows: 'Cause,' although irreducible in its concept, could not escape the ruffles and decorations so generously bestowed: remote, 
proximate, direct, immediate, adequate, efficient, operative, inducing, moving, active, real, effective, decisive, supervening, 
primary, original, contributory, ultimate, concurrent, causa causans, legal, responsible, dominating, natural, probable, and 
others. The difficulty now is in getting any one to believe that so simple a creature could have been so extravagantly 
garbed. See also the extensive quote from Leon Green, Judge and Jury (1930) in Hentschel v. Baby Bathinette Corp., 215 F.2d 102, 109 
n. 9 (2d Cir. 1954) and Judge Andrews' dissent in the celebrated Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N.Y. 339, 351-52, 248 N.Y. 
(N.Y.S.) 339, 162 N.E. 99 (1938): What is a cause in a legal sense, still more what is a proximate case, depend in each case upon many considerations …. 
What we do mean by the word 'proximate' is, that because of convenience, of public policy, of a rough sense of justice, the 
law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point. "

found that ""the right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition"" and thus that ""it would be destructive 
of rights of association and of petition to hold that groups with common interests may not, without violating the antitrust laws, use 
the channels and procedures of state and federal agencies and courts to advocate their causes and points of view respecting 
resolution of their business and economic interests vis-a-vis their competitors."" Id. at 510-11."
1005,3," In Pennington, the Court considered the legality of a joint effort by a coal workers union and large companies in the industry to 
obtain establishment from the Secretary of Labor of a minimum wage that would drive smaller companies out of the industry. 
United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington et al., 381 U.S. 657, 660, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 S. Ct. 1585 (1965). The Court 
found that Noerr made it clear that the union and large companies could not be held liable for any injuries the plaintiff suffered 
from the action of the Secretary of Labor. Id. at 671. "
1006,4," Had petitioning been involved in only one of these two steps, immunity would still have been conferred. In prior cases applying 
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, including Noerr itself, only one petitioning activity has been involved. Had only one of the two 
""prongs"" involved petitioning, immunity would still preclude MedImmune's antitrust claims because either through resolving 
priority or resolving other patent issues, petitioning would still have been involved in obtaining the New Cabilly patent. Immunity 
protects not only the petitioning activity, but other related activity as well: The Noerr Court also rejected the proposition that petitioning immunity was limited to injuries flowing directly from 
governmental action. It held that the railroads were also shielded from liability for the harm the truckers suffered in their 
relationships with their customers. In the Court's view, that injury was 'incidental' to the defendants' campaign to influence 
legislation. To impose liability for such incidental effects would 'be tantamount to outlawing' the petitioning activity itself. Sessions Tank Liners, Inc. v. Joor Manufacturing, Inc., 17 F.3d 295, 299 (9th Cir. 1994). Even if only one ""prong"" were held to 
be protected petitioning activity, the Defendants' involvement in the other ""prong"" would likely be incidental activity as described 
in Joor. "
1007,5," As is discussed further in Part II, even if MedImmune's argument were correct and priority could have been resolved without 
government action, petitioning was still a necessary part of the application for the New Cabilly patent. As is illustrated by the 
PTO's refusal to obey Judge Chesney's order and issue the New Cabilly patent once Judge Chesney had declared Genentech 
the winner of the priority dispute, the PTO does not act ministerially in issuing patents, even when priority has been resolved. 
Cabilly v. Boss, 60 U.S.P.Q. 1752, 1756 (Bd. Pat. App. & Interf. 2001)."
1007,6," That § 1.662 is not ministerial provides further support for the idea that an inquiry into whether non-governmental alternatives 
are available is meaningless. Even if the § 253 procedure had been employed, there is no guarantee that this would have 
resolved priority. This Court cannot fault the parties for proceeding in a manner that had more certainty - petitioning Judge 
Chesney for an Order that the Board was willing to accept as determinative as to priority. See Cabilly v. Boss, 60 U.S.P.Q.2d 
1752, 1757 (2001). "
1008,7," MedImmune makes one antitrust argument that does not depend on the issuance of the New Cabilly patent. This argument - 
that Genentech and Celltech engaged in illegal price fixing - is addressed in Part III of this Analysis. "
1009,8," Neither party has alleged that the sham exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine applies in this case. MedImmune does 
allege that the Defendants made misrepresentations to Judge Chesney, and misrepresentations can make litigation into a sham, 
Kottle, 146 F.3d at 1060, but Part I(C) of this Analysis explains that misrepresentations have not be adequately alleged. "
1010,9," When filing its Amended Complaint, MedImmune assured this Court that it was making changes to its inequitable conduct claim 
to ""make it consistent with the Court's Order dated August 11, 2003."" The August 11, 2003 Order to which MedImmune refers 
granted Genentech's Motion to Dismiss an inequitable conduct claim but allowed MedImmune leave to amend it. In defending 
against this Motion to Dismiss, MedImmune argued that the heightened pleading standard of FRCP Rule 9(b) applied only to 
fraud claims. MedImmune took pains to distinguish its inequitable conduct claim from a fraud claims. See Plaintiff MedImmune, 
Inc's Opposition to Motion by Defendant Genentech, Inc. to Dismiss the Third and Eleventh Causes of Action (filed July 14, 
2003) at 9. It now appears that MedImmune is trying to argue that in amending its inequitable conduct claim, it converted it into a 
fraud claim. This argument is both disingenuous and, as is discussed in more detail above, not supported by the pleadings. "
1011,10," In addition to these two preliminary problems, this Court's review of the ARLA leads to the conclusion that price-fixing is not a 
part of the agreement. Section 3.02 of the agreement lists ""Royalties Payable by Genentech for Third Party Products."" The first 
five sub-parts of § 3.02 list specific products for which Celltech was receiving royalties under the Boss patent, and specifies the 
royalty rate that Genentech would pass-through for sales of that product once Genentech owned the patent to the technology. 
ARLA § 3.02(a)-(e), Winters Declaration, Ex. 14, pp. 11-14 (filed under seal October 31, 2002). The paragraph about which 
MedImmune complains provides: "
1012,," Genentech shall be obligated to pay Celltech the royalties specified in paragraphs 3.02(a)-(e) on Net Sales by a third party 
licensee or sublicensee of a particular Antibody product only if the amount of payments received by Genentech in a 
Calendar Quarter from its third party licensee or sublicensee for such product, after deduction of the portion thereof that 
Genentech is obligated to pay to the City of Hope, equals or exceeds the royalty owed to Celltech in such Calendar Quarter 
for such Net Sales. Genentech shall, and Genentech shall require that its Affiliates shall, i) use best efforts to impose upon 
all third parties which are the licensees and sublicensees with respect to the Antibody products referred to in paragraphs 
3.02(a)-(e) an obligation to pay to Genentech (or the relevant Affiliate) an amount at least sufficient to meet the royalty 
obligations set out in paragraphs 3.02(a)-(e), and ii) use reasonable and diligent efforts in good faith to collect such 
amounts from such third parties. ARLA  §  3.02(f), Winters Dec. Ex. 14 pp.14. The paragraph continues on to make provisions that would take effect if Genentech 
did not collect from third parties royalties in the amounts promised to Genentech. This include passing-through the lesser royalty 
amount and accruing the remainder for payment at a later time.Id. at pp. 14-15. This paragraph requires Genentech to attempt to 
maintain at least the royalty rates that Celltech was receiving so that Celltech receives the consideration it is expecting from 
ceding priority, but it does not set a minimum royalty rate at which a license to the Cabilly Patent will be set. Although this Court 
declines to decide the price fixing issue because of the pleading and standing problems discussed in the text, it is unlikely that 
such a claim would be successful. "
1021,1," The defendants are Gruma Corporation, individually, as successor to Mission Foods Corporation and Guerrero Mexican Food 
Products, Inc., and d/b/a Mission Foods Corporation and Guerrero Mexican Food Products, and Azteca Milling LP. These 
defendants are collectively referred to as Gruma. In the plaintiffs' original pleadings, various plaintiffs brought suit against Bimbo Bakeries USA, Inc., Tia Rosa Bakery of Texas, 
Inc., and Mrs. Baird's Bakeries Business Trust. These defendants were dismissed pursuant to a settlement. See Instrument No. 
46."
1021,2," The plaintiffs are El Aguila Food Products, Inc.; La Ranchera Food Products, Inc., La Reina, Inc.; Anita's Mexican Foods Corp.; 
La Espiga De Oro, Inc.; Gilbert Moreno Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a La Monita; La Favorita Incorporated; Mex-Pro, Inc.; La Tapatia

d/b/a Capistran Tortillas; Walter Molina d/b/a Dos Molinos Tortilla Heaven; California Mexican Foods, Inc.; Mexican Food 
Specialties, Inc.; Sanitary Tortilla Manufacturing, Ltd.; JCFW, Inc. d/b/a Caliente Distributors; and Lompoc Tortilla Shop."
1021,3," The CMA Agreement has been regularly used in other product markets. It appears to have come of age in the tortilla market in 
the early to mid-90s. It generally speaks to product placement in the store, shelf space, and financial incentives to the retailers. "
1022,4," ""Market power"" is the power to control prices or exclude competition. The ""inquiry is to determine whether an arrangement has 
the potential for genuine adverse affects on competition. See Great Western Directories v. S. W. Bell Telephone, 63 F.3d 1378, 
1384 (5th Cir. 1995) (citing to United States v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 377, 391, 100 L. Ed. 1264, 76 S. Ct. 
994 (1956)."
1022,5," As part of the CMA negotiations, the plaintiffs and Gruma seek, to be named ""category captain."" Category captains assist the 
retailer in organizing the products by preparing schematics for placement of the products on shelves and in the store in general. 
The plaintiff asserts that when Gruma acts as category captain, they have little or no input, in the category design, and are 
placed in unfavorable positions on the shelves. The plaintiffs admit that the retailers, not Gruma, approve placements."
1022,6," A ""category captain"" is a leading supplier's employee who is responsible for recommending to the retailer an optimal product 
mix and promotional plans for a particular product category. See [Slotting Allowances in Retail Grocery Industry-FTC Study, 
II(B)(3) Nov. 2003]."
1022,7," Gruma markets its tortilla products under the names, Mission, Guerrero and La Predilecta. "
1024,8," Previously, the Court summarily denied the defendants' motions to strike and announced that the motion for summary judgment 
would be carried with the trial. However, the Court never intended to deny the defendants the opportunity to test the propriety of 
admitting the testimony of the plaintiffs' experts. Hence, the Court for convenience denied the defendants' motion in limine 
awaiting proffers. As the record stands, the Court has now heard the testimony of the plaintiffs' witnesses and, outside the 
presence of the jury, received the plaintiffs' expert testimony proffers. "
1025,9," Rule 702 instructs: HN2[
] If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to 
determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify 
thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: (1) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (2) the testimony is 
the product of reliable principles and methods; and, (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the 
facts of the case."
1025,10," To the extent that there is hearsay evidence concerning what the retailers thought or said, that evidence is stricken from the 
record. Such evidence was opposed and, if admitted at all, was admitted improvidently or for a limited purpose and not for the 
truth of the statements. "
1026,11," Dr. Gundlach participated in the cumulation of data that resulted in this report. In fact, he has been studying the effects of 
slotting fees and other incentives paid to retailer on the tortilla market and others for over 10 years. "
1027,12," The plaintiffs argue that considering Gruma's summary judgment and, thus the summary judgment evidence is improper at this 
point in time. This position overlooks the fact that to do so is not improper. Moreover, had Gruma presented its witnesses, the 
same evidence would have been presented. The plaintiffs had no evidence that contradicts the retailers' statements."
1027,13," Gruma presented in its summary judgment evidence some 19 declarations from the presidents, vice-president and directors of 
purchasing concerning Gruma's CMA Agreements, the limitation on space, placement of product, the meaning of terms used 
and the benefits to the retailer and its customers. See [Appendix to Summary Judgment, Ex. 7-25]. "
1029,14," Dr. McCoin relied upon a Tortilla Industry Association [TIA] study for the foundational data that drives his damage model. The 
TIA study was the result of a survey questionnaire that was sent to 517 companies believed to be manufacturers of the tortilla 
and tortilla brand products. It excluded companies that produced only fried products such as the tortilla chip, tacos and tostadas. 
Forty-seven (47) organizations, large and small, responded. Other data from independent market research was included and the 
report was published. The report concluded that tortillas represented $ 1.84 billion in sales in 1992. Of that sum, $ 1.2 billion was 
sold to the food services segment of the market Thus, $ .64 billion represents the retail sales market. The TIA report has been 
published annually since and shows a growth in the retail sales market from $ .64 billion in 1992 to over $ 1.7 billion in 2002. It is 
this annual growth rate that Dr. McCoin uses to determine the growth [loss sales] that the plaintiffs should have experienced. 
Thus, the assumption built into Dr. McCoin's damage model is that the plaintiffs' sales growth for the relevant years would 
proceed at the rate suggested by the market as a whole."
1029,15," Dr. McCoin acknowledges that there is an observable decline in the percentage of market growth year after year. He admits 
that the slowing in the growth rate may be attributable to a saturation of the market by tortilla companies. He also acknowledges 
an increase in dollars in the market due to an expansion in the market-more customers-more stores. "
1032,16," All of the evidence shows that Azteca is not a manufacturer of tortillas. Instead it provides corn mesa flour to tortilla product 
manufacturers, such as the plaintiffs and Gruma. The plaintiffs have failed to present any evidence that Azteca has conspired 
with Gruma to control the price of tortilla by controlling the price of corn mesa flour. Moreover, there is no evidence that any 
other illegal agreement exists between Azteca and Gruma. The evidence also shows that Azteca is owned 80% by Gruma, 
therefore, no conspiracy can exist between the two as a matter of law. The Court dismisses the plaintiffs' suit against Azteca with 
prejudice and will refer to Gruma Corporation, Mission Foods Corporation and any subsidiaries of Gruma Corporation as 
""Gruma."" "
1035,17," The irony of the plaintiffs' positions is revealed in Dr. Gundlach's supplemental report. In his supplemental expert report, Dr. 
Gundlach states that he has reviewed a contract between Gruma and Fred Meyer stores for northern and southern California, 
Arizona, Nevada and Utah. He observes that Gruma is ""required to have the lowest retail price in the subcategory when on 
promotion."" Dr. Gundlach calls this price fixing that ""restricts the price of competitors' products during promotions."" This is 
exactly what sale prices are intended to do-cause competitors to reduce or maintain current prices."
1035,18," At the end of the day, the plaintiffs announced that they had called their last witness The Court informed counsel that the Court 
wanted to take proffers from the plaintiffs' expert witnesses. The following day, the plaintiff announced that they were not ready 
to close their evidence and wanted to offer the testimony of the various plaintiffs' controllers and bookkeepers. The Court refused 
to permit this testimony because it did not address causation or damages as originally pled by the plaintiffs. Moreover, the 
witnesses were not designated as such and were not presented as possible witnesses until the Court rejected Dr. McCoin's 
testimony. "
1046,1," Defendants informed the court during a December 10, 2003, teleconference that their antitrust counterclaim rests 
predominantly on § 15.05(c) of the TFEAA. "
1048,2," Both of these types of restraints are known as ""vertical"" restraints because they involve ""agreements between firms at different 
levels of the chain of distribution."" STEPHEN F. ROSS, PRINCIPLES OF ANTITRUST LAW 224 (The Foundation Press 1993). 
Vertical restraints on trade, including tying and exclusive dealing, may also be challenged under § 15.05(a). Cf. Times-Picayune 
Pub. Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 608, 97 L. Ed. 1277, 73 S. Ct. 872 (1953) (stating that tying arrangements are improper 
under both the Clayton Act and the Sherman Act); Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 44-45, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 
104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (stating that exclusive dealing arrangements are subject to scrutiny under the 
Sherman Act); Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 723-24, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808, 108 S. Ct. 1515 
(1988) (stating that Sherman Act § 1 prohibits vertical non-price restraints that unreasonably restrain trade). In Tampa Electric 
Company v. Nashville Coal Company, 365 U.S. 320, 335, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623 (1961), the Supreme Court found that 
when vertical arrangements do not violate Clayton Act § 3, they also do not violate the Sherman Act. In Texas, therefore, when 
arrangements do not violate § 15.05(c), they also do not violate §§ 15.05(a)& (b). Winston, 930 S.W.2d at 951; Caller-Times 
Pub. Co., Inc., 826 S.W.2d at 580; Apani Southwest, Inc., 128 F. Supp.2d at 995. Alleged vertical restraints on trade are 
generally analyzed the same way whether the claim is brought under § 15.05(a) or § 15.05(c). Cf. Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. 
No. 2, 466 U.S. at 44-46 (in which Justices O'Connor, Burger, Powell and Rehnquist cited Tampa Electric Co., 365 U.S. 320, 5 
L. Ed. 2d 580, 81 S. Ct. 623, and Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 337 U.S. 293, 93 L. Ed. 1371, 69 S. Ct. 1051 -- cases 
regarding the standards for imposing liability under § 3 of the Clayton Act (also § 15.05(c)) -- to determine the standards for "
1049,," imposing liability under § 1 of the Sherman Act (also § 15.05(a))). Under either § 15.05(c) or § 15.05(a), the crux of successfully 
asserting a claim based on exclusive dealing is demonstrating that a ""significant fraction of buyers or sellers are frozen out of a 
market by the exclusive deal."" Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2, 466 U.S. at 45. It is therefore appropriate, where claimants 
have alleged an exclusive dealing arrangement that violates § 15.05 generally, to consider first whether the arrangement 
violates § 15.05(c) specifically."
1049,3," More recently, the Fifth Circuit discussed the nature of the Clayton Act § 3 prohibition on tying in Apani, 300 F.3d at 625. In 
Apani, the Fifth Circuit cites Kaiser Aluminum for the proposition that ""tying restraints occur when a seller agrees to sell one 
product on the condition that the buyer also agree to purchases (sic) a different, or tied product, or the buyer agrees that he will 
not purchase the same product from another supplier."" Id. (emphasis added) (citing Kaiser Aluminum, 677 F.2d at 1048 n.5). 
This statement appears to suggest that an illegal tying relationship has occurred when a seller conditions the sale of a product 
on the purchaser's agreement not to purchase any quantity of that same product from another seller. Defendants, at least, have 
interpreted it that way. See Defs.' Mem. in Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 7. Such an arrangement, however, is not the typical 
tying arrangement. Tying arrangements are generally found when a seller with market power in one product market conditions 
the sale of a product from that market (the tying product) on the purchaser's agreement to purchase another of that seller's 
products from a market in which the seller does not have market power (the tied product). Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v. 
Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 13 n.19, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984). In short, tying requires two separate products. Jefferson 
Parish, 466 U.S. at 24-25. As the Supreme Court has stated, ""the essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies in 
the seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force the buyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer 
either did not want at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on different terms. When such 'forcing' is present, 
competition on the merits in the market for the tied item is restrained . . .."" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 12. "
1051,4," Plaintiff has cited Nine West Shoes Antitrust Litigation, 80 F. Supp. 2d 181, 191 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (stating that ""the complaint 
'must identify the co-conspirators, and describe the nature and effects of the alleged conspiracy'""); Estate Construction Co. v. 
Miller & Smith Holding Co., Inc., 14 F.3d 213, 221 (4th Cir. 1994) (stating that ""in order to adequately allege an antitrust 
conspiracy, the pleader must 'provide, whenever possible, some details of the time, place and alleged effect of the conspiracy; it 
is not enough merely to state that a conspiracy has taken place'""); Aquatherm Indus., Inc. v. Florida Power & Light Co., 145 F.3d 
1258, 1261 (11th Cir. 1998) (dismissing claim in which the plaintiff identified the defendant's co-conspirators ""only as 
'manufacturers and sellers of electric pool heat pumps,' and specified no fact in support of this allegation""); and JM Computer 
Services, Inc. v. Schlumberger Technologies, Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21885, 1996 WL 241607, at *3 (N.D. Ca. 1996) 
(stating that the plaintiff's claim was insufficiently pled because ""Plaintiff has failed to identify the other participant(s) in the 
agreement or conspiracy which Plaintiff claims violates § 1""). In opposition, Defendants have cited Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Arch Associates Corp., 908 F.Supp 265, 269 (E.D. Pa. 1995) 
(finding that the plaintiff had adequately pled concerted action by stating that ""HP, in concert with certain members of its 
authorized distribution network, … unlawfully conspired and combined in an effort to expand its monopoly and to further restrain 
trade""); and American Health Sys. v. Crozer-Keystone Health Sys., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18060 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (finding that 
the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged concerted action despite only making a ""vague reverence . . . to 'various other persons, 
entities and corporations' who participated as co-conspirators""). "
1065,*, The Honorable Fred I. Parker participated in the in banc oral argument of this appeal but died before this opinion was filed. 
1067,1," Inasmuch as the defendants were prosecuted under sections 1341 and 1343 in combination with section 1346, we have no 
occasion to consider whether they would also have been prosecutable under sections 1341 or 1343, standing alone. "
1069,2," By contrast, where First Amendment rights are at stake: The test we employ is familiar. Because conduct and not merely speech is involved, the overbreadth of a statute must not 
only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. We will not topple a statute 
merely because we can conceive of a few impermissible applications. The possibility of a substantial number of realistic 
applications in contravention of the First Amendment, however, suffices to overturn a statute on its face. In this regard, it 
bears emphasizing that the penalty to be imposed is relevant in determining whether demonstrable overbreadth is 
substantial. Although the fact that a criminal prohibition is involved does not obviate the need for the inquiry or a priori 
warrant a finding of substantial overbreadth, it does appreciably shrink the amount of overbreadth we will find 
constitutionally tolerable, particularly when the penalty is severe. Massachusetts v. Oakes, 491 U.S. 576, 595-96, 105 L. Ed. 2d 493, 109 S. Ct. 2633 (1989) (citations and internal quotation 
marks and punctuation omitted). "
1070,3," In briefly outlining the history of facial challenges, we have noted that competing views in the Supreme Court have been set out 
in dicta and that, in our view, section 1346 withstands facial scrutiny under either. We therefore need not adopt, and do not 
mean to suggest our preference for, either. "
1071,4," Sections 1341 was subsequently amended to apply to frauds carried out through private mail carriers. Violent Crime Control 
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-322, Title XXV, § 250006, 108 Stat. 2087 (1994). Sections 1341 and 1343 
have also been amended to eliminate the $ 1,000 limit on fines, id. Title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(H), 108 Stat. 2147, and to increase 
the maximum sentence for violations not affecting a financial institution to twenty years' imprisonment, Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
2002, Pub.L. No. 107-204, Title IX, § 903, 116 Stat. 745 (2002)."
1071,5," The fourth category does not include private actors who scheme to defraud others of intangible property, who remain subject to 
the mail-and wire-fraud statutes even after McNally held that deprivation of honest services was not covered by those statutes. 
See Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19, 27-28, 98 L. Ed. 2d 275, 108 S. Ct. 316 (1987); cf. United States v. Kent, 608 F.2d 
542, 546 (5th Cir. 1979) (upholding fraud conviction of draftsman employed by an oil company paid by a competitor to purloin 
data regarding prospective well locations and bids on leases for land containing oil), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 936 (1980). "
1072,6," Whether we are to examine 18 U.S.C. § 1346 on its face or as applied to the facts of the case before us to determine whether it 
is unconstitutionally vague is addressed in section V.E, below. "
1073,7," The panel continued: Several circuits, addressing this concern, have interpreted ""scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of 
honest services"" in such a way as to properly curtail the statute's reach. See, e.g., [United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers, 
329 U.S. App. D.C. 149, 138 F.3d 961, 973 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (recognizing ""the risk that federal criminal liability could 
metastasize"" if § 1346 were read too broadly); Frost, 125 F.3d at 365-69 (noting breadth of literal terms of § 1346 and 
discussing various approaches to defining reach of statute); United States v. Cochran, 109 F.3d 660, 667 (10th Cir. 1997) 
(observing that ""it would give [the court] great pause if a right to honest services is violated by every breach of contract or 
every misstatement made in the course of dealing""); United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1077 (1st Cir. 1997) 
(noting that Congress did not enact § 1346 ""to create what amounts to a draconian personnel regulation""); United States v. 
Jain, 93 F.3d 436, 441-42 (8th Cir. 1996) (discussing problems with extending ""honest services"" doctrine to private sector); 
cf. United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 728 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding, in context of misconduct by state government 
employees, that ""to allow every transgression of state governmental obligations to amount to mail fraud would effectively 
turn every such violation into a federal felony; this cannot be countenanced""). Rybicki, 287 F.3d at 264-65 (second and third alterations in original); see also Handakas, 286 F.3d at 109 (""Even the circuits that 
have reinstated pre-McNally law recognize that ad hoc parameters are needed to give the statute shape."" (citations omitted))."
1073,8," In Neder, the Court held that materiality is an element of ""a scheme or artifice to defraud"" under the federal mail fraud, 18 
U.S.C. § 1341, wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1344, statutes, even though the statutes do not use 
the term. 527 U.S. at 20-21. The Court concluded that at the times of enactment of these statutes, ""fraud"" had ""a well-settled 
meaning at common law,"" id. at 22, that included materiality, and the Court therefore ""presumed that Congress intended to 
incorporate materiality,"" id. at 23 (emphasis in original). "
1074,9,"  The strong presumptive validity that attaches to an Act of Congress has led [the] Court to hold many times that statutes are 
not automatically invalidated as vague simply because difficulty is found in determining whether certain marginal offenses 
fall within their language. E.g., Jordan v. De George, 341 U.S. 223, 231, 95 L. Ed. 886, 71 S. Ct. 703 (1951), and United 
States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7, 91 L. Ed. 1877, 67 S. Ct. 1538 (1947). Indeed, we have consistently sought an 
interpretation which supports the constitutionality of legislation. E.g., United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41, 47, 97 L. Ed. 
770, 73 S. Ct. 543 (1953); Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62, 76 L. Ed. 598, 52 S. Ct. 285 (1932); see Screws v. United 
States, 325 U.S. 91, 89 L. Ed. 1495, 65 S. Ct. 1031 (1945). Parker, 417 U.S. at 757 (1974) (quoting United States v. National Dairy Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 32, 9 L. Ed. 2d 561, 83 S. Ct. 594 
(1963)); see also, e.g., Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234, 268, 152 L. Ed. 2d 403, 122 S. Ct. 1389 (2002) 
(Rehnquist, C.J., dissenting) (arguing that a statute should be given a limiting construction, citing Parker, rather than struck 
down). Parker, upheld the constitutionality of certain provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, after applying ""the 
standard which applies to criminal statutes regulating economic affairs,"" Parker, 417 U.S. at 756, a category undoubtedly 
including the mail and wire fraud statutes."
1074,10," Although the McNally Court spoke of its fear of ""construing the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous 
and involves the Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials,"" 483 
U.S. at 360, the Court did not focus on federalism concerns. Perhaps it can be argued nonetheless, in light of the Supreme 
Court's later Commerce Clause cases, that if Congress wants to federalize such crimes it should do so in definite terms. Cf. 
United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 339, 30 L. Ed. 2d 488, 92 S. Ct. 515 (1971) (holding that Congress must speak clearly 
when it legislates in areas of criminal law that are traditionally regulated by the states); Cleveland v. United States, 531 U.S. 12, 
27, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221, 121 S. Ct. 365 (2000) (""Absent clear statement by Congress, we will not read the mail fraud statute to 
place under federal superintendence a vast array of conduct traditionally policed by the States.""). Some joining this opinion are of the view that this argument, although linked to the alleged vagueness of the statute, may be 
more powerful than vagueness alone. That is, the statute, as they read it, does not present serious problems either with respect 
to letting individuals know that their behavior violates the law, or leaving too much uncontrolled discretion to police or 
prosecutors. See Kolender, 461 U.S. at 357. The potentially more serious charge, they think, would be that Congress did not 
make clear enough how far it intended to enter into areas that have traditionally been governed by state law, and that this 
federalism concern, rather than vagueness, is the source of possible constitutional difficulties. We think, however, that when 
Congress enacted section 1346 in the light of the pre-McNally cases, it spoke with sufficient clarity to obviate the danger that 
federal courts, rather than Congress, would determine how deeply into traditionally state concerns the federal government 
ventured. "
1075,11," This is not a principle somehow peculiar to the Sherman Act, as the dissent suggests. For example, Neder itself, like the case 
at bar, was a mail- and wire-fraud case. And in Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 U.S. 489, 502, 134 L. Ed. 2d 130, 116 S. Ct. 1065 
(1996), the Supreme Court took a similar approach to the interpretation of ERISA: To decide whether [a party's] actions fall within the statutory definition of ""fiduciary"" acts, we must interpret the statutory 
terms which limit the scope of fiduciary activity to discretionary acts of plan ""management"" and ""administration."" ERISA § 
3(21)(A). These words are not self-defining, and the activity at issue here neither falls clearly within nor outside of the 
common understanding of these words. . . . Though dictionaries sometimes help in such matters, we believe it more 
important here to look to the common law, which, over the years, has given to terms such as ""fiduciary"" and trust 
""administration"" a legal meaning to which, we normally presume, Congress meant to refer. See, e.g., Nationwide Mut. Ins. 
Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 322, 117 L. Ed. 2d 581, 112 S. Ct. 1344 (1992)."
1075,12," We note a similar argument that has been made in a different context: See John Paul Stevens, The Freedom of Speech, 102 
Yale L.J. 1293, 1296 (1993) (""I emphasize the word 'the' as used in the term 'the freedom of speech' [in the First Amendment] 
because the definite article suggests that the draftsmen intended to immunize a previously defined category or subset of 
speech.""); William Van Alstyne, A Graphic Review of the Free Speech Clause, 70 Cal. L. Rev. 107, 116 (1982) (discussing ""the 
distinction between that speech within 'the' freedom of speech [which receives special protection under the First Amendment] 
and that speech not within it.""). While we find the parallel interesting, we of course have no occasion here to analyze, and do not 
endorse, the argument in the First Amendment context."
1075,13," Our starting point in compiling a list of these cases is, as it was in Handakas, 286 F.3d at 101-02, the pre-McNally private 
sector ""honest services"" cases catalogued by Justice Stevens in his dissent in McNally, 483 U.S. at 363-64 nn.3 & 4. The cases

States, 174 F.2d 754 (6th Cir. 1949). United States v. Louderman, 576 F.2d 1383 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 896, 58 L. Ed. 2d 243 (1978), and United States v. 
Condolon, 600 F.2d 7 (4th Cir. 1979), are referred to in one of the footnotes following the discussion of ""honest services"" in 
Justice Stevens's McNally dissent, 483 U.S. at 363-64 n.4, but neither of them employs that term ""honest services"" or seems to 
involve an honest services fraud. Louderman involved the defendants' acquisition of confidential information from telephone 
companies and the post office for purposes of furthering their ""skip tracing"" business. The Ninth Circuit noted ""a loss to the 
subscribers of their right to privacy, and telephone subscribers and post office box holders were being deprived of part of the 
service for which they were paying."" Louderman, 576 F.2d at 1387. The defendants in Louderman are more properly 
characterized as depriving the victims of intangible rights, namely the right to privacy. Condolon -- in which the Fourth Circuit 
upheld a wire-fraud conviction of a man who used the wires to procure sexual favors by pretending to be a talent agent -- should 
similarly be characterized as a privacy case. Louderman and Condolon are thus not 'honest services' cases because of the 
nature of the litigation, not because, as the dissent suggests, were they to fall within the scope of section 1346, the wire- and 
mail-fraud statutes would be rendered unconstitutionally vague. United States v. Curry, 681 F.2d 406, 411 (5th Cir. 1982) (PAC chairman convicted of depriving the members of their right to his 
""honest, true and faithful services as chairman"" by taking for himself money that should have been given to candidates), is also 
listed in Justice Stevens' dissent, McNally, 483 U.S. at 363-64 n.4, but is essentially an embezzlement case. "
1077,14," Because federal law imposes special duties of loyalty on union officials, analysis of such cases may depart from analysis of 
other private sector cases."
1077,15," The Sixth Circuit found the dealing nonetheless to be ""fair"" and therefore reversed mail-fraud convictions remarking that ""it 
must . . . be concluded that the failure to make . . . disclosure [of the secret ownership in the supplier] did not clothe this 
otherwise fair course of dealing with intentional fraud, dishonest in purpose, and inconsistent with moral uprightness.""  174 F.2d 
at 768. "
1078,16," United States v. Bronston, 658 F.2d 920 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 915, 72 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1982), was atypical. A 
partner in a New York law firm undertook, and was paid for, representing a personal client in its pursuit of a contractual 
relationship, while knowing that his firm was representing a competing client seeking the same contract. The defendant was 
convicted of mail fraud and we affirmed, reading the ""theft of honest services"" crime broadly, and finding a possibility of 
detriment in the firm's client's loss of ""the precise interest which [the firm] had been retained to defend."" Id. at 930. But the 
defendant neither personally represented the firm's client nor used confidential information acquired through the representation 
to his own client's advantage. The risk of detriment to the firm's client was that an adverse party was represented by the attorney 
it wanted. Although the firm's client did risk losing the contract it sought, this risk was not caused by a loss of honest services. Cf. 
Coffee, supra, 19 Am. Crim. L. Rev, at 130-34 (criticizing Bronston)."
1078,17," Although the bulk of the pre-McNally honest-services cases involved employees, we see no reason the principle they establish 
would not apply to other persons who assume a legal duty of loyalty comparable to that owed by an officer or employee to a 
private entity. See, e.g., United States v. Szur, 289 F.3d 200, 208-12 (2d Cir. 2002) (affirming honest services mail and wire 
fraud convictions of principals of a brokerage and issuer of securities who conspired to pay stock brokers excess compensation, 
not disclosed to their customers, for selling the issuer's securities); United States v. Manas, 272 F.3d 159, 161-63 (2d Cir. 2001) 
(reviewing sentences of defendants convicted of, inter alia, honest services fraud for a broker bribery scheme similar to that at 
issue in Szur), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 533 (2002) & 123 S. Ct. 1003 (2003); United States v. Ervasti, 201 F.3d 1029, 1032-36 
(8th Cir. 2000) (upholding honest services mail and wire fraud convictions of principals of a payroll processing company who 
failed to make payments to the IRS on behalf of customers, instead using the funds to pay their own expenses); United States v. 
Sancho, 157 F.3d 918 (2d Cir. 1998) (upholding honest services wire fraud conviction of a defendant who offered a bribe to an 
FBI agent posing as a financial consultant retained to perform due diligence on the defendant in connection with the issuance of 
a letter of credit, in exchange for a falsely positive due diligence report) (per curiam), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1162, 143 L. Ed. 2d 
79 (1999); United States v. Cochran, 109 F.3d 660, 667-68 (10th Cir. 1997) (analyzing, for honest-services fraud purposes, the 
duty owed by an investment banker hired to advise and assist a state in issuing bonds). "
1080,18, We do not consider the application of section 1346 to the contractual situations discussed by Judge Raggi in her concurrence.
1080,19," The dissent insists that the statement from Sancho that we address was not a dictum. If so, to that extent, Sancho is 
overruled. "
1081,20," We do understand that this creates something of an overlap: The phrase ""scheme or artifice to defraud"" requires ""material 
misrepresentations."" See United States v. Autuori, 212 F.3d 105, 115 (2d Cir. 2000) (""As to the [scheme to defraud], the 
government was required to prove (i) the existence of a scheme to defraud, (ii) the requisite scienter (or fraudulent intent) on the 
part of the defendant, and (iii) the materiality of the misrepresentations."" (citations omitted)); see also Neder, 527 U.S. at 25 
(""We hold that HN29[
] materiality of falsehood is an element of the federal mail fraud, wire fraud, and bank fraud statutes.""). "
1085,1," Although defendants' vagueness challenge is specifically to § 1346, because that statute only defines conduct proscribed by § 
1341 and § 1343, a court must consider all elements of mail and wire fraud in determining whether the public and the police are 
given fair notice of what constitutes the crime."
1085,2," Because the federal fraud statutes only reach deceitful schemes specifically intended to cause harm, they survive a facial 
vagueness challenge even under the Morales standard of review. "
1087,3," To the extent our dissenting colleagues also sound a federalism alarm to § 1346, warning that application of the statute to the 
public sector ""invites federal prosecutors to police honesty in the corridors of state government,"" dissent at 26, I am not 
persuaded that this threatens the Republic. Because § 1346 is not here applied to a public sector fraud, however, I leave further 
debate on this issue for another day. Nevertheless, I do question whether the vagueness challenge before us has anything to do with federalism. If courts were to 
hold ""the intangible right to honest services"" too vague to satisfy due process in a federal statute, they would presumably be 
obliged to strike down the same language in state statutes. See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 13-2310(E) (2003) (defining ""scheme or 
artifice to defraud"" to include ""a scheme or artifice to deprive a person of the intangible right of honest services""); 720 Ill. Comp. 
Stat. 5/17-24(e)(1)(2003) (defining ""scheme or artifice to defraud"" to include schemes ""to deprive another of the intangible right 
to honest services""); 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/16H-25(2)(2003) (same, but in the financial institution context); Md. Ann. Code § 8-
509 (2002) (making it a crime knowingly and willfully ""to defraud a State health plan of the right to honest services""); R.I. Gen. 
Laws § 19-9-29 (2003) (defining bank fraud to include ""a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right to honest 
services""). In short, a vagueness ruling would mean no sovereignty, state or federal, could prosecute ""honest services"" frauds. To the extent footnote 10 of the majority opinion somewhat cryptically alludes to a federalism argument that ""may be more 
powerful than vagueness alone,"" I await the clear presentation of such an argument to a particular case before expressing any 
view as to its availability, let alone its merits. "
1088,4," Neither in McNally nor in the ""honest services"" cases that preceded it does a court appear to have ruled that the concept is too 
vague to permit constitutional application. "
1093,1," The majority ultimately relies on the reductionist argument that these defendants must have known that it would be illegal ""to 
use the wires and the mails . . . to pay off insurance adjustors."" [Maj. Op. at 37] The natural drift of this observation is that the 
scheme inflated the settlement of claims to the benefit of the defendants' clients and to the detriment of the insurance 
companies. However, the government never contended that this occurred. As the majority opinion recites, ""the government 
acknowledged that it would not seek to prove that the amount of any of the settlements connected with a payment to an adjuster 
had been inflated above what would have been a reasonable range for that settlement."" [Maj. Op. at 6] There was certainly no 
reason for these defendants to believe that the gratuities at issue--which the government never contended caused a loss--
amounted to a federal mail or wire fraud violation. "
1102,1," Before Illinois Brick, six of seven federal circuit courts ruling on the issue had held that indirect purchasers could sue for 
damages caused by a violation of the federal antitrust laws. Illinois v. Ampress Brick Co. (C.A.7, 1976), 536 F.2d 1163, reversed

The requirement of an antitrust injury imposed upon the plaintiff the burden to show not merely any type of injury causally linked 
to an illegal presence in the market, but, rather, an injury of the type that the antitrust laws intended to prevent--i.e., an injury 
directly resulting from the anticompetitive aspect of the defendant's behavior. Id. at 344, 110 S. Ct. 1884."

purchaser is not ""the person injured."" "
1105,10," Although we have couched the issue as one of standing, it should be noted that there is some debate in the cases whether 
Illinois Brick is concerned with standing or the definition of injury. As the court in Illinois Brick noted, the questions of who has 
standing and which persons have sustained injury are ""analytically distinct,"" and its precise holding was that the direct 
purchaser, not the indirect purchaser, was the one injured for the purposes of federal antitrust law. Illinois Brick, supra, at 728, 
97 S. Ct. 2061, fn. 7. While we acknowledge this analytic distinction, the two concepts merge for practical purposes and we use 
the word standing, admittedly loosely, to denote a person who has sustained an injury sufficient to give rise to an actionable 
claim."
1105,11," See fn. 2, supra. As the court noted in Mid-West Paper Products, it is arguable that injunctive relief may still be available to an 
indirect purchaser even after Illinois Brick since such equitable non-monetary relief would not be complicated by pass-on 
theories as would a claim for treble damages. "

plaintiff gasoline-station owner was required to sell one product tied to another to his customers as part of what he alleged was 
an effort by the oil company to convert his leased station to a company-owned station. The case may stand for the proposition 
that a company may commit both antitrust violations and unfair or unconscionable sales practices at the same time, but it does 
not stand for the proposition that all anticompetitive behavior is a sales practice under the CPSA."

1136,3," The nationwide base payments begin at $ 4.5 billion for the year 2000 and gradually increase to $ 9 billion in the year 2018 and 
each year thereafter. "
1137,4," If the OPM's market share loss exceeds 16 2/3%, the decrease in payment obligations is somewhat less than the treble 
reduction for losses between 2% and 16 2/3%. See MSA at 50."
1137,5," New York's Escrow Statute provides in part as follows: HN3[
] Any tobacco product manufacturer selling cigarettes to consumers within the state (whether directly or through a 
distributor, retailer or similar intermediary or intermediaries) after the effective date of this article shall do one of the 
following:"
1137,1," . become a participating manufacturer (as that term is defined in section II(jj) of the master settlement agreement) and 
generally perform its financial obligations under the master settlement agreement; or"
1137,2," . (a) place into a qualified escrow fund by April fifteenth of the year following the year in question the following amounts (as 
such amounts are adjusted for inflation): (i) 1999: $ . 0094241 per unit sold after the effective date of this section; (ii) 2000: $ . 0104712 per unit sold; (iii) for each of 2001 and 2002: $ . 0136125 per unit sold; (iv) for each of 2003 through 2006: $ . 0167539 per unit sold; (v) for each of 2007 and each year thereafter: $ . 0188482 per unit sold.

1138,," (b) a tobacco product manufacturer that places funds into escrow pursuant to paragraph (a) shall receive the interest or 
other appreciation on such funds as earned. Such funds themselves shall be released from escrow only under the following 
circumstances: (i) to pay a judgment or settlement on any released claim brought against such tobacco product manufacturer by the state 
or any releasing party located or residing in the state. Funds shall be released from escrow under this subparagraph: (A) in 
the order in which they were placed into escrow and (B) only to the extent and at the time necessary to make payments 
required under such judgment or settlement; (ii) to the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a 
particular year was greater than the state's allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been 
required to make in that year under the master settlement agreement (as determined pursuant to section IX(i)(2) of the 
master settlement agreement, and before any of the adjustments or offsets described in section IX(i)(3) of that agreement 
other than the inflation adjustment) had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and 
revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer; or (iii) to the extent not released from escrow under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, funds shall be released from 
escrow and revert back to such tobacco product manufacturer twenty-five years after the date on which they were placed 
into escrow. N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-pp (2002). "
1139,6," For purposes of this opinion, we use the terms ""wholesalers"" and ""tax stamp agents"" interchangeably."

] § 480-b. Prohibition against the stamping of certain cigarettes"
1139,1," . Every tobacco product manufacturer as defined by section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-oo of the public health law 
whose cigarettes are sold for consumption in this state shall annually certify under penalty of perjury that, as of the date of 
such certification, such tobacco product manufacturer: (a) is a participating manufacturer as defined in subdivision one of 
section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-pp of the public health law; or (b) is in full compliance with subdivision two of section 
thirteen hundred ninety-nine-pp of the public health law. Such certification shall be executed and delivered to the 
commissioner, the attorney general and any agent who affixes New York state cigarette tax stamps to cigarettes of such 
tobacco product manufacturer, no earlier than the sixteenth day of April and no later than the thirtieth day of April of each 
year, and shall be accompanied by a list setting forth each of the cigarette brands of such tobacco product manufacturer 
sold for consumption in New York state. Agents shall retain such certifications for a period of five years."
1139,2," . An agent may not affix, or cause to be affixed, a New York state cigarette tax stamp to a package of cigarettes if either: 
(a) the tobacco product manufacturer of such cigarettes has not provided such agent with the certification required by 
subdivision one of this section; or (b) the commissioner has notified such agent that such tobacco product manufacturer is 
in violation of section thirteen hundred ninety-nine-pp of the public health law, or has filed a false certification under 
subdivision one of this section, and such agent has not been notified by the commissioner that such violation has ceased."
1139,3," . The commissioner shall prescribe the form of the certification required to be filed pursuant to subdivision one of this

subdivision four of section 2.10 of such law, acting pursuant to his or her special duties, shall discover any cigarettes 
subject to tax provided by article twenty of this chapter or by chapter thirteen of title eleven of the administrative code of the

the state. . . . (a-1) Whenever a police officer designated in section 1.20 of the criminal procedure law or a peace officer designated in 
subdivision four of section 2.10 of such law, acting pursuant to his or her special duties, shall discover any cigarettes which 
have been stamped in violation of section four hundred eighty-b of this chapter, such officer is hereby authorized and 
empowered forthwith to seize and take possession of such cigarettes, and such cigarettes shall be subject to a forfeiture 
action pursuant to the procedures provided for in article thirteen-A of the civil practice law and rules, as if such article 
specifically provided for forfeiture of cigarettes seized pursuant to this section as a preconviction forfeiture crime. 
Subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to cigarettes seized pursuant to this subdivision. N.Y. Tax Law § 1846 (2002)."
1140,9," Section 481, subdiv. 1(c) provides as follows: HN9[
] In addition to any other penalties that may be imposed by law, the commissioner may impose a civil penalty not to 
exceed five thousand dollars against any tobacco product manufacturer or cigarette tax agent who violates the provisions of 
section four hundred eighty-b of this article, including but not limited to the filing of a false certification, and may seek to 
suspend or cancel any license which has been issued to such person pursuant to this chapter. N.Y. Tax Law § 481, subdiv. 1(c) (2002)."
1140,10," The complaint does not specify whether appellants are themselves licensed New York State tax stamp agents. Because 
appellants are bringing suit only on behalf of that class of firms who resell cigarettes to ""[wholesalers] having New York cigarette 
tax stamp licenses,"" Compl. P 1, at 2, we consider appellants solely as ""importers"" and not as ""wholesalers,"" or licensed New 
York State tax stamp agents. "
1141,11," While an allegation of such a wholly ""extraterritorial"" effect has been analyzed by the Second Circuit as a form of 
""disproportionate[] burden"" on interstate commerce under the Pike balancing test, see Nat'l Elec. Mfrs., 272 F.3d at 109-10 
(treating ""control of commerce that occurs wholly beyond the state's borders"" as a ""disparate"" burden triggering Pike balancing 
analysis), it may also be analyzed independently -- i.e., without reference to clear discrimination or disparate burdens -- as a 
question of regulatory jurisdiction rather than one of regulatory discrimination. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 336 (considering a 
dormant Commerce Clause challenge to the extraterritorial effect of a state statute without reference to Pike); Edgar v. MITE 
Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 643, 73 L. Ed. 2d 269, 102 S. Ct. 2629 (1982) (plurality opinion) (""The limits on a State's power to enact 
substantive legislation are similar to the limits on the jurisdiction of state courts. In either case, 'any attempt ""directly"" to assert 
extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons or property would offend sister States and exceed the inherent limits of the State's 
power.'"" (quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 197, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683, 97 S. Ct. 2569 (1977))); Automated Salvage Transp.,

an independent, per se ground for a statute's invalidation under the dormant Commerce Clause); Cotto Waxo Co. v. Williams, 46 
F.3d 790, 793 (8th Cir. 1995) (same)."
1142,12," Appellants' complaint arguably asserts only the first, ""clear discrimination"" form of dormant Commerce Clause violation, see 
Compl. P 42, at 18-19 (""[The Contraband Statutes] constitute[] a direct interference with interstate commerce. . . . Such 
favoritism, discrimination and economic protectionism per se violates the Commerce Clause.""). The district court held the 
Contraband Statutes not to be discriminatory and went on to hold that even under the second, ""Pike balancing test"" analysis any 
burden incidentally imposed by the Contraband Statutes was outweighed by the local benefits secured. Appellants' brief on 
appeal reiterates the claim of a ""clear discrimination"" form of Commerce Clause violation, see, e.g., Appellants' Br. at 19 (""The 
Contraband Statute constitutes a virtually per se violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.""); id. at 23 (""The protectionist 
objective is facially apparent""), but does not propose that we engage in a Pike ""incidental burdens"" analysis. In their reply brief, 
appellants advance for the first time a claim of the third, ""extraterritorial"" form of Commerce Clause violation described above. 
See Appellants' Reply Br. at 7 (citing Healy, 491 U.S. 324, 105 L. Ed. 2d 275, 109 S. Ct. 2491). "
1144,13," In this context, little danger of ""inconsistent legislation"" exists. In fact, a universal and practically uniform national system of 
payments by tobacco companies to states has been created. As noted, all of the Settling States have enacted the form Escrow 
Statute, see Compl. P 19, at 10, and 24 have passed Contraband Statutes, see Appellants' Rule 28(j) letter. Furthermore, each 
of the four states that did not join the MSA -- Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas -- settled individually with the major 
tobacco companies. See State v. Philip Morris, 179 Misc. 2d at 439-40 n. 3. These individual settlements were similar to the 
MSA; for example, in approving New York's participation in the MSA, the New York County Supreme Court stated that ""the MSA 
for New York contains every single public health provision found in the Minnesota settlement."" Id. at 444. "
1145,14," In Seelig, the Supreme Court struck down a New York statute that (a) established in-state minimum wholesale milk prices, and 
(b) banned the resale in New York of milk purchased out-of-state at wholesale prices below in-state minimums. Seelig, 294 U.S. 
at 519. The Court found that the statute's effect was to set minimum out-of-state wholesale milk prices, stating: It is one thing for a state to exact adherence by an importer to fitting standards of sanitation before the products of the farm 
or factory may be sold in its markets. It is a very different thing to establish a wage scale or a scale of prices for use in other 
states, and to bar the sale of the products, whether in the original packages or in others, unless the scale has been 
observed. Id. at 528."
1145,15," In Brown-Forman, the Supreme Court struck down a New York statute that required liquor distillers to certify that their in- state 
prices were no higher than the lowest price at which the same product would be sold out-of-state during the month. Brown-
Forman, 476 U.S. at 575-76. The Court noted that, under the statute, ""once a distiller has posted prices in New York, it is not 
free to change its prices elsewhere in the United States during the relevant month. Forcing a merchant to seek regulatory 
approval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another directly regulates interstate commerce."" Id. at 582 (footnote 
omitted)."
1145,16," In Healy, the Supreme Court struck down a Connecticut statute that required out-of-state beer importers to certify that the 
prices at which the products were sold to Connecticut wholesalers were no higher than prices at which those same products 
were sold in bordering states. Healy, 491 U.S. at 326. The Court held the statute to be unconstitutional because it had the effect 
of controlling prices in neighboring states, thereby interfering with those states' regulatory schemes and because it discriminated 
against those brewers and shippers of beer who were engaged in interstate commerce. Id. at 337-40. "
1147,17," Appellees rely upon our decision in Battipaglia v. New York State Liquor Authority, 745 F.2d 166 (2d Cir. 1984), which stated 
that in that case ""plaintiffs have been faced from the outset with the difficulty that the challenged provisions of the [state statute] 
do not compel any agreement,"" id. at 170, to support their argument that a private ""contract, combination, or conspiracy"" must be 
shown for Sherman Act preemption to occur. However, Battipaglia actually noted diverging lines of authority on the question of 
whether a showing of a private agreement is necessary for preemption, and ultimately declined to ""resolve that difficult 
question."" Id. at 173. The majority did not reach the question because it held that the anticompetitive acts at issue in that case -- 
the exchange of price information -- would constitute only a rule-of-reason restraint rather than a per se restraint. Id. at 174-75 
(citing Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 659-62, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1042, 102 S. Ct. 3294 (1982)). In any event, since our 
decision in Battipaglia, HN24[
] the Supreme Court has made it clear that an actual ""contract, combination or conspiracy"" need not be shown for a state statute to be preempted by the Sherman Act. 324 Liquor, 479 U.S. at 345-46 n. 8."
1147,18," Appellees claim that appellants, while challenging the Contraband Statutes, have conceded the validity of the MSA and the 
Escrow Statute under the Sherman Act. See Appellees' Br. at 38. No such concession has been made. Indeed, it is clearly 
alleged that the Contraband Statutes are anticompetitive precisely because they implement the cartel established by the MSA. 
Appellants do not challenge the MSA directly because it is the Contraband Statutes, not the MSA standing alone, that injures 
them."
1147,19," The proposed exemption, part of a bill sponsored by Senator McCain and introduced on November 7, 1997, read as follows: 
""Antitrust Exemptions. - The provisions of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.), and any 
other federal or state antitrust laws shall not apply to an association or organization to which subsection (B) applies."" Universal 
Tobacco Settlement Act, S. 1415, 105th Cong. § 155(D) (1997). Subsection (B) applied to tobacco industry trade organizations 
or other associations that met certain requirements for ""independent"" boards and bylaws. Id. at § 155(B). According to testimony "
1148,," at a Senate hearing, a broader antitrust immunity provision was also considered, which read as follows: ""In order to achieve the 
goals of this agreement and the Act relating to tobacco use by children and adolescents, the tobacco product manufacturers 
may, notwithstanding the provisions of the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, or any other federal or state antitrust law, jointly 
confer, coordinate, or act in concert, for this limited purpose."" Tobacco Settlement: Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on 
Commerce, Sci. and Transp., 105th Cong. (1998) (LEXIS, National Narrowcast Network) (statement of Robert Pitofsky, 
Chairman, Federal Trade Commission). This provision, however, does not appear in any version of the legislation available on 
lexis.com."
1148,20," Appellees suggest in a footnote that the state action immunity turns upon whether the defendants in the action are private 
parties or state officials. See Appellees' Br. at 42-43 n. 13. We disagree. If a state statute is preempted, state officials may be 
prevented from enforcing it. In fact, in 324 Liquor, the members of the New York State Liquor Authority were parties to the action 
and were prevented from enforcing the law challenged there. The only distinction between 324 Liquor and the present case is 
that, in 324 Liquor, the state officials initiated the action. See Brief for Appellants, 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 93 L. 
Ed. 2d 667, 107 S. Ct. 720 (1987) (No. 84-2022). "
1149,21," Appellees have not argued that because the MSA is a settlement of a lawsuit, it somehow achieves an immunity not otherwise 
available. Of course, such an argument would be fruitless. First, such an argument would negate appellees' claim that the 
requisite contract, combination or conspiracy is lacking. See ""Unilateral Act of State,"" subsection (b)(2)(i), supra. Second, HN28[ "
1150,," ] Sherman Act violations are generally not immunized because the anticompetitive scheme is embodied in the settlement of a lawsuit. See United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 83 S. Ct. 1773, 1963 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 547 
(1963) (holding that settlement agreements between the Singer Company and its Italian and Swiss competitors violated the 
Sherman Act); Duplan Corp. v. Deering Milliken, Inc., 594 F.2d 979, 981 (4th Cir. 1979) (per curiam) (affirming district court's 
finding that settlement agreement ""was the core of a scheme to stabilize and maintain production royalties . . . and to 
monopolize the United States market.""). Third, this result is not altered because a state attorney general has negotiated such an 
agreement. If the law were otherwise, a state attorney general would be able to do what Midcal and 324 Liquor deny state 
legislatures by bringing a lawsuit and settling in an anticompetitive agreement. If the model of the MSA was followed, the state 
attorneys general might collectively establish a nationwide cartel. See note 13, supra."
1150,22," Section 1399-nn states: HN31[
] Findings and purpose"
1150,1," . Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the state and to the citizens of the state. The Surgeon 
General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases, and that there are 
hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear 
until many years after the person in question begins smoking."
1150,2," . Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the state. Under certain health-care programs, the state 
may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette 
smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance."
1150,3," . Under these programs, the state pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for these persons for 
health conditions associated with cigarette smoking. "
1151,4," . It is the policy of the state that financial burdens imposed on the state by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product 
manufacturers rather than by the state to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with 
the state or are found culpable by the courts."
1151,5," . On November twenty-third, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered 
into a settlement agreement, entitled the ""Master Settlement Agreement,"" with the state. The master settlement agreement 
obligates these manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future claims against them as described 
therein, to pay substantial sums to the state (tied in part to their volume of sales); to fund a national foundation devoted to 
the interests of public health; and to make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate 
culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking."
1151,6," . It would be contrary to the policy of the state if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a 
settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise 
without ensuring that the state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted 
culpably. It is thus in the interest of the state to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a 
source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming 
judgment-proof before liability may arise. N.Y. Pub. Health Law § 1399-nn (2002)."
1151,23," See Antitrust Implications of the Global Tobacco Settlement: Hearing Before the Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 105th Cong. 
(1997) (LEXIS, National Narrowcast Network) (statement of Robert Pitofsky, Chairman, Federal Trade Commission) (""The 
arguments that I've heard as to why this kind of exemption is necessary are as follows: One, that it's important to ensure that the 
annual payments, that could amount to $ 15 billion a year in five or six years, be passed along in the form of higher prices. But 
one has to ask the question: Why do you need an antitrust exemption to do that? If the excise taxes go up or have gone up in 
the past, there are studies that show they've been passed along to consumers. If the price of paper or tobacco went up in an 
industry like this, wouldn't we expect that the increased costs would be passed along to consumers? An exception of this kind 
would be most unusual, it could be construed to allow a kind of price fixing that I think we would not be comfortable with, and 
therefore I just can't see a justification along that line.""). "
1152,24, We of course do not foreclose the State from offering a rationale for the market-share scheme in subsequent proceedings.
1152,25," The principal health benefit from the arrangement as alleged appears to be that cigarette sales will be reduced by the higher 
prices that result from the cartel arrangement. However, because cigarettes are addictive, the demand for them is relatively 
inelastic, at least in the short run, and the health benefits from this aspect of the MSA have a ceiling. Moreover, given the broad 
police powers of the state to regulate the marketing of dangerous commodities, effective public health measures other than 
affording tobacco manufacturers a cartel are ubiquitous and far more obvious than the complex market-share arrangements of 
the MSA enforced by the Contraband Statutes. For example, if limiting sales of cigarettes by higher prices is chosen as a public "
1153,," health measure, a flat but high tax on each cigarette sold would alone do the trick. Similarly, restrictions on marketing could be 
enacted."
1153,26," Some of the Settling States may come to rely heavily on revenue from the MSA, as perhaps reflected in Governor Pataki's 
statement. See also Rick Hampson, States Squander Chance to Help Fight Smoking, USA Today, Mar. 11, 2003, at B1 (quoting 
Washington state attorney general's statement that ""the money in the tobacco settlement is as addictive to states as the nicotine 
in cigarettes is to smokers""); Gordon Fairclough and Vanessa O'Connell, Co-Dependents: Once Tobacco Foes, States are 
Hooked on Settlement Cash, Wall St. J., Apr. 2, 2003, at A1 (quoting R.J. Reynolds executive's statement that after the 
settlement, ""the states make more money from each pack of cigarettes sold than anyone else""). Some Settling States may 
therefore have second thoughts about measures to reduce further the sale of cigarettes. In that regard, some Settling States 
have issued bonds that are secured by future tobacco revenue under the MSA but would become obligations of the particular 
States should tobacco revenues be insufficient. See Deborah Finestone, Oregon Sells $ 428 Million Backed by Dual Security 
Pledge, Bond Buyer, April 7, 2003, at 5; Christine Albano, The Week Ahead: New York's $ 2.3B Tobacco Sale Seeks to 
Sublimate the Stain, Bond Buyer, June 9, 2003, at 40. Further reductions in the sale of cigarettes might have very severe fiscal 
consequences for such States. There are also increasing signs of alliances between the Settling States and the OPMs. For example, 37 state and territorial 
attorneys general appeared as amici on behalf of a cigarette manufacturer's motion in an Illinois state court to reduce an 
appellate bond that might throw the company into bankruptcy. Brief of Amici Curiae Attorneys General, Price v. Philip Morris, 
Inc., No. 00-L-112 (3d Cir. Ill. Apr. 2003) (unpublished decision); William McQuillen, ""Progress"" in Philip Morris Lawsuit: US $ 12 
Billion in Dispute, National Post (Bloomberg), April 12, 2003, at FP7. Finally, in the wake of that incident and at the request of 
their attorneys general, 16 states have passed legislation capping the size of appeal bonds that can be required of corporations. 
See, e.g., Va. Code Ann. § 8.01-676.1(J) (2003) (effective March 10, 2000) (""If the appellee in a civil action obtains a judgment 
for damages other than compensatory damages, or in excess of the compensatory damages, and the appellant seeks a stay of 
execution of the judgment in order to obtain review in the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court, the appeal bond or irrevocable 
letter of credit for the portion of the damages, other than the compensatory damages, or in excess of the compensatory 
damages, shall not exceed $ 25,000,000."") The bond-capping legislation in four of the Settling States is limited to corporations 
that are MSA PMs. See, e.g., Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 20.035(1) (2003) (effective May 29, 2001) (""If an appeal is taken of a 
judgment in a civil action in which [a PM] is required to give a bond in order to secure a stay of execution of the judgment during 
the pendency of the appeal, the amount of the bond must not exceed $ 50,000,000.""). See also Fairclough and O'Connell, 
supra. "
1154,27," In a replay of their argument rejected in subsection (b)(2)(i) of this section of the opinion, namely that Parker requires a private 
""contract, combination, or conspiracy"" to satisfy the per se violation requirement and that unilateral acts of a state are immune, 
appellees argue that the active supervision requirement should not be applied in this case: Where challenged acts are those of private parties, as were the acts in Bedell, [the Midcal active supervision requirement 
will apply]. In contrast, acts of a State's legislature -- like those that Plaintiffs have challenged here -- are always immune 
under the state action doctrine. Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590, 104 S. Ct. 1989 (1984) . . . . Appellees' Br. at 42 n. 13. This argument is clearly contrary to the decisions in Midcal, 445 U.S. at 105, and 324 Liquor, 479 U.S. 
at 341-45. Appellees' reliance upon Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590, 104 S. Ct. 1989 (1984), is misplaced. That case 
held an allegedly anticompetitive Arizona bar admission program immune from antitrust challenge where, although the program 
was largely administered by a committee of private law practitioners, the practitioners were conceded to be ""state officers"" in 
carrying out their committee functions, and the Arizona Supreme Court nevertheless ""retained strict supervisory powers and 
ultimate full authority"" over the committee's actions. Id. at 572. The Court did state in that case that legislative state action is 
""ipso facto"" immune under federal antitrust law, id. at 568, but that decision was in the context of anticompetitive conduct 
performed entirely by state actors, without any private involvement, and therefore effectively satisfied the Midcal supervision 
requirement. See 1 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra P 227, at 492. "
1155,28," Before the district court, appellants indicated that the term ""retailers"" should be replaced by ""wholesalers and importers"" for 
purposes of their Equal Protection claim. See Freedom Holdings, tr. at 51. We have therefore deemed the appellants' complaint 
to be altered where such alternation is appropriate. "
1156,29," Appellants have not alleged otherwise. In their reply brief appellants conclusorily state that wholesalers ""know"" that cigarettes 
sold to them from reservations ""have not been and will not be seized"" under the Contraband Statutes. See Appellants' Reply Br.

1173,65," Warner's First Amended Complaint pleaded two claims—one for breach of contract, and one for declaratory relief. Both claims 
address whether defendant breached the licensing agreement, in that Warner seeks a declaration that it validly terminated the 
contract because Golden Channels was in material breach of its terms. (See Amended Complaint, ¶ 30.) If defendant is entitled 
to summary judgment on the first claim for relief, therefore, it is necessarily entitled to summary judgment on the second as well."

be a clear acknowledgment that Golden Channels allowed the Letter of Credit to renew as a condition to commencing 
negotiations regarding such an agreement. "
1180,," Warner also cites a December 17, 2001, e-mail authored by Baxter, which stated that having a letter of credit ""in situ throughout 
the term of the deal (inch option if extended)"" was ""absolutely critical"" to Warner. (See Pl.'s Add'l Issues, ¶ 22; Baxter Deck, Ex. 
15 (December 17, 2002 e-mail); Forman Deck, Ex. E (""Baxter Depo."") at 127.) As noted earlier, this e-mail appears to state a 
position regarding the terms of the proposed amended agreement. It does not appear to reflect Warner's demand that the Letter 
of Credit remain in place during the period of negotiations. There is no evidence, moreover, that Golden Channels assented to 
such a term. Warner relies only on the fact that Golden Channels ""never objected."" Because the e-mail was one in a series of 
communications that comprised the parties' negotiations, it cannot be said that Golden Channels' silence in response constituted 
acceptance."

1183,115," These triable issues of fact are exacerbated by the fact that the parties' arguments on this point assume Golden Channels 
would have had to tender $5 million to cure the alleged breach. As Warner's November 15, 2002, notice of default made clear, 
however, the payments then due and owing totaled $2,809,790 (i.e., $1,917,740 in license fees for Year 3, $392,050 in DTH 
carriage revenue for Years 1 and 2, and the $500,000 extension option fee). Although the letter also made reference to "
1184,," $2,811,961.50 in licensing fees for Year 4, it is undisputed that those fees were not due until December 1, 2002. Assuming a 
letter dated November 15, 2002, could effectively give notice of default on an obligation that was not yet due, Warner did not 
give Golden Channels fourteen days from December 1, 2002, the date performance was due, to pay the Year 4 fees. 
Additionally, the DTH carriage fees were not subject to cure on fourteen days' notice, but on thirty days' notice. For this reason, a 
tender of substantially less than $5 million would have sufficed to cure any breach as of December 9, 2002, the date Warner 
terminated the agreement."
1184,116," See Pl.'s Add'l. Facts, ¶¶ 6-7."
1184,117," Agreement, ¶ 13.5. Golden Channels argues that this provision requires only that Warner receive payment by wire transfer, 
not that Golden Channels be the entity making the payment. As evidence of this fact, it contends that Warner attempted to insert 
a direct payment provision in the agreement that Golden Channels rejected. The proposal to which Golden Channels makes 
reference is not clear on its face. (See Supp. Conf. Wytsma Decl., Ex. E at 25.) Absent evidence that those involved in 
negotiating the agreement ascribed the meaning to this proposed term that Golden Channels suggests, the court finds that it is 
ambiguous, and that it does not definitively demonstrate that the agreement provided for payment either directly or by draw 
down of the Letter of Credit."

1186,127, The court does not decide this issue at this time.
1186,128," To the extent Golden Channels argues the provisions are ambiguous (see Def.'s Mot. at 22:1-22), the court finds they are not. 
See Southern California Gas Co. v. City of Santa Ana, 336 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir. 2003) (stating that ""[a]mbiguity is a question 
of law for the court"" and that courts may ""grant summary judgment motions touching upon contract interpretation when the 
agreement is unambiguous""). Paragraph 19.2.2 clearly governs failure to pay the initial fee, license fees and the extension 
option fee, while paragraph 17 of the Additional Terms applies broadly to failure ""to pay . . . any sum when due"" and other 
""breach[es] of th[e] Agreement."" Paragraph 21.7 provides that, ""in the event of any inconsistency,"" the Basic Agreement will 
control. As respects failure to pay license fees and the extension option fee, therefore, paragraph 19.2.2 controlled. As respects 
failure to pay DTH carriage revenue, however, paragraph 17 of the Additional Terms controlled."
1186,129," Golden Channels contends that Warner's pre-termination conduct reveals its awareness that it was not entitled to seek the 
remedies outlined in paragraph 17 of the Additional Terms. Specifically, Golden Channels notes that in its November 15, 2002, 
notice of default, Warner asserted only the right to suspend delivery of programming and terminate the agreement if the default 
was not cured. (Conf. Wytsma Decl., Ex. H.) Similarly, in its November 28, 2002, letter, Warner referenced only the remedies 
spelled out in paragraph 19.2.2. (Wytsma Decl., Ex. C.) Each communication, however, noted that Warner's right to invoke these 
remedies was ""without prejudice to its other rights and remedies."" The notice of default expressly reserved ""any and all rights, 
interests and remedies"" that Warner had ""at law or in equity."" Accordingly, because Golden Channels' default in payment of the 
DTH carriage revenue was not covered by paragraph 19.2.2, Warner was entitled to invoke the broader remedies of paragraph 
17 of the Additional Terms despite its referencing of the more limited provision in pre-termination correspondence."
1186,130," Whether Warner was entitled to invoke the acceleration clause on December 9, 2002, because of Golden Channels' failure to 
pay DTH carriage fees is a different question. Under paragraph 19.1, Warner was required to give Golden Channels' thirty days' 
notice of any breach other than a failure to pay license fees or the option extension fee. (Conf. Wytsma Decl., Ex. A.) Paragraph 
17 of the Additional Terms provides that Warner may give ten days' notice of a breach before accelerating all sums due under 
the agreement, demanding the immediate return of programming, and/or terminating. Because these provisions appear to be in 
direct conflict, the thirty day notice period set forth in paragraph 19.1 seemingly controls. Warner sent its notice of default on 
November 15, 2002. It sent a notice of termination, which stated that Warner was accelerating all sums due under the 
agreement, on December 9, 2002. If the thirty day notice provision controls, Warner did not afford Golden Channels sufficient 
time to cure its failure to pay DTH carriage fees before terminating and accelerating all sums due under the contract. "
1187,131, Def.'s Mot. at 24:13-25:7. 
1188,132," Golden Channels has not challenged the acceleration clause contained in paragraph 17 as a forfeiture. It has only challenged 
Warner's right to recover simultaneously all sums due under the contract and return of its programming. ""California law has. . . 
long recognized that a provision for liquidation of damages for contractual breach ... can under some circumstances be designed 
as, and operate as, a contractual forfeiture. To prevent such operation, [its] laws place limits on liquidated damages clauses."" 
Ridgley v. Topa Thrift & Loan Assn., 17 Cal.4th 970, 976-77, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 378, 953 P.2d 484 (1998). Specifically, under Civil 
Code § 1671(b), ""a provision in a contract liquidating the damages"" for the breach of the contract is valid unless the party 
seeking to invalidate the provision establishes that the provision was unreasonable under the circumstances existing at the time "
1189,," the contract was made."" ""A liquidated damages clause will generally be considered unreasonable, and hence unenforceable 
under [Civil Code] section 1671(b), if it bears no reasonable relationship to the range of actual damages that the parties could 
have anticipated would flow from a breach. The amount set as liquidated damages 'must represent the result of a reasonable 
endeavor by the parties to estimate a fair average compensation for any loss that may be sustained.'"" Id. at 977. ""'The 
characteristic feature of a penalty is its lack of proportional relation to the damages which may actually flow from failure to 
perform under a contract.'"" Id. See also Sybron Corp. v. Clark Hosp. Supply Corp., 76 Cal.App.3d 896, 900, 143 Cal. Rptr. 306 
(1978). Golden Channels has made no showing that the acceleration clause is unreasonable or that it does not bear a 
proportional relationship to the damages that actually flowed from its breach. Accordingly, acceleration remains a remedy that 
Warner may elect."
1189,133," In its trial brief, Warner appears to assert that paragraph 17 is not the basis of its prayer for all fees due the five-year term of 
the license agreement. It appears to argue, rather, that it merely seeks the ""benefit of its bargain."" The First Amended Complaint 
appears to premise entitlement to these fees on paragraph 17 of the License Agreement. (See First Amended Complaint, ¶¶ 18, 
20; see also Pretrial Conference Order at 6 (""As a matter of contract or by operation of law, Warner was entitled to its 
expectancy under the terms of the License Agreement. . ."")). The court does not decide, in this order, whether Warner is entitled 
to fees due during the remainder of the five-year term of the agreement, minus mitigation, under a benefit of the bargain theory. 
It addresses only Golden Channels' argument that paragraph 17 constitutes a forfeiture. See MCA Television, supra, 171 F.3d at 
1276 (""Had this case presented a straightforward election of remedies problem - if, for example, MCA had both sought to 
recover full damages in contract and sued in copyright without using the language of the damages provision to do so - the 
appropriate course would have been to determine which alternative MCA had through its actions indicated an intent to elect. . . . 
Here, however, MCA has sued based on the damages provision of the contract. The appropriate remedy will therefore be that 
applied by the Florida courts where damages provisions are found to be unenforceable penalties"")."
1189,134," Some courts hold that a party that has inconsistent remedies, and that ""has clearly elected to proceed on one . . . is bound by 
this election and cannot thereafter pursue the other."" Roullard v. Rosenberg Bros. & Co., 193 Cal. 360, 363, 224 P. 449 (1924);

120 P.2d 60 (1941). See also 3 B. Witkin, CAL. PROCEDURE, Actions, § 174, pp. 243-44 (4th ed. 1996). Others state that ""'[a] 
party should be entitled to change alternative remedies until satisfaction of judgment, or application of res judicata or estoppel, 
vindicates one of the inconsistent rights.... The election of remedies doctrine states that accepting an actual benefit from an 
alternative theory that renders continued pursuit of the alternative unfair constitutes an election.'"" Smith v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co., 
69 Cal.App.4th 1371, 1375-76, 82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 300 (1999) (quoting Southern Christian Leadership Conference v. Al Malaikah

982, 990, 76 Cal. Rptr. 2d 876 (1998) ("" [a]n estoppel arises when the action is such that permitting the plaintiff to seek an 
alternative remedy will prejudice or work a substantial injury to the defendant""); Perry v. Robertson, 201 Cal.App.3d 333, 341, 
247 Cal. Rptr. 74 (1988) (""[a]n election does not occur by the assertion of an inconsistent allegation, but by the acceptance of an 
actual benefit from an alternative theory which would render unfair continued pursuit of the alternative""). The court notes the 
statement in Golden Channels' opposition to Warner's motion for partial summary judgment that Warner has licensed the 
programming covered by the agreement to third parties. It expresses no opinion as to whether this constitutes an election that 
governs what remedies Warner may seek in this action."

1192,146, Def.'s Opp. at 7:8-9.
1192,147," While Golden Channels contends that the document also shows allocation of $1,849,388 of the Letter of Credit to Year 4 fees 
(see Def.'s Issues, ¶ 24), no portion of this is attributable to DTH carriage revenue for Year 4. (See Conf. Opp. Wytsma Decl., 
Ex. G.) Golden Channels also asserts that its payment of Year 4 DTH revenues was excused by Warner's termination of the 
contract. Year 4 commenced on December 1, 2002. Warner terminated the contract on December 9, 2002. It would appear, 
therefore, that Warner is, at a minimum, entitled to eight days of DTH revenue for Year 4. Moreover, to the extent that Golden 
Channels was to account for and pay DTH revenue for the last quarter of 2002 on January 1, 2003, it would appear to have a 
continuing obligation to do so despite Warner's termination. The only exception to this would be if the termination were wrongful. 
As noted, triable issues of fact remain regarding the validity of the termination. Moreover, the parties do not brief in any detail 
their respective positions with respect to Year 4 revenue. Accordingly, the court declines to decide the issue on the present 
record."

Channels as the proponent of the claim bears the burden of explaining the manner in which the practices are allegedly unfair,

1230,12," My analysis does not require that plaintiffs' § 2(a) claims be analyzed as § 2(d) and (e) claims. Such a recategorization was 
not argued by the parties in this case."
1230,13," In private suits, however, courts have required injury-in-fact and causation. Rutman Wine Co. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 829 F.2d 
729, 734 (9th Cir. 1987) (noting that a plaintiff must allege an ""actual injury attributable to something the antitrust laws were 
designed to prevent"" and that its ""failing to receive a promotional allowance . . . adversely affected its ability to compete with 
favored competitors""); Hovenkamp P 2363. "
1231,14," It is true that in Perkins v. Standard Oil Co. of California, 395 U.S. 642, 23 L. Ed. 2d 599, 89 S. Ct. 1871 (1969), the Supreme 
Court, in dealing with an issue involving section 2(a), relied on Fred Meyer for the general proposition that the word ""customer"" 
in § 2(a) as well as § 2(d) should not be read to allow avoidance of the Act's purposes ""by the simple expedient of adding an 
additional link to the distribution chain."" 395 U.S. at 647-48. However, the issue in Perkins was the extent of damages where the 
supplier discriminated among direct purchasers, and the Supreme Court held that damages could include those suffered as a 
result of the favored purchaser passing on its savings down the line to third and fourth level purchasers. The holding, dealing as "
1232,," it did with the scope of relief, did not extend the Fred Meyer analysis to find a violation of section 2(a) in the first place on the 
basis of price discriminations against truly indirect purchasers who merely can be said to compete with favored direct 
purchasers."
1232,15," It is true that some cases state that ""purchaser"" in section 2(a) should be interpreted the same as ""customer"" in section 2(d). 
American News Co. v. FTC, 300 F.2d 104, 109 (2d Cir. 1962); Brewer v. Uniroyal, Inc., 498 F.2d 973, 977 (6th Cir. 1974) 
(dictum). However, these cases did not hold that a Fred Meyer analysis should be extended to section 2(a) claims. American 
News held in effect that ""customer"" in section 2(d) should be interpreted at least as broadly as ""purchaser"" in section 2(a). For 
the reasons stated in the text, the reverse is not true, and American News did not reach that issue. See the Second Circuit's later 
opinion in FLM Collision Parts, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 543 F.2d 1019, 1026 n. 8 (2d Cir. 1976) (""It is true that in some instances 
the word 'customer' in § 2(d) and the word 'purchaser' in § 2(a), are to be given the same meaning, see, e.g., American News. . 
., but the Supreme Court limited its holding in Fred Meyer, Inc.. . . to § 2(d) cases""). This court's dictum in Brewer also dealt with 
a very distinct issue from the one resolved in Fred Meyer: whether a subsidiary could be considered a purchaser or customer 
under either provision of the Act."
1232,16," The doctrine has been explained by the Seventh Circuit: If a seller can control the terms upon which a buyer once removed may purchase the seller's product from the seller's 
immediate buyer, the buyer once removed is for all practical, economic purposes dealing directly with the seller. If the seller 
controls the sale, he is responsible for the discrimination in the sale price, if there is such discrimination. If the seller cannot 
in some manner control the sale between his immediate buyer and a buyer once removed, then he has no power by his 
own action to prevent an injury to competition. Purolator Products, Inc. v. FTC, 352 F.2d 874, 883 (7th Cir. 1968). "
1233,17," Fred Meyer was an FTC enforcement action, as opposed to a private party case. Philip Morris argues that Fred Meyer thus did 
not address statutory standing to bring a private suit. Regardless, the Court did define ""customer"" and there is no reason why 
this definition could not also apply to a private party action under the Act."
1233,18," In other words, a supplier could not discriminate against the competitor of a favored indirect purchaser in the provision of 
services if the supplier so controlled the terms of the sale by the wholesaler to the favored indirect purchaser, that the favored 
indirect purchaser should be considered a favored direct purchaser. "
1234,19," As the Supreme Court explained in FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 68 S. Ct. 822, 44 F.T.C. 1499 
(1948): The legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act makes it abundantly clear that Congress considered it to be an evil that 
a large buyer could secure a competitive advantage over a small buyer solely because of the large buyer's quantity 
purchasing ability. The Robinson-Patman Act was passed to deprive a large buyer of such advantages except to the extent 
that a lower price could be justified by reason of a seller's diminished costs due to quantity manufacture, delivery or sale, or 
by reason of the seller's good faith effort to meet a competitor's equally low price. Id. at 43. "

1235,21," In addition, vendors and convenience stores must operate at the ""same functional level."" Abbott Labs. v. Portland Retail 
Druggists Ass'n, 425 U.S. 1, 12, 47 L. Ed. 2d 537, 96 S. Ct. 1305 (1976) (quoting FTC v. Sun Oil Co., 371 U.S. 505, 520, 9 L. 
Ed. 2d 466, 83 S. Ct. 358 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Neither party addresses this requirement, but we find that

with the day-to-day administration of the Act"" and its rulings should be given deference. Fred Meyer, 390 U.S. at 355; see also 
15 U.S.C. § 45 (FTC given power to prevent unfair competition)."
1235,23," Cross-elasticity of demand ""measures the sensitivity of purchase of one good to change in the price of another good."" David 
N. Hyman, Microeconomics 144 (4th ed. 1997). Mr. Hyman writes that ""cross-elasticity of demand may be positive or negative. A 
positive cross-elasticity of demand implies that the two goods are substitutes. Whenever the price of one good changes, other 
things being equal, the demand for the other moves in the same direction."" Id. The higher the value of cross-elasticities, the 
greater the substitutability of the products. Id. at 145. If the value is zero then the products are unrelated to one another, such as

1236,24," Those questions and responses were: Question 5: Have you recently purchased cigarettes from a convenience store? Overall affirmative response: 90.7. Question 6: Where was the location of the store in relation to this establishment? Within one block: 23.9; within three 
blocks: 18.7; more than three blocks: 57.4. Question 7: At which store did you make your purchase? Gas station/Mini-Mart: 41.8; 7-11 Convenience Store: 20.6; drug 
store: 3.9; tobacco store: 2.5; grocery store: 11.3; other: 19.9."
1236,25," The district court reached this conclusion and then found that there was no factual basis for vendors' expert testimony, 
apparently referring to Dr. Fanara. The court did not appear to make a similar finding with respect to Dr. Newbern's study and, in 
fact, concluded that the motion to strike Dr. Newbern's testimony was moot."
1236,26," Philip Morris asserts that the district court may not rely on the hearsay statements related by vendors about customers leaving 
establishments to buy cigarettes elsewhere to prove causation. See e.g., Stelwagon Mfg. Co. v. Tarmac Roofing Sys., 63 
F.3d 1267 (district court improperly considered anecdotal testimony that customers did not deal with manufacturers because the 
evidence was admitted under Rule 803(3) but was used to prove the truth of the facts asserted). On remand, the district court 
may decide whether vendors' anecdotal testimony is admissible as a basis to show that vendors compete with convenience 
stores. "
1237,27," In addition to Philip Morris's motion for summary judgment, the district court also had before it Philip Morris's motion to strike 
the expert testimony of Dr. Newbern and Professor Fanara. Philip Morris argues that vendors' expert testimony did not meet the 
requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 702, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 
113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238, 119 S. Ct. 1167 (1999), and their 
progeny. The district court found insufficient evidence to show competition without having to reach the question whether 
Professor Fanara and Dr. Newbern's testimony should have been stricken. On appeal, Philip Morris argues that this court may 
address this issue because it is an alternative ground for summary judgment. Rule 702 provides that HN23[
] an expert may testify to his/her opinion if (1) it is based upon ""sufficient facts or data,"" (2) it is 
""the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of 
the case."" Fed. R. Evid. 702. HN24[
] A trial judge must determine whether the expert testimony is relevant and reliable. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589. Given the gatekeeping function of the district court to determine the reliability and relevance of expert 
testimony, Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 142-43, the district court should decide on remand whether to grant this motion. "
1238,1," In addition, plaintiff-vendors complain of additional promotional fees, racks, fixtures, and signage made available by Philip 
Morris to their store competitors. Plaintiffs' Brief at 31. To the extent these programs reflect a Robinson-Patman violation, they 
are violative of § 2(d) and (e) as the provision of or payment for promotional and advertising programs. "
1239,2," While the product promotions offered by Philip Morris and the provision of free goods by Philip Morris may be violations of § 
2(e) rather than § 2(d), the statutory sections have long been considered as a cohesive whole, and the meaning of ""purchaser"" 
in § 2(e) as coterminous with that of ""customer"" in § 2(d). Kirby v. P.R. Mallory & Co., 489 F.2d 904, 909 (7th Cir. 1973), cert. 
denied, 417 U.S. 911, 41 L. Ed. 2d 215, 94 S. Ct. 2610 (1974); see Hovenkamp, supra, P 2363b, at 241. "
1241,3," Julius Nasso inexplicably fails to distinguish FLM Collision Parts; it is worth noting, however, that FLM dealt with price 
differentiation intra-purchaser -- each customer of Ford was charged a different price based on the identity of the ultimate 
purchaser, and FLM attempted to use Fred Meyer to argue that Ford was required to equalize the price ultimately charged to 
competing wholesalers. FLM Collision Parts, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 543 F.2d 1019, 1026-27 (2d Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 
U.S. 1097, 51 L. Ed. 2d 545, 97 S. Ct. 1116 (1977). Ford sold its parts to its franchised dealers, charging them less when they 
resold the part to an independent auto repair shop than when they sold the part to an independent wholesaler such as FLM, 
effectively pricing FLM out of the wholesaling business. Id. at 1023-24. The key point for the FLM court was that Ford did not 
discriminate between different purchasers, but instead between its purchasers in one guise -- that of retailer -- and another -- 
that of wholesaler. Ultimately, FLM's rejection of Fred Meyer's applicability to § 2(a) seems very much confined to the facts of 
that case. Id. at 1026."
1241,4," See, e.g., Barnosky Oils, Inc. v. Union Oil Co. of Cal., 665 F.2d 74 (6th Cir. 1981). In that case, Union was actually selling to 
Barnosky at a lower price than to Union's retail outlets; Barnosky's claim on behalf of its retail customers was that the price 
wasn't ""lower enough"" to allow its customers to compete. Courts have consistently rejected attempts to use Robinson-Patman to 
preserve a particular level in a distribution system into perpetuity, see Conoco Inc. v. Inman Oil Co., 774 F.2d 895, 904 (8th Cir. 
1985); see also Barnosky, 665 F.2d at 83-84; FLM Collision Parts, 543 F.2d at 1025-26. "

related services unless they first provide the following information prior to scheduling, and/or accepting any payment for, 
abortions or abortion-related services to be rendered in California: [¶] A large body of published medical research implicates 
induced abortion as a cause of breast cancer in two ways. [¶] First, abortion does not offer the protection against breast cancer 
provided by a first full-term pregnancy before age 30. Therefore, having an abortion results in a higher risk of getting breast "

Second, having an abortion increases a wom[a]n's risk of breast cancer even more than the risk is increased by delaying a first 
full-term pregnancy. Evidence of this additional increased breast cancer risk has been observed in most epidemiological studies 
in American women. There is also evidence of an even larger increase in breast cancer risk among women who have an 
induced abortion while a teenager, and among women who have both a family history of breast cancer and an induced abortion.” Bernardo also requested an injunction “requiring [Planned Parenthood] to provide all of their patients who received an induced 
abortion in California with a notice of the increased risk of breast cancer described herein so that these patients are aware of 
their increased risk and can seek appropriate medical monitoring and treatment. The notice should read as follows: [¶] Our

than the risk is increased by delaying a first full-term pregnancy. Evidence of this additional increased breast cancer risk has 
been observed in most epidemiological studies in American women. As of June 2001, 17 independent studies in the worldwide 
literature have substantiated the theory that induced abortion increases breast cancer risk by reporting positive associations with 
statistical significance, a technical term meaning at least 95 [percent] certainty that the association between induced abortion 
and increased risk of breast cancer is not due to chance. There is also evidence of an even larger increase in breast cancer risk 
among women who have an induced abortion while a teenager, and among women who have both a family history of breast 
cancer and an induced abortion. [¶] If you have had an abortion you should be aware of this increased risk of breast cancer and

1299,12," Bernardo's own evidence confirmed Planned Parenthood's position that the claimed ABC link is the controversial subject of a 
genuine scientific debate. In opposition to Planned Parenthood's motion to strike, Bernardo submitted the declaration of Jose 
Bufill, M.D., who stated in part: “Two schools define the scientific debate regarding the association of induced abortion with 
subsequent development of breast cancer. One group argues that the weight of scientific data indicates that induced abortion 
places women at risk for breast cancer … . They offer evidence from a wide range of scientific perspectives … to offer a 
coherent, unified argument in support of a causal association. The other group … argues that no such association exists. The 
arguments they offer in support of their opinion center on a critique of the statistical methods used in the epidemiologic studies 
specifically addressing the association. …” (Italics added.)"
1299,13," PPFA stated that “[t]he link between induced abortion and breast cancer is a theory whose principal promoters oppose 
abortion regardless of its safety. The theory has not been borne out by research.” It explained the ABC link “theory”: “The theory 
linking pregnancy termination and breast cancer is based on the hormonal disruption that occurs when a woman's pregnancy is 
interrupted. Pregnancy initiates a surge of sex hormones (estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin), which leads to differentiation 
of the cells in the breast glands in preparation for lactation. … Adherents of this theory claim that interruption of the first trimester 
of a first pregnancy causes a cessation of cell differentiation that may result in a subsequent increase in the risk of cancerous 
growth in these tissues.” "

1319,1, Also before the court is defendants' motion to deem uncontroverted facts admitted.
1319,2," Defendants then moved to dismiss Family Health Care as a plaintiff in this action due to plaintiff's failure to comply with 
HN1[
] Mo.Rev.Stat. § 351.574, which requires foreign corporations to obtain a certificate of authority before pursuing any action in any court in the state of Missouri. Defendants also sought an order dismissing counts VIII and IX of the Third Amended 
Petition, alleging violations of the Missouri Unfair Trade Practices Act, and the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, 
respectively. Defendants then moved to dismiss defendants Dr. Joan Akers and Dr. Mollie O'Connor from the action. By an order dated February 2, 2001, Family Health Care was dismissed as a party to the action, and plaintiff's motion to amend 
in order to substitute Southwest Boulevard Family Health Care Services of Greater Kansas City, Inc. was denied. Inasmuch as 
Count VIII was inapplicable to plaintiff's situation, it was dismissed; Count IX was voluntarily abandoned by plaintiff. Finally, 
defendants, Drs. Akers and O'Connor, were dismissed due to plaintiffs failure to serve them within 120 days of removal of the 
action to this court."
1319,3," Plaintiff states that this was not a threat, but merely a way to allay defendant hospital's fears regarding potential liability. 
Defendants could reasonably view the remark as somewhat hostile or confrontational. "
1321,4," The National Practitioner Data Bank is an organization created under the HCQIA to collect information on physicians, including 
reports of adverse peer review actions. Brown v. Presbyterian Healthcare Services, 101 F.3d 1324, 1328, n. 3 (10th Cir. 1996); 
citing, 45 C.F.R. Part 60 (1995). ""Each health care entity must report to the Board of Medical Examiners….any professional 
review action that adversely affects the clinical privileges of a physician.""  Id; see also, 45 C.F.R. § 60.9(a). The Board of Medical 
Examiners must in turn report this information to the National Practitioner Data Bank. Id. "
1324,5," Perhaps the key to this ruling is the wide divergence in usage employed by the courts in dealing with tests of ""reasonableness"". 
In some contexts, but not in connection with this legislation so far as I can determine, the courts use rather close scrutiny of 
conduct in evaluating what should be classified as reasonable. That is what plaintiff advocates. In other contexts, which I believe 
the cases do employ (or approach) here, anything short of plainly arbitrary conduct may be called reasonable. The far reaches of 
the term may be exemplified by the handling of substantial assistance evaluation to support motions for downward departures in 
sentencing. HN5[
] While plea agreements generally assign sole discretion to prosecutors in evaluating such assistance, the 
courts require that discretion be exercized in a non-arbitrary manner, and this may be said to impose a very loose ""rule of 
reason"" on prosecutors. They must have a rational basis for their decision and must act reasonably. United States v. Weaver, 
216 F.3d 693 695 (8th Cir. 2000); United States v. Due, 205 F.3d 1030, 1034 (8th Cir. 2000). As a matter of practice, however, 
almost any decision made by the prosecutor is invulnerable. I do not suggest that there is no relief under the legislation here, 
except where conduct can be condemned as completely arbitrary. But the generous application of the concept of 
reasonableness under this legislation may be compared with typical judicial review of administrative decisions and of such things 
as internal procedures for terminating membership in voluntary associations. These comments are, in my opinion, sufficiently 
understood judicially so that they need not be supported by wide-ranging citations."
1324,6," Plaintiff found it incredible that she would be required to undergo psychological counseling when it had not previously been set 
forth as a problem. She suggested that this condition, mandated without a sound basis, was similar to the criticism alleged 
against her, that is, making empiric diagnoses prior to fully determining a diagnosis. Nevertheless, the fact that some of defendants' specific concerns shifted or changed over time does not rebut the presumption 
that plaintiff's clinical privileges were revoked ""in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health 
care."" Sugarbaker, at 913; quoting, 42 U.S.C. § 11112(a)(1). "
1325,7," HN7[
] There is no provision in HCQIA barring competitors from participating in ""professional review activities."" Sugarbaker, at 914; quoting, Mathews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 87 F.3d 624, 635 (3rd Cir. 1996); see also, Wayne v. Genesis Medical 
Center, 140 F.3d 1145, 1149 (8th Cir. 1998).."
1325,8," It may be assumed arguendo, that plaintiff should have been exonerated. This assumption is somewhat supported by plaintiff's 
more elaborate substantive showing in litigation. Defendants are entitled to prevail, however, based on the purpose of the 
legislation and the procedural soundness of the essence of their defense. "
1326,9," Plaintiff complains that she was not invited to the PRMC meeting held on June 2, 1994, and that, contrary to defendants' 
assertions, she did not meet with the Ad Hoc Committee on two occasions, but only once. However, this does not serve to 
dispute the fact that plaintiff had adequate notice. Even if some aspects of the controversy could have been better handled, it is 
doubtful that Congress intended to require more than the elaborate and time-consuming proceedings in this case. "
1327,10," Plaintiff's reliance on the favorable outcome for the plaintiff in Brown v. Presbyterian Healthcare Services, 101 F.3d 1324 (10th 
Cir. 1996), is misplaced. For there, testimony was presented that the peer review panel's review of only two charts prior to 
revoking the plaintiff's privileges was unreasonably narrow and did not provide a reasonable basis for concluding that there had 
been a contract violation and the plaintiff posed a threat to patient safety. Brown, at 1334. Here, the peer review process 
included the review of numerous charts of patients attended to by plaintiff, as well as reviews from outside consultants. Some of 
the language in Brown is, moreover, more inclined toward relitigating peer review decisions than is used in the case-law 
generally."
1327,11," In support of her contention, plaintiff provides an affidavit from Dr. David L. Butcher who states that he curtailed his private 
practice in deference to the pressure from Trinity Hospital to use the clinic. (Plaintiff's Exh. 101). "

is currently considering the application of University of Pittsburgh wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald, like Clarett, is

college. According to press reports, the Commissioner is expected to declare Fitzgerald eligible but is apparently delaying until

- it seems plainly incorrect under the current version of the Rule, which requires three full college football seasons to have 
elapsed since a player's high school graduation. A college football season runs from roughly late August (OSU played its first 
game this past year on August 30) to early January, if bowl games are included (OSU played its final game on January 2), or 
late November if they are not (OSU played its final regular season game on November 22). Clarett graduated high school in

case, it is undisputed that the Rule prohibits underclassmen from entering the market. The fact that the court in Intellective was 
required to accept the complaint's allegations is a distinction without a difference. The court was not required, as the NFL 
suggests, to accept as true plaintiff's legal conclusion that it had an antitrust injury. The NFL also perseverates over the fact that the exclusion in Intellective was ""permanent,"" 190 F. Supp. 2d at 616, whereas the

1411,4," We note also that HN14[
] unlike Rooker-Feldman, none of these doctrines goes to ""jurisdiction"" as the district court phrased it. Rather, preclusion doctrines provide affirmative defenses once a court exercises jurisdiction over a civil action, and they are 
subject to waiver where not timely raised. See, e.g., Horwitz v. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs of State of Colo., 822 F.2d 1508, 1512 
(10th Cir. 1987). "
1417,5," The Senate Report of the bill that enacted § 1926 stated: This section would broaden the utility of this authority [of the Department of Agriculture to aid rural entities] somewhat by 
authorizing loans to associations serving farmers, ranchers, farm tenants, and other rural residents. This provision 
authorizes the very effective program of financing the installation and development of domestic water supplies and 
pipelines serving farmers and others in rural communities. By including service to other rural residents, the cost per user is 
decreased and the loans are more secure in addition to the community benefits of a safe and adequate supply of running 
household water. A new provision has been added to assist in protecting the territory served by such an association against 
competitive facilities, which might otherwise be developed with the expansion of the boundaries of municipal and other 
public bodies into an area served by the rural system. S. Rep. No. 566, 87th Cong., 1st Sess., reprinted in 1961 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2243, 2309 (emphasis supplied). "
1418,6," Thus, the § 1926 protections, to the extent Pitt-7 qualified for such protections, were established as of June 15, 1994, and not 
altered by the deannexation. HN42[
] Federal, not state law, controls the geographic scope of the § 1926 protections, which attach as of the entry into the loan agreement and remain as long as the conditions for § 1926 protection discussed above - 
FMHA indebtednesss and service ""made available"" - are met. We therefore need not address the parties' dispute concerning 
whether under Oklahoma law, water districts may only sell water within the district's borders. "
1419,7," McAlester does not advance this argument regarding Group 3 customers, presumably because, since the § 1926 protections

1427,2," This latter claim was based on the ""essential facilities"" doctrine. HN1[
] The essential facilities doctrine applies to a 
competitor's refusal to deal when the competitor has monopolistic control over an essential facility in one market and uses that 
monopoly power to leverage returns from different markets by refusing to share access to the essential facility. See, e.g., City of 
Anaheim v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 955 F.2d 1373, 1380 (9th Cir. 1992); MCI Communications Corp. v. AT&T, 708 F.2d 1081, 1132-

1428,3," The changes in the December 8, 2000 act were set, by the terms of the statute, to expire on March 1, 2001. On February 28, 
2001, the Idaho Legislature made the changes permanent by repealing the December 8, 2000 law and instituting the same 
language without the expiration provision in the prior act's stead. See 2001 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 29 § 1. "
1429,4," The seven questions of the special verdict form were as follows: (1) Were PacifiCorp's power lines that served SRVEA's potential customers essential to effective competition in the market 
for electrical power in that area of southeastern Idaho? [The jury marked ""Yes.""] (2) Was it impractical or uneconomical for SRVEA to construct their own facilities to serve their potential customers? [The 
jury marked ""Yes.""] (3) Did PacifiCorp deny a request by SRVEA that it be provided access to PacifiCorp's power lines? [The jury marked ""No,"" 
and, as expressly instructed by the verdict form, skipped the remaining questions.] (4) Were PacifiCorp's actions intended to, or did they have the effect of, creating or maintaining monopoly power in the 
market for electricity in southeastern Idaho? (5) Did PacifiCorp actually rely on ESSA's anti-piracy provisions in refusing to deliver Enron's electricity to SRVEA's 
members? (6) Did PacifiCorp reasonably and in good faith believe its actions were necessary and required to achieve a concrete and 
specific public policy expressed by the Idaho legislature in enacting ESSA? (7) What, if any, are SRVEA's damages from the period May 1, 1997 to December 8, 2000?"
1429,5," Although SRVEA had objected to the use of a special verdict form, it did not object to the specific language in question three. 
On this appeal, no issue is raised about the form or use of the special verdict form. "
1431,6," This case does not require us to determine whether, under Idaho law, the PUC could exercise its power sua sponte, or must 
await a petition from the utility refusing to wheel. There was no sua sponte exercise of power here."
1431,7," The PUC has not ruled on the underlying petition, apparently because the parties have not pressed the matter. The PUC has 
rejected PacifiCorp's motion for summary judgment and SRVEA's motion to dismiss, indicating that further proceedings are 
necessary. These proceedings to date show sufficient exercise of state power. "
1432,8," Because the statute does not permit the transfer of customers by mere private action (i.e., PacifiCorp could not yield 
customers, without state approval from the PUC, even if it wanted to do so), another way to view this might be to say that the 
statute in question precludes the element of causal antitrust injury, see Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 
477, 489, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701, 97 S. Ct. 690 (1977), rather than analyze the statute under state action immunity doctrine. That is, 
even if PacifiCorp acted anti-competitively by refusing to wheel, there is no injury to SRVEA because it could not have taken any 
of PacifiCorp's customers absent affirmative action by the PUC, because of the general prohibition of customer piracy in Idaho 
Code § 61-332B (2004)."
1432,9," SRVEA argues that if we find state action immunity under the amended ESSA, then the state has violated the Contracts Clause 
of the United States Constitution. U.S. Const. Art. I, § 10, cl. 1. HN8[
] To prevail on this argument, SRVEA must show that the 
amended ESSA substantially impairs SRVEA's contractual relationship and that significant and legitimate public purposes do not 
justify the impairment. See Campanelli v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., 322 F.3d 1086, 1098 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Energy Reserves 
Group, Inc. v. Kan. Power & Light Co., 459 U.S. 400, 411-12, 74 L. Ed. 2d 569, 103 S. Ct. 697 (1983)). We need not address the 
question of substantial impairment, for we have no doubt that the amended ESSA reflects significant and legitimate public 
purposes: the prohibiting of unrestrained competition for retail electric customers and the avoiding of wasteful duplication of 
electrical suppliers, Idaho Code § 61-332(2) (2004), both satisfy the ""significant and legitimate public purposes"" requirement. 
Because the state is not a party to the contract, we defer to the legislature's judgment that the ESSA is necessary legislation to 
meet the stated purposes. Campanelli, 322 F.3d at 1098 (quoting United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 22-23, 52 
L. Ed. 2d 92, 97 S. Ct. 1505 (1977)). Our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that for more than thirty years electricity supply has 
been highly regulated in Idaho, with the goals of eliminating unrestrained competition and reducing duplication. See Veix v. Sixth 
Ward Bldg. & Loan Ass'n, 310 U.S. 32, 38, 84 L. Ed. 1061, 60 S. Ct. 792 (1940) (noting that substantial impairment analysis is 
influenced when the contract in question is made in an industry that is, at the time of contract, highly regulated by the state). "
1433,10," The vigorous competition in the wholesale electricity market was prompted by the requirement of open, non-discriminatory 
wheeling of wholesale power. See Energy Policy Act of 1992, Pub. L. No. 102-486, codified at 16 U.S.C. §§ 824j-824k (2004);

1433,11," HN10[
] We review the district court's rulings on evidentiary issues for abuse of discretion, e.g., McEuin v. Crown Equip. Corp., 328 F.3d 1028, 1032 (9th Cir. 2003), and we must conclude that the error was prejudicial before we may reverse. Id. The 
formulation of jury instructions is reviewed for abuse of discretion, e.g., Ostad v. Or. Health Scis. Univ., 327 F.3d 876, 883 (9th 
Cir. 2003), unless the appellant claims that the trial court misstated the elements that must be proved at trial. In that case, we 
review the instructions de novo. Id. "
1434,12," A remaining issue concerns attorneys' fees awarded by the district court to PacifiCorp. This award arises because SRVEA, on 
the eve of trial, introduced a new damage theory that increased PacifiCorp's potential liability by about $ 210 million. PacifiCorp 
objected that the new theory should be excluded because of the imminent trial, at first prevailing on this theory before the district 
court. SRVEA, for unrelated reasons, moved to continue the trial. The district court continued the trial and, then recognizing that 
continuance dispelled the reason for rejecting the new damage theory, ruled that SRVEA would be permitted to introduce its new 
damage theory, but on the condition that SRVEA pay the attorneys' fees that PacifiCorp incurred arguing the timeliness of the 
new theory before the motion for continuance. SRVEA accepted this condition, argued the new damages theory at trial, and lost. 
The district court then awarded $ 22,625.50 in fees and costs. SRVEA appealed that award, challenging only the amount of the 
fees, not the propriety of awarding fees.HN12[
] "
1435,," We review for an abuse of discretion the district court's decision awarding fees based on the timeliness issue per the agreed 
condition, based on the district court's inherent power to award attorneys' fees. See, e.g., Lissner v. United States Customs 
Serv., 241 F.3d 1220, 1224 (9th Cir. 2001). We have reviewed SRVEA's arguments and PacifiCorp's response, and we 
conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by granting the limited amount of fees awarded to PacifiCorp. The 
lateness of the plaintiff's new damages theory and the substantial potential liability for defendant it entailed justified the condition 
and the amount of the fee. Under the circumstances, we affirm the district court's grant of the limited attorneys' fees in the 
specified amount. "

1460,4," Taking plaintiffs' argument to its logical conclusion, a forum-based entity could ensure that the Court had jurisdiction over any 
non-forum contracting party merely by requesting that the non-forum party provide any information necessary to execute the 
contract in intervals. See Health Communications, Inc. v. Mariner Corp., 273 U.S. App. D.C. 375, 860 F.2d 460, 463 (D.C. Cir. 
1988)."
1460,5," Plaintiffs' discussion of personal jurisdiction predicated on a defendant's contact with a forum via an interactive web site is a red 
herring. Those cases cited by plaintiffs address the question of whether a defendant, by maintaining its own interactive web site 
that is accessible to or directed towards a specific jurisdiction, makes itself vulnerable to suit within that forum. See Gorman v. 
Ameritrade Holding Corp., 352 U.S. App. D.C. 229, 293 F.3d 506, 513 (D.C. Cir. 2002); Blumenthal v. Drudge, 992 F. Supp. 44, 
53 (D.D.C. 1998). Here, plaintiffs cite to the defendants' use of a co-defendant's web site for the purpose of sending information 
into the District in connection with the execution of the Match. As the Court concludes, however, such communications to the 
NRMP, whether in electronic or in written form, are insufficient to demonstrate that the institutional defendants purposefully 
availed themselves of the privileges and the responsibilities of conducting business in the District of Columbia. "
1463,6," With further respect to the fact that Dr. Miller serves both as President of the NRMP and Executive Vice President of the 
ABMS, plaintiffs have not disputed Dr. Miller's declaration that any actions he took in the District of Columbia were in his capacity 
as President of the NRMP and not in his capacity as Executive Vice President of the ABMS. The presence of Dr. Miller as an 
officer of both organizations, without additional allegations that the steps Dr. Miller took nominally as NRMP President were in 
fact taken on behalf of the ABMS, is insufficient to demonstrate jurisdiction over the ABMS. See United States v. Bestfoods, 524 
U.S. 51, 69-70, 141 L. Ed. 2d 43, 118 S. Ct. 1876 (1998); Doe v. Unocal Corp., 248 F.3d 915, 925-26 (9th Cir. 2001) (applying 
United States v. Bestfoods in specific jurisdiction context); In re Vitamins Antitrust Litigation, 270 F. Supp. 2d at 26."
1463,7," Then Circuit Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg described these three contacts as the ""plus factors,"" factors that demonstrate some 
""reasonable connection"" between the jurisdiction in which the court sits ""separate from and in addition to"" the injury caused in 
the jurisdiction. Crane v. Carr, 814 F.2d at 762. The ""plus factor"" or factors ""need not be related to the act that caused the injury; 
all that is required is 'some other reasonable connection' between the defendant and the forum."" Id. at 762-63. The ""plus factor"" 
does not itself provide the basis for jurisdiction --the injury does --but ""it does serve to filter out cases in which the in-forum 
impact is an isolated event and the defendant otherwise has no, or scant, affiliation with the forum."" Id. at 763. See also 
Blumenthal v. Drudge, 992 F. Supp. at 54 (under Section 13-423(a)(4), the injury --not the enumerated contacts --""provides the 
basis for jurisdiction""). "
1464,8," While some putative class members likely pursued employment in the District, defendants are correct that HN16[

1467,12," Plaintiffs also claim conspiracy jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 13-423(a)(3)and (4), but their failure to allege an in-forum 
injury defeats any conspiracy jurisdiction claim based on these subsections. See Section II(B)(2), supra. "
1468,13," To the extent that plaintiffs assert that personal jurisdiction exists over the individual moving defendants under a conspiracy 
jurisdiction theory under Section 12 of the Clayton Act, this Court explicitly rejected the ""conspiracy"" theory in the Clayton Act 
context in Mylan Lab., Inc. v. Akzo, N.V., 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3521, at *6 (jurisdiction ""must be properly established as to each 
defendant, and cannot be based upon allegations that the defendant's co-conspirators were found there, or transacted business 
there, or that all the conspirators are agents for each other""). See also Caribe Trailers Systems, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Maritime 
Shipping Authority, 475 F. Supp. at 717. "
1469,14," Thirteen institutional defendants did not move to dismiss this action for lack of personal jurisdiction: Medstar-Georgetown 
Hospital Medical Center, Inc., George Washington University, MedStar Health, Inc., Beth Israel Medical Center, Duke University 
Health System, Inc., Henry Ford Health System, The Massachusetts General Hospital, The McGraw Medical Center of 
Northwestern University, The Mount Sinai School of Medicine of the City University of New York, The New York and 
Presbyterian Hospital, Strong Memorial Hospital of the University of Rochester, William Beaumont Hospital and Yeshiva 
University."
1469,15," Dr. Beran avers that the remaining named plaintiffs also entered into Student Match Contracts with identical arbitration and 
choice of law provisions, and this assertion is not disputed. See Beran Compel Aff. P10. "
1470,16," The AMA conditionally moves to compel arbitration and adopts the arguments put forth by the NRMP. See Motion of 
Defendant American Medical Association to Dismiss the Complaints Against It for Failure to State a Claim and Conditional 
Motion to Compel Arbitration at 4-5. Both the ABMS and the CMSS also conditionally move to compel arbitration. See Motion of 
American Board of Medical Specialties to Dismiss the Complaint (""ABMS Mot."") at 1; Motion of Council of Medical Specialty 
Societies to Dismiss the Complaint (""CMSS Mot."") at 1. Because the Court has concluded that it lacks personal jurisdiction over 
these organizational defendants, see Sections II(B)(1)(b), (2), supra, however, the Court will decline to consider the motions to 
compel of the ABMS or the CMSS. "
1471,17," For these purposes, any distinction between allegations concerning the Match Program and the Student Match Contract is 
artificial. See Compl. P15 (""The NRMP exists for the sole purpose of illegally restraining trade by eliminating competition in the "
1472,," recruitment and employment of resident physicians by assigning prospective resident physician employees to medical residency 
positions.""). "
1473,18," Although the opinion of the D.C. Circuit in Cole v. Burns Int'l Sec. Servs., 105 F.3d 1465, 1486, 323 U.S. App. D.C. 133, may 
be read to announce a per se rule prohibiting arbitration where a plaintiff is forced to pay arbitration costs in excess of the costs 
of litigation pursuant to the arbitration agreement, this decision does not relieve a plaintiff from the burden of demonstrating his 
or her inability to pay under Green Tree. See LaPrade v. Kidder, Peabody & Co., Inc., 345 U.S. App. D.C. 358, 246 F.3d 702, 
708 (D.C. Cir. 2001). "
1474,19," It is undisputed that Illinois law applies to plaintiffs' contract-based claims pursuant to the choice of law provision in the Student 
Match Contract. See Beran Compel. Aff., Ex. A-1, 1998 Student Agreement of Plaintiff Denise Greene (""This agreement shall be 
governed by laws of the State of Illinois, but the Illinois conflicts of law provision shall be not be construed to apply the law of any 
other jurisdiction."")."
1474,20," To the extent that plaintiffs substantially rest their unconscionability argument on the claim that the fee-splitting provision 
makes the arbitration agreement ""oppressive"" and ""totally one-sided,"" Pls.' Arbit. Opp. at 26, the argument is rejected for the 
reasons stated in Section III(C)(2), supra, in view of the NRMP's offer to pay the individual plaintiffs' shares of the costs of 
arbitration. "
1476,21," Although the NRMP drafted the Match Contract, the Court concludes that the policy directing a court to hold ambiguity against 
the drafter does not outweigh the policies that heavily favor arbitration. See Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees, 
489 U.S. 468, 479, 103 L. Ed. 2d 488, 109 S. Ct. 1248 (1989). "
1477,22," To the extent that other members of this Court have interpreted Ekstrom post-Mastrobuono to extend a general choice of law 
provision to matters concerning the scope of the arbitrator's authority, the undersigned respectfully disagrees. See International 
Techs. Integration, Inc. v. PLO, 66 F. Supp. 2d 3, 9 n.5 (D.D.C. 1999)."
1477,23," Having determined that Mastrobuono precludes application of Illinois law relating to the scope of an arbitrator's authority, the 
Court does not reach the question of whether the parties accurately represented the status of Illinois law. "
1481,24," The cases relied upon by defendants in support of their argument for application of Matsushita in the dismissal context do not 
convince the Court otherwise. In those decisions, the courts extended the plausibility analysis articulated in Matsushita to one of 
impossibility, effectively concluding that those plaintiffs' complaints failed to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). See DM 
Research, Inc. v. College of American Pathologists, 170 F.3d at 56 (""HN48[
] An implausible conclusory assertion may turn out 
to be true … but the discovery process is not available where, at the complaint stage, a plaintiff has nothing more than unlikely 
speculations.""); TV Communications Network, Inc. v. Turner Network Television, Inc., 964 F.2d at 1026-27 (""Because 
[defendants] would have no rational motive to create such an environment, [plaintiff's] allegations do not provide an inference of 
specific intent to conspire to achieve the stated goal of the conspiracy [to monopolize pursuant to Section 2 of the Sherman 
Act]""); United Magazine Co. v. Murdoch Magazines Distribution, Inc., 146 F. Supp. 2d 385, 402 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (""Since, under 
any theory, plaintiffs [sic] alleged conspiracy to engage in predatory pricing is entirely unnecessary and makes no economic 
sense, plaintiffs fail to state a claim under section 1.""). See also Dial A Car v. Transportation, Inc., 82 F.3d 484, 487, 317 U.S. 
App. D.C. 240 (While motions to dismiss should be granted sparingly, dismissal is appropriate where appellant ""not only fails to 
allege any facts supporting its claim …,it also offers nothing to indicate that monopolization of the relevant market is even 
possible, let alone probable""). "
1483,25," Only one institutional defendant, Yeshiva University, separately moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Its 
arguments are addressed in Section IV(C), infra. Four other institutional defendants joined the motions to dismiss filed by the 
AAMC, the AMA and the ACGME. None of the joining institutional defendants, however, are similarly situated to the 
organizations such that dismissal of the organizational defendants would provide a basis for dismissal of the institutions, as is 
evident in the following pages."
1483,26," Defendants AMA, AAMC, ABMS and CMSS moved to join AHA's motion to dismiss to the extent that plaintiffs' allegations 
pertain to them in their capacity as governing sponsors of the NRMP and the ACGME. See Memorandum of Defendant 
American Medical Association in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss the Complaint Against It for Failure to State a Claim Based on 
Maintenance of the FREIDA Database (""AMA (b)(6) Mem"") at 5; Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant American 
Association of Medical Colleges' Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim (""AAMC (b)(6) Mem."") at 21; ABMS Mot. at 2; 
CMSS Mot. at 2. "
1484,27," Plaintiffs' reference to the Court's decision in In re Vitamins Antitrust Litigation, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7397, is misplaced. In 
that case, Chief Judge Hogan concluded that a plaintiff need not allege overt acts committed by each defendant in furtherance of 
a conspiracy. See id. at *53. He did not hold that plaintiffs need not plead that an individual defendant was a participant in the 
conspiracy in the first instance. "
1485,28," The Court rejects plaintiffs' governing sponsor assertions with respect to the CMSS and the ABMS as insufficient for the 
reasons stated in Section IV(B)(1), supra. "
1486,29," The Court rejects plaintiffs' ""governing sponsor"" allegations as insufficient for the reasons stated in Section IV(B)(1), supra, 
with respect to the AHA. The Court also rejects the allegation that the AAMC ""manages and operates"" the NRMP as insufficient 
because plaintiffs offer no support for this conclusory allegation."
1486,30," Four institutional defendants have joined the AAMC's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See Defendant Beth Israel Medical 
Center's Notice of Joinder in Motions to Dismiss (""Beth Israel Joinder"") at 1; Notice by Defendants Duke University Health 
System, Inc., and Mount Sinai School of Medicine of the City University of New York of Their Joinder in Motions to Dismiss 
(""Duke/Sinai Joinder"") at 1; Defendant the New York and Presbyterian Hospital's Notice of Joinder in Motions to Dismiss 
(""NY/Presb. Joinder"") at 1-2. "
1488,31," Four institutional defendants have joined the AMA's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See Beth Israel Joinder at 1; Duke/Sinai 
Joinder at 1; NY/Presb. Joinder at 1-2."
1488,32," The AMA further argues that if the Court infers that the AMA was a member of the conspiracy through its maintenance of the 
FREIDA database, by analogy the publisher of the American Lawyer's annual survey of salaries of first year law firm associates 
could not be dismissed from an antitrust case brought by associates challenging their compensation. See Reply Memorandum in 
Support of Motion of Defendant American Medical Association to Dismiss the Complaint Against It for Failure to State a Claim at 
24. The Court disagrees. Unlike the medical profession, there is no institutional, national employment placement structure in 
place whereby law students interview with law firms, rank their preferences for employment and contractually commit to 
acceptance of a single position prior to receiving an offer into which the American Lawyer's information enters. There also is no 
indication that law firm associates are underpaid."
1488,33," In addition, whether the AMA's operation of the FREIDA database and the dissemination of database information is itself 
lawful is irrelevant. See American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. at 809 (""If [otherwise lawful acts] are part of the sum 
of the acts which are relied upon to effectuate the conspiracy which the statute forbids, they come within its prohibition.""); In re 
Medical X-Ray Film Antitrust Litigation, 946 F. Supp. at 218; ITT World Communications Inc. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 
524 F. Supp. at 704. For this reason, the AMA's argument set forth in its supplemental memorandum that plaintiffs allegedly 
conceded that the FREIDA database is lawful does not inform the Court's analysis. See Supplemental Memorandum of 
Defendant American Medical Association in Support of Its Motion to Dismiss the Complaint Against It for Failure to State a Claim 
at 2."
1488,34," The Court rejects plaintiffs' governing sponsor allegations as insufficient for the reasons stated in Section IV(B)(2), supra. "
1489,35," Four institutional defendants have joined the ACGME's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See Beth Israel Joinder at 1; 
Duke/Sinai Joinder at 1; NY/Presb. Joinder at 1-2."
1489,36," ""Marjorie Webster is of questionable vitality after Goldfarb, to the extent that it draws a bright line between education and 
business, or accreditation policy and commerce."" Welch v. American Psychoanalytic Assn., No. 85 Civ. 1651, 1986 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 27182, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. April 4, 1986). See also Foundation for Interior Design Education Research v. Savannah College 
of Art & Design, 244 F.3d 521, 530 (6th Cir. 2001). "
1491,37," Similarly, plaintiffs define the defendant class in relevant part as ""all ACGME-accredited Sponsoring Institutions as of the date 
of certification of the Defendant Class, and entities that were ACGME-accredited Sponsoring Institutions at any time since May 
7, 1998."" Id. P58. Yeshiva therefore does not fall into the proposed defendant class because it is not a ""sponsoring institution"" as 
that term is defined. "
1519,1," This Entry is a matter of public record and may be made available to the public on the court's web site, but it is not intended for 
commercial publication either electronically or in paper form. Although the ruling or rulings in this Entry will govern the case 
presently before this court, this court does not consider the discussion in this Entry to be sufficiently novel or instructive to justify 
commercial publication or the subsequent citation of it in other proceedings."
1519,2," These undisputed background facts are taken from the parties' Rule 56.1 factual assertions where supported by specific 
citation to evidentiary materials and substantiated by the cited materials as well as the procedural history of the case. Additional 
facts may be provided as necessary in the discussion portion of the entry."
1519,3," McLaughlin's Response to Statement of Material Facts No. 32 denied this assertion. The response cited the Goldsmith 
Affidavit, Exhibits 16 and 22, the latter which is the deposition of Hi Tillery, Exhibit 404 as evidentiary support for its denial. The "
1520,," nonspecific citation to Exhibit 16 (employment records of Timothy Durham) in its entirety, which exhibit consists of numerous 
pages, is improper. Also, Exhibit 16 does not appear to contain anything to contradict Newcourt's assertion. As explained infra, 
Exhibit 404 to the Tillery deposition is inadmissible hearsay and thus fails to raise a genuine issue of fact. "
1523,4," The same is true regarding her opinion that the relevant product market is the sale of Carpenter buses to end users, though it 
seems McLaughlin no longer asserts this as a relevant product market. Regardless, this opinion is based on unreliable data or 
information, no market analysis (see McCutcheon Dep. 4/30/98 at 64-65, 76; McCutcheon Dep. 2/6/01 at 43 (stating she has no 
information whether the 158 buyers who purchased from Carpenter also purchased other brands of school buses)) and 
unsupported by any acceptable methodology or cross-elasticity of demand analysis. (McCutcheon Suppl. Dep. P12 (asserting 
that ""data to perform cross-elasticity of demand analysis . . . was not available"")). "
1526,5," The court does not address the Tillery testimony that Tillery Chevrolet was terminated as a Carpenter dealer because it did not 
sign up for the Newcourt floor plan, the Shetky testimony that only three Carpenter dealers had not signed up for the floor plan, 
or the attachment (a computer printout) to Timothy McLaughlin's affidavit, as it is unnecessary to do so in that the assertions 
supported by these submissions are not material to resolution of the summary judgment motion. The objections to the Hageness 
testimony regarding price increases following McLaughlin's exit from the school bus business are addressed infra, see Section 
VIII.A. at pages 58-59. "
1528,6," The statute of limitations was tolled while the motion to amend the complaint was pending from November 16, 1998, until 
September 9, 1999. See Moore v. State of Ind., 999 F.2d 1125, 1131 (7th Cir. 1993) (stating that the submission of a motion for 
leave to amend a complaint tolls the statute of limitations). "
1529,7," To the extent that McLaughlin asserts claims under any other provision of federal or state antitrust law, such claims are 
considered waived as McLaughlin has not specifically identified any other provisions. "
1530,8," ""A market is cross-elastic if rising prices for product A cause consumers to switch to product B."" Telecor, 305 F.3d at 1131."
1530,9," McLaughlin's request to strike any argument in Newcourt's reply brief regarding the distributorship market (Pl.'s Mem. Resp. 
Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at 14 n.17) is denied. Though Dr. McCutcheon stated in an affidavit filed in the Minnesota action that the 
relevant markets included the market for distributorships of large school buses and for Carpenter buses (McCutcheon Aff. 
4/15/99 (Goldsmith Aff., Ex. 75)), that the relevant product market is a Carpenter distributorship cannot be fairly gleaned from 
her expert report submitted in this action. (See McCutcheon Rep. PP6-9, 12 (stating that the relevant market was ""the market for 
school buses"").) In discussing tying, Dr. McCutcheon describes the tie-in between ""the sale of buses to a dealer"" and the tie-in of 
""bus sales."" (Id. at 7.) She nowhere states in her report that the tie-in/tying product is Carpenter distributorships."
1530,10," Even if it were, McLaughlin's expert evidence that this constitutes the relevant product market is inadmissible and insufficient 
to create a genuine issue of fact."
1530,11," McLaughlin submits that a distributorship may be a tying product. (Pl.'s Mem. Resp. at 14). The cases cited for support, 
however, involve situations in which the plaintiff had paid a franchise fee for the franchise. See, e.g., Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat 
Corp., 606 F.2d 704, 722 (7th Cir. 1979) (stating that a ""franchise license"" can be a tying product; plaintiff had paid for each 
franchise); Little Caesar Enters., Inc. v. Smith, 34 F. Supp. 2d 459, 502 (E.D. Mich. 1998) (stating that a franchise and its 
continued operation can be a tying product; plaintiff had paid an initial franchise fee). McLaughlin also argues that a "
1531,," manufacturer's product may constitute the relevant product market under appropriate circumstances. (Pl.'s Mem. Resp. at 17.) 
The other cases it cites for support also are distinguishable. In Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 
451, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 (1992), the Supreme Court concluded that the tying product market was Kodak parts 
because the parts for Kodak equipment were unique and not interchangeable. Id. at 456-57, 463-64. Similarly, in Virtual 
Maintenance, Inc. v. Prime Computer, Inc., 11 F.3d 660 (6th Cir. 1993), the defendant's product was unique and not 
interchangeable with any other product. It has not been shown that Carpenter brand buses are unique and not interchangeable 
with other bus brands. In the other cases cited by McLaughlin, the relevant product market was not defined as a manufacturer's 
product. (See Pl.'s Mem. Resp. at 17.) "
1534,12," Dr. McCutcheon asserted that Carpenter had a 13% market share of type 1 bus sales sold to school districts in the state of 
Minnesota. (McCutcheon Dep. 2/6/01 at 27-28.) Even assuming that this market share was based on a relevant product and 
geographic market, this evidence fails to raise a reasonable inference that Carpenter had market power. See, e.g., Hardy v. City 
Optical Inc., 39 F.3d 765, 767 (7th Cir. 1994) (identifying 30% as ""the minimum market share"" from which one can infer the 
market power required for a tying case); Valley Liquors, Inc. v. Renfield Imps., Ltd., 822 F.2d 656, 666 (7th Cir. 1987) (""Market 
share analyses in section 1 cases have led to conclusions that approximately 70%-75% of market share constitutes market 
power, and that a 20%-25% market share or less does not constitute market power."") (citations omitted). "
1536,13," Even if the relevant tied product market is the financing of Carpenter buses, the Plaintiff's evidence is nonetheless insufficient 
to establish a substantial danger that Newcourt would acquire market power in the relevant market. The undisputed evidence is 
that a dealer was required to floor plan its buses only while they were at Carpenter; once a dealer picked up its Carpenter buses, 
it could pay for them with its own money or with funds obtained from alternative financing (Rost 2/7/01 Dep. at 7-8, 33, 111; Mar. 
16, 1995 Memo from Whitesell to All Distributors), and there is evidence that dealers did so (Gorman Dep. at 6-7; Rost 2/7/01 
Dep. at 6-7; Gerdes Dep. at 8-10). McLaughlin has not produced evidence of any danger that Newcourt (or Carpenter) could 
raise the costs of financing Carpenter buses above a competitive level without losing financing business to these other sources 
once the buses were picked up by the dealers. Thus, McLaughlin has failed to show a substantial danger that Newcourt would 
obtain market power in the tied product market of financing Carpenter buses, which is another basis upon which summary 
judgment must be granted Newcourt on the tying claim. See, e.g., A.O. Smith Corp., 979 F.2d at 550 (an antitrust plaintiff ""must 
prove the substantial danger that defendant will acquire market power in the tied [product] market""). "
1540,14," There, the plaintiff Grace was the bankruptcy trustee for S.I. Greene Company, a competitor of the defendant E.J. Kozin. 
Kane, Greene's vice-president and sales manager, arranged for Greene to purchase substantial quantities of seafood from 
Kozin and convinced Kozin to allow him to represent it as a sales agent to customers other than Greene. In exchange, Kozin 
agreed to pay Kane one-half of all profits made on purchases by Kane on behalf of Greene and the other customers to whom 
Kane sold Kozin seafood. Grace, 538 F.2d at 172. The court found that Kozin and Kane had entered into a joint enterprise 
""whereby they purchased seafood products and resold them to Greene and other companies."" Id. at 173. Kane clearly was an 
agent and employee of Greene. In addition, Greene and Kozin were competitors, whereas, McLaughlin and Newcourt/Carpenter 
are not competitors. "
1541,15," The provision provides in part that: ""When the words of a law in their application to an existing situation are clear and free from 
all ambiguity, the letter of the law shall not be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing the spirit."" Minn. Stat. § 645.16. "
1542,16," McLaughlin says that it has withdrawn its C-R-MB enterprise RICO claims. (Pl.'s Mem. Resp. at 24 n.30.) It has not formally 
withdrawn or dismissed such claims. Thus, summary judgment should be GRANTED Newcourt on such claims, and no further 
discussion is required. "
1543,17," The Seventh Circuit, however, has observed that ""the majority view is that the mere reinvestment of the racketeering proceeds 
into a business activity is not sufficient for § 1962(a) standing."" Viacom, Inc. v. Harbridge Merch. Servs., Inc., 20 F.3d 771, 779, 
n.6 (7th Cir. 1994) (citing, e.g., Brittingham v. Mobil Corp., 943 F.2d 297, 305 (3d Cir. 1991) (""If [reinvestment] were to suffice, 
the use-or- investment injury requirement would be almost completely eviscerated when the alleged pattern of racketeering is "
1544,," committed on behalf of a corporation. . . . Over the long term, corporations generally reinvest their profits, regardless of 
source.""))."
1544,18," As evidentiary support, McLaughlin cites to the Goldsmith Affidavit: Exhibit 46 at N-L0109, a copy of letter dated 6/30/94 from 
Bradley Nullmeyer of Newcourt to James Cochran offering terms of employment including provision of bonuses; Exhibit 47, 
documents related to Newcourt's employment of Tim Durham regarding bonuses; Exhibit 16 at N09713-14, a June 30, 1994 
offer and terms of employment to Durham by Newcourt including provision for bonuses based on new vendors and volume; 
Exhibit 16 at N09709, a memo regarding Durham's 1995 bonus based on targeted active dealer floor plans, retail volume and 
gross profits; and Timothy McLaughlin's deposition, pages 111-13, 141-42 and 380. None of these documents, however, hint at 
showing how McLaughlin was proximately injured by Newcourt's use or investment of racketeering income. "
1547,19," If it had any such entitlements, it has not directed the court to specific record evidence to prove them."
1547,20," For evidentiary support, McLaughlin cites to the Goldsmith Affidavit, Exhibits 38 and 39, which are Plaintiff's Answers and 
Objections to Newcourt Defendant's Second Set of Interrogatories and the Plaintiff's Supplemental Answers to Newcourt 
Defendants' second Set of Interrogatories Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 12. The former document is over 37 pages in length; the latter is 
approximately 19 pages in length. The court is not required to, and declines to comb through these voluminous documents in 
search of the evidentiary substantiation for the Plaintiff's claims absent specific citation by the Plaintiff. Thus, the general citation 
to these documents in their entirety is insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether 
misrepresentations were made to McLaughlin."
1547,21," McLaughlin cited to Exhibit 39, but this appears to be a typographical error."
1547,22," Though Newcourt has not moved for summary judgment on the ground that the alleged misrepresentations about dealing in 
good faith and termination only for good cause are barred by the applicable statute of limitations, based on the interrogatory 
answers which support a finding that such representations were made at the latest upon execution of the Distributorship 
Agreement in 1994 (see Goldsmith Aff., Ex. 38, No. 5 at 25, 26), it appears that any RICO claim based on these representations 
as predicate acts would be time barred. See Rotella v. Wood, 528 U.S. 549, 553, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1047, 120 S. Ct. 1075 (2000) "
1548,," (civil RICO action governed by 4-year statute of limitations); Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Assocs., Inc., 483 U.S. 143, 
156, 97 L. Ed. 2d 121, 107 S. Ct. 2759 (1987). Thus, the statute of limitations bars any claim which accrued before November 
22, 1994, and would bar the RICO claim based on these predicate acts. McLaughlin also claims that Newcourt misrepresented that the floor plan did not have to be used (Pl.'s Mem. Resp. at 32 (citing 
Goldsmith Aff., Ex. 8), but McLaughlin never established a Newcourt floor plan, so this misrepresentation could not have 
proximately caused any injury to McLaughlin. "
1550,23," It was contemplated that Cochran and Durham would be employees of a new company, Newco, but Newco was never formed."
1550,24," McLaughlin argues that Hodgson had a clear role (Pl.'s Mem. Resp. Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at 36), but does not direct the court 
to any evidence to establish what that role was. Thus, this conclusory assertion fails to create a genuine issue. "
1552,25," An exception to this rule exists where the cause of action is created by statute and the statute includes a time within which the 
cause of action must be asserted. See Horvath v. Davidson, 148 Ind. App. 203, 264 N.E.2d 328, 334 (Ind. Ct. App. 1970). That 
is not the situation with regard to any of the Plaintiff's statutory claims with the exception of the claims under the Minnesota 
Franchise Act, which contains a three year limitations period. Minn. Stat. Ann. § 80C.17 subd., 5. "
1553,26," But even if the court considered these other factors, it would reach the same conclusion."
1553,27," The same is true in order to prevail on a fraud claim under Indiana law. See Rice v. Strunk, 670 N.E.2d 1280, 1289 (Ind. 
1996). "
1554,28," Again, the same result would obtain under Indiana law. See Rice, 670 N.E.2d at 1289 (reliance is an element of fraud)."
1554,29," Because McLaughlin cannot show reliance on such representations, the court need not address the argument that such 
representations cannot support an actionable deceit claim because they were representations of law."
1554,30, See note 6 supra.
1554,31, A fraud claim under Indiana law also would be barred.
1554,32," There are two paragraph 14s in the Second Set of Interrogatories. For clarity, the court will refer to them as 14[a] and 14[b]."
1554,33," Newcourt replies that McLaughlin has changed the theory upon which its deceit claim is based. The theory now at the 
centerpiece of McLaughlin's deceit claim can be gleaned from the Amended Complaint, though it seems that there has been a 
shift in McLaughlin's emphasis on these alleged misrepresentations. "
1555,34," The only such laws expressly identified in the Amended Complaint are the Minnesota Franchise Act and the Minnesota Motor 
Vehicle Sale and Distribution Act, §§ 80E and 80C. However, the Plaintiff's Answers and Supplemental Answers to First 
Interrogatories indicate that claims are asserted under various provisions of the Montana Sales and Distribution of Motor 
Vehicles Act, a ""miscellaneous"" North Dakota statutory provision, and various provisions under the South Dakota Vehicle 
Dealers Act. "
1556,35," The Indiana Supreme Court subsequently limited Whitehouse to legal malpractice actions. See Pokraka, 595 N.E.2d at 247; 
see also Lewis, 326 F.3d at 855 (explaining that Whitehouse is based ""implicitly on the proposition that where one party to a 
contract owes a fiduciary duty to the other party, a breach of that duty necessarily gives rise to an action in tort because it is 
impossible to contract around fiduciary obligations""). "
1560,36," ""Manufacturer"" is defined in the MVSDA as ""any person who manufactures or assembles new motor vehicles or any person, 
partnership, firm, association, joint venture, corporation, or trust which is controlled by the manufacturer."" Minn. Stat. § 80E.03, 
subd. 4."
1560,37," Exhibit 23 is a copy of a letter from Newcourt to Timothy Durham, President of Carpenter, dated June 30, 1994, offering to 
purchase Carpenter Financial Inc., with attached Schedules. Exhibit 46 is a copy of a letter from Bradley Nullmeyer of Newcourt 
to James Cochran, President of Carpenter Financial Inc., offering terms of employment."
1560,38," Summary judgment on the claim under Minnesota Statute §§ 80E.12 also is appropriate because McLaughlin has not 
contested Newcourt's assertion that there is insufficient evidence to establish a violation of that provision. Summary judgment 
also should be granted on § 80E.13, subd. (j) because McLaughlin has presented no evidence that Newcourt prevented it from 
""receiving fair and reasonable compensation for the value of the new motor vehicle dealership."" Minn. Stat. § 80E.13, subd. (j). "
1561,39," If Newcourt intends to argue that McLaughlin cannot bring a claim under the statute because it never had a place of business 
in Montana, the court is unaware of any such requirement. "
1573,1," These technologies are described in some detail at Rambus, Inc. v. Infineon Techs. AG, 164 F. Supp. 2d 743, 747-48 (E.D. Va. 
2001). "
1574,2," Infineon will not proceed with the following affirmative defenses: unenforceability due to waiver, and implied license."
1574,3, Monopolization is also a crime under 15 U.S.C. § 2.
1574,4," Count 12 is paragraphs 242 through 259 of the proffered amendment but paragraph 242 incorporates by reference preceding 
paragraphs 74-196."
1574,5, Several other paragraphs in the series PP 74-196 elaborate on these allegations and make other ones.
1574,6," Some, but certainly not all, of the incorporated allegations are of little, if any, efficacy by virtue of the decision of the Federal 
Circuit on Infineon's fraud counterclaims. "
1575,7," See generally Rambus, Inc. v. Infineon Techs. AG, 155 F. Supp. 2d 668, 680-83 (E.D. Va. 2001) (discussing Rambus' litigation 
misconduct and document destruction)."
1575,8," Jurisdiction over Count 15 would be under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). HN3[
] In exercising supplemental jurisdiction over state law 
claims, a federal court must apply the applicable state's substantive law. See Johnson v. Hugo's Skateway, 974 F.2d 1408, 
1416. n.7 (4th Cir. 1992). Thus, in considering the legal sufficiency of proposed Count 15, it is necessary to apply the 
substantive law of California--including any statutory interpretations of Section 17200 given by the California courts--to Infineon's 
proposed unfair competition counterclaim."
1575,9," The broad reach of Section 17200 has, in fact, become the subject of some concern in the academy. E.g., Joshua Taylor, Note, 
Why the Increasing Role of Public Policy in California's Unfair Competition Law is a Slippery Slope in the Wrong Direction, 52 
Hastings L. J. 1131 (2001); Peter J. Weid, Patently Unfair: State Unfair Competition Laws & Patent Enforcement, 12 Harv. J.L. & 
Tech. 469, 487 (1999). "
1576,10," Moreover, in keeping with this equitable pedigree, HN7[
] the remedies available under Section 17200 are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution; plaintiffs may not receive damages or attorney's fees under the statute. Cel-Tech 
Communications, Inc., 973 P.2d at 539."
1576,11," Because this is an action arising under the federal patent laws, the decisional law of the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Federal Circuit, rather than that of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, is controlling as respects any issues 
of patent law. Silicon Image, Inc. v. Genesis Microchip, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 840, 849 (E.D. Va. 2003). Of course, HN12[
] in 
deciding procedural matters that are unrelated to patent issues, the Federal Circuit adjudicates in accordance with the applicable 
regional circuit law. Wang Labs., Inc. v. Applied Computer Sci., Inc., 958 F.2d 355, 357 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Therefore, because the 
question of amendment under Rule 15(a) is a procedural matter not peculiar to patent law, Fourth Circuit precedent--as refined 
by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court--is controlling. Id.; see also Silicon Image, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d at 849. "
1577,12," HN17[
] The ""unlawful"" prong of Section 17200 borrows violations of other laws, treats them as unlawful acts or business practices and thereby makes them independently actionable. Cel-Tech Communications, Inc., 973 P.2d at 539-40; Pastoria, 6 
Cal. Rptr. 3d at 153."
1577,13, That decision was not appealed and thus is the law of this case. 
1578,14," Indeed, the Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. court noted that HN19[
] the decisional law interpreting section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, see 15 U.S.C. § 45(a), is persuasive in determining whether a particular act or practice is ""unfair"" under 
Section 17200. 973 P.2d at 543. Infineon's proposed counterclaim mirrors the conduct alleged to have constituted ""unfair 
methods of competition"" in the Federal Trade Commission's (""FTC"") section 5 action against Rambus, which has survived a 
motion for summary decision and is currently pending in the FTC. See generally The Lawyer's Column, Wash. Post., Dec. 29, 
2003, at El. This parallel between 15 U.S.C. § 45(a) and the ""unfair"" prong of Section 17200 further buttresses a finding that 
Infineon's proposed counterclaim is not futile. "
1579,15," The Federal Circuit then went on to discuss, and affirm, the decision of this Court granting Rambus' motion for JMOL 
respecting the DDR-SDRAM's standard-setting process because ""Infineon did not show that Rambus had a duty to disclose 
before the DDR-SDRAM's standard-setting process formally began."" Rambus, Inc., 318 F.3d at 1105."
1579,16," Committee on Children's Television, Inc. v. Gen. Foods Corp., 35 Cal. 3d 197, 197 Cal. Rptr. 783, 673 P.2d 660, 669-70 (Cal. 
1983); Prata v. Superior Court, 91 Cal. App. 4th 1128, 111 Cal. Rptr. 2d 296, 309 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001)."
1579,17," Kunert, 1 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 606."
1579,18," See South Bay Chevrolet v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., 72 Cal. App. 4th 861, 85 Cal. Rptr. 2d 301, 317 (Cal. Ct. App. 
1999). In addition, HN22[
] fraud under Section 17200 is a strict liability offense. People ex rel. Van de Kamp v. Cappuccio, Inc., 204 Cal. App. 3d 750, 251 Cal. Rptr. 657, 664 (Cal. Ct. App. 1988). "
1580,19," In fact, although it overturned the jury's finding of fraud, the appellate court stated that the evidence presented at trial ""did not 
put Rambus in the best light,"" and that Rambus' JEDEC-related acts and practices tended to ""impeach Rambus's business 
ethics."" Rambus, Inc., 318 F.3d at 1104. Such statements actually tend to support, rather than foreclose, Infineon's proposed 
Section 17200 ""unfair"" prong counterclaim. "
1582,20," Furthermore, the very fact that Rambus failed to disclose these documents in the discovery period leading up to the first trial is 
in-and-of-itself a potential component of Infineon's Section 17200 claim. "
1583,21," Moreover, the parties have known for almost a year that a remand was ordered in this case and it has been six months since 
the FTC hearings were concluded. Thus, Rambus' counsel has had ample time, opportunity, and motivation to become fully 
familiar with the material that surfaced in the FTC proceedings."
1583,22," Under California law, spoliation consists of the intentional destruction or suppression of evidence so as to prevent an 
adversary from using it at a trial. Laborde v. Aronson, 92 Cal. App. 4th 459, 112 Cal. Rptr. 2d 119, 122 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001); R.S. 
Creative, Inc. v. Creative Cotton, Ltd., 75 Cal. App. 4th 486, 89 Cal. Rptr. 2d 353, 361 (Cal. Ct. App. 1999). Cf. Cal. Civ. Code § 
47(b)(2). "
1584,23," Moreover, if Rambus were to obtain evidence in discovery that there is a custom or practice in the community of engineering 
businesses to destroy documents in order to prevent their use in litigation, such a custom or policy would be impermissible under 
Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2023. Thus, if there is such a custom or practice in the engineering field, its existence would avail 
Rambus nothing. Cf. Cappuccio, Inc., 251 Cal. Rptr. at 665. "
1603,1," The issues for which Napster believes that there are disputed issues of fact are: plaintiffs' ownership of the copyrighted works 
at issue, copying of the works, fair use, the application of Sony, the extent of Napster's control over its system and its policing 
obligation, the extent of the Napster system's architecture, the sufficiency of plaintiffs' notices and Napster's removal of those 
works, application of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, copyright misuse, and willfulness."
1603,2," This order does not stay the entirety of plaintiffs' summary judgment motion. The court will reach a determination on the other 
issues raised by plaintiffs, but intends that necessary discovery commence on the threshold issues of ownership and misuse. 
The court denies Napster's request for further discovery related to Napster's fair use defense, an issue that will be discussed in a 
subsequent order."
1603,3," To the extent referenced in this order, the declarations of Hank Barry and Roger Noll are unsealed. "
1604,4," This termination right is under the 1976 Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. § 203. The 1909 Act - which applies to pre-1978 works - 
operates in a similar fashion, though the length of the term is different. 17 U.S.C. § 304. "
1605,5," The nine types of works are: a contribution to a collective work, part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, a translation, 
a supplementary work, a compilation, an instructional text, a test, answer material for a test, or an atlas. 17 U.S.C. § 101(2). The 
statute also lists works that qualify as supplementary works."
1605,6," Napster also challenges whether the other two elements of ""specially commissioned"" works are met. Because the court grants 
Napster's request for further discovery, the court does not reach these issues at this time."
1605,7," The actual history of this attempted revision is intriguing. The recording industry succeeded in amending the definition of work 
made for hire to include sound recordings by claiming the change would be only a technical amendment. When the amendment 
went into effect in 2000, there was a tremendous outcry - the rest of the recording community did not see the amendment as a 
technical change. See, e.g., RAC Amicus Br. at Exh. 1. The change was repealed retroactively. P.L. No. 106-379 (enacted 
2000). Today the definition of works made for hire includes the following text regarding this attempted amendment: HN11[
] In determining whether any work is eligible to be considered a work made for hire under paragraph (2), neither 
the amendment contained in section 1011(d) of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 
1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106-113, nor the deletion of the words added by that amendment- (A) shall be considered or otherwise given any legal significance, or (B) shall be interpreted to indicate congressional approval or disapproval of, or acquiescence in, any judicial determination, 
by the courts or the Copyright Office. Paragraph (2) shall be interpreted as if both section 2(a)(1) of the Work Made For Hire 
and Copyright Corrections Act of 2000 and section 1011(d) of the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus 
Reform Act of 1999, as enacted by section 1000(a)(9) of Public Law 106-113, were never enacted, and without regard to 
any inaction or awareness by the Congress at any time of any judicial determinations."
1605,17, U.S.C. § 101. 
1606,8," The court emphasizes that whatever determination is reached with respect to the presumption of ownership raised by plaintiffs' 
copyright certificates (and the corresponding presumption that all facts in the certificates are to be taken as true) only relates to 
the parties in this litigation and not to third parties (such as members of RAC) whose rights might otherwise be prejudiced. "
1607,9," While the present motion addresses only the 213 Complaint Works, this action involves the alleged infringement of thousands 
of plaintiffs' works. The maximum statutory damages are $ 150,000 per act of infringement. See 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). "
1609,10," This approach labels certain activities as per se copyright misuse and uses a rule of reason approach for others. See  
Frischmann & Moylan, The Evolving Common Law Doctrine of Copyright Misuse, 15 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 865, 898. For those 
activities that fall within the rule of reason test, the court first asks whether the restraint is within the scope of the copyright 
monopoly.  Id. If it is, then the conduct is per se legal. Id. If not, the court then asks whether the activity as a whole promotes or 
restricts competition. Id. If the particular activity (e.g. licensing provision) restricts competition, then it is copyright misuse. Id."
1609,11," In comparison, there is a substantial body of case law on patent misuse. See, e.g.,  Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger, 314 
U.S. 488, 86 L. Ed. 363, 62 S. Ct. 402, 1942 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 733 (1942). Patent misuse bases its analysis on antitrust 
principles and consequently is doctrinally analogous to antitrust-based copyright misuse. It is less helpful when employing the 
""public policy"" analysis adopted by the Ninth Circuit. "
1610,12," In  Saturday Evening Post v. Rumbleseat Press, Inc., 816 F.2d 1191, 1200 (7th Cir. 1987), Judge Posner reiterated the 
Seventh's Circuit's belief that courts should rely on antitrust principles in misuse claims: 'If misuse claims are not to be tested by conventional antitrust principles, by what principles shall they be tested? Our law is 
not rich with alternative concepts of monopolistic abuse; and it is rather late in the date to try to develop one without in the 
process subjecting the rights of patent holders to debilitating uncertainty.' This point applies with even greater force to 
copyright misuse, where the danger of monopoly is less. Id. (quoting  USM Corp. v. SPS Technologies, Inc., 694 F.2d 505, 512 (7th Cir. 1982)) "
1611,13," There are also allegations by Napster that the pricing structure of the MusicNet agreement prevents Napster from obtaining 
licenses from parties other than the five major record companies. See Barry Dec., Exh. 1. "
1612,14," Plaintiffs find themselves in a catch-22 because if MusicNet does not obtain these licenses, the licensing provision may be 
unduly restrictive, and if MusicNet does obtain licenses from the non-MusicNet plaintiffs, such cross-licensing implicates 
potential antitrust concerns. See Noll Dec. P110."
1612,15," Although there may be a triumvirate with seemingly Zeus-like powers, the analogy is certainly imperfect. Perhaps some of the 
thunder god's brethren present a more appropriate object for comparison."
1612,16," Plaintiffs' argument would have merit if there was any evidence that Napster introduced and negotiated for the exclusivity 
provision. In that scenario, it would be unseemly to allow Napster to use the same provision as protection against infringement 
actions. Such a rule would create perverse incentives to artificially manufacture overreaching clauses as liability shields under 
the misuse doctrine. However, the evidence thus far shows that the relevant provisions were inserted at MusicNet's urging and 
not as an end-run around copyright laws by Napster. See Barry Dec. P19. "
1613,17," Because more discovery is necessary before reaching a final decision on Napster's misuse defense, the court does not rule on 
plaintiffs' objections at this time. "
1615,18," Because the court focuses on harm to the public as a relevant factor in whether an unclean hands bar to misuse exists, it 
logically follows that the distinction between whether plaintiffs are seeking legal or equitable relief is less significant than 
suggested by  Alcatel. It is possible that the public interest implicated by a misuse defense might justify allowing the defense 
even where defendants have unclean hands and plaintiffs are seeking solely legal relief. "
1616,19," The relative inequitableness of Napster's conduct is tied to this court's determination of Napster's willfulness. Logically, HN25[ ] the mere act of infringement is not enough for unclean hands because such a rule would bar any infringer, innocent or 
intentional, from asserting misuse. Unclean hands must result from some particularly reprehensible conduct. See, e.g.,  Atari, 
975 F.2d at 846 (""Atari lied to the Copyright Office in order to obtain the copyrighted [software] program.""). As a general matter, 
the same conduct often supports a finding of willfulness. "
1619,1," The potential loss of discounts on sutures is allegedly a substantial deterrent, because of the large volume of sutures that 
hospitals use. (FAC, P 4.)"
1619,2," Regarding the competitors' relative market power, AMR alleges that: (1) Johnson & Johnson's approximate share of the 
relevant market for trocars has been in excess of 65% at all times relevant to this action, increasing to over 75% by 2002; (2) its 
approximate share of the relevant market for clip appliers has been in excess of 60%, increasing to over 65% by 2002; and (3) 
its approximate share of the relevant market for sutures has been over 80%. In contrast, AMR's approximate share of the 
relevant market for trocars is approximately 2%, and its approximate share of the relevant market for clip appliers is 1%. "
1620,3," This is not a case in which there is no relevant evidence to support an allegation of conspiracy to restrain trade, for example. 
Cf. Adaptive Power Solutions, LLC v. Hughes Missile Sys. Co., 141 F.3d 947 (9th Cir. 1998). To the contrary, it is a case in 
which the existence of a contract is both sufficiently pled and undisputed. Nor is Novation's participation here so passive as to 
make it analogous to the ""gift"" recipient in Virginia Vermiculite, Ltd. v. Historic Green Springs. Inc., 307 F.3d 277, 281-82 (4th 
Cir. 2002) "
1621,4," In this regard, the Court finds Novation's reliance on Dickson v. Microsoft Corporation, 309 F.3d 193 (4th Cir. 2002), misplaced. 
In that case, the plaintiffs alleged ""two separate vertical conspiracies between Dell and Microsoft and Compaq and Microsoft."" Id. 
at 200. It is therefore unsurprising that the Fourth Circuit considered the two conspiracies individually, id. at 205, 207, and held 
that the plaintiffs' claims were properly dismissed because they did not allege that either Compaq or Dell had market power on 
its own, id. at 208. Here, in contrast, AMR does not allege two separate conspiracies, but rather claims that Johnson & 
Johnson's exclusive dealing contracts with entities such as Novation and Premier foreclosed a substantial portion of the markets 
at issue. "
1628,1," The Amended Complaint names eleven plaintiffs, including five ERISA-qualified employee benefit plans, a voluntary employee

1629,2," The Amended Master Consolidated Complaint (the ""AMCC"") pleads causes of action under the Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act (""RICO""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962 (c), (d); Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26; the Sherman Act, 
15 U.S.C. § 1; the antitrust statutes of 22 states; state consumer protection statutes of 11 states; and civil conspiracy law. The 
AMCC also seeks declaratory relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201, 2202. Plaintiffs bring this 
action on behalf of themselves and two classes: [1] The AWP Payor Class: All persons or entities who, for purposes other than resale and during the Class Period, paid any portion of the purchase for 
a prescription drug manufactured by a Defendant Drug Manufacturer (as identified in Appendix A) at a price calculated by 
reference to the published AWP during the Class Period. [2] Sub-Class: The PBM Third-Party Payor Class: All Third-Party Payors that, during the Class Period, contracted with a PBM to provide to its participants a prescription drug 
manufactured by a Defendant Drug Manufacturer and identified in Appendix A. (P 595.)"
1629,3," The Defendants do not address separately this paradigm, but they make arguments under Rule 9(b) in the context of the 
second paradigm that are applicable to both the first and second paradigms. "
1630,4," 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) (2000) provides: HN3[
] It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of 
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such 
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity …. "

Corporation. "
1637,6, Defendants address the non-antitrust claims only summarily and the Court declines to dismiss them. 
1640,7, The Court does not decide at this point whether Plaintiffs have standing to assert claims on behalf of elderly program enrollees. 
1644,1," The named purchaser plaintiffs are: Harold Gillet, David Holzman, Yakov Prager and Susan Silverberg."
1644,2," The Defendant Underwriters named in this action are: A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc.; BancBoston Robertson, Stephens, Inc.;

1645,3," Below is a brief, general description of the IPO Process as described by Plaintiffs in their memorandum of law submitted in 
opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss."
1645,4," The managing underwriter negotiates with the issuer to set the terms of the IPO and then becomes the ""lead underwriter"" in the 
issuance of the IPO. The lead underwriter is then joined by other underwriters to create a syndicate of underwriters. As a group, 
the syndicate is responsible for selling all of the IPO shares they have committed to sell in the Underwriting Agreement. 
Accordingly, all members of the syndicate will receive some portion of the underwriting fee depending on their level of 
commitment and responsibility. "
1648,5," The Court noted two exceptions to the general rule that only direct purchasers have standing to sue for antitrust violations: (1) 
when there exists a pre-existing, fixed quantity, cost plus contract with all the parties in the distribution chain, or (2) when the 
direct purchaser is owned or controlled by its customer. Id. 431 U.S. 735-36. It is clear that neither of these two noted exceptions 
apply here. "
1650,6," Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs are indirect purchasers of Defendants' underwriting services as defined in Illinois Brick, 
the Court does not reach the standing question under Associated General. However, it is clear that when the Supreme Court 
established the five factors to be considered by a court when determining whether a class of Plaintiffs had standing to sue under 
Section 4 of the Clayton Act,  the threat of duplicative liability and complex apportionment of damages was clearly in the forefront 
of their minds. Accordingly, Plaintiffs case would suffer the same fate under an Associated General analysis that it has under 
Illinois Brick. "
1658,1," The plaintiffs' claim of tortious interference with contract and prospective business advantage (Sec. Compl., PP 93-98) was 
dismissed by the Honorable Richard M. Berman as to Local 3 only. See U.S. Info. Sys. v. IBEW Local Union No. 3, 2002 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 1038, No. 00 Civ. 4763, 2002 WL 91625, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2002). "
1659,2," Dr. Dunbar defined electrical installation as ""electrical equipment that is fixed or to be fixed in, on, under or over any land."" 
(Dunbar Report at 5). He went on to note that electrical contractors generally engage in one or more of the following tasks: ""(1) 
performing electrical work at the site (e.g., installing wiring); (2) servicing electrical equipment at the site; and (3) the combined 
activity of selling and installing electrical equipment. The electrical work performed includes new work, additions, alterations, and 
maintenance and repairs."" (Dunbar Report at 5). "
1661,3," HN2[
] To state a monopoly leveraging claim, a plaintiff must allege that the defendants ""(1) possessed monopoly power in 
one market; (2) used that power to gain a competitive advantage over [plaintiffs] in another distinct market; and (3) caused injury 
by such anticompetitive conduct."" Virgin Atlantic Airways, Ltd. v. British Airways PLC, 257 F.3d 256, 272 (2d Cir. 2001). "
1662,4," While Dr. Dunbar refers to this percentage in his report as both 20% and 25% (Dunbar Report at 43), his numerical calculations

1666,6," The plaintiffs also explain how Dr. Dunbar used regression analysis in calculating damages. They state that ""Dr. Dunbar started 
with a given on the claimed lost jobs, i.e., the revenue based on the bid price. What he did not know for each job -- because it 
was not awarded -- was the costs which would have been incurred and is necessary to compute the net profit."" The regression 
analysis was a correlation between ""USIS revenues and costs on other actual projects so that [Dr. Dunbar] could determine the 
best estimate of costs to be used for each lost job."" (Pl. Daubert Resp. at 8). "
1667,7," There is no single ""Jacoby/Elzinga Theory."" Rather, the Ashenfelter/Farber Rebuttal Report cites to separate publications by 
Neil H. Jacoby and Kenneth G. Elzinga. (Ashenfelter/Farber Reb. Report at 2 nn.2, 3) (citing Neil H. Jacoby, Relative Stability of 
Market Shares: Theory and Evidence from Several Industries, 12 J. of Industrial Economics 82 (1964); Kenneth G. Elzinga, New 
Developments on the Cartel Front, The Antitrust Bulletin, Spring 1984; at 3-26). "
1669,8," The plaintiffs explain that although this database did contain information on ""thousands"" of jobs bid by USIS during the time 
period, the entire population of those jobs was of limited use. According to them, ""fully 85% of [the jobs] were either outside the 
relevant seven county geographic market covered by this case or were below the $ 50,000 threshold selected as the basis for 
evaluating damages in this case."" (Pl. Daubert Resp. at 6)."
1669,9," The defendants also claim that there was selection bias in the first wave of subpoenas. The defendants assert that of the first 
round of subpoena recipients, 36 were ""owners or owner's representatives associated with the projects Plaintiffs named in the 
Complaint."" (Toner Letter at 5). Accordingly, the defendants maintain that ""these entities likely would have only documents 
relating only to their own projects, and their selection thus introduced further bias."" (Toner Letter at 5). "
1674,10," The defendants argue that Dr. Dunbar overstated damages by taking the percentage of cases in which the low bidder would 
be expected to win the contract (67%) and applying it only to the projects that USIS lost. (Def. Reply Memo. at 9-10 & n.14; 
Toner Letter at 5 n.4). But the defendants apparently misapprehended Dr. Dunbar's analysis. Because this is a damage 
calculation, he necessarily starts with the universe of projects on which USIS was the low bidder but which it nevertheless lost; 
no damages would be awarded in connection with projects that it won. He then calculates the net profit that USIS would have 
made on the lost projects and discounts it by 33 percent to reflect the fact that even in a competitive market, the low bidder 
would win the contract only 67 percent of the time. Though the accuracy of Dr. Dunbar's figures may be open to dispute, his 
methodology with respect to damages is sound. "

able to respond to changing conditions by having the power to develop efficient and cost-effective methods to provide for 
hospital, medical and health care needs. The general assembly also finds that the increasing competition and changing 
conditions force hospitals and other health care providers to develop market strategies and strategic plans to effectively 
compete. The general assembly further finds that public hospitals in metropolitan areas are presently at a competitive 
disadvantage, and that significant investments in the public assets of private act metropolitan hospital authorities could be

1749,2," In my earlier ruling regarding personal jurisdiction, I referred to evidence indicating that it was the Canadian dealers who would 
not provide warranty coverage for vehicles exported from Canada. See Maier Aff., Exs. 15-16 (Docket Item # 75). This allegation

Boit v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc., 967 F.2d 671, 675 (1st Cir. 1992). For 12(b)(6) motions I must use only the allegations as stated in

1751,5," In a separate lawsuit brought by the dealers, the manufacturers could not use a judgment or finding of a vertical conspiracy in 
this case to prevent the dealers from successfully asserting in the separate lawsuit that they did not in fact conspire with the 
manufacturers, and are therefore not barred by the co-conspirator doctrine from recovering damages from the manufacturers. In 
re Beef Antitrust Litig., 600 F.2d 1148, 1163 (5th Cir. 1979) (citation omitted)."

1752,7," Obviously I leave to the plaintiffs determination of how properly to join the dealers as named defendants. I recognize the

defendant class, or does proof of a conspiracy depend upon proving each defendant's participation in the alleged conspiracy, an

1760,3," It is unclear how the Second Circuit currently views section 12 of the Clayton Act. Compare Goldlawr, Inc., 288 F.2d at 581 (""If 
a corporation is not an inhabitant of, is not found in, and does not transact business in, the district, suit may not be so brought. . .

topic was grey market warranties in general or, specifically, the refusal to honor Canadian warranties in the United States. "
1764,6," Despite the economic realities, I do not treat the corporate activities of the intricate corporate structures present in this case as 
unified action by parents and subsidiaries. I also do not uphold general jurisdiction on this basis over any Canadian defendant, 
each of them a corporate subsidiary, because a subsidiary does not achieve continuous and systematic contacts with the United 
States solely by having a parent company located in the United States. See Saraceno v. S.C. Johnson and Son, Inc., 83 F.R.D. 
65, 67 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (citing Cannon Mfg. Co. v. Cudahy Packing Co., 267 U.S. 333, 69 L. Ed. 634, 45 S. Ct. 250 (1925)); 
Henry v. Offshore Drilling (W.A.) Pty., Ltd., 331 F. Supp. 340, 342 (E.D. La. 1971). However, I am troubled by the fact that 
the corporate websites of these automobile manufacturers and distributors go out of their way to describe the global nature and 
interconnectedness of the various subsidiaries, see n.7, infra. Unwittingly, they make a strong case for the recent conclusions by 
some commentators and courts, that continuing to observe the corporate forms for personal jurisdiction purposes is blinking 
today's economic reality. See, e.g., In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 262 F. Supp. 2d 17, 22-23 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing 
Waldron v. British Petroleum Co., Ltd., 149 F. Supp. 830, 834-35 (S.D.N.Y. 1957)); Lea Brilmayer and Kathleen Paisley, 
Personal Jurisdiction and Substantive Legal Relations: Corporations, Conspiracies, and Agency, 74 Calif. L. Rev. 1, 6 (1986) 
(stating that courts are giving approving attention to the argument that substantive legal relationships with a party may be 
automatically sufficient to establish jurisdiction). See also Scophony, 333 U.S. at 808 (stating that ""practical, business 
conceptions"" should be substituted for ""hair-splitting legal technicalities""). The First Circuit's parsimonious view of parent-
subsidiary relationships, see, e.g., United Elec., 960 F.2d at 1092-93 (requiring proof of lack of corporate independence, 
fraudulent intent and manifest injustice before the corporate unit will be ignored), may be ripe for re-examination, particularly in 
light of the expansive statements these defendants make about North American and global operations, which may indicate they 
should have fair notice of suit in the United States. Recognizing the close relationship between parents and their subsidiaries 
(especially in this case) for jurisdictional purposes would also be consistent with the liability rule that, due to a complete unity of 
interest, the coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary cannot be considered a conspiracy and must be 
viewed as that of a single enterprise. See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 771-72, 81 L. Ed. 2d 
628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984)."

20 (website stating that Daimler Canada makes ""large-scale shipments to the United States"" and ""continues to supply North 
America and the world with well-known products"")."
1764,8," In most cases, personal jurisdiction attaches because items are put directly into forums' streams of commerce. In this case, the 
focus of the complaint is that items are withheld. Although companies can withhold items to avoid being subject to jurisdiction, cf. 
Burger King, 471 U.S. at 472 (citing World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 297); Lerfald v. Gen. Motors Corp., Ct. File No. CT 03-

toward a forum that is sufficient to sustain specific jurisdiction. "
1765,9," DaimlerChrysler AG is the parent company of DaimlerChrysler North America Holding Corporation. Daimler Motors is a 
subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler North America Holding Corporation, and the parent company of DaimlerChrysler Corporation who 
in turn is the parent company of Daimler Canada. Mercedes-Benz Canada and Mercedes-Benz USA are also subsidiaries of 
DaimlerChrysler North America Holding Corporation. I am unclear where Mercedes-Benz of North America falls in the corporate 
structure. "
1767,10," The plaintiffs allege that representatives of the manufacturing defendants attended the 2002 New York Auto Show meeting to

Canadian defendants' representatives (other than CADA) were at the New York meeting. See Maier Aff., Exs. 10, 11. "
1768,1," I grant the motion only because I understand that a 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) appeal does not stay proceedings in ths court, see id., 
and because of these defendants' commitment that if their appeal is unsuccessful they will ""accept the outcome of any rulings 
litigated in this matter…regardless of their participation (or lack thereof) in those proceedings."" Mot. to Amend at 4. I intend to 
hold them to that commitment. But for that commitment, I would not grant the motion, for if they are unsuccessful on their appeal 
and can later relitigate matters resolved while they are pressing their appeal, it would wreak havoc on the progress of this 
complex multidistrict proceeding. "
1778,1," The parties dispute the precise number of letters questioning the '373 patent's validity. Whether the number is two or four, 
however, does not affect our analysis."

shall be deemed to exist even if there is a lapse of coverage of up to two years due to an insured's absence from the state while 
in military service, and up to 90 days in the last five years for any other reason.” (Stats. 2003, ch. 169, § 1.) The effect and 
validity of this amendment is being challenged in other proceedings and is not before us. Our references to section 1861.02, 
subdivision (c) are to the statute before amendment. "
1800,2," The UCL states that “[u]nless otherwise expressly provided, the remedies or penalties provided by this [law] are cumulative to 
each other and to the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.” (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17205, italics 
added.) Nothing in sections 1860.1 or 1860.2 or Proposition 103 expressly provides otherwise. "
1801,3," In 1987, the McBride Act was amended to permit an aggrieved person to file a complaint directly with the commissioner. 
(Stats. 1987, ch. 1289, § 1, pp. 4611–4612.) "
1805,4," Plaintiff's September 17, 2001 letter to the Insurance Commissioner sought the commissioner's input on the parties' dispute 
under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and also requested that the commissioner treat the letter as a complaint under the formal 
administrative process (§§ 1858–1858.7). The commissioner decided not to reach the merits of the dispute but to promulgate 
regulations instead. In doing so, it appears that the commissioner chose not to review the matter administratively. (See §§ 1858–
1858.02, 1858.1, 1858.2, 1858.3 [describing steps in administrative process].) "
1809,5," Mercury argues that its conduct was protected under the “safe harbor” doctrine (see  Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los 
Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20 Cal.4th 163, 182 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 973 P.2d 527]) because the Insurance 
Commissioner approved its use of the absence of prior insurance as a rating criterion. As stated, we will not resolve that factual 
issue at the pleading stage.  We therefore do not reach Mercury’s “safe harbor” argument. "
1816,1, Craftsmen voluntarily dismissed or settled with all defendants but Ford and American Coach.
1816,2," Craftsmen also relied upon testing Ford had conducted on its base vehicles to verify the safety of components that were not 
altered during the conversion process, such as door locks. "
1817,3," To assist those coachbuilders wanting to safely go beyond the QVM guidelines, Ford provided the names of engineering firms 
that did testing or analysis. T1461."
1817,4, The record indicates that more than ninety percent of Craftsmen's conversions were over 120 inches. 
1818,5," The National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration safety compliance engineer who inspected the brake systems 
on Craftsmen's vehicles concluded: ""It appears Craftsmen exercised caution during vehicle production by following Ford's QVM 
guidelines for limousine manufacturers and sound manufacturing processes for all other vehicles. Therefore, Craftsmen's 
limousines may meet the performance requirements of [the federal safety standard pertaining to hydraulic brakes], but there is 
no test data to form definite conclusions."" (App. at 2320.)"
1818,6," The only test reports LIMO submitted to the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration were in regard to the 
safety of limousine hydraulic brake systems. "
1819,7," In 1997, two new magazines entered the limousine publications market, Dealer's National Limousine Exchange and 
International Limousine and Livery Trader. At trial, Haswell testified that these two publications were not comparable to 
Limousine Digest or Limousine & Chauffeured Magazine, as neither provided national exposure."
1819,8," Although Craftsmen was allowed to attend Limousine Digest's 1996 trade show, which took place before Limousine Digest 
adopted its formal ban, Craftsmen received unfavorable treatment: it was relegated to an obscure location behind a curtain; it 
was required to remove its display car from the show room after only one night of the three-night show; and it was not allowed to 
distribute brochures."
1819,9," At trial, Ric Cohen testified that Limousine Digest's policy allowed nonQVM/CMC coachbuilders to advertise if they presented 
independent proof of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards compliance. (Tr. 1285.) Ultra Limousine, a nonQVM coachbuilder, "
1820,," provided Limousine Digest with independent crash-testing data and subsequently advertised a non-QVM limousine in the 
publication. Ultra agreed to share its crash-testing data with Craftsmen in exchange for $ 35,000, half the crash-testing cost. 
Robert Haswell testified that he declined Ultra's offer, because crash-testing was not required for Craftsmen to meet National 
Highway Transportation and Safety Administration standards. The record contains a memorandum written by a National 
Highway Transportation and Safety Administration safety compliance engineer indicating that the National Highway 
Transportation and Safety Administration did not require Craftsmen to crash-test its limousines due to their weight. (App. at 
2317)."
1820,10," During cross examination, Tortora testified that when Vinnie Bergman, a non-QVM coachbuilder, tried to join LIMO, Ford 
spoke out loudly against it. Despite Ford's Protest, LIMO extended membership to Bergman. Defendants claim that they did not 
want Bergman in LIMO, because he had a reputation for dishonesty and engaged in questionable business practices. "
1821,11," The record suggests that by 1998, Craftsmen began converting sport utility vehicles and buses to mitigate its damages. One 
of the sport utility vehicles Craftsmen converted was Ford's Lincoln Navigator. Limousine & Chauffeured Magazine allowed 
Craftsmen to advertise the stretched Navigators until Ford barred QVM dealers from converting Navigators."
1821,12," Cole used the term ""cost of sales"" to reflect Craftsmen's operating expenses. He testified that he needed a calculation to 
derive an average growth profit percentage ""so that sales that we didn't realize in the future wouldn't have been all profit. They 
would have been a percentage, because there's obviously a cost associated with those sales. So, we had to come up with the 
average growth profit percentage in order to apply it to the sales that were lost in order to get a lost profit number."" Ap. 1773-74 
Cole testified that he calculated a figure of 83.75% as the ""average cost of sales as compared to gross sales for the period '95 
through '98."" Id. "
1822,13," Tortora testified that Ford sometimes took part in LIMO meeting discussions on how to keep non-QVM coachbuilders from 
advertising and attending trade shows, and that Ford expressly forbade her from dealing with non-QVM coachbuilders. (Tr. 376.) "
1824,14," The dissent in footnote 3 glosses over a fundamental question that must precede application of the per se analysis-whether 
Ford is a horizontal competitor of the coachbuilders. Ford does not manufacture or sell limousines. It manufactures base 
vehicles that are later converted into limousines by coachbuilders. Aside from safety and liability concerns, we question whether 
there are any rational economic reasons for Ford to compete with any of the coachbuilders. Unlike the dissent, we also question 
whether Ford's position in the market as a supplier of base vehicles to coachbuilders changed with the formation of QVM and 
LIMO. "
1825,15," The dissent makes the case for why Ford's safety concerns were a pretext for anti-competitive behavior. However, it ignores 
countervailing evidence that the Federal Government encouraged Ford to develop testing to ensure that converted limousines 
complied with federal safety standards. The evidence presented at trial created a legitimate fact dispute that the jury should have 
analyzed under the rule of reason rather than the per se rule, which presumes that Ford's motives and the effect of its actions 
were anti-competitive. "
1826,16," We are not foreclosing the possibility Cole can testify at a new trial. We agree he is qualified. He will have to formulate a new 
opinion using the proper standard under a rule of reason analysis."
1826,17," The boycott agreement and resulting advertising restriction were documented in: 1) the April 30, 1996, LIMO minutes that set 
out the boycott agreement (J.A. 02091-92); 2) the May 6, 1996, letter from LIMO to the magazine that threatened the boycott 
(J.A. 02093-94); and 3) the May 9, 1996, fax from the president of LIMO to his fellow members congratulating them on the 
magazine's change of policy to ban advertisements of non-QVM/CMC coachbuilders (J.A. 02085). "
1827,18," The district court decided the parties' motions for and against application of the per se rule from the bench at the close of the 
Plaintiff's evidence and did not give a rationale for why application of that rule was appropriate. (Tr. 1431-32.)"
1827,19," I submit that there should be little doubt as to the existence of a horizontal agreement between the Defendants. Ford, a 
member of LIMO, had obviously involved itself in the manufacturing of limousines. Furthermore, the majority was correct to 
identify the existence of a conspiracy among the Defendants. I would only add that in addition to the evidence highlighted by the 
majority, the following evidence also supports that Ford influenced LIMO's agenda and spearheaded the boycott effort: 1) Ford 
encouraged the formation of LIMO around the time QVM began (Tr. 275); 2) Ford lobbied to keep non-QVM members out of 
LIMO (Tr. 28990 ); 3) Ford voiced its opposition to allowing QVM members to advertise in trade journals that allowed non-QVM 
members to advertise (Tr. 347); 4) the magazines themselves seemed to be receiving similar pressure directly from Ford (Tr. 
332-35); and 5) Ford pressured LIMO coachbuilders to make them keep non-QVM members out of LIMO because ""[Ford] felt it 
was better coming from [LIMO] as an organization."" (Tr. 282.) "
1828,20," Neither Defendant advocated, or discussed, the application of the ""quick look"" standard, and it is not appropriate in any event 
because, in my view, the restraint is obviously anticompetitive. "
1831,1," The Defendant filed the Motion to Dismiss attacking the Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint. Subsequent to the filing of the 
Motion to Dismiss the Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint adding Plaintiffs Medtronic, Inc. and Medtronic USA, Inc. to 
the Complaint but only as to the patent infringement claim in Count Four. Since the Second Amended Complaint does not make 
any changes to Counts One through Three the Court will analyze the Motion to Dismiss as attacking Counts One through Three 
of the Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint. "
1853,1," See Rec. Doc. No. 10. On April 3, 2002, Lucent filed a motion pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) seeking dismissal of 
plaintiff's Lanham Act claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and seeking dismissal pursuant to Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1)and (3) of all of plaintiff's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on incomplete diversity and 
improper venue. See Rec. Doc. No. 4. On May 10, 2002, the Trustee filed an amended complaint omitting an allegation of diversity jurisdiction and, instead, asserting 
jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1334 because this proceeding is related to a bankruptcy proceeding pending in the Eastern 
District of Louisiana. Rec. Doc. No. 8, P 1. In the alternative, plaintiff alleged that federal jurisdiction existed pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. §§ 1331 and1367 on the basis of federal question and supplemental jurisdiction. See id. In response to the amended complaint, Lucent filed a second motion to dismiss which is presently before the Court. The instant 
motion to dismiss reasserts the arguments raised in its first motion to dismiss. However, in the present motion, Lucent contends 
that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction due to a lack of a federal question because the Trustee's Lanham Act claim fails to 
state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Rec. Doc. No. 10, at 9. Combined with the motion to dismiss are motions to 
refer this action to the bankruptcy court and to strike the jury demand. See id. After a status conference with counsel for the parties, this Court dismissed without prejudice Lucent's first motion to dismiss and 
incorporated defendant's memorandum with respect to that motion into the present, broader motion to dismiss because the relief 
sought in the two motions is duplicative. See Rec. Doc. No. 50, minute entry dated January 29, 2003, at 1. The Court stated that 
the motion to dismiss plaintiff's Lanham Act claim would be treated as a motion brought pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b). Id. 
Additionally, the Court noted that to the extent that Lucent's second motion seeks dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
and improper venue, seeks to enforce the court's general order of reference to the Bankruptcy Court, and seeks to strike the jury 
demand, the motion would be treated as a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 so that the Court could 
consider the parties' extra-pleading evidentiary submissions. See id. at 2. Finally, the Court clarified that Lucent's motion for 
summary judgment on the applicability of dispute resolution provisions (Rec. Doc. No. 46) would be treated as a supplemental 
memorandum in support of the motion for summary judgment rather than a separate motion for relief. Id. HN1[
] A motion for summary judgment is not the proper procedural vehicle to rely upon when determining whether venue is 
proper pursuant to a forum selection clause. See Hanson Eng'rs Inc. v. UNECO, 64 F. Supp. 2d 797, 799 (C.D.Ill. 1999); 
Kessmann & Assocs. v. Barton-Aschman Assocs., 10 F. Supp. 2d 682, 688-89 (S.D.Tex.1999). Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b), whenever matters outside the pleadings are considered by a district court on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), such motion ""shall be treated as one for summary judgment 
and disposed of as provided in Rule 56."" There is no parallel requirement for motions brought under either Rule 12(b)(1)(lack of 
subject matter jurisdiction) or 12(b)(3)(improper venue). See Hanson, 64 F. Supp.2d at 799; Kessmann, 10 F. Supp.2d at 688. "
1854,," The reason for the exclusion of the other defenses listed in the subdivision is fairly clear. There never has been any serious 
doubt as to the availability of extra-pleading material on these motions. Moreover, the other Rule 12(b) defenses only 
challenge the propriety of the court adjudicating the claim before it and do not reach the validity of the claim itself. Since a 
motion for summary judgment is designed to test the merits of the claim, the defenses enumerated in Rule 12(b)(1) through 
Rule 12(b)(5) and Rule 12(b)(7) generally are not proper for motions for summary judgment. Kessmann, 10 F. Supp.2d at 688-89 (quoting 5A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND 
PROCEDURE § 1366, at 485 (2d Ed. 1990)); accord R.A. Argueta v. Banco Mexicano, S.A., 87 F.3d 320, 324 (9th Cir 
1996)(""HN2[
] Analysis under Rule 12(b)(3) … permits the district court to consider facts outside of the pleadings, and is consistent with the Supreme Court standard for resolving forum selection clause cases.""). Accordingly, for purposes of this 
motion, this Court may consider evidence outside the pleadings which has been submitted by the parties in ruling on defendant's 
motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and improper venue without treating the motion as one brought under 
Rule 56. Similarly, this Court may consider extra-pleading material with respect to Lucent's motion to strike the jury demand 
without proceeding pursuant to Rule 56. See e.g., Westside-Marrero Jeep Eagle, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp. Inc., 56 F. Supp.2d 694, 
705-09 (E.D.La. 1999)(considering extra-pleading material in a motion to enforce a contractual jury waiver). Finally, because the 
motion to refer this action to the bankruptcy court does not go to the merits of the claims alleged, the summary judgment 
procedure is not appropriate with respect to that claim."

1858,29," See Am. Comp. P 19. Neither party has submitted the September 22, 1999, promissory note or financing agreement to this 
Court in connection with the pending motions. "
1859,30," Alternatively, in post-hearing submissions to the Court, the Trustee argues for the first time that Lucent has waived its 
objection to venue by filing a motion for partial summary judgment in this Court and by removing a protective suit filed by the 
Trustee in New York state court to the federal district court in the Southern District of New York. See Rec. Doc. Nos. 63, 
plaintiff's supplemental memorandum pursuant to minute entry, at 23-24; 160, plaintiff's supplemental memorandum in 
opposition to Lucent's motion to dismiss. Because of the Court's disposition of this motion, the Court does not reach these 
alternative arguments. "
1860,31," This Court's research revealed no case in which the Fifth Circuit held that federal law applies to the enforceability 
determination where jurisdiction exists by virtue of 28 U.S.C. § 1334. In view of Haynsworth, this Court, by analogy, is 
comfortable finding that federal law governs the enforceability determination in this case."
1860,32," The Trustee asserts that the construction and interpretation of the forum selection clause is governed by New York state law 
pursuant to the choice of law provision in the 2000 Agreement. That provision provides in pertinent part: This Agreement and all acts and transactions hereunder and all rights and obligations of Lender and Borrower hereunder 
shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York."
1860,2000," Agreement, § 9.12. Lucent does not contest the application of New York contract interpretation principles to the 2000 
Agreement. It is unclear whether the Trustee is relying on New York state law contract interpretation principles solely in support of the 
argument that repayment of the funds advanced pursuant to the 2000 Agreement terminated the agreement or whether he relies 
on those interpretive principles with respect to an analysis of the scope of the forum selection clause. It is unclear because "
1861,," notwithstanding the recitation of New York state law, the Trustee relies primarily on federal law in support of his argument that 
the claims alleged in the complaint do not fall within the scope of the forum selection clause. In doing so, the Trustee has waived 
reliance on New York state contract interpretation with respect to this Court's determination of the scope of the forum selection 
clause. See Hanson, 64 F. Supp.2d at 799(""HN12[
] Even where a contract does contain an explicit choice of law provision, 
parties waive reliance on that provision if they rely on federal law in their argument to the Court."")(citing Polar Mfg. Corp. v. 
Michael Weinig, Inc., 994 F. Supp. 1012, 1014-15 (E.D.Wis. 1998). In any event, the Trustee does not rely on any interpretive principles unique to New York. HN13[
] Pursuant to both New York 
and federal law governing the interpretation of contracts, a contract that is unambiguous on its face is construed without 
considering extrinsic evidence. See Reliant Energy Servs. v. Enron Can. Corp., 349 F.3d 816, 822 (5th Cir. 2003)(applying 
federal common law)(""When a contract is expressed in unambiguous language, its terms will be given their plain meaning and 
will be enforced as written."")(citing Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's London v. C.A. Turner Constr. Co., 112 F.3d 184, 186 (5th 
Cir. 1997)); Carpenters Amended and Restated Health Benefit Fund v. Holleman Constr. Co., 751 F.2d 763, 765 (5th Cir. 
1985)(pursuant to federal common law applicable to labor contracts, extrinsic evidence is considered to clarify an ambiguity only 
if an ambiguity cannot be resolved by first construing the entire document); Bruni v. County of Otsego, 192 A.D.2d 939, 596 
N.Y.S.2d 888, 890 (N.Y.App.Div. 1993)(pursuant to New York law, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to create an ambiguity or 
vary the terms of an unambiguous contract)."
1861,33," Although the issue in Vermont Pure was the applicability of an arbitration clause rather than a forum selection clause, the 
construction of the terms ""arising out of"" and ""related to"" in that case are equally applicable in the context of the interpretation of 
a forum selection clause. HN15[
] Both the United States Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have noted the similarities 
between arbitration clauses and forum selection clauses and have applied the same enforceability analysis to both because an 
arbitration clause is, ""in effect, a specialized kind of forum-selection clause that posits not only the situs of suit but also the 
procedure to be used in resolving the dispute."" Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 519, 94 S. Ct. 2449, 2457, 41 L. Ed. 
2d 270 (1974); Haynsworth, 121 F.3d at 963 (rejecting the distinction between arbitration clauses and forum selection clauses 
for purposes of analyzing the enforceability of a forum selection clause). "
1862,34," Although this Court's inquiry is broader than whether the Trustee's claims ""arise out of"" the 2000 Agreement, the inquiry is not 
without bounds because the language used by the parties in the 2000 Agreement is not the broadest possible language which 
could have been used. For example, the court in Nova Ribbon Prods. v. Lincoln Ribbon, Inc., 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13123, 
1992 WL 211544 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 24, 1992), considered a forum selection clause which covered ""all and any matters connected in 
any way, directly or indirectly, with this Agreement and/or over all matters relating to the legal relations between the parties, 
whether these matters precede this Agreement, arise out of it or post date it."" 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13123, [WL] at *2 
(emphasis supplied). In that case, the district court noted that the clause ""was written broadly to encompass all legal relations, 
not just the terms of the particular Agreement."" 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13123, [WL] at *6. "
1864,35," The Trustee also urges the Court to follow Imation Corp. v. Quantum Corp., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4034, 2002 WL 385550 (D. 
Minn. March 8, 2002). The Trustee's reliance on that case is misplaced. In that case, the plaintiff and defendant entered into a 
licensing agreement which contained a forum selection clause requiring ""all disputes arising hereunder"" to be litigated in a 
contractually selected forum. Id. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Quantum and other defendants alleging various antitrust 
violations. Id. The court held that the antitrust allegations did not fall within the scope of the forum selection clause applying any 
of the three tests discussed by the Eighth Circuit in Terra Int'l. 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4034, [WL] at *5. However, at the outset of 
its analysis, the Imation court framed the issue as ""whether Imation's antitrust allegations are 'disputes arising hereunder,'"" and 
specifically noted that ""the clause is not worded as broadly as some forum selection clauses."" 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4034, [WL] 
at *4. As discussed above, the wording of the clause in this case is broader than that considered in Imation. This Court's analysis 
proceeds by reference to the specific wording of the clause at issue and, therefore, cases construing more narrowly worded 
clauses are not persuasive. "
1865,36," In Terra Int'l, Inc. v. Mississippi Chem. Corp., 922 F. Supp. 1334 (N.D.Iowa 1996) aff'd by Terra Int'l, 119 F.3d at 688, the 
district court set forth an exhaustive analysis of the caselaw with respect to the scope of a forum selection clause. See id. at 
1377-81. Reviewing the approaches taken by various circuits, the court noted: "
1866,," HN20[
] [The] consideration of the relationship between the claims and the contractual relationship of the parties is 
apparent whether the court poses the question in a particular case in terms of whether the non-contract claims ""involve the 
same operative facts as a parallel claim for breach of contract,"" Lambert, 983 F.2d at 1121-22, whether ""resolution of the 
[non-contract] claims relates to interpretation of the contract,"" Manetti-Farrow, 858 F.2d at 514, or whether the non-contract 
claims ""ultimately depend on the existence of a contractual relationship."" Coastal Steel, 709 F.2d at 203. Indeed, in Manetti-
Farrow, the court also cast its statement of the test in terms very similar to those proffered by this court, asking whether ""the 
alleged conduct … is so closely related to the contractual relationship that the forum selection clause applies."" Manetti-

remained in effect, the Trustee's claims would nevertheless fall outside the scope of the relationship and transaction embodied in

Lucent waived its reliance on the forum selection clause."
1869,53," Lucent also refers to a waiver of jury trial in a subsequent loan and security agreement entered into by the parties. This 
agreement, however, is in no way related to the instant lawsuit. Therefore, analysis of that agreement is not undertaken by the

defendant to prove whether a waiver of a right to a jury trial was knowing and voluntary. See Westside-Marrero, 56 F. Supp.2d at 
707. This Court need not reach that issue because there is no dispute in this case with respect to whether the waiver was

remedy for violations of the [Lanham Act]?; (2) the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury; (3) the proximity or remoteness of the party to the alleged injurious 
conduct; (4) the speculativeness of the damages claim; and (5) the risk of duplicative damages or complexity in 
apportioning damages. Procter & Gamble, 242 F.3d at 563."
1877,66," Curiously, the Trustee's sole argument in support of his Lanham Act claim is that the Trustee has prudential standing to assert 
it. The Trustee's various oppositions completely fail to address Lucent's distinct contention that the allegations in the complaint 
fail to state a claim for actionable misrepresentations pursuant to § 43(a)(1)(B). However, the Court addresses the Trustee's 
argument to the extent that it bears on the merits of the complaint."
1877,67," HN41[

relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant to have standing to bring a Lanham Act claim. See Telecom Int'l America,

to have standing for a false advertising claim, the plaintiff must be a competitor of the defendant and allege a competitive 
injury."")(citing Waits, 978 F.2d at 1109)(internal citation omitted). In Conte Bros., the Third Circuit rejected the proposition that only direct competitors or surrogates for direct competitors have 
standing to assert a Lanham Act claim. Conte Bros., 165 F.3d at 231 (noting that ""parties who are not in direct competition 
(because they are 'doing business on different economic levels') nevertheless may have standing to sue if they have a 
'reasonable interest to be protected against false advertising'""). The Trustee argues that because the Fifth Circuit adopted the 
prudential standing test from the Conte Bros. decision, the Fifth Circuit has implicitly rejected any requirement that a plaintiff and 
defendant be competitors. Significantly, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has not adopted the Gordon & Breach test for "
1878,," determining whether representations constitute ""commercial advertising or promotion."" Accordingly, the dicta in Conte, on which 
the Fifth Circuit did not rely to adopt the prudential standing test, is not persuasive in light of Seven-Up which is binding circuit

the supplier Bio-Rad's inquiry as to separate pricing as follows: Although I will gladly provide you with the current per-thermal cycler terms for authorization rights under the PCR process 
patents only or license rights under the apparatus patents only, I believe this can be handled contractually at the time it 
becomes necessary. [Applera]'s position will be that for thermal cyclers which we agree do not need a license under the 
identified apparatus patent rights, the per-thermal cycler authorization rate for the process rights will be the rate [Applera] is 
charging for those rights only. Similarly, for thermal cyclers which Perkin-Elmer agrees do not need an authorization under 
the process rights, the per thermal cycler rates for a license under the apparatus patents will be the rate Perkin-Elmer is 
then charging for those rights only. Letter of Hanna Fischer to Sanford Wadler, BIO-RAD Laboratories, Sept. 12, 1996 [Doc. # 470, Ex. 69]. "

1963,3," Sam's cites Beville v. Curry, 2001 OK 1, 39 P.3d 754, 761 (Okla. 2001), for the proposition that, for a plaintiff to show a 
lessening of competition, it must show that the defendant had sufficient market power. Beville was a suit alleging an attempt to 
monopolize under the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act (OARA), Okla. Stat. tit. 79, §§ 201-212, not the OUSA. HN13[
] The OARA is Oklahoma's version of the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7, 12-27, and is interpreted in 
accordance with federal antitrust law. Okla. Stat. tit. 79, § 212. HN14[
] There is no federal counterpart to the OUSA, and 
federal antitrust law is not authoritative in its interpretation. HN15[
] This distinction between the two Oklahoma statutes is important because an attempted monopolization claim requires 
not only anti-competitive conduct, but that the defendant have sufficient market power such that there is a ""'dangerous 
probability' that an attempt to achieve monopoly power will succeed."" Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 
509 U.S. 209, 251, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993); see also Beville, 2001 OK 1, 39 P.3d 754 at 760-61. When the 
anticompetitive conduct at issue is below-cost selling, the plaintiff must show that there is a dangerous probability that the 
defendant will recoup any losses it sustained in selling below cost. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 
574, 588-89, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986); United States v. AMR Corp., 335 F.3d 1109, 1115 (10th Cir. 2003). The purpose of the OUSA, however, is simply to prevent loss leader selling and to protect small businesses. Whether a 
defendant, in the future, may recoup its losses is irrelevant. Thus, under the OUSA, a defendant's market power is not at issue; 
rather, the inquiry is limited to the defendant's intent, and whether competitors (or customers) have been injured. "
1965,4," Sam's claims that because the district court, upon receipt of Dr. Jadlow and Alan Wilkerson's testimony, said that the issue of 
substantial lessening of competition ""[has] been put in play,"" Sam's had successfully rebutted the presumption. Aplt. Br. at 42 
(quoting I Aplt. App. at 357-58). However, upon considering the totality of the evidence, the district court found Sam's rebuttal 
testimony ""wanting."" Star Fuel, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4545, 2003 WL 742191, at *14. This finding, and the rejection of Sam's

aimed at blocking plaintiffs' ability to supplement the record. Shortly thereafter, the parties amicably resolved their dispute 
without the need for a hearing. Although plaintiffs again raise questions, in supplemental submissions, requested by the Court, 
about the adequacy of certain defendants' productions, and defendants again hotly contest any deficiencies, plaintiffs and 
defendants agree that their dispute should not affect the timing of the summary judgment decision. Therefore, although unaware 
of the substance of plaintiffs' and defendants' discussions and resolutions concerning productions, the Court will proceed under 
the assumption that these percentages apply to all defendants. "
1983,6," Defendants expend considerable time and effort arguing that plaintiffs are barred by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine from 
introducing evidence of defendants' alleged evasion of Article 11. HN11[
] The Noerr-Pennington doctrine, however, does not 
protect conspiracies so defendants may evade the law, but rather, conspiracies so defendants may change the law. See Eastern 
Railroad Presidents Conference, et al. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 136-37, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 (1961) 
(""We think it equally clear that the Sherman Act does not prohibit two or more persons from associating together in an attempt to 
persuade the legislature or the executive to take particular action with respect to a law that would produce a restraint or a 
monopoly. Although such associations could perhaps, through a process of expansive construction, be brought within the 
general proscription of 'combinations…in restraint of trade,' they bear very little if any resemblance to the combinations normally 
held violative of the Sherman Act, combinations ordinarily characterized by an express or implied agreement or understanding 
that the participants will jointly give up their trade freedom, or help one another to take away the trade freedom of others through 
the use of such devices as price-fixing agreements, boycotts, market-division agreements, and other similar arrangements."")

intended to eliminate competition. Such conduct is not illegal, either standing alone or as part of a broader scheme itself violative 
of the Sherman Act.""). To the extent that plaintiffs have any intention of introducing evidence of defendants' joint efforts to ""seek 
legislation"" by, for example, lobbying to amend or revoke Article 11, which this Court has no reason to believe they do, such 
evidence will be barred by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. In other words, while any efforts that defendants undertook to 
influence the DCA are protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, defendants' joint efforts to avoid the DCA's enforcement are 
not shielded."

1983,8," Although the parties dispute whether defendants are employment agencies (subject to Article 11) or management agencies 
(permitted to exceed the ten percent cap), this Court does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate this substantive disagreement. See 
Masters, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 698, at *29-32 (the statute's legislative scheme provides for exclusive enforcement (in New York 
City) by the Department of Consumer Affairs (""DCA"")). Though not controlling, it is interesting to note that on April 11, 2003, after 
this Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to determine whether defendants were in violation of Article 11, the DCA determined that 
""…we are unpersuaded by your [plaintiffs'] contention that model management companies…meet the New York General 
Business Law (""GBL"") § 171 definition of an 'employment agency.' Instead, every indication is that these types of companies fall 
under the theatrical managers exception of GBL § 171(8). This is because they are primarily career managers and only "
1984,," 'incidentally' do job placements for their clients."" After plaintiffs proffered additional evidence, the DCA concluded that ""…we

1984,10," Quite notably, Elite's suit alleged (almost identically to plaintiffs' current action) that Ford, Wilhelmina, and other IMMA 
members ""had agreed to increase their rates and adopt a uniform price structure and circumvent the licensing requirements of 
the New York General Business Law."" Pl. Opp. at 15, citing Pl. Exhs. 7-10 (Court Documents). John Casablancas, Elite's 
founder, was even quoted as stating that he was contemplating an antitrust class action on behalf of the models. It appears that 
Elite abandoned the action, and instead joined IMMA."
1984,11," Whether Casablancas learned about the other defendants' pricing practices from clients or from discussions with defendants 
will be for the jury to decide. "
1985,12," Pillard's testimony that she ""decided it was best not to show the letter"" (Pl. Exh. 288 (Pillard Dep.) at 61:8-62:2) at best, 
creates an issue of fact as to whether Pillard did in fact follow Casablancas' instructions. "
1987,13," Defendants rightly assert that form contracts are efficiency-enhancing tools that do not violate antitrust law when the use of 
the form contract is voluntary and the rate or fee is left blank. See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Antitrust Division, Business Review 
Letter 02-7 (Nov. 15, 2002)."
1987,14," Defendants argue that plaintiffs, in opposing summary judgment, may not rely on internal Elite memoranda, summarizing 
IMMA meetings, which have yet to be authenticated, as the non-movant may only rely on ""such facts as would be admissible in 
evidence."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). While defendants are correct as to Rule 56(e)'s requirement on admissibility, I have no reason 
to believe that these memoranda are inherently inadmissible, and instead find, based on the arguments presented at this stage, 
that plaintiffs may, for example, authenticate these documents as business records pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence (""Fed. 
R. Evid."") 803(6). "
1988,15," Notably, at an IMMA meeting on January 21, 1980, ""all members were very much in favor of instituting"" ""an agreement among

1989,16," I find plaintiffs' reliance on Fed. R. Evid. 404, as the basis for which to allow evidence of collateral agreements to establish a 
conspiracy on models' commissions, to be inapposite. Rule 404, as an evidentiary rule, pertains to the admissibility of evidence, 
not to the sufficiency of evidence on a summary judgment motion in an antitrust case."

2019,2," Plaintiffs originally moved for permission to amend their amended complaint in Dkt. # 36. However, plaintiffs filed an ""amended"" 
motion for permission to file a second amended complaint (Dkt. # 43), which was meant to replace Dkt. # 36 in its entirety. There 
were no substantive differences between the motions. Plaintiffs' first motion to amend (Dkt. # 36) is deemed withdrawn."
2019,3," For ease of reference, the singular ""plaintiff"" or ""ADI"" will be used to refer to ADI and Patterson."
2019,4," At the time, MANY operated under the name Finger Lakes Long Term Care Insurance Company."
2019,5," The six-county Rochester Region in New York is comprised of Wayne, Monroe, Livingston, Ontario, Yates, and Seneca 
counties. "
2021,6," A Donnelly Act claim generally is construed in accordance with the Sherman Act. Therefore, the analysis discussed below 
applies equally to plaintiff's state and federal antitrust claims. See Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Abrams, 71 N.Y.2d 327, 335, 520 
N.E.2d 535, 525 N.Y.S.2d 816 (1988). "

party cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the court may refuse the 
application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or 
discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just. "

2035,3," Several versions of this bill were introduced, and it was originally entitled the ""Universal Tobacco Settlement Act."" We have 
cited to the May 15, 1998 version available on Lexis. "
2042,1," Plaintiffs originally alleged that Black Hawk would frequently perform construction on both Highways as well as detour traffic off 
the highways in an effort to deter prospective customers from reaching Central City. (Id. PP 56, 57.) Plaintiffs also originally 
alleged that Black Hawk's Las Vegas-style casinos violate the Eighteenth Amendment to Colorado's Constitution, which provides "
2043,," that the purpose of limited gaming is to promote the historic preservation of the gambling towns. (Id. PP 38-50) (citing COLO. 
CONST. art. XVIII, § 9). As a result, it was alleged that Black Hawk's casinos unfairly compete with Central City's casinos, and 
unfairly and illegally undermine Plaintiffs' economic interests. (Id. PP 145-149.) Both the allegations of building illegally large 
casinos or blocking and detouring traffic away from Central City have been dropped by Plaintiffs."
2043,2," Claims that Black Hawk's Las Vegas-style casinos violate the Colorado Constitution have been withdrawn, see n.1, supra, but 
the allegation that Black Hawk's large casinos attract gamblers traveling the highways remains. See discussion of withdrawal at 
8, infra."
2043,3," Plaintiffs allege that Central City is accessible only through Highway 119, which runs directly through Black Hawk, that Black 
Hawk controls access to Central City and its casinos and businesses, and that Black Hawk performs frequent maintenance 
activities and detours which Plaintiffs allege are designed to deter prospective customers from accessing Central City. (Id. PP 
58-61.)"
2043,4," Defendants at this point include several private casinos and associations in Black Hawk, individuals who purchased land from 
Black Hawk's sale of 1% interests in the Thomas mining claims, and individuals who acted as agents of Black Hawk. This last 
category includes claims against Kathryn Eccker, individually and in her official capacity as Mayor of Black Hawk, James 
Maloney, individually and in his official capacity as City Attorney for Black Hawk, and Lynette Hailey, individually and in her 
official capacity as City Manager for Black Hawk, alleging a conspiracy to restrain trade in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 1 relating to 
the land transaction allegedly aimed at blocking construction of the Southern Access Road. Significantly, Plaintiffs did not bring 
any federal antitrust claims against the City of Black Hawk. Moreover, subsequent to the filing of the Second Revised Third 
Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs notified the Court at the Hearing on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, held August 28, 2003, that 
they withdrew their Breach of Contract Claims (ninth and tenth claims) against the City of Black Hawk involving the Emeson and 
IGA agreements, thereby completely removing Black Hawk as a party to this action. (Tr. at 9.) Additionally, as noted below, 
Plaintiffs' claims against David D. Spellman, Haller G. Midcap, and Tom Kerr, individually, and in their official capacity as 
members of the Black Hawk Board of Aldermen, were either dismissed with prejudice or withdrawn with prejudice."
2043,5," Plaintiffs originally alleged that ""Black Hawk has breached and continues to breach its contractual obligations under the 
Emeson agreement."" Claims 9 and 10 for Breach of Contract of the Emeson Settlement Agreement and the IGA, respectively 
were renumbered claims 7 and 8 in the Second Revised Third Amended Complaint after this Court dismissed the original claims 
7 and 8 involving RICO and COCCA, as discussed infra."
2043,6," Plaintiffs' Second Revised Third Amended Complaint contains two errors in the numbering of paragraphs found on pages 18-
20 that affect the numbering from there on. The final paragraph on page 17 is listed as P 90 while the first paragraph on page 18 
is listed as P 93 thereby omitting PP 91, 92. Additionally, the final paragraph on page 19 is listed as P 96, with the first 
paragraph on page 20 listed as P 91 thereby numbering PP 91 and 92 for the first time and repeating PP 93, 94, 95, 96 for the 
second time. This citation is meant to refer to PP 95 and 96 on page 19 and PP 91-94 on page 20. All subsequent citations refer 
to the paragraph numbers as listed in the Second Amended Third Revised Complaint, unless it is noted that the citation falls on 
page 18, 19, 20, 21. "
2044,7, PP 95 and 96 as listed on page 21 of the Second Amended Third Revised Complaint.
2044,8," These claims were withdrawn with prejudice as to David D. Spellman, Haller G. Midcap, Tom Kerr, Kathryn Eccker, James S. 
Maloney, and Lynnette Hailey. As to the remaining Defendants, Plaintiffs simply stated that they were withdrawing these claims, 
without referencing whether the withdrawal was with or without prejudice. I will assume that these claims have been withdrawn 
with prejudice."
2044,9," The fifth and sixth claims were already withdrawn as to certain Defendants; however, this sentence discusses the fact that the 
withdrawal is with prejudice. "
2045,10," All other claims against Speller, Midcap and Kerr had previously been withdrawn or dismissed."
2045,11," Although still included in the Second Revised Third Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs notified the Court of these withdrawals in 
the form of Plaintiffs' submission of a ""Chart of Claims Outstanding,"" as referenced in the transcript of the Hearing on 
Defendants' Motion to Dismiss held on August 28, 2003. (Tr. at 10, II. 15-17.)"
2045,12, The Section 1 claim only relates to the land transactions surrounding the proposed Proland Annexation.
2045,13," There are also three remaining state law claims, the 4th, 5th, and 6th claims, against several Defendants for conspiracy to 
restrain trade, conspiracy to monopolize, and attempted monopolization. Due to the disposition of this case, the Court does not 
address the validity of these state law claims."
2045,14," According to the Second Revised Third Amended Complaint, as of August 2001, of the 14, 231 slot machines registered in 
Colorado, 1,653 were in Central City, roughly 11.6 %, while 8,368, or 58.8 % of registered slot machines were in Black Hawk. 
(SRTAC P142.) Thus in August 2001, Black Hawk had slightly over five times the number of slot machines in operation in 
Central City. "
2047,15," No antitrust claim was ever filed against the City of Black Hawk, and Plaintiffs' ninth and tenth claims alleging a breach of 
contract with regard to the Emeson Settlement Agreement and the IGA have been withdrawn. See Chart of Claims Outstanding, 
tendered to the Court at the August 28, 2003 hearing. "
2048,16," Exhibit F attached to the Second Amended Third Revised Complaint is a copy of an article from the Denver Post from 
Tuesday, February 18, 2003, entitled ""Black Hawk grand jury report ordered released"" by Howard Pankratz. As the article points 
out, the Colorado Court of Appeals ordered the release of the Grand Jury report based on a finding that the publication of the 
report was in the public interest. However, the fact that the release of the report is in the public interest is not the same as a 
finding of misconduct on the part of Black Hawk. Nor are the newspaper's allegations about the content of the report meaningful 
in light of the fact that the Grand Jury did not issue an indictment. Plaintiffs did attach a copy of the Grand Jury report as Exhibit 
G, but as it is under seal its contents will not be referenced to in this opinion."
2048,17, P 95 refers to P95 on page 21 of the Complaint.
2048,18, [ILLEGIBLE FOOTNOTE] 
2050,19," The Plaintiffs also still have available the course of action they chose to pursue with regard to the Emeson property. See n. 13, 
supra. As Plaintiffs concede, ""In the face of the failed Proland annexation, … Central City was required to pursue the alternative 
of selling approximately $ 45 million of municipal bonds to fund construction of the Southern Access Road."" (SRTAC P 126.) "
2051,20," Compounding the problem with Plaintiffs' statistics is the fact that the increase in Defendants' revenue is not a one-to-one 
relationship with Defendants' decrease in revenue. Thus, Central City's revenue declined from $ 82 million in 1996 to $ 56 million 
in 2002, a decline of $ 26 million. Black Hawk, on the other hand, enjoyed an increase in revenue from $ 217 million in 1996 to $ 
510 million in 2002. (SRTAC PP 132-133.) Even assuming that Black Hawk absorbed Central City's $ 26 million decline, Central 
City does not account for the remaining $ 191 million increase in Black Hawk's revenue. Plaintiffs have not provided any 
mechanism for determining the growth rate that would have occurred absent Defendants' allegedly anticompetitive conduct."
2051,21," As note18, supra, indicates, Plaintiffs' reference to Central City's decline in revenues compared with Black Hawk's as being 
reflective of ""the scale of damages sustained by Plaintiffs,"" (SRTAC P 133), is incredibly unqualified and only compounds the 
difficulty of fixing the amount of damages caused by the various Defendants and apportioning them among various Plaintiffs. "
2054,1," At the pre-trial conference, the plaintiffs abandoned their state law claims."
2054,2," A free rider is a retailer who offers little or no services in connection with the sale of merchandise. A consumer obtains 
assistance with the selection of a product from a full-service retailer, then the consumer purchases the product from the free 
rider, who has lower costs and is able to sell the product for a lower price. One of the pro-competitive justifications for resale 
price maintenance is the assurance to the full-service retailer that it will be compensated for providing services at the point of 
sale and promoting the product by a guaranteed margin on the actual sale of the product itself--should the sale occur. Such 
assurance incents the full-service retailer to continue to promote the product."
2054,3," Dr. Elzinga notes that some resale price maintenance schemes are worthy of per se treatment, including those which involve 
concerted action among horizontal market participants. "
2055,4," When the Court decided Atlantic Richfield, vertical agreements to fix maximum prices were still subject to per se treatment. "
