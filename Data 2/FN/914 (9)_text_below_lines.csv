37,1," Defendant Oriental Rug Importers Association (""ORIA"") joined in the instant motions. (Tr. at 4.) (""Tr."" refers to the transcript of 
oral argument on October 16, 2001.). However, neither Bashian Bros., the Etessami Defendants, nor the Newman Defendants 
have briefed the issues with regard to ORIA. For example, this Court notes that no party has briefed the issue of whether the 
illegal actions of ORIA's members may be imputed to ORIA itself, which is distinct from the issue of whether the conduct of 
ORIA's officers may be attributed to their respective companies. See American Society of Mechanical Engineers, Inc. v. 
Hydrolevel Corp., 456 U.S. 556, 570, 72 L. Ed. 2d 330, 102 S. Ct. 1935 (1982) (determining that a professional association could 
be held liable for the actions of its officers and agents taken with apparent authority). Moreover, in the absence of such briefing, 
Plaintiffs have had no opportunity to respond to the contention that ORIA may not be held liable for the actions of its officers. 
Accordingly, this Court will not determine, at this time, whether ORIA is entitled to a grant of summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' 
claims."
37,2," The procedural and factual history of this case, extending back to 1995, has been described at length in the prior opinion of the 
Third Circuit, Carpet Group International v. Oriental Rug Importers Assoc., Inc., 227 F.3d 62 (3d Cir. 2000), and the Reports and 
Recommendations of the Honorable G. Donald Haneke, U.S.M.J., dated February 11, 1998, and June 2, 1998. The facts below 
are extrapolated from these sources."
37,3, Bashian is not a named defendant in this case.
37,4," On January 1, 2000, Etessami & Sons closed its business. The corporate entity still exists, however, in part to collect 
outstanding accounts receivable. (Issac Etessami Decl. P 4.) "
38,5," Defendants Pande Cameron & Co. of New York, Kelaty Rugs International, and Daniel Hodges are not parties to the instant 
motions for summary judgment. "
41,6," Based on the attached letter, one of the Pakistani individuals at the September 29, 1993 meeting was Abu Shamim Ariff, Vice-
Chairman of the EPB--whose governmental status Plaintiffs do not challenge. (Fierst Decl., Ex. 23.) Although the identity of the 
other Pakistani attendee is unclear, to the extent that it constituted lobbying of Pakistani government officials, it is protected by 
the Noerr doctrine."
41,7," See Tr. at 40-41 (""Tr."" refers to the transcript of oral argument in this matter on October 16, 2001.)."
41,8," Defendants also challenge whether the ""PCEM Association,"" copied in the 1992 letter, is identical to the PCMEA. Without 
making a determination on this issue, this Court notes that as of 1997, the PCMEA had an address similar to that listed for the 
PCEM Association in the 1992 letter. For example, the address in the 1992 letter reads: ""First Floor Ali Complex, Empress Rd., 
Lahore, Pakistan."" (Green Decl., Ex. 6 at 3.) In an article listed on the World History Archives, dated June 11, 1997, contact 
information for the PCMEA was listed as: ""Ali Complex, 23 Empress Road, Lahore, Pakistan."" (available at http://www.hartford-
hwp.com/archives/52/012.html.) "
42,9," Additionally, in his certification, T.S. Chadha, the Executive Director and Secretary of the CEPC, states that although the 
council was ""set up by the Ministry of Textiles and the government of India,"" it ""has a membership of more than 2,500 
manufacturers and importers."" (T.S. Chadha Cert. P 1.) "
43,10," Moreover, despite Defendants' assertions to the contrary, they have produced no evidence tending to demonstrate that their 
communications to CEPC and PCMEA--requesting that CEPC not sponsor the November 1993 CGI show and that PCMEA not 
allow their participation in the 1994 Hand-knotted Carpet Exhibition--were at the very least indirect attempts to challenge 
Pakistani policy or laws. Cf. Federal Prescription Service, Inc. v. American Pharmaceutical Asso., 471 F. Supp. 126, 130 (D. 
D.C. 1979) (holding that a professional association's use of private group in publicity campaign was within the scope of Noerr-
Pennington doctrine). "
44,11," The Newman Defendants base their entire motion for summary judgment on a Noerr-Pennington defense. Because this Court 
decides that only Defendants' communications to the EPB and Pakistani Minister of Commerce are entitled to Noerr-Pennington 
immunity, the Newman Defendants' motion for summary judgment is denied. Moreover, because the Newman Defendants do 
not challenge the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' proof of their Sherman Act and tortious interference claims, this Court will not evaluate 
those claims with regard to the Newman Defendants. "
45,12," Plaintiffs purport to authenticate all the evidence produced in support of Defendants' illegal activity. (David Fierst Decl. P 2.) 
Nevertheless, Plaintiffs' evidence is summarized below without an evaluation of its reliability or admissibility with regard to this 
Court's evaluation of the instant motions. To the extent that Plaintiffs rely upon any such evidence to challenge Defendants' 
specific contentions, its admissibility--where contested--is addressed therein."
45,13," Etessami contends that he did not draft or sign the July 23, 1993 letter, or the September 24, 1992 letter also noted above. For 
the purpose of the instant motion, however, Etessami does not challenge that he authorized both letters. (Etessami Mem. at 11 
n. 1.) "
47,14," Hirsch authenticates his notes of the conversation with Joel of Kelaty International, in his Declaration, dated September 3, 
1997. (Fierst Decl., Ex. 72.) "
49,15," For purposes of the instant motions, Bashian Bros. does not dispute the existence of a conspiracy among ORIA members, but 
whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate that Bashian Bros. actively participated in such a conspiracy. (Bashian Bros. Br. at 4.)"
49,16," Of course, to the extent that Plaintiffs' rely upon Bashian's participation in a meeting with Pakistani public officials, such 
communications are protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, and thus may not serve as the basis for antitrust liability. (See 
Pls.' Supp. Opp. at 9-11 and supra note 6.) "
50,17," Plaintiffs do not include, in their excerpt, the initial question posed to Bashian. (Fierst Decl., Ex. 14 at 200.) "
51,18," See, e.g., HN22[
] FED. R. CIV. P. 56(e) (""Supporting and opposing affidavits shall … set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence …); HN23[
] FED. R. EVID. 802 (""Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules …"")."
51,19," Because this Court finds that there is no genuine dispute as to Bashian's active participation in the ORIA conspiracy, it does 
not reach the question of whether Bashian's actions can be imputed to Bashian Bros. See Cape Cod Food Products, Inc. v. 
National Cranberry Ass'n, 119 F. Supp. 900 (D. Mass. 1954) (""The mere fact that an individual is an officer of a corporation does 
not make the corporation liable unless the individual was acting for or on behalf of the corporation at the time of the acting."")."
51,20," Of course, Plaintiffs do not contend that Issac Etessami conspired with Etessami & Sons, as such a contention is not legally 
viable. See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 769, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628, 104 S. Ct. 2731 (1984) HN25[ ] (""It is perfectly plain that an internal ""agreement"" [among officers or employees of the same company] to implement a single, unitary firm's policies does not raise the antitrust dangers that § 1 was designed to police."")."
51,21," Plaintiffs argue that the Third Circuit has already found the existence of a conspiracy in this case, and that ""once a conspiracy 
is proved, the quantum of evidence necessary to prove membership in the conspiracy is lessened."" (Pls.' Mem. in Opp. to 
Etessami Defs. at 4.) However, Plaintiffs have misread the Third Circuit's opinion. To the contrary, the Third Circuit noted that 
the anticompetitive effects of the conspiracy would be obvious ""if the plaintiffs can prove at trial that the alleged conspiracy "
52,," actually exists."" Carpet Group, 227 F.3d at 74. Thus, the Third Circuit did not find, as part of its decision, that a conspiracy 
actually existed."
52,22," This Court does not distinguish ""mere membership"" from officer/managerial positions in determining the proper standard for 
evaluating whether Etessami engaged in concerted activity. To be sure, Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence to suggest 
that rather than simply managing ORIA meetings, Etessami's role as President of ORIA, without more, evinces his active 
participation in any ORIA conspiracy. "
53,23," Of course, the Third Circuit has held that an association, such as ORIA, ""can only be held liable for concerted action if it acted 
as an entity,"" although evidence of an ""official board resolution, or other officially sanctioned activity"" is not required. Alvord-Polk, 
37 F.3d at 1007-08 n. 9. This rule does not, however, apply to a determination of the Etessami Defendants' liability."
53,24," Indeed, the Third Circuit, reviewing the same evidence, remarked: The defendants' conduct complained of … can be characterized as having a pernicious effect on competition and lacks any 
redeeming virtue …. It appears that the refusal to deal here at issue is predominantly anticompetitive. If the plaintiffs can 
prove at trial that the alleged conspiracy actually exists, the anticompetitive effect of such a conspiracy would be 
immediately obvious. There appears to be no reason for the defendants' action other than to protect the 
wholesaler/importer's role in the chain of distribution. Carpet Group, 227 F.3d at 74 (citations omitted)."
53,25," The Etessami Defendants do not challenge the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' proof as to the remaining elements of a section 1 claim, 
such as ""anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets."" See Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1229. 
Regardless, HN28[
] under the ""per se"" standard--which the Third Circuit has directed this Court to apply--activity may 
""engender liability without inquiry into the harm it has actually caused."" Alvord-Polk, 37 F.3d at 1000. "
54,26," Defendants emphasize the Third Circuit's conclusion that HN30[
] ""in the absence of a co-conspirator, an association's 
actions satisfy the concerted action requirement only when taken in a group capacity."" 37 F.3d at 1009. Of course, ORIA's 
liability for the alleged actions of its members is not currently an issue before this Court. See note 1, supra. Moreover, Plaintiffs 
do not allege that Etessami, by himself, conspired with ORIA, but rather that Etessami, along with other ORIA members, 
conspired to undermine Plaintiffs' activities. "
55,27," Because this Court has determined that Etessami's actions as a member of ORIA were performed within the scope of his 
employment, it does not consider whether Etessami's actions were conducted, in the alternative, with the apparent authority of 
Etessami & Sons. See RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY § 219."
55,28," In the instant case, Plaintiffs define the relevant product market as ""the importing and wholesale distribution of Oriental rugs."" 
(Second Amended Compl. P 15.) "
56,29," Plaintiffs' monopolization and attempted monopolization claims comprise Counts II and IV of the Second Amended Complaint. 
(Second Amended Compl. PP 31-32; 36-40.) Count III alleges conspiracy to monopolize. (Id. PP 33-35.) Although not so stated, 
this Court assumes that Bashian Bros. seeks to address Plaintiffs' section 2 conspiracy claim with its discussion of their section 
1 conspiracy claim. Moreover, although Bashian Bros. frames its request in the terms of a dismissal, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6), in its moving brief, this Court will analyze the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations under the summary judgment standard. 
Bashian Bros.' notice of motion, brief title, and suggested standard of review suggest its intent to submit all of its claims as a 
motion for summary judgment. "
57,30," In fact, Plaintiffs acknowledge the interdependency of their claims. With regard to Defendant Etessami, Plaintiffs' attorney 
admitted, ""If I win on the conspiracy claim, I'll win on those other counts. If I don't win on the conspiracy claim, he's right, I have 
nothing specific on Mr. Etessami on these counts. Either he's a member of the conspiracy that monopolizes and attempts to 
monopolize or tortiously interferes or isn't."" (Tr. at 47-48.) "
58,31," Areeda and Hovenkamp explain, HN47[
] ""In some markets no single firm possesses sufficient power to be considered a 
""monopolist,"" but nevertheless a relatively few firms achieve monopoly-like output reductions and prices and thus might be said 
to possess ""shared"" monopoly power … But when oligopolists expressly conspire among themselves to carry on restrictive or 
exclusionary conduct that creates, maintains, or augments shared monopoly power, § 1 of the Sherman Act provides a remedy."" 
Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, P810a (2002). "
59,32," For instance, HN50[
] ""market power is the power to force a purchaser to do something he would not do in a competitive 
market; it has been defined as the ability of a single seller to raise price and restrict output."" Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 464 
(citations omitted). ""Monopoly power,"" similarly, has been defined as ""the power to control prices or exclude competition."" E.I. du 
Pont de Nemours, 351 U.S. at 391."
59,33," Plaintiffs attempt to demonstrate monopoly power--and thereby intent--by proving Defendants' market share. Specifically, 
Plaintiffs aver that ""the members of ORIA cumulatively have a market share in [the importing and wholesale distribution of 
oriental rugs] in excess of 75%."" (Second Amended Compl. P 22.) It is true that monopoly power is often gauged by a "
60,," defendant's share of the relevant market. Pastore v. Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania, 24 F.3d 508, 513 (3d Cir. 1994). 
However, Plaintiffs have not identified any market data, reports, studies or statistics corroborating their allegation that 
Defendants own 75% of the oriental rug market. Indeed, Plaintiffs admit that their hypothesis is based primarily upon Elsea's 
experience in the oriental rug industry. (Pls.' Opp. to Etessami Defs. at 30; Fierst Decl., Ex. 77.) This Court notes that to the 
extent that Elsea seeks to provide his own ""expert"" opinion testimony on this issue, without having followed the parameters of 
the federal rules, it is rejected. Plaintiffs also point to a letter from Hodges, as President of ORIA, to the Vice-President of Iran 
stating that ""our members import the vast majority of handmade rugs into this country."" (Fierst Decl., Ex. 78.) This evidence, 
without more, is insufficient to support a finding of significant market share. See generally Joseph Rossi v. Standard Roof, Inc., 
958 F. Supp. 976, 981 (D.N.J. 1997) (Plaintiffs' bare assertions and conclusory allegations will not suffice to prevent summary 
judgment.)."
60,34," The following evidence supports the Third Circuit findings: the letter from Laufer on ORIA letterhead to Chinese advertising 
account executive, admitting to encouraging retail magazines not to accept ads from manufacturers as ""it could have very 
damaging effects on [importers]."" (Fierst Decl., Ex. 5); the letter from Hodges on ORIA letterhead to Rustigian, head of ORRA, 
stating, ""I think you are well aware of our sentiments regarding the purpose of this trade fair in undermining existing channels of 
distribution which have proven to be successful to all of us over the years."" (Id., Ex. 38); and the letter from Hodges on ORIA 
letterhead, to Carpet-E-World International, a trade publication, in which he warns, ""Our Association will obviously take every 
measure possible to insure the continuation of a long established and successful form of distribution."" (Id., Ex. 60.) "
61,35," Plaintiffs' attempt to rely upon notes from conversations with ORIA members Zarnegian and Durusel, and a Floor Covering 
Weekly (""FCW"") representative to support their allegation of ORIA's market power is misplaced. Plaintiffs have not provided 
testimony from Zarnegian, Durusel or the FCW representative corroborating their alleged conversations with Defendants. Thus, 
like Plaintiffs' notes regarding O'Callaghan from Decorative Rug Magazine, these communications are hearsay, and thus not 
appropriate for this Court's consideration. See discussion supra p. 33. "
81,1," These Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law were originally issued on February 26, 2003 but were filed under seal to 
provide the parties the opportunity to indicate to the Court whether there were portions of these findings that contained 
commercially confidential non-public information that should remain sealed. The papers filed in connection with this case were 
originally filed subject to a protective order and were all filed under seal. Because there are no portions of these Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law that contain information that would justify that information remaining under seal, and the parties having 
pointed to no findings that should remain under seal, the sealing order with respect to the February 26, 2003 Findings of Fact 
and Conclusions of Law is lifted. "

pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution. "
96,*," Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Eight, assigned by the Acting Chief Justice 
pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution. "
97,1," In 1996, Loral changed its name to Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems, Inc., and became a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin 
Corporation, both of which are defendants in the present case. These defendants will collectively be referred to as Lockheed 
Martin, unless otherwise indicated."
97,2," Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Tactical Systems, Inc., and Linda Kim were named as defendants in the 
present action."
97,3," As in Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 121 [96 Cal. Rptr. 2d 485, 999 P.2d 718] (Kraus), we 
refer to Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq., the unfair competition law, as the UCL, and the claim as one for 
unfair competition. "
98,4," Business and Professions Code section 17200 states: HN4[
] ""As used in this chapter, unfair competition shall mean and 
include any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising and any 
act prohibited by Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 17500) of Part 3 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code."" All 
subsequent statutory citations are to the Business and Professions Code, unless otherwise noted."
98,5," The parties did not challenge this ruling and so we accept, without deciding, that a claim under the UCL may be predicted on a 
violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. "
101,6," Our discussion in this case is limited to individual private actions brought under the UCL. In public actions, civil penalties may 
be collected from a defendant. (§ 17206.) Further, in Kraus we noted that the Legislature ""has authorized disgorgement into a 
fluid recovery fund in class actions."" ( Kraus, supra, 23 Cal.4th at p. 137.) These issues are not before us, and therefore we need 
not address them further. "
105,7," The concurring and dissenting opinion argues that we should rely on Seaman's Direct Buying Service, Inc. v. Standard Oil Co. 
(1984) 36 Cal.3d 752 [206 Cal. Rptr. 354, 686 P.2d 1158], overruled on other grounds in Freeman & Mills, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co. 
(1995) 11 Cal.4th 85, 88 [44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669], rather than on Quelimane, supra, 19 Cal.4th 26. Both cases 
discuss the intent requirement for the tort of interference with contract. Yet the Quelimane court did not consider the earlier per 
curiam decision in Seaman's. As we noted in Della Penna, the Seaman's court ""rel[ied] on the first Restatement . . . without 
reviewing or even mentioning intervening revaluations of the tort by the Restatement Second, other state high courts and our 
own Court of Appeal."" ( Della Penna, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 389.) Further, we expressly disapproved of our language in 
Seaman's to the extent that it was inconsistent with Della Penna. (Della Penna, at p. 393, fn. 5.) Thus, we find in Quelimane, 
which relies on Della Penna and the Restatement Second of Torts, a better representation than Seaman's of the current state of 
the law."
105,8," This section states: ""One who intentionally and improperly interferes with another's prospective contractual relation (except a 
contract to marry) is subject to liability to the other for pecuniary harm resulting from loss of the benefits of the relation, whether "
106,," the interference consists of [P] (a) inducing or otherwise causing a third person not to enter into or continue the prospective 
relation or [P] (b) preventing the other from acquiring or continuing the prospective relation."" ( Rest.2d Torts, § 766B, p. 20.)"
106,9," We consider only whether, to state a claim for this tort, a plaintiff need allege that the defendant acted with a specific intent to 
interfere with the plaintiff's business expectancy. A defendant's intent, as defined in section 8A of the Restatement Second of 
Torts, is still a triable issue of fact. (See Quelimane, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 57.) "
107,10," The concurring and dissenting opinion contends that the Buckaloo court made other statements indicating that the two torts 
were mutually exclusive. But it is apparent that each of the statements it quotes in support of this contention, when read in 
context, are merely made in furtherance of Buckaloo's central thesis: that the existence of a contract is not necessary to maintain 
an action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage."
107,11," We need not in this case further define which sources of law can be relied on to determine whether a defendant has engaged 
in an independently wrongful act, other than to say that such an act must be wrongful by some legal measure, rather than merely 
a product of an improper, but lawful, purpose or motive. To the extent that the lower courts have determined otherwise, these 
decisions are disapproved. (See, e.g., PMC, Inc. v. Saban Entertainment, Inc. (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 579, 603 [52 Cal. Rptr. 2d 
877] [stating that liability may arise from either improper motive or improper means].) "
110,12," Contrary to the assertion of the concurring and dissenting opinion, section 767 ""applies to each form of the tort,"" and is 
therefore applicable to both interference with contract and interference with prospective economic advantage. ( Rest.2d Torts, § 
767, com. a, p. 27.)"
110,13," Further, we find federal cases discussing antitrust and RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) law to be 
inapplicable to the question of whether a plaintiff may state a claim under the California common law tort of interference with 
prospective economic advantage. The federal antitrust cases cited by the concurring and dissenting opinion address the 
question of whether the plaintiffs in those cases could maintain standing under section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 15). ( 
Associated General Contractors v. California State Council of Carpenters (1983) 459 U.S. 519, 529 [74 L. Ed. 2d 723, 103 S. Ct. 
897].) To answer this question, these courts engage, inter alia, in an analysis of the statutory language of the Clayton Act, as 
well as its relevant legislative history and objectives.  (459 U.S. at pp. 529-531, 538-540.) The question of whether a plaintiff has 
standing to bring a claim under a California common law tort is not subject to the same considerations and limitations that were 
raised in the Clayton Act and RICO cases. Adopting this federal case law would be a significant departure from our prior cases 
discussing this tort, especially Buckaloo, supra, 14 Cal.3d 815, and Della Penna, supra, 11 Cal.4th 376. Nevertheless, the 
concurring and dissenting opinion points to the Restatement, which states in section 768, comment f, that ""there is therefore 
interplay between [antitrust] law and the law of tortious interference with prospective contractual relations."" The concurring and 
dissenting opinion fails to include the remainder of this sentence, which continues: ""[antitrust] law is so involved and is so 
primarily concerned with areas of public law only tangentially related to tort law that it must be regarded as outside the scope of 
the Restatement of Torts."" ( Rest.2d Torts, § 768, com. c, p. 43, italics added.)"
110,14," We address only plaintiff's allegations as pleaded in its complaint. We express no view as to whether plaintiff's proof will be 
sufficient to establish these elements at trial. "
112,15," As noted above, however, we disagree with the Court of Appeal's determination that, after Della Penna, supra, 11 Cal.4th 376, 
it is no longer appropriate for courts to apply elements of this tort that we first formulated in Buckaloo, supra, 14 Cal.3d 815, with 
the addition of the independent wrongfulness requirement."
112,*," Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Eight, assigned by the Acting Chief Justice 
pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California Constitution. "
114,1," The majority asserts that these statements were ""merely made in furtherance of Buckaloo's central thesis: that the existence of 
a contract is not necessary to maintain an action for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage."" (Maj. opn., 
ante, at p. 1158, fn 10.) What the majority fails to understand, and what the statements I have quoted establish, is that this thesis 
does not, as the majority incorrectly concludes, imply that an action for intentional interference with prospective economic 
advantage may be brought where there is a valid contract. "
115,2," Buckaloo also cited Bernhardt, California Real Estate Transactions (Cont.Ed.Bar 1974 supp.) section 5.81. (Buckaloo, supra, 
14 Cal. 3d at p. 823.) That source did not address the issue or otherwise support Buckaloo's statement. "
116,3," Comment b of section 767 of the Restatement Second makes the same point. In discussing ""the interplay between"" a 
defendant's ""motive"" and ""the nature of [his or her] conduct,"" it states, in equivocal terms, that ""[i]f the conduct is independently 
wrongful . . . the desire to interfere with the other's contractual relations may be less essential to a holding that the interference is 
improper."" (Rest.2d, § 767, com. on cl. b, p. 33, italics added.) "
117,4," As should be clear, I do not, as the majority states, ""assert[]"" that section 767 of the Restatement Second does not apply to 
intentional interference with prospective economic advantage. (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 1163, fn. 12.) What I do assert is that given 
the Restatement Second's caution that ""the weight carried by"" the various factors ""may vary considerably"" with respect to the 
different interference torts (Rest.2d, § 767, com. a, p. 27), the majority errs in simply assuming that comment h's discussion of 
remoteness in the context of interference with contract necessarily applies to the same extent to intentional interference with 
prospective economic advantage. "
118,5," Nor does the passage the majority cites from the concurring opinion in Della Penna (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1163) address 
recovery where the defendant's alleged act of interference is not directed towards the plaintiff or towards anyone with whom the 
plaintiff has an existing or prospective economic relationship. (Della Penna, supra, 11 Cal. 4th at p. 409 (conc. opn. of Mosk, J.).) "
122,6," See also Southwest Suburban Board of Realtors, Inc. v. Beverly Area Planning Assn. (7th Cir. 1987) 830 F.2d 1374, 1378 
(corporate president who may have lost commissions as a result of alleged antitrust violation may not maintain antitrust action, 
because ""[m]erely derivative injuries sustained by employees, officers, stockholders, and creditors of an injured company do not 
constitute 'antitrust injury' sufficient to confer antitrust standing""); Warnick v. Washington Education Association (E.D.Wash. 
1984) 593 F. Supp. 66, 67-69 (commissions that sales agents lost due to the defendant's attempt to restrain trade were 
derivative injury and could not support antitrust claim). "
123,7," The significance of the Restatement Second's discussion is not, as the majority incorrectly suggests (maj. opn., ante, at pp. 
1163-1164, fn. 13), diminished by the Restatement Second's further observation that complete discussion of antitrust law is 
""outside the scope of the Restatement of Torts."" (Rest.2d, § 768, com. f, p. 43.) "
124,8," For similar reasons, the court also held that the distributors' antitrust claim failed as a matter of law. The court explained that 
the distributors' injury was ""derivative of"" the bottling company's injury, and that ""a party in a business relationship with an entity 
that failed as a result of an antitrust violation"" does ""not have standing to bring an antitrust claim."" ( G.K.A. Beverage Corp. v. 
Honickman, supra, 55 F.3d at pp. 766-767.) This rule, the court explained, ""follows naturally"" from the rule that "" '[m]erely "
125,," derivative injuries sustained by employees, officers, stockholders, and creditors of an injured company do not . . . confer antitrust 
standing.' [Citation.]"" ( Id. at p. 766.)"
125,9," Apparently, under New York law, instead of showing wrongful means, a plaintiff may alternatively show that the defendant 
""acted for the sole purpose of inflicting intentional harm on plaintiffs."" ( NBT Bancorp Inc. v. Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc. 
(1995) 215 A.D.2d 990 [628 N.Y.S.2d 408, 410].) This fact does not undermine my conclusion that we should follow New York 
law regarding remoteness. On the contrary, it reinforces my conclusion, because a defendant who acts solely to harm the 
plaintiff is at least as blameworthy as a defendant who uses wrongful means and is only substantially certain that the plaintiff will 
be harmed."
125,10," Notably, in the Court of Appeal, even KSC agreed that federal cases addressing ""standing under the antitrust laws provide 
useful guidance . . . in determining the reach of the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage."" 
Similarly, the law review article on which the majority relies (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1163) states that ""[i]n a business competition 
setting, antitrust laws . . . may serve as a yardstick for liability,"" and it argues for ""[i]ncorporating the fluid doctrines of antitrust "
126,," into an unlawful means test for tortious interference . . . ."" (Perlman, Interference with Contract and Other Economic 
Expectancies: A Clash of Tort and Contract Doctrine, supra, 49 U.Chi. L.Rev. at p. 98, fn. omitted.) "
127,11," The same is true in the case now before us, because KSC's complaint alleges that Lockheed ""intentionally induc[ed]"" the 
Republic of Korea to award the contract to Lockheed ""[i]n order to disrupt"" KSC's relationship with MacDonald. Thus, it is 
unnecessary to decide whether a complaint alleging only substantial certainty adequately states a claim. "
128,12," For example, although the majority states that a defendant's interference ""becomes less certain as . . . the identity of potential 
victims becomes more vague"" (maj. opn., ante, at p. 1165), at least one California court has held that recovery is available as 
long as the plaintiff was "" 'identified [to the defendant] in some manner,' "" even if the defendant did not know ""of the injured 
party's specific identity or name."" ( Ramona Manor Convalescent Hospital v. Care Enterprises (1986) 177 Cal. App. 3d 1120,

209,1," The ""briefs"" and statements of material facts alone exceed 1,000 pages. "
210,2," The parties dispute the exact number of distributors. Santana claims that in the mid-1980s there were ten companies who 
nationally marketed their compartments and about five regional companies. (Pl. Rev. Stat. of Material Facts/Sherman Act, Dkt. 
Entry 382, P 4.) Bobrick, however, contends that in 1990 there were nineteen market players. (Bobrick's Response to Pl. Rev. 
Stat. of Material Facts/Sherman Act, Dkt. Entry 410, P 4.) Either way, the market for toilet compartments involved multiple 
competitors."
210,3," The terms ""toilet compartments"" and ""toilet partitions"" are used interchangeably in this opinion."
210,4," The Sweet's Catalog is a compilation of catalogs of numerous manufacturers of various building products and materials used in 
architectural and engineering fields. Manufacturers pay a fee to place their catalogs and specifications in the Sweet's Catalog. 
(Bobrick's Rev. Stat. of Material Facts, Dkt. Entry 407, P 38.) Architects annually subscribe and routinely refer to the Sweet's 
Catalog before selecting and specifying building and construction products. One section of the Catalog is devoted entirely to 
toilet partitions. (Id., PP 39-40.)"
210,5," Santana's 1986 Sweet's Catalog claimed: There are a number of reasons for Santana's astounding success in the highly competitive industry it entered so recently 
and dominated so quickly. First, of course, is the product. Solid, one-piece construction of polymer resins just about says it 
all: there are simply no seams to come apart. In addition, solid plastic doesn't rust or dent like metal, peel away like plastic 
laminates, or absorb odors like marble. Additionally, POLY-MAR HD(R) has Santana's unique Plasti-Glaze 280 finish, 
which repels moisture, odors, mildew, and stains. Pencil, ink, and even cosmetic marks wash off easily with an industrial-
grade cleaner. "
211,," (Exhibit 60, Def. Appx. to Mem. in Support of S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 298, 1986 Sweet's Catalog, at S 66786.)"
211,6," The test is officially entitled ""Standard Test Method for Surface Burning Characteristics of Building Materials."" (Vol. IV, Ex. 3, 
Appx. in Support of Pl. S.J. Mot./Lanham Act, Dkt. Entry 280, ASTM E-84-95b.) "
212,7," Santana disputes the contention that most building codes use this standard, instead arguing that model building codes and 
other building codes have a fire rating standard called ""noncombustible."" (Pl. Response to Bobrick's Rev. Stat. of Material Facts, 
Dkt. Entry 393, P 4.) Although not using the same terminology, many of these codes use the numerical ratings produced by the 
ASTM E-84 test. Indeed, both Santana and Bobrick have, at some time, used this fire rating system in their promotional 
materials."
212,8," The parties dispute the circulation of this brochure. Bobrick contends such brochures were distributed nationwide for several 
years, while Santana argues that this brochure was developed for the New York City area only -- New York City required 
Santana to meet a wall finish (Class B) standard -- and that, at most, one copy was sent to Albany, New York on January 4, 
1991. (Pl. Response to Bobrick's Rev. Stat. of Material Facts, Dkt. Entry 393, PP 12-14.)"
212,9," The advertisement states: FR SERIES Santana Products has the manufacturing capability to custom compound polymer resins with fire retardants designed to 
meet the most strict fire code requirements within certain states or local municipalities …. Flame-spread index and smoke-
generation values have been established using ASTM E-84, Steiner Tunnel Test or equivalent of NFPA's 255. (Test data 
available upon request.) (Ex. 60, Appx. to Mem. in Support of Bobrick's S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 298, 1986 Sweet's Catalog, at S 66786.) Earlier on the same 
page, Santana claims that its Poly-Mar HD series ""consists of standard high-density polymer resin compounds with an 
equivalent Class 'B' flame-spread."" (Id.) "
213,10," Although Santana advertised is Poly-Mar HD series as meeting a Class B flame spread, Bobrick asserted in its ""fire scare"" 
marketing campaign -- and Santana does not dispute -- that the Poly-Mar HD partition's smoke generation exceeded that 
allowed by the fire ratings."
213,11," These customers included AAMCO, Knickerbocker, Global Partitions, Sanymetal, Weis/Robart, Metpar, Accurate, All 
American, Flush Metal and Columbia Partitions. (Pl. Rev. Stat. of Material Facts/Sherman Act, Dkt. Entry 382, P 8.)"
213,12," The Formica videotape showed one of Santana's HDPE toilet partitions being set on fire with a lighter. This segment of the 
videotape had been produced by Metpar, a competitor of Santana. "
215,13," Santana then commenced litigation against Sylvester in the Eastern District of New York. That action has been stayed 
pending the resolution of this case."
215,14," The Court is most grateful for the excellent work performed by Mr. Reihner in superintending the sometimes contentious 
discovery problems that are often encountered in litigation of this complexity."
215,15," Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993). "
221,16," This does not appear to be an exception, per se, but merely a factor in the Court's analysis. As the Court later stated in Allied 
Tube, ""Noerr immunity of anticompetitive activity intended to influence the government depends not only on its impact, but also 
on the context and nature of the activity."" 486 U.S. at 504. In Allied Tube, not only was there evidence that the defendant was 
attempting to prevent anyone from dealing with the plaintiff, but also that it did so by preventing a private association from 
including the plaintiff's product in its industry standards."
221,17," Santana claims that these statements of material fact show that the defendants' campaign was aimed directly at Santana. 
While these statements certainly demonstrate that the purpose of the marketing campaign was to injure Santana's business, 
they do not show that the defendants sought to dissuade the architects from dealing with Santana specifically, as opposed to 
specifying HDPE toilet partitions in general."
221,18," They did so by arguing that the ""product"" -- cargo transportation by truck -- caused damage to the roads, violated the law and 
created traffic hazards. Noerr, 365 U.S. at 142-43. Similarly, the defendants' marketing campaign asserted that HDPE partitions 
did not meet the ASTM E-84 test (adopted into law by some states) and created a fire hazard. "
223,19," In City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 374-75, 379, the Court intimated at a ""possible market participant exception"" to Parker state 
action immunity. The Court, however, did not suggest that such an exception existed in the Noerr/Pennington context. Moreover, 
the Court's citation in City of Columbia to Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. United States, 313 U.S. 450, 85 L. Ed. 1453, 61 S. Ct. 
1064 (1941), as an example of what it meant to be a commercial or market participant suggests that the government must be in 
competition with the complaining party before the exception to immunity may apply. In Union Pacific, Kansas City was held liable 
for action take in its capacity as the owner and operator of a wholesale produce market integrated with railroad facilities. Here, 
by way of contrast, the governmental actors are not in the business of making and selling toilet partitions. Thus, any possible 
market participant exception suggested by the Supreme Court in City of Columbia is not applicable here. See Hedgecock v. 
Blackwell Land Co., 52 F.3d 333 (table), [reported in full-text format at] 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 8027, 1995 WL 161649, at *2 (9th 
Cir. April 7, 1995)(governmental entity's allocation of water does not fall within any commercial participant exception to Parker 
because ""plaintiffs are not in competition with the district, rather they feel the economic effect of the district's decision concerning 
the refusal to sell allegedly excess water to other districts."")."
223,20," The Third Circuit has apparently not addressed the question of whether there should be an exemption from Noerr/Pennington 
immunity when the government is petitioned in its capacity as a consumer or purchaser of goods and services. "
224,21," Significantly, the Fifth Circuit explicitly rejected the characterization advanced by Santana in this case that its earlier holding in 
Woods Exploration and Producing Co. v. Aluminum Co. of America, 438 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. "
225,1047," , 30 L. Ed. 2d 736, 92 S. Ct. 701 (1972), recognized a ""commercial"" exception to the Noerr/Pennington doctrine. 
Greenwood, 751 F.2d at 1505 n.14."
225,22," The Ninth Circuit's rejection of a commercial exception in In re Airport Car Rental Antitrust Litigation undermines Santana's 
reliance upon that court's earlier decision in Sacramento Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 440 
F.2d 1096 (9th Cir. 1971). "
227,23," None of the cases Santana cites for the proposition that commercial speech may be regulated -- Central Hudson Gas & 
Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New York, 447 U.S. 557, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341, 100 S. Ct. 2343 (1980); National 
Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637, 98 S. Ct. 1355 (1978); and Bates v. State 
Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 351, 53 L. Ed. 2d 810, 97 S. Ct. 2691 (1977) -- involved any petitioning activity. Commercial speech in 
the petitioning context adds an additional First Amendment concern not addressed by the case law cited by Santana. Indeed, 
Santana's argument appears to be a roundabout way of finding a commercial exception to the Noerr/Pennington doctrine. As 
noted above, courts have already held that misrepresentations by the petitioner do not vitiate Noerr immunity. Santana wants to 
except from this principle commercial speech. But if unethical and deceitful conduct does not eliminate Noerr immunity, even 
where the aim is to restrain competition, so too deceptive and misleading commercial speech directed at government actors 
should not undermine the protection otherwise afforded First Amendment petitioning activity, at least in the absence of a clear 
congressional directive to the contrary. To hold otherwise would create too large a loophole in Noerr immunity as many of the 
petitions aimed at government could be characterized as involving commercial speech."
227,24," Co-defendants Hornyak and Vogel also moved for summary judgment on the basis of the Noerr/Pennington doctrine. Both 
Hornyak and Vogel presented evidence that their sales activity were directed exclusively at public entities. Santana did not 
dispute this characterization of the evidence. Indeed, Santana's opposition brief does not address the applicability of the 
Noerr/Pennington doctrine to the alleged actions of Hornyak and Vogel. Accordingly, Hornyak and Vogel are entitled to entry of 
judgment in their favor on all claims solely on the basis of the Noerr/Pennington defense. I will also address, however, other 
issues raised by the parties that pertain to the potential liability of Hornyak and Vogel. "
229,25," Plainly distinguishable is Iron Workers Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 29 F. Supp. 2d 801 (N.D. Ohio 1999), on which Bobrick 
places heavy reliance. That case involved a general marketing strategy by tobacco companies aimed at the general public. In 
contrast, Bobrick solicited sales from specific customers. Furthermore, Iron Workers Fund involved class action plaintiffs suing 
for aggregate injury to employee health funds, and not an individual plaintiff suing for lost profits attributable to adverse impact 
on sales resulting from an alleged antitrust conspiracy."
229,26," Bobrick does not reconcile the apparent contradiction in its assertion that the 1993 videotape and 1995 advertisement were 
mere ""reaffirmations"" of prior acts with its assertion that they were independent, unilateral actions."
229,27," Santana has not established a triable issue with respect to any alleged damages sustained prior to October 1, 1992. First, this 
is decidedly not the kind of case referenced in Zenith, where the fact of damage is speculative at the time of the illegal conduct. 
In this case, injury was both sustained and ascertainable at the time that the alleged illegal conduct precluded Santana from 
bidding on construction projects. And second, Santana has not presented sufficient evidence to substantiate its suggestion that 
the limitations period was tolled until 1994 by fraudulent concealment: HN26[
] The plaintiff has the burden of proving the three necessary elements of a fraudulent concealment claim -- (1) 
""active misleading"" by the defendant, (2) which prevents the plaintiff from recognizing the validity of her claim within the 
limitations period, (3) where the plaintiff's ignorance is not attributable to her lack of ""reasonable due diligence in attempting 
to uncover the relevant facts."" Mathews v. Kidder, Peabody & Co., 260 F.3d 239, 256 (3d Cir. 2001). In this case, Santana has not presented sufficient 
evidence to support a finding that Bobrick and its alleged co- conspirators engaged in any affirmative act of concealment 
intended to mislead Santana regarding facts supporting its Sherman Act claims. In this regard, that there was an agreement that 
there would be no publicity concerning the formation of TPMC, that Santana was not sent an application to join the TPMC, that 
other manufacturers' applications to join the TPMC were not acted upon, that Formica sent a cease and desist letter to Santana 
in July of 1990 without mentioning the TPMC, that Bobrick instructed architectural representatives to not leave the Formica 
videotape with potential customers, and that Bobrick controlled the use of its ""You Be The Judge"" videotape do not, in isolation 
or in combination, amount to ""active misleading."" Moreover, Santana has not shown that it exercised reasonable diligence under 
the circumstances. The ""fire scare"" tactics of which Santana complains were known to it in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
HN27[
] A plaintiff may not sit by and fail to investigate a claim when presented with facts ""'that should excite his suspicion ….'"" In re Lower Lake Erie, 998 F.2d at 1179. Santana does not explain its failure to investigate the existence of its possible claims, 
even though it had hired a Bobrick salesperson in 1992, and she had provided information to Santana in early 1992 concerning 
Bobrick's use of the Formica videotape. (See Ex. 272, Appx. to Reply Mem. in Support of Bobrick's S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 344, 
Jones Dep. at 278-80.) Thus, as Judge Mishler in the parallel case of Santana Products, Inc. v. Sylvester & Associates, Ltd., 
121 F. Supp. 2d 729, 734-35 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), concluded, Santana's Sherman Act claims are limited to the injuries sustained 
within four years of the filing of this action. "
230,28," Judge Becker explained that the problem with the argument in support of applying the residual limitations period was that ""it 
focused on the source of law to the exclusion of the substance of the cause of action."" 296 F.3d at 208. He observed HN31[
] 
that ""it is more appropriate to borrow a limitations period under state law on the basis of the substantive elements of the 
analogous state cause of action, rather than on whether the cause of action is created by common law or statute."" Id. This 
rationale compels rejection of Santana's argument, premised upon Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc. v. Crown Life Ins. Co., 792 
F.2d 341 (3d Cir. 1986), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Agency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff & Associates, Inc. 483 U.S. 143, 
97 L. Ed. 2d 121, 107 S. Ct. 2759 (1987), that one statute of limitations should be selected for the variety of causes of action 
created by § 43 of the Lanham Act. The Third Circuit's analysis in Island Insteel indicates that the limitations period governing 
the state law cause of action most closely resembling the particular Lanham Act claim should be selected. "
232,29," Bobrick argues that the UTPCPL is not sufficiently analogous to Santana's § 43(a) claim because the Pennsylvania statute 
creates a cause of action for consumers, see 73 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 201-9.2, whereas consumers do not have standing to 
bring false advertising claims under the Lanham Act. See Serbin, 11 F.3d at 1179. Significantly, the Court of Appeals did not 
view as significant the fact that the Virgin Islands unfair trade practices statute created a cause of action only for consumers, but 
not for competitors. See Island Insteel, 296 F.3d at 209. Thus, the fact that Pennsylvania law, like the Virgin Islands statute, fails 
to provide a cause of action for competitors, does not undermine the conclusion that an unfair competition claim under the 
UTPCPL is the Pennsylvania cause of action bearing the strongest resemblance to a § 43(a) false advertising claim."
232,30," The residual six year period is established by 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. § 5527(6), which provides: HN35[
] Any civil action or proceeding which is neither subject to another limitation specified in this subchapter nor 
excluded from application of a period of limitation by § 5531 (relating to no limitation) must be commenced within six years."
232,31," The fact that Island Insteel refused to apply the Virgin Islands ""catch-all"" statute of limitations to a trademark infringement 
claim does not compel rejection of Pennsylvania's residual statute of limitations here. Chief Judge Becker explained that the 
Virgin Islands residual limitations period could not be applied ""because plaintiffs have failed to identify a specific statutory cause 
of action under Virgin Islands law that is analogous to their Lanham Act claim and is subject to the catch-all six-year limitations 
period for actions upon a liability created by a statute that lacks a statute of limitations …."" 296 F.3d at 204 (emphasis added). 
Here, by way of contrast, Santana has identified a specific statutory cause of action under Pennsylvania law that is both 
analogous to its Lanham Act claim and is subject to the Pennsylvania catch-all limitations period. Accordingly, a close reading of 
Island Insteel buttresses the conclusion that Santana's Lanham Act claim is governed by the residual limitations period of six 
years. "
233,32," Bobrick identified several witnesses who died during the pendency of this litigation. Difficulties in securing evidence arising 
during the pendency of a lawsuit, and not during the delay in bringing the suit, do not constitute prejudice within the meaning of 
the laches doctrine. Jarrow, 304 F.3d at 839."
233,33," HN40[
] Section 5523(1) of title 42 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes requires that ""an action for libel, slander or invasion of privacy"" be brought within one year of its accrual. "
234,34," HN41[
] Section 5524(3) provides a two-year limitations period for ""an action for taking, detaining or injuring personal property, including actions for specific recovery thereof."""
234,35," It should be noted that because the tort of commercial disparagement requires a showing that the publisher of the statement 
either intended the publication to cause pecuniary harm or reasonably should recognize that the publication will result in such 
loss, id., it does not provide an appropriate analogue to the false advertising claim created by the Lanham Act for purposes of 
determining the appropriate state statute of limitations. Application of such a short limitations period would also raise concerns 
that the remedial purposes of the Lanham Act would be undermined. See Malley-Duff, 792 F.2d at 351 (expressing concern that 
one-year limitations period would ""contravene the broad remedial purposes of civil RICO""). "
235,36," HN46[
] Under the per se rule, the second and third prongs of the analysis are conclusively presumed. That is, the plaintiff 
need not establish harm to competition or that the objects of the conspiracy were illegal."
235,37," HN48[
] The phrase 'concerted action' is often used as shorthand for any form of activity meeting the section 1 'contract … combination or conspiracy' requirement."" Jacob Blinder & Sons, Inc. v. Gerber Prods. Co. (In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig.), 166 
F.3d 112, 117 n.3 (3d Cir. 1999). "
238,38," The evidence proffered by Santana is sufficient to withstand summary judgment even without considering so-called ""plus 
factors"" in cases of conscious parallelism. As noted above, HN54[
] although ""mere consciously parallel behavior alone is 
insufficient to prove a conspiracy, it is circumstantial evidence from which, when supplemented by additional evidence, an illegal 
agreement can be inferred."" Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1242. At a minimum, the evidence in this case shows Bobrick to be engaged 
in conduct consciously parallel to that of the TPMC members. It has also shown the existence of requisite ""plus factors"" to 
survive summary judgment. Such HN55[
] ""plus factors"" include, inter alia, whether the defendant acted in contravention of its 
individual economic interests, Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1242-45, whether the defendant is unable or unwilling to rebut or explain 
the uniform behavior, id. at 1245, whether the defendant was involved in various meetings and exchanged correspondence with 
alleged co-conspirators, see In re Baby Food, 166 F.3d 133-37, and whether the defendant has a motive to enter into the 
conspiracy, see Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 595-98. Contrary to Bobrick's assertions, at least two of the plus factors are relevant 
here. In particular, Bobrick would have had a motive to enter the alleged conspiracy and was involved in several meetings with 
representatives of TPMC members. Thus, as discussed above, there is sufficient evidence to allow an inference that Bobrick 
was a member of the alleged conspiracy. "
240,39," In Hydrolevel, the defendants used their position within the American Society of Mechanical Engineers to obtain an 
interpretation of a product code adverse to Hydrolevel, and then used that interpretation to the competitive disadvantage of 
Hydrolevel. The issue addressed by the Court was whether the American Society of Mechanical Engineers could be held liable 
under the antitrust laws for the conduct of its agents. The Court did not address the question of whether the defendants' conduct 
was per se illegal."
240,40," It appears that, as of mid-1989, there were five distributors of HDPE partitions: Knickerbocker, Sanymetal, Capitol Partitions, 
Santana, and General Partitions. (Pl. Rev. Stat. of Material Facts/Sherman Act, Dkt. Entry 382, P 109L.) General Partitions was 
a regional distributor only; the other companies were national distributors. (Id., P 6.) By March of 1991, Knickerbocker, 
Sanymetal, and General Partitions discontinued HDPE compartments. (Id., P 89.) However, Compression Polymers, Inc., which 
had sold HDPE panels to these three companies, entered the toilet partition market with HDPE compartments through its 
subsidiary, Sanatec Industries, now known as Comtec. (Ex. 295, Appx. to Mem. in Support of Bobrick's S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 411, 
Sanatec Market Report dated April 1990, at 11.)"
240,41," One of Santana's expert witnesses testified at his deposition that the toilet partition market is very competitive. (Ex. 240, Appx. 
to Mem. in Support of Bobrick's S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 298, Pisarkiewicz Dep. Tr., at 9.) Manufacturers in the industry utilize a 
variety of materials. Thus, for example, two of the TPMC members who discontinued HDPE made compartments of steel, as 
well as plastic laminate and phenolic. The evidence reflects that there was strong competition in this market. Moreover, there is 
no evidence that the HDPE share of the market declined during the period 1989 through 1996. In fact, it appears that the HDPE 
share of the toilet partition market increased during the 1990's. (Ex. 24A, Appx. to Mem. in Opp. to Pl. S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 324, 
Arnaiz Dep. Tr. at 21-24.) In this regard, Santana alleges that it was injured because its rate of growth declined. It has not 
shown, however, that its share of the market declined from the pre-conspiracy period. "
241,42," Santana argues that, if the per se rule does not apply, then the Court should apply the abbreviated, or ""quick-look"" rule of 
reason analysis that has been applied to inherently suspect restraints of trade. See United States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 
659 (3d Cir. 1993). This intermediate approach applies where there is some naked restraint on price or output, or an agreement 
to withhold a desired service. See Cal. Dental Ass'n v. F.T.C., 526 U.S. 756, 769-70, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935, 119 S. Ct. 1604 (1999). 
In such situations, the burden is placed upon the defendant to show ""'some competitive justification' for the restraint, 'even in the 
absence of detailed market analysis' indicating actual profit maximization or increased cost to the consumer resulting from the 
restraint."" Brown Univ., 5 F.3d at 669. If a competitive justification is not shown, a ""presumption of adverse competitive impact 
prevails …."" Id. This ""quick-look"" analysis under the rule of reason is reserved for those cases in which ""an observer with even a 
rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in question would have an anti-competitive 
effect on customers and markets."" Cal. Dental Ass'n, 526 U.S. at 770. ""The object is to see whether the experience of the 
market has been so clear, or necessarily will be, that a confident conclusion about the principal tendency of a restriction will 
follow from a quick … look, in place of a more sedulous one."" Id. at 781. As stated above, the conduct at issue in this case is not 
so plainly anticompetitive as to constitute a naked restraint on trade. Stated otherwise, effect on price and output is not obvious. 
Accordingly, this case is not appropriate for the ""quick look"" rule of reason analysis. "
242,43," The court also considered as significant the fact that the alleged anticompetitive effect required the approval of the municipality 
and the plaintiff had an opportunity to dissuade the municipality. In language particularly apropos here, the court stated: These arguments made by FMC to its potential customers may have been wrong, misleading, or debatable. But they are all 
arguments on the merits, indicative of competition on the merits. To the extent they were successful, they were successful 
because the consumer was convinced by either FMC's product or FMC's salesmanship. FMC -- unsurprisingly -- wanted to 
be picked over Stearns on a contract. Also unsurprisingly, for that purpose it calculated carefully what kind of specifications 
would insure that it would get the contract because Stearns could not bid on a project. But it could not ask municipalities to 
enter into a sole-sourcing agreement or specify smart-bridge technology merely by asking them to hurt Stearns. FMC had 
to convince the customer that FMC's approach was best for the customer, not best for FMC. Inferring an attempt to 
circumvent competition on the merits is extraordinarily difficult when the alleged violator takes the facially rational and 
unproblematic step of attempting to sell its product, couches its arguments to the customer in favor of a sale on the merits 
of the product and procedures it recommends, and the consumer agrees. Without a showing of some other factor, we can 
only assume that a consumer will make his decision only on the merits. To the extent a competitor loses out in such a 
debate, the natural remedy would seem to be an increase in the losing party's sales efforts on future potential bids, not an 
antitrust suit. Id. at 524-25."
242,44," It should be noted that Stearns' claim was brought under section 2 of the Sherman Act. The Fifth Circuit, however, relied 
heavily on cases deciding section 1 claims. See id. at 522-23 (""While all of these cases involve section 1 of the Sherman Act 
rather than section 2 … their logic properly applies to our inquiry.""). By a parity of reasoning, the logic of Stearns applies here. "
245,45," Presumably, this is partly due to Santana's voluntary withdrawal of its expert reports on damages. But, the Pisarkiewicz Report 
does show a sixty-one percent increase in overall HDPE sales by Santana between 1989 and 1997. (Ex. 2, Appx. to Mem. in 
Support of Bobrick's S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 298, Pisarkiewicz Report, P 23.)"
245,46," HN66[
] Market power may be used as a surrogate for a showing of actual detrimental effect to the market. See Orson, Inc.,"
245,79," F.3d at 1367. Significantly, Santana, in moving for summary judgment, asserted that this case is governed by the per se rule, 
and thus did not address this surrogate for harm to competition. Furthermore, in opposing Bobrick's summary judgment motion, 
Santana did not rely upon market power. Instead, its argument was limited to the evidence of impact on Comtec and Capitol 
Partitions, as well as the exit of three small producers from the HDPE product line. (Rev. Reply Mem. in Support of Pl. S.J. Mot., 
Dkt. Entry 424, at 53-57.) Thus, there is no need to address market power as a surrogate for harm to competition. "
246,47," In the context of Sherman Act § 2 cases based upon product disparagement, courts have applied a presumption of de minimis 
harm to competition. See, e.g., Am. Prof'l Testing Serv., Inc. v. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal & Prof'l Publ'ns, Inc. 108 F.3d 
1147, 1152 (9th Cir.1997). The anticompetitive conduct at issue in this case is essentially based on commercial disparagement. 
It would thus appear that the reasoning in the § 2 cases would be equally applicable here. HN68[
] To overcome the 
presumption of de minimis impact on competition, a plaintiff must show that the representations ""'were [1] clearly false, [2] clearly 
material, [3] clearly likely to induce reasonable reliance, [4] made to buyers without knowledge of the subject matter, [5] 
continued for prolonged periods, and [6] not readily susceptible of neutralization or other offset by rivals.'"" Id. All six elements 
must be shown to overcome the de minimis presumption. Id. In this case, Santana has failed to show that the challenged 
advertisements and other dissemination of information were made to unsophisticated buyers. On the contrary, the architects and 
specifiers were knowledgeable purchasers who were skeptical of the ""fire scare"" marketing. (See, e.g., Ex. 138, Appx. to Mem. 
in Support of Bobrick's S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 298, Winslow Dept. at 71; Ex. 142, id., Hayashi 1/10/00 Dep. Tr. at 61; Def. Rev. 
Mem. in Opp. to Pl. S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 406, at 63.) Furthermore, the ""fire scare"" marketing was ""readily susceptible to 
neutralization."" Am. Prof'l Testing Serv., 108 F.3d at 1152 (""The argument that its neutralization efforts were not completely 
successful is unavailing; the test refers to 'susceptible to neutralization' not 'successful in neutralization.'""). Santana has 
acknowledged that it was often able to convince architects to change their specifications back to HDPE, (Pl. Rev. Stat. of 
Material Facts/Sherman Acts, Dkt. Entry 382, PP 113, 115), and persuaded state and local officials to change their interpretation 
of the fire codes to clarify that toilet partitions were furnishings rather than interior finish. (Pl. Response to Bobrick's Rev. Stat. of 
Material Facts, Dkt. Entry 393, PP 155-57.) Thus, application of the de minimis presumption developed in § 2 product 
disparagement cases provides an independent basis for concluding that Santana has failed to make a threshold showing of 
harm to competition."
246,48," There is no need to address the final element of plaintiff's Sherman Act § 1 case -- causation and injury -- because Santana's 
claim fails the rule of reason analysis. "
248,49," In light of this disposition of the section 2 claim, there is no need to reach the collateral estoppel issue. It bears noting, 
however, that there is a substantial argument that Judge Mishler's ruling has the requisite ""finality"" for purposes of applying the 
doctrine of collateral estoppel. Our Court of Appeals has held that in determining whether an issue has been adjudicated with 
sufficient finality, the court ""should consider whether the parties were fully heard, whether a reasoned opinion was filed, and 
whether that decision could have been, or actually was, appealed."" In re Brown, 951 F.2d 564, 569 (3d Cir. 1991). The first two 
considerations weigh in favor of application of collateral estoppel. Judge Mishler, in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), 
certified for interlocutory appeal his decision on Sylvester's motion for partial judgment on the pleadings as to the section 2 
claim. Santana, however, did not timely move for leave to appeal. Instead, it requested leave to appeal after the denial of its 
motion for reconsideration, an order which Judge Mishler did not certify under § 1292(b). The Second Circuit held that, under 
these circumstances, it lacked jurisdiction to consider Santana's request for leave to appeal. It is thus at least arguable that 
Santana should not be entitled to re-litigate the viability of its section 2 claim because it failed to take timely action in the 
appellate court when it had the opportunity to do so. Cf. Cherokee Express, Inc. v. Cherokee Express, Inc., 924 F.2d 603, 607 
(6th Cir. 1991)(defendants could not challenge a preliminary injunction and subsequent contempt proceedings following 
dismissal of appeal as untimely). "
249,50," Santana does not mention this memorandum as an instance of false advertising in its brief in support of its Lanham Act claim, 
and it will not be addressed in this opinion. "
252,51," Bobrick argues that summary judgment for a plaintiff on a claim of literal falsity is not appropriate and cites in support 
Nordictrack, Inc. v. Soloflex, Inc., 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16172, Civ. No. 93-1432-JE, 1994 WL 635123, at *2-3 (D. Or. Apr. 21, 
1994). Nordictrack, however, nowhere states that summary judgment is not appropriate on a claim of literal falsity. Rather, the 
court, considering the advertisement in full context, concludes that a reasonable jury could find the advertisement literally true or 
ambiguous, or merely to be ""puffing."""
252,52," Specifically, HN75[
] a plaintiff who has failed to show that an advertisement was literally false ""must produce consumer 
surveys or some surrogate therefor [sic] to prove"" consumer perception of the advertisements. Sandoz Pharms. Corp. v. 
Richardson-Vicks, Inc., 902 F.2d 222, 229 (3d Cir. 1999); see also Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharm. Co. v. 
Smithkline Beecham Corp., 960 F.2d 294, 297 (2d Cir. 1992)(when a ""plaintiff's theory of recovery is premised upon a claim of 
implied falsehood, a plaintiff must demonstrate, by extrinsic evidence, that the challenged commercials tend to mislead or 
confuse.""). Moreover, unlike a claim of literal falsity, a plaintiff alleging a misleading advertisement has the burden of proving that 
a substantial portion of the advertisement's audience was actually misled. See U.S. Healthcare, Inc. v. Blue Cross of Greater 
Phila., 898 F.2d 914, 922 (3d Cir. 1990). Santana has provided no evidence that a substantial number of architects and 
specifiers were deceived, though it has presented evidence of confusion of an insubstantial number of specific architects. 
Indeed, Santana states that since Bobrick's advertisements and statements were ""literally false or untrue in a number of "
253,," respects, this court can grant relief without considering whether the buying public was misled."" (Rev. Mem. in Support of Pl. S.J. 
Mot./Lanham Act, Dkt. Entry 385, at 14-15.)"
253,53," The underscored language was asserted by Santana to be literally false. (Rev. Mem. in Support of Pl. S.J. Mot./Lanham Act, 
Dkt. Entry 385, at 11.) "
254,54, Santana does not claim that the representations concerning the test results are false.
254,55," It should also be noted that Santana has not adduced any evidence to suggest that SPC would react in a manner inconsistent 
with the test results under actual fire conditions. "
255,56," It should also be noted that Santana did not comply with the consent decree when it made representations concerning 
numerical flame spread ratings. "
256,57," The fact that Bobrick granted permission to an independent sales representative to market HDPE panels does not merit entry 
of summary judgment in Santana's favor. It is, however, relevant to determining whether a reasonable juror could find the video's 
characterization literally false. As for Santana's argument that Bobrick's ""fire hazard"" evidence is a ""litigation afterthought,"" the fact that Bobrick may not have 
been aware of any toilet compartment fires until 1997 is not persuasive given the Third Circuit's ruling that a Lanham Act plaintiff 
""bears the burden of showing that a challenged advertisement is false or misleading, not merely that it is unsubstantiated by 
acceptable tests or other proof."" Sandoz, 902 F.2d at 228. Nor was Bobrick's claim so completely unsubstantiated as to bring it 
under Novartis, 290 F.3d at 590 (""a court may find that a completely unsubstantiated advertising claim by the defendant is per se 
false without additional evidence from the plaintiff to that effect""), because in this case testing had been done before the 
videotape was produced. "
257,58," Both Bobrick and Santana concentrate the majority of their arguments on the interpretation of the NFPA 101. The NFPA Life 
Safety Code was created in response to fires such as the Nov. 28, 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire in Boston which killed 492 patrons 
of the night club. (Ex. 258, Appx. to Mem. in Support of Bobrick's S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 298, Report of David Demers at 1.) 
Demers' report states that ""NFPA 101 is the leader and the model building codes have typically followed with adopting the Life 
Safety Code requirements within a code development cycle (one to three years) after adoption by the NFPA."" (Id.) "
258,59," As pointed out by Bobrick, the pertinent local authority has discretion to decide what constitutes wall finish. In this regard, 
Bobrick also states that the first edition of the NFPA's Life Safety Code Handbook contains the following commentary to Section 
6-2.1.1: Section 6.2.1.1 permits the authority having jurisdiction to exercise personal judgment in determining what constitutes 
interior finish. This is accomplished by the expression ""but not limited to."" Note that interior finish is defined as what would 
be the interior surface of a building before occupancy, prior to the time that the interior decorator moves the decorations 
into the building. Thus, wall, ceiling and column coverings would be in place and constitute the interior finish …. Movable 
walls or folding partitions would be in place and included. Furnishings, which are fixed in place, are not normally [classified] 
as interior finish; however, this does not mean that they cannot be looked upon as interior finish if judged to be hazardous 
by the authority having jurisdiction. (Bobrick's Rev. Mem. in Opp. to Pl. S.J. Mot./Lanham Act, Dkt. Entry 406, at 104.) "
259,60," Bobrick claims that there is no evidence that Bobrick representatives used the Formica video (or any other promotional 
material) in any jurisdiction where the authority having jurisdiction issued a clear and unambiguous ruling that toilet partitions did 
not constitute interior finish. (Bobrick's Rev. Mem. in Opp. to Pl. S.J. Mot./Lanham Act, Dkt. Entry 406, at 105-06.) Santana 
points out, however, that not all jurisdictions have adopted the NFPA Life Safety Code. It notes, for example, that the Uniform 
Building Code, the National Building Code, and the Standard Building Code have provisions regarding approved plastics that 
use a different smoke density standard than the ASTM E-84 test. (Pl. Rev. Stat. of Material Facts/Lanham Act, Dkt. Entry 387, P 
203, and Bobrick's response thereto, Dkt. Entry 409, P 203.) This argument misses the point. Santana does not refer to 
evidence that toilet partitions are excluded from the building codes. Furthermore, the Formica videotape did not reference any 
particular code. The fact that there are other applicable codes that arguably extend to toilet partitions only serves to reinforce the 
conclusion that the supposed implication drawn from the Formica video is not actionable under the Lanham Act."
259,61," It is, however, difficult to discern the implication that Santana claims is made: toilet partitions must meet a Class B requirement 
by code. The Formica video does not make this assertion explicitly, and its use of the word ""code"" hardly implies a specific fire 
rating that must be met. It may be that inclusion of references to ""Class B"" and ""code"" may be misleading. But even when the 
entire video is considered as a whole, it cannot be said that it necessarily conveys the message that toilet partitions must meet a 
certain fire rating. "
262,62," In any event, this statement makes no reference to fire performance. "
263,63, Santana seeks both injunctive and monetary relief under the Lanham Act. 
264,64," It should be noted that much of the alleged lost sales were sustained in the public sector. Recovery for such lost sales is now 
foreclosed in light of the determination that the Noerr/Pennington doctrine applies to Bobrick's sales efforts directed at public 
institutions. It cannot be said with certainty, however, that all of Santana's lost sales occurred in the public sector. Thus, the 
Noerr/Pennington ruling does not obviate consideration of the Lanham Act claim. "
265,65," Santana does refer to a deposition that indicates that Santana competed with Bobrick's Thrislington compartment under 
circumstances where Bobrick's representative painted HDPE as failing to comply with the NFPA Life Safety Code. (Pl. Rev. Stat. 
of Material Facts/Lanham Act, Dkt. Entry 387, P 197). A showing of competition, alone, is insufficient to show injury. There is, in 
fact, no evidence that the Thrislington script was ever followed word for word by architects. Hornyak testified in his deposition 
that he used the script as a ""guide"" for his presentations, but did not recall repeating the objectionable statement that HDPE was 
highly flammable. (Ex. 7A, Appx. to Bobrick's Mem. in Opp. to Pl. S.J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 324, Hornyak Dep. Tr. at 188-89.) Vogel 
gave similar testimony. (Ex. 57A, id., Vogel Dep. Tr. at 227.)"
265,66," This does not, however, affect Santana's claim for injunctive relief. HN81[
] A party seeking injunctive relief under § 43(a) must establish ""something more than a 'mere subjective belief that he is … likely to be damaged,' but that the plaintiff 'need not 
quantify the losses actually borne.'"" Warner-Lambert Co. v. Breathasure, Inc., 204 F.3d 87, 93 (3d Cir. 2000)(quoting Johnson & 
Johnson v. Carter-Wallace, Inc., 631 F.2d 186, 189 (2d Cir. 1980). As in Breathasure, the promotional materials used by Bobrick 
were ""implicitly aimed"" at Santana's HDPE products. The likelihood of injury from characterizations of HDPE as ""highly 
flammable"" or a ""fire and smoke hazard"" is patent. Thus, Santana has satisfied this burden. But, as there are still genuine issues 
of material fact as to the falsity of certain of the promotional materials and it appears that the claims found to be literally false are 
not presently being made, judgment will not be granted Santana on its request for injunctive relief at this time. "
267,67," Santana also cited in its opposition brief Camp Creek Hospitality Inns, Inc. v. Sheraton Franchise Corp., 130 F.3d 1009 (11th 
Cir. 1997). Not only did this decision rely on Georgia law, but it was vacated and superseded on rehearing, 139 F.3d 1396 (11th 
Cir. 1998). The case involved two competing hotels near an Atlanta airport. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant hotel had 
used improper actions to induce a number of guests who had made reservations at the plaintiff's hotel to instead stay at the 
defendant's hotel. On rehearing, the court affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment because the plaintiff failed to 
establish a causal connection between the defendant's tortious activity and the interruption of any particular business 
relationship. Id. at 1407-09 (""The evidence, construed in Camp Creek's favor, merely shows that the Gateway offered to meet or 
beat the Inn's rates when these guests arrived at their door …. Camp Creek has presented no evidence that suggests these 
guests canceled their reservations at the Inn because of the Gateway's alleged wrongful activity …."")."
267,68," Because Santana has failed to establish facts demonstrating a prospective contractual relationship, the Court need not 
address the remaining elements of the claim. See Thompson Coal, 412 A.2d at 472 n.8. It is noteworthy, however, that there is a 
substantial question as to whether Bobrick's action was sufficiently privileged or justified as to preclude liability for tortious 
interference with contract. See Glenn v. Point Park Coll., 441 Pa. 474, 272 A.2d 895, 899 (Pa. 1971)(""Where, as in most cases, 
the defendant acts at least in part for the purpose of protecting some legitimate interest which conflicts with that of the plaintiff, a 
line must be drawn and the interests evaluated."")(quoting Harper & James, The Law of Torts, § 6.11, at 513). Bobrick's ad 
campaign was clearly motivated, at least in part, to further the legitimate goal of increasing its sales. Because the parties do not 
address this element, I decline to do so."
267,69," Santana's claim for punitive damages cannot survive the dismissal of its claim for tortious interference with prospective 
contract, and summary judgment will necessarily also be granted as to the claim for punitive damages. "
277,*," The Honorable Samuel P. King, Senior United States District Judge for the District of Hawaii, sitting by designation."
277,1, The facts we describe are uncontested unless otherwise noted. 
278,2," State law and industry practice distinguish between ""brokers"" and ""salespersons."" We use the term ""agents"" throughout as a 
generic place-holder for real estate professionals who are typical MLS subscribers."
278,3, The other association was unaffiliated and didn't participate in any of the arrangements at issue in this case.
278,4," Although Sandicor has experimented with different pricing policies, at most relevant times it charged fees based on the number 
of individuals who used the MLS. Thus, a real estate office with four agents using the MLS would pay four subscription fees. "
279,5, The fee has varied somewhat over the years but remains at approximately the same level.
279,6," Ten dollars is the figure quoted at the 1991 meeting; plaintiffs claim that SDAR's cost of providing support services is actually 
much less. It is unclear from the briefing and record whether the $ 10 figure also included SDAR's share of the MLS database 
costs."
279,7," Plaintiffs' briefs argue both monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize theories, but the Second Amended Complaint alleges 
only the conspiracy claim in the market for support services. Second Amended Complaint PP 158-160. The complaint also 
alleges monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize in the MLS market itself, id. PP 161-168, but plaintiffs abandoned 
arguments related to that market on appeal."
279,8," Plaintiffs had earlier sued in California state court for violations of state antitrust law. The trial court dismissed the suit on the 
pleadings, and the court of appeal affirmed. Freeman v. San Diego Ass'n of Realtors, 77 Cal. App. 4th 171, 91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 534 
(1999). Defendants rely on the state decision as persuasive authority but do not contend that it has preclusive effects on 
plaintiffs' federal claims. The state suit has no res judicata effect because federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction and "
280,," California doesn't apply res judicata to claims the first forum was incompetent to hear. See Marrese v. Am. Acad. of Orthopaedic 
Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 379, 382, 84 L. Ed. 2d 274, 105 S. Ct. 1327 (1985); Pension Trust Fund for Operating Eng'rs v. Triple 
A Mach. Shop, Inc., 942 F.2d 1457, 1460 (9th Cir. 1991). The suit also has no relevant issue preclusive effects here because the 
pertinent issues are not ""identical."" Lucido v. Superior Court, 51 Cal.3d 335, 341, 272 Cal. Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223 (1990). The 
state suit challenged different conduct--namely, an alleged conspiracy to fix Sandicor's MLS fee. The state court's single-entity 
analysis is thus not preclusive, because it was based in part on the nature of the price-fixing allegation. See Freeman, 77 Cal. 
App. 4th at 192-94 & n.21. Moreover, because the state suit was dismissed on the pleadings, we doubt that it has any issue 
preclusive effects in this case at all. The purely legal issue of the sufficiency of the claims under California law is not identical to 
the federal issues here. See id. at 183 n.9 (noting that the Cartwright and Sherman Acts are ""not coextensive""). The state suit is, 
of course, res judicata as to plaintiffs' pendent state law claims. The district court dismissed those claims under 28 U.S.C. § 
1367, and plaintiffs haven't asked us to revive them."
280,9," The only remaining individual defendant was Anita Alkire, who filed for bankruptcy during the proceedings. Plaintiffs have 
abandoned their claims against her. "
281,10," One manual captures the principle nicely in question and answer format: ""[Q.] May competitors agree to fix prices? [A.] Duh. 
What do you think?"" Eliot G. Disner, Antitrust Law for Business Lawyers § 4.06, at 82 (2001). "
282,11," A firm will normally pass on some portion of its cost-per-unit savings to consumers even if it is a profit-maximizing monopolist. 
This has nothing to do with altruism; a monopolist just makes more money by reducing its price in response to a cost decline and 
thus selling to more consumers. See Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 248 (1976) (""[I]f the 
monopolist's marginal cost declines (other things being the same), he will reduce his price . . . .""). The theoretical economics of 
this case are more nuanced because the associations are shareholders of Sandicor. They could conceivably induce Sandicor to 
set MLS fees at a level that maximizes shareholder profits (dividends plus support fees) rather than its own. The level of support 
fees might then be less relevant (except perhaps as a device to make the MLS look less profitable than it really is). The record 
contains no evidence that Sandicor ever set MLS prices in this fashion, however. Instead, it indicates that Sandicor set prices 
based on costs."
282,12," Defendants argue that an indirect purchaser who proves it can sue under Illinois Brick because of a unity of interest 
necessarily proves that it can't sue under Copperweld because of the very same unity of interest. This argument is clever but 
unpersuasive. Copperweld looks at whether the defendants are commonly owned, not at whether they commonly own some 
other entity. Royal Printing, on the other hand, doesn't care who owns whom in the distribution chain. Thus, Copperweld doesn't 
apply here (as we will see) because the associations are independently owned, but Royal Printing applies because the 
associations own Sandicor. "
283,13, These figures reflect 1999 MLS and support fees.
283,14," The district court rejected the section 1 claim in part because the associations' support services and MLS database access 
were not ""separate and distinct products or services"" with ""separate markets."" It relied heavily on tying concepts. Distinct product 
markets are crucial to a tying claim, but they are largely irrelevant to a price-fixing claim. Many forms of price fixing, for example, 
involve retail services that are obviously inseparable from the product itself. See, e.g., Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal 
Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 102-03, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980); Plymouth Dealers, 279 F.2d at 134. That the retail 
services can legally be tied to the product doesn't mean that retailers can agree to fix prices."
283,15," A refund of part of Sandicor's MLS fee from an association to an agent is equivalent to a reduction in the support fee that 
Sandicor pays the association coupled with a reduction in the MLS fee that the agent pays Sandicor."
283,16," Plaintiffs claim several other instances of price fixing. Sandicor's board of directors, which is made up of association 
representatives, fixed the associations' retail prices on books, ""tour inputs,"" computer assistance by association staff, and 
lockboxes and replacement keypads. Defendants question plaintiffs' standing to challenge these practices, observing that they 
did not specifically allege having purchased these products and services. We leave the issue for the district court to resolve on 
remand. Plaintiffs further challenge Sandicor's policy of mandating ""uniform"" support services and a standardized splash screen. 
These are nonprice restraints subject to rule-of-reason analysis. See Cont'l T.V., 433 U.S. at 59. We leave them for the district 
court to consider in the first instance as well. "
284,17," Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was decided before Copperweld, but nothing in the latter impugns our holding in the former. "
285,18," We may resolve the issue of capacity to conspire because the relevant facts are not disputed. See L.A. Mem'l Coliseum, 726 
F.2d at 1387."
285,19," We assume this to be the case, although we do note that each association's ownership interest in Sandicor is automatically 
adjusted every year to reflect the relative number of subscribers it serves, so that the associations have eliminated many of the 
elements of risk-sharing traditionally associated with the corporate form."
285,20," The district court held that ""[c]ompetition for members is outside the scope of the Associations' joint venture."" But MLS 
subscriptions are one of the services associations sell to their respective members. An association that attracts more members 
thereby attracts more subscribers, and thus earns more support fees from Sandicor."
285,21," The associations may have been actual competitors even before board of choice, because under Palsson, 16 Cal.3d at 937-
38, they had to sell MLS subscriptions to nonmembers, who were not subject to NAR's geographical restrictions. "
286,22," We note that our colleagues on the First Circuit recently disdained the Copperweld defense in a monogrammatically similar 
case. See Fraser v. Major League Soccer, L.L.C., 284 F.3d 47, 59 (1st Cir. 2002) (""The case for expanding Copperweld is 
debatable and, more so, the case for applying the single entity label to [an] MLS.""). "
287,23," Professional Engineers was a rule of reason case, but the principle applies with even more force in the per se context."
287,24," It does not matter that Fallbrook and Valley Center would have operated at a loss in a competitive environment. Their 
precarious financial situation may have explained their intransigence, but it does not transform it into a viable defense. HN18[
] 
If there is any argument the Sherman Act indisputably forecloses, it is that price fixing is necessary to save companies from 
losses they would suffer in a competitive market. See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 221, 84 L. Ed. 
1129, 60 S. Ct. 811 (1940). While a competitor who fixes prices to stem his losses may be a more sympathetic character than 
one who does so to fatten his purse, he enjoys no favored legal position. Defendants' argument is more complex than the 
traditional cry of ""ruinous competition,"" but it is cut from the same cloth."
287,25," The $ 6000 figure is based on an assumed competitive price of $ 10, SDAR's stated costs in 1991. This is concededly a 
ballpark estimate, but the exact number is irrelevant to the point made. "
288,26," We also note that Fallbrook and Valley Center merged into larger associations nearly a decade ago. Even if defendants' 
argument excused price fixing at the outset, we are at a loss to see how it justifies the persistence of the regime, given that the 
purported necessity no longer exists."
288,27," We don't mean to suggest that NAR's restrictions would have been a valid defense while they existed. As essentially self-
imposed limitations quite likely anticompetitive in their own right, they are hardly a defense to per se liability."
288,28," Plenty of market defect theories do try to explain why consumers might continue using a product even after a better one 
becomes available. Switching costs, information asymmetries, and the defect du jour, the dreaded network externality, see 
United States v. Microsoft Corp., 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 49-50 (D.C. Cir. 2001); Michael L. Katz & Carl Shapiro, 
Network Externalities, Competition, and Compatibility, 75 Am. Econ. Rev. 424 (1985), all come to mind. But how are we to know, 
for example, whether Fallbrook and Valley Center's installed base would give them an insuperable advantage over a more 
efficient competitor? There are plenty of arrows in the competitive quiver that a firm might use to dislodge an incumbent: 
aggressive marketing, penetration pricing, free trials, money-back guarantees--are these techniques so obviously ineffective that 
a firm has no choice but to violate the law? Network externalities generate substantial dissent even within the economics 
community, and not only over how they should shape antitrust analysis, Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 49-50, but even over whether 
they exist at all, see, e.g., S.J. Liebowitz & Stephen E. Margolis, Network Externality: An Uncommon Tragedy, J. Econ. Persp., 
Spring 1994, at 133. We need not decide the point, but they seem a weak basis for an exception to a per se rule. "
289,29," The signing of the original shareholders' agreement antedates the limitations period, but the agreement has been re-executed 
several times since. "
290,30," That the agreement itself is not anticompetitive doesn't mean that it could never be anticompetitively applied. Even if the voting 
mechanism is permissible on its face, voting against new shareholders for anticompetitive reasons may still be a violation of 
section 2."
290,31," Although decentralizing Sandicor would be one way to remedy the price-fixing violation, it is not the only way, and Freeman 
had no right to insist on it. Whether the district court may now order Sandicor to decentralize as a matter of equitable relief is a 
different story, and an issue we need not decide. "
291,32," The magistrate also awarded plaintiffs the costs of further discovery. That sanction hasn't yet been approved by the district 
court and isn't before us. "

300,1, The facts we describe are uncontested unless otherwise noted.
300,2," State law and industry practice distinguish between ""brokers"" and ""salespersons."" We use the term ""agents"" throughout as a 
generic place-holder for real estate professionals who are typical MLS subscribers."
300,3, The other association was unaffiliated and didn't participate in any of the arrangements at issue in this case. 
301,4," Although Sandicor has experimented with different pricing policies, at most relevant times it charged fees based on the number 
of individuals who used the MLS. Thus, a real estate office with four agents using the MLS would pay four subscription fees."
301,5, The fee has varied somewhat over the years but remains at approximately the same level.
301,6," Ten dollars is the figure quoted at the 1991 meeting; plaintiffs claim that SDAR's cost of providing support services is actually 
much less. It is unclear from the briefing and record whether the $ 10 figure also included SDAR's share of the MLS database 
costs."
301,7," Plaintiffs' briefs argue both monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize theories, but the Second Amended Complaint alleges 
only the conspiracy claim in the market for support services. Second Amended Complaint PP 158-160. The complaint also 
alleges monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize in the MLS market itself, id. PP 161-168, but plaintiffs abandoned 
arguments related to that market on appeal. "
302,8," Plaintiffs had earlier sued in California state court for violations of state antitrust law. The trial court dismissed the suit on the 
pleadings, and the court of appeal affirmed.  Freeman v. San Diego Ass'n of Realtors, 77 Cal. App. 4th 171, 91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 534 
(1999). Defendants rely on the state decision as persuasive authority but do not contend that it has preclusive effects on 
plaintiffs' federal claims. The state suit has no res judicata effect because HN1[
] federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction and HN2[
] California doesn't apply res judicata to claims the first forum was incompetent to hear. See  Marrese v. Am. Acad. of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 470 U.S. 373, 379, 382, 84 L. Ed. 2d 274, 105 S. Ct. 1327 (1985);  Pension Trust Fund for Operating 
Eng'rs v. Triple A Mach. Shop, Inc., 942 F.2d 1457, 1460 (9th Cir. 1991). The suit also has no relevant issue preclusive effects 
here because the pertinent issues are not ""identical.""  Lucido v. Superior Court, 51 Cal.3d 335, 341, 272 Cal. Rptr. 767, 795 
P.2d 1223 (1990). The state suit challenged different conduct--namely, an alleged conspiracy to fix Sandicor's MLS fee. The 
state court's single-entity analysis is thus not preclusive, because it was based in part on the nature of the price-fixing allegation. 
See  Freeman, 77 Cal. App. 4th at 192-94 & n.21. Moreover, because the state suit was dismissed on the pleadings, we doubt 
that it has any issue preclusive effects in this case at all. The purely legal issue of the sufficiency of the claims under California 
law is not identical to the federal issues here. See  id. at 183 n.9 (noting that the Cartwright and Sherman Acts are ""not 
coextensive""). The state suit is, of course, res judicata as to plaintiffs' pendent state law claims. The district court dismissed 
those claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367, and plaintiffs haven't asked us to revive them."
302,9," The only remaining individual defendant was Anita Alkire, who filed for bankruptcy during the proceedings. Plaintiffs have 
abandoned their claims against her. "
303,10," One manual captures the principle nicely in question and answer format: ""[Q.] May competitors agree to fix prices? [A.] Duh. 
What do you think?"" Eliot G. Disner, Antitrust Law for Business Lawyers § 4.06, at 82 (2001). "
304,11," A firm will normally pass on some portion of its cost-per-unit savings to consumers even if it is a profit-maximizing monopolist. 
This has nothing to do with altruism; a monopolist just makes more money by reducing its price in response to a cost decline and 
thus selling to more consumers. See Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law: An Economic Perspective 248 (1976) (""If the 
monopolist's marginal cost declines (other things being the same), he will reduce his price . . . .""). The theoretical economics of 
this case are more nuanced because the associations are shareholders of Sandicor. They could conceivably induce Sandicor to 
set MLS fees at a level that maximizes shareholder profits (dividends plus support fees) rather than its own. The level of support 
fees might then be less relevant (except perhaps as a device to make the MLS look less profitable than it really is). The record 
contains no evidence that Sandicor ever set MLS prices in this fashion, however. Instead, it indicates that Sandicor set prices 
based on costs."
304,12," Defendants argue that an indirect purchaser who proves it can sue under Illinois Brick because of a unity of interest 
necessarily proves that it can't sue under Copperweld because of the very same unity of interest. This argument is clever but 
unpersuasive. Copperweld looks at whether the defendants are commonly owned, not at whether they commonly own some 
other entity. Royal Printing, on the other hand, doesn't care who owns whom in the distribution chain. Thus,  Copperweld doesn't 
apply here (as we will see) because the associations are independently owned, but  Royal Printing applies because the 
associations own Sandicor. "
305,13, These figures reflect 1999 MLS and support fees.
305,14," The district court rejected the section 1 claim in part because the associations' support services and MLS database access 
were not ""separate and distinct products or services"" with ""separate markets."" It relied heavily on tying concepts. HN8[
] 
Distinct product markets are crucial to a tying claim, but they are largely irrelevant to a price-fixing claim. Many forms of price 
fixing, for example, involve retail services that are obviously inseparable from the product itself. See, e.g.,  Cal. Retail Liquor 
Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 102-03, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233, 100 S. Ct. 937 (1980);  Plymouth Dealers, 279

government will not only have to avoid the Seventh Circuit, but also all the other circuits that say, as we do here, that HN29[
] the requirement of an effect on U.S. commerce relates to subject matter jurisdiction. Finally, we fail to see the harm to Sherman 
Act criminal prosecutions that concerns the dissent. If the government can't prove to a judge a minimum requirement that activity 
alleged to be in violation of U.S. criminal law had an effect on U.S. commerce, it shouldn't be bringing a Sherman Act case in the

dramatically. Discussions today tend to focus on better ways of coordinating these many national-level regimes, and antitrust 
authorities around the world are eager to cooperate with one another within the confines established by national confidentiality 
laws. "
337,2," The text and commentary of section 415 is also informative: § 415. Jurisdiction To Regulate Anti-Competitive Activities (1) Any agreement in restraint of United States trade that is made in the United States, and any conduct or agreement in 
restraint of such trade that is carried out in significant measure in the United States, are subject to the jurisdiction to 
prescribe of the United States, regardless of the nationality or place of business of the parties to the agreement or of the 
participants in the conduct. (2) Any agreement in restraint of United States trade that is made outside of the United States, and any conduct or 
agreement in restraint of such trade that is carried out predominantly outside of the United States, are subject to the 
jurisdiction to prescribe of the United States, if a principal purpose of the conduct or agreement is to interfere with the 
commerce of the United States, and the agreement or conduct has some effect on that commerce. (3) Other agreements or conduct in restraint of United States trade are subject to the jurisdiction to prescribe of the United 
States if such agreements or conduct have substantial effect on the commerce of the United States and the exercise of 
jurisdiction is not unreasonable. Comment b to this section quotes the FTAIA in full, and goes on to say that ""Congress apparently believed that activity whose 
anti-competitive effects are felt only in foreign states should not be a concern of United States antitrust regulation, but that 
activities carried out abroad that have 'direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable' effect in the United States or on the 
import trade of the United States (as by limiting imports or fixing the price of imported products) should be subject to the 
Sherman and FTC Acts."" "
345,*," The Honorable David W. McKeague, United States District Judge for the Western District of Michigan, sitting by designation."
345,1," HN1[
] Because the Michigan Anti-Trust statute and the Sherman Anti-Trust Act mirror each other, we apply the same analysis to both the federal and state anti-trust claims.  Perceptron, Inc. v. Sensor Adaptive Machs., Inc., 221 F.3d 913, 919 n.6 
(6th Cir. 2002). In any event, plaintiff has not provided a separate analysis under Michigan's statute."
345,2," As a consequence, no claims involving the American Podiatric Medical Association remain. "
346,3," In addition to defendant's large market share (roughly 75), this court noted that defendant charged more for its certification 
services, and therefore evidence existed that would permit a jury to conclude that defendant had pricing power.  Certified 
Podiatric Physicians, 185 F.3d at 623. We also held that a question of material fact existed as to whether defendant was 
protected by a ""reputational"" barrier to entry. Id."
346,4," In opposition, plaintiff relies heavily on  International Travel Arrangers, Inc. v. Western Airlines, Inc., 623 F.2d 1255 (8th Cir. 
1980). In that case, the eighth circuit held that when an airline used false, misleading, and deceptive advertising to counter a 
competitive threat, it violated section 1 of the Sherman Act.  Id. at 1268. In addition, the court held that evidence supported 
findings that the airline, which had monopoly power over certain routes, forced a travel agency to cancel its participation in travel 
group charters.  Id. at 1270. This was held to be a section 2 violation. Id. International Travel Arrangers is distinguishable on at least two grounds. First, the statements at issue in International Travel 
Arrangers were ""false, misleading, and deceptive.""  Id. at 1264. The challenged statements at issue here can hardly be "
347,," characterized as ""false, misleading, and deceptive"" in light of our previous holding. Second, there was a much greater pattern of 
practice in International Travel Arrangers. There was evidence that the defendant airline in International Travel Arrangers tried to 
persuade travel agents to stop dealing with a rival and threatened to retaliate against them.  Id. at 1272."
347,5," Plaintiff cites to  Phototron Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 842 F.2d 95 (5th Cir. 1988), as standing for the proposition that even 
truthful advertising can support a section 2 claim if it creates a barrier to entry. In Phototron, the fifth circuit noted that 
""advertising that creates barriers to entry in a market constitutes predatory behavior that the antitrust laws are designed to 
prevent.""  Id. at 100. The cost to entry that concerned the court in Phototron, however, involved the high costs of purchasing 
advertising to counter a claim or establish one's product in the face of advertising by the monopolist in a traditional consumer 
market.  Id. at 101. In the instant case, the targets of the mailings were sophisticated parties. In addition, the plaintiff can 
respond relatively cheaply through its own mailings, and it presumably can directly contact the individuals targeted by defendant 
and need not engage in a series of expensive media campaigns. Defendant points to uncontested evidence that plaintiff did 
precisely that."
347,6," This test was first suggested in 3 PHILLIP AREEDA & DAVID TURNER, ANTITRUST LAW P 738a, at 278-79 (1978). The 
second circuit in Ayerst also discussed this test favorably, but it is unclear whether they thought each requirement was 
mandatory. See  Ayerst, 850 F.2d at 916-17."
347,7," HN6[
] Advertising that is ""true but misleading"" cannot be said to be strictly procompetitive. However, the Supreme Court has 
cautioned that we should be mindful of the chilling effect antitrust liability can have on permissible competitive conduct. See  
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. 475 U.S. 574, 593-594, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. Ct. 1348 (1986) (""Mistaken 
inferences in [predatory-pricing] cases such as this one are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust 
laws are designed to protect."");  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 762-764, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775, 104 S. Ct. 
1464 (1984) (""Permitting an agreement [in violation of section 1] to be inferred merely from the existence of complaints . . . could "
348,," deter or penalize perfectly legitimate conduct."") Permitting antitrust liability for merely potentially misleading or ""true but 
misleading statements"" would chill procompetitive promotional conduct. Therefore, a plaintiff in an antitrust suit, to survive 
summary judgment, must present evidence that would permit a jury to conclude that the statements at issue were clearly false."
348,8," In deciding that the challenged statements were not deceptive, we previously considered the sophistication of the targeted 
parties.  Certified Podiatric Physicians, 185 F.3d at 616. Thus, we considered the fourth element of the  American Professional 
Testing test (the sophistication of the parties) in deciding the information was not clearly false (the first element)."
348,9," We note that plaintiff has made no allegation that exclusive recognition agreements have excluded it from a significant portion 
of the market. "
349,10," Schachar was a section 1 case, and plaintiff tries to distinguish it as such. However, Hydrolevel, on which plaintiff partly relies, 
was also brought under section 1. See  Hydrolevel, 456 U.S. at 565. HN8[
] Courts have recognized that the same principles, 
although not necessarily the same standards, underlie both sections of the Sherman Act. See, e.g.,  United States v. Microsoft, 
346 U.S. App. D.C. 330, 253 F.3d 34, 70 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (noting that ""the basic prudential concerns relevant to §§ 1 and 2 are 
admittedly the same"" while discussing an exclusive contract claim brought under both sections);  Multistate Legal Studies, Inc. v. 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal & Prof'l Publ'n, Inc., 63 F.3d 1540, 1550 (10th Cir. 1995) (holding that tying may violate both 
sections 1 and 2). We believe that both  Schachar and  Hydrolevel are relevant to our analysis because they both deal with the 
potential to exclude competition and harm rivals, and that is precisely what is being alleged here. As noted before, monopoly 
power is in part the power to exclude."
349,11," Plaintiff also points us to a case recently decided by this circuit that addressed advertisement as part of a broad pattern of 
anticompetitive conduct.  Conwood Co., v. United States Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768 (6th Cir. 2002), involved two distributors of 
moist snuff. In finding that the practices alleged were sufficient as a matter of law to sustain a jury verdict in favor of Conwood, 
this circuit reasoned as follows: USTC [United States Tobbacco Co.] contends that none of the practices Conwood complains of amount to antitrust 
violations, but are no more than isolated sporadic torts. We disagree. Conwood presented evidence that beginning in 1990 
USTC began a systematic effort to exclude competition from the moist snuff market. Conwood presented sufficient 
evidence that USTC sought to achieve its goals of excluding competition and competitors' products by numerous avenues. 
Conwood principally complains that USTC (1) removed racks from stores without the permission of store management and 
discarded and/or destroyed these racks, while placing Conwood products in USTC racks in an effort to bury Conwood's 
products and reduce their facings; (2) trained their ""operatives to take advantage of inattentive store clerks with various 
'ruses' such as obtaining nominal permission to reorganize or neaten the moist snuff section,"" in an effort to destroy "
350,," Conwood racks; (3) misused its position as category manager by providing misleading information to retailers in an effort to 
dupe retailers into believing, among other things, that USTC products were better selling so that retailers would carry USTC 
products and discontinue carrying Conwood products; and (4) entered into exclusive agreements with retailers in an effort 
to exclude rivals' products. Id. at 783. Unlike the case at hand,  Conwood involved a broad pattern of anticompetitive activities, and the complaint did not rest primarily 
on misleading statements. In addition, the court in Conwood recognized the potential for sales managers in stores to be duped 
by the misleading claims, in part because snuff sales were an insignificant part of the retail sales of the stores.  Id. at 776. Also, 
the statements made by the USTC were characterized as false instead of true but misleading. For example, the sales data 
provided by the USTC to retailers was inaccurate. Id."

commerce imposed unilaterally by government officials is not a violation of the federal antitrust statute which requires an 
element of concerted action. Fisher v. City of Berkeley, 475 U.S. 260, 266-67, 106 S. Ct. 1045, 1049, 89 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1986)."

may engage in any business which the municipality has the power to franchise (art. 18, § 6). Under these provisions, 
municipalities are corporate bodies capable of many acts of private corporations as well as acts of government. City of Blackwell 
v. Lee, 1936 OK 767, P 5, 178 Okla. 338, 62 P.2d 1219, 1220. In City of Lafayette, La. v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., supra., the city argued that its status as a municipality automatically 
afforded it state action immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to afford the city the same deference it afforded the states, 
explaining that cities are not sovereign and they are not free to pursue their parochial interests via anti-competitive conduct. City 
of Lafayette, La. v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. at 411-13, 98 S. Ct. at 1136."
363,8," For the most part, the decisions of other sister jurisdictions considering application of the Parker doctrine are inapposite 
because of their respective state statutes. Three states have rejected the federal state action immunity doctrine. Massachusetts 
did so because its antitrust statutes explicitly provided that the law did not apply to any activities subject to regulation or 
supervision by state agencies, Monsanto Co. v. Dept. of Public Utilities, 412 Mass. 25, 586 N.E.2d 982 (1992). New Jersey did 
so because its antitrust statutes specified that the law shall not apply to any activity directed or authorized or permitted by any 
conflicting or inconsistent statute, Fanelli v. City of Trenton, 135 N.J. 582, 641 A.2d 541 (1994). New York, at least by 
implication, determined that its state antitrust statutes did not provide for state action immunity comparable to the federal 
doctrine. Capital Telephone v. New York Telephone, 146 A.D.2d 312, 540 N.Y.S.2d 895 (A.D.3 Dept. 1989). However, three 
states have followed the federal state action immunity analysis. Louisiana did so because its antitrust statute did not expressly "
364,," include or exclude municipalities, Reppond v. City of Denham Springs, 572 So. 2d 224 (La.App.1Cir. 1990). Colorado did so 
because its antitrust statute specifically provided that persons and activities immune from federal law are immune from state law, 
City of Colorado Springs v. Mountain View Electric Association, Inc., 925 P.2d 1378, 1387 (Colo. 1996). Illinois held that an 
airport authority is protected by the state action immunity doctrine in DuPage Aviation Corp. v. DuPage Airport Authority, 229 Ill. 
App. 3d 793, 594 N.E.2d 1334, 171 Ill. Dec. 814 (1992), but subsequently decided that its antitrust statutes expressly provide 
that no provision of the antitrust statutes shall be construed to make activities of a unit of local government illegal, Alarm 
Detection Systems, Inc. v. Village of Hinsdale, 326 Ill. App. 3d 372, 761 N.E.2d 782, 260 Ill. Dec. 599 (2001)."

the Airport Authority to operate the airport as a financially independent utility of the city. City of Tulsa by and through Tulsa 
Airport Authority v. Air Tulsa, Inc., 1992 OK 146, P2, 851 P.2d 519 and P14, 851 P.2d 519, 520 and 851 P.2d at 522. This 
perception of a municipal airport as a proprietary function was changed in the 1947 Municipal Airports Act when the Legislature, 
in § 65.16, characterized the operation of a municipal airport as a governmental function, finding public purpose and public 
necessity. HN24[
] Generally, all functions of a municipality are public in nature whether the municipality acts in a proprietary capacity or 
a governmental capacity. When a municipality acts in a proprietary capacity, it does so as a private corporation for its own 
purposes and benefits separate from the duties and powers imposed upon by the state, however, when a municipality acts in a 
governmental capacity, it does so as an arm of the state for the convenient administration of the government within territorial 
bounds of the municipality, for the public good on behalf of the state rather than for itself. Public Service Co. of Oklahoma v. City 
of Tulsa, 1935 OK 904, 174 Okla. 58, 50 P.2d 166, Syllabus, No. 2.. "
366,," Fine does not challenge the Legislature's ""public purpose and public necessity"" perception of municipal airports. Even though 
the question might ultimately become a judicial one, what constitutes a public purpose and public necessity is a legislative 
matter.  In re Initiative Petition No. 319, 1984 OK 23, P14, 682 P.2d 222, 224. HN25[
] Where there is no allegation or 
evidence challenging the legislative characterization of the public nature of a particular subject matter, the courts will not 
interfere with a legislative declaration of public purposes. Democratic Party of Oklahoma v. Estep, 1982 OK 106, P14, 652 P.2d 
271, 276, footnote 19."
366,12," The Court of Civil Appeals also created a sweeping immunity from antitrust liability for a municipality if the challenged conduct 
is within the ""police power."" HN27[
] Police power is an inherent attribute of sovereignty possessed by every state. State ex rel. Roth v. Waterfield, 1933 OK 546, 29 P.2d 24. The police power pertains to such rules and regulations relating to personal and 
property rights as affect the public health, safety and welfare. 16A C.J.S. Constitutional Law § 432. Tulsa is not exercising 
municipal ""police power"" when it fixes the price of airport parking because such regulation does not affect personal or property 
rights. The case relied on by the Court of Civil Appeals, Ex Parte Houston, 1950 OK CR 93, 224 P.2d 281, does not support the 
proposition that fixing the price of parking at a municipal airport is an exercise of police power."

424,2," The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, 7 U.S.C. § 601 et seq., requires the Secretary of Agriculture to

U.S.C. § 608c(5); see Kass v. Brannan, 196 F.2d 791, 795-96 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 891, 97 L. Ed. 689, 73 S. Ct. 210 
(1952). This is done through FMMOs, which are regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture that require milk handlers in a 
marketing area to pay to milk producers not less than certain minimum class prices established according to how milk is utilized. 
These prices are established under the FMMO after a public hearing at which evidence is received on the supply and demand 
conditions for milk in the market. An FMMO becomes effective only after approval by a certain percentage of dairy farmers.

See also 7 C.F.R. Pt. 1000; see generally United Dairymen of Arizona v. Veneman, 279 F.3d 1160, 1162 (9th Cir. 2002). 
Although an FMMO sets minimum prices for raw fluid milk, it does not set wholesale or retail prices for milk and dairy products. 
(Pl.'s Ex. E at 8.)"
424,3," According to defendants, there were three FMMOs in effect during the class period - the January 1, 2000 FMMO, the January 
1, 2001 amended FMMO, and the FMMO as changed by a January 31, 2001 preliminary injunction issued by the United States 
District Court for the District of Columbia in Select Milk Producers, Inc. v. Glickman, No. 1:01CV00060(RCL) (Order Granting 
Prelim. Inj. Dtd. Jan. 31, 2001). (Defs.' Mem. at 7 & Ex. B.)"
424,4," The complaint alleges that the FMMO formula incorporates the CME butter price or cheese price, whichever is higher. (Comp. 
P 31.) As plaintiff's counsel conceded at oral argument, this is not exactly correct. Plaintiff's counsel stated that this was an 
accurate statement for part of the class period but not for the entire class period. He stated that ""because butter was higher, the "
425,," net result [] throughout the class period, [was that] the minimum was determined based on give or take 3.5 times butter fat price, 
which . . . we contend and we allege was based on CME butter price."" (Hr'g Tr. dtd. 9/4/02 at 37.) Counsel later agreed that, 
except in California, the CME price was not an express component of the FMMO after January 1, 2000 . (Hr'g Tr. at 59.) The regulation in effect prior to 2000 specifically referenced the CME butter price as a basis for establishing the minimum price 
of milk. See 7 C.F.R. § 1001.76 (1999). Those regulations were amended in 2000 to change the source of price data that would 
be used to generate milk prices to the National Agricultural Statistic Service (""NASS"") survey prices. 7 C.F.R. § 1000.50 (2000); 
(Pl.'s Mem. Ex. A); see also USDA Milk Marketing Order Statistics, Price Formulas for 2000 & 2001 (Pl.'s Mem. Ex. D.) Although 
there have been hearings on whether the source should be changed back to CME prices, the current regulations retain the 
NASS survey prices as the source data. 7 C.F.R. § 1000.50 (2003); see Milk in the Northeast and Other Marketing Areas; 
Recommended Decision and Opportunity to File Written Exceptions on Proposed Amendments to Tentative Marketing 
Agreements and to Orders, 66 Fed. Reg. 54064, 54065, 54070-71 (Oct. 25, 2001). Thus, after January 1, 2000, the CME butter 
price was not an express component of the FMMO."
425,5," Plaintiff alleges that the January 1, 2000 FMMO created a substantial incentive for milk producers to increase the CME butter 
price. Plaintiff cites to a petition filed with the USDA by the Milk Industry Foundation and the Ice Cream Association, based on 
USDA data, which asserts that a 10% increase in the CME butter price over the course of a year would result in an increase of 
over $ 400 million in the aggregate FMMO minimum prices for all milk marketed in the United States in 2000. (Comp. P 34.) "
428,6," In the Knevelbaard Dairies case, the plaintiffs were milk producers who claimed that the defendant cheese makers had 
conspired to depress the prices they paid for milk in California by depressing the price of bulk cheese on the National Cheese 
Exchange (""NME""). Milk prices were allegedly lowered because the NME bulk cheese price determined the cost of fluid milk in 
California based on a regulated formula. 232 F.3d at 982. The Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiff-milk producers had alleged an 
antitrust injury and had standing to pursue these claims. Id. at 992."

entered a permanent injunction against Team Obsolete regarding the use of the mark BEARS. Id., at 1006, 1008. In its decision 
awarding the permanent injunction, the court noted that ""Team Obsolete has a history of shifty behavior in its dealings with 
AHRMA …. Team Obsolete may have acted in bad faith when it used the BEARS mark."" Id., at 1006."
467,3," Plaintiffs also allege that in 1998 a flyer was mailed out to many AHRMA members on the day before the 1998 Mid-Ohio event. 
The flyer stated that (according to the Simon Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies) the Holocaust could be attributed to the 
eviction of Adolf Hitler's mother, Klara, in 1921 by a banker named Abraham Rosenstein. The flyer claimed that Rosenstein's 
sole surviving descendant is a grandson raised by Italian brick masons in New York City who goes today by the name Robert 
Iannucci and is a ""successful attorney and noted slumlord."" (Am. Compl., P 131.) Although the flyers were mailed from the same "
468,," town in Ohio where the Mid-Ohio event occurred, plaintiffs do not allege that any of the defendants sent the flyers or caused the 
flyers to be sent. (Id., PP 131-32.) Nor do plaintiffs raise any libel claims."
468,4," Iannucci contends that AHRMA bylaws do not permit the Executive Director to terminate a member and that only the board 
may do so, and then only after a hearing. "
470,5," The AHRMA defendants also note that plaintiffs selectively sued only certain members of the board of trustees, but not others, 
based on what the AHRMA defendants claim are strategic reasons. (AHRMA Def. Reply Mem. at 7-8.) The AHRMA defendants 
do not claim, however, that these other board members are indispensable parties to this litigation, nor do they address why 
plaintiffs should be required to sue all members of AHRMA's board of trustees. "
472,6," Indeed, the Amended Complaint notes that Team Obsolete has been able to stage events despite the alleged conspiracy. 
Although plaintiffs do note that racers are not covered by the ARMOUR insurance policy without AMA's sanction, plaintiffs do not 
allege any where that insurance is otherwise impossible to obtain."
472,7," Since the alleged injury to the individual rider plaintiffs is derivative of Team Obsolete's, they would lack standing for that 
reason as well. See G.K.A. Beverage Corp. v. Honickman, 55 F.3d 762, 766 (2d Cir. 1995). "
473,8," At Sonomafest in 1997, AHRMA and AMA allegedly excluded Team Obsolete from the team display and instructed the track 
announcer to minimize any mention of Team Obsolete. (See Am. Compl. PP104-06.) "
475,9," Since plaintiffs' pleadings make direct reference to violations of the AHRMA's internal rules, those rules are integral to plaintiffs' 
claims and they can be properly considered on a motion to dismiss. See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152-53 
(2d Cir. 2002). "
476,10, These 1995 allegations about Redman are not in the proposed amended complaint.
476,11," It should be noted that AHRMA does not seek to dismiss Team Obsolete's Lanham Act claims relating to the SUPER MONO 
mark. This claim would also provide federal question jurisdiction. "
477,12," Plaintiffs did not withdraw these claims until far more than 21 days after service of the Rule 11 motion, but this is due in part to 
the fact that the parties had negotiated among themselves a longer time for responses (as is proper under this Court's Individual 
Practices), and the claims thus were withdrawn before the motions were to be filed. "
487,1," The plaintiffs in this action are LePage's Incorporated and LePage's Management Company, L.L.C. Inasmuch as we can 
discern no distinction between their interests, we refer to them jointly as LePage's."
487,2," It appears that at least at the times material to this action, there were no other domestic manufacturers of transparent tape. 
There were, however, foreign manufacturers but they did not play a significant role in the domestic market and 3M does not 
contend otherwise. "
488,3," 3M unsuccessfully had moved for a judgment as a matter of law at the close of LePage's case and after the close of the entire 
case. "
489,4," Although 3M originally challenged LePage's selection of the United States as the relevant geographic market, the District Court 
held that LePage's had introduced sufficient evidence from which the jury could properly find that the relevant geographic market 
is the United States and 3M does not challenge that market definition on appeal."
489,5," 3M states that its pricing was above its costs however costs are calculated, and LePage's has not contested 3M's assertion. "
490,6," The three most senior judges of the circuit were, fortuitously, the legendary panel of Judges Learned Hand, Thomas Swan, and 
Augustus Hand. "
493,7," In contrast, the District Court here noted that 3M had conceded that it ""'could later recoup the profits it has forsaken on Scotch 
tape and private label tape by selling more higher priced Scotch tape . . . if there would be no competition by others in the private 
label tape segment when 3M abandoned that part of the market to sell only higher-priced Scotch tape.'"" Le Page's, 2000 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 3087, 2000 WL 280350, at *7 (quoting Defendant's Mem. at 30)."
493,8," The Brooke Group opinions, both for the majority and the dissent, discuss the responses by members of the oligopoly to the 
introduction of discounted cigarettes. Id. at 239-40; id. at 247-48 (Stevens, J., dissenting)."
493,9," Brooke Group is cited in Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 570, 131 L. Ed. 2d 1, 115 S. Ct. 1061 (1995), for the statutory 
construction rule that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning; in Strickler 
v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 300 n.3, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286, 119 S. Ct. 1936 (1999), a federal habeas case, by Justice Souter in his 
partial concurrence/partial dissent, in discussing the term ""reasonable probability;"" and in Weisgram v. Marley Co., 528 U.S. 440, 
454, 145 L. Ed. 2d 958, 120 S. Ct. 1011 (2000), in connection with discussing the weight to be given an expert opinion. "
498,10," The jury's finding against LePage's on its exclusive dealing claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act 
does not preclude the application of evidence of 3M's exclusive dealing to support LePage's § 2 claim. See, e.g., Barr Labs., Inc. 
v. Abbott Labs., 978 F.2d 98, 110-12 (3d Cir. 1992) (considering § 2 of the Sherman Act claims after rejecting claims based on 
the same evidence under § 1 of the Sherman Act and § 3 of the Clayton Act); SmithKline, 427 F. Supp. at 1092, aff 'd, 575 F.2d 
1056 (imposing § 2 Sherman Act liability for exclusionary conduct, after rejecting an exclusive dealing claim under § 3 of the 
Clayton Act)."
498,11," If the dissent's citation to FTC v. Motion Picture Advertising Serv. Co., 344 U.S. 392, 97 L. Ed. 426, 73 S. Ct. 361, 49 F.T.C. 
1730 (1953), suggests that a one year exclusive dealing contract should be considered as per se legal under § 2, that is not 
supported by a reading of the decision. In that case, the FTC had appealed from a decision of the Fifth Circuit holding that 
exclusive contracts are not unfair methods of competition. The Supreme Court reversed, supporting the FTC's decision that the 
exclusive contracts of the respondent (a producer and distributor of advertising motion pictures), unreasonably restrain 
competition and tend to monopoly. It was the respondent who argued that exclusive contracts of a duration in excess of a year 
are necessary for the conduct of the business of the distributors. This argument was rejected by the Supreme Court. The 
Supreme Court's decision did not suggest that exclusive dealing arrangements entered into by a monopolist (which the 
respondent in that case was not), together with other exclusionary action, did not violate § 2 of the Sherman Act."
498,12," At trial, LePage's presented the testimony of James Kowieski, its former senior vice president of sales, who described 
LePage's efforts following Kmart's rejection of its bid. LePage's made a desperate second sales presentation attended by its 
president, App. at 957 (""I felt it was very critical to our company's success or failure, so I insured that Mr. Les Baggett, our 
president, attended the meeting with me.""), where LePage's vainly offered additional price concessions, App. at 959 (""We went 
through the cost savings, the benefits, and we came up with some, again, price concessions, and some programs of a special 
buy once a year, because, I mean, as far as we were concerned, we were on our last leg.""). "
500,13," In one of the two distribution channels available for browsers, Microsoft had locked up almost all the high volume distributors. 
Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 70-71. In the seminal Terminal Railroad case, an association of railroad operators locked up the cheapest 
route across the Mississippi river, the sole railroad bridge crossing at St. Louis. United States v. Terminal R.R. Ass'n, 224 U.S. 
383, 56 L. Ed. 810, 32 S. Ct. 507 (1912). The Supreme Court determined that the defendant's agreement to provide access to 
the bridge to other railroads on discriminatory terms violated § 1 of the Sherman Act."
500,14," In the transparent tape market, superstores like Kmart and Wal-Mart provide a crucial facility to any manufacturer -- they 
supply high volume sales with the concomitant substantially reduced distribution costs. By wielding its monopoly power in 
transparent tape and its vast array of product lines, 3M foreclosed LePage's from that critical bridge to consumers that 
superstores provide, namely, cheap, high volume supply lines. "
501,15," In 1992, 3M's private-label tape sales were $ 1,142,000. By 1997, its private-label tape sales had increased to $ 5,464,222. 
Sealed App. at 489. "
504,16," 3M does not challenge Musika's expert qualifications. Nonetheless, we note that he holds a master's degree in public finance, 
is a former partner at a major accounting firm, and at the time of trial was President and CEO of a business consulting firm. 
Furthermore, Musika frequently has served as a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee, as an expert for various government 
agencies, including the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, and as an expert witness in complex 
cases, including five antitrust cases. "
512,1," 3M also avoids the penalties of a tie-in sale, because its customers were free to purchase its Scotch tape by itself. To prove an 
illegal tie-in, a plaintiff must establish that the agreement to sell one product was conditioned on the purchase of a different or 
tied product; the seller ""has sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in 
the market for the tied product and a 'not insubstantial' amount of interstate commerce is affected."" Northern Pac. Ry. Co. v. 
United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6, 78 S. Ct. 514, 518, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). "
513,2," One court has mentioned a hypothetical situation where a low-cost shampoo maker could not match a competitor's package 
discount for shampoo and conditioner even though both products were priced above their respective costs. See Ortho 
Diagnostic Sys., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 920 F. Supp. 455, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). In that case, the court suggested that the 
bundled price could be unlawful under section 2 even though neither item in the package was priced below cost. If the entire 
package discount were attributed to the one product where the two parties compete, the low-cost shampoo maker could not 
lower its prices on the product enough to match the total discount without selling below its cost. See id. at 467-69. 
Commentators, however, suggests that this analysis is incorrect. See III PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, 
ANTITRUST LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION P 749, at 467 n.6 (rev. ed. 1996). One aspect of this method of calculation worth noting is that the volume of the products ordered has a drastic effect on how 
much the competitor would have to lower its prices to compete. For example, suppose in a similar rebate program, a company 
was the only producer of products A and B but faced competition in C. If a customer orders 100 units each of A, B, and C at a 
price of $ 1.00 each, a 3% rebate would be $ 9.00 (3% of the total of $ 300.00). If the rebate on all three products were attributed 
to product C, then the competitor would have to lower its price to $ 0.91 in order to compete with it. The results would be starkly 
different, however, if a customer orders 100 units of A and B but only needs 10 units of C. Then the 3% rebate on the total 
purchase amount of $ 210.00 would be $ 6.30. If the rebate was attributed solely to product C, then a competitor would have to 
lower its price to $ .37 on product C in order to match the company's price. "
514,3," The closest LePage's comes to supplying such information in its brief is its statement that ""LePage's made repeated efforts to 
save its tape business with Staples, reducing its prices to 1990 levels, and then reducing them again, to keep its plant open and 
people working."" Br. of Appellee at 11. This is not close enough. Of course, LePage's's prices overall were low enough for it to 
have 67% of the private label business. "
516,4," It is more common for charges of exclusive dealing to be brought under section 1 of the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, which 
the jury found that 3M did not violate. See, e.g., Barr Labs., Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 978 F.2d 98, 110 (3d Cir. 1992). "
517,5, While I do not discuss the point I agree with the district court's disposition of the attempted maintenance of monopoly claim. 
532,1," Because of the number of substantially similar state court actions and objections to the pernding settlement, a feasible way to 
sometimes identify complainants and objectors is often by reference to their counsel. In this instance, Larry Norris and Anthony 
Sakalarios were the counsel filing the referenced complaints. Messrs. Norris and Sakalarios also filed the Pitts state court action. 
(Exh. D-3(k))"
532,2," In addition to the above-referenced Bryant Jones and state court actions, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy trustee has petitioned for 
authority to pursue an insurance ""packing"" and ""flipping"" action on behalf of Tower debtors in bankruptcy. (Exh. D-7, P 3, n.2) "
545,3," The Class' other federal claims are plainly insubstantial. HN13[
] No private right of action exists for mail fraud (count XVI) under 18 U.S.C. § 1341, See Bell v. Health-Mor, Inc., 549 F.2d 342 (5th Cir. 1977). The Civil Rights Act of 1964, amended as 
the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (count XII), involves discrimination and has no apparant relationship to contentions actually being 
pursued here. The Class also cannot invoke the due process clause (count XII) against defendants because they are private 
entities. See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 23, 92 L. Ed. 1161, 68 S. Ct. 836 (1948). "
550,4," These barriers obviously suggest significant problems with the 'Class' claim for punitive damages. The issue of punitive 
damages is addressed further below in the context of range of relief available to the Class. (P. 53-57, infra) "
553,5," The court in MONY took the opportunity to point to cases in Texas and California where ""the awards were for terrible personal 
injuries sustained by the victims."" 517 So.2d at 533. In the California case, Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co., 174 Cal. Rptr. 348, 119 
Cal. App. 3d 757 (1981), the punitive award of $ 3.5 million was approximately .005% of Ford's net worth. ""Ford's tortious 
[reprehensible] conduct endangered the lives of thousands of Pinto purchasers."" 119 Cal. App. 3rd at 819."
553,6," Recent action of the Mississippi Legislature reinforces observations of favorable treatment of the Class here. While not 
controlling in this action commenced before passage of the legislation, the Legislature has imposed a cap on punitive damages 
exposure for companies the size of First Tower Corp. of $ 5,000,000. See House Bill No. 19, Civil Justice Reform, § 6; 
December 3, 2002. "
554,7," Objectors' submissions also contest the mode, content and general adequacy of the Notice of Settlement provided the Class. 
The challenges appear, however, largely perfunctory, and notice issues have already been adequately addressed. (P. 12-16; P. 
22-24, supra) Several objectors do raise circumstances peculiar to them which will be addressed in due course. "
555,8," The affidavit of Mary Agee does state she ""attempted to file a claim on [her] disability insurance coverage"" and ""said claim was 
denied."" (Exh. P-1(a), 9/20/01 hearing) Alleged wrongful denial of claimed insurance benefits is not, however, a subject of this 
class action proceeding. (See P. 61,62, infra) "
557,9, Their efforts also resulted in the substantial injunctive relief which is of considerable value.
557,10," The reference here to 14% of the common fund affords no consideration to the benefits of the injunctive relief. HN38[
] When 
ascertaining the benefit of a settlement to the class, a court may consider benefits which are not directly pecuniary in nature. 
See Hall v. Cole, 412 U.S. 1, 7 n.7, 36 L. Ed. 2d 702, 93 S. Ct. 1943 (1973) (benefit associated with relief ""which corrects or 
prevents an abuse which would be prejudicial to the rights and interests of others""). The substantial benefit associated with the 
injunctive relief, although unquantifiable, further corroborates the reasonableness of the attorneys' fees percentage of the 
common fund. "
559,11," The Class Representatives borrowed money from Tower, pledged collateral to secure the loans, and obligated themselves to 
purchase property insurance and credit life or disability insurance which they contend was forced upon them through deceptive 
practices. (Exh. P-1, p. 6-7, exh. A; exh. P-2, P-3) The Class Representatives' status and the claims they are pursuing are no 
different than those of the Class Members, including objectors. Hence, Class Counsel appropriately requested that Claudia 
Smith (Love) and Wilbert Walker be substituted as the Class Representatives; the Court entered the order of substitution on 
November 19, 2001. "
560,12," This quotation appears in the submission of objectors Crystian and Shaffer. Other objectors advance this same erroneous 
proposition. Because counsel for Crystian and Shaffer took the lead at the August 27, 2002 fairness hearing in challenging the 
mandatory certification and other objectors adopted her arguments (8/27/02 Tr. p. 230, 243-44, 279, 305), the Court specifically 
references particular contentions of Crystian and Shaffer as those of objectors generally."
560,13," Indeed, because of the predominance of individual-specific issues, Rule 23(b)(3) certification, an undisputed given here, was 
also unavailable in Allison. See 151 F.3d at 419-20. "
561,14," The three cases cited by objectors are In re Dennis Greenman Securities Litigation, 829 F.2d 1539 (11th Cir. 1987); In re 
Bendectin Liability Litigation, 749 F.2d 300 (6th Cir. 1984); and McDonnell-Douglas Corp. v. U.S. District Court for Central 
District of California, 523 F.2d 1083 (9th Cir. 1975)."
561,15," These two post-Allison decisions are Bolin v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 231 F.3d 970 (5th Cir. 2000), and James v. City of 
Dallas, 254 F.3d 551 (5th Cir. 2001)."
561,16," As with the Rule 23(b)(1)(A) discussion, various objectors' positions on Rule 23(b)(2) applicability are included within the more 
comprehensive challenges of Crystian and Shaffer. The focus here will be on the Crystian and Shaffer written and oral 
submissions recognizing that the other objectors' positions are likewise being addressed. (Compare Docket No. 144, P 5; Docket 
No. 145, PP 1 & 3; & Docket No. 152, P 1 with Crystian & Shaffer submission identified as Docket No. 148 & 8/27/02 Tr. p. 232-
42) "
562,17," The Settlement Agreement is to be evaluated in the context of the reasonableness of the proposed Settlement in light of the 
Class' claims. The Settlement Agreement does not serve as the basis for class certification. That is the function of the amended 
complaint as pursued by the named plaintiffs seeking to serve as class representatives. See Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 
521 U.S. 591, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689, 117 S. Ct. 2231 (1997). For this same reason the limitation of the injunctive relief in the 
Settlement Agreement to a five-year period is not problematic. That the injunctive relief is not permanent goes to the 
reasonableness of the Settlement but not to the genuineness of the equitable relief demands. The time period covered by the 
injunctive relief, just like the specific practices enjoined, was the subject of compromise."
562,18," The quotation in the text is taken verbatim from a representative state court complaint. The subject class action complaint and 
the Bryant Jones class action complaint contain virtually identical language but also include allegations of federal claims."
562,19," The Court previously recognized, however, the release was perhaps overly broad as to claims for failure to pay insurance 
benefits and declined to approve the Settlement Agreement without clarification of the release to except such claims."
562,20," Objectors somewhat frivolously suggest the parties' establishment of the ""Compensatory Damages Fund"" under the 
Settlement Agreement ""amounts to a concession"" that Rule 23(b)(2) cannot be satisfied. From their initial class certification 
motions and related submissions forward, the parties have consistently maintained the monetary relief, whether termed 
equitable or nonequitable, was readily capable of computation without the necessity of individualized hearings. (Exh. D-20, p. "
563,18," -21) As such, any so-called ""damages"" are ""incidental"" under Allison. Moreover, Allison recognizes that claims for punitive 
damages, like those here, may also be ""incidental."" See Allison, 151 F.3d at 417-18. (See also exh. D-20, p. 21)"
563,21," Crystian is a five-time Tower borrower who borrowed as recently as 2001. Shaffer is a six-time borrower with an existing 
relationship with Tower today. It is not credible to suggest borrowers, particularly repeat borrowers such as Crystian and Shaffer 
who continued to borrow after commencement of their state court actions, endured ""pain and suffering"" for allegedly having to 
purchase insurance they did not want. Neither the affidavits of Crystian or Shaffer nor of any other objector intimate any such 
pain and suffering. Special counsel for Crystian and Shaffer also mischaracterized the instances of when her purported clients 
borrowed from Tower. (Compare Docket No. 148, p. 3, with 12/9/02 Tr. p. 10-11, exh. D-57 & exh. D-58.) Further, the unfounded 
allegations of Crystian and Shaffer regarding unliquidated damages conflict with the representations of counsel for the group of 
693 objectors who depicted the value of the compensatory claims to be from several hundred to perhaps several thousand 
dollars, an obvious reference to the amount of insurance premiums and associated charges in issue. (P. 20, supra) "
564,22," Objectors' contentions concerning the alleged necessity of individualized hearings on the FDCPA claims as referenced in Bolin 
are moot. Because the Court has determined below that injunctive relief is not available under the FDCPA, no FDCPA claim is 
being finally certified under Rule 23(b)(2). "
565,23," Such circumstances are a far cry from those in Bolin where the class was composed of bankrupt debtors who, ""since 1988,"" 
had either ""paid money to Sears post-petition, had property repossessed or garnished, or [had] expended legal fees connected 
with Sears's collection efforts."" Bolin, 231 F.3d at 978. Obviously, ""most"" of that class consisted of persons not facing further 
harm from the defendants' actions. Id. Objectors' reliance on McManus v. Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc., 320 F.3d 545, 553-54 (5th 
Cir. 2003), is similarly misplaced. In that breach of warranty action, ""Fleetwood sold its motor homes over a limited period of time 
to limited number of purchasers."" Id. at 554. There was no challenge of ongoing defendant practices or any prospect of future 
defendant conduct affecting any class member. "
566,24," Special counsel were engaged to represent objectors Crystian and Shaffer, persons represented by Bryant Jones counsel in 
the Barnes state court action. Special counsel were engaged to represent the group of 693 objectors, persons represented by 
Bryant Jones counsel in the Barnes, Arbuthnot and other state court actions. (P.18, supra) Mr. Sakalarios, who also represents a 
group of objectors with Mr. Norris, has also appeared on behalf of the group of 693 objectors. (Docket Nos. 152 & 153)"
566,25," Injunctive relief is available under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, but the Court is of 
the opinion the Class is not actively pursuing any such claims. (P. 34, supra)"
566,26," See Citation on page 31, supra "
567,27," The Supreme Court decisions are Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715, 119 S. Ct. 2295 (1999); 
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Epstein, 516 U.S. 367, 134 L. Ed. 2d 6, 116 S. Ct. 873 (1996) (Ginsberg, J., concurring in part 
and dissenting in part); Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628, 105 S. Ct. 2965 (1985)."
567,28," The Ninth Circuit decision is Brown v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 982 F.2d 386 (9th Cir. 1992), writ dismissed as improvidently 
granted, 511 U.S. 117, 128 L. Ed. 2d 33, 114 S. Ct. 1359 (1994)."
567,29," Moreover, beyond the class certification on the merits, Class Members here have been afforded additional ""due process"" 
through the Notice of Settlement and opportunities afforded to object to the Settlement. See Kincade v. General Tire & Rubber 
Co., 635 F.2d 501, 507-08 (5th Cir. 1981) (due process satisfied in Rule 23(b)(2) settlement when notice but no opportunity to 
opt out provided) (cited in Allison at 151 F.3d at 413-14, n.7). "
596,1," HN8[
] It is axiomatic that the initial purchase of a good occurs in the primary market, or foremarket. This initial purchase may, 
in turn, give rise to an ""aftermarket,"" a derivative market consisting of consumable goods or replacement components that must 
be used for the proper functioning of the primary good, but which are usually purchased in a later transaction. Phillip E. Areeda & 
Herbert Hovenkamp, IIA Antitrust Law P 564b (2d ed. 2002). The most prominent case in the foremarket-aftermarket area, the 
Supreme Court's decision in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265, 112 S. Ct. 2072 
(1992), also offers the best practical illustration of the phenomenon. A foremarket in photocopiers, for example, could give rise to 
an aftermarket in photocopier replacement parts. See id. at 456-57."
596,2," Information costs may prevent foremarket prices from constraining prices in the aftermarket because consumers of complex, 
durable goods tend to engage in difficult and costly ""lifecycle pricing,"" assessing ""the total cost of the 'package'-equipment, 
service, and parts at the time of purchase."" Id. Much of the information regarding price data, quality, availability of products 
needed to operate, upgrade, or enhance the initial equipment, service and repair costs, estimates of breakdown frequency, 
nature of repairs, parts and service prices, length of downtime, and losses incurred from downtime is difficult, if not impossible in 
some cases, to acquire at the time of the initial purchase. Id. Moreover, the expense of acquiring and processing such 
information may deter consumers from doing so, particularly ""if the costs of service are small relative to the equipment price, or if 
consumers are more concerned about equipment capabilities than service costs …."" Id. at 474-75. In practical reality, large-
volume, sophisticated purchasers are more likely to undertake such an analysis, and thus obtain competitive prices. See id. at 
475. Switching costs may limit the ability of foremarket prices to constrain those in the aftermarket because ""if the cost of switching is 
high, consumers who already have purchased the equipment, and are thus 'locked in,' will tolerate some level of … price 
increases [in the aftermarket] before changing equipment brands."" Id. at 476. In practical effect, therefore, ""a seller profitably 
could maintain supracompetitive prices in the aftermarket if the switching costs were high relative to the increase in … 
[aftermarket] prices, and the number of locked-in customers were high relative to the number of new purchasers."" Id. "
597,3," An examination of the Kodak opinion also reveals that the Supreme Court intended for its discussion of market power to apply 
to claims brought under both § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act. See id. at 481-83 (""HN11[
] Monopoly power under § 2, requires, of course, something greater than market power under § 1 … The second element of a § 2 claim is the use of monopoly power 
to foreclose competition, to gain a competitive advantage, or to destroy a competitor.""). "
600,4," Moreover, the testimony of ID Security's own expert, Dr. Asher, undermines any conclusion that Checkpoint charged higher 
prices to customers who had already purchased EAS systems than it did to new customers. Dr. Asher testified primarily that 
Checkpoint was a ""uniform price monopolist"" that did not price discriminate between new and installed customers. T.T. 5/9/02 
(doc. no. 176) at 57-58, 60-64. ID Security's theory of the case at trial hinged on this testimony. Therefore, ID Security appears 
to be advancing a different theory in its opposition to Checkpoint's motion for post-trial relief. "
601,5," Indeed, ID Security's evidence at trial suggested that ID Security intended to raise, rather than lower, prices in the RF market. 
Peter Murdoch, President of ID Security Canada, testified that ID Security's intent, upon entering as a competitor in the RF tag "
602,," market, was not, in fact, to charge prices less than those offered by Checkpoint. T.T. 4/30/02 (doc. no. 158) 83-84. In fact, 
Murdoch stated that erroneous assumptions concerning Checkpoint's pricing resulted in ID Security's offering RF tags at a 
lesser price. T.T. 4/30/02 (doc. no. 158) at 83-84, T.T. 5/1/02 (doc. no. 164) at 95-96. "
603,6," Other cases have treated the question as open. See, e.g., Morgenstern v. Wilson, 29 F.3d 1291, 1295 n.2 (8th Cir. 1994); 
Harkins Amusement Enters., Inc. v. Gen. Cinema Corp., 850 F.2d 477, 490 (9th Cir. 1988)."
603,7," Checkpoint points to Dr. Asher's expert testimony in support of this theory, notwithstanding that Dr. Asher cites to no factual 
basis for his opinion. "
604,8," Checkpoint argues that, even if RF tags constituted the relevant market, it could not, as a matter of law, be held liable for 
attempting to monopolize, given that it was already a monopolist holding a 90 percent share of that market. Neither the parties 
nor the court has located any Third Circuit authority recognizing the liability of a monopolist for attempt to maintain monopoly 
power under § 2. See LePage's v. 3M, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 5757, Nos. 00-1368 & 00-1473, slip op. at 45 (3d Cir. Mar. 25, 
2003) (en banc)(declining to reach the issue). But see LePage's v. 3M, 277 F.3d 365, 2002 WL 46961, at *31 (3d Cir. Jan. 14, 
2002) (Sloviter, J., dissenting), aff'd in part and rev'd in part en banc, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 5757, Nos. 00-1368 & 00-1473, slip 
op. (3d Cir. Mar. 25, 2003) (finding a § 2 violation through activity on the part of a monopolist that was designed to achieve 
actual or virtual sole supplier status). In any event, in this case, even assuming that the RF tag market is the relevant product 
market, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Checkpoint's conduct in the RF tag market would constitute an attempt or 
attempt to maintain monopoly. See supra; discussion infra Part II.B.1.d. "
605,9, The jury was not asked to specify on the verdict sheet the market that it had identified as the relevant market in this case. 
606,10," The idea that the EAS systems foremarket constrains the RF tag aftermarket, of course, begs the question of whether, in fact, 
EAS systems are, as the court has determined, the relevant market as a matter of law in this case. "
607,11," The court notes that switching costs, identified in Kodak and its progeny as a relevant consideration in the definition of relevant 
market, see Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 439-40, were argued to the jury, but not specifically addressed or defined in the jury 
charge. Checkpoint did not request such an instruction, and is not now claiming that omitting a reference or definition of 
switching costs is grounds for a new trial."
607,12," In defining the relevant market, Instruction No. 16 urges the jury to consider whether economic forces constrain a firm's 
freedom to act as it wishes; Nos. 17 and 20 emphasize that a relevant market consists of groups of products such that a profit 
maximizing firm that was the only seller of those products likely would impose at least a small but significant and permanent 
increase in the price of those products; No. 19 encourages the jurors to consider commercial realities facing buyers; No. 21 
directs that the jury consider to what extent the market for EAS systems constrains the prices charged in the RF market; and No. 
22 elaborates on information costs."
607,13," For a more detailed discussion of Daubert, see infra Part II.D. "
608,14," As Checkpoint points out, some courts have questioned the continued viability of the overall scheme exception. See Grip-Pak, 
Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 651 F. Supp. 1482, 1498 (N.D. Ill. 1986); United States v. Braniff Airways, Inc., 1978 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 18623, No. SA-77-CR-164, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18623, at *116 n.17 (W.D. Tex. Apr. 3, 1978). Neither Atari nor Kobe 
has, however, been overruled. "
609,15," There is no Third Circuit authority setting forth the elements required for conspiracy to monopolize. In addition to the elements 
listed above, some lower courts within the Third Circuit have also required proof of a fourth element, namely that the antitrust 
defendant enjoy a ""dangerous probability of success."" Urdinaran v. Aarons, 115 F. Supp. 2d 484, 491 (D.N.J. 2000) (quoting 
Farr v. Healtheast, Inc., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8268, No. Civ. A. 91-6960, 1993 WL 220680, at *11 (E.D. Pa. June 9, 1993)). "
610,16," ID Security's proposed instruction is, in actuality, a potpourri of the elements of the suggested § 1 and § 2 conspiracy charges 
set forth in O'Malley, Grenig & Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions. The second and third elements of ID Security's 
proposed conspiracy charge come from § 150.40 of that work, and pertain only to a § 1 conspiracy claim. However, the first 
element of a § 1 conspiracy charge, namely that there be a ""conspiracy among some or all of the defendants … to fix … prices,"" 
O'Malley, supra, § 150.40, is completely absent from ID Security's proposed charge. "
611,17," Although counsel and the court on occasion did refer to the claim as one for conspiracy to restrain trade, see, e.g., T.T. 
5/21/02 (doc. no. 202) at 179-80, 196, 203, these isolated references, in light of the overwhelming evidence that the case was 
tried and submitted to the jury on the basis of § 2, are insufficient to support a claim that the jury returned a verdict on conspiracy 
to restrain trade in violation of § 1, a claim that would not have required specific intent."
611,18," Neither Checkpoint nor ID Security objected any other aspect of the manner in which the jury was instructed on the § 2 
conspiracy claim. Accordingly, the court has not reviewed the jury instructions for any other infirmity."
611,19," There is some debate among the circuits over whether proof of a relevant market and market power, although integral to a 
claim of monopoly, are required in a conspiracy to monopolize claim. Compare, e.g., Salco Co. v. Gen. Motors Co., 517 F.2d 
567, 576 (10th Cir. 1975) (""Specific intent to monopolize is the heart of a conspiracy charge, and a plaintiff is not required to 
prove what is the 'relevant market.'"") with Doctor's Hosp. of Jefferson, Inc. v. S.E. Med. Alliance, Inc., 123 F.3d 301, 311 (5th Cir. 
1997) (""To establish Section 2 violations premised on … conspiracy to monopolize, plaintiff must define the relevant market.""). It 
does not appear that the Third Circuit has taken a position on this issue. The court determines that it need not address the issue 
in this case, because, for the reasons set forth in this section, there is no legally sufficient evidence that Checkpoint and Tokai 
had the requisite specific intent to monopolize either the EAS market, which is the relevant market as a matter of law, or the RF 
tag market. "
612,20," ID Security actually addresses these agreements in the course of its argument concerning a § 1 conspiracy, and offers no 
record citations whatsoever in relation to its § 2 claims. However, considering the basic similarities and degree of overlap 
between § 1 and § 2 Sherman Act claims, see Syufy Enters. v. American Multicinema, Inc., 793 F.2d 990, 1000 (9th Cir. 1986), 
it appears that these five agreements actually constitute ID's strongest proof of conspiracy under both provisions. Accordingly, 
the court will examine them for proof of Tokai's specific intent to endow Checkpoint with monopoly power, either in the RF tag or 
EAS market, in connection with ID Security's § 2 conspiracy claim. "
613,21," It is true, as Checkpoint argues, that if the jury determined that the relevant market was the market for RF tags, the real 
possibility of inconsistency would exist. Checkpoint questions how it could be found to have conspired to monopolize a market in 
which it already held a 90 percent share, i.e., monopoly power. "
614,22," The court notes that in its original motion for post-trial relief, Checkpoint raised two other contentions, (1) that the verdict 
against ID Security on its monopolization claim represented a finding by the jury that Checkpoint lacked the power to inflict an 
antitrust injury by charging supracompetitive prices, and (2) that ID Security failed to allege any harm that resulted from 
Checkpoint's allegedly supracompetitive RF tag prices, since ID Security was free to charge the same high price. See Mem. of 
Law in Support of Def.'s Mot. for Post-Trial Relief, at 32-38. Because ID Security ultimately clarified, however, that its exclusion 
from the RF market, rather than supracompetitive pricing on Checkpoint's part, constituted the basis for its antitrust injury, see 
Mem. of Law by Pl. in Response to Mot. by Def. for Post-Trial Relief, at 58, the court concludes that Checkpoint's original 
arguments, insofar as they incorrectly anticipated those advanced by ID Security, are inapposite to its consideration of whether 
ID Security proved that it suffered a cognizable antitrust injury."
614,23," The court is not persuaded, however, by Checkpoint's assertion that a finding of antitrust injury is foreclosed as a matter of law 
by the logic of Serpa Corp. v. McWane, Inc., 199 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 1999) and Florida Seed Co., Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 105 F.3d 
1372 (11th Cir. 1997), cases in which a distributor unsuccessfully alleged antitrust injury in connection with the loss of its 
distributorship after its sole supplier was purchased by a company with which the supplier had previously competed. In both of 
these cases, the courts concluded that the distributor had not suffered antitrust injury, and thus lacked standing to bring an 
antitrust claim, essentially because the distributor i.e., a sales representative, was neither a consumer nor a competitor, and that 
its exclusion could have no anticompetitive effect. See Serpa, 199 F.3d at 12; Florida Seed, 105 F.3d at 1374-75. The court 
notes that the facts of this case, however, are distinguishable from those of Serpa and Florida Seed. By 1996, Checkpoint and 
ID Security were sharing Tokai as a common supplier of RF tags. As a result of Checkpoint's acquisition of a one-third 
ownership interest in Tokai, T.T. 5/6/02 (doc. no. 171) at 125-26, Tokai was selling a large volume of RF tags to Checkpoint at a 
loss, and made up for its shortfall by selling the remainder to ID and others at an increased price. See T.T. 5/8/02 (doc. no. 177) 
at 195; T.T. 5/13/02 (doc. no. 185) at 52. With a common supplier, Checkpoint and ID Security were aligned to compete directly 
with each other as distributors of RF tags. ID Security was therefore a competitor, rather than a mere distributor, and that its 
exclusion could have an anticompetitive effect and thus constitute a cognizable antitrust injury, is not a conclusion that can be 
foreclosed as a matter of law. As discussed in detail above, however, the fact that ID Security's exclusion had no wider impact 
on competition controls the court's finding that no reasonable jury could have concluded that ID Security suffered an antitrust 
injury in this case. "
615,24," The parties agree that Pennsylvania law supplies the elements of tortious interference with contractual relations. However, 
they disagree over whether the U.C.C., or the International Sale of Goods Act (""IASG"") constitutes the applicable law under 
which the jury was to decide whether a contract was still in existence between ID Security and Tokai at the time that Tokai 
contracted with Checkpoint, or whether material breach and repudiation had terminated that ID-Tokai agreement. The issue of a 
possible conflict between these two laws was raised and discussed during the charge conference, at which all parties and the 
court concluded that there were no material differences between these laws, that the court's proposed instructions were accurate 
under both statutory compilations, and that there was no conflict. See T.T. 5/20/02 (doc. no. 200) at 50-58. Although ID Security 
now strenuously argues the applicability of the IASG, the court concludes, after a comparison of the two statutory sources, that 
there is no outcome-determinative conflict between them, and that, even under the UCC, the code that Checkpoint favors, 
Checkpoint is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on ID Security's tortious interference claim. "
619,25," That Checkpoint's counsel used aspects of its Proposed Instruction No. 44(a) to challenge the charge proposed by the court at 
the charge conference does not preserve any objection with respect to the particular sentence that it now contends should have 
been included in the final charge, but which was, in fact, never specifically brought to the court's attention. In Ryder v. 
Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 128 F.3d 128 (3d Cir. 1997), the Third Circuit addressed preservation in a similar context involving an 
allegedly erroneous instruction that was contained in a paragraph immediately succeeding an instruction that counsel had 
attacked at the charge conference; counsel had never challenged the purportedly erroneous instruction itself before appeal. Id. 
at 135 n.9. The Third Circuit examined the charge and concluded that an objection to the contested instruction at the conference 
""would not have alerted the district judge to the error advanced on appeal,"" that the error had not been preserved, and that plain 
error review was therefore warranted. See id. at 135 & n.9. The same is true in this case. At the charge conference, having 
reviewed the court's proposed charge, Checkpoint referenced its Proposed Instruction 44(a) only to request that the court 
include its proposed instructions on the parties' intent to be bound by a future contract; at no point did it alert the court that it 
should instruct the jury that ""when parties have agreed to enter into good faith negotiations to reach a contract, the failure of the 
parties to finalize the subsequent contract does not entitle one of the parties to enforce what it believes should have been the 
terms of the subsequent contract."" Proposed Jury Instruction No. 44(a). Therefore, the court was not alerted to the error of which 
Checkpoint now complains, and may review the issue untimely raised only for plain error. "
620,26," Proposed Instruction 51(a) is the only proposed instruction that was properly preserved, and is thus subject to plenary review. 
With regard to this instruction only, the court will determine whether, as a whole, the jury instructions as give stated the correct 
legal standard. Ryder v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 128 F.3d 128, 135 (3d Cir. 1997). "
624,27," Checkpoint proposed the following instruction: If a party fails to call a person as a witness who has knowledge about the facts in issue and who is reasonably available do 
the party, and who is not equally available to the other party, then you may infer that the testimony of that person is 
unfavorable to the party who could have called the witness but did not. Proposed Instruction No. 13. "
627,28," Checkpoint now contends that D-38 should be admissible to show Haneda's state of mind, i.e., his dissatisfaction with 
Checkpoint. Given counsel's representations to the court at sidebar, however, this is not the purpose for which the letters were 
offered at trial, see T.T. 5/2/02 (doc. no. 165) at 33. Because Checkpoint did not assert Haneda's state of mind as a basis for 
admission at trial, it may not now do so in a motion for post-trial relief. See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)."
627,29," Checkpoint has reasserted its previously articulated argument that the interests of justice warrant admission of Haneda's 
affidavits, on the theory that Checkpoint otherwise lacked the ability to counter Murdoch's testimony. The court considered this 
argument as it ruled on the motions in limine in this case, and concluded, then as now, that Checkpoint's difficulty in presenting "
628,," its side of the story was equally counterbalanced by the fact that, unlike Murdoch's statements, the truth of Haneda's affidavits 
had ""never been tested on the crucible of cross-examination,"" ID Sec. Sys., 198 F. Supp. 2d at 625. In this context, the crux of 
the arguments on the admissibility of the Haneda affidavits rested, and continues to rest, on Haneda's trustworthiness. That the 
court commented, in connection with the sudden appearance of a new witness for ID Security after Checkpoint had rested its 
case at trial, that it found Mr. Murdoch's testimony concerning the reasons for the witness' appearance, ""not credible,"" T.T. 
5/17/02 (doc. no 196) at 118, does not constitute a finding as to Murdoch's overall credibility, and is, in any event, wholly 
irrelevant to the admissibility calculus that involved only Haneda and occurred before trial. "
630,30," Checkpoint argued strenuously that the court erred in failing to allow it to introduce testimony by Geiges, Austin and Dowd as 
to Checkpoint's knowledge of the existence of a contract between ID Security and Tokai after February 13, 1997. The court has 
since concluded, for the reasons set forth above, that, even though the evidence was properly excluded under Rule 403, 
Checkpoint was correct relative to the general relevancy of that evidence, at least to the issue of damages or to a finding that 
Checkpoint interfered a second time with a contract between ID Security and Tokai. See discussion, supra. Checkpoint now 
takes an inconsistent position in arguing that the court erred in failing to give a jury instruction limiting the jury's consideration of 
Checkpoint's knowledge to the period before February 13, 1997, with respect to ID Security's tortious interference claim."
630,31," Checkpoint's proposed jury instruction stated as follows: If you find that ID has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that as of February 13, 1997 Checkpoint knew of the 
contract between ID and Tokai, and knew that it was interfering with their performance of the contract, then you must find 
for Checkpoint on the tortious interference claim. Def.'s Proposed Jury Instruction No. 49a. "
632,32," The Restatement provides as follows: HN52[
] One who causes harm to the commercial relations of another by engaging in a business or trade is not subject to 
liability to the other for such harm unless: (a) the harm results from …. other acts or practices of the actor determined to be actionable as an unfair method of 
competition, taking into account the nature of the conduct and its likely effect on both the person seeking relief and the 
public; and (b) the acts or practices of the actor are actionable by the other under federal or state statutes … or general principles of 
common law apart from those considered in this Restatement. Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition § 1. "
633,33," ID Security suggested at trial that the issuance of a press release in which defendant allegedly claimed that it had an exclusive 
contract with Tokai to serve as Tokai's distributor might serve as an additional and independent basis for the unfair competition 
claim on the theory that the press release's impact was to suggest unfairly to the world that ID Security was now without a 
supplier. T.T. 5/20/02 (doc. no. 200) at 68-69. The court concludes, however, that the issuance of the press release alone did 
not rise to the level of a common law tort, as would be the case had it defamed ID Security. Therefore, the court concludes that 
there is insufficient evidence to satisfy the ""residual category"" of conduct, which, although not unlawful, may, under certain 
circumstances, be deemed unfair."
633,34," Should the judgment on tortious interference with contractual relations in favor of ID Security be vacated, however, in such a 
case Checkpoint would be entitled to a new trial on this count, given that the court's instructions were not congruent with the 
elements set out in the Restatement (Third) of Torts § 1. "
634,35," HN55[
] The Third Circuit expanded the list of factors to consider in In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., 35 F.3d 717 (3d Cir."
634,1994," ): (1) whether a method consists of a testable hypothesis; (2) whether the method has been subject to peer review; (3) the 
known or potential rate of error; (4) the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique's operation; (5) 
whether the method is generally accepted; (6) the relationship of the technique or methods which have been estbalished to 
be reliable; (7) the qualifications of the expert witness testifying based on the methodology; and (8) the nonjudicial uses to 
which the method has been put. Id. at 742 n.8. "
636,36," ID Security hoped to use the claim that it had a large quantity of tags at a warehouse to infuse prospective customers with a 
level of comfort that, should they choose to place an order with ID Security, the tags would be readily available for delivery."
636,37," The court notes that the fact that Dr. Kursh projected damages through the year 2008 is not, by itself, problematic. Dr. Kursh's 
projections of lost profits were broken down by year. If the jury were to conclude, based on the facts of record, that ID Security 
would have ceased to manufacture Tokai tags in a year prior to 2008, the jury could easily disregard Dr. Kursh's projections as 
to subsequent years. Indeed, it appears that the jury, in awarding ID Security $ 13 million in lost profits on Tokai tags, may have 
stopped the damage clock in 2000 or 2001. "
637,38," Dr. Kursh's testimony at trial tracked closely that which he had offered at the Daubert hearing. An examination of the language 
used by Dr. Kursh during his direct testimony in relation to his Laserfuse lost sales projections reveals their speculative and 
unsupported nature. Dr. Kursh initially conceded that the analysis necessary to estimate lost profits that resulted from the 
alleged delay in the production of Laserfuse was necessarily less ""straightforward"" than that utilized to predict lost profits from 
future Tokai tag sales. T.T. 5/9/02 (doc. no. 176) at 142. Instead, Dr. Kursh's projections are, in turn, based on other projections, 
and, in particular, on what Murdoch told him that ID Security ""expected to sell, [namely] 50 million in the first year, 150 million in 
the second, 500 million in the third and 800 million in the fourth,"" T.T. 5/9/02 (doc. no. 176) at 142, and that Murdoch ""advised 
him"" that ID ""would sell the labels at $ 40 per thousand."" T.T. 5/9/02 (doc. no. 176) at 146. Dr. Kursh further relates that he 
satisfied himself that Murdoch's expectations were accurate because the accounting firm of Arthur D. Little estimated that the 
potential market for RF tags ""is around 30 billion units per year"" and because ""maybe [this] label would have expanded the 
markets for these labels …."" T.T. 5/9/02 (doc. no. 176) at 142-44 (emphasis supplied). Moreover, Murdoch gave Dr. Kursh 
""some broad parameters as to what the production process would entail."" T.T. 5/9/02 (doc. no. 176) at 144 (emphasis supplied). "
639,39," Given the court's resolution of this issue, the court determines that it need not decide whether it erred in construing 
Checkpoint's patent or in showing the two videotapes concerning Laserfuse operation and production. The court also concludes 
that, in light of the fact that Checkpoint will be granted judgment as a matter of law with respect to ID Security's antitrust claims 
and in light of the reduction in damages on ID Security's state law claims, the verdict rendered is not against the great weight of 
evidence. "
651,1, The Court notes that the Complaint paragraph numbering repeats paragraph 31.
651,2," The Court notes that an ""A"" rated hunter and jumper Recognized Horse Show apparently promoted by Plaintiff Cypress Trails 
was the basis of the Federation's denial of Plaintiff Gallagher's proposed horse show dates for 12/14 - 12/16/01 in Belleview, 
Florida. "
653,3," The Court notes that while all of the Defendants raise this basis in their Motions to Dismiss, each Motion to Dismiss differs 
slightly as to the specific element of Plaintiffs' claim which is defective."
653,4," Again, the Court again notes that while all of the Defendants raise this basis in their Motions to Dismiss, each Motion to

654,6," There is slight variation within the Middle District of Florida as to how the elements of a claim under section 1 of the Sherman

that the unreasonable restraint of trade causes actual damage) and  Moecker v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc., 144 F. Supp.2d 1291 
(M.D. Fla. 2001)(requiring that the plaintiff was damaged). "
655,7," The Court notes, however, that in Plaintiffs' Response to Motions to Dismiss, Plaintiffs reference that Defendants ""entered into 
an agreement to divide the market among themselves"" and references that market division agreements are per se illegal. 
Therefore, it is unclear whether Plaintiffs did intend to plead a per se violation of the Sherman Act. "
656,8," The Court notes that HN17[
] while Eleventh Circuit law states that relevant market is a question of fact, the specific issue of whether there is a per se prohibition against dismissal of antitrust claims for failure to plead relevant market under section 1 of 
the Sherman Act has not been addressed. See also  Griffiths v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, 147 F. Supp. 2d 1203, 
1213 (N.D. Ala. 2001)."
656,9," The Court notes that there are several disciplines for which horse show competitions are held and even within the

682,9, We infer from the record that MetroNet passed the increased cost of Centrex features on to its customers.
682,10," In its reply brief, MetroNet misconstrues the bookkeeper's testimony. The bookkeeper testified that in 1999 MetroNet 
experienced billing differences of $ 503,426 between what it paid Qwest for Centrex and what it earned from resale. MetroNet 
claims that the $ 503,426 was a net loss to MetroNet. In other words, MetroNet claims that it paid $ 503,426 more to Qwest for 
Centrex than it earned through resale. It is clear from the transcript of the bookkeeper's deposition, however, that the $ 503,426 
billing difference was a surplus, not a net loss. In 1999, MetroNet resold Centrex for $ 503,426 more than it paid Qwest. The 
bookkeeper's testimony is unambiguous, and thus there is a direct conflict between his testimony and that of MetroNet CEO 
Seeley."

686,16," In its opening and reply briefs on appeal, MetroNet has neither challenged, nor even mentioned, the district court's grant of

689,21," The market also includes T-1 and DSL lines sold to small businesses, though the parties dispute the extent to which these 
products provide small businesses with viable alternatives to 1FB and Centrex lines. The market does not encompass Qwest's 
sales of Centrex directly to end-users because those end users are large, not small, businesses. "
691,22," That Qwest requires customers to purchase access and features together does not in turn require that we look at the bundled, 
rather than the unbundled, price of Centrex components in assessing harm to consumer welfare. Even if the fall in the price of 
access more than offset a rise in the price of features, thereby causing the overall price of Centrex to fall, Qwest could still be 
held liable for anticompetitive pricing on the features component. The question is whether the price of features, and therefore 
Centrex overall, would be even lower were it not for per location pricing. Qwest asserts that its pricing of calling features does not raise antitrust concerns because the pricing of features is unregulated. 
The mere fact that the price of features is unregulated, however, does not negate the undisputed evidence that Qwest's 
imposition of per location pricing raised the price of features far above cost for small business customers. "
692,23," The lack of an effective substitute is also borne out by the fact that as late as October 2000, resellers continued to sell more 
than 60,000 Centrex lines to small business customers. This constituted 31 percent of the total Centrex market (i.e. all Centrex 
lines sold to small, medium and large businesses)."
692,24," It is also undisputed that Qwest imposed per location pricing in order to eliminate the resale market for Centrex Plus. However, 
we note that evidence of intent behind Qwest's conduct is relevant only to the extent that it helps us understand the likely effect 
of Qwest's conduct. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 59. "
694,25," We have ""point[ed] out that the second element is effectively part of the definition of what is an essential facility in the first

694,26," We have ""pointed out that the fourth element basically raises the familiar question of whether there is a legitimate business 
justification for the refusal to provide the facility."" City of Anaheim, 955 F.2d at 1380."
694,27, The parties do not dispute that MetroNet can satisfy the fourth element of its essential facilities claim. 
695,28," Pursuant to the interconnection provisions of the 1996 Act, MetroNet signed an interconnection agreement with Qwest in 
August 2000. MetroNet, however, has not made use of that agreement. Qwest argues on appeal that the interconnection 
agreement proves that Qwest lacks control over an essential facility and that even if Qwest does have such control, it has not 
denied access to MetroNet. MetroNet's CEO Seeley stated in his declaration, however, that ""the wholesale interconnection 
agreement option was not a realistic option at all."" According to Seeley, Qwest refused to include long-distance and voice mail 
services in the agreement, which meant that end users would have to move to another service provider. As a result, according to 
Seeley, MetroNet would lose 30 to 40 percent of its business. The mere fact that MetroNet signed an interconnection agreement 
does not negate MetroNet's evidence that Qwest controls an essential facility and that it denied MetroNet reasonable access to 
that facility. "
696,29," MetroNet cites Lavigne v. Green, 106 Wn. App. 12, 23 P.3d 515, 518 (Wash. Ct. App. 2001); Brinkerhoff v. Campbell, 99 Wn. 
App. 692, 994 P.2d 911, 914 (Wash. Ct. App. 2000); In re Patterson, 93 Wn. App. 579, 969 P.2d 1106, 1109 (Wash. Ct. App.

in Callie v. Near, 829 F.2d 888, 890 (9th Cir. 1987). "
698,31," Except as to the district court's grant of summary judgment adverse to MetroNet on its claim of attempted monopolization, as 
discussed in notes 1 and 16, supra. "
705,1," In its response to Northwest's motion, Spirit somewhat cryptically suggests that its claims rest upon other forms of 
anticompetitive conduct in addition to predatory pricing, but this response identifies little or no such conduct, nor does Spirit 
present any argument in support of any other theory of recovery. At the hearing on Northwest's motion, the Court invited the 
parties to submit statements as to the nature and scope of Spirit's § 2 claims, and the parties have done so. This matter will be 
revisited at the conclusion of this Opinion; in the meantime, the Court, like the parties in their initial submissions, will focus upon 
Spirit's claims of predatory pricing. "
706,2," In 1992, Spirit had four aircraft, serviced four city-pairs, carried 140,931 passengers, and employed about 125 people. By 1995, 
these numbers had increased to ten aircraft, thirteen city-pairs, 583,969 passengers, and roughly 450 employees."
706,3," This Court has discussed the features of Northwest's hub-and-spoke network at length in its rulings in an unrelated antitrust suit 
brought by passengers against Northwest and two other major air carriers, Delta Air Lines and U.S. Airways. See. e.g., In re 
Northwest Airlines Corp. Antitrust Litigation, 208 F.R.D. 174, 179-80 (E.D. Mich. 2002); Chase v. Northwest Airlines Corp., 49 F. 
Supp.2d 553, 556-57 (E.D. Mich. 1999). "
707,4," Spirit substituted a 117-seat aircraft on April 15, 1996, and apparently used the smaller aircraft to service a new DTW-BOS 
route commencing that same day."
707,5, US Airways' fares apparently were comparable to Northwest's.
707,6, US Airways also matched Spirit's lowest fare and added capacity. 
708,7," Northwest responded to this announcement by changing its pricing to match Spirit's fare only on certain flights, primarily those 
departing at around the same time as Spirit's flights. "
709,8," Northwest refers to this latter figure as a ""segment revenue allocation."" FPS uses a standard formula to allocate each 
passenger's revenue among the segments of the overall route."
709,9," This measure necessarily features some double-counting of revenues, as connecting passenger revenues are allocated to 
each segment on which the passenger travels. However, this ""beyond revenue"" is offset by the passenger variable expenses for 
the other segments, as well as a factor known as ""spill,"" which is intended to account for the revenues lost -- e.g., seats which 
are no longer available to local passengers -- as a result of Northwest's accommodation of connecting passengers. "
710,10," ""Taken together, these three cases signal to the lower courts that summary judgment can be relied upon more so than in the 
past to weed out frivolous lawsuits and avoid wasteful trials."" 10A Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary K. Kane, Federal 
Practice & Procedure, § 2727, at 468 (1998) (footnote omitted). "
711,11," Spirit's complaint also cites Northwest's allegedly unlawful exercise of control over gates at Detroit Metro as another form of 
anticompetitive conduct. As noted earlier, however, the parties' initial briefs in support of and opposition to Northwest's motion 
focus almost exclusively upon Spirit's allegations of predatory pricing. The Court will address Spirit's other examples of allegedly 
anticompetitive conduct at the conclusion of this Opinion."
711,12," The Court noted that there was a ""conflict among the lower courts over the appropriate measure of cost,"" but found it 
unnecessary to resolve this issue ""because the parties in this case agree that the relevant measure of cost is average variable 
cost."" 509 U.S. at 222 n.1, 113 S. Ct. at 2587 n.1. Likewise, in the present case, the parties and their experts initially appeared to 
agree that average variable cost is the appropriate measure. At the December 12 hearing, however, Spirit's counsel suggested 
that average total cost is also a relevant measure. The Court addresses this issue below. "
713,13," There maybe limited exceptions to this general rule, such as promotional pricing intended to establish a firm's presence in a 
market, or the selling-off of obsolete products before exiting a market. See A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc. v. Rose Acre Farms, Inc., 
881 F.2d 1396, 1400 (7th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1019, 110 S. Ct. 1326, 108 L. Ed. 2d 501 (1990); Arceda & Turner, 
supra, at 713-14. No such exception applies here, however. "
714,14," The difficulties of proof are amply demonstrated by the parties and their experts in this case, with the two sides suggesting a 
variety of competing measures of whether Northwest merely matched or instead beat the fares offered by Spirit. Northwest 
focuses on its published prices, which never dropped lower than Spirit's fares, while Spirit's experts opine that two or three 
percent of Northwest's passengers during the relevant period actually paid fares less than Spirit's lowest fares. Given these 
different, seemingly legitimate approaches to the ""matching"" inquiry, there is little if any virtue in a ""meeting competition"" defense 
as a purported ""bright line rule"" that would allow a firm to make pricing decisions without fear of antitrust liability. Indeed, Northwest's expert, Janusz A. Ordover, seemingly acknowledges as much. In opining that fare-matching should not be 
""regarded as evidence of anticompetitive conduct,"" Dr. Ordover notes that the airlines frequently change their fares, leading to 
""thousands of daily fare actions in the industry,"" and he reasons that a plaintiff's appeal to fare-matching would ""require the fact 
finder to assess complicated calculations of quality differentials."" (Defendant's Motion, Ex. 3, Ordover Rep. at 5-6.) The Court 
agrees, and finds this same reasoning equally applicable to a defendant's appeal to fare-matching as a per se bar to liability. A 
focus upon below-cost pricing, in contrast, is far more workable and amenable to on-the-spot use in pricing decisions -- a firm 
need only compute its own costs (something it presumably would do anyway) to determine how much it may lawfully reduce its 
prices without running afoul of antitrust law."
714,15," The Court recognizes that the District Court in AMR Corp., supra, construed Richter Concrete, D.E. Rogers, and other 
decisions as recognizing a ""meeting competition"" defense to a claim of predatory pricing. See AMR Corp., 140 F. Supp.2d at 
1204-08. Yet, these decisions all predated Brooke Group by a number of years, and AMR Corp, does not address the possible 
impact of this intervening Supreme Court ruling. In addition, this Court already has explained why, in its view, Richter Concrete 
and D.E. Rogers do not truly adopt a ""meeting competition"" defense. Finally, the Court notes that AMR Corp.'s application of this 
defense rested in part upon the premise that price-matching ""cannot create the kind of market position that the prohibition of 
predatory pricing was meant to preclude."" AMR Corp., 140 F. Supp.2d at 1205 (internal quotations and citation omitted). To the 
extent that this is meant to suggest that mere matching can never be exclusionary, the Court again observes that this premise 
remains open to question in this case, and that, in any event, the economic theory underlying this premise differs from the model 
adopted in Brooke Group. Thus, the Court respectfully declines to follow AMR Corp, on this point. This is not to say, however, that the Brooke Group standard is utterly incompatible with any sort of match-versus-beat inquiry. 
Under the second prong of this standard, for instanceHN14[
] , a plaintiff must show a dangerous probability of recoupment, 
which entails, among other things, proof that the defendant's below-cost pricing was capable ""of producing the intended effects 
on the firm's rivals,"" Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 225, 113 S. Ct. at 2589 -- in this case, driving the rival from the market. If the 
defendant merely matches the plaintiff's prices, it cannot be assumed that this will drive the plaintiff out of the market -- the 
plaintiff, after all, presumably has set its prices at a sustainable level that produces a profit. Accordingly, Northwest is free to "
715,," offer its price-matching evidence to rebut Spirit's proof as to recoupment, and for any other purposes that it deems appropriate. 
The Court merely declines to grant dispositive weight to this evidence."
715,16," HN15[
] The comparison of price to average variable cost is often referred to as the ""Areeda/Turner"" test. See D.E, Rogers,"
715,718," F.2d at 1436-37; Richter Concrete, 691 F.2d at 823-24. See generally Arceda & Turner, supra, at 716-18 (advocating the 
use of average variable cost as a surrogate for marginal cost, which often is difficult to ascertain)."
715,17," HN17[
] Average total cost is derived by adding ""fixed, or long run, costs to variable costs."" Richter Concrete, 691 F.2d at"
715,821, n.3. 
716,18," Notably, the Sixth Circuit's three-tiered predatory pricing standard derives from a Ninth Circuit decision which adopted this 
""modified Areeda/Turner"" test. See D.E. Rogers, 718 F.2d at 1436-37 (quoting William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT 
Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014, 1035-36 (9th Cir. 1981)). Yet, it appears that the Ninth Circuit no longer adheres to 
this standard in the wake of Brooke Group. See, e.g., Pool Water Products v. Olin Corp., 258 F.3d 1024, 1035 (9th Cir. 2001) 
(equating predatory pricing with pricing below an appropriate measure of costs). "
717,19," As will be seen below, it turns out not to matter much whether one considers Northwest's average variable costs or its average 
total costs, because Spirit does not fare particularly well under either measure. "
718,20," If one instead uses the cost component of the VABSO+ measure, these per-passenger costs increase by roughly $ 8 to $ 10."
718,21," The sole exception, once again, would be the DTW-BOS route in May of 1996 using the VABSO+ cost component."
718,22," This result holds true for each month of alleged predation in the DTW-BOS market, but the outcome of this comparison is 
more equivocal during the period where Northwest's lowest DTW-PHL fare was $ 69 rather than $ 49. "
719,23," Dr. Elzinga notes that this approach finds support in airline industry studies, which frequently distinguish between ""business"" 
and ""leisure"" travelers. He further observes that the airlines seek to take advantage of this distinction through their use of ""yield 
management"" techniques, which are intended to control the number of seats on each flight that are available to passengers 
traveling in the various fare classes. "
720,24," As observed by Northwest, this suggests the possibility that Spirit's proposed ""price-sensitive"" and ""price-insensitive"" markets 
were after-the-fact inventions, developed only once it became evident that the price/cost comparisons in the ""all passenger"" 
markets were favorable to Northwest's position. "
722,25," The Court cannot say, of course, why Spirit fails to propound such a feature-based segmentation of the product market. It is 
worth noting, however, that at least some of these feature-based submarkets presumably would not produce the negative 
revenue-to-cost comparison sought by Spirit. It could be contended, for example, that the parties compete for unrestricted-fare 
passengers, since Spirit sells most of its tickets without minimum-stay or advance-purchase restrictions. Yet, this would sweep in 
many of Northwest's business or ""price-insensitive"" travelers, who tend to pay higher fares, and therefore would be more likely to 
generate revenues in excess of the costs incurred in servicing these passengers. Indeed, most of Northwest's passengers 
during the period of alleged predation would fall into this ""unrestricted-fare"" submarket, since the airline suspended most of its 
fare restrictions in response to Spirit's entry into the DTW-PHL and DTW-BOS markets. "
723,26," This appears, in fact, to be Spirit's position. As discussed earlier, Spirit argues that Northwest could have adopted a more 
modest competitive response to Spirit's entry into the DTW-PHL and DTW-BOS markets, with fare reductions targeted more 
specifically at those passengers most likely to choose Spirit. Instead, Spirit charges that Northwest selected its most aggressive 
response, slashing fares across the board on all its flights."
723,27," To the same effect, Spirit's post-hearing submission includes graphs indicating that, immediately before and after the period of 
alleged predation, Northwest generated sixty to eighty percent of its revenue on the DTW-PHL and DTW-BOS routes from its 
purported ""price-insensitive"" passengers, and twenty to forty percent of its revenue from ""price-sensitive"" passengers. This trend 
was reversed during the period of alleged predation, however, with ""price-sensitive"" passengers accounting for seventy to eighty 
percent of Northwest's revenue. Again, one is left to wonder how Northwest produced overall positive revenues during this 
period, given the substantial drop-off in revenues derived from its profitable ""price-insensitive"" passengers and the 
corresponding increase in seemingly unprofitable low-fare passengers. "
724,28," The financial difficulties of the major airlines have been widely reported. Indeed, as noted by the Court at the December 12 
hearing, it appears that Spirit unfortunately has chosen to challenge Northwest on two of the rare routes where Northwest has 
turned a profit."
724,29," Given this conclusion, the Court need not address Northwest's two remaining arguments in support of its motion -- namely, 
that the evidentiary record is inadequate as a matter of law to establish either (i) Northwest's possession of monopoly power in 
the relevant markets, or (ii) the airline's likelihood of recouping any losses it incurred as a result of its allegedly below-cost fare 
structure. In both cases, Northwest's principal premise is that it would be relatively easy for competitors -- and, experience 
shows, it was reasonably easy for Spirit -- to enter the DTW-BOS and DTW-PHL markets. Given these purportedly low barriers 
to entry, Northwest surmises that the circumstances would not have permitted either the acquisition of monopoly power or the 
recoupment of any short-term losses suffered during the period of predation. Were the Court to reach these issues, it likely 
would conclude that these matters, as opposed to the parties' dispute over Northwest's below- or above-cost pricing, turn upon a 
""battle of the experts"" that is properly resolved by the trier of fact. This leaves only the question whether anything remains of Spirit's claims in this case. As noted at the outset, Spirit alleges that 
Northwest engaged in other forms of anticompetitive conduct apart from predatory pricing, but the parties' current round of 
submissions addresses only the latter theory of recovery. To resolve this uncertainty, the Court invited the parties at the 
December 12 hearing to submit statements of the remaining issues in this case in the event that Northwest's summary judgment 
motion were granted. In its submission, Spirit maintains that portions of its claims for damages and injunctive relief would remain 
viable even in the face of such an adverse ruling. Nonetheless, Spirit then states that these ""remaining portions, unaccompanied 
by Northwest's act of predatory pricing, do not warrant the time, money and resources necessarily involved with the prosecution 
of the remaining portions of the federal antitrust action."" (Plaintiff's Post-Hearing Statement of What Remains at 3.) 
Consequently, the Court's award of summary judgment to Northwest leaves nothing further to resolve in this case."
724,30," In light of this ruling, the Court need not resolve Northwest's August 30, 2002 motion challenging two expert reports and an 
affidavit submitted by Dr. Keith B. Leffler on behalf of Spirit. The Court notes, in any event, that these expert materials proved 
inconsequential to the disposition of Northwest's summary judgment motion. Accordingly, Northwest's August 30, 2002 motion to 
strike is DENIED AS MOOT. "
735,1," First, the Court noted that HN10[
] whenever a seller with monopoly power in the tying product market (by virtue of a patent) 
attempted to expand that power into another market, anticompetitive effect in the tied product market could be presumed. Id. at 
16 (citing United States v. Loew's, Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 9 L. Ed. 2d 11, 83 S. Ct. 97 (1962); United States v. Paramount Pictures,

12 (1947); IBM v. United States, 298 U.S. 131, 80 L. Ed. 1085, 56 S. Ct. 701 (1936)). Second, the Court noted that if a seller's 
""share of the market [in the tying product] is high"" or if it ""offers a unique product that competitors are not able to offer,"" a court 
could also conclude that ""the likelihood that market power exists and is being used to restrain competition in a separate market 
is sufficient to make per se condemnation appropriate."" Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 18 (citing Fortner, 394 U.S. at 495; N. Pac. "

latter point, the Court explained in Northern Pacific Railway that tying agreements ""are unreasonable in and of themselves

744,*," The Honorable Dan Aaron Polster, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation."
744,1," Mike Van Ryn is a former University of Michigan hockey player. Van Ryn was drafted by the New Jersey Devils, an NHL 
hockey team, while still a student at Michigan. In June 1998, the Devils acquired the exclusive rights to negotiate with and sign 
Van Ryn. Van Ryn played hockey for Michigan during the 1998-1999 season. After that season, Van Ryn decided to explore his 
options to become a professional hockey player. Van Ryn took advantage of the OHL rule in effect at that time, which allowed 
clubs to sign overage players regardless of where they had played the previous season, and he signed with the Sarnia Sting. 
Pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the NHL and the NHLPA, if New Jersey did not sign Van Ryn 
by June 1, 2000, he would become a free agent. Therefore, by signing with the Sting, Van Ryn believed that he would become 
an unrestricted free agent, which would have allowed him to sign with any NHL team. New Jersey, however, declared that Van 
Ryn's decision to play for the Sting rendered him a ""defected"" player under the CBA, thereby preventing him from becoming an 
unrestricted free agent. The NHLPA filed a grievance on Van Ryn's behalf challenging New Jersey's position and the NHLPA 
prevailed. Van Ryn then signed with the St. Louis Blues, another NHL team, and received higher compensation than the Devils 
offered him. Shortly thereafter, the OHL teams agreed to the new Van Ryn Rule, effectively barring twenty-year-old United 
States college players from playing in the OHL. "
745,2," Appellants attempt to appeal the district court's decision denying their motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds. 
Appellants argue that the order is appealable because it served as a basis for granting the injunction and was therefore 
inextricably intertwined with the district court's ruling granting the preliminary injunction. HN1[
] An appellate court has 
discretion to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction ""where the appealable and non-appealable issues are inextricably 
intertwined,"" meaning ""when . . . resolution of the collateral appeal necessarily resolves the pendent claim as well.""  Brennan v. 
Township of Northville, 78 F.3d 1152, 1157-58 (6th Cir. 1996) (quotations omitted). In the present case, a resolution of the 
appeal of the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction does not necessarily resolve the issue of whether Michigan is a 
proper forum. Moreover, HN2[
] the decision of whether to dismiss a case under the doctrine of forum non conveniens rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the denial of such a motion is not an appealable interlocutory order under 28 
U.S.C. § 1292. See  Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 529, 100 L. Ed. 2d 517, 108 S. Ct. 1945 (1988). Therefore, we 
decline to consider appellants' appeal of the district court's denial of appellants' motion to dismiss for forum non conveniens. "
748,3," Appellees argue that the district court considered and rejected appellants' proffered justifications for the Van Ryn Rule. The 
district court, however, clearly stated that it was applying the per se rule and inserted a footnote at the end of its merits analysis 
noting that the cases cited by defendants in support of the application of the rule of reason were ""distinguishable on the facts."" "
749,4," The fourth factor in determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction asks whether the public interest is advanced in issuing 
the injunction. The district court found this factor weighed in favor of appellees because ""the public interest is best served by 
promoting competition."" Because appellees have failed to establish a likelihood that the Van Ryn Rule injures economic 
competition, however, the public interest no longer weighs in favor of granting a preliminary injunction. "

any other person acting on behalf of the employer who violates, or causes to be violated, the provisions of this order, shall be 
subject to the civil penalty of [¶] (1) Initial Violation—$ 50.00 for each underpaid employee for each pay period during which the 
employee was underpaid in addition to the amount which is sufficient to recover unpaid wages. [¶] (2) Subsequent Violations—$ 
100.00 for each underpaid employee for each pay period during which the employee was underpaid in addition to an amount 
which is sufficient to recover unpaid wages.” "
766,5," Section 558, subdivision (a) states: HN9[
] “Any employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer who violates, or 
causes to be violated, a section of this chapter or any provision regulating hours and days of work in any order of the [IWC] shall 
be subject to a civil penalty as follows: [¶] (1) For any initial violation, fifty dollars ($ 50) for each underpaid employee for each 
pay period for which the employee was underpaid in addition to an amount sufficient to recover underpaid wages. [¶] (2) For 
each subsequent violation, one hundred dollars ($ 100) for each underpaid employee for each pay period for which the 
employee was underpaid in addition to an amount sufficient to recover underpaid wages.”"
766,6," Section 1194 states: HN10[

than the legal minimum wage or the legal overtime compensation applicable to the employee is entitled to recover in a civil 
action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum wage or overtime compensation, including interest thereon, 
reasonable attorney's fees, and costs of suit.”"
766,7," In arguing that the Legislature did not intend to impose civil liability on individuals, respondents note that Assembly Bill No. 
2509 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.), which was passed in 2000, deleted a provision that would have provided that “substantial 
shareholders in a corporation would be jointly and severally liable with the corporation for unpaid wages and penalties.” (Assem. 
Com. on Labor and Employment, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2509 (1999–2000 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Feb. 24, 2000, p. 9.) 
That deleted provision, however, applies to shareholders, not officers and directors, and thus is not entirely on point. "

software, including the MVS, VM/ESA, and VSE/ESA operating system software. "
784,3," No doubt IBM did not proffer the Richardson and Hummel Declarations (or equivalent information) along with the original 
motion papers because it did not anticipate CDS's motion. In this Court's experience, it is unprecedented to have reputable 
counsel (or any counsel, for that matter) challenge the authenticity of deposition transcripts, discovery responses, and 
documents produced from his client's files. "
785,4," At the relevant time, Mr. Burke was associated with Cravath Swain and Moore, the law firm representing defendant. "
789,5," The relevant geographic market is not in dispute. CDS pleads, and IBM agrees, that the relevant geographic market is 
worldwide. (Plaintiff's Sec. Amd. Cmplt., P 73; Defendant's Mem. in Support of Summary Judgment, p. 4.) "
790,6," The testimony of both IBM and CDS employees suggests that one factor behind this substantial migration was that computer 
software, not hardware, drover customers' purchase decisions. (Holstom Dep. 79: 21-25, Ex. 11A to Burke Dec.; Port Dep. 
204:23-205:8, Ex. 17C to Burke Dec.) Since 1997, more applications were being written for UNIX and Windows NT than for

795,8," CDS argues that IBM ""acknowledges"" that IBM customers are locked-in, quoting a document where an IBM employee states. 
""… we do not need this upstart company [CDS] wedging its way into a marketplace we should have locked-in the low end 
arena."" (Plaintiff's Opp., p. 2, quoting Ex. 12 to Williams Dec.) First, the statement that something ""should"" be done implies that it 
has not yet been done. More important, a statement by an employee regarding ""locking-in"" business or customers is not an 
admission by the company of the existence of a ""lock-in"" effect for antitrust purposes. "
797,9," The record evidence does not clearly establish that there is a definable ""low end"" market within the computer systems market. 
There are some IBM documents that discuss the ""low end"" of the market (usually defining the low end in terms of processing 
power). This distinction may be one that IBM makes for marketing and strategic planning purposes. Or it may indicate that there 
is a distinct product market at the lower cost/lower processing power end of the market. However, there is no concrete data that 
suggests that the relevant product market must be subdivided in such a way, and it is unnecessary to hypothesize about 
whether such line-drawing is appropriate. The evidence presented shows that IBM had a relatively small, and declining, market 
share of both the computing system market as a whole and at the ""low end"" specifically."
797,10," IBM's expert, Carl Shapiro, defined the ""low end"" by price bracket, rather than by processing power, and analyzes the data 
within that framework. The data in Tables 3 and 4 is for all computers in the $ 250,000 or less price bracket (defined by Shapiro 
as the Entry and Midrange Systems), and includes both IBM and CDS Systems. "
799,11," As noted above, this Court previously dismissed Count I of CDS's complaint, which alleged a Sherman Act § 1 violation for per

] The Corporation Counsel may bring a civil action in the name of the District of Columbia as parens patriae on behalf 
of any individual residing in the District of Columbia in any court of competent jurisdiction for injury sustained by such individual 
to such individual's property by reason of any violation of [the Antitrust Act]. (1) The court shall award the District of Columbia, as monetary relief, threefold the total damages sustained by such natural 
persons, and the cost of suit, including reasonable attorney's fees. (2) Monetary relief recovered in an action under this subsection shall: (A) be distributed in such manner as the court may authorize; or (B) be deemed a civil penalty by the court and deposited with the District of Columbia, subject in either case to the requirement 
that any distribution procedures adopted shall first afford each person a reasonable opportunity to secure each such person's

843,4, Mr. Owen and Ms. Huybens are both residents of the District.
843,5," In paragraph 16 of their January 2002 motion to intervene, the Owen consumers state: Consumer intervenors object to the proposed consumer class settlement because the class counsel have a conflict of interest in 
representing both the consumer class members and the commercial class members. The commercial class members will 
receive their proportionate share of the commercial class settlement amount of $ 2,233,000. The consumer class members do 
not receive their proportionate share of the consumer class settlement because their share has been allocated to a political 
subdivision, a not-for-profit corporation, or a charitable organization. As the remedy for the commercial class is radically different 
from the remedy afforded the consumer class, it is inappropriate for counsel to purportedly represent both classes."
843,6," As the consumer class member objectors indicate in their brief, $ 107,625,000 was allocated to the commercial class and $ 
107,625,000 to the consumer class. The District's share of the consumer class settlement funds ""includes $ 522,000 to be paid 
into a District of Columbia Class Escrow Account, for future distribution to designated charities and non- profit groups, and $ 
48,000 into a District of Columbia State Economic Impact Fund Escrow Account."" "
846,7," The consumer class member objectors claim that not many consumers will seek a cash distribution; therefore, the distribution 
system would be manageable. No record evidence supports this claim. Equally significant, even if such evidence were part of 
the record, distribution of all of the District's consumer class settlement funds to a handful of consumers would represent a 
windfall to them, and would not achieve the same objectives as would a cy pres distribution."
846,8," ""The term 'cy pres' appears to derive from the Norman-French term 'cy pres comme possible,' meaning 'as near as possible.'

846,9," We approved the ""deposit of [civil] penalty [funds] in the [District of Columbia] antitrust fund"" under D.C. Code § 28-4516 
because of ""the sheer impracticality of providing individual compensation under D.C. Code § 28-4507 (b)(2)(B)."" As we pointed 
out, ""very few consumers could be expected to have kept receipts or other proof of purchase for soft drinks, purchased four to 
five years earlier, and the amount estimated to be due each affected consumer was about forty-five cents. Thus the trial court 
sensibly concluded that the costs of distributing the recovery to affected purchasers would greatly exceed any individual benefit 
to them.""  Shepherd Park, supra, 584 A.2d at 26. "
847,10," See Stan Karas, Note, The Role of Fluid Recovery in Consumer Protection Litigation: Kraus v. Trinity Management Services,

A Cy Pres Solution to Undistributed Funds in Consumer Class Actions,  38 HASTINGS L. J. 729 (April 1987). The DeJarlais 
Note indicates: ""In the class action context, cy pres mechanisms have become both useful and controversial means of 
distributing benefits to the 'next best' class when injured class members, for whatever reason, cannot be compensated 
individually.""  Id. at 730 and n.11. The cy pres distribution in class actions is deemed controversial because there are two 
separate schools of thought regarding such distributions. One school insists that class counsel have a fiduciary duty to ensure 
direct distribution to class members; the other advocates the cy pres distribution for circumstances where the cost of individual 
distribution is prohibitive or the fund is too small to warrant individual recovery. See Stephen Gardner, National Association of 
Consumer Advocates Standards and Guidelines for Litigating and Settling Consumer Class Actions, 772 PLI/Comm 441, 469 
(1998)."
847,11," There is statutory support for the appropriateness of a cy pres distribution in the District. For example, HN13[
] § 28-3911 (a) of the Consumer Protection Procedures Act recognizes that ""cy pres payments [may be] made to support consumer protection 
activities by the Corporation Counsel,"" and may be deposited into a Consumer Protection Fund, which is akin to the type of 
distribution anticipated in this case. In addition, § 28-4508 (c) of the Antitrust Act permits purchasers involved in a consumer 
class action to prove damages ""on a class- wide basis, without requiring proof of such matters by each individual member of the 
class."" And while this subsection provides a formula for calculating ""the percentage of total damages attributable to a member of 
[the consumer] class,"" it does not prohibit a class-wide solution in the form of a cy pres distribution. "

888,1," A companion opinion, G030551, involves an appeal from the denial of a preliminary injunction."
888,2," In our previous opinion we said that counsel's dismissal was not the ""'better practice,' but certainly one that is understandable 
given the natural inclination of trial attorneys to try to stay on the good side of a judge."" (South Coast Cab Co., Inc. v. The City of 
Anaheim, supra, G026197 at p. 5, fn. 4.) In the briefing in this case, counsel has opined that she would doubtless have been 
sanctioned by Judge Chaffee if she hadn't dismissed the additional causes of action. The comment raises a host of interesting 
jurisprudential questions regarding the perverse incentive effects created when lawyers generally perceive that they will be 
readily subject to sanctions (e.g., under section 128.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure) for making frivolous arguments. Consider 
what happened here on two levels. First, judicial economy was ill-served. The voluntary dismissal ultimately created extra work 
for everybody in this case as well as the previous appeal (more so for the lawyers in this appeal than for us, though). Second, 
the voluntary dismissal was substantively incorrect: As it turned out, and as we explained at length in our prior opinion, the 
Unruh Act and antitrust remedies weren't precluded on the theory that mandate was the exclusive remedy. The court having 
looked like it was about to sneeze, there was no need for the litigant to have prematurely caught a cold in anticipation of that 
sneeze. "
896,1," Defendants offer the following sample transaction. A consumer purchases $ 100 worth of goods from a merchant by charging 
his paymept card. The merchant then receives $ 93.40 from the acquiring bank, representing the face value of the transaction ($ 
100) minus a 1.6% merchant discount ($ 1.60). The acquiring bank receives $ 98.75 from the issuing bank, representing the 
purchase price minus a 1.25% interchange fee. For its payment, the issuing bank receives the right to charge the cardholder the 
full $ 100 payment price in addition to any interest that might accrue on the transaction. The acquiring bank makes a net profit 
equal to the difference between the merchant discount and the interchange fee, or $ 0.35 from this transaction. "
899,2," Plaintiffs offer various other differences between the present action and NaBanco. Many distinctions are irrelevant for the 
issues faced by the court in this motion. Others, such as the allegation that ""the interchange fee is a sharing of revenue and a 
compensation among competitors,"" (FAC at P 20(b)), are not facts but rather conclusions and characterizations. Such 
unwarranted inferences do not bind 11215 court simply because they are stated as allegations in the complaint. Arpin, 261 F.3d 
at 923. Plaintiffs also attempt to distinguish their claims from those of the Plaintiff in NaBanco by arguing that the mature of their claim 
differs because they are merchants who accept credit cards rather than participants in the joint ventures of Mastercard or Visa. 
(Opp. Br. at 5-1l.) It is true that the NaBanco Plaintiff suffered a different injury from the ones Plaintiffs claim here. As a business 
which provided only acquisition services, not card issuing services, the NaBanco plaintiff claimed that the interchange fee 
prevented it from competing effectively with institutions which provided both services. The merchant plaintiffs in this case allege 
that the lack of competition between acquiring banks causes injury by inflating merchant discounts. While the injury which 
provides standing to the Plaintiffs here and in NaBanco may differ, the alleged ""antitrust injury"" to competition between acquiring 
institutions is the same in both actions. See McGlinchy, 845 F.2d at 811. "
902,3," Plaintiffs do not cite a single case in which acquisition by competitors of a district and noncompeting business provided the 
basis for section 7 claim. Although Plaintiffs liken this case to Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States, 394 U.S. 131, 22 L. Ed. 2d 
148, 89 S. Ct. 927 (1969), that case involved two distinct aspects of a joint operating agreement between two newspapers: joint 
setting of subscription and advertising rates, which violated section 1 of the Sherman Act, and the acquisition of stock of one of 
the papers by the shareholders of the other, which violated section 7. "

928,2," The BPT succeeded both the General Business Tax and the Mercantile License Tax in Philadelphia. The Code incorporated 
essentially identical provisions as those contained in the Tax Reform Act, and the City subsequently enacted additional 
provisions and amendments pursuant to its authority under the Tax Reform Act. See 53 P.S. §§ 16183, 16184; Philadelphia 
Code §§ 19-2601 - 19-2608. "
929,3," Section 19-2603(3) of the Code further delineates the individuals and entities subject to the BPT, providing that: HN3[
] Any person having an active presence in the City is subject to the [BPT]. Any activity within the City by a person, 
through one or more employees, agents or independent contractors, that makes possible the creation, realization or continuance 
of contractual relationships between the person and customers located within the City, including but not limited to, the solicitation 
within the City by a person, through one or more employees, agents, or independent contractors, is sufficient to constitute active 
presence in the City. Physical presence (the maintenance of an office or property) in the City is not required to establish active 
presence in the City. Philadelphia Code § 19-2603(3)."
929,4," Although the net income component of the BPT is not directly at issue here, gross receipts are one of the measurements of the 
three-factor formula used to apportion income to Philadelphia for the net income component of the BPT. See BPT Regulations § 
408 (setting forth formula based on taxpayer's property, payroll and receipts within and outside of Philadelphia). The gross 
receipts calculation may therefore implicate the net income component of the BPT. See id. § 408(3). With that in mind, we note 
that the Code requires a taxpayer to make an irrevocable election with respect to the method of calculating net income, and 
provides for the allocation and apportionment of net income. The Code's definition of ""net income"" provides in relevant part: (a) ""Net income"" shall, at the option of the taxpayer, which option shall not be revokable [sic] by the taxpayer after it has been 
exercised as provided for by the collector, be either: (1) The net gain from the operation of a business, after provision for all allowable costs and expenses actually incurred in the 
conduct thereof, either paid or accrued in accordance with the accounting system used, without deduction of taxes based on 
income; or (2) The taxable income from any business activity as returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government prior to giving 
effect to the exclusion for dividends received and net operating loss, subject to [various deductions and adjustments]. (b) In the case of a corporation participating in the filing of a consolidated corporate return to the Federal Government, net 
income shall mean the income from any business activity which would have been returned to and ascertained by the Federal 
Government, subject, however to any correction thereof for fraud, evasion or error as finally ascertained by the Federal 
Government. . . . (c) The collector shall establish rules and regulations and methods of apportionment and allocation and evaluation so that only 
that part of such net income or net operating loss which is properly attributable and allocable to the doing of business in [the 
City] shall be taxed hereunder. The collector may make an apportionment and allocation with due regard to the nature of the 
business concerned on the basis of mileage, the ratio of the taxable receipts of the taxpayer from within the city to the total 
receipts of the taxpayer, the ratio of the value of the tangible personal and real property owned or leased and situated in the city 
levying the tax to the total tangible personal and real property of the taxpayer wherever owned and situated, the ratio of the 
wages, salaries, commissions and other compensation paid by the taxpayer within the city levying the tax to the total wages, 
salaries, commissions and other compensation paid by the taxpayer, and any other method or methods of apportionment and 
allocation other than the foregoing, calculated to effect a fair and proper apportionment and allocation. "

hearings before the Philadelphia Tax Review Board, the parties agreed that the NFL/NBC Contract was like a ""master contract,"" 
with the provisions of all contracts being ""virtually the same,"" the relevant difference being the specific financial/payment 
provisions, which were attached as schedules to each contract. N.T., 6/27/96, R.R., vol. 1, at 327a-329a; see N.T., 7/11/96, 
R.R., vol. 1, at 425a-426a (NFL vice-president of broadcasting testifying that contract with various networks were similar); see, 
e.g., Detroit Lions, Inc. v. Department of Treasury, 157 Mich. App. 207, 403 N.W.2d 812, 816-17 (Mich. App. 1986) (court 
quotes and cites a 1982 contact between the NFL and a network, which mirrors the language of the contract in the record here). 
The NFL/NBC Contract was part of the record below, and the Commonwealth Court, Court of Common Pleas and the Board 
relied upon it in rendering their decisions. Thus, while specific cites in this opinion are to the NFL/NBC Contract in the record, 
such citations refer to the same provisions in all the Network Contracts, and such provisions apply to all the Network Contracts 
relevant to this appeal."
930,7," Although the actual taxation rates for the BPT are not directly relevant to the instant appeal, to facilitate a basic understanding 
of the overall tax scheme, we note that for the tax year 2002, the ""gross receipts"" portion of the BPT is imposed at an annual "
931,," rate of 2.4 mills on each dollar of the taxpayer's annual taxable receipts, and the ""net income"" portion of the BPT is imposed at 
the rate of 6.5% of the taxpayer's taxable net income. See Philadelphia Code § 19-2604(2)(k). As to the instant case, the 
following tax rates were in effect during the tax years in question: 1986-88, 3.9 mills per dollar of gross receipts and 4.35% of net 
income; 1989-92, 3.25 mills per dollar of gross receipts and 6.5% of net income. See id. § 19-2604(b), 2604(c) & 2604(d); 
Football Club's 1992 BPT Tax Return (BPT Form 598), R.R., vol. 2, at 827a - 830a."
931,8," The Football Club also sought relief for assessments of the Philadelphia City Wage Tax imposed upon Norman Braman, who 
owned and operated the Football Club during all the tax years relevant to the instant appeal. The Football Club further sought 
abatement relief for the imposition of interest and penalties. This Court granted allocatur limited to the issues addressed herein 
and therefore, issues regarding the Wage Tax, interest and penalties are not subject to review here. See Philadelphia Eagles 
Football Club, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, 564 Pa. 472, 769 A.2d 443 (Pa. 2001) (per curiam)."
931,9," HN6[
] Under the Code, receipts or portions of receipts received for any services actually performed outside the Philadelphia 
city limits are excluded from the BPT, as long as the services are not rendered outside the city in order to evade or avoid 
payment of the BPT. Philadelphia Code § 19-2601. Taxable receipts of persons making sales or rendering services both inside 
and outside the Philadelphia city limits are to be segregated for purposes of the imposition of the BPT. Id."
931,10," The City's cross appeal involved the deductibility of Mr. Braman's aircraft expenses used for personal business and the 
computation of the time Mr. Braman spent in Philadelphia for Wage Tax purposes. Given the limited grant of review in the instant 
case, the claims raised in the City's cross appeal are not at issue here. "

limited to determining whether constitutional rights were violated, an error of law was committed, or the Board's findings of fact 
were supported by substantial evidence. 2 Pa.C.S. § 754(b). As with all questions of law, this Court's scope of review is plenary.

933,14," Along with the courts, commentators have also recognized that NFL contracts with television networks for broadcast rights 
involve the sale of a property right. See, e.g., Symposium, Restructuring Professional Sports Leagues, 12 Fordham Intell. Prop. 
Media & Ent. L.J. 413, 427 (Winter 2002) (""NFL has the ability to take the intellectual property associated with it and all of its

A. Wenner ed., 1989) (""successful management of professional sports leagues and franchises is based on the capacity to best 
exploit [television] rights payments"")."
933,15," Moreover, it seems obvious that the Network Contracts would have been of little value to the networks if the right to broadcast 
a particular game was not an exclusive, enforceable right, and other media outlets were allowed to simultaneously broadcast the 
live game. See generally Gary R. Roberts, The Legality of the Exclusive Collective Sale of Intellectual Property Rights by Sports 
Leagues, 3 Va. J. Sports & Law 52 (Spring 2001) (discussing advertising revenues attendant to exclusive broadcast of NFL

934,16," Act of Oct. 19, 1976, Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541 (effective January 1, 1978), codified as amended, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101-
810. The Act expressly preempted rights under state law that are equivalent to any of the rights encompassed by a federal 
copyright. See 17 U.S.C. § 301."
934,17," The full text of Section 102(a) reads as follows: HN10[
] Copyright protection subsists … in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now 
known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the 
aid of a machine or device. Works of authorship include the following categories: (1) literary works; (2) musical works, including any accompanying words; (3) dramatic works, including any accompanying music; (4) pantomimes and choreographic works; (5) pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; (6) motion pictures and other audiovisual works; and (7) sound recordings."

games, based ""on the current rate card prices."" See NFL/NBC Contract, p. 8, R.R. at 789a."
935,19," The Football Club argues that National Basketball Association v. Motorola, Inc., 105 F.3d 841 (2d. Cir. 1997), supports its 
argument that the telecasts were not copyrightable. However, Motorola merely applied the well-established rule that the actual 
performance of a professional sports game is not protected by copyright. As the above discussion indicates, a live telecast is 
copyrightable if it is simultaneously ""fixed"" or recorded. The court in Motorola concluded that the broadcasts of NBA games, as "
936,," opposed to the actual games themselves, are entitled to copyright protection under the Act. National Basketball Association, 105 
F.3d 841 at 847. Mototrola does not, as the Football Club asserts, support its claim that the live telecasts of the Football Club's 
football games were not copyrightable."
936,20," Section 106 provides: HN16[
] Subject to sections 107 through 118, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to 
authorize any of the following: (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; (3) to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, 
lease, or lending; (4) in the case of … motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly; and (5) in the case of … the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to display the copyrighted work publicly."
936,17, U.S.C. § 106.
936,21," In addition to transferring any of the bundle of rights, copyright owners may also enjoin, and seek actual or statutory damages 
from, anyone who violates their bundle of rights. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 501-505; see, e.g., id. § 501(b) (""The legal or beneficial 
owner of an exclusive right under a copyright is entitled . . . to institute an action for any infringement of that particular right 
committed while he or she is the owner of it""). See also id. § 411 (setting forth procedure for providing advance notice of 
copyright ownership in live events that are simultaneously recorded)."
936,22," Generally, an author has greater rights than one who acquires a copyright through an assignment. For example, the author 
has the right to terminate all transfers of ownership after 35 years. 17 U.S.C. § 203. This right is non-transferable and can only 
be exercised by the author or his/her heirs. Id. The author's right of termination is intended to counter the ""unequal bargaining "

937,23," Notably, the related federal regulations HN19[
] provide that a copyright claimant is either ""[the] author of the work"" or ""[a] person or organization that has obtained ownership of all rights under the copyright initially belonging to the author."" 37 C.F.R. § 
202.3(a)(3). The latter category includes a person or organization that has obtained, from the author or someone in the line of 
title, ""the contractual right to claim legal title to the copyright in an application for copyright registration."" Id. § 202.3(a)(3) n.1."
937,24," The Act instructs that HN21[
] ""a transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is not valid unless an 
instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum of the transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights conveyed 
or such owner's duly authorized agent."" 17 U.S.C. § 204(a). In addition, courts will uphold the validity of an oral agreement to 
transfer copyright ownership where the parties subsequently memorialize the oral agreement and agree as to the contents of 
that writing. See Robert A. Kreiss, The ""In Writing"" Requirement for Copyright and Patent Transfers: Are the Circuits in Conflict?, 
26 U of Dayton L. R. 43, 43-57 (Fall 2000) (discussing cases involving the writing requirement for transfer of copyright 
ownership)."
937,25," HN22[
] A fundamental rule in construing a contract is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the contracting parties. See Shovel Transfer & Storage, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Liquor Control Bd., 559 Pa. 56, 739 A.2d 133, 137 (Pa. 1999). ""It is firmly 
settled that the intent of the parties to a written contract is contained in the writing itself."" Id. When the words of a contract are 
clear and unambiguous, the meaning of the contract is ascertained from the contents alone. Steuart v. McChesney, 498 Pa. 45, "

terms must be construed as manifestly expressed by the parties and according to the accepted and plain meaning of the 
language used by the parties). HN23[
] When reviewing the transfer of copyright ownership, courts interpret instruments of 
conveyance liberally, especially when no innocent third parties will be harmed. Goldstein, Copyright, supra, § 4.5.1. See Imperial 
Residential Design, Inc. v. Palms Development Group, Inc., 70 F.3d 96, 99 (11th Cir. 1995)."
938,26," Notably, some sixty-five years ago a federal court sitting in Pennsylvania recognized that contracts between sports teams and 
broadcasters involve the transfer of a property right. See Pittsburgh Athletic Club v. KQV Broadcasting Co., 24 F. Supp. 490, 
492 (W.D. Pa. 1938) (""the Pittsburgh Athletic Company, by reason of its creation of the game, its control of the park, and its 
restriction of dissemination of news therefrom, has a property right in such news"")."
938,27," Any person who has watched an NFL game on television is familiar with this announcement and can attest that it is provided 
during each and every NFL telecast."
938,28," See also  PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture, 211 F.3d at 11; Shaw, 172 F.3d at 300; Rondor, 840 F. Supp. at 1169; Detroit Lions, 
403 N.W.2d at 817. Indeed, the Football Club admits as much when it argues that it is ""industry practice"" for the networks to 
assign to the NFL the copyright on live broadcasts as part of their broadcasting contracts.  [**126]  Nevertheless, the Football 
Club claims that the networks could not be paying the NFL copyright royalties because authorship is the sine qua non of 
copyright. See Appellant's Brief, at 15. While it is true that there could be no copyright ownership without an author, the above 
discussion clearly shows that one need not author a work in order to obtain copyright ownership of that work, and therefore, the 
Football Club's argument in this regard is simply meritless."
938,29," We note our disagreement with the Commonwealth Court below to the extent that it analogized the network telecasts to 
""works for hire."" A ""work for hire"" is created when a specific type of work is specially commissioned from the artist by the hiring 
party or when the artist is an employee of the party claiming ownership. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 201. The ""work for hire"" 
designation is legally significant because the hiring party or the employer is considered to be the author of the work, and thereby 
has greater rights than one who obtains copyright ownership by assignment. See supra note 22. In addition to statutory ""work for 
hire"" situations, a party may also obtain authorship by agreement of the parties. See In re Napster, 191 F. Supp. 2d at 1097 
(discussing contracts wherein a music record label, rather than the musical artist, is specifically deemed the author of the work). We agree with the Football Club that there was no evidence or argument presented to support a conclusion that the instant case 
involved ""works for hire."" It is also clear that the parties did not specifically designate the NFL as ""author"" of the telecasts. Given 
our analysis and conclusions set forth above, however, the Commonwealth Court's single reference to the Act's ""work for hire"" 
provisions is of no moment to the instant appeal. "
939,30," Under the Copyright Act of 1909, the predecessor to the current Act, copyright was regarded as an indivisible and single 
bundle of rights. The individual rights comprising that bundle could not be separately owned and could only be assigned as a 
whole. See Jim Henson Prods. v. John T. Brady & Assocs.., 16 F. Supp. 2d 259, 288 (S.D. N.Y. 1997). Moreover, in contrast to 
the current Act, under the 1909 Act, ownership of a copyright could not be transferred until the work was actually published. See 
Melville B. Nimmer & David Nimmer, 3 Nimmer on Copyright § 10.01 (2002). Thus, under the 1909 Act, the Football Club's 
argument that the networks could not have assigned ownership of a copyright until after a live football game was finished and, 
as a result, completely recorded, might have some validity. Under the current Act, however, there is no such restriction on the 
transfer of copyright ownership."
939,31," HN27[
] When words of a statute are not defined, we are guided by the principles set forth in the Statutory Construction Act, which provide that such words shall be construed according to their common and approved usage. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903. While the 
Statutory Construction Act is not expressly applicable to the construction of local ordinances, the principles contained therein are 
nevertheless useful. The objective of statutory construction is to determine the legislative intent. Council of Middletown Township 
v. Benham, 514 Pa. 176, 523 A.2d 311 (Pa. 1987). Absent a contrary intent by the Philadelphia City Council, the words used in 
local ordinances, like statutes, should be construed according to their common and approved usage. Id.; 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903. 
Furthermore, the courts of this Commonwealth generally use dictionaries as source material to determine the common and 
approved usage of terms. See Fogle v. Malvern Courts, Inc., 554 Pa. 633, 722 A.2d 680 (Pa. 1999); Love v. Philadelphia, 518 
Pa. 370, 543 A.2d 531 (Pa. 1988). "
940,32," The Commerce Clause states that HN30[
] ""Congress shall have Power . . . [to] regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States . . .."" U.S. CONST., art. I, § 8, cl. 3."
940,33," We note that two organizations, the Committee on State Taxation and the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, 
provided amicus curiae briefs in support of the Football Club, limiting their arguments solely to the issue of whether the City's 
imposition of the BPT in this case violated the Commerce Clause."
940,34," In Complete Auto, a taxpayer challenged the State of Mississippi's franchise tax on the privilege of operating a business within 
the state. The tax was assessed equally on all gross income derived from transportation for hire within Mississippi but the 
taxpayer, who transported cars manufactured outside of Mississippi to dealers within the state, argued that Mississippi had "
941,," illegally taxed the privilege of engaging in an interstate commercial activity. Applying the four part test, the Supreme Court 
concluded that Mississippi's franchise tax did not violate the Commerce Clause because it was only imposed on business 
conducted within the state and did not tax income earned outside its borders, thereby resulting in a fair apportionment of the 
taxpayer's income. Id. at 287."
941,35," The Supreme Court has explained that: A sale of goods is most readily viewed as a discrete event facilitated by the laws and amenities of the place of sale, and the 
transaction itself does not readily reveal the extent to which completed or anticipated interstate activity affects the value on which 
a buyer is taxed. We have therefore consistently approved taxation of sales without any division of the tax base among different 
States, and have instead held such taxes properly measurable by the gross charge for the purchase, regardless of any activity 
outside the taxing jurisdiction that might have preceded the sale or might occur in the future. Jefferson Lines, 514 U.S. at 186. "
942,36," Tax commentators hailed the Supreme Court's decision in Jefferson Lines for breaking the ""misconceived analogy"" between 
sales taxes and gross receipts taxes. See Piper & Eggen, Gross Receipts Taxes: General Principles, supra, at 1610:0008a. While Jefferson Lines sustained states' power to impose unapportioned retail sales taxes on the sale of services involving 
interstate activities, it strengthened taxpayers' ability to assert the position that gross receipts taxes imposed on business activity 
must be fairly apportioned if they are measured by receipts from interstate business activity. By drawing a sharp line between 
gross receipts taxes and retail sales taxes and characterizing the gross receipts tax in Central Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Mealey, 
[334 U.S. 653, 92 L. Ed. 1633, 68 S. Ct. 1260 (1948),] as akin to an income tax, the Court has called into question some of its 
earlier decisions that approved, with little analysis, unapportioned gross receipts taxes merely because they were imposed on a 
""local"" subject and could loosely be analogized to retail sales taxes. Jerome R. Hellerstein & Walter Hellerstein, State Taxation P 18.08 [5], at 18-65 to -66 (3d ed. 1998) (footnote omitted) 
(emphasis added). In addition, since Jefferson Lines, other jurisdictions have recognized taxpayers' rights to apportionment of a gross receipts tax, 
just like all other forms of taxation upon income. See, e.g. Polychrome Int'l Corp. v. Krigger, 5 F.3d 1522, 1540, 29 V.I. 311 (3d 
Cir. 1993) (""any tax - including one imposed on, or measured by, gross receipts from interstate and foreign commerce - must be 
apportioned to reflect only that business activity attributable to intrastate commerce""); City of Winchester v. American Woodmark 
Corp., 252 Va. 98, 471 S.E.2d 495, 498 (Va. 1996) (recognizing taxpayers' right to apportionment of a gross receipts tax); 
Southern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Arizona, Dep't of Revenue, 202 Ariz. 326, 44 P.3d 1006, 1014 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (""In our 
view, Jefferson Lines compels the view that gross receipts taxes … must be apportioned to comply with the … Commerce 
Clause.""); see generally, Hellerstein & Hellerstein, State Taxation, P 18.08[5]."
942,37," In a related argument, the City asserts that a business privilege tax, as a distinct type of tax on business receipts, need not be 
apportioned. While acknowledging that the U.S. Supreme Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence mandates fair 
apportionment, the City argues that a business privilege tax is distinguishable from other forms of taxation on business revenue. 
In making this argument, the City fails to recognize that Complete Auto, the cornerstone of modern Commerce Clause 
jurisprudence, involved a gross receipts tax imposed on the privilege of doing business, even though it was labeled a ""franchise"" 
tax and was measured by receipts from ""gross income."" The Supreme Court in Complete Auto ultimately upheld the tax because 
it was imposed only on instate activity, but the Court clearly recognized that HN34[
] a tax on the privilege of conducting 
business is subject to the fair apportionment requirement. 430 U.S. at 287; see, e.g., Gwin, White & Prince, Inc. v. Henneford, 
305 U.S. 434 at 438-39, 83 L. Ed. 272, 59 S. Ct. 325 (gross receipts tax on the privilege of conducting business must be 
properly apportioned); American Woodmark, 471 S.E.2d at 498 (same). See also O.H. Martin Co. v. Sharpsburg Borough, 376 
Pa. 242, 102 A.2d 125, 126-27, 45 Mun. L Rep. 147 (Pa. 1954) (recognizing the important distinction between intrastate and 
interstate commerce when imposing a business privilege tax on gross receipts, and concluding that a Borough could impose a 
business privilege tax without apportionment because the ordinance taxed only those receipts derived from intrastate business, 
and therefore, there was no threat of the borough taxing outside its border); accord Wagman, Inc. v. Manchester Township, 112 
Pa. Commw. 357, 535 A.2d 702, 706 (Pa. Commw. 1988) (apportionment of business privilege tax not required where the 
ordinance specifically exempted from taxation receipts earned in interstate commerce). "
943,38," While we agree with the conclusion reached by the Commonwealth Court as to internal consistency, we note that the 
Commonwealth Court misinterpreted Complete Auto by requiring the Football Club to present evidence that it was actually taxed 
in other jurisdictions. Philadelphia Eagles, 758 A.2d at 251. HN37[
] The Supreme Court has made clear that the proper inquiry 
is whether a taxpayer is subjected to the risk of multiple taxation. See Jefferson Lines, 514 U.S. at 184."
943,39," HN39[
] Although not part of any constitutional test, the U.S. Supreme Court has analyzed tax discrepancies under the 
external consistency test on a percentage basis. See, e.g., Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Board, 463 U.S. 159, 
183-84, 77 L. Ed. 2d 545, 103 S. Ct. 2933 (1983) (fourteen percent discrepancy asserted by taxpayer deemed constitutionally 
acceptable); Norfolk & W. Ry., 390 U.S. 317, 19 L. Ed. 2d 1201, 88 S. Ct. 995 (one-hundred sixty-six percent difference in tax "
944,," due under tax statute and using actual values deemed outside the allowable margin of error). While creating no benchmark for 
constitutional purposes, we conclude under these facts that the 100% discrepancy between the tax assessed by the City and the 
tax due if apportioned is constitutionally unacceptable."
944,40," Although the Tax Review Board found that only 50% of the Football Club's receipts should have been subjected to the gross 
receipts portion of the BPT, this conclusion was based upon the Board's erroneous finding that the media receipts were fees for 
services rendered and therefore, we cannot simply reinstate the Board's decision."
944,41," We recognize, of course, that if we were to conclude that the BPT is externally consistent, as the Commonwealth Court did, all 
multi-jurisdictional businesses with a presence in Philadelphia, not just the Football Club, would be subject to the threat of 
duplicative taxation. As such, we agree with the argument proffered by amicus Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, 
namely, that such a result would discourage business in Philadelphia, and would also have a chilling effect on all Pennsylvania 
business. Business activities, a fraction of which should be taxable by the City, would instead be taxed twice. The effect of 
burdening businesses with such tax liabilities would make Philadelphia an unwelcome destination for new businesses, would 
discourage existing business from expanding and, in fact, would encourage businesses to leave Philadelphia altogether."
944,42," The City argues that the Commonwealth Court properly determined that the City's allocation of 100% of the Football Club's 
media receipts to Philadelphia satisfied the external consistency test for fair apportionment because, according to the City, ""the 
proportion of NFL media receipts allocated to the Eagles (and taxed by Philadelphia) is the same as the proportion of total NFL 
games played in Philadelphia."" Brief for Appellee at 8; see id. at 21. However, this argument focuses on how much of the NFL's 
total receipts are taxable in Philadelphia as represented by the share of NFL games that were played in Philadelphia, instead of 
the proper inquiry, which involves determining where the Eagles Team earned its share of the NFL media receipts and 
calculating the portion of the Football Club's media receipts that were taxable in Philadelphia. "
945,," Even if we were to focus on the total number of NFL football games, as the City urges us to do, the City's argument completely 
ignores the fact that two teams played in each football game that was telecast and generated the media receipts, not just one 
team. Again, there is simply no support in the record for the City's assumption that the Football Club earned 100% of its annual 
media receipts from the eight football games played in and broadcast from Philadelphia each year."
945,43," Nevertheless, the City asserts that Spielvogel, Inc. v. Township of Cheltenham, 144 Pa. Commw. 510, 601 A.2d 1310 (Pa. 
Commw. 1992), mandates inclusion of 100% of the Football Club's media receipts to its commercial domicile. However, the 
court in Spielvogel did not hold so broadly and, in fact, the ordinance at issue there ""was intended to tax only intrastate income,"" 
so there was simply no issue of multistate taxation. Id. at 1315. See Complete Auto, 430 U.S. at 287 (tax upheld because it 
taxed only instate value). Thus, the City's reliance on Spielvogel for such a broad proposition is misplaced. The City also asserts 
that Gilberti v. City of Pittsburgh, 511 Pa. 100, 511 A.2d 1321 (Pa. 1986), supports the imposition of the BPT on 100% of the 
gross receipts of the Football Club, regardless of where the receipts were earned. However, Gilberti did not, as the City 
suggests, enact a per se rule allowing a city to tax 100% of the gross receipts of any business domiciled within its jurisdiction. 
Rather, in Gilberti, this Court concluded that a taxing jurisdiction is not required to ignore the contribution provided by a business 
maintaining a base of operations within the taxing jurisdiction. Philadelpia Eagles Football Club, 758 A.2d at 236; accord 
Maxland Dev. Corp. v. Director of Revenue, 960 S.W.2d 503, 1998 Mo. LEXIS 4 (Mo. 1985). See also Mobil Oil Corp. v. Comm'r 
of Taxes of Vermont, 445 U.S. 425, 444-46, 63 L. Ed. 2d 510, 100 S. Ct. 1223 (1980) (stating that there is ""no adequate 
justification"" for a rule that ""requires allocation of dividend income to a single situs rather than apportionment among the States,"" 
and ultimately concluding that the taxing state's ""interest in taxing a proportionate share of [the taxpayer's] dividend income [was] 
not overridden by any interest of the State of commercial domicile"")."
945,44," In a related argument, the City asserts that its assessment of 100% of the Football Club's receipts was constitutional because 
it was done in accordance with Regulation 322, which provides that where a taxpayer maintains its commercial domicile in 
Philadelphia,"" all patent, copyright, and trademark royalties received are to be included in the measure of the tax,"" unless 
""attributable to business conducted at a place of business regularly maintained by the taxpayer outside of Philadelphia."" BPT 
Regulations § 322. The City claims that because the Football Club was domiciled in Philadelphia, and failed to show that it 
maintained a regular place of business elsewhere, the City properly levied the BPT upon 100% of the media receipts under 
Regulation 322. However, the fact that the City created such a rule for its own regulations does not exempt the City from "
946,," adhering to the constitutional mandate to fairly apportion revenue generated from interstate business activities. HN41[
] Just as 
the City seeks to collect its fair share of revenue from businesses operating in its jurisdiction, whether or not a particular 
business actually maintains an office in Philadelphia, it cannot deny a taxpayer ""the right to a division of the tax base, merely 
because the taxpayer has not established an office outside the state, if the taxpayer is carrying on other activities … that will 
subject it to income tax in those other states."" Hellerstein & Hellerstein, 2 State Taxation, supra, P 8.02[4][c]."
946,45," We emphasize that the City's application of Regulation 322, and not the BPT in its entirety, violated the external consistency 
test. The BPT contains an explicit apportionment formula instituting a geographical limitation on the gross receipts portion of the 
BPT, see Philadelphia Code § 19-2601 (""taxable receipts"" limited to those receipts earned in Philadelphia), but Regulation 322 
does not contain a corresponding limitation. By employing Regulation 322 to tax revenues earned from the live broadcasts 
originating outside Philadelphia, the City taxed beyond the borders of its jurisdiction, and the City's imposition of the BPT in this 
manner was not rationally related to its power and interest. Despite the City's assertion that there is ""no rational basis"" for limiting 
the imposition of the BPT to one-half of the Eagles Team's games, we find that the only media receipts that had a rational 
relationship the taxing jurisdiction were those that were generated from the games played and broadcast live from Philadelphia. "

L. Ed. 2d 811 (1989) (""CCNV""). Unless the work is a work-for-hire, the party in which copyright initially vests is the author-in-fact. 
See CCNV, 490 U.S. at 737, 109 S. Ct. at 2171 (indicating that ""the author is the party who actually creates the work""). I agree 
with the majority that the televised games were not works for hire. Additionally, there does not appear to be any dispute that the

telecasts vested initially in the networks. See Majority Opinion, slip op. at 17."
947,2," In this regard, I note that the court in Detroit Lions relied upon Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Affiliated Enterprises, 123 
F.2d 665 (10th Cir. 1941), for the conclusion that the existence of a patent or copyright is not necessary to characterize 
payments as royalties. See Detroit Lions, 403 N.W.2d at 817. Such reliance was arguably misplaced, however, as Affiliated 
Enterprises' essential thesis was that royalties could be paid for the use of technological improvements, trade secrets, and 
trademarks that were not subject to patent or copyright protection. See Affiliated Enterprises, 123 F.2d at 668. In such instances, 
unlike the present case, the underlying intellectual property had to exist prior to its use. "

976,1," Unless otherwise noted, the facts in this background are drawn from the Corrected Consolidated Class Action Complaint (the 
""Complaint"") filed by Plaintiffs. "
977,2," At the time of Barr's ANDA, the court determination trigger was interpreted to be a final, non-appealable decision by a court. In 
light of two subsequent district court decisions, the FDA amended its regulation defining ""court action"" so that a district court 
determination of patent invalidity is now considered to be a final decision triggering the 180-day exclusivity period. See 21 C.F.R. 
§ 314.107(e) (interim rule)."
977,3," ICI's lawsuit also named as a defendant Heumann Pharma GmbH & Company (""Heumann""), Barr's supplier of tamoxifen. 
Heumann was subsequently dismissed from the suit in accordance with the terms of a stipulation of settlement. According to the 
Complaint, Heumann agreed to be bound by any determination of the validity of the '516 Patent."

ten year period in exchange for Heumann's promise to discharge all claims related to the '516 Patent. "
978,5," Since that time, the Supreme Court has ruled that federal appellate courts may not direct the vacatur of a district court order 
based solely on a settlement agreement between the parties. See United States Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall 
Partnership, 513 U.S. 18, 27, 130 L. Ed. 2d 233, 115 S. Ct. 386 (1994). However, the Federal Circuit subsequently held that 
United States Bancorp applied only to cases still pending when United States Bancorp was decided, and thus the vacatur 
(issued prior to United States Bancorp) was proper. See Zeneca Ltd. v. Novopharm Ltd., 111 F.3d 144 (Table), 1997 WL 
168318, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 10, 1997)."
978,6," The facts about the Novopharm ANDA and subsequent litigation are not in the Complaint, but are based on court decisions 
publicly available on Westlaw and papers submitted to those courts. (See Chang Dec., Exs. 8-11). "
981,7," In Duplan Corp., the court held that the illegality of such an agreement could not be presumed solely by the existence of a letter 
from a settling party's attorney opining that the party would prevail if it pursued the patent infringement case. 540 F.2d at 1221."
981,8," With regard to Zenith, on October 1, 1997, Zenith's motion for preliminary injunctive relief was denied. Terazosin, 164 F. Supp. 
2d at 1345. Zenith's appeal of that order was pending before the Federal Circuit when the parties settled. Id. at 1346. With 
regard to Geneva, patent infringement litigation was proceeding apace in the Northern District of Illinois. "
984,9," It must be noted that Barr did not seek similar relief when Novopharm filed its ANDA and challenged the '516 patent between 
1994 and 1997. Only after the events in 1997 and 1998 described above in the text did Barr attempt to assert its rights. If Barr 
intended to protect its exclusivity period on behalf of itself and Zeneca pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Barr's inactivity 
during the pendency of the Novopharm litigation is inexplicable. "
985,10," The district court that reviewed the FDA's decision to grant Barr's FDA Petition criticized and rejected this confusing 
interpretation of the interplay between paragraph III and paragraph IV certification. See Mylan Pharm. v. Henney, 94 F. Supp. 2d 
36, 57 (D.D.C. 2000) vacated as moot sub nom., Pharamachemie B.V. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 349 U.S. App. D.C. 284, 276 F.3d 627 
(D.C. Cir. 2002)."
985,11," Plaintiffs admit they cannot and do not seek to argue that Barr's FDA Petition falls within the sham exception to the Noerr-
Pennington doctrine. (Pl. Opp. Mem. at 52-53.) Given the disposition of these motions, this Court need not address the more difficult question of whether the Settlement 
Agreement itself is protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Compare Hise v. Philip Morris, Inc., 46 F. Supp.2d 1201, 1206 
(N.D. Okla. 1999), aff'd, 208 F.3d 226 (10th Cir. 2000) (holding that concerted activities among co-defendants in jointly 
negotiating Master Settlement Agreement with 46 states and 6 other jurisdictions was protected activity) with Cardizem, 105 F. 
Supp. 2d at 641 (collecting and agreeing with cases that hold settlements between adverse parties are not protected); see 
Raymond Ku, Antitrust Immunity, the First Amendment, and Settlements: Defining the Boundaries of the Right to Petition, 33 
Ind. L. Rev. 385, 429 (2000) (arguing that Noerr-Pennington would not apply because ""when asked to approve a settlement 
agreement, a court is not being asked to determine liability or approve the substance of the agreement.""). "
987,12," The Complaint merely alleges that Barr (in its FDA Petition) claimed that Mylan ""likely will begin marketing a generic version 
upon receiving FDA approval."" (Compl. P 66.) This is somewhat different from Plaintiffs claiming that Mylan would enter the 
market before actually obtaining a declaration that the '516 Patent was invalid (and thus risking monetary liability for infringing on 
the patent). "
989,13," The parties disagree on one point not relevant to the present discussion -- whether the Illinois Brick rule (prohibiting indirect 
purchasers from asserting federal antitrust claims) also governs state antitrust law claims where the states in question have not 
definitively ruled on the issue. Since the allegations otherwise fail to state a claim, this disagreement is immaterial. "
998,1," Our statement of facts is adapted from the district court's description. Both parties stipulate that the district court's description is 
accurate. "
999,2," MPC's operation of its gas transmission and storage facilities is regulated by both the Montana Public Service Commission and 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. No party has asserted that regulation has immunized MPC's operations from the 
antitrust law challenges presented in this action."
999,3," In these contracts, MPC assigned NOVA transportation rights directly to Northridge. Northridge subsequently reassigned the 
NOVA transportation rights to Northridge's natural gas customers. Some documents in the record refer to Northridge as the 
customers' ""agent."" Whether Northridge was acting as its customers' agent or acting in some other intermediary capacity does 
not affect the substance of Paladin's § 1 claims: that MPC and Northridge entered into agreements and that those agreements 
(which contemplated assignment of MPC's NOVA capacity to natural gas customers in a two-step transaction) effected an 
indirect boycott of Paladin. In other words, Paladin claims that MPC and Northridge collaborated in agreeing to sell long-term 
assignments of NOVA transportation to customers, thereby driving Paladin from the market."
999,4," Paladin has asked us for leave to supplement the record on appeal. We deny Paladin's motion. The excerpt from Rich 
Swinney's deposition at RSRE (1)-(3) and the documents at RSRE(7)-(12) already are part of the record, so we may consider 
this evidence without supplementing the record. In contrast, the excerpt from Marie Owens's deposition at RSRE (4)-(6) was 
never presented to the district court, so we will not consider it. See, e.g., United States v. Elias, 921 F.2d 870, 874 (9th Cir. 
1990). "

1001,7," The Supreme Court's cases demonstrate that ""every commercial agreement"" is a ""restraint of trade,"" N'west Wholesale

every commercial agreement, including the assignments here, is ""an agreement . . . among two or more entities,"" in the words of 
the Ninth Circuit's prima facie § 1 claim. HN4[
] The Supreme Court has stated that ""the legality of an agreement or regulation 
cannot be determined by so simple a test, as whether it restrains competition. Every agreement concerning trade, every 
regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence."" Board of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 
62 L. Ed. 683, 38 S. Ct. 242 (1918). Not every commercial agreement is an illegal unreasonable restraint of trade, however."
1001,8," This is so because plausible arguments that a practice is procompetitive make us unable to conclude ""the likelihood of 
anticompetitive effects is clear and the possibility of countervailing procompetitive effects is remote."" N'west Wholesale 
Stationers, 472 U.S. at 294. "
1002,9," Justice Brandeis delivered the Supreme Court's classic statement of the rule of reason in Chicago Board of Trade v. United 
States, holding: HN11[
] The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby 
promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question the 
court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and 
after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the 
evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all 
relevant facts."
1002,246, U.S. at 238.
1002,10," Paladin argues that the relevant market is for NOVA non-interruptible transportation. We agree. HN12[
] The Supreme Court 
has held that a ""market is composed of products that have reasonable interchangeability for the purposes for which they are 
produced--price, use and qualities considered."" Int'l Boxing Club of N.Y., Inc. v. United States, 358 U.S. 242, 250, 3 L. Ed. 2d 
270, 79 S. Ct. 245 (1959). It does not appear from the record that a buyer of Canadian gas has any alternative means of 
transporting non-interruptible gas to Montana other than through the NOVA system. It thus appears that no transportation 
product has ""reasonable interchangeability"" with NOVA non-interruptible transportation. MPC makes no substantive argument to 
the contrary. "
1003,11," Natural gas transportation customers testified that MPC's offering five-year assignments of NOVA non-interruptible 
transportation had a procompetitive effect in a separate market: the market for natural gas as a commodity. Once customers 
acquired five-year assignments of NOVA transportation rights, they believed they gained flexibility to choose from competing 
suppliers of natural gas. Customers' improved power to choose from competing natural gas suppliers undoubtedly is 
procompetitive in the market for natural gas. It may be, however, that this procompetitive effect should not be considered in our 
rule of reason analysis, based on the theory that procompetitive effects in a separate market cannot justify anti-competitive 
effects in the market for pipeline transportation under analysis. This theory might find some support in the Supreme Court's 
comment that competition ""cannot be foreclosed with respect to one sector of the economy because certain private citizens or 
groups believe that such foreclosure might promote greater competition in a more important sector of the economy."" United 
States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 610, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972). ""If a decision is to be made to 
sacrifice competition in one portion of the economy for greater competition in another portion this too is a decision that must be 
made by Congress and not by private forces or by the courts."" Id. at 611. See also Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League, 34 F.3d 
1091, 1112 (1st Cir. 1994) (suggesting that it is ""improper to validate a practice that is decidedly in restraint of trade simply 
because the practice produces some unrelated benefits to competition in another market""). On the other hand, perhaps that 
language from Topco is not controlling because it is a dictum or incomplete or obsolete or because the case of such closely 
related markets as those for transport of natural gas and the natural gas itself might be distinguished. In any event, we need not and do not reach this issue on the permissible bounds of rule of reason inquiry. For we conclude that 
the anticompetitive harms to the market for NOVA non interruptible transportation were so slight, and the procompetitive benefits 
of the assignments in that market were so obvious, that we must deem the assignments reasonable even without considering 
any procompetitive benefits to the separate but related market for natural gas."
1003,12," Two other businesses, Stone Container and Great Falls Gas Company, also purchased NOVA non-interruptible transportation 
rights and could have competed with Paladin and MPC. NOVA also sold NOVA transportation rights in competition with Paladin 
and MPC. Natural gas customers who purchased assignments of NOVA transportation rights also could have sold all or part of 
their transportation rights for a profit if MPC had attempted to raise prices above competitive levels. "
1004,13," Whether a monopoly could develop in this regulated market is doubtful, so long as NOVA will deal with others. There 
apparently are few barriers to entering the market for non-interruptible transportation. Paladin essentially was a broker. Paladin 
could be replaced by another broker, who presumably could enter the market without significant investments in equipment, real 
estate, personnel, and the like. Because of the ease of entry, there appears to have been little danger of long-term 
anticompetitive harm to this market. "
1005,14," Justice White explained why tying arrangements are harmful to competition: There is general agreement . . . that the fundamental restraint against which the tying proscription is meant to guard is the 
use of power over one product to attain power over another, or otherwise to distort freedom of trade and competition in the 
second product. This distortion injures the buyers of the second product, who because of their preference for the seller's 
brand of the first are artificially forced to make a less than optimal choice in the second. And even if the customer is 
indifferent among brands of the second product and therefore loses nothing by agreeing to use the seller's brand of the 
second in order to get his brand of the first, such tying agreements may work significant restraints on competition in the tied 
product. The tying seller may be working toward a monopoly position in the tied product and, even if he is not, the practice 
of tying forecloses other sellers of the tied product and makes it more difficult for new firms to enter that market. They must 
be prepared not only to match existing sellers of the tied product in price and quality, but to offset the attraction of the tying 
product itself. Even if this is possible through simultaneous entry into production of the tying product, entry into both 
markets is significantly more expensive than simple entry into the tied market, and shifting buying habits in the tied product 
is considerably more cumbersome and less responsive to variations in competitive offers. In addition to these 
anticompetitive effects in the tied product, tying arrangement may be used to evade price control in the tying product 
through clandestine transfer of the profit to the tied product; they may be used as a counting device to effect price 
discrimination; and they may be used to force a full line of products on the customer so as to extract more easily from him a 
monopoly return on one unique product in the line. Fortner Enter., Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 512-14, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495, 89 S. Ct. 1252 (1969)."
1005,15," We assume, without deciding, that the five-year NOVA transportation assignments and the excess natural gas coverage are 
distinct ""products."" We express no opinion on that issue. "
1006,16, It is undisputed that MPC was entitled to the balancing penalty under the relevant contracts.
1006,17," Paladin's argument that these communications were coercive depends upon their simultaneity. But any implication of coercion 
would be weakened by the fact that customers did not receive MPC's letter on the date MPC allegedly threatened to charge Ash 
Grove the balancing penalty. MPC's letter was dated July 2, 1992, so customers presumably did not receive it until later."
1006,18," One customer testified that ""[n]either MPC or any of its affiliates attempted, suggested[,] or in any manner interfered with our 
free election of whether to take the NOVA capacity offered for assignment by MPC or our choice of suppliers."" "
1007,19," As an employee of customer Rhone-Poulenc explained, ""Rhone-Poulenc's decision on its gas supplier in each year was 
based on our independent judgment as to reliable supply and best price. The decision to take the assignment contract from MPC 
for NOVA capacity was also based on our independent judgment, including the fact that by acquiring such rights we would be in 
a position to choose from a number of available suppliers and obtain the best price possible."""
1007,20," The district court rejected Paladin's tying claim because it determined that MPC did not ""sell"" imbalance coverage to its 
customers. Paladin Assocs., 97 F. Supp. 2d at 1028-29. The district court reasoned that tying occurs when a competitor agrees 
to sell one product on the condition that the buyer also purchase a different product. Id. Because MPC did not sell imbalance 
coverage to customers, but rather provided imbalance coverage to them free of charge, MPC could not have tied the sale of 
NOVA non-interruptible transportation to the sale of imbalance coverage, the district court held. Id. at 1029. In light of our holding that Paladin did not coerce sellers into buying NOVA transportation, we need not review the district court's 
holding that no illegal tying can occur when the alleged tying product or service is given gratis rather than sold. We express no 
opinion on that issue. "
1008,21," HN22[
] Under this doctrine, a plaintiff must show: (1) the defendant is a monopolist with control over a facility that is 
""essential""; (2) a competitor is unable practicably or reasonably to duplicate the facility; (3) a competitor is denied access to the 
facility by the defendant; (4) providing access to the facility was feasible; and (5) the plaintiff incurred antitrust injury as a result of 
the wrongful conduct. City of Anaheim v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 955 F.2d 1373, 1380 (9th Cir. 1992). Because we determine that 
MPC does not control a facility that is essential, we need not consider other issues raised by Paladin's claim, such as whether 
MPC is a monopolist."
1008,22," Paladin also advanced an attempted monopolization claim based on its essential facilities theory. HN24[
] To prove its attempted monopolization claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act, Paladin must show: (1) a specific intent to monopolize a relevant 
market--i.e., an intent to control prices or destroy competition in a relevant market; (2) predatory or anticompetitive conduct 
designed to control prices or destroy competition; (3) a dangerous probability of success--i.e., a probability of achieving 
monopoly power in the relevant market; and (4) causal antitrust injury. Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 
122 L. Ed. 2d 247, 113 S. Ct. 884 (1993). As we explained above, Paladin has offered no evidence that MPC or NARCO had the 
power to eliminate competition in the relevant downstream market. Neither MPC nor NARCO had a ""dangerous probability"" of 
achieving monopoly power in the relevant downstream market. We affirm the district court's judgment in favor of MPC on this 
claim. "
1009,23," Rule 37(c)(1) HN26[
] gives a court discretion to impose ""appropriate sanctions"" when a party violates discovery rules without substantial justification. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). Appropriate sanctions include ""payment of reasonable expenses, 
including attorney's fees."" Id. "
1016,1," The facts herein are as set forth in Bliss' complaint and, for purposes of this motion, are taken as true. "
1020,2," For example, it may be that but for Midwest's alleged misappropriation of trade secrets, Midwest would not have used the Torc-
Pac 40 trademark and/or name. However, given Bliss' allegation that Midwest manufactured and/or distributed some replicas 
and/or similar parts prior to receiving the drawings from Bliss, it is unclear from the complaint whether Midwest's use of the 
trademark and/or name arose solely out of the misappropriation of trade secrets. This uncertainty may be clarified at the 
summary judgment stage. "
1035,1," Coleman, who is defending himself pro se, did not make any submissions supporting or opposing any motion for summary 
judgment."
1035,2," The factual summary that follows derives primarily from Plaintiffs' Complaint (""Compl.""), dated January 18, 2001, Plaintiffs' 
Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment and in Support of Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (""Pl. 
Mem.""), dated November 22, 2002, the Memorandum of Law in support of Defendant Kentucky Derby Hosiery Co., Inc's Motion 
for Summary Judgment Dismissing the Complaint, the Affidavit/Affirmation of Steven Koebel (""Koebel Aff.""), dated December 11, 
2002, and accompanying exhibits and affidavits. Except where specifically referenced, no further citation to these sources will be 
made. "
1039,3," Plaintiffs' reference to antitrust cases that have endorsed agency principles in that context is misplaced because of the different 
legislative intents between RICO and antitrust statutes. (See Pl. Mem. at 37-39.) Whereas antitrust law and statutes are 
ultimately intended to prevent corporations from exerting monopolizing anticompetitive force, the language of RICO is clearly 
aimed at individual ""racketeers"" infiltrating legitimate business. See Cedric, 533 U.S. at 166 (""Neither is it inconsistent with 
antitrust law's intracorporate conspiracy doctrine; that doctrine turns on specific antitrust objectives.""); see also Qatar, 1992 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14784, 1992 WL 276565, at *8."
1039,4," Although Coleman does not move for summary judgment, the Court determines herein whether there is sufficient on this record 
evidence for a reasonable jury to find that Coleman participated in the fraudulent scheme alleged by Plaintiffs, both as an 
alternate basis for rejecting Plaintiffs' claims that KDH should be liable for Coleman's wrongful actions, and to assess the 
propriety of the RICO violations alleged against Koebel. discussed in part II.D below. "
1040,5," The Court is unpersuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that the injury requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (c) specified in Sedima v. 
Imrex Co., Inc., 473 U.S. 479, 494, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346, 105 S. Ct. 3275 (1985), should apply to 18 U.S.C. § 1962(a)and (b) as 
well. HN14[
] The Second Circuit has expressly held that the requirements for demonstrating injury and for asserting a claim under § 1962(a) are distinct from § 1962(c), and that only in subsection (c) is the RICO injury alleged properly based on the 
predicate acts. See Ouaknine, 897 F.2d at 83; see also Vista Co. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 725 F. Supp. 1286, 1299 
(S.D.N.Y. 1989) (""Though the Sedima Court found that there was no requirement under §§ 1962& 1964(c) of a distinct 
'racketeering injury,' this holding has no bearing on what constitutes a violation § 1962(a).""). The investment injury pertains to 18 
U.S.C. § 1962(b) as well. See Discon, 93 F.3d at 1063; Black Radio Network, Inc. v. NYNEX Corp., 44 F. Supp. 2d 565, 579 
(S.D.N.Y. 1999). "
1042,6," The fact that commissions from KDH sales were paid directly to Koebel and not to USA Certified, without further proof of intent, 
cannot establish scienter with regard to Coleman or KDH. First, Plaintiffs have presented no evidence that Coleman was aware 
that Koebel's partners objected to Koebel's work for KDH. Second, the record shows that it was not Coleman's responsibility to 
monitor the proper allocation of the commissions he paid Coleman - he was entitled to assume that Mossberg was aware that 
USA Certified was not receiving the checks directly because they had always been made out to Koebel alone. Third, Koebel 
worked on behalf of KDH in his own capacity prior to the inception of USA Certified and, as the President of USA Certified, 
Koebel had the responsibility to either request that the checks be distributed directly to USA Certified or to deal with any proper 
arrangements on USA Certified's behalf. "
1046,7," The fact that Mossberg admits that at sometime in 2000 he was shown an IRS Form 1099 reporting Koebel's income from 
KDH, and that at that point -- around the end of April or beginning of May 2000 (the fax of the Form 1099 was received at USA 
Certified's office on April 28, 2000) -- he was alerted to Koebel's activities on behalf of KDH (Mossberg Dep. at 188), does not 
curtail the extent of the duration the jury may consider in determining whether the substantial period of time requirement for a 
RICO violation is sufficiently demonstrated by Plaintiffs. Mossberg testified that he did not confront Koebel immediately because 
a large amount of inventory had recently been ordered and he needed Koebel to continue to work until the inventory was 
depleted. (Mossberg Dep. at 188-189.) The jury can consider whether the fraud continued from May through August due to the "
1047,," fact that inventory had already been ordered and Mossberg might reasonably not have been able to stop the effects of Koebel's 
alleged fraudulent behavior immediately upon learning of his activities on behalf of KDH."
1047,8," Plaintiffs allege that the racketeering activity occurred for 29 months, from the time Koebel first approached Mossberg in March 
1998 until August 2000. However, since the scheme as alleged could not have been implemented, incorporating requisite 
predicate acts, until USA Certified was formed, 26 months is the appropriate outside range in which the predicate acts could 
have been implemented. "
1057,1, By separate order issued concurrently with this Memorandum Decision the court is setting forth its rulings on those objections.
1057,2," All other chapter, section and rule references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1330 and to the Federal Rules of 
Bankruptcy Procedure, Rules 1001-9036, unless otherwise indicated. "
1058,3," Throughout this Memorandum Decision, except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term ""Plan"" refers both to 
PG&E's Plan and the CPUC Plan, including later amendments. Among other things, the CPUC Plan has been amended to be a 
joint plan of CPUC and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. "
1059,4," HN1[
] ""Confirmation of the plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for further financial reorganization, of the debtor or any successor to the debtor under the plan, unless such liquidation or reorganization is proposed in the plan."" 11 
U.S.C. § 1129(a)(11)."
1059,5," PG&E still needs to worry about those claims in the future because, as noted, the court's estimation has no other effect beyond 
Plan feasibility, the Antitrust Claims have not actually been tried, and nothing in the court's discussion could prevent a United 
States district court in the future from reaching an entirely different result than that reached by this court in this estimation. "
1061,6, The following discussion constitutes the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052(a). 
1062,7," The only other vertically-integrated electric utility in PG&E's Northern California service territory is the Sacramento Municipal 
Electricity District (""SMUD""), a publicly-owned entity that serves approximately 522,000 customers in the greater Sacramento 
area."
1062,8," The business of electricity consists of activities in three adjacent markets: (a) the generation of electricity at power plants in 
which turbine-generators are powered by various energy sources, including water (""hydro""), natural gas or other fuels, nuclear 
reactors or steam produced by the heat of subterranean magma (""geothermal""); (b) the long distance transmission of electricity, 
by means of high-voltage transmission lines and associated equipment, from power plants to local communities; and (c) the local 
(or ""retail"") distribution of electricity to individual customers in each community. "
1063,9," The process by which voters decide to have public agencies -- municipalities, irrigation districts, and rural electrification districts 
and the like (collectively, ""Muni's"") -- provide local electrical distribution services to their citizen customers is commonly called 
""municipalization."" Typically, the municipalization process involves voter approval of a ballot measure, followed by the 
acquisition of appropriate local distribution facilities by construction, condemnation or both, and the subsequent operation of 
those facilities by the Muni. "
1064,10," Put differently, least-cost planning involves a departure from the protocol of ""merit dispatch"" (that is, transmitting power from 
the cheapest available source), and instead involves obtaining power from more costly, local generation sources (""out of merit 
dispatch"" or ""generation re-dispatch""), thereby relieving congestion on long-distance transmission lines. While this practice 
raises the short-term costs of providing power locally when needed, out-of-merit dispatch costs can represent a total lower-cost 
solution than building more costly transmission facilities. This economic trade-off can lower costs for transmission customers 
(such as Objectors) who would otherwise have been required to share the costs of building additional transmission facilities. "
1065,11," By its PG&E, N. Cal. Power Agency v. PG&E & the Cal. Indep. Sys. Operator Corp., 100 F.E.R.C. P61,233 (Aug. 30, 2002)) 
(""August 30 Order""), FERC has determined that the transmission portions of the Stanislaus Commitments are within its 
jurisdiction and has required PG&E to file certain sections of them with FERC. "
1068,12," PG&E filed written notice of intent to terminate the SVP IA on November 15, 2001. "
1070,13," Substantially all of the damages projected by Objectors' damage expert are based on this new form of congestion costs, 
which, therefore, assumes a change in ISO and FERC policy."
1070,14," Objectors concede that if they are allocated sufficient CRRs, they will be substantially insulated from any costs associated with 
excess congestion rents, thereby substantially mitigating their damage claims. "
1072,15," The existence of a few Muni's does not show that there are insignificant barriers to entry into the market for local distribution. 
PG&E grew to acquire the monopoly power it has today, and PG&E has not shown that the same factors which allowed Muni's 
to develop historically would be true today. See MetroNet, 325 F.3d at 1104 (""the fact that entry has occurred does not 
necessarily preclude the existence of 'significant entry barriers.'"") (citation omitted)."
1072,16," Customers in PG&E's Northern California service territory do not obtain local distribution services from any of California's other 
three vertically-integrated electric utilities -- Southern California Edison Company, The Department of Water and Power of the 
City of Los Angeles, or San Diego Gas and Electric Company. "
1074,17," The disputes between CL&P and the Muni's in City of Groton were more involved than the refusal to wheel, a denial of an 
essential facility and price squeeze presented to this court in the estimation proceedings, but there were similar theories 
advanced by the plaintiffs there. "
1075,18," By ""significant"" congestion charges the court means significant in relation to the costs of increasing local generation capacity, 
not the several billion dollars in damages claimed by Objectors."
1075,19," In footnote 11 the Ninth Circuit alludes to a second condition that probably must be satisfied, viz., that the power to eliminate 
competition must be ""at least relatively permanent."" Id. at 544 n. 11 (citations omitted). The court considers PG&E's power over 
its transmission system sufficiently ""permanent,"" notwithstanding ISO's role, for the reasons discussed below."
1075,20," The Ninth Circuit has pointed out ""that the second element is effectively part of the definition of what is an essential facility in 
the first place,"" and that ""the fourth element basically raises the familiar question of whether there is a legitimate business 
justification for the refusal to provide the facility …."" City of Anaheim, 955 F.2d at 1380. "
1077,21," Objectors arguably have not established the fourth element of their essential facilities claim: that it would be feasible for PG&E 
to provide the access they demand. Objectors have demanded ""firm"" transmission, but by definition PG&E could only provide 
such transmission at the expense of its other customers. CPUC generally disapproves of such favored treatment, as shown by 
its suspension of the Reciprocity Agreement between PG&E and Palo Alto. Therefore, it is not clear that PG&E would be 
permitted to provide Objectors with greater access than it did, at least under any new agreement. That begs the question 
whether PG&E could have assured such firm transmission under an existing agreement, such as by designating the IAs as 
ETCs. The parties have not addressed this issue as part of their essential facilities analysis, and the court does not decide it. "
1078,22," The parties have argued whether PG&E has shown a business justification for its conduct, which may be the other side of the 
coin. The court will address that issue below, after considering PG&E's other affirmative defenses. "
1079,23," See Cost Mgmt. Svcs., Inc. v. Wash. Nat. Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 943 n. 7 (9th Cir. 1996) (discussing use of term ""filed rate 
doctrine"")."
1079,24," Even though the court has rejected Objectors' price squeeze theory, the filed rate doctrine would be unavailable to counter 
that theory of antitrust liability. City of Kirkwood, 671 F.2d 1173 at 1179. "
1080,25," The court recognizes that CPUC disfavored vesting (or any other mechanisms that would inhibit the transition to a more free-
market approach). Nevertheless, PG&E has not shown that CPUC either had a flat rule against vesting or, in any particular 
instance, compelled PG&E to sell its generating facilities without vesting, regardless of any effects that might have had on 
Objectors. The court will return to this issue in connection with PG&E's business justification defense."
1080,26," On September 7, 2000, California AB 970 was filed with the Secretary of State. Section 7 of AB 970, Section 399.15, states: HN23[
] … within 180 days of the effective date of this section, [CPUC], in consultation with the Independent System 
Operator, shall take all of the following actions …: (a)(1) Identify and undertake those actions necessary to reduce or remove constraints on the state's existing electrical 
transmission and distribution system, including [reinforcement of existing transmission capacity and other specific 
actions]. The commission shall, in consultation with the Independent System Operator, give first priority to those 
geographical regions where congestion reduces or impedes electrical transmission and supply."
1080,2000, Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 329 (A.B. 970) (West).
1080,27," The doctrine comes from E. R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464, 81 S. Ct. 523 
(1961), reh. denied, 365 U.S. 875, 5 L. Ed. 2d 864, 81 S. Ct. 899, and UMW v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626, 85 
S. Ct. 1585 (1965). "
1081,28," The court is persuaded by the reasoning of Norcen Energy Res. Ltd. v. PG&E, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21347, 1994 WL 
519461 (N.D. Cal. 1994), that if Objectors had established PG&E's liability under the price squeeze doctrine that would not moot 
the Noerr-Pennington defense. See also City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382, 111 S. 
Ct. 1344 (1991) (discussed in Norcen). "
1082,29," Objectors claim that PG&E blocked their attempts to arrange (and pay for) upgraded transmission by exaggerating the costs of 
transmission upgrades, interposing numerous delays in providing relevant data, and otherwise creating procedural road-blocks. 
The court makes no determination on this issue. The court does recognize, however, that Objectors had less incentive to press 
any demands for an upgrade in transmission while PG&E was absorbing net congestion charges. "
1083,30," The AB 970 Report does not determine whether the remaining constraints in the Bay Area would be better served by 
upgrading transmission or local generation (or some other alternative such as conservation). The report notes that current 
planning studies (including the report itself) do not explicitly weigh the costs and benefits of additional transmission 
improvements, and ""with a few exceptions, such decisions are not well documented."" In the absence of such data the AB 970 
Report apparently focused on projects that PG&E had already begun or proposed -- in other words, PG&E itself appears to have 
determined that transmission, rather than local generation, is the preferred alternative for most (if not all) of the projects 
discussed in the AB 970 Report. "
1086,31," On January 23, 2003, PG&E filed a motion in limine to exclude the expert testimony of Objectors' damages expert, Dr. Michael 
C. Keeley. On January 27, 2003, Objectors filed a preliminary opposition to that motion (supplemented later, arguing among 
other things that any analysis under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 
(1993), should be deferred until after all the evidence has been considered because this is a non-jury trial.) After hearing 
testimony from Dr. Keeley and PG&E's expert, Dr. Roy Shanker, the court deferred that issue for resolution in this Memorandum 
Decision. The court is persuaded by Objectors' opposition and by the portion of their reply brief related to damages that Dr. Keeley's 
analysis is based upon sufficient facts or data, the product of sufficiently reliable principles and methods, and has been applied 
with sufficient reliability that it should not be excluded from evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 702. That being said, the testimony has 
proven to have little probative value to aid Objectors' cause. "
1093,1," At the request of DDI, the Findings and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge issued on May 9, 2003 has 
been placed under seal. This redacted version, which will be filed of public record, deletes the putative trade secret information 
that DDI claims is entitled to legal protection. The FBI parties have agreed to the redactions."
1093,2," The first claim of the '156 patent contains six steps for making flash frozen, free flowing ice cream beads:"
1093,1, . Preparing an alimentary composition for freezing;
1093,2, . Dripping the alimentary composition into a freezing chamber;
1093,3, . Freezing the dripping alimentary composition into beads;
1093,4," . Storing the frozen beads at a temperature at least as low as -20 [degrees] F so as to maintain the beads in a free flowing 
state for an extended period of time;"
1093,5, . Bringing the beads to a temperature between substantially -10 [degrees] F and - 20 [degrees] F prior to serving; and
1093,6," . Serving the beads for consumption at a temperature between substantially -10 [degrees] F and -20 [degrees] F so that 
the beads are free flowing when served. (DDI MSJ Resp. App., Exh. 44 at 1600, col. 6, ln. 41-57)."
1093,3," As part of this action, DDI also sued the eight former dealers. The claims against F. Robert Esty, Jr., Victor Bauer, Jack Miller, 
James Perez, Jeanine Matone, Daniel Kilcoyne, Shawn P. Kilcoyne, and Daniel Dopko were dismissed for lack of personal 
jurisdiction. See Frosty Bites, Inc. v. Dippin' Dots, Inc., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11043, 2002 WL 1359704 (N.D. Tex. Jun. 20, 
2002). "
1094,4," The MDL proceeding consists of eight related actions. In five of those cases, DDI and its founder, Curt Jones, sued various FBI 
manufacturers and distributors for patent infringement, trademark and trade dress infringement, misappropriation of trade 
secrets, and breach of contract. The other three actions were brought by former FBI manufacturers and distributors seeking a 
declaratory judgment that the '156 patent is invalid and unenforceable. See In re Dippin' Dots Patent Litigation,     F. Supp.2d    , 
2002 WL 32072485 at *1 (N.D. Ga. Mar. 31, 2003). On December 20, 2002, the instant case was conditionally transferred to the 
Northern District of Georgia for possible consolidation with the MDL proceeding. However, after the FBI parties objected, the 
MDL Panel vacated its conditional transfer order on April 10, 2003. "
1095,5," Although the parties invoke federal subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, DDI's trade secrets claim does not 
arise ""under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."" Therefore, the court must use traditional conflicts of law 
principles in determining which state law governs this claim."
1095,6," The court notes that none of the parties to this action reside in Texas. DDI is an Illinois corporation with its principal place of 
business in Paducah, Kentucky. Nicholas Angus is a British citizen who lives in Nottingham, United Kingdom. Thomas R. Mosey 
resides in Mystic, Connecticut. "
1096,7," The MDL court based its decision on the Kentucky Uniform Trade Secrets Act, which is identical in all material respects to the 
FUTSA. Compare KENT. REV. STAT. ANN. § 365.880 with FLA. STAT. ANN. § 688.002. "
1097,8," The summary judgment record in this case contains additional evidence that was not before the MDL court. This evidence 
consists mainly of information and packaging materials provided to Angus and Mosey by two former DDI dealers, Victor Bauer 
and Barry Bass. (See FBI MSJ App. at 475-77, PP 19-30). However, as the FBI parties correctly note, none of this evidence is 
material to the issue of whether DDI took reasonable measures to protect its putative trade secrets. "
1098,9," The MDL court also determined that DDI's product trade dress is functional under the Morton-Norwich test utilized by the 
Federal Circuit. See In re Morton-Norwich Products, Inc., 671 F.2d 1332, 1340-41(CCPA 1982). HN8[
] The Morton-Norwich 
factors are: (1) the existence of a utility patent disclosing the utilitarian advantage of the design; (2) advertising materials in 
which the originator of the design touts the design's utilitarian advantages; (3) the availability to competitors of functionally 
equivalent designs; and (4) facts indicating that the design results in a comparatively simple or cheap method of manufacturing 
the product. Id. In its opinion, the MDL court held that the first, second, and third factors weighed heavily in favor of a finding that 
DDI's trade dress is functional. In re Dippin' Dots Patent Litigation, 2002 WL 32072485 at *22-23."
1098,10," Although the FBI parties do not address DDI's counterclaims for breach of contract, statutory and common law trademark 
infringement, and unfair competition in their motion for summary judgment, the court sua sponte questions whether these claims 
remain viable in light of the resolution of the trade secrets and trade dress claims. "
1099,11," In their summary judgment brief, the FBI parties posit that ""when trade secret allegations are made with knowledge that no 
trade secrets exist, they are made in bad faith, and constitute an antitrust violation."" (FBI MSJ Resp. Br. at 2, citing CVD, Inc. v. 
Raytheon Co., 769 F.2d 842, 851 (1st Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1016, 106 S. Ct. 1198, 89 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1986)). 
However, some legal commentators have questioned the continued viability of CVD and its progeny, which seem to employ a 
purely subjective test to determine bad faith, after Professional Reals Estate Investors. See Robert H. Lande & Sturgis M. Sobin, 
Reverse Engineering of Computer Software and U.S. Antitrust Law, 9 HARV. J.L. & TECH. 237, 281 n.156 (1996); Daniel M. 
Wall, A Bright Line for Sham Litigation Claims, 7 ANTITRUST 47 (1993). But see Richard M. Brunnell, Sham Litigation Claims 
May Yet Survive Columbia Pictures, 8 ANTITRUST 33, 36 n.29 (1994) (suggesting that CVD may be consistent with 
Professional Real Estate Investors since it defines ""bad faith"" as an assertion of a trade secret with knowledge that no trade 
secrets exist) "
1100,12," In support of its ""bad faith"" argument, FBI relies on much of the same evidence that was used to show that DDI failed to use 
reasonable means to protect its trade secrets. More particularly, FBI points out that DDI employees routinely discarded storage 
bags and boxes in public trash bins with no restrictions on the methods of disposal. (FBI MSJ App., Exh. 13 at 190-92 & Exh. 14 
at 218-22). DDI also disseminated a corporate videotape and had a temporary internet posting which revealed its manufacturing, 
packaging, storage and transportation methods, including the use of [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. (Id., Exh. 21 at 446-
47 & Exh. 46 at 857). Additionally, FBI suggests that DDI knew that its [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] were smaller than 
FBI's, but withheld this information from its experts. (Id., Exh. 19 at 365, Exh. 61 at 981 & Exh. 62 at 982). This evidence, even if 
viewed in the light most favorable to FBI, does not establish that DDI's trade secrets claim was ""objectively baseless in the 
sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits."" Professional Real Estate Investors, 113 S. Ct. 
at 1928. "
1112,*," While Cavalier brought its monopolization and attempted monopolization claims under both federal and State antitrust laws, Va. 
Code §59.1-9,-6.12, there does not seem to be any dispute between the parties that disposition under the federal law also 
justifies as a similar disposition under the State statute.  See Oksanen v. Page memorial Hosp., 945 F.2d 696, 710 (4th Cir. 
1991) (noting that Virginia follows federal law on antitrust issues). "
1120,1," The ILEC in Covad advanced three main arguments: (1) that the competiting local exchange carrier (""CLEC"") complained only 
about the terms or quality of access, but did not allege an actual denial of access to the essential facility; (2) that the CLEC 
sought ""preferential access"" to the local loop, which would require the ILEC to ""abandon its facilities""; and (3) that the CLEC was 
attempting to force the ILEC to construct new facilities or alter the nature of its business and become a renter of facilities.  
Covad, 299 F.3d at 1286. Verizon makes precisely these same three arguments in this case, and the majority accepts the third 
as a basis for affirming the dismissal. Maj. Op. at 15. "
1121,2," I note that this ""fact"" has been discussed in the parties' briefs and effectively has been judicially noticed by the majority, despite 
the fact that it is not a part of the complaint or any other part of the record. That some evidence should be introduced to support 
the proposition that Verizon has never leased such facilities, at least since 1996, further justifies letting this case go forward so 
that a factual record may be developed. "
1154,1," Barr and Rugby are in the business of, among other things, manufacturing and marketing generic drugs. Rugby was the U.S. 
generic drug subsidiary of HMR until February 1998, when Rugby was acquired by Watson, a company that produces and 
distributes generic and brand-name drugs. Watson is not a signatory to any of the allegedly unlawful agreements."
1154,2," Four complaints were filed in this case, each of which raises virtually identical arguments: Direct Purchaser Complaints: Second Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint filed by Louisiana Wholesale Drug Company, Inc. and Arthur's 
Drug Store, Inc. on behalf of a class of direct purchasers (""D.P. Compl.""); "
1155,," Second Amended Complaint filed by CVS Meridan, Inc. and Rite Aid Corporation (""CVS Compl.""); Indirect Purchaser Complaints: (3) Indirect Purchaser Class Plaintiffs' Amended and Consolidated Class Action Complaint filed by Marie LoCurto and other 
plaintiffs (""I.P. Compl.""); and (4) Second Amended Class Action Complaint filed by Mark Aston and other plaintiffs (""Aston Compl."")."
1155,3," HN3[
] The Hatch-Waxman Amendments require a NDA to list any patents ""which claim[] the drug … or which claim[] a 
method of using such drug and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not 
licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug."" 21 U.S.C. § 355(b)(1). The FDA maintains and 
publishes this information in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly referred to as 
the ""Orange Book""). See id. § 355(j)(7)(A). "
1156,4," As this court previously noted, HN5[
] It seems relatively clear … that if there is no resolution of the patent litigation and a stay is not granted, and the 
patent holder has not obtained preliminary injunctive relief, the ANDA filer may begin to market its product. In such an 
instance, the ANDA filer assumes the risk it might be found liable for infringing the pioneer manufacturer's patent. In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 166 F. Supp. 2d 740, 744 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (""Ciprofloxacin I"")."
1156,5," The facts pertinent to the current motions are drawn from each of plaintiffs' complaints and the parties' respective statements 
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1. Unless otherwise indicated, the facts are not in dispute."
1156,6," Specifically, Barr's ANDA sought permission to manufacture ciprofloxacin hydrochloride tablets, U.S.P 250 mg, 500 mg and 
750 mg. "
1157,7," Bayer notes that Barr did not, in fact, allege that its proposed generic product would not infringe the 444 Patent, if such patent 
was held to be valid and enforceable. See Bayer's Resp. to Pls.' Joint Statement of Material Facts Pursuant to Local Civ. R. 56.1 
(""Bayer's 56.1 Stat"") P 7 (citing Bayer App., Ex. 27). Instead, Barr maintained that the 444 Patent is invalid and unenforceable. 
See Pls.' J.A., Exs. H PP 15-19, I PP 16-23. By way of explanation, Barr's Chairman and CEO stated that, in this case, ""where 
the patent in question covers the active ingredient of the listed drug, the generic applicants' [i.e., Barr's] bioequivalent product 
necessarily infringes the patent. Hence, the only route for challenging the patent would be to claim that the patent is invalid."" 
Decl. of Bruce L. Downey, G.Defs.' Summ. J. Mem., Ex. A (""Downey Decl."") P 9; see also id. PP 17, 18."
1157,8," Plaintiffs assert in their complaints that, absent the stipulation, the 30-month statutory period would expire on January 4, 1994, 
see D.P. Compl. P 37; I.P. Compl. P 64, or January 6, 1994, see Aston Compl. P 66; CVS Compl. P 28. HN7[
] Although the 
automatic stay is ordinarily 30 months, ""in the case of new drug products, like Cipro, that contain active ingredients that have 
never before received FDA approval, 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(D)(ii) automatically extends the stay, in the event of an ANDA (IV) 
lawsuit, until 7.5 years after the date of the drug's initial approval by FDA, thus yielding an expiration date of April 22, 1995 in this 
case."" Mem. of Law in Supp. of Def. Bayer's Mot. to Dismiss all MDL-001383 Compls. (""Bayer's Mot. Dismiss Mem."") at 15 n.19. 
Plaintiffs conceded this fact at oral argument. See Tr. at 32:6-32:19."
1157,9," HMR, Rugby, Sherman, and Apotex were not parties to the patent litigation. At the time of the Settlement Agreements, Barr, 
HMR and Rugby were parties to the Litigation Funding Agreement, see Pls.' J.A., Ex. P, and Sherman was the majority 
shareholder of both Barr and Apotex. See id., Ex. D PP 1, 2. Therefore, Bayer contends that it was proper to enter into "
1158,," agreements with these parties because they participated either directly or indirectly in the patent challenge. See Bayer's 56.1 
Stat. P 17. This contention is discussed infra."
1158,10," These patents claim, among other things, starting materials and intermediaries for use in preparing Cipro, some of the 
processes for preparing Cipro, and the specific tablet, oral suspension, and intravenous formulations that Bayer uses in its 
proprietary Cipro products. See generally Decl. of Dr. Wolfgang Petrovicki, Bayer App., Ex. 23 (""Petrovicki Decl."")."
1158,11," The ""Barr Escrow Account"" is a bank account established by Barr and HMR to receive payments made by Bayer. On January 
9, 1997, Barr and HMR executed an escrow agreement that established this account and provided that Barr and HMR each 
would receive one-half of all funds paid by Bayer into the account. See Pls.' J.A., Ex. F."
1158,12," Plaintiffs dispute this fact. See All Pls.' Joint Reply of Material Facts Pursuant to Local Civ. R. 56.1 (""Pls.' Reply 56.1"") P 37."
1158,13," The parties disagree as to whether the Supply Agreement and Settlement Agreements were intended to be confidential. Under 
these agreements, the parties were permitted to make, and did indeed make, press releases regarding the settlement and the 
major terms of the Supply Agreement. See Pls.' J.A., Ex. B § 8; id., Ex. C § 6; id., Ex. E § 13.02; see also G.Defs.' App., Tabs 
10, 11. In addition, Barr submitted a redacted copy of the Supply Agreement in a public Securities and Exchange Commission 
filing. See Pls.' J.A., Ex. Z. Nonetheless, ""with the intention to keep the terms of the Settlement Agreements and the Supply "
1159,," Agreement"" confidential, each agreement obligates the parties to use ""reasonable best efforts"" not to disclose the terms of the 
agreements, except as provided by law, regulation or government authority. Id., Ex. B § 7; id., Ex. C § 6; id., Ex. D § 4."
1159,14," Defendants' arguments in support of their motions to dismiss are contained in five memoranda: (5) Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendants Bayer AG's and Bayer Corporation's Motion to Dismiss All MDL-001383 
Complaints (""Bayer Mot. Dismiss Mem.""); (6) Memorandum of Law in Support of the Generic Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Direct Purchasers' Second Amended 
and Consolidated Class Action Complaint (""G.Defs.' Mot. Dismiss Mem.""); (7) Memorandum of Law in Support of the Generic Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' 
Amended Consolidated Complaint (""G.Defs' I.P. Pls. Mem.""); (8) Memorandum of Law in Support of the Generic Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Organizational Plaintiffs' Second 
Amended Complaint [i.e., Aston Complaint] (""G.Defs.' Org. Pls. Mem.""); and (9) Memorandum of Law in Support of Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss (""Watson Mot. Dismiss Mem."")."
1159,15," To date, Bayer AG has been served with complaints only in the consolidated indirect purchaser case and the CVS Meridian, 
Inc. case. Accordingly, Bayer AG moves to dismiss only those complaints with which it has been properly served."
1159,16, Neither Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Complaint nor the CVS Complaint name Watson as a defendant.
1159,17, This argument will be addressed infra after the discussion of plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment. 
1160,18," All of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs seek treble damages for defendants' alleged violations of the Sherman Act. Indirect 
Purchaser Plaintiffs seek treble damages only for defendants' alleged violations of the antitrust laws of Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs' states."
1160,19, All plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to enjoin defendants from continuing their allegedly unlawful conduct. 
1161,20," Unlike the CVS Complaint, the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Complaint does not expressly espouse this theory. Rather, the 
complaint alleges that ""but for the agreements, Barr would have received final FDA approval of its generic version of Cipro, and 
would have come to market with that version."" D.P. Compl. P 61. Nonetheless, in their memorandum, Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs 
cite paragraph 61 of the their complaint in support of the theory that but for the challenged agreements, Barr would have 
prevailed in the patent litigation. See D.P. Mot. Dismiss Mem. at 7. Construing the allegations of the complaint in favor of 
plaintiffs, and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges such a theory since 
the passage quoted above can be read to assert that Barr would have entered the market either pending the outcome of the 
patent litigation or upon a favorable outcome of such litigation. "
1162,21," Plaintiffs cite the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 
(1993), as supporting their theory that a claim can depend on establishing the but-for outcome of litigation. However, that citation 
is unpersuasive. The Court in Olano held that, for purposes of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a), the doctrine of 
prejudicial error requires that an error may have or probably influenced the underlying verdict of a case that has been tried. See 
507 U.S. at 734-35, 113 S. Ct. at 1777-78. Therefore, a party asserting ""forfeited-but-reversible-error"" in a criminal appeal must 
establish that the error may have affected the outcome of the proceedings. Id. at 732-35, 113 S. Ct. at 1776-78. However, proof 
that specific error may have or probably influenced a verdict is not as speculative as proving that the entire Cipro patent litigation 
would have been decided in Barr's favor if it had been tried."
1162,22," See Schein & Mylan, 301 F.3d 1306; Carlsbad, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24487, No. 01 Civ. 867-B (S.D. Cal. Oct. 24, 2001), 
Bayer App., Ex. 31."
1162,23," This court can take judicial notice of these cases since they are ""capable of accurate and ready determination"" through reliable 
sources. Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); see also Kramer v. Time Warner, Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 773 (2d Cir. 1991) (finding that ""a district 
court may take judicial notice of the contents of relevant public disclosure documents required to be filed with the SEC as facts 
'capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.'"") (quoting 
Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)); Bankers Trust Co. v. Freeman, 245 F.2d 200, 200 (2d Cir. 1957) (per curiam) (dismissing appeal as moot 
based on actions taken in a later case, of which the court took judicial notice). "
1164,24," For purposes of the stipulation, ""final judgment"" would not occur until the exhaustion of all appeals to the Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit or the expiration of the time permitted for such appeals. See CVS Compl. P 26."
1164,25," As an initial matter, this argument may be foreclosed by the stipulation among the parties to extend the statutory waiting 
period. Although the Aston Complaint alleges (and other complaints imply) that the stipulation between Bayer and Barr 
extending the waiting period was invalid, this argument is without merit. Plaintiffs assert that Bayer and Barr did not advise the 
district court of the statutory requirement that the period could be extended only if one of the parties fails to reasonably 
cooperate in expediting the lawsuit. See CVS Compl. P 27; see also 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). Moreover, plaintiffs allege that 
in fact neither Barr nor Bayer failed to cooperate in the prosecution of the patent litigation. See CVS Compl. P 27. However, a 
review of the stipulation reveals that Judge Knapp was apprised of the requirement set forth in 21 U.S.C. § 355(j) for extending 
the statutory stay, and in fact, the stipulation contains an example of the parties' failure to cooperate in commencing trial before 
the waiting period was scheduled to expire in April 1995. "
1165,26," This court recognizes that in Andrx, the D.C. Circuit rejected the argument that ""any rational actor … would not market its 
generic drug until the patent infringement suit against it was resolved,"" finding that a jury could infer from an agreement under 
which the patent holder paid the generic manufacturer to prevent market entry that but for the payments, the generic 
manufacturer would have entered the market. 256 F.3d at 809. For the reasons discussed infra in the context of plaintiffs' 
summary judgment motion, this court finds the underlying facts of the Andrx case (the same facts in the Cardizem case) 
distinguishable from the facts of this case and accordingly declines to follow the D.C. Circuit in this regard. "
1169,27," Subsequently, the parties in Warfarin settled their dispute pursuant to a Stipulation of Settlement and Compromise that was 
approved by the court. See generally No. 98 MDL 1232, 212 F.R.D. 231, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16375 (D. Del. Aug. 30, 2002) 
The settlement provides for the defendant to pay $ 44.5 million to settle the claims of a class that was certified by the court for "
1170,," settlement purposes only. See id., 212 F.R.D. at 243. Upon final approval of the settlement, all pending actions against the 
defendant were dismissed with prejudice. See id., 212 F.R.D. at 265. "
1171,28," Although the complaints allege that the Purchase Agreement was dated February 25, 1997, it was in fact dated August 25, 
1997. See Watson Mot. Dismiss Mem., Ex. A. P 1."
1171,29," This court can properly consider the entirety of the Purchase Agreement and the other two documents alleged by plaintiffs to 
establish Watson's anticompetitive conduct. HN18[
] The Second Circuit has stated that when deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), the court may consider documents attached to the complaint as exhibits or incorporated in it by 
reference without converting the motion to one for summary judgment. See Brass, 987 F.2d at 150 (citing Cortec, 949 F.2d at 
47-48). Watson has attached the Side Letter and Term Sheet to its memorandum. See Watson Mot. Dismiss Mem., Ex. A. 
Although plaintiffs did not attach any documents to their complaints, they do expressly refer to the Side Letter, Term Sheet and 
Purchase Agreement in their complaints. Therefore, these agreements may be considered on this motion. See Johns v. Town of 
East Hampton, 942 F. Supp. 99, 104 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (""It is well established that when a plaintiff fails to introduce a pertinent 
document as part of his pleading, a defendant may introduce that exhibit as part of his motion attacking the pleading."") (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted); Barnum v. Millbrook Care Ltd. Partnership, 850 F. Supp. 1227, 1230 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) 
(""The Agreement was partially incorporated in plaintiff's Amended Complaint. However, the entire Agreement has been 
submitted by Defendants, and may be duly considered by the Court upon a motion to dismiss."") (citations omitted). "
1172,30," In fact, the Term Sheet only provides that HMR will share the payments with Rugby: ""Rugby will receive one-half of any 
amounts received by Parent [HMR] under the [Supply Agreement] or the [Litigation Funding Agreement], other than payments 
made or related to events prior to the launch of the Product by Parent and Barr."" Watson's Mot. Dismiss Mem., Ex. A of Ex. A P 
7. Nonetheless, as noted above, the Side Letter provides for HMR and Watson to share one-half of any such amounts. See 
Watson's Mot. Dismiss Mem., Ex. A § 1."
1172,31," The relevant provision reads as follows: Transfer by Parent to Rugby will be at a price that achieves a target profit percentage to Rugby in relation to the then 
prevailing market price for the Product. No Product will be priced by Rugby as a loss leader, tie-in or in any other manner 
intended to increase the sale of other products then being sold by Rugby or any affiliate. Barr is also subject to such 
limitation on Product pricing. Watson Mot. Dismiss Mem., Ex. A. of Ex. A P 6."
1172,32," HN19[
] Where a generic drug is bioequivalent to a pioneer or brand-name drug, the FDA assigns the generic drug an ""AB"" 
rating. According to the FDA, a bioequivalent drug rated ""AB"" may be used and substituted interchangeably with the referenced 
brand-name drug. The complaints assert that Barr recognized these facts on its website. See, e.g., I.P. Compl. P 43."
1172,33," This argument seems illogical. Plaintiffs are interpreting the phrase ""any product AB-rated"" to include generic Cipro. Thus, 
plaintiffs are asserting that the Term Sheet prohibits Rugby from selling generic Cipro with Cipro during the terms of the 
distribution agreement. However, the Term Sheet contemplates Rugby distributing Cipro when it is supplied to HMR pursuant to 
the Litigation Funding Agreement and the Supply Agreement. These agreements both appear to contemplate Bayer supplying 
Cipro to be marketed under a generic label."
1172,34, Watson completed a successful tender offer for Schein in July 2000. See Aston Compl. P 90; I.P. Compl. P 108. 
1173,35," This court can adopt Watson's argument, because HN20[
] ""if the allegations of a complaint are contradicted by documents 
made a part therefore, the document controls and the court need not accept as true the allegations in the complaint."" Sazerac 
Co., Inc. v. Falk, 861 F. Supp. 253, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 1994); see also Kramer, 937 F.2d at 774 (""Were courts to refrain from 
considering [documents integral to a plaintiff's allegations], complaints that quoted only selected and misleading portions of such 
documents could not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) even though they would be doomed to failure."")."
1173,36," Moreover, although not properly before this court on a motion to dismiss, Schein no longer even owns an ANDA for generic 
Cipro. In fact, in January 2001, Schein transferred all rights to its ANDA for Cipro to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., who, 
according to Watson, is an independent third party. See Watson Mot. Dismiss Mem. at 7-8; see also Reply Mem. in Supp. of 
Def. Watson's Mot. to Dismiss, Ex. 1. "
1175,37," The statute reads as follows: HN24[
] ""Any action to enforce any cause of action under sections 15, 15aor 15c of this title shall be forever barred unless commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued."" 15 U.S.C. § 15b. "
1176,38," Defendants summarily claim that Organizational Plaintiffs would not be proper members of any indirect purchaser class action 
suit in any event because they would not satisfy the constitutional requirements for standing with regard to representative 
organizations. This argument is more fully briefed in Generic Defendants' motion to dismiss Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' state 
law claims. However, for the reasons set forth in this discussion dismissing Organizational Plaintiffs' claims as time-barred, this 
argument is rendered moot. "
1177,39," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) provides in relevant part: HN29[
] ""In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). "
1178,40," These plaintiffs also assert that defendants falsely represented to the public that Barr was vigorously challenging Bayer's 
patent rights. As an example, Organizational Plaintiffs quote Barr's website, on which it stated that ""Barr Laboratories actively 
challenges the patents protecting certain branded pharmaceutical products where it believes such patents are either invalid, 
unenforceable or not infringed by the Company's products."" Aston Compl. P 101. In their memoranda, however, plaintiffs appear 
to abandon this allegation."
1178,41," At first blush, it appears that Organizational Plaintiffs' allegations are based solely on the stipulation to extend the 30-month 
waiting period for FDA approval. However, construing the allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, one can infer from 
the second sentence of Paragraph 101 of the Aston Complaint that Organizational Plaintiffs claim that defendants fraudulently 
concealed the Settlement Agreements and the Supply Agreement, which they allege operate to ""stifle competition by Cipro 
generic equivalents."" Aston Compl. P 101."
1178,42," In addition, although not acknowledged in the Aston Complaint, Barr made a similar press release on the same day, which 
sets forth virtually identical information as the Bayer press release. See I.P. Compl. P 87. "
1179,43," In addition, the Hendrickson court found affirmative acts of concealment, such as burning and shredding incriminating 
documents, agreeing not to talk to any third parties regarding the conspiracy and agreeing that one member of the conspiracy 
would testify falsely if called before a grand jury. See 840 F.2d at 1084. "
1180,44," Specifically, Organizational Plaintiffs allege that ""on information and belief, plaintiff and members of the Class were unaware 
of, and could not through due diligence have discovered, the existence of these meetings and the unlawful agreements which 
resulted in the Stipulation."" Aston Compl. P 101."
1180,45," In fact, in their memorandum, plaintiffs acknowledge that the terms of the allegedly illicit agreements would put them on notice 
of an antitrust violation. Indeed, plaintiffs argue that the fact of the settlement (and the Consent Judgment) in and of itself does 
not lead to the conclusion that the parties violated the antitrust laws and that ""it is only the terms of the secret Cipro Agreements 
that gave Plaintiffs' notice of their claims arising out of the Cipro Agreements."" Indirect Purchaser Class Pls.' Mem. in Opp'n to all 
Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss the I.P. Compl. at 85. Plaintiffs neglect to mention the fact that the terms of the agreements were 
disclosed in press releases that were issued the very next day after the agreements were executed. "
1181,46," As Hovenkamp explains, ""the continuing violation issue only arises when the initial act violating the antitrust laws … has not 
been improperly concealed."" II Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 320c. In other words, if Organizational Plaintiffs had adequately 
alleged that defendant's conduct was not known to them, the fraudulent concealment rule would have tolled the statute in any 
event. See id. "
1184,47," Indeed, the cases cited by Bayer acknowledge such a practice. In those cases, the courts noted that a plaintiff cannot obtain 
final judgment for a dollar amount that represents a partial payment of the total amount sought under one claim. See Kirsch v. 
LOT Polish Airlines (In re Air Crash Disaster near Warsaw, Pol.), 979 F. Supp. 164, 167 (E.D.N.Y.) (""The Federal Rules do not 
permit entry of a partial judgment.""), aff'd sub nom. Filus v. Lot Polish Airlines, 133 F.3d 169 (2d. Cir. 1997); Primavera 
Familienstiftung v. Askin, 130 F. Supp. 2d 450, 539 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (""HN37[
] Despite the language of Rule 56(a) permitting a party to seek summary judgment on 'all or any part' of a claim, entry of a partial judgment as to a single claim is not permitted 
under the Federal Rules."") (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P 56(a)). In doing so, however, the courts recognized that a court can enter 
partial summary judgment that eliminated, before trial, that portion of the claim as to which there is no genuine issue of material 
fact. See Kirsch, 979 F. Supp. at 166-67; Primavera Familienstiftung, 130 F. Supp. 2d at 539. "
1186,48," HN44[
] The Second Circuit in Capital Imaging articulated a burden-shifting approach to the rule of reason. ""Plaintiff bears 
the initial burden of showing that the challenged conduct has had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the 
relevant market …."" 996 F.2d at 543. If the plaintiff meets this burden, ""the burden shifts to the defendant to offer evidence of the 
pro-competitive redeeming virtues of their combination."" Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Should the 
defendant offer such proof, the plaintiff must show that such pro-competitive objectives could be achieved through alternative 
means that are ""less prejudicial to competition as a whole."" Id. (citations omitted)."
1186,49," The Supply Agreement contains some exceptions to this limitation: Barr and HMR may manufacture Cipro to maintain 
qualifications of suppliers, qualify new suppliers, make qualifying batches, make validation batches, conduct product 
development work, or file a new ANDA for Cipro. See Pls.' J.A., Ex. E § 3.01. "
1187,50," In addition, if a court were to find the 444 Patent invalid or unenforceable as to a particular person (triggering a ""Generic 
Date"") or as to all persons (triggering an ""Invalidity Date""), see Pls.' J.A., Ex. E § 1.01, Bayer agreed to supply Cipro to Barr and 
HMR. See id. (defining ""Supply Period""); id. § 3.06 (setting forth royalty payment)."
1187,51," However, the Barr Settlement Agreement permits Barr to ""amend the certification relating to its Pending ANDAs to be a 
certification pursuant to Paragraph IV of the Act"" if the 444 Patent is ""declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent 
jurisdiction or by administrative determination or becomes invalid or unenforceable by operation of law."" Pls.' J.A., Ex. B § 5(a). "
1189,52," The court did acknowledge, however, that the agreement resolved Andrx's antitrust and unfair practice counterclaims against 
HMR. See Cardizem, 105 F. Supp. 2d at 705. "
1190,53," Notably, at the time of the challenged agreements in Terazosin, the FDA's ""successful defense"" requirement for 180-day 
exclusivity was still in effect. Thus, even if Geneva had final FDA approval of its tablet formulation, it could not market exclusively 
a generic terazosin hydrochloride tablet until it successfully defended its ANDA IV against Abbott in the patent infringement 
case. See 164 F. Supp. 2d at 1345. Under the Abbott/Geneva agreement, Geneva agreed to join and support any motion by 
Abbott in the patent infringement case to extend the 30-month statutory stay on FDA approval of its proposed tablet -- effectively 
delaying both FDA approval and resolution of the patent infringement suit."
1190,54," Abbott paid Zenith the initial $ 3 million payment in exchange for Zenith dropping its suit against Abbott, in which it claimed 
that Abbott improperly listed patents in the Orange Book. The $ 6 million quarterly payments were in exchange for Zenith 
refraining from distributing generic terazosin hydrochloride. See Terazosin, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 1346. "
1194,55," Plaintiffs emphasize that a court decision from 1989 placed the successful defense requirement in substantial doubt before the 
challenged agreements in this case were executed. See Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Young, 723 F. Supp. 1523 (D.D.C. 1989) (finding 
precursor policy of FDA allowing exclusivity only when ANDA IV filer has been sued in patent litigation unenforceable), vacated 
as moot, 43 F.3d 712 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The Inwood court enjoined the FDA's application of the requirement in that case, but the 
parties' subsequent settlement rendered the FDA's appeal moot. Despite plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary, Inwood does not 
undermine the conclusion that the successful defense requirement was enforceable and in effect in January 1997. Indeed, the 
FDA formalized the successful defense requirement as a regulation in 1994, despite the recognition that it was contrary to the 
decision in Inwood and subject to further attack. See Abbreviated New Drug Application Regulations; Patent and Exclusivity 
Provisions, 59 Fed. Reg. 50338 (Oct. 3, 1994) (promulgating 21 C.F.R. § 314.107 (c)(1)); id at 50352-53."
1194,56," This court recognizes that the court in Andrx rejected an argument by the generic manufacturer in the Cardizem case that it 
had no ability to put a ""cork in the bottle"" because, under prevailing law, it was entitled to exclusivity only if it successfully 
defended the patent litigation. See Andrx, 256 F.3d at 803. In doing so, the court stated that the agreement, although dated 
September 24, 1997, did not go into effect until three months after the circuit court ruling in Mova in July 1998. See id. Thus, the 
court stated that ""the timing of the Agreement and the demise of the successful defense requirement"" defeats the generic 
manufacturer's claim. Id. The Andrx case is distinguishable from this case. In this case, the challenged agreements were entered 
into in January 1997, two months before the initial district court ruling in Mova, which invalidated the successful defense 
requirement. When the agreements in Andrx were signed, there was uncertainty as to the successful defense regulation, as two 
conflicting district court decisions had been rendered. When the agreements in this case were executed, there was no such 
uncertainty."
1194,57," To corroborate their claims, plaintiffs submit various letters from Barr to regulatory agencies stating Barr's belief that amending 
its patent certification does not render it ineligible for 180-day exclusivity. See App. to Aff. of Joseph Lipofksy in Supp. of Indirect 
Purchaser Class Pls.' Reply Mem. of Law (""I.P. App.""), Ex. 22 at 5; see also Supp. Mem. in Supp. of Indirect Purchaser Class 
Pls.' Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (""I.P. Supp. Mem.""), Exs. 2, 5, 6. In one such letter dated August 13, 1999, Barr claimed that it still 
retained the 180-day exclusivity period for Cipro despite its amendment. See I.P. Supp. Mem., Ex. 5 at 5. "
1195,58," As in this case, in the tamoxifen citrate case, Barr was the first generic manufacturer to submit an ANDA IV, prompting a 
lawsuit by the brand-name manufacturer, which was ultimately settled. The corresponding agreement required Barr to (and Barr 
did in fact) amend its ANDA IV to an ANDA III."
1195,59," The Henney decision was subsequently vacated as moot because Pharmachemie, the applicant denied final approval 
because of Barr's claimed exclusivity, lost its challenge to the tamoxifen citrate patent. Pharmachemie thus could not obtain final 
approval at all (during the life of the patent), and the appeal was moot. See Pharmachemie, 276 F.3d at 629, 634. "
1196,60," Among other submissions, the proposed rules provided as follows: ""If the first applicant subsequently withdraws its application 
or changes or withdraws its paragraph IV certification, either voluntarily or as a result of a settlement or defeat in patent litigation, 
no ANDA applicant will be eligible for 180-day exclusivity."" 180-Day Generic Drug Exclusivity for Abbreviated New Drug 
Applications, 64 Fed. Reg. at 42875."
1196,61," Current FDA regulations provide that the FDA will approve subsequent ANDAs if ""the applicant submitting the first application 
is not actively pursuing approval of its abbreviated application …."" 21 C.F.R. § 314.107(c)(3). "
1197,62," It is fairly evident that the district courts in Cardizem and Terazosin did not employ this analysis and, instead, immediately 
labeled the challenged restraints per se illegal horizontal market allocation agreements. Indeed, the Cardizem court expressly 
stated that ""the anticompetitive effects of [HMR]'s patents are … not at issue."" 105 F. Supp. 2d at 701. In addition, theTerazosin 
court's discussion was noticeably silent with regard to the subject patents. To the extent that these courts ignored the 
exclusionary effects of the patents in their per se determination under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, defendants submit that 
those cases were incorrectly decided. It is not necessary to address this argument here because it is sufficient to reject the 
applicability of those cases as factually distinguishable. "
1198,63," For this reason, Barr's Chairman and CEO explained that Barr's only option for challenging the 444 Patent was to file an 
ANDA IV certifying that the 444 Patent was invalid. See Downey Decl. P 9."
1198,64," Of course, as previously mentioned, since the 444 Patent is a compound patent that covers the active ingredient in all Cipro 
products, any ANDA IV for a generic Cipro product will infringe the 444 Patent. Thus, Bayer, HMR and Rugby cannot file such 
ANDA IVs until the 444 Patent either is invalidated or expires. "
1199,65," At this point, it is worth reiterating that a Paragraph IV Certification can include one of two certifications with regard to the 
brand-name manufacturer's patents: (1) that the patent is invalid or (2) that the proposed product does not infringe the patent. 
See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii); see also 21 C.F.R. § 314.94(a)(12)(i)(A)(4). Defendants in this case emphasize that Barr's 
ANDA IV contained only the former certification. "
1201,66," ""Product"" is defined in the agreement as ""all oral dosages forms of ciprofloxacin presently or subsequently marketed by Bayer 
or any of its subsidiaries in the United States under a New Drug Application or a Supplemental New Drug Application of Bayer or 
any of its subsidiaries and pursuant to or under the authority of (i) the Patents or (ii) the Patents and other patents owned by 
Bayer or any of its subsidiaries …."" Pls.' J.A., Ex. E § 2."
1201,67," The patents in existence at the time of the Settlement Agreement -- 12 U.S. patents and two U.S. patent applications -- are 
listed on Schedule 1 to that agreement. See id., Ex. B, Sch. 1. Since the challenged agreements were executed, two of the 
patents expired, and one of the referenced applications has matured into two additional U.S. patents. See Petrovicki Decl. P 3. 
In addition, Bayer has abandoned the other patent application that was referenced in Schedule 1. See id. P 3 & n.2. "
1202,68," For this reason, defendants argue that plaintiffs have no present injury and, thus, lack standing to seek a declaration that the 
challenged agreements are per se illegal based on alleged restraints that will not become relevant until the 444 Patent expires 
later this year. It is not necessary to determine this issue because, for the reasons discussed, plaintiffs' argument does not 
support per se treatment."
1202,69," Bayer asserts that it was entitled to include the additional patents in the agreements to avoid undefined future disputes. See 
Bayer Summ. J. Mem. at 47. The cases cited by Bayer, however, do not support this proposition. For instance, in Foster v. 
Hallco Manufacturing Co., the parties' settlement included only those patents at issue in the litigation (and their foreign 
counterparts). See 947 F.2d 469 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Similarly, in Proctor & Gamble Co. v. Paragon Trade Brands, Inc., the patents 
included in the settlement were limited to those that were either the subject of current litigation or were actively being disputed by 
the parties. See 61 F. Supp. 2d 102, 104-05 (D. Del. 1996). "

1217,16," During Oral Argument, on May 5, 2003, counsel for Plaintiffs argued that Marin Tug is not on point because the Court there 
was addressing the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage (the ""IIPEA tort"") and not the tort of 
intentional interference with contractual relations (the ""IICR tort""). Preliminarily, the Court notes that there are two business torts 
alleged by Plaintiffs against DIRECTV: 1) intentional interference with contractual relations, specifically, the Member Agreements 
between NRTC and Plaintiffs, and 2) intentional interference with prospective economic relationship, specifically ""the prospective 
economic advantage that would inure to Plaintiffs from selling Premium Services … and other services to their existing and 
future subscribers."" SAC in Case No. 00-368 at P67 and SAC in Case No. 00-2117 at P84. Thus, even if Plaintiffs are correct 
that Marin Tug's holding is limited to the IIPEA tort, which as discussed infra they are not, it would still apply to their second 
business tort claim."

1218,19," Even if the ""stranger"" test in Marin Tug was dicta, it is still entitled to great weight. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 
U.S. 44, 67, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252, 116 S. Ct. 1114 (1996) HN8[
] (""although technically dicta, … an important part of the Court's 
rationale for the result it reache[s] is entitled to greater weight.""). "
1219,20," The Court also finds of some persuasive value the fact that other courts have held that HN11[
] a third-party beneficiary to a 
contract or someone who is not a ""stranger"" to such a contract cannot, as a matter of law, be sued for tortious interference with 
the contract. See Iraola & Cia, S.A. v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 325 F.3d 1274, 1284 (11th Cir. 2003) (""[Plaintiff] has presented no 
evidence that [the defendants] were strangers to [the plaintiff's] relationships with [its former employees] Alpert and Jensen. 
Instead, the record demonstrates that [the defendants] were intimately entangled with the contract and the business relationship "
1220,," giving rise to and underpinning Alpert's and Jensen's relations with the plaintiff. As parties to an interwoven contractual 
agreement, [the defendants] do not qualify as strangers tortiously interfering with [the plaintiff's] contractual relations.""); see also

be liable for tortious interference with contractual relations, the defendant must be a stranger to both the contract and the 
business relationship giving rise and underpinning the contract."")."
1220,21," The Court need not address DIRECTV's second argument that claim 2 must fail because Plaintiffs cannot show that DIRECTV 
acted unlawfully."
1220,22," A violation of ""court-made"" law is, for example, a violation of a prior court order. See, e.g., Hewlett v. Squaw Valley Ski. Corp., 
54 Cal. App. 4th 499, 533-35, 63 Cal. Rptr. 2d 118 (1997) (holding that violations of a court's temporary restraining order can be 
redressed as an ""unlawful"" act claim under the UCL). "
1221,23," Here, this would be the alleged breach by DIRECTV of the DBS Agreement with NRTC."
1221,24," For this proposition, the Watson Labs. court cited to Allied Grape Growers v. Bronco Wine Co., 203 Cal. App. 3d 432, 249 Cal. 
Rptr. 872 (1988). In Allied Grape, a breach of contract was found to have created a supportable section 17200 claim only after 
that breach was found to have independently violated three statutes of the California Food and Agricultural Code. See Allied, 
203 Cal. App. 3d at 451-54. "
1222,25," Essentially, DIRECTV's two arguments can be summarized as follows: to prevail on a claim under the UCL ""unfair"" prong, a 
plaintiff must:"
1222,1," ) be a competitor of the defendant and prove that the Defendant's conduct meets the test set forth in Cel-Tech; or 2) be a 
member of the general public and prove that the gravity of the harm to the plaintiff outweighs the utility of the defendant's 
conduct."
1222,26," Incidentally, in paraphrasing this portion of Watson Labs., DIRECTV states: ""evidence that indicated harm to plaintiff's 
commercial interests, rather than showing harm to competition or consumers, does not establish 'unfair' conduct."" Mem. of P's & 
A's in Support of DIRECTV's Reply at 20:16-18 (emphasis added). The term ""consumers"" is not part of the Watson Labs. 
opinion. "
1223,27," For purposes of trial on this issue, the threshold question to be submitted to the jury is whether Plaintiffs compete with 
DIRECTV. If the jury answers this question in the affirmative, then Plaintiffs' ""unfair"" UCL claim will necessarily fail since Plaintiffs 
have not, in their opposition to DIRECTV's Motion No. 2, raised a genuine issue of material fact whether DIRECTV's conduct 
""threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the spirit or policy of those laws. . ., or otherwise significantly 
threatens or harms competition."" Cel-Tech Communications, Inc., 20 Cal. 4th at 187. If, on the other hand, the jury finds that 
Plaintiffs do not compete with DIRECTV, then the jury will be allowed to determine whether DIRECTV's conduct is ""unfair"" under 
the UCL, i.e., whether the gravity of the alleged harm to Plaintiffs outweighs the utility of DIRECTV's conduct."

] Sophisticated companies, like Plaintiffs here, are not members of the ""general public."" See Rosenbluth Int'l., Inc. v. Superior Court, 101 Cal. App. 4th 1073, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 844, 847 (2002). "
1225,29," In their supplemental briefing submitted to the Court following oral argument, Plaintiffs advance the novel argument that the 
revenues they paid to DIRECTV under the Seamless Marketing Agreement satisfy the first ground for restitution under Korea 
Supply. See Supplemental Opposition at 5:2-24. However, Plaintiffs have never suggested in this case that their Section 17200 
Claims are somehow premised, or even related, to unfair business practices by DIRECTV under the Seamless Marketing 
Agreement, an agreement that is the subject of Case No. 01-6220 (the ""SMA Case""). Indeed, Plaintiffs had stipulated, on May 8, 
2003, to sever the trial of the of the SMA Case from the other consolidated cases. On May 19, 2003, Plaintiffs lodged with the 
Court a proposed stipulation withdrawing their May 8, 2003 stipulation to sever the SMA Case."
1225,30," Following Oral Argument on May 5, 2003, the Court requested additional briefing on the issue of ""whether Plaintiffs have a 
vested interest in the revenues they are seeking under their Unfair Competition Claim, i.e., whether the second test under Korea 
Supply … has been met."" See May 7, 2003 Minute Order. DIRECTV filed its Supplemental Brief on May 12, 2003. Plaintiffs filed 
their Supplemental Opposition on May 15, 2003. DIRECTV filed its Supplemental Reply on May 16, 2003."

1225,32, Jerry L. Arnold is Pegasus' damages expert.
1225,33, Christian W. Hughes is the Class's damages expert. 
1226,34," In support of their Supplemental Opposition, Plaintiffs submitted declarations from Messrs. Hughes and Arnold. In their 
declarations, the two experts now state that Plaintiffs' lost profits are the same as DIRECTV's gain. See Hughes Decl., P2 (""my 
analysis is the same for both [UCL and tortious interference] claims, and require no differentiation between them.""); Arnold Decl., 
P3 (""There is no difference between the 'damages' outlined in my report and the funds I would opine that DIRECTV owe to 
Pegasus as restitution.""). However, Plaintiffs' two experts have no analysis to support their conclusions that their restitution 
analysis would be the same as the damages analysis they appear to have actually conducted. See Daubert v. Merell Dow 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993); see also Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory Committee 
Notes HN26[
] (Daubert requires ""more than simply taking the expert's word for it.""). "
1227,35," In its Supplemental Brief, DIRECTV did not address the issue of whether Plaintiffs have a vested interest in the money they 
are seeking on their Launch Fee Claim. DIRECTV, however, addressed this issue in its Supplemental Reply in response to 
Plaintiffs' Supplemental Opposition. See DIRECTV's Supplemental Reply at 5:4-24. The crux of DIRECTV's argument, as 
discussed infra, is that the additional evidence submitted by Plaintiffs in the form of declarations by their two experts should be 
stricken as sham. Additionally, in footnote 7 of its Supplemental Reply, DIRECTV states that ""NRTC was not required to share 
[the Launch Fees it received from DIRECTV] with Plaintiffs…."" See DIRECTV's Supplemental Reply at 5-6, fn. 7 (citing Exh. 175 
at 337:10-358:8). Exhibit 175 to the Dean Declaration is an excerpt from the deposition of Steven Berman. Preliminarily, the 
Court presumes that DIRECTV meant to cite to pages 337 through 338 since only pages 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341 and 396 
were attached. Nevertheless, the Court reviewed all the Berman deposition testimony attached under Exhibit 175 but found no 
support for DIRECTV's argument that NRTC was not required to share with Plaintiffs the Launch Fees it received from 
DIRECTV. Instead, the Berman deposition testimony deals with the issue of whether DIRECTV had received certain Launch 
Fees and incentives from third-parties and whether it shared them with NRTC."
1227,36," DIRECTV also argues that Launch Fees are not part of Plaintiffs' Section 17200 Claim. The Court disagrees. The allegations 
regarding the Launch Fees were included in Plaintiffs' SAC and incorporated into their Section 17200 Claims. See, e.g.,

any documentary material, or may have any information, which documentary material or information is relevant to a civil

specified therein, whichever period is longer, the person served may file in the circuit court . . . a petition for an order of the 
court modifying or setting aside the demand . . . . We know that the CIDs were based solely upon the Attorney General's authority to investigate antitrust violations for several 
reasons. First, each CID said on its face that it was ""issued pursuant to the Florida Antitrust Act of 1980, Section 542.28, Florida 
Statutes."" No other authority was identified for their issuance. Second, the stated reason for issuing the CIDs, as noted on the 
face of the CIDs, was ""to determine whether there is, has been or may be a violation of . . . the [state or federal antitrust laws] . . 
. by conduct, activities, or proposed action of the following nature: possible contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint 
of trade, or monopolization, attempted monopolization, or combinations or conspiracies to monopolize trade or commerce, 
relating to the proposed contraction and/or relocation of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and/or the Florida Marlins."" Third, the 
Attorney General acknowledged before this court that the CIDs' only purpose was to investigate a possible antitrust violation 
arising out of the contraction agreement. When asked at oral argument whether the CIDs would have issued but for the 
threatened contraction, the Attorney General answered in the negative."
1248,6," For example, the plaintiffs were asked to identify all meetings, agreements, and communications relating to contraction of the 
two Florida teams; describe the process by which Major League Baseball attempts to obtain new stadia; detail the balance sheet 
for the two Florida clubs; discuss alternatives to contraction; and identify how and why club owners voted on the question of 
contraction."
1248,7," The Attorney General requested the production of organizational charts; studies, research, reports, and recommendations 
relating to contraction; bylaws, constitutions, and rules that govern Major League Baseball; notes and documents concerning the 
contraction meeting; profit and loss statements; revenue sharing agreements; and ownership applications and documents 
assessing the anticipated viability of the Florida clubs."
1248,8," See note 5, supra."
1248,9," In the Flood, 407 U.S. at 260 n.1, 92 S. Ct. at 2100 n.1, Supreme Court described the reserve system as follows: "
1249,," The reserve system, publicly introduced into baseball contracts in 1887 . . . centers in the uniformity of player contracts; the 
confinement of the player to the club that has him under the contract; the assignability of the player's contract; and the 
ability of the club annually to renew the contract unilaterally, subject to a stated salary minimum."
1249,10," The Florida Supreme Court's holding has scant support in the case law; the vast majority of lower courts have held that the 
exemption created by the U.S. Supreme Court extends more broadly to the ""business of baseball."" Some of these cases were 
cited by the district court. See Major League Baseball v. Butterworth, 181 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1322 n.4 (N.D. Fla. 2001). Lest 
there be any doubt about the matter, the district court forcefully destroyed the notion that the antitrust exemption should be 
narrowly cabined to the reserve system. 181 F. Supp. 2d at 1322-1332. Given the persuasiveness of the district court's 
reasoning, in conjunction with the fact that the Attorney General no longer argues that the antitrust exemption should be so 
narrowly construed, we see no need to expound upon the matter."

1249,12," The plaintiffs claim that state regulation of baseball via antitrust litigation would inevitably entail extensive extraterritorial effects 
and impose a heavy burden on interstate commerce. Therefore, the plaintiffs contend that courts have erected a rare per se rule 
under the Commerce Clause that, rather than balancing the burden on interstate commerce with legitimate state interests, 
automatically precludes the application of state antitrust laws to the business of baseball."

Attorney General characterizes the investigation, the CIDs were focused on contraction - a matter that is well within the 
business-of-baseball exemption. "
1252,19," At least one other court has similarly concluded that federal antitrust policy, as established in the Flood decision, precludes the 
application of state antitrust law to the business of baseball. See In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., 123 F.3d 
599, 611 (7th Cir. 1997) (""Antitrust law, for example, with an isolation exception, Flood v. Kuhn . . . is a field in which Congress 
has not sought to replace state with federal law."") (first emphasis added) (citations omitted)."
1252,20," Notably, HN12[
] a Florida statute provides that Florida antitrust law does not apply to conduct exempted from federal antitrust law. See Fla. Stat. § 542.20. It is perhaps misleading to say that Florida law is ""preempted"" by federal law when both 
laws should be read coterminously. However, federal courts may not enjoin state actors to comply with state law, see Pennhurst "
1253,," State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106, 104 S. Ct. 900, 911, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1984), and so the district court wisely 
declined to base its decision on Fla. Stat. § 542.20."
1253,21," The cases of Eastern R.R. Presidents Conf. v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), 
and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965), establish an exemption from 
antitrust liability for certain petitioning activities."
1253,22," See note 3, supra. "
1254,23," The Attorney General's brief reveals his broad (and incorrect) view of the investigatory discretion vested in his Office: 
""Enjoining the Attorney General's civil investigation at the outset is foreclosed by the possibility that investigation of the events 
surrounding the proposed contraction would have revealed antitrust activity involving non-baseball entities that could not 
properly hide behind baseball's Federal Baseball immunity. Such persons would not be permitted to evade the antitrust laws, 
and yet without any investigation, their existence will never be known."" See Br. of Atty. Gen. at 19. In other words, the Attorney 
General has no idea what illegal conduct might have occurred, or who might have engaged in this conduct. Even so, the 
Attorney General believes he has the power to commence a full-blown investigation. Although the Attorney General need not 
have absolute proof of a violation prior to commencing an investigation (otherwise, what would be the point of conducting an 
investigation in the first place? ), Florida law and the Constitution clearly require that the Attorney General have something."
1254,24," Federal Baseball, which was typical of the Supreme Court's cramped Commerce Clause jurisprudence during the pre-New 
Deal era, held that ""the business [of] giving exhibitions of baseball"" is a ""purely state affair."" , 259 U.S. at 208, 42 S. Ct. at 466. 
The result of this conclusion was that the Sherman Act did not apply to Major League Baseball."
1254,25," In Toolson, the Court retreated from its cramped view of interstate commerce and instead rested its decision on what it 
perceived as congressional intent. See Toolson, 346 U.S. at 357, 92 S. Ct. at 78-79. This was another shaky holding, because "
1255,," the Court usually declines to infer an intention of Congress merely because of congressional inaction. In Helvering v. Hallock, 
309 U.S. 106, 119-21, 60 S. Ct. 444, 451-52, 84 L. Ed. 604 (1940), for example, the Court said: Nor does want of specific Congressional repudiations . . . serve as an implied instruction by Congress to us not to 
reconsider, in the light of new experience, . . . those decisions . . . . It would require very persuasive circumstances 
enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from re-examining its own doctrines . . . . Various considerations of 
parliamentary tactics and strategy might be suggested as reasons for the inaction of . . . Congress, but they would only be 
sufficient to indicate that we walk on quicksand when we try to find in the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal 
principle. One might also question the propriety of basing a rule of law on a perceived intention alone, without any textual hook 
whatsoever. To be sure, the antitrust laws, which have been read as a delegation to the courts to craft the law of competition in 
the common law tradition, might present a unique case where the Court's judge-made exemption is more palatable; however, 
one must wonder why the Court was so intent on casting the baseball exemption as a rule ordained by Congress in the first 
place. Responding to criticisms that the Court's jurisprudence has been schizophrenic in granting an exemption to baseball but not to 
other professional sports, the Court's analysis in Flood boiled down to this puzzling language: ""If we were to act otherwise, we 
would be withdrawing from the conclusion as to congressional intent made in Toolson and from the concerns as to 
retrospectivity therein expressed. Under these circumstances, there is merit in consistency even though some might claim that 
beneath that consistency is a layer of inconsistency."" Flood, 407 U.S. at 284, 92 S. Ct. at 2113. So the reasoning behind the 
present rule seems to be a rigid notion of stare decisis, coupled with a hesitancy to render a decision that would operate 
prospectively only. "

1352,1," Describing the defendants' product line as ""insurance"" is somewhat of a misnomer. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 
1011-1015, exempts ""the business of insurance"" from federal antitrust laws. Id. § 1012(b). The Supreme Court has recognized, 
however, that benefit plans, although typically marketed as health insurance, more closely resemble pre-payment plans in which 
the primary objective is not to shift the risk of loss, but, rather, to provide health-care services to subscribers. See  Group Life &

1368,1, I DEFER approval of the various CD distribution plans pending receipt of additional information. 
1369,2," Generally, distributors suggest retail prices (MSRP) that retailers may choose to follow or not. Often, retail sales occur at a 
discount from the MSRP. Distributors also offer retailers various advertising funds and benefits. Allegedly, under the MAP 
program, the distributors set limits on the discounts from MSRP that retailers could advertise anywhere, including their own 
stores, and failure to comply with the discount advertising limitations resulted in loss of the advertising funds and benefits. 
Retailers were permitted, however, to put a lower sticker price on the CD and charge a lower price."

1375,15," I do not use the FTC's estimate of $ 480 million in overcharges, announced (with no analysis provided) during a May 2000 
press conference lauding the FTC's accomplishment in obtaining a cease and desist order. See Press Release, Federal Trade 
Commission, Record Companies Settle FTC Charges of Restraining Competition in CD Music Market (May 10, 2000) (attached 
as Ex. A to Feldman Objection (Docket No. 216)). None of the objectors who seek to have me measure the settlement against 
the FTC's estimate has shown me that the FTC did a careful market pricing analysis to generate the number--or that it 
considered what could actually be proven at trial."
1375,16," Barnes & Noble, Best Buy, Circuit City, Musicland and Tower Records (only two of the three retailer defendants)."
1375,17," Oversimplified, what the economist did was calculate average discounts before, during and after the MAP enforcement period. 
He found a significant decrease in the average discount during the enforcement period and attributed that to the alleged 
conspiracy. He used that average number and, through weighting, came up with an average of $ .23 overcharge per CD. He 
then used that figure, by projection, for other distributors."
1375,18," HN14[
] The Clayton Act does allow some flexibility in proving damages against a defendant who has agreed to fix prices (""by statistical or sampling methods, by the computation of alleged overcharges, or by such other reasonable system of 
estimating aggregate damages as the court in its discretion may permit.""). 15 U.S.C. § 15d."
1375,19," The assumption of uniformity seems particularly subject to challenge for the discounters' behavior. Moreover, proof of their 
agreement (presumably coerced) may be more difficult. "
1376,20," In Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707, 97 S. Ct. 2061 (1977), HN15[
] the United States Supreme 
Court held that generally only direct purchasers from the antitrust violator could recover damages."
1376,21," The economist has not included sales from small retailers because there is no data and the factors that drive their pricing are 
quite different. I find that to be a reasonable exclusion. Moreover, to include those sales would require use of the ""umbrella"" 
theory of price fixing damage, a subject of controversy unto itself. Compare, e.g., Mid-West Paper Co. v. Cont'l Group, Inc., 596 
F.2d 573, 583-87 (3d Cir. 1979) (rejecting umbrella theory as a basis for establishing injury by purchasers from competitors of 
the defendant price-fixers); with In re Beef Indus. Antitrust Litig., 600 F.2d 1148, 1166 n.24 (5th Cir. 1979) (concluding one who 
deals with non-conspiring competitor of price-fixers has standing to sue price-fixers); see also Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Mylan 
Labs, Inc., 62 F. Supp. 2d 25, 38-40 (D.D.C. 1999) (citing cases)."
1376,22," Arguably there is some incremental value inasmuch as these plaintiffs can now seek to enforce the injunctive relief if the FTC 
fails to do so. "
1377,23," For example, the State of Iowa's distribution plan for the estimated 57,436 CDs that it will receive calls for the allocation of the 
CDs to Iowa public and academic libraries, Iowa college and university nonprofit radio stations, nine residential institutions or 
facilities operated by the Iowa Department of Human Services, and the Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School. See MAP Final 
Approval Mem., Ex. F18, at 1. The distribution plan of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands provides that its entire 
allocation of CDs will be distributed to the Commonwealth's three public libraries located on each of the three main islands. See 
MAP Final Approval Mem., Ex. F38, at 1."
1377,24," Because of cost factors, defendants are obviously willing to turn over greater value (as reflected by value to the recipient) in 
product than in cash. It is administratively impractical, however, to distribute CDs to individual class members. Allocating them 
according to the individual's choice of title, with shipping and handling expenses, to 3.5 million addresses would be excessive. 
The combination of significant cash payments to individual class members, coupled with the cy pres distribution of CDs, is a 
reasonable and creative resolution."
1377,25," Some states have passed legislation that specifically addresses how monetary recoveries in antitrust actions will be treated. 
See, e.g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 41-191.01-.02 (2003) (establishing revolving fund for the deposit of monies received by the 
state as a result of the enforcement of federal or state antitrust statutes and mandating that a portion of any antitrust recovery be 
set aside for antitrust enforcement activities). "
1378,26," The economist's estimate is based on data from 2000, after enforcement of the MAP policies ceased. There has been no 
indication, however, that the average discount in the marketplace has changed."
1378,27," This number results from a mathematical calculation: if $ 75.7 million is 20% less, then $ 66.2375 million is 30% less."
1378,28," The parties' agreement, valuing them at MSRP less 20%, results in an average price of $ 13.76 per CD."
1378,29," At wholesale prices, the total value of the settlement would be $ 133.6125 million ($ 67.375 million in cash plus $ 66.2375 
million in product), about 54.5% of the potential recovery, and still significantly greater than the recovery for which data exists 
without significant extrapolation."
1378,30," At the hearing, I pressed the plaintiffs' lawyers on whether I should treble the calculation of recoverable damages for purposes 
of assessing the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of settlement. Reluctantly, they agreed that I should. Further research 
after the hearing, however, reveals that HN17[
] courts generally do not consider either recovery of treble damages or recovery 
of attorney fees in assessing the settlement. See City of Detroit v. Grinnell Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 458-59 (2d Cir. 1974); In re 
Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 212 F.R.D. 231, 257-58 (D. Del. 2002); In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 205 
F.R.D. 369, 377 n.12 (D.D.C. 2002); In re Ampicillin Antitrust Litig., 82 F.R.D. 652, 654 (D.D.C. 1979). The basis for this 
treatment seems to be a Second Circuit decision, Grinnell, where the court gave two reasons: (1) tradition; and (2) disruption of 
the settlement process because trebling would require defendants to ""admit their guilt."" 495 F.2d at 459. I am not persuaded by 
either reason: tradition is hardly compelling, given the other interests at stake here; and the whole premise of a settlement 
(except settlements only to avoid legal expense) is defendant recognition that liability is a possibility. Trebling is automatic if 
antitrust damages are assessed at all, unlike other forms of punitive damages that require additional proof or that may be left to 
court discretion. Respected commentators who disagree with automatic trebling nevertheless recognize that the statute seems 
to require it. 2 Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law P303d, at 41, P330b, at 274 (2d ed. 2000). Therefore, if a settlement 
reflects a potential damage recovery, it should logically reflect the other parts of that recovery (trebling and attorney fees) that 
the statute awards automatically. Certainly it is at least at the back of lawyers' minds as they negotiate. Nevertheless, my 
analysis in text follows the precedents. On the other hand, if trebling is counted, the potential recovery after trial and appeal 
would be $ 736 million and fees. The total value of the settlement as calculated in text then would represent about 19.4% of the 
potential trebled recovery and after subtraction of attorney fees and disbursements would represent about 17.5%, without 
considering value to the injunction against retailers. Obviously those are less attractive percentage numbers than presented in 
text under the traditional analysis. But even so, given my role as supervising judge not to decide the merits of the case but only 
to determine if the parties' conclusion to settle on these terms was reasonable, and given the presumption of fairness following 
arm's-length negotiations and given all the difficulties the litigation presents, I do not find the settlement unreasonable. "

parens patriae lawsuits if the MDL Panel transferred them here for trial. See 28 U.S.C. § 1407(h). Arguably also, the two 
consolidated amended complaints filed in this District voluntarily by the States and the private plaintiffs respectively amount to a 
consent to transfer. After all, it would be hard to know where to ""send back"" the consolidated complaints. "

should first be settled ignoring fees, leaving them to the judge to assess later and additionally against defendants; whether the 
two numbers should be negotiated separately; or whether the defendants can settle on a global amount, then leave it to the 
plaintiffs, their lawyers and the court to work out the division. The caselaw and the relevant rules certainly permit the manner in 
which the plaintiffs' counsel have proceeded here, negotiating a lump sum amount. See Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 733, 89 
L. Ed. 2d 747, 106 S. Ct. 1531 (1986); White v. New Hampshire Dep't of Employment Sec., 455 U.S. 445, 453 n.15, 71 L. Ed. 2d 
325, 102 S. Ct. 1162 (1982)."
1382,41, See supra note 25.
1382,42," At the hearing, private counsel from California and Minnesota announced that they were no longer pressing their objection to 
their respective treatments. "
1383,43," Under the Clayton Act, this is a statutory fee-shifting case, but only upon judgment. 15 U.S.C. § 15c(a)(2). When the case 
settles short of judgment, as this one has, the plaintiffs' attorney fees come out of the recovery and then fit the common fund 
model."
1383,44," I still do not fully understand how the lawyers came up with their precise fee request ($ 12,575,000), since it matches neither 
the percentage of funds number nor the ostensible lodestar number. Some of the caselaw seems to permit the approach they 
took. See, e.g., In re Toys ""R"" Us Antitrust Litig., 191 F.R.D. 347, 356-57 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (""Whether evaluated under the 
conventional lodestar method, or as a percentage of recovery, the amounts requested [$ 3,258,000 in fees, representing 5.7% of 
the total settlements and 16% of the cash portion of the settlements, plus $ 458,784.60 in expenses and $ 2,176,000 in 
compensation to the States, representing 3.8% of the total value of the settlements and 11.05% of the aggregate cash value of 
the settlements, plus $ 86,912.35 in costs] are reasonable."") (citations omitted). Perhaps it results from the appellate 
pronouncements that either percentage of funds or lodestar can support fees in cases of this kind, In re Thirteen Appeals Arising 
out of the San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 56 F.3d 295, 307 (1st Cir. 1995), and resulting lawyer uncertainty as to what 
approach a court will use. For that confusion, we judges are responsible. But it seems to me that lawyers are obliged first to 
explain to the court how they came up with the numbers in their fee request, i.e., choose one method and follow it through, then 
if necessary show that the alternate method would support it. Choosing a number they are happy with, then justifying it on both 
approaches, is neither a logical method of determining fees nor a device that facilitates judicial review."
1383,45," See discussion of ranges in In re Copley Pharm., Inc., 1 F. Supp. 2d 1407, 1412-13 (D. Wyo. 1998) (contingency fee standard 
of 33%; generally 20-30% in common fund cases; 25% benchmark in Ninth Circuit; 13-20% range where recovery is $ 51-75 
million; 6-10% range and lower where recovery is $ 75-200 million);In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practices Litig., 148 
F.3d 283, 339 (3d Cir. 1998) (4.1%-17.92% where recovery exceeds $ 100 million); Conley v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 222 B.R. 
181, 188 (D. Mass. 1998) (quoting the affidavit of expert Charles Silver, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law: 
""Although the available empirical evidence does not enable me to make authoritative generalizations about fee award practices 
in class actions where public law enforcement officials and private attorneys are working cooperatively, the anecdotal evidence 
known to me suggests that fees ranging from 10-15 percent of the recovery are usual in these cases.""); see also NACA, "
1384,," Standards and Guidelines, supra note 12, at 397-98. This court is not within the Seventh Circuit, where I would have to 
determine what is the market rate for these legal services. See In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig., 325 F.3d 974, 978-79 (7th Cir. 2003); 
In re Synthroid Mktg. Litig., 264 F.3d 712, 718-22 (7th Cir. 2001)."
1384,46," In a single sentence, the lawyers seem to seek a pro rata share of any interest the settlement funds are earning in the bank 
accounts where they sit. Courts have debated the appropriateness of allowing interest on fees when payment is delayed. It is 
often said that under the lodestar approach lawyers are permitted to calculate their fees based on current billing rates, thereby 
foregoing interest, instead of using historical rates and charging interest. For a percentage of funds approach, on the other hand, 
the rationale for interest disappears. All such variables should be subsumed in the determination of what is an appropriate 
percentage. Of course, if there were to be substantial delay in payment after a court's approval of fees, interest might be 
appropriate. I do not see any reason for such an award here, and decline to award interest."
1384,47," Even the factors approved in the Third Circuit Task Force Report, taken directly from Gunter v. Ridgewood Energy Corp., 223 
F.3d 190, 195 n.1 (3d Cir. 2000), do not assist in this calculation: In common fund cases of this sort--in which the attorneys' fees and the clients' award come from the same source and the 
fees are based on a percentage amount of the clients' settlement award--district courts should consider several factors in 
setting a fee award. Among other things, these factors include: (1) the size of the fund created and the number of persons 
benefited; (2) the presence or absence of substantial objections by members of the class to the settlement terms and/or 
fees requested by counsel; (3) the skill and efficiency of the attorneys involved; (4) the complexity and duration of the 
litigation; (5) the risk of nonpayment; (6) the amount of time devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel; and (7) the awards in 
similar cases. See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practices Litig., 148 F.3d 283, 336-40 (3d Cir. 1998); In re General "
1385,," Motors Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability Litigation, 55 F.3d 768, 819-22 (3d Cir. 1995); Moore's Federal 
Practice, Manual for Complex Litigation (Third) § 24.121, at 207 (1997)."
1385,48," See Third Circuit Task Force, Court Awarded Attorney Fees, 108 F.R.D. 237, 245 (1985): The fundamental problem with an approach that does no more than assure that the lower courts will consider a plethora of 
conflicting and at least partially redundant factors is that it provides no analytical framework for their application. It offers no 
guidance on the relative importance of each factor, whether they are to be applied differently in different contexts, or, 
indeed, how they are to be applied at all."
1385,49," Many of the reasons for preferring the percentage of funds approach over the lodestar analysis apply to the disbursement 
review as well. It seems a step backward to revert to judicial second guessing of expenses."
1385,50," If the total award stays at $ 14,307,500, and if the claimed disbursements of $ 1,873,651.44 are reasonable, then the net 
attorney fees are $ 12,433,848.56, 18.5% of the cash recovery, or 8.7% of the total recovery."
1385,51," Some have become moot, such as those objections to the ceiling or floor for payments (neither turned out to be applicable) 
and those challenging notice due to a low response rate (30,000, according to one objection) before all the 3.5 million claims 
were filed."
1385,52," Class action litigation stirs the interest and concern of many. Primarily, they are concerned that class actions serve to line 
lawyers' pockets without significantly benefiting allegedly damaged class members, or that the class action device promotes the 
filing of spurious lawsuits forcing defendants to pay only in order to avoid the high expenses of class action litigation. What is 
less frequently observed is that the process provokes into action an interesting group of professional objectors, who seem to 
have a variety of agendas, some not always apparent. I read all the objections, and heard orally all those who wished to be 
heard, both at the outset of the hearing, and again in rebuttal at the end. Their contributions varied from useful and important 
(whether I accepted them totally or not) to the other end of the spectrum. The culmination, however, was a post-hearing ""Notice 
of Objection,"" in which two objectors, represented by lawyers from Massachusetts and Missouri, ""hereby object to any other 
class member's adoption of oral or written arguments made by [the two objectors] that were not specifically addressed in that 
class member's filed, written objections."" Feldman and Marsh Notice of Objection, at 1 (Docket No. 268). That is a first, in my 
experience. Generally, adoption and endorsement of someone else's arguments are high forms of flattery; I am not aware of any 
legal principle that gives a monopoly over arguments to the one who first made them; and I specifically instructed objectors at 
the hearing not to repeat points that others had made, but merely to state that they agreed with or adopted them! "
1387,53," Actually, it generates $ 1.5 million, but $ 475,000 is retained by the defendants to pay for their portion of the notice expenses."
1387,54," A 50% discount on one to three new purchases, depending on the number of CDs the music club member purchased during 
the class period."
1387,55," A day after the hearing, the Trowbridge plaintiffs filed a letter requesting permission to engage an economist and prepare and 
file at a later date an analysis of value. I declined the request. I think it better for everyone to have a clear understanding of the 
scope of my concerns before determining whether investment of further resources is appropriate or advisable. I thought my 
skepticism and concerns had been sufficiently apparent at the preliminary fairness hearing. See Hr'g Tr. at 55, 59, 63, 70 (""I will 
look forward in the final fairness hearing to having . . . details to persuade me that indeed, there is value to what has been 
provided here."") (Docket No. 200). Obviously, however, I was not successful then in communicating the seriousness of my 
concerns. The parties can determine whether, in light of this opinion, they believe any salvage is possible."
1387,56," The differences that the parties highlight are the following: the percentage amount of the discount (the objectors disagree that 
this is significant, stating that the clubs regularly offer coupons up to 70 or 80% off, or fixed dollar coupons that amount to 
greater than 50%); the settlement discount is good for 6 months, whereas other coupons are good for only days or weeks (an 
objector who appeared in person disagreed, stating that he has a drawer full of coupons that do not expire and submitted one as 
evidence); the settlement discount requires no other purchases, whereas many of the discounts require purchase of one CD at 
full price, as a result of which, one or several other CDs become available at varying discounts (on the other hand, there was 
some evidence that every time a member buys a CD at whatever price, he/she receives a coupon for a CD at a steeply 
discounted value); the settlement discount makes the half-price CD available with no shipping and handling charges, whereas 
most other offers require the member to pay $ 2.79 for shipping and handling; the settlement discount will be exercisable against 
almost the entire catalog unlike other restricted coupons (objectors disagreed, stating that club discounts often apply across the 
entire catalog); and the settlement discount is available to past club members who are members of the class, and as inactive 
club members they would not receive discount offers. (I cannot assess this factor. To be sure, this may be a discount they would 
not otherwise receive, but their lapsed membership may also indicate lack of interest in the club programs generally and thus the 
settlement discount may be only an opportunity for the defendants to try to recover lost members.)"
1387,57," In this respect it is unlike the coupon settlement in In re Mexico Money Transfer Litig., 267 F.3d 743 (7th Cir. 2001), where 
there was no evidence that other discounts were available, and class members could sell or give away their discounts to others. "
1388,58," I do recognize that this discount does not carry the disadvantages of some coupon programs that have been criticized in the 
cases and commentary, in that the discount covers a substantial part (50%) of the purchase price of a modestly priced item and 
arguably does not require a change in consumer behavior. See, e.g., In re Gen. Motors Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Prods. Liab. 
Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 808-10 (3d Cir. 1995) (rejecting $ 1,000 settlement coupons for the purchase of a new truck); Clement v. Am. 
Honda Fin. Corp., 176 F.R.D. 15 (D. Conn. 1997) (rejecting $ 75 or $ 150 coupon requiring class members to purchase or lease 
another vehicle through AHFC within two years). On the other hand, the discount is not transferable, such that members with no 
use for it could sell it to members who could economically use it, see, e.g., In re Mexico Money Transfer Litig., 267 F.3d at 748, 
and there is no requirement that a certain number of the discounts be used for the defendants to satisfy their obligation. See, 
e.g., In re Motorsports Merch. Antitrust Litig., 112 F. Supp. 2d 1329, 1335-36 (N.D. Ga. 2000); see generally Note, In-Kind Class 
Action Settlements, 109 Harv. L. Rev. 810 (1996), for an analysis of the cases and factors."
1388,59," Defense counsel spoke about ""cannibalizing,"" and paragraph 12 of the Declaration of Sharon Siegel ""estimates that perhaps 
25-35% of sales that would be made in the ordinary course of business could be replaced by sales made pursuant to the 
Settlement Consideration."" (Docket No. 252, Ex. 4). Notably there is no indication that any sales under the settlement program 
would substitute for more profitable sales. Affidavits of music club personnel refer to likely redemption rates of 8% or 15%, but 
they are speaking of music club coupon redemption experience in general, and the rates bear no relation to whether this 
program will ""cost"" the defendants anything or ""benefit"" the members at all. The lawyers would like me to value the settlement by 
taking the dollar amount of the 50% discount ($ 8.99 on a $ 17.98 CD) and multiplying it by a predicted number of redemptions, 
thereby ostensibly generating over $ 10 million in value to the class. I decline to accept that analysis for the reasons stated in 
text."
1388,60," I am not rejecting discounts automatically or outright. I recognize that the costs of processing and mailing a check to a class 
that may exceed 8 million members will outweigh the value of a small check and may require alternative relief; but this discount 
program has no demonstrated value to the class members."
1388,61," The damage theory of the MAP case is that retailers failed to discount the suggested retail price as much as they would have 
without MAP. Music clubs have always maintained a variety of discount programs. It would be very difficult to prove that these 
music club discount programs were collusively affected by the MAP programs used in retail stores or, if so, in what amount. "
1389,62," My skepticism was surely evident at the preliminary hearing on fairness, see supra note 55. Because I was then uncertain of 
how music clubs worked and what the benefits might be, I permitted the proposed settlement to go forward for reactions. 
Although class counsel argues that the reaction was generally positive, I was impressed with the criticisms. In addition to the 
persuasiveness of some of the objectors, there was a notable number of opt-outs (470), a number of which expressed 
dissatisfaction with either the lawsuit or the settlement. See Jaffe Aff. (Requests for Exclusion) P3 (Docket No. 263)."
1389,63," Plus $ 10,000 to the two named plaintiffs."
1389,64," Perhaps aware of my discontent, the lawyer for one of the music clubs proposed at the very end of the fairness hearing that 
the defendants would waive the reversion and agree that any amounts of the cash pool not awarded to class counsel should go 
to a music charity. "

1399,7," As described by the district court, the plaintiffs fall into three groups: (1) the ""State Law Plaintiffs,"" indirect purchasers, and

1401,10," It is undisputed that the state antitrust statutes at issue either follow federal Sherman Act precedent or find federal case law

1401,11," The risk that the application of a per se rule will lead to the condemnation of an agreement that a rule of reason analysis would 
permit has been recognized and tolerated as a necessary cost of this approach. See, e.g.,  Maricopa Cty., 457 U.S. at 344 (""As 
in every rule of general application, the match between the presumed and the actual is imperfect. For the sake of business 
certainty and litigation efficiency, we have tolerated the invalidation of some agreements that a fullblown inquiry might have 
proved to be reasonable."");  United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 609, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515, 92 S. Ct. 1126 (1972) "

1402,12," As the district court for the Eastern District of New York recently observed, in distinguishing the district court's opinion in the 
present case (Cardizem II), By agreeing both not to end the underlying patent dispute and not to market a generic drug product in the relevant domestic 
market, Andrx . . . effectively precluded or seriously delayed both the [patent] court decision and the commercial marketing 
trigger of the 180-day exclusivity period. As a result, any future [generic] filers were delayed in coming to market . . . . In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litigation, 261 F. Supp. 2d 188, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8476, MDL No. 1383, 2003

1403,13," As the court in In re Ciprofloxacin observed, when the Cardizem [district] court condemned the HMR/Andrx Agreement, it emphasized that the agreement [there] 
restrained Andrx from marketing other bioequivalent or generic versions of Cardizem that were not at issue in the pending 
litigation, . . . . Thus, the court found that the agreement's restrictions extended to noninfringing and/or potentially 
noninfringing versions of generic Cardizem."
1403,2003," U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8476, 2003 WL 21146562, at *46."
1403,14," For example, the defendants charge that the district court erred in concluding that in the absence of the Agreement, Andrx 
would have marketed its generic product before the end of the patent litigation (once it had received FDA approval). However, 
the district court never held that Andrx would have launched the original formulation of its generic while the patent suit was 
pending, only that it could have. The defendants also contend that the district court erred in assuming that Andrx could have 
marketed its reformulated generic, which only received FDA approval in June 1999, before it did, but the district court made no 
such assumption. Finally, the defendants argue that the district court erred in reaching the conclusion that Andrx and HMRI were 
horizontal competitors. They maintain that it would be inconsistent with Hatch-Waxman scheme to allow a court to treat a 
generic manufacturer who is seeking FDA approval and has been charged with patent infringement and the patent holder as 
horizontal competitors. Hatch-Waxman notwithstanding, the defendants are potential rivals in the market for Cardizem CD; an 
agreement between them is thus an agreement between horizontal competitors. "
1404,15," Our conclusion that the Agreement was a per se illegal restraint of trade does not obviate the need to decide whether the 
plaintiffs adequately alleged antitrust injury. See  Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 341-42, 109 L. Ed. 
2d 333, 110 S. Ct. 1884 (1990) HN12[
] (""The per se rule is a method of determining whether § 1 of the Sherman Act has been violated, but it does not indicate whether a private plaintiff has suffered antitrust injury and thus whether he may recover 
damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act."")."
1404,16," The State Law Plaintiffs allege that the  '584 patent ""represented no substantive change or improvement to Cardizem CD but 
rather was prosecuted and listed solely to give HMR a basis for initiating sham patent infringement litigation to delay and exclude 
Andrx's generic Cardizem CD from the Cardizem CD market for at least 30 months."" JA 948, P 101. They further allege that 
Andrx's specified dissolution profile, submitted to the FDA after the patent infringement litigation was filed, was ""clearly distinct"" 
from the  '584 patent, JA 949, P 103, and that HMR continued its pursuit of the patent infringement litigation ""despite the 
absence of any reasonable belief that their claim would be held to be valid upon adjudication,"" id. P 104. Finally, they allege that 
HMR's ""goal and intention in pursuing [the patent infringement litigation] was solely to indefinitely delay and prevent the entry of 
Andrx's product into the marketplace and invoke the automatic 30-month administrative delay in the FDA approval process."" Id.; 
see also JA 154, P 53 (amended complaint of Sherman Act Class Plaintiffs alleging that ""patent litigation"" was ""sham[]"")). "
1405,17," It is noteworthy that the district court has responsibility for these cases by assignment of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict 
Litigation, and we address this certified question in aid of the district court. This consolidated proceeding includes cases that "
1406,," were originally filed in various state and federal courts, raising state and federal antitrust claims. The state cases were first 
removed to federal district court and then transferred to the Eastern District of Michigan. In considering the issue of antitrust 
injury, the district court applied the same analysis, including the application of Sixth Circuit precedent, to all of the antitrust 
claims. Id. at 645-58. As no party has taken issue with this approach, either before the district court or on appeal, we have 
followed the same path. We note, however, that although it is clear and undisputed that the state antitrust laws at issue all ""either 
follow federal Sherman Act precedent or find federal case law persuasive,"" Dist. Ct. Op. II, at 692 & n.6 (citing state cases); see 
also State Law Pls. Br. at 41-15, and that in a federal multidistrict litigation there is a preference for applying the law of the 
transferee district, see  In re Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Implants Prod. Liab. Litig., 97 F.3d 1050 (8th Cir. 1996);  Menowitz 
v. Brown, 991 F.2d 36 (2d Cir. 1993), it is not clear that precedent ""unique"" to a particular circuit and arguably divergent from the 
predominant interpretation of a federal law, such as the Sixth Circuit's ""necessary predicate"" gloss on the antitrust injury 
doctrine, should be applied to state antitrust laws or federal antitrust claims that originated in other circuits,  see In re Korean Air 
Lines Disaster of Sept. 1, 1983, 265 U.S. App. D.C. 39, 829 F.2d 1171 (2d Cir. 1987), aff'd,  490 U.S. 122, 104 L. Ed. 2d 113, 
109 S. Ct. 1676 (1989) (law of transferor forum on federal question merits close consideration, but does not have stare decisis 
effect). As we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have alleged antitrust injury as contemplated by the Sixth Circuit, this 
consideration is of academic interest only. Were the outcome otherwise, it might require further consideration. "
1407,18," This court's decision in  Watkins & Son Pet Supplies v. Iams Co., 254 F.3d 607 (6th Cir. 2001), similarly found no antitrust 
injury where the plaintiff's alleged injury - its exclusion from the market - flowed from the termination of its distributorship, not 
from the defendants' allegedly illegal distribution restraints. "
1408,19," In addition, the defendants' position, if adopted, risks undermining a basic premise of antitrust law that, as the district court 
observed, in many instances, an otherwise legal action - e.g. setting a price - becomes illegal if it is pursuant to an agreement 
with a competitor. Under the defendants' view, such an action would never cause antitrust injury because a defendant could 
have unilaterally and legally set the same price. "

1997. We believe that Southeast misstated the date in its ""Statement of Facts."""
1411,5," DCH and Oncology Associates argue that hospitals in Mississippi and in Birmingham provide cancer patients with alternatives 
to the hospitals in Tuscaloosa. "
1412,6," DCH has the authority to enter into such an agreement pursuant to § 22-21-318(a)(12), Ala. Code 1975."
1412,7," Section 22-21-318(a)(31), Ala. Code 1975, gives a health-care authority the following power: HN2[
] ""To exercise all powers granted hereunder in such manner as it may determine to be consistent with the purposes of 
this article, notwithstanding that as a consequence of such exercise of such powers it engages in activities that may be deemed 
'anticompetitive' within the contemplation of the antitrust laws of the state or of the United States …."" "
1413,8," Southeast argues that DCH has a monopoly in western Alabama because DCH operates the only two hospitals in Tuscaloosa 
County and the Fayette Medical Center in Fayette."
1413,9," In its brief, Oncology Associates cites  Todorov v. DCH Healthcare Authority, 921 F.2d 1438, 1441 n. 1 (11th Cir. 1991), in 
support of the proposition that Southeast lacks standing to bring this action under § 8-1-1, Ala. Code 1975. In Todorov, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit found: ""Dr. Todorov has his office at The Neurology Clinic, P.C., a corporation of which he is the sole shareholder. He brought this 
[antitrust] suit in behalf of himself and the corporation. Though the district court did not reach the issue, we conclude that the 
corporation has no standing to sue in this matter. It is Dr. Todorov, not his corporation, who is seeking [and was denied] 
privileges at DCH and, thus, the relief prayed for in this case."" Analogously in this case, the physicians employed by Southeast seek staff privileges at DCH facilities so that they may practice 
their profession. Southeast, as a corporate person, may not receive staff privileges or practice medicine; therefore, under the 
reasoning of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in  Todorov, Southeast would lack standing to bring this action. This Court, however, has not directly addressed the question of nonparty standing under § 8-1-1(a), Ala. Code 1975. In his 
special concurrence in  Tomlinson v. Humana, Inc., 495 So. 2d 630, 632-33 (Ala. 1986)(Torbert, C.J., concurring specially), then 
Chief Justice Torbert considered whether a ""non-party to a 'restrictive contract' … can state a claim under [§ 8-1-1(a), Ala. Code 
1975]."" In Tomlinson, Shoals Medical Laboratory had an exclusive agreement to provide pathology services to hospitals owned 
by Humana. For three years Tomlinson was an employee of Shoals. Shoals terminated Tomlinson, and Tomlinson then sought 
to continue to practice pathology at the Humana hospitals. Humana declined Tomlinson staff privileges, citing its exclusive 
contract with Shoals. Tomlinson brought an action against Humana under § 8-1-1, Ala. Code 1975, arguing that Humana's 
contract with Shoals restricted his ability to practice his profession. The Court chose not to decide Tomlinson on the question of 
standing. In this case, Southeast stands one step further removed from the transaction between the hospital and its exclusive contractor 
than did Tomlinson. In  Tomlinson, Tomlinson himself sought employment as a pathologist. In this case, Southeast does not 
itself seek employment or staff privileges with DCH. Southeast is merely the corporation that employs the physicians who seek 
staff privileges at DCH facilities. "
1414,," While this case would appear to give the Court an opportunity to discuss standing under § 8-1-1(a), Ala. Code 1975, we do not 
believe that we need to make a definitive statement about who would have standing to bring a claim under § 8-1-1(a), Ala. Code 
1975, in order to decide this case. Moreover, even were this Court to decide that Southeast as a corporation lacked standing to 
bring a claim under § 8-1-1(a), Ala. Code 1975, any holding as to whether the individual physicians employed by Southeast 
would have standing to bring a claim under § 8-1-1, Ala. Code 1975, would be dicta. "
1425,1," SCME Mortgage Bankers, Inc., was erroneously sued as SCME Mortgage Brokers, Inc."
1425,2," A loan discount consists of ""points over and above par that would be charged to the borrower, typically to obtain the loan at the 
desired rate."" "
1428,3," Byars argues that a YSP may not be paid to a mortgage broker unless some of the borrower's closing costs are paid by the 
lending institution. No HUD regulation so provides. Indeed, as we explain in the text, the HUD regulations recognize that YSP's 
may be paid as lump sums based on interest rates and loan amounts and are not required to be tied to particular services. "
1429,4," Byars's reliance on an informal opinion of the Office of the Attorney General, stating that ""Mortgage lenders are compensated 
for their general costs of doing business only through the 1 loan origination fee permitted by [24 C.F.R. § ] 203.27(a)(2) [2003]"" 
(HUD Directive No. GHH-0074 (July 21, 1993), italics added) for the proposition that mortgage brokers may not recover any fees 
in excess of the 1 percent loan origination fee, is misplaced. First, this statement is dicta; the opinion was issued in response to 
a question as to how much could be charged for recording fees. More importantly, it reflects regulations affecting only what a 
lender may charge a borrower in upfront fees for a loan. Further, HN13[
] all lenders are also compensated for their costs of 
doing business through the interest rate charged to the borrower and are not prohibited from issuing loans at above par rates 
that generate greater profit for the lender. A lender who offers a loan directly to a borrower at an above par interest rate is 
entitled to keep the amount of the YSP that it would have paid to a mortgage broker had the borrower obtained the loan through 
such a broker. Byars's reliance on HUD Directive No. 4155.1 REV-4 CHG-1 (Sept. 1995) for the proposition that a lender may 
not pay mortgage broker fees is also misplaced. The cited language refers to situations where the borrower is required to pay 
cash upfront to the mortgage broker."
1429,5," We note that Byars did not include a copy of his complaint in the record on appeal; we were required to call up the superior 
court file in order to see the complaint. We choose to disregard Byars's error and deal with the merits of his claim."
1429,6," SCME's assertion that Byars admitted that his unfair business practice claim was merely derivative is not supported by the 
record. Neither the citation provided by SCME for Byars's asserted ""concession"" his Section 17200 claim was merely derivative 
nor our independent review of the record supports SCME's assertion. "
1430,7," We note that HN15[
] Code of Civil Procedure section 437c, subdivision (m)(2) prohibits an appellate court from affirming a grant of summary judgment on a ground not relied on by the trial court unless the appellate court permits supplemental briefing. 
We do not believe that supplemental briefing is required in this case since the issue was raised below and has already been 
briefed on appeal. "
1431,8," We note that Byars's citations to the record relate only to the December 1997 refinance and not to the February 1997 
transaction and that at one of his cited pages the record indicates that he could not recall the specifics of the conversations with 
his brokers about interest rates. We also note that Byars throughout his brief regularly failed to provide helpful citations to the 
record. For example, Byars regularly cited to only the first page of a multipage regulation in the clerk's transcript to support a 
specifically quoted sentence or two from the regulation."
1431,9," We note that Byars's deposition testimony indicates that the brokers told him they would obtain the ""going rate."" Byars did not 
present any evidence showing that the rates he obtained with their YSP's did not represent the going rate obtainable through a 
mortgage broker. We further note that we have determined that summary judgment was properly granted as to Byars's claims 
the YSP's here were improper. Thus, Byars's case is distinguishable from the cases which he cites in his brief where the brokers 
promised to obtain the best or lowest possible rate and, because of the procedural posture of the cases (decided on the 
pleadings) the YSP's were assumed to be illegal referrals or kickbacks. (See Schneider v. Citicorp Mortgage, Inc. (E.D.N.Y. 
1997) 982 F. Supp. 897; Hastings v. Fidelity Mortgage Decisions Corp. (N.D.Ill. 1997) 984 F. Supp. 600; Kerby v. Mortgage 
Funding Corp. (D.Md. 1998) 992 F. Supp. 787 [note there were also allegations that the YSP's were intentionally concealed from 
the borrower by using a shell lender to fund the loan].) "
1435,1," The background of this case is discussed in several previous decisions, Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Medicine, 
235 F. Supp. 2d 194 (W.D.N.Y. 2002); Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Medicine, 237 F. Supp. 2d 336 (W.D.N.Y.

19, 1997) and Daniel v. American Bd. of Emergency Medicine, 802 F. Supp. 912 (W.D.N.Y. 1992). The Court shall assume 
familiarity with these decisions."
1435,2," Because the Court is granting defendants' motion to dismiss, it need not address plaintiffs' motion for class certification. "
1448,1," The prosecution history documents filed with Eco's brief in support of its pending motion for summary judgment are all 
contained in Exhibit 601 from the hearing on Honeywell's motion for preliminary injunction. Citations to the summary judgment 
exhibits are more specific easier to use. "
1450,2," The Newman patent also noted the role of appearance in the cover of the thermostat: ""Another object of the invention is to 
provide a casing structure of this character and having these advantages and which is simple and durable in construction and 
highly attractive in appearance …."" Ex. 651 at 4, col. 1, ll. 49-53."
1450,3," Compare attached Exhibit A, with figures 1 and 2 from the '920 utility patent, to Exhibit B, the '657 design patent. Also attached 
as Exhibit C is the drawing from the '108 trademark registration, and Exhibit D is a design patent issued to Eco showing its 
design of the Eco Stat. "
1452,4," Like many parties seeking a preliminary injunction in the Seventh Circuit, Honeywell argues that it must show only a ""better 
than negligible"" chance of success on the merits. That phrase stems originally from Judge Posner's opinions in Roland 
Machinery Co. v. Dresser Industries, Inc., 749 F.2d 380, 387 (7th Cir. 1984), and Omega Satellite Products Co. v. City of 
Indianapolis, 694 F.2d 119, 123 (7th Cir. 1982), which adopted the ""sliding scale"" approach to temporary injunctive relief. 
Although the ""better than negligible"" phrase appears often in Seventh Circuit opinions, few if any decisions have actually granted 
or affirmed preliminary injunctions based on a chance of success on the merits that a court found to be only ""better than 
negligible."" Where the balance of harms does not heavily favor the moving party, as here, the moving party must show at least a 
""reasonable likelihood"" of success on the merits. E.g., International Kennel Club of Chicago, Inc. v. Mighty Star, Inc., 846 F.2d 
1079, 1084 (7th Cir. 1988). "
1453,5," In Valu Engineering, Inc. v. Rexnord Corp., 278 F.3d 1268, 1274-76 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the Federal Circuit stated that TrafFix 
Devices did not alter the Federal Circuit's four-factor Morton-Norwich analysis for determining functionality. The Federal Circuit 
stated that it had not actually required proof of ""competitive necessity"" under the third Morton-Norwich factor, see id. at 1276, 
though the TTAB did apply a ""competitive necessity"" standard when it issued the '108 trademark, see In re Honeywell Inc., 1988 
TTAB LEXIS 38, 8 U.S.P.Q.2d 1600, 1603-04 (TTAB 1988). "
1458,6," See also Disc Golf Ass'n, Inc. v. Champion Discs, Inc., 158 F.3d 1002, 1007 (9th Cir. 1998) (rejecting argument similar to 
Honeywell's, where holder of expired patent claimed trade dress protection and argued that the feature was not functional 
because it provided a utilitarian disadvantage). Honeywell's attempt to explain the price differences in terms of brand 
preferences also is not persuasive. The comparison in the evidence was between two Honeywell products that differ only in 
terms of shape. "
1459,7," The new competitor in TrafFix Devices had used a confusingly similar name for its product, as to which an intent to copy the 
product would be relevant under the Lanham Act regarding likelihood of confusion. That issue was not before the Supreme 
Court, which limited its consideration to the claim of trade dress infringement based on the product configuration or design. In 
this case, Eco has not adopted a confusing name, symbol, or packaging for its Eco Stat product. Honeywell's claims are based 
only on the appearance of the product, focusing on the circular and nearly convex shape. "
1460,8," Just before Honeywell obtained the '920 patent, the Supreme Court taught: HN16[
] By the force of the patent laws not only is the invention of a patent dedicated to the public upon its expiration, but 
the public thereby becomes entitled to share in the good will which the patentee has built up in the patented article or 
product through the enjoyment of his patent monopoly. Hence we have held that the patentee may not exclude the public 
from participating in that good will or secure, to any extent, a continuation of his monopoly by resorting to the trademark law 
and registering as a trademark any particular descriptive matter appearing in the specifications, drawings or claims of the 
expired patent, whether or not such matter describes essential elements of the invention or claims. Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Mfg. Co., 326 U.S. 249, 256, 90 L. Ed. 47, 66 S. Ct. 101, 1946 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 616 (1945) 
(emphasis added). "
1461,9," The legislative history of the 1998 amendment indicates that functionality was always deemed a defense even to 
""incontestable"" trademarks: ""The language clarifies that matter which is wholly functional must be refused registration, a position 
that is completely consistent with the intent of the Trademark Act. This change codifies both the case law in this matter and the 
long-standing practice of the Office to refuse registration to matter that is wholly functional based on a combined reading of 
sections 1, 2and 45 of the Trademark Act."" 144 Cong. Rec. S6564-03, S6573 (June 18, 1998) (summary of introduced bill by 
Sen. Hatch). The legislation itself also described the addition of functionality as a ""technical"" amendment. Trademark Law Treaty 
Implementation Act, Pub. L. No. 105-330, § 201, 112 Stat. 3064 (1998) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. § 1051 et seq.). "
1463,10," Under the Morton-Norwich test, ""the effect upon competition 'is really the crux of the matter.'"" In re Morton-Norwich Products, 
Inc., 671 F.2d 1332, 1341 (C.C.P.A. 1982). "
1465,11," Also, despite Honeywell's repeated assertions to the TTAB that competitors had been free to use round designs at least after 
1970, Honeywell did not inform the TTAB that it had threatened to sue competitors who sought to use such a design. The 
evidence shows that Honeywell threatened to sue both Quad Six and Hunter Fan for violating what Honeywell claimed were 
common law trademark rights in the round thermostat. See Eco. Resp. Br., Exs. 27 (Quad Six), 26 (Hunter Fan). The evidence 
indicates that Honeywell viewed the acquisition of Quad Six as an alternative to litigation to protect the round design. Eco Resp. 
Br., Ex. 27 at 007776."
1465,12," Honeywell has argued that Eco cannot raise a defense of fraud because it was not pleaded with particularity. See Fed. R. Civ. 
P. 9(b). However, this case is before the court on a motion for preliminary injunction. If Eco wishes to amend its reply to 
Honeywell's counterclaims to add a defense of fraud, it will certainly be entitled to do so under the liberal amendment standard 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15. Also, Eco has stated its allegations of fraud with great particularity in its briefs in opposition to 
Honeywell's motion for preliminary injunction and has supported the allegations with evidence that would at least permit an 
inference of fraudulent intent. "
1468,13," Eco's first lawyer did not say that he agreed with Honeywell's assertion of broad rights to the circular shape, only that he could 
not recommend taking a course of action contrary to Honeywell's assertion of its rights. In the face of a potential adversary with 
Honeywell's resources and desire to protect the round design, that first lawyer's advice may have reflected only sensible 
business advice that took into account the expense and risks of litigation. "

1477,4," All of the major cases relied on by defendants which found implied repeal involved situations where it was clear that the 
challenged conduct was either expressly permitted under the regulatory system, or that the SEC had the authority to allow the 
challenged conduct. In NASD, Congress had expressly given the SEC the power to authorize otherwise anticompetitive 
restrictions on sales and distributions and the Supreme Court held that implied repeal was necessary because there could be no 
reconciliation of the SEC's authority ""to permit these and similar restrictive agreements with the Sherman Act's declaration that 
they are illegal per se."" NASD, 422 U.S. at 729. In Gordon, the Supreme Court found implied immunity where Congress had 
been aware of the system of fixed commission rates at issue and its anticompetitive features, but gave the SEC jurisdiction to 
establish and supervise this system. Gordon, 422 U.S. 659, 690-91, 45 L. Ed. 2d 463, 95 S. Ct. 2598. In Finnegan, the Second 
Circuit found implied immunity where a direct conflict existed between antitrust law, which would prohibit joint takeover bidders, 
and the Williams Act which allowed the joint bidding as long as it complied with SEC disclosure regulations. Finnegan, 915 F.2d 
at 829-31. The Second Circuit found implied immunity in Friedman because, much like the restrictive agreements in NASD, 
Congress had specifically authorized price stabilization mechanisms in the Exchange Act subject to SEC disapproval. Friedman, 
313 F.3d at 800-03. Finally, in Options, although the restrictive agreements at issue were prohibited by the SEC at the time of 
the lawsuit, the SEC had the authority to, and did for a time, permit them. Options, 317 F.3d at 148-50. The Second Circuit saw 
""no way to reconcile that SEC authority, which may be exercised to permit agreements for exclusive listing of equity options, with 
the antitrust laws."" Id. at 150."
1477,5," In fact, in the notice, the NASD states that the exchange of price information among competitors in this context ""may raise 
serious anti-competitive concerns."" Id. This NASD view is entirely consistent with the antitrust laws. "
1483,1," ""Tipping"" refers to a changing market share based on the economic theory of a ""feedback effect,"" which holds that the 
attractiveness of a product to consumers increases with the number of persons using it. In this case, Sun offered, and the district 
court accepted, the prediction that the vast number of consumers using Microsoft's Windows PC operating systems will prompt 
software developers to opt to write applications software based on Microsoft's middleware with the effect that Microsoft's brand 
of middleware will become entrenched in the emerging, albeit distinct, market for middleware -- i.e., ""general purpose, Internet-
enabled distributed computing platforms."" "
1485,2," The California litigation is described in part in  Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 999 F. Supp. 1301 (N.D. Cal. 1998);  
Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 21 F. Supp. 2d 1109 (N.D. Cal. 1998);  Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 
188 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 1999); and  Sun Microsystems, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 992 (N.D. Cal. 2000). "
1488,3," As a practical matter, the determination of whether the limited circumstances for considering a preliminary injunction have been 
demonstrated and the analysis under the four-part Blackwelder analysis are routinely combined in applying the Blackwelder test 
alone. But the conceptual distinction between the appropriate circumstances justifying consideration of a preliminary injunction 
and the factors informing the exercise of discretion for its entry can be important, as it is in this case, because if the 
circumstances justifying consideration of a preliminary injunction are not present, then the discretion-informing balancing of 
factors need not be conducted."
1488,4," Although this circuit's emphasis on the balance of the hardships has been criticized as inconsistent with Supreme Court 
precedent ""by overvaluing the inquiry into the relative equities of granting and denying a requested injunction to an extent that 
essentially denies any value whatsoever to the inquiry into the likelihood of success on the merits,"" see  Safety-Kleen, 274 F.3d 
at 868 (Luttig, J., concurring), we remain bound by the test as it has been consistently articulated and applied by prior appeals, 
see  Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., 315 F.3d 264, 271 n.2 (4th Cir. 2002) (addressing precisely this criticism of our hardship 
balancing test and concluding that the test must nonetheless be applied). "
1501,1," The Court dealt with ADP's claims that Koenig breached the Stock Option Agreements between the parties, that he breached 
the agreement that governed his severance, and that he benefitted from unjust enrichment, fraud, unfair dealing and disloyalty. 
The counts remaining are Koenig's antitrust claims, his motion to amend his complaint, and ADP's six remaining counterclaims, 
which include violations of the Lanham Act, unfair competition, two counts of tortious interference and 2 counts of unjust 
enrichment. "
1503,2," How much harm could Koenig really have suffered, ADP argues, if Koenig was able to take the job as CEO of EEL and remain 
in that position? ADP claims that no agreement, in reality, prevented Koenig from competing with ADP as the head of EEL. 
(Def.'s Mot. at 8.) "
1517,1," This litigation involves two consolidated cases: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. (""MGM"") v. Grokster, Ltd., CV 01-8541-
SVW, and Lieber v. Consumer Empowerment BV, CV 01-9923-SVW. Sharman's counterclaims are directed only against the 
plaintiffs in the MGM v. Grokster case (""Plaintiffs"" for purposes of this Motion), consisting of many of the world's largest motion 
picture studios and music recording companies. "
1524,2," The Court does not reach the question whether this holding applies to copyright misuse, but rather assumes for purposes of 
this Motion that it does. The Court notes, however, that copyright misuse is an equitable doctrine distinct in many respects from 
the (generally) case-independent, binary question of patent validity. Accordingly, regardless the posture in which it is presented - 
whether under the ambit of declaratory relief or as an affirmative defense - the issue of copyright misuse may well be 
jurisdictionally moot upon a finding that the alleged infringer is not liable for infringement. "
1553,1," The records of BOA indicate that a Nancy Ross is also a responsible party for the only credit card account that plaintiff Ross is 
responsible for at BOA. However, since Nancy Ross is not a named plaintiff to this action, this Court will treat plaintiff Ross's 
account as if it were held in his name alone. (Uhlig Decl. PP 4-6.) "
1555,2," Plaintiffs' reliance on Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., 306 F.3d 17 (2d Cir. 2002), for the proposition that the 
arbitration agreement was never entered into between plaintiffs Ruga and Ross and First USA and BOA, respectively, is 
misplaced. The Second Circuit in Specht noted, at least under California law, that receipt of a physical document containing 
contractual terms or notice thereof, puts a person on inquiry notice of all the terms in that physical document. Specht, 306 F.3d 
at 31. The Specht court found that in ""circumstances . . . where consumers are urged to download free software at the 
immediate click of a button, a reference to the existence of license terms on a submerged screen is not sufficient to place 
consumers on inquiry or constructive notice of those terms."" 306 F.3d at 32. This is in contrast to this action where each plaintiff 
received a physical copy of the arbitration agreement. "
1556,3," Although plaintiffs have alleged that First USA and Bank One on the one hand, and BOA and BOA Corp. on the other, are 
agents of each other, and that the parents are the alter egos of the subsidiaries, the factual basis for such a finding is lacking. 
More importantly, defendants do not rely on these allegations in their argument for arbitration. "
1558,4," Plaintiffs' argument that the question of arbitrability is a ""legal issue"" and not a ""Claim"" as that word is used in the First USA 
arbitration clause is without merit. The term ""Claim"" is defined in the arbitration clause to include ""any claim, dispute or 
controversy."" (Barrett Decl. Ex. 1.) Clearly, the question of whether the arbitrator or the Court should determine arbitrability can, 
and should, be deemed a claim, dispute or controversy. "
1562,5," Plaintiffs' argument also ignores the fact that other courts have found claims alleging horizontal price-fixing claims to be subject 
to arbitration. See, e.g., Acquaire, 906 F. Supp. at 836-37; Gemco, 671 F. Supp. at 978-80."
1562,6," Plaintiffs' reliance on AlliedSignal, Inc. v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 183 F.3d 568 (7th Cir. 1999), is equally misplaced. In AlliedSignal, 
the Seventh Circuit unremarkably held that the claim in that case was not subject to arbitration because it was outside the scope 
of the arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties. 183 F.3d at 572-73. As one court has already noted, ""AlliedSignal 
must be confined to its facts."" LCA, Inc. v. Sharp Elec. Corp., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12470, No. 00-3283, 2000 WL 1222044, at 
*3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 22, 2000). Further, as noted above plaintiffs' antitrust claims in this action are within the scope of the arbitration 
clauses at issue here. "
1563,7," Plaintiffs' suggestion that the arbitration clauses at issue here are unconscionable because they appear in ""pre-printed forms"" 
and are allegedly in ""fine print,"" are without merit. HN20[
] The use of pre-printed forms does not convert an otherwise valid 
contract into an unconscionable contract. See Bischoff v. DirecTV, Inc., 180 F. Supp. 2d 1097, 1105 (C.D. Cal. 2002); Lloyd v. 
MBNA America Bank, N.A., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8279, No. 00 Civ. 109, 2001 WL 194300, at *4 (D. Del. Feb. 22, 2001). 
Further, the arbitration clauses in this action are not in ""fine print"" and include ""blockcapitalized warnings"" to setoff the arbitration 
clause from the rest of the agreement. Thus, they are not unconscionable. See Bank One, N.A. v. Coates, 125 F. Supp. 2d 819, 
831 (S.D. Miss.), aff'd, 34 Fed. Appx. 964 (2002); Dorsey v. H.C.P. Sales, Inc., 46 F. Supp. 2d 804, 808 (N.D. Ill. 1999). "
1564,8," The Requests listed in the NAF Code include, inter alia, requests for amendment, subpoena, discovery order, and continuance. 
(Wolson Decl. II, NAF Code at 40.)"
1564,9," Plaintiffs' argument that the NAF Code unreasonably subjects them to a ""loser pays"" cost-shifting provision is unavailing. The 
applicable NAF Code only permits an award of fees and costs in favor of a party as permitted by law. (Wolson Decl. II, NAF 
Code Rule 37(C).) Thus, plaintiffs are in no worse a position under the NAF Code then they would be in federal court. "
1565,10," Plaintiffs' remaining arguments that the First USA and BOA arbitration clauses are unconscionable are also without merit. The 
First USA arbitration clause's alleged one-sided ""carve-out"" is not unconscionable under Delaware law. See Hale, 2001 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 8045, 001 WL 687371, at *4-7 (holding that an identical arbitration clause was not unconscionable under Delaware 
law). Similarly, the BOA arbitration clause's alleged one-sided ""carve-out"" does not make the arbitration agreement 
unenforceable under Arizona law. See Valdiviezo v. Phelps Dodge Hidalgo Smelter, Inc., 995 F. Supp. 1060, 1066-67 (D. Ariz. 
1997) (holding that clause permitting defendant to unilaterally chose between two alternative dispute resolution mechanisms is 
enforceable under Arizona law). "
1566,11," Plaintiffs further argue that compelling arbitration in this case would require the Court to ""splinter"" proof in a manner that 
contravenes the Seventh Amendment. Plaintiffs cite no case authority for their position and this Court has found none. An issue 
of splintering proof in violation of the Seventh Amendment does not arise in this case because the claims litigated in federal 
court will be between different parties than the claims litigated in the arbitration."
1566,12," Notably, plaintiffs cite no authority for their proposition that arbitration should be denied where plaintiffs cannot effectively and 
efficiently proceed against all defendants in a single proceeding. Nor does this Court find any support for such a contention. "
1567,13," The cases that plaintiffs cite for support are inapposite. Specifically, Broughton v. Cigna Healthplans of Cal., 21 Cal. 4th 1066, 
90 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 988 P.2d 67 (1999), upon which plaintiffs heavily rely, involves a statute unique to California, and is thus 
irrelevant here. "
1572,14," Moreover, VISA correctly notes that HN42[
] a principal and its agent may be incapable of conspiring under Section One. 
See, e.g., Fuchs Sugars & Syrups, Inc. v. Amstar Corp., 602 F.2d 1025, 1031 & n.5 (2d Cir. 1979). However, at the motion to 
dismiss stage, a factual predicate for finding that VISA and its members are agents of each other is lacking. Thus, this issue is 
more appropriate for a motion for summary judgment, and this Court declines to dismiss the Complaint on that basis at this time. "
1574,15," Counsel for the plaintiffs' invitation to ignore the pertinent section of Regulation Z in favor of the broader statutory language is 
declined. HN49[
] Congress delegated the task of carrying out the purpose of TILA to the Federal Reserve Board, see 15 U.S.C. § 1604(a), and those regulations are to be deferred to when construing the language of TILA. See Milhollin, 444 U.S. at 
566; Mayfield, 1999 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4048, 1999 WL 182586, at *3."
1574,16," The non-card issuing defendants are as follows: defendants Citigroup, Inc.; Bank of America Corporation; Bank One 
Corporation; J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.; Providian Financial Corp.; Household International, Inc.; MBNA Corporation; Citibank 
(Nevada) N.A.; and Household Credit Card Service, Inc. (Compl. PP 41, 45, 49, 52, 56, 61, 66, 68, 70.) Defendants Citibank 
(Nevada) N.A. and Household Credit Card Service, Inc. are alleged to merely process certain general purpose card transactions. 
(Compl. PP 45, 68.) The remaining non-card issuing bank defendants are bank holding parent companies of the card-issuing 
defendants. "
1575,17," Notably, the parties have not argued what substantive law should apply to the veil-piercing analysis. "
1576,18," The Citigroup defendants also argue that plaintiffs have failed to allege that defendant Universal Financial Corp. (""UFC"") is a 
creditor under TILA because it only issued cards to businesses, not consumers, during the relevant time period, and thus are 
outside the scope of TILA. As accurate a picture as that may be of UFC's practices during the relevant time period, it is evidence 
outside the Complaint and this Court will not consider it. Thus, plaintiffs' allegations that UFC issued cards to one or more 
plaintiffs suffice to allege that UFC was a creditor under TILA on a motion to dismiss. "
1577,19," Of course, plaintiffs also allege improper disclosure violations of TILA, as well as omission violations of TILA. (Compl. P 
170(b).) Plaintiffs do not argue that a presumption of reliance should be applied for the improper disclosure claim. Thus, 
allegations of actual detrimental reliance are necessary for claims of actual damages under TILA for improper disclosure claims. "
1578,20," It is noteworthy that Plaintiffs argue for a fraud-based presumption of reliance on this issue, but elsewhere insist that TILA 
based claims are not subject to the same heightened pleading standard as fraud claims. "
1579,21," Although the Weiner court did not address a claim for aiding and abetting a TILA claim, its reasoning applies to those claims 
as well. "
1580,22," Plaintiffs attempt to distinguish Weiner based on the fact that the opinion was written thirty years ago, and based on an alleged 
significantly different factual scenario. Plaintiffs arguments are unavailing. Plaintiffs do not articulate why this Court should 
disregard Weiner based simply on its age. Plaintiffs do not argue that the language of TILA has changed significantly in the last 
thirty years, or that the state of the law has changed. Further, the Weiner court did not rely on the facts before it to find that a 
claim for conspiracy did not exist. Rather, it based its ruling on the fact that conspiracy was not included within the terms of the 
statute itself. See Weiner, 358 F. Supp. at 692-94; see also Dinsmore, 135 F.3d at 843 (""The Supreme Court in Central Bank did 
not in any way rely on the level of scienter at issue, but on the fact that aiding and abetting was not included within the terms of 
the statute itself."")"
1580,23," It is also noteworthy that HN64[
] TILA was amended in 1982 to eliminate ""arrangers"" of credit from the definition of creditor under TILA. Pub. L. No. 97-320, 96 Stat. 1469, § 702 (1982); Pub. L. No. 96-221, 94 Stat. 132, § 602 (1980). This amendment 
further evidences Congress's intent to prohibit liability for aiding or abetting a TILA violation."
1580,24," Further, plaintiffs' argument that a claim for conspiracy and aiding and abetting should be found to be implied in TILA if the 
Court reads the statute liberally in accord with its remedial nature, is unpersuasive. As the Supreme Court stated in Central 
Bank, ""policy considerations cannot override our interpretation of the text and structure of the Act."" 511 U.S. at 188. "
1590,1," This provision is set out in identical provisions of Oregon law at ORS § 72.2070 and in the law of North Carolina at N.C. Gen. 
Stat. § 25-2-207."
1590,2," For the purposes of this motion, plaintiffs assume that ""SGL Carbon did not send an earlier 'acknowledgment' as called for by 
the Purchase Order, which would operate as an acceptance."" "
1595,1," The four ""core"" routes are DFW-Kansas City, DFW-Wichita, DFW-Colorado Springs, and DFW-Long Beach. "
1596,2," The district court noted that in the third quarter of 2000, New York, including LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark, was served by nine 
LCCs with a 9.7% market share. Chicago, including Chicago O'Hare and Midway, was served by six LCCs and Southwest, for a 
total market share of 12.3%. Denver had an LCC market share of 15.3%. Atlanta had an LCC market share of 16.8%."
1596,3," For example, in 1994, American calculated ValuJet's stage-length adjusted cost per available seat mile to be 4.32 cents, and 
American's to be 8.54 cents. Southwest has costs that are 30% lower than American's."
1596,4," This pattern is illustrated by the average fares and passengers on the DFW-Wichita route before, during, and after one of the

1599,5," Although Brooke Group involved primary-line price discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a), the 
Supreme Court assured that the analysis applicable to predatory pricing claims under § 2 of the Sherman Act is identical. 509 
U.S. at 222 (""Whether the claim alleges predatory pricing under § 2 of the Sherman Act or primary-line price discrimination under 
the Robinson-Patman Act, two prerequisites to recovery remain the same."")."
1599,6," The government notes in its brief that the ""gravamen of the complaint is not limited to American's pricing."" (Appellant's Br. at 
69.) Rather, the complained of behavior includes American's capacity additions. However, as the district court correctly noted, 
prices and productive output are ""two sides of the same coin."" United States v. AMR Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1194 (D. Kan. 
2001). While the specific behavior complained of in the instant case is an increase in output or frequency, these actions must be "
1600,," analyzed in terms of their effect on price and cost. Thus, in order to succeed in the present action, the government must meet 
the standards of proof for predatory pricing cases established in Brooke Group."
1600,7," In a seminal law review article, Professors Areeda and Turner argue that pricing below a firm's short-run marginal cost should 
be deemed unlawful, and that prices above that level should be deemed lawful. While they acknowledge that there may be 
situations where AVC will differ from marginal cost, they nevertheless advocate the use of AVC as a proxy in predatory pricing 
cases. Philip E. Areeda & Donald F. Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under Section 2 of The Sherman Act, 88 
Harv. L. Rev. 697, 718 (1975). "
1601,8," Not all of the government's tests are applicable to all of the routes. For example, Test Four cannot be applied to DFW-Long 
Beach."
1601,9," While the government has not completely abandoned Tests Two and Three on appeal, it has not chosen to press them beyond 
a statement in a footnote of their Reply Brief noting that ""American's criticisms of Tests 2 and 3 are incorrect."" (Appellant's Reply 
Br. at 12.) Notably, the government has previously taken the position that utilizing fully allocated costs as a pricing standard 
would result in ""stultification of competition"" and should be rejected as ""contrary to the public interest."" S. Pac. 
Communications Co. v. AT&T, 556 F. Supp. 825, 923 n.107 (D.D.C. 1982)."
1601,10," In holding that Tests Two and Three are invalid as a matter of law, we consider the uncontested fact that these tests, by 
relying on FAUDNC, measure a significant amount of American's fixed costs. As such, Tests Two and Three are inappropriate 
measures of incremental costs under Brooke Group, as they cannot demonstrate that American priced below an ""appropriate 
measure of cost"" with respect to the challenged capacity additions."
1601,11," VAUDNC refers to ""Variable earnings plus Upline/Downline contribution Net of Costs."" AMR Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d at 1174. It 
is a measure of variable costs, calculated over an 18-month planning horizon, and represents 72% of the total costs in 
American's decision accounting system. "
1602,12," Unlike the other costs measures, which are taken straight out of American's internal accounting system, VAUDNC-AC is a 
government creation. It represents VAUDNC costs plus the cost of aircraft ownership, which is traditionally considered a fixed 
cost in the airline industry, not an avoidable cost of changes in capacity on a route. By treating aircraft ownership as a variable 
expense, this measure reduces the apparent performance of the routes by increasing the costs attributed to operations on a 
particular flight or route. VAUDNC-AC represents over 79% of the total costs in American's decision accounting system. The 
district court concluded that VAUDNC-AC overstates short-run cost because it includes fixed, unavoidable aircraft-ownership 
costs."
1602,13," For example, if an airline earned $ 20.6 million on a route that cost $ 18 million to operate, it would have $ 2.6 million in profit. 
If the airline then added a flight to the route that would cost $ 500,000 to operate, but brought in an additional $ 1 million in 
revenue from passengers, the airline would make $ 500,000 profit. If adding this extra capacity to the route reduced the 
profitability of other flights on that route, reducing revenue for the rest of the route by $ 600,000 down to $ 20 million, under Test 
One, this conduct would be considered predatory because rather than comparing the additional flight's $ 1 million in revenue to 
its $ 500,000 in costs, Test One looks only to the reduction in profits on the route as a whole from $ 2.6 million to $ 2.5 million. 
Thus, this conduct would be labeled predatory because the profits for the route as a whole declined, even though the capacity 
additions themselves were profitable and the route as a whole was still profitable. See Einer Elhauge, Why Above-Cost Price 
Cuts To Drive Out Entrants Are Not Predatory--and the Implications for Defining Costs and Market Power, 112 Yale L.J. 681, 
694 (2003). It is clear, therefore, that, in proffering Test One, the government has not ""attempted to identify the actual costs 
associated with the capacity additions."" AMR Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d at 1202. "
1603,14," The government's four proxies are, in effect, an illustration of the long-recognized fact that ""the true marginal costs of 
production are difficult to generate."" Stearns, 170 F.3d at 532. The difficulty inherent in isolating the precise costs associated 
with production increases is precisely why most courts attempt to ""estimate [marginal cost] by using average variable costs."" Id.; 
see also Morgan v. Ponder, 892 F.2d 1355, 1362 n.17 (noting that ""where it is difficult to isolate variable costs . . . the plaintiff 
should be required to prove across-the-board predatory pricing"")."
1603,15," The district court also stated that even if American had priced below an appropriate measure of cost, it was nevertheless 
entitled to summary judgment because ""American's prices only matched, and never undercut, the fares of the new entrant, low 
cost carriers on the four core routes."" AMR Corp., 140 F. Supp. 2d at 1204. In so concluding, the district court essentially 
imported the statutory ""meeting competition"" defense from the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(b). While we have never 
applied the ""meeting competition"" defense in a § 2 predatory pricing case, the district court reasoned that ""there is strong 
inferential support for the idea that the defense may be appropriate in a given case."" Id. at 1204. There may be strong 
arguments for application of the meeting competition defense in the Sherman Act context by analogy to the Robinson-Patman 
context. However, unlike in the Robinson-Patman Act, such a defense is not expressly provided for by the terms of the Sherman 
Act. The Supreme Court has never mentioned the possibility of such a defense under the Sherman Act. We therefore decline to 
rule that the ""meeting competition"" defense applies in the § 2 context. "
1604,16, Appellee's Motion to File Appellee's Appendix Under Seal is GRANTED. 
1606,1," Defendant's brief misstates, in part, the basis for some of the court's prior rulings, Plaintiffs' theory of the case, the evidence 
(which must be viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party), and the governing law. I will not take time to correct 
those errors here. The record, including the opinion denying Defendant's motion for summary judgment, will reflect what actually 
transpired. "
1607,2," In addition, although someone did write ""Scenario B"" next to the damage award on the verdict form, it was not responsive to a 
question on the verdict form. The jury was not asked to explain how it arrived at its verdict. The words ""Scenario B"" were not part 
of the verdict read by the clerk in open court. When the jury was polled, the jurors were not asked whether those additional 
words were part of their unanimous verdict. It is surplusage that should be disregarded."
1607,3," Plaintiff's opposition brief frequently relies on the wrong legal standard, namely, the standard used by the court of appeals in 
deciding whether to reverse a jury verdict because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling. "
1608,4," These facts help distinguish this case from Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 
427 (1986), which Defendant cited at oral argument. In Cargill, there was no suggestion that the defendants were deliberately 
overpaying for livestock, stockpiling excessive inventory, and letting meat rot, in a calculated effort to keep competitors from 
obtaining adequate supplies of beef at reasonable prices. Rather, any price increase in Cargill was the natural result of a more 
efficient competitor with lower operating costs, who was able to pay higher prices for raw materials coveted both by the 
defendants and their rivals. Likewise, any loss of market share and profits in Cargill would have resulted only from vigorous 
competition by a more efficient competitor. Weyerhaeuser insists this was the situation here too, but the jury found otherwise, 
and there was sufficient evidence to support that determination. "
1610,5," It is therefore unnecessary to decide whether the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is an ""avoidance or affirmative defense"" within the 
meaning of FRCP 8(c). "
1612,6," Other circuits also have recognized a ""fraud"" exception. See Oberndorf v. City & County of Denver, 900 F.2d 1434, 1440 (10th 
Cir. 1990) (Noerr-Pennington does not provide immunity where legitimate lobbying efforts are accompanied by illegal or 
fraudulent actions); Wright v. DeArmond, 977 F.2d 339 (7th Cir. 1992) (Noerr-Pennington ""does not exempt from the antitrust 
laws fraudulent appeals to judicial, administrative, or legislative bodies""); Westborough Mall, Inc. v. City of Cape Girardeau, 
Missouri, 693 F.2d 733, 746 (8th Cir. 1982) (""Noerr-Pennington ""was not 'intended to protect those who employ illegal means to 
influence their representatives in government'""). "
1617,1," The disqualification motion is based on Lexmark's allegations that, when agreeing to assist Lexmark with several patent 
applications in 1999 (not related to this case), Moore & Van Allen failed to disclose to Lexmark that the law firm had previously "
1618,," filed, on SCC's behalf, a declaratory judgment action against Lexmark in this court and that the declaratory judgment action was 
pending. Lexmark also alleges that Moore & Van Allen intentionally discontinued its representation of Lexmark in the patent work 
so that the firm could represent SCC in this action. Lexmark contends that Moore & Van Allen's conduct violates North Carolina's 
Rules of Professional Responsibility. See N.C. RULES OF PROF'L RESPONSIBILITY R. 1.7"
1618,2," The background facts are summarized in part from the factual findings made by the federal district court in Kentucky in its order 
granting Lexmark's motion for a preliminary injunction against SCC. See Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 
253 F. Supp. 2d 943, 946 (E.D. Ky. 2003). "
1619,3," As stated previously, customers can purchase regular Lexmark toner cartridges directly from Lexmark or from a Lexmark

1620,5," Lexmark's regular toner cartridges also contain microchips that use a technological measure, but the technological measure 
does not prevent the regular cartridges from being remanufactured by a third party and then reused in Lexmark printers."
1620,6," SCC sells one Smartek microchip for use with Lexmark's T520/522 toner cartridges and another Smartek microchip for use 
with Lexmark's T620/622 toner cartridges. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d at 955. "
1621,7," The DMCA was adopted after heavy lobbying by the entertainment industry in response to widespread, unauthorized copying 
of music and movies via the internet, and the Act generally prevents unauthorized copying of music and movies. See 144 
CONG. REC. S4435-04, 4439 (1998), available at  1998 WL 222890 (""The bill addresses the problems caused when 
copyrighted works are disseminated through the Internet and other electronic transmissions without the authority of the copyright 
owner."") (statement of Sen. Leahy). Sections 1201(a)(2)(A), (B) , and (C)  of the Act specifically provide: HN1[
] (2) No person shall manufacture, import, offer to the public, provide, or otherwise traffic in any technology, product, 
service, device, component, or part thereof, that-- (A) is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls 
access to a work protected under this title; (B) has only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent a technological measure that 
effectively controls access to a work protected under this title; or (C) is marketed by that person or another acting in concert with that person with that person's knowledge for use in 
circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title. In the Kentucky action, Lexmark alleges that SCC's Smartek chip violates section 1201 because the Smartek chip mimics the 
authentication sequence used by Lexmark chips and unlawfully tricks the T520/522 and T620/622 laser printers into accepting a 
remanufactured cartridge, thus ""circumventing"" the ""technological measures"" that control Lexmark's copyrighted Toner Loading 
and the Printer Engine programs."
1621,8," The Kentucky action is pending, with a scheduled trial date of May 2004. See Scheduling Order (Kentucky action) (attached in 
the record as Ex. D. to SCC's Br. Opp'n Lexmark's Mot. Dismiss or Transfer ([pleading # 19]). "
1622,9," Although Moore was decided before promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the ""transaction or occurrence"" 
language in Rule 13(a) substantially mirrors the Moore Court's definition of a compulsory counterclaim as one ""'arising out of the 
transaction which is the subject matter of the suit,' [and which] must be pleaded."" 270 U.S. at 609 (quoting Equity Rule 30); see 
also FED. R. CIV. P. 13 advisory committee's note (""This is substantially [former] Equity Rule 30[.]"")."
1622,10," The Painter court stressed that HN5[
] examining only whether the claims required the ""same evidence"" was too narrow a 
definition of a single transaction or occurrence, stating that ""[a] counterclaim may still arise from the same 'transaction or 
occurrence', as a logically related claim even though the evidence needed to prove the opposing claims may be quite different."" 
Id. at 332; see also Hospital Bldg. Co. v. Trustees of Rex Hosp., 86 F.R.D. 694, 696 (E.D.N.C. 1980); 6 CHARLES ALAN 
WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 1410 (2nd ed. 1990). Thus, 
the Painter court considered the 4-part inquiry as the more appropriate way to determine whether claims arise out of the same 
transaction or occurrence. "
1623,11," In the Kentucky action, SCC argued in its brief opposing the preliminary injunction motion that Lexmark: long has engaged in a campaign to stifle legitimate competition from toner cartridge manufacturers. . . . Lexmark, by placing 
a small microchip in toner cartridges for its laser printers, has been attempting to thwart remanufacturers' ability to compete. 
. . . . Finally, permitting Lexmark to use either copyright law or the DMCA to stifle competition in markets for noncopyrighted 
goods . . . would unintentionally sanction copyright misuse. . . . . The consequences of such misuse would offend 
established economic policies by reducing competition, promoting monopolization, and . . . increasing prices to the 
consumer. . . Lexmark's true and only purpose is to exclude competition from third party remanufacturers. The Complaint in 
this action is only part of a long, mostly unsuccessful effort by Lexmark to secure a market in toner cartridges to itself and to 
preclude any and all competitors from that market. . . . Even were they able to meet demand, a sole supplier without price 
competition has the ability to artificially raise prices to the consumer, in contravention of the anti-trust laws and public 
policies. . . . . See Lexmark's Reply Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss or Transfer, at 4. "
1624,12," In the order granting the preliminary injunction, the court in the Kentucky action noted that to establish the defense of copyright 
misuse in a copyright infringement action a defendant can show either (1) that the plaintiff violated the antitrust laws or (2) that 
the plaintiff illegally extended its monopoly beyond the scope of the copyright or violated the public policies underlying the 
copyright laws. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 253 F. Supp. 2d at 966. See also Service & Training, Inc., 963 F.2d at 690 (stating that 
misuse of one's copyright ""need not be a violation of antitrust law in order to comprise an equitable defense to an infringement 
action"") (quoting Lasercomb Am., Inc. v. Reynolds, 911 F.2d 970, 978 (4th Cir. 1990)). HN6[

affirmative defense and bars a culpable plaintiff from prevailing on an action for infringement of the misused copyright.

1626,14," SCC does not argue that its claims against Lexmark were ""first filed"" by virtue of filing the declaratory judgment action against 
Dallas on December 6, 2002. Indeed, the circumstances in this case do not warrant a finding that the claims against Lexmark

1650,2," Dr. Nancollas has since switched to phaco, although he still uses an approximately seven mm incision which requires stitches."
1650,3, The muscle cone is the area of muscle which encases the eyeball and the ocular nerve.
1650,4," When he first began at the Hospital, Dr. Nancollas employed a retrobulbar block in which he would insert the needle into the 
area of the muscle cone behind the eye. "
1651,5," The events giving rise to this suspension are not relevant to the outcome of this case. See Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., CV:l-
99-1100, order (M.D. Pa. Nov. 8, 2001) (holding that the Hospital may only present evidence of Dr. Gordon's conduct with 
respect to incidents which occurred after 1990 and have a bearing on its decision to impose Conditions 2 and 3 of the Conditions 
of Reappointment). Accordingly, the court will not go into any detail about these matters, except to note that Dr. Gordon had 
notice that he was being disciplined for these actions."
1651,6, The Hospital must report any suspension of over thirty days. 
1652,7," The Credentials Committee also found that Dr. Gordon engaged in two other instances of misconduct, neither of which is 
relevant to this case. See supra at fn 5."
1652,8, See supra at fn 5. 
1654,9, See infra at Part II.A.2.
1654,10," Dr. Gordon contends that this statement was false. However, he is incorrect. When Dr. Nancollas was unavailable to cover 
emergency calls, Dr. Kleincrt, a Geisinger ophthalmologist in State College, Pennsylvania, would cover Dr. Nancollas' calls."
1654,11," Although this statement also appeared in an advertisement placed during the summer of 1991- before Dr. Nancollas obtained 
his certification from the American Board of Ophthalmologists - the statement was not false. Dr. Nancollas was licensed as a 
medical doctor at that time. Possession of a state medical licence is the only prerequisite to practice ophthalmology. The 
advertisement did not indicate in any way that Dr. Nancollas possessed a board certification. Moreover, as of November of 1991, 
Dr. Nancollas was certified by the American Board of Ophthalmologists. (See Tr. (Nancollas) at 508-509 (""Q: Dr. Nancollas, you 
are currently Board certified by the American Board of Ophthalmologists correct? A: Yes. Q: You became Board certified in 
November of 1991? A: Yes."").) "
1655,12," In relevant part, the body of this letter reads as follows: Dear Dr. Gordon: I am writing to indicate the Hospital's concern and displeasure regarding the continued advertising for which you are 
responsible in [sic] local media. … It is recognized that you have the right to place such advertisements and to control the content thereof. The general feeling I am expressing at the request of members of our Board is objection to the adversarial and 
unprofessional tone prevalent in your advertisement. Members of the Board and others with whom I come in contact are 
increasingly expressing disappointment that the advertisements seem to be personal in nature, are unprofessional in 
content, and seem to be provoking a negative reaction among the general public. There is growing concern that these 
advertisements reflect poorly on the medical profession in general, on you in particular and on the Hospital as well. (Pls. Ex. 173 (emphasis added).)"
1655,13," By the Spring of 1997, Dr. Nancollas had begun to switch to phaco. "
1658,14," By this period of time, Dr. Gordon had sued the Hospital various times. Because he was Chairman of the Credentials 
Committee, Dr. Everhart was privy to this information. "
1659,15," HN1[
] The existence of an antitrust conspiracy is a question of fact. See Weiss v. York Hosp., 745 F.2d 786, 814 n.47 (3d Cir. 1984) (citations omitted)."
1659,16," The court finds that Dr. Gordon was not a credible witness. See infra at Part I.G. Accordingly, the court finds that he never 
made any such request to Palm."
1659,17," By this date, Dr. Gordon had obtained staff privileges at Holy Spirit Hospital in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. "
1661,18," For an in depth analysis of the market power issue, see infra at Part II.A.1.b."
1661,19," For an in depth analysis of anti-competitive effects, see infra at Part II.A.1.c. "
1665,20," To the extent that Plaintiffs claim that the agreement between Dr. Everhart and the Hospital, which provided that Dr. Everhart's 
surgery center would not compete with the Hospital in providing a facility for outpatient cataract surgery, constitutes an 
impermissible market allocation agreement, the court finds that this agreement did not proximately cause Dr. Gordon's alleged 
injury. Dr. Gordon's conduct caused the imposition of the Conditions of Reappointment and his ultimate exclusion. See 
Petruzzi's IGA Supermkts., 998 F.2d at 1229 (holding that HN11[
] to satisfy initial burden under rule of reason analysis, the 
plaintiff must establish not only concerted action, but also that the concerted action proximately caused the plaintiff's injury). "
1666,21," Likewise, to establish a Section 1 illegal tying claim, the plaintiff may satisfy its burden by demonstrating that the defendant 
possessed market power. See infra at Parts II.B.1."
1666,22," Alternatively, market power also exists if a firm can profitably maintain lower product or service quality, at the same price, for a 
significant period of time. (See Tr. (Harris) at 2335 (stating that market power also refers to the ability to lower quality, but 
emphasizing that ""it must be profitable. Anyone could set a price higher than the competitive level, but if no [sic] comes to you, 
then it is not an exercise of market power. That is a bad business decision."").)"
1666,23," Based on testimony provided by Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Martin Gaynor, it appears that Plaintiffs are alleging that several of these 
markets are actually submarkets of other broader markets. (See Tr. (Gaynor) at 1302.). However, this is a distinction without a 
difference. HN16[
] Antitrust law treats markets and submarkets the same way. See Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 325 n. 42, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510, 82 S. Ct. 1502 (1962) (""Within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist which, 
in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes.""). While it is important for the court to determine what exactly 
are the distinct markets at issue in this case, it does not matter whether those markets are termed markets themselves or 
whether they are submarkets of each other. Therefore, to avoid confusion, the court will refrain from using the term submarket. 
But see infra at fn. 28. "
1667,24," Plaintiffs also contend that there are four additional physician services markets at issue in this case which correspond to the 
complimentary facility services markets: (1) outpatient cataract physician services in a hospital setting; (2) outpatient cataract 
physician services in either a hospital or a free-standing surgery center; (3) inpatient eye surgery physician services; and (4) 
emergency eye surgery physician services. The Hospital, however, is not a participant in the physician services aspects of these 
markets and, therefore, cannot possess market power in those markets. Moreover, Plaintiffs allegation is that the Hospital 
leveraged its power in the facility services markets to cause competitive injury in the physician services and facility services 
markets. Thus, whether the physician services markets are sufficiently well defined is irrelevant to our purposes. The court, 
therefore, will not discuss these markets in its analysis of market power. However, because these markets are complimentary 
that is, for each facility services markets there is a corresponding physician services market - any holding regarding the 
appropriate facility services market would pertain equally to the corresponding physician services market. This is a result of the 
very nature of eye treatment. Patients will only purchase a facility service along with the corresponding physician service. That 
is, patients undergoing eye treatment need both a facility in which they can be treated and a physician who will treat them."
1667,25," The Hospital argues that Plaintiffs have failed to prove several of the other markets as well. However, those objections pertain 
to the geographic scope of those markets. Those objections are discussed below. See infra at Part II.A.1.b.ii."
1667,26," Although children may not undergo surgery in a free-standing surgery center, it is beyond dispute that the overwhelming 
majority of cataract surgery patients are elderly. "
1669,27, The same holds true in the proposed complementary markets for physician services.
1669,28," Although these numbers include other forms of outpatient ophthalmic surgery, outpatient cataract surgery accounted for over 
95% of these procedures. (See Tr. (Harris) at 2346 (""I looked at what I call Gordon/Nancollas procedures. And that was the set 
of procedures performed by Dr. Gordon and Dr. Nancollas. It was overwhelmingly in excess of 95 percent cataracts, but it 
included a few other procedures as well."").)"
1669,29," Although Dr. Gaynor testified at trial that the disparity between Dr. Gordon's procedures and Dr. Nancollas' procedures in 
1999 resulted from the release of pent-up demand, this tends to further undercut Dr. Gaynor's conclusion regarding consumer 
preference. The penl-up demand resulted because patients viewed Dr. Gordon as a better surgeon than Dr. Nancollas. This 
confirms that quality, not setting, is what truly drives consumer choice in the context of outpatient cataract surgery facility and 
physician services."
1669,30," As a brief matter of clarification, outpatient cataract facility services in a hospital setting would likewise not qualify as a distinct 
submarket of the general market for outpatient cataract facility services. First, there is no industry recognition of these services 
as constituting separate economic entities from the general market for outpatient cataract surgery facility services. Second, there 
is no peculiar characteristic of outpatient cataract surgery performed in hospital setting. Third, there are virtually no specialized 
vendors who exclusively market themselves as providing facility services for outpatient cataract surgery in a hospital setting. 
Fourth, while there are distinct prices for such services depending on whether they are performed in a hospital or a free-standing 
surgery center, price is not relevant where, as here, the cost is usually borne by third party payers and not consumers. Fifth, for 
the same reason, there is little to no sensitivity to price changes. Sixth, a hospital setting is not a unique production facility 
because the same result can be obtained if the surgery is performed in a free-standing surgery center. Seventh, there are some 
distinct customers who must, or should, undergo outpatient cataract surgery in a hospital setting. However, the number of these 
patients is so small that they are not a reliable indicator of consumer preference. See Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. at 325 (listing 
seven factors in determining whether a submarket exists). The same holds true for the complimentary physician services market. "
1671,31," Dr. Gaynor did not feel the 1996 data was an ideal period for determining LIFO and LOFI because the Hospital suspended Dr. 
Gordon twice - the forty-five day suspension and the intervening summary suspension and imposed the Conditions of 
Reappointment during that year. Thus, according to Dr. Gaynor, because the Hospital had already engaged in allegedly 
predatory conduct during 1996, ""it is possible that, if anything, that could have artificially inflated the size of the geographic 
market."" (Tr. (Gaynor) at 1306.) Dr. Gaynor's conclusion, in this respect, is based on nothing more than mere speculation. 
According to Dr. Gaynor, ""the fact that Dr. Gordon is suspended and people can't see him disrupts the market. Then some 
people may choose to go elsewhere."" (Id.) However, without data indicating that patients actually did go else where as a result of 
Dr. Gordon's suspensions, the court is unwilling to accept Dr. Gaynor's conclusion that the 1996 data would inflate the breadth of 
the proposed geographic market. Moreover, even if patients fled Mifflin and Juniata Counties for cataract surgery, this would 
seem to suggest that patients viewed other suppliers of physician services as viable alternatives to Dr. Gordon and Dr. 
Nancollas. Thus, if this proves anything, it would prove that the geographic market is broader than Dr. Gaynor's Elzinga-Hogerty 
analysis suggests; not that it was artificially inflated. "
1672,32," In fact, when Dr. Gaynor sorted the zip codes according to their importance to the Hospital, the data did not satisfy either of 
the Elzinga-Hogerty tests. (See Tr. (Gaynor) at 1461; see also Appendix, Ex.A.) "
1673,33," 670 patients from Dr. Gaynor's proposed twenty-three zip code market underwent outpatient cataract surgery at hospitals in 
1996."
1673,34, The court may take judicial notice of these facts. See Fed. R. Evid. 201.
1673,35," As stated previously, outpatient cataract surgery procedures accounted for over 95% of the Gordon/Nancollas procedures. 
(See Tr. (Harris) at 2346.) "
1674,36," Basically, optometry involves examining the human eye for pathologies and the treatment of minor eye diseases such as 
conjunctivitis - inflamation of the eye. While optometrists may write prescriptions for eye glasses and some medications, they are 
not able to perform surgery. (See Tr. (Burns) at 2122.) "
1675,37," This document, however, also includes Snyder and Huntingdon Counties in its definition of its primary service area. (See id. at 
p. 15.)"
1675,38," With respect to the physician services aspect of the outpatient cataract surgery market, a physician need only obtain privileges 
at the Hospital, or another nearby hospital or surgery center (J.C. Blair, Centre Community, or even MCCSC for example), to 
begin immediately competing with Dr. Nancollas. "
1678,39," At trial, Ms. Hawk described the injury her husband sustained: Q: What happened right after, if anything, that [metal] strap broke and hit him in the face? A: He started yelling I lost my, I lost my eye. It hit him right in the eye. That is what he figured happened. Whenever he got 
hit in the eye, he figured something happened to his eye. So I jumped out of the truck. I walked over. I looked at it. There was like a lot of white -- all like a lot of gooey stuff in the 
front hanging down on his cheek. Q: Could you see what people ordinarily think to be an eye? A: The eye wasn't hanging out. It was like - I found it was like from the back of the eye hanging. (Tr. (Hawk) at 644-45.) "
1679,40," To the extent Plaintiffs also argue that the Hospital injured competition in the facility services markets through its exclusive 
contract with the anesthesiologists, that claim must fail. The market for such services is national in scope. See Balaklaw v. 
Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 799 (2d Cir. 1994) (affirming dismissal of Section 1 claim against hospital for exclusive dealing arising out of 
exclusive contract with anesthesiologists, in part, because ""anesthesiologists compete in a multi-state, if not national, market""). 
Therefore, the Hospital's exclusive contract with its anesthesiologists did not injure competition in the facility services markets at 
issue in this case. Any facility needing an anesthesiologist to function could recruit such a physician from any source other than 
the Hospital; as Dr. Gordon did when he opened MCCSC. "
1681,41," Plaintiffs presented no evidence whatsoever indicating that there are not enough providers of inpatient eye surgery physician 
services to meet demand. Moreover, the court finds that any such contention would be implausible. Inpatient eye surgery is quite 
rare and the geographic scope of this market is quite broad. See supra at Part II.A.1.b.i. Therefore, it is almost impossible that 
there are not enough ophthalmologists in the market to meet current levels of demand. "
1682,42," Moreover, the Third Circuit has held that HN31[
] res ipsa loquitur is an impermissible manner of proving causation in cases 
evaluated under the rule of reason test. See Town and Sound Custom Tops v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 959 F.2d 468, 486 (3d Cir. 
1992) (""To the extent that res ipsa loquitur … is a doctrine of the antitrust laws, it is limited to per se cases."")."
1682,43," If, on the other hand, the Conditions were unreasonably broad and precluded reasonable dissemination of truthful information 
to consumers, then the court could very well conclude that the injury to competition occurred as a result of the Hospital's 
decision to impose unreasonable restraints. However, as stated below, the Conditions were reasonable and narrowly tailored 
given Dr. Gordon's prior conduct. See infra at Parts I.A.2 and 3."
1682,44," Moreover, it is clear that even if Dr. Gordon were excluded from the market altogether, there are other physicians in the 
market providing high-quality care. Even Dr. Nancollas' ECCE and phaco procedures, about which Dr. Gordon cavils at length, 
fall within the standard of care. Although Dr. Gordon may have been the most surgically talented ophthalmologist in this area, 
the other ophthalmologists are perfectly capable of providing adequate high-quality care to patients in his place. Therefore, this 
injury is not sufficient to qualify as an antitrust injury. See Steuer v. National Medical Enter., 672 F. Supp. 1489, 1504 (D.S.C. 
1987) (""Practices that produce only an 'insignificant,' 'de minimis,' 'trivial,' or 'insubstantial' restriction on competition are not 
unlawful.""). "
1684,45," Of course, the court has already ruled that, with the exception of the market for emergency eye surgery facility services, 
Plaintiffs failed to meet their initial burden. See supra at Part II.A.1.d. The court has included this portion of its opinion merely to 
illustrate that even if Plaintiffs had met their initial burden, their unreasonable restraint on competition claim would still fail. "
1685,46," Condition 1 stated the following: ""You must treat Hospital personnel and physicians practicing at Lewistown Hospital in a 
courteous and professional manner. This means that you shall not raise your voice, swear, or in any way demean, belittle, or 
berate any Hospital personnel or physician practicing at the Hospital."" (Def. Ex. 227 (A)(11).) "
1687,47," The court has already recognized that the Hospital is engaged in business affecting interstate commerce. See supra at Part 
I.A. Yet, this does not relieve Plaintiffs' obligation to prove that the alleged tying arrangement affected a substantial amount of 
interstate commerce in the relevant tied market."
1687,48," Beverly Hawk, however, testified only as to the treatment rendered to her husband, William Hawk. This makes no difference. 
The court finds her testimony credible. "
1688,49," Section 2 of the Sherman Act reads as follows: HN42[
] Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person or 
persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $ 10,000,000 if a corporation, 
or, if any other person, $ 350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments in the 
discretion of the court."
1688,15," U.S.C. § 2. Of course, HN43[
] a private party may sue to enforce the provisions of the Sherman Act. See LePage's Inc. v. 
3M, 324 F.3d 141, 146 (3d Cir. 2003)."
1688,50," Moreover, McAleer did not join the Hospital Administration until March 30, 1998. (See Def. Ex. 557 at p.5, Ins. 1-4.) Therefore, 
he did not take part in the decisions to impose the Conditions of Reappointment and to ultimately exclude Dr. Gordon from the 
Medical-Dental Staff. "
1710,1," The affidavits submitted by plaintiffs also allege additional details about where the defendants formed their plan to refuse to 
deal with CHP and 167 RX Center. The affidavit from Pervez's father asserts that representatives of the defendants ""all meet 
together every month at an Italian restaurant on Francis Lewis Blvd. in Whitestone, Queens"" to ""set terms for the entire industry;"" 
""Business terms are set. Prices are set. Customer lists are divided."" (Pervez Aff. at 3.) Plaintiffs apparently contend that the 
concerted refusal to deal in this case was hatched at that Italian restaurant. (Pls.' Opp'n Mem. at 2.)"
1710,2," Unless otherwise specified, ""Bennett"" refers to plaintiff Martin Bennett, and ""Pervez"" refers to Raheel Pervez, the would-be 
purchaser of 167 RX Center. "
1711,3," Oral argument on the motion to dismiss took place on November 15, 2002. "
1713,4," Although it is not clear, plaintiffs may be claiming that H.D. Smith wanted the Bronx pharmacy for itself, and sought to purchase 
it through a ""front"" man. (Zeno Bennett Aff. at 6.)"
1713,5," Perhaps sensing this weakness, plaintiffs' counsel also advanced a domino theory: ""Today they will accommodate Mr. 
Tannenbaum [sic], tomorrow [they will] accommodate one of the other companies or one of their principals. That's what's going 
on here."" (Tr. at 23.) I hold here that only today's accommodation fails to make out an antitrust claim. Moreover, I express no 
view as to whether the conduct attributed to Tanenbaum in the affidavits submitted by plaintiffs violates laws other than the 
antitrust laws underlying the claims in this case. "

1724,4," In full, the Hobbs Act provision at issue HN6[
] states: Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in 
commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any 
person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section shall be fined under this title 
or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both."
1724,18, U.S.C. § 1951(a).
1724,5," In predicate acts 1, 7 and 9, plaintiffs do not claim that the acts constituted extortion or an attempt or conspiracy to commit 
extortion. Instead, they allege acts of physical violence against persons or property. First Am. Compl. PP 73, 82 & 84. Plaintiffs 
do not argue in this motion that the court should treat these three allegations as separate grounds for a RICO action. This court 
notes that HN7[
] stand-alone allegations of physical violence are not sufficient to state a claim under the Hobbs Act.  United States v. Franks, 511 F.2d 25, 31 (6th Cir.), cert. denied,  422 U.S. 1042, 45 L. Ed. 2d 693, 95 S. Ct. 2654, 95 S. Ct. 2656 
(1975) (finding that the statute does not ""proscribe[] all physical violence obstructing, delaying, or affecting commerce,"" but 
""physical violence designed to culminate in extortion""). Thus, this court must still determine if the alleged physical violence by 
defendants was in furtherance of a scheme to obtain property from the defendants. "
1725,6," Defendants also cite  United States v. Enmons, 410 U.S. 396, 35 L. Ed. 2d 379, 93 S. Ct. 1007 (1973), for the proposition that 
""to obtain"" requires both deprivation and acquisition of property. They quote a footnote in which the Court stated that ""extortion 
requires an intent 'to obtain that which in justice and equity the party is not entitled to receive.'""  Id. at 406 n.16 (quoting  People 
v. Cuddihy, 151 Misc. 318, 271 N.Y.S. 450, 456 (N.Y. Gen. Sess. 1934), aff'd,  243 A.D. 694, 277 N.Y.S. 960 (N.Y. App. Div 
1935)). The Court never addressed the definition of ""obtain"" in  Enmons. Instead, as is clear from the sentence preceding that 
quoted by defendants, the Court's decision concerned whether violence associated with union activities was a violation of the 
Hobbs Act.  Id. (""Judicial construction of the New York statute reinforces the conclusion that, however militant, union activities to 
obtain higher wages do not constitute extortion.""). "
1726,7," In an earlier Scheidler opinion, the Supreme Court held that the Hobbs Act does not require ""economic motivation"" for 
extortion.  National Org. for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U.S. 249, 262, 127 L. Ed. 2d 99, 114 S. Ct. 798 (1994). The court 
does not attempt to impose such a requirement in this action, but notes that it may be easier to meet the definition of ""obtaining"" 
set out by the Court in its 2002 Scheidler opinion if there is an economic purpose for attempted control of an intangible property 
right."
1726,8," In their reply brief, defendants cite Enmons to argue for the first time that there was no extortion since the purpose of their 
""strike"" was lawful. This argument was not raised in defendants' motion and thus plaintiffs have not had an opportunity to 
respond. Defendants' argument, however, fails on its face. In Enmons, the Court held that violence accompanying a lawful strike 
was not extortion within the Hobbs Act because it was not ""wrongful.""  410 U.S. at 401. The Court reasoned that Congress must 
have intended the Hobbs Act to apply ""to those instances where the obtaining of the property would itself be 'wrongful' because 
the extortionist has no lawful claim to the property.""  Enmons, 410 U.S. at 400. In this action, however, the property at issue is 
not the price of crab, but plaintiffs' right to harvest crab during the crab season. Defendants' attempts to obtain that property, if 
proved, would be wrongful since they have no legal interest in the property. "
1727,9," HN12[
] Sales below cost may constitute unfair business practices under the UCA even if the seller did not act with the 
purpose of destroying competition.  Cel-Tech Communications, Inc., 20 Cal. 4th at 187. A sale below cost is an unfair business 
practice if it ""threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its 
effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.""  Id."
1727,10," Counterdefendants also argue that they could not have intended to injure competition because they sold crab during the strike 
at a higher price than the one HMBFMA ultimately negotiated. This argument is not on point; the relevant inquiry is whether the 
vendor sold the item below the cost to him with an intent to injure competition."
1727,11," Contrary to counterdefendants' argument, HN15[
] an unlawful business practice (as opposed to an unfair business practice) 
need not significantly threaten or harm competition. See  Cel-Tech Communications, Inc., 20 Cal. 4th at 187 n.12 (""This case 
involves an action by a competitor alleging anticompetitive practices. Our discussion and this test are limited to that context. 
Nothing we say relates to actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law 
such as … 'unlawful' business practices."") "
1728,12," To the extent HMBFMA alleges that counterdefendants' crab fishing without a valid permit was an unlawful business practice, 
this is not a separate cognizable claim. Section 8280.1 HN16[
] does not prohibit fishing for crab with a vessel that has a trawl 
net. The unlawful business practice at issue is procuring a permit for a vessel that at the time has a trawl net, in violation of 
section 8280.1. HMBFMA also mentions other sections of the Fish and Game Code in its papers, but violations of these 
sections were not alleged in its counterclaims."
1728,13," The court notes that the California Department of Fish and Game records do not demonstrate that counterdefendants had a 
vessel equipped with a trawl net at the time they applied for a permit or renewed their permit. The records also do not show that 
the permit was transferred from Dooley to Caitlin Ann. In assailing these records because they lack authentication, HMBFMA 
misunderstands its burden on a summary judgment motion. HMBFMA must do more than attack counterdefendants' evidence; it 
must affirmatively put forth facts to show a genuine issue for trial. "

1742,3," We point out to counsel and to the Bar that TEX. R. APP. P. 9.4(i) specifically provides that the use of footnotes as a method of

of the proper length), Coke's counsel added sixty footnotes totaling approximately 320 lines of type. Most of those ""footnotes"" 
are actually additional argument and in some instances appear to be footnoted points of error. They will not be considered as 
such nor addressed. We also point out that 320 additional lines of type, using a smaller typeface than the body of the brief, is the 
equivalent of adding-at the very least-an additional sixteen pages to an already overly lengthy brief. Such practice will not be 
condoned by this Court in the future. "

finding, we must consider all of the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the party in whose favor the verdict has

] Once a monopoly or attempted monopoly is established, the Act permits recovery of damages as well as injunctive 
relief. Injunctive relief is available to a plaintiff if a violation of the Act threatens it with injury. Coke complains about the injunctive 
relief in a later point of error. "
1751,13, That account is Wal-mart.
1751,14," Coke has relied in part on Burroughs Wellcome for its argument that Williams' testimony is so unsupported as to be without 
any possible weight. In that case, the court held that a doctor's testimony was no evidence that Polysporin spray caused Crye to 
sustain a frostbite injury. ""When an expert's opinion is based on assumed facts that vary materially from the actual, undisputed 
facts, the opinion is without probative value and cannot support a verdict or judgment."" Burroughs Wellcome citing Schaefer v. 
Tex. Employers' Ins. Ass'n, 612 S.W.2d 199, 202-05, 24 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 163 (Tex. 1980) (reviewing substance of medical 
expert's testimony and holding testimony constituted no evidence of causation, as it was based on assumptions, possibility, 
speculation, and surmise). Burroughs Wellcome Co. v. Crye, 907 S.W.2d 497, 499-500, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 848 (Tex. 1995). 
That differs from this situation because this expert linked his damages report to these particular facts, but used his expertise to 
extrapolate from the information available. Testimony of medical causation with no underlying foundation is a situation that 
cannot be applied to the case at hand."
1751,15," The other major model is the ""yardstick"" method (comparable businesses) to reach other conclusions. Those methods are 
described as the two most widely accepted methods for measuring damages in antitrust actions. See Park v. El Paso Bd. of

1752,16," Coke also complains because the expert did not specify which of its marketing tactics caused damages and because he did 
not specify the dollar amount of damages caused by each clause of the contract. Such specific delineation is not required. "
1753,17," Tex. Indus. points out that contribution was not available because Congress had not provided for contribution in antitrust 
actions and that application of such theories to damage recoveries was a matter for Congress to decide. Tex. Indus., Inc. v. 
Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 68 L. Ed. 2d 500, 101 S. Ct. 2061 (1981). Neither Congress nor the Texas Legislature

1768,11," Brooke Group's analysis spoke also in terms of a ""reasonable prospect"" of recoupment,  Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 210, 
because the plaintiff in that case alleged ""primary-line"" price discrimination under the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-
Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a) (2000). The Court noted that the Robinson-Patman Act requires the lesser ""reasonable 
possibility"" standard as compared to the Sherman Act's ""dangerous probability"" standard.  Id. at 222. However, the Court made 
it clear that the primary-line competitive injury being alleged in that case is of the same general character as the injury suffered 
by predatory pricing schemes under Section 2 of the Sherman Act and that the two-part analysis established in the case applies 
equally under both Acts.  Id. at 221-22."
1768,12," In its certification memo, the court of appeals wrote that ""it is Brooke Group's addition of the 'recoupment' element of a 
predatory pricing claim that renders it nearly impossible to succeed on a predatory pricing claim."" However, the concept of 
recoupment was discussed long before Brooke Group. For instance, in  Northeast Telephone Co. v. American Telephone & 
Telegraph Co., 651 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1981), Circuit Judge Irving R. Kaufman wrote: For unremunerative pricing to make economic sense, the predator must be assured that he will be able to recoup his short 
term losses in the future. But because a dollar now is worth more than a dollar later (because of both inflation and the time 
value of money), he must be reasonably certain that once his prey has fallen, he will be able to reap supranormal returns. Id. at 89 (emphasis added). In  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, 106 S. 
Ct. 1348 (1986), Justice Powell wrote: ""The forgone profits may be considered an investment in the future. For the investment to 
be rational, the [predator] must have a reasonable expectation of recovering, in the form of later monopoly profits, more than the 
losses suffered.""  Id. at 588-89 (emphasis added). "
1769,13," There is substantial evidence that predatory pricing claims in federal courts had severe difficulty prevailing even before Brooke 
Group was decided. See generally Frank H. Easterbrook, Predatory Strategies and Counterstrategies,  48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 263, 
314 (1981)."
1769,14," Even the source that Conley offers to show the difficulty of surviving summary judgment in predatory pricing cases post-
Brooke Group cites three cases where federal courts refused to grant a defendant's motion for summary disposition of a 
predatory pricing claim. Patrick Bolton et al., Predatory Pricing: Strategic Theory and Legal Policy,  88 Geo. L.J. 2239, 2260 
n.124 (2000) (citing  Multistate Legal Studies, Inc. v. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal & Prof'l Publ'ns, 63 F.3d 1540 (10th Cir. 
1995);  Aventura Cable Corp. v. Rifkin/Narragansett S. Fla. CATV Ltd. P'ship, 941 F. Supp. 1189 (S.D. Fla. 1996);  
Servicetrends, Inc. v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 870 F. Supp. 1042 (N.D. Ga. 1994)). These cases were later settled out of court, 
precluding their chance to succeed on the merits. See Bolton et al., supra, at 2259 & n.118. "
1770,15," Conley's argument questioning the merit of requiring recoupment levels sufficient to compensate the amounts spent on 
predation is partially of a chicken-and-egg/cause-versus-effect variety. Do predatory pricing claims rarely succeed because the 
Brooke Group standard is too high and omits from its purview true instances of predatory pricing? Or, does Brooke Group's 
standard correctly protect against false claims and the reason that these claims fail is because they do not actually allege 
conduct that is against the interests of competitive markets? At best, Conley's analysis dismissively entertains the second 
possibility."

1771,17," Commentators who recognize (or even recommend) Conley's market structure argument generally use market structure as a 
shield, not a sword, in predatory pricing litigation. It filters out unmeritorious claims and then traditional predatory pricing analysis 
is applied to those defendants that pass the structural prerequisites. See Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law 217 (2d ed. 2001);

wants. . . . An exclusive seller will raise prices only to the point where the higher price is not more than offset by a decrease in 
quantity demanded. The shape of the demand curve constrains the behavior of all sellers, even monopolists.""); see also 
Hovenkamp, supra, § 1.2a at 13 (""A monopolist's market power is a function of the elasticity of demand for its product.""); 
Easterbrook, supra, at 302-03 (explaining that while elasticities of demand are difficult to measure, they are essential to 
determining the social costs of a monopoly)."

Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, 3 Antitrust Law (2d ed. 2002). Given Conley's extensive reliance on the Areeda and

that Professor Areeda was the counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner/non-prevailing party before the United States "

LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 168 (3d Cir. 2003) (limiting Brooke Group to only claims of predatory pricing);  Chroma

price discrimination cases)."
1772,21," In the federal system, trial courts have a significant ""gatekeeper"" function in keeping from the jury expert testimony that is 
deemed unreliable. See  Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993)

P21, 238 Wis. 2d 477, 617 N.W.2d 881, aff'd,  2001 WI 109, 245 Wis. 2d 772, 629 N.W.2d 727. In Wisconsin, ""Once the 
relevancy of the evidence is established and the witness is qualified as an expert, the reliability of the evidence is a weight and 
credibility issue for the fact finder and any reliability challenges must be made through cross-examination or by other means of 
impeachment.""  State v. Peters, 192 Wis. 2d 674, 690, 534 N.W.2d 867 (Ct. App. 1995); see also  State v. Walstad, 119 Wis. 2d 
483, 516, 518-19, 351 N.W.2d 469 (1984). "
1773,22," Neither the Court in Brooke Group nor other federal courts have definitively taken a position on which various cost measures 
are an ""appropriate measure,"" although many federal circuits have regarded marginal cost and average variable cost as the 
most appropriate. See generally  Multistate Legal Studies, 63 F.3d at 1549 n.5. Whatever standard is used, ""the problem of 
measurement is apt to be acute."" Posner, supra, at 215. We do not address this issue because, on the basis of the Journal's 
summary judgment motion, we assume that Gollop's measure of cost was appropriate. "
1774,23," To be sure, these free newspapers are rarely, if ever, daily newspapers, and rarely, if ever, are distributed by means of home 
delivery. Moreover, the relevant market in this action is that of paid daily newspapers in Waukesha County. Therefore, the 
existence of free weekly newspapers inside or outside of Waukesha County does not impact the legal analysis of predatory 
pricing."
1774,24," In predatory pricing cases, disputes over below-cost pricing usually focus on the difficulties in calculating an appropriate 
measure of cost. Volumes of scholarship have been written regarding how a firm's costs during predation should be measured, 
and courts have wrestled over this matter. See generally Hovenkamp, supra, § 8.2-8.3 at 337-45. The ""price"" component from 
which any measure of cost is compared is frequently easier to observe: What did the firm selling its units charge to whomever 
receives those units? While some ancillary revenue is far too contingent, speculative, and otherwise improper to attribute to any 
sale, revenues from newspaper sales and distribution cannot be confined simply to the price charged to subscribers or other 
purchasers of the product."
1774,25," Conley also suggests, based on a Journal Sentinel Circulation Department 2000 Marketing Plan that shows a net loss based 
on the conversion program discounts, that the Journal shows at least a $ 0.35 loss per daily newspapers supplied to a "
1775,," subscriber under the program. However, this document does not summarize all costs and revenues related to the conversion 
program nor does it suggest a cost analysis beyond that experienced only by the newspaper's circulation department."
1775,26," Despite Gollop's omissions in this matter, at both his deposition and in his report Gollop proclaimed that newspapers increase 
circulation precisely to increase advertising revenues, that circulation and advertising sales are highly correlated, and that 
advertisers will pay higher advertising rates as a newspaper's circulation increases."
1775,27," Perhaps the most fundamental hurdle facing Conley's evidence of a dangerous probability of recoupment is its failure to 
establish below-cost pricing. Without a complete sense of the investment that the Journal has sunk into the Sunday-daily 
conversion program, it is impossible to know its relative needs for recoupment. "
1776,28," For an informative discussion of the limitations facing a newspaper operating as a monopolist in a market with competing 
sources of news and advertising media, see  Reilly v. Hearst Corp., 107 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1201 (N.D. Cal. 2000)."
1776,29," We accept Dr. Gollop's view that the barriers to entry in the local newspaper market are significant due to high fixed costs and 
the necessity of sustaining losses for a long period of time while the newspaper attempts to penetrate embedded subscriber and 
advertiser loyalty in incumbent papers."
1776,30," HN17[

the filed rate doctrine to rates filed with the Federal Power Commission (FERC's predecessor). See id. 341 U.S. 246, 251-52, 71 
S. Ct. at 695, 95 L. Ed. 912. The Court held that: HN8[
] the right to a reasonable rate is the right to the rate which the Commission files or fixes, and that, except for review 
of the Commission's orders, the courts can assume no right to a different one on the ground that, in its opinion, it is the only 
or the more reasonable one. Id. "
1788,14," To highlight this point, the court noted that the plaintiffs did not ask for a rebate from rates paid, as the plaintiff had in Keogh. 
Id. at 1122. Rather, the plaintiffs sought relief from the anti-competitive effect of the add-on Essential customers were forced to 
purchase."

1801,1," Wellbutrin SR and Zyban have the same active ingredient, bupropion hydrochloride. (Consolidated Class Action Complaint 
(""Complaint"") PP 2-3.) However, although both Wellbutrin SR and Zyban have the same chemical composition and are covered 
by the same patent, they are marketed for different treatments - antidepression and smoking cessation, respectively. (Complaint 
P 2.) Accordingly, manufacturers seeking to sell a sustained release formula of bupropion hydrochloride must file Abbreviated 
New Drug Applications with the FDA requesting approval to sell generic versions of Wellbutrin SR & Zyban. (Complaint P 2.) "
1802,2," In addition to the facts alleged in the Complaint, Defendants ask the Court to take judicial notice of a published report of a 
federal administrative agency (the FDA), posted on the official FDA website, which makes clear that Andrx, the first generic drug 
manufacturer to file an ANDA for Wellbutrin SR, has not yet received FDA approval. See FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and 
Research Listing of New & Generic Drug Approvals, <http://www.fda.gov/cder/approval/b.htm>. HN3[
] Generally, when deciding a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court may look only to the facts alleged in the complaint and its attachments. Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O'Brien & Frankel, 20 F.3d 1250, 1261 (3d Cir. 1994). 
However, matters of public record may also be considered without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary 
judgment. Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993). Courts have defined a 
public record to include published reports of administrative bodies. See id. at 1197. The fact that an agency report is ""published"" 
on the world wide web does not affect the Court's ability to take judicial notice of the contents of that report. See McLaughlin v. 
Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17505, 2000 WL 1793071, at *1 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (taking judicial notice of

In re Agribiotech Sec. Litig., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5643, at *4-5 (D. Nev. 2000) (taking judicial notice of official government 
documents available on the world wide web). Accordingly, the Court will take judicial notice of the FDA's Center for Drug 
Evaluation and Research Listing of New & Generic Drug Approvals 1998 - 2003 and its listing of bupropion hydrochloride which 
is available at <http://www.fda.gov/cder/approval/b.htm>."
1802,3, An excipient is an inert ingredient or substance added to a prescription to give the desired consistency or form.
1802,4," Andrx submitted its ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Wellbutrin SR in August of 1999.

exclusivity period. "
1803,5," Plaintiffs state that Defendants' patent lawsuits were frivolous because the patent specifications and patent prosecution history 
make clear that the '798 Patent is a narrow patent claiming a specific form of extended release tablet of bupropion which 
incorporates the high viscosity, high polymer weight form of the excipient HPMC as a control release agent. (Complaint at P 68.) 
For the purposes of this Motion, Defendants concede that the five Patent lawsuits were frivolous. (Oral Argument Transcript at 
20-21, 100.)"
1803,6, See note 2 supra.
1803,7," Section 16 of the Clayton Act (""Section 16"") states that HN7[
] a person ""threatened [with] loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws"" can seek injunctive relief. The Clayton Act includes the Sherman Act as one of the ""antitrust laws"". To allege 
the offense of actual monopoly under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must claim: ""(1) the possession of monopoly 
power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or 
development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" See United States v. Grinnell 
Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778, 86 S. Ct. 1698 (1966). "
1804,8," Defendants argue that any obstacles imposed by these patent lawsuits cannot be considered ""burdensome"" as a matter of law 
if the suits themselves were objectively baseless. This Court disagrees because all litigation, particularly complex federal 
litigation involving patent issues, imposes some burden on the parties involved regardless of the merits of the claims. "
1815,1," Although the government does not explicitly argue this, I construe their position to be based on the phenomenon that 
bureaucratic rewards generally flow to those who meet their stated goals and rarely flow to those who strive for places beyond 
the stated goals and fail to reach them. "
1816,2," I do not regard some of the arguments as helpful to the parties. It is true that the wider, high speed coaters are largely in the 
hands of Avery, MACtac and Raflatac, but I am not convinced that narrower and lower-speed coaters cannot compete. In some 
respects the older coaters are easier to operate, and comparative costs of operating the machinery (i.e., labor costs and power 
requirements which may differ among the various competitors), have not been provided to me. I give no weight to the fact that 
some competitors have bigger coaters except to infer that the purchase of newer coaters by the parties and by Avery evince 
their desire--whether in collusion or honestly--to acquire more market share. But this proposition is not in dispute. "
1818,3," A short time ago Bemis could have sold MACtac for more than twice the amount it now seeks but did not do so. Also, it has 
acquired equipment and built plants, so I am inclined to believe Bemis sought to make a go of MACtac and came to the 
conclusion that it was not worth its while to do so. "
1820,4," In this opinion I have, in part, scrambled conclusions of law and findings of fact. HN7[
] While this is generally discouraged, I 
am permitted to do so, as long as the findings are adequate. See Koehler v. United States, 200 F.2d 588. 592 (7th Cir. 1953). 
Ordinarily, I would not do this, but there is a significant degree of urgency in the need of the parties for a decision, and I thought 
it prudent to issue my ruling without parsing out findings from conclusions. "
1827,1," Division I schools are typically large colleges or universities. By NCAA rules, Division I teams must play a large percentage of 
games against other Division I schools. Division I schools may offer athletic scholarships and are recognized as sponsoring the 
most competitive level of college athletics. There are currently 330 teams in Division I. Although this number varies from year to 
year as some teams drop out of Division I and other teams are added, the variance has never been more than 1/2 of 1% of the 
current number. "
1828,2," Many Division I basketball teams play in conferences, such as the Big 10, the Big 12, the Big East, the Pac 10, the Southeast 
Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference. Games played in intra-conference championships or in the NCAA championship 
do not count as games played for purposes of the limitation on games played each year, as established by the NCAA."
1828,3," For the reasons explained in the Court's previous Opinion and Order, this part of the legislation will not be considered by the 
Court in assessing the effects of the Two in Four Rule on competition in the relevant market. As will be seen infra, however, the 
result in this case would remain unchanged, even if this unchallenged part of Proposition 98-92 were included in the analysis."
1828,4," In 1996, the NCAA began the process of ""certifying"" exempt events by way of a Certified Events Subcommittee. "
1829,5," Giles testified about the efforts he has made and continues to make to schedule teams to participate in his events. Giles places 
numerous calls and sends electronic mail (e-mail) to coaches and team schedulers in order to fill all available tournament slots. 
In particular, from June 1, 2001 to March 18, 2002, Giles sent 1,101 e-mails and made 2,020 calls regarding scheduling. In 
addition, Giles made thousands of calls to potential tournament sponsors. (Pl. Exhibit 175). Giles testified that he persisted in these efforts during the pendency of the Court's ruling last year. Giles further testified that he 
continues to schedule teams for future events on the assumption that the Two in Four Rule remains in effect. In view of this 
unrebutted testimony, the Court rejects Defendant's assertion that the Plaintiffs' events were unsuccessful this past season due 
to lack of effort on Plaintiffs' part."
1829,6," The Court observes that in 2001 Giles promoted 4 events; but in 1998 and 1999 he only promoted 1, in 2000 he promoted 2 
and in 2002 he promoted 2."
1829,7," On May 13, 2003, the NCAA Certified Events Subcommittee notified the University of Puerto Rico that the San Juan Shootout 
was being denied certification due to the lack of an executed contract with a participating institution as well as the lack of a 
manager/promoter contract. The deadline for reconsideration of the decision was June 15, 2003. (Pl. Exhibit 266). The Court "
1830,," notes that American University in Puerto Rico withdrew from the NCAA and was therefore unable to serve as a host school 
under NCAA rules."
1830,8," Spencer testified that it is not unusual, however, for teams to withdraw from events even after a contract for participation has 
been executed. Thus, according to the Plaintiffs, the existence of a contract does not necessarily guarantee team participation. "
1831,9," The Court notes that in 2001 Potts promoted four events, the most events his company ever sponsored. In 1996, he promoted 
only 1 event, in 1997, 2 events; in 1998, 1 event; in 1999, no events because Dorna was the promoter; in 2000, 2 events; and in 
2001, 4 events."
1831,10," Dr. Tollison begins this position in the upcoming academic year. He was formerly employed as a Professor of Economics at 
the University of Mississippi."
1831,11," Tollison relies on the views of coaches, athletic directors, NCAA officials, conference officials and commentators in support of 
this definition."
1831,12," School-scheduled events are games which a team is not required to play. Teams are required to play a certain number of 
games within the teams' conference, the conference tournament, or the NCAA tournament. School-scheduled games, as the 
term connotes, are selected by the school's scheduling coach. "
1832,13," Both experts looked to a net figure since teams which one year played in, for example, a two game tournament, had one game 
counted toward the twenty-eight game cap. If the team did not play in any tournament games the next year, it would be able to 
schedule one additional game to make up for the fact that the previous year's tournament had counted as one game. The gross 
number of exempt games fell by 107 from 2001-2002 to 2002-2003."
1832,14," A ""power conference"" team refers to a team that is a member of one of the Big 6 conferences. The Big 6 consists of the 
Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big 12, the Big East, the Big Ten, the Pac 10 and the South East Conference."
1832,15," In contrast, Guth uses an ""averaging"" method to assess the effect of the Two in Four Rule. Guth testified that he would use a 
three year average of the number of games before the Two in Four Rule and compare that with number of games after the rule 
to assess the effect of the Rule. This method derives from Guth's view that the number of certified events in 2000-01 was 
unnatural because of the impending unknown effects of the Two in Four Rule. The Court rejects Guth's view on the appropriate 
baseline for measuring the effects of the Two in Four Rule since Guth provided no supporting data as to this theory. The Court 
agrees with Tollison that the logical baseline is the 2000-01 season because that is the year in which all teams were eligible to 
participate in certified events. "
1837,16," The per se approach is applied ""when 'the practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to 
restrict competition and decrease output.'""  NCAA v. Board of Regents, 468 U.S. 85, 100, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70, 104 S. Ct. 2948 
(1984), quoting  Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U.S. 1, 19-20, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1, 99 S. Ct. 1551 
(1979). The types of restraints on trade that give rise to this analysis include price fixing, horizontal output restraints and market-
allocation agreements.  Continental Airlines, Inc. v. United Airlines, 277 F.3d 499, 509 (4th Cir. 2002). The Supreme Court has 
cautioned against expanding this category.  Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 50, 53 L. Ed. 2d 568, 97 S. 
Ct. 2549 (1977). "
1840,17," A ""superstation"" was defined by the NBA as ""any commercial over-the-air television station whose broadcast signal is received 
outside of the local Designated Market Area (""DMA""), as defined by A.C. Nielsen Co., by more than 5% of the total number of 
cable subscribers in the United States as reported by A.C. Nielsen ….""  Chicago Professional Sports Limited Partnership v. 
NBA, 754 F. Supp. 1336, 1345 (N.D. Ill. 1991). Further, at the time of the decision, there were three superstations in the United 
States: WGN in Chicago, WTBS in Atlanta and WWOR in New York. All stations televised NBA games and WGN reached 31% 
of the nation's television households.  Id. at 1345-46, 1348."
1840,18," The Court notes that Plaintiffs rely on this case in their post-hearing brief. On July 14, 2003, Defendant filed a Motion Strike 
Plaintiffs' reliance on the case as inappropriate in light of the alleged ""subsequent reversal and vacation of the injunction by the 
Seventh Circuit in  Chicago Professional Sports, Ltd. v. National Basketball Association, 95 F.3d 593 (7th Cir. 1996)."" The 
NCAA's characterization of the subsequent history of the district court's underlying decision is inaccurate. The 1991 decision by 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit in  Chicago Professional 
Sports, Ltd. v. NBA, 961 F.2d 667 (7th Cir. 1992). The Seventh Circuit denied a rehearing en banc in June 1992. Thus, pursuant 
to the decisions, the Chicago Bulls and the WGN Superstation were permitted to broadcast 25 games per year. The district court 
in Illinois later considered whether the number could be increased to 30 games per year and whether the NBA could impose a 
""tax"" on the games' broadcast to a national audience. The district court held that a thirty game allowance was permissible but 
found the NBA's tax excessive.  Chicago Professional Sports. Ltd. v. NBA, 874 F. Supp. 844 (N.D. Ill. 1995). This decision was 
vacated by the Seventh Circuit and the case was remanded for further proceedings,  Chicago Professional Sports, Ltd. v. 
National Basketball Association, 95 F.3d 593 (7th Cir. 1996). Thus, it is wholly inaccurate to characterize the holding of the 
district court in 1991 as being reversed and vacated. The Defendant's Motion to Strike (Doc. # 139) is DENIED. "
1849,1," The petitioner appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court 
pursuant to General Statutes § 51-199 (c) and Practice Book § 65-1."
1849,2," HN1[
] Although a discovery order ordinarily is not immediately appealable because it does not constitute a final judgment; 
see Melia v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 202 Conn. 252, 255, 520 A.2d 605 (1987); the present appeal is distinguishable because the 
proceedings giving rise to it were brought pursuant to the provisions of the Connecticut Antitrust Act (act); General Statutes § 35-
24 et seq.; which authorize the attorney general to conduct investigations and seek discovery orders from the trial court when 
violations of the act merely are suspected and without the institution of an action alleging a violation of the act. See Lieberman v. 
Reliable Refuse Co., 212 Conn. 661, 663-64, 563 A.2d 1013 (1989); In re Application of Ajello v. Moffie, 179 Conn. 324, 326, 
426 A.2d 295 (1979). In this case, Kimber has not yet been, and may never be, named as a defendant in any litigation involving 
violations of the act."
1849,3," The e-mail came to the petitioner's attention when the respondents inadvertently submitted it to him along with five other 
uncontested documents. The parties set aside the issue of whether the inadvertent disclosure waived the attorney-client 
privilege until after the trial court had determined whether the privilege otherwise applied. Ultimately, the trial court, Freed, J., 
determined that the inadvertent disclosure did not result in a waiver of the privilege. That ruling is not at issue in this appeal. "
1850,4," Although Goldman appeared on behalf of the respondents at the September 10, 2001 hearing, Peter L. Costas, Kimber's local 
counsel, submitted to the trial court the memorandum of law in opposition to the petitioner's motion for the consent order. "
1851,5," The trial court's specific findings of facts that the petitioner contends arose from representations by Goldman and Peter L. 
Costas; see footnote 4 of this opinion; include, inter alia: (1) since 1999, Goldman had represented Kimber as outside general 
counsel on all significant matters, including litigation; (2) since 1999, Goldman had represented Edelman and Van Brunt; and (3) 
prior to March 20, 2000, the date Van Brunt sent the e-mail, Edelman specifically had engaged Goldman to represent Kimber in 
connection with anticipated firearms litigation. Under the facts of this case, we need not consider whether the trial court did rely on factual representations by Kimber's counsel 
when reaching its legal conclusions, because we conclude that there was sufficient evidence properly before the court from 
which the court reasonably could have reached its conclusions. We are mindful, however, because of the nature of the 
representations and the particular context in which these facts were put before the court, that, under these circumstances, the 
court reasonably might have concluded that such facts were reliable. At the hearing on this matter, the trial court engaged in a 
lengthy colloquy with both the petitioner and Goldman. Although neither the petitioner nor Goldman was under oath, and 
therefore their representations to the trial court did not comprise testimonial evidence; see Cologne v. Westfarms Associates, 
197 Conn. 141, 152-53, 496 A.2d 476 (1985); both, as attorneys and officers of the court, are obligated to make truthful 
representations. Rules of Professional Conduct 3.3. Importantly, everything that Goldman recounted to the trial court was within 
his own specific knowledge; he was not making representations concerning the acts of third parties. See id., 153 
(representations made by plaintiff's counsel at contempt hearing regarding actions of defendants that counsel did not witness do 
not constitute evidence). We note further that the trial court's findings of fact are supported by affidavits, dated October 18, 2001, submitted by the 
respondents after the hearing on the privilege issue, in support of their motion for a protective order on the inadvertent disclosure 
issue. Consequently, this evidence was put into the record before the trial court, Bryant, J., issued its memorandum of decision 
on the present issue on January 30, 2002. There were no affidavits in opposition submitted by the petitioner. Therefore, there is 
no doubt that Goldman in fact had been retained by the respondents since 1999, and that Goldman actively was involved in 
representing Kimber and Kimber's management team, both in their individual and corporate capacities, in matters resulting from 
the petitioner's investigation. "
1852,6," Although we conclude in the present case that the trial court reasonably could have inferred, principally from the contested 
document itself, that the elements necessary to establish the attorney-client privilege were satisfied, in view of the deferential 
review that we accord the trial court's conclusions on such matters, we caution that parties would be well-advised in the future to 
provide supplemental evidence in support of the required elements."
1852,7," We note that, in Olson v. Accessory Controls & Equipment Corp., supra, 254 Conn. 147, a case in which the issue of attorney-
client privilege also arose in a corporate context, we did not apply Shew's four part test because that case involved a 
determination of whether the attorney-client privilege applied to a factual report compiled by an outside third party at the request 
of a corporation. Therefore, the analysis in that case more closely followed our line of cases that address whether the attorney-
client privilege protects communications involving third parties. Id., 157-58; see Pagano v. Ippoliti, 245 Conn. 640, 649-50, 716 
A.2d 848 (1998); State v. Cascone, 195 Conn. 183, 186-87, 487 A.2d 186 (1985); State v. Toste, 178 Conn. 626, 628, 424 A.2d 
293 (1979); Goddard v. Gardner, 28 Conn. 172, 175 (1859). "
1853,8," At oral argument, the petitioner raised for the first time to this court a claim that the respondents did not introduce evidence to 
establish that all of the e-mail recipients, and in particular, Busse, Kimber's national sales manager, were members of the 
""control group."" We are mindful that some other jurisdictions have engrafted an additional layer to their inquiry, beyond the 
general test that this court set forth in Shew, to identify which employees constitute the ""corporate client"" for purposes of 
invoking attorney-client privilege--the so-called ""control group"" test, which focuses on the status of the employee within the 
corporate hierarchy, being just one of those tests. See Consolidated Coal Co. v. Bucyrus-Erie Co., 89 Ill. 2d 103, 112-17, 432 
N.E.2d 250, 59 Ill. Dec. 666 (1982) (adopting control group test but setting forth and explaining numerous alternative 
approaches). We note, however, that HN8[
] we generally do not address a claim raised in oral argument that has not been 
addressed in the party's brief. City Recycling, Inc. v. State, 257 Conn. 429, 455, 778 A.2d 77 (2001); Shew v. Freedom of 
Information Commission, supra, 245 Conn. 166 n.20. Additionally, the petitioner has not presented the court with a persuasive 
rationale for departing from the Shew test. Accordingly, we decline the petitioner's invitation and reserve for another day the 
question of whether to engraft a limitation as to which particular employees constitute the corporate client. "
1854,9," The petitioner contends that the fact that other Kimber employees who are not lawyers also were recipients of the e-mail 
indicates that the e-mail was not intended to be confidential. The petitioner, however, offers no legal support for this proposition, 
and we are not aware of any. Accordingly, we reject this contention. "
1855,10," The petitioner cites North Carolina Electric Membership Corp. v. Carolina Power & Light Co., 110 F.R.D. 511 (M.D.N.C. 
1986), as being directly on point with the present case. In that case, the trial court, applying the federal common law, concluded 
that several documents not marked ""confidential"" that were in the nature of updates on business developments and that 
contained no specific requests for legal advice were not protected under attorney-client privilege. Id., 516-17. The petitioner, in 
effect, is asking us to conclude as a matter of law that the trial court in this case was required to make this same determination. 
As we noted previously, however, we apply a deferential standard when reviewing a trial court's conclusion regarding discovery 
orders, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining its conclusion. "
1856,11," The petitioner contends that the trial court ""inappropriately merged"" the two distinct inquiries of whether Van Brunt sent the e- 
mail for the purpose of seeking legal advice, which is relevant to the question of whether the privilege applies in the first place, 
and whether he sent the e-mail in furtherance of a crime, which is relevant to the question of whether the e-mail must be 
disclosed under the exception. Therefore, the petitioner contends that the trial court improperly found that, because Van Brunt 
had sent the e-mail for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, he necessarily could not have sent it in furtherance of a crime. We 
disagree with the petitioner's interpretation of the basis for the trial court's determination. Although the trial court subsumed its 
analysis of whether the e-mail was sent in furtherance of a crime within its discussion of the third prong of the privilege test, it 
separately addressed the crime-fraud exception and explained why it was inapplicable. Specifically, the court stated that, ""the 
Van Brunt e-mail contains no statement suggesting [an] intent to break the law. [It] is merely a report of what has happened and 
a prediction that some unidentified things may happen in the future and is not a communication made in furtherance of a crime."" 
Accordingly, we reject the petitioner's contention. "
1864,1," Division I schools are typically large colleges or universities. By NCAA rules, Division I teams must play a large percentage of 
games against other Division I schools. Division I schools may offer athletic scholarships and are recognized as sponsoring the 
most competitive level of college athletics. There are currently 330 teams in Division I. Although this number varies from year to 
year as some teams drop out of Division I and other teams are added, the variance has never been more than 1/2 of 1% of the 
current number."
1864,2," Many Division I basketball teams play in conferences, such as the Big 10, the Big 12, the Big East, the Pac 10, the Southeast 
Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference. Games played in intra-conference championships or in the NCAA championship 
do not count as games played for purposes of the limitation on games played each year, as established by the NCAA. "
1865,3," For the reasons explained in the Court's previous Opinion and Order, this part of the legislation will not be considered by the 
Court in assessing the effects of the Two in Four Rule on competition in the relevant market. As will be seen infra, however, the 
result in this case would remain unchanged, even if this unchallenged part of Proposition 98-92 were included in the analysis."
1865,4," In 1996, the NCAA began the process of ""certifying"" exempt events by way of a Certified Events Subcommittee. "
1866,5," Giles testified about the efforts he has made and continues to make to schedule teams to participate in his events. Giles places 
numerous calls and sends electronic mail (e-mail) to coaches and team schedulers in order to fill all available tournament slots. 
In particular, from June 1, 2001 to March 18, 2002, Giles sent 1,101 e-mails and made 2,020 calls regarding scheduling. In 
addition, Giles made thousands of calls to potential tournament sponsors. (Pl. Exhibit 175). Giles testified that he persisted in these efforts during the pendency of the Court's ruling last year. Giles further testified that he 
continues to schedule teams for future events on the assumption that the Two in Four Rule remains in effect. In view of this 
unrebutted testimony, the Court rejects Defendant's assertion that the Plaintiffs' events were unsuccessful this past season due 
to lack of effort on Plaintiffs' part."
1866,6," The Court observes that in 2001 Giles promoted 4 events; but in 1998 and 1999 he only promoted 1, in 2000 he promoted 2 
and in 2002 he promoted 2."
1866,7," On May 13, 2003, the NCAA Certified Events Subcommittee notified the University of Puerto Rico that the San Juan Shootout 
was being denied certification due to the lack of an executed contract with a participating institution as well as the lack of a 
manager/promoter contract. The deadline for reconsideration of the decision was June 15, 2003. (Pl. Exhibit 266). The Court 
notes that American University in Puerto Rico withdrew from the NCAA and was therefore unable to serve as a host school 
under NCAA rules. "
1867,8," Spencer testified that it is not unusual, however, for teams to withdraw from events even after a contract for participation has 
been executed. Thus, according to the Plaintiffs, the existence of a contract does not necessarily guarantee team participation. "
1868,9," The Court notes that in 2001 Potts promoted four events, the most events his company ever sponsored. In 1996, he promoted 
only 1 event; in 1997, 2 events; in 1998, 1 event; in 1999, no events because Dorna was the promoter; in 2000, 2 events; and in 
2001, 4 events."
1868,10," Dr. Tollison begins this position in the upcoming academic year. He was formerly employed as a Professor of Economics at 
the University of Mississippi."
1868,11," Tollison relies on the views of coaches, athletic directors, NCAA officials, conference officials and commentators in support of 
this definition."
1868,12," School-scheduled events are games which a team is not required to play. Teams are required to play a certain number of 
games within the teams' conference, the conference tournament, or the NCAA tournament. School-scheduled games, as the 
term connotes, are selected by the school's scheduling coach."
1868,13," Both experts looked to a net figure since teams which one year played in, for example, a two game tournament, had one game 
counted toward the twenty-eight game cap. If the team did not play in any tournament games the next year, it would be able to "
1869,," schedule one additional game to make up for the fact that the previous year's tournament had counted as one game. The gross 
number of exempt games fell by 107 from 2001-2002 to 2002-2003."
1869,14," A ""power conference"" team refers to a team that is a member of one of the Big 6 conferences. The Big 6 consists of the 
Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big 12, the Big East, the Big Ten, the Pac 10 and the South East Conference."
1869,15," In contrast, Guth uses an ""averaging"" method to assess the effect of the Two in Four Rule. Guth testified that he would use a 
three year average of the number of games before the Two in Four Rule and compare that with number of games after the rule 
to assess the effect of the Rule. This method derives from Guth's view that the number of certified events in 2000-01 was 
unnatural because of the impending unknown effects of the Two in Four Rule. The Court rejects Guth's view on the appropriate 
baseline for measuring the effects of the Two in Four Rule since Guth provided no supporting data as to this theory. The Court 
agrees with Tollison that the logical baseline is the 2000-01 season because that is the year in which all teams were eligible to 
participate in certified events. "

cable subscribers in the United States as reported by A.C. Nielsen ….""  Chicago Professional Sports Limited Partnership v. 
NBA, 754 F. Supp. 1336, 1345 (N.D. Ill. 1991). Further, at the time of the decision, there were three superstations in the United 
States: WGN in Chicago, WTBS in Atlanta and WWOR in New York. All stations televised NBA games and WGN reached 31% 
of the nation's television households.  Id. at 1345-46, 1348."
1877,18," The Court notes that Plaintiffs rely on this case in their post-hearing brief. On July 14, 2003, Defendant filed a Motion Strike 
Plaintiffs' reliance on the case as inappropriate in light of the alleged ""subsequent reversal and vacation of the injunction by the 
Seventh Circuit in  Chicago Professional Sports, Ltd. v. National Basketball Association, 95 F.3d 593 (7th Cir. 1996)."" The 
NCAA's characterization of the subsequent history of the district court's underlying decision is inaccurate. The 1991 decision by 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit in  Chicago Professional 
Sports, Ltd. v. NBA, 961 F.2d 667 (7th Cir. 1992). The Seventh Circuit denied a rehearing en banc in June 1992. Thus, pursuant 
to the decisions, the Chicago Bulls and the WGN Superstation were permitted to broadcast 25 games per year. The district court 
in Illinois later considered whether the number could be increased to 30 games per year and whether the NBA could impose a 
""tax"" on the games' broadcast to a national audience. The district court held that a thirty game allowance was permissible but 
found the NBA's tax excessive.  Chicago Professional Sports. Ltd. v. NBA, 874 F. Supp. 844 (N.D. Ill. 1995). This decision was 
vacated by the Seventh Circuit and the case was remanded for further proceedings,  Chicago Professional Sports, Ltd. v. 
National Basketball Association, 95 F.3d 593 (7th Cir. 1996). Thus, it is wholly inaccurate to characterize the holding of the 
district court in 1991 as being reversed and vacated. The Defendant's Motion to Strike (Doc. # 139) is DENIED. "
1893,1," The class had not been certified. After appeal was granted herein, but prior to oral argument the trial court stayed this case for 
reasons unrelated to this appeal by order of October 23, 2000. The stay was lifted by order entered September 11, 2002. "
1895,2," The complaint describes the process by which Microsoft authorizes or licenses original equipment manufacturers (""OEM""s) to 
copy its software for installation in the OEMs' computers which are then sold as a combined product under a single price. "
1896,3," Plaintiffs state that ""depending on what discovery may develop further about the nature of the end user license agreements"" a 
buyer-seller relationship ""may be"" fleshed out."
1896,4," Because the plaintiffs have not alleged that they are direct purchasers of Microsoft products, we affirm the trial court's dismissal 
on behalf of direct purchasers. "
1898,5," The District Court cited state statutes from California, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah, West 
Virginia, and Wisconsin."
1898,6," The court remanded the issue of whether Microsoft had illegally tied its browser and operating system. On remand, the United 
States decided not to pursue the tying claim. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 215 F. Supp. 2d 1, 3 n.2 (D.D.C. July 2, 
2002)."
1898,7," That case was an enforcement action brought by the Department of Justice and a number of state attorneys general. In other 
cases brought by private parties, defendants have also been subject to liability under both federal and state antitrust laws. See, 
e.g., Griffiths v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ala., 147 F. Supp. 2d 1203, 1214-15 & 1221 (N.D. Ala. 2001) (holding that the 
complaint alleged restraint of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act; made sufficient allegations that the primarily intrastate 
commercial restraint substantially affected interstate commerce to sustain federal jurisdiction; and, based upon the same "
1899,," underlying factual allegations, also made claims under Alabama's antitrust statutes because it claimed an intrastate restraint of 
trade with effects on both intrastate and interstate commerce); In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 160 F. Supp. 2d 
1365 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (granting partial summary judgment to direct purchaser plaintiffs on Sherman Act claim and considering 
indirect purchasers' claims under various state antitrust laws); In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig.,105 F. Supp. 2d 618 (E.D. Mich. 
2000) (involving direct purchasers bringing claims under the Sherman Act and indirect purchasers bringing claims under antitrust 
statutes of eight states)."
1899,8," The court held that state courts in Louisiana were undecided on whether their statute's ""restraint of trade or commerce in this 
state"" required that the violation occur in the state, that South Carolina's antitrust act applies only to intrastate commerce but its 
unfair trade practices act was not so limited, that the Utah statute only applied where the violation occurs in the state, and that 
the Tennessee statute applied only to violations occurring within the state)."
1899,9," Lawsuits essentially identical to the one before us have been brought by indirect purchasers in a number of states, and none 
has been dismissed on the basis that federal law requires that the suit be brought under the Sherman Act because of its 
interstate commerce aspects. That argument has not been made by Microsoft in those cases, and it does not make that 
argument herein. Both parties herein agreed that to the extent the trial court's decision was based upon the exclusivity of federal 
and state antitrust statutes, that decision was in error."
1899,10," The Court has considered antitrust issues, such as the requirement of an actual antitrust injury, in cases construing other 
statutes. See GHEM, Inc., 850 S.W.2d 447 (Tenn. 1993) (construing the Petroleum Trade Practices Act); Walker v. Bruno's, Inc., 
650 S.W.2d 357 (Tenn. 1983) (holding that the Tennessee Unfair Milk Sales Act did not conflict with the Sherman Act). See also 
State ex rel. Attorney Gen. v. Burley Tobacco Growers' Co-Operative Ass'n, 2 Tenn. App. 674 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1927) (holding, in 
a suit to prohibit association from transacting business in this state for violation of antitrust statutes, that a statute allowing co-
operative marketing legalized practices that might have previously been illegal)."
1899,11, The language of the act defining the prohibited conduct has not changed since the Court interpreted it in Standard Oil. 
1900,12," In pertinent part, the statute made unlawful arrangements lessening competition ""in the importation or sale of articles imported 
into this state."" Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-25-101."
1900,13," The appellants had argued that the statute impinged on interstate commerce because it was applied, in their case, to an 
arrangement relating to property to be thereafter imported into the state. The Court made clear, however, that there was no 
averment that the agreement was made to lessen competition in the sale of coal oil intended to be imported by Standard Oil's 
competitor. 117 Tenn. at 642-43, 100 S.W. at 711."
1900,14, This conclusion was based upon the narrow interpretation of Congress's Commerce Clause power that prevailed at the time. 
1901,15," HRI was a wholly owned subsidiary of National Souvenir Center, Inc., a District of Columbia corporation that was also a party 
to this suit. "
1902,16," In support of this statement, the court cited S.C. Hwy. Dep't v. Barnwell Bros., 303 U.S. 177, 58 S. Ct. 510, 82 L. Ed. 734 
(1938) and Union Brokerage Co. v. Jensen, 322 U.S. 202, 64 S. Ct. 967, 88 L. Ed. 1227 (1944). "
1903,17," Some of those courts have relied upon an additional opinion this court is precluded from addressing because the Tennessee 
Supreme Court concurred in results only when it denied permission to appeal. Pursuant to Tenn. R. Sup. Ct. 4(F), an 
intermediate court opinion so designated may not be cited by any judge or by any litigant. Because courts outside our state court 
system have cited the opinion, however, it is prudent for us to provide the name and citation: Dzik & Dzik, P.C. v. Vision Serv. 
Plan, 1989 Tenn. App. LEXIS 25, No. 836, 1989 WL 3082 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jan. 20, 1989) (permission to appeal denied, 
concurring in results only, Aug. 7, 1989)."
1903,18," This court has described the effect of the interpretation of state law by federal courts as follows: Federal courts look to the law of the state as declared by its highest court when they decide questions of state law. In the 
absence of an authoritative pronouncement by the state's highest court, the federal courts may either certify the state law 
question to the state's highest court for an interpretation, Tenn. S. Ct. 23; Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 
76-78, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 1073-74, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1977), or ascertain and apply the state law as they understand it from 
available sources. United States v. Anderson County, 761 F.2d 1169, 1173 (6th Cir. 1953). When a federal court undertakes to 
decide a state law question in the absence of authoritative state precedent, the state courts are not bound to follow the federal 
court's decision. Townes v. Sunbeam Oster Co., Inc., 50 S.W.3d 446, 452 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001)."
1903,19," In Duke v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Tenn., Inc., 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20769, No. 96-2859-TUA, 1996 WL 33415134 (W.D. 
Tenn. Oct. 22, 1996), the court considered an antitrust claim under the Tennessee statute that was essentially the same as one 
brought by the plaintiff in another case under federal law. The court viewed its task as determining whether a cause of action 
had been alleged under the Sherman Act or under state law, stating, ""The main distinction between claims under the Tennessee 
and the federal statutes is that the Sherman Act prohibits monopolization in interstate commerce, while the Tennessee statute 
only applies if the action is predominantly intrastate."" 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS at *7-*8. In a third case, Blake v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 
894 F. Supp. 327 (E.D. Tenn. 1995), the court did not address the merits of plaintiffs' claim under state law, but commented that 
the Tennessee Supreme Court had narrowly construed Tennessee antitrust law in Standard Oil. 894 F. Supp. at 330. "
1905,20," Some courts have found a legislature's grant of remedy to indirect purchasers significant in determining the scope of a state's 
antitrust statute. See, e.g.., Emergency One v. Waterous Co., Inc., 23 F. Supp. 2d 959, 964 (E.D. Wis. 1998) (holding that the 
best indication of an intent to hold interstate actors accountable may be the inclusion of a remedy for indirect purchasers, and 
stating ""the prototypical indirect purchasers action would vindicate far-flung consumers for the indirect costs of price-fixing 
conducted on a national scale"")."
1905,21," The federal court's statement in In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig. that the phrase ""transactions,"" as used in the 
plaintiffs' pleadings and, presumably, as used in Lynch, must refer to the actions of the defendants because Tenn. Code Ann. § 
47-25-102 prohibited ""arrangements to restrain competition,"" 160 F. Supp. at 1377 n.9, implies that the test is related to the "
1906,," alleged illegal conduct. We disagree with that conclusion, however, because the Lynch court's analysis of the transactions 
between the parties, i.e. their contractual relationship, demonstrates that the Lynch standard was based upon the transactions 
between the parties giving rise to the dispute, not to the location of the allegedly anticompetitive acts. "
1907,22," The Court specifically held that the plaintiffs are not required to make the ""more particularized showing"" that the 
anticompetitive conduct caused an effect on interstate commerce. 444 U.S. at 242-43, 100 S. Ct. at 509. The test enunciated is: "
1908,," To establish federal jurisdiction in this case, there remains only the requirement that respondents' activities which allegedly have 
been infected by a price-fixing conspiracy be shown ""as a matter of practical economics"" to have a not insubstantial effect on the 
interstate commerce involved."
1908,444," U.S. at 246, 100 S. Ct. at 511. The pleading requirement has been refined, at least in some circuits, to require identification 
of the relevant aspect of interstate commerce. Valley Disposal v. Cent. Vt. Solid Waste Mgmt. Dist., 31 F.3d 89, 94 (2d Cir. 
1994)."
1908,23," Although Plaintiffs argued that the predominant effects test was extinct, inapplicable, and introduced into Tennessee law 
without explanation or authority, they also maintained that their claims met the predominant effects test. We disagree. Based 
upon allegations in the complaint, it is clear that Microsoft's allegedly anticompetitive conduct would have had effects on 
interstate commerce, as well as on that of other states. Confronted with these allegations, we cannot infer that the effects are 
predominantly intrastate. Plaintiffs have offered no factual allegations that they are. Plaintiffs' conclusory allegations that 
Microsoft's conduct had significant, substantial, and ""predominant"" effects on trade and commerce inside the state of Tennessee 
cannot suffice for the absence of even one factual allegation that the effects in Tennessee are predominant over the effects 
nationwide. "
1909,24," For a discussion of the ""dual sovereignty"" theory that predominated in early state antitrust cases, which set forth distinct and 
mutually exclusive jurisdictional areas for state and federal regulation, see Abbott Labs. v. Durrett, 746 So. 2d 316 (Ala. 1999) 
and Archer Daniels Midland Co., 746 So. 2d at 987-88."
1909,25," The Alabama Supreme Court rejected the conclusion of the Seventh Circuit in In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs regarding 
the scope of the Alabama antitrust statute and held that the scope was exactly the same today as it was when the statute was 
passed. Archer Daniels Midland Co., 746 So. 2d at 987-88. "

Commerce, 54 VAND. L. REV. 1705 (2001)."
1910,27," The preamble to the 1903 Act, which was identical to that of the 1897 Act, provided: An act to declare unlawful and void all arrangements and contracts, agreements, trusts or combinations made with a view to 
lessen, or which tend to lessen free competition in the importation or sale of articles imported into this state; or in the 
manufacture or sale of articles of domestic growth or of raw material; to declare unlawful and void all arrangements, contracts, 
agreements, trusts or combinations between persons or corporations designed, or which tend to advance, reduce or control the 
price of such product or articles to producer or consumer of any such product or articles; to provide for forfeiture of the charter 
and franchise of any corporation, organized under the laws of this state, violating any of the provisions of this act; to prohibit 
every foreign corporation, violating any of the provisions of this act, from doing business in this state; to require the Attorney 
General of this state to institute legal proceedings against any such corporations violating the provisions of this Act, and to 
enforce the penalties prescribed; to prescribe penalties for any violation of the act; to authorize any person or corporation 
damaged by any such trust, agreement or combination, to sue for the recovery of such damages, and for other purposes."

1897 Act). "
1911,28," A state's power to regulate interstate commerce is still limited in some situations; for example, by the limitations on the 
extraterritorial powers of state government. See K-S Pharmacies, Inc. v. Am. Home Prods. Corp., 962 F.2d 728, 730 (7th Cir. 
1992) (holding that a state cannot regulate sales that take place wholly outside it). See also Heath Consultants, 527 N.W.2d at 
606 (giving examples of preemption or inapplicability of state antitrust laws, generally describing them as situations involving 
national organizations already subject to federal legislation or national governing bodies). Some courts have applied the test 
promulgated by the U.S. Supreme Court in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 90 S. Ct. 844, 25 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1970), that 
is, ""Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate 
commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to 
the putative local benefits. . . ."" Id."
1911,29," This is the same test used by federal courts to determine if the Sherman Act can be applied to a primarily local restraint of 
trade. McLain, 444 U.S. at 244, 100 S. Ct. at 510. It is also the approach taken with regard to the Sherman Act's application to 
anticompetitive conduct occurring outside this country. ""It is well established by now that the Sherman Act applies to foreign 
conduct that was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the United States."" Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. 
Cal., 509 U.S. 764, 795, 113 S. Ct. 2891, 2909, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1993). "
1914,30," In Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 646 N.W.2d 440, 448 (Iowa 2002), the Supreme Court of Iowa stated that nineteen states, the 
District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have adopted statutes expressly authorizing suits by indirect purchasers, citing statutes 
from California, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and 
the District of Columbia. "
1916,31, It appears the Arizona Supreme Court has granted review of this case. 
1918,32," The two decisions by federal courts in Tennessee interpreting the remedies section of the statute provide little guidance on the 
issue before us. See Volpp Tractor Parts, Inc. v. Caterpillar, Inc., 917 F. Supp. 1208, 1236 (W.D. Tenn. 1995) (holding that 
Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-25-106 provides a remedy only to customers or consumers, not to competitors and stating that, ""As a 
competitor, Volpp never paid any consideration or sum for any product sold in violation of the statute""); Tacker v. Wilson, 830 F. 
Supp. 422, 430 (W.D. Tenn. 1993) (finding that plaintiff had not stated a claim for relief under Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-25-106 
because he had not alleged any facts to indicate he transacted business with any of the defendants)."
1918,33," Some commentators have expressed the view that state courts dealing with the question of indirect purchasers and the 
concerns raised in Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick generally approach the policy questions in one of two ways. The first 
emphasizes the purpose of antitrust remedies as deterring violations; the other views compensation as more important and 
emphasizes compensation of the consumer who usually bears the cost of all or a portion of the overcharge caused by 
anticompetitive conduct. See A& M Supply Co., 654 N.W.2d at 580-81 (discussing and quoting extensively from William H. 
Page, The Limits of State Indirect Purchaser Suits: Class Certification in the Shadow of Illinois Brick, 67 ANTITRUST L.J. 1, 2 
(1999)). "
1919,34," 15 U.S.C.A. § 45 (a)(1) provides: HN41[
] Unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting 
commerce, are hereby declared unlawful."
1919,35," The FTC and federal courts reviewing FTC actions have interpreted the ""unfair methods of competition"" language as applying 
to violations of the Sherman Act and other antitrust statutes and to actions raising antitrust issues or concerns. FTC v. Brown 
Shoe Co., 384 U.S. 316, 321-22, 86 S. Ct. 1501, 1504-05, 16 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1966); FTC v. Motion Picture Adver. Serv. Co., 344 
U.S. 392, 394-95, 73 S. Ct. 361, 363, 97 L. Ed. 426, 49 F.T.C. 1730 (1953); FTC v. Cement Inst., 333 U.S. 683, 692-95, 68 S. 
Ct. 793, 799-801, 92 L. Ed. 1010, 44 F.T.C. 1460 (1948). See also John F. Graybeal, Unfair Trade Practices, Antitrust and 
Consumer Welfare in North Carolina, 80 N.C. L. REV. 1927, 1939-51 (2002)."
1919,36," For an explanation of the history of the FTC Act see John F. Graybeal, supra; Marshall A. Leaffer & Michael H. Lipson, 
Consumer Actions Against Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices: The Private Uses of Federal Trade Commission 
Jurisprudence, 48 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 521 (1980); William A. Lovett, State Deceptive Trade Practice Legislation, 46 TUL. L. 
REV. 724 (1972)."
1919,37," Other uniform acts have also been proposed, including the UNIFORM DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES ACT, 7A U.L.A. 35 
(1978), and the UNIFORM CONSUMER SALES PRACTICES ACT, 7A U.L.A. 1 (1978). See Marshall A. Leaffer and Michael H. "
1920,," Lipson, supra, at 522 n.3. However, the genesis of the majority of state consumer protection acts can be traced to the Uniform 
Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law. DEE PRIDGEN, CONSUMER PROTECTION AND THE LAW, § 3.5 (2002). 
Obviously, Tennessee's enactment preceded these other uniform acts."
1920,38," The Pridgen book lists twenty states as adopting the ""Little FTC Act"" version: Alaska, California, Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, 
Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. PRIDGEN, supra, § 3:5 n.13."
1920,39," Along with a number of other states, Tennessee also adopted the approach of listing certain prohibited practices and including 
a general ""any other practice that is unfair or deceptive"" provision. The TCPA lists some thirty- three specific acts that constitute 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices, Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-18-104(b), all of which involve some form of misrepresentation about 
goods or services. In addition, there is a general catchall, ""engaging in any other act or practice which is deceptive to the 
consumer or to any other person."" Tenn. Code Ann. § 47-18- 104(b)(27). "
1921,40," In Blake, the unreported opinion discussed earlier, the court held that ""a viable cause of action under TTPA also states a 
cause of action under TCPA,"" 1996 WL 134947, at *5-*6. For the clear legislative history reasons stated herein, we disagree and 
decline to follow that holding in Blake."
1921,41," In Blake this court stated that because ""one cannot do indirectly what cannot be done directly,"" if plaintiffs had no cause of 
action under the antitrust statute, they similarly had no claim under the TCPA. Blake, 1996 WL 134947, at *19. The court 
concluded, however, that plaintiffs had a cause of action under both statutes. We disagree, because the two statutes cover 
different types of illegal conduct. See footnote 40. "
1932,1," These valves can be configured in a number of ways, including the use of different kinds of switches, finishes or other options."
1932,2," IBS is a ""manufacturer's representative (i.e., sells burners) for Eclipse Products (which manufactures burners among other 
products)."" According to Richard Clasby, Maxon Vice-President for Sales. Eclipse's manufacture (and therefore IBS' sale) of 
burners is in ""direct competition"" with Maxon. Moreover, in answer to the question ""(is there anybody else) you recognize as 
direct competitors (in the Detroit burner market)."" Clasby replied ""not really … (and if there is) we don't face them head to head "
1933,," in competition like we face IBS head to head, day in and day out."" See IBS' Brief in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for 
Summary Judgment."
1933,3," From 1992 until 2002, IBS' total sales have remained between $ 4 and $ 5 million. During this same time, various companies 
have both started and stopped making gas trains (for example, DLB, which has given up production in favor of purchasing gas 
trains from IBS)."
1933,4," What ""based on the nature of their business"" means is unclear. However, IBS alleges that, in his Deposition, Clasby ""admitted 
that, when deciding which classification to assign to a customer, it considers whether that customer is a competitor of Maxon 
and that competitors are assigned higher prices. This is true even when the company is similarly situated and buying 
commodities of like grade and quality."" See IBS' Brief in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, at 3. IBS 
further alleges that, through Clasby, Maxon has ""admitted that it is trying to increase its market share -- i.e., to reduce 
competition."" See Id. at 3-4. Finally, IBS alleges, that Maxon, again through Clasby, has ""admitted that one of the reasons it has 
refused to classify IBS as an OEM was because IBS was a competitor of Maxon."" See Id."
1933,5," Thus, even though these companies may not differ from IBS in ""the nature of their business."" theyreceive better prices from 
Maxon. IBS alleges that as a result the Competitors have a competitive advantage."
1933,6," A firm is eligible for a BOD if the given purchase exceeds $ 100,000 and/or the firm agrees to buy ""x"" ahead of time. IBS 
alleges that, even when it has met the BOD threshold, Maxon has never offered it a BOD."
1933,7," The primary-line may arguably include IBS in its capacity as a manufacturer's representative. However, in its response to 
Maxon's motion for summary judgment, IBS argues that this lawsuit is only presenting a ""secondary-line"" Robinson-Patman 
claim."
1933,8," It is also possible that Maxon, as a primary-line manufacturer of valves, burners and other relevant parts, deals directly with 
tertiary-level customers (for the purpose of the gas train market) as secondary-line competitors (for their respective industrial 
applications). However, for the purposes of this instant motion Maxon's relationship to those parties is described as falling within 
the tertiary-line. "
1934,9," The relevant competition in this market is for the bid: and, at this point, the bids are reflective of purchase prices. Moreover, it is 
undisputed that the amount of the quotes given by Maxon to the secondary-line competitors are not dependent on securing the 
contract from the tertiary-line customer."
1934,10," All other things being equal, it is at least reasonable to determine that higher prices for given parts result in higher bid amounts 
and a lower likelihood of successfully producing a winning bid."
1934,11," As part of the discovery process, IBS produced bids or quotes from IBS that were pending or submitted after Maxon 
terminated its relationship with IBS. In making these disclosures, IBS also identified the categories and amount of its alleged 
damages. "
1935,12," In their Response to Maxon's Motion for Summary Judgment, IBS asserts that this is ""a secondary-line"" Robinson-Patman 
case, See Plaintiff's Brief in Opposition, at 6. Whether this is an exclusive description of the case at hand will be more fully 
explored below."
1935,13," While section 2(a) affords defendants two defenses based on certain cost justifications and/or changing conditions. see 15 
U.S.C. § 13(a), Maxon has not asserted either of them."
1935,14," It is entirely possible that Maxon's assertion that the ""two purchaser requirement"" (or the so-called ""contemporaneous"" sales 
requirement) was not satisfied is an assault on the latter portion of the second element, or possibly the second element in its 
entirety. Likewise, this argument may go to the fourth element, by disputing that the price discrimination had a prohibited effect 
on competition. Or it may be an attempt to undermine both. Although it is possible to envision a situation where the direction of 
the defendant's thrust will make a difference in the analysis, under the facts of this case it is a distinction without a difference. "
1936,15," In Chroma Lighting, the defendant argued that the plaintiff could not have been in competition with either of its alleged 
competitors because it purchased its product from the defendant only after he had a customer's order in hand. 1997 U.S. App. 
LEXIS 6725, *4-5 (9th Cir. 1997). According to the defendant's theory, if the plaintiff purchased a product from the defendant 
after he had already ""sold"" that product to a customer, then the plaintiff could not be in competition for the resale of that 
particular product. Id. Defendant also argued that if the plaintiff did not have a customer bid, then he would have no reason to 
purchase a product, and there could be no ""contemporaneous"" sale. Id. The court found the defendant's theory ""unconvincing."" 
Id. Whether or not the plaintiff actually purchased his inventory before or after he made customer sales does not change the fact 
that he competed for each sale on the basis of the price he expected to get from the defendant. This evidence was sufficient to 
satisfy the Robinson-Patman Act's requirement that discriminatory sales be ""substantially contemporaneous."" Id."
1936,16," Innomed Labs, LLC v. Alza Corp., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21840. *7-8 (S.D.N.Y November 13, 2002)(Because, to accept the 
such an argument would require ""truncating the balance of § 13(a), which states that it shall also be unlawful to 'injure, destroy, 
or prevent competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination.'"")"
1936,17," Maxon does argue that IBS was not in competition at the time of what it characterizes as the ""actual purchase"" of its products 
by IBS, because the competition ended when the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder. However, as explained below, it is 
precisely because the relevant period of competition is prior to the award of the bid that the quote given by Maxon at that time 
carries the discriminatory price effect."
1936,18," Moreover, even if this court had found that there was a contemporaneous requirement and applied it against IBS, other courts 
have held that ""an established customer who is currently purchasing one type of goods at a higher price and is denied the right 
to buy a lower-priced good of 'like grade and quality' which is being sold to a competitor can sue under the Act."" See, e.g., Fusco 
v. Xerox Corp., 676 F.2d 332, 335 (8th Cir. 1982) (citations omitted). Based on Maxon's refusal to grant IBS OEM status in the 
present case, IBS could have failed Maxon's self-styled ""contemporaneous"" requirement and still had the right to sue under the 
Act. "
1937,19," The court reasoned that: ""once it was awarded the bid, which was a prerequisite to becoming a purchaser … [the plaintiff's] 1970 contract was 
assured to it to the exclusion of all other suppliers regardless of any discrepancy in prices paid on underlying subcontracts. 
In the same fashion, the [tertiary-line customer] pledged itself unconditionally under the 1971 contract to purchase the 
specified quantity of finished plugs exclusively from [the competitor]. The very nature of these mutually exclusive 
commitments in the respective contracts meant that [the plaintiff and the competitor] could not have been 'in competition' 
with respect to their separate purchases from [the defendant] pursuant to the government contracts. Therefore, while the 
price discrepancy between the two actual purchases (as distinguished from the bids related to the 1971 contract) could "
1938,," have affected [the plaintiff's] profits under the addition to its 1970 contract, this discrimination in no way diminished [his] 
competitive ability in that …. market."" Id. at 1066-67."
1938,20," See M.C. Manufacturing, 517 F.2d at 1068 (""[Antitrust legislation] is concerned with predatory price cutting which has the 
effect of eliminating or crippling a competitor. For, surely there is no more effective means of lessening competition or creating 
monopolies than the debilitation of a competitor."" (citation omitted)). "
1939,21," Both Maxon and IBS have failed to raise an important legal issue which has not been addressed by this Circuit; namely, in 
secondary-line cases, whether after Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168, 
113 S. Ct. 2578 (1993), the same sort of anti-competitive injury which is a prerequisite under the Sherman Act must be shown 
under section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act (which would in effect make the Morton Salt inference invalid). Four Circuits 
addressing this issue have determined that the Morton Salt inference is applicable in secondary-line price discrimination cases 
even after Brooke Group. See George Haug Co. v. Rolls Royce Motor Cars, Inc., 148 F.3d 136, 144 (2d Cir. 1998) (Expressly 
adopting the First Circuit's view expressed in Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc., that the Morton Salt inference is still applicable); 
Chroma Lighting v. GTE Products Corp., 111 F.3d 653, 658 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 943 (1997) (expressly adopting the 
First Circuit's conclusion that the Morton Salt inference is applicable in secondary-line price discrimination cases even after 
Brooke Group); Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Co., 79 F.3d 182 (1st Cir. 1996) (concluding that 
Morton Salt remained good law despite the holding in Brooke Group): Stelwagon Mfg. Co. v. Tarmac Roofing, 63 F.3d 1267, 
1272 (3rd Cir. 1995) (finding that a claim in a secondary-line price discrimination case under the Robinson-Patman Act is 
supportable upon proof of a substantial price discrimination between competitors over time); see also Chawla v. Shell Oil Co., 75 
F. Supp. 2d 626, 652 (S.D. Tex. 1999) (where the district court concluded that the Fifth Circuit would not extend Brooke Group to 
second-line cases); Innomed Labs, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13298, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (There is ""a critical distinction between 
the prima facie elements of the Sherman Act (where there is a need to adequately allege, or point to facts to support an 
allegation, that the plaintiff sustained the requisite injury, i.e., that the challenged action has had an actual adverse effect on 
competition as a whole in the relevant market) and the Robinson-Patman Act (where a plaintiff need not similarly allege an injury 
on the market) …""). After examining the reasoning set forth in the above cases, this court, like the court in Chawla, HN13[
] 
concludes that the Sixth Circuit would not extend the reach of Brooke Group beyond primary-line cases."
1939,22," The Table (which appears to be from January 1996) list the following price differentials: ""End Products"" are offered to the OEM 
at (.80), and to the Resaler at (.90) -- a difference of 14%; ""Parts and Subassemblies"" are offered to the OEM at (.85), and to the 
Resaler at (.93) -- a difference of 9.4%; ""Regulators, Pipe Trains"" are offered to the OEM at (.90), and to the Resaler at (.95) -- a 
difference of 5.5%; ""SOV-STO End Products"" are offered to the OEM at (.66) and to the Wholesaler at (.73) -- a difference of 
10.6%; ""SOV-STO Parts % Subs, Modular End Products"" are offered to the OEM at (.80) and to the Wholesaler at (.90) -- a 
difference of 14%; ""Modular Parts and Subassemblies"" are offered to the OEM at (.90), with no listed price for Wholesaler. "
1940,23," Moreover, even if this court had determined that deposition, standing alone, was insufficient to create a genuine issue of 
material fact as to the duration of the alleged discrimination, when combined with the differing prices in the Table, Flora's 
deposition creates a genuine issue of material fact concerning the duration of the alleged price discrimination. Therefore, even 
under this view, summary judgment would not be appropriate. "
1941,24," HN21[
] The Morton Salt inference, as applied in Allied II, does not require the plaintiff to prove that price discrimination was 
the sole or ""but for"" cause of his injury. It is enough that the challenged price discrimination is a material cause of that injury. 901 
F.2d at 1325-26: see also Allied I, 825 F.2d at 973 (""'[A] plaintiff need not exhaust all possible alternative sources of injury in 
fulfilling his burden of proving compensable injury ….'"" (quoting Zenith Corp. v. Hazeltine, 395 U.S. 100, 114, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 
89 S. Ct. 1562. 395 U.S. 100, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129, 89 S. Ct. 1562 n. 9 (1969))). "
1942,25," See also, Flora Deposition, at 202 (""They [TMI, a competitor,] might have built 150 [gas trains], but to my salesmen's 
recollection we lost a hundred of them over the last 10 years at least because … TMI is an air house manufacturer. Air house 
manufacturers have higher volumes, bigger valves, and so [for] all the bigger valves we have to use Maxon and so we're always 
at a disadvantage with that.""). "
1943,26," In Allied I, the defendant manufacturer signed a contract with a certain one of the plaintiff's competitors which allowed that 
competitor to purchase the product at issue for 10 percent below warehouse distribution prices.825 F.2d 971, 973 (6th Cir. 
1987). Several companies submitted bids to the customer for supplying the manufacturer's product. Id. The lowest bid was 
submitted by the competitor who had been given the discount, and the second-lowest bid was submitted by the plaintiff. Id. The 
customer subsequently chose the competitor, and the plaintiff brought suit alleging that the defendant's discount to that 
competitor violated the Robinson-Patman Act. Id."
1943,27," At the very least, these pieces of evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, create a genuine issue 
of material fact that precludes the granting of summary judgment."
1943,28," See D.E. Rogers Assocs., Inc. v. Gardner-Denver Co., 718 F.2d 1431, 1438-39 (6th Cir. 1983)(To successfully prove price 
discrimination, where it was alleged that a price differential threatens a primary-line injury, the plaintiff is required to prove that 
(1) the defendant discriminated ""in price between different purchasers of commodities of like grade and quality."" and (2) the 
effect of such discrimination may be substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce. 
*** [Where] the plaintiff in a primary line case has not undertaken a general market analysis to prove anticompetitive effect, many 
of the courts to have recently considered Robinson-Patman Act claims look to evidence of predatory intent from which to infer 
injury to competition. See, e.g., Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 696-98, 18 L. Ed. 2d 406, 87 S. Ct. 1326. 
386 U.S. 685, 18 L. Ed. 2d 406, 87 S. Ct. 1326 (1967) (citations omitted)). "
1944,29," While IBS does assert that Maxon is the exclusive provider of certain models of valves and burners, this does not necessarily 
amount to a claim that Maxon has monopolistic power within the relevant market. Moreover, IBS has failed to come forward with 
sufficient evidence to support such a claim, even if it were to be implied from the facts presented."
1944,30," Applying this exception to the facts of its case, the court found that ""the individual payments to [the defendant] were only a 
manifestation of the previous agreement. The individual payments therefore do not constitute a 'new and independent act,' as 
required to restart the statute of limitations."" Id. "
1945,31," The Court in Zenith observed, however, that HN29[
] when a continuous antitrust violation is alleged, a cause of action 
accrues each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants: In the context of a continuing conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws … each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the 
defendants a cause of action accrues to him to recover the damages caused by that act and … as to those damages, the 
statute of limitations runs from the commission of the act."

1953,1," The bond market in the United States is enormous. The Bond Market Association (""BMA""), the industry's trade association, 
estimates that as of 2002, the entire market (including money market instruments and asset backed and mortgage-related 
securities) was valued at $ 20.2 trillion dollars in outstanding securities. See BMA, Debt Markets Represented by The Bond 
Market Association as of 2002, available at http://www.bondmarkets.com/Research/debtmkt.html. At the end of 2002, corporate 
debt securities represented the second largest sub-group in the bond market (after mortgage-related securities) with $ 4.0 trillion 
dollars of outstanding securities. U.S. Treasury securities amounted to $ 3.2 trillion dollars and total municipal securities 
outstanding was valued at $ 1.8 trillion. Id. Not only is the market large, but the daily trading volume is impressive. The BMA estimated the value of daily trading volume 
within the relevant sectors as follows: U.S. Treasury $ 366.4 billion Corporate $ 18.9 billion Municipal $ 10.7 billion Id. "
1954,2," In the early 1990s, there were advances in the trading of U.S. government and municipal bonds that increased the price 
transparency of these respective markets. In 1991, the SEC and Congress encouraged the formation of GovPX, a 24-hour 
distributor of real-time quotes on transaction prices for U.S. Treasury and other government securities. Four years later, the 
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (""MSRB"") began collecting information on inter-dealer transactions of municipal bonds 
and issuing daily summary reports. In 1998, the MSRB expanded these activities to cover transactions between broker-dealers 
and their customers. See Levitt Speech, 1998 WL 614902 at *3. "
1956,3," Fondren recorded his conversations and those of other InterVest employees with broker-dealers in ACT Notes beginning in 
1992. After a meeting, Fondren and other InterVest employees would use a tape recorder to record what transpired and then an 
assistant would transcribe the tape into the ACT Notes system. Cowen argued in the District Court that many, if not all, of the 
ACT Notes constituted inadmissible hearsay. InterVest objected and invoked a number of exceptions to the hearsay rule. 
InterVest also noted that Fondren's deposition repeated much of what the ACT Notes contain, although Fondren admitted that 
he relied on the ACT Notes to refresh his memory before the deposition. The District Court declined to rule on the admissibility of 
the ACT Notes, but instead chose to treat them as evidence of the alleged conspiracy for the purpose of the summary judgment 
motion.  Intervest, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 706 n.4. Cowen does not appeal this decision by the Court. "
1957,4," Interestingly, Fondren proffered a different version of his conversation with Garcia in a letter he sent to another employee of 
Bloomberg shortly thereafter in an effort to resolve Bloomberg's concerns. Fondren wrote that Garcia explained to him that 
Bloomberg's actions were the result of its ""assessment that, while no plans were currently formulated, Bloomberg, or its broker-
dealer affiliate, may at some future time compete with its broker-dealer customers and that any future effort or programming for 
InterVest would be counterproductive."" In other words, Bloomberg or Merrill Lynch, which had an ownership stake in Bloomberg, 
was contemplating creating a service similar to that of InterVest. "
1958,5," InterVest received a similar response from other broker-dealers that, like Cowen, decided not to do business with InterVest. 
Most of the firms notified InterVest that its business was not the way ""the street works"" and that it should ""play by the rules."" (CS 
First Boston); see also A428 (J.P. Morgan); A429 (Smith Barney)."
1958,6," The record also includes two obscene communications to InterVest from mid-level Cowen employees criticizing InterVest in 
scatological terms. One is an email from May 20, 1996 in response to InterVest's advertising and the other is a call on October 
23, 1996 from someone on Cowen's corporate bond desk. "
1959,7," Although the District Court did not rule on the issue, Cowen argued before the Court that it was not the proximate cause of 
InterVest's financial difficulties because the firm was in significant trouble before Bloomberg terminated its relationship with 
InterVest. Cowen pointed to InterVest's 1997 losses of over $ 2.5 million, the fact that no active subscribers signed onto the 
system, and the company's purge of most of its employees, which left only ""a skeleton staff.""  Intervest, 206 F. Supp. 2d at 709. 
Cowen also noted that a letter sent by InterVest's counsel, dated December 29, 1997, blamed EOS Partners, one of InterVest's 
investors, for its dire financial situation by usurping and interfering in investment opportunities, and did not name Cowen or other 
broker-dealers. Because we agree with the Court that InterVest cannot survive summary judgment on the concerted action 
element, we too decline to reach the issue of antitrust injury. "
1960,8," In addition to its Sherman Act claim, InterVest alleges that Cowen violated Pennsylvania antitrust law. Because Pennsylvania 
has no separate antitrust statute, InterVest's ""allegation rises or falls with plaintiff's federal antitrust claims.""  Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. 
F. Schumacher & Co., 37 F.3d 996, 1014 (3d Cir. 1993) (citing  Collins v. Main Line Bd. of Realtors, 452 Pa. 342, 304 A.2d 493 
(1973)). "
1966,9," Michael Bloomberg explained in his deposition that some broker-dealers would provide Bloomberg with ""indications"" of their 
bond trading, meaning general information on the range of prices at which the firms would trade bonds. Bloomberg described 
these indications as taking various forms: [Broker-dealers] would typically in some bonds give a general rate level. In some markets they would give a specific price 
and say whether or not they would be willing to buy or sell at that price. If they were willing to buy, it was a bid. If they were 
willing to sell, it would be an indication of an offer, but in none of those cases would the term indication mean that they felt 
they had to go ahead with the transaction. Bloomberg also explained that the broker-dealers could specify which customers on the Bloomberg network would have access 
to these indications. Notably, the record does not show that Cowen gave Bloomberg its indications. "
1967,10," InterVest contends that the District Court erred in granting Cowen's motion for summary judgment on its claim that Cowen 
tortiously interfered with InterVest's contract with Bloomberg. HN17[
] The elements of InterVest's tortious interference with 
contract claim are: (1) the existence of a contractual relationship; (2) Cowen's intent to harm InterVest by interfering with its 
contractual relations; (3) the impropriety of the interference; and (4) harm resulting from Cowen's conduct.  Windsor Securities, 
Inc. v. Hartford Life Ins. Co., 986 F.2d 655, 663 (3d Cir. 1993). Cowen contends that even if InterVest can establish the 
existence of a contract with Bloomberg, and Cowen's intent to harm InterVest by interfering with the contract, InterVest cannot 
prove the last two factors. HN18[
] When evaluating the ""impropriety of the interference"" with a contract, Pennsylvania courts have adopted the following guidelines derived from the Restatement (Second) of Torts § 767, which (inserting the parties' names) are: (a) the nature of Cowen's conduct, (b) Cowen's motive, (c) the interests of InterVest, (d) the interests sought to be advanced by Cowen, (e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of Cowen and the contractual interests of InterVest, (f) the proximity or remoteness of Cowen's conduct to the interference, and (g) the relations between Cowen and InterVest. "
1968,," Windsor Securities, 986 F.2d at 663. Comment c. to § 767 of the Restatement provides that the ""nature of the actor's conduct is a chief factor in determining whether 
the actor's conduct is improper or not, despite harm to the other person."" To support its claim, InterVest only proffers evidence of 
an alleged complaint by Cowen to Bloomberg about InterVest, a practice which is not improper under antitrust law as explained 
above. While it is possible that conduct insufficient to establish an antitrust violation might still be actionable under a tortious 
interference with contract claim, see  Yeager's Fuel Oil v. Pa. Power & Light Co., 953 F. Supp. 617, 667 (E.D. Pa. 1997), 
InterVest provides no reason why Cowen's alleged complaint was an improper action. Instead, InterVest supplies the analogy that ""Cowen's actions in the Bloomberg termination of InterVest are comparable to 
Company A calling the power utility and pressuring it to turn off the power of its competitor, Company B."" The utility of this 
analogy is limited because it does not look at the nature of Cowen's actions but rather at the effect they had on InterVest, 
assuming that this analogy is even appropriate under the facts of this case. We do not think that HN19[
] evidence of only the 
existence of a complaint, without any accompanying threats or real ""pressure,"" is proof of an action of the nature that rises to an 
improper interference in contractual relations. At all events, the Restatement does not indicate that ""pressure"" is per se a tort, 
but rather instructs a court to look at the nature and context of the pressure. For example, comment c. to § 767 states: The question whether [economic] pressure is proper is answered in the light of the circumstances in which it is exerted, the 
object sought to be accomplished by the actor, the degree of the coercion involved, the extent of the harm that it threatens, 
the effect upon neutral parties drawn into the situation, the effects upon competition, and the general reasonableness and 
appropriateness of this pressure as a means of accomplishing the actor's objective. Because InterVest cannot point to any threats made by Cowen against Bloomberg and can only refer to vague ""complaints"" or 
""pressure,"" we do not believe that InterVest has presented a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Cowen's conduct was 
improper. Moreover, InterVest does not attempt to argue in this appeal that Cowen's conduct was the proximate cause of harm, 
although, as noted in the context of antitrust injury above, this issue was not addressed by the District Court because it did not 
need to reach it. "
1976,1," For ease of reference, the court will refer to ""Dentsply"" when discussing corporate conduct, and will refer to ""Trubyte"" only

2055,1," On March 4, 2003, Appellees filed a Motion to Strike. Insofar as the motion seeks to strike Appellants' proposed addendum to 
their reply brief, the motion is granted. The motion is denied in all other respects. Additionally, this court denies Appellants' 
request for costs related to the preparation of its Motion to Strike and its Motion to Have Joint Appendix Corrected. "
2058,2," Because we find that Appellants have failed to establish a relevant product market, as explained below, we need not consider 
whether their evidence is sufficient to establish the necessary geographic markets."
2058,3," Appellants also seek to rely on the testimony of their proposed expert witness, Mr. James Shaffer. The district court correctly 
ruled, however, that Shaffer is unqualified to offer expert testimony as an economist on the establishment of relevant product or 
geographic markets. While Shaffer has an MBA and significant executive experience in the newspaper industry, he subscribes 
to no economics journals, and, as of the date of his first deposition, could not name any economics journals. Needless to say, he 
has not published any economics-related articles. He is also unfamiliar with basic terminology and concepts used by economists 
who work on antitrust cases. Furthermore, Shaffer admitted that he had never conducted a relevant market analysis, and that 
any reading he had done on the subject came from materials provided to him by Appellants' attorneys."
2058,4," We note that the document ""appears to be"" an advertising flier, because Appellants have failed to lay a foundation for the 
introduction of this document into evidence, and its origins are not clear. There are similar admissibility problems with much of 
Appellants' documentary evidence. Even assuming that this evidence would be admissible at trial, however, it still fails to aid 
Appellants in their effort to establish a relevant product market. "
2059,5," HN9[
] The elements of an essential facilities claim are: (1) control of the facility by a monopolist; (2) a competitor's inability 
reasonably to duplicate the facility; (3) denial of the use of the facility to a competitor; (4) feasibility of providing the facility to the 
competitor. Laurel Sand & Gravel, Inc. v. CSX Transportation, Inc., 924 F.2d 539, 544 (4th Cir. 1991). "

2063,2," Plaintiffs initially asserted claims under the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act, Miss. Code Ann. §§ 75-24-1 et seq. They now 
concede, however, that the Consumer Protection Act does not create a private right of action for claims based on anticompetitive 
conduct."
2063,3, The MAA was initially enacted in 1900. The language of the MAA remains almost entirely unchanged. (See Def.'s Tab 1.) 
2064,4," Plaintiffs cite Moore ex rel. Mississippi v. Abbott Lab., 900 F. Supp. 26 (S.D. Miss. 1995), for the proposition that the highest 
court in Mississippi has not determined whether ""Mississippi antitrust law is limited to intrastate conspiracies."" Id. at 32. That is 
true to the extent that Standard Oil found the MAA to be applicable to an illegal agreement that was both interstate and intrastate 
in nature and was accomplished at least in part by transactions that were wholly intrastate. In any event, Moore was a removal 
case which did not directly determine the scope of the MAA's coverage. I also note that HN3[
] limiting state antitrust statutes to intrastate is consistent with the jurisprudence of other states. For 
example, in Arnold v. Microsoft Corp., No. 00-CI-00123, 2001 WL 193765 (Ky. Cir. Ct. July 21, 2000), aff'd,2001 Ky. App. LEXIS 
1311, No. 2000-CA-002144-MR, 2001 WL 1835377 (Ky. T. App. 2001), motion for review denied, No. 2002-SC-0116-D (Ky. 
2002), the court held that Kentucky's antitrust statute was limited to intrastate commerce. Id. at *9. The court noted: When a national company commits an anticompetitive act, it is certain to have at least some impact on at least one 
Kentucky resident. To use that as a means to bring a company's national or global operations under Kentucky law smacks 
of overreaching. This Court declines to do so. Id."
2064,5," Because I am dismissing Plaintiffs' MAA claims, it is unnecessary for me to determine whether punitive damages are available 
under the MAA. "
2065,6," Plaintiffs seem to suggest that they may assert a civil conspiracy claim under Mississippi law based upon alleged violations of 
federal law and the laws of other states. They have not, however, cited any authority to support this far-reaching proposition and, 
absent such authority, I am not prepared to accept it. "

jurisdictions allow individual indirect purchaser actions, while others limit the right to sue to the attorney general as parens

the court elected to follow Illinois Brick.  Blewett, 938 P.2d at 846."
2076,8," The dissent argues that the issue is not one of standing, but rather one of injury. See Dissent PP52-53. We import our 
terminology from the academic literature, which speaks of the problem in terms of standing, and view the question as deciding 
who may sue. See Joseph P. Bauer, The Stealth Assault on Antitrust Enforcement: Raising the Barriers for Antitrust Injury and 
Standing,  62 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 437 (2001); Roger D. Blair & Jeffrey L. Harrison, Reexamining the Role of Illinois Brick in Modern 
Antitrust Standing Analysis,  68 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1 (1999); William M. Landes & Richard A. Posner, Should Indirect 
Purchasers Have Standing to Sue Under the Antitrust Laws? An Economic Analysis of the Rule of Illinois Brick,  46 U. Chi. L. 
Rev. 602 (1979). While the Supreme Court describes the question as deciding who has been injured,  431 U.S. at 729, the Court 
does not allow indirect purchasers ever to show how or whether they have suffered an antitrust injury, but rather cuts off their 
right to sue. We therefore think the standing terminology fairly describes the issue. "
2080,9," The Supreme Court also reasoned that antitrust suits were more apt to be brought if damages were concentrated in direct 
purchasers.  Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 745-46, 97 S. Ct. at 2074. We are not convinced that this is so. An auto dealer who relies 
on the manufacturer for delivery of popular models of cars does not strike us as likely to sour the relationship with the 
manufacturer by suing over a price increase, especially if it can pass along overcharges to purchasers. In such a case, the 
indirect purchaser is the truly injured party, and likely the only party with impetus to sue to redress the antitrust injury. "
2081,*," Pursuant to Article 6, Section 3 of the Arizona Constitution, the Honorable Wallace R. Hoggatt, Judge of the Cochise County 
Superior Court, was designated to sit on this case. "
2083,10," The majority also concludes that, if the federal guidance clause signals that the legislature intended that we follow federal law 
at all, it could only have intended to follow the law as it existed when Arizona adopted the Arizona Antitrust Act. Op. P11. I 
discern no basis for concluding that the legislature intended to adopt an antitrust law frozen in time as of 1974. I think it more 
likely that the legislature intended that the federal guidance clause act as a fluid provision to keep Arizona law consistent with 
developing federal antitrust law."
2083,11," The Court pointed out that Arizona's statutory cause of action ""generally follows"" mirrored section 4 of the Clayton Act and that 
the language could be construed as either permitting or prohibiting indirect purchaser suits.  ARC America, 490 U.S. at 98 n.3."
2083,12," The Court reaffirmed this principle in Blue Shield of Va. v. McCready, in which the Court proceeded with a standing analysis 
only after holding that a health care plan subscriber suffered an antitrust injury at the hands of her insurance company.  457 U.S. 
465, 483-84, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149, 102 S. Ct. 2540 (1982) (holding that insurer's practice of reimbursing members for psychiatrist "
2084,," treatment but not psychologist treatment constituted an antitrust violation in which members were directly injured because they 
were unable to obtain their treatment of choice). "
2087,*," Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except 
under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4."
2087,2," Defendants Paramount Home Video, Inc.; Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Inc.; Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P.; 
Columbia Tri-Star Home Video, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc.; and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Home 
Entertainment, Inc. (collectively ""studios"" or ""studio defendants"")."
2087,3," Under revenue sharing agreements, studios lease tapes to retailers for lower upfront payments in return for a percentage of 
their revenues. Under ""cherry pick"" revenue sharing agreements, retailers are permitted to choose the specific tapes it wanted to 
purchase on a title by title basis. ""Output"" revenue sharing agreements, by contrast, require the retailer to acquire all titles a 
studio releases, regardless of box office performance and local market considerations. "
2088,4, Id. (citing FED. R. CIV. P. 50(a)(1)).
2088,5," Plaintiffs also reference various internal memoranda making somewhat similar points. A 1997 Fox memorandum described the 
Blockbuster proposal as creating a favored revenue share relationship. The mere use of the word ""favored"" to describe a 
proposed business relationship, however, does not strongly support an inference of conspiracy, especially where, as plaintiffs 
concede, other large chain retailers eventually arranged similar deals. "
2089,," Plaintiffs also point to two Warner memos that evidenced concern over industry backlash to the Blockbuster proposal and the 
possibility that its terms ""could spur government inquiry into video pricing practices."" Fear of the possible implications of the deal 
do not support an inference of conspiracy to exclude the independents. Finally, a Disney memo stated that the company hoped to extend the Blockbuster terms to other key retailers, but apparently not 
to independent retailers. That memo does not imply that the decision not to extend the terms to independents was influenced by 
Blockbuster or another studio. In fact, none of these memos even indirectly refers to an agreement between the studios or to an 
unlawful request by Blockbuster to exclude independents."
2089,6," Because plaintiffs allege horizontal and vertical theories of conspiracy, the unlawful agreement could be either among the 
studios generally or between each individual studio and Blockbuster."
2089,7," This is true regardless of whether Blockbuster wrongfully requested preferential treatment because, even in the face of such 
requests, a company's decision to take actions that are in its own interest cannot support an inference of conspiracy. See Viazis, 
314 F.3d at 764; Matrix Essentials, Inc. v. Emporium Drug Mart, Inc., 988 F.2d 587, 594 (5th Cir. 1993); Lovett v. Gen. Motors

2090,11," Plaintiffs also requested injunctive relief under parallel California statutes. See CAL. BUS. & PROF. CODE §§ 16750(a), 
17078-80, 17203. Like their federal counterpart, these statutes authorize injunctive relief only against violations of the law. "
2106,1," The Fourth Circuit's analysis in Dickson applied the ""Rule of Reason"" to evaluate the potential restraint on trade. 309 F.3d at 
205-06. The court determined that ""because the possibility of anticompetitive effects resulting from either licensing agreement is 
not obvious,"" the Rule of Reason approach was proper. Id. at 205 (emphasis added). The same is true in this case. Based on 
the cross-complaint, it is not obvious whether any individual exclusivity arrangement would have an anticompetitive effect on 
interstate commerce because it is unclear whether any of the alleged supplier-conspirators held an appreciable share of the 
supply market. "
2107,2, The content of paragraphs 13 and 17 is detailed infra. 
2108,3," In paragraph 18 (Count I) and again in paragraph 21 (Count II), Tidewater states that as a result of Masco East's alleged 
conduct, Tidewater has been ""injured in its business and property, has suffered a loss of profits in the market, and has sustained 
damages to its reputation and goodwill."" This boilerplate allegation of damages does not save Tidewater's complaint. Like the 
allegations of Masco East's alleged violations of § 1 the Sherman Act, these allegations are too vague and conclusory to 
withstand a motion to dismiss when read in conjunction with the substantive allegations of the counterclaim. Though this general 
allegation of harm might be sufficient in a case in which somewhat specific facts were alleged that could give rise to these types 
of damages, that is not the case here. "
2116,1," Soundview's assertions regarding the 42 other patents supposedly implicated by the Non-Soundview Parties' activities fail to 
satisfy either of these two prongs, given the absence of any evidence in the record that Soundview has some beneficial interest

2131,7," In Huckle v. Money, 95 Eng. Rep. 768 (K.B. 1763), oft-cited as the earliest reported case articulating the concept of ""exemplary 
damages"" as a distinct legal doctrine, plaintiff sued agents of the government for false imprisonment, trespass and assault 
arising out of a purportedly unlawful warrant issued for the arrest and prosecution of the publishers and writers of a newspaper 
article critical of the King. The jury awarded plaintiff damages of 300 pounds, an amount considerably larger than the actual 
harm plaintiff had suffered. The court, stating that the jury had ""done right in giving exemplary damages"" noted that ""the small 
injury done to the plaintiff, or the inconsiderableness of his station and rank in life did not appear to the jury in that striking light in 
which the great point of law touching the liberty of the subject appeared to them at trial …."" Id. at 769. In a companion case, "
2132,," Wilkes v. Wood, 98 Eng. Rep. 489 (K.B. 1763), plaintiff, the editor of the offending newspaper, asked for a large award of 
exemplary damages to punish and deter such outrageous misconduct, arguing that a verdict limited only to actual damages 
would be inadequate to serve those purposes. Id. at 500-01. The jury awarded him 1000 pounds. Id. at 490."

the awarding of double, treble and quadruple damages for particular wrongs. See id."
2132,9," See Rustad and Koenig, supra, at 1286 (noting that the early Romans employed multiple damages ""to constrain wealthy elites""

2132,11," While conceptually the punitive sanction is a byproduct of this disproportionality, in practice, as elaborated below, its 
imposition is circumscribed by a counterveiling principle of proportionality. The doctrine of proportionality as it relates to 
exemplary damages was adopted and articulated in early Supreme Court jurisprudence. See Gore, 517 U.S. at 575 (quoting "

J., dissenting)(""Courts long have recognized that jurors may view large corporations with great disfavor …. Corporations are 
mere abstractions and, as such, are unlikely to be viewed with much sympathy. Moreover, they often represent a large 
accumulation of productive resources; jurors naturally think little of taking an otherwise large sum of money out of what appears 
to be an enormously larger pool of wealth. Finally, juries may feel privileged to correct perceived social ill stemming from 
unequal wealth distribution by transferring money from 'wealthy' corporations to comparatively needier plaintiffs."") (internal 
citations omitted). "
2135,14," As one court put it, the law relating to exemplary damages ""tends to elevate the jury as a responsible instrument of 
government, discourages private reprisals, restrains the strong, influential and unscrupulous, vindicates the right of the weak, 
and encourages recourse to, and confidence in, the courts of law by those wronged or oppressed by acts or practices not 
cognizable in, or not sufficiently punished, by the criminal court."" Luther v. Shaw, 157 Wis. 234, 147 N.W. 18, 20 (Wis. 1914). "
2136,15," In fact, until later evolution of theories of compensatory damages, punitive damages operated to permit recompense for 
intangible and not readily quantifiable injuries, such as pain and suffering and emotional distress, that were not recognized under 
the narrower prevailing concept of compensatory recovery. See Cooper Indus., 532 U.S. at 437 n.10 (citing Haslip, 499 U.S. at 
61 (O'Connor, J., dissenting)). "
2137,16," See also Rustad and Koenig, supra, at 1322-23 (""The possibility of being awarded punitive damages encourages plaintiffs to 
act as 'private attorneys general' and provides incentives for plaintiffs to sue in instances where conduct has caused widespread 
harm. Punitive damages permit the litigation of claims that might otherwise be too expensive for an individual plaintiff to 
prosecute, and they serve as 'bounty' for the plaintiff."") (citations omitted); Owen, Punitive Damages in Products Liability 
Litigation, supra, at 1287-95."
2137,17," The incentive role may be somewhat problematic in some cases, however. Where the litigation involves multiple claims arising 
out of the same core events, some based on common law and some on statutory actions that authorize recovery of attorney's 
fees and costs, a common law punitive award that may reflect litigation costs as an unspecified component of harms suffered 
and burdens incurred may be duplicated where plaintiff later separately seeks recovery of fees and costs authorized by statute."

2143,20," The jury's original award of $ 2.6 million in compensatory and $ 145 million in punitive damages was reduced by the trial court 
to $ 1 million and $ 25 million respectively. On appeal, the Utah Supreme Court reinstated the $ 145 million punitive award, citing 
State Farm's ""massive wealth,"" and evidence that because State Farm's reprehensible policy in question was clandestine, it 
would be punished at most in only one out of every 50,000 cases, and that State Farm could have faced $ 10,000 in criminal 
penalties for every act of fraud, as well as the suspension of its license to conduct business in Utah. See id. at 1519. "
2144,21," The Gore Court noted that current federal law allows or mandates imposition of multiple damages for a wide assortment of 
offenses, including violations of antitrust laws, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and breaches of the 
trademark and patent laws. See 517 U.S. at 581 n.33. "
2145,22," The disparities may occur not necessarily on account of nefarious designs or purposeful derelictions of duties on the part of 
trial courts or jurors. Rather, as is evident from the discussion here, the matrix of considerations relevant to the assessment of 
the proper degree of retribution and deterrence called for to redress a particular wrongdoing is complex and extensive. Despite 
the labyrinthian design that defines the jury's task in this regard, the skeletal instruction jurors receive is not always sufficiently 
calibrated to take account of all the fine points and pertinent distinctions that may enter into and adequately shape or constrain 
the size of a punitive award. To the combination of a highly intricate function amid imprecise guidance, is added the third 
dimension of this quandary. the jury's vast latitude to decide the size of the compensation and corresponding penalties they 
assess. Given their broad discretion in this elaborate context, as a general matter some jurors may easily conflate the purposes of the 
remedial awards they render. They may overstate or understate the weight of a particular factor, or not sufficiently fine-tune 
application of a given standard, so as to differentiate, among the aggravating considerations that necessarily expand 
reprehensibility, which of them should properly yield larger penalties. In consequence, some punitive awards may be larger than 
necessary because they may not adequately distinguish between, for example, punitive damages in respect of misconduct that 
involves malicious acts motivated by animus in a personal relationship and causing severe physical injuries, and awards for 
harms that arise out of a purely commercial transaction and produce primarily economic damages; or between penalties 
imposed to redress injuries to a single plaintiff as opposed to awards rendered to remedy multiple actual or potential claims and 
much more extensive public and private harms. Conceivably, some jurors who may have heard anecdotal accounts of other 
large verdicts might be swayed to rely upon those numbers as a yardstick of what their broad latitude would allow, without the 
benefit of the entire range of relevant variables that might account for unique differences that may have justified greater 
penalties in other well-publicized cases and that may compel distinct treatment of the verdict before them."
2145,23," The parties here argue over whether State Farm enumerates four or five factors to be weighed in assessing reprehensibility. 
This Court reads the specific considerations the State Farm Court enunciated as sub-categories of the three elements classified 
here. See 123 S. Ct. at 1521. "
2146,24," See, e.g., Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore, Servs. Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81-82, 140 L. Ed. 2d 201, 118 S. Ct. 998 (1998) (in sexual 
harassment cases the inquiry into whether allegedly discriminatory conduct is actionable ""requires careful consideration of the 
social context in which particular behavior occurs and is experienced by its target …. The real social impact of workplace 
behavior often depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships which are not fully 
captured by a simple recitation of the words used or the physical acts performed."" In an illustration that underscores the 
overarching relevance and import of context as it affects the legal classification of particular behavior, the Oncale Court 
remarked: ""A professional football player's working environment is not severely or pervasively abusive, for example, if the coach 
smacks him on the buttocks as he heads onto the field -- even if the same behavior would reasonably be experienced as 
abusive by the coach's secretary (male or female) back at the office."" Id. at 81. "
2147,25," In fact, HN19[

Vivendi International or Vivendi Universal that were alluded to in testimony and documents in this action, or as to the positions 
held by some of the executives of these companies whose names were mentioned. Accordingly, where the record is unclear, the 
Court uses the generic name ""Universal"" or ""Universal Group"" to refer to whatever may be the proper corporate entity. "
2152,28," See generally Rustad and Koenig, supra, at 1292-96 (""Courts frequently assessed punitive damages against bullies who 
oppressed the physically weak and socially powerless …. The awarding of exemplary damages was one of the few effective 
social control devises used to patrol large powerful interests unimpeded by the criminal law.""). "
2153,29," In Browning-Ferris, plaintiff had been a local manager of defendant, a subsidiary of a nationwide waste-collection and disposal 
business. Plaintiff resigned and went into business for himself in competition with his former employer, in time succeeding in 
capturing a substantial portion of the market previously served solely by defendant. In response, defendant launched a 
campaign to drive plaintiff out of business, directing the local office to: ""'put [plaintiff] out of business. Do whatever it takes. 
Squish him like a bug', [and if] 'it meant give the stuff away, give it away.'"" Id. (citation omitted; internal quotations omitted). 
Plaintiff's revenues thereafter dropped substantially and he sued defendant for federal antitrust law violations and common law 
claims of tortious interference with contractual relations. The jury returned a verdict of $ 51,146 in compensatory damages and $ 
6 million in punitive damages. The trial court trebled the damages and added attorneys fees and costs on the federal claim, or 
alternatively awarded $ 6,066,082.74 in compensatory and punitive damages on the state-law claim. Defendant appealed the 
punitive award as an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The Second Circuit affirmed the judgment as not so 
disproportionate as to be constitutionally excessive even if the Eighth Amendment applied. In the Supreme Court, the judgment 
was challenged as unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
The Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment did not apply to civil penalties and did not rule on the due process 
challenge because that ground had not been raised in the lower courts. See id. "
2156,30," See Gore, 517 U.S. at 591 (Breyer, J., concurring) (""This factor … is not necessarily intended to act as a significant constraint 
on punitive awards. Rather, it provides an open-ended basis for inflating awards when the defendant is wealthy …. That does 
not make its use unlawful or inappropriate; it simply means that this factor cannot make up for the failure of other factors, such 
as 'reprehensibility,' to constrain significantly an award that purports to punish a defendant's conduct."") (emphasis in original);

2159,34," Bogle entailed a claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging systematic intentional racial discrimination by a public employer. 
The Court affirmed punitive damages awards in ratios of approximately 4 to 1 where the compensatory damages were awarded 
for mental and emotional injuries. See 332 F.3d at 1359-1362. In Willow Inn, the plaintiff, described as a modest family-run 
business which also served as the residence of some family members, was awarded $ 2,000 in compensatory damages and $ 
150,000 in punitive damages against the defendant insurance company for a delay of more than two years in paying plaintiff's 
insurance claim for damage caused to plaintiff's property during a windstorm. The Court found that plaintiff had repeatedly 
pursued payment of the claim and that defendant did not dispute coverage. In fixing the punitive award, the court adopted an 
amount approximately equal to the value of plaintiff's claim under the policy and the payment plaintiff ultimately received. See 
2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9558, 2003 WL 21321370 at *1-*3. In Eden Electrical, plaintiff was awarded $ 2.1 million in compensatory 
damages and $ 17.875 million in punitive damages on claims of fraudulent misrepresentation. The court noted that defendant's 
scheme was devised in return for a sham distributorship that would be terminated once defendant was paid $ 2.4 million by 
plaintiff in respect of obligations owed by the prior distributor. See 258 F. Supp. 2d at 966. The court, though finding that the 
harm involved was purely economic, noted that ""it can hardly think of a more reprehensible case of business fraud."" Id. at 974. 
Nonetheless, applying State Farm, it reduced the punitive award to $ 10 million, in part taking into account defendant's net 
worth. The court also observed that plaintiff, though apparently not a business of the scale of defendant, was a successful, 
sophisticated businessman who could not be considered a financially vulnerable party. See id. at 970."
2159,35," See, e.g., the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a); the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1117(a); the Racketeer Influenced and

2163,36," Despite so holding, however, the Second Circuit in Mathie went on to reduce the size of the punitive damages award at issue 
in that case based on reasons independent of the defendant's limited financial resources, applying instead applicable guidance 
propounded by the United States Supreme Court. See Mathie, 121 F.3d at 816-17. "
