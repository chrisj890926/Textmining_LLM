23,1," With respect to the Sherman Act claims, the Direct Purchasers seek injunctive relief and (treble) damages, while the Indirect 
Purchases seek only injunctive relief. (Id. P 131.)"
23,2," The Court denied as moot Defendants' motion to dismiss the Indirect Purchasers' state law claims. (See Feb. 20, 2008 Order at 
5 (""Because, in a separate Order issued simultaneously herewith, the Court denies certification of a class of Indirect Purchasers 
under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, this aspect of Defendants' motion is denied as moot."").) Five individual Indirect Purchasers remain in the case: (i) Brenda Caldarelli, ""a resident of Los Angeles County, California""; (ii) 
Alberta Lopez, ""a resident  [*8] of Los Angeles County, California""; (iii) Carrie Pardy, ""a resident of Los Angeles County, 
California""; (iv) Gary Freed, ""a resident of Monmouth County, New Jersey""; and (v) Neil Schwam, ""a resident of New York 
County, New York."" (See Compl. PP 24-28.)"
23,3," Defendants also argue that ""Dr. Tinari's proposed damage[s] testimony should be excluded for the reasons set forth in the 
Court's Order of February 20, 2008 denying class certification"" and that ""Del Monte is entitled to summary judgment against the 
individual [I]ndirect [P]urchasers for the [same] reasons set forth . . . above."" (Defs. Mem. at 44.) "
24,4," The Daubert Hearing included the cross-examination and redirect examination of Dr. Cotterill, as Plaintiffs had submitted Dr. 
Cotterill's expert report in lieu of his direct testimony. It also included oral argument by counsel for the Direct Purchasers, 
Michael M. Buchman,  [*12] J. Douglas Richard, and counsel for Del Monte, David A. Barrett, and Carlos Sires. "
25,5," Plaintiffs in the instant case allege that Del Monte knew, prior to the filing of the Dole Action, that MD-2 plant material ""was 
legally available in the marketplace and Del Monte had given  [*17] its planting material away as gifts."" (Pls. 56.1 P 72.) "
26,6," Plaintiffs in the instant case allege that Del Monte was on notice prior to filing the patent infringement counterclaim in the Maui 
Action that the CO-2 patent was invalid based upon, among other things, Maui's sales of CO-2 pineapples as far back as 1973. 
(See Defs. 56.1 PP 80-81, 90-92; Pls. 56.1 PP 80-81, 90-92.)"
26,7," ""To demonstrate an attempted monopolization claim under Section 2, a plaintiff must establish: [i] that the defendant has

28,11," For purposes of the product market analysis, the Court is using the term ""MD-2"" to refer to ""fresh Gold pineapples in North 
America."" "
29,12," At the Daubert Hearing, Dr. Cotterill characterized the MG-1 and CO-2 as ""hypothetical test market pineapples"" which ""are not 
broadly distributed in a way that competes,"" (Hr'g Tr. at 33, 35), but he failed to provide sufficient facts or data to support this 
conclusion. See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex, Inc., No. 06 Civ. 1186, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63355, 2008

29,13," Under the Merger Guidelines, in determining a product market one considers ""a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm selling all 
of the product in that market [that] could charge significantly more than a competitive price, i.e., without losing so many sales to 
other products that its price became unprofitable[.]"" United States v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 163 F. Supp. 2d 322, 335 (S.D.N.Y.

31,14," For example, Plaintiffs argue that certain ""African pineapples cannot compete in the U.S. because they have no 'shelf-life', 
thereby making the production facilities of Costa Rican and Hawaiian growers unique."" (Pls. Opp'n at 30 (citing Cotterill Report 
at 14).) Plaintiffs cite to evidence that ""Champaka is a niche product"" because ""airlines . . . prefer it high acid content[,]"" (Cotterill 
Report at 10 (citation omitted)); that ""Golds are approximately twice as expensive as Champaka[s]""; and that an individual 
produce buyer from Meijer's supermarket sold ""over twice as many [Golds] as Champakas at twice the price,"" (Cotterill Report at 
9, 10 (citations omitted))."
31,15," Plaintiffs do not appear to put forth any evidence regarding  [*39] the seventh Brown Shoe factor, i.e., the existence of 
specialized vendors. (See Pls. Opp'n at 30.) "
32,16," United States Magistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger's thoughtful discovery order, dated January 4, 2007, denying Plaintiffs' 
motion to compel certain Del Monte documents pursuant to the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege provides 
interesting background for this analysis. See In re Fresh Del Monte Pineapple Antitrust Litig., No. 04-md-1628, 2007 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 1372, 2007 WL 64189, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2007); see also Order, dated Nov. 9, 2007 (Berman, J.) (""Plaintiffs' 
Objections [# 130] to Magistrate Judge Dolinger's Discovery Order, dated January 4, 2007, are denied""). Judge Dolinger 
concluded that Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims ""amount to little more than speculation supported by snippets of unreliable 
testimony and [are] undermined by the contextual evidence reflecting the corporate behavior of Del Monte."" 2007 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 1372, [WL] at * 16. The Court is mindful that ""the burden on a non-movant opposing summary judgment falls far below 
the standard of probable cause applicable"" to the crime-fraud exception. Sackman v. Liggett Group, Inc., 173 F.R.D. 358, 364 
(E.D.N.Y. 1997). "
34,17," The district court ultimately dismissed without prejudice Del Monte's Lanham Act claim because Del Monte ""failed sufficiently 
to allege the third and fourth elements -- that Dole's actions are likely to cause consumer confusion and that Del Monte was 
injured."" Del Monte Fresh Produce, 136 F. Supp. 2d at 1290. "
35,18," Because Del Monte's claims in the Dole and Maui Actions were not objectively baseless, the Court's ""analysis stops after the 
first prong of the  [*54] [sham litigation] test."" Baltimore Scrap Corp. v. David J. Joseph Co., 237 F.3d 394, 399 (4th Cir. 2001). "
36,19," The parties identify Dole, Maui, Chiquita, and certain independent growers in Costa Rica as the primary  [*60] sources of 
competition for the production and sale of MD-2 pineapples. (See Defs. Mem. at 31-35; Pls. Opp'n at 31-34; see also Cotterill 
Report at 18 (Dole, Chiquita and Maui were ""the most likely potential entrants to challenge Del Monte""), 19 (independent 
growers in Costa Rica were ""[a]nother set of players in the entry game"").) "
37,20," Dole was ""aware of what Del Monte was doing in the market, we were aware at some point that they had really stepped up 
their efforts to make the conversion [to the MD-2]. I made the decision not to step up at that particular point in time to really push 
it so that we would have some more time to study it. . . . [I]t had really been . . . a long kind of pondered look at things. If 
anything, we looked at things for too long."" (Goldfarb Decl. Ex. 19 at 32-33; see also id. at 45-47 (""At one point in time [in 1994], 
in a casual conversation I did say to the then president of Del Monte that I thought  [*64] that he had to be very careful with 
pineapples and that you run the risk of moving too quickly if you don't study the agronomic issues for quite some time.""), 88 (""So 
I would say up until maybe '96 or '97, we were looking at all different alternatives and we really didn't know the potential of what 
the different products would be."").) And, the record indicates that other Dole executives ""thought that the sweeter [i.e., MD-2] 
variety"" would ""never make it in the U.S.,"" until at least 1996 when Dole witnessed the successful introduction of Del Monte's 
MD-2 pineapple. (Goldfarb Decl. Ex. 26 at 170 (""Q: And when you saw that Del Monte was selling it in large quantities and that it 
was doing well, is that what prompted Dole to become interested in selling a yellow [e.g., MD-2] variety? A: That's correct.""); see 
also id. Ex. 16 at 61 (""[I]n 1997, I didn't believe that [the MD-2] would be more than a niche product.""); id. Ex. 20 at 56 (""Q: When 
did you first believe that the MD-2 was an important variety of pineapple? A: 1997 maybe.""); Decl. of Carl E. Goldfarb, dated 
Dec. 8, 2008 (""Goldfarb Reply Decl.""), Ex. 6 at 44.) "
40,21," Because the Indirect Purchasers' Sherman Act claims fail as a matter of law, Defendants' objections to Dr. Tinari's proposed 
damages testimony, (see Defs. Mem. at 44), are moot. See also In re Pineapple, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18388, 2008 WL 
5561873, at *6 (Dr. Tinari ""has not presented a reliable methodology for determining damages to the [proposed Indirect 
Purchaser] class."") (internal quotations and citations omitted)."
40,22, Neither parties' briefing papers appear to address the Indirect Purchasers'  [*78] state law claims. 
55,1," Insignia brought fourteen claims in its Amended Complaint, but the parties stipulated to the dismissal of defendant Albertson's 
from the case, and claims four and ten are therefore no longer at issue. (Docket No. 383.) "
58,2," On August 10, 2009, NAMI withdrew its motions in limine pending the Court's decision here and in anticipation of a future 
scheduling order."
58,3," NAMI seeks to exclude these damage estimates as provided by Insignia management. The Court finds, however, that the 
motion to exclude damages estimates is more properly considered  [**24] in a motion in limine regarding Dr. Overstreet's expert 
opinion. Accordingly, the motion is denied without prejudice to the extent it seeks to exclude the damages estimates that form 
the basis for Dr. Overstreet's opinion. "
59,4," During the same time period, NAMI claims that its in-store retail placements increased substantially and that revenue 
generated from sales to CPGs have increased from approximately $ 224 million to approximately $ 378 million. (Murphy Report, 
Docket No. 476, Ex. 1 at Ex. 2.) "
60,5, The Court addresses evidence of NAMI's monopsony power over retailers infra. 
61,6," Although NAMI has presented substantial evidence that it does not control prices, the Court agrees with Insignia for the 
purposes of summary judgment that there is adequate direct evidence that NAMI's exclusive retail contracts actually exclude 
competitors. Regardless, the Court need not further assess the sufficiency of the direct evidence, as there is at least a fact 
dispute concerning circumstantial evidence of NAMI's monopoly power in the relevant market."
61,7," However, ""[l]ike any other issue, market definition is subject to summary judgment if the plaintiffs fail to provide sufficient 
evidence from which a jury  [**33] could reasonably find in their favor."" Flegel, 4 F.3d at 690."
61,8," NAMI contends that this market definition should be rejected because it was not alleged in the Amended Complaint. The Court 
disagrees. NAMI cites PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 315 F.3d 101, 105-06 (2d Cir. 2002), in support of its contention, but 
PepsiCo did not turn on the plaintiff's ""narrowing"" of its definition of the relevant market at summary judgment. Rather, the district 
court rejected the definition because ""it was not substantiated by the evidence; and . . . it was not supported by the practical 
indicia enunciated in [Supreme Court precedent],"" and the appellate court  [**35] affirmed on those bases. Id. at 105-07. "
64,9," HN18[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides that ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 
U.S.C. ยง 1. "
68,10," NAMI and Insignia agreed that New York substantive law governs counterclaims 3, 4, 5, and 6."
68,11," Under Minnesota defamation per se law, general damages are presumed. Stuempges v. Parke, Davis & Co., 297 N.W.2d 252, 
259 (Minn. 1980). "
72,12," NAMI's counterclaims suggest that their disparagement allegations encompass a broader range of statements, including 
statements made to retailers that NAMI's exclusive contracts were unlawful and unenforceable. NAMI, however, only briefly 
mentions these statements in its analysis. (See NAMI's Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. for Summ. J., Docket No. 508 at 40, 45.) 
Regardless, the Court finds that those statements are not actionable. Insignia referred -- or admits that it referred -- retailers to 
information about a Department of Justice investigation into exclusivity provisions in in-store promotions contracts. To the extent 
that NAMI's evidence references the investigation, NAMI has not demonstrated that the statements were false. That is, there is 
no evidence that the Department of Justice was not conducting an investigation of exclusive in-store contracts. "
74,13," Although the Court ultimately determines that NAMI's unfair competition claim cannot survive because NAMI has failed to 
produce evidence of damages, the Court also notes its general suspicion that the unfair competition claim is merely duplicative 
of NAMI's other claims. See Insignia Sys. Inc. v. News Am. Mktg. In-Store, Inc., Civ. No. 04-4213, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76161, 
2007 WL 2893374, at *10 (D. Minn. Sept. 28, 2007); see also H.L. Hayden Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 879 F.2d 
1005, 1025 (2d Cir. 1989) (""[S]uch an amorphous cause of action is capable of mischievous application."" (internal quotation 
marks omitted)). "
83,1," The parties distinguish ""workgroup"" color printers--those intended for higher-volume business use--from lower-cost color ink-jet 
printers. "
84,2," Total inflation during this period was approximately 13%. (See Bureau of Labor Statistics, Inflation Calculator, 
http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm (last visited Sep. 24, 2009).) "
85,3," Consistent with the terms of the settlement agreement, the Court did not consider evidence related to Xerox's loyalty 
 [**14] rebate programs in deciding this motion. "
89,4," One such response provides a real-world example of the economic theory advanced by petitioner-defendant in Kodak. It reads: 
""The phaser is one of the biggest mistakes in equipment purchasing I've ever made. It makes strange noises all the time, is 
unreliable, and the ink sticks are far too expensive. I would NEVER buy one again or recommend one to anyone else."" (Iburg 
Dep. Ex. 2, at 5 (emphasis in original).) In addition to the evidence discussed in the text, Dr. Economides opines that ""Xerox printer owners are locked-in because (a) of 
high switching costs of buying a new printer; and (b) of the long useful life of printers."" (Economides Rep. P 45.) As this assertion 
is unsupported by data or analysis, it fails to create a genuine issue for trial. See Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, 
Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 311 (2d Cir. 2008) HN12[
] (""An expert's opinions that are without factual basis and are based on 
speculation or conjecture are . . . inappropriate  [**32] material for consideration on a motion for summary judgment.""). "
91,5," In view of this conclusion, the Court does not reach the question of whether Xerox willfully acquired or maintained monopoly 
power through changes to the design of its printers  [**38] and ink sticks. "
95,1," In its UCL claim, AMI has not alleged ""unlawful"" or ""fraudulent"" conduct. (Opp'n Br. 23.)"
95,2," The Cel-Tech caveat does not apply here. It excludes from the definition ""actions by consumers or by competitors alleging 
other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as 'fraudulent' or 'unlawful' business practices or 'unfair, deceptive, 
untrue or misleading advertising'"" Cel-Tech, 20 Cal. 4th at 187 n.12. AMI does not base its claim on its status as a consumer 
and does not allege fraudulent or unlawful practices, or false advertising. "
96,3," In fact, AMI's damages expert simply assumes that a victory on the UCL claim will allow AMI to recover all its costs as if the 
TDSF SOW was never consummated. (Venkatesan Decl. ISO Opp'n Mot. Summ. J. re. Joint Ownership, Ex. A at 19.) AMI's 
UCL claim is not a quasi-contract claim. AMI's UCL claim is based on ATS's alleged misconduct in promoting TDSF chillers to 
third parties, and whether resulted in unjust enrichment for ATS."
96,4," AMI contends that it has also requested injunctive relief against ATS's allegedly unfair business practices. However, the Prayer 
for Relief asks for ""Specific Performance enjoining ATS from any further sale or promotion of the TDSF technology . . . during 
the five-year Exclusivity Period up to and including April 2010."" (Docket No. 281 at 20.) It thus appears that the prayer for 
specific performance is brought under a contract theory and not under the UCL. In any case, the issue is moot, as the Court has 
found that AMI's UCL claim cannot withstand summary judgment on other grounds. "
98,5," As noted above, the testimony of Thayer and Christofferson on their understanding of the provision is irrelevant without any 
foundation that their understanding was communicated to AMI. At oral argument, AMI argued that Hellman's testimony should 
similarly be excluded because there was no evidence that he communicated his understanding to ATS. This is unpersuasive. 
AMI has cited no authority that evidence of a party's own contemporaneous understanding of a contract cannot be used against 
it because it was not communicated to the opposition. "
99,6," The Court does not reach the issues of whether the Exclusivity Period, set forth in Section 1.0 of Schedule 3 to the JDA, was 
triggered or whether AMI has presented sufficient evidence to show that ATS refused to supply the chillers. "
100,7," Indeed, that could be the only way that AMI's claim could survive summary judgment โ otherwise, they have no evidence that 
any other contractual provision survived expiration of the JDA and TDSF SOW, and no evidence that marketing started prior to 
expiration. "
107,1," The following airlines were named as defendants in plaintiffs' Amended Complaint: Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, Inc. (""Alaska""), 
Alaska Air Group, Inc. (""AAG""), ATA Airlines, Inc., American Airlines, Inc., America West Airlines, Inc., Continental Airlines Inc., 
Delta Air Lines, Inc., Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., Horizon Air Industries, Inc., Frontier Airlines, Inc., KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, 
Northwest Airlines, Inc., United Airlines, Inc., US Airways, Inc., and US Airways Group, Inc. "
108,2," For the purposes of this appeal, only United's bankruptcy is relevant. United filed its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on 
December 9, 2002, and the bankruptcy court confirmed its reorganization planon January 20, 2006."
108,3," Plaintiffs opted out of the putative class in Hall v. United Air Lines, Inc., 296 F. Supp. 2d 652 (E.D.N.C. 2003)."
108,4," The district court unintentionally omitted American from its identification of ""remaining Defendant airlines"" for the purposes of 
this holding. It is clear from the substance of the opinion however, that the district court did not intend to suggest that claims 
against American were any more meritorious than against Continental and United."
108,5," After the parties filed their appellate briefs, we were notified that Frontier and ATA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy under 11 
U.S.C. ยง 362(a)(1). The filing of a  [**9] bankruptcy petition operates as an automatic stay of the continuation of a judicial action 
against the debtor. Spirit Airlines, Inc. v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 431 F.3d 917, 921 n.1 (6th Cir. 2005) (HN1[
] automatic stay under ยง 362(a)(1) applies to appellate proceedings). Following oral argument, we also accepted the stipulated dismissal of 
defendants Delta, Northwest, and KLM. "
112,6," We recognize that Interstate Circuit was decided at a more advanced stage of the legal process, and we do not suggest that 
the same standards ought to be  [**24] applied on a motion to dismiss, even under Twombly. However, plaintiffs argue that they 
have alleged enough factual matter ""to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal"" circumstantial ""evidence of 
illegal agreement,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, analogous to the circumstantial evidence discovered in Interstate Circuit. Thus, 
we examine plaintiffs' complaint with an eye to any factual allegations that would make it ""reasonable"" to ""expect []"" that similar 
circumstantial evidence would surface during discovery. Id. "
113,7," We note that Re/Max Int'l, Inc. was an appeal from a grant of summary judgment. Here, our review is constrained by Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Nonetheless, plaintiffs argue they have put forth factualal legations that would make it reasonable to expect that 
discovery will reveal evidence of the Re/Max ""plus factors."" This analysis is instructive insofar as it illuminates the plausibility of 
defendants' lawful, unchoreographed free-market behavior. "
114,8," We note that plaintiffs opted-out of a class action that alleged an identical ยง 1 claim against these defendants. Hall v. United Air 
Lines, Inc., 296 F. Supp. 2d 652 (E.D.N.C. 2003),  [**32] aff'd sub nom. Hall v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 118 F. App'x 680 (4th Cir. 
2004). In Hall, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, finding ""overwhelmingly compelling evidence 
that the commission cuts and caps. . . were just as likely the result of competitive conduct and natural changes in the market as 
of the illegal conspiracy alleged by plaintiffs."" Id. at 671. Although a district court decision affirmed by the Fourth Circuit is not "
115,," authoritative in the Sixth Circuit, we think that the result in Hall is something we should at least consider (when analyzing 
plausibility), ""both for its persuasive power, and because it involves the same facts."" Premier Elec. Constr. Co. v. Nat'l Elec. 
Contractors Ass'n, Inc., 814 F.2d 358, 367 (7th Cir. 1987) (citation omitted) (considering Fourth Circuit decision in antitrust action 
involving defendants whose activities spanned more than one court of appeals). We also acknowledge the Seventh Circuit's 
statement in Premier, which warned, ""[o]nly the gravest reasons should lead [a] court in [an] opt-out suit to come to a conclusion 
that departs from that in the class suit."" Id. at 367-68."
115,9," Defendants assert that ""each percentage  [**33] point reduction in travel agent commissions was worth approximately $ 56 
million, and that by 2002, the combined value of the commission cuts was more than a billion dollars."" "
117,1," The Court has been careful to point out that Twombly should not be read to impose a ""probability requirement,"" or a 
""'heightened' pleading standard."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, 595 n. 14. The Court commented that an otherwise ""well-pleaded 
complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable, and that recovery is very 
remote and unlikely."" Id. at 556 (internal quotations omitted). "
119,2," See 21 Cong. Rec. 2460 (1889) (This inequality ""has grown within a single generation out of the concentration of capital into 
vast combinations to control production and trade and to break down competition."")."
119,3," A picture of the recent reversal of the long trend toward equality is as follows: [SEE FIGURE 1 The Top Decile Income Share, 1917-2007 IN ORIGINAL] Source: Table A1 and Table A3, col. P90-100. Income is defined as market income (and excludes government transfers). Top decile includes all families with annual income above $ 109,630 in 2007.

impact not merely in one way, but in every way."" THE LANDMARK HERODOTUS: THE HISTORIES 400 (Robert B. Strassler 
ed. 2007). ""The constitutional essential here is rather that below a certain level of material and social well-being, and of training 
and education, people simply cannot take part in society as citizens, much less equal citizens?it is what is required to give due 
weight to the idea of society as a fair system of cooperation between free and equal citizensโฆ."" JOHN RAWLS, POLITICAL 
LIBERALISM 166 (1993). "
126,1," As part of the MDL proceedings, the parties stipulated to much of the factual record on which summary judgment was decided. 
The parties have relied on that stipulation in these Motions for most of the relevant facts, and, thus, most of the facts are 
undisputed. However, to the extent that the Court has relied on evidence to which the parties have objected, the Court has 
considered and overruled those objections. As to the remaining objections, the Court finds that it is unnecessary to rule on those 
objections because the disputed evidence was not relied on by the Court."
126,2," Defendant invented and manufactures the branded drug Hytrin, which treats hypertension and enlargement of the prostate. 
Hytrin's active ingredient is terazosin hydrochloride. Over the years, Defendant has received patents covering terazosin 
hydrochloride, its pharmaceutical use, and its crystalline forms. "
127,3," Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the FDA issues tentative approval to a generic drug when it finds the drug would receive final 
approval for marketing but for a stay based upon the pendency of patent litigation. Novapharm and Geneva received tentative 
approval for terazosin tablets on November 26, 1996 and June 17, 1997, respectively. "
128,4," Professor Christopher R. Leslie, who is a strong advocate for consumer standing in Walker Process litigation, recognizes that 
courts have not granted such standing and cautions against granting unimpeded access to federal courts to pursue such claims. 
See, e.g., Christopher R. Leslie, The Anticompetitive Effects of Unenforced Invalid Patents, 91 Minn. L. Rev. 101, 166 fn. 296 
(Nov. 2006). Instead, Professor Leslie has suggested various alternatives, including follow-on cases and parens patrie actions 
by state attorney generals. See, e.g., Christopher R. Leslie, The  [*13] Role of Consumers in Walker Process Litigation, 13 Sw. 
J.L. & Trade Am. 281, 302-11 (2007); see, also, Robert G. Badal, John M. Landry & Kirk A. Hornbeck, Speculation, 
Overdeterrence, and Consumer Standing in Walker Process Litigation: A Response to Professor Leslie, 13 Sw. J.L. & Trade Am. 
325 (2007) (discussing why ""granting consumer standing in Walker Process claims is problematic even under traditional 
standing requirements""). "
130,5," Plaintiff cannot attempt to avoid the bar of the statute of limitations and save its claim by relying on the continuing violation 
theory because, as detailed above, all of the relevant alleged wrongful acts took place before October 27, 1999. Thus, under 
even Plaintiff's continuing violations theory, Plaintiff is not entitled to damages for any period after a generic had launched and 
Plaintiff had stopped purchasing from Defendant. See, e.g., Hennegan v. Pacifico Creative Serv., Inc., 787 F.2d 1299, 1301 (9th 
Cir. 1986) (where continuing violation existed, plaintiffs could recover only for injuries inflicted  [*19] within four years of the 
complaint)."
130,6," Plaintiff argues that the Bill of Particulars was not an amended complaint so the relation back analysis should never be 
reached. However, if the Bill of Particulars did not assert a new claim, Plaintiff's Walker Process claim would not be in this case 
at all. See, e.g., MedImmune, 427 F.3d at 967 (affirming dismissal of Walker Process claim that was not pled expressly in 
original complaint even though similar inequitable conduct claim was pled). "
131,7," Moreover, Plaintiff's argument that the statute of limitations was tolled because Plaintiff was a member of an indirect purchaser 
class action fails because Plaintiff provides no evidentiary support for its position. Hinton v. Pacific Enters., 5 F.3d 391, 395 (9th 
Cir. 1993) (""The burden of alleging facts which would give rise to tolling falls upon the plaintiff.""). For example, Plaintiff presents 
no evidence that it was even a member of the indirect purchaser/end-payor classes. See, e.g., Crown, Cork & Seal Co., Inc., v. 
Parker, 462 U.S. 345, 349-51, 103 S. Ct. 2392, 76 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1983) (finding that class action tolling is limited to ""class 
members""). To the contrary, Plaintiff has repeatedly asserted -- in this action and in other contexts -- that it is a direct purchaser 
that resells drugs to its members, and who buys ""other than for resale."" In addition, the indirect purchaser class action which 
Plaintiff claims tolls the statute of limitations on its Walker Process claim did not allege a Walker Process claim. Johnson v. 
Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U.S. 454, 467, 95 S. Ct. 1716, 44 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1975) (finding that class action tolling 
""depend[s] heavily on the fact that those filings involved exactly the same cause of action subsequently  [*24] asserted.""). Finally, Plaintiff's argument that Defendant waived its statute of limitations defense is unpersuasive. Defendant's Answer to 
Plaintiff's Complaint included a statute of limitations affirmative defense, which is ""sufficient to preserve the defense."" Tahoe-
Sierra Preservation Council, Inc., v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 216 F.3d 764, 788 (9th Cir. 2000). In addition, because 
Plaintiff first raised its Walker Process claim in its Bill of Particulars rather than a formal amended complaint, Defendant did not 
have the opportunity to re-allege its statute of limitations defense against the Walker Process claim in an amended answer. 
Moreover, Defendant was not required to raise this argument in either a prior motion or on appeal to avoid waiving it. See, e.g., 
Daingerfield Island Protective Soc'y v. Babbitt, 40 F.3d 442, 445, 309 U.S. App. D.C. 186 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (after defendant did 
not raise its statute of limitations defense in either its first motion for summary judgment or the subsequent appeal, the Court of 
Appeals found that defendant was allowed to raise the defense in a subsequent motion for summary judgment and had not 
waived it because defendant had ""raised the limitations defense in  [*25] its answer -- it was not required to reassert the defense 
in its [first] successful summary judgment motion."") "
152,1," See also S. Rep. 93-1131 (1974), as reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5843, 5863 (""the Committee did not want to exempt the 
futures industry from the antitrust laws . . . .""); 120 Cong. Rec. 30459 (daily ed. Sept. 9, 1974) (""In establishing this Commission, 
it is the committee's intent to give it exclusive jurisdiction over those areas delineated in the act. . . . However, it is not the intent 
of the committee to exempt persons in the futures  [**48] trading industry from existing laws or regulations such as the antitrust 
laws . . . ."")."
152,2," After Merrill, Congress amended the CEA to include an express private right of action. 7 U.S.C. ยง 25. "
153,3," The parties are content to use the Amended Complaint in the Arandell action and the Second Amended Consolidated Class 
Action Complaint in the Abelman Art Glass, Fairhaven Power Company, and Utility Savings and Refund Services, LLP actions 
as representative examples of Plaintiffs' Complaints in the various actions. The Court therefore will do the same."
153,4," Plaintiffs argue the CEA does not govern their physical purchases of natural gas. However, it is undisputed the CEA applies to 
Defendants' alleged  [**54] conduct which forms the basis of Plaintiffs' Complaints. "
154,5," Defs.' Reply P. & A. in Support of Mot. for J. on the Pleadings That All Antitrust Claims are Barred by the Commodity Exch. Act 
(Doc. #1433) at 9-10.) "
156,6," Defendants likely would contend this is because no such conspiracy existed, but the Court must accept the pleadings as true at 
this stage of the proceedings."
156,7," Section 25's private right of action against a registered entity, such as an exchange, is not relevant here."
156,8," Defendants' argument that permitting resort to the antitrust laws circumvents the CEA's limited remedies is unpersuasive. 
Congress has erected procedural hurdles that must be overcome to file certain securities claims such that permitting other 
actions to proceed would circumvent Congress's intent. See Credit Suisse, 551 U.S. at 284. However, Defendants point to no 
similar congressionally-mandated procedural requirements on persons seeking recovery under the CEA which would be 
circumvented by permitting resort to the antitrust laws. "
157,9," Other courts have reached a similar conclusion in attempting to determine whether the CEA preempts state antitrust laws. See 
Goldschmidt v. Hunt, 556 F. Supp. 123, 123 (N.D. Tex. 1983) (following on Strax and holding the CEA does not preempt 
antitrust claims); Strax, 524 F. Supp. at 941 (also rejecting argument that CEA preempted state antitrust laws). While not the 
same analysis as implied antitrust immunity, the doctrine of conflict preemption involves related considerations, such as whether 
""compliance with both federal and state requirements is impossible or whether, in light of the federal statute's purpose and 
intended effects, state law poses an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress's objectives."" Whistler Investments, Inc. v. 
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., 539 F.3d 1159, 1164 (9th Cir. 2008). "
159,1," In support of the instant motion, defendants offer the Declaration of Lisa Tenorio-Kutzkey, to which are attached exhibits that, 
according to defendants, contradict plaintiffs' allegations that banks have loaned Pfizer, Inc. money using ""TARP"" funds and that 
defendants together control 40% of the sales of prescription drugs. Plaintiffs argue that if the Court considers defendants' 
evidence, the Court should treat the instant motion as a motion for summary judgment. Based on the Court's finding that 
plaintiffs have failed to allege a cognizable claim, the Court finds it unnecessary to consider defendants' evidence. "
160,2," As discussed above, the only ""market"" identified in the complaint is the ""manufacture and sale of prescription pharmaceutical 
drugs."" (See Compl. P 29.)"
160,3," Defendants also argue plaintiffs have failed to allege sufficient facts to support a finding that harm to competition in the relevant 
market will result from the merger. In light of the Court's finding as to plaintiffs' failure to allege a cognizable product market, the 
Court does not reach these additional arguments. "
163,1," The programmer defendants are NBC Universal, Inc., Viacom, Inc., The Walt Disney Company, Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., 
and Turner Broadcasting Systems, Inc. (substituted for original defendant Time Warner, Inc.). The distributor defendants are 
Time Warner Cable, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Coxcom, Inc., The DirecTV Group, Inc., Echostar Satellite L.L.C., Charter 
Communications, Inc., and Cablevision Systems Corporation."
163,2," The TAC alleges a single claim for violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1. TAC ยถยถ 46-51."
163,3," The programmer defendants note that the distributor defendants have a filed a motion to dismiss the TAC on the ground that 
plaintiffs, as indirect purchasers of television programming, cannot under the Supreme Court's decision in Illinois Brick Co. v. 
Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), challenge the lawfulness of the agreements made between 
programmers and distributors. The programmer defendants argue in a motion joined in by the distributor defendants, that, "
164,," although the injury to competition issue is generally regarded as antecedent to the Illinois Brick issue, should the Court grant the 
indirect purchaser motion, the TAC should be dismissed as to all defendants because the programmer defendants are only 
indirect suppliers to plaintiffs. Mot. at 3. "
165,4," Plaintiffs define overcharge as ""the equivalent of a net loss of consumer welfare"" measured in terms of ""the additional amount 
consumers, in the aggregate, pay for the networks they want to watch as compared to what they would pay if separate pricing (a 
la carte offerings) were available . . . . Stated differently, in the 'but-for' world of free choice of networks, consumers in the 
aggregate would pay less than they do now for cable . . . and that difference is both the net consumer welfare loss and the 
measure of class damages."" Mot. at 1 n.1."
165,5," In support of this argument, plaintiffs rely on three cases: Theme Promotions, Inc. v. News Am. Mktg. FSI, 546 F.3d 991 (9th 
Cir. 2008); Ross v. Bank of Am., 524 F.3d 217 (2d Cir. 2008); and TYR Sport Inc. v. Warnaco Swimwear, Inc., 679 F. Supp. 
2d 1120 (C.D. Cal. May 27, 2009). These cases do not support plaintiffs' argument. In Theme, the plaintiff presented evidence of 
foreclosure of competition. There, the Ninth Circuit affirmed  [*15] the verdict in favor of the plaintiff on its Cartwright Act claims 
where the trial court had instructed the jury that in order to succeed on that claim, the plaintiff had to prove that the right of first 
refusal agreements at issue in that case ""foreclosed competition in a substantial share of the market."" Id. at 1002-1003. It was in 
that context, where substantial evidence supported the jury's finding to that effect, that the Ninth Circuit held that reduction of 
choice and higher prices constituted antitrust injury because that injury was the direct result of the antitrust violation. Id. at 1004-
1005. In Ross, the plaintiffs alleged that a horizontal agreement to require credit cardholders to arbitrate their claims caused 
direct injury to the plaintiffs by causing them to pay more for services provided by them to the defendants. The Second Circuit 
reversed the dismissal of plaintiffs' claim, holding that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged injury in fact sufficient to establish 
standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution. It was in this context that the Second Circuit held that ""reduced choice and 
diminished quality in credit services"" that resulted directly from its bank's  [*16] ""illegal collusion to constrict the options available 
to cardholders"" were sufficient to show Article III injury in fact. Ross, 524 F.3d at 223. In so doing, the Second Circuit rejected 
the argument that unless and until the arbitration clauses were invoked by the defendants, that any harm was too speculative to 
satisfy constitutional standing requirements. Ross thus involved horizontal collusion, and the Second Circuit specifically did ""not 
address the question of whether the cardholders' alleged injuries would survive antitrust standing analysis."" 524 F.3d at 223, 
225. In TYR Sport Inc. the court viewed plaintiff's claims as alleging a horizontal agreement to exclude competitors."
165,6," Consumer surplus is defined in plaintiffs' motion as ""the difference between what something is worth to consumers and the 
price they pay for it."" Mot. at 9. "
166,7," In his article, Professor Elhauge shows how tying and discounted product bundling contracts can operate to harm consumer 
welfare without proof of substantial foreclosure share or effect. One way this may be accomplished is by enabling a supplier with 
market power to profitably engage in price discrimination across buyers of the products in question. Plaintiffs provide the 
following hypothetical to illustrate this point:  [*18] ""Imagine a group of 200,000 consumers whose reservation prices for ESPN 
and Lifetime range from $0 to $20 per month, but have negatively correlated demand such that the combined reservation price 
for ESPN plus Lifetime is $20 per buyer. (In other words, a buyer who values ESPN at $5 values Lifetime at $15, one who 
values ESPN at $20 values Lifetime at $0, etc.). A firm that unbundled the pricing of the channels would maximize profits at a 
price of $10 per channel. In this scenario, buyers would enjoy a total consumer surplus of $1 million whereas, with bundled 
pricing (charging $20 for both ESPN and Lifetime), consumer surplus is $0."" Mot. at 9. "
168,8," Defendants acknowledge that in some circumstances tying is per se illegal, Surreply at 8 & n.7, but only in circumstances 
where the tie may foreclose some amount of competition in the tied product market. Id. (citing Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. 
U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494, 533 (3d Cir. 1998) (""Federal antitrust law is directed at protecting competition rather than 
individual competitors, and outlaws only those tying/reciprocal dealing arrangements that substantially foreclose competition in 
the tied product market. The market power requirement of the per se antitrust jurisprudence serves this goal since it is presumed 
that where the defendant exercises appreciable market power in the tying product market it can leverage that power to 
substantially foreclose competition in the tied product market."")). Defendants further argue that plaintiffs have expressly stated 
that they are not asserting any per se claims in this case. Id. (citing Reply  [*29] at 16 (""Rather than challenging the Defendants' 
conduct as a per se illegal tie, Plaintiffs here challenge the series of vertical agreements between programmers and distributors, 
which have horizontal effects, under the rule of reason."")). "
172,1," One day prior to issuance of the instant order, plaintiffs filed both a first amended complaint, and a request for dismissal with 
prejudice of defendants Guillory, Integrity Investment Group, LLC, Jeffrey Figone Properties, LLC, and Baldini Properties, LLC 
(the first amended complaint is alleged as to defendant American Home only). By separate order, thecourt grants plaintiffs' 
request for dismissal, thereby mooting the instant motion to dismiss brought by these defendants. However, in order to avoid any 
delay in issuing the instant order occasioned by plaintiffs' recent filings, the court issues the instant order notwithstanding those 
filings. To the extent the order disposes of arguments or claims in connection with the motion brought by those defendants 
whom plaintiffs seek to dismiss, such arguments are hereby deemed MOOT. "
206,1," Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references shall be to the Business and Professions Code."
206,2," Plaza signed a different agreement which contained a two-year noncompetition clause. After this lawsuit was filed, Plaza went 
to work for a third party and voluntarily dismissed his claims without prejudice. "
212,3," At our invitation, the parties submitted additional briefing on this case and another recent case mentioned by plaintiffs' counsel, 
Meyer v. Sprint Spectrum L.P. (2009) 45 Cal.4th 634, which is discussed infra in Part II at footnote 4. "
217,4," St. Jude's reliance on Meyer v. Sprint Spectrum L.P., supra, 45 Cal.4th 634 is unavailing since that case discussed the issue of 
standing under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) (Civ. Code, ยง 1750 et seq.), which requires the consumer to have 
suffered ""any damage"" (Civ. Code, ยง 1780, subd. (a)), rather than the UCL, which requires the claimant to have ""suffered injury 
in fact and ha[ve] lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition."" (ยง 17204.) "

230,7," The new Act is also known as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA). Costa v. Borges, 145 Idaho 353, 356, 179 P.3d 
316, 319 (2008). "
232,8," HN8[
] Former Idaho Code ยง 53-338(1) provided that when the dissolution did not breach the partnership agreement, ""each 
partner,  [***18] as against his copartners and all persons claiming through them in respect of their interests in the partnership, 
unless otherwise agreed, may have the partnership property applied to discharge its liabilities, and the surplus applied to pay in 
cash the net amount owing to the respective partners."" "
233,9," Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 306 (Barnes and Noble Books 1989) gives an example of the word ""condition"" 
used when it means ""a restricting, limiting, or modifying circumstance."" The example  [***21] is, ""It can happen only under 
certain conditions. (Italics in original; emphasis added.) "
240,10," On appeal, MRIA argues that all of its claims were asserted on behalf of MRI Center and MRI Mobile. It relies upon the 
following statement in its pleading: MRI Associates, LLP is an Idaho limited liability partnership (""MRIA""), which also acted as a general partner with 
management responsibilities for two operational entities, MRI Limited Partnership, known as MRI Center of Idaho 
 [***48] (""MRI Center"" or the ""Center""), and MRI Mobile Limited Partnership, known as MRI Mobile. MRIA brings this action 
on its own behalf, and as general partner for these operational entities; MRIA is entitled to and does hereby bring this action 
on behalf of these two limited partnerships. Unless otherwise referenced, the designation ""MRIA"" shall refer to all three 
entities: MRIA, MRI Center and MRI Mobile. Because it did not ""otherwise reference"" that ""MRIA"" did not include the limited partnerships in any of its claims except the fourth 
cause of action seeking damages for breach of fiduciary duty to the limited partnerships, MRIA is technically correct that all of its 
claims were asserted on behalf of the limited partnerships. However, the only mention of MRI Center and MRI Mobile in the jury 
instructions outlining the causes of action submitted to the jury was in connection with the breach of fiduciary duty claim. That 
was also the only claim in which the limited partnerships were mentioned on the special verdict form. Thus, the jury would not 
have known that MRIA was asserting all of the claims on behalf of the limited partnerships too. "
243,11," MRIA also contends that the district court erred in denying its motion to add a claim for punitive damages made after the close 
of the evidence. Idaho Code ยง 6-1604(2) requires a pretrial motion. "
244,12," One of the statutes, former Idaho Code ยง 48-101, provided, ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or 
conspiracy in restraint of trade of commerce, within this state, is hereby declared to be illegal."" When former section 48-101 was 
repealed, the legislature enacted new Idaho Code ยง 48-104, which provides, ""A contract, combination, or conspiracy between 
two (2) or more persons in unreasonable restraint of Idaho commerce is unlawful."" Ch. 148, ยง 3, 2000 Idaho Sess. Laws 377, 
378. The new statute adds the word ""unreasonable"" to modify restraint, so that its application is narrower than former section 48-
101. The other statute,  [***63] former Idaho Code ยง 48-104, was repealed and no similar statute was enacted in its place. "

276,1," The Court has included all references to the Original and Amended Complaint, where applicable, for purposes of 
completeness. In paragraphs where there are no references to the Original Complaint, the allegations are new to the Amended 
Complaint. Of course, the allegations of the Amended Complaint are the only allegations that are before the Court as the filing of 
the Amended Complaint supersedes the Original Complaint. "
278,2," For ease of reading, the Court has chosen not to indent and single space this lengthy quotation. "

287,4," In the Original Complaint,  [*43] the Prayer for Relief also included ""that Highmark be ordered to contract with West Penn 
Allegheny on fair and equitable terms, including the end of any discrimination in reimbursement (both direct and indirect) 
between UPMC and West Penn Allegheny."" Complaint, Prayer for Relief, P 2. Under either Prayer for Relief, West Penn 
Allegheny is asking the Court to order Highmark to pay more funds to West Penn Allegheny which would increase, not decrease, 
the cost to consumers. See infra, Discussion (Section VII, B(2) - - Failure to Allege Antitrust Injury regarding Reimbursement 
Rates)."
287,5," The Original Complaint also contained language in the Prayer for Relief seeking the Court to order UPMC ""to discontinue its 
joint ventures with independent community hospitals."" Complaint, Prayer for Relief, P 3."
287,6," The aforementioned Prayer for Relief seems to be the only addition to the Prayer for Relief as set forth in the Original 
Complaint. However, the practical effect of new P 4 is in large part the same as the deleted language (from Original Complaint, 
Prayer for Relief, P 3) that UPMC be ordered to ""discontinue its joint ventures with independent community hospitals."" "
289,7," Most recently, in Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203 (3d Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third 
Circuit further elucidated the standard of review post Twombly and Iqbal. In Fowler, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 
reiterated that a district court should conduct a two-part analysis when reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. 
First, the factual and legal elements of the claim should be separated and the district court must accept all of the complaint's 
well-pleaded facts as true, but may disregard any legal conclusions  [*47] contained therein. Second, the district court must then 
determine, after drawing on its judicial experience and common sense, whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient 
to show that plaintiff has a ""plausible claim for relief."" 578 F.3d 203, 210-211, citing Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1949, 1950. "
293,8," The Court also notes that from time-to-time throughout the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has tried to allege ""antitrust injury"" by 
referencing alleged harm to consumers, thereby tacitly acknowledging  [*60] the potential deficiencies of its other allegations 
setting forth ""antitrust injury""."
293,9," Injuries to other parties do not provide a basis for a more remote victim to bring an antitrust action. Assoc. Gen. Contractors of 
Cali., Inc. v. Cali. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 537-44, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723. (1983).  [*62] ""The 
existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in 
antitrust enforcement diminishes the justification for allowing a more remote party . . .to perform the office of private attorney

296,10," As set forth in In re Flat Glass, an agreement to fix prices is a per se violation of the Sherman Act. 385 F.3d 350, 362 (3d Cir. 
2004). Plaintiff argues that because UPMC and Highmark are ""horizontal competitors"" in the market for health care financing 
and administration for private employers and individuals, this situation constitutes a ""per se unlawful market allocation 
agreement."" Plaintiff, however, argues alternatively, that the agreement is unlawful under the rule of reason. See Complaint, PP 
152-153; Amended Complaint, PP 224-225. "
297,11," The Court hereby incorporates the Section VI(B) regarding the ""Gatekeeper Function of the Court."""
297,12," In support of its (Original) Motion to Dismiss, Defendant UPMC has filed numerous newspaper articles documenting the 
adversarial relationship of the Defendants, and one article describing the efforts of Plaintiff in hiring ""dozens of star physicians"" 
from UPMC. Defendant UPMC asks this Court to take judicial notice of these published articles as were referenced in the 
Complaint without converting the motions to dismiss  [*78] into motions for summary judgment. Rule 201(b), Federal Rules of 
Evidence permits a district court to take judicial notice of facts that are ""not subject to reasonable dispute in that [they are] either 
(1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort 
to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Rule 201(b). Under Rule 201(d), Federal Rules of Evidence, a 
district court must take judicial notice ""if requested by a party and supplied with the necessary information."" Rule 201(d). In re "
298,," NAHC, Inc. Securities Litigation, 306 F3d 1314, 1331 (3d. Cir. 2002). The Court will take judicial notice of the full contents of 
these articles, including the Investor Conference Call Presentation, as well as the contractual exhibits attached to Highmark's 
motion to dismiss. The Court will not convert said motions into motions for summary judgment. "
300,13," This Court will take judicial notice of these written agreements without converting the motion to  [*86] dismiss into a motion for 
summary judgment. See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997); Lum v. Bank of America, 
361 F.3d 217, 222 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004) (""A document forms the basis of a claim if the document is integral to or explicitly relied 
upon in the complaint. The purpose of this rule is to avoid the situation where a plaintiff with a legally deficient claim that is based 
on a particular document can avoid dismissal of that claim by failing to attach the relied upon document."")"
300,14," Said exhibits were previously filed with this Court in the original round of motions to dismiss, and have been incorporated by 
reference into the renewed motion to dismiss (see  [*88] doc. no. 82, P 12). Furthermore, the Court stated on the record at the 
arguments on the original motions to dismiss that the parties need not re-brief the same issues raised in the original motions to 
dismiss (see doc. no. 85, at p. 21). The Court therefore has relied upon the some of the arguments raised in the original round of 
briefing, to the extent the arguments remain applicable to the allegations in the Amended Complaint. "
302,15," Further, while Plaintiff makes much of the alleged offer of a ""truce"" (Complaint, P 63-64; Amended Complaint, P 56-57) by 
UPMC CEO Romoff, which was acknowledged in the 2001 Merger Litigation to the adversarial relationship between UPMC and 
Highmark in its response to the Renewed Motion to Dismiss, the Court does not find this offer of truce during litigation illustrates 
that the Defendants acted in concert. See Doc. no. 86 at 10. "
304,16," The terms ""predatory"" and ""exclusionary"" are used interchangeably to refer to conduct which can support an attempted 
monopolization claim under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. See Jostens, Inc., 216 F.3d 465, 476, fn 2. "
306,17," In the Original Complaint, the Prayer for Relief also included ""that Highmark be ordered to contract with West Penn Allegheny 
on fair and equitable terms, including the end of any discrimination in reimbursement (both direct and indirect) between UPMC 
and West Penn Allegheny."" Complaint, Prayer for Relief, P 2."
306,18," The Original Complaint also contained language  [*108] in the Prayer for Relief seeking the Court to order UPMC ""to 
discontinue its joint ventures with independent community hospitals."" Complaint, Prayer for Relief, P 3."
306,19," The aforementioned Prayer for Relief seems to be the only addition to the Prayer for Relief as set forth in the Original 
Complaint. However, this additional Prayer for Relief in essence seeks the same form of relief as contained above in footnote 
number 18 hereinabove (that UPMC ""discontinue its joint ventures with independent community hospitals."") "
312,1," These subsidiaries are Harrah's Lake Charles, LLC; Harrah's Star Partnership; Players LC LLC; Players Riverboat 
Management LLC; and Players Riverboat II LLC. The lawsuit names an entity called Players Lake Charles LLC. This is, in fact, 
Players LC, LLC. Harrah's Lake Charles, LLC, and Harrah's Star Partnership no longer exist. After being sold to Pinnacle, they 
were renamed PNK (SCB), LLC, and PNK (Baton Rouge) Partnership, respectively."
312,2," This entity is not a party to the lawsuit, and may no longer exist. It is the Players entity party to the 1995 settlement agreement 
 [**4] relevant to this lawsuit. "
313,3," A licensee, who operates casinos, and a permitee, who supplies or is employed by casinos, must be ""a person of good 
character, honesty, and integrity,"" who does not ""pose a threat to the public interest,"" is ""capable of and likely to conduct the 
activities"" which he seeks permission to conduct, and is not disqualified by having committed certain enumerated criminal 
offenses. ยง 27:28. In addition, riverboat casino licensees must have adequate experience, training, and education, adequate 
financing, the ability to operate a vessel, detailed design plans, docking facilities, and ""a good faith plan to recruit, train, and 
upgrade minorities in all employment classifications."" ยง 27:70."
313,4," Louisiana has also authorized one land-based casino in the New Orleans area, ยง 27:201-286, which Harrah's owns, two 
casinos on Indian reservations, and three ""racinos."""
313,5," Both defendants titled their motions ""Motion to Dismiss,"" and the district court also used this term. Because both defendants 
filed an answer before filing this motion, both motions were for a judgment on the pleadings. See FED R. CIV. P. 12(c). "
314,6," These are breach of duty of good faith, negligent breach of contract, breach of contract, breach of accounting and reporting 
obligation, unfair trade practices, unjust enrichment, and subrogation."
314,7," The parties' briefing assumes, as we do for present purposes only, that the Louisiana casino market is a relevant antitrust 
market."
314,8," Neither Pinnacle nor Harrah's contends that Jebaco's allegations of Sherman Act violations are insufficiently detailed to ""state a 
claim to relief that is plausible on its face."" Iqbal, 556 U.S.    , 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 
1974). We therefore assume that Jebaco's allegations are legally sufficient under FED. R. CIV. P. 8."
314,9," The district court's ruling relied heavily on Astoria Entertainment v. Edwards, 159 F. Supp.2d 303 (E.D. La. 2001). That case is 
factually inapposite. There, the plaintiff claimed its unsuccessful riverboat gaming license application was the result of, inter alia, 
federal antitrust law violations. Among the many named defendants were several corporate licensees who were alleged to be 
participating in a politically corrupt conspiracy  [**11] to deny the plaintiff a license. The district court held that the actions of the 
corporate defendants to lobby and secure their own licenses were protected by Noerr-Pennington. The plaintiff did not allege 
that private actors violated the Sherman Act through an illegal horizontal restraint, as Jebaco does. "
315,10," These requirements are somewhat relaxed for plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. HN5[

The injury alleged is not limited to business or property; damages can be simply threatened; and fear of duplicative or 
speculative recovery will not preclude relief. 15 U.S.C. ยง 26; Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 111, 107 S. Ct.

340,1," The Kansas Supreme Court has applied the three-year limitations period to a Kansas antitrust claim where the plaintiff sought 
only actual damages. See McCue v. Franklin, 156 Kan. 1, 131 P.2d 704 (Kan. 1942). "
341,2," Defendants' argument is particularly misdirected as to Plaintiffs' full consideration claim. The full extent of damages in an 
antitrust action sometimes may be difficult to quantify or prove. The Kansas antitrust statutes permit a litigant to resort to the full 
consideration remedy as an alternate means of measuring damages. See Alexander, 1 P.3d at 907 (noting that the Kansas 
Consumer Protection Act's provision permitting the recovery of a penalty was designed to provide an alternate measure of 
damages where the consumer's damages are difficult to quantify or the full amount of damages suffered may be difficult to 
prove). "
349,1," Wellbutrin SR is a sustained release drug using the active ingredient bupropion hydrochloride. Defendant markets Wellbutrin 
SR in 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg dosage strengths. The 200 mg strength is not at issue in this case. "
350,2," HN1[
] Under Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), an indirect purchaser cannot bring a damages claim under federal law based on an alleged antitrust violation. As discussed in greater detail later in this 
Memorandum, some states permit indirect purchasers to recover for antitrust violations under their state antitrust statutes, while 
other states have adopted the Illinois Brick rule barring indirect purchaser claims."
350,3," In the Amended Complaint, the End-Payor Plaintiffs bring claims under the antitrust statutes of the following jurisdictions: 
Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Nebraska,  [**7] Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, 
Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin."
350,4," The End-Payor Plaintiffs bring claims under the consumer protection statutes of the following jurisdictions: Alaska, Arizona, 
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, 
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia."
350,5," In connection with their class certification motion, the End-Payor Plaintiffs have stated that they are not seeking to certify any 
unjust enrichment claims at this time. See End-Payor Pls.' Resp. 12. Nevertheless, because of the ""hypothetical possibility on 
this Motion the Court may rule that a named plaintiff failed to state a claim under any state consumer protection or antitrust 
statute,"" id. at 12-13, the End-Payor Plaintiffs' Response also addresses GSK's arguments as  [**8] to why the unjust enrichment 
claims should be dismissed."
350,6," HN2[
] Where, as here, a defendant has filed an answer to the complaint, a plaintiff's failure to state a claim may be raised through a motion for judgment on the pleadings. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2)(B)."
350,7," A.F. of L.-A.G.C. Building Trades We 7 lfare Plan, IBEW-NECA Local 505 Health & Welfare Plan, MC-UA Local 119 Health and 
Welfare Plan, and Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health and Welfare Plan are the End-Payor Plaintiffs based in Alabama."
350,8," United Food Commercial Workers Unions and Employers Midwest Health Benefits Fund is the End-Payor Plaintiff based in 
Illinois. "
351,9," Sidney Hillman Health Center of Rochester, Inc. is the End-Payor Plaintiff based in New York."
351,10," Although an ""end-payor"" is not necessarily a welfare benefit plan, all named End-Payor Plaintiffs are welfare benefit plans. As 
noted above, the named End-Payor Plaintiffs have never purchased Wellbutrin SR directly from GSK. Because GSK argues that 
the End-Payor Plaintiffs may not raise any claims other than those under the laws of their home states, the Motion does not 
address the question of whether the End-Payor Plaintiffs would fail to state a claim based on the laws of the many states in 
which their members purchased Wellbutrin SR. "
352,11," In Flonase, Judge Brody declined to 11 apply the so-called ""Ortiz exception,"" in which courts decide whether to certify a class 
before they address Article III standing issues. See Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 831, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 
715 (1999) (explaining that a court  [**15] may reach a class certification question first if it is ""logically antecedent"" to any 
standing question); Payton v. County of Kane, 308 F.3d 673, 680 (7th Cir. 2002) (""We understand Ortiz to rest on the long-
standing rule that, once a class is properly certified, statutory and Article III standing requirements must be assessed with 
reference to the class as a whole, not simply with reference to the individual named plaintiffs. The certification of a class 
changes the standing aspects of a suit, because '[a] properly certified class has a legal status separate from and independent of 
the interest asserted by the named plaintiff.'"" (quoting Whitlock v. Johnson, 153 F.3d 380, 384 (7th Cir. 1998))). In response to 
the Motion, however, the End-Payor Plaintiffs do not argue that the Court should apply the Ortiz exception. "
353,12," The parties agree that Pennsylvania's choice of law rules apply to this action. HN8[
] Under Pennsylvania law, the law of the 
jurisdiction with the most significant interest in the litigation generally applies. See, e.g., Foulke v. Dugan, 187 F. Supp. 2d 253, 
257 (E.D. Pa. 2002). Among the factors relevant to this inquiry are ""(1) the place where the injury occurred; (2) the place where 
the conduct causing the injury occurred; (3) the domicile, residence, nationality, or place of business or incorporation of the 
parties; and (4) the place where the relationship between the parties is centered."" Id. (citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict of 
Laws ยง 145). Given the fact that the alleged injury occurred in each of the fifty states, and given each state's strong interest in 
protecting its own consumers (but a far weaker interest in protecting consumers from other states), see In re Relafen Antitrust 
Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 277 (D. Mass. 2004), it is clear  [**18] (and in the context of this Motion, the parties do not dispute) that 
the law of a particular state will govern any overcharge injury arising in that state. See id. (discussing Pennsylvania's ""functional"" 
choice of law approach and rejecting the argument that a single state's law could be applied to out-of-state sales of the drug)."
353,13," The states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, 
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. "
354,14," GSK's reliance on In re OSB appears misplaced, however, because the district court found that the plaintiffs had not alleged 
injury in the three states and therefore did not state a claim on their own behalf. In contrast, the End-Payor Plaintiffs in this case 
do allege injury in multiple states."
354,15," It is unclear the extent to which Ditropan supports GSK's position. From the Ditropan court's discussion, it is unclear whether 
the named health care plan plaintiffs were attempting to claim injury for reimbursements made outside their home state. The 
end-payor plaintiffs urged the district court to apply the Ortiz exception,  [**22] but it is unclear what, if any, other arguments they 
made in response to the motion to dismiss. See 529 F. Supp. 2d at 1107 (""Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs do not assert there is 
basis to confer standing on them to bring claims based on the state law of states in which they do not reside, but rather, argue 
that the determination of standing is premature prior to class certification.""). After declining to apply the Ortiz exception, the 
district court stated only that ""Plaintiffs bear the burden of demonstrating standing. They have not done so here."" Id. (citation 
omitted)."
354,16," Caproni and several other cases cited by GSK all involve securities fraud claims and follow the rule that a cause of action 
accrues where the fraud's impact is felt, generally the plaintiff's residence."
354,17," The End-Payor Plaintiffs argue that if the Court views the Amended Complaint's failure to identify specific states as a pleading 
defect, they could remedy the defect by amending their pleading again. They argue that because GSK has had their claims data 
for several years, it would not be prejudiced since it has had the information upon which the amended allegations would be 
based. "
355,18," HN11[
] New York Civil Practice Law and Rules ยง 901(b) provides that ""[u]nless a statute creating or imposing a penalty, or a minimum measure of recovery specifically authorizes the recovery thereof in a  [**25] class action, an action to recover a 
penalty, or minimum measure of recovery created or imposed by statute may not be maintained as a class action."" Because the 
Donnelly Act, which is silent on the question of class recovery, requires the award of treble damages for any violation, class 
actions are not available to recover the Donnelly Act's treble damages ""penalty."" Sperry, 863 N.E.2d at 1017. Although the End-Payor Plaintiffs concede that section 901(b) forecloses their ability to maintain a Donnelly Act class action, the 
Supreme Court has granted certiorari in a recent decision of the Second Circuit finding that section 901(b) is in fact a bar to a 
class action in federal court. Shady Grove Orthopedic Assocs., P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 549 F.3d 137 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. 
granted, 129 S. Ct. 2160, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1155 (2009). The question presented is: ""Does a state statute limiting the availability of 
class actions in state courts restrict a federal court's power to certify a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 in an 
action where jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship?"" Brief for Petitioner, 2009 U.S. S. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 513 (July 10, 
2009). "
356,19," In a footnote, GSK also raises the argument that the End-Payor Plaintiffs have failed to identify the states' laws of unjust 
enrichment under which they are proceeding, thus requiring dismissal of the unjust enrichment claims. Both Judge McLaughlin 
and Judge Brody dismissed the unjust enrichment claims of the end-payors in Wellbutrin XL and Flonase, respectively, for this 
reason. See 260 F.R.D. 143, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66676, at *71 (""The amended complaint . . . does not reference any basis in 
law on which a claim for unjust enrichment might proceed. The plaintiffs fail to link their claim to the law of any particular state. 
As a result of this deficiency, the plaintiffs fail to state a cause of action under their third count.""); 610 F. Supp. 2d at 419 
(dismissing the unjust enrichment claim with leave to amend because the plaintiffs failed to specify under which states' laws they 
brought the claim). "
357,20," As GSK points out, however, the Court in D.R. Ward also found that even assuming the validity of the ""end run"" argument, the 
plaintiffs still had viable unjust enrichment claims because the three states at issue--Tennessee,  [**33] Arizona, and Vermont--
all permitted antitrust claims. Thus, the court found that ""an unjust enrichment claim would not circumvent the procedural and 
substantive limitations of these antitrust statutes."" 470 F. Supp. 2d at 507. At least one court has found D.R. Ward 
distinguishable from cases where, as here, the states in question bar antitrust recovery for indirect purchasers. See In re TFT-
LCD Antitrust Litig., 599 F. Supp. 2d 1179, 1192 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (declining to follow D.R. Ward because the states at issue 
barred antitrust claims for indirect purchasers and because ""plaintiffs have not cited any authority from [the states in question] 
holding that an indirect purchaser plaintiff may bring an unjust enrichment claim when that same claim would be barred under 
state antitrust law"")."
357,21," Moreover, the New York Court of Appeals has stated that HN21[
] in cases where, as here, the plaintiffs may not maintain a 
class action for antitrust violations, ""it is not appropriate to substitute unjust enrichment to avoid the statutory limitations on the 
cause of action created by the Legislature."" Sperry, 863 N.E.2d at 1018. While, as discussed supra, the End-Payor Plaintiffs 
have argued that a state's decision not to permit an antitrust claim on these facts does not create a per se bar against an unjust 
enrichment claim, that argument cannot succeed where the New York courts have addressed the question specifically. "
358,22," HN24[
] Pursuant to the Supreme Court's decision in Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 85 S. Ct. 1136, 14 L. Ed. 2d 8 (1965), where there is a ""direct collision"" between a state law and a federal rule of civil procedure, a court sitting in diversity must apply 
the federal rule unless the rule is invalid. See id. at 471 (""When a situation is covered by one of the Federal Rules, the question 
facing the court is a far cry from the typical, relatively unguided Erie choice: the court has been instructed to apply the Federal 
Rule, and can refuse to do so only if the Advisory Committee, this Court, and Congress erred in their prima facie judgment that 
the Rule  [**39] in question transgresses neither the terms of the Enabling Act nor constitutional restrictions."")."
358,23," In reaching its decision, the court in Katrina distinguished New York's CPLR ยง 901(b) by stating that there was no ""direct 
collision"" between that rule and Federal Rule 23. See 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69708, at *265-66. As noted above, the Supreme 
Court has granted certiorari to resolve that question."
358,24," Despite Alabama's reservations about certifying unjust enrichment classes under state law, at least one federal court has 
certified an end-payor class bringing an unjust enrichment claim under Alabama law. See Terazosin, 220 F.R.D. at 702. "
359,25," In an alternative  [**41] holding, the Seventh Circuit found that the statements did not violate the ICFA because they were 
authorized by federal law and therefore exempted from the ICFA's coverage. 246 F.3d at 941 n.4, 943."
359,26," At least one federal court has allowed an unjust enrichment claim to proceed despite the dismissal of the ICFA claim. See 
Strategic Reimbursement, Inc. v. HCA, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57052, at *9-13 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 2, 2007).  [**42] However, as 
both parties recognize, the court in Strategic Reimbursement was not faced with the ""end run"" argument Defendant presents 
here."
359,27," Sidney Hillman is the only End-Payor Plaintiff that did not  [**43] reimburse members for purchases outside of its home state. 
See End-Payor Pls.' Resp. 12-13 (explaining that all other End-Payor Plaintiffs sent reimbursements into other states). 
Therefore, even assuming the Court allows the other named plaintiffs to raise claims in other states, Sidney Hillman must be 
dismissed because it was not injured in any state aside from New York. "
360,28," Aside from these general arguments about unjust enrichment, GSK also raises specific challenges to unjust enrichment claims 
under Alabama and Illinois law. However, as discussed above, I do not feel that these specific challenges carry any additional 
weight, as the argument about Alabama class certification is irrelevant in federal court and the cases cited from Illinois do not 
support GSK's argument. "
363,1," Because Plaintiff has failed sufficiently to allege agreement, I need not reach Defendants' argument that Plaintiff does not have 
""antitrust standing."" See generally IIA Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law P 335f (3d ed. 2007) (cautioning courts to 
distinguish between a plaintiff that has no antitrust standing and a plaintiff that has not alleged a violation). "
365,2," Moreover, as explained infra, this alleged conduct, even if it were sufficiently pleaded, would be immunized from antitrust 
liability by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See infra note 7 and accompanying text."
365,3," Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants and the Unnamed Bank Conspirators have conspired to monopolize the ASF bond market 
by excluding Plaintiff and her licensees from participating  [*17] in that market. (Compl. PP 97-106). The elements for a 
conspiracy to monopolize are ""(1) proof of a concerted action deliberately entered into with the specific intent to achieve an 
unlawful monopoly, and (2) the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy."" AD/SAT v. Associated Press, 181 
F.3d 216, 233 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting Int'l Distribution Ctrs., Inc. v. Walsh Trucking Co., 812 F.2d 786, 795 (2d Cir. 1987)). "
366,," Because Plaintiff has failed to allege a conspiracy in violation of Section 1, her conspiracy to monopolize claim under Sections 1 
and 2 (Count Three) similarly fails and is DISMISSED. See Walsh Trucking Co., 812 F.2d at 796. See generally ABA Section of 
Antitrust Law, Antitrust Law Developments (6th ed. 2007) 318 n.616 (listing cases in which the failure to establish a 
combination or conspiracy defeated a conspiracy to monopolize claim)."
366,4," Because Plaintiff has failed sufficiently to allege anticompetitive conduct, I need not reach Defendants' argument that Plaintiff 
has alleged an implausibly narrow market."
366,5," The parties submitted their pleadings prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Iqbal, which applied Twombly's plausibility 
standard to all actions. Plaintiff initially argues that the standard set forth in Twombly does not apply to her Section 2 claim. (Pl.'s 
Opp'n 13). Under Iqbal, this argument fails. Iqbal, 129 S.Ct, at 1949-50 (2009). "
367,6," Similarly, Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants ""caused"" and ""pressed"" bond issuances that contain long no-call periods, 
 [*23] which prevent refinancing using Plaintiff's Structure. The Complaint does not indicate how these bonds will have an 
anticompetitive effect on the relevant product market, and elsewhere Plaintiff alleges that numerous banks compete with each 
other over such issuances. (Compl. P 81). Thus, this allegation fails to support a monopolization claim since it does not meet 
Twombly's plausibility standard."
367,7," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not cover ""sham"" lobbying efforts. See, e.g., In Re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litigation, 
466 F.3d 187, 216-17 (2d Cir. 2006) (discussing applicability of doctrine and sham exception). Plaintiff has not alleged any facts 
to suggest that Defendants engaged in ""sham"" lobbying (nor does she raise such an argument), and thus the alleged conduct 
would be immunized from any antitrust liability even if Plaintiff had adequately alleged that Defendants had convinced PANYNJ

389,10," Plaintiffs define the ""Class Period"" as the period between July 1, 2003 and the present. (R. 142, Am. Direct Compl. P 1.; R. 50, 
Indirect Compl. P 1.) "
390,11," On July 27, 2009, the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs made a minor correction and filed an amended complaint. (R. 142, Am. Direct 
Compl.) "
391,12," Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs have withdrawn their New York restraint of trade claim. (R. 147, Indirect Pls' Resp. at 29.) "
394,13," Certain Defendants do not dispute Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' standing to assert claims under the laws of the states where 
they reside. (R. 113, Certain Defs.' Indirect Mem. at 9.)"
394,14," The Indirect Complaint does not state exactly where the  [**38] alleged injuries occurred. This Court will infer that the Indirect 
Purchaser Plaintiffs purchased potash containing products, specifically, fertilizer, in their respective states of residence because 
at this stage of the litigation a court must ""accept all well-pleaded facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences from those 
facts in favor of the plaintiffs."" St. John's United Church of Christ v. City of Chicago, 502 F.3d 616, 625 (7th Cir. 2007). "
395,15," Plaintiffs assert claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which provides: HN10[
] ""Every contract, combination in the 
form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is 
declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. ยง 1. "
398,16," On April 7, 2009, the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs joined the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' motion for alternative service. (R. 52, 
Indirect Pls.' Joinder to Mot. for Alternative Service.)"
398,17," The Court granted the motion for alternative service despite BPC Chicago's limited objection arguing that Plaintiffs could not 
serve Uralkali through BPC Chicago its purported agent. (R. 53, BPC Chicago's Limited Objection to Pls.' Mot. for Alternative 
Service.)"
398,18," In addition, the Russian Defendants argue that dismissal is also required for insufficient process pursuant to Rule 12(b)(4) 
because Plaintiffs did not fax copies of the original summons and complaint. (R. 139, Uralkali's Direct Mem. at 8 n.2.) The 
record, however, indicates that after a series of unsuccessful attempts at faxing Uralkali, on June 2, 2009, Plaintiffs faxed both 
English and Russian translations of: (1) a cover letter briefly summarizing the case and the alternative service; (2) this Court's 
order granting Plaintiffs' Motion to Allow Alternative Service; (3) a Summons; (4) the Direct Complaint; and (5) the Amended 
Direct Complaint. (R. 156, Decl. of Heather Potteiger PP 2-5.) These documents were also emailed to Uralkali on May 27, 2009. 
(Id. at P 6.) Accordingly, the Russian Defendants' motion to dismiss on  [**52] this basis is denied. "
399,19," Russia's policy in these matters is purportedly based on objections to a fee imposed by the United States for all requests for 
service from any foreign country. (R. 41-3, Ex. A., U.S. Dept. of State Russia Judicial Assistance Circular.) This fee was 
designed to cover the cost incurred to administer the United States Central  [**54] Authority. (Id.)"
399,20," Plaintiffs offer additional evidence to support the fact that the Russian Central Authority denies all service requests from the 
United States. See (R. 41-2, Cohen Decl. P 5 (documenting conversations with the U.S. Department of State's Legal Affairs 
office, confirming that there had been no change with regard to Russia's refusal to provide judicial assistance to United States 
litigants); & P 6 (documenting conversations with Civil Action Group Ltd., a legal support services company with expertise in 
international service of process, that informed Plaintiffs that it was unable to arrange service in Russia due to the country's 
rejection of the Hague Convention).)"
399,21," Arista is particularly instructive, as it addressed service on a defendant in the Russian Federation. See id. The defendant in 
Arista argued that the district court could not exercise its discretion to authorize service pursuant to Rule 4(f)(3) unless plaintiff 
first attempted  [**56] service through the Hague Convention. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16485, [WL] at *4. The court recognized 
that Russia had suspended judicial cooperation with the United States, and noted that plaintiffs need not be burdened with the 
""sisyphean task of attempting service through the Hague Convention procedures"" when the Russian Federation had 
""categorically refused"" service. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16485, [WL] at *6 n.4 & *7. The Arista court determined that there was no 
reason to believe that service would be effective if plaintiffs were to serve defendant in accordance with the Hague Convention, 
therefore Rule 4(f)(1) service was not required under these circumstances and service pursuant to Rule 4(f)(3) was appropriate. 
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16485, [WL] at *7-8. "
403,22," Plaintiffs limit this argument to the Russian Defendants, who they allege had previously reduced price to maintain volume 
during periods of weakening demand. (R. 144, Direct Pls.' Resp. at 10; R. 142, Am. Direct Compl. PP 93, 136-37.) Parallel 
conduct, however, was not generally ""unprecedented"" in the potash industry. See Blomkest Fertilizer v. PC.S, 203 F.3d 1028 
(8th Cir. 2000) (where several potash producers, including PCS, prevailed in a antitrust suit with similar allegations of price 
collusion.). "
404,23," The Court acknowledges that Mosaic, the world's second (or third) largest potash producer, is not alleged to have suspended 
sales during the period of the sinkhole. (See R. 142, Am. Direct Compl. PP 18, 99; R. 50, Indirect Compl. P 13.)"
404,24," Defendants argue that an immediate price increase was unsustainable in this case and would have been ""problematic"" to their 
long-term market positions because Silvinit resumed sales less than two weeks after its purported suspension. (R. 159, Cert. 
Defs.' Direct Reply at 6.)"
404,25," The Court is not persuaded by BPC Chicago's argument that the ""allegations cannot plausibly refer to the U.S. subsidiary."" (R. 
149, BPC Chicago's Reply at 11.) The complaints allege that the during the Class Period, BPC Chicago ""marketed, sold, and 
distributed potash throughout the United States."" (R. 50, Indirect Compl. P 23; R. 142, Am. Direct Compl. P 27.) Specifically, 
Plaintiffs allege that the company was involved in parallel price increases and suspended sales during the sinkhole events. (Id. 
PP 102, 103, 106, 128.) At this stage, these allegations sufficiently set forth facts which show that BPC Chicago plausibly played 
some role in the alleged conspiracy. See  [**78] In re OSB Antitrust Litig., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56573 at * 13 (""Antitrust 
conspiracies need not be detailed defendant by defendant.""). "
405,26," Furthermore, the Russian Defendants motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction are also denied. (R. 126, JSC Defs.' 
Mot. to Dismiss the Indirect Compl.; R. 127, JSC Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss the Direct Compl.; R. 130, Uralkali's Mot, to Dismiss the 
Indirect Compl.; R. 135, Uralkali's Mot. to Dismiss the Indirect Compl.) Plaintiffs assert jurisdiction over the Russian Defendants 
based on a conspiracy theory. (See R. 50, Indirect Compl. P 20; R. 150, Pls.' Resp. to Russian Dels.' Mots, at 15; see also 
Stauffacher v. Bennett, 969 F.2d 455, 459 (7th Cir. 1992) (""If through one of its members a conspiracy inflicts an actionable 
wrong in one jurisdiction, the other members should not be allowed  [**79] to escape being sued by hiding in another 
jurisdiction."").) HN30[
] To establish jurisdiction through a conspiracy theory, ""a plaintiff must allege both an actionable 
conspiracy and a substantial act in furtherance of the conspiracy performed in the forum state."" Olson v. Jenkens & Gilchrist, 
461 F. Supp. 2d 710, 725 (N.D. Ill, 2006)(citing Textor v. Ed. of Regents of N. Ill. Univ., 711 F.2d 1387, 1392 (7th Cir. 1983). 
Consistent with our previous discussion, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have set forth allegations which illustrate that the Russian 
Defendants' plausibly participated in the alleged conspiracy and that some acts in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy took 
place in Illinois. As such, Plaintiff's have made out a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction and the Russian Defendants' 
motion to dismiss on this basis is denied."
405,27," Section 16 provides: HN32[
] ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive 
relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of 
the antitrust laws[.]"" 15 U.S.C. ยง 26. "
406,28," In AGC, the Supreme Court also held that courts examining antitrust standing are to consider the type of injury and whether it 
is ""of the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall."" 459 U.S. at 538-39 (citing Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 487-488). 
This Court will consider this factor under the rubric of antitrust injury, as the Seventh Circuit has structured its analysis of 
antitrust injury and antitrust standing in this manner. See Kochert, 463 F.3d at 715-719  [**83] (analyzing antitrust injury prior to 
the antitrust standing factors set out in AGC); Serfecz, 67 F.3d at 596-97 (examining antitrust injury and antitrust standing 
separately); Local Beauty Supply, Inc v. Lamaur Inc., 787 F.2d 1197, 1201 (7th Cir. 1986) (distinguishing between the 
requirements of antitrust injury and antitrust standing). "
408,29," Plaintiffs indicate Section 445.773 as the provision that has been violated by Defendants' alleged conduct. (R. 50, Indirect 
Compl. P 142.) That provision, however, relates not to agreements in restraint of trade, but rather to monopolies. See Mich. 
Comp. Laws Ann. ยง 445.773. Considering the crux of the Indirect Complaint involves allegations of an illicit agreement to fix 
potash prices, the Court will use Section 445.772 for purposes of its analysis."
408,30," Rather than properly citing Section 50-112, which prohibits the conduct alleged in the Indirect Complaint, Plaintiffs cite Section 
50-101, (See R. 50, Indirect Compl. P 140.), which defines trusts and declares them unlawful. Compare Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 50-
112 with Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 50-101. The Court will use the former in its evaluation of the Kansas antitrust claim."
408,31," Plaintiffs cite Iowa Code Section 553.5 as the statutory basis for their Iowa antitrust claim. (R. 50, Indirect Compl. P 139.) 
Again, the core of the allegations contained in the Indirect Complaint do not involve monopolies.  [**93] Rather, the conduct 
relates to an alleged agreement by Defendants to ""artificially raise, fix, maintain, and/or stabilize prices for potash products in the 
United States."" (R. 50, Indirect Compl. P 130.) Thus, this Court will use the more appropriate Section 553.4 in its analysis. "
409,32," In pertinent part, the relevant statutory provision provides: HN45[
] ""Any other person threatened with injury or injured 
directly or indirectly in his or her business or property by a violation of this act may bring an action for appropriate injunctive or 
other equitable relief against immediate irreparable harm, actual damages sustained by reason of a violation of this act[.]"" Mich. 
Comp. Law. Ann. ยง 445.778(2). "
410,33," Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' claim for damages under Kansas law is based on the following statutory provision: HN46[
] ""Except as provided in K.S.A. 12-205, and amendments thereto, any person injured or damaged by any such arrangement, 
contract, agreement, trust or combination, described in K.S.A. 50-112 and 50-113, and amendments thereto, may sue for and 
recover in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state, of any person, the full consideration or sum paid by such person for 
any goods, wares, merchandise and articles included in or advanced or controlled in price by such combination, or the full 
amount of money borrowed."" Kan. Stat. Ann. ยง 50-115."
410,34," Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' claim for damages under Mississippi law is based on the following statutory provision: HN48[
] 
""Any person, natural or artificial, injured or damaged by a trust and combine as herein defined, or by its effects direct or indirect, 
may recover all damages of every kind sustained by him or it and in addition a penalty of five hundred dollars ($ 500.00), by suit 
in any court of competent jurisdiction. Said suit may be brought against  [**103] one or more of the parties to the trust or 
combine and one or more of the officers and representatives of any corporation a party to the same, or one or more of either. "
411,," Such penalty may be recovered in each instance of injury. All recoveries herein provided for may be sued for in one suit."" Miss. 
Code. Ann. ยง 75-21-9."
411,35," In relevant part, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs claim for damages under Iowa law is based on the following provision: HN49[
] 
""The state or a person who is injured or threatened with injury by conduct prohibited under this chapter may bring suit to . . . 
[r]ecover actual damages resulting from conduct prohibited under [the Iowa Competition Law]."" Iowa Code Ann. ยง 553.12. In 
Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 646 N.W.2d 440 (Iowa 2002), the Iowa Supreme Court held that  [**104] HN50[
] indirect 
purchasers may bring suit under the Iowa Competition Law. Id. at 445 (""Given the clear, broad language of the state antitrust 
law, we conclude the Iowa Competition Law creates a cause of action for all consumers, regardless of one's technical status as 
a direct or indirect purchaser."")"
411,36," The Southard court considered antitrust injury under its antitrust standing analysis. See Southard, 734 N.W.2d at 198-199. 
While under Seventh Circuit law the concepts are generally examined separately, see Kochert, 463 F.3d at 715-719 (analyzing 
antitrust injury prior to the antitrust standing factors set out in AGC); Serfecz, 67 F.3d at 596-97 (examining antitrust injury and 
antitrust standing separately); Local Beauty Supply, Inc., 787 F.2d at 1201 (distinguishing between the requirements of antitrust 
injury and antitrust standing), this Court must structure its analysis according to Iowa law. Accordingly, this Court's examination 
of antitrust standing also considers antitrust injury. "
412,37," The Florida claim is brought under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practice Act (""FDUPTA""). (R. 50, Indirect Compl. P 
167.) In relevant part, this provision states that HN51[
] ""[u]nfair methods of competition, unconscionable acts or practices, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful."" Fla. Stat. Ann. ยง 
501.204 (1). Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs also assert a claim under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act (""KCPA""). (R. 50, 
Indirect Compl. P 169.) HN52[
] This Act proscribes deceptive or unconscionable acts and practices in connection with a consumer transaction. See Kan. Stat. ยงยง 50-626, 627. "
413,38," Although the Indirect Complaint alleges that Mosaic released a report that ""falsely attributed"" the tight supply in the potash 
market, (R. 50, Indirect Compl. P 93), this allegation, by itself, is not enough for Rule 9(b) purposes to support an allegation of 
fraud against all Defendants. See Vicom, 20 F.3d at 778. "
414,39," The Court notes that in the previously discussed Southard case, the Iowa Supreme Court did impose ""limitations"" on an unjust 
enrichment claim by concluding that plaintiffs' claim was not actionable because the injuries were ""too remote to recover."" 
Southard, 734 N.W.2d at 199. In contrast to this case, however, the injuries alleged by the plaintiffs in Southard were ""not even 
indirect, as the plaintiffs [were] not in the chain of distribution."" Id."
414,40," The Court will consider Belaruskali's motion to dismiss (R. 190) in a subsequent opinion, once the issues have been fully 
briefed. "
417,1," Although ORI filed a separate motion to dismiss, the Court's analysis herein applies equally to ORI. "
420,2," Because the Court has concluded that Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to support allegations of a conspiracy, the 
Court has not reached the parent corporations' separate argument that there are insufficient facts alleged to hold them liable 
under the Sherman Act or the  [*19] Cartwright Act either directly or on Plaintiffs' alternative theories of agency or alter-ego 
liability. The Court does address that argument in the context of the Section 17200 Claim. "
421,3," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged facts establishing that the Defendants caused their injuries and, thus, cannot 
meet the standing requirements of Section 17200. The Court addresses, and rejects, this argument in its discussion of the merits 
of Plaintiffs' Section 17200 Claim. "
422,4," Defendants rely on a subsequent opinion in the Blaylock case in which the court granted summary judgment for lack of 
standing. In light of the procedural posture of this case, the Court finds that opinion inapposite. "
429,1," Psystar also asserts that Apple claims copyright infringement as to its decryption key. In response, Apple clarifies that it ""has 
never alleged that Psystar's copyright infringement is limited to Psystar's unauthorized use of the"" decryption key (Pl. Opp. 15). 
Rather Apple's allegations are focused on copying of Mac OS X, not just a decryption key. In any event, Psystar has provided 
little support for this argument and its position is rejected. "
430,2," Trying to have it both ways, Psystar successfully opposed Apple's earlier attempt to reopen discovery and extend deadlines to 
add an additional product -- Snow Leopard -- to this action. Psystar  [**10] now seeks to add a very late affirmative defense. This 
would not be fair. "
432,3," Psystar also asserts Section 117 as a defense to avoid liability for infringement of Apple's right to create derivative works. But 
as stated above, Psystar has waived this defense. "
435,4," does not rely on a reverse-engineering defense under the DMCA, and thus this order does not address Apple's argument on 
this point. "

Union are referred to collectively as AIG defendants. As AIGRM was not yet a party to the action, no mention of AIGRM is made 
in AIG's and National Union's motion to compel arbitration to the Law Division. There is no information on the record that AIGRM 
joined the AIG defendant's motion to compel arbitration on the present appeal."
445,4," Plaintiff also named as a defendant Twin City Fire Insurance Company,  which is referred to collectively as Hartford."
445,5," In addition to its statutory claims against AIG, National Union, and Hartford, plaintiff also alleged these defendants aided and

the propriety  [***41] of such a stay as between the plaintiff and defendants Marsh and Hartford is not before us in this appeal. 
Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., 62 N.J. 229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973). "
461,1," Areeda and Hovenkamp discuss the impact of judicial intervention in situations similar to this one: For example, suppose the claimed essential  [*25] facility is a natural gas line, and the defendant both owns the line and 
sells gas to customers at the end of the line. The plaintiff sells only gas and wishes to share the defendant's line. The 
plaintiff may claim (a) that the defendant's refusal to share the line is a denial of an essential facility; or (b) that denial of 
access to the gas line monopoly ""leverages"" a second monopoly in the gas itself. But the gas pipeline monopoly enables the defendant to obtain all available monopoly profits from sales of the gas, into 
which the line is an essential input. As a result, the market will be just as monopolized after the defendant shares with the 
plaintiff as it was before. The only way the courts can address the problem is by regulating prices as well as access."
461,*," * * Suppose a natural gas producer claims that the defendant's pipeline is an ""essential facility."" A court responds by (a) 
mandating that the defendant share its pipeline, and (b) ordering the defendant to charge only ""reasonable,"" or competitive, 
prices for access. At that point the plaintiff has no incentive to develop another pipeline or perhaps other technology for 
transporting gas. It already has a right to access at the  [*26] competitive price and almost certainly could not do better on 
its own. The result is that the market remains a monopoly, albeit with judicially administered prices. Further, if an unduly broad decree or principles of offensive collateral estoppel require the defendant to share the pipeline 
with other gas firms as well, then no one any longer has the incentive to develop alternatives to the defendant's pipeline. In 
that case antitrust has effectively preserved the monopoly and turned it into a price-regulated public utility. By contrast, if the court orders access but does not insist on the competitive price, then at least some of the incentive to 
look for alternatives remains. In this case, the plaintiff has acquired market access but only at monopoly prices. The degree 
of its incentive to develop an alternative pipeline will be driven mainly by how much of the monopoly price for the pipeline is 
absorbed and how much is ""passed on"" to its customers. In the usual case, a significant amount of such a monopoly 
overcharge is passed on. To that extent the plaintiff's incentive to build an alternative pipeline is significantly reduced as 
well. "

are underwritten, re-underwritten, and serviced, then ERIE has no choice but to take those necessary steps to address the 
issue. ERIE has now closely reviewed its multi-year relationship with your Agency and has determined that, unfortunately, 
the mutual expectations held by your Agency and ERIE at the commencement of our Agency Agreement are simply not 
being fulfilled."

470,9," In addition to appealing from the trial court's failure to grant it judgment as a matter of law  [***10] post-trial, Erie appeals from 
the trial court's failure to dismiss Appellees' antitrust claims for failure to state a claim under the WV Antitrust Act; the trial court's 
failure to grant it summary judgment with respect to the antitrust claims; and the trial court's failure to grant it judgment at the 
close of Appellees' case in chief and at the conclusion of all the evidence. "
471,10," While there were two additional agency agreements between Erie and Mr. Webb, both of those agreements pertained to the 
sale of insurance in Virginia. We do not address those agreements, believing that any  [***12] issue as to alleged violations of 
antitrust law arising under those agreements would be governed by Virginia law."
471,11, See W.Va. Code ยงยง 47-18-1 to -23 (2006).
471,12," The Fourth Circuit states the elements necessary to prove a section 1 violation as: ""(1) a contract, combination or conspiracy; 
(2) that imposed an unreasonable restraint of trade."" Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193 (4th Cir. 2002). "
472,13," The Fourth Circuit did explain, however, that because ""a medical staff can be comprised of physicians with independent and at 
times competing economic interests,"" members of a medical staff do have the capacity to conspire as a matter of law. Oksanen, 
945 F.2d at 706. Even so, this ""does not mean . . . that every action taken by the staff satisfies the contract, combination, or 
conspiracy requirement of section  [***16] one."" Id. at 706."
472,14," As the Court observed, ""[t]he purposeful choice of a parent corporation to organize a subunit as a subsidiary is not itself a 
reason to heighten antitrust scrutiny, because it is not laden with anticompetitive risk."" Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 772 n.19. "
473,15," The Court observed in Copperweld: ""We do not consider under what circumstances, if any, a parent may be liable for 
conspiring with an affiliated corporation it does not completely own."" 467 U.S. at 767."
473,16," In Siegel Transfer, the parent company owned 99.92% of the subsidiary's stock. See 54 F.3d at 1133. "
474,17, The remaining stock is owned by public shareholders and directors.
474,18," Erie Insurance Exchange is a Pennsylvania regulated reciprocal company. A reciprocal insurance exchange is an 
unincorporated entity whose members, referred to as either policyholders or subscribers, all own an interest in the company. No 
stock certificates are issued to the individual policyholders and the policyholders share in profits and losses proportionate to the 
insurance they own. As the attorney-in-fact for the Exchange's policyholders, Erie Indemnity is charged with the managerial 
responsibility for its operations, which includes paying losses experienced by the exchange, investing premium inflow into the 
exchange, recruiting new members, underwriting the inflow of new business, underwriting  [***23] renewal business, receiving 
premiums, and exchanging reinsurance contracts."
474,19," Erie Insurance sells standard tier personal and commercial policies in Virginia; Erie Insurance Property and Casualty sells 
personal and commercial policies in West Virginia; Erie Family Life Insurance sells life insurance in Virginia and West Virginia; 
and Erie Insurance Exchange sells preferred tier personal and commercial insurance in Virginia."
474,20," As an additional basis for its ruling, the trial court cited the fact that Erie Indemnity and Erie Insurance Exchange were not 
wholly-owned subsidiaries. Erie Indemnity was the parent corporation and Erie Insurance Exchange is an unincorporated entity.

475,23," Even if the various Erie companies could have been capable of conspiring for purposes of antitrust law, the act of terminating 
the agreement could not demonstrate an unreasonable restraint of trade without evidence of a corresponding injury of the type 
sought to be protected by antitrust laws. See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 
L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977) (holding that HN11[
] antitrust plaintiff must prove ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to 
prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful""); accord Balaklaw v. Lovell, 822 F.Supp. 892, 903 (N.D. 
N.Y. 1993), aff'd 14 F.3d 793 (2d Cir. 1994) (recognizing that HN12[
] conspiracy alone is insufficient as antitrust plaintiff is 
""still . . . required to demonstrate that the purpose or effect of the alleged conspiracy constituted an unreasonable restraint of 
trade resulting in his antitrust injury"")."
475,24," In  [***29] pertinent part, the conversation was as follows: Mr. Olian: I stressed that last year when we met with you in January . . . . we have 94,000 in new business that's been sent 
our way, it may be difficult for you Kevin [Webb] just to look at it this way, but it's going -- we're going to be hard pressed to 
convince anyone at home office that the majority of new business coming into your agency or coming through your front 
door, however you want to say it, since there apparently is two separate entities inside that same building, that . . . the 
majority of that new business that walks into that door is not going to state auto versus us. Mr. Webb: . . . I give Erie what 
Erie asked for, so I wrote business within the spirit of the AWARE [Agents Writing and Rewriting] Program, so if it come in 
and it wasn't within the spirit of the AWARE Program, I did not write it with Erie. Mr. Olian: Okay. When you're saying within the spirit of the AWARE Program, . . . clarify that for me. "
476,," Mr. Webb: . . . you said you didn't want business with claims, you didn't want bad business, you wanted . .. Basically, the 
premium business, and you wanted . . . multiple-policy business. So we spent the biggest portion  [***30] of the year re-
underwriting the F and M book of business and taking Erie quality homes and . . . matching it up with auto. . . .So, basically, 
the spirit of the AWARE Program was to have two policies with somebody. . . .And the new business I placed with Erie, . . . 
I give them the premium business that they asked for. "
478,25," Of note is the fact that Appellees' economic expert witness, Daniel Selby, confirmed at trial that ""if this was a proper 
termination of the agency contract, there are no damages."""
478,26," See Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 225, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993) 
(recognizing that HN20[
] ""[e]ven an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not, without more, 
state a claim under the federal antitrust laws"")."
478,27," Because we are reversing the lower court based on Appellees' failure to establish an antitrust claim, we find it unnecessary to 
address Erie's additional assignments of  [***40] error predicated on the wrongful inclusion of alleged antitrust injury affecting 
Virginia residents and the wrongful inclusion of lost future commissions in the damage award. "
485,1," Davis did not append a copy of the retail installment sales contract to his complaint. Davis subsequently appended a copy of 
the contract to his opposition to Ford's demurrer and requested judicial notice of the contract. In reviewing the sufficiency of the 
pleading, we treat the contract as having been pled. (See Discussion, I. Davis's Appeal, pt. 1, post.)"
485,2," Civil Code section 2982 states in relevant part at subdivision (k): HN1[
] โThe contract may provide that for each 
installment in default for a period of not less than 10 days the buyer shall pay a delinquency charge in an amount not to exceed 
in the aggregate 5 percent of the delinquent installment, which amount may be collected only once on any installment regardless 
of the period during which it remains in default.โ (Italics added.) "
486,3," Davis is not pursuing all these theories on appeal. The Discussion, post, is confined to the contentions raised by Davis in his 
opening brief on appeal. (See Belton v. Comcast Cable Holdings, LLC (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1224, 1233, fn. 6 [60 Cal. Rptr. 
3d 631].) "
491,4," In Ticconi v. Blue Shield of California Life & Health Ins. Co. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 528, 539 [72 Cal. Rptr. 3d 888], this division 
applied the Smith definition of unfairness. "
492,5," Title 15 United States Code section 45(n) provides: โThe Commission shall have no authority under this section or section 57a 
of this title to declare unlawful an act or practice on the grounds that such act or practice is unfair unless the act or practice 
causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not 
outweighed by  [***32] countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. In determining whether an act or practice is unfair, 
the Commission may consider established public policies as evidence to be considered with all other evidence. Such public 
policy considerations may not serve as a primary basis for such determination.โ (Italics added.) "
493,6," In this regard, Ford's respondent's brief states: โLike most creditors, [Ford] now sends its customers monthly statements which 
show when late fees have been imposed and which installments are due. So, even if Davis did not know at the outset of his 
contract that [Ford] would allocate his payments to the oldest outstanding installment, he could have learned that fact by 
examining his monthly statement the month after he first skipped a paymentโand he could thereafter have avoided further late 
fees by simply paying as agreed.โ Davis does not deny that Ford sent him monthly statements indicating the imposition of a late fee and the amount that was due."
493,7," Civil Code section 1770 states in relevant part: HN8[
] โ(a) The following unfair methods of competition and unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices undertaken by any person in a transaction intended to result or which results in the sale or lease of 
goods or services to any consumer are unlawful: [ยถ] โฆ [ยถ] (14) Representing that a transaction confers or involves rights, 
remedies, or obligations which it does not have or involve, or which are prohibited by law.โ "
495,8," Murillo held a prevailing defendant is entitled to recover costs pursuant to the generally applicable cost recovery rule set forth in 
Code of Civil Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b), notwithstanding Song-Beverly's provision awarding costs and attorney 
fees only to the prevailing buyer (Civ. Code, ยง 1794, subd. (d)). (Murillo, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 999.) Murillo โdisapprove[d] 
Brown to the extent it holds Civil Code section 1794(d)  [***41] constitutes an โexpressโ exception to the general rule permitting a 
prevailing party, including a prevailing defendant, to recoup its costs of litigationโ pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 
1032, subdivision (b). (Murillo, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 996.) Murillo has no bearing on Brown's analysis that the prevailing 
defendants/sellers in the Song-Beverly action were not entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to Rees-Levering. With respect 
to attorney fees, Murillo states: โNothing in our opinion addresses that issue. Sellers are not seeking attorney fees, and there is 
no โdefaultโ attorney fee recovery provision akin to [Code of Civil Procedure] section 1032(b).โ (Murillo, supra, at p. 999, italics 
added; accord, Carver v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 132, 146โ147 [118 Cal. Rptr. 2d 569].) "
500,1, Functional Independence Measure. 
501,2, The court has rounded the actual figures. 
503,3," The court's conclusion that the market share information sought by Defendants is relevant to Defendants' antitrust 
counterclaims does not imply the court has also determined Defendants have established antitrust standing to assert the 
counterclaims. See In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litigation, 585 F.3d 677, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 22719, 2009 WL 
3320504, *7 (2d Cir. Oct. 16, 2009) (noting that an antitrust plaintiff must establish both Article III standing and antitrust 
standing). Here, Plaintiff's Second Affirmative Defense asserts Defendants lack standing. Reply P 234. For example, Defendants 
do not allege they, or any of Plaintiff's subscribers or licensees, have suffered damages as a result of Plaintiff's ability to charge 
supra-competitive prices, in the form of subscription or license fees, a common form of antitrust injury  [*13] caused by a 
monopolist in its relevant market, or that Plaintiff has charged such prices or fees. Id. (citing Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-
Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)). Nor, as noted, do Defendants allege they compete directly 
with Plaintiff. To date, Plaintiff has not moved to dismiss Defendants' antitrust counterclaims. "
505,4, Plaintiff did not request costs. 
515,1," In ruling on defendants' motions to dismiss, we assume the veracity of the facts that Warfield alleged in the complaint."
515,2," Amtrak contends that the billboard is on its property and submitted public records that seem to establish that fact. We may 
consider public records in ruling on a motion to dismiss, but these records do not definitively show that the billboard at issue in 
this case is indeed the one on Amtrak's property. In any event, this fact is not critical for our decision, and so we will not address 
the parties' arguments on this point."
515,3," Warfield is less than clear in its allegations regarding our subject matter jurisdiction over its state law claims. Its  [*6] statement 
on this point reads in full, ""this Court has supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a) because the state law claims "
516,," included in this action are so related to this federal question that they form part of the same case or controversy."" Compl. at P 5. 
But the parties are alleged to be of diverse citizenship, and we cannot say to a legal certainty that the controversy involves less 
than the jurisdictional amount. We will dismiss the federal law claims in this case, but as the remaining state law claims are relatively straightforward, we will 
address them as well. Thus, at a minimum, in the interest of party and judicial economy, we will exercise our discretion under 28 
U.S.C. ยง 1367(c) to maintain jurisdiction over the state law claims for the purposes of this Memorandum and the accompanying 
Order. "
517,4," Defendants argue that plaintiff's alleged market is not plausible. While there may be force to this contention, we will not reach 
that issue because we will dismiss plaintiff's antitrust claims for failure to plead facts supporting antitrust injury. "
518,5," All of the cases that the parties cite on this issue pre-date these recent Supreme Court decisions, and our own research has 
revealed few decisions addressing the issue of antitrust injury in the context of a motion to dismiss post-Iqbal. We thus have 
 [*17] little guidance regarding how the Twombly/Iqbal framework should apply to this specific situation. But as we discuss 
below, we are confident that plaintiff's allegations of antitrust injury here do not cross the threshold that this framework provides. 
Indeed, given the vaporousness of plaintiff's factual pleadings, we very much doubt this would have survived in the pre-
Twombly/Iqbal universe."
518,6," The assertion regarding Amtrak's motive or purpose is not relevant to the question of whether plaintiff has alleged harm to the 
market."
518,7," There are, for example, no facts alleged about Warfield's other attempts to advertise or how its inability to advertise at 30th 
Street Station was so catastrophic, especially in light of other available advertising options, see n.8 infra, to reduce its profits."
518,8," Plaintiff has not addressed this issue, but we take judicial notice of the fact that Philadelphia -- with an estimated population of 
more than 1.4 million people -- offers businesses many ways to reach customers, including people who travel to 30th Street 
Station. See U.S. Census, Population Finder, 2008 Population Estimate for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, available at "
519,," http://factfinder.census.gov.  [*18] There are, inter alia, daily and weekly newspapers, local magazines, other billboard sites on 
the streets and highways leading to 30th Street, bus shelters, and advertisements on buses and in subway stations, to say 
nothing about the infinitude of cyberspace. This is readily apparent and ""generally known within the territorial jurisdiction"" of our 
Court. Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). But even if we did not consider Warfield's other obvious advertising options, we would still conclude that its utterance of the word 
""effect"" in this case does not support a plausible inference of causation. Plaintiff must simply give some explanation regarding 
how Amtrak's interference with the marketing table and billboard harmed its bottom line in a cognizably anti-competitive way."
519,9," Warfield has alleged no facts to support its claims regarding barriers to entry in the market. Indeed, plaintiff -- who is already in 
the proposed relevant market -- has not claimed that it has suffered such barriers, and there are no other plaintiffs in this case to 
assert that claim. See NicSand, 507 F.3d at 454 (""'Of course, a foreclosure alleged to be illegal because it deters entry does not 
injure a plaintiff already in the market.  [*19] Impeding the entry of others grants a benefit to those already in the market.'"" 
(quoting 2 Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application at P 348d3))."
519,10, Amtrak admits that it is a governmental actor for purposes of the First Amendment analysis. Amtrak Br. at 24 n. 10.
519,11," Warfield has pled no facts to show that the ""multiple city blocks"" in ""the area surrounding 30th Street Station"" are Amtrak's 
property or the property of any entity against whom it may assert claims for First Amendment violations. "
520,12," In support of this argument, defendant cites Congress's admonition that Amtrak ""maximize its revenues and minimize 
Government subsidies."" 49 U.S.C. ยง 24101(d). Defendant also argues that protecting revenue is a legitimate government 
objective. Amtrak Br. at 28 (citing Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 304, 94 S. Ct. 2714, 41 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1974) 
(upholding a city transit system's regulation to prohibit political advertising because, among other reasons, ""[r]evenue earned 
from long-term commercial advertising could be jeopardized"")). "
521,13, There is no dispute that Pennsylvania law governs the contract-based claims in Warfield's complaint.
521,14," Warfield bases this claim solely on Amtrak's alleged breach regarding the marketing table, so Amtrak's purported meddling 
with Warfield's billboard advertising plays no role in this part of the analysis. "

] Apart from affording damages and injunctive relief, HRS ch. 480 also declares that ""[a]ny contract or agreement in violation of [HRS ch. 480] is void and is not enforceable at law or in equity."" HRS ยง 480-12. "
552,5," The Connecticut Supreme Court, which has looked to the standard set forth in Sperry & Hutchinson in interpreting the 
Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, has observed that ""a serious question exists concerning whether [that standard] remains 
the guiding rule utilized by the federal trade commission."" Am. Car Rental, Inc. v. Comm'r of Consumer Prot., 273 Conn. 296, 
869 A.2d 1198, 1205 n.6 (Conn. 2005) (citing Am. Fin. Serv., 767 F.2d at 969-70)."
552,6," Plaintiffs point out that, in Hawai'i Medical Ass'n, physicians sued a health insurer,  [**22] asserting that they had not received 
monies to which they were contractually entitled as part of the basis for their claim under HRS ch. 480. Pls.' Opp'n 9 (citing "
553,," Hawaii Med. Ass'n, 113 Hawai'i at 88, 148 P.3d at 1190). They note that, at no point in the Hawai'i Supreme Court's exhaustive 
review of Hawaii law on unfair methods of competition in that case did the court so much as hint that the existence of a contract 
between the physicians and the insurer, or its alleged breach, meant that a claim for unfair methods of competition would be 
barred. Id. While it is true that the court did not suggest that the existence of a contract precludes an unfair competition claim, it is also true 
that the court did not intimate for a moment that an ordinary breach of contract claim is, without more, sufficient to sustain an 
unfair competition claim. See Defs.' Reply 3. Indeed, Hawaii Medical Ass'n was no ordinary breach of contract case. The matter 
involved a claim that a health insurer had engaged in an unfair and deceptive scheme through the systematic denial, reduction, 
or delay of reimbursement to physicians for medically necessary services for its insureds. Hawaii Med. Ass'n, 113 Hawai'i at 88, 
148 P.3d at 1190.  [**23] Special policy considerations arise when an insurer improperly denies benefits to its insureds. Those 
considerations are simply not present in an ordinary breach of contract case. See Best Place v. Penn Am. Ins. Co., 82 Hawai'i 
120, 132, 920 P.2d 334, 346 (1996) (""[T]he policy considerations surrounding the adoption of the tort of bad faith in the 
insurance context are atypical and will not necessarily extend to all types of contracts.""); Francis v. Lee Enters., 89 Hawai'i 234, 
242 n.3, 971 P.2d 707, 715 n.3 (1999) (noting that the decision to abolish the tort of tortious breach of contract ""in no way 
affect[ed] [the] prior decisions, such as Best Place, recognizing the tort of bad faith within the insurance context""). Thus, the 
Court does not read Haw. Med. Ass'n as suggesting that a run-of-the-mill breach of contract is, by itself, enough to give rise to 
an unfair competition claim. "
554,7," The Hawai'i legislature codified the rule against penalty clauses when it adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code. 
Specifically, HRS ยง 490:2-718(1), which applies to transactions in goods, provides that: HN18[
] Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is 
reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the 
inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated 
damages is void as a penalty. HRS ยง 490:2-718(1). Professor Corbin's treatise notes that the Uniform Commercial Code's formulation of the rule against 
penalties differs from the common law approach insofar as it evaluates ""whether the sum is a reasonable pre-estimate of the 
probable or actual loss."" 11 Corbin on Contracts ยง 58.1, at 398 (emphasis in original)."
554,8," Unlike Professor Corbin's treatise, which does not view a penalty provision as violative of public policy, the Restatement 
(Second) of Contracts ยง 365(1) (1981) states that ""[a]  [**29] term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is 
unenforceable on grounds of public policy as a penalty."" "
556,9," It would appear that the applicable statute of limitations for a tortious interference claim is HRS ยง 657-7, which sets a two-year 
limitations period. See Roberts v. City & County of Honolulu, CV. NO. 07-00391 DAE-KSC, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16068, at *10-
*11 (D. Haw. Mar. 3, 2008) (""Although Hawaii courts have not specifically addressed the question of whether the two-year 
statute of limitations or the six-year statute of limitations applies to intentional interference with contract and prospective 
business relationships claims, Hawaii courts have stated that the two-year statute of limitations generally applies to tort actions, 
and that intentional interference with contract and prospective business relationships claims are torts.""). In addition, with respect 
to Count I, the applicable statute of limitations for an unfair competition claim is set forth in HRS ยง 480-24, which provides that: 
""Any action to enforce a cause of  [**37] action arising under [HRS ch. 480] shall be barred unless commenced within four years 
after the cause of action accrues, except as otherwise provided in [HRS ยงยง 480-24(b) and] 480-22. For the purpose of this 
section, a cause of action for a continuing violation is deemed to accrue at any time during the period of the violation."" The Court 
expresses no opinion as to any statute of limitations issues at this time since the parties did not raise or brief these issues. "

592,1," In her first amended complaint (""FAC""), Ms. Clemens has formally pled two separate causes of action, one for violation of TILA 
and the other for violation of Regulation Z. However, as noted above, Regulation Z is simply TILA's implementing regulation. See "
593,," McCoy v. Chase Manhattan Bank, USA, 559 F.3d 963, 964 (9th Cir. 2009) (noting that Regulation Z was adopted by the Federal 
Reserve Board to implement TILA). Therefore, the Court addresses the two causes of action as one."
593,2," In the FAC, Ms. Clemens actually refers to March 2008 but this appears to be a typographical error. "
595,3," At the very least, JPMorgan has not asserted that it is not a creditor for purposes of the statute. "
597,4," Section 2923.52 specifically provides that it does not become operative until """"14 days after the issuance of regulations . . . by 
the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 2923.53.""  [*18] See Cal. Civ. Code ยง 2923.52(d); see also id. ยง

597,6," JPMorgan was given temporary exemption on June 15, 2009. Later, it received permanent exemption on July 7, 2009. See 
Docket No. 30 (RJN, Ex. 8). "
598,7," The Court agrees with the Distor court that, if a TILA claim is barred by the statute of limitations, then it may not be used as a 
predicate UCL violation. See Distor, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98361, at *21; see also Silvas v. E*Trade Mortg. Corp., 514 F.3d 
1001, 1007 n.3 (9th Cir. 2008) (noting that ""[a]n attempt by Appellants to go outside the congressionally enacted limitation period 
of TILA is an attempt to enforce a state regulation in an area expressly preempted by federal law""). "
599,8," At the hearing on Defendants' motions, Ms. Clemens argued that, because of the improper surveillance, FAT knew when she 
would not be home and therefore changed the locks on the doors when she was not present. "
603,1," Plaintiffs allege ""the relevant geographic market"" for each of the thirty-three product markets is the ""United States."" (See FAC P 
16.) Defendants have not argued that plaintiffs' allegation of a nationwide market is deficient. "
604,2," Plaintiffs do not explain how these two alleged ""innovation markets"" differ. Plaintiffs do not allege, for example, that defendants 
are developing, or have ever developed, non-brand name prescription drugs. "
605,3," The allegation plaintiffs make with respect to the other product markets is substantially similar to that set forth with respect to 
the market for brand name prescription anti-bacterials, with the exception that, as to some of the markets, plaintiffs fail to identify 
the names of the products sold. (See, e.g., FAC P 27 (alleging that ""[i]n the market for brand name prescription drugs for the 
treatment of renal-cell carcinoma, Pfizer and Wyeth have products that are competitive."").) "
606,4," In contrast to the allegations set forth in the FAC with respect to the various products designed for use by humans, the 
allegations in the FTC Complaint state in a concise manner evidentiary facts to support a finding that the effect of the merger 
may be to substantially  [*18] lessen competition in the animal health markets specified therein. For example, with respect to the 
alleged product market for cattle macrocyclic lactone parasiticides, the FTC Complaint alleges as follows: Pfizer, [Wyeth], and Merial are the only three branded players in the U.S. market for cattle macrocyclic lactone 
parasiticides. The proposed acquisition would significantly increase the concentration in this market, leaving Pfizer with 
approximately 42 percent of this $ 118 million market. Suppliers of generic macrocyclic lactone products do not provide a 
serious competitive constraint due to their poor reputation in this market. Further, such suppliers sell generic versions of 
only Merial's product; there are no generic versions of Pfizer's or [Wyeth's] products currently available. (See FAC, Ex. A P 15.)"
606,5," With their opposition, plaintiffs offer a declaration by the owner of plaintiff Golden Gate Pharmacy Services, Inc. (""Golden Gate 
Pharmacy""), who states that Golden Gate Pharmacy ""dispenses animal health care products, including Pfizer's Rimadyl and 
Zenequin and Wyeth's [Fort Dodge's] Viokase V."" (See Lofholm Decl., filed November 13, 2009, P 1, 3.) In reply, defendants 
argue the declaration is insufficient, because the declarant does not state that Golden Gate Pharmacy purchases animal health 
products within any of the twenty-one markets identified in the FTC Complaint, thus apparently taking  [*20] the position that 
Rimadyl, Zenequin, and Viokase V are not products within any of the subject animal health markets. As discussed below, the 
Court will afford plaintiffs further leave to amend. On the limited record before the Court at this time, the Court cannot determine 
whether purchases of Rimadyl, Zenequin, or Viokase V, if alleged in a Second Amended Complaint, would suffice to establish 
standing. "
607,6," Defendants have offered copies of the FTC's order requiring defendants to divest themselves of various  [*21] assets, as well 
as statements issued by the FTC concerning that order. (See Everett Decl. Exs. A, B, C.) None of those documents, however, 
constitutes evidence that defendants, subsequent to the FTC's order, in fact divested themselves of the subject assets. "

Incorporated; Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.; Banc of

named in the breach of fiduciary duty claim-- Morgan Stanley & Co., Incorporated; The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.; Citigroup 
Inc.; and Credit Suisse (USA) Inc. "
613,4," ETG's Amended Class Action Complaint (the ""complaint"") also alleges that the prime brokers (i) failed to enforce the delivery of 
securities, thereby enabling the prime brokers to charge borrowing fees for securities that were never actually borrowed and 
giving rise to intentional FTDs; and (ii) charged improper locate fees when the securities were never found and/or borrowed. On 
appeal, ETG argues that the complaint's ""references to failures to deliver"" and ""improper and unjustified locate fees"" were 
""pleaded [only] as an adjunct to [ETG's] price-fixing claim."" Appellant's Reply Br. 17 & 17 n.12. The prime brokers argue that 
ETG improperly seeks to amend the complaint on appeal by recharacterizing these allegations from integral components of the 
conspiracy to ancillary means of expanding the conspiracy's scope. Appellees' Opp'n  [**9] Br. 24-25. We do not reach this 
issue, because dismissal remains appropriate even if we adopt ETG's appellate posture."
613,5," The district court did not reach the alternative Rule 9(b) ground for dismissal of the antitrust claim. We do not reach this ground 
because we affirm the district court's Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. "
618,6," Because all four of the Billing considerations point in the direction of implied preclusion, we need not address the weight to be 
accorded these  [**26] considerations when they point in different directions. "
620,1," Defendants have also filed a motion for leave to issue seven subpoenas duces tecum. It appears that the evidence sought by 
these subpoenas is for the purpose of establishing that other third parties were aware of the nature of defendants. relationship 
with the Berman Group. Because I am holding that any such knowledge by third parties is immaterial, I will deny defendants. 
motion for leave to issue the subpoenas. If defendants wish to obtain other information from third parties that is material, I will 
authorize the issuance of subpoenas they request."
620,2," Even if a joint venture does allegedly have an existence and purpose extrinsic to price fixing, it may still be challenged as a 
sham. See Dagher, 547 U.S. at 6 n.1. In the instant case, however, the issue is not whether the joint venture alleged by 
defendants is a sham but whether this purported joint venture is a single entity within the meaning of Dagher. "
632,1," Although included in the title of  [*7] Plaintiffs' Motion, Plaintiffs do not address, and the Court therefore does not consider, the 
issue of appointing class counsel."
632,2," For a more in-depth discussion of Plaintiffs' claims and the procedural background of this litigation, see the Court's opinions in 
Schoenbaum v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., 517 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1129-33 (E.D. Mo. 2007), vacated in part, 2007 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 82343, 2007 WL 3331291 (E.D. Mo. 2007) and Schoenbaum v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., 2009 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 33313, 2009 WL 1045469, at *1-*2 (E.D. Mo. 2009). "
633,3," In 1997, Monsanto introduced its first YieldGard(R) corn seed product, with resistance to the European corn borer, and it began 
marketing a distinct YieldGard(R) corn seed product with root worm resistance in 2003. Monsanto introduced YieldGard(R) Plus 
in 2004, which contains both traits. "
635,4," On this point, the Court found the district court's discussion of preliminary approval of settlements in New Motor Vehicles 
especially insightful. There,  [*19] the court noted that the term ""preliminary approval"" may be misleading, in the sense that it is 
really only a determination by the court that it is appropriate to send notice to the classes, and should not be understood to 
express any real opinion as to the fairness of the settlement. 236 F.R.D. at 55-56 (internal citations omitted). Instead, the court 
suggested that preliminary approval may be more accurately understood as a finding that there is ""probable cause"" to proceed 
with notice to the class and to schedule a fairness hearing. Id. at 56 n.2; see also Nilsen v. York County, 228 F.R.D. 60, 62 (D. 
Me. 2005) (""Despite the usage of the Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth), ยง 21.632 (2004), and what I have done in previous 
class actions following that usage, I do not characterize this order as a preliminary fairness determination. Because a judicial "
636,," declaration of 'preliminary fairness' unjustifiably suggests a built-in headwind against objections to the settlement, I am 
determining simply whether the proposed settlement agreement deserves consideration by the class and whether the notice is 
appropriate.""). "
637,5," There is, however, the argument that Plaintiffs' proof of antitrust impact will require individualized inquiries, a possibility that the 
Court addresses below in its discussion of the predominance requirement. "
638,6," Although the inquiry into final approval of the settlement is distinct from that regarding class certification, the Court will also 
need to consider the propriety of this release of damages claims in deciding whether the settlement is ""fair, reasonable, and 
adequate."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). "
641,7," The Court notes that should classes be certified for purposes of settlement, Monsanto will not have any involvement in 
determining whether Plaintiffs and Pioneer are entitled to final approval of the settlement under Rule 23(e). "
649,1," โฆ Plaintiffs do not challenge the summary judgment rendered against them on their due process violation claims. Therefore, 
the trial court's take-nothing judgment as to that claim is affirmed without further discussion."
649,2," โฆ The Texas Antitrust Act is modeled on both the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Act.  [**6] Caller-Times Publ'g Co. v. 
Triad Commc'ns, Inc., 826 S.W.2d 576, 580 (Tex. 1992). The Texas Antitrust Act provides that it is to be interpreted ""in harmony 
with federal judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes to the extent consistent with this purpose."" TEX. BUS. 
& COM . CODE ANN. ยง 15.04 (Vernon 2002). Therefore, it is appropriate that we look to federal case law for guidance. "
650,3," โฆ The confusion arises from cases that use the phrase ""antitrust injury"" in the context of a discussion of standing  [**10] as 
well in the context of a discussion of the merits of a plaintiff's antitrust claim. See, e.g., Mathews v. Lancaster Gen. Hosp., 87 
F.3d 624, 641 (3rd Cir. 1996) (in analyzing merits of antitrust claim, and not standing, court held analysis of ""antitrust injury"" 
must be from consumer's viewpoint); Oksanen, 945 F.2d at 708 (in analyzing merits of antitrust claim, and not standing, court 
held antitrust plaintiff held burden of proving concerted action caused ""antitrust injury"" by imposing unreasonable restraint on 
trade). "
651,4," โฆ In examining whether the defendants were entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on the merits of plaintiffs' 
claims, we examined all evidence cited to by the plaintiffs in their consolidated response without regard to the admissibility 
 [**11] of the evidence. Therefore, because we assume for the purpose of this appeal that the defendants' objections to the 
plaintiffs' evidence should have been denied and because we reviewed all evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, 
we do not reach the plaintiffs' first four issues on appeal, all of which dealt with the trial court's evidentiary rulings."
651,5, โฆ The plaintiffs alleged no complaints against North Central Baptist in the underlying lawsuit. 
653,6," ? The granting or retention of a doctor's hospital privileges is a process known as ""credentialing."" St. Luke's Episcopal Hosp. v. 
Agbor, 952 S.W.2d 503, 505 (Tex. 1997). Hospitals and physicians are not only encouraged to report professional incompetence 
on the part of other doctors, but in some instances, they are required to report it. Under the federal Health Care Quality 
Improvement Act (""HCQIA"") of 1986, a health care entity must report to the state board of medical examiners any professional 
review action that adversely affects the clinical privileges of a physician. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 11133(a)(1). This information is then 
forwarded by the state board to the  [**22] National Practitioner Data Bank. See id. ยง 11133(b). Upon request, the data bank 
must provide the adverse action information it receives to state licensing boards, hospitals, and other organizations that have 
entered into, or may be entering into, an employment or affiliation relationship with the subject physician or to which the 
physician has applied for clinical privileges or appointment to the staff. Id. ยง 11137(a). The HCQIA requires this information be 
kept confidential by the recipient, and any breach of confidentiality is subject to a civil monetary penalty. Id. ยง 11137(b). "
655,7," To support their argument that there was no anticompetitive affect, the defendants rely on a ""document"" they allege  [**28] the 
plaintiffs provided to the Department of Justice, which states as follows: STRUCTURE OF PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY IN SAN ANTONIO Interestingly, Manhattan has only 4 board certified pediatric neurosurgeons with a significantly greater population. The children of San Antonio could be easily served by 2 pediatric neurosurgeons in terms of volume of cases. Call 
coverage then becomes the only issue. We have provided 24/7 call coverage between the two of us for 10 years. 
[Emphasis added.] The problem with this ""document"" is that it is attached to the Methodist Defendants' brief in support of their counterclaims, and it 
does not appear to have been included in the summary judgment proof offered by any of the defendants. Therefore, we do not 
consider this document on appeal. "
656,8," The plaintiffs contend this case is ""exactly the same"" as the case considered by the Texarkana court in Gonzalez, in which that 
court held the procedural rights under the hospital's bylaws were contractual. 880 S.W.2d at 439. We disagree because here the 
contractual rights claimed to have been breached arise not from the Hospital Bylaws, but instead, from the Medical Staff Bylaws."

663,3," Octopus argues with respect to the other elements of tortious interference that Panterra fails to plead any facts that Octopus

692,*," The cases that Honeywell and the superior court rely on in support of the notion that the multiple and varied intermediaries in 
this case make it too complex to come up with a methodology capable of determining whether overcharges were passed on to 
end users are distinguishable. For the most part, those cases involve situations in which the proposed  [****30] class was made 
up of both end users and intermediaries and/or the product involved, unlike the thermostats in this case, was incorporated into 
various other products that proceeded through diverse distribution channels. E.g., Methionine, 204 F.R.D. at 165-66 (finding 
issues common to class did not predominate where proffered methodology proposed single pass-through rate of overcharges for 
all direct and indirect resellers making up class and where liquid product was added to other products sold through various 
distribution channels, but noting that if product had remained largely unchanged in form from manufacturer to indirect purchaser, 
assessing whether manufacturer's overcharges were passed on would be less difficult); see also Cipro, 17 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 10

antitrust laws are analyzed under the same rules and case law."" All Care Nursing Serv. v. High Tech Staffing Servs., 135 F.3d 
740, 746 n.11 (11th Cir. 1998). Indeed, ""[t]he Florida legislature has, in effect, adopted as the law of Florida the body of antitrust

715,4," The Court is cognizant of the fact that in Leegin, the Supreme Court noted that an increase in price alone will not show 
anticompetitive conduct. This case, however, appears distinguishable. In Leegin, the Court rejected a price increase argument 
that was based higher prices for the goods of the manufacturer imposing the restraint. This rejection was founded on the 
absence of a corresponding decrease in competition in the interbrand market which can later result in lower prices. Leegin, 551 
U.S. 895-97. By contrast, because of AT&T's market power and the bottlenecking of the downstream market at the wholesale 
level, AT&T's price increase could plausibly be extended across the interbrand market."

Georgia in July 2006. In April 2008, Aurora launched a promotional website, located at www.yoohoofriends.com. The website 
introduced the characters  [**5] and provided a background story for each; it also offers interactive games and other attractions.

735,29," Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Winter, the Ninth Circuit had held that to prevail on a motion for preliminary injunction, 
a plaintiff must demonstrate either: ""either: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury; or (2) that serious questions going 
to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in its favor. These two alternatives represent extremes 
of a single continuum, rather than two separate tests. Thus, the greater the relative hardship to the party seeking the

demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction."" Winter, 129 S.Ct. at 375 (emphasis original).

likely to occur absent an injunction that included two additional restrictions,. Winter, 129 S.Ct. at 376. In Sierra Forest Legacy, 
the Ninth Circuit reversed a district court's analysis and application of the non-merits injunctive relief factors that ""boiled down to 
a choice between"" allowing the  [**20] Forest Service to move ahead with a framework developed in 2004 or requiring the Forest 
Service to take no action at all with respect to fire prevention. The Ninth Circuit held that the district court erred by failing to

737,34," In addition, as respects in the Beanie Boos frog, husky, and monkey, Aurora has adduced no evidence that it filed an 
application for copyright registration or obtained a copyright on an analogous toy. Thus, to the extent such toys exist, the court is 
without jurisdiction to hear a copyright infringement claim respecting them. "
738,35," In its reply, Aurora asserts that it ""does not currently have versions of the applications stamped received by the copyright office 
in its possession, but given that the applications were sent almost a year prior to this lawsuit being initiated, it is reasonable to 
assume they have been received and are being processed."" (Reply at 2-3 n. 2.) Aurora proffers no declaration or other evidence 
that the applications were in fact mailed more than a year ago; nor, for the reasons stated, can  [**29] the court accept Aurora's 
invitation to assume that they have been received and are being processed. While Aurora submitted full copyright applications 
for the panda, penguin, and sugar glider plush toys in support of its reply (see Supplemental Declaration of Monica Fitzhugh in 
Support of Aurora World, Inc.'s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (""Fitzhugh Supp. Decl.""), Docket No. 25 (Dec. 7, 2009), Exh. L), 
which include the second page of the application, the first page of the applications is not complete in that it does not list an 
author. The second page of the sugar glider application, moreover, does not include a signature. (Id.) If the applications were 
sent to the Copyright Office in this form, as Aurora's director of product development asserts under penalty of perjury, the court 
cannot assume that they were accepted as properly filed and are being processed. Additionally, Fitzhugh does not state that a 
filing fee and deposit material accompanied the applications. (Id., P 5.) See 17 U.S.C. ยง 409 (""The application for copyright 
registration shall be made on a form prescribed by the Register of Copyrights and shall include . . . in the case of a work other

verifying that the copyright applications had been received in the Copyright Office and were being processed. Aurora made no 
attempt to show good cause for the late retrieval of this evidence and  [**31] Ty objected to its introduction. HN11[

739,37," Jeffrey Decl., P 3. "
740,38," The Ninth Circuit created a narrow exception to Subafilms' broad ruling in Los Angeles News Service v. Reuters Television 
International (USA) Ltd. (Reuters III), 149 F.3d 987 (9th Cir. 1998). It held that where the initial act of infringement, i.e., the 
manufacture of the copy, occurred in the United States, recovery based on subsequent reproduction and distribution abroad was 
permissible because ""the infringing use would have been actionable even if the subsequent foreign distribution that stemmed 
from that use never took place."" Id. at 991-92 (quoting Subafilms, 24 F.3d at 1094 (emphasis original)). ""Recovery of damages 
arising from overseas infringing uses was allowed because the predicate act of infringement occurring within the United States 
enabled further reproduction abroad."" Id. at 992. The Ninth Circuit subsequently  [**35] limited the Reuters III holding in Los Angeles News Service v. Reuters Television 
International (USA) Ltd. (Reuters V), 340 F.3d 926 (9th Cir. 2003), clarifying that ""no rational deterrent function is served by 
making an infringer whose domestic act of infringement -- from which he earns no profit -- leads to widespread extraterritorial 
infringement, liable for the copyright owner's entire loss of value or profit from that overseas infringement, particularly if the 
overseas infringement is legal where it takes place."" Id. at 931. Aurora cites a statement in Wuescher's declaration as evidence of a predicate act of domestic infringement. Wuescher states: ""I 
was one of several designers primarily responsible for the development and design of Ty's BEANIE BOOS TM line of plush 
toys."" (Wuescher Decl., P 3.) Aurora makes several assumptions based on this statement. First, it assumes that Wuescher 
referenced the Cleo and Bubblegum toys as well as other Beanie Boos. The context of the statement, however, undercuts this 
suggestion, as the preceding and succeeding paragraphs in the declaration discuss only Beanie Boos marketed in the United 
States. (Id., PP 2, 4.) Second, Aurora assumes without  [**36] foundation that Wuescher was in the United States when he 
participated in the design process. Third, based on Wuescher's assertion that he was ""primarily responsible"" for development 
and design of the Beanie Boos, it assumes that even if Wuescher supervised a process that occurred abroad from the United 
States, his supervision constitutes an actionable act of copyright infringement. This misapprehends Ninth Circuit law. Aurora cites Professor Nimmer's treatise, which states that ""if, and to the extent, a part of an 'act' of [copyright] infringement 
occurs within the United States, then, although such act is completed in a foreign jurisdiction, those parties who contributed to 
the act within the United States may be rendered liable under American copyright law."" 4 NIMMER ON COPYRIGHT, ยง 17.02 at 
17-19 (2008). Although potentially authoritative in other jurisdictions, Nimmer does not appear to state the law of this circuit. 
Rather, Reuters V, which Aurora does not cite, limited the holding of Reuters III, and concluded that ""an exception may apply 
where an act of infringement is completed entirely  [**37] within the United States and that such infringing act enabled further 
exploitation abroad."" Reuters V, 340 F.3d at 927 (emphasis supplied). To the extent Wuescher was directly involved in an 
allegedly infringing act, he makes clear that he was only ""one of several designers primarily responsible for the development and 
design."" (Wuescher Decl., P3.) If other participants in the design process were not in the United States, Wuescher's domestic 
acts of infringement do not justify extraterritorial application of the copyright laws under Reuters V, even if they would under 
Nimmer's formulation. This interpretation is consistent with the Ninth Circuit's desire to create a ""narrow application"" to avoid 
""over-deterrence [that] might chill the fair use of copyrighted works in close cases."" Reuters V, 340 F.3d at 931. In sum, the court cannot conclude that, standing alone, the single, general sentence in Wuescher's declaration on which Aurora 
relies demonstrates that it will likely succeed in proving the predicate facts necessary for extraterritorial application of the 
Copyright Act."
740,39," Aurora has adduced evidence that a marketing analyst in its employ purchased three sets of the ""UK edition Beanie Boos,"" 
which included the Cleo and Bubblegum plush toys, over the Internet. (Declaration of Francesca Noh in Support of Aurora 
World, Inc.'s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (""Noh Decl.""), Docket No. 28 (Dec. 7, 2009), P 2, Exh. A.) Aurora, however, has 
not adduced evidence that Ty has sold the Cleo and Bubblegum plush toys in the United States. The marketing analyst 
purchased the toys from an online reseller named ""Cindy Beans."" (Id.) That the Cleo and Bubblegum plush toys were not sold by 
Ty in this country is confirmed by the fact that the online reseller labeled the package the ""UK edition."" Given that Ty was not 
directly involved in the sale, and that it most probably offered  [**39] the toys sold by ""Cindy Beans"" outside the United States, "
741,," Aurora does not rely on the evidence to prove that Ty infringed its copyrights in the United States. For that purpose, Aurora looks 
to the Wuescher declaration. Aurora also relies on evidence that a sales sheet displaying the Cleo and Bubblegum toys was sent to a retailer in New Mexico. 
(Fitzhugh Supp. Decl., Exh. A.) Because it has not adduced evidence of an actual sale by Ty, however, this is insufficient to 
prove infringement. See, e.g., Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 487 F.3d 701, 718 (9th Cir. 2007) (""[T]he district court's 
conclusion [that distribution requires an 'actual dissemination'] is consistent with the language of the Copyright Act""); In re

unprotectable  [**52] elements can itself be a protectable element."" Metcalf, 294 F.3d at 1074. Aurora's evidence, however, does 
not reveal many generic similarities aggregated in a common pattern. Perhaps because it tacitly acknowledges this, Aurora 
engages, immediately following its citation of Metcalf, in a two-page argument concerning the plush toys' eyes."

however, has green coloring inside the ears and has a largely black lower body. Aurora's panda does not have green coloring 
and has a  [**55] largely white lower body with gray paws. (Wuescher Decl., P 12, Exh. F.) "
745,52," Even were the court to engage in a side-by-side comparison of Ty's and Aurora's penguins, it would not find their coloration

exploiting the Beanie Boos products."" ([Proposed] Preliminary Injunction, Docket No. 5 (Nov. 19, 2009) (emphasis supplied).) Its 
motion, however, did not discuss Ty's displays nor argue that there was infringement as a result. Similarly, Aurora's reply made 
only oblique references to Ty's displays. It noted the displays in the introductory section of the brief (see Motion at 1 (""Even as to 
those plush toys Ty claims  [**57] are not being sold in the United States . . . , Ty is at least . . . prominently displaying them in its 
promotional materials. . ."")), and in connection with its arguments regarding extraterritorial application of the Copyright Act (see 
Motion at 8 (""Ty has displayed and offered for sale Cleo and Bubblegum in the U.S. In fact, the two lemurs appeared to be Ty's 
marquee Beanie Boos as evidenced by Ty's display racks, which prominently display[ ] Cleo and Bubblegum as the only Beanie 
Boos on its signage. . . . In addition, Cleo and Bubblegum were highlighted on Ty's October 2009 sale sheet, which was sent to 
its U.S. customers"")). Aurora also discussed the display racks in arguing for extraterritorial application of the Lanham Act. (See 
Motion at 17 (""Indeed, the retail display signage for Beanie Boos includes a yellow tail . . . . Tellingly, Ty itself does not even 
make a Beanie Boo with a yellow tail"" (emphasis original).). Despite these references, Aurora has, at no time, attempted to make 
out a prima facie case of display infringement, cited to the sections of the Copyright Act governing display infringement, 
attempted to demonstrate that the actions of Ty fit any of the specified  [**58] definitions for display infringement, or cited to any 
cases regarding display infringement. Indeed, at oral argument counsel did no more than note that the displays existed and cite 
the statute. The court's analysis of the purported display infringement claim is, consequently, hampered by the fact that none of

746,57," The court has already concluded that Aurora's evidence suggests  [**61] it will be able to establish that it is entitled only to thin

747,59," It is not apparent which of its toys Aurora believes this caricature resembles. Among the toys Aurora lodged is a pink 
 [**63] and white ""ringtail cat."" This toy appears most similar to the pink toy displayed on Ty's rack. Aurora, however, made no 
reference to the ""ringtail cat"" plush toy in its briefs, and adduced no evidence that Aurora holds a copyright in the design or filed 
a copyright application for this toy. As respects the second caricature on the display rack, it appears most like Aurora's sugar glider. The coloration of the caricature 
and the sugar glider is not substantially similar, however, as the sugar glider has gray stripes across its face, gray ears and 
paws, green eyes, and a pink nose and mouth. The sugar glider also has webbing, similar to that found on a flying squirrel, 
running from its arms to its legs. The cartoon Beanie Boo has no gray coloring except two stripes on its tail. Rather, it is largely 
magenta and white, with pink hands and ears, has a black nose, pink eyes, and no mouth."
747,60," Even were the court to compare the cartoon Beanie Boo on the left of the display rack to Aurora's bush babies, it would not 
find substantial similarity in coloration. As Aurora notes in its reply, Ty does not make a Beanie Boo with a yellow striped tail. 
(Reply at 17.) Neither, indeed, does Aurora, although  [**64] it manufactures a YooHoo with a rust-colored tail and eyes. 
Although Aurora manufactures a blue-eyed bush baby, it does not have blue ears or a yellow tail."

presumes Aurora seeks a worldwide injunction."
748,63," This three-part test was originally articulated in Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America National Trust & Savings 
Association (Timberlane I), 549 F.2d 597 (9th Cir. 1976), where it was applied to antitrust law  [**69] under the Sherman Act. 
Subsequent to Timberlane I, Congress enacted section 6a of the Sherman Act, which governs the extraterritorial reach of the 
antitrust laws and supersedes the Ninth Circuit's test. See McGlinchy v. Shell Chemical Co., 845 F.2d 802, 814 n. 8 (9th Cir. 
1988) (recognized that Timberlane I was overruled by 15 U.S.C. ยง 6a). Although Timberlane I was overruled as respects 
extraterritorial application of the antitrust law, the three-part test remains valid for purposes of assessing the extraterritorial 
application of the Lanham Act and trademark law. "

750,70," Included in this inquiry is whether any injunction issued by this court could be enforced abroad. Mattel, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1130. 
Again, Aurora has neither pointed the court to the law of foreign jurisdictions indicating that its order  [**76] would be enforceable 
abroad, nor has it necessarily indicated an exhaustive list of countries in which such an international would be enforced."
750,71," Aurora does not represent that it has not brought enforcement actions in other countries and that it will not begin one while 
these proceedings are pending. Cf. Ocean Garden, 953 F.2d at 503  [**77] (""In the case before us, there are no pending 
proceedings in Hong Kong or Taiwan""). The Ocean Garden court appeared to hold that in the absence of pending proceedings, 
this factor would not weigh against extraterritorial application. Id. (""Absent a determination by the [foreign] court that [defendant] 
has a legal right to use the marks, and that those marks do not infringe [plaintiff's] mark, we are unable to conclude that it would 
be an affront to [the foreign country's] sovereignty or law""). Although some district courts continue to apply this holding, see, e.g., 
Mattel, 28 F.Supp.2d at 1130 (""Since there are no proceedings currently in Sweden or Denmark, and because the conduct 
complained of impacts the U.S. market, there is no real sovereign conflict,"" citing Ocean Garden, 953 F.2d at 503), this 
interpretation was explicitly repudiated in Reebok: ""In Ocean Garden, we quoted with approval the district court's statement in Reebok I that ""[s]ince to this Court's knowledge 
there has been no adjudication on the merits in the Mexican courts, there is no danger at this time of this preliminary 
injunction interfering with the laws of a foreign nation."" Ocean Garden, 953 F.2d at 504. Demonstration  [**78] of a present 
and direct conflict between the laws of two nations, however, is unnecessary: it is a sufficiently cognizable interest under "
751,," the Timberlane test for there to exist the possibility of a conflict between the law or policy of the United States and the law 
or policy of another nation. Of course, the degree of the risk of conflict is highly relevant to the weight of that factor in the 
Timberlane balance: the greater the possibility of conflict, the less the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction is justified, and 
vice-a-versa."" Reebok, 970 F.2d at 555 n. 2 (emphasis original). HN29[
] Under Reebok, a pending proceeding abroad is not a sine qua non of the conflicting law analysis. Because Aurora has 
presented no evidence regarding the existence of a conflict of any kind, and has not addressed whether there are pending 
proceedings between the parties in another jurisdiction, the court cannot evaluate the weight of this factor."
751,72," Ty repeatedly cites this omission as a glaring deficiency in Aurora's motion. (Opp. at 2, 16, 18, 19 & nn. 11, 12, 13). Although 
presumably sales figures for YooHoo & Friends products are entirely within Aurora's control, and although Aurora adduced 
significant additional evidence in support of its reply, it presented no information regarding its U.S. sales."
751,73," In Winterland Concessions Co. v. Fenton, 835 F. Supp. 529 (N.D. Cal. 1993), the court found intentional infringement where 
defendant, knowing  [**80] of plaintiffs' exclusive rights in photographs of popular artists, used them without paying licensing 
fees. Id. at 531. While Aurora has established that Ty had access to YooHoo & Friends in the marketplace, there is no evidence 
that Ty actually knew YooHoo & Friends products existed."
751,74," There is an exception to the territoriality principle that recognizes that those who use marks in other countries can, when their 
marks are famous enough, claim exclusive rights to the marks in this country. To invoke this exception,  [**81] a trademark

757,87," Id., P 5. Aurora proffers worldwide advertising figures as well, noting that it spent $ 274,176 on worldwide advertising from 
January 2008 to July 2009, and $ 669,000 creating the YooHoo & Friends animated series that aired abroad. (Id., PP 6, 8.) 
Based on this evidence, Aurora's reply cites cases concerning worldwide advertising. In Conagra, Inc. v. Singleton, 743 F.2d 
1508 (11th Cir. 1984), the court mentioned the amount defendant Singleton spent worldwide to promote its name. Id. at 1513. 
This was not dispositive of the case,  [**105] however, and was only marginally relevant, as the court noted that the fact that the 
Singleton name had acquired secondary meaning was ""hardly in dispute."" Indeed, in oral argument, opposing counsel conceded 
that the name had acquired secondary meaning. Id. at 1513 & n. 6. Additionally, there was evidence that Singleton's advertising 
efforts ""were consciously directed at establishing the Singleton mark and its relationship to Singleton Packing's business."" With 
the possible exception of evidence regarding the animated series (which potentially could be said to be directed at brand 
identification), such evidence is missing here. Id. at 1513. In Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp., 55 F. 
Supp. 2d 1070 (C.D. Cal. 1999), the district court recognized that various of Playboy's magazines had been marketed and 
distributed in interstate commerce and that one -- Playboy Magazine -- had been marketed and distributed internationally. Id. at 
1076. The court found that ""[b]ecause of the duration and extent of [plaintiff's] advertising, use and publicity of the trademarks 
Playboy(R) and Playmate(R), these trademarks have acquired significant recognition and goodwill worldwide,  [**106] have 
become inherently distinctive and have acquired secondary meaning."" Id. at 1077. While Playboy Enterprises suggests that 
worldwide advertising has some relevance, it is clear the evidence showed that a substantial part of that advertising took place in 
the United States. Finally, in Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Asiafocus International, Inc., No. Civ.A. 97-734-A, 1998 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 10359, 1998 WL 724000 (E.D. Va. Apr. 10, 1988), the court found that the fact that the Playboy mark had acquired 
secondary meaning ""[could not] reasonably be disputed, ""as they had been promoted ""through national and international 
advertising."" 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10359, [WL] at *8. As with Playboy's action against Netscape Communications, therefore, it 
is clear that Playboy presented evidence of national advertising in the Asiafocus case. Additionally, as in Conagra's action 
against Singleton, it is clear that whether the mark had acquired secondary meaning was seriously disputed. While each of these cases is distinguishable, the court does not mean to suggest that evidence of international advertising is 
always irrelevant in assessing whether a mark had acquired secondary meaning. Given that the court has determined that 
exterritorial application of the  [**107] Lanham Act is not warranted in this case, however, it is clear that the figures that are 
relevant are advertising and sales figures for the United States, not worldwide advertising and sales figures. "

31080, 2004 WL 5644805, *15-17 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 7, 2004), the court offered a thorough analysis of the issue. It explained that

] ""[s]ince '[t]he test for likelihood of confusion is whether a 'reasonably prudent consumer' in the marketplace is likely to 
be confused as to the origin of the good or service bearing one of the marks,' Dreamwerks Production Group v. SKG Studio, 142 
F.3d 1127, 1129 (9th Cir.1998) (emphasis added), statements by a retailer or distributor that he or she was confused do[ ] not 
necessarily show confusion by consumers."" 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31080, [WL] at *15. The court noted, however, that ""several 
circuits and courts ha[d] held that such evidence [was] probative of consumer confusion."" Id. (citing ; Beacon Mut. Ins. Co. v. 
Onebeacon Ins. Group, 376 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir. 2004);  [**127] Imagineering, Inc. v. Van Klassens, Inc., 53 F.3d 1260, 1265 
(Fed. Cir. 1995); Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready Inc., 531 F.2d 366, 384 (7th Cir. 1976)GTFM, Inc. v. Solid Clothing, Inc.,

Nonetheless, the Icon Enterprises court explained, ""[t]he Ninth Circuit. . . ha[d] never embraced the theory that a showing of 
actual confusion on the part of retailers or distributors is, ipso facto, probative of actual consumer confusion because retailers 
and distributors, being members of the trade, are less likely to be confused."" 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31080, [WL] at *16. The 
court next examined the Ninth Circuit's opinion in Japan Telecom, Inc. v. Japan Telecom American, Inc., 287 F.3d 866, 874 (9th 
Cir. 2002), which addressed whether declarations from plaintiff's business partners were relevant to prove that plaintiff's mark 
had attained secondary meaning. The Ninth Circuit stated: ""Although all the declarants claim to have the sort of mental recognition that's characteristic of secondary meaning, Japan 
Telecom has not come forward with evidence that they formed this recognition for any reason other than their 
 [**128] personal relationships with Japan Telecom or its president. Consequently, their declarations are not persuasive 
evidence that a significant number of consumers have formed a similar mental association. Had they formed their mental 
association with Japan Telecom because of some stimulus that was just as likely to affect members of the buying public as 
it was likely to affect them (such as advertising), their declarations would have been more persuasive."" Id. at 875 (internal 
citations omitted) "
764,," The Icon Enterprises court reasoned that ""although it involved the use of actual confusion evidence in a somewhat different context, Japan Telecom suggests that 
the Ninth Circuit is skeptical of the proposition that confusion on the part of dealers is necessarily probative or reflective of 
consumer attitudes. Rather, Japan Telecom suggests that the Ninth Circuit would look to the circumstances giving rise to 
the dealer's confusion to determine whether, under similar circumstances, an ordinary consumer would be as likely to be 
confused."" Icon Enterprises, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31080, 2004 WL 5644805 at *17. Employing this approach, the court declined to admit testimony regarding confusion on the part of a retailer because ""the 
 [**129] circumstances giving rise to his confusion . . . [were] not the circumstances under which an ordinary consumer is likely 
to encounter Defendants' product."" Id. On the other hand, it admitted evidence of confusion by a different retailer who was 
""confused after seeing an ad for [the product] in a [ ] catalogue"" because ""a consumer is likely to encounter Defendants' product 
in the same context."" Id. In the present case, Aurora has provided no detail regarding the circumstances under which the retailers came into contact with 
Ty's toys. To the extent they saw the toys outside the United States, their view would not be probative of confusion in the United 
States, because the retailers may well have seen Beanie Boos not sold in the United States. To the extent they saw the typs on 
a sales sheet, this does not appear probative, as consumers likely encounter Ty's products in person at a store, not via a visual 
depiction on a sales sheet. In any event, because the emails indicate that the speakers were not confused, and correctly 
identified the fact the toys manufactured by Ty and those manufactured by Aurora, the court need not reach address the issue."

765,103, Motion at 19.
765,104, Neither party offers any evidence regarding the price of the products.
765,105," In its reply, Aurora appears to argue that because the Ty tag contains a Beanie Boos logo in the upper right portion of the 
heart, it looks similar to the trademarked YooHoo logo. (Reply at 17.) Neither in its complaint or elsewhere has Aurora claimed 
trademark infringement on the basis of its YooHoo logo. The court therefore declines to consider the argument, particularly as it 
was made for the first time in reply."
765,106," Wuescher Decl., P 24."
765,107," In its reply, Aurora contends that Ty's argument regarding hang tags ignores Ninth Circuit law regarding post-sale confusion. 
(Reply at 16-17.) ""The law in the Ninth Circuit is clear that 'post-purchase confusion,' i.e., confusion  [**135] on the part of 
someone other than the purchaser who, for example, simply sees the item after it has been purchased, can establish the 
required likelihood of confusion under the Lanham Act."" Au-Tomotive Gold, Inc. v. Volkswagen of America, Inc., 457 F.3d 1062, 
1077 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Karl Storz Endoscopy-America, Inc. v. Surgical Technologies, Inc., 285 F.3d 848, 854 (9th Cir. 
2002)). Aurora's claim is curious because it is not that Ty ignores the Ninth Circuit law regarding post-purchase confusion, but 
that Aurora has failed to present any evidence of such confusion. See Karl Storz, 285 F.3d at 855 (holding that evidence of post-
purchase confusion among doctors supported a finding of likelihood of confusion); Au-Tomotive Gold, 457 F.3d at 1078 (holding 
that the possibility of post-purchase confusion, without evidence of confusion, left the confusion factor in ""equipoise""). The court credits to some extent Aurora's assertion that, because many consumers remove the hang tag after purchase, its 
confusion-obviating effect is limited. Aurora relies on an exhibit that bears a U.K. hang-tag, which informs the purchaser to 
remove the tag before giving the toy to a child. (Kessler Decl.,  [**136] Exh. G.) Aurora makes several assumptions based on 
this evidence. The first is that the same warning is present on U.S. hang tags. If this is the case, Aurora could have presented 
direct evidence of the fact since it presumably has access to Beanie Boos available in the U.S. market. Second, Aurora 
presumes that removing the hang tag will eliminate all post-sale confusion because all consumers of the toys are children. The 
only consumers about whom Aurora has presented evidence thus far, however, appear to be adult collectors running the Leon 
and Sondra website. Given the existence of this website, it is not implausible to infer that many of one or both companies' "
766,," consumers are collectors, who would likely not remove the hang tag following purchase. Aurora's evidence, moreover, is offered 
for the limited purpose of rebutting Ty's arguments regarding the consumer's degree of care at the moment of purchase. It is 
noteworthy that at that point, the hang tag is attached. "

769,111," Follwing eBay, the Federal Circuit expressly declined to address whether the presumption of irreparable harm continued to 
apply in the context of a motion for preliminary injunction. See Sanofi-Synthelabo v. Apotex, Inc., 470 F.3d 1368, 1383 n. 9 (Fed. 
Cir. 2006). Absent definitive guidance from the Ninth Circuit on this issue, the court finds persuasive the reasoning of numerous 
district courts that have disregarded the presumption  [**150] in preliminary injunction proceedings. As Judge O'Malley 
recognized in Erico International Corp., ""the [eBay] Court did not limit its holding"" to permanent injunctions, and the Court's 
""reasoning likely applies with even greater force at the preliminary injunction stage."" 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1367, 2007 WL 
108450 at *7. This is because entitlement to a permanent injunction requires a showing of actual success on the merits rather 
than merely a showing of likelihood of success on the merits. See Amoco Prod. Co. v. Village of Gambell, 480 U.S. 531, 546 n. 
12, 107 S. Ct. 1396, 94 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1987) (""The standard for a preliminary injunction is essentially the same as for a

success""); accord PGBA, LLC v. United States, 389 F.3d 1219, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2004). If irreparable harm cannot be presumed in 
the case of a trademark or copyright holder who has conclusively demonstrated to the trier of fact that his mark or trade dress 
has been infringed, a fortiori it should not be presumed in the case of a trade dress holder who has shown only likely 
infringement based on the under-developed factual record available at the preliminary  [**151] injunction stage."

784,3," The ""Cellophane fallacy,"" a theory criticizing the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 
351 U.S. 377, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956)  [**17] for a logical error in product substitution, has more to do with product "
785,," market definition than geographic market definition. Still, on its face it exposes the unspoken starting point for cases such as 
Little Rock Cardiology, that prices are competitive already, when current prices may not in fact be competitive."
785,4," This test is taken from the Department of Justice Horizontal Merger Guidelines, which  [**19] are discussed in detail below."
785,5," This test focuses on imports and exports among neighboring countries; it has been frequently criticized, although it was 
adopted in the Oracle Case, and used against Professor Elzinga, who testified on the Government's behalf that it should not 
apply under the facts of Oracle."
785,6," This includes  [**20] both Eastman Kodak and Oracle, both of which found that customers in the United States had the 
practical ability to turn to competitors should the alleged anticompetitive actor increase prices. Eastman Kodak at 1471; Oracle 
at 1163 (finding that a major competing product that is sold only in Europe ""would do just fine in the United States,"" and thus 
inferring that it was a product to which United States customers could reasonably turn). "
786,7, Kolon Oppo. Memo. at 6; DuPont Reply Memo. at 4.
786,8," Kolon notes ""that the market definition tests used for merger analysis are not completely apposite to market definition for 
monopoly cases."" Kolon Oppo. Memo. at 8. However, Kolon gives the court no guidance as to whether the Guidelines' force is 
any less persuasive in the monopolization context, nor whether any theoretical adjustments are required in applying them to the 
different context. "
787,9," Kolon alleges that, before 2001, ""for nearly three decades . . . DuPont's Kevlar with [another firm's para-aramid product] held a 
global duopoly,"" and that ""DuPont's market share remains greater than 70% of all sales by purchase volume of para-aramid fiber 
in the United States."" 2d Am. Compl. PP 15, 17. But Kolon does not allege a present global monopoly or duopoly. "
788,10," Another plausible inference is that DuPont has already raised its prices with impunity. Yet another plausible inference is that 
pricing is higher in the United States because of the ""qualification analysis and tests"" that Kolon alleges American customers 
require, as opposed to DuPont's anticompetitive conduct. But, for the purposes of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the claimant meets its 
burden by setting forth one plausible inference among several. "
789,11," The information required to plausibly allege monopoly power in such a restricted market, as opposed to an unrestricted 
market, may be very difficult to discover, but it is necessary for Kolon to have a viable claim. It is necessary because, as 
explained infra, Kolon is unable to allege an adequate degree of market foreclosure, as required to show anticompetitive effects 
from DuPont's supply agreements, if the market is expanded to include customers restricted by the Berry Amendment. To 
summarize that explanation here, DuPont has executed supply agreements, covering various periods from 2006 through the end 
of 2010, with four of its top twelve customers. Given all the surrounding circumstances, this percentage does not allow for a 
plausible claim of substantial foreclosure. However, if the customers restricted by the Berry Amendment  [**36] are excluded, 
then DuPont has executed supply agreements with four of its top seven customers -- a majority, and a number plausibly allowing 
for an adequate degree of foreclosure. "
791,12," The Court also dismissed, with prejudice, Kolon's other allegations of anticompetitive conduct, namely those rooted in 
DuPont's disparagement of Kolon's product and DuPont's joint ventures with rivals. DuPont v. Kolon, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
76795, at *33. "
793,13," Notably, the case finding 24% to be substantial foreclosure, involved ""contracts of greater than ten years' duration."" Twin City 
Sportservice, Inc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co., 676 F.2d 1291, 1302 (9th Cir. 1982)."
793,14," As DuPont does not appear to be a strict monopolist, because Teijin appears to possess a substantial percentage of the 
market share, the extent to which this authority helps Kolon is not clear. However, as the Third Circuit observed in LePage's, 
Inc., ""even the foreclosure of 'one significant competitor' from the market may lead to higher prices and reduced output."" 324 
F.3d at 159 (citations omitted). "
794,15," The cases DuPont lists for its proposition that ""substantial foreclosure"" applies equally to ยง 2 cases, DuPont Memo. at 9 fn.3, 
demonstrate only that HN33[
] it is possible for exclusive dealing agreements to have so little impact that they meet neither the 
higher ยง 2 standard nor the lower ยง 1 standard. None of these cases held that the analysis was identical, nor did they appear to 
consider (or have reason to consider) the differences pertinent to the present litigation. "
795,16," Kolon states that ""[u]pon information and belief, DuPont's market share remains greater than 70% of all sales by purchase 
volume of para-aramid fiber in the United States."" Of course, if Kolon is to amend its claim, it must allege monopoly power in a 
viable geographic market, not simply the United States. "
796,17," If it were, it could probably be shown through DuPont's actions in defending its already large share of the market. See, e.g., 
Aramid Fiber Formed of Poly Para-Phenylene Terephthalamide from the Netherlands, 2001 ITC LEXIS 560, at *37 (Feb. 2001) 
(heavily redacted decision of the International Trade Commission) (rejecting DuPont's argument that the expansion plans of its 
primary competitor for American customers,  [**62] Teijin, would ""cause material injury to the domestic industry"" unless anti-
dumping duties were maintained). It could also be shown by several statements produced in discovery that show an intent to 
prevent Kolon from competing in the United States. "
800,1," To plead a claim for quantum meruit, a plaintiff must allege (1) that the plaintiff performed certain services for the defendant, (2) 
their reasonable value, (3) that they were rendered at the request of the defendant, and (4) that they are unpaid. Haggerty v. 
Warner, 115 Cal. App. 2d 468, 475, 252 P.2d 373 (1953). "

807,2," In its motion, U.S. Bank incorrectly cites Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957) as setting 
forth the standard. The correct standard, however, is set forth in Erickson, 551 U.S. at 93-94, and Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555-56, 
as discussed above. Twombly disapproved the ""no set of facts"" language in Conley. Conley had stated ""the  [*6] accepted rule 
that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no 
set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" 355 U.S. at 45-46. Twombly decided that ""this famous 
observation has earned its retirement. The phrase is best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading 
standard."" 550 U.S. at 563. "
808,3," Based on the allegations in the SAC, one of the primary underlying wrongs that plaintiffs are alleging is based on fraud. Indeed, 
according to plaintiffs, ""by the fraudulent, deceptive, unfair, and other wrongful conduct as herein alleged, said Defendants have 
violated California Business and Professions Code ยง 17200 et seq. by consummating an unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent 
business practice, designed to deprive Plaintiffs of money and/or property."" SAC P 18. "

818,1, The facts in this section are taken from the plaintiff's complaint unless otherwise noted. 
819,2," The parties disagree as to exactly what specifications were approved in the 2004 MOU. The TLC maintains that the approval 
was for a digital top, rather than the static top in use  [**5] by Astra in early 2008. See Certification of Steven Newman in 
Opposition to Defendant the N.Y. TLC's Motion for Summary Judgment (""Newman Cert."") Exh. U. Astra argues that the static 
top in use in 2008 was approved by the 2004 MOU. See id. at Exh. V."
819,3," These contacts include: (1) the initial May 2007 phone call from Peter Schenkman, Assistant Commissioner for Safety and 
Emissions at the TLC, informing Astra that a new MOU would be necessary; (2) an email from Sherryl Eluto, Assistant General 
Counsel at the TLC, including a draft of the proposed MOU on June 22, 2007; (3) the July 5, 2007 letter from Eluto cited by Astra 
in its complaint; (4) a July 9, 2007 letter from Astra citing the receipt of Eluto's email on June 22, 2007 and requesting revisions 
to avoid negative effects on Astra's business; (5) a July 16, 2007 letter from Astra regarding other proposed changes to the 
agreement; and (6) a meeting between Astra's attorney and TLC officials on August 1, 2007. See Newman Cert. PP 22-24; 
Exhs. M, N. "
820,4," As of this date, Clear Channel also had four-sided tops on cabs in the market (these had been acquired from Astra in the early 
stages of its time in the market prior to the break-down of their business relationship), and both Clear Channel and Astra had 
entered into new MOUs with the  [**8] TLC. Eluto Dec P 11; Oral Arg. p. 23. Over the course of negotiations with the TLC during 
the summer of 2007, Clear Channel had agreed to take its four-sided tops off the market by December 31, 2007, Eluto Dec. P 
12, Exh. E, while Astra had been given until August 31, 2008 to remove its four-sided tops, Eluto Dec. P 15, Exh. H. Eluto avers 
that the draft MOU provided to Astra on August 29, 2007 ""was identical to the MOU entered into with Clear Channel, except that 
Astra was given until August 31, 2008 to display existing advertising on four sides of the taxitop"" and that the specific device 
approved was the same device that had been approved for use by Astra on September 16, 2004. Eluto Dec 2 14; see also Eluto 
Dec. Exhs. E, H (copies of the 2007 MOUs entered into between the TLC and Clear Channel and the TLC and Astra)."
820,5," Astra maintains that banning the four-sided tops meant the destruction of its business model, despite the grace period during 
which it could have adjusted its business model, and the fact that it could have at any time used the four-sided model without 
displaying ads on the front and back of the display in compliance with the TLC's requirements and their currently in effect MOU."
820,6," Astra contests this assertion, alleging that the 2004 MOU permitted advertising on the front and back panels. There is no 
explicit discussion of the panels in the 2004 MOU."
820,7," These tops operated through Astra's data network. In early February 2008, Clear Channel asked Astra to remove their tops 
from the network. Id.; Newman Cert. Exh. Q."
820,8," We note that, pursuant to the  [**12] 2007 MOU, the ability to use the four-sided tops had already been revoked, and that it was 
only the grace period that allowed for Astra's use of the tops at the time of this email. "
821,9," Astra maintains that when the TLC claimed that the model in use had never been approved, Astra ""could not complain now that 
its authority was removed, it could not even file an Article 78 proceeding."" Newman Cert. P 35. There is nothing in our view that 
would have prevented an Article 78 proceeding, however, either at that time or upon the eventual denial of a renewed request 
for approval of the four-sided top. As discussed below, to the extent the real issue here is whether the TLC's determination to 
disallow any four-sided top was made according to inappropriate procedures, an Article 78 suit, rather than this antitrust action, 
would have been the more appropriate vehicle."
821,10," The TLC maintains that requiring the new MOU in February 2008 was simply an effort to make Astra's MOU consistent with 
the tops actually in use  [**14] by Astra at that time (the static display models in use, as opposed to the digital display the TLC 
asserts was the only model approved in the original MOU). Oral Arg. p. 42; see also Newman Cert. Exh. X (email from Eluto to 
Astra's attorney requesting a new MOU in order to ""keep the static rooftops up on the taxis""). Astra claims the new MOU was an 
effort to get the four-sided tops off the market immediately and that the TLC was wrongly claiming that the ""Astra October, 2007 
MOU was for the digital TSS unit operated by Clear Channel and not Astra's own AstraLite TSS taxitop."" Newman Cert. P 36. 
This dispute is not ultimately relevant to our analysis of the alleged antitrust violation, but we note that the tops Astra sold to 
Clear Channel were the first tops Astra had in the market immediately following the approval of the device by the 2004 MOU."
821,11," Astra does not allege the amount of Clear Channel's bid or give any indication of how it became aware of the bid, but for the 
purpose of Clear Channel's motion to dismiss, we will assume  [**16] the bid was lower than Astra's bid. We will also assume 
that, as Astra has pleaded, its own bid was ""close to the industry standard of cost for the unit per month."" "
822,12," In its submissions in opposition to the TLC's motion for summary judgment, Astra lists two lawsuits: Clear Channel v. Avenue 
M and Astra Media Group, LLC, filed September 21, 2007 in New York County Supreme Court (Index No. 603150/07) and Clear 
Channel v. Sufi Management and Astra Media Group, LLC, filed on March 25, 2008 in the same court (Index No. 104390-2008). 
Newman Cert. PP 30, 31. First, we note that these allegations are included in plaintiff's response to the TLC'S summary 
judgment  [**17] motion, and are thus not appropriate for consideration in the context of Clear Channel's motion to dismiss. 
Second, even if they were considered, the first was dismissed when Astra ceased media operations on April 30, 2008 and the 
second was settled soon thereafter, according to plaintiff's submission. Id. There are no other allegations regarding lawsuits by 
Clear Channel."
822,13," It its submissions in opposition to the TLC motion for summary judgment, Astra includes a photograph of a taxicab with a four-
sided taxitop device in its trunk and claims that Clear Channel sent pictures ""to Astra customers of Astra's 4-sided AstraLite TSS 
taxitop being taken off the top and thrown in the trunk of taxis while replaced with a Clear Channel taxitop."" Newman Cert. P 20, 
Exh. L. There is only one photograph, however, and no explanation is provided as to how it was acquired or what it depicts. 
While it does display  [**18] a taxicab with an A-frame top carrying a four-sided top in its trunk, there is no information provided 
that would lead us to believe that it had been improperly removed from a taxicab or that it was even a four-sided top owned by 
Astra. Id."
822,14," Astra argues that summary judgment is inappropriate unless Astra is first given the opportunity to conduct discovery. HN2[
] 
It is certainly true that, though discovery is not required prior to a summary judgment motion, the granting of such a motion is 
disfavored where the  [**19] party opposing the motion has not yet had an opportunity for discovery. See, e.g., Trammell v. 
Keane, 338 F.3d 155, 161 fn. 2 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting that ""[o]nly in the rarest of cases may summary judgment be granted 
against a plaintiff who has not been afforded the opportunity to conduct discovery"" (quoting Hellstrom v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans 
Affairs, 201 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir. 2000))). To show that discovery is warranted, a party may submit an affidavit under Fed.R.Civ.P. 
56(f) demonstrating that the non-moving party is in need of discovery ""to be able to present facts needed to defend the motion."" 
Commercial Cleaning Servs., L.L.C. v. Colin Serv. Sys., Inc., 271 F.3d 374, 386 (2d Cir. 2001). Under Rule 56(f), ""a party 
resisting summary judgment on the ground that it needs discovery in order to defeat the motion must submit an affidavit showing 
(1) what facts are sought to resist the motion and how they are to be obtained, (2) how those facts are reasonably expected to 
create a genuine issue of material fact, (3) what effort affiant has made to obtain them, and (4) why the affiant was unsuccessful 
in those efforts."" Miller v. Wolpoff & Abramson, L.L.P., 321 F.3d 292, 303 (2d Cir. 2003)  [**20] (internal citations and quotations 
omitted). ""[A]lthough pre-discovery summary judgment is rare, a Rule 56(f) request should be denied where additional discovery 
will not uncover a genuine issue of material fact."" Oscar De La Renta, Ltd. v. Mulberry Thai Silks, Inc., No 08 Civ. 4341 (RJS), 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 33221 at *13 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (quoting XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. Agoglia, No. 08 Civ. 3821 (GEL), 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36601, 2009 WL 1227485 at *14 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)). As set out below, plaintiff's complaint does not even state a 
claim upon which relief can be granted for either of the claims against the TLC. To the extent that information from the summary "
823,," judgment submissions is cited in this opinion, it is only as a demonstration of the much more plausible argument that the TLC 
acted unilaterally in banning the four-sided tops. Indeed the vast majority of such information cited is taken from plaintiff's 
submission in the form of Mr. Newman's Certification. Plaintiff's 56(f) affidavit has not demonstrated any factual information that 
could now be obtained through discovery that would reasonably lead us to alter the result of defendant's motion. "
824,15," At oral argument counsel indicated that the lawsuits may have been baseless, but offered no clear demonstration that such 
was the case. See Oral Arg. pp. 30-31. "
826,16," At oral argument, when asked why Clear Channel would logically commit these acts, plaintiff's counsel expressed his 
understanding that Clear Channel had taken pictures and shown them to other taxicab owners as a part of a general scheme to 
intimidate Astra's taxi owners. Oral Arg. p. 33-34. While plaintiff  [**31] makes reference to and includes one such picture in its 
opposition papers to the TLC motion for summary judgment, the picture only shows an unspecified taxi top in a trunk. Newman 
Cert. Exh. L. Allegations involving a picture or the showing of a picture to market participants appeared nowhere in plaintiff's 
complaint and there has been no plausible explanation for why the forcible destruction of Astra's tops, which presumably would 
have left holes in the taxis, would have endeared taxi owners to Clear Channel."
826,17," Though not considered in the context of the motion to dismiss, we note that any role such destruction might play in a general 
scheme to intimidate is minimalized in plaintiff's own submission in opposition to the TLC's motion for summary judgment. There, 
Astra cites the alleged removal of the tops then, in the following paragraph, claims that ""[d]espite these efforts to discredit and 
dissuade customers from doing business with Astra, Astra continued to remain sold out for advertising space and continued to 
receive additional investment into the company to manufacture, install 4-sided TSS taxitops on taxis and market space thereon."" 
Newman Cert. P21."
826,18," To the extent this claim could also be brought under the New York Constitution, we note that the provisions are interpreted in 
parallel. Hayut v. State Univ. of N.Y., 352 F.3d 733, 754-755 (2d Cir. 2003) (""' [Article I, section 11 of the New York State 
Constitution] was intended to afford coverage as broad as that provided by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution.'"" (quoting Brown v. State, 89 N.Y.2d 172, 190, 674 N.E.2d 1129, 652 N.Y.S.2d 223 (1996)))). "
827,19," Astra did not name any specific employees in its complaint, but in its opposition papers to TLC's motion for summary 
judgment, Astra states that the comments came from Peter Schenkman and Sherryl Eluto. See Complaint P93; Newman Cert. 
P49."
827,20," We note that the letter written by Astra's President to  [**37] Mayor Bloomberg seeking guidance on this issue was sent in 
September 2008, after Astra had ceased participation in the market. Oral Arg. pp. 45-46."
827,21," We note the differing procedural postures of the defendants in this analysis, given that Clear Channel now brings a motion to 
dismiss, while the TLC maintains a motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we apply the relevant standard of review, 
discussed above, to each of the parties. "
828,22," ""Taxicab rooftop installation, servicing and advertising within the five boroughs of New York City, under the jurisdiction of the 
TLC โฆ"" including ""contracting with owners of taxi cabs for the installation of rooftops on taxicabs, and the contracting with 
advertisers who advertise on the rooftops under the authority of the TLC."" Complaint, P10. "
829,23," The TLC maintains that it never intended to approve a  [**43] four-sided top. Eluto Dec. P16. The TLC further maintains that 
the top Astra is currently approved for is not the top they were approved for prior to the signing of the 2008 MOU. See Oral Arg. 
at X; see also Newman Cert. Exh. U; Eluto Dec P17; Oral Arg. at 42. Astra contests both of these assertions."
829,24," According to Astra's submissions, Clear Channel pulled its four-sided tops out of the market in February 2008, after it agreed 
to sign a new MOU with the TLC in the summer of 2007. Newman Cert. P32, Exh. Q"
829,25," The TLC has no economic incentive to lower (or increase) the number of taxitop rooftop providers, but rather collects the same 
fee from all taxicab owners regardless of who provides the rooftop device. Eluto Dec. P5."
829,26," See Bustop Shelters, Inc. v. Convenience & Safety Corp., 521 F.Supp. 989, fn. 10 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) (recognizing the maxim 
that ""(t)he antitrust laws were never meant to be a panacea for all wrongs"" (citing Parmelee Transportation Co. v. Keeshin, 292 
F.2d 794, 804 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 944, 82 S. Ct. 376, 7 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1961))."
829,27," Further, the communications are arguably protected by the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. Though it is an open  [**45] question 
as to whether the doctrine applies to Donnelly Act claims, defendants argue that based on the First Amendment underpinnings 
of the doctrine and because the Donnelly Act is generally interpreted in parallel with the Sherman Act, see Yankees 
Entertainment and Sports Network, 224 F.Supp.2d 657, 678-79 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), Noerr-Pennington should be interpreted as 
applying to Donnelly Act claims. Though we see the merit in defendants' arguments, we do not reach this issue here because it 
is sufficiently clear that plaintiff fails to plead a reciprocal relationship between the defendants. "
830,28," While the 2004 MOU did not contain a termination clause, Section 3.1 of the 2007 MOU states: ""The Chairperson may 
terminate this Agreement prior to the expiration date of this Agreement if the Chairperson determines, in accordance with and 
subject to the procedures set forth in this subsection, that this Agreement has not been substantially complied with . . . Astra 
shall have twenty-one (21) business days to cure any defect or to respond to any concerns set forth in the notice unless 
otherwise extended by the TLC at the request of Astra. Should Astra fail to cure any defect or fail to respond to any concerns set 
forth in the Chairperson's notice to the satisfaction of the Chairperson within the time period allotted by the TLC, the Chairperson 
may promptly terminate this Agreement."" Eluto Dec. Exh. H. Clear Channel argues that based on the lack of any language in the 
2004 MOU stating that the contract was not terminable at will (and the lack of any suggestion by Astra that the 2004 MOU was 
breached), and the express termination clause in the 2007 MOU, there are no grounds for a breach of contract claim. 
 [**49] Defendant Clear Channel Taxi Media, LLC's Memorandum of Law in Support of its Motion to Dismiss the Complaint for 
Failure to State a Claim at 20. "
831,29," In this section of the complaint, Astra does refer to the price as being below Clear Channel's actual cost. However, the lack of 
any pleading as to what the bid or costs actually were makes this statement conclusory. "
842,1," When referring collectively to the group of original defendants in both MDLs, I will use the generic ""defendants."""
842,2," On February 13, 2009, I granted the class plaintiffs' motion for class certification. In re Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer 
(EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 256 F.R.D. 82 (D. Conn. 2009)."
842,3," The CR antitrust litigation involved antitrust conspiracy allegations relating to the markets of three different synthetic rubbers: 
EPDM, CR, and acrylonitrile-butadiene (""NBR""). The antitrust claims against the DSM defendants in the CR antitrust litigation 
relate solely to the EPDM market and are identical to the class plaintiffs' claims against the DSM defendants. The DSM 
defendants moved for summary judgment and to strike in both antitrust litigations, raising the same arguments and objections to 
the same evidence. Accordingly, this ruling is applicable to the claims in both multidistrict antitrust litigations."
842,4," The facts presented here are drawn from the parties' Local Rule 56(a)1 and Local Rule 56(a)2 Statements filed in conjunction 
with the memoranda in support of and in opposition to the motions for summary judgment. Unless otherwise noted, the facts are 
undisputed. "
843,5," Criminal charges, however, were brought against the named defendants -- with the exception of the DSM defendants -- for 
price-fixing in the CR and NBR industries. Those corporations pled guilty to criminal charges in the United States and/or 
Canada, paying large fines for their role in price-fixing conspiracies in those other synthetic rubber markets. "
844,6," A fifth Crompton executive, Bernard Schmitt, actually testified at his deposition, but had failed recollections concerning most of 
the key events. See PD 11, Schmitt Dep."
844,7," The validity of the executives' assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege has not been challenged in this case, even though 
any testimony at trial would likely occur after the relevant statutes of limitations had expired. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. ยง 3282(a) 
(imposing five-year statute of limitations for criminal prosecutions from date of offense). I therefore assume that the EPDM 
executives properly invoked the privilege against self-incrimination at their depositions. At trial, however, the Court will have to ""determine, in view of the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, 
whether the incriminating nature of the [witnesses'] answer[s are] evident."" United States v. Edgerton, 734 F.2d 913, 919 (2d Cir. 
1984). The applicable statute of limitations  [**14] for criminal prosecutions is a potentially decisive consideration for evaluating 
whether witnesses' statements are privileged under the Fifth Amendment. Compare In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust 
Litig., 293 F. Supp. 2d 854, 859-61 (C.D. Ill. 2003) (holding that witnesses could not invoke Fifth Amendment privilege because 
prosecution of witnesses for antitrust violations was ""clearly barred by the statute of limitations""), with ACLI Int'l Commodity 
Servs., Inc. v. Banque Populaire Suisse, 110 F.R.D. 278, 282-83 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (holding that statements were privileged 
because ""it cannot be concluded with certainty that all relevant statute of limitations have run""). "
852,8," Those notes are the subject of another evidentiary challenge by the DSM defendants. As discussed more fully in that section of 
my ruling, I decline to exclude those notes on the ground of irrelevance."
852,9," The DSM defendants call this the ""July 12, 2000 email,"" but the plaintiffs state the email refers to a December 7, 2000 meeting 
in Germany. The email is dated ""07/12/2000."" PX 233. Because it is the European style to put the day before the month, and 
considering the nature of its subject matter, it is more likely that this email was actually sent on December 7, 2000. "
859,10," They further note that lockstep pricing also occurred outside the alleged class period (i.e., beginning with the August 1997 
price increase). The latter point is a red herring, however, because the plaintiffs are not alleging that the conspiracy began in 
1997 and no earlier. Instead, they are seeking damages from 1997 through the end of 2001, but maintain that there was a 
conspiracy in place even before the class period. "
860,11," A more detailed discussion of the EPDM's industry characteristics is set forth in my ruling on the plaintiffs' motion for class 
certification. In re Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 256 F.R.D. 82, 91-95 (D. Conn. 2009). "
883,1," We note that Vident v. Dentsply International, Inc., No. 06-1141, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110399, 2008 WL 4384124 (C.D.Cal. 
Aug. 29, 2008), a case cited by the plaintiffs, does not commend a different result here. In Vident the court found that Dentsply 
was precluded from contesting 24 issues, but the district court's opinion does not state what those issues were. Moreover, we 
note that Vident may have occupied a different, and more prominent, place in the relevant market, a factor which would affect 
the impact of anti-competitive practices in ways that would alter the application of issue preclusion rules to that case. 
Furthermore, the Vident opinion does not discuss, analyze or address the limitations on offensive non-mutual issue preclusion 
which have been recognized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. v. 
L'Oreal USA, Inc., 458 F.3d 244, 248-9 (3d. Cir. 2006).  [**59] Finally, the Vident opinion simply reflects one exercise of the 
court's discretionary authority to apply this doctrine offensively. See Parklane Hosiery, supra. Our recommendations, in turn, 
reflect our views regarding the best-informed exercise of this discretion on the particular facts of this case "
884,2," In its proposed finding, Univac characterized this business as a ""cash cow"". Because this evocative term may have an 
unintended, and prejudicial, effect before a jury, we have rephrased this finding to avoid any undue prejudice. See F.R. Evid. 
403. "
885,3," The plaintiffs originally proposed a Finding 11 which stated in part as follows: ""Beginning in at least 1988, Dentsply had in place 
a policy precluding its dealers from carrying competitive lines of teeth, and it enforced this policy with respect to Frink Dental in 
1988 and Zahn Dental that same year."" Dentsply objected to this specific statement, (Doc. 70., page 9) and Univac 
acknowledges that this finding may be overly broad (Doc. 74, page 13, n.2.) Therefore, it is recommended that this proposed 
finding not be included among those to be conclusively determined by the Court. "
886,4," Univac initially proposed a Finding 25 which was largely repetitive of an earlier finding, Finding 6, but suggested a causal 
relationship between Dentsply's activities and harm to the plaintiffs, stating as follows: The inability of Dentsply's competitors to 
obtain a larger share of the market was attributable more to Dentsply's ""blocking of access to the key dealers""  [**67] through 
effective exclusionary policies than to its competitors' own business decisions. Id. at 189. ""The apparent lack of aggressiveness 
by [Dentsply's] competitors is not a matter of apathy, but a reflection of the effectiveness of Dentsply's exclusionary policy."" Id. 
Because the finding's references of harms suffered by Dentsply's competitors, following immediately after a finding identifying 
Universal as a competitor, are redundant, could create confusion regarding issue preclusion, and might suggest a causal link 
between Dentsply's actions and a specific tangible harm, to the plaintiffs it is recommended that this finding not be adopted."
886,5," The original finding proposed by Univac in this respect suggested a causal relationship between Dentsply's activities and harm 
to the plaintiffs, stating as follows: ""Because of Dealer Criterion 6, DLDS dropped Universal's teeth when Dentsply threatened to 
stop supplying its product. Id. at 194."" Consistent with our Report and Recommendation we have deleted this passage from this 
specific finding and recommend that this particular matter be left to litigation at trial. Univac also tender another proposed finding, 
Number 28, which similarly suggested  [**68] a causal relationship between Dentsply's activities and harm to the plaintiffs stating 
that: ""Dentsply maintained its monopoly anti-competitively through Dealer Criterion 6 and exercised its monopoly power to 
prevent competitors, including Universal, from competing effectively. Id. at 191-96."" Consistent with our Report and 
Recommendation we have deleted this passage from this specific finding and recommend that this particular matter be left to 
litigation at trial."
886,6," Univac's initial proposed Finding 29 also stated that: ""Dentsply's alleged justification was pretextual and did not excuse its 
exclusionary practices"" and contained a further detailed description of the policy. In light of the other findings recommended 
here, this finding seems redundant, and its use of the term pretextual could cause confusion and prejudice. Therefore, it is 
recommended that this finding not be adopted as proposed by Univac. "
892,*," The Honorable Susan R. Bolton, United States District Judge for the District of Arizona, sitting by designation. "
894,1," Omega and Tampa involved alleged violations of Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 14, which also prohibits exclusive 
 [**10] dealing arrangements. Our circuit has held thatHN4[
]  ""a greater showing of anticompetitive effect is required to 
establish a Sherman Act violation than a section three Clayton Act violation in exclusive-dealing cases."" Twin City, 676 F.2d at 
1304 n. 9. Accordingly, although a Clayton Act violation may be found where an agreement has the probable effect of 
foreclosing competition, Omega, 127 F.3d at 1162, in a case under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the plaintiff must prove that 
the exclusive dealing arrangement actually foreclosed competition, McGlinchy v. Shell Chemical Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 (9th Cir. 
1988) (""To establish a section 1 violation under the Sherman Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate . . . [that the agreement] actually 
causes injury to competition.""). "
895,2," In a previous antitrust suit against Tyco, we affirmed the same district court's holding that the trial evidence supported the jury's 
finding that Tyco's market-share discount and sole-source agreements violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Masimo 
Corp. v. Tyco Health Care Group, No. 07-55960, 2009 WL 3451725, 350 Fed. Appx. 95, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 23765 (9th Cir. 
Oct. 28, 2009). As the district court correctly ruled, Masimo is distinguishable from this case. The R-Cal patent was still in effect 
during the time period at issue in Masimo, so owners of Tyco's R-Cal monitors had no choice but to purchase Tyco's sensors for 
use with those monitors. Furthermore, the sole-source agreements in that case contractually obligated GPO members  [**14] to 
purchase a set percentage of their pulse oximetry requirements from Tyco. "

Rule 78-230(h). "
926,2, The factual assertions in this section are based on the allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint unless otherwise specified. 
935,1," Defendants filed a series of motions to dismiss and motions regarding threshold legal issues, which the superior court deemed 
as general demurrers and motions for judgment on the pleadings. The court sustained the demurrers and granted the motions 
without leave to amend."

936,3," Plaintiff alleges that the class consists of ""all current and former auto body repair shops who were not paid their actual repair 
rate by Defendants during the period of four years before the date of the filing of this action . . . ."" "
938,4," ""An 'auto body repair labor rate survey' is any gathering of information from auto body repair shops regarding what auto body 
repair labor rate the repair shops charge to determine and set a specified prevailing auto body repair rate in a specific 
geographic area."" (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, ยง 2698.91, subd. (a).)"
938,5," "" 'Prevailing auto body rate' means the rate determined and set by an insurer as a result of conducting an auto body labor rate 
survey of auto body repair shops in a particular geographic area and used by the insurer as a basis for determining the cost to 
settle automobile collision, physical damage, and liability claims for auto body repairs."" (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 10, ยง 2698.91, 
subd. (b).)"
938,6," ""Any labor rate  [*13] survey results reported to the Department of Insurance pursuant to Insurance Code section 758 shall 
including the following: [P] (1) The name of each auto body repair shop surveyed in the labor rate survey; [P] (2) The address of 
each auto body repair shop surveyed in the labor rate survey; [P] (3) The total number of shops surveyed in the labor rate 
survey; [P] (4) The prevailing rate established by the insurer for each geographic area surveyed; [P] (5) A description of the 
specific geographic area covered by the prevailing labor rate reported; [P] (6) A description of the formula or method the insurer 
used to calculate or determine the specific prevailing auto body rate reported for each specific geographic area."" (Cal. Code

940,7," In his complaint, plaintiff merely alleges that defendants ""and each of them"" violated the Cartwright Act. On appeal plaintiff 
contends that defendants entered into a conspiracy with the DRPs. For reasons we shall explain, assuming plaintiff was given 
leave to amend his complaint to allege that the DRPs were part of the conspiracy, the complaint would still not state a cause of 
action for violation of the Cartwright Act. "
946,1," Indeed, Doe suggests that had the plaintiffs been able to amend their complaint to include  [*9] allegations of a refusal to deal 
and below-cost pricing, the outcome may have been different. See Doe, 571 F.3d at 935 n.4. "
947,2," The court stated: Does nevertheless submit that they should be allowed to proceed because we previously embraced the principle of a free-
standing monopoly leveraging claim in Image Technical Services, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co. However, Image Technical 
involved a refusal to deal. Read in that context and in light of Linkline, Image Technical does not save Does' claim."
947,571," F.3d at 935 (citation omitted). Thus, although the court rejected the plaintiffs' monopoly leveraging theory, it did not overrule 
Image Technical. It distinguished Image Technical because that case involved allegations of a refusal to deal. "
948,3," Abbott maintains that DSL service, which was at issue in Linkline, was presented  [*14] as a bundled product. Although the 
Court disagrees with Abbott's characterization, it need not decide this point. Even if a bundled product was involved, Linkline is 
nonetheless distinguishable because the defendant did not have a duty to deal. 129 S. Ct. at 1119. Here, Plaintiffs have alleged 
such a duty. "
952,*, The Clerk of the Court is directed to amend the official caption as set forth above. 
956,1," HN1[
] The Supreme Court's most recent iteration of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 8(a) pleading standard stresses that ""the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal 
conclusions. . . . [Therefore,]  [**3] a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, 
because they are no more than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 
S.Ct. 1937, 1949-50, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (May 18, 2009). We accept that invitation here, and do not include those allegations in 
the SCAC that ""are no more than conclusions."" "
957,2," The allegation that defendants agreed to this price floor is obviously conclusory, and is  [**8] not accepted as true. "
960,3," Because the proposed amendment to paragraph ninety-nine of the SCAC contained, along with the remainder of the complaint, 
""enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 
556, the district court erred in denying the motion to amend on the ground of futility. See Kassner v. 2nd Ave. Delicatessen Inc., 
496 F.3d 229, 244 (2d Cir. 2007). Therefore, we include the allegations contained in proposed paragraph ninety-nine within our 
discussion of the SCAC as a whole. In so doing, we reject defendants' argument that the proposed amendment would have 
been futile because it alleged  [**20] that prices rose in or about May 2005, but costs declined four years earlier, in 2001. As can 
be seen above, paragraph seventy-one of the original complaint alleged that initial costs of distributing Internet Music fell 
because the price of distributing CDs accounted for costs such as copying the compact discs, producing the CD case, and labor, 
all of which were eliminated in distributing Internet Music. In contrast, the proposed amendment to paragraph ninety-nine alleged 
that by May 2005 the costs of distributing Internet Music had fallen because the digitization costs of the initial Internet cataloging 
had been completed and technological improvements (including increased computer processing power) had reduced the 
remaining costs of digitizing new releases. These are not the same costs that are alleged to have decreased in paragraph 
seventy-one of the original complaint. "
962,4," A short explanation of per se illegality versus the rule of reason is in order. Per se liability is reserved ""for only those 
agreements that are so plainly anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality."" 
Dagher, 547 U.S. at 5 (internal quotation marks omitted). Price-fixing agreements between competitors are generally per se 
unlawful, meaning they are prohibited despite the reasonableness of the particular prices agreed upon. Id; see also 7 Areeda & 
Hovenkamp ยง 1509a (2d ed. 2003). In contrast, under the rule of reason analysis, which presumptively applies to Section 1 
claims, ""antitrust plaintiffs must demonstrate that a particular contract or combination is in fact unreasonable  [**29] and 
anticompetitive before it will be found unlawful."" Daghher, 547 U.S. at 5. "
963,5," We note that some commentators continue to believe that Dagher does not foreclose the application of the per se rule against 
price-fixing  [**31] in the case of a lawful joint venture where the price fixing itself is not related to the purpose of the joint venture 
or the joint venture does not result in significant economic benefits. See Areeda & Hovenkamp 2009 Supplement ยง 2132 
(arguing that if General Motors and Toyota were to form a joint venture for the production of hybrid car engines, but then place 
the engines in cars they designed and produced separately, the Supreme Court would not permit them to fix the prices of the 
finished cars as part of the lawful joint venture); see also 12 Areeda & Hovemkamp ยง 2004a (2d ed. 2005) (noting that the per se 
rule against price fixing ""applies virtually without exception when the price fix is 'naked' in the sense that it does not accompany 
any significant integration of research and development, production or distribution. . . . As a general matter, price fixing is 
tolerated only in the case of the joint venture producing significant, output-increasing efficiencies, and where the price fixing itself 
can be shown to be essential to these social gains.""); 11 Areeda & Hovenkamp ยง 1912c (2d ed. 2005) (explaining that the rule of 
reason is applied to a joint venture's horizontal restraint  [**32] when the joint venture seems to be productive or reasonable on 
its face and the particular challenged agreement seems to be reasonably necessary to the purpose of the venture). In this case, 
the SCAC obviously does not allege that MusicNet or pressplay were economically efficient in integrating research, 
development, production, or distribution or that price fixing was reasonably necessary to any social gain the ventures may have 
produced."
963,6," On appeal, three parent-company defendants, Bertelsmann, Inc., Sony Corporation of America, and Time Warner Inc., argue 
that even if the SCAC states a claim under Twombly, it fails to state a claim against them because plaintiffs allege no basis for 
piercing the corporate veil. Because the district court did not reach this question and the parties devote three total pages to it in 
their briefs, we remand to allow the district court to consider it in the first instance. "
964,1," The basis for perplexity is not lessened by the Court's subsequent statement that ""[i]t makes sense to say, therefore, that an 
allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, apparently meaning 
will not suffice to defeat a motion to dismiss a complaint. "
967,1," Because oral argument will not be of material assistance, the Court orders this matter submitted on the briefs. E.D. Cal. Local 
Rule 78-230(h)."
967,2, The factual assertions in this section are based on the allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint unless otherwise specified. 
983,1," In its reply brief Dentsply argues that the rebate and exchange issues considered  [**28] in this litigation differed from those 
which Univac proposes to present in the instant case. To the extent that these issues may not be identical, this fact does not 
change our view that Univac should be entitled to prove what it alleged in its complaint, and that Dentsply may not assert the 
statute of limitations as an evidentiary bar to this particular proof. Of course, Univac still must prove acts and injuries within the 
applicable limitations period. "

1006,4," In Zimmerman v. HBO Affiliate  [**9] Group, the court stated that ""to be a class representative on a particular claim, the plaintiff 
himself must have a cause of action on that claim."" 834 F.2d 1163, 1169 (3d Cir. 1987). Named plaintiffs may generally 
represent other plaintiffs with common but not identical claims; however, courts are split on whether at least one named plaintiff 
must have suffered injury in each state whose laws it attempts to invoke. Compare Griffin v. Dugger, 823 F.2d 1476, 1483 (11th 
Cir. 1987) (""[A] claim cannot be asserted on behalf of a class unless at least one named plaintiff has suffered the injury that 
gives rise to that claim""), In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 160 F. Supp. 2d 1365, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2001) (following 
Dugger and dismissing claims arising under laws of states in which no named plaintiffs suffered an injury), and In re Wellbutrin 
XL Antitrust Litig., 260 F.R.D. 143, 152, 156-57 (E.D. Pa. 2009) (stating that ""standing is analyzed on a claim by claim basis"" and 
dismissing claims in states where named plaintiffs suffered no injury), with In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 221 F.R.D. 260, 268-69 
(D. Mass. 2004) (deferring the standing determination with respect to states  [**10] where no named plaintiffs suffered injury, 
disagreeing with In re Terazosin and favoring a more ""nuanced approach"" to standing in class actions); and Mowbray v. Waste 
Mgmt. Holdings, Inc.., 189 F.R.D. 194, 202 (D. Mass. 1999) (holding that a single named plaintiff with a contract claim arising 
under Illinois law could represent class members with similar claims arising under laws of many other states). Because I hold 
that at least one named plaintiff has standing in each state where a claim is stated, the issue of whether plaintiffs may bring 
claims under laws of states where no named plaintiff suffered an injury is not relevant in this case. "
1008,5, Defendant does not attack plaintiffs' monopolization claims under Arizona and Iowa law.

(2009). If the Plaintiffs had alleged facts to show that the petitions GSK filed made statements that GSK knew were contradicted 
by data and information, and that GSK knowingly excluded such information, this might be sufficient to allege a 
misrepresentation."
1010,9," While this is to some extent an argument that Plaintiffs lack standing, it is separate from the issue of constitutional standing 
already addressed in part A of the Discussion, ""Standing under 12(b)(1)."" "
1012,10," ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to

1013,11," The relevant section  [**32] states: HN22[

suffered, shall be mailed or delivered to any prospective respondent."" "
1014,12," Restatement of Restitution ยง 1 states: ""A person who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to 
make restitution to the other."" Comment a states: ""A person is enriched if he has received a benefit. . . A person is unjustly 
enriched if the retention of the benefit would be unjust."" "
1015,13," Restitution based upon unjust enrichment takes at least two forms: ""parasitic"" and ""autonomous."" Where the unjust enrichment 
is based upon a predicate wrong, such as a tort, breach of contract or other wrongful conduct such as an antitrust violation, the 
restitution is known as ""parasitic."" Conversely, unjust enrichment may provide an independent ground for restitution, and this is 
known as ""autonomous"" restitution. See In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litig., 350 F. Supp. 2d 160, 208-09 
(D. Me. 2004); Doug Rendleman, When is Enrichment Unjust? Restitution Visits an Onyx Bathroom, 36 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 991, 
993 (2003).  [**40] Plaintiffs do not differentiate which form of restitution they rely on, but presumably in at least some states 
they would wish to rely on the notion of autonomous restitution. The premise of this type of claim is that even where a 
defendant's ""conduct is blameless under the substantive requirements of federal and state antitrust statutes and state consumer 
protection statutes, the plaintiffs nevertheless can still obtain restitution."" In re New Motor Vehicles, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 209. 
However, allowing such restitution would undermine state legislative policies and an entire body of substantive law. C.f. 
Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 171 F.3d 912, 937 (3d Cir. 1999) (""We can find no 
justification for permitting plaintiffs to proceed on their unjust enrichment claim once we have determined that the District Court 
properly dismissed the traditional tort claims.""). I therefore decline to allow autonomous restitution where recovery under state 
antitrust and consumer protection statutes is specifically prohibited. "
1016,14," In other words, if it is determined at a later stage that Plaintiffs do not have a viable statutory claim under Arizona law, they 
could potentially recover under unjust enrichment. "

1030,2," There is no dispute that both Ross and Wachsmuth incurred foreign currency conversion fees on at least one of their credit 
cards issued by an MDL Defendant Bank during the class period and prior to the commencement of this lawsuit. "
1032,3," Plaintiffs have also offered the reports of Dr. Bradley N. Reiff, and Mike McCormack in support of this renewed motion for class 
certification. "
1035,4, Plaintiffs seek certification of a class pursuant only to Rule 23(b)(3). 
1040,5," For purposes of this part of this memorandum and order, this Court assumes that the Defendants could assert the LiPuma 
Release in this action. "
1042,6," There is no dispute that the LiPuma Release is governed by New York law. See Amex I, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21084, 2005 
WL 2364969, at *11 n.5. "
1055,1," Even if we were willing to look to Hemi's intent, as the dissent suggests we should, the City would fare no better.  Hemi's aim 
was not to defraud the City (or the State, for that matter) of tax revenue, but to sell more cigarettes.  Hemi itself neither owed 
taxes nor was obliged to collect and remit them.  This all suggests that Hemi's alleged fraud was aimed at Hemi's competitors, 
not the City.  But Anza teaches that the competitors' injuries  [****22] in such a case are too attenuated to state a RICO claim. "
1056,2," The dissent recognizes that its position poses the troubling specter of turning RICO into a tax collection statute.  Post, at ____ - 
____, 175 L. Ed. 2d, at 963-964 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The dissent's answer looks largely to prosecution policy set forth in the 
Federal Department of Justice Guidelines, which are, of course, not only changeable, but have no applicability whatever to state 
or local governments.  Under the decision below and the dissent's position, RICO could be used as a tax collection device based 
solely on the failure to file reports under the Jenkins Act, which itself provides quite limited remedies.  See 15 U.S.C. ยง 377 
(providing that a violation of the Jenkins Act may be punished as a misdemeanor with a fine up to $1,000 and imprisonment for 
no more than six months).   [****27] And that device would be available not only to the State, to which the reports were due, but 
also to the City, to which Hemi owed no duty under the Act and to which it owed no taxes. "
1075,1," The first two motions listed have been filed on behalf of all named defendants except Lyondell Chemical Company; that 
defendant has filed for bankruptcy, and all proceedings involving claims against it are therefore stayed. "
1076,2," The Court also dismissed certain plaintiffs' claims under Indiana, Tennessee, and Wisconsin antitrust law, and dismissed any 
claims asserted by plaintiffs on behalf of unnamed affiliates. See Urethane III, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103860, 2009 WL 
3337247, at *13-17. In their second amended complaints, plaintiffs have not asserted any claims under state law. "
1077,3," The Court denied plaintiffs' motion to extend the time for filing their second amended complaints until after they could finish 
certain discovery. See Order of Sept. 11, 2009 (Doc. # 1105). "
1079,4," Plaintiffs in the present case have been unable to identify any reported case in which a court in the United States exercised 
jurisdiction over antitrust claims asserted under European law. "
1080,5," As noted above, the Court does not base its dismissal of the European law claims on this doctrine, but rather notes the 
doctrine's applicability as a factor supporting the Court's decision to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under section 
1367(c)."
1080,6," In this section of the Memorandum and Order, the Court may refer to the individual movants generically as ""defendants""."
1080,7," In opposing this motion, plaintiffs have stated that they do not argue that, for limitations purposes, the March 2009 amendments 
adding these defendants ""relate back"" to the date of the filing of the original direct action complaints in October 2008 under Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 15(c). "
1081,8," Defendants do not dispute plaintiffs' assertion of the general rule that, in the event of fraudulent concealment, the statute of 
limitations runs when the violation is or should have been discovered, and that a plaintiff then has the full four years in which to 
file, even if the discovery occurred within the original four-year limitations period as if applied without tolling. See Norton-
Children's Hospitals, Inc. v. James E. Smith & Sons, Inc., 658 F.2d 440, 443-45 (6th Cir. 1981) (overwhelming weight of 
authority supports this rule). Thus, if plaintiffs were correct that different limitations periods could apply to the individuals and to 
the  [**45] other members of the alleged conspiracy, then the four-year period for the individuals would start from the discovery 
of a claim against them (allegedly occurring in 2007), even if that discovery took place within four years of the running of the 
statute with respect to the other members of the conspiracy (allegedly running from 2004)."
1081,9," The Court does not find any of the ""relation back"" cases cited by defendants to be helpful, as those cases turned on an 
interpretation of Rule 15(c). As explained above, plaintiffs do not rely on the relation back doctrine in this case. "
1082,10," See, e.g., In re Bridgestone / Firestone, Inc., 200 F. Supp. 2d 983, 992 (S.D. Ind. 2002) (Arizona law); Travis v. 
Knappenberger, 204 F.R.D. 652, 655-56 (D. Or. 2001) (Oregon law); Espada v. Lugo, 312 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2002) (Puerto 
Rico law); Whittlesey v. Cole, 142 F.3d 340, 343 (6th Cir. 1998) (Tennessee law); Hammack v. DeLonghi, S.p.A., 914 F. Supp. 
303, 305 (E.D. Wis. 1996) (Wisconsin law)."
1082,11," See, e.g., In re Bridgestone / Firestone, Inc., 200 F. Supp. 2d at 988 (California law);  [**49] Yarchak v. Trek Bicycle Corp., 
208 F. Supp. 2d 470, 488-92 (D.N.J. 1995) (New Jersey law); Yacub v. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., 101 F. Supp. 2d 852, 
865 (S.D. Ohio 1998) (Ohio law); In re Mushroom Transp. Co., Inc., 247 B.R. 395, 400 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (Pennsylvania law); Little 
v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 243 F. Supp. 2d 480, 486 (D.S.C. 2001). "
1083,12," Plaintiffs insist that they had no means to discover the identities of the individuals in light of the sealed class action 
proceedings. Nothing prevented plaintiffs from filing their direct actions early enough within the four-year period, however, 
 [**55] to allow for discovery before the expiration of that period. Moreover, plaintiffs cannot claim that the application of this rule 
is especially harsh in this case in light of the fact that plaintiffs actually did discover the identity of the individual defendants within 
the four years after they allegedly discovered the claims against the other defendants. "
1086,13," In a footnote, defendants state that, ""[t]o preserve the issues,"" they also move at this time to dismiss the 1999-2001 claims as 
deficient under Twombly, although they ""respect that the Court has already ruled on these contentions."" The Court denies this 
pro forma motion for dismissal of the 1999-2001 claims for the same reasons set forth in its prior opinion. "
1088,14," Plaintiffs' second amended complaints again allege defendants' denial of a conspiracy during the class action litigation as an 
act of fraudulent concealment, and defendants have not specifically challenged that allegation in their renewed motion to 
dismiss. "
1089,15," Defendants have argued that plaintiffs may not toll the statute of limitations solely based on their allegation that defendants' 
conspiracy was self-concealing. Because the Court has rejected defendants' challenges to the affirmative acts  [**77] of 
fraudulent concealment alleged by plaintiffs, it need not address the viability of the self-concealing standard under Tenth Circuit 
law at this stage. See Urethane III, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103860, 2009 WL 3337247, at *10 n.7 (declining to decide whether 
the Tenth Circuit would adopt the self-concealing standard in light of plaintiffs' satisfaction of the intermediate ""affirmative acts"" 
standard). "
1092,1," Defendants' Motion to Dismiss as well as Plaintiffs' submissions addressed both the Investor and Issuer Complaints. This order 
shall likewise address both pending matters. "
1093,2," The following facts are taken from the allegations in Plaintiffs' Complaints and are assumed to be true for the purposes of this 
decision only. "

1100,1," All facts were considered in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the non-moving party."
1100,2," In 2007, after the citizen petitions in this case were filed, Congress passed a law that allows the FDA to dismiss citizen petitions 
summarily in order to prevent pharmaceutical companies from using this process to unlawfully extend their monopolies. See 21 
U.S.C. ยง 355(q). "
1102,3," Even if I adopted a requirement that a plaintiff must make some allegations regarding the probability of FDA approval, alleging 
an anticipation or belief that FDA approval was probable would be sufficient to satisfy this standard. In reality, there is little 
substantive difference between a plaintiff generic manufacturer alleging in a complaint that FDA approval was probable versus 
alleging that it anticipated that FDA approval was probable. Further, a claimant can sufficiently show intention and preparedness 
to enter a market with an allegation that is framed subjectively, assuming such a belief is accompanied by other factual 
allegations which in fact show intent and preparedness."
1102,4, Allegations are read in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff. 
1112,1," On December 21, 2009, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed Defendants Bill Laney and Breakthrough Marketing, Inc. from this 
action. [Doc. No. 57]. "
1114,2," HN4[
] The term ""material disclosures"" means ""the information that must be provided to satisfy the requirements in ยง 226.6 with regard to the method of determining the finance charge and the balance upon which a finance charge will be imposed, the 
annual percentage rate, the  [*9] amount or method of determining the amount of any membership or participation fee that may 
be imposed as part of the plan, and the payment information described in ยง 226.5b(d)(5)(i) and (ii) that is required under ยง 
226.6(e)(2)."" 12 C.F.R. ยง 226.15(a)(3) n.36."
1114,3," At the hearing, Plaintiffs also alleged they were not provided with the notice of the right to rescind in duplicate as required by 12 
C.F.R. ยง 226.23(b)(1). However, the Court can only consider what has been submitted in the parties' pleadings and exhibits 
attached thereto. Nevertheless, in light of the fact that the Court is dismissing some of the other causes of action with leave to 
amend, Plaintiffs may also have LEAVE TO AMEND this cause of action to make it more specific."
1114,4," Clarion also argues Plaintiffs improperly base their allegations of inaccurate disclosures on the Federal Truth-in-Lending 
Disclosure Statement attached to their FAC, dated September 6, 2006 (hereinafter, ""TILA Disclosure 9-6-06""). (See FAC. Ex. A.) 
According to Clarion, by the time the loan was closed, Plaintiffs were provided with and signed a different Federal Truth-in-
Lending Disclosure Statement, this one dated October 31, 2006 (hereinafter, ""TILA Disclosure  [*11] 10-31-06""). (See Clarion's 
Reply, RJN, Ex. B.) While Clarion correctly argues that the TILA Disclosure 10-31-06 would have superseded the TILA 
Disclosure 9-6-06, the Court has to accept as true Plaintiffs' allegations at this stage of the proceedings. Taking those allegations 
as true, it appears Plaintiffs were provided with two contradictory disclosure statements within months of each other. At this 
stage of the proceedings, it is premature to determine when and/or how those two contradictory disclosure statements were 
provided. Moreover, even if only the second disclosure statement is controlling, Plaintiffs have still alleged sufficient facts to 
show that the disclosures in there were inaccurate and/or misleading. "
1117,5," Section 3301 of the California Commercial Code provides in full: ""Person entitled to enforce"" an instrument means (a) the holder of the instrument, (b) a nonholder in possession of the 
instrument who has the rights of a holder, or (c) a person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled to enforce the 
instrument pursuant to Section 3309 or subdivision (d) of Section 3418. A person may be a person entitled to enforce the 
instrument even though the person is not the owner of the instrument or is in wrongful possession of the instrument. "
1118,6," The Court is not persuaded by Plaintiffs' argument that an assignment of the deed of trust does not become effective until it is 
recorded. Rather, HN13[
] Section 2936 of the Civil Code provides that: ""The assignment of a debt secured by mortgage carries with it the security."" Hence, when Clarion assigned the note to IndyMac in November 2006, at the earliest--or December 
18, 2008, at the latest--the security automatically followed the note. Recordation of the assignment was necessary only to give 
 [*24] constructive notice to third parties. See Cal. Civ. Code ยง 2934; accord Burkett v. Doty, 176 Cal. 89, 93-94, 167 P. 518 
(1917) (holding that an assignment of the mortgage was complete without placing it on the record); Adler v. Sargent, 109 Cal. 
42, 48-49, 41 P. 799 (1895) (upholding a prior assignment of a mortgage, even though it was not timely recorded). Finally, 
Plaintiffs cannot claim any prejudice due to untimely recordation because they concede that they became aware of the 
assignment by January 1, 2007. (See FAC PP 34, 125.) "
1119,7," For example, Plaintiffs' letter of June 19, 2009, states that they ""dispute"" the amount alleged due and owing, and requests 
Defendants to provide information on, among others: (1) the monthly principal and interest payments before and after May 2, 
2009; (2) the total unpaid principal, interest, and escrow balances due and owing as of May 2, 2009; (3) breakdown of the 
payments received and how they were applied; (4) the ""amount, payment date, purpose, and recipient of all foreclosure 
expenses, late charges, NFS check charges, appraisal fees, [etc];"" and (5) the current interest rate on their mortgage account. 
(Pines Decl., Ex. J.) Plaintiffs' letter of July 13, 2009 appears to request similar information. (Id., Ex. O.)"
1119,8," For example, in responding to one of Plaintiffs' letters, IndyMac Mortgage Services wrote: ""Under the Real Estate Settlement 
Procedures Act (RESPA) your letter is considered a RESPA - Qualified Written Request (RESPA - QWR)."" (Id., Ex. H.) "
1120,9," HN19[
] Section 2605(a) requires disclosure ""to each person who applies for the loan, at the time of application for the loan, whether the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold, or transferred to any other person at any time while the loan is 
outstanding."""
1120,10," The Deed of Trust provides that: The Note or partial interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument)  [*32] can be sold one or more times without 
prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the ""Loan Servicer"") that collects Periodic 
Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under 
the Note, this Security Interest, and Applicable Law. There also might be one or more changes of the Loan Servicer 
unrelated to a sale of the Note. (OneWest's RJN, Ex. A, P 20.) "
1124,11," The last paragraph of the Notice of Default reads as follows: The Beneficiary or its designated agent declares it has contacted the borrower, tried with due diligence to contact the 
borrower as required by California Civil Code ยง 2923.5, or the borrower has surrendered the property to the beneficiary or 
authorized agent, or is otherwise exempt from the requirements of ยง 2923.5. (Def. OneWest's RJN, Ex. C.) "
1131,1," Simon also contends that REC Inc.'s ""sham litigation"" claim cannot be interpreted as an abuse of process claim under 
Pennsylvania law. Because REC Inc. does not contend that it alleged such a counterclaim, we need not address Simon's 
argument on this point."
1131,2," In its opposition brief, REC Inc. failed to address Simon's contention that REC Inc. lacks antitrust standing. Because we 
dispose of this motion on other grounds, we need not address this argument."
1131,3," HN2[
] Although a violation of antitrust law underlies any ""sham litigation"" exception to antitrust immunity, a claimant need not allege a specific violation of the antitrust laws, especially in the context of the liberal pleading standards and a Rule 12(b)(6) 
motion. See TruePosition, Inc. v. Allen Telecom, No. 01-823, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 881, 2003 WL 151227, at *4 n.4 (D. Del. 
Jan. 21, 2003) "
1132,4," Neither party relied on Third Circuit case law regarding the application (or lack thereof) of Noerr-Pennington immunity to protect 
petitioning of the government from claims brought under non-antitrust federal and state laws. The court, however, was able to 
find at least one such case. See Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp. et al., 168 F.3d 119, 128-29 (3d Cir. 1999) (applying Noerr-
Pennington immunity to New Jersey state law claims)."
1132,5," Simon's contention, however, that REC Inc.'s ""sham litigation"" claim fails because Simon had probable cause in filing this 
lawsuit is of no  [**8] avail. At this stage in the litigation, the court's probable cause analysis is based exclusively on the 
allegations set forth in REC Inc.'s counterclaim. Here, REC Inc. alleges in a conclusory fashion that ""Simon had no basis for 
bringing the present lawsuit or contacting the U.S. Attorney."" [Doc. No. 60]. While REC Inc. need not prove that Simon lacked 
probable cause at this stage, it must allege circumstances that would give rise to a lack of probable cause. "
1139,1," The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court 
pursuant to General Statutes ยง 51-199 (c) and Practice Book ยง 65-1."
1139,2," The plaintiffs are (1) Neighborhood Builders, Inc., (2) Peter Smith Building Company, LLC, (3) The Dowler Group, LLC, (4) 
MJM Builders, Inc., and (5) Richard Gentile Building Company, LLC, all of which applied to the town for building permits after 
 [***4] the town amended its ordinances on April 1, 2003, to increase the permit cost. We refer to these five plaintiffs collectively 
as the plaintiffs throughout this opinion. Paul Coady Construction, LLC, which also was a plaintiff, withdrew from the action on 
October 19, 2006."
1139,3," General Statutes ยง 7-130i HN1[
] grants municipalities the power to charge or levy fees for the cost of services provided."
1139,4," General Statutes ยง 7-148 (c) (2) (B) grants municipalities the power to ""[a]ssess, levy and collect taxes . . . ."""
1139,5," Article tenth of the constitution of Connecticut HN2[
] provides that the General Assembly may delegate to municipalities such 
authority as it deems appropriate and may prescribe the methods by which municipalities may establish regional governments 
and enter into compacts."
1139,6," Title 42 of the United States Code, ยง 1983, HN3[
] provides in relevant part: ""Every person who, under color of any statute, 
ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, 
any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or 
immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,  [***5] shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or 
other proper proceeding for redress . . . ."""
1139,7," General Statutes ยง 42-110b HN4[
] provides in relevant part: ""(a) No person shall engage in unfair methods of competition 
and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce. . . ."" "
1140,8," The plaintiffs, all of which are small businesses established as either a limited liability company or a Connecticut corporation 
with its principal place of business in Connecticut, specifically alleged that revenues derived by the town from the payment of 
building permit fees are significantly in excess of the cost to the town of regulating building activity, and that the town unlawfully 
uses the fees to fund social programs and other initiatives that bear no relationship to the regulation of building activity."
1140,9," Practice Book ยง 9-7 provides: HN5[
] ""One or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on 
behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there are questions of law or fact

1140,11," Specifically, the court dismissed the first four counts, namely, those alleging violations of ยงยง 7-130i and 7-148 (counts one and 
two), article tenth of the Connecticut constitution (count three), and 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 (count four). We hereinafter refer to these

CUTPA as the fifth count, the CUTPA count or the CUTPA claim."
1140,12," Paul Coady Construction, LLC, also was a plaintiff when the original complaint was filed. It later withdrew from the action. See 
footnote 2 of this opinion. "
1141,13, See footnote 7 of this opinion.
1141,14," General Statutes ยง 42-110g (a) provides: HN9[

1142,16," In contrast, the town had argued in its summary judgment motion that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on count 
five because CUTPA does not apply to municipalities or to claims of enforcement of municipal ordinances generally, and the 
building code in particular, because the municipal regulation of building construction within municipal boundaries, including the 
charging of permit fees, is an integral part of a town's municipal powers under ยง 7-148. The town made a similar argument in its 
motion to dismiss. The trial court, however, took no action  [***16] on the summary judgment motion and denied the motion to 
dismiss with respect to the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim. "
1143,17," The town can pursue this issue in connection with its summary judgment motion, and any decision thereon could be reviewed 
on appeal. "
1144,18," In Ganim, we described HN16[
] the remoteness/standing  [***22] test as follows: ""[T]hree policy factors . . . guide courts in 
their application of the general principle that plaintiffs with indirect injuries lack standing to sue . . . . First, the more indirect an 
injury is, the more difficult it becomes to determine the amount of . . . damages attributable to the wrongdoing as opposed to 
other, independent factors. Second, recognizing claims by the indirectly injured would require courts to adopt complicated rules 
apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, in order to avoid the risk of 
multiple recoveries. Third, struggling with the first two problems is unnecessary [when] there are directly injured parties who can 
remedy the harm without these attendant problems."" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Ganim v. Smith & 
Wesson Corp., supra, 258 Conn. 353. The purpose of the test is to determine whether the harm allegedly suffered is indirect, 
remote and derivative with respect to the defendant's conduct, and, therefore, whether the plaintiff can allege an ascertainable 
loss and thus have standing. See id. "
1149,1," These claims are for: (1) unlawful acquisition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act; (2) unlawful conspiracy in violation of 
Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act; (3) unlawful monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act; (4) 
unlawful attempt to monopolize in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act; (5) unlawful conspiracy to monopolize in

1151,4," Funai attacks Vizio's three claims under Section 2 (claims three, four, and five) on two additional grounds--that they rest on the 
defective ""shared monopoly"" theory and that Vizio failed to plead anticompetitive conduct. The Court, however, need not reach 
these issues, as the Section 2 claims fail on other grounds, namely failing to allege a harm to competition. "
1163,1," The factual assertions in this section are based on the allegations in Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint unless otherwise 
specified. "
1172,1," The court infers from the facts set forth in the FAC that the term FMMO refers to both the geographical area and the Federal 
Milk Marketing Order that sets the minimum pricing  [**6] structure in that area. "
1182,1," West-Ward's motion contains a short, 3-page brief that fully joins the Motion to Dismiss of the rest of the co-defendants and 
makes no additional arguments specific to West-Ward. "
1183,2," Because this case was transferred, certain docket notations do not appear on the District of New Jersey Docket (No. 09-5421). 
Documents that are only available on the Central District of California docket (No. 09-5700) will be referenced by ""Cal. Doc. No."" 
while documents available on the District of New Jersey docket will be referenced as ""Doc. No."" If documents are available on 
both dockets, the D.N.J. docket number will be used. "
1184,3," In their various submissions, the parties do not appear to dispute that California law applies to the California state law claims. It 
appears, however,  [*12] that a choice of law issue may apply to West-Ward's counterclaim. In Part II below, the Court 
concludes that a choice of law analysis is premature at this stage of this case. As such, for the purposes of the instant Rule 12 
analysis of the California state law claims expressly pled and briefed under California law, the Court will assume arguendo that 
California law controls those claims. "
1186,4," The Court notes that these are legal conclusions and are not entitled to the Court's acceptance. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct.

Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 27 n.1, 123 S. Ct. 2041, 156 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2003). "
1187,6," The Court notes that only the portions of the complaint alleging violations of the ""unfair"" prong of Section 17200 will be stricken. 
Lozano makes it clear that Section 17200 can still be violated by false or misleading advertisements under Section 17500. "
1191,1, Newsome's complaint contains allegations similar to those contained  [*4] in O'Bannon's more comprehensive complaint.
1191,2," Newsome refers to Form 09-3a, which appears to contain the same language as Form 08-3a. "
1194,3," O'Bannon argues that Defendants' price-fixing scheme is per se unreasonable because ""[a]ny conspiracy to fix prices . . . is 
illegal per se."" O'Bannon Opp'n to NCAA's Mot. at 4. O'Bannon misstates the law. As noted above, horizontal agreements to fix 
prices are per se illegal. In contrast, ""[v]ertical price restraints are to be judged according to the rule of reason."" Leegin Creative, 
551 U.S. at 907."
1194,4," The Court notes that O'Bannon purportedly  [*15] quotes language from Harkins Amusement Enterprises v. General Cinema 
Corporation, 850 F.2d 477 (9th Cir. 1988); however, the quoted language does not appear in that case. O'Bannon must ensure 
that he accurately represents case law. "
1199,1," Because the court can resolve the instant motion on other grounds, the court leaves for another day the question of whether 
Defendant De Spirito has standing independent of non-party Hoosier Eye Doctor, Inc. to raise counterclaims. "
1204,2," Defendant speculates out of whole cloth that the withdrawal occurred after CIBA received complaints from other eye doctors, 
but the counterclaim offers no information on the who-what-why-where of these complaints. Further, Defendant De Spirito has 
done nothing to explain how the instant situation goes beyond a legitimate ""termination [that] came about in response to 
complaints"" nor has he explained how an agreement can be inferred from the mere existence of complaints. See Monsanto Co. 
v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 763-64, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984). "
1211,*," District Judge John G. Koeltl of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation. "
1213,1," Our sister circuits have applied similar reasoning to the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (""1996 Act""). See TON 
Servs., Inc. v. Qwest Corp., 493 F.3d 1225, 1236-38 (10th Cir. 2007); Davel Commc'ns, Inc. v. Qwest Corp., 460 F.3d 1075, 
1084-86 (9th Cir. 2006). The 1996 Act makes a ""common carrier . . . liable to the person or persons injured . . . for the full 
amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation of the provisions of this chapter,"" 47 U.S.C. ยง 206, and 
expressly provides that ""[a]ny person claiming to be damaged  [**9] by any common carrier . . . may bring suit for the recovery of

concluding that ""the filed-tariff doctrine does not bar a suit to enforce a command of the very regulatory statute giving rise to the 
tariff-filing requirement,"" the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit twice referenced the 1996 Act's private right of action. Davel 
Commc'ns, Inc. v. Qwest Corp., 460 F.3d at 108 & n.35. No similar private right exists here."
1213,2," Plaintiffs cite cases declining to apply the filed rate doctrine in challenges to title insurance kickbacks under the federal Real 
Estate Settlement Procedures Act (""RESPA""), 12 U.S.C. ยง 2601 et seq. See Alexander v. Wash. Mut., Inc., No. 07-4426, 2008 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50523, 2008 WL 2600323, at *2-3 (E.D. Pa. June 30, 2008); Blaylock v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 504 F. Supp.

These cases are inapposite because RESPA provides both an independent right, see 12 U.S.C. ยง 2607(a), and a remedy, see 
id. ยง 2607(d)(2), which plaintiffs do not invoke here. "
1214,3," In Georgia v. Pennsylvania Railroad, the Supreme Court noted that the proposed injunction did not require the Court ""to trench 
on the domain of the Commission."" 324 U.S. at 461. The only concerted action plaintiffs plead here is defendants' membership 
in TIRSA, a licensed rate service organization. Thus, an injunction against defendants' alleged ""concerted efforts,"" by itself, 
would disrupt the Department's jurisdiction over rate service organizations in a manner not contemplated by Georgia. Compare 
id. at 456 (noting that Congress did not exempt carriers from antitrust laws or grant agency authority to control or supervise 
collective rate-setting), with N.Y. Ins. Law ยงยง 2306 (permitting insurers to file rates through rate service organizations), 2313 
(granting authority to license and regulate such organizations), 2320-21 (granting enforcement authority over such

protects parties from antitrust liability predicated on acts of petitioning the government. With respect to litigation as 
anticompetitive conduct, the Supreme Court has held: ""litigation cannot b deprived of immunity as a sham unless the litigation is 
objectively baseless."" Prof'l Real Estate Investors v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 508 U.S. 49, 51, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d

1263,10," The encryption allegations cannot support any of Allflex's causes of action because they form the same transactional nucleus 
of facts as the Wisconsin litigation. "
1264,11," Allflex also includes a new allegation of promoting and maintaining an Avid-only national database for RFID companion animal 
identification data. "
1270,1," The court previously dismissed the claims against the Village of Lake Bluff and Village Trustees Michael Peters, David 
Barkhausen, and Rick Lesser for failure  [**2] to state a claim, leaving Lake Forest Hospital as the sole defendant. "
1271,2," It appears that an attorney named Sandy Stein was also present during at least one Board meeting. Pl. Ex. 14 at 40:91-6. The 
parties regrettably do not identify this person in their Rule 56.1 statements or summary judgment filings, so the court cannot 
ascertain who his/her client might be. This problem is illustrative of the issues the court faced when addressing the summary 
judgment motion: the parties generally assume that the court is familiar with the large cast of characters and the chain of events 
at the heart of the parties' dispute and do not consistently provide identifying details in their filings. This practice, coupled with 
the parties' decision to omit any summary of the facts from their filings and to instead rely only on their Rule 56.1 statements, 
contributed to the delay in resolving the instant motion for summary judgment. "
1273,3," Lake Bluff's zoning code permits it to deny approval  [**9] for a site plan based on the following criteria: (1) the site plan 
application is materially incomplete; (2) the proposed site plan fails to meet applicable zoning standards; (3) the proposed site 
plan is detrimental to the use and enjoyment of the surrounding property; (4) the proposed site plan creates undue traffic 
congestion or safety hazards; (5) the site plan landscaping does not provide adequate shielding from or for nearby uses; (6) the 
proposed site plan creates unreasonable drainage or erosion problems; (7) the proposed site plan places unwarranted burdens 
on utility systems; and (8) restrictions related to the Central Business District (not applicable to the Mercatus project). See Lake 
Bluff Zoning Code ยง 10-1-9(D)(4), 10-1-9(E)(1)-(8), Def. Ex. 14 at 14-009-10."
1273,4," In support of its statement of fact regarding the three pronged approach, Mercatus points to deposition testimony of Damon 
Havill, director of planning and business development for Lake Forest Hospital. The court agrees with Mercatus' characterization 
of Mr. Havill's testimony. Lake Forest Hospital's denial of the corresponding portions of Mercatus' Rule 56.1 statement is thus 
unavailing, as Mr. Havill said what he said. Thus, Lake Forest Hospital cannot redline portions of Mr. Havill's deposition."
1273,5," Unsurprisingly, Lake Forest Hospital disagrees with Mr. Durkins' views. However, the court declines to accept Lake Forest 
Hospital's invitation to reject Mr. Durkin's report wholesale as Mr. Durkin considered evidence in the record that a fact-finder 
could find was consistent with his views. See, e.g., Pl. Ex. 8 at 178-180 (CEO of Lake Forest Hospital testified that he spoke with "
1274,," staff at Highland Park Hospital, and Advocate  [**13] Condell Medical Center to urge them not to support the project); Pl. Ex. 73 
(emails between a physician liaison at Lake Forest Hospital to Lake Forest Hospital's CEO dated after the Village Board and 
Evanston Northwestern Hospital withdrew their support for Mercatus and lauding Lake Forest Hospital for its successful efforts 
to prevent Mercatus from ""invad[ing] other territories around the Suburbs!!!""). "
1275,6," Mercatus amended its complaint after the court issued its decision ruling on the motion to dismiss. The amended complaint 
removed the counts directed at the Village defendants and added three new antitrust claims directed at Lake Forest Hospital, but 
did not otherwise change the allegations directed at Lake Forest Hospital. "
1279,7," The court acknowledges Mercatus' assertion that Lake Forest Hospital provided false or misleading information to try to 
convince potential tenants to stay away. According to Mercatus, this meant that Mercatus lacked key tenants and thus could not 
have successfully proceeded even with the Village of Lake Bluff's approval. From an injury perspective, however, the Village did 
not give its approval. In any event, as discussed below, the actions at issue are misleading statements and expressions of 
opinion about competitors' plans and thus do not support a finding of antitrust injury. "

1283,4," While Malibu alleges a single count of inequitable conduct, Count XIII, the allegations referenced in Count XIII present 
 [*9] eight distinct factual scenarios allegedly giving rise to separate instances of inequitable conduct. (Doc. 36). Accordingly, the

associated with the inventor, with the assignee or anyone to whom there is an obligation to assign the application. "
1285,6," In Paragraph 40, Malibu recites a conclusory allegation that Correct Craft prosecutors ""failed to disclose to the Patent Office 
myriad other documentary and video evidence from the Protest during its later prosecution of the '819, '762, '159, and 761 
patents, despite the materiality of that evidence to those patents."" (Doc. 36 P 40). This allegation of inequitable conduct is 
unsupported by the alleged facts, which fail to identify which claims and which limitations in those claims the withheld references 
are relevant to, and where in those references the material information is found. See Exergen, 575 F.3d at 1329-30. As such, 
Paragraph 40 fails to meet the ""who, what, and where"" requirements and Count XIII will  [*14] be dismissed to the extent it relies

contract result in higher costs and lower quality services for MDU  [**9] residents. Such reports do little to support Appellants' 
argument on appeal. As Appellees point out and Appellants apparently concede, these reports provide no definition of a relevant 
geographic market, because such an antitrust-specific definition is not directly relevant to the FTC reports. While the FTC's 
conclusions are informative regarding the anticompetitive nature of certain behavior, those conclusions are not dispositive of 
whether an antitrust violation has occurred. See, e.g., Goldwasser v. Ameritech Corp., 222 F.3d 390, 399-400 (7th Cir. 2000)

Amerigas and Thompson Gas plaintiffs do present some different arguments in their briefs, it was counsel for the Amerigas 
plaintiffs who addressed the court on behalf of the plaintiffs. I am assuming for the purposes of this motion that the arguments 
advanced by Amerigas' counsel at the hearing are adopted by the Thompson Gas plaintiffs. "

Minpeco, S.A. v. Hunt, 718 F. Supp. 168, 171-72 (S.D.N.Y. 1989), where the court found that the plaintiffs had adequately pled 
or proven, respectively, month-long monopolies, but in neither case was durability specifically considered by the court."

1367,13," Judge Posner cited Peto in Kohen v. Pacific Investment Management Company, 571 F.3d 672, 674 (7th Cir. 2009), a CEA 
case, as support for the statement that ""A corner is a form of monopolization."" This lends credence to the notion that Peto is still 
good law, even on the issue of a month-long corner as a monopoly. Defendant argued at the October 7, 2009 hearing that Judge 
Posner was using the term ""monopoly"" not in the formal, legal sense, but rather in a more colloquial way, to mean the holding of 
a big position. But Judge Posner's citation of Peto, and other sources that define monopoly in a futures market suggests quite 
the opposite. Id."
1367,14," Prof. Areeda's view is not irreconcilable with the Court's holding in Peto, nor is it irreconcilable with the  [**19] facts alleged in 
this case. Assuming that the relevant market is as narrow as Plaintiffs claim, three or four weeks without new entries to the 
market can be considered a ""significant period."" "
1369,15," It should be noted that Plaintiffs have also failed to identify any specific BP Defendant who made any specific 
misrepresentation at any specific time to any specific Plaintiff representative, which fails to satisfy pleading requirements of 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Which particular misrepresentations were made, to whom, and how, would certainly be 
within Plaintiffs' knowledge and are not facts exclusively held by Defendants. And where claims for fraud in Illinois require 
personal reliance on the alleged misrepresentation, such information is crucial to determining whether this element  [**28] is 
adequately pled. "

Services, LLC (""Viewpointe""). See Dkt No. 1876 at 1. First Tennessee and First Horizon, however, have recently settled with 
Plaintiff. "
1395,2," Defendants submit that the Court denied Plaintiff's request ""as 'not sufficiently stated.'"" Defendants are incorrect. The Court's 
order included these words in the ""Request"" column as part of its ""general topic"" summary of Plaintiff's request, not as an 
explanation of its denial of Plaintiff's request. See Dkt. No. 1822. "
1402,3," If a Defendant chooses to argue that any infringement was not willful because it sought opinions of counsel, then presumably 
Plaintiffs would be entitled to respond that the Defendant is withholding those opinions of counsel. Defendants apparently do not 
intend to make such an argument, so the Court need not resolve any issues of admissibility or privilege waiver that such a 
situation might raise."
1402,4," See also Broadcom, 543 F.3d at 698 (citations omitted) (emphasis added): [I]n the context of instructions pertaining to 
willfulness, the district court instructed the jury as follows: "
1403,," In considering whether [the accused infringer] acted in good faith, you should consider all the circumstances, including 
whether or not [the accused infringer] obtained and followed the advice of a competent lawyer with regard to infringement. 
The absence of a lawyer's opinion, by itself, is insufficient to support a finding of willfulness, and you may not assume that 
merely because a party did not obtain an opinion of counsel, the opinion would have been unfavorable. However, you may 
consider whether [the accused infringer] sought a legal opinion as one factor in assessing whether, under the totality of the 
circumstances, any infringement by [the accused infringer] was willful. This instruction comports with our holding in Knorr-Bremse Systeme Fuer Nutzfahrzeuge, GmbH v. Dana Corp., where we held 
that there is not ""a legal duty upon a potential infringer to consult with counsel, such that failure to do so will provide an inference 
or evidentiary presumption that such opinion would have been negative."""
1403,5," Cf. id. at 699 (""It would be manifestly unfair to allow opinion-of-counsel evidence to serve an exculpatory function . . . and yet 
not permit patentees to identify failures to procure such advice as circumstantial evidence of intent to infringe."")"
1403,6," Even without explicit argument, evidence that Defendant obtained opinions of counsel but has declined to produce them would 
likely lead to an inference by the jury that such opinions of counsel were negative, even if the Court gives a limiting instruction. In 
addition to the impermissibility of such an inference, any probative value would be substantially outweighed by the danger of 
unfair prejudice and jury confusion. See Fed. R. Evid. 403. "
1404,7," As to evidence of licensing offered to show commercial success as a secondary consideration of nonobviousness, the Court 
addresses the propriety of such use by separate order on Defendants' motion to exclude the opinions of Plaintiff's damages 
expert, Christopher Bokhart, regarding commercial success (Dkt. No. 1836)."

1405,10," In so ruling, the Court does not assess other issues that may bear on the admissibility of particular documents at trial, such as 
any specific objections or compliance with Joint Final Pretrial Order requirements. "
1411,11, SVPCo is a predecessor or division of TCH.

1414,13," The Court ruled on Viewpointe's motion on February 10, 2010. Dkt. No. 1932. At the February 18, 2010 Initial Pretrial 
Conference, Plaintiff represented that it is no longer pursuing a theory that Viewpointe is a ""mastermind"" for purposes of joint 
infringement. Viewpointe requested permission to re-urge its motion for summary judgment, and the Court granted permission. 
Viewpointe filed its renewed motion for summary judgment on February 22, 2010. Dkt. No. 1960. That motion is currently 
pending and is being briefed by the parties. The issues presented by this renewed motion for summary judgment do not directly 
bear on this in limine item. "

1422,3," This court previously informed the parties in its Scheduling Order and Order on Motions dated December 17, 2009 that it 
intended to rule on AIBT's motion for fees and costs following a ruling on Varian's motion to dismiss, and that it would consider 
what discovery, if any, would be necessary following the outcome of the motion to dismiss. (Docket No. 81)."

1429,3," Amex also uses a four-party model in which it licenses banks to issue Amex trademarked cards to cardholders. Amex pays 
merchants the amount of the transaction less its merchant discount fee. The bank then pays Amex the amount of the transaction 
but retains an ""issuer rate discount"" as its service fee for the transaction."

engages in the anticompetitive conduct that is a prerequisite for suit."" Berkey, 603 F.2d at 296. "
1433,9," Plaintiffs bring this action against two separate legal entities; American Express Company and, its wholly-owned subsidiary, 
American Express Travel Related Services, Inc. But a parent corporation cannot conspire with its wholly-owned subsidiary. 
Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 771. "
1434,10," [U]ncertain damages, which prevent recovery, are distinguishable from uncertain extent of damage, which does not prevent 
recovery. The former denotes failure to establish an injury, while the latter denotes imprecision with regard to the scope or extent 
of the injury. The question of whether there is a right to recovery is not to be confused with the difficulty in ascertaining the scope 
or extent of the injury. Pace Indus., Inc. v. Three Phoenix Co., 813 F.2d 234, 240 (9th Cir. 1987) (internal citations omitted); see also Charlotte 
Telecasters, Inc. v. Jefferson-Pilot Corp., 546 F.2d 570, 573 (4th Cir. 1976); Camotex, S.R.L, v. Hunt, 741 F. Supp. 1086, 1090 
(S.D.N.Y. 1990)."
1434,11," The court notes that Plaintiffs' claims would be time-barred if the speculative damages exception were limited to apply only 
when the fact of damage is speculative. The fact that Amex's merchant agreements would inflict antitrust harm, if at all, is equally 
clear today as it was when Plaintiffs first executed the agreements and when they paid Amex's discount fee. The obligations of 
both parties were clearly set forth in the agreement's anti-steering rules and other provisions.  [**22] Those obligations have not 
changed. Only the merchant discount fee changed. But any change in the discount fee affects the amount of damages, not the 
fact of damage. "
1435,12," Should Plaintiffs' amend their pleadings, different limitations rules may apply. See, e.g., Klehr, 521 U.S. at 189 (noting that in a 
""price-fixing conspiracy that brings about a series of unlawfully high priced sales over a period of years โฆ each sale to the 
plaintiff, starts the statutory period running again โฆ"" (internal quotation marks omitted)). "
1436,13," In Kaiser, the Fifth Circuit stated that under the continuing benefit version of the continuing violation exception, collecting 
contractual payment is an overt act if antitrust damages were speculative when the underlying cause of action accrued. 677 F.2d 
at 1051-52. The Second Circuit has not recognized this exception. This court declines to categorically hold that contract-
payment collections constitute overt acts when damages are speculative. In light of the weight of authority stating that contract 
payments do not constitute overt acts, see infra note 15, the court applies the two-fold overt act test to determine whether a 
particular contract payment constitutes an overt act. "
1437,14," Plaintiffs also allege generally that Amex aggressively enforced its merchant agreements. ""Active enforcement of an illegal 
contract may, under certain circumstances, cause renewal of an injury and restart the statute of limitations"" under the continuing 
violation exception. Aurora Enters., Inc. v. Nat'l Broad. Co., 688 F.2d 689, 694 (9th Cir. 1982); see Twin City Sportservice, Inc. v. 
Charles O. Finley & Co., Inc., 512 F.2d 1264, 1269-70 (9th Cir. 1975). Because Plaintiffs do not allege any actual acts of 
enforcement towards them, the court cannot address whether Amex's enforcement actions constitute overt acts."
1437,15," Courts routinely state that contract payments cannot constitute overt acts. See Grand Rapids Plastics. Inc. v. Lakian, 188 F.3d 
401, 406 (6th Cir. 1999) (""even if the payment agreement constituted a continuing violation . . .the individual payments โฆ were 
only a manifestation of the previous agreement. The individual payments  [**34] therefore do not constitute a 'new and 
independent actโฆ'""); Eichman v. Fotomat Corp., 880 F.2d 149 (9th Cir. 1989) (""passive receipt of profits from an illegal contract 
by an antitrust defendant is not an overt act of enforcement which will restart the statute of limitations""); Aurora Enters., Inc. v. 
Nat'l Broad. Co., 688 F.2d 689, 694 (9th Cir. 1982) (""that defendants receive a benefit today as a result of a contract executed"" 
before the limitations period ""is not enough to restart the statute of limitations""); In re Ciprofloxacin, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 229 
(holding that payments contemplated by the fixed terms of challenged agreements are not sufficient to restart the limitations 
period); In re Buspirone, 185 F. Supp. 2d at 379 (payments that are ""mere consequences of the original Agreementโฆ do not 
restart the statute of limitations""). "
1438,16," This court does not apply Berkey's accrual rule for monopolization claims to Plaintiffs section one claims. In this case Plaintiffs' 
section one causes of action accrued when they executed their merchant agreements--when Plaintiffs' allege they first suffered 
an antitrust injury. (See CVS Compl. P 53) (""As a direct and proximate result of Amex's imposition and enforcement of the anti-
steering rules, CVS was injured in its business by โฆ being compelled to adhere to the anti-steering rules."")"
1438,17," CVS alleges that Amex increased its discount fee during the relevant period. In their brief, Plaintiffs represent that the 
allegations contained in CVS's Complaint are substantially  [**38] similar to the allegations in all the individual-plaintiff 
Complaints except for differences in paragraph numbering. The court's holding that a new cause of action accrued each time 
Amex unilaterally adjusted its fee during the limitations period only applies to an individual plaintiff to the extent that Amex 
adjusted its discount fee for that individual plaintiff during the limitations period. "
