22,1," Neither party pointed the Court to evidence that Schubert actually made this statement. However, as the Defendants to not 
contest the issue, the Court will accept the allegation as true for summary judgment purposes. "
23,2," The claims are numbered here as they are in the body of the Complaint, rather than on the cover page. "
25,3," Furthermore, the Court notes that the plaintiffs in Schachar did allege a dual role: ""Plaintiffs say that the Academy is in the grip 
of professors and practitioners who favor conservative treatment, forever calling for more research (the better to justify the 
academics' request for grants)."" Id. at 399."
25,4," The parties do not dispute that swimsuits are ""Specialized Equipment"" and that the Olympic Trials and Olympic Games are 
""Protected Competition."" "
26,5," However, TYR points out that an extra swimmer was added as an alternate, even though she had not qualified based on her 
time at the Trials. (SGI Speedo ¶ 40.)"
26,6," TYR offers the argument that Schubert could influence who reached the wall first through psychological means by ""planting in 
swimmers' minds that the [Speedo suit] is superior and that other suits are inferior."" (Opp'n to Speedo 7-8.) This supposed 
psychological trick does not constitute coercion."
26,7, Burden was sponsored by TYR and Sutton was an amateur that chose to wear TYR.
26,8, A swimmer for the men's open water team was also sponsored by TYR. (Zimmer Depo. at 113:16-21.) 
27,9, Murphy wore a TYR and D'Innocenzo wore a Blue 70 suit. (King Depo. at 19:3-4.)
27,10, The record is silent on whether D'Innocenzo stuck with the Speedo suit.
27,11, This testimony presents an obvious hearsay problem. Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).
27,12," In any case, Murphy disobeyed Schubert and wore his personal TYR cap for the remainder for the meet, apparently without 
punishment. (King Depo. at 55:4-19.)"
27,13," The parties dispute whether Schubert was referring to an advantage the LZR Racer had over the old Speedo suit, the FS Pro, 
or over all suits currently in the marketplace. "
28,14," The swimmers sometimes receive bonuses from sponsors for being chosen to the relay team. (See, e.g., TYR Exs. 18 at 18, 
19 at Ex. A.)"
28,15," The combination of resources and expertise of USA Swimming and Speedo is likely to help innovation in swimsuit technology, 
thereby benefitting the consumer. "
29,16," ""USA Swimming and Schubert misread the [Court's order on the motions to dismiss] (and the referenced authorities), and they 
fundamentally mischaracterize—i.e., narrow the focus—of the allegations and evidence establishing defendants' coordinated 
anti-competitive conduct. USA Swimming and Schubert try to cast TYR's claims as limited to the 2008 Olympic team and limited 
to the rules regarding swimwear of choice. However, the anticompetitive conduct shown by TYR is much broader: it predates the 
Olympics by more than a year and encompasses behavior unrelated to team selection and technical equipment rules. Put in 
summary judgment parlance, USA Swimming and Schubert fail to meet their burden of negating an essential element of TYR's 
claims or demonstrating an absence of evidence supporting them because they miscast them in the narrow range they think falls 
within the 'undisputed evidence.'"" (Opp'n to USA Swimming 13.) "
30,17," Speedo, citing Morgan, object to Furniss's declaration on the grounds that it is impermissible lay witness testimony on the 
technical subject of the relevant geographic market. See 924 F.2d at 1490. This is objection is overruled because Furniss 
testifies only as to factual characteristics of the geographic market, which is within his competency as an industry veteran. He 
does not give an conclusory opinion on market definition, unlike the witnesses in Morgan. See id. "
31,18," At the elite level, most swimmers are sponsored by a swimwear company and do not purchase their own suits. "
32,19, The Court does not reach the question of whether Schubert's statement can be proven literally false. 
33,20," It is worth noting that it appears that TYR terminated Vendt—not vice versa. (See TYR Ex. 45.) TYR's action was predicated 
on Vendt's choice to wear a competitor's suit, but he had appears to have had a unilateral contractual right to do so. (Speedo Ex. 
283 § 3.5.)"
33,21," Vendt's testimony is unclear as to whether the March 2008 calls were with TYR or Schubert; Vendt appears to have been 
confused by the question. (See Vendt Depo. at 149:2-12.). However, the Court accepts TYR's interpretation for summary 
judgment purposes."
33,22," This is especially true because Schubert did not use his discretionary fund to pay Vendt until April 2008, roughly three months 
after TYR canceled his endorsement deal. (Schubert Depo. at 218:22-219:3.) And although Vendt claimed to have a Speedo 
deal in March 2008, (Vendt Depo., Ex. 295), Speedo did not propose a sponsorship deal until May 2008, four months after the 
end of his TYR deal, and, because of this suit, no deal was ever reached. (Supp. Isaac Decl. ¶¶ 4-6.) "
34,23," ""I do believe that one time over a Thanksgiving [Vendt and his girlfriend, Kim] ... wanted to try to roast a turkey for the first time 
in their lives, and they brought a turkey over. And my wife helped them, and even went back to their apartment to help them 
finish off cooking the turkey. I was not involved in that process, thank goodness."" (Issac Depo. 227:4-11.)"
34,24," The combination of Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules results in a minimum 49-day 
motions cycle. "
36,1, This disposition is not designated for publication in the official reports.
36,2," In an order dated March 4, 2008, the Court dismissed a seventh claim alleging per se unreasonable tying under § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. "
37,3," A fourth individual, James Donohue, voluntarily dismissed his claims without prejudice. "
39,4," ""The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the district courts of the Ninth Circuit have routinely treated 'monopoly power' and 
'market power' as synonymous terms in the context of a § 2 Sherman Act claim."" IGT v. Alliance Gaming Corp., No. 2:04-CV-
1676-RCJ-RJJ, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111770, 2008 WL 7071468, at *10 (D. Nev. Oct. 21, 2008) [*12] ; see, e.g., United States 
v. LSL Biotechs., 379 F.3d 672, 696 (9th Cir.2004) (""The power relevant to antitrust is market power, or as some economists put 
it 'monopoly power.'""); Image Technical Servs., Inc. v. Wash. Natural Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 950 n.15 (9th Cir. 1996) (stating, in 
a § 2 action, that ""[t]he terms 'market power' and 'monopoly power' are used interchangeably herein""); Cyntegra, Inc. v. Idexx 
Laboratories, Inc., 520 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1209 (C.D. Cal.2007) (""The first element of a § 2 claim requires monopoly power (also 
known as market power), which is 'the power to control prices or exclude competition.'""). "
40,5," eBay raises evidentiary objections to certain documents cited in Plaintiffs' opposition papers as direct evidence of market 
power. Because the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to show that there is a triable issue of fact even with the 
contested evidence, the objections are moot. "
41,6," eBay objects to each document cited by Plaintiffs in support of the Brown Shoe factors. eBay asks that the documents be 
excluded or, in the alternative, that eBay be given the opportunity to supplement some of them to put the documents in context, 
on one or more of the following grounds: relevance, authentication, inadmissible hearsay, or lack of context. The objections are overruled. Each of the documents cited meets the relevance standards of Rules 401 and 402. Similarly, the 
statements challenged as hearsay either are not offered for the truth of the matters asserted; are admissions by eBay, its 
employees, or its agents within the scope of the employment or agency; or are admissible under Rule 803. The documents all 
are properly authenticated either  [*21] by virtue of their production by eBay or by a third party pursuant to discovery requests in 
this litigation, their publication in newspapers or periodicals, their issuance as official government reports, or through the 
submission of a voice recording. While Rule 106 allows eBay to supplement the record with material it believes should be taken 
into consideration contemporaneously with any of Plaintiffs' submissions, it has not done so. "
44,7," In response  [*29] to eBay's reliance on the experience of the individual Named Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs argue that the 
substitutability of products should be viewed in the aggregate rather than at the individual level. To support this contention, 
Plaintiffs rely upon the decision of the District of Columbia Circuit in F.T.C. v. Whole Foods, 548 F.3d 1028, 383 U.S. App. D.C. 
341 (D.C. Cir. 2008). That case held that ""in some situations core consumers, demanding exclusively a particular product or 
package of products, distinguish a submarket."" Id. at 1041. Plaintiffs contend that with online auctions, as with the speciality 
grocery stores at issue in Whole Foods, the existence of ""fringe customers"" who may not use the format exclusively does not 
defeat the existence of a submarket. Plaintiffs also claim that economic theory typically calculates cross-elasticity of demand in 
the aggregate rather than at the individual level. eBay argues that Whole Foods is inapposite because, unlike the FTC, Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that eBay has 
discriminated against any online auction users, let alone users Plaintiffs would consider to be in the ""core"" subset for whom 
online auctions have no substitute. eBay also argues that the testimony  [*30] of all three Named Plaintiffs demonstrates that 
none of them is a member of Plaintiffs' proposed ""core"" of eBay sellers and thus none of them has standing to assert the instant 
claims. Because there are triable issues of fact as to Plaintiffs' proposed market definition based on the Brown Shoe factors, the Court 
does not address the applicability of a single out-of-circuit decision. Because eBay has not challenged the Named Plaintiffs' 
standing other than within the Whole Foods context, that issue is moot. "
50,1," The amended complaint does not allege that Jackson Hospital and Baptist Health cooperated in any way with each other, only 
that they both entered similar joint ventures with different DME providers. "
52,2," The defendants correctly assert that Key  [*12] Enterprises has no precedential authority since it was vacated on mootness 
grounds. However, a court can find the reasoning in vacated cases to be of persuasive value. See e.g., United States v. 
Johnson, 399 F.3d 1297, 1298 n.1 (2005) (concluding that a vacated opinion can have persuasive value). "
53,3," Park Avenue, although unpublished, obviously still can have persuasive value. Based on the similarities between Park Avenue 
and the present case, this court will look to the Sixth Circuit's treatment of the antitrust standing issue (particularly the issue of 
whether the plaintiffs were efficient enforcers of the antitrust law) as a guide to resolution of the question of standing in this 
case. To support their argument that there was antitrust standing, the plaintiffs looked to two cases that addressed whether a 
competitor DME provider had antitrust standing to bring suit. See Key Enterprises, 919 F.2d at 1559-60; Advanced Health-Care 
Services, Inc. v. Radford Community Hospital, 910 F.2d 139, 149 (4th Cir. 1990).  [*16] However, in neither of the cases did the 
court address the second prong of the antitrust-standing determination: whether the plaintiff would be an efficient enforcer of the 
antitrust laws. Todorov, which was decided after these two cases, requires that this court look to whether plaintiffs would be 
efficient enforcers of the antitrust laws in order to determine whether they have antitrust standing. Therefore, this court will look 
to Park Avenue because it provides more relevant guidance on this issue. "
55,4," Although the Sherman Act itself does not provide a private right of action, the Clayton Act permits private parties to seek 
damages or injunctive relief for antitrust violations. 15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26."
55,5," In Bonner v. Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals adopted as 
binding precedent all of the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 
1981. "
60,6," Because there are two hospital distributors in the relevant market, this case is distinguishable from the cases relied upon by 
that plaintiffs that involved claims of monopolization of DME markets under § 2 of the Sherman Act. In Key Enterprise, the claim 
of monopolization was brought against a single hospital, with monopoly power in the relevant market, and its affiliated DME 
supplier. 919 F.2d at 1552. In Advanced Health-Care Services, the claim of monopolization was brought against three separate 
hospitals and their affiliated DME suppliers in three different geographic markets in which the hospitals had monopoly power. 
910 F.2d at 141-43. Finally, in M&M Medical Supplies and Services, Inc., v. Pleasant Valley Hospital, Inc., the claim of 
monopolization was brought against a single hospital, with monopoly power in the relevant market, and its affiliated DME 
supplier. 981 F.2d 160, 162 (4th Cir. 1993)."

infringement. A patent gives a patent owner the right to exclude others from the marketplace for a statutory number of

shield it from antitrust liability). Abbott's patents do more to support its position than to assist Schor. Recall that the patents cover not only ritonavir 
administered by itself but also ritonavir administered in combination with another protease inhibitor. Abbott therefore could 
take control of the market in combination treatments until the patents expire. A patent does not permit its owner to condition 
use of the patented product on the surrender of a monopoly in some other unpatented product. But the product ""ritonavir in 
combination with another protease inhibitor"" is patented to Abbott, which therefore is entitled to monopolize the 
 [*15] combination. Id. (internal citations omitted). "
68,23," See Monsanto Co., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84512, at *5 (deciding to stay discovery on defendants' antitrust counterclaims 
alleging sham litigation, fraud on the patent office, misrepresentations of patent rights, and anticompetitive licensing restrictions). 
At the September 24, 2009 hearing on the present motion, counsel for Philips asserted that the court in Monsanto Co. (1) 
distinguished between patent-related antitrust claims that are sham litigation or Walker Process-based and independent antitrust 
claims and (2) ""decided to go ahead and proceed with those independent antitrust claims staying discovery only on the sham 
litigation claims."" D.I. 65-1 at 7. The distinction drawn in Monsanto Co., however, is more accurately characterized as one 
between antitrust counterclaims that could potentially be eliminated or narrowed by resolution of the plaintiff's patent claims and 
those that could not be so affected. The court in Monsanto Co. notes that through a separate trial on the plaintiffs' patent claims 
""there is the possibility of simplifying those claims alleging that Plaintiffs' license restrictions are anticompetitive."" Monsanto Co., 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84512, at *5.  [*16] The court later concludes, ""In sum . . . a stay of discovery and a separate trial of

88,2," In Figure 1, the male and female portion of the interlocking means are labeled as (24) and (42), respectively. "
89,3," The claim herein referred to as claim 13 was previously claim 18. Prior to several modifications, the patent contained additional 
claims that were subsequently removed."
89,4," The examiner's focus during examination of claims for compliance with the requirement for definiteness of 35 U.S.C. 112, 
second paragraph, is whether the claim meets the threshold requirements of clarity and precision. Manual of Patent Examining 
Procedure § 2173.02.  [*21] In responding to an obvious rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103, an applicant would amend his claims 
and argue against the references that form the basis for the rejection. See, e.g., Unique Concepts, Inc. v. Brown, 939 F.2d 1558 
(Fed. Cir. 1991). Frequently, this would consist of narrowing the claim to distinguish over the prior art. See, e.g., id. "
90,5," As discussed above, the Court found the specification to be the most instructive source in defining the term. See Phillips, 415 
F.3d at 1314-16 (explaining thatHN9[
]  terms within a patent ""must be read in view of the specification [(i.e., the written 
description of the invention, its embodiments, and the drawings)], of which they are a part.""). As such, the specification and the 
other claims in the patent were relied upon to arrive as the construction set forth above."
90,6," Plaintiff moved to dismiss Defendants' first Counterclaim, and this motion was denied on June 22, 2009. Plaintiff requests 
reconsideration of this motion, which the Court will address in Section IV, infra. "
91,7," The Court will consider Plaintiffs' motion to dismiss Defendants' federal and state antitrust claims together. HN10[
] The New 
Jersey Antitrust Act was ""patterned after the Sherman  [*25] Act, and [courts] have previously acknowledged the significance of 
federal antitrust decisions in the interpretation of our State antitrust law."" Monmouth Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., 
102 N.J. 485, 494, 509 A.2d 161 (1986); Cosmetic Gallery, Inc. v. Schoeneman Corp., 495 F.3d 46, 50-51 (3d Cir. 2007). 
Indeed, the Act itself requires that it be construed in harmony with federal antitrust laws. See N.J.S.A. § 56:9-18. "
92,8," The  [*30] Court has determined that Defendants failed to adequately plead (1) the definition of the relevant geographic market, 
and (2) the basis for inferring that there is a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power in said market. See Sections 
III.C(1)-(2), infra. Accordingly, the Court need not assess Plaintiffs' argument regarding Defendants' alleged failure to plead 
antitrust injury. "
93,9," For example, Defendants assert that their ""designation of the relevant geographic market as the United States"" is proper 
because ""the unfair actions  [*33] taken by Dicar, and the impact of those actions on competitors, stem from Dicar's unlawful and 
bad-faith assertion of two United States Patents."" See Defendants' Brief in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss (""Def. 
Opp.""), at 9."
93,10," The fact that Max Dura has not gained a significant share of the market does not alone demonstrate that there are barriers to 
entry--the fact that it has a U.S. presence indicates the opposite. See Korkala v. Allpro Imaging, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
70727, *16-17 (D.N.J. August 12, 2009) (unpublished) (""Korkala has not set forth facts sufficient to demonstrate that the Scanx 
System is unique. In fact, Korkala has inconsistently provided that Logos Imaging, LLC, FUJI NDT…are all companies that 
manufacture products in 'competition' with the Scanx System."") "

] To prevail on its antitrust  [*36] claim, Defendants must established that ""(1) that the defendant has engaged in 
predatory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving 
monopoly power"" in the relevant market. Spectrum Sports, 506 U.S. at 456; see Dicar, Inc. v. Stafford Corrugated Prods., 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52245, at *21-22 (D.N.J. June 22, 2009). The dispute, here, is with respect to the third element. See id."
94,12," Plaintiffs assert that ""Dicar's claimed exclusive licenses under Robud's patents enhance Dicar's market power while also 
raising barriers to entry in the relevant market."" Id. P 16."
94,13, Robud and Dicar acknowledge that Dicar controls more than 50% of the market for die-cutter blankets. Id. P 19.
94,14," The only allegation indicating that any market player was restricted or removed from the market is Defendants' contention that 
""[upon] information and belief, when Alan Kirkpatrick, Jr. developed a diecutter blanket to compete with Dicar, Dicar initiated a 
lawsuit against Mr. Kirkpatrick[; and o]n information and belief, although Mr. Kirkpatrick prevailed in that lawsuit, the resulting 
litigation expenses made it impossible for him to continue to develop and market his blanket."" Id. P 24. "
96,15," The Court will not repeat the analysis above, however, to summarize: the patent applicants initially claimed a locking member 
wherein ""said [locking] member includ[ed] compressible means for compressive interference engagement with said channel."" 
After rejection for lack of clarity, the applicants claimed ""compressible means coupled to the locking member."" Defendants 
assert that this was a statement by the applicants that the locking member/compressible means were initially one unit, and then 
the applicant modified their claims to indicate that the two elements are separate structural units.  [*44] The Court disagreed and 
determined that under these circumstances, the locking member and compressible means do not have to be two structurally 
distinct units to be ""coupled"" to each other. See Section II, supra "

103,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3. 
104,1," Because we affirm the district court's dismissal on this ground, we need not and do not consider Flexsys's contention that

pertinent to the summary judgment. "
118,1," The Court finds persuasive Judge Tinder's reconciliation of Kopko, Freidline, and similar authorities. See Trinity Homes LLC v. 
Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., No. 1:04-CV-1920, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24370, 2007 WL 1021825, at *4-7 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 30, 2007)."
118,2," This offense also includes an oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or 
organization, but GBS and Larry Behling focus on the aspect of the offense related to disparaging goods, products, or services. "
119,3," In discussing issues related to Westfield's duty to indemnify, GBS and Larry Behling provide additional indications of their 
theory for how Westfield's duty to defend is triggered. They state: [T]o determine if Westfield is obligated to indemnify GBS[] or Behling under its policy, it must first be ascertained whether 
GBS[] or Behling is legally obligated to pay any damages arising out of the lowering  [*25] in esteem or discrediting (i.e., 
disparagement) of Gariup's goods, products or services that were offered to be performed under Gariup's bid to the owner 
of the project. Such a determination necessarily involves adjudicating whether GBS[] or Behling are responsible for alleged statements 
concerning Gariup's bid that may have caused Gariup's bid to be rejected by the owner, or that caused the owner to accept 
GBS[]'s bid over that of Gariup's bid. (GBS Resp. Br. & Br. in Supp. 17, DE 21.) "
123,4," GBS and Larry Behling cite a number of Indiana Court of Appeals and Seventh Circuit opinions in support of their view that 
personal and advertising injury coverage is triggered because, in their view, the Gariup Complaint comes within the 
defamation/disparagement offense. However, the cases cited by GBS and Larry Behling are distinguishable from this case in 
important respects that render the holdings and reasoning in those cases inapplicable here. Some cases are distinguishable 
because they involved different offenses from the defamation/disparagement offense at issue in this case. See, e.g., Stroh 
Brewing Co., 127 F.3d at 566-68 (finding a duty to defend under personal injury or advertising injury provision if caused by an 
offense of humiliation or discrimination, which was found to include alleged price discrimination,  [*43] which was alleged in the 
underlying complaint); Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. La Oasis, Inc., No. 2:04-CV-174, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43565, 2005 WL 
1313684, at *5-10 (N.D. Ind. May 26, 2005) (analyzing advertising injury coverage based upon offenses of misappropriation of 
advertising ideas or style of doing business and infringement of copyright, title, or slogan); Audiology Found. of Am., 745 N.E.2d 
at 306-08 (finding a duty to defend under advertising injury provision based upon the offense of misappropriating advertising 
ideas or style of doing business, not the defamation/disparagement offense). Other cases are distinguishable because the facts 
alleged in the underlying complaints in those cases involved allegations of defamation and disparaging statements. See, e.g., 
Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Eastern Atl. Ins. Co., 260 F.3d 742, 744-45 (7th Cir. 2001) (finding a duty to defend under coverage 
involving the defamation/disparagement offense because of allegations of the underlying counterclaim referenced a letter that 
expressed concern over a particular person's character, suggested defamation by false notification and disparagement of 
services, and charged tortious interference with an agreement); Tews Funeral Home, Inc. v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 832 F.2d 1037, 
1040-41 (7th Cir. 1987)  [*44] (per curiam) (finding a duty to defend under personal injury and advertising offense coverage in a 
case alleging federal and state antitrust claims in addition to common law business torts including claims that the insured 
conspired to make false, misleading, and defamatory statements disparaging plaintiffs' products and services and wilfully 
disparaged goods, services, or business of plaintiffs in advertisements); Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. OSI Indus., 831 N.E.2d 192, 199 
(Ind. Ct. App. 2005) (finding a duty to defend under personal injury provision that included the defamation/disparagement 
offense because the underlying complaint alleged that the insureds disparaged a particular product, technology, and ownership 
of the product or technology; North Vermillion Cmty. Sch. Corp., 665 N.E.2d at 634-35 (finding a duty to defend under personal 
injury coverage when policy provided coverage for the publication or utterance of a libel or slander or of other defamatory or 
disparaging material and when underlying complaint alleged humiliation, embarrassment, and damages to reputation caused by 
defendants' conduct, which included impugning plaintiff's good reputation, harassing plaintiff, subjecting  [*45] plaintiff to ridicule 
and humiliation, making derogatory evaluations, and alleging incompetency and neglect of duty by plaintiff). "
131,1," Neither party has pointed the Court to evidence that Schubert actually made this statement. However, as the Defendants do 
not contest the issue, the Court will accept the allegation in the Complaint as true for summary judgment purposes. "
132,2," The claims are numbered here as they are in the body of the Complaint, rather than on the cover page. "
134,3," The Court  [**15] also notes that the plaintiffs in Schachar did allege a dual role: ""Plaintiffs say that the Academy is in the grip 
of professors and practitioners who favor conservative treatment, forever calling for more research (the better to justify the 
academics' request for grants)."" 870 F.2d at 399. "
135,4," The parties do not dispute that swimsuits are ""Specialized Equipment"" and that the Olympic Trials and Olympic Games are 
""Protected Competition."""
135,5," However, TYR points out that an extra swimmer was added as an alternate, even though she had not qualified based on her 
time at the Trials. (SGI Speedo P 40.)"
135,6," TYR offers the argument that Schubert could influence who reached the wall first through psychological means by ""planting in 
swimmers'  [**19] minds that the [Speedo suit] is superior and that other suits are inferior."" (Opp'n to Speedo 7-8.) This 
supposed psychological trick does not constitute coercion in any sense of the word."
135,7, Burden was sponsored by TYR and Sutton was an amateur who chose to wear TYR.
135,8, A swimmer for the men's open water team was also sponsored by TYR. (Zimmer Depo. at 113:16-21.) 
136,9, Murphy  [**22] wore a TYR and D'Innocenzo wore a Blue 70 suit. (King Depo. at 19:3-4.)
136,10, The record is silent on whether D'Innocenzo stuck with the Speedo suit.
136,11, This testimony presents an obvious hearsay problem and may not be admissible at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).
136,12," In any case, Murphy disobeyed Schubert and wore his personal TYR cap for the remainder for the meet, apparently without 
punishment. (King Depo. at 55:4-19.) "
137,13," The parties dispute whether Schubert was referring to an advantage the LZR Racer had over the old Speedo suit, the FS Pro, 
or over all suits currently in the marketplace."
137,14," The swimmers sometimes receive bonuses from sponsors for being chosen to the relay team. (See, e.g., TYR Exs. 18 at 18, 
19 at Ex. A.)"
137,15," The combination of resources and expertise of USA Swimming and Speedo is likely to help innovation in swimsuit technology, 
thereby benefitting the consumer. "
138,16," ""USA Swimming and Schubert misread the [Court's order on the motions to dismiss] (and the referenced authorities), and they 
fundamentally mischaracterize--i.e., narrow the focus--of the allegations and evidence establishing defendants' coordinated anti-
competitive conduct. USA Swimming and Schubert try to cast TYR's claims as limited to the 2008 Olympic team and limited to 
the rules regarding swimwear of choice. However, the anticompetitive conduct shown by TYR is much broader: it predates the 
Olympics by more than a year and encompasses  [**29] behavior unrelated to team selection and technical equipment rules. Put 
in summary judgment parlance, USA Swimming and Schubert fail to meet their burden of negating an essential element of 
TYR's claims or demonstrating an absence of evidence supporting them because they miscast them in the narrow range they 
think falls within the 'undisputed evidence.'"" (Opp'n to USA Swimming 13.) "
139,17," Speedo, citing Morgan, objects to Furniss's declaration on the grounds that it is impermissible lay witness testimony on the 
technical subject of the relevant geographic market. See 924 F.2d at 1490. This objection is overruled because Furniss testifies 
only as to factual characteristics of the geographic market, which is within his competency  [**35] as an industry veteran. He 
does not give a conclusory opinion on market definition, unlike the witnesses in Morgan. See id. "
140,18," At the elite level, most swimmers are sponsored by a swimwear company and do not purchase their own suits. "
141,19, The Court does not reach the question of whether Schubert's statement can be proven literally false. 
142,20," It is worth noting that it appears that TYR terminated Vendt--not vice versa. (See TYR Ex. 45.) TYR's action was predicated on 
Vendt's choice to wear a competitor's suit, but he appears to have had a unilateral contractual right to do so. (Speedo Ex. 283 § 
3.5.)"
142,21," Vendt's testimony is unclear as to whether the March 2008 calls were with TYR or Schubert; Vendt appears to have been 
confused by the question. (See Vendt Depo. at 149:2-12.). However, the Court accepts TYR's interpretation for summary 
judgment purposes. "
143,22," This is especially true given that Schubert did not use his discretionary  [**45] fund to pay Vendt until April 2008, roughly three 
months after TYR canceled his endorsement deal. (Schubert Depo. at 218:22-219:3.) And although Vendt claimed to have a 
Speedo deal in March 2008, (Vendt Depo., Ex. 295), Speedo did not propose a sponsorship deal until May 2008, four months 
after the end of his TYR deal, and, because of this lawsuit, no deal was ever reached. (Supp. Isaac Decl. PP 4-6.)"
143,23," ""I do believe that one time over a Thanksgiving [Vendt and his girlfriend, Kim] . . . wanted to try to roast a turkey for the first 
time in their lives,  [**46] and they brought a turkey over. And my wife helped them, and even went back to their apartment to 
help them finish off cooking the turkey. I was not involved in that process, thank goodness."" (Issac Depo. 227:4-11 (emphasis 
added).) "
144,24," The combination of Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules results in a minimum 49-day 
motions cycle. "
147,1," Plaintiffs' FAC asserts that this Court's jurisdiction, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, rests on their FLSA claims. If Plaintiffs fail to 
state such claims, the  [*5] Court would lack federal-question subject matter jurisdiction over their action. "
148,2," Defendants also argue that, because Plaintiffs do not plead facts to support the allegations concerning Defendants' failure to 
pay a minimum wage or meal premiums, Plaintiffs' UCL claim must be dismissed. However, as noted above, Plaintiffs state a 
UCL claim based on their allegations that Defendants failed to compensate them for overtime. "
152,1," Although both an original and amended motion were filed, the parties and the Magistrate Judge treated the amended motion as 
superseding the original motion. [Doc. 22; Doc. 28; Doc. 29]."
152,2," Plaintiff Fann sought administrative review but neither of the other two plaintiffs did so. [Doc. 1, at 5]. "
153,3," That statute provides that ""district courts may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over [state law] claim[s] … if … the 
district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction[.]"" 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3)."
153,4," Since this matter is before the Court on a motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), which only pertains to the sufficiency of pleadings, 
there is no evidentiary issue before the Court, and thus no further evidence was or could have been presented. "
159,1," Rohr is identified in the complaint as ""John Roach,"" but both parties refer to him as James Rohr in  [*3] their memoranda of 
law."
159,2," The parties divergently spell the name of this corporate entity as ""For Your Kids, Inc."" and ""Four Your Kids, Inc."" I adhere to the 
former, which is the spelling in the official caption of this case and in the answer filed by Fyk."
159,3," The complaint, which runs to 143 pages, is of a kind that should be firmly discouraged. Among other things, the complaint (1) is 
filled with needless repetition and irrelevancies, (2) alleges violations of multiple nonexistent statutes, (3) pleads the existence of 
diversity jurisdiction even though it lists both plaintiffs and numerous defendants as Pennsylvania residents, and (4) is larded 
with footnotes to legal authorities better found in a memorandum of law. While none of these infirmities bears on the merits of 
the arguments made in defendants' motions to dismiss, both this court and all parties to this litigation would have been better 
served by a shorter, plainer statement of plaintiffs' claims. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)."
159,4," Fyk has filed a pro se answer, which he seeks to submit on behalf of both himself and For Your Kids. See Docket No. 11. 
Normally, this court would strike the answer insofar as it purports to be submitted by  [*4] a pro se litigant on behalf of a 
corporation. See, e.g., Penn Graphics Equip. Co. v. Globaltec Innovations, Corp., No. 06-cv-3247, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79149, 
2006 WL 3144398, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 30, 2006) (striking all filings made on behalf of a corporation by a non-lawyer). Because 
of the view I take of this case, however, the propriety of Fyk's answer is moot."
159,5," For convenience, I will use ""defendants"" to refer to the moving defendants. "
160,6," Plaintiff Stacy Shipp is mentioned primarily with reference to both of the loss of consortium claims in the complaint. See Compl. 
PP 695, 697. "
161,7," Plaintiffs failed to attach the exhibits to the originally-filed version of the complaint. Plaintiffs did, however, petition to 
supplement the complaint with exhibits a week thereafter, and no defendant has objected to that request. The petition will 
therefore be granted as uncontested pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(c)."
161,8," Given that the complaint alleges that PNC subsequently released the properties, there is no way that this court could, at 
present, render the state courts' judgment on intervention ""ineffectual."" "
163,9," Jordan differs factually from this case in certain ways -- it (1) concerned personal and not real property, see 20 F.3d at 1258, 
(2) occurred before certain changes were made to Pennsylvania's confessed judgment procedures, see Compl. PP 274-96, and 
(3) did not concern a third party to the confessed judgment action.  [*18] But the rules for confessed judgments of real property 
concern the same two steps described in Jordan, the rules changes described in the complaint are not relevant to the core 
procedures held by Jordan to be pertinent to defendants' status as private or state actors, and while plaintiffs' interest in the 
proceedings may differ from the interests of a judgment debtor, that distinction is irrelevant to the degree of state involvement in 
the alleged constitutional deprivations."
163,10," This court may take judicial notice of appropriate items without converting defendants' motions into motions for summary 
judgment. See, e.g., Lord v. Erie County, No. 08-cv-213, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 308, 2010 WL 56095, at *6 n.10 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 
5, 2010) (quoting Pryor v. NCAA, 288 F.3d 548, 560 (3d Cir. 2002)). "
165,11," I also note that Fyk and other debtors, as the direct victims of any anticompetitive activity, would be better suited to challenge 
any antitrust violations by the defendants. The fourth factor of the standing test thus also weighs against plaintiffs in this case. "
166,12," Further, the Court of Common Pleas, in an opinion attached to the complaint, held that Tucker's filings in that court contained 
no ""false averments."" Compl. Ex. 4, at 2. "
167,13," Plaintiffs do not allege that they suffered financial harm because William Shipp subordinated his claims against Fyk to those 
against NBM. Even if the complaint included such allegations, however, it would be unclear how that particular harm was 
proximately caused by defendants' alleged RICO activities."
167,14," The complaint veers toward attempting to state claims on behalf of Shipp's bank in several places. The bank, however, is not a 
plaintiff in this action, and ""[t]hat an individual shareholder or employee may sustain harm incidental to the injury to [a] 
corporation does not confer [RICO] standing upon him."" Jordan v. Berman, 792 F. Supp. 380, 386 n.11 (E.D. Pa. 1992), vac'd in 
part on other grounds sub nom. Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O'Brien & Frankel, 20 F.3d 1250 (3d Cir. 1994). "
168,15," Count 25 of the complaint, which alleges a wire fraud violation, is pled as a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1342, not 18 U.S.C. § 
1343. Because § 1342 concerns sending and receiving mail under fictitious names, I assume that plaintiffs intended to list § 
1343 as the relevant statute. In any case, § 1342 also lacks a private right of action. See, e.g., Weiss v. Sawyer, 28 F. Supp. 2d 
1221, 1227 (W.D. Okla. 1997); Drance v. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, No. 96-cv-5729, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11361, 1997 WL 
442071, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 1997)."
168,16," Count 27 of the complaint actually refers to 18 U.S.C. § 876, which does not  [*39] exist. Because that count deals with the 
mailing of threatening communications, I assume that plaintiffs meant to plead a violation of § 876."
168,17," On its face, Count 16 attempts to plead a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1931, which does not exist. Both that count and 18 U.S.C. § 
1031 are, however, captioned ""major fraud against the United States,"" so I construe that count as attempting to state a violation 
of § 1031."
168,18," Because I reach this conclusion for the reasons given above, I will not address the numerous additional arguments presented 
in defendants' motions. "
169,19," Plaintiffs repeatedly assert that the other defendants used Fyk ""to enforce collections."" Compl. P 304(e); see also, e.g., id. P 
313. The complaint does not allege, however, that Fyk ever attempted to collect a debt from Shipp, and the communications 
 [*42] from Fyk to Shipp attached as exhibits also give no hint that Fyk was attempting to do so. See id. Exs. 1, 2, 7. A letter from 
Fyk to Shipp's counsel that is attached to the complaint is a settlement offer that asks, inter alia, that Shipp pay him ""$ 967 for 
materials and work to the property."" Id. Ex. 11. The courts in this circuit that have considered this question have determined that 
communications to a debtor's attorney do not fall within the ambit of the FDCPA. See, e.g., Wright v. Phelan, Hallinan & 
Schmieg, LLP, No. 09-cv-3538, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21977, 2010 WL 786536, at *4-*6 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 8, 2010) (citing further 
cases). Further, the letter to Shipp's counsel is manifestly not an attempt to collect any debt for the other defendants, and it is 
PNC's alleged collection attempts -- directly and via Tucker and Fyk -- that underpin plaintiffs' FDCPA claim."
169,20," In this regard, I note that plaintiff has not alleged that defendants have complete control over the state courts -- only that 
Pennsylvania's confessed judgment procedure is tainted. "
178,1," Section 2 claims are not brought against Defendant Apotex. See, e.g., Second Am. Compl. at P 132 (Case No. 1:06-cv-163, 
Doc. 62). "
179,2," The Kroger Plaintiffs: The Kroger Co., Walgreen Co., Eckerd Corporation, Maxi Drug, Inc. d/b/a Brooks Pharmacy, Albertson's,

179,8, Four types of certifications exist: 
180,," (1) ""Paragraph I"" certification: no patent information has been filed with the FDA; (2) ""Paragraph II"" certification: the patent has expired; (3) ""Paragraph III"" certification: the date the patent will expire in the future, or; (4) ""Paragraph IV"" certification: the patent is invalid or not infringed by the generic product, See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(I-IV). "
181,9," In this case, Plaintiffs assert that because of its alleged omission and misrepresentations to the PTO, Sanofi had reason to 
believe that the '265 patent was invalid as anticipated by prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102, for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 
103, and under the doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting. "
182,10," The facts of the March Agreement are alleged in each of Plaintiffs' complaints, "
185,11," In Hodges, the Sixth Circuit Court affirmed the district court's dismissal for failure to allege an antitrust injury and stated: 
""[b]ecause plaintiffs did not allege, nor could they, that the illegal  [**27] antitrust conduct was a necessary predicate to their 
antitrust injury or that defendants could exclude plaintiffs only by engaging in the antitrust violation, it was appropriate to dismiss 
the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)."" Hodges, 26 F.3d at 39 (emphasis added). "
191,12," See, e.g., Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2009 (defining fact as ""a thing done""; ""the quality of being actual""; ""something 
that has actual existence""; or ""an actual occurrence""). "
205,1," Plaintiffs have  [**21] submitted extensive evidence in support of their allegations that defendants engaged in a price-fixing 
conspiracy. This evidence has all been submitted under seal, and is found at the following: Zahid Decl. 95-103; Supp. Zahid 
Decl. Ex. 8-15. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, as plaintiffs have submitted well over 100 exhibits, all under seal, in 
support of their motion."
205,2," Epson Imaging Devices Corporation is not named as a defendant in the Indirect-Purchaser Plaintiffs' Second Consolidated 
Amended Complaint. This entity is named as a defendant in the Third Amended Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' Consolidated

205,3," In addition, several individual executives from LG Phillips and Chunghwa Pictures Tubes, Ltd., have pled guilty to criminal 
violations of the Sherman Act. See CR 09-44 SI, CR 09-45 SI and CR 09-437 SI. "
206,4," The ""indirect purchaser states"" are Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, 
South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. "
210,5," Plaintiffs concede that Mr. Fisher lacks standing because his February 10, 2007 purchase is outside the redefined class period. 
Mr. Fisher is a resident of North Carolina. Second Amd. Consol. Compl. ¶ 45. There is an additional named plaintiff from North 
Carolina, Donna Jeanne Flanagan, whose adequacy and typicality defendants do not challenge. "
215,6," The parties also dispute whether the FTAIA must be interpreted consistently with state law such that state law could not reach 
conduct that is barred by the FTAIA. These legal questions can be decided after, or in conjunction with, determinations about the 
applicability of the FTAIA to plaintiffs' claims. "
217,7," According to Dr. Netz, a perfectly competitive market ""is one in which there are many buyers and sellers, such that no 
individual buyer or seller can affect prices in any significant manner; there is a homogenous good; there is perfect information; 
and there is free entry and exit."" Netz Errata Decl. at 73 n.210."
217,8," Dr. Netz states that ""constant costs"" means that the industry can grow to any size without driving up the costs of inputs. Netz 
Errata Decl. at 73."
217,9," Dr. Netz also states, ""That the LCD product manufacturing industry is highly competitive is not inconsistent with Plaintiffs' 
claims that Defendants fixed the price of LCD panels and LCD products. By fixing the price of panels, the Defendants in effect 
are fixing the price of products because product prices are a function of panel prices; an increase in the price of LCD panels 
leads to an increase in the price of LCD products, as discussed in Section VI.D [of the Errata Declaration]."" Id. at 77 n.224."

237,9," The availability of a private right of action for unfair methods of competition in Hawai'i has changed over the last several years. 
In Ai v. Frank Huff Agency, Ltd., 61 Haw. 607, 612, 607 P.2d 1304, 1308-09 (1980), overruled by Robert's Hawai'i Sch. Bus, Inc.

Co., 63 Haw. 289, 300-01, 627 P.2d 260, 268-69 (1981), overruled by Robert's Hawai'i, this court held that HRS § 480-2 
afforded plaintiffs a private right of action for unfair methods of competition. In Robert's Hawai'i, this court overruled Ai and Island 
Tobacco to the extent that they held there existed such a private right and instead  [***13] held that ""there is no private claim for 
relief under HRS § 480-13 for unfair methods of competition in violation of HRS § 480-2."" 91 Hawai'i at 252, 982 P.2d at 881. 
Thereafter, in 2002, the legislature amended HRS § 480-2 to add subsection (e) which makes clear there is such a private right. 
2002 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 229, § 2 at 916-17. In Hawai'i Med. Ass'n v. Hawai'i Med. Services Ass'n, 113 Hawai'i 77, 107, 148 
P.3d 1179, 1209 (2006), this court held that ""[w]e do not believe the amendment 'overruled' Robert's Hawai'i . . . but instead

recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."
238,11," Employees also argue that a limited interpretation of ""any person"" so as to exclude Employees ""risks violation the equal 
protection clause of the Hawaii Constitution (Article I, Section 5) [***15]  because it requires the court to deny the protection of 
Chapter 480 to employees, who may be [unfair methods of competition] victims similarly situated to other 'persons' receiving 
protection under the statute, without a reasonable basis."" Because we conclude that Employees fall within the definition of ""any 
person,"" we do not"
238,12," Employees also contend that Employees can enforce HRS § 481B-14 through HRS §§ 388-6, 10 and 11. However, this 
argument will not be addressed because it is beyond the scope of the certified question."
238,13," Four Seasons also argues that if HRS § 481B-14 ""was intended to create a wage claim for employees, it is strikingly - if not 
unconstitutionally - vague. Among other things, it does not specify which employees should be paid the service charge as tip 
income[,]"" and ""allows the employer to pick any employee to receive the monies in any amount."" This argument, however, does not relate to the issue of whether or not employees have standing under HRS § 480-2(e) to bring 
a claim for damages for a violation of HRS § 481B-14, but instead relates the merits  [***17] of such a claim. Accordingly, we do 
not address it here."
238,14," At some points in its Answering Brief, Four Seasons also includes 480-2(e) is limited to businesses, competitors, consumers 
or ""other market participants."" At oral argument, counsel for Four Seasons argued that ""businesses"" may be broadly interpreted

explain what other entities may be considered to be ""market participants,"" see MP3: Oral Argument, Hawai'i Supreme Court, at

240,15," In support of the bill, Senator Matsunaga stated that the bill ""amends the antitrust and unfair competition law to allow any 
person to bring a lawsuit for enforcement."" 2002 Senate Journal, at 626 (statement of Sen. Matsunaga) (emphasis added). 
Senator Hogue, who opposed the bill, expressed similar views about its scope in a subsequent debate: ""This bill, if enacted, 
would open the floodgates and allow anybody to file such a suit, no matter how frivolous."" 2002 Senate Journal, at 724 
(statement of Sen. Hogue) (emphasis added)."
240,16," The committee report states that: Your Committees find that only the Attorney General may bring an action to enforce the antitrust, or unfair methods of 
competition law. This restriction was the result of a 1999 Supreme Court interpretation of section 480-2, Hawaii Revised 
Statutes. However, the Attorney General does not have the resources to investigate and litigate all price-fixing claims. This 
bill amends the law to clearly give businesses and consumers the right to enforce the law if the Attorney General declines 
to commence an action based on the claim. H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 1118, in 2002 House Journal, at 1665. Thus, the report was focusing on the question of whether persons other than the Attorney General should be able to bring suit, 
rather than providing an exclusive list of which persons would be able to bring suit if the statute was amended. "
242,17," Employees argue that ""[t]he title to the Act is pivotal in dismantling Defendants' claim that the law was not meant to benefit 
employees because the Hawaii Constitution provides at Article III, Section 14 that: 'No law shall be passed except by bill. Each 
law shall embrace but one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.'"" However, although we believe the title is instructive in 
that it appears to reflect the legislature's concern that employees may not always be receiving the service charges imposed by 
their employers, we do not believe it is dispositive of the issue of whether the legislature intended to afford Employees standing 
to sue for HRS § 481B-14 violations. "
243,18," Specifically, the Committee Report notes that: The [DLIR] expressed concerns that the bill, as drafted, would delete the tip credit in its entirety thereby disallowing 
employers from taking any offset from the employees' wages. DLIR testified that since the current rules concerning tips and 
gratuities are in line with federal regulations, changing the definitions would cause a lot of confusion for both employers and 
employees. H. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 479-00, in 2000 House Journal, at 1155. The ILWU Local 142 also expressed concerns that 
""changing the definition of tips would cause much confusion[.]"" Id. "
244,19," Individual physicians also sued HMSA on similar grounds and the cases were consolidated on appeal. HMA, 113 Hawai'i at 
81, 148 P.3d at 1183. However, because this court's discussion regarding the requirements to sue under HRS §§ 480-2 and 
480-13 arose in the context of the HMA suit, we focus here solely on the issues pertaining to that suit."
244,20," HRS § 480-2(e) became effective on June 28, 2002. In HMA, this court held that § 2(e) cannot be applied retroactively 
because  [***41] ""[n]either the language of the statute itself nor the legislative history of the amendment give any expressed 
indication that the amendment should be applied retroactively."" HMA, 113 Hawai'i at 107, 148 P.3d at 1209. "
245,21," A fourth element--""a showing that the action is in the public interest or that the defendant is a merchant""--used to be required, 
but was eliminated by the 1987 amendment to HRS §§ 480-2 and -13. See HMA, 113 Hawai'i at 114 n.31, 148 P.3d at 1216 
n.31 (citing S. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 105, in 1987 Senate Journal, at 872)."
245,22," The majority opinion further stated that ""notwithstanding . . . our holding that the plaintiffs need not be 'competitors' of, or 'in 
competition' with, HMSA, the question remains whether the nature of the competition must be sufficiently alleged. Contrary to the 
dissent, we conclude that it does . . . ."" Id. at 111, 148 P.3d at 1213. Justice Acoba and Justice Nakayama, who concurred in the 
result, nevertheless characterized the majority's holding as requiring that plaintiffs be in competition with defendants and 
dissented on those grounds. Id. at 119, 148 P.3d at 1221 (Acoba, J. and Nakayama, J., dissenting) (""it is unnecessary to 
 [***43] allege, as the majority indicates, that HMSA and all the plaintiffs are in competition with each other for the same 
'customers.'""). However, the dissent agreed that something more than an unfair or deceptive act or practice must be alleged in 
order to bring a claim for unfair methods of competition. Id. (""In my view it is sufficient that 'unfair methods of competition' 
adversely impact the plaintiffs and allegations in that respect are made, beyond any allegations of unfair and deceptive acts or 
practices."")."
245,23," This court specifically stated that HMSA facilitates access to the dispensing of medical services, and the plaintiffs provide medical services directly. Thus, in 
our view, HMSA and the plaintiffs share the same goal or mission, i.e., ensuring that medical services are accessible to 
their ""customers."" Their success in meeting the common goal-and, in turn, ensuring the profitability of their respective 
businesses-is dependent upon their ability to effectively provide medical services to their customers, i.e., the patients. 
However, if HMSA engages in acts or practices that impede or interfere with physicians' ability to provide effective 
healthcare services to their patients and/or  [***44] create incentives for patients to look elsewhere for medical services-that 
is, to other participating physicians who may be reluctant to challenge HMSA or to non-participating physicians-such acts or 
practices can, if proven, constitute unfair methods of competition, notwithstanding the fact that the same conduct could also 
support a claim of unfair or deceptive acts or practices. HMA, 113 Hawai'i at 112-13, 148 P.3d at 1214-15."
245,24," This court held that HMA sufficiently alleged the ""nature of the competition"" by, for example, alleging in its complaint that:"
245,11," . . . . [HMSA's] conduct has adversely impacted, and continues to adversely impact, members of [HMSA's] plans by, 
among other things: (a) imposing financial hardships on, and in some cases threatening the continued viability of, the 
medical practices run by [the plaintiffs]; (b) threatening the continuity of care provided to patients by [the plaintiffs], as 
required by sound medical judgment; (c) requiring [the plaintiffs] to expend considerable resources seeking reimbursement 
that could otherwise be available to provide enhanced healthcare services to [HMSA's] plan members; (d) making it more "
246,," costly and difficult for [the plaintiffs]  [***45] to maintain and enhance the availability and quality of care that all patients 
receive; and (e) increasing the costs of rendering healthcare services in Hawaii as a result of the additional costs incurred 
and considerable effort expended by HMA members in seeking reimbursement from HMSA for services rendered. . . ."
246,26," . HMSA dominates the enrollee market in Hawaii with over 65% of Hawaii's population enrolled in one of HMSA's plans. 
In this regard, HMSA is the largest provider of fee-for-service insurance in the State with more than 90% of the market and 
is the second largest HMO provider in the State. Similarly, HMSA dominates the physician market, with approximately 90% 
of Hawaii's physicians participating in HMSA's networks."
246,27," . It is through such market dominance that HMSA is able to dictate the terms and amount of reimbursement HMA 
physicians will receive. HMA, 113 Hawai'i at 112, 148 P.3d at 1214 (emphasis and brackets in original)."
246,25," Ai's suggestion that allegations of ""competitive injury"" are the requirement in HMA that a plaintiff allege the ""nature of the 
competition"" in order to plead an unfair methods of competition claim under HRS § 480-2(e). However, when this passage from 
Ai is viewed in  [***47] the context of the facts the case, it is apparent that this court was explaining that injury to ""business or 
property"" means that a private plaintiff does not need to allege that he or she suffered an injury to his or her business property or 
in a business activity, but rather can allege that he or she suffered an injury to personal property. Ai, 61 Haw. at 614, 607 P.2d at 
1310. Moreover, Ai involved alleged unfair or deceptive acts or practices, not unfair methods of competition, id. at 611, 607 P.2d 
at 1308, and therefore this court did not address the requirements to properly plead an unfair methods of competition claim. "
247,26," The dissent suggests that the present case is distinguishable from HMA because HMA involved an unfair methods of 
competition claim based on claim, and that the requirement in HMA that the plaintiffs allege the nature of the competition was ""to 
 [***50] preserve the distinction"" between the two claims. Dissenting Opinion at 15. The dissent therefore argues that because 
HRS § 481B-4 deems a violation of chapter 481 to be both an unfair method of competition and an unfair or deceptive act or 
practice under HRS § 480-2, the need for distinction between the two claims as articulated in HMA is not present in the instant 
case. Dissenting Opinion at 16-18. However, this court in HMA did not indicate that a plaintiff alleging an unfair method of competition under HRS § 480-2(e) must 
plead the nature of the competition merely so there is a distinction between claims of unfair or deceptive acts or practices and 
claims of unfair methods of competition. While recognizing that such distinction is necessary, this court further indicated that ""the 
existence of the competition is what distinguishes a claim of unfair or deceptive acts or practices from a claim of unfair methods 
of competition."" HMA, 113 Hawai'i at 112, 148 P.3d at 1214. In other words, this court indicated that the pleading requirement is 
based on the differences in the nature of the underlying causes of action. Therefore, HMA's holding is equally applicable to the 
instant case."
247,27," Thus, we respectfully disagree with the dissent's suggestion that the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleged the nature of the 
competition. Dissenting Opinion at 36-38. In HMA, after recognizing that the standard of review for a motion to dismiss or motion 
for judgment on the pleadings requires this court to accept the allegations in the complaint as true and construe the allegations 
in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we held that this standard does not relieve plaintiffs from the requirement of pleading 
the nature of the competition in the complaint itself. See HMA, 113 Hawai'i at 113, 148 P.3d at 1215 (""In  [***52] sum, we hold 
that any person may bring a claim of unfair methods of competition based upon conduct that could also support a claim of unfair 
or deceptive acts or practices as long as the nature of the competition is sufficiently alleged in the complaint"") (emphasis added). 
In, we concluded that HMA sufficiently alleged the nature of the anti-competitive effect HMSA's alleged actions would have on 
the marketplace for healthcare services in Hawai'i and that HMA's injury directly resulted from these unfair methods of 
competition. See supra, section II-C and notes 23 "
251,28," HRS § 443B-3(a) (1993) provides: No collection agency shall collect or attempt to collect any money or any other forms of indebtedness alleged to be due and 
owing from any person who registering under this chapter."
251,29," HRS § 480-1 (1993) defines ""consumer"" as: ""a natural person who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, 
purchases, attempts to purchase, or is solicited to purchase goods or services or who commits money, property, or services in a 
personal investment."" Flores, 117 Hawai'i at 162-63, 177 P.3d at 350-51. "
252,30," Amicus Curiae Rossetto additionally cites to Fuller v. Pacific Medical Collections, Inc., 78 Hawai'i 213, 891 P.2d 300 (App. 
1995), in which the Intermediate Court of Appeals held that although the Director of the Department of Commerce and 
Consumer Affairs was designated to enforce HRS chapter 443, a consumer could maintain an action under HRS § 480-2(d) for 
an unfair or deceptive act or practice claim because HRS § 443B-20 provided that violations of chapter 443 constitute unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices. Id. at 218, 891 P.2d at 305. However, because Fuller involved only claims  [***70] of unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices pursuant to HRS § 480-2(d), it does not address the distinct issue of whether Employees must allege 
the nature of the competition in order to maintain an unfair methods of competition claim under HRS § 480-2(e)."
252,31," Without expressing an opinion regarding its sufficiency, we note that in their Reply Brief, Employees described how they would 
characterize the ""nature of the competition"" if they were required to allege it: [E]ven if there were some requirement that the unfair method of competition be asserted, the remedy would not be 
dismissal, but at worst, to allow the plaintiffs to allege such ""unfair method"". Indeed, it is obvious that if one hotel obeys the 
laws and remits the entire service charge to the employees  [***71] serving at the banquet and another hotel/competitor 
skims the service charge and keeps 4-5% for itself without disclosure, the hotel acting unlawfully can undercut its stated 
price for the banquet knowing that it will be receiving improper gains from the misleading description of its service charge. 
This is clearly a Amicus Curiae Rossetto similarly states that: In this case, hotels and restaurants that do not inform customers that they are keeping the imposed service charge and not 
paying it to employees gain a clear competitive advantage because they have deceived their patrons. They are able to 
""reduce"" the published cost of their food and beverages in order to entice patronage away from their honest competitors 
who either pay out the service charge to employees or frankly inform patrons that management is keeping all or a part of 
the service charge (thereby telling patrons that they will still have to tip employees). "
253,32," When interpreting HRS § 480-2(e), Amicus Curiae Rossetto urges this court to only consider federal interpretations of section 
5(a)(1) of the FTCA  [***74] pursuant to HRS § 480-2(b), and not interpretations of section 4 of the Clayton Act. Specifically, 
Amicus Curie Rossetto argues that section 5(a)(1) of the FTCA has been interpreted in FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 
U.S. 233, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972), to empower the FTC to define unfair practices to include practices without anti-
competitive effects. However, this argument is misplaced, because as discussed above, interpretations of section 5(a)(1) of the 
FTCA are of limited relevance in analyzing standing requirements for HRS § 480-2(e) since the FTCA does not have a 
comparable private right of action. See supra, note 8."
253,33," Four Seasons argues that because § 480-13(a) is similar to section 4 of the Clayton Act, this court should examine relevant 
federal judicial interpretations of that statute pursuant to HRS § 480-3, citing, for example, to Associated General Contractors of 
California v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) (hereinafter ""AGC""). 
In AGC, the Supreme Court discussed the concept of standing under section 4 of the Clayton Act to sue for violations of federal 
antitrust law, and noted that standing in the antitrust context is more limited than the broad ""any person"" language of the statute 
would suggest. Id. at 534-35. The Supreme Court identified a number of factors to assist courts in determining whether a plaintiff has established federal 
antitrust standing. The first factor, which was described by the Court in AGC as the ""nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury[,]"" and 
which considered whether the injury is the ""type that Congress sought to redress,"" AGC, 459 U.S. at 538 (citation 
 [***76] omitted), has since been referred to as ""antitrust injury,"" meaning an ""injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended 
to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful[,]"" see, e.g., Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum 
Co., 495 U.S. 328, 334, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990); Eichorn v. AT&T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 140 (3d Cir. 2001). 
The other factors identified by the Court in AGC are: the ""directness or indirectness of the asserted injury,"" the ""speculative 
measure of harm,"" the ""risk of duplicate recoveries"" or ""danger of complex apportionment of damages"" and ""the existence of 
more direct victims of the alleged [violation]."" AGC, 459 U.S. at 538-545; see also Atlantic Richfield, 495 U.S. at 334; American 
Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co., 190 F.3d 1051, 1054 (9th Cir. 1999). Other than recognizing that federal courts have consistently applied the concept of antitrust injury when determining if a plaintiff 
has federal antitrust standing, this court has not expressly applied the AGC analysis to unfair methods of competition claims 
arising under HRS chapter 480. Robert's Hawai'i, 91 Hawai'i at 254 n.31, 982 P.2d at 883 n.31; HMA, 113 Hawai'i at 114 n.30, "
254,148," P.3d at 1216 n.30. Since  [***77] we have decided, based on our analysis of HRS § 480-13(a) and Hawai'i caselaw, that 
Employees must allege the nature of the competition, we do not need to consider the applicability of the AGC approach in order 
to answer the certified question."
254,34," Section 7 of the Clayton Act proscribes mergers whose effect ""may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a 
monopoly."" Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 485."
254,35," It  [***80] is important to note that Atlantic Richfield involved a judicially recognized per se antitrust violation, whereas the per 
se violation of Hawai'i antitrust law in this case is established by HRS § 481B-4. However, this distinction has no bearing on the 
underlying analysis for the antitrust injury requirement in the circumstances here, where we have concluded that the legislature 
did not intend to modify the causation requirements imposed by HRS § 480-13. Thus, it makes no difference whether the courts 
or the legislature have ""deemed"" certain action to be anti-competitive, because the purpose of the antitrust injury requirement is 
to ensure that the plaintiff's alleged injury stems from this anti-competitive aspect, rather than some pro-competitive or neutral 
effect of the defendant's antitrust violation. "
256,1," Plaintiffs-Appellants are Daryl Dean Davis, Mark Apana, Elizabeth Valdez Kyne, Earl Tanaka, Thomas Perryman, and Deborah 
Scarfone, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, and are hereinafter  [***86] referred to collectively, as 
""Plaintiffs."""
256,2," The federal standard of review is the same. We review de novo the district court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss pursuant to [Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
Rule] 12(b)(6). ASW v. Oregon, 424 F.3d 970, 974 (9th Cir. 2005). We accept as true all well-pleaded facts in the complaint 
and construe them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id. A claim should be dismissed only if it appears 
beyond doubt that the plaintiff can establish no set of facts under which relief could be granted. Pacheco v. United States, 
220 F.3d 1126, 1129 (9th Cir. 2000). Watson v. Weeks, 436 F.3d 1152, 1157 (9th Cir. 2006). "
258,3," It should be noted that, at oral argument, Defendants conceded that portions of the service charge were not distributed to the 
servers as tip income and that notice of this practice was not given to the customers to whom the service charge was applied. 
Defendants also asserted that  [***93] this practice has since been changed, and the required HRS § 481B-14 notice given. "
259,4," As noted at oral argument, ""consumers"" and other ""persons"" may also sue, and an equitable apportionment of damages may 
be required in any particular case. "
260,5," The majority states that it declines to address this matter because it ""does not relate to the issue of whether or not employees 
have standing under HRS § 480-2(e) to bring a claim for damages for a violation of HRS § 481B-14, but instead relates to the 
merits of such a claim."" Majority opinion at 11 n.13. However, the certified question states that ""[t]he [c]ourt's phrasing of the 
question should not restrict the [Hawai'i Supreme Court's] consideration of the problems and issues involved."" Certified question 
 [***98] at 5 (citing Allstate Ins. Co. v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., 137 F.3d 634, 637 (9th Cir. 1998). Moreover, this court is not 
required to limit itself to the question certified. See Richardson v. City & County of Honolulu, 76 Hawai'i 46, 53, 868 P.2d 1193, 
1200 (1994) (addressing the issue of whether the City of Honolulu had authority to enact an ordinance despite the fact that the 
question was ""not expressly placed in issue by the federal court's certified question""). Also, whether Plaintiffs have ""standing"" in 
this case is substantially related to whether they are included in the category of employees described in HRS § 481B-14, a 
proposition Defendants argue is constitutionally barred. Finally, the constitutionality of the statute as disputed between the 
parties is obviously germane to the viability of the proceeding in federal court. Thus, it is addressed."
260,6," Plaintiffs argue that they believe if the nature of the competition  [***101] must be pled, they can amend their complaint. 
However, that would not resolve the case law in this jurisdiction with respect to the application of the term ""deemed"" in HRS § 
481B-4. "
262,7," Obviously, as indicated supra, Plaintiffs may only bring a UMOC claim. "
268,8," Plaintiffs' amended complaint reiterated in pertinent part, states as follows: I. INTRODUCTION . . . As set forth below, the [D]efendants have imposed a service charge on the sale of certain food and beverage . . . but 
have failed to distribute the total proceeds of the service charge to these employees as tip income, as required by Hawaii 
law. This conduct violates [HRS §] 481B-14 and is actionable under [§§] 481B-4, 480-2, and 480-13. . . . . . . . III. PARTIES . . . ."
268,2, . . . . This class is brought pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and [HRS §] 480-13. . . . . . . . IV. FACTS
268,4," . For banquets, events, meetings and in other instances, the [D]efendants add a preset service charge to customers' bills 
for food and beverage provided at the hotels."
268,5," . However, the [D]efendants do not remit the total proceeds of the service charge as tip income to the employees who 
serve the food and beverages."
268,6," . Instead, the [D]efendants  [***132] have a policy and practice of retaining for themselves a portion of these service 
charges (or using it to pay managers or other non-tipped employees who do not serve food and beverages)."
268,7," . The [D]efendants do not disclose to the hotel's customers that the service charges are not remitted in full to the 
employees who serve the food and beverages. . . . . V. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS"
268,9," . This section is properly maintainable as a class action pursuant to [HRS §] 480-13 and Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure. . . . . . . . COUNT I ([HRS §§] 481B-14, 481B-4, and 480-2) The action of the [D]efendants as set forth above are in violation of [HRS §] 481B-14. Pursuant to Section 481B-4, such 
violation constitutes an unfair method of competition or unfair and deceptive act or practice within the meaning of Section 
480-2. Section 480-2(e) permits an action based on such unfair methods of competition to be brought in the appropriate 
court, and a class action for such violation is permitted and authorized by Section 480-13 and Rule 23 of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure. (Boldfaced font in original.) (Emphases added.) "
277,1," A version of the rule was initially implemented in 1997, causing a delay in approving Fox's biennial application for 
reappointment in 1998, but his privileges were temporarily continued while the Medical Staff further considered the matter. "
278,2," At the hearing on the motion brought by all defendants, Fox cited for the first time Williams v. University Medical Center of 
Southern Nevada, 688 F. Supp. 2d 1111, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23281, 2010 WL 668512 (D. Nev. Feb. 24, 2010). The Court 
authorized defendants to respond to Williams by post-hearing letter brief, and gave Fox permission to reply thereafter to such 
submission. Defendants filed a letter brief that arguably went substantially beyond merely responding to Williams, but which did 
not clearly violate any rule. Fox, in turn, filed a brief that went even further beyond the spirit of the leave that had been given for 
supplemental briefing, in that it raised several entirely new arguments. Predictably, defendants filed another brief crying foul, and 
urging the Court to strike the new arguments. Fox responded yet again, contending his prior brief was proper. When the fourth 
brief came in, the Court gave serious consideration to issuing a one word order: ""STOP!"" Fortunately, that did not prove 
necessary. While violations of the rules on unsolicited briefing are not to be ignored, given the enormous consequences of the 
issues raised in the additional briefing, the Court is exercising its discretion  [**10] to consider all of the substantive points raised 
by both sides therein. "
279,3," That subdivision provides: HN8[
] ""The term ""professional review activity"" means an activity of a health care entity with 
respect to an individual physician-- (A) to determine whether the physician may have clinical privileges with respect to, or membership in, the entity, (B) to determine the scope or conditions of such privileges or membership, or (C) to change or modify such privileges or membership."" All three circumstances apply here."
279,4," This is not to suggest that there was any concern that the physicians designated by Fox for his alternate coverage had ever 
demonstrated ""incompetence"" in the sense that they had deviated from the standard of care. That said, the identical privileges 
rule was directed to ensuring competence in the sense of appropriate qualifications, experience, and training on the part of the 
designated back-up doctors. "
280,5," As explained in Bryan v. James E. Holmes Reg'l Med. Ctr., 33 F.3d 1318 (11th Cir. 1994): ""A district court should 
 [**16] consider the issue of HCQIA immunity from damages at the summary judgment stage. If it determines that the defendant 
is not entitled to such protection, then the merits of the case should be submitted to the jury without reference to the immunity 
issue. If there are disputed subsidiary issues of fact concerning HCQIA immunity, such as whether the disciplined physician was 
given adequate notice of the charges and the appropriate opportunity to be heard, the court may ask the jury to resolve the 
subsidiary factual questions by responding to special interrogatories . . . . Under no circumstances should the ultimate question 
of whether the defendant is immune from monetary liability under HCQIA be submitted to the jury."" 33 F.3d at 1333. "
281,6," As noted above, at the hearing Fox submitted Williams v. University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 23281, 2010 WL 668512 in support of his contention that he should have been given a hearing. In Williams, the doctor's 
conduct was in the context of specific patient medical care decisions, making it of little application here. "
282,7," The Ricks court  [**23] listed the reporting requirement as one of the conditions for HCQIA immunity without discussing the 
further steps of an investigation by the Secretary and publication in the Federal Register. See 31 F.3d at 1485. As the reporting 
requirement was not at issue in Ricks, this appears to reflect a convenient shorthand for the Court, rather than a declaration that 
the provisions of Section 11111(b) are not applicable in this Circuit. "
283,8," Defendants have filed a separate motion to strike regarding the ""watch your back"" statement, set to be heard on April 14, 2010. 
The Court has reviewed Fox's opposition to that motion, and agrees that the statement could be considered non-declarative, or 
non-hearsay, or otherwise admissible for certain limited purposes. In none of those circumstances, however, would the 
statement be probative of the existence of a conspiracy. As this order reflects, however, ultimately it is of little consequence, 
because there is other evidence sufficient to create a triable issue. More fundamentally, though, in light of the disposition of this 
order, the issue is moot."
283,9," In one instance, the GSH Chief of Staff requested that Fox review a patient case. Contrary to defendants' suggestion, however, 
the fact that the review process was initiated by GSH does not conclusively establish that Fox was not the victim of retaliation for 
his resulting report. For example, Fox would be entitled to argue to a jury that defendants were unhappy that his report did not 
go far enough in attempting to defend or justify the patient care that had been given. "
285,10," The statute of limitations on Fox's federal claims is four years. The state law claims have a two year statute of limitations, such 
that only conduct occurring after March 31, 2004 can support those particular claims."
285,11," This is not to say that factual details beyond those explicitly set out in a complaint are out of bounds at the summary judgment 
stage, so long as those details do not represent new or different grounds for asserted liability beyond those properly noticed by 
the complaint. Fox is also correct that Rule 15 provides a mechanism for filing a supplemental complaint, to bring in conduct 
taking place after the date of the operative pleading. Fox has not sought leave to file a supplemental complaint, however, and 
the theoretical possibility that one could be filed is not a basis for considering post-complaint conduct  [**37] in evaluating this 
summary judgment motion. "
286,12," Indeed, it appears that the GSH Medical Executive Committee eliminated the ""loyalty oath"" requirement precisely because it 
agreed with Fox's objections to it. The committee minutes state: ""A physician's objections to language in the Confidentiality and 
Security Agreement were reviewed and found to be valid."" Ostermann Decl., Exh. B."
286,13," Fox's suggestion that the matter be continued under Rule 56(f) to permit further discovery fails to show with adequate 
specificity what further discovery might accomplish. "
298,1," The specific motions at issue are: ""Defendant Cephalon, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss the Direct Purchasers' First Consolidated 
Amended Complaint and the Rite Aid Complaint,"" (doc. no. 200); ""Generic Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended 
Complaints of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and End Payor Plaintiffs,"" (doc. no. 201); ""Defendant  [**17] Cephalon, Inc.'s

299,7," On February 23, 2010, after bifurcation of Apotex's patent invalidity/non-infringement and antitrust claims, the Court denied 
""Defendant Cephalon, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Counts III Through XIII of the Amended Complaint and to Strike Prayers for 
Relief,"" as it related to counts III-V. These counts included the bifurcated patent claims. Apotex, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 16940, 2010 WL 678104 (E.D.Pa. Feb. 23, 2010). "
301,8," On that date, the four (4) Generic Defendants filed Paragraph IV certifications with respect to the  [**27] RE'516 patent. (See 
Apotex Second Am. Compl., P 51.) "
303,9," Defendants also moved to dismiss the complaints on other grounds such as lack of standing and other count specific 
arguments. (See generally, Defs.' Memo., supra n. 2.) "
304,10," See also In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126249, 2009 WL 508869 (D.N.J. Feb. 6, 2009). This opinion, 
authored by a special master in the District of New Jersey, undertakes a comprehensive review of precedent regarding reverse 
payment settlements and also adopts the ""scope of the patent"" standard."
304,11," The agreement in Cardizem is unique because it delayed the generic manufacturer's entry into  [**40] the market, but did not 
terminate the patent infringement suit. Id. at 902. Rather, the quarterly payments were designed to delay entry by the generic 
manufacturer from the expiration of the thirty (30) month waiting period (or earlier if a district court ruled against the patent) until 
the resolution of the patent infringement case by the Supreme Court of the United States, either by denying certiorari or hearing 
the case. Id. "
308,12," Specifically, there is one (1) complaint from each of the class  [**55] Plaintiffs, opt-out Plaintiffs Rite-Aid and related Plaintiffs, 
and opt-out Plaintiffs Walgreen and related Plaintiffs in The King Drug Direct Purchaser Class Action; one (1) complaint each 
from the class Plaintiffs and opt-out Plaintiff Avmed in The Vista Healthplan End Payor Class Action; one (1) in The Apotex 
Litigation; and one (1) in The F.T.C. Litigation. "
312,13," Although the district court in Tamoxifen dismissed the complaint at the motion to dismiss phase, the facts of Tamoxifen are 
almost entirely different from those in the case sub judice. In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 277 F.Supp.2d 121 (E.D.N.Y. 
2003). Most notably, the plaintiffs in Tamoxifen made no allegations whatsoever that the terms of the agreements went outside 
the scope of the patent, either by restricting the sale of additional drugs not implicated by the patent, or by virtue of fraud on the 
PTO by the patent-holder. Id. Rather, the Second Circuit's discussion focuses on the good-faith nature of the settlement after a 
district court  [**72] ruling of invalidity. Tamoxifen, 466 F.3d at 204-06. Those issues are simply not present in our case. "
313,14," The court distinguished the facts before it from those in City of Pittsburgh v. West Penn Power Co., 147 F.3d 256 (3d Cir. 
1998), because of the distinctive designs of the applicable statutory framework. K-Dur, 338 F.Supp.2d at 535. That same 
analysis is applicable to the instant cases as well. "
314,15," The named end payor class Plaintiffs reside in Pennsylvania and New York. (Vista Am. Compl., PP 13-17.) Avmed, an opt-out 
Plaintiff, resides in Florida. (Avmed Am. Compl., P 16.) "
315,16," The court in Cardizem also rejected the defendants' arguments regarding privity under New York law, and for the purposes of 
these motions, we will adopt the same analysis and ruling on that issue. Cardizem, 105 F.Supp.2d at 669-71. "
332,1," The APA also assigned to Caldera claims ""associated directly or indirectly with . . . Related Technology,"" and ""Related 
Technology"" was defined to mean technology ""that is necessary to the performance by the DOS of their intended function and 
purpose."" Microsoft does not argue that the software application programs involved in this action constituted ""Related 
Technology"" within the meaning of the APA. "
333,2," The record suggests, and the parties implicitly agree, that the claims asserted in Counts I and VI were not envisioned until 
 [**30] the complaint in this action was prepared, long after the APA was executed. Although contemporaneous memoranda 
reflect that Novell was aware prior to entering into the APA that it had potential claims against Microsoft for antitrust damage 
caused to Novell's software applications, these claims were based upon Microsoft allegedly having leveraged its monopoly in the 
operating system market into a monopoly or near monopoly in the applications markets. Such claims are qualitatively different 
from those asserted in Counts I and VI. Unquestionably, Novell retained the claims based on Microsoft leveraging its operating 
system market monopoly into a monopoly in the applications markets, but, as the dismissal of Counts II through V manifest, they 
are time barred."
333,3," Novell also contends that the claims it is asserting in Counts I and VI are not ""associated"" with the DOS Products because 
although the DR DOS did compete in the operating system market, it was no longer being marketed and supported by Novell in 
October 1994, when the unlawful conduct alleged in this action began. This contention is not frivolous but it fails for several 
reasons. First, Novell owned DR DOS in October 1994 and its value certainly would have been affected by anticompetitive 
activity in the operating system market. Second, although Novell announced in September 1994 that it would exit  [**32] the DR 
DOS business, according to the allegations made in the Caldera amended complaint against Microsoft, Novell continued to sell 
some DR DOS products thereafter. Third, both in its original complaint and in the amended complaint filed in its action against 
Microsoft, Caldera sought, inter alia, an injunction ""requiring Microsoft, for a period often years, to disclose to Caldera all 
[application program interfaces (""APIs"")] for any operating system it produces, as well as any modifications, enhancements, 
updates, or new versions of such operating systems at the time that such products are released for beta testing."" This request 
for relief necessarily was premised upon the fact that the failure of Microsoft to disclose APIs (an important part of Novell's claim 
asserted in Count I of this action) was damaging DR DOS. Fourth, the allegations of misconduct by Microsoft made in this action 
were undertaken in a market that already was dominated by Microsoft, allegedly in part because of anticompetitive actions it had 
previously taken against DR DOS. Just as Novell's expert concedes that in order to have antitrust significance the conduct 
Microsoft directed against Novell's software applications  [**33] must be considered in light of conduct that Microsoft directed 
against other competitors, (see Novell's Opp. to Microsoft's Mot. for Summ. J. (""Dkt. No. 1952""), Exh. 4 at 6 (Reply Report of 
Roger G. Noll); Microsoft's Mem. in Supp. of its Mot. for Summ. J. (""Dkt. 1947""), Exh. 3 at 40-43), so too the actions launched by 
Microsoft against various software application producers must be considered against the background of the anticompetitive 
conduct it directed against DR DOS in earlier years. Fifth, Novell's expert asserts that Microsoft was motivated to act 
anticompetitively against Novell in part because of Novell's purchase of DR DOS. (See Dkt. No. 1952, Exh. 3 at 89 (Declaration 
of Roger G. Noll).) All of these facts establish the ""association"" between the claims asserted in this action and the DR DOS 
Product claims assigned to Caldera under the APA. "
334,4," Ironically, during the discovery phase of this case, Microsoft took the position that it was entitled to inquire into matters 
concerning the negotiating history of the APA because under Utah law extrinsic evidence should be considered in making the 
threshold determination of whether contractual language is ambiguous. In Ward v. Intermountain Farmers Ass'n, 907 P.2d 264, 
268-69 (Utah 1995),  [**34] a case now cited by Novell, the Utah Supreme Court did indicate that extrinsic evidence is relevant 
to an inquiry into ambiguity. However, in Daines v. Vincent, 2008 UT 51, 190 P.3d 1269, 1276-77 (Utah 2008), HN4[
] the Utah 
Supreme Court, while not disavowing the holding in Ward, clarified its meaning and stated that ""we did not [in Ward] intend that 
a judge allow surrounding circumstances to create ambiguity where the language of a contract would not otherwise permit"" and 
that ""a correct application of the Ward rule to determine what the writing means begins and ends with the language of the 
contract."" Moreover, as stated in the text, infra, the extrinsic evidence cited by Novell as to the meaning of the APA is itself 
ambiguous and inconclusive."
334,5," The inclusion of the word ""indirectly"" before the words ""associated with"" in the APA, while not dispositive, underscores the fact 
that there is no ambiguity in the agreement. Novell attempts to explain that ""indirectly"" was added to the APA on the ground that 
Novell did not want to be perceived as being connected with the suit filed by Caldera against Microsoft. According to Novell, a 
previous draft of the APA had defined the assigned claims as ""any and all  [**35] claims or causes of action associated with any 
of the DOS Products or Related Technology, including but not limited to any claims or causes of action for copyright or patent 
infringement, trade secret misappropriation or violation of any applicable antitrust laws."" Novell asserts that it was ""worried that 
the specific reference to the antitrust claim would draw attention to Novell's role in instigating the lawsuit."" (Mem. of Law in Supp. 
of Novell's Renewed Mot. for Summ. J. on Microsoft's Affirmative Defenses (""Dkt. No. 1948"") at 19.) Apparently, the reason for 
this concern was that the commercial value of Novell's office productivity applications would be harmed if consumers were led to 
believe that Novell's applications were not compatible with Windows 95. Of course, to any reasonable person objectively 
reviewing the APA, ""claims indirectly associated"" with ""DOS Products"" does not mean ""claims for copyright or patent 
infringement, trade secret misappropriation or violation of any applicable antitrust laws"" related to those products. Moreover, the 
fact that Novell chose to obfuscate its role in the Caldera litigation, see Novell, Inc. v. Canopy Group, Inc., 92 P.3d 768, 2004 UT 
App 162 (Utah App. 2004),  [**36] hardly entitles it to challenge the objective meaning of the language it wrote by reference to its 
own subjective (and secreted) intent."
334,6," For the Restatement (Second) Section 201(1) to be compatible with Utah case law, it would need to apply only where the 
express language of the contract is ambiguous. See, e.g., Cafe Rio, 207 P.3d at 1240 HN6[
] (""Where the language within the 
four corners of the contract is unambiguous, the parties' intentions are determined from the plain meaning of the contractual 
language."" (internal quotations and citation omitted)). "
335,7," There is at least one piece of extrinsic evidence that favors Microsoft. As indicated in note 3, supra, in the Caldera suit one of 
the claims for relief asserted by Caldera was for an injunction ""requiring Microsoft, for a period often years, to disclose to all 
software developments the APIs for any operating system it produces, as well as any modifications, enhancements, updates, or 
new versions of such operating systems that the time that such products are release for beta testing."" This request for relief 
manifests that Caldera was taking the position, as asserted by Novell in this action, that Microsoft's refusal to open APIs for its 
competitors constituted a violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. Novell contends that this request for relief by Caldera is 
 [**40] irrelevant for present purposes because Caldera asserted that the refusal to open APIs was harming the DOS Products 
and that it was not concerned about harm being inflicted upon Novell's software applications by virtue of the same activity. That 
may well be true, but the fact that Caldera was requesting an injunction requiring the opening of APIs demonstrates the 
association (direct or indirect) between the claims assigned to Caldera that it was asserting in its lawsuit and Novell's claims in 
the present action."
335,8," Of course, the fact that Novell had not yet envisioned the claims that it now asserts in this action at the time the APA was 
executed does not mean the claims were not assigned. As previously indicated, HN7[
] under Utah law where the language of 
a contract is not ambiguous, courts are to resolve its meaning by looking within its four corners. To attempt to identify the 
potentialities that were known to the contracting parties at the time the agreement was entered into would, in effect, be to inquire 
into their subjective intentions and undermine the principle that unambiguous contract language must be construed objectively 
and reasonably. See generally IIE. Allan Farnsworth, FARNSWORTH ON CONTRACTS Section 7.9  [**41] (3d Ed. 2004). 
Furthermore, this result is consistent with precedent regarding assignment of antitrust claims. HN8[
] Although the assignment 
of antitrust claims must be ""express,"" see, e.g., Sullivan v. Nat 'l Football League, 34 F.3d 1091, 1106 (1 st Cir. 1994), courts 
have found valid transfers where ""all-inclusive"" language was used. See, e.g., Lerman v. Joyce Int'l, Inc., 10 F.3d 106, 112 (3d 
Cir. 1993) (finding valid assignment where contract language purported to transfer ""any and all . . . causes of action, claims and 
demands of whatsoever nature"")."
335,9," Microsoft also argues that the claims asserted in Counts I and VI are barred by res judicata because they could have been, and 
were not, asserted in the Caldera suit. To the extent these claims were assigned by Novell to Caldera (as I find they 
 [**42] were), I agree with Microsoft that they are barred by res judicata. However, the res judicata argument adds nothing 
because the assignment of the present claims by Novell to Caldera itself prevents Novell from asserting them here, res judicata 
concerns aside. If, however, I am incorrect on the ownership of claims issue, in my judgment Microsoft's res judicata contention 
fails because (1) Caldera could not have asserted on behalf of Novell claims Caldera did not possess, and (2) Microsoft now 
concedes that although Novell had a financial interest in the Caldera litigation, it did not control that litigation. "
336,10," Access to information about Windows  [**46] 95's APIs-which are ""hooks"" in an operating system that allow applications to 
achieve functionality within that operating system-was critical for ISVs because it allowed them to develop programs that could 
function within Windows 95. "
337,11," For the reasons explained in infra  [**48] Section III.B, I have decided that the conduct directed at Group Wise should not be 
considered in analyzing of Novell's claims."
337,12," Although these agreements are the crux of the § 1 claim (Count VI), they may also be considered as anticompetitive behavior 
in the § 2 analysis (Count I). See infra note 16. "
339,13," Section 2 HN11[
] reads: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any 
other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, 
shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2."
339,14," HN12[
] Some courts break a monopolization analysis into three elements: (1) monopoly power, (2) willful 
acquisition/maintenance of monopoly power (or ""anticompetitive conduct""), and (3) causation. See, e.g., Microsoft Corp., 253 
F.3d 34,44, 50-79, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001); MetroNet Servs. Corp., 383 F.3d at 1131. Regardless of how the 
elements are organized, the substantive analysis remains the same. "
340,15," The Trinko Court noted that ""Aspen Skiing is at or near the outer boundary of § 2 liability. . . ."" The Court explained that ""[t]he 
unilateral termination of a voluntary (and thus presumably profitable) course of dealing suggested a willingness to forsake short-
term profits to achieve an anticompetitive end… [and] the defendant's unwillingness to renew the ticket even if compensated at 
retail price revealed a distinctly anticompetitive bent."" Trinko, 540 U.S. at 409 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis in original). "
341,16," HN16[
] ""Even though exclusivity arrangements are often analyzed under § 1, such exclusionary conduct may also be an element in a § 2 claim."" LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 157 (3d Cir. 2003). Just because the agreements with the OEMs do 
not give rise to a § 1 claim, see infra Section III.C, it does not necessarily follow that those agreements do not amount to 
anticompetitive conduct, or are at least evidence of anticompetitive motives, under § 2. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 70 
(""[E]xclusive contracts, in certain circumstances, may give rise to a § 2 violation even though the contracts foreclose less than 
the roughly 40% or 50% share usually required in order to establish a § 1 violation."")."
341,17," Microsoft points to two of my prior opinions to argue that ""Microsoft is not required to disclose information to its competitors 
about new Windows operating systems under development."" I have held, in cases brought under the ""essential facilities"" 
doctrine, that Microsoft had no antitrust obligation to share information about Windows 95 with IS Vs. See In re Microsoft Corp. 
Antitrust Litig., 274 F. Supp. 2d 743, 745-46 (D. Md. 2003) (in so holding, noting that ""to require one company to provide its 
intellectual property to a competitor would significantly chill innovation""  [**65] and ""the essential facility doctrine has never been 
interpreted to deny a person the right to gain temporary benefits from innovations to its own products""); see also Daisy Mountain 
Fire Dist. v. Microsoft Corp., 547 F. Supp. 2d 475, 490 (D. Md. 2008) (""[E]ssential facility claims involving tangible assets are "
342,," quite different from claims involving technical innovation, and plaintiff fails to provide a compelling argument for applying the 
doctrine to technological innovations or information.""). However, in the case at hand, Novell is not proceeding under the 
essential facilities doctrine. Further, Novell has presented evidence that Microsoft did more than just refuse to disclose 
information about Windows 95. It has also raised a genuine question of fact about whether Microsoft mislead Novell about 
characteristics of Windows 95 and about what information it would provide in advance of Windows 95's launch."
342,18," At times, Microsoft seems to argue that Novell must prove that Microsoft's conduct had a ""substantial"" anticompetitive impact 
 [**68] in the operating system market, (see Dkt. No. 1947 at 26), which I would view as a more rigorous test than the 
contributed significantly standard. Increasing this burden may risk undermining the principle that ""antitrust laws are for the 
benefit of competition."" Cf. Morgan v. Ponder, 892 F.2d 1355, 1360 (8th Cir. 1989) (quoting Ball Mem'l Hosp. v. Mut. Hosp. Ins., 
Inc., 784 F.2d 1325, 1338 (7th Cir. 1986)). "
343,19," (Dkt. No. 1952, Exh. 4 at 32 (Noll Expert Reply) (""I do not agree that Professor Murphy has proven that the acts against Novell 
alone had no effect on competition for the x86 operating systems . . . ."").)"
343,20," (See also Dkt. No. 1952, Exh. 4 at 27 (Noll Expert Reply) (""In a 1000-firm market, the harm to any one competitor would not 
cause harm to competition, but that is irrelevant to ascertaining whether the entire pattern of conduct against all 1000 firms 
caused anticompetitive harm."").) Microsoft seems to concede that, under some circumstances, the anticompetitive harm caused by a defendant's anticompetitive 
conduct toward multiple small competitors could be aggregated to reach a significant contribution finding in the relevant market. 
Microsoft distinguishes itself from such a hypothetical defendant, however, by asserting that its conduct toward Novell was 
fundamentally different than the anticompetitive conduct Microsoft directed against other ISVs  [**73] and applications. This 
argument is unpersuasive. I am not convinced that the conduct directed at the other ISVs is distinguishable in any material way 
from the conduct directed at Novell. Regardless, I do not think a defendant can avoid antitrust liability by engaging in ""different"" 
anticompetitive conduct toward each of its small competitors. "
344,21," Section 1 HN20[
] reads in part: ""Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
344,22," The Fourth Circuit explained: ""Counts I and VI . . . are predicated on the theory that Microsoft's conduct injured competition in 
the market for PC operating systems, a market in which Novell did not directly compete. . . . Section 5(i) of the Clayton Act 
provides that government anti-trust proceedings toll the statute of limitations for private antitrust actions 'based in whole or in part 
on any matter complained of' by the government. Novell's Counts I and VI are indeed based on Microsoft's anticompetitive 
conduct in the PC operating-systems market, which was at issue in the DOJ complaint."" See Novell, 505 F.3d at 306-07. "
345,23," In its brief before the Fourth Circuit, Microsoft explained  [**78] the procedural posture and history of Count VI: Because Counts I and VI allege harm in the same PC operating system market at issue in the DOJ Complaint, Microsoft did 
not argue that those two claims were time-barred. . . . There was some confusion in the district court concerning what 
market(s) are at issue in Count VI. Although Count VI does not specify a market, it alleges that Microsoft entered into 
exclusionary distribution agreements in violation of [§ 1]. . . . [S]uch a claim requires proof of harm to ""competition as a 
whole within"" at least one antitrust market. Novell provided no indication that Count VI might pertain to the PC operating 
system market (as opposed to the alleged applications markets) until oral argument, at which point Microsoft's counsel 
immediately responded that to the extent that were so, then Count VI should be dismissed for the same reasons as Count I. Brief of Defendant-Appellant Microsoft Corp. at *12-*13, *13 n.4, Novell, Inc. v. Microsoft, Corp., Nos. 06-1134, 06-1238, 2006 
WL 1348322 (4th Cir. Apr. 13, 2006) (internal citations omitted)."
345,24," Novell may have been able to prove restraint of trade in the operating system market by, in part, establishing substantial 
foreclosure in various software applications markets. To do so, however, Novell would have to prove more than just substantial 
foreclosure in those software applications markets; it would also have had to point to evidence showing how and why that 
substantial foreclosure in fact restrained trade in the operating system market."

] ""Exclusive dealing occurs when . . . a buyer . . . agrees to purchase, license or lease all or a substantial portion of its 
requirements of a product or service exclusively from a particular seller."" WILLIAM C. HOLMES, ANTITRUST LAW HANDBOOK 
§ 2:19 (2009)."
345,26," Although Tampa Electric involved a Clayton Act claim, its analysis pertains to exclusive dealing under § 1 of the Sherman Act 
as well. See Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 335 (""We need not discuss the respondents' further contention that the contract also 
violates § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act, for if it does not fall within the broader prescriptions of § 3 of the Clayton Act it follows "
346,," that it is not forbidden by those of the former.""). Some ""[c]ourts and commentators disagree as to whether [the Tampa Electric 
test] outlaws a broader range of conduct than does the rule of reason drawn from § 1 of the Sherman Act."" Bepco, 106 F. Supp. 
2d at 827. I believe (1) that exclusive dealing claims under the Clayton Act and the Sherman Act ( § 1) are either subject to the 
same standard or that the Clayton Act is broader and (2) that the analytical framework for exclusive  [**82] dealing claims under 
§ 1 is the same as that articulated in Tampa Electric. See, e.g., Twin City Sportservice, 676 F.2d at 1301-02 (expressly 
authorizing use of Tampa Electric to analyze exclusive dealing under § 1); United States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp 2d 30, 
52-53 (D.D.C. 2000), rev 'd on other grounds by 253 F.3d (utilizing Tampa Electric, or something close to it, in analyzing a § 1 
claim); Masimo Corp. v. Tyco Health Care Group, L.P., 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29977, 2006 WL 1236666, at *4 n.2, *4-*8 (C.D. 
Cal. 2006) (unpublished) (utilizing Tampa Electric, or something close to it, in analyzing a § 1 claim and noting ""it is easier to 
meet the threshold of foreclosure for a [Clayton Act] violation that it is for a § 1 violation"" (citing Twin City Sportservice, 676 F.2d 
at 1304 n.9))."
346,27," Section 1 HN22[
] only covers ""contract[s], combination[s] . . ., or conspiracy[ies]."" In contrast to the pattern of unilateral 
conduct that was considered in analyzing the § 2 claim in Count I, agreements between Microsoft and third parties are the only 
allegedly anticompetitive conduct that may be considered in assessing the anticompetitive harm in Count VI."
346,28," Microsoft also argues that the Project Avalanche agreements may not form the basis of Count VI because (1) ""[h]ad Novell 
alleged harm to competition in channels other than the OEM channel, that allegation would have been barred by the statute of 
limitations because it would not have been based in whole or in part on any matter complained of in the Government case"" and 
(2) Novell did not include such allegations in its Complaint. As to Microsoft's first argument, a claim arising from the Project Avalanche agreements may still have been tolled because 
Novell alleges that those agreements caused harm in the PC operating  [**85] system market. See Novell, 505 F.3d at 307 
(quoting 15 U.S.C. § 16(i)) (""Section 5(i) of the Clayton Act HN24[
] provides that government antitrust proceedings toll the 
statute of limitations for private antitrust actions 'based in whole or in part on any matter complained of' by the government. 
Novell's Counts I and VI are indeed based on Microsoft's anticompetitive conduct in the PC operating-systems market, which 
was at issue in the DOJ Complaint.""); see also Novell, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11520, 2005 WL 1398643, at *3 (internal citation 
omitted) (""The governing test is whether the matters complained of in the private action 'bear a real relation' to a matter 
complained of in the government suit.""). I also am unpersuaded by Microsoft's second argument. Again, a complaint need only contain a ""short and plain statement of 
the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Erickson, 551 U.S. at 93 (quoting FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2)). Although 
""specific facts are not necessary,"" the Complaint must ""'give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds 
upon which it rests.'"" Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Novell's Complaint put Microsoft on fair notice that it would bring 
claims based on  [**86] agreements in the finished goods channel. The Complaint included a section entitled ""Other Distribution 
Channels,"" in which Novell alleged ""anticompetitive tactics"" in ""the following channels: independent retailers that sell to individual 
and small businesses; independent or loosely affiliated resellers that sell to larger organizations . . .; and direct sales to 
government agencies, large corporations, and other large organizations."" (Compl. PP 132-33.) Presumably in an effort to 
strengthen its argument about the relatedness between Count VI and the government's suit, Novell only highlighted the OEM 
agreements in opposing the Motion to Dismiss, and accordingly both this Court and the Fourth Circuit focused on the OEM 
agreements as the crux of Count VI. Nonetheless, the fact that the Complaint itself challenges non-OEM agreements leads me 
to conclude that I should consider the allegations about the Project Avalanche agreements. "
347,29," ""The relevant market for this purpose includes the full range of selling opportunities reasonably open to rivals . . ."" Omega 
Envtl., 127 F.3d at 1162 (quoting 2A Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 570b1, at 278). "
348,30," This assumes, without deciding, that these agreements with OEMs would in fact be considered exclusive or anticompetitive."
348,31," The § 1 legality of these minimum purchase and per system agreements is distinguishable from the Section 1 legality of 
Microsoft's minimum purchase, per system, per copy, and per processor agreements with OEMs covered by Judge Jackson's 
consent order in 1995. In that case, the OEM agreements concerned the distribution of PC operating systems, a market in which 
OEMs control a substantially greater percentage of the distribution channels than they do in the various software applications 
markets. See United States v. Microsoft, 159 F.R.D. 318, 1995 WL 505998 (D.D.C. 1995); see also United States v. Microsoft 
Corp, 159 F.R.D. 318, 322 n.9 (D.D.C. 1995) (""In the first half of 1994, 80% of Windows units sold by Microsoft were through 
OEMs.""), rev'd by 56 F.3d 1448, 312 U.S. App. D.C. 378 (D.C. Cir.). Consequently,  [**92] anticompetitive or exclusive OEM 
agreements in the PC operating system market foreclosed a much greater amount of competition."
348,32," Microsoft also argues that Novell ""abandoned"" Count VI because it failed to offer expert evidence of the damages it suffered 
as a result of the conduct alleged in Count VI. (See Dkt. No. 1947 at 44.) Because Count VI may be resolved on other grounds, I 
did not reach this issue. "
351,*," Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except 
 [**3] under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4. "
356,1," For this reason, the Court need not address whether plaintiffs have adequately alleged the remaining elements of a viable 
Contract Clause claim. "
357,2," Several of the defendants are home rule municipalities, which are granted broad power to legislate by the Illinois State 
Constitution. ILL. CONST. art. VII § 6. This does not change the antitrust analysis. Home rule municipalities' actions may be 
exempt from antitrust scrutiny if they constitute municipal action to carry out clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state 
policy."" Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 52, 102 S. Ct. 835, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1982). "
359,3," For this reason, the Court need not resolve the parties' disputes regarding the precise interplay of sections 1 and 5. "
362,1," The Court adopts the excellent description by Circuit Judge W illiam A. Fletcher of the regulatory process created by the Hatch-
W axman Act found in Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. v. Abbott Labs., Inc., 552 F.3d 1033, 1036-38 (9th Cir. 2009). "
365,2," Sandoz's counterclaim with respect to its attempted monopolization claim pleads that the relevant U.S. market is the entire U.S. 
oral contraceptive market. In its opening brief, Bayer argued that this alternative product market is implausible because Bayer 
only holds an inadequate 50% market share. In response, Sandoz correctly contended that it need not allege an existing 
dominant market share in order to plead an attempted monopolization claim. See Rebel Oil Co. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 
1421, 1437 (9th Cir. 1995). In reply, Bayer abandoned the inadequate market share argument and asserted that Sandoz had 
failed to adequately plead several other elements. However, the Court will not consider new arguments raised in a reply brief. 
See Coos County v. Kempthorne, 531 F.3d 792, 812 (9th Cir. 2008). Accordingly, the Court denies the motion to dismiss the 
attempted monopolization claim."
365,3," Antitrust law requires allegations of both a product and geographic market. Sandoz alleges the United States as the 
geographic market and Bayer does not challenge that allegation. "
375,1," It bears noting that although this claim is asserted on behalf of all plaintiffs, the only factual allegations in support of the claim 
are made by plaintiff Boyd. Boyd alleges that defendants violated this section by charging and collecting, in conjunction with the 
Payment Plan and Forbearance Agreements, a usurious interest rate. (Id. at ¶¶ 164-167.) "
376,2," Specifically, Judge Pollack found that, because the Boyds and Jones alleged that they both owned property and received 
allegedly improper communications concerning their outstanding debts within one year of the filing of the Binson action, they are 
properly considered putative members of that class such that American Pipe tolling would apply to preserve their otherwise 
untimely claims."
376,3," Although the applicable statute of limitations for the Boyds' and Jones's FDCPA claims had run by the time of the filing of the 
instant action, American Pipe tolling operated to save these plaintiffs' otherwise time-barred claims. Specifically, these two 
plaintiffs have satisfied the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Binson class in that they allege in the Amended Complaint that 
they had requested and received the purportedly illegal payoff quotes during the Binson class period. (Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 53-54, 
60, 61, 64.)"
376,4," Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint appears to contain claims asserted against all defendants for violation of the relevant 
FDCPA provisions, whereas, in plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, the FDCPA claims were brought solely against the JER, 1997-1 
and 1998-1 Trust defendants. This issue is explored further in Point III.B."
376,5, Plaintiff Meneses has since withdrawn from the case. (Docket Entry No. 153.) 
378,6," It should not be overlooked that Taylor has failed  [*21] to cite to any law to establish that her purported ""beneficial ownership"" 
of the property satisfies the first criteria for inclusion in the Binson class for the purpose of determining the availability of 
American Pipe tolling. "
379,7," Most of the factual allegations are identical to those previously asserted. (Compare Am. Compl., ¶¶ 109-128 with ¶¶ Second 
Am. Compl., ¶¶ 116-135.) "
380,8," Of the fifteen pages in her opposition brief devoted to the equitable tolling issue, only one page directly addresses the issue of 
concealment. (Pls. Mem. Opp. at 9-24, see part C. at 20-21.) "
382,9," As Warters was unable to satisfy the amounts of the outstanding liens at the time payment was demanded, the defendants 
commenced a foreclosure action against her in New York Supreme Court, Queens County. A buyer was found for Warters's 
residence, and the closing was set for May 19, 2004. As the seller, Warters was responsible for the satisfaction of any 
outstanding liens prior to transfer of title to the property. Accordingly, $60,500 of the purchase price was placed in escrow to 
cover the liens. Verrazano Closing Services (""Verrazano"") was the closing company and escrow agent for all parties to the sale. 
See Plaintiffs' March 19, 2010 Letter (""Pl. March 19th Letter"") at 2."
382,10, Sarah Latham was a relative from whom Warters received the subject property. 
383,11," Although Warters alleges that  [*40] Verrazano received payoff quotes from JER on June 3, 18, and 22, 2004, Warters has 
only submitted the contents of the June Payoff Quote to the Court. See Pl. March 19th Letter, Exh. D."
383,12," Warters retained Cipolla to represent her in connection with the sale of the subject property. See Trusts' March 19, 2010 Letter 
(""Tr. March 19th Letter"") at 2, Exh. A."
383,13," Warters does not contend that she had any direct communication with JER Revenue on or after May 19, 2004. "
385,14," Taylor's and Warters' argument that the Binson plaintiffs ""service"" of a proposed amended complaint containing the Prospect 
Plaintiffs' claims in connection with the motion to amend is sufficient to invoke equitable tolling must be rejected. (Pl. Mem. Opp. 
at 21.) In so arguing, Taylor and Warters seem to imply that the Binson's motion to amend constituted a motion to intervene, and 
complied with Rule 24's requirement that a motion to intervene ""be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense 
for which intervention is sought."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c). Not only did Taylor and Warters not file a motion to intervene, but the 
Binson's motion to amend fell  [*48] far short of Rule 24(c)'s requirements. Plaintiffs have failed to establish that the proposed 
amended pleading was ever served on the JER defendants, as would have been required. (Pl. Mem. Opp. at 21) (""Each of the 
Trusts was served with a copy of the proposed Amended Complaint containing Warter's [sic] and plaintiff Taylor's claims."" 
(emphasis added.)) Also, the proposed amended complaint was served on or after February 24, 2005 (date of amended 
summonses) — nine days after the Binson's motion to amend was filed on February 15, 2005. (Docket No. 117, Declaration of 
Mark S. Kaufman in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Exhibit J.) Therefore, the motion was not ""accompanied by a 
pleading that sets out the claim . . .."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(c) (emphasis added). Warters and Taylor have simply failed to present 
any evidence whatsoever that service of the proposed amended complaint was properly effectuated, let alone that it complied 
with Rule 24(c). "
386,15," Taylor is the only plaintiff to have alleged misconduct on the part of the 1996-1 and 1999-1 Trusts. See 2nd Am. Compl. at ¶¶ 
82, 86, 90, 92, 93, 95, 96-106, 112. "
388,16," Boyd is the only plaintiff to have alleged conduct on the part of certain defendants (JER and the 1998-1 Trust) in violation of 
section 5-501 of New York General Obligations Law. "
400,1," There are eight cases in all, with the lead case filed on March 18, 2008. (See Case No. 1:08CV677, Doc. No. 1 Class Action 
Complaint.) The other cases are: 1:08CV678, 1:08CV741, 4:08CV750, 1:08CV803, 1:08CV1021, 5:08CV1289, 1:08CV1836. 
Originally assigned to the dockets of numerous judges in the Northern District of Ohio, the cases were eventually transferred to 
the docket of the Hon. David D. Dowd, Jr. The cases were consolidated on July 11, 2008, and Plaintiffs' Consolidated Class 
Action Complaint was filed on July 31, 2008. Following Judge Dowd's recusal on February 2, 2010, these consolidated cases 
were reassigned to the undersigned's docket. All docket references are to the lead case: 1:08CV677. "
402,2," Stewart brings its motion under Rule 12(b)(2), while Old Republic relies upon Rule 12(b)(2), (3), and (6). Because the Court's 
ruling is largely guided by its application of Rule 12(b)(6), the Court will not devote space to setting forth the standards for the 
other relevant provisions of Rule 12."
402,3," Interchangeably referred to by courts as the Keogh doctrine, or the filed tariff doctrine. "
403,4," Cf. Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 65 S. Ct. 716, 89 L. Ed. 1051 (1945). The Reed-Bulwinkle Act was enacted 
at least in part in response to Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U.S. 439, 65 S. Ct. 716, 89 L. Ed. 1051 (1945). In 
Pennsylvania R. Co., the Supreme Court restated Keogh and held that, ""although Georgia could not maintain a suit under the 
antitrust laws to obtain damages, it could obtain injunctive relief against the collective ratemaking procedures employed by the 
railroads."" Square D, 476 U.S. at 418. The Reed-Bulwinkle Act created an absolute immunity from the antitrust laws for certain 
specific activities, including the one at issue  [**21] in Pennsylvania R. Co., and thereby superseded that holding. Square D 
rejected the contention that Keogh ""was implicitly rejected in the Reed-Bulwinkle Act"" and rather held that ""[p]articularly because 
the legislative history reveals clear congressional awareness of Keogh, far from supporting petitioners' position, the fact that 
Congress specifically addressed this area and left Keogh undisturbed lends powerful support to Keogh's continued viability."" Id. 
at 419. "
404,5," Thus, the filed rate doctrine is different than the State Action Doctrine, sometimes called the Parker State Action Doctrine, 
which holds that state-mandated or state-directed restraints are exempted from antitrust liability, see Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 
341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943), and the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, which immunizes from antitrust liability those who 
petition the federal or state government to take actions that may impose restraints on trade. See, e.g., Eastern R. Presidents 
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961)."
404,6," Although  [**24] it may in certain circumstances, as discussed infra."
404,7," As noted by the Magistrate Judge in her Report and Recommendation (Doc. No. 102 at 18-19), federal courts have long 
applied the Filed rate doctrine to a wide spectrum of insurance actions. See, e.g., Rios v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 469 
F.Supp.2d 727, 737 (S.D. Iowa 2007) (applying filed rate doctrine to common law claim seeking return of insurance premiums); 
Mullinax v. Radian Guar. Inc., 311 F. Supp. 2d 474, 484 n.6 (M.D.N.C. 2004) (filing of rate by defendant with state Department of 
Insurance bars plaintiffs from challenging reasonableness of those rates); Kirksey v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co., 114 F. Supp. 2d 526, 
529 (S.D. Miss. 2000) (applying filed rate doctrine to common law claim seeking return of insurance premiums); Stevens v. 
Union Planters Corp., 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22630, 2000 WL 33128256, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 20, 2000) (allegation of kickbacks 
in forced hazard insurance scheme barred by filed rate doctrine); Allen v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 59 F. Supp. 2d 1217, 
1229 (S.D. Ala.1999) (filed rate doctrine barred claim challenging unlawfulness of rate filing by insurance company); Korte v. 
Allstate Ins. Co., 48 F. Supp. 2d 647, 651 (E.D. Tex. 1999)  [**25] (applying filed rate doctrine to claim asserting insurance rates 
improper due to submission by defendant of illegal subsidy factor accounts to state insurance regulator because state agency 
determined reasonable rates pursuant to statutory scheme); Morales v. Attorney's Title Ins. Fund, Inc., 983 F. Supp. 1418, 1429 
(S.D. Fla. 1997) (dismissing plaintiffs' kickback claim against title insurer pursuant to filed rate doctrine because claim was 
nothing more than challenge to title insurance rates set by state regulators); Calico Trailer Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Ins. Co. Of N. Am., 
1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20750, 1994 WL 823554 at *6 (E.D. Ark. Oct. 12, 1994) (filed rate doctrine barred plaintiffs' challenge to 
insurance rates as inflated as result of conspiracy among defendant insurance companies). "
405,8," The Court notes that the Plaintiffs' theory that lower prices would necessarily result absent the asserted 'antitrust violations' is 
by no means a certainty. See, e.g, Scott Harrington, Competition and Health Insurance, Wall Street J., Nov. 6, 2009 (analyzing 
recent Congressional proposals to remove antitrust exemptions in the healthcare insurance industry and suggesting that, 
 [**31] contrary to popular belief, prohibiting collaboration between insurers might actually cause premiums to increase rather 
than fall). "
408,9," The court in Wileman Bros. also suggested that, although it could not consider it on a motion to dismiss, ""evidence of 
participation [in the  [**38] non-disapproval process] by representatives of the Secretary"" might suffice to apply the Filed rate 
doctrine."
408,10," Indeed, approval by the superintendent is clearly what the statute comprehends: ""[. . .] the superintendent may authorize a 
filing which he has reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period."" § 3935.04(D). "
413,11, Available at http://www.insurance.ohio.gov/Legal/Bulletins/Documents/91-1.pdf.
413,12," This Court granted Plaintiffs' request to conduct limited discovery on October 15, 2008. (Doc. No. 52.) Pursuant to this order, 
Plaintiffs deposed Maureen Motter, a representative of the Ohio Department of Insurance. (Transcript at Doc. No. 77-2.) While 
Defendants support this contention with the deposition testimony of Ms. Motter, this Court has not relied in any manner on Ms. 
Motter's testimony in reaching its consideration of the effect of Bulletin 91-1 on Plaintiffs' claims. "
414,13," Chapter 3937 of the Ohio Code addresses Casualty and Motor Vehicle Insurance. Section 3937.03(B) provides that an insurer 
""may satisfy its obligation to make such filings [to the Department of Insurance] by becoming a member of, or subscriber to, a 
licensed rating organization [. . .]."" OHIO Rev. Code § 3937.03(B). Other than the substitution of the entity name, i.e, ""licensed 
rating organization"" for ""licensed rating bureau,"" § 3937.03(B) is identical to § 3935.04(B). "
415,14," The Court notes that in both Barnes and Chesner, the fraud claims were dismissed because plaintiffs failed to allege fraud 
with the requisite particularity as required by Rule 9(b). "
416,15," This is an important, and nonobvious,  [**70] distinction. Success by the Barnes and Chesner plaintiffs would not have 
resulted in the alteration of the rate paid by plaintiffs -- the rate would have remained fully intact. Damages would have been 
calculated by determining the difference between the two approved filed rates, but recovery would have been premised on the 
fraudulent failure to disclose the availability of the separate, lower rate at the time of purchase, and not on some flaw in the 
establishment of the rate paid."
416,16," Pinney Dock required the Sixth Circuit to determine whether the Filed rate doctrine applies when the plaintiff is defendant's 
competitor, rather than customer, an issue over which the Courts of Appeal are not in accord but not implicated by this case. Cf. 
Arsberry v. Illinois, 244 F.3d 558 (7th Cir. 2001) (doctrine may bar claims by non-purchasing competitors) with In re Lower Lake 
Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 1144 (3d Cir. 1993) (applying non-purchasing competitor exception). "
417,17," ""Such 'obey the law' injunctions cannot be sustained."" EEOC v. Wooster Brush Co. Employees Relief Ass'n, 727 F.2d 566, 
576 (6th Cir. 1984)  [**77] (citing Payne v. Travenol Laboratories, Inc., 565 F.2d 895, 897-98 (5th Cir.)). "
419,18," Of course, application of the ""impairment clause"" to the state statutes at issue would not change the result. A federal law does 
not impair, invalidate, or supersede a state regulation where the ""federal law does not directly conflict with state regulation, and 
when application of the federal law would not frustrate any declared state policy or interfere with a state's administrative regime 
[…]."" Humana, 525 U.S. at 310. See Brown v. Cassens Transport Co., 546 F.3d 347, 362 (6th Cir. 2008).  [**83] To demonstrate 
impairment, it must be shown that substantive sections of the State regulations will be invalidated, Kenty, 92 F.3d at 392, or that 
it will render the State law ineffective, Brown, 546 F.3d at 362. Here, there can be no question that application of the Sherman 
Act will substantially impair Ohio's regulatory framework governing title insurance by invalidating those portions of the 
regulations--including Ohio Rev. Code § 3935.04 and § 3935.06--that permit the submission of filed rates through rating 
bureaus. Such an application would surely frustrate the declared state policy of permitting such cooperation. "
420,19," The court gave weight to the government's contention that buying escrow services is separate from buying title insurance 
because some people who buy escrow services do not buy title insurance, those who buy both have two separate agreements, 
and searches are performed by agents who keep the entire fee. Id. at 1252."
420,20," Specifically, the Court found that ""[a] title insurance policy insures against certain losses or damages sustained by reason of a 
defect in title not  [**89] shown on the policy or title report to which it refers […]. The insured is protected from some losses 
resulting from title defects not discoverable from a search of the public records, such as forgery, missing heirs, previous "
421,," marriages, impersonation, or confusion in names […]. Title insurance also includes the obligation to defend in the event that an 
insured is sued by reason of some defect within the scope of the policy's guarantee."" Id. at 625-26."
421,21," Plaintiffs erroneously claim that this decision stands for the contrary position that more than minimal risk spreading is required. 
In SEC, the Court found that the issuance of variable annuities did not constitute the business of insurance because it did not 
involve the spreading of any risk. Id. at 71."
421,22," The process of minimizing or limiting risk by a pre-issuance investigation is not unique to title insurance. Life insurance policies 
are issued only after the insurer knows, generally by means of a pre-issue physical examination, the risk associated with 
insuring the prospective insured. If the physical examination reveals that the risk is too great, the policy will not issue. Similarly, if 
the title search reveals a significant potential cloud on the title, the title insurance policy may not issue."
421,23," At oral argument, Plaintiffs attempted to draw the distinction between ""rate-setting"" and ""rate-making."" Plaintiffs argued that 
""rate-making"" is the process by which insurers are supposed to share information with the rating bureau (TR at 52-53), whereas 
""rate-setting"" is the process of actually fixing insurance rates. While Plaintiffs admit that pooling statistical information is exempt 
under the Sherman Act, they claim that when courts speak of the ""business of insurance"" as an exemption, they are really 
speaking of what Plaintiffs refer to as rate-making. The Court rejects this distinction because the case law clearly exempts the 
fixing of insurance rates from the Sherman Act. See Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 224 n. 32. "
422,24," Section 3(b) of the McCarran-Ferguson Act also makes clear that the Act should not be read to immunize from federal antitrust 
liability ""any agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" 15 U.S.C. § 1013(b). This 
provision is inapplicable because Plaintiffs do not allege a cognizable antitrust boycott. "
424,25," In its entirety, § 1.51 reads: HN38[
] If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision, they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect 
is given to both. If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an 
exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the 
general provision prevail. OHIO REV. CODE ANN. § 1.51. "
425,26," Later amended to June 30, 1948."
425,27," Indeed, Plaintiffs themselves cite to an example of an insurance company ""not a party to Defendants' price-fixing agreement,"" 
Entitle Direct Insurance,  [**109] that allegedly offers lower prices than Defendants. "
427,28," The Court finds that the dismissal of the corporate parent Defendants should also be with prejudice. The Magistrate Judge 
correctly determined that a corporate parent Defendant could not be liable under the Sherman Act merely for approving or 
assenting to the actions of its affiliate or subsidiary. See Cupp v. Alberto-Culver USA, Inc., 310 F. Supp. 2d 963, 973-74 (W.D. 
Tenn. 2004). She recommended that these defendants be dismissed, without prejudice, for this additional reason. Because 
Plaintiffs have not alleged any facts that would suggest that the corporate parent Defendants played a role in any alleged 
conspiracy, the Court finds that it would be futile to permit Plaintiffs leave to attempt to re-plead a cause of action against them. "
437,1," Since our factual recitation is merely a broad overview of the basis for the instant litigation, it is generally taken from Plaintiff's 
amended complaint. "
438,2," Notably, the Third Circuit affirmed our esteemed colleague Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie's dismissal of the Lanham Act claims, 
but did so on other grounds. See Santana Prods. v. Bobrick Washroom Equipment, Inc., 401 F.3d 123, 131 n.3 (3d Cir. 2005) 
(""We will not address at this time the Noerr Pennington doctrine's applicability to Lanham Act claims because we conclude that 
Santana's Lanham Act claim is barred by laches."")."
438,3," In the main, this alleged misinformation took the form of a March 1, 2005 mail-merged letter (Doc. 465-16, Ex. 54), a document 
entitled ""New Revenue Opportunity for Pennsylvania School Districts: Converting Tax Claims into Revenue; Frequently Asked 
Questions Regarding the Xspand Program,"" (Doc. 465-14, Ex. 29) (""FAQ""), and various power point presentations delivered to a 
number of governmental decision makers, (see, e.g., Doc. 465-15, Ex. 41) (made to representatives  [**12] of Norristown School 
District)."
438,4," Xspand relies heavily on Judge Vanaskie's aforementioned opinion in Santana Prods. v. Bobrick Washroom Equipment, Inc., 
249 F.Supp. 2d 463 (M.D. Pa. 2003). While our determination runs counter to the ultimate conclusion in that case, we note that 
these opinions are not necessarily discordant, since the sham exception was not at issue in Santana Products. "
439,5," Indeed, HN7[
] Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 permits parties to plead inconsistent and conflicting theories of recovery. See Kayea v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34482, 2008 WL 1867154 * 1 (D. Del 2008). This is exactly 
what MRS has done."
439,6," This communication could reasonably indicate that Xspand's intent in disseminating information regarding the alleged illegality 
of MRS-facilitated transactions was to cripple MRS, and not necessarily to acquire business for itself. After all, this 
communication was not designed to sway customers into choosing Xspand's services; it was arguably meant to stifle 
 [**15] MRS' financing so that MRS could not afford to compete with Xspand in the marketplace."
439,7," The March 1, 2005 letter was signed by Nancy Cerbus (""Cerbus""), who was identified as Xspand's Vice-President of Business 
Development. (See Doc. 465-16). However, Cerbus testified that she did not compose the letter but rather authorized Xspand to 
sign her name thereto. Nancy Cerbus Deposition, August 23, 2005, pp. 93-94. Cerbus admittedly knew very little about the 
subjects addressed in the March 1, 2005 letter. See id. 93-119. She asserted that Paul Scura (""Scura""), president and chief 
executive officer of Plymouth Financial Company, Inc., the parent corporation of Xspand, authored the letter. Id. Scura, who is 
the President of Xspand, testified that he did not have a certified public accountant or a lawyer review the accuracy of the MRS-
related allegations contained in the March 1, 2005 letter prior to distributing the same. Paul Scura Deposition, August 24, 2005, 
pp. 146-47. Scura, who has ""over 20 years of experience in structured finance,"" testified that the MRS-related opinions were 
rendered based upon the understanding of generally accepted accounting principles he has gained in his over  [**16] 20 years 
of experience in the field of municipal finance. Id. pp. 135-36."
439,8," Moreover, in November 2004, Xspand initially identified a list of 136 prime school districts that it would target. (Doc. 465-14). 
However, the March 1, 2005 letter was, according to Cerbus, distributed to 250 entities. Cerbus Dep. p. 99. Cerbus testified that "
440,," Xspand did not intend to follow-up with all of the recipients of the March 1, 2005 letter; instead, only certain entities were 
identified for follow-ups.  [**17] Id. p. 103."
440,9," While there is evidence that Xpsand's marketing campaign was designed to garner favorable government action in the form of 
increased business, we believe that the foregoing facts cast doubt upon Xpsand's true motive. As the Third Circuit has 
recognized, HN8[
] ""Motive may be relevant if it demonstrates the party acted without a legitimate desire for government 
action. . . ."" Bedell, 263 F.3d at 254 n. 33. Therefore, we believe that the ultimate applicability of the sham exception is an issue 
for the jury to decide."
440,10," HN9[
] ""To establish a Lanham Act claim based on a false or misleading representation of a product the plaintiff must show: 
(i) that the defendant has made false or misleading statements as to his  [**19] own product [or another's]; (ii) that there is actual 
deception or at least a tendency to deceive a substantial portion of the intended audience; (iii) that the deception is material in 
that it is likely to influence purchasing decisions; (iv) that the advertised goods traveled in interstate commerce; and (v) that there 
is a likelihood of injury to the plaintiff in terms of declining sales, loss of good will, etc."" Warner-Lambert  v. BreathAsure, Inc., 
204 F.3d 87, 91-92 (3d Cir. 2000) (emphasis added). We note briefly that, as we explain in greater detail in our resolution of the 
MRS Motion, to the extent MRS seeks monetary damages pursuant to its Lanham Act false advertising claim, it must adduce 
evidence of causation, i.e. actual consumer deception, regardless of whether the challenged marketing statement was ""literally 
false."" See, e.g., Gallup, Inc. v. Talentpoint, Inc., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18560, 2001 WL 1450592 *13 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (""Where 
plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, and shows that a claim is literally false, a court need not consider whether the public is misled. 
Where, however, a plaintiff seeks monetary damages, proof of actual deception is required."")."
440,11," HN10[
] ""The common law cause of action for unfair  [**20] competition in Pennsylvania mirrors the Lanham Act's section"
440,43," (a) cause of action for unfair competition, except that under state law there is no requirement that the goods traveled through 
interstate commerce."" Louis Vuitton Malletier & Oakley, Inc. v. Veit, 211 F.Supp.2d 567, 582 (E.D. Pa. 2002)."
440,12," HN11[
] ""In a defamation case, a plaintiff must prove: '(i) The defamatory character of the communication; (ii) its publication 
by the defendant; (iii) its application to the plaintiff; (iv) the understanding by the recipient of its defamatory meaning; (v) the 
understanding by the recipient of it as intended to be applied to the plaintiff; (vi) special harm resulting to the plaintiff from its 
publication; and (vii) abuse of a conditionally privileged occasion.'"" Moore v. Cobb-Nettleton, 2005 PA Super 426, 889 A.2d 
1262, 1267 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2005) (quoting Porter v. Joy Realty, Inc., 2005 PA Super 129, 872 A.2d 846, 849 n. 6 (Pa. Super. Ct. 
2005) (quoting 42 Pa.C.S. § 8343(a))). Falsity is an implicit element of a defamation cause of action because truth is an absolute 
defense. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 8343(b)."
440,13," HN12[
] ""In Pennsylvania, a claim for commercial disparagement requires proof that: (i) the statement is false; (ii) the 
publisher either  [**21] intends the publication to cause pecuniary loss or reasonably should recognize that publication will result 
in pecuniary loss; (iii) pecuniary loss does in fact result; and (iv) the publisher either knows that the statement is false or acts in 
reckless disregard of its truth or falsity."" McNulty v. Citadel Broadcasting Co., 58 Fed. Appx. 556, 567 (3d Cir. 2003) (emphasis 
added) (citing Neurotron Inc. v. Medical Serv. Ass'n of Pa., 254 F.3d 444 (3d Cir. 2001))."
440,14, Xspand has filed a currently pending motion in limine to this extent. (Doc. 441). 
441,15," Insofar as MRS' literal falsity argument involves Xspand's representation regarding a business relationship with the city of 
Allentown, we note that Xspand has already admitted the falsity  [**23] of this statement. However, MRS has not adduced any 
evidence indicating that this statement induced anyone to abandon a potential business relationship with MRS in favor of one 
with Xspand. Accordingly, as is evident from our causation analysis, infra, this averment cannot support any of the claims in the 
complaint because MRS cannot establish causation as to it. Consequently, we need not further address it in the instant context."
441,16," Expert testimony would be required even if a reasonable person could interpret Xspand's statement in the manner suggested 
by MRS because, even in that event, the statement would not be ""literally false."" HN14[
] ""In analyzing whether an 
advertisement . . . is literally false, a court must determine, first, the unambiguous claims made by the advertisement . . . and, 
second, whether those claims are false."" Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharms. Co., 
290 F.3d 578, 586 (3d Cir. 2002). Accordingly, since Xspand's marketing statement is reasonably susceptible to the 
interpretation suggested by Xspand, in which case the statement would not be false if MRS customers improperly booked 
proceeds from MRS-facilitated transactions as revenue,  [**24] the statement is not ""unambiguous"" and cannot therefore be 
literally false for Lanham Act purposes. See id.; see also Schering-Plough Healthcare Prods. v. Neutrogena Corp.,     F. Supp. 
2d    , 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24511, 2010 WL 960635 * 3 (D. Del. 2010). As we state in our discussion of the MRS Motion, infra, 
most of Xspand's statements are not ""literally false"" for this reason."
441,17," When asked what the basis for this conclusion was, Herron responded, ""The blue book, Governmental Accounting and 
Auditing-what do you call it?  [**26] The blue book."" Herron Dep., November 15, 2005, 24:4-25:13."
441,18," Herron's testimony is uniquely vital to MRS' claims because we do not perceive that it has provided testimony from any other 
individual as to the actual falsity of Xspand's statements. "
442,19," Xspand's decision to table the expert deposition of Herron was rendered on the apparent assumption that the expert opinion of 
Herron was not implicated in the resolution of the pending summary judgment motions because MRS did not rely on it in 
opposing said motions. (See Doc. 511). However, in resolving a motion for summary judgment, the Court is not constrained to 
consider only those arguments interposed by counsel. MRS' failure to argue the impact of Herron's testimony does not preclude 
us from considering the same. Herron's testimony regarding the falsity of Xspand's statements is clearly relevant to the proper 
resolution of the pending motions."
442,20," Since the motion in limine seeking to exclude Herron as an expert cannot be resolved before the taking of his ""expert"" 
deposition, and indeed since that deposition may or may not obviate the need for the motion, we believe that the better course is 
to deny the pending motion (Doc. 441) with express  [**27] leave to re-file within 30 days of receiving the transcript from Herron's 
expert deposition."
442,21," We do not believe that this procedure prejudices Xspand because, as its motion in limine seeking the exclusion of Herron's 
testimony indicates, it recognized the importance of Herron's testimony but elected instead to have us decide the instant motions 
without deciding the motion in limine first."
442,22," The elements of the causes of action in Count I-IV were articulated above. As is evident, each of them requires proof of 
causation. The fifth cause of action, contained in Count V of the amended complaint, is tortious interference with prospective 
contractual relations. HN15[
] ""The requisite elements of a cause of action for interference with prospective contractual 
relations are as follows: (i) a  [**28] prospective contractual relationship; (ii) the purpose or intent to harm the plaintiff by 
preventing the relation from occurring; (iii) the absence of privilege or justification on the part of the defendant; and (iv) the 
occasioning of actual damage resulting from the defendant's conduct."" Phillips v. Selig, 2008 PA Super 244, 959 A.2d 420, 428 
(Pa. Super. Ct. 2008) (citations omitted). Accordingly, it is clear that this cause of action also requires proof of causation. "
443,23," Further, other portions of Mr. Herron's testimony indicate that he was in the midst of a process involving the release of 
information from various tax claim bureaus, a process that in his experience rapidly culminated in a sale, with seven to ten 
schools districts when the March 1, 2005 letter was distributed. See Herron Dep. June 1, 2005, 231:23-232:11. After the receipt 
of the letter, a number of those districts ""slowed down"" their discussions with MRS. See id. 232:11-233:15. Although Herron's 
testimony does not explicitly indicate that the March 1, 2005 letter caused the ""slow downs,"" given the numerosity and timing of 
the alleged ""slow downs,"" we believe that a jury could reasonably infer that they were engendered by Xspand's marketing 
 [**31] letter. Further, to the extent that these districts elected not to contract with MRS, we believe that, given the historical 
progression of the process that the March 1, 2005 interrupted, the afore-referenced testimony could lead a reasonable jury to 
conclude that MRS was harmed by Xspand's marketing statements. "
444,24," Xspand offers no legal authority to support this conclusion, nor can we locate any."
444,25," At this time, we note that to the extent that Xspand contends that the afore-quoted statement is inadmissible because Herron 
cannot identify the declarant, such a proposition is incorrect. See Callahan v. A.E. V., Inc., 182 F.3d 237 (3d Cir. 1999) (""We do 
not think that the admissibility of their statements under the Rule 803(3) hearsay exception depends on their being identified. 
Knowing the specific identity of the declarant will not make the statements more trustworthy evidence of the  [**35] declarant's 
descriptions of their states of mind, the primary concern in interpreting hearsay exceptions.""). "
445,26," The proscription against use of extrinsic evidence in determining whether a statement crosses the line from disparagement 
into defamation seems to be at odds  [**37] with the general notion that in determining whether a statement is capable of 
defamatory meaning, courts are to ""consider the likely interpretation of the statement by the intended audience,"" Baker v. 
Lafayette College, 350 Pa. Super. 68, 504 A.2d 247 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986), as well as the context in which the statement is 
made, Beckman v. Dunn, 276 Pa. Super. 527, 419 A.2d 583, 586 (Pa. Super Ct. 1981). However, we believe that these rules 
can be synthesized in the following manner. HN21[
] While extrinsic evidence cannot be used when determining whether a 
statement denigrates the products or vendor, it can be taken into consideration after determining that the statement denigrates 
the vendor, i.e., only after the court determines that the statement is of a type that could be capable of defamatory meaning. In 
that case, the context in which the statement is made is important in determining whether the statement is capable of defamatory 
meaning. This conclusion is buttressed by our recognition that all the cases cited by MRS for the proposition that ""any 
communications by a competitor that imputes a want of integrity in business dealings are certainly capable of a defamatory 
meaning"" involve situations where the communication, in  [**38] isolation, give rise to the inference of dishonesty. See, e.g., 
Steaks Unlimited, Inc. v. Deaner, 623 F.2d 264 (3d Cir. 1980) (the denigrating television broadcast itself contained statements 
that readily questioned the honesty of plaintiff's advertising); Tucker v. Phila. Daily News, 848 A.2d at 124 (inherent implausibility 
of the ideas communicated by the statements at issue were capable of making the plaintiffs look insincere, excessively litigious, 
avaricious, and perhaps unstable); Cosgrove Studio & Camera Shop v. Pane, 408 Pa. 314, 182 A.2d 751 (Pa.1962) (""no 
extrinsic proof was necessary to indicate the injurious character of the communication"")."
445,27," Indeed, we read U.S. Healthcare to hold that in order HN22[
] for a statement to cross the line from a disparagement of 
product to defamation of vendor, the statement itself must either expressly or impliedly allege that the plaintiff is dishonest or 
otherwise disreputable."
445,28," Notwithstanding our conclusion, and as such set forth in the section that follows, these statements may denigrate product 
quality and could therefore be used to support a commercial disparagement claim. "
446,29," HN24[
] A ""prospective contractual relationship"" is ""something less than a contractual right, something more than a mere 
hope"" and exists when there is ""reasonable probability that a contract will arise from the parties' current dealings."" Alvord-Polk, 
Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co., 37 F.3d 996, 1015 (3d Cir. 1994) (citations omitted)."
446,30," Additionally, as indicated in our hearsay discussion, supra, Mr. Herron's testimony indicates that he was in the midst of a 
process involving the release of information from various tax claim bureaus, a sequence that historically proceeds rapidly and 
culminates in a sale, with seven to ten schools districts when the March 1, 2005 letter was distributed. See Herron Dep. June 1, 
2005, 231:23-232:11. After the receipt of the letter, a number of those districts ""slowed down"" their discussions with MRS. See 
id. 232:11-233:15. Although Herron's testimony does not explicitly indicate that the March 1, 2005 letter caused the ""slow 
downs,"" given the numerosity and timing of alleged ""slow downs,"" we believe that a jury could reasonably infer that they were 
engendered by Xspand's marketing letter. Further, given the historical progression of the process that the March 1, 2005 
interrupted, we believe that the afore-referenced testimony could lead a reasonable jury to determine that MRS had ""reasonable 
expectations"" of entering into a contractual  [**45] relationship with those seven to ten school districts. To the extent that these "
447,," school districts ultimately decided not to contract with MRS, we believe a reasonable jury could determine that MRS suffered 
harm, meaning MRS has a cognizable tortious interference claim. "
448,31," Commerce, Harrisburg, which we have been referring to as ""Commerce,"" and Commerce Bank, New Jersey (""Commerce New 
Jersey"") are separate organizations, however, the former is a franchise of the latter. Corner Dep., 6:11-24. Corner is a former 
executive with Commerce. Id."
448,32," Commerce New Jersey was involved in the initial transaction because it had an appreciably larger lending capacity than 
Commerce. See Herron Dep., Nov. 15, 2005, 17:20-24."
448,33," This determination is not inconsistent with our conclusion involving causation. There, we were faced with a situation where a 
multitude of school districts, which embarked upon a course that historically concluded with the rapid consummation of a 
contract, decided to slow down, and in some cases, abandon, the contract formation process after receiving Xspand's March 1, 
2005 letter. In that instance, we concluded that the numerosity and timing of the school  [**50] board's decisions, which 
contravened historical patterns, could reasonably lead a jury to infer that the March 1, 2005 letter caused the change in the 
school boards' actions. Here, we lack the numerosity and historical pattern upon which our causation determination was 
predicated. Further, unlike the situation implicated in our causation analysis, the present determination does not involve direct 
testimony establishing a causal link between Xspand's marketing conduct and the alleged harm suffered by MRS. Quite simply, 
the fact that the single Event A (Florio phone call) occurred before Event B (Commerce New Jersey's change of course) in and 
of itself does not mean that Event A caused Event B. Such reasoning exemplifies the post hoc ergopropter hoc logical fallacy. "
449,34," Specifically, Bear contends that throughout the discovery process MRS has maintained a belief that Bear can be held liable for 
illegal campaign contributions, in violation Rule G-37 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (""MSRB""). (Doc. 454 p. 12)."
449,35," The closest Plaintiff comes to properly pleading its Rule G-37 allegations are the statements contained in paragraph 15 of its 
amended complaint. That paragraph states, in part, ""Defendant . . . uses former Governor Florio's political connections to 
generate business from taxing entities. In addition to utilizing such contacts to 'open doors' to allow Xspand access to 
government taxing entities . . . Florio also uses his political contacts to disparage . . . Plaintiff's business.""  [**55] Amend Compl. 
P 15. However, this paragraph, even if construed liberally, cannot reasonably be said to put Defendants on notice that Plaintiff's 
case involves, in part, an allegation of illegal campaign contributions."
449,36," If Plaintiff learned of the alleged Rule G-37 violations through the discovery process, it was free to seek inclusion of such 
allegations in its amended complaint through a properly filed motion to amend that pleading pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 15. Unfortunately for Plaintiff, it did not do so. Accordingly, it shall be precluded from lodging these allegations at this 
late stage of litigation. "
450,37," John Garzone (""Garzone"") is the former senior managing director of Bear. Garzone Decl. P 1."
450,38," A provision of the Term Sheet specifically establishes: Except with the confidentiality provision contained herein, this Summary of Terms is not intended to constitute a legally 
binding agreement . . . and does not contain all of the detailed terms which will be included in the definitive agreements. A 
binding obligation will come into existence only upon the execution of the definitive agreements. (Doc. 454, Ex. 1, at Ex. A, p. 19) (emphasis added). Accordingly, since the Term Sheet was never implemented, by its own 
language it did  [**58] not create binding obligations between Bear and Plymouth Financial."
450,39," Although Bear indicates that the agreement between Plymouth Park and  [**59] Plymouth Financial as Exhibit B to Exhibit 1 of 
document 454, that document unfortunately is absent."
450,40," Documents supplementing the asset purchase agreement indicate that Garzone was the President of Plymouth Park. (Doc. 
454-2, pp. 36-40). "
451,41," Here again, we note that while Xspand's representation regarding a business relationship with the city of Allentown was 
literally false, the same cannot support any of the claims in the complaint because MRS has not established causation as to it. 
Accordingly, we need not address it any further in the present context. "
452,42," This statement indicates that the transaction in question was facilitated by MRS, as it used Commerce Bank to finance its 
transaction with the Harrisburg School District."
452,43," Xspand asserts that the statement was intended to read ""The liability should appear on the balance sheet . . ."" (Doc. 472 p. 
12). This supposed ""typographical error"" does not implicate a misspelling or a transposition of words; it involves the complete 
omission of a word that substantially changes the meaning of the declaration. Given the allegations made by MRS,  [**64] we 
believe that the jury is entitled to determine the nature of the error contained in the FAQ."
452,44," Xspand asserts that MRS can only seek money damages because Xspand has stopped circulating the advertisements in 
question, meaning there  [**66] is no basis for an injunction. MRS, on the other hand, asserts that even if Xspand has stopped 
misrepresenting the nature of MRS-facilitated transactions, that does not moot the need for injunctive relief. It contends that 
since the effect of Xspand's marketing statements lasted for years, it is entitled to a court-ordered state-wide retraction of 
Xspand's false statements, even at this late date, which is approximately 5 years after Xspand's marketing campaign 
commenced. Neither party has cited any authority regarding the appropriateness, or lack thereof, of the contemplated injunctive 
relief, and Xspand has not explicitly requested summary judgment on this issue. It is accordingly unnecessary to discourse 
further about it within our analysis."
452,45," MRS challenges this statement of law on several fronts. First, it cites Facenda v. NFL Films, Inc., 542 F.3d 1007 (3d Cir. 
2008), and Santana Prods., 401 F.3d at 136, for the proposition that proof of actual deception is not necessary in a § 43(a)(1)(B) 
Lanham Act false advertising claim when plaintiff proves literal falsity. However, this statement in Facenda arose in dicta, as that "
453,," case actually involved a § 43(a)(1)(A) Lanham Act false-endorsement  [**67] claim. Indeed, the Third Circuit admitted that the 
standards governing § 43(a)(1)(B) and § 43(a)(1)(A) are often different. See Facenda, 542 F.3d at 1021. Further, the relevant 
portion of Facenda quotes Fisons Horticulture, Inc. v. Vigoro Indus.., 30 F.3d 466, 472 n.8 (3d Cir. 1994). In footnote 8, the 
Fisions Court cited to Johnson & Johnson-Merck Consumer Pharms. Co. v. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Pharms., Inc., 19 F.3d 125 
(3d Cir. 1994), and Sandoz Pharm. Corp. v. Richardson-Vicks, Inc., 902 F.2d 222 (3d Cir. 1990), both of which involved 
injunctions. Additionally, the proposition as it is found in Santana Products is accompanied by a citation to Johnson & Johnson. 
Accordingly, MRS' citation to Facenda and Santana Products does not alter our opinion that it must establish actual deception to 
succeed on its § 43(a)(1)(B) Lanham Act false advertising claim. Second, MRS cites various cases from foreign jurisdictions for the proposition that where there is willfully false advertising, as is 
purportedly the situation in the case at bar, there is a presumption of damages. See Porous Media Corp. v. Pall Corp., 110 F.3d 
1329, 1336 (8th Cir. 1997); Trilink Saw Chain, LLC v. Blount, Inc., 583 F. Supp. 2d 1293, 2008 WL 4261040 *20 (N.D. Ga. 
2008);  [**68] Heidi Ott A.G. v. Target Corp., 153 F.Supp. 2d 1055, 1072 (D. Minn. 2001). Notably, MRS has failed to cite any 
authority in our Circuit for this proposition. Further, to the extent that this proposition is interposed as an attempt to establish that 
proof of actual customer deception occurred, such a contention squarely conflicts with the above-cited Third Circuit authority 
establishing that plaintiffs must prove actual customer confusion/deception in order to recover money damages for a Lanham Act 
false advertising claim. Therefore, we find Plaintiff's argument on this point unavailing. "
488,2," The instant decision shall not be construed as having any direct, that is, immediately dispositive, effect on Plaintiffs' claims 
raised against all Defendants that did not file the Motions at bar (""Residual Defendants""). The Court, however, reserves any 
determination as to indirect applicability of the instant decision to Plaintiffs' claims against the Residual Defendants; for instance, 
the Court reserves its decision as to whether Plaintiffs' claims against the Residual Defendants -- or certain aspects of such 
Plaintiffs' claims -- might be barred from enforcement by the operation of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. "
489,3," No allegations made in the Amended Complaint suggest that Plaintiffs made any effort to buy, specifically, magnesite of 
Chinese origin (or to avoid buying Chinese magnesite); rather, it appears that Plaintiffs were: (a) buying magnesite regardless of "
490,," the product's origin:  [**11] and (b) driven only by their interest in obtaining the particular magnesite-based products Plaintiffs 
needed at the cheapest price these products were available. See generally, Am. Compl. The voluminous attachments to 
Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint indicate that Chinese magnesite-based products were indeed the cheapest in the world market, 
and Plaintiffs never asserted otherwise. See Docket Entry No. 77. Rather, the financial point of Plaintiffs' legal claims could be 
reduced to the statement that the Chinese magnesite-base products were not as cheap as they could have been had 
Defendants not entered into the alleged collusive agreement(s). See id. § 29. "
491,4," Notably,HN7[
]  if a restraint is per se illegal, no examination of the practice's impact on the market is necessary for finding of anti-competitive effects within relevant product and geographic markets, see Pace Elecs., Inc. v. Canon Computer Sys., Inc., 
213 F.3d 118, 123 (3d Cir. 2000), which means, in turn, that no aspect even vaguely resembling the ""direct, substantial and 
reasonably foreseeable effect"" of the FTAIA can possibly arise. "
493,5," The Conley court held that a district court was permitted to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim only if ""it appear[ed] 
beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which  [**24] would entitle him to relief."" Conley v. 
Gibson, 355 U.S. at 45-46. Under this ""no set of facts"" standard, a complaint could effectively survive a motion to dismiss so 
long as it contained a bare recitation of the claim's legal elements."
493,6," This Court is not aware of any legal decision addressing the effect of Iqbal on the standard applicable to the factual Rule 12 
challenges, as they are defined in Turicentro. However, it appears logical for the Supreme Court's guidance in Iqbal to have at 
least a ripple effect on the standard applicable to factual challenges. Since the Supreme Court in Iqbal expressly guided that a 
plaintiff cannot obtain discovery with regard to his/her claims unless the plaintiff actually spells out the facts underlying these 
claims, the same guidance -- if applied to factual rather than facial review -- must yield the rule that a plaintiff cannot obtain 
discovery with regard to evidence verifying jurisdiction. Indeed, concluding otherwise invites a scenario where the plaintiff, being 
charged with the duty to actually produce jurisdictional evidence, is nonetheless permitted to flatly admit that (s)he has no such 
evidence and that all (s)he can do is to speculate in  [**25] his/her pleadings that such evidence might be discovered. In other 
words, allowing the plaintiff to conduct discovery for the purposes of factual challenge would result in an anomalous rule granting 
the plaintiff a broader pleading latitude for the purposes of the test under which the plaintiff's pleadings are not even granted 
presumption of truth. "
495,7," Several courts noted this question without answering it, e.g.,  [**33] the Supreme Court did so in Hartford Fire, noting that the 
effects test is well established, see, 509 U.S. at 796, and observing -- in a footnote -- that the facts of Hartford Fire did not 
require the Court to address the question of ""whether the [FTAIA's] 'direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect' 
standard amends existing law or merely codifies it."" Id. at 796 n.23. After so concluding, the Court quickly turned to the issue of 
whether principles of international comity should have prevented the exercise of jurisdiction, see id. at 797; the swiftness of the 
Court's transition perhaps made the value of Hartford Fire less obvious for the purposes of the FTAIA."
495,8," HN16[
] The FTAIA test neither reversed nor even diluted the ""intent-to-affect-and-effect-in-fact"" common law principle 
established in Alcoa/Hartford Fire. Cf. United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, 534, 113 S. Ct. 1631, 123 L. Ed. 2d 245 (1993) 
(""[S]tatutes which invade the common law [are] to be read with a presumption favoring the retention of long-established and 
familiar principles, except when the statutory purpose to the contrary is evident""). Rather, the FTAIA spelled out additional -- 
perhaps already implied but not articulated in Alcoa -- elements.  [**34] See Biotechnologies, 379 F.3d at 680, n.6 (""the dissent 
does not argue that the effects need not be direct, but rather that the 'meant to affect' requirement has always been part of the 
'effects test' [of Alcoa]. Thus, the panel agrees on the standard; we merely disagree about its source. We say it is the FTAIA, 
while the dissent says the common law. We all recognize that conduct related to international trade is exempt from the Sherman 
Act unless it has a 'direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect' on domestic commerce""). "
496,9," The Biotechnologies court also observed that the process of ""[a]pplying Alcoa [in lieu of the FTAIA] might also ignore the words 
'reasonably foreseeable,' although we recognize that foreseeability might be a concept inherent in any scheme that seeks to 
impose liability."" Biotechnologies, 379 F.3d at 679, n.4."
496,10," The Court is mindful that the ""intended/meant-to-affect"" aspect retained by the FTAIA from Alcoa/Hartford Fire does not have 
immediate lingual correspondence to the word ""substantial,"" which is an element of the exception language provided in 
subsection (1)(A). Indeed, it appears that the word ""direct"" might be of better use to convey the sense of intent to affect. 
However, the Court finds it improper to switch the meanings of the terms ""direct"" and ""substantial"" as they were articulated by 
the Supreme Court in Alcoa/Hartford Fire  [**36]  and in Republic of Argentina v. Weltover. Therefore, the Court retains the 
Supreme Court's meaning of these terms and, with an eye on clarity of its decisions, utilizes the words ""substantiality"" and 
""directness"" as references to the tests offered by the Supreme Court."
496,11, See infra note 57 for a detailed discussion of Dee-K Enters. and its particular relevance to certain aspects of the claims at bar. 
497,12," Since Plaintiffs in this matter are not pro se litigants but rather are represented by counsel, the Court need not examine the 
Amended Complaint for statements vaguely indicating assertions of facts, compare Royce v. Hahn, 151 F.3d 116, 118 (3d Cir. 
1998) (guiding that pro se pleadings ""must be construed liberally and with a measure of tolerance""), and presumes that Plaintiffs' 
Opposition correctly directed the  [**40] Court's attention to the statements in the Amended Complaint which Plaintiffs deem 
support their position under subsection (1)(A)."
497,13," Granted that Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint systemically utilizes the term ""Cartel"" and, moreover, keeps referring to such 
""Cartel"" as a single and continuously existing entity, the Court finds it useful to trace the history of this ""Cartel,"" as painted by 
Plaintiffs. The following discussion, however, shall not be construed as expressing the Court's position that an actual -- or a 
single and continuing cartel (or even a numbers of cartels) -- existed; this issue is expressly reserved to be resolved in the event 
the Court has to address Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims. First, relying on certain sources, Plaintiffs assert that, on April 9, 2000, 
Xiyang Refractory Materials, Yingkou Huachen, Dalian Golden Sun and Liaoning Foreign Trade, plus nine unspecified entities, 
established first ""sub-Cartel"" named ""Jiyuan Magnesite Group,"" while Defendants Liaoning Liayi and Haicheng Huayu, plus non-
defendant Shenyang Metals, established another ""sub-Cartel"" named ""Huaxia Magnesite Group."" See Am. Compl. PP 52-53. 
Then, without stating their factual source, Plaintiffs  [**41] assert that ""[o]n February 19, 2001, the Jiyuan and Huaxia Magnesite 
Groups formally established a single, unified group under the name 'Chinese Magnesite Export Association' ('Cartel'). . . . The 
[resulting joint] Cartel comprised 23 exporting companies, including [eighteen unspecified entities and] Haicheng Pailou [not 
listed as a member of either ""sub-Cartel""], Yingkou Huachen, Xiyang Group [not listed in either ""sub-Cartel""], Haicheng Houying 
[not listed in either ""sub-Cartel""] and Haicheng Huayu."" Id. P 57. Then Plaintiffs allege, without specifying their source, that ""[o]n 
March 22, 2003, at least 19 exporting companies [that is, the amount of companies less than the 23 companies comprising the 
alleged unified Cartel], including Liaoning Jiayi [resurrected from the second 'sub-Cartel'], Haycheng Houyin[g], Yingkou 
Huachen[], Dailan Golden Sun [resurrected from the first 'sub-Cartel'], China Minmetals [not included in the previous versions of 
'Cartel' or in any 'sub-Cartel'], China Minerals [not included in the previous versions of 'Cartel' or in any 'sub-Cartel'], Sinosteel "
498,," Trading [not included in the previous versions of 'Cartel' or in any 'sub-Cartel'], Xiyang Pacific [not  [**42] included in the 
previous versions of 'Cartel' or in any 'sub-Cartel'] and Haicheng Huayu met in Shenyang, China[,] to discuss and forecast price 
trend for the year 2003."" Id. P 59. Plaintiffs then allege that ""[t]he members of the [presumably, this ""discussion/ forecasting 
group""] agreed . . . to have [a new version of] the Cartel establish[ed] . . . under the name the 'China Magnetic Forum.'"" Id. Next, 
citing certain sources, Plaintiffs maintain that, ""[o]n February 1, 2004, [unspecified] members of the [presumably, the latest 
version of] the Cartel [that] includ[ed] Defendants Sinosteel Trading, Xiyang Group [resurrected from the original version of the 
Cartel], Haicheng Huaya, Haicheng Houying [resurrected from the original version of the Cartel] and Jiachen Group [not included 
in either version of the Cartel or in any 'sub-Cartel'] met under yet another name calling themselves the 'China Magnesite Self-
Disciplined Association."" Id. P 62. After so stating, Plaintiffs claim that unspecified members of an unspecified transformation of 
this ever-changing Cartel ""reached [an agreement sometime] in November 2006, to increase the price of exported [magnesite-
based products]."" Id. P 63.  [**43] Finally, citing no sources, Plaintiffs state that, ""[o]ver the weekend of December 9-10, 2006, 
[unspecified number of the members of this ever-changing] Cartel, including Xiyang Group, Haicheng Huaya, Haicheng Houying 
and Jiachen Group met and agreed to increase prices"" on magnesite-based products. Id. Citing an Internet article, Plaintiffs 
conclude the foregoing discussion with the statement that, sometime ""[i]n February 2007, [unspecified] members of [this ever-
changing] Cartel met to discuss a possible agreement to increase the export price."" Id. P 64. Although Plaintiffs assert that the 
""Cartel"" is still operative, see id., P 3, they do not describe any post-February-2007 memberships, meetings or activities of the 
""Cartel."" See also note 146, infra."
498,14," While the Amended Complaint states that ""Defendants' co-conspirators include[d] Rongyuan Magnesite Corporation of China, 
subsequently renamed Shangawa Rongyuan Refractories Co., Ltd, Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Material Co., Ltd., subsequently 
renamed Yingkou Wonjin Refractory Material Co., Ltd., Shenyang Metals and Minerals, and CITIC Trading,"" the Amended 
Complaint does not explain why these entities are not named as Defendants, same as it does not clarify whether any other entity 
exporting Chinese magnesite might be included in the list of such non-liable ""co-conspirators."" See Am. Compl. P 28. On the 
contrary, the Amended Complaint makes passim reference to unspecified ""co-conspirators"" (hence suggesting that such 
references are unrelated to the entities listed in Paragraph Twenty Eight). Plaintiffs' systemic reference to unspecified co-
conspirators of Defendants, especially if assessed in light of the ever-changing composition of the alleged ""Cartel,"" leaves the 
list of ""co-conspirators"" to the Court's imagination and necessarily invites a possibility that all Chinese exporters of magnesite 
products -- regardless of whether or  [**45] not they were identified in the Amended Complaint -- could be such ""co-
conspirators""; this possibility, in turn, lends support to Defendants' assertion that all Chinese exporters of magnesite-based 
products were subject to compulsory price regulations governing export of Chinese magnesite-based products, as discussed 
infra, note 139 of this Opinion. "
500,15," The Court is mindful of a possibility that this factlessly asserted 70 percent, if real, might be a ""high-tide"" scenario, since 
Plaintiffs concede that Chinese world-wide export of magnesite-based products differed rather significantly over the years 
relevant  [**52] to Plaintiffs' claims. See Am. Compl. P 46 (relying on United States surveys for assertion that ""China's share of 
annual world production has increased from 32 percent in 2001 to 45 percent in 2007,"" i.e., grew 13%). If the overall volume of 
Chinese magnesite-based export varied by more than 50%, the Court has no reason to presume that the exportation share of 
Defendants (and their specified and unspecified co-conspirators, if any) did not fluctuate in the same fashion or even more 
dramatically."
500,16," Defendants correctly point out the mathematical error in Plaintiffs' calculation of what share of 2 million tons of Chinese overall 
exportation in 2006 was represented by 300 thousand tons imported during that year by the United States: while Plaintiffs assert 
that 300,000 is a quarter of 2 million, Defendants correctly observe that it is only 15%."
500,17," The Court reads Plaintiffs' reliance on their Exhibit 2 as an assertion that Defendants were exporters not of crude magnesite 
but rather of magnesium oxide. Magnesium oxide is a product qualitatively different from magnesite; this is so because 
""magnesite"" is a layperson's term for magnesium carbonate, the composition having chemical symbol ""MgCO[3],""  [**53] while 
the layperson's term ""magnesia"" designates what is technically known as ""magnesium oxide,"" the composition having chemical 
formula ""MgO."" Magnesium oxide can be obtained from magnesium carbonate by heating magnesite to 700 [degrees] C to 1000 
[degrees] C, which causes decomposition of magnesite into magnesium oxide and carbon dioxide (alternatively, magnesium 
oxide can be obtained, upon introduction of calcined dolime and heat, through a chain of chemical reactions processing 
seawater and brine containing magnesium chloride.) See, e.g., <<http://www.magnesia specialties.com/students.htm>>. The 
report of Plaintiffs' expert, see Docket Entry No. 28-6, relied upon by Plaintiffs in Paragraph Sixty-Five, discussed infra, similarly 
suggests that Defendants were exporters of magnesium oxide rather than of crude magnesite, since the report takes pains to "
501,," inform the Court that ""[h]eating magnesite to a temperature between 700 [degrees] C and 1000 [degrees] C [produces] caustic 
calcined magnesia,"" while ""[f]urther heating [to] temperatures between 1500 [degrees] C and 2000 [degrees] C produces . . . [so-
]called dead-burned magnesia,"" and ""electro-fused magnesia . . . is created by heating  [**54] magnesite [to] about 2,800 
[degrees] C for several continuous hours."" Docket Entry No. 28-6, at 5. "
503,18," Contrary to the claim asserted in Paragraph Forty-Eight, the table verifies that the share of Chinese magnesite (even if 
assessed collectively with regard to all types of magnesite-based products) in the magnesite-based goods imported by the 
United States during any given year from 2000 to 2006 never reached, and certainly never exceeded, 500,000 metric tons. It 
appears that Plaintiffs failed to distinguish between the columns titled ""All Countries"" and ""China."""
503,19," The Court notes the practical anomaly of the legal position advocated  [**58] by Plaintiffs. The bulk of evidence submitted in 
this matter suggests, rather unambiguously, that magnesite-based products of Chinese origin have been consistently the 
cheapest on the global market. This fact, apparently, has been prompting United States importers to buy predominantly the "
504,," goods of Chinese origin. That predominant purchasing election, in turn, caused the predominance of Chinese goods in United 
States overall importation of magnesite-based products, even though it occurred with what seems to be complete neutrality of 
Chinese exporters who, it appears, were willing to sell their magnesite-based product to any buyer, regardless of whether such 
buyer was domestic or foreign, or of a particular foreign origin. Yet, Plaintiffs invite this Court to find that the purchasing elections 
made by United States importers somehow show that Chinese sellers meant to affect United States commerce. "
505,20," The Court also notes, in passing, that an alleged fact of sale of goods to an importer who might bring the goods into the United 
States in no way shows the seller's intent to affect the United States commerce unless there are facts showing that the seller 
actually sought to sell to (i.e., discriminated in favor of sales to) the buyers bringing the goods into  [**64] the United States. See 
Fowler, 578 F.3d at 210-11 (""[w]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of 
misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not 'show[n]'-'that the pleader is entitled to relief"") (quoting Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 
1949-50) (emphasis supplied). "
506,21," See 
December 
Opinion 
at 
50 
(quoting 
a 
United 
States 
government 
survey, 
see <<http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/magnesium/mgcmyb2001.pdf>>, showing that the decline of 2001 followed 
the spike in importation that took place in 2000, and explaining the reasons for a  [**66] significant increase in United States 
demand for imported magnesite-based goods in 2000)."
506,22," The Court already addressed this issue in its December Opinion detailing to Plaintiffs the operation of economic functions as 
follows: The ""supply and demand"" economic model describes the operations of market mechanism. It is graphically represented 
through two curved functions which, if read jointly, reflect the understanding that, in a competitive market, price will function 
to equalize supply and demand. The model neither requires all producers to sell comparable goods at the same price nor 
implies that a decline in demand would force all producers to lower their prices: the leeway available to sellers depends on 
price elasticity of their goods. Thus, if demand for certain goods begins to decline, the sellers offering their goods at the 
upper-bracket prices would be forced to lower them (or go out of business if competitive prices become so low to render 
their businesses unprofitable), while the sellers offering their goods at lower-bracket prices do not have to change their 
pricing policies -- and may even legitimately increase their prices -- until the demand drops to such a point that there 
 [**67] is not enough market even for the goods they sell. To illustrate, if tomato growers who previously sold their crop for $ 
1.00 to $ 2.00 per pound are faced with a market decline, the growers who were selling at $ 2.00 per pound would have to 
lower their prices in order to compete for the shrunk market (or to leave the business if they cannot afford reduction in 
price), while the growers who were selling at $ 1.00 per pound would still be in the position to keep increasing their prices 
until the decline in demand becomes such that even these growers cannot sell their entire crop (at which point, these 
growers would have to either compete with each other by lowering their sale prices or reduce their production). Hence, 
Plaintiffs' argument that the gradual increase in the prices of Processed Magnesite imported from China during the 
Relevant Period was in contradiction to the rules of supply and demand is based on an incorrect reading of economic 
theories. Docket Entry No. 73, at 49-50. In addition to the foregoing, the hike in price might be unavoidable to a seller that finds itself 
suddenly burdened with rising cost of overhead, soaring fixed costs and variable costs unrelated to payroll  [**68] (e.g., rise in 
utilities charges), higher taxes, etc. -- such developments might cause the seller to shift the increase in cost of operation to the 
buyer regardless of demand, since the seller's failure to so shift the burden might simply result in a speedy bankruptcy. Accord 
id. at 42-46 (detailing to Plaintiffs the interplay between relevant economics and accounting concepts, and providing data 
showing dramatic increase in the labor-related, fixed and variable costs in Chinese magnesite industry). "
507,23," The Court notes that Plaintiffs attached to their Opposition an exhibit containing a copy of the document upon which Plaintiffs 
seemed to rely for the purposes of their $ 158 figure. The document contains a table showing that, basing their numbers on tariff 
and trade data from the United States Department of Commerce and the United States International Trade Commission, the 
unidentified-by-the-document entity compiling the table determined that prices of Chinese magnesium oxide were $ 0.1 per 
kilogram during the first quarter of 2000, $ 0.111 per kilogram during the second quarter, $ 0.136 during the third, and $ 0.158 
during the fourth quarter. See Docket Entry No. 105-36, at 2. Since Plaintiffs assert that the price at the end of 1999 was $ 104 
per ton, the Court gathers that Plaintiffs' position is that the  [**70] price dropped from $ 0.104 to $ 0.1 during the first quarter of 
2000 but then began climbing. Plaintiffs' Opposition addresses this climb as follows: ""The Government Survey provided yearly 
total import volumes and yearly average prices[, while the United States International Trade Commission's] quarterly data 
demonstrates [a price increase] consistent with Plaintiffs' allegation that the initial two export cartels were formed in April of 2000 
and succeeded in raising the price of magnesite exported to the United States."" Docket Entry No. 105. Plaintiffs' figures, if 
averaged, appear to be similar to the Survey's figure of $ 129.27 per ton (since the average of Plaintiffs' numbers results in $ 
126.25 per ton, and the $ 3.02 difference might be a result of a heavier export during the third and fourth quarters, although the 
Court cannot determine the same with any degree of certainty since Plaintiffs' exhibit does not provide quarterly import volume). 
However, the Court is not entirely clear as to Plaintiffs' point that the rise in the price of Chinese magnesium oxide in 2000 must 
be viewed as a proof of the ""Cartel's"" formation and initial activities. According to Plaintiffs' version  [**71] of the ""Cartel's"" 
history, the initial ""sub-Cartels"" solidified into a unified ""Cartel"" in February of 2001, muscling the largest membership during the 
entire ""Cartel's"" history, see supra note 13, which -- pursuant to Plaintiffs' logic -- should have resulted in further intensification of 
""Cartel's"" activities and further increase in import prices of Chinese magnesium oxide, but the United States Government Survey 
indicates that the 2001 price for Chinese magnesium oxide was $ 148.75 per metric ton (if calculated on the grounds of the total 
tonnage 
and 
total 
value 
stated 
in 
the 
Survey). 
See 
<<http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/ magnesium/mgcmyb2001.pdf>>. Thus -- if the Court were to adopt Plaintiffs' position that this $ 148.75 price is not the year-end 
price but merely a yearly average -- the increase of the alleged ""Cartel"" in size and in collusive activities should not have 
resulted in a progressive drop of prices during 2001 (since, if the price at the end of 2000's fourth quarter was $ 158 per ton, as 
Plaintiffs' exhibit alleges, than the price had to drop by the end of 2001 by 12.34%, i.e., down to $ 139.50 per ton, in order to 
yield the yearly average of $ 148.75  [**72] reflected in the Survey). "

] ""[T]he plaintiff may seek the Court's entry of default judgment under either [subpart of] Rule 55(b)."" Doug Brady, Inc. v. N.J. Bldg. Laborers Statewide Funds, 250 F.R.D. 171, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28324, at * 19 (D.N.J. April 7, 2008) (citing 
Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Starlight Ballroom Dance Club, Inc., 175 Fed. App'x 519, 521, n.1 (3d Cir. 2006). However, default 
judgment necessarily ensues from a party's failure ""to plead or otherwise defend"" against the allegations of his/her opponent. Id. 
at * 18-19 (detailing the first step of default procedure under Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a)). Although the second step of default allows 
the court to exercise its discretion in order to ""establish the truth of any allegation by evidence,"" see Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(b)(2)(C), 
an entry of default does not obligate the court to conduct a facial -- moreover factual -- review. Hence, while for the purposes of 
a litigant's default application, the litigant's expert may be warranted in his/her submission of the expert's opinion based on facts 
as they are pled by the litigant seeking default, it is indeed questionable at best whether the same is warranted for the purposes 
of a factual review under Rule 12."
508,25," This statement renders the applicability of the Report to the Amended Complaint questionable at best not only because Lamb 
fails to base his Report on independent facts but also because the Report unambiguously declares that it takes, as true, the 
facts stated in the Original Complaint, that is, in the set of pleadings which: (a) was dismissed by the Court for insufficiency of 
these very pleadings; and, even more importantly, (b) differed, and rather dramatically, from the Amended Complaint as to the 
factual assertions made therein. However, the Court ignores the anomaly of Plaintiffs' reliance on the Report based on different 
and dismissed facts in order to focus on the even more troubling deficiencies of Plaintiffs' utilization of Lamb's Report. "
509,26," CEH appears to be the key basis for Lamb's deducements. See Docket Entry No. 28-6 (citing CEH in 18 out of Report's 34 
footnotes).  [**83] However, no reproduction of CEH is attached to the Report, and the Court's efforts to locate CEH in a printed 
version yielded no success. The Court, however, located a website stating that it is a ""product review"" titled ""Magnesium Oxide 
and Other Magnesium Chemicals""; it is, apparently, authored by ""Stefan Schlag and Kenji Fujita and James Glauser"" of SRI 
Consulting. See <<http://www.sriconsulting.com/CEH/Public/Reports/747.2000/>>. The Court, therefore, presumes that Lamb 
referred to this online source as CEH. The CEH located by the Court online has the table of contents which, while listing 237 
sections and subsections, omits such features as ""list of sources"" and/or ""bibliography,"" thus leaving the Court to wonder 
whether CEH was based on data that could be deemed reliable for the purposes of legal proceedings."
509,27," Although Lamb's reference to ""a benchmark"" does not provide the Court with any clarification as to the actual methodology 
intended to be employed by Lamb (i.e., the Report only asserts that ""[t]he benchmark methodology is an accepted method for 
calculating damages in the field of antitrust economies"" and cites a 1967 article by Robert B. Bergstrom titled ""The Role of the 
 [**84] Expert in Proving and Disproving Damages in Antitrust Claims""), the Court presumes that the Report intended to use 
econometric benchmark analysis, a tool common in business management which is effectively a comparison of two or more sets 
of corresponding data. See, e.g., Robert C. Camp, Benchmarking: The Search for Industry Best Practices That Lead to Superior 
Performance (2006) (detailing the methodology and applications of the tool)."
509,28," Lamb, apparently, used the year 2000 as a breakpoint because -- relying on the Original Complaint -- he took it as a fact that 
pre-2000 sales of Chinese magnesium oxide were necessarily unaffected by Defendants' collusive activities but these sales 
became necessarily affected by Defendants' alleged conspiracy in 2000. "
510,29," Usually, benchmark analysis is used as an alternative to -- rather than in conjunction -- with regression analysis. See, e.g., In 
re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 313 (3d Cir. 2008) (""[Plaintiffs' expert] identified two 'potential approaches' to 
estimating damages, [either]: (1) benchmark analysis, which would compare actual prices during the alleged conspiracy with 
prices that existed before the [alleged conspiracy];  [**85] and [the second option is] (2) regression analysis, through which it 
'may be possible . . . to estimate the relationship between price of [the product allegedly affected by collusive activities] and the 
various market forces that influence prices, including demand and supply variables.' [Either one of] these methods, according to 
[Plaintiffs' expert], could be used to estimate the prices plaintiffs would have faced but for the conspiracy""). However, since a 
benchmark analysis suggested by Lamb seemingly envisioned a comparison of the overall trends in Chinese sales of 
magnesium oxide during the pre-alleged-conspiracy and the during-alleged-conspiracy periods, and regression analysis was 
seemingly meant only to adjust the during-alleged-conspiracy trend by removing effects of all conspiracy-unrelated 
developments that were absent during the pre-alleged-conspiracy period, the Court finds the possibility of joint utilization of 
these two methods not unreasonable, although the Court is left to wonder how these generic Chinese trends show intent of 
Defendants."
510,30," The Court's overview of regression analysis is based on Larry Wasserman, All  [**86] of Statistics: A Concise Course in 
Statistical Inference (Springer 2004) (""All Statistics""); Statistics, Super Review (Research and Educ. Assoc., M. Fogiel, Chief 
Editor 2004); Douglas Downing, Jeffrey Clark, Business Statistics (Barron's 4th ed. 2003) (""Business Statistics""); Douglas 
Downing, Jeffrey Clark, Statistics The Easy Way (Barron's 3rd ed., 1997) (""Easy Statistics"")."
510,31," Such relationship between two variables give base to so-called ""simple regression."""
510,32," Not all simple relationships could be reduced to y = mx + b. For instance, if the true relationship between x and y is defined by 
equation y = cd<x>, where both c and d are two unknown constants, the solution is obtained through the concept of logarithm. 
(An explanation of what is logarithm is best given by the question, ""to what power should we raise 2 to get 128?"" and its answer 
""7,"" because 2<7> = 128, so the logarithm, i.e., log[2] 128, is ""7""). Applying common logarithms to the equation y = cd<x>, we 
can rewrite it as log y = log d * x + log c, i.e., as a formula resembling the familiar y = mx + b. Thus, logarithms are frequently 
used in regression analysis. "
511,33," A calculation of multiple regression output also gives an R<2>  [**87] value which is called the coefficient of multiple 
determination. The value of R<2> is always between 0 and 1, it measures the percent variation in the dependent variable y that 
can be explained by the regression. The higher R<2>, the more it means that the regression does a good job accounting for the 
variation in y through variations in x[1] and x[2]."
511,34," The Court's own efforts to locate ""Industrial Minerals, a market research firm"" did not yield any success; the Court was merely 
able to locate a British-based online magazine titled ""Industrial Minerals"" at <<http://www.mineralnet.co.uk/>>."
511,35," I.e., Lamb, seemingly, took observations corresponding to 156 periods, since the 13 years (from 1994 to 2007), multiplied by 
12 months per year, yield 156 monthly intervals."
511,36," See infra sub-paragraph (xiii) of this subsection for a discussion of the problems associated with the ""three panels,"" the phrase 
which, it seems, might have been used by Lamb to refer to the very same data that Lamb alternatively designated as his ""three 
price series."""
511,37," However, the sole ""other publicly available"" source named by Lamb is the very same CEH, see Docket Entry No. 28-6, at 11, 
n. 30, the reliability of which the Court cannot determine. See supra note 26 of this Opinion. "
512,38," The Court is not familiar with the concept of ""World Foreign Exchange Rate,"" and the Report does not enlighten the Court as 
to the nature of this tool. However, in light of Lamb's mentioning  [**91] of the International Monetary Fund (""IMF"") in connection 
with this tool, the Court presumes that Lamb aimed to refer to the Special Drawing Rights (""SDRs""). An SDR (which is a unit of 
account created by the IMF) is a weighted sum of contributions of four major currencies, and it is adjusted every five years (for 
instance, for the period of 2006-2010, one SDR is the sum of 0.632 US dollars, 0.41 euro, 18.4 Japanese yen and 0.0903 pound 
sterling, while for the period 2001-2005 it was 0.577 US dollars, 0.426 euro, 21 Japanese yen and 0.0984 pound sterling). See 
<<http://www.imf.org/external/fin.htm>> (IMF-Finances website, left column, SDR-rate section). Since the Dollar is already 
included in the SDR, utilization of both Yuan-Dollar and Yuan-SDR comparisons invited ""double counting"" into Lamb's 
assessment of his model's reliability. And, since the model subdivided data by 2000-2003 and 2003-2007 sub-periods, see 
Docket Entry No. 28-6, at 15, the Court is unclear as to how the 2005 change in SDR value and de-pegging of the Yuan from the 
Dollar were factored in the 2003-2007 sub-period."
512,39," Compare <<http://www.springerlink.com/content/h13p454817437337/fulltext.pdf?page=1>> (reproducing an  [**92] article 
showing that the USSR magnesium oxide production switched from oil to natural gas thirty years ago, i.e., in 1969, finding 
natural gas a more viable and efficient source of energy for the purposes of magnesium oxide production). In view of: (a) 
apparent viability of non-oil heating of magnesite into magnesium oxide; (b) relative scarcity of Chinese oil in comparison with its 
coal, 
see, 
e.g., 
<<http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/China/Background.html>> 
and <<http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/China/Oil.html>> (showing that, during the period at issue, China has become the third 
largest world importer of oil due to the lag between her domestic production and domestic consumption, while -- at the same 
time, China remained the world's largest producer and consumer of coal); and (c) substantial difference in price increases 
experienced by oil, coal and natural gas during the first decade of the XXI century, that is, the period at issue, see 
<<http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/STEO_ 
Query/steotables.cfm?tableNumber=8&periodType=Annual&startYear=2000&endYear=2009&startMonthChanged=false&startQ
uarterChanged=false&endMonthChanged=false&endQuarterChanged=false&noScroll=true&loadAction=Apply+Changes>> 
 [**93] (showing that power generation fuel costs, in dollars per million Btu, rose from 2000 to 2009 by $ 2.22 as to coal, by $ 
4.57 as to natural gas, and by at least $ 9.37 as to oil), Lamb's utilization of oil prices as a regressor is unclear. Compare Docket 
Entry No. 77-1, at 70, and Docket Entry No. 77-3, at 11 (Plaintiffs' exhibits attached to the Amended Complaint; the exhibit 
suggests that coal was the source of heating involved in all relevant technical processes, and the price of coal kept soaring)."
512,40," Although, presumably, Lamb should have collected pools of monthly observations for each of these six variables, the Report 
neither provides the Court with actual pools of these observations nor even states where the Court could locate them on its own. "
513,41," ""Significance"" is a statistical term informing the reader about how certain is the analyst that a relationship between the variable 
actually exists, i.e., that the result is unlikely to occur by chance. See Business Statistics at 287. However, ""unfortunate 
stereotypes often arise from the use of the word significant in statistical studies. For example, studies often find statistically 
significant differences in certain abilities between men and women, but the variation in ability within each sex is much greater 
than the variation between the means of the two sexes. It would be wrong to use the result of such a study to prejudge the ability 
of any particular individual."" Id. at 288."
513,1, Fixed  [**95] effects and quarterly seasonal indicator variables are incorporated in the model but not reported.
513,2," Singled Taied Statistical Significance Levels: *** < 1% significance level, "" < 5% significance level,"" < 10% significance level. "
514,3, Collusion period is April 2000 to Present.
514,42," Since Lamb also referred to ""three price series,"" see Docket Entry No. 28-6, at 11, the Court cannot exclude the possibility that 
Lamb's ""three panels"" and ""three time series"" are the same, that they  [**96] have nothing to do with sets of data collected with 
regard to Lamb's six independent variables, and that they were intended, for instance, to refer to three spans of time: 1995-
2000, 2000-2003 and 2004-2007. However: (a) lack of any statements with regard to 1995-2000 span in Lamb's Regression 
Result renders this possibility unlikely; and (b) the 1995-2000 span would yield 48 monthly observations, hence raising the 
Court-calculated 156 monthly periods, see supra note 35 of this Opinion, to 204 (i.e., the sum of 156 and 48), thus rendering the 
statement included in Lamb's Regression Result that Lamb collected observations with regard to 143 periods even more 
incomprehensible."
514,43," E.g., the table does not explain how R<2> of 0.87 asserted in the Report became R<2> of 0.86 in the table, leaving another 
percent of price variation unexplained. Analogously, no reason is provided as to the relevance or even need for ""Wald Statistic,"" 
which the Court presumes to be ""Wald test,"" a parametric test typically substituted by the likelihood-ratio test (since the Wald 
test can give different answers to the same question, depending on how the question is phrased). See All Statistics at 153-54. In 
the  [**97] same vein, the Court is left to guess why the Report stresses that t-statistics is used to determine statistical 
significance, if Lamb's Regression Result provides a totally different column, titled ""Statistical Significance,"" which seemingly 
aims to provide the same assessment but on the grounds of what seems to be the so-called one-tailed test (applicable only if all 
studied relationships fell entirely within one tail of the distribution, which is unclear if it were actually true in this matter). Simply 
put, since Lamb did not provide the Court with his regression equation and pools of data, the Court has no opportunity to 
determine the validity of Lamb's calculative decisions, e.g., his resort to logarithms, or his results, or his end conclusions. "
515,44," The concept could be illustrated as follows: ""For example, suppose you are investigating [United States] consumption behavior 
with time series data for the period 1930 to 1950. You would expect that consumption behavior would have been significantly 
different during the years of World War II than it was before and after the war. To take this effect into account, you can create an 
artificial variable that will take the value 1 during each of the war years and the value 0 during each of the other years."" Business 
Statistics at 394. In such example, the usage of a dummy variable based on the WWII during the years affected by the WWII is 
warranted since the fact of the WWII occurrence  [**100] has been unquestionably established, the same as the years during 
which the United States were engaged in the WWII."
515,45," The developments that could have had an influence on the prices of Chinese magnesium oxide (and, thus, might be dummy 
variables, that is, if the Court is to presume that these developments were, somehow, not quantitative) include: increases in 
Chinese domestic and export taxation, increases in cost of capital ensuing from borrowing (or issuance of debt), needs for 
repairs and/or new constructions caused by depreciation of equipment/other fixed assets, rising cost of labor, etc. Indeed, the 
increase in wages appears to be the most probable factor -- as this Court already pointed out in its December Opinion: the cost of labor in Chinese mining and mining-related industries more than doubled from  [**102] 2000 to 2005. 29 See 
<<http://www.stats.gov.cn/tjsj/ndsj/2006/html/E0520E.HTM>>; 
<<http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/statisticaldata/yearlydata/yb2004-e/html/E0526ae.htm 
>>; <<http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/statisticaldata/yearlydata/YB2002e/html/e0526ae. 
htm>>; <<http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/statisticaldata/yearlydata/YB2001e/html/ e0526ae.htm>> (information provided by the 
National Bureau of Statistics of China, indicating that the wages of employees in state-owned facilities increased, between 
1999 and 2005, from 8,283 yuan to 20,992 yuan per annum, that is 254%; while the wages in collectively-owned units 
increased from 4,857 to 11,268 (231%), and in all other units went from 9,842 to 21,207, that is, 215%). Docket Entry No. 73, at 45-46. It appears rather evident that the ""Chinese Consumer Price Inflation"" variable factored in the 
Lamb's Regression Result could not have accounted for these dramatic rise in labor costs, since: (a) the concept of ""consumer "
516,," price inflation"" is qualitatively different from that of ""labor costs""; (b) the coefficient of 0.587 detected by Lamb as an assessor of 
the effect the increases in inflation had on the increases in magnesium oxide prices fails  [**103] to correspond to the above-
quoted over-200% increase in labor costs; and (c) rising cost of Chinese labor was virtually certain to be higher than domestic 
inflation of the Yuan (causing consumer price inflation) because an increase in wages exceeding the increase in inflation is a 
feature necessary for an increase in the population's purchasing power (and its standard of living) which, seems, was 
unquestionably achieved in China during the first decade of the XXI century. See, e.g., Yangtze China Inv. Interim Results, 
London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (Dec. 4, 2009); Form 8-k: Cn Dragon Announces Determination 
to Change Direction of Current Business Operations, US State News (Dec. 4, 2009); Low-carbon Urbanization Is Way Forward 
for China, Chinadaily.com (Nov. 30. 2009)."
516,1, Collusion period is April 2000 to Present. 
517,46," The Court, having a mere layperson's familiarity and no expert command of statistics, is certainly mindful of the possibility that 
the Court misconstrued either Lamb's deducements and/or his regression model, and/or the correlation Lamb envisioned 
between the benchmarking and regression analyses, etc. However, the possibility of the Court's misconstruction of the Report 
transforms the Report into a document even less suitable to operate as a factual proof: it is axiomatic that HN24[
] Rule 702 admits expert testimony ""if it will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or a fact in issue,"" Moses v. Payne, 543 F.3d 
1090, 1101 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting State v. Farr-Lenzini, 93 Wn. App. 453, 970 P.2d 313, 318 (Wash. Ct. App. 1999)); see also 
Kannankeril v. Terminix Int'l, Inc., 128 F.3d 802, 806 (3d Cir. 1997), and the Court has no obligation to decipher an expert's 
cryptic message. Moreover, since -- HN25[
] under Rule 702 -- expert testimony cannot be misleading, see Moses, 543 F.3d at"
517,1101," (citing Farr-Lenzini, 970 P.2d at 319),  [**107] an expert's report must be amenable to understanding by a layperson not 
only with respect to the words composing the end-conclusion but also with regard to the rationale and the steps of the processes 
employed. Indeed, construing Rule 702 otherwise would invite experts to ""create"" facts by simply ushering floods of technical 
terminology on the judiciary stripped of an actual opportunity to analyze the testimony."
517,47," Since, according to Plaintiffs, the export price rose during 2000 from $ 104 per metric ton to $ 158 per metric ton (i.e., by $ 54 
per ton per year), see Am. Compl. P 55, then the deduced-by-Lamb 4.03% effect, see Table 3, of such $ 54 increase would 
amount to the yearly price rise of $ 2.16 per metric ton (4.03% of $ 54), i.e., it yields Lamb's conclusion that ""Chinese"" collusive 
agreements caused only a $ 2.16 rise in price of magnesium oxide, and the remaining $ 51.84 ($ 54 - $ 2.16) rise in price was 
attributed to factors unrelated to these ""Chinese"" collusive agreements. "
522,48," In other words, Plaintiffs seem to invite the Court to find that the process of ""importation"" begins right at the loading docks of 
an exporter if the exporter sells to an American end-user or to a broker who informs the exporter of the broker's intent to resell 
the goods directly to American end-user once the goods enter  [**128] the United States. Such reading divorces United States 
actual geographic borders from Plaintiffs-created ""virtual borders"" which become drawn at any point where an American end-
user or catering-to-Americans broker gets the good."
522,49," The Court notes, in passing, that it is not entirely clear as to any rights, title or interests in any cause of action that Possehl 
might have in this matter, since: (a) Possehl is a German entity, situated in Lubeck (Schleswig-Holstein land of Germany), see 
<<http://www.possehl.de/en/index.html>>; (b) Possehl is an importer of all kinds of goods and is operating world-wide, see id.; 
(c) here, Possehl seemingly has been purchasing Chinese goods for further world-wide importation, which bars Possehl's claims 
under the holding of Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226; and (d) the only injury Possehl might 
have suffered as a result of the alleged collusive activity is a wholly speculative Possehl's inability to make ""more"" profit on 
resale of Chinese goods. "
523,50," This Court does not endorse the Coors court's choice of words suggesting that an antitrust plaintiff might establish a direct 
effect necessary for subsection (1)(A) by pleadings asserting that the defendants' actions affected United States ""less directly."""
523,51," Hence, even if the Coors  [**133] court were to make a finding that Molson was a quasi-importer of its Canadian beer to the 
United States as a result of engaging Miller, such finding would be necessarily a dictum having no precedential value even in the 
Coors court jurisdiction, and certainly in no other jurisdiction, such as this District. However, it does not seem that the Coors 
court made such a finding even in dicta. "
524,52," The Court takes note of Plaintiffs' position that, in order to avoid the FTAIA jurisdictional bar under the introductory language 
""[the Sherman Act] shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with 
 [**137] foreign nations unless . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 6a, Plaintiffs need not show that Defendants were actually ""importers"" of goods 
to the United States but could make a ""diluted"" showing that Defendants were just ""involved"" in import to the United States. See 
Opp. at 29-30 (""the FTAIA exception is not limited to claims against importers but extends to claims alleging illegal conduct that 
involves import trade or import commerce,""emphasis in original, quoting Carpet Group, 227 F.3d at 71, statement that ""[t]he 
proper inquiry [is] whether the alleged conduct by the defendants 'involved' import trade or commerce,"" and In re Air Cargo 
Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107882, at *99 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2008), rejected in part, 2009 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 97365 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2009), for the proposition that ""language makes clear that not only import commerce, but 
conduct involving import commerce, is never removed from the reach of the Sherman Act,"" retaining the emphasis of Magistrate 
Judge Victor V. Pohorelsky). Plaintiffs misconstrue the meaning the word ""involved,"" as utilized by the Court of Appeals in 
Carpet Group and even by Judge Pohorelsky in Air Cargo. The paragraph  [**138] of the Carpet Group opinion, from which 
Plaintiffs extracted their quotation, reads, in its entirety, as follows: The Magistrate Judge held that this case did not fall into the FTAIA's parenthetical exclusion, i.e., did not ""involve"" import 
trade or commerce, because the plaintiffs in this case were not importers . . . . [T]his is plainly an inaccurate reading of the 
FTAIA. It is an incorrect focus on the plaintiffs' function rather than the defendants' conduct. HN32[
] [The] FTAIA's 
exemption from the Sherman Act focuses on the latter's application to ""conduct involving trade or commerce (other than 
import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations.""… The implication that the Sherman Act provisions ""apply to import 
trade and import commerce is unmistakable."" Eskofot A/S v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 872 F. Supp. 81, 85 (S.D.N.Y. 
1995). The proper inquiry was therefore whether the alleged conduct by the defendants ""involved"" import trade or 
commerce, not on whether the plaintiff's conduct, which is not being challenged as violative of the Sherman Act, ""involved"" 
import trade or commerce. Carpet Group, 227 F.3d at 71. Hence, the word ""involved"" was utilized by the Court of Appeals in order  [**139] to denote which 
party (i.e., the plaintiff or the defendants) has to be importer(s) in order to render the FTAIA's jurisdictional bar wholly 
inapplicable to the plaintiff's claims; the word was not used in order to set forth a ""diluted"" or ""relaxed"" meaning of the term 
""import."" This is especially obvious in light of the Court of Appeals' unaltered quotation from Eskofot: had the Court of Appeals 
wished to relax the Eskofot language, it would change it to ""the Sherman Act provisions 'apply to [acts somehow involving] 
import trade and import commerce.""' Magistrate Judge Pohorelsky's focus on the word ""involving"" is, too, different from Plaintiffs' 
position. While his end-conclusion does not persuade this Court (and was indeed rejected, in part, by the Eastern District of New 
York), his ""Analysis"" section following the quotation extracted by Plaintiffs indicates that Judge Pohorelsky utilized the word in 
response to defendants' assertion that the act of price fixing outside the United States must be divorced, for the purposes of the 
FTAIA analysis, from any importation activities, and only the foreign situs of the price fixing could be assessed. See Air Cargo 
Shipping Servs., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107882, at *99-100.  [**140] In light of the foregoing, the Court finds Plaintiffs' reliance 
on Carpet Group and Air Cargo without merit. Simply put, the FTAIA is wholly inapplicable to Plaintiffs' claims if -- and only if -- 
Defendants were, in fact, importers: so read, the introductory language of the FTAIA yields the result comparable, policy-wise, to 
the ""meant/intended to affect"" test of Alcoa/Hartford Fire adopted in the subsection (1)(A)'s requirement for ""direct, substantial 
and reasonably foreseeable effect,"" since an entity which is the ""main force"" behind the transaction bringing the goods on United 
States soil is expected to ""mean/intend to affect"" United States commerce. "
525,53," ""Where the goods are to be carried from one location to another as part of the sale transaction, the parties will often adopt a 
commercial term to state the delivery obligation of the seller. . . . These terms are defined in the UCC []§§ 2-319, 2-320[], but the 
UCC definitions are seldom used intentionally in international trade . . . because the abbreviations used are now associated 
primarily with water-borne traffic, and the statutory terms do not include the new terminology associated with air freight, 
containerization, or multi-modal transportation practices. In international commerce, the dominant source of definitions for 
commercial delivery terms is 'Incoterms,' published by the International Chamber of Commerce (I.C.C.) . . . . Incoterms is an 
acronym for International Commercial Terms, and provides rules for determining the obligations of both seller and buyer when 
different commercial terms . . . are used. They state what acts the seller must do to deliver, what acts buyer must do to 
accommodate delivery, what costs each party must bear, and at  [**142] what point in the delivery process the risk of loss 
passes from seller to buyer. Each of these obligations may be different for different commercial terms. . . . There are other 
sources of such definitions, in addition to the UCC and Incoterms, such as the American Revised Foreign Trade Definitions . . . . 
widely used in Pacific Ocean trade . . . . Since the I.C.C. is a non-governmental entity, Incoterms is neither a national legislation 
nor an international treaty [and] it cannot be 'the governing law' of any contract. Instead, it is a written form of custom and usage 
in the trade, which can be, and often is expressly incorporated by . . . the parties to an international contract for the sale of 
goods. . . . Although the [the line of aforesaid sources] has definitions for [Incoterms], these definitions are expressly subject to 
'agreement otherwise' [and] United States courts have so held. . . . Incoterms gives the parties a menu of thirteen different 
commercial terms to describe the . . . obligations of the seller and . . . the buyer . . . : (1) EXW; (2) FCA; (3) FAS; (4) FOB; (5) 
CFR; (6) CIF; (7) CPT; (8) CIP; (9) DAF; (10) DES; (11) DEQ; (12) DDU; (13) DDP."" Ralph H. Folsom et  [**143] al., 
International Business Transactions in a Nutshell 93-96 (West 5th ed., 1996). "
526,54," The Court recognizes that such ""main force"" inquiry is, perhaps, just as open to an academic debate as the ""who brings the 
goods into the United States?"" question in Turicentro. However, it appears rather certain that such entity as a freight forwarder, 
that is, a retained shipper, would not qualify as the ""main force"" behind the transaction, even though the freight forwarder is 
actually charged with an obligation to physically ""bring"" the goods into the United States. Similarly, since no meeting of minds 
can be reached and, hence, no sale of goods can take place, unless the seller is interested in selling and the buyer is interested 
in buying, the fact that the seller is seeking to increase his/her export quotas or is engaged in generic advertisement of his/her 
goods, or that the intermediary is advertising his/her services, or that the buyer is making generic inquiries with sellers or 
intermediaries, cannot be reflective of their responsibility for  [**148] ""bringing"" the goods into the United States for the purposes 
of a particular transaction. In contrast, if an intermediary buys a certain batch of the seller's goods because the intermediary has 
an actual or potential United States purchaser, or if the seller retains an intermediary to bring the goods into the United States 
and hold them for sale to the seller's potential buyers, or if the buyer approaches an intermediary with a request to obtain a 
specified amount of certain goods within a certain period of time and at the price the maximum of which is set within a certain "
527,," bracket, then such actions might be indicative of being the ""main force"" behind the particular sale of goods. And, since these 
types of actions are likely to require the ""main force"" entity to comply with United States customs clearance procedures (or to 
retain a freight forwarder or customs agent to perform such clearance) and to post a bond to cover customs duties or to deposit 
estimated customs duties upon filing the entry summary, the entity performing such clearance and liable for import duties within 
the meaning of United States customs law is likely to be the ""importer"" for the purposes of the particular transactions  [**149] in 
goods 
if 
these 
transactions 
are 
examined 
with 
an 
eye 
on 
the 
FTAIA 
jurisdictional 
bar. 
See 
<<http:// www.customs.gov/linkhandler/cgov/newsroom/publications/trade/iius.ctt/iius.pdf>> at 11 (defining the features of ""importer of 
record""); <<http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/ regulations/ftsrletters/ftsr174.html>> (same); see also 19 U.S.C. § 1484 (same) 
and 19 U.S.C. § 1641 (providing relevant clarifications as to customs brokers)."
527,55," Analogously, HN36[
] the ""directness"" of the seller's contacts with the United States required under the introductory clause of 
the FTAIA should roughly correspond, in the magnitude of the nexus it produces between the seller and the United States, to the 
cumulative nexus produced by the ""direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable"" elements of § 6a(1)(A): then, the defendant 
(whom, as here, the plaintiff seeks to re-qualify from an exporter into a de facto importer) would be subject to the jurisdiction of 
United States courts regardless of the plaintiff's or defendant's exercises in semantics, i.e., the mere terms ""exporter"" and 
""importer"" (being products more of the discipline of economics than of law which tends to operate in such basic terms as ""seller"" 
 [**150] and ""buyer"") would not invite a risk of inconsistent legal results as to the very same set of facts."
527,56," Possehl appears to be either an Aktiengesellschaft, or KGaA, or GmbH (i.e., a typical business entity chartered under the 
German law), see supra note 49 of this Opinion; Possehl seems to have no articles of incorporation registered in one of the 
United States' states and no such features as an American nerve-center or main production facility (which might give rise to 
""local"" corporate situs under state law). Therefore, the Court is not entirely clear as to the logic of Plaintiffs' reference to Possehl 
as an ""American"" importer. "
528,57," The Court fails to fancy what such ""agent"" is to do in the event the alleged American intermediary or alleged American end-
user attempts to ""divert"" the goods to a non-United States market. Moreover, the economic implications of a ruling tying the 
seller's importer status to the buyer's contractually  [**153] irrelevant promise would invite a self-imposed quasi-embargo 
(preventing import to the United States), since foreign sellers, worried about liability in the United States, might start selling their 
goods only to those intermediaries or end-consumers that promise to ship/consume the goods only to non-United States ports, 
which means that American buyers or a second tier of intermediaries would have then to re-import the goods into the United 
States, raising the cost of these goods for the purposes of United States domestic trade by dual broker's commissions and 
additional freight."
528,58," To illustrate, it would be anomalous to declare a French vineyard or Spanish tannery ""importers"" of goods to the United States 
simply because American tourists keep purchasing wine and hides while visiting the vineyard and tannery and bringing these 
goods to the United States, where they consume the wine and use the hides to decorate their living rooms. Moreover, a position 
somewhat similar to that suggested by Plaintiffs was rejected in Dee-K Enters., 299 F.3d 281. Dee-K Enters. involved a price-
fixing action by two American companies against Southeast Asian producers. See id. at 283. On appeal, plaintiffs:  [**154] (a) 
challenged the district court's adherence to the Hartford Fire standard asserting that Hartford Fire applied only to cases involving 
""wholly foreign"" commerce; and (b) maintained that the sale of price-fixed goods by foreign sellers to an American buyer must be 
deemed as involving, by definition, United States commerce. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit characterized plaintiffs' 
latter argument as ""perilously close to clear conflict with Hartford Fire,"" id. at 291, and pointed out that such ""single-factor test"" 
proposed by plaintiffs would open United States courts to a flood of claims involving ""a great variety of foreign conduct."" Id. at 
292. "
529,59," The sole suspect print-out appears to be the one where the ""importer"" is identified as ""Order of Shipper,"" since the Court is left 
to wonder about the form of notice to -- and the identity of -- the consignee (and the consignee's relation to the shipper, who is 
likely to be the exporter retaining the consignee as its United States sales agent for the purposes of that particular transaction). 
See Docket Entry No. 105-8, at 2. However, the nature of the transaction  [**158] reflected by this print-out appears questionably 
relevant to the case at bar, since: (a) the ""port [of] origination"" designated in that particular print-out is ""PT ALFRED,"" that is, a 
seemingly non-Chinese port having code number ""14069,"" compare Docket Entry No. 105-11, at 54 (suggesting that the codes 
for all Chinese ports falls within 57000's); see also Docket Entries Nos. 105-7 to 105-11 (identifying all Chinese ports under 
57000's numbers); and (b) the only ""port Alfred"" the Court is aware of is in South Africa rather than in China. See 
<<http://www.portalfred.co.za>>. "
530,60," Plaintiffs' Exhibit 3 does not support Plaintiffs' point; rather, it shows a transaction by the Defendant that does not assert 
importation. Plaintiffs' Exhibit 10 contains a blank boilerplate contract shedding no light on this matter, plus one contract between 
one of the Sinosteel Defendants  [**161] and Possehl. See Docket Entry No. 105-12, at 10-11. That contract suggests that 
Possehl was likely the importer of goods (since Possehl purchased the goods in Dalian, China, and insured the goods, and 
arranged for their transportation to New Orleans)."
530,61," The ""incongruent"" language -- upon which Plaintiffs try to capitalize -- is a product of the Sinosteel Defendants' affiants, both of 
whom are Chinese nationals; the overall content of their declaration suggest limited fluency in English. See Docket Entries Nos. 
98-16 and 98-17. "
534,62," A policy point made by Plaintiffs warrants a comment. See Opp. at 11 (asserting that the Court's focus on the Alcoa/Hartford 
Fire requirement to show that Defendants meant to increase prices in the United States,""prevents U.S. courts from adjudicating 
claims [based on any defendant's] global price-fixing [affecting exportation] without regard to the harm caused to U.S. 
consumers. This is plainly contrary to the language and intent of the FTAIA and controlling precedent. To dismiss this case on 
subject matter jurisdiction grounds would jeopardize numerous ongoing prosecutions and investigations of the Department of 
Justice, as well as private damages actions, against [foreign] cartels exporting products [that enter] into U.S. commerce""). The 
Court disagrees. Historically, federal courts and Congress have been careful in crafting their language, cautious to not unduly 
superimpose United States law outside United States borders. This was the reason for the Alcoa court's creation of the 
""intended"" effect test, see 148 F.2d at 444, for Judge Hand's rejection of the idea  [**176] that Congress meant ""to punish all 
whom [United States] courts can catch,"" id. at 443, and for the Supreme Court's adoption of the same in Hartford Fire. Moreover, 
a similar concern prompted Congress to limit Section (1)(A) exception to the export conduct that causes ""direct"" and 
""substantial"" and ""foreseeable"" effect in the United States, see LSL Biotechnologies, 379 F.3d at 679, rather than to expand 
Section (1)(A) to all export conduct that ""harms"" United States consumers: had Congress wished to so state, it would have done 
so. Upon analyzing ""the language and intent of the FTAIA and controlling precedent,"" this Court concludes that foreign exporters' 
global price-fixing is wholly indifferent to whether their goods might be imported into any particular state, the United States 
included, falls within the FTAIA jurisdictional bar, accord supra note 19 (discussing the anomaly of punishing indiscriminating 
exporters on the grounds of the choices made by United States importers); any conclusion otherwise is likely to yield an 
overreaching mandate directing ""special competition"" catering to American consumers with full ignorance of consumers in all 
other nations and even in the exporters'  [**177] own state. Accord S/Reply at 7 (""Congress specifically adopted the effects test 
in the FTAIA to balance the concern for over-extending the antitrust laws to foreign trade in precisely the sort of situation present 
here, H.R. Rep. 97-686, at 9 - 12, 97th Cong., (2nd Sess. 1982), reprinted in U.S.C.C.A.N. 2487, at 2492-97 (1982), a principle 
similarly recognized by the Department of Justice Antitrust Enforcement Guidelines for International Operations, § 3.121, Illus. C, 
Var.(1) at 13 [clarifying that] wholly foreign sales activities not subject to U.S. anti-trust laws absent express agreement directed 
to the U.S.""). "
535,63," While the Court notes its deep concern with what appears to be Plaintiffs' position that neither the specific composition of the 
alleged ""cartel"" nor the relation between such cartel and the collusive agreement or the collusive agreement  [**180] and the 
actual imports into the United States could matter for the purposes of stating a claim, see Opp. at 35 (seemingly so suggesting), 
these issues fall within the scope of the Sherman Act, rather than the FTAIA. The Court, therefore, need not reach these issues 
at the instant juncture."
535,64," Plaintiffs maintain that they should not be ""required to provide [any] sales agreements, purchase orders, shipping 
confirmations, . . . bills of lading"" or other similar documentary proof verifying Defendants' activities as importers of goods into 
the United States because all ""[t]hese documents are, of course, in Defendants' possession."" Opp. at 30. Plaintiffs' assertion 
appears half-hearted at best, since any typical international sale of goods leaves voluminous paper trail in the hands of the 
seller, the buyer and all intermediaries, plus the United States Department of Customs. Therefore, the Court is not clear as to 
how there could be no documentary or, at the very least, detailed first-hand testimonial evidence if, as the Amended Complaint 
maintains, Defendants have been in fact bringing hundreds of thousands of tons of magnesium oxide into the United States, 
year after year, for almost a  [**181] decade. Cf. Paul Morelli Design, Inc. v. Tiffany & Co., 200 F. Supp. 2d 482, 488 (E.D. Pa. 
2002) (""We do not leave our common sense at the courthouse door""). See also infra note 149 of this Opinion. "
536,65," While, from the point of its legislative history, the FSIA is an affirmative defense, see H.R. Rep. No. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d 
Sess. at 17,  [**184] reprinted in, U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6616 (1976), the Supreme Court noted that the congressional position to 
that effect was not entirely accurate since a district court lacks jurisdiction over a suit against a foreign state until it is determined 
that the defendant does not have immunity, which means that the absence of sovereign immunity must be determined 
regardless of whether it was raised by the defendant or even defendant's entry of appearance. See Verlinden B.V. v. Central 
Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 493 n.20, 103 S. Ct. 1962, 76 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1983). "
537,66," In light of the breadth and complexity of the FSIA, a multitude of aspects of the statute, its case law interpretations and its 
legislative history are omitted from this discussion --not for lack of significance but for having little relevance to the factual 
circumstances at hand."
537,67," The primary purpose of the FSIA was to depoliticize sovereign immunity decisions by transferring them from the executive 
branch to the judiciary, hence assuring litigants that the decisions would be made on legal rather than political grounds. See 
Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 685, 101 S. Ct. 2972, 69 L. Ed. 2d 918 (1981); Nat'l Airmotive Corp. v. Iran, 499 F. 
Supp. 401, 406 (D.D.C. 1980)."
537,68," HN47[
] For the purposes of the FSIA, an ""agency or instrumentality of a foreign state"" is not the same legal entity as the 
foreign state itself. See TransAmerica Leasing. Inc. v. La Republica de Venezuela, 200 F.3d 843, 847-848, 339 U.S. App. 
D.C. 385 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Gates v. Victor Fine Foods, 54 F.3d 1457, 1462 (9th Cir. 1995)."
537,69," The statute's legislative history suggests that the term ""agency or instrumentality"" should be interpreted broadly, see EIE 
Guam, 322 F.3d at 639-649; cf. Refco. Inc. v. Galadari, 755 F. Supp. 79, 82 (S.D.N.Y. 1991) (statements of foreign officials to be 
accorded great weight in determining whether entity is foreign state within meaning of FSIA). An entity may qualify for immunity 
even if it has some autonomy and independence from its government, see Venus Lines, 210 F.3d at 1311-1313, and without 
regard to its line of business, e.g., trading, mining, shipping, banking, procurement, etc. See H.R. Rep. No. 1487, 94th Cong. 2d 
Sess., at 15-16, reprinted in, U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6614 (1976). HN48[
] The  [**191] Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 
explained that the ""agency or instrumentality"" nature is determined under the seven-factor test: (1) the circumstances 
surrounding the entity's creation; (2) the purposes of the entity's activities; (3) the degree of supervision by the government; (4) 
the level of governmental financial support; (5) the entity's employment policies, particularly regarding whether the foreign state 
requires the hiring of public employees and pays their salaries; (6) the entity's obligations and privileges under the foreign state's 
laws; (7) the ownership structure of the entity. See USX Corp. v. Adriatic Ins. Co., 345 F.3d 190, 206-208 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding 
that an Irish insurer was an organ of the Irish government in light of Ireland's indirect ownership and control over the insurer's 
shares, and the government's decision-making role). "
538,70," HN50[
] In enacting the commercial-activity exception, Congress sought to make it difficult for foreign defendants engaged in 
commercial activity to invoke sovereign immunity with regard to commercial wrongs. See Alberti v. Empresa Nicaraguense de La 
Carne, 705 F.2d 250, 256 (7th Cir. 1983). "
540,71,"  HN55[
] In the United States[,] the foundation of private international law is the [concept] of international comity. Roughly 
speaking, courts, according to this [concept], should apply foreign law or limit domestic jurisdiction out of respect for foreign 
sovereignty. [See] Mark Janis, An Introduction to International Law 327 (2003). [Since] international comity requires courts 
to balance competing public and private interests in a manner that takes into account any conflict between the public 
policies of the domestic and foreign sovereigns[,] scholars and courts have characterized international comity inconsistently 
as a choice-of-law principle, see, e.g., Ian F. Baxter, Essays on Private Law 22 (1966), a synonym for private international 
law, see, e.g., Joseph H. Beale, A Treatise on the Conflicts of Law, vol. 1 § 6.1 (1935); L. Oppenheim, International Law 34 
n.1 (H. Lauterpacht ed., 8th ed. 1955), a rule of public international law [or an element of international legal order], see, 
e.g., 288 Domestic Letters of the Department of State, cited in, 4 Green H. Hackworth, Digest of International Law 460 
(1942); . . . Harold Maier, Extraterritorial Jurisdiction at a Crossroads: An Intersection Between Public and Private 
International Law, 76 Am. J. Int'l. 1. 280, 281 (1982) [**202] , a moral obligation, see, e.g., Ian Brownlie, Principles of Public 
International Law 31 (3d ed. 1979); Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws § 33 (1834), expediency, see, 
e.g., Somportex. Ltd. v. Philadelphia Chewing Gum Corp., 453 F.2d 435, 440 (3d Cir. 1971), courtesy, see, e.g., Francis 
Wharton, A Treatise on the Conflict of Laws 5 (2d ed. 1881), reciprocity, see, e.g., Hilton, 159 U.S. [at] 163-64; Hans Smit, 
International Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel, 9 UCLA L. Rev. 44, 53 (1962), utility, see, e.g., Beale, id., § 71; Henry 
Wheaton, Elements of International Law § 79 (Richard Henry Dana, Jr. ed., 8th ed. 1866) or diplomacy. See, e.g., Harold 
Maier, Interest Balancing and Extraterritorial Jurisdiction, 31 Am. J. Comp. L. 579, 589 (1983). . . . For all these reasons, 
international comity [might have been perceived as] too vague, incoherent, illusory, and ephemeral to serve as a foundation 
for U.S. private international law. Yet, it is precisely these qualities that have allowed the [concept] of comity to mutate over 
time in ways that [allowed for creation of various ""doctrines of comity"" that] responded to different geopolitical 
circumstances.  [**203] [In its direct manifestations, the concept of] international comity [yielded] comity []as a discretionary 
doctrine that empowered courts to decide when to defer to foreign cases [and to the] broader concept of comity as a rule 
and a justification for deference encompasses a wider constellation of . . . [inter]related doctrines -- like the foreign-act-of-
state doctrine -- which, though analytically distinct . . . , nonetheless share[] certain methods, values, and justificatory 
rhetoric. Joel R. Paul, Transformation of International Comity, 71 L. & Cont. Probs. 19 (2008) (citations restored to the main text, 
parenthetical explanations and citations to the author's prior publication, i.e., Comity in International Law, 32 Harv. Int'l L.J. 1 
(1991), omitted). Hence, the panoply of ""doctrines of comity,"" distinctly named doctrines (e.g., ""the act of state"") and even the 
statutory language of the FSIA, are different legal faces expressing an overall position of United States legislators and the 
judiciary as to the modern ""comity of nations."" See Republic of Aus. v. Altmann, 541 U.S. at 689-691 (the doctrine of foreign 
sovereign immunity had always been viewed as a matter of grace and comity);  [**204] Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 486 (same); Ex 
parte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 586-590, 63 S. Ct. 793, 87 L. Ed. 1014 (1943) (same); accord Aquamar S.A. v. Del Monte

541,," F.3d 1279, 1294-1298 (11th Cir. 1999) (since Congress intended international law to inform the courts in their interpretation of 
the FSIA, courts may look to the concepts of international law as a guide to the meaning of the FSIA). "
542,72," The Timberlane factors are: (a) the degree of conflict with foreign law or policy; (b) the nationality or allegiance of the parties 
and their place of business; (c) the likelihood of compliance with judicial orders; (d) the effects on the countries involved; (e) 
whether there was an explicit intention to harm United States commerce or the foreseeability of such effect; and (f) where the 
conduct occurred. See Timberlane, 549 F.2d at 614. The Court of Appeals refined the Timberlane list by offering the following

the alleged violation of conduct here compared to that abroad; (d) availability of a remedy abroad or pendency of litigation there; 
(e) existence of intent to harm or affect United States commerce; (f) possible effect upon foreign relations if the court grants

545,75," ""Planned economy"" is an economic regime where the central government makes all decisions on the production and sale of 
goods and services. See Alec Nove, The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics vol. 3, at 879-80 (1987). Although a planned 
economy may consist of state-owned enterprises, private enterprises directed by the state, or a combination of both, the term is 
most often associated with the economy of the Soviet Union prior to its ""perestroika""  [**230] period, of China before 1978 and of 
India before 1991. See, e.g., Andrew C. Wilson, Politics and Market Forces in China's Planned Economy: the Case of Grain 
Self-sufficiency Versus Cash Crop Benefits (1986); T. Mathew, Fiscal Policy in the Planned Economy of India (1960); V. 
Ossinsky et al., Socialist Planned Economy in the Soviet Union (1932). "

549,77," MoreoverHN62[
] , the following factors must be present before a prior decision has stare decisis effect: (a) the decision must be from the same court or from a court which the court applying stare decisis owes obedience; (b) an issue was actually 
determined by the decision; (c) the decision must constitute a holding of the majority of the court and, if a particular result is 
adopted by a clear majority of the court, it has  [**243] absolute precedential effect; (d) the decision must involve an issue of law; 
and (e) the decision was rendered in substantially identical legal and factual circumstances. See 3-30 Moore's Manual-Federal 
Practice and Procedure § 30.11, (2007) (citing, inter alia, City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 285, 120 S. Ct. 1382, 146 L. 
Ed. 2d 265 (2000), and Rappa v. New Castle County, 18 F.3d 1043, 1061 (3d Cir. 1994)). "
550,78," Therefore, it can be argued that LTFV sales arise from ""profit-discrimination"" rather than ""price-discrimination."" See Tara 
Gingerich, Why the WTO Should Require the Application of the Evidentiary Threshold Requirement in Antidumping, 48 Am. U. L. 
Rev. 135 (1998). Consequently, while the allegations of antitrust and antidumping are often raised jointly, these legal regimes 
often put the sellers between the proverbial rock and hard place, since sellers' heavy-handed tilt from one direction to another 
could place the sellers seeking to avoid dumping accusations in the position where  [**246] these very same sellers get accused 
of antitrust practices. This is so largely because the policies driving these two legal regimes could get occasionally at odds in 
terms of their economic goals, since the goal of antitrust law is to create the maximum market competition between the sellers 
of the same goods and, hence, to drive the price on these goods as much down as possible, while the goal of antidumping law is 
to limit this very same market competition by forcing the sellers striving to charge their lowest prices into selling their goods at 
higher prices that are comparable to those charged by their competitors. See, e.g., Christopher M. Barbuto, Toward 
Convergence of Antitrust and Trade Law: An International Trade Analogue to Robinson-Patman, 62 Fordham L. Rev. 2047 
(1994) (discussing this incongruity of policies). "
551,79," The General Court (""Trial Court"") was previously known as the ""Court of First Instance.""  [**248] The Trial Court procedural 
rules envision a written phase and an oral phase; at the oral hearing, the parties' lawyers state their legal positions, and the 
judicial panel poses questions (While the General Court has on its staff at least one judge from each European Union state, 80% 
of the cases are presided by a panel of three judges, although it might be five judges, thirteen judges, or even an en banc 
tribunal if the matter is deemed truly complex or important). One of the panelists, ""Judge-Rapporteur"" (a position which, duties-
wise, encompasses the tasks performed in the United States by magistrate judges), prepares a report and a recommended 
decision (""R&R""). This R&R is then deliberated by the presiding panel that delivers the judgment which is subject to appeal to 
the

Court

Justice,

law. See<<http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_7033/ presentation>>. An appeal as to the Trial Court's decision in Zhejiang Xinan 
was filed on June 17, 2009, by the Council of the European Union. See Vitamin C, Civil Action No. 06-md-1738 (DGT) 
(E.D.N.Y.), Docket Entry No. 399-5 (the application detailing appellate grounds). "
552,80," Treaty Establishing the European Community, 298 U.N.T.S.  [**257] 11 (Mar. 25, 1957), amended by, Treaty of Amsterdam,

552,81," To be granted the MET status, a business must demonstrate that it meets five criteria so composed that this status is typically 
refused to businesses unable to show that their decisions as to prices, costs, etc., have been taken free of significant 
interference of their government (in other words, the end result of the inquiry turns not on whether the government could or did 
interfere, but on whether the government actually succeeded in interfering with that particular businesses' operations). Since the 
MET status directly affects one of the elements plugged into the applicable calculative formula for anti-dumping duties, lack of 
the status means that the exporter is charged higher duties. Therefore, there is a direct financial incentive for exporters to obtain 
the MET status through asserting that they, in particular, operate free of significant interference of their government. See Van 
Bael & Bellis, Brussels Monitor 3-4 (July 10, 2009)."
552,82," EU legal decisions, including the decisions of the Trial Court, are drafted  [**258] in a style different from that common to 
modern United States jurisprudence, especially in terms of their structure, limited citations to legal and factual sources and their 
terminology."
552,83," Hence, in September 2004, that is, halfway into the Class Period asserted in the instant matter, the EU held that the CCCMC 
was setting minimum export price on behalf of the Chinese government and that Zhejian's personal export practices were 
subject to this price requirement. "
555,84," Although this matter cannot be conclusively resolved on the basis of Resco's statements made in Magnesite from China, the 
fact that, with only three weeks difference, Resco asserted in its Opposition that no government-mandated system of price 
restraint exists with regard to magnesite-based goods exported from China (or that none was enforced, or that the prices were 
not tied to export quotas and the export bidding process), and yet asserted an opposite position in its petition filed with the ITA, 
brings Resco's objective good faith belief in question. HN67[
] ""The first prong of the test to determine if Rule 11 sanctions 
should be imposed is met if the complaint is frivolous, legally unreasonable, or without factual foundation, even though the paper 
was not filed in subjective bad faith. The pleader . . . must have an objective good faith belief in the merit of [the pleader's] legal 
argument."" Mitford v. Marsh, 1992 U.S. App. LEXIS 30070, at *9-10 (9th Cir. Aug. 25, 1992) (internal quotation marks and

555,86," In its Resco WDPa action, Resco is represented by four attorneys (the United States Department of Justice, being seemingly 
invited by Resco's counsel to make an appearance in the Resco WDPa declined that invitation two months after the Resco "
556,," WDPa was initiated, without making even an appearance and without filing any document). Two of Resco's counsel in Resco 
WDPa are also among Resco's counsel in the instant matter."
556,87," In other words, the Resco WDPa asserted a point substantively analogous to that addressed by this Court under the FTAIA 
exporter exception."
556,88," The  [**273] Resco WDPa defendants cite to their exhibit docketed as Docket Entry No. 103-5. Resco's Resco WDPa 
opposition concedes the current validity of this 1996 regulation but maintains that the regulation's reference to ""lower-than-
normal price [did] not require collusive pricing"" reached under the auspices of the CCCMC. Resco WDPa, Docket Entry No. 117, 
at 16. The Court disagrees. See infra, note 121 of this Opinion, for discussion of this aspect. "
557,89," Two of Plaintiffs' counsel in this matter also represent the plaintiffs in the Vitamin C litigation, and one of these attorneys 
 [**282] is also Resco's counsel in Resco WDPa. Moreover, one of Resco's counsel in Resco WDPa is also among counsel for 
Animal Science (the other of the two named Plaintiffs in the instant matter) in another action, Animal Science v. Hebei Welcome 
Pharm., Civil Action No. 05-453 (DGT) (E.D.N.Y.), which was joined by the Eastern District of New York with the Vitamin C, Civil 
Action No. 06-md-1738 (DGT) (E.D.N.Y.), proceedings. "
559,90," Plaintiffs assert that Judge Trager reached his decision to deny the defendants' motion because the act-of-state and 
government compulsion ""defenses rest on facts that are not found within the complaints -- namely, [that] the Chinese 
government required defendants to fix prices in violation of the Sherman Act,"" and such inquiry ""could not be resolved at the 
motion to dismiss stage even after limited discovery."" Opp. at 64 (quoting Vitamin C, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 555-56). Plaintiffs 
misread Judge Trager's decision. Had Judge Trager found the inquiry into the evidentiary material submitted by the Vitamin C 
defendants and amicus not a viable ground for dismissal, he would have ended his decision at page 11 and footnote 6, skipping 
the remaining 25 pages of his opinion. See  [**283] Vitamin C, Civil Action No. 06-md-1738 (E,D.N.Y.), Docket Entry No. 338. In 
light of the content of Judge Trager's footnote 6 and the context in which it was entered, it appears that Judge Trager merely 
observed the general rule that a Rule 12(b) motion is a motion on pleadings, i.e., a motion on what is alleged in the plaintiff's 
complaint. However, Judge Trager did not directly address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction (since the defendants in 
Vitamin C did not raise a FSIA-based challenge) or the prudential considerations of judicial economy associated with resolution 
of claims substantively intertwined with the FSIA. Moreover, Judge Trager's discussion did not involve the issue of judicial notice 
which allows the court consider evidence not made part of the plaintiff's submission at the motion to dismiss stage. See, e.g., 
Jackson, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3960, at *18. "
560,91," The documents filed in the Vitamin C proceedings which the Court finds worthy of mentioning but not amenable to judicial 
notice are accompanied by appropriate clarifications. "
561,92," Sinosteel points  [**290] out that Plaintiffs' exhibit allegedly showing that Sinosteel is on the Standing Committee of the 
CCCMC actually lacks such information. See S/Reply at 18."
561,93," Given Plaintiffs' stretch of logic, the Court is not entirely clear as to Plaintiffs' preference of the option ""(a)"" over the option 
""(b)"". If Plaintiffs assert that the FSIA-based immunity is inapplicable because Defendants' goods were sold in China but, 
allegedly, used in the United States, or because Defendants' conspiracy allegedly affected the prices of goods used in the 
United States, then any usage/consumption of Defendants' goods in the United States could just as well be qualified as ""an act 
performed in the United States in connection with [Defendants' export sales in China, which could be just as well qualified as] a 
commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere,"" thus yielding an option ""(b)"" scenario. In sum, Plaintiffs' position, taken to its 
logical conclusion, removes the FSIA-based immunity from any foreign state's activity, provided there is an American 
usage/consumption of that foreign state's goods. "
562,94," The nature  [**292] of Defendants' business activities, i.e., production/sale of magnesite-based goods, squarely qualifies as 
""commercial activities"" under the FSIA, but Defendants' alleged ""conspiratorial"" meetings, partaking in administrative duties at 
the CCCMC, reports to and deliberations at the CCCMC, etc. fall outside of the realm of ""commercial activities,"" even if Plaintiffs 
allege that the goal of such ""extracurricular"" endeavors was an increase in Defendants' business: the commercial character of 
the activity is determined by the nature of the defendant's conduct, not by its purpose. See 28 U.S.C. § 1603(d); Weltover, 504 
U.S. at 615-616."
562,95," It would be indeed anomalous if the conclusions reached by this Court under the FTAIA and the FSIA on the very same set of 
facts would, nonetheless, yield different results."
562,96," Hence, the FSIA-based burden of the presumptively immune Defendants would be largely a mirror image of Plaintiffs' FTAIA-
based burden. "
563,97," The only entity vaguely hinting that Defendants' activities were ""regulatory"" are Plaintiffs, since their Opposition stresses that 
Defendants partook in administration of the CCCMC and in CCCMC's coining of the minimum price applicable to magnesite 
export. "
564,98," Federal constitutional law provides a somewhat relevant test with regard to First Amendment retaliation: it requires the plaintiff 
seeking to state such claim to show, inter alia, that there is a causal link between the plaintiffs' activity at issue and the adverse 
action that the supervising official takes against him. See Rauser v. Horn, 241 F.3d 330, 333 (3d Cir. 2001). "
565,99," In addition, the fact that a certain prescript is rarely enforced or even has not been invoked for many years fails to reclassify 
the prescript into ""not-law."" For instance, the United States government relied on an 18th-century law on sedition to investigate 
the 
September 
11 
terror 
attacks. 
See 
<<http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/11/09/terror/main317461.shtml>>. [**305] Similarly, the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982, 50 U.S.C. §§ 421-426, was enacted in 1982 but never 
invoked 
until 
2003, 
when 
Valerie 
Plame's 
identity 
was 
leaked. 
See <<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/oct/01/20031001-113800-2356r/>>. In the same vein, in 2001, a Mormon 
Fundamentalist was sentenced under Utah law that outlawed plural marriages since 1896, which has been barely invoked over 
the past decades regardless of the state officials' estimate that as many as 30,000 Utahans live in polygamy. See Valerie 
Richardson, Mormon Polygamist - and a Lifestyle - Go on Trial Today, Wash. Times A3 (May 14, 2001)."
565,100," The Court finds Plaintiffs' position that, in order to be ""real law,"" a mandate must be reduced to a recent statute, executive 
order, agency regulation, etc. (i.e., a written statement issued by a government) unduly condescending toward foreign legal 
regimes structured differently from the system used in the United States, Europe, or akin. To illustrate, many prescripts of 
religious law (carrying, on occasion, very severe punishment for non-obedience) were originally orally stated many centuries ago 
-- often, in indefinite and largely aspirational terms selected by authors whose authority and even existence is hard to verify, or in 
terms attributed directly to the Almighty -- but, reduced to non-governmental writings centuries ago, they remain very ""real law"" 
till today, even though they have not been ""re-enacted,"" republished or validated by government stamp, and even though they 
have been coexisting  [**307] with newer religious or civil prescripts rendered with regard to the same issues without reciting the 
contents of the older laws. The same applies with even more force to the countries where there is a complex interplay between 
civil, religious and local customary laws, many of which are unwritten but, nonetheless, enjoy the force of ""real law"" and entail 
very real sanctions. See, generally, Richard Frimpong Oppong, Private International Law in Africa: The Past. Present, and 
Future, 55 Am. J. Comp. L. 677 (2007); Christina Jones-Pauly & Neamat Nojumi, Legal Steps Toward National Reconciliation 
and Reconstruction of Afghanistan, 52 Am. J. Comp. L. 825 (2004); Ruth Lapidoth, The Fundamental Agreement Between the 
Holy See and the State of Israel, 47 Cath. U. L. Rev. 441, 462 (1998). As one judge in this District noted: The legal system in Saudi Arabia is fundamentally different from that of the United States. Western conceptions of the role 
that law plays in society, the legal process, and methods of legal interpretation, often mistakenly assumed to be universal in 
nature, are in many ways poles apart from those concepts in Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia. . . . [T]he Saudi 
Arabia  [**308] legal system is governed exclusively by what is known as the ""Shari'a,"" or divine law. In fact, there are no 
""laws"" in Saudi Arabia other than Islamic law, and any supplemental rules promulgated by the Saudi government are 
actually considered regulations . . . . These regulations, issued under the authority of the King [and] the Council of 
Ministers, are valid only to the extent that they are consistent with Shari'a. The Shari'a is the product of several interrelated 
sources of religious authority. The doctrines comprising Shari'a are derived primarily from the Qur'an, the ""Book of God."" . . 
. Because the Qur'an commands adherents of Islam to obey the Prophet, the recorded examples of the acts and words of "
566,," [Prophet] Muhammed, known as the ""Sunnah,"" constitute an additional integral part of the Shari'a. In the centuries since the 
founding of Islam, Islamic religious-legal scholars . . . have produced opinions known as ""fiqh"" [that must, too, be factored in 
as law]. Nat'l Group for Communs. & Computers Ltd. v. Lucent Techs. Int'l Inc., 331 F. Supp. 2d 290, 294-95 (D.N.J. 2004); accord 
Mannington Mills, 595 F.2d at 1297 (""The legislation and policy of each nation is not likely to be the  [**309] same"")."
566,101," For example, Canon 1 of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct merely states that ""[a] judge shall . . . avoid impropriety and the 
appearance of impropriety,"" without either specifying the meaning of the phrase ""appearance of impropriety"" or consequences 
for a violation of the prescript; this broadly-termed Canon could be viewed as a United States counterpart of a foreign mandate 
directing exercise of professional self-discipline. Accord Brian C. Buescher, Out with the Code and in with the Rules: The 
Disastrous Nebraska ""Bright Line"" Rule for Conflict of Interest: A Direct Consequence of the Shortcomings in the Model Code, 
12 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 717 (1999) (providing a thoughtful discussion of the grounds that might be utilized for questioning of a 
certain negative repercussion, which ensued from the Supreme Court of Nebraska's interpretation of the ""appearance of 
impropriety"" phrase)."
566,102," For instance, the phrase ""Soviet Union"" is composed of two words, the first of which, ""soviet,"" literally means ""advice, opinion, 
consultation."" See V.K. Muller, Russian-English Dictionary 651 (1947). However, it would be wrong to claim that the decisions 
rendered by the Soviet Union upon its subjects were nothing but non-mandatory invitations to unite for consultations. 
Analogously, the phrase ""Supreme Arbitration Court of Russian Federation"" implies the Supreme Court of Russia, Commercial 
Part, a government body that has nothing to do with the process of arbitration,  [**311] as it is known in the United States (i.e., 
the ""Arbitration Court"" obtains jurisdiction on the grounds of the nature of disputes, not because the parties voluntary agreed to 
its jurisdiction, and its decisions are enforced as mandatory legal judgments and not open to the test applicable to arbitral 
awards). See <<http://www.arbitr.ru/eng/>>. This is so regardless of a multitude of United States legal articles, which are written 
by scholars who are well aware of the distinction but, nonetheless, utilize the literal translation ""Arbitration Court,"" i.e., the phrase 
having very different connotations to an American legal ear. See, e.g., Robert Rothenberg, Tatyana V. Melnikova, Comparative 
Forms of Doing Business in Russia and New York State, 40 Am. Bus. L.J. 563 (2003); Hon. Sidney Brooks, The International 
Scene: Russia's March to a Market Economy Assisted by New Bankruptcy Law, Am. Bankr. Institute J. (1998)."
566,103," HN75[
] Translations of foreign provisions, be they actually provided by the parties or obtained by the court from other 
sources, may be used by the court in its determinations of foreign law. See Grand Entm't Group, Ltd. v. Star Media Sales, Inc., 
988 F.2d 476, 489 (3d Cir. 1993); Overseas Dev. Disc Corp. v. Sangamo Constr. Co., 840 F.2d 1319, 1324-1326 (7th Cir. 1988) "
567,," (court relied on translations of Kuwaiti statutes found in a compilation titled ""Business Laws of Kuwait""); Kaho v. Ilchert, 765 F.2d 
877, 881-883 (9th Cir. 1985) (in determining the validity of customary adoptions under the law of Tonga, the court considered an 
interpretation adopted in an earlier case involving same legal prescripts). Although courts may be faced with varying translations 
of the same foreign statute or unauthenticated copies of foreign law, such discrepancies or lack of authentication does not 
prevent a Rule 44.1 resolution. See Pittway Corp. v. United States, 88 F.3d 501, 503, 504, n.1 (7th Cir. 1996) (determining the 
meaning of French statutes notwithstanding inconsistent translations); United States v. First Nat'l Bank, 699 F.2d 341, 344, n.2 
(7th Cir. 1983)  [**315] (determining Greek law after concluding that variations in translations were not substantive); Ramirez v. 
Autobuses Blancos Flecha Roja, S.A., 486 F.2d 493, 497, n.11 (5th Cir. 1973) (reliance on unauthenticated copy of Mexican law 
did not violate Rule 44.1); Forzley v. AVCO Corp. Elecs. Div., 826 F.2d 974, 979, n.7 (11th Cir. 1987) (allowing usage of 
unofficial translation of Saudi Labor Law because there is no such thing as an ""official translation"" of that law)."
567,104," Considerations of ""unwritten law"" appear particularly pertinent to Chinese regulatory regime, which has a substantial history 
of so-called ""drawer regulations."" ""['The drawer regulations'] are regulations . . . issued by various ministries [such regulations], 
even though not labeled secret, have not been publicly disseminated. They are kept in a ministry official's drawer, removed on 
one occasion, and left in the drawer on another . . . . [These regulations] may be applied with an inconsistency permitted by the 
lack of public disclosure."" Michael W. Gordon, Of Aspirations and Operations: The Governance of Multinational Enterprises by 
Third World Nations, 16 U. Miami Inter-Am. L. Rev. 301, 334 (1984). China seems to be still in the process of eradicating this 
mode of administering Chinese law. See Vitamin C, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 549 (observing that ""[t]he [MOFCOM] has been forthright "
568,," in its admission that Chinese  [**319] law is not as transparent as that of the United States or other constitutional or 
parliamentary governments"" and quoting the transcript reading ""the laws of the government of China do not have . . . quite the 
same transparency as the laws of the United States, in the sense that there are statute books that are available, that there are 
lengthy Congressional statements of intent, where you can read what the debates were all about. The way the Chinese system 
operates is that you have the state council and the state council is then composed of a number of key ministries. The 
[MOFCOM] is not some backwater regulator in a small city in China. The [MOFCOM] is the preeminent regulator of the 
economy, export economy of [China]""); see also Resco WDPa, Docket Entry No. 123-4, at 7 (the USTR's Request for a WTO 
Panel with regard to China's export regulation of bauxite, reading ""China does not publish certain measures relating to these 
requirements in a manner that enables governments and traders to become acquainted with them"")."
568,105," It is unclear from the holding of Pink whether the fact that the MOFCOM's statements were addressed to Judge Trager rather 
than this Court should diminish the degree of deference since, in Pink, the statements by the Soviet Union were addressed not 
to the Supreme Court, which relied on the statement for its determination, but to a state court. See Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 62 S. Ct. 
552, 86 L. Ed. 796. "
570,106," A graph of the relationships between the CCCMC and its various ""cartels"" and ""sub-cartels"" of magnesite exporters sketched 
by the parties depicts a structure uncommon to the law of antitrust (which usually deals with polygon-like agreements typical to 
international treaties); rather, it resembles a structure frequent to 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-68, where a hub-and-spoke combination 
may yield an organizational chart akin to an ""exponential tree"" (a graph common to computer science, which resembles a tree 
trunk with multiple levels of branches and twigs)."
570,107," This Court is not entirely clear as to Plaintiffs' logic underlying this argument. A claim that the CCCMC ""is not directed or 
controlled by the government of China"" cannot serve as a premise needed to draw the conclusion that the CCCMC is a ""non-
government body""; this is so because the conclusion is also the premise, since any sovereign can governmentally control/direct 
only its subjects, but not itself."
570,108," The Court gathers from this argument that Plaintiffs read the 1991 ""Measures"" as supporting Defendants' position, although 
the Court is not entirely clear as to whether the Plaintiffs' reading is related to the CCCMC's status or the existence of 
compulsion, or both."
570,109," The Court gathers from this argument that Plaintiffs read the Circular of February 12, 1998, as a document supporting 
Defendants' position, although  [**329] it appears that Plaintiffs' reading is unrelated to the CCCMC's status, since it addresses 
the other issue: compulsion. "
571,110," The Trial Court merely acknowledged that Zhejiang's perceptions of the CCCMC as an NGO were ""borne out by the contents 
of the CCCMC's brochure,"" and that ""the wording [of the brochure was such that it omitted to expressly] contradict [Zhejiang's] 
statements that the [price-fixing] mechanism was not imposed by the State,"" id. PP 141. 153, hence allowing the possibility of 
Zhejiang's qualification for the MET status."
571,111," Indeed, a number of observations made by the Zhejiang Xinan court suggests against deeming the CCCMC an NGO. First, at 
least as of September 2004, that is, halfway through the Class Period in this matter, the EU consistently held that Zhejiang's 
business activities were under such strict governmental control that they were incompatible  [**331] with operations under free 
market conditions and, as part of this strict regime, ""[the Chinese government] had entrusted the . . . CCCMC with the right [to 
approve export] contract[s upon] verifying export prices."" Zhejiang Xinan, 2009 ECJ EUR-Lex LEXIS 529, P 14. Second, the 
Trial Court observed that such governmental powers of the CCCMC were well integrated with governmental powers of other 
Chinese agencies, see id. P 131 (""[Zhejiang concedes that] all export contracts had to be submitted to the CCCMC, which 
checked the selling prices and [approved] the contract if the selling price exceeded the [minimum] price[, plus] China directed the 
Chinese customs authorities not to permit exports . . . unless the contract bore the CCCMC's [approval] ""), and these CCCMC's 
powers were operative at least as of the date of rendition of the Zhejiang Xinan decision. Consequently, the statements of the 
Zhejiang Xinan court: (a) reject Plaintiffs' claim that the CCCMC became an NGO by 1998 (or by 2000); and (b) indicate that the 
CCCMC exercised governmental power through the CCCMC's ability to approve or disapprove an export contract on the 
grounds of the export price. See id. PP 130, 140 (noting  [**332] that there was no dispute -- as to the system, in which the 
CCCMC was an appendage of the state, -- by observing that ""[ t]he Council contends . . . that there was a very efficient control 
system in place, that it was run by [China] through the CCCMC and customs authorities and [the very existence of that system] 
constituted interference by [China] in the setting of [Zhejiang's] export prices"" and that Zhejiang ""d[id] not dispute that [this 
CCCMC's approval and veto] mechanism exist[ed in 2009]""). "
572,112," See Black's Law Dictionary 416 (6th ed. 1990) (defining the phrase ""de facto"" as ""in fact,  [**335] in deed, actually"")."
572,113," Although some natural resources are renewable, the resources falling within the province of the CCCMC appear non-
renewable or renewable at great expense. For instance, magnesite is a non-renewable natural resource, and magnesium oxide, 
while being amenable to production from seawater, see supra, note 17, could be so produced only at substantial expense. "
573,114," The 1991 ""Measures"" stated that ""[the MOFCOM] shall take charge of vocational administration of all . . . trade social 
organizations such as chamber of commerce, . . . which are organized within the territory of . . . China . . . in accordance with 
these Measures. [Such MOFCOM's] administration . . . will be either . . . direct . . . or [through MOFCOM's] authorized 
departments concerned [with the particular social] organizations.""  [**340] Docket Entry No. 35-39, at 2."
573,115," Plaintiffs' Opposition, unfortunately, did not direct the Court's attention to any particular page of this exhibit  [**341] and did 
not quote the language which Plaintiffs read as a support. "
574,116," Notably, since Magnesite from China was a countervailing -- rather than anti-dumping -- proceeding, the Court cannot factor 
in the possibility that Resco, being the petitioner in Magnesite from China, ""accidentally"" referred to the Chinese government: 
this is so because countervailing proceedings are necessarily the proceedings based on a foreign government's (rather than an 
NGO's) interference with the exporters' trade activities. "
575,117," Both  [**347] sides seem to agree that the CCCMC was chartered (and its bylaws were adopted) in 1988, and no 
superceding charter or bylaws were ever registered or even attempted. Since the structure and powers of the CCCMC were 
settled in the charter and bylaws that were adopted: (a) long before Chinese economic reforms began to affect such industry as 
export of China's natural resources, see Animal Sci. Prods. v. China Nat'l Metals & Minerals Imp. & Exp. Corp., 596 F. Supp. 2d 
842, 867 (D.N.J. 2008) (setting the time line): (b) three years prior to the issuance of 1991 ""Measures"" detailing the intertwined 
relationship between the MOFCOM and its ""chambers of commerce,"" see supra note 114; and (c) thirteen years prior to China's 
accession to the WTO, and no changes in charter/bylaws were ever entered or attempted, the Court has no reason to presume 
that the use of the term ""self-discipline"" in the CCCMC's brochure was a sign that the CCCMC transformed into an NGO, or that 
the Chinese mandatory version of term ""self-discipline"" existing at the CCCMC's inception had mutated into a qualitatively 
different Western type of ""self-discipline"" simply as a result of China's accession to the WTO or China's  [**348] decision to start 
a gradual transition from centrally planned economy to socialist market economy. See Barry Naughton, The Chinese Economy: 
Transitions and Growth (MIT Press, 2007) (discussing qualitative differences between a pure market economy and China's 
socialist market economy)."
575,118," ""[T]he term 'NGO' is generally used to mean what its initials stand for -- a 'non-governmental organization' -- a group of 
persons in the private sector working in concert, playing a significant role in the  [**349] public sphere in order to garner support 
for influencing government policies."" Judith Resnik et al., Ratifying Kyoto at the Local Level: Sovereigntism. Federalism, and 
Translocal Organizations of Government Actors (TOGAs), 50 Ariz. L. Rev. 709, 784 (2008); see also Jude L. Fernando & Alan 
W. Heston, The Role of NGOs: Charity and Empowerment: NGOs Between States, Markets and Civil Society, 554 Annals 8 
(1997) (providing a detailed answer to the question ""what is an NGO?""). For instance, the New Jersey State Bar Association 
(""NJBA"") is an NGO. Conversely, the New Jersey Office of Attorney Ethics (""OAE"") is not an NGO; rather, it is an appendage of 
the state: an agency at the New Jersey Supreme Court. However, the attorneys employed by the OAE came to their AOE 
employ after being admitted to practice, and they were and still are subject to the very rules the AOE enforces. Moreover, over 
600 volunteer members of NJ Bar (i.e., members of the industry over which the OAE enjoys investigative and prosecutorial 
powers) work each year on OAE matters initiated against other members of the Bar. Furthermore, the membership fees paid by 
the members of NJ Bar (that is, the ""regulated industry"") fund  [**350] the operations of the OAE, entirely. Finally, the OAE also 
has the power to recommend new rules, which -- upon a notice by the New Jersey Supreme Court -- are commented upon by 
the ""regulated industry"" and issued after these comments are considered. However, none of these features transforms the OAE 
into an NGO, and while non-compliance with a decision rendered by the NJBA (or a non-membership in the NJBA) has no effect 
on the attorney's ability to practice law, a failure to comply with the rules enforced by the OAE (or a failure to pay one's Bar fees 
that fund the OAE) entails punitive consequences verifying the true governmental nature of the OAE's powers. "
576,119," It appears that this conflation of the ""law-coining"" and ""law-enforcement"" aspects is also present in Resco WDPa and Vitamin 
C, since -- in response to the Vitamin C plaintiffs' similar claim the MOFCOM clarified that, [u]nder [Chinese] regulatory system, the parties involved [in exportation must] consult with each other to reach consensus 
on coordinated activities for the purpose of reaching the objectives and serving the interest as set forth under Chinese laws 
and  [**353] policies. [Natural and juridical p]ersons engaged in such required [consultations based on the Chinese version 
of] self-discipline are well aware that they are subject to penalties for failure to participate in such coordination[,] . . . 
including forfeiting their export right. . . . [The] exporters were thus subject to the regulation by the [chamber of commerce], 
including compliance with the [chamber of commerce's] requirements of self-discipline, the very purpose of which was to 
coordinate each exporter's behavior. No . . . exporter could ignore these policies, nor could they abstain from such 
coordination with regard to export price and production volume when asked to by the [chamber of commerce]. The self-
disciplinary system of export coordination also includes meetings and discussions between and among the parties subject 
to the [chamber of commerce's] direction and supervision, and reaching agreements among themselves on taking 
appropriate actions in the interest of the country as a whole. Participation in such discussions, taking a vote and conducting 
other similar activities to reach their final consensus constitutes an integral part of the self-discipline process. [The] 
exporters  [**354] must comply with the above procedures and the agreements reached in compliance with such 
procedures; otherwise, the [chamber of commerce] would be required to exercise its power to penalize those who were in 
violation of such procedures and agreements. Vitamin C, Civil Action No. 06-md-1738 (E.D.N.Y.), Docket Entry No. 400-1, at 2. Hence, even if the question of how the 
minimum price figures came about were relevant to the doctrine of government compulsion, the statement made by the 
MOFCOM unambiguously indicates the exporters' mandatory obligation to partake in deliberations held by the exporters' "
577,," ""chamber of commerce,"" so an attempt to filibuster would cause a substantial punishment. The Court has no reason to presume 
that such compulsion was limited only to the CCMHPC, since all MOFCOM's regulations, circulars, working rules, etc., invariably 
referred to ""chambers of commerce,"" see generally, exhibits docketed in Docket Entries Nos. 98, 99, 109 and 110, i.e., utilized a 
generic definition suggesting that the mandatory obligation to partake in deliberations applied to the CCCMC members (like 
Defendants) as much as it did to the members of the CCMHPC."
577,120," Moreover, HN77[
] the availability of the doctrine of government compulsion cannot depend on the presence or absence of 
any collusion: had it been otherwise, the doctrinal abstention would be limited only to antitrust, racketeering and similar matters 
that require proof of collusion. Consequently, for the purposes of the government compulsion doctrine, it would be a logical error 
to ask whether Defendants reached an agreement to comply with the minimum price requirement. Rather, where the doctrine is 
applicable, such ""agreement"" aspect should be automatically supplied by the defendant's obedience of his/her/its sovereign's 
law: so, if there is an alleged hub-and-spokes agreement, then the foreign sovereign should be viewed as the ""hub."""
577,121," See Docket Entry No. 35-51, at 15 (the MOFCOM's regulation stating that ""[t]he Bidding Committee is entitled to revoke the 
quotas won in the bidding and rescind the qualification for quota bidding . . . of the enterprises which . . . [e]xported at prices 
lower than the regulated prices set forth by relevant . . . chambers of commerce""); see also Docket Entry No. 35-49, at 2-3 (the 
MOFCOM's regulation explaining that the MOFCOM ""shall mete out the following punishments on enterprises which commit 
conducts of exporting at lower-than-normal price: enterprises . . . shall be fined, investigations can also be [conducted] to affix 
the administrative or economic responsibility on the legal representative of the enterprise or any person who is directly 
responsible for the conduct of exporting at lower-than-normal price,"" and stating the definition of ""lower-than-normal 
 [**358] price means [as] the export price [which is] lower than the necessary price for the product[, where the] necessary price 
[is the sum of] the cost for the production . . . , the expenses for storage, transport, insurance and management [plus a] 
reasonable profit""). Defendants' perception that the term ""lower-than-normal price"" used in Docket Entry No. 35-49 has the 
meaning identical to the phrase used in Docket Entry No. 35-51 (""price[] lower than the regulated prices set forth by relevant . . . 
chambers of commerce"") appears warranted since: (a) the phrase ""reasonable profit"" used in Docket Entry No. 35-49 is not 
defined anywhere else; (b) only 37 days passed between the MOFCOM's issuance of Docket Entries No. 35-49 and No. 35-51; 
and (c) the very goal of the CCCMC's price coordination was a determination of what is ""normal profit"" in light of the interest of 
China, as a sovereign under which rule Defendants had to operate and were mandated to prospect in accordance with China's 
vision of how prosperity is to be achieved. See Docket Entry No. 99-11, at 2 (the CCCMC charter, providing that the ""CCCMC is 
authorized . . . to deal with . . . export trade, . . . [t]he aims of [the] CCCMC  [**359] include. . . protecting the legal rights and 
interests of the State[, with] . . . guidance and supervision of [the MOFCOM, by] . . . coordinating commodity prices [as to its 
members'] export""); see also Vitamin C, Civil Action No. 06-md-1738 (E,D.N.Y.), Docket Entry No. 400, at 2 (the MOFCOM's 
statement that ""[n]o . . . exporter could ignore [minimum price] policies"" imposed by its chamber of commerce); accord the 
instant matter, (statement made by MOFCOM Assistant Minister Liu Xiangdong, noting that, ""guided by [the MOFCOM], . . . [the] "
578,," CCCMC has . . . taken many very effective measures to carry out state guidelines, policies and regulations [in order to] 
safeguarded interests of the state and the industry as well as [export] companies, and made outstanding achievements in 
pushing forward the development of [China's] export trade""); Docket Entry No. 35-60, at 2 (the MOFCOM's working rules

with the relevant price limit regulations,"" suggesting that the phrases ""relevant price,"" ""normal price"" and ""minimum price"" 
 [**360] had identical meaning in the MOFCOM's parlance)."
578,122," See Docket Entry No. 35-47, at 6 (the MOFCOM's regulation directing that, ""[w]hen applying for export licences, every export 
enterprise should submit to the licence-issuing body the export permits and contract[, and an] application form . . . for the export 
license. . . . When examining the export contracts, the license-issuing body concerned should pay major attention to the prices of 
the export commodities. . . . When the prices in the export contracts are lower than the coordinated prices by the related import 
and export chamber of commerce, . . . the license-issuing body should refuse to issue the export license""); Docket Entry No. 35-
51, at 14 (the MOFCOM's regulation clarifying that ""[e]vidence [needed for] issuance of export license [include a proof of e]xport 
contract price[, which should be] not less than the prices set forth by the chambers of commerce for . . . exporters""); Docket 
Entry No. 35-53, at 5 (the MOFCOM's circular stating that, ""[w]hen examining an application for an export license, the releasing 
authority shall inspect the contents [of] export contract[,] especially examine [the] price. [The p]rice of goods on  [**361] export 
license shall the same as that in the export contract [and] not lower than the coordinating price regulated by relevant import and 
export commerce commission""); Docket Entry No. 35-56, at 6 (the MOFCOM's provision directing that ""[p]rices of export

agencies shall stress on the examination and verification of the prices of export commodities when examining the export 
contracts, the commodity prices on the export licenses issued shall be the same as the prices in the export contracts; but when 
the prices in the export contracts are lower than the recommended export prices fixed by the relevant chambers of commerce, 
the license issuing agencies shall refuse to issue the export licenses"")."
578,123," Since the range of monetary fines envisioned by the MOFCOM's regulation Docket Entry No. 35-49 is unknown to this Court, 
it appears unwarranted to conclude that such fines must necessarily be a ""severe"" punishment, since these fines might, just as 
well, be of nominal value, even within the meaning of Chinese average income. Moreover, since Docket Entry No. 35-49, at 2-3, 
merely refers to ""legal liability"" of the person responsible for exportation at a ""lower-than-normal"" price, the court concludes that 
it would be an undue generalization to equate this unspecified  [**363] ""legal liability"" to ""penal liability"" (which is a severe 
punishment per se). "
579,124," Even if  [**380] a certain prescript had abolished the minimum price requirement on September 7, 2007, Defendants' conduct 
would still be subject to abstention from the inception of the Class Period (in mid-2000) to September 7, 2007. That might 
effectively dispose of Plaintiffs' claims altogether, since the Amended Complaint ends its account of Defendants' alleged 
collusive activities with the statement that, ""[i]n February 2007, [that is, seven months prior to the issuance of the ""Rules,"" 
unspecified] members of [the ever-changing] Cartel met to discuss a possible agreement to increase the export price,"" Docket 
Entry No. 77, P 64, with no allegations as to any other manifestations of Defendants' alleged post-February 2007 collusion. "
580,125," Even if a certain prescript had abolished the minimum price requirement on November 10, 2004, Defendants' conduct would 
still be subject to abstention from the inception of the Class Period (in mid-2000) to November 10, 2004: for almost half of the 
Class Period."
580,126," Even if a certain prescript had abolished the minimum price requirement on May 25, 2005, Defendants' conduct would still be 
subject to the government compulsion-based abstention from the inception of the Class  [**381] Period (in mid-2000) and until 
May 25, 2005, that is, for more than half of the proposed Class Period."
580,127," Even if a certain prescript had abolished the minimum price requirement on December 10, 2004, Defendants' conduct would 
still be subject to the government compulsion-based abstention from the inception of the Class Period (in mid-2000) and until 
December 10, 2004, that is, for almost half of the Class Period. A foriori, if the ""Measures"" were a statement reinforcing the 
minimum price requirement, this fact could effectively dispose of Plaintiffs' claims altogether, since the Amended Complaint ends 
its account of Defendants' alleged collusive meetings with the statement that, ""[i]n February 2007, [that is, more than a year prior 
to the repeal of the ""Measures,"" unspecified] members of [the ever-changing] Cartel met to discuss a possible agreement to 
increase the export price,"" Docket Entry No. 77, P 64, and provides no facts as to any other manifestations of Defendants' 
alleged post-February 2007 collusion. "
581,128," Moreover, a MOFCOM's regulation issued prior to the ""Measures"" already clarified, while addressing the very same issue of 
the bidding process, that ""[t]he Bidding Committee  [**382] is entitled to revoke the quotas won in the bidding and rescind the 
qualification for quota bidding. . . of the enterprises which . . . [e]xported at prices lower than the regulated prices set forth by 
relevant. . . chambers of commerce."" Docket Entry No. 35-51, at 15; and (b)"
581,129," Even if a certain prescript had abolished the minimum price requirement in December 2001, Defendants' conduct would still 
be subject to the government compulsion-based abstention from the inception of the Class Period (in mid-2000) and until 
December 2001, that is, for about a year and a half of the proposed Class Period. "
582,130," See also Ian Dobinson, the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China (1997): Real Change or Rhetoric?, 11 Pac. Rim L. 
& Pol'y 1, at 22, 55 (Jan. 2002) (where -- just one month after the issuance of the MOFCOM's ""Measures"" discussed in this 
subsection -- the author, a professor of law at the University of Hong Kong, observed that ""[c]ontinuity . . . was applicable to the 
[bulk of the] Standing Committee Decisions and Supplementary Provisions. This principle also related to the numerous 
Interpretations that were issued by the Supreme Court and the Supreme Procuratorate."" The author concluded,  [**383] upon 
conducting a scrupulous study of Chinese legal regime, that ""[t]here is no denying that there has been significant change in the 
law [in China]. . . . Chinese rhetoric concerning [these] reforms has lead to the claim that there has been an adoption of [a new] 
rule of law in China. These changes and the rhetoric are extremely important, but . . . while the [language of the provisions have] 
changed, the underlying principles and policies on which Chinese . . . law is based have not. On the contrary, [the legal] policy, 
in particular, has shown a remarkable continuity and resistance to change"")."
582,131," Even if a certain prescript had abolished the minimum price requirement on December 10, 2004, Defendants' conduct would 
be subject to abstention from the inception of the Class Period (in mid-2000) to December 10, 2004, that is, for almost half of the 
Class Period."
582,132," As the Court already explained, many provisions are treated as ""law"" regardless of the fact that the delegated authority of the 
authors is not -- or cannot -- be established. See supra, note 100 of this Opinion (discussing the sources of religious law and 
customary law that are enforceable regulatory mandates regardless of  [**384] coming about without any ""delegated authority""). "
583,133," Finally, even if the Court were to adopt Plaintiffs' reading of the ""Regulations"" as repealing the actually existing minimum price 
requirement, the logical conclusion of such presumption would be that, until December 10, 2001, Defendants were, in fact, 
subject to the minimum price requirement imposed by the highest governmental body of China which, in turn, calls into question 
Plaintiffs' good faith with respect to their argument that, since the inception of the proposed Class Period, that is, since in mid-
2000, Defendants could not have been subject to any government compulsion as to the minimum price requirement."
583,134," In addition, Plaintiffs dedicate substantial effort  [**385] to asserting that: (a) the ""Detailed Rules for the Implementation of 
Calling for Bids for Light (Dead) Burned Magnesia Export Commodity Quotas (for Trial Implementation),"" which were 
promulgated by the MOFCOM in 1994 and expressly directed both collusive agreement on a particular minimum price as to 
export of magnesite-based products and compliance with that minimum price, had to be deemed repealed by the MOFCOM's "
584,," issuance of 1998 and 1999 rules that addressed the subject of export bidding, and that these 1998 and 1999 rules were, too, 
repealed by the MOFCOM's 2001 ""Measures for Administration of Export Commodities Quotas and the 2001 Measures for the 
Invitation of Bid for Export Commodity Quotas""; and (b) this chain of enactments necessarily discarded the minimum price 
requirements because, ""[u]nder Chinese law, [the later enacted rules] prevail over any conflicting provisions in prior rules 
governing the same subject matter."" Opp. at 22-23 (citing to Docket Entries Nos. 35-44 (the 1994 ""Rules""); 35-57 (one 2001 
""Measure""); and 35-58 (another 2001 ""Measure"")). The Court studied Docket Entries Nos. 35-44, 35-57 and 35-58 but failed to 
locate any language in Docket Entries Nos. 35-57  [**386] and 35-58 conflicting with the minimum price-related language in 
Docket Entry No. 35-44. Conversely, the MOFCOM's statements that ""[t]he export enterprises shall file the [export] quota 
applications [together with] the relevant documents [that are] according to the requirements"" (included in the language of Docket 
Entry No. 35-57, at 4) and that ""[an export bid that is] lower than the minimum limit shall be deemed as an invalid one"" (included 
in Docket Entry No. 35-58, at 5) appear fully in coherence -- or, at the very least, easily harmonizable and certainly not in conflict 
with the MOFCOM's 1994 requirement that ""[the bidding] price for export shall not be lower than the . . . price determined by [the 
CCCMC]."" See Docket Entry No. 35-44, at 4."
584,135," Inductive logic is the mode of reasoning by detecting a general conclusion from a set of specific facts. See United States v. 
McGlory, 968 F.2d 309, 334 (3d Cir. 1992)  [**388] (illustrating the process of inductive reasoning by quoting the Supreme 
Court's observation in Bourjaily v. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 179-80, 107 S. Ct. 2775, 97 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1987), which 
explained that ""[i]ndividual pieces of evidence, insufficient in themselves to prove a point, may [--] in cumulation [--] prove it. The 
sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be greater than its constituent parts. Taken together, these two propositions 
demonstrate that a piece of evidence, unreliable in isolation, may become quite probative when corroborated by other 
evidence""). "
585,136," Plaintiffs erroneously assert that the CCCMC could not be a true enforcement arm of the Chinese government simply 
because the CCCMC's website describes it as a ""self-disciplined organization."" See Opp. at 24. However, the MOFCOM clearly 
indicated that it intended to use  [**395] the term ""self-discipline"" in its Chinese meaning, i.e., as a mandate conveying the 
members' obligation to obey and be ruled by their ""chambers of commerce,"" see Vitamin C, Civil Action No. 06-md-1738 "
586,," (E,D.N.Y.), Docket Entry No. 400-1, at 3, and the Court has no reason to presume that the CCCMC, being directly controlled by 
the MOFCOM, defined itself by using the American rather than the Chinese meaning of the phrase ""self-discipline."" See, e.g., 
Wang Xiaoye, The Prospect of Antimonopoly Legislation in China, 2002 Wash. U. Glob. Studies 2001, 208-09, available at 
<<http://law.wustl.edu/wugsh/issues/volume1/p201Wang.pdf>> (where the author, a professor of law at the Chinese Academy of 
Social Studies, being unaffiliated with any litigation, observed that ""[o]ne always should view 'industrial self-discipline prices' as a 
synonym for government intervention in price competition among enterprises. In August 1998, the State Economic and Trade 
Commission [of China] issued its 'Opinions On Self-Discipline Pricing For Certain Industrial Products,' which, on the grounds that 
it was necessary to end price wars and disorderly competition, demanded that the producers of certain industrial products 
 [**396] observe the minimum price limits set by their respective trade associations. . . . 'Industrial self-discipline prices' operate 
as a type of compulsory price cartel because they force enterprises to sell their products according to 'coordinated prices' . . . 
which [are] based . . . on the average costs within a particular industry [and, thus, necessarily] exceed[] the individual costs of . . 
. efficient enterprises[; that, in turn,] restrict[s] the scope of price reduction for these enterprises and deprive[s] them of the 
opportunity to expand their production and operation"") (footnote omitted)."

Rev. Books 30, 35 (Dec. 2, 1993). Abductive reasoning permits use of a known rule in order to explain  [**398] an observation: 
the statement ""if it rains, the grass is wet"" is an example, since the technically correct observation should be an Occam razor ""if 
the grass is wet, the most probable explanation is that it recently rained."" Piercian philosophy is manifested in human tendency 
to accept one's word as one knows it, and it has become an indelible part of the United States jurisprudence after the decisions 
written by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Brandeis, Benjamin Cardozo and Learned Hand, who transformed American legal 
formalism into contextualism. See Richard A. Posner, The Problems of Jurisprudence 26-28 & n.41 (1990); Robert L. Hayman 
Jr. & Nancy Levit, Jurisprudence 453 (1994); see also Wilson Huhn, The Five Types of Legal Arguments 13-68 (2002); Jeremy 
Paul, The Politics of Legal Semiotics, 69 Tex. L. Rev. 1779 (1991); accord Warner v. Goltra, 293 U.S. 155, 156, 55 S. Ct. 46, 79 
L. Ed. 254 (1934) (Cardozo, J., utilizing the ""policy of liberal construction"" to correct a prior line of cases where ""verbal niceties 
were bent to the over-mastering purpose of the [law]""). Thus, Defendants' correlation of the monitoring/enforcement by the 
CCCMC to the stream of prescripts creating the legal regime and to the possible  [**399] maximum punishment is a valid 
exercise in contextual logic. "
588,138," Note 22 of the Amended Complaint refers the Court to CEH, the document seemingly central to Lamb's Report. See supra 
note 26 of this Opinion (observing that CEH was not attached to Lamb's Report, and the Court could only locate the ""product 
review"" titled ""Magnesium Oxide and Other Magnesium Chemicals"" online which allows the reader only the table of contents but, 
otherwise, 
requires 
a 
$ 
3,000 
subscription, 
see 
<<http://www.sriconsulting. 
com/cgi- bin/listoptions.pl?/CEH/Public/Reports/747.2000/>>). Same as Lamb's Report, Plaintiffs' Opposition, in footnote 3, referred to 
this ""product review"" and advised the Court that certain ""excerpts [of this 'product review' were] attached [to Plaintiffs' 
Opposition] as Exhibit 2."" Opp. at 14, n.3. However, the Declaration of Robert A. Magnanini (""Magnanini Declaration""), also 
attached to the Opposition, advises the Court that ""[a]ttached hereto as Exhibit 2 is a . . . copy of the Comments  [**404] from 
the [CCCMC] to [the DOC]."" Docket Entry No. 105-2, at 2. Giving Plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt, the Court examined the 
entire Magnanini Declaration and all exhibits attached to the Opposition in order to determine whether the promised excerpts of 
CEH were attached as an exhibit other than Exhibit 2, but detected no such exhibit. See, generally, Docket Entry No. 105-2. 
Since Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint was also accompanied by certain exhibits, the Court -- in order to ensure fairness to 
Plaintiffs -- also examined all those exhibits aiming to locate these excerpts of CEH, but detected none. See Docket Entries Nos. 
77-1, 77-2 and 77-3. Therefore, the Court has no information as to either the content or reliability of CEH statements on the 
basis of which Plaintiffs reached their conclusion that Defendants' costs were lower than the costs of the remaining less-than-
thirty percent of Chinese exporters. Moreover, it is unclear to the Court how could CEH authors possibly provide such 
information since: (a) in order to make an accounting determination as to average costs, data was needed as to the actual 
identities and actual fixed and variable costs (plus marginal costs) of each  [**405] member of such ""sub-cartels,"" as well as to 
the identities and the corresponding costs of alleged non-members of these ""sub-cartels,"" see Cascade Health Solutions v. 
PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 909 (9th Cir. 2008) (detailing the calculation of per-unit cost); (b) CEH, not being a member of the 
CCCMC, could not have access to Defendants' (and other CCCMC members') accounting data, which was disclosed only 
internally; and (c) any public information upon which the authors of CEH could have relied had to be facially insufficient, because 
the Chinese Accounting Standards (""CAS""), rather than Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (""ASBE""), governed the 
disclosure requirement until January 1, 2007 (that is, until six years after CEH was produced), see, e.g., 
<<http://www.chinaorbit.com/ china-economy/chinese-accounting- standards.html>>, and -- unlike the ASBE (which still differ 
from and are perceived as less stringent than the International Accounting Standards (""IAS""), see, e.g., Songlan Peng, Chinese 
Accounting Standards (VDM Verlag Dr. Mueller e.K. 2007)) --the CAS required only a limited disclosure of the enterprise's 
accounting and financial data, and, in addition, directed  [**406] the accounting approaches, which -- under the IAS and the 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles United States -- should be qualified as data distortion. See Michael E. Burke IV, 
China's Stock Markets and the World Trade Organization, 30 Law & Pol'y Int'l Bus 321, 363-64 (1999) (""[the CAS] require that 
fixed assets be stated at cost[,] . . . inventories [be] stated at cost [too,] . . . [d]epreciation [information be distorted because] 
residual value [could not be disclosed in excess of] 3% to 5% of original cost[,] . . . [p]re-operating expenses [had to be] 
amortized in equal installments over five years [rather than as they were in reality], [s]hareholder equity [had to be] valued at the 
official rate [rather than at market rate, and] bad debts [could not be disclosed in excess of] 0.3% to 0.5% of total receivables"") 
(relying on CAS provisions discussed in detail in Matthew Harrison, Asia-Pacific Securities Markets (2d ed. 1994), and Deloitte 
Touche Tohmatsu International, International Tax and Business Guide: People's Republic of China (1997))."
588,139," Moreover, it seems that Plaintiffs' position could be reduced to a concession that the entire Chinese magnesite industry 
complied with the minimum price requirement, but Defendants and their unidentified ""co-conspirators"" were not ""truly compelled"" 
because they embraced the law willingly, while the Remaining Exporters ""rebelled responsibly"" by complying with the minimum "
589,," price out of business necessity but being ""emotionally opposed"" to the legal regime and ""hypothetically willing"" to not comply 
 [**408] with its requirement. The Court cannot accept Plaintiffs' assertion of such hypothetical rebellion by unspecified 
enterprises as a proof that the risk of punishment was not actually present. Moreover, Plaintiffs' reference to unspecified ""co-
conspirators"" of Defendants, see supra note 14 of this Opinion, allows for a conclusion that, after 2001, all exporters became 
Defendants' ""co-conspirators"" by abandoning their hypothetical rebellion and willingly embracing the minimum price requirement."
589,140," Plaintiffs' Quota-allotment Point appears particularly duplicitous in light of Plaintiff Resco's claim to the ITA that China has 
successfully utilized the process of export quota allotment (jointly with China's minimum price  [**410] requirement) to achieve 
compulsive control over the business practices of Chinese exporters dealing in magnesite-based goods. See Magnesite from 
China, 74 Fed. Reg. 68,247-48 (""[China] has established export quotas and a minimum acceptable export sales price (i.e., 
export restraints) for a number of raw materials, including three types of magnesi[te] used in the production of [the products at 
issue in the instant matter. All Chinese] exporters of magnesi[te] are subject to these export restraints"")."
589,141," Plaintiffs' reading of Sisal Sales is virtually identical to the reading of Sisal Sales by the plaintiffs in In re Refined Petroleum 
Prods. Antitrust Litig., 649 F. Supp. 2d 572 (S.D. Tex. 2009). The Refined Petroleum court provided a detailed discussion of 
Sisal Sales and carefully explained why the holding of Sisal Sales does not apply to the scenario where a foreign sovereign 
creates -- and/or directs compliance with -- the prescript that lies at the root of the defendants' conduct. See Refined Petroleum, 
649 F. Supp. 2d at 590-91. Hence, for the reasons provided by the Refined Petroleum court, Plaintiffs' position is without merit. 
Similarly, Plaintiffs' reliance  [**412] on Continental Ore is misplaced: in that matter, the Supreme Court dealt with a scenario 
where ""nothing . . . indicate[d] that [the foreign sovereign's] law in any way compelled [the defendants' conduct,]"" and where 
""there [was] no indication that . . . any . . . official within the structure of the [foreign] Government approved or would have 
approved [the defendants' conduct] or directed that [conduct]."" Continental Ore, 370 U.S. at 706-07. "

591,143," Adam Smith is perceived as the father of political economics. His ""Theory of Moral Sentiments"" (1756) and his magnum opus 
""The Wealth of Nations"" (1776) set the framework of what is known as laissez-faire market economy, driven by the invisible 
hand consisting of such forces as self-interest, competition, and supply and demand. See Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. 
v. Public Service Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557, 592, 100 S. Ct. 2343, 65 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1980) (Rehnquist, J. dissenting) (detailing the 
concept of the invisible hand and discussing Smith's influence on the theories of markets); Hume v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 
Inc., 121 F.2d 336,338-45 (2d Cir. 1941) (same). The concepts articulated by John Maynard Keynes in ""The General Theory of 
Employment, Interest and Money,"" published in 1936, altered laissez-faire economics by introducing the  [**420] concept of a 
""mixed economy,"" based predominantly on private sector but, nonetheless, envisioning a large role played by the government. 
See Ronconi v. Larkin, 253 F.3d 423, 427 and n. 3 (9th Cir. 2001) (summarizing the rationale of Keynesian economics); see also 
United States Dep't of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 724, 110 S. Ct. 1428, 108 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1990) (quoting Keynes' famous 
justification for governmental intervention, ""[i]n the long run, we are all dead""). It appears that the MOFCOM's Comments were 
referring to the Keynesian model widely employed by many current nations. "
592,144," China covers 9,596,961 square kilometers, being just slightly smaller than the United States, and is the fourth largest country 
in the world. See, e.g., <<https://www.cia.gov/library/ publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html>>. Climate conditions, 
infrastructure, technical advancement, cost of labor, standards of living, etc., differ dramatically throughout China, although some 
of these differences are gradually dissipating. See, e.g., Stephen L. Morgan, Richer and Taller: Stature and Living Standards in 
China, 1979-1995,  [**424] The China Journal 44 (July 2000) (discussing the differences between regions at the end of the 20th 
century). Therefore, it would be improper for this Court to presume that the ""minimum price"" was necessarily a single figure 
rendered for a country-wide application: indeed, such ""one price"" approach is typical only to a centrally planned economy, with 
which China is trying to part. Rather, China's decision to transition to a socialist market economy appears far more compatible 
with an initial balkanization of the industry and a ""schedule of minimum prices"" factoring in the peculiarities of different locales, 
state or private ownership of the enterprises, size of production facilities, length of export license operation, etc., with 
progressive harmonization of such schedule later on, as the differences in the exporters' operations fade out. The Court, being a 
United States district court, is not in the position to fancy the political or economic considerations utilized by the CCCMC/ 
MOFCOM throughout a decade of administrative regulations: the federal courts tend to avoid second guessing even the 
expertise of the agencies operating in the United States, see, e.g., Browning-Ferris Indus. of South Jersey, Inc. v. Muszynski, 
899 F.2d 151, 160 (2d Cir. 1990)  [**425] (""HN81[
] [c]ourts should be particularly reluctant to second-guess agency choices 
involving [technical matters] that are in the agency's province of expertise""), and they are certainly not in the position to render 
on or guess the considerations falling within the expertise of a foreign agency."
592,145," The Court is not entirely clear as to the rationale underlying Plaintiffs' citations to the paragraphs in the Amended Complaint 
that state either irrelevant information or factless self-serving conclusions, i.e., Paragraph One (asserting that ""[t]his case arises 
out of a conspiracy among all Defendants and their co-conspirators that has the purpose and effect of fixing prices of magnesite 
and magnesite products""); Paragraph Fifty-Five (asserting that, ""[a]s a result of [Defendants'] agreements, despite slumping "
593,," demand, the price of magnesite products imported from China to the United States increased during 2000""); Paragraph Sixty-
Five (asserting that, ""[d]ue to the efforts to increase prices at the end of 2003, the [unified] Cartel achieved significant price 
increases in the U.S., stabilized U.S. prices, and avoided major price cutting despite low levels of demand""); and Paragraph 
Sixty-Eight (asserting  [**426] that ""Defendants' decision to enter into the per se unlawful agreements . . . was and is wholly 
voluntary"")."
593,146," Exhibits 6-9, 11-14, 16-17, and 19-20 replicate: (a) China Jiayuan Magnesite Export Group, Engineering & Mining J. (Aug. 1,

(i) Magnesite Export Industry Self-regulatory Group - The China Magnesite Forum, A Statement by the CCCMC of Mar. 24, 
2003; and (j) United States Surveys for 2004 and 2006. Exhibit 15 does not address the issue of ""cartelization""; rather, it 
reproduces a statement by Liu Jianwei, the head of Legal Services Department of the CCCMC, stating that the CCCMC 
 [**427] ""is a non-government organization"" but, nonetheless, it acts ""as a bridge between the government and its [2600] 
members,"" thus suggesting that the CCCMC is an appendage of China within the meaning of Chinese version of socialist market 
economy. Exhibit 18, Docket Entry 77-2, presents no information as to the issue of ""cartel-creation."" Exhibit 20, Docket Entry 77-
3, at 13-14, advocates against Plaintiffs' position since the Exhibit states that, ""[o]f critical importance was the introduction of 
controls on export prices and volumes by China's central government in 1994, which had an immediate and lasting effect on 
minerals trade from China . . . . Export licenses [are] unique to China but has transformed the trade in certain minerals from 
China to the West. China's central government, through the [CCCMC], implemented its export license system [since] 1994 . . . to 
enable stricter control of export volumes and prices [and] reduce smuggling."" The Court is not entirely clear as to why Plaintiffs' 
rely on Exhibit 20. "
594,147," As the Court pointed out in its notes 104 and 145 of this Opinion, the Court is mindful of the possibility that the minimum price 
figures might exist in the form of complex schedules and might even be available for verification only through testimonial rather 
than documentary evidence in light of the secrecy shrouding the process of Chinese minimum price creation and compliance. 
Accord Vitamin C, 584 F. Supp. 2d at 553 (observing that the charter of the CCMHPC required its members to strictly follow the 
minimum price but simultaneously directed them keep this matter ""confidential"")."
594,148," An SMP scenario is, in its workings, identical to the scenario where the governmental minimum price figures are unknown to 
Defendants/Chinese government bodies because, there, any agreement privately reached between the parties as to the sale 
at/above a certain minimum price would automatically be an SMP agreement, with the SMP equal to itself (SMP minus zero). 
Conversely, if the governmentally-imposed minimum price is known to Defendants/Chinese government bodies, then the entities 
that purchased these  [**434] defendants' goods could have suffered the base injury equal to the market-forces-unrelated share 
of the SMP (where the SMP is the difference between the price actually charged and the government-compelled minimum 
price). Accord Docket Entry No. 77-1, at 70 (Plaintiffs' Exhibit 17, a United States Survey discussing increases in Chinese 
magnesium oxide prices ""[b]ecause of increasing prices in China for fuel coke and increasing freight costs"" and, hence, 
suggesting, that price increases could be a result of market forces unrelated to collusion); Docket Entry No. 77-3, at 3 (a United "
595,," States Survey suggesting the same by noting China's imposition of a new 10% export tax on the export of magnesite-based 
goods in 2007); see also Docket Entry No. 35-59, at 3 (the MOFCOM's 2004 regulation that prompts the same conclusion by 
informing the reader about China's reduction of its magnesite export stimulus, which existed in the form of ""rebate"" allowing 
exporters to keep prices low); Docket Entry No. 35-63, at 2 (the MOFCOM's 2005 regulation informing the industry about 
complete elimination of this magnesite export stimulus)."
595,149," The Court stresses that Plaintiffs and  [**437] Defendants' facts cannot be ""sketched"": they must be established in detail. 
Simply put, the Court will not credit Plaintiffs' assertions that --regardless of a decade of United States importation of thousands 
of tons of magnesite-based products from China -- all (or the bulk of) documentary evidence verifying such transactions 
disappeared and all witnesses, too, developed a memory failure. Accord supra note 64 of this Opinion. State and federal courts 
consistently refused to accept such ""dog ate my homework"" defense/evidentiary submission, and the Court will not change this 
rule. See Lowe v. McGraw-Hill Cos., 361 F.3d 335, (7th Cir. 2004) (refusing to accept the claim that evidence vanished and 
noting ""[t]his 'the dog ate my homework' defense [is] no defense at all"") (citing In re Riggs, 240 F.3d 668, 670 (7th Cir. 2001)); 
Allen v. Dockery, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27447, at *4-5 (M.D. Ga. Apr. 4, 2008) (""Such an excuse, which sadly sounds like the 
proverbial and desperate 'dog ate my homework' defense, is not legally sufficient""); Alsentzer v. Bulboff, 2006 N.J. Super. 
Unpub. LEXIS 816 (N.J. Super. App. Div. Jan. 26, 2006) (""[The trial court correctly] observed that [the litigant's] excuses 
 [**438] for the lack of evidence most closely resembled 'the dog ate my homework' [defense]. Yet, in this case, we have no dog, 
[and even] no x-ray of the dog, to establish . . . an appropriate excuse"") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In the 
same vein, the Court will not allow Plaintiffs to conduct discovery of to the entire Chinese magnesite industry in search for the 
entities, which Plaintiffs might deem suitable defendants for purposes of their re-amended pleadings, i.e., the entities that were 
importers of goods into the United States. Similarly, the Court will not accept re-amended pleadings failing to state the identities 
of the entities that entered into SMP agreements or to detail the facts/circumstances of such SMP agreements, as well as the 
prices of these SMP agreements. Accord Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1954 (""[The plaintiff] is not entitled to discovery [where the 
complaint asserts some wrongs] ""generally, [i.e., as] a conclusory allegation [since] Rule 8 does not [allow] pleading the bare "
596,," elements of [the] cause of action [and] affix[ing] the label 'general allegation' [in hope of developing actual facts through 
discovery]""); Am. Compl. at 4 (expressly stating that  [**439] this matter is not based on any parallel pricing by any Defendant). 
Simply put, Plaintiffs' belief that they suffered an injury cannot substitute for a valid complaint. Accord Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. 137, 
119 S. Ct. 1167, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (explaining that the law of evidence eliminates claims based on ""phantom"" injuries, i.e., 
cases involving actual harms, in a literal sense, but unwieldy in a legal sense for the lack of means to trace the injury to a 
specific action of a specific defendant); compare Opp. at 10 (where Plaintiffs, inexplicably, claim that ""[t]he only remarkable 
feature of [the] Amended Complaint is the specificity with which agreements on price are alleged and the accompanying 
documentary evidence supporting those allegations,"" even though the Amended Complaint's allegations, e.g., as to the last 
""conspiratorial"" meeting, are limited to a mere statement that, ""[on] February 2007, [unspecified] members of the Cartel met [at 
unspecified location] to discuss a possible agreement to increase the export price [to an unspecified level]""). "

601,5," In accordance with the well-settled law of this Circuit, along with the Complaint, in deciding this Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, 
the court will consider those documents submitted by the parties which are matters of public record or which are deemed 
included in the Complaint. See Pani, M.D. v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, 152 F.3d 67, 75 (2d Cir. 1998) (noting that it is 
""well-established"" that a court may rely on matters of public record in deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss); see also Sira 
v. Artuz, 380 F.3d 57, 67 (2d Cir. 2004) (noting that a court deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) may consider all 
documents included in the complaint whether by attachment as an exhibit, through incorporation by reference, or because the 
documents are ""integral"" to the pleading) (internal citations omitted). However, as discussed further infra,  [**8] note 18, the 
court declines to consider those documents submitted by plaintiffs to support allegations first raised in their motion papers and 
found nowhere in the Complaint. See, e.g., Wright v. Ernst & Young LLP, 152 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 1998) (noting a party is not 
entitled to amend pleadings through statements made in motion papers). "
602,6," The court notes that while plaintiffs allege a conspiracy involving both passenger fares and surcharges (Compl. P 1), the sole 
agreement alleged in the Complaint involved Resolution 001w, which plaintiffs allege concerned only fuel surcharges (Compl. 
PP 60, 62, 70)."
602,7," In what appears to be an alternative argument, in their motion papers, but not in their Complaint, plaintiffs also contend that 
apparently aside from agreeing to implement Resolution 001w without DOT approval as alleged in the Complaint, (P 70), 
defendants used the IATA discussions of Resolution 001w as a ""pretextual device for a much deeper level of pricing discussions 
and agreements that were never submitted to the DOT, never received governmental approval, and never received DOT 
antitrust immunization."" (See Pls. Mem. at 21.) Plaintiffs do not allege what specific agreement, if any, resulted from such 
""discussions"" or whether such agreement, if one existed, was ever implemented."
602,8," The Complaint later alleges that  [**13] the defendants went forward with charging uniform surcharges even without DOT 
approval ""as previously agreed upon"" during the July 2003 IATA Tariff Conference, apparently in reference to the adoption of 
Resolution 001w. (See Compl. PP 70, 72.) Although plaintiffs allege that ""it appears that [d]efendants . . . decided to adopt the 
terms of Resolution 001w during May and August 2004 absent DOT approval,"" (Compl. P 70), plaintiffs do not allege that the 
defendants actually agreed to do so at the July 2003 Tariff Conference or at any later date. "
603,9," However, plaintiffs' motion papers characterize these discussions as a ""meeting of the minds"" regarding surcharge amounts. 
(Pls. Mem. at 8.)"
603,10," The allegations in the Complaint refer to various currencies. For ease of comparison, the court cites both the Complaint's 
figures as well as defendants' calculations of those figures in equivalent United States dollars at the relevant time (Defs. Mem. at 
5) which are undisputed by plaintiffs (see generally Pls. Mem.)."
603,11," Plaintiffs have not disputed defendants' calculation that at the relevant time, 5-15 Euros was equivalent to $ 6.09 - $ 18.21 
USD. (See Compl. PP 73, 80; see also Defs. Mem. at 5.)"
603,12," However, plaintiffs' motion papers make allegations, again not contained in the Complaint, asserting that at a July 2005 IATA 
Tariff Conference, ""air carriers agreed to resume distribution of an 'index for fuel prices'"" without alleging the actual existence or 
use of such an index. (Pls. Mem. at 8-9 (citing Scoville Decl. Ex. 5), 12.). "

605,15," See  [**21] Press Release, DOJ, at 2 (Aug. 1, 2007), available at http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pr/2007/August/07_at_569.html."
605,16," The court notes that the briefs of counsel on the present motion, filed in March 2009, cite and discuss Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 
127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929, but do not discuss Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868, which was decided in May 
2009. However, neither party requested leave of the court to discuss Iqbal in a supplemental brief, nor did the court request 
additional briefing. However, the court notes that although Iqbal further clarified the principles enunciated in Twombly and that 
those principles apply to ""all civil actions,"" as opposed to antitrust actions, Iqbal did not alter or add any new concept to the 
Twombly principles. See 129 S. Ct. at 1953 (internal quotation and citation omitted). Both parties, however, submitted letter 
briefs construing the Second Circuit's recent holding in Starr, 592 F.3d 314, as further support for their respective positions. (See 
Pls. 2/4/10 Ltr.; Defs. 2/8/10 Ltr.) This opinion considers all three decisions in light of the record before the court. "
607,17," Plaintiffs also allege that a 3% fare increase announced by a single defendant allegedly ""in line with IATA adjustments"" is 
""direct evidence"" of conspiracy. (Compl. P 77; see also Pls. Mem. at 8 (""A few days after discussing  [**28] the 3% increase with 
the other Defendants . . . Lufthansa announced that it would implement the 3% increase 'in response to the oil price increase 
and to the latest recommendation by the [IATA]."").) The Complaint does not allege whether or when any 3% fare increase was 
implemented, if ever, either by any defendant or any other party. Because a conspiracy necessarily involves more than a single 
participant, and because the Complaint fails to articulate how the isolated announcement of a sole defendant can constitute 
direct evidence of conspiracy, the court declines to further consider this argument."
607,18," The  [**30] Complaint itself contains only one allegation of direct evidence of illegal agreement. (See Compl. P 88 (""But for 
[d]efendants' anti-competitive conduct . . . [d]efendants would have been unable to implement the July 2003 agreement and 
increase and sustain the prices of their fares and passenger surcharges."").) Yet plaintiffs' motion papers attempt to characterize 
the discussions at the May 2004 IATA Tariff conference as a ""meeting of the minds"" regarding the imposition of surcharge 
adjustments. (Compare Compl. P 75-77 and Pls. Mem. at 8.) Thus, it appears that plaintiffs' motion papers may also intend to 
offer the May 2004 IATA Tariff Conference discussion of fuel surcharges as additional direct evidence of conspiracy. However, 
the court disregards these allegations which are first raised in plaintiffs' motion papers because it is well-settled that a claim for 
relief may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Wright, 152 F.3d at 178. Similarly, the 
court cannot consider plaintiffs' conclusory arguments regarding the alleged agreement to circulate a passenger fuel surcharge 
price index which is first raised in their briefs and nowhere discussed  [**31] in the Complaint. (Compare Compl. and Pls. Mem. 
at 8-9, 12, 21-22.) Regardless, even had such allegations been included in the Complaint, they would still be insufficient to state 
a plausible claim for relief, as discussed fully infra. "
609,19," Plaintiffs' analogy to United States v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 507 F. Supp. 412 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), fails to correct this 
deficiency and show that implementation of Resolution 001w would be ""an illegal price restraint"" even if it ""did not set specific 
prices."" (See Pls. Mem. at 20-21.) The Columbia Pictures court found that defendants' agreement to use a ""rather complex 
allocation formula"" to value films they had contributed to a joint venture constituted an illegal price restraint under the Sherman 
Act. See Columbia Pictures, 507 F. Supp. at 420 (""The movie companies have thus agreed on the price for their motion pictures, 
replacing the prices that would normally be set by the marketplace with a transaction between themselves and [the joint venture] 
that places a value on each film within a minimum and maximum range, and allocates revenues to the movie companies for their 
pictures by a formula.""). Here, the Complaint does not allege the use of a common pricing formula, or any formula to set fuel 
surcharges. Therefore, Columbia Pictures is factually  [**38] distinct and inapplicable to this case. "
611,20," The Starr court first noted that the allegation regarding defendants' adherence to a price floor was ""obviously conclusory"" 
(Starr, 592 F.3d at 319 n.2), but later listed defendants' use of MFNs to ""enforce a wholesale price floor of about 70 cents per 
song"" as an example of plaintiffs' ""non-conclusory  [**45] factual allegations of parallel conduct,"" (id. at 323). "
613,21," Although, as noted supra, plaintiffs' motion papers raise certain allegations not contained in the Complaint, even  [**53] if the 
Complaint were amended yet again to include such allegations, the Complaint would still fail to cure the deficiencies identified 
supra and state a plausible claim for relief sufficient to withstand defendants' motions to dismiss. "
616,1," Though these motions vary to a certain degree, most of the discussion overlaps. Where necessary, I will discuss the motions 
separately."
616,2," For purposes of considering a motion to dismiss, ""[a]ll well-pleaded facts, as distinguished from conclusory allegations, must be 
taken as true."" Ruiz v. McDonnell, 299 F.3d 1173, 1181 (10th Cir. 2002) (quoting Swanson v. Bixler, 750 F.2d 810, 813 (10th 
Cir. 1984)). Accordingly, these facts are drawn exclusively from Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, Doc. 130."
616,3," Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed Defendants Sunoco, Inc., Doc. 144; B.P. America, Inc.; and Stone Energy Corporation, 
Doc. 158."
616,4," As Operator Defendants note in their Reply Memorandum in Support of their Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 146, the magnitude of 
these risks is illustrated by ""the enormous environmental damage and huge liability to the operator that resulted from alcohol 
abuse on the Exxon  [*8] Valdez tanker . . .."" Id. at 3. "
617,5," In light of these safety concerns and in part because of the de-centralized nature of its workforce, one or more of the Operator 
Defendants (including, but not limited to, EnCana Oil & Gas, Marathon Oil Company, Shell, and others) have in the past 
supported and collaborated in efforts to ""define the standard [for] health, safety, & environmental orientation for US upstream oil 
and gas industry."" Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, Doc. 130, p. 13 (quoting the SafeLandUSA website). Through these 
efforts, participating Operator Defendants sought to secure ""reciprocal agreements"" regarding acceptance of training certification 
and ""access to orientation records through a common database."" Id."
617,6," TPA Services are a discrete type of service; no other services can be reasonably interchanged or substituted for the testing of 
employees or potential employees for their use of alcohol or drugs."
617,7," The DCC database currently contains information on more than 1 million individuals and includes participation of more than 
thirty-eight hundred companies."
617,8," This is similar to the ""LA Clean Card"" program created by DISA and several of Operator Defendants in the 1990s. Though 
Plaintiffs note the similarity, they do not specify which Operator Defendants participated in this program."
617,9," Some of the Operator Defendants, however, do not themselves use DISA or the DCC database in administering drug and 
alcohol screening for their own employees, independent contractors, or consultants."
617,10," As will be discussed infra at p. 14, n. 20, Plaintiffs have only offered proof that some of the Operator Defendants entered into 
agreements with DISA."
617,11," The fungibility of these services is demonstrated by the fact that DISA has sub-contracted sample collection and testing back 
to some of the very TPAs who lost their Service Company clients to DISA after the implementation of the DCC Database. "
618,12," Like Plaintiffs, DISA also provides its TPA Services on a stand-alone basis for its customers."
618,13," The Service Companies pay all expenses associated with DISA's TPA Services and the DCC database. The Operators do not 
directly pay any of the costs of these services."
618,14," For instance, unlike many of the Plaintiffs, DISA does not offer on-site sample collection and testing as part of its TPA 
Services."
618,15," By means of illustration, Service Company representatives attending a meeting of the Association of Energy Service 
Companies repeatedly informed representatives of TPA Service providers that their Service Companies could not send TPA 
work to those providers because they had to use DISA."
618,16," Significantly, in formulating this standard the Twombly court was particularly aware of and concerned with the unusually high 
cost of discovery in antitrust cases, such as the case at hand. See 550 U.S. at 559 (quoting Dura Pharms., Inc. v. Broudo, 544 
U.S. 336, 347, 125 S. Ct. 1627, 161 L. Ed. 2d 577 (2005)) (""Probably, then, it is only by taking care to require allegations that 
reach the level suggesting conspiracy that we can hope to avoid the potentially enormous expense of discovery in cases with 'no 
reasonably founded hope that the [discovery] process will reveal relevant evidence' to support a § 1 claim""). "
619,17," As will be briefly discussed infra at p. 34, Plaintiffs also allege violations of § 3 of the Clayton Act. "
621,18," As Operator Defendants note in their Reply Memorandum in Support of Their Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 146, the Plaintiffs do not 
even use the word ""boycott"" in their Second Amended Complaint. Id. at 9. I will, nevertheless, analyze whether Plaintiffs have 
adequately pled an unlawful group boycott for purposes of these Motions to Dismiss. See generally, F. R. Civ. P. 8(e) 
(""Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice"")."
621,19," In their Response to Drugtest, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 142, Plaintiffs claim that they have also sufficiently alleged a 
horizontal agreement among Operator Defendants which constitutes a per se unlawful group boycott. Id. at 14. That claim is 
analyzed in the context of my analysis of the group boycott claim, infra at pp. 23-27."
621,20," With respect to the other four Operator Defendants (CHS, Equilon, Tesoro, and Valero), there are no specific allegations 
whatsoever. "
622,21," Though Plaintiffs make passing reference to geographic sub-markets in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast regions, they do 
not offer any evidence in support of those markets."
622,22," Plaintiffs also allege ""[a]n additional relevant market exists for the services of a database holding the results of the drug and 
alcohol screenings""  [*30] -- essentially the DCC Database. Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint, Doc. 130, p. 14. Even if this 
was accepted as the relevant market, however, Defendant DISA ""does not violate the Sherman Act by virtue of the natural 
monopoly it holds over its own product."" TV Commc'ns Network, Inc., 964 F.2d at 1025. Though in Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image 
Technical Servs., Inc. the Supreme Court found that a single brand of a product or service can, in limited circumstances, 
constitute the relevant market, that finding was based on the fact that the service at issue was not interchangeable. 504 U.S. 
451, 481-82, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). As Plaintiffs have failed to address either the interchangeability or 
cross-elasticity of demand for a market defined as a DCC-type database, Eastman Kodak is inapposite. "
623,23," As is discussed infra, Plaintiffs' failure to plead the relevant product market adequately is also fatal, under a rule of reason 
analysis, to its group boycott claim, as well as to its § 2 claims."
623,24," As Defendant DISA notes in its Memorandum  [*33] of Law in Support of its Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Class Action 
Complaint, Doc. 105, Plaintiffs ""acknowledge there are other, unnamed companies in the 'Energy Industry' . . .."" Id. at 12. 
Further, Plaintiffs fail to suggest that ""DISA had exclusive agreements with any of the unnamed energy companies, including 
massive energy companies like ExxonMobil."" Id. Perhaps even more significant, in their Response to Drugtest Inc.'s Motion to 
Dismiss, Doc. 142, the Plaintiffs make no effort to demonstrate that they have pled any facts which could support a finding of 
substantial foreclosure. "
624,25," For more discussion of Plaintiffs' failure to plead the relevant market, see discussion supra at pp. 15-17."
624,26," In the context of a Sherman Act § 1 claim,  [*37] the term ""products"" includes services and is not limited to goods. See 
Eastman Kodak Co., 504 U.S. at 461-62 (1992). "
625,27," For more discussion of Plaintiffs' failure to plead the relevant market, see discussion supra at pp. 15-17. "
626,28," Nor do they, as discussed supra at pp. 13-19, constitute illegal exclusive dealing arrangements."
626,29," Though Plaintiffs make passing reference to agreements between and among DISA and Operator Defendants, they fail to 
discuss with any particularity any agreement among the Operator Defendants. Such conclusory assertions of agreements are 
ignored for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6). Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557."
626,30," Plaintiffs specifically cite correspondence from EnCana (requiring compliance  [*45] by March 2004), ConocoPhillips (requiring 
compliance by January 1, 2008), SEPCO (requiring compliance by August 4, 2008), Marathon (requiring compliance by 
September 29, 2008), and Apache (requiring compliance by May 1, 2009). Each of these letters was followed by 
correspondence from DISA reiterating the requirement to enroll in the DCC program. Plaintiffs also generally allege similar 
correspondence from the other Operator Defendants. "
627,31," See discussion supra, pp. 3-6."
627,32," Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint does not explicitly include a claim of conspiracy to monopolize. As with the group 
boycott claim, however, I undertake analysis of this claim in the interest of judicial efficiency and in an abundance of caution. "
628,33," This restriction is not absolute, as courts have applied § 2 protections in cases of monopsony. Campfield, 532 F.3d at 1118. 
As the 10th Circuit recognized in Campfield, ""A monopsony is different from the usual form of monopolistic control in which 
suppliers utilize market power to restrict output and thereby raise prices. In a monopsony, the  [*49] buyers have market power 
to decrease market demand for a product and thereby lower prices."" Id. at 1118 (emphasis added). In this case, however, 
Plaintiffs do not allege that the Operator Defendants have exercised their market power to reduce demand and lower prices. To 
the contrary, Plaintiffs allege that (1) Operator Defendants are not buyers and (2) as a result of Operator Defendants' conduct, 
prices have actually increased. As a result, Plaintiffs have alleged no grounds for finding Operator Defendants liable under § 2 
for monopsonistic behavior."
628,34," See supra pp. 15-17. The analysis under § 1 is directly applicable to my analysis under § 2. See Queen City Pizza Co., 124 
F.3d at 442 n.18 (""Monopoly power under § 2 requires something greater than the market power under § 1 . . . this does not 
imply, however, that the analyses employed in the two types of cases to define relevant markets differ""). "

638,1, ENH is now known as NorthShore University HealthSystem. 
639,2," In the FTC proceeding, ""private payers"" was limited to managed care organizations (""MCO"") that contracted with ENH during 
the relevant time period. A MCO is an organization that combines the functions of health insurance, delivery of care, and 
administration. "
640,3," ENH does not agree that plaintiffs have established commonality but states that ""whether Plaintiffs can establish commonality 
is not important because they cannot meet the higher standard of predominance."" Def.'s Resp. at 11 n.4. As defendant does not 
offer any argument disputing commonality, the court finds plaintiffs have satisfied their burden with respect to this requirement. 
See Vaughn v. King, 167 F.3d 347, 354 (7th Cir. 1999) (""It is not the responsibility of this court to make arguments  [**9] for the 
parties."") "
641,4, See infra at 30 for a discussion of the structure of a contract between a MCO and a self-insured entity. 
642,5," As discussed supra, the proof required to establish the named plaintiffs' claims will also serve to establish the claims of other 
class members. In other words, the proof required to establish that Messner was overcharged may not prove that another 
named plaintiff was overcharged, but it would prove that Unicare, the MCO through which he received healthcare coverage and 
a class member, was overcharged."
642,6," Defendant further argues that ""[t]he prices that [named] Plaintiffs paid to ENH depend on too many individualized facts to even 
determine if there was impact,"" including list prices of services, whether the service was covered by an individual's health plan, 
whether an individual carried coinsurance or was subject to a co-pay, an out-of-pocket maximum, or an annual deductible limit, 
or whether ENH improved quality of care for that service during the class period. Def.'s Resp. at 39. This is an argument 
pertaining to the requirement of predominance; the court will not consider it within the context of typicality. "
646,7," ENH also argues that ""[e]ven if the Court entertains such individualized evidence, the record will show that no MCO or self- or 
fully-insured entity has an actionable claim. Moreover, none of the Named Plaintiffs have a claim."" Def.'s Resp. at 31. This 
argument conflates the issue of whether common issues predominate the merits decision with the merits decision itself. See 
Loeb Indus., Inc., 306 F.3d at 480; Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d at 311-12. Accordingly, the court will not 
consider either party's arguments with respect to the merits of ENH's statute of limitations defense. "
647,8," In its response, ENH also argues that plaintiffs' proposed method for demonstrating impact does not satisfy the ""rigorous 
analysis"" requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). It argues that Dranove's report contained mere promises to perform an analysis. See 
Def.'s Resp. at 20-24. In his reply report, however, Dranove does perform his own analysis. In ENH's motion to strike Dranove's 
reply report or in the alternative, to file a sur-response, ENH requested that his new analysis be stricken, as it was presented for 
the first time on reply. The court denied the motion, but held oral arguments to allow ENH to respond to the new analysis. 
Accordingly, ENH's arguments regarding Dranove's failure to perform an analysis are moot. "
648,9," For example, DRG 135 represents ""Cardiac Congenital & Valvular Disorders Age > 17 [With complicating Condition];"" DRG 
136 represents ""Cardiac Congenital & Valvular Disorders Age > 17 [Without complicating Condition];"" and DRG 137 represents 
""Cardiac Congenital & Valvular Disorders Age 0-17."" Dranove Rep. at 29 n.73. "
649,10, Hospitals refer to their price lists as chargemasters.
649,11, There is no meaningful mathematical distinction between a decrease in discount and an increase in price. 
650,12," In many cases, uninsured individuals do not pay their hospital bills. These individuals are excluded from the class definition. 
Dranove believes that those who do pay (in full or approximately in full) can be ""readily identified by data that either are or are 
likely to be available."" Id. at 25."
650,13," To determine whether ENH increased list prices in its chargemaster at substantially  [**46] different rates for different services, 
Dranove indicated that he would need to perform ""a review of [ENH]'s strategic documents, contracts with insurers, and the 
chargemaster itself."" Id. at 35. At the time he authored his first expert report, he had not conducted any such analysis."
650,14," Dranove states that if a particular contract employed multiple per diem rates and ENH increased such rates by substantially 
different amounts, ""any such differential increase will be readily apparent in both the relevant contracts and in [ENH]'s billing 
data ([ENH]'s billing data records the payment and the length of stay, so the per diem rate can be recovered directly)."" Id. at 35-
36."
650,15," Dranove explains how dummy variables will correct for  [**47] variation in price increases: ""The applicable contract will likely 
identify the classes of services that should have a dummy variable. For example, if a contract specifies one per diem rate for 
maternity stays and another for general medical/surgical stays, then a dummy variable that equals one if the patient is a 
maternity patient will suffice to estimate any differential effect for these patients. The most likely basis upon which to define 
classes of service is the patient's [DRG]."" Id. at 36 n. 82. "
651,16," ""In this case, including a dummy variable that equals 1 for all classes of services that are reimbursed under a per diem rate will 
identify the differential overcharges under the two systems."" Id. at 36."
651,17," ""Incorporating a dummy variable into the DID analysis that equals 1 if list charges exceed the outlier threshold will estimate 
any differential overcharge for outlier patients."" Id. at 38. "
652,18," Noether's analysis  [**52] found that in a given year at ENH, most chargemaster prices did not change. For the prices that did 
increase, she found the pattern of increase to be highly varied. See Noether Rep. at 17-18. "
653,19," Noether also appears to argue that MCOs not acting as TPAs also might be no-impact members. She notes that ""it is likely 
that at least the majority of the medical cost increases that affect all MCOs are passed on to the MCO's [fully insured] 
customers."" Id. at 12. ""While  [**58] during the life of existing contracts with fully-insured customers, a MCO probably cannot 
pass on provider cost increases, when those contracts come up for renewal, it is likely to pass on most or all of any cost 
increases."" Id. at 21. "
654,20," She states that individuals with fixed co-pays could not have been harmed by ENH price increases. Plaintiffs concede this and 
have excluded such individuals from their class definition. See infra at 3."
654,21," She notes that there are over 18 MCOs that contract with ENH, that many MCOs have two or three different plans, and that 
there are over 500 DRGs applicable to admissions at ENH. "
655,22," She states that between 1998 and 2002, there were 101 DRGs in the data from Payor B. DID analysis indicated that average 
prices across all DRGs increased; however, for 47% of the DRGs, ENH prices post-merger increased less than control hospital 
prices. In 28% of all admissions, the price of the DRGs that corresponded to those admissions have a negative DID estimate 
(meaning that prices post-merger increased less than control hospital prices). Finally, 33% of all payments were made to 
compensate for admissions that correspond to DRGs with negative DID estimates. "
656,23," They specifically argue that Noether's report suffers from ""a number of fatal flaws:"" (1) it contains irrelevant and misleading 
analysis of the structure of MCO contracts; (2) its analysis of changes to  [**67] the ENH chargemaster is incomplete and 
inaccurate; (3) it ""erroneously claims numerous class members . . . were not injured without conducting any economic analysis;"" 
(4) it asserts, without support, that ENH never exercised market power; (5) it offers legal conclusions; and (6) it contains DID 
analysis that is ""fundamentally defective, thus invalidating her opinions."" Pls.' Mot. to Strike at 2."
656,24," Dranove also reviewed communications (letters, business documents) between ENH and the seven MCOs. From this review, 
he concluded that the norm was to speak of a single price increase "
657,25," Each of these 92 services experienced either a 10.6% or a 10.7% price increase. Dranove ""do[es] not view there being a 
material difference in rates of increase of 10.6% or 10.7%. This difference appears to be the result of rounding, because the 
contract specifies whole dollar amounts."" Id. at 11 n.46 "
659,26," Inpatient prices at a control hospital should respond to changes in market factors in ways similar to ENH. If changes in length 
of stay or case mix have a similar effect on pricing at ENH and a potential control hospital, this suggests that the process 
generating pricing at the two hospitals is similar. Dranove will use a F-test to statistically test whether a candidate's pricing and 
ENH's pricing respond in a similar manner. "
660,27," Dranove also points out that the majority of individuals who purchase secondary coverage are traditional Medicare patients, 
who are excluded from the class. Further, his analysis of ENH contracts  [**79] demonstrates that 1% of all non-government 
patients at ENH involve multiple commercial insurers."
660,28, Dranove's analysis of ENH contracts demonstrates that out-of-pocket maximums affect 2% of visits
660,29," Dranove states that economic theory ""suggests that if a self-funded group reached its stop-loss threshold in a given year, an 
event made more probable by an ENH price increase, the cost to that group of obtaining stop-loss insurance would increase."" Id. 
at 60. "
663,30," Noether excluded from her analysis services that were priced using discount-off or case rate pricing, classifying these services 
as having non-uniform price increases. See Noether Supp. Rep. at 9 (""[E]ven if the discount or base rate changes uniformly . . . 
the price . . . does not change uniformly because changes in DRG weights and charges are not uniform.""). She also excluded 
services that were subject to different pricing methodologies in the new and old contracts, classifying such services as having 
non-uniform price increases as well. See id. (""[I]t is completely reasonable to assume that these price changes are non-uniform, 
since it would be completely fortuitous if changing methodologies led to uniform increases across services.""). "
666,31," For example, Dranove's Appendix D ""excludes contracts that restructure payment categories from prior contracts."" Dranove 
Reply Rep. at 6. While the court understands his point with respect to restructuring, it is not convinced that every variable price 
increase was due to restructuring such that it should have been excluded from the analysis. Additionally, Noether's supplemental 
report classifies services that were subject to (1) case rate pricing, (2) discount-off pricing, and (3) different pricing 
methodologies across contracts as being subject to non-uniform price increases because they are not capable of comparison. 
See Noether Supp. Rep. at 9. The court is not convinced that no reliable comparison can be drawn between these services such 
that an automatic classification as being subject to non-uniform price increases is warranted. "
667,32," Because plaintiffs have not shown that ENH increased prices at a uniform rate across services, the court need not consider 
the parties' arguments with respect to the two remaining issues. Furthermore, because plaintiffs fail to establish predominance, 
the court need not undertake an analysis of whether they have satisfied superiority, the second requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). "
678,1," Defendants also argue that Great Lakes must be dismissed because Plaintiffs fail to allege any facts concerning it. The Court 
need not address this argument as all claims are to be dismissed on other grounds."
678,2," HN6[
] A ""seller"" is a ""person who, in the ordinary course of business, sells or leases goods or services to consumers,"" 16 C.F.R. § 433.1(j), and a ""consumer credit contract"" is any ""instrument which evidences or embodies a debt arising from a 
'Purchase Money Loan' transaction or a 'financed sale' as defined in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section,"" id. § 433.1(i). A 
""purchase money loan"" is a ""cash advance which is received by a consumer in return for a 'Finance Charge' within the meaning 
of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, which is applied, in whole or substantial part, to a purchase of goods or services 
from a seller who (1) refers consumers to the creditor or (2) is affiliated with the creditor by common control, contract, or 
business arrangement."" Id. § 433.1(d). ""Financing a sale"" means ""[e]xtending credit to a consumer in connection with a 'Credit 
Sale' within the meaning of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z."" Id. § 433.1(e)."
678,3," The bracketed language -- ""pursuant hereto or"" -- appears only in the Holder Notice required by 16 C.F.R. § 433.2(a), but not in 
§ 433.2(b). Aside from that difference, the language required by  [**11] subsections (a) and (b) is identical."
678,4," On the same day the Holder Rule was officially promulgated, the FTC also proposed an amendment that would have applied 
the rule to lenders, as well. See Heastie v. Cmty. Bank of Greater Peoria, 727 F. Supp. 1133, 1137 (N.D. Ill. 1989) (reviewing 
history of amendment). However, the proposed amendment was never adopted. "
681,5," Defendants argued for the first time at hearing that Silver State's service contracts are not consumer credit contracts. At the 
motion to dismiss stage, the Court finds Plaintiffs' allegation that the service contracts constitute consumer credit contracts to be 
sufficient without examining the contract to determine whether it ""evidences or embodies a debt."" 16 C.F.R. § 433.1(j). 
Defendants also asserted -- for the first time -- that KeyBank's promissory notes are not consumer credit contracts, because 
education loans above $ 25,000 were exempt from the Truth in Lending Act (""TILA"") and Regulation Z at the time Plaintiffs' loans 
were made. See 15 U.S.C. § 1603(3). The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the Holder Rule merely borrows the definitions of 
""finance charge""  [**20] and ""credit sale"" from TILA and Regulation Z; it does not import the restrictions to which Defendants 
refer. See note 2, supra (quoting provisions of OCC regulations). "
685,6," HN20[
] ""Federal regulations have no less pre-emptive effect than federal statutes."" Fid. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. de la Cuesta, 458 U.S. 141, 153, 102 S. Ct. 3014, 73 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1982). That preemptive effect may only be disturbed if the 
regulation ""is not one that Congress would have sanctioned."" Id. at 154. Neither party disputes the force of the OCC regulations 
here. "
686,7," Plaintiffs also contend that the Supreme Court's decision in Cuomo v. Clearing House Ass'n,     U.S.    , 129 S. Ct. 2710, 174 L. 
Ed. 2d 464 (2009), is supportive. However, the Court in Cuomo addressed an unrelated provision of the National Bank Act, 
which provides that ""[n]o national bank shall be subject to any visitorial powers except as authorized by Federal law"" and other 
limited circumstances. 12 U.S.C. § 484(A).  [**41] The Court found only that the OCC erred in ""extending the definition of 
'visitorial powers' to include 'prosecuting enforcement actions' in state courts."" 129 S. Ct. at 2721 (quoting 12 C.F.R. § 7.4000). 
The term properly refers, the Court held, ""to a sovereign's supervisory powers over corporations,"" including ""any form of 
administrative oversight that allows a sovereign to inspect books and records."" Id. Since a state's visitorial powers are not at 
issue here, this Court does not see how Cuomo is controlling or even relevant. "
694,1," The facts from the amended complaint are taken as true. Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't, 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1990). 
Despite this well-settled rule, CCNG injects multiple ""facts"" outside of the amended complaint in its statement of facts and 
argument. The Court shall not consider facts outside of the complaint for this motion."
694,2," SMG is a professional medical corporation of approximately 70 specialty physicians who practice medicine in the area. SMG 
and Children's have a contractual relationship in which SMG provides physician services and  [*5] Children's provides facilities 
and patient support services. "
695,3," The Court takes judicial notice of the first amended complaint filed in the state court action and submitted as an exhibit to 
CCNG's motion. "
696,4," SMG and Children's filed answers to Plaintiffs' amended complaint on March 12, 2010 and March 25, 2010 respectively. "
697,5," Additionally, CCNG argues that because Plaintiffs' Section 2 claim alleges a conspiracy rather than a unilateral action, the 
Section 2 claim necessarily fails. This Court previously rejected this argument in its Order on Children's Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 
19), explaining that although the Sherman Act contains a ""basic distinction between concerted and independent action,"" 
Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984), HN7[
] Section 2 prohibits a single entity from combining or conspiring with other entities. ""By making a conspiracy to monopolize unlawful, § 2 
does reach both concerted and unilateral behavior."" Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 768 n. 13. Accordingly, CCNG's argument is 
incorrect. "
699,6," HN15[
] A competitor's right to refuse to deal with a competitor is not without limits. ""The high value that [the Supreme Court 
has] placed on the right to refuse to deal  [*23] with other firms does not mean that the right is unqualified."" Aspen Skiing Co. v. 
Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 601, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467, 105 S. Ct. 2847 (1985). Aspen Skiing, the exception to this 
century-old rule, ""is at or near the outer boundary"" of Sherman Act liability. Trinko, 540 U.S. at 409. "
700,7," HN17[
] Antitrust law requires a court to consider the specific industry and regulatory framework, if any, to consider whether a party's actions harm competition. Trinko, 540 U.S. at 412-13. Thus, the Tenth Circuit's direct application of business cases to a 
health care industry dispute is questionable without further analysis: The fact that a restraint operates upon a profession as distinguished from a business is, of course, relevant  [*25] in 
determining whether that particular restraint violates the Sherman Act. It would be unrealistic to view the practice of 
professions as interchangeable with other business activities, and automatically to apply to the professions antitrust 
concepts which originated in other areas. Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 788 n.17, 95 S. Ct. 2004, 44 L. Ed. 2d 572, reh'g denied, 423 U.S. 886, 96 S. Ct. 
162, 46 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1975). "
703,1," Cottage Emporium, Inc. t/a Rainbow Liquors, and its shareholders Gopal Panday and Kavita Panday, have resolved their 
dispute with the City and have submitted a stipulation that dismisses their claims in A-0048-07T2. The claims of the remaining appellants are unaffected by this stipulation of dismissal."
703,2," Cottage Emporium, Inc., Gopal Panday and Kavita Panday have dismissed their claims in A-4416-07T2 and consent to a 
remand for trial as to valuation of their property. "
704,3," At appellate oral argument, appellants abandoned their additional claim that the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, 
N.J.S.A. 40A:12A-1 to -49 (the LRHL), upon which the City had relied, is unconstitutional, as the Court had, in the interim, held 
to the contrary. "
706,4," Although there were 134 commercial buildings and 154 residential structures, which totals 289, due to common ownership and 
garden apartments, the actual number of parcels  [*9] was only 237. "
709,5," There were no counts eight, eleven, or twelve."
709,6," The Brower litigation involved a residential section of the City which, like the Broadway Corridor, was part of the area the City 
deemed blighted and in need of redevelopment in 1996. We reversed the Law Division's June 12, 2006 order sub nom City of 
Long Branch v. Anzalone, Nos. A-0067-06, A-0191-06, A-0192-06, A-0195-06, A-0196-06, A-0197-06, A-0198-06 and A-0654-
06, 2008 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2204 (App. Div. August 7, 2008), certif. denied, 199 N.J. 134, 970 A.2d 1050 (2009)."
709,7," As we have noted, Cottage Emporium and the Pandays subsequently submitted a stipulation  [*23] of dismissal. "
710,8," As we have noted, the City's findings were made in 1996 and 2002, which led the Law Division to consider appellants' 
challenges time-barred. On appeal, the City concedes that appellants' challenges were timely under DeRose, supra, 398 N.J. 
Super. at 413, which had not yet been decided when the judge rendered his decision. "
712,9," The sponsor's statement, which was delivered without challenge or criticism, included the following: Certain sections of [the older cities in the State] have fallen in value, and have [become] what [are] known as ""blighted"" or 
""depressed"" areas. . . . These depressed areas go steadily down hill. . . . It's impossible to keep the properties in good condition, the houses 
deteriorate more and more, and what was once a good section of the town is on the way to becoming a slum. Naturally, this slump in value is not confined to the original area affected. It spreads to neighboring blocks. No one person . 
. . can counteract this spread, because no one can afford to sink money into a blighted  [*32] area . . . because the 
improvement is so small that it cannot turn the tide of deterioration. [Id. at 360-61 (quoting Proceedings, supra, vol. I at 742-43) (fourth and fifth alterations added).] "
722,1," 49 U.S.C. § 10709(c)(1) (2006) (HN1[
] ""A contract that is authorized by this section, and transportation under such contract, 
shall not be subject to this part, and may not be subsequently challenged before the Board or in any court on the grounds that 
such contract violates a provision of this part.""). Shippers not wishing to enter into contracts can ship pursuant to common carrier 
rates that railroads must provide on request pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 11101(b) (2006). HN2[
] The Board has authority to regulate the rates of common carrier traffic if the railroad has ""market dominance"" with respect to such traffic, id. §§ 10701(d), 
10702(1), 10707, and to regulate the reasonableness of the railroad's ""rules and practices"" regardless of market dominance, id. 
§ 10702(2). The Board can also ""exempt"" ""a person, class of persons, or a transaction  [***3] or service"" when it finds that 
application of the regulatory regime ""(1) is not necessary to carry out the transportation policy of [49 U.S.C. § 10101]; and (2) 
either--(A) the transaction or service is of limited scope; or (B) the application in whole or in part of the provision is not needed to 
protect shippers from the abuse of market power."" Id. § 10502(a). Plaintiffs originally sought to challenge both § 10709 contract 
freight and § 10502(a) exempt freight, but they abandoned their claims involving § 10502(a) exempt freight in briefing before the 
district court and on appeal."
722,2," There are also two sections not codified at the citation above, namely, 11 U.S.C. § 1162 and 45 U.S.C. § 7971. "
724,3," A quite  [***11] separate way in which Board authority may be curtailed is through the Board's exercise of its authority under 49 
U.S.C. § 10502(a) to ""exempt a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service"" on the making of certain findings. "
727,4," This Report is addressed to the original Senate proposal, which explicitly stated the point made in the report with language 
omitted from the ultimate version, but that in other respects did not go as far as the ultimate version in curtailing state regulatory 
authority. Compare S. Rep. No. 96-470, at 77-78 (1979) (Senate proposing that the statute contain a subsection making clear 
that ""[f]ederal withdrawal from certain areas of regulation shall not be construed as relinquishing Federal jurisdiction""), with H.R. 
Rep. No. 96-1430, at 106, as reprinted in 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4138 (discussing House proposals, all adopted in the final 
version, that ""only State authorities whose standards and procedures have been certified by the  [***24] Commission may 
exercise jurisdiction over intrastate rail,"" that ""[d]ecisions of State authorities may be appealed to the Commission,"" and that 
""where the Interstate Commerce Act provides an exclusive remedy, such remedy is not in addition to remedies under another 
law or at common law"")."
727,5," Although the House Report is addressing a bill that lacks  [***25] the phrase ""with respect to rail transportation,"" there is no 
reason to suppose that inclusion of that phrase in the final bill reflected a congressional embrace of balkanization. "
731,1," By order filed March 11, 2010, the Court took the matter under submission. Plaintiffs' Motion to Request Oral Argument, filed 
March 15, 2010, is hereby DENIED for the reasons stated in defendants' opposition thereto, specifically, that all parties have had 
an adequate opportunity to submit their respective arguments in writing.  [*3] See, e.g., Partridge v. Reich, 141 F.3d 920, 926 
(9th Cir. 1988) (holding, in context of motion for summary judgment, ""a district court can decide the issue without oral argument if 
the parties can submit their papers to the court""). "
732,2," Plaintiffs allege that the ""anticompetitive effects"" of the merger will be felt ""in the United States."" (See SAC P 127.) Defendants 
have not argued that plaintiffs' allegation of a nationwide market is insufficient to allege a geographic market. "
734,3," In their First Amended Complaint (""FAC""), plaintiffs alleged that separate product markets exist for the manufacture and sale of 
drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, renal-cell carcinoma, and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections (see FAC PP 
17(f), 17(h)-(i), 27-28), for the research and development of new drugs to treat osteoporosis and to treat Alzheimer's disease 
(see FAC PP 17(e), 17(g), 29-30), for brand name antidepressants, anti-bacterials, and anti-neoplastics (see FAC PP 17(j)-(l), 
24-26), and for the manufacture and sale of drugs to treat specified animal diseases or conditions, such as ""canine monovalent 
vaccines for the prevention and treatment of disease caused by parvovirus"" and ""equine tapeworm parasiticides containing 
praziquantel"" (see  [*14] FAC PP 21(m), 31, Ex. A P 7). Plaintiffs, however, did not include such allegations in the SAC, and, 
consequently, the Court does not consider whether such alleged product markets would be cognizable."
734,4," Plaintiffs attribute the descriptions of such products, e.g., ""other primary,"" ""capsugel,"" and ""nutritional,"" to Pfizer. (See SAC PP 
39, 43, 47.) Plaintiffs do not allege the circumstances under which, or the context in which, such descriptions were used."
734,5," The other two Supreme Court cases on which plaintiffs rely contain no discussion with respect to the product markets identified 
therein. See United States v. Pabst Brewing Co., 384 U.S. 546, 548, 86 S. Ct. 1665, 16 L. Ed. 2d 765 (1966) (noting plaintiff had 
alleged merger at issue would have anticompetitive effect in market for ""the production and sale of beer,"" and deciding whether 
plaintiff had established geographic market); United States v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270, 271, 278, 86 S. Ct. 1478, 16 L. "
735,," Ed. 2d 555 (1966) (deciding, where market identified as ""retail grocery market in the Los Angeles area,"" whether evidence 
demonstrated ""competition would [] be destroyed"" if merger not enjoined). "
743,*," Honorable Paul S. Diamond, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation. "
744,1, These cases were brought as putative class actions but have never been certified as such. 
745,2," The District Court also granted the motions of several of the Dealers in Jersey Dental to dismiss the amended complaint for 
lack of personal jurisdiction and improper venue. That portion of the District Court's ruling is not at issue here. "
747,3," HN9[
] Because the applicability vel non of collateral estoppel is a  [**14] question of law, we ordinarily exercise plenary 
review over a district court's collateral estoppel analysis. See Cospito v. Attorney Gen. of the United States, 539 F.3d 166, 171 
(3d Cir. 2008) (per curiam); Delaware River Port Auth. v. Fraternal Order of Police, 290 F.3d 567, 572 (3d Cir. 2002). However, 
where, as here, a plaintiff seeks to collaterally estop a defendant from relitigating an issue from previous litigation in which the 
defendant was a party but the plaintiff was not, our review is limited to deciding whether the district court abused its discretion. 
See Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 458 F.3d 244, 248 (3d Cir. 2006); Smith v. Holtz, 210 F.3d 186, 199 
n.18 (3d Cir. 2000); Raytech Corp. v. White, 54 F.3d 187, 190 (3d Cir. 1995). "
750,4," Neither party contests the District Court's interpretation of the Plaintiffs' motion as one for reconsideration, and thus we accept 
that interpretation as correct. "
751,5," In their briefs, the Plaintiffs do not impugn the District Court's  [**32] dismissal of their claims for injunctive relief against 
Dentsply as asserted in Counts Three and Five to the extent the Court found that the Plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue those 
claims given their failure to allege facts demonstrating antitrust injury. As such, the Plaintiffs have waived any contest to that 
portion of the District Court's ruling. See Holk v. Snapple Beverage Corp., 575 F.3d 329, 337 n.5 (3d Cir. 2009)."
751,6," The defendants argue that the Plaintiffs should be judicially estopped from claiming, as they do in their amended complaint, 
that the Dealers were Dentsply's equals in the alleged conspiracy because of the Plaintiffs' previous allegations in these 
proceedings that Dentsply coerced the Dealers into participating in its anticompetitive practices. The doctrine of judicial estoppel 
""bar[s] a party from taking contradictory positions during the course of litigation."" G-I Holdings, Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 586 F.3d 
247, 261 (3d Cir. 2009) (citations omitted). One of the threshold requirements for judicial estoppel is a finding of bad faith on the 
part of the party against whom the doctrine is invoked. Chao v. Roy's Constr., Inc., 517 F.3d 180, 186 n.5 (3d Cir. 2008). 
 [**33] The applicability vel non of judicial estoppel is fact-specific. McNemar v. Disney Store, Inc., 91 F.3d 610, 613 (3d Cir. 
1996). Here, although Dentsply invoked the doctrine before the District Court, the District Court made no mention of it, and we 
ordinarily do not consider issues not addressed by the district court in the first instance. See, e.g., In re Montgomery Ward & Co., 
428 F.3d 154, 166 (3d Cir. 2005). We see no reason to depart from that rule here, as we cannot decide, based on this record 
and with no findings by the District Court, whether the Plaintiffs have exhibited bad faith. Cf. Reliance Ins., 428 F.3d at 166 & 
n.25. "
752,7," The  [**35] standard for a Section 2 violation is ""the more stringent monopoly standard[,]"" Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image 
Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 481, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992), but only insofar as the practices 
constituting the alleged violation are concerned, not the existence of an agreement. "
753,8," The Plaintiffs rely on Fineman v. Armstrong World Industries, Inc., 980 F.2d 171 (3d Cir. 1992), where the district court directed 
a verdict for the defendant on a Section 1 conspiracy claim, finding insufficient evidence that the defendant distributors shared 
the defendant manufacturer's purpose of eliminating the plaintiff's  [**40] business and rejecting Fineman's argument that 
""[S]ection 1 co-conspirators are held liable for their joint commitment to an unlawful purpose whether or not their motives for 
making that commitment are different."" Id. at 212. We disagreed with the district court's ""novel approach[,]"" id., and held that 
""although vertically aligned co-conspirators must share a commitment to a common scheme which has an anticompetitive 
objective, they need not share an identical motive for engaging in concerted action in violation of [S]ection 1 of the Sherman 
Act[,]"" id. at 215. In addition to the fact that Fineman reached us in an entirely different procedural posture, nothing in that case 
excuses the Plaintiffs from alleging an agreement between Dentsply and the Dealers. At most, Fineman could provide a defense 
for the Plaintiffs if Dentsply argued that no agreement could exist because its motives were unaligned with the Dealers'. "
754,9," The Plaintiffs argue that the District Court erroneously applied a heightened pleading standard by requiring them to allege not 
only that the Dealers knew that Dentsply would achieve a monopolistic position but, additionally, that they ""wanted"" Dentsply to 
obtain a monopoly, thereby ""confus[ing] motive with intent."" (Appellants' Br. 81-83.) We agree that no authority of which we are 
aware mandates the conclusion that a defendant's intent to violate the antitrust laws is negated if the defendant was coerced 
into committing a violation. It is well settled that at the summary judgment stage a court may dispose of an antitrust conspiracy 
claim in ""the absence of any plausible motive to engage in the conduct charged[.]"" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio 
Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 596, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986). We recognize that some courts have made motive-type 
determinations  [**45] in antitrust cases at the pleading stage. See, e.g., TV Commc'ns Network, Inc. v. Turner Network 
Television, Inc., 964 F.2d 1022, 1026-27 (10th Cir. 1992). Other courts, how ever, have disavowed that approach. See, e.g., 
Jung v. Ass'n of Am. Med. Colleges, 300 F. Supp. 2d 119, 159 (D.D.C. 2004). We need not decide here which line of cases has 
it right."
754,10," As the Plaintiffs correctly note, the agreement element of their conspiracy claims arguably is not negated by their allegation 
that the Dealers may have been coerced into submitting to Dentsply's pricing policies. See Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. Int'l Parts 
Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 142, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968); Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 150, 88 S. Ct. 869, 19 "
755,," L. Ed. 2d 998 & n.6 (1968). But that argument does not relieve the Plaintiffs of their obligation to state ""sufficient factual matter . . 
. [that] 'state[s] a claim to relief that is plausible on its face'"" as to the specific intent element of their Section 2 claims. Iqbal, 129 
S. Ct. at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). "
756,11," The Plaintiffs contend that the defendants cannot complain that they were caught unawares by their request for lost profits 
damages. That may be so, but HN32[
] the doctrine of waiver does not serve as a surprise-avoidance mechanism alone. It 
ensures that a particular issue is given a full airing, permitting each party to present its views and the trial court to make an initial 
determination. Most important for our purposes, the doctrine allows us to review both those views and that determination in 
arriving at our own considered judgment. "
779,1," The SAC alleged that for a two-night stay in 2000, Sharp charged Durell $ 8,017.33, which had ballooned to $ 13,995.33 with 
interest and collection charges; in 2001 Sharp charged him $ 689.15, which had grown to $ 1,141.33; in 2003 Sharp charged 
him $ 876.35, which had grown to $ 1,261.17; in 2004 Sharp charged him $ 1,522.60, which had grown to $ 2,207.10; and in 
2005 Sharp charged him $ 1,992.05, which had grown to $ 2,583.19. These amounts total $21,188.12. The SAC alleged a total 
amount of $21,088.12. We use the larger figure."
779,2," The SAC added two new plaintiffs, Jon Bigness and Rami Saltagi, as proposed representatives for the class. They do not 
appeal the judgment, however, and thus it is binding on them. (Code Civ. Proc., § 906; In re Marriage of Weiss (1996) 42 
Cal.App.4th 106, 119 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 339].) Accordingly, complaint allegations pertaining to them are irrelevant. Further, 
 [***5] the SAC added a cause of action for violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Civ. Code, § 51), but Durell does not 
challenge the judgment as to that claim. "
780,3," In support of his contentions on appeal, Durell cites lower court cases from California and other states that have no 
precedential value. We do not consider them. Further, we do not consider Sharp’s lengthy argument its conduct was legal under 
applicable statutes and regulations, and that courts should not become embroiled in the highly regulated field of hospital billing 
practices. Sharp does not argue these laws preclude Durell’s action as a matter of law, and rather it admits they are not relevant 
to the demurrer analysis. We note that nationwide, purported class actions are being brought against hospitals under a variety of federal and state law 
theories pertaining to disparate billing practices. It appears that such suits have largely been unsuccessful. (See Burton v. 
William Beaumont Hospital (E.D.Mich. 2005) 373 F.Supp.2d 707, 712 [discussing dozens of similar federal lawsuits and 
concluding plaintiffs  [***8] misguidedly came to the judicial branch for relief that only the legislative branch can grant]; Bobo v. 
Christus Health (E.D.Tex. 2005) 227 F.R.D. 479, 480 [discussing what court refers to as “latest epidemic” in class action suits].) 
In Sutter Health Uninsured Pricing Cases (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 495, 499 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 615], the health care provider agreed 
in a proposed settlement to “end[] price discrimination against the uninsured.” In affirming the settlement, the court explained the 
issue of whether the provider “had a duty not to give discounts to insured patients, or, if given, a duty to give the same discounts 
to uninsured patients,” was “hotly contested.” (Id. at p. 511.) "
782,4," “Proposition 64 also amended Business and Professions Code section 17203, which authorizes courts to enjoin unfair 
competition, by adding this sentence: ‘Any person may pursue representative claims or relief on behalf of others only if the 
claimant meets the standing requirements  [***13] of Section 17204 and complies with Section 382 of the Code of Civil 
Procedure, but these limitations do not apply to claims brought under this chapter by the Attorney General, or any district 
attorney, county counsel, city attorney, or city prosecutor in this state.’ ” (Hall v. Time Inc., supra, 158 Cal.App.4th at p. 852.)"
782,5," The SAC also alleges as predicates for the UCL claim of unlawfulness, Business and Professions Code section 17500, which 
pertains to false or misleading advertising, and California’s Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Civ. Code, § 1788 et 
seq.). On appeal, however, Durell has abandoned any issues related to those statutes by not developing any specific argument 
pertaining to how the SAC supposedly alleges a UCL claim for unlawfulness based on them. (See Buller v. Sutter Health (2008) 
160 Cal.App.4th 981, 984 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 47].) "
783,6," The court expounded: “ ‘[R]eliance is proved by showing that the defendant’s misrepresentation or nondisclosure was “an 
immediate cause” of the plaintiff’s injury-producing conduct. [Citation.] A plaintiff may establish that the defendant’s 
misrepresentation is an “immediate cause” of the plaintiff’s conduct by showing that in its absence the plaintiff “in all reasonable 
probability” would not have engaged in the injury-producing conduct.’ ” (Tobacco II, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 326.) "
784,7," Tobacco II was filed on May 18, 2009. Durell filed his opening brief in this matter on July 30, 2009. We asked the parties to be 
ready to address Tobacco II at oral argument, and the opinion was then discussed. "
785,8," In a third approach, some courts have adopted the following test of the term “unfair” in consumer UCL actions based on section 
5 (15 U.S.C. § 45(a)) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq.): “(1) [t]he consumer injury must be 
substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it must be 
an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided.” (Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California 
(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1403 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 770]; accord, Davis v. Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC, supra, 179 Cal.App.4th 
581, 595, 596, disagreeing with its earlier post-Cel-Tech opinion that applied a test the Supreme Court criticized in Cel-Tech.) "
786,9," Given our holdings on the UCL issues, we are not required to address Durell’s argument the SAC sufficiently pleads “injury in 
fact” within the meaning of Business and Professions Code section 17204. (See, however, our discussion of “injury in fact” as 
including the incurrence of unreasonable hospital bills in our related opinion in Hale v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 
1373 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 669], also filed this date.) In Hale,  [***28] we conclude the plaintiff’s second amended complaint 
adequately pleaded actual reliance for purposes of the UCL and CLRA. (183 Cal.App.4th at p. 1386–1387.) "
787,10," Although on demurrer the court ordinarily looks only at the complaint  [***32] and matters judicially noticed, “[w]hen a party 
opposing a demurrer admits that it does not dispute facts extrinsic to the complaint, the trial court may properly treat these facts 
as judicial admissions for the purpose of testing the sufficiency of the complaint.” (Buckland v. Threshold Enterprises, Ltd., 
supra, 155 Cal.App.4th 798, 806.)"
787,11," Durell essentially concedes that since he has paid Sharp so little he has no breach of contract damages. He claims he is 
entitled to nominal damages for breach of contract. (See Sweet v. Johnson (1959) 169 Cal.App.2d 630, 632 [337 P.2d 499].) "

[DVDFLLC License Agreement Arts. 1.10, 1.17, 2.1]. As EcoDisc points out in the FSC, Blue-ray discs and DVD+RW discs are 
not considered DVD Products because they  [**7] require unique playback systems, different from those of standard DVDs, and 
the DVDFLLC License Agreement does not prohibit licensees from manufacturing discs in those alternative formats. It is a

804,5," The Ninth Circuit explained, ""preceding the formal filing of litigation with an invitation to engage in negotiations to settle legal 
claims is a common, if not universal, feature of modern litigation. . . . Restricting such prelitigation conduct when the same 
demands asserted in a petition to the court is protected would render the entire litigation process more onerous, imposing a 
substantial burden  [**19] on a party's ability to seek redress from the courts."" Sosa, 437 F.3d at 936. "
807,6," Rule 4(k)(2) applies in rare situations. In fact, three years ago, the Ninth Circuit remarked that none of its cases thus far had 
countenanced jurisdiction under the rule. Holland Am. Line v. Wartsila N. Am., Inc., 485 F.3d 450, 462 (9th Cir. 2007). The 
Circuits that  [**33] have concluded Rule 4(k)(2) conferred jurisdiction did so in cases where the defendants had extensive "
808,," contacts to the country. See id.; e.g., Mwani v. bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1, 13, 368 U.S. App. D.C. 1 (D.C. Cir. 2005)(defendants 
engaged in numerous conspiracies to bomb U.S. landmarks); Adams v. Unione Mediterranea Di Sicurta, 364 F.3d 646, 651 (5th 
Cir. 2004)(defendant directly insured hundreds of claims in the U.S.)."
808,7," Plaintiff's opposition brief declares that jurisdiction is proper under Rule 4(k)(2) and presents its argument within that 
framework. At oral argument, counsel again urged the Court to apply Rule 4(k)(2). "
811,8," Later, HN29[
] the Ninth Circuit clarified that the ""brunt"" of the harm need not be suffered in the forum state. Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme Et L'Antisemitisme, 433 F.3d 1199, 1207 (9th Cir. 2006)(en  [**45] banc). ""If a jurisdictionally sufficient 
amount of harm is suffered in the forum state, it does not matter that even more harm might have been suffered in another 
state."" Id. "
812,9," The distinction between Schwarzenegger and cases in which courts have found express aiming at a forum by virtue of plaintiff's 
known residency may lie in the nature of the intentional act. In Calder v. Jones, where the plaintiff claimed she was libeled, and 
Panavision Int'l, L.P. v. Toeppen, where the plaintiff was a competitor, the plaintiffs were the target of the intentional act and thus 
the  [**47] acts were expressly aimed at the plaintiffs and the states in which the defendant knew the plaintiffs resided. Calder v. 
Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 104 S. Ct. 1482, 79 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1984); Panavision Int'l, L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir. 1998). 
In Schwarzenegger, the effect on the plaintiff was incidental; he was not the target of the conduct. 374 F.3d at 807. Likewise, in 
Pebble Beach, the Ninth Circuit found the defendant did not expressly aim its conduct at California or the United States, despite 
his knowledge that plaintiff resided there, because the only acts identified as being directed at California or the United States 
were the maintenance of a website that could be accessed worldwide and the use of the name ""Pebble Beach"" in the domain 
name. 453 F.3d at 1156. The passive website did not target a particular audience, and it did not target the plaintiff because the 
two were not competitors; the ""something more"" was missing."

831,1," Plaintiff's reliance on the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of Blue Shield in Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., 740 F.2d 739, 745 (9th Cir. 
1984) is misplaced. In Ostrofe, the court found that the plaintiff, a former employee in the paper lithograph label industry who 
alleged that he had been discharged and boycotted because of his refusal to participate in bid rigging scheme, had standing 
because his discharge furthered the anticompetitive scheme in the labels market even though he was not a consumer or a 
competitor in the market. Ostrofe stated: As sales manager of one of the label manufacturers, Ostrofe was an essential  [**46] participant in the scheme to eliminate 
competition in the marketing of labels by fixing prices and allocating customers. It could not succeed without his active 
cooperation. When Ostrofe sold labels to customers not allocated to his employer and at prices below those agreed upon, 
his discharge was a necessary means to achieve the conspirators' illegal end as well as an integral and inextricable part of 
the anticompetitive scheme. Ostrofe, 740 F.2d at 746. Ostrofe, however, is limited to cases in which a dismissed employee is an essential participant in the 
antitrust scheme and the dismissal is the necessary means to accomplish the anticompetitive scheme. See Vinci v. Waste 
Management, Inc., 80 F.3d 1372, 1376 (9th Cir. 1996) (""The exception recognized in Ostrofe II is limited to those cases in which 
a dismissed employee is an 'essential participant' in an antitrust scheme, the dismissal is a 'necessary means' to accomplish the 
scheme, and the employee has the greatest incentive to challenge the antitrust violation.""). Those circumstances are not present 
here. "

858,8," As an initial matter, the Plaintiffs go to great lengths to distinguish their TTPA claims from the ratable taking requirements at 
issue in Northern Natural and Transcon. As we have discussed, however, Northern Natural and Transcon do not define the outer 
bounds of natural gas field pre-emption. The securities regulation struck down in Schneidewind was significantly more 
attenuated from the core concerns of the NGA than the ratable taking requirements, and the Supreme Court still found pre-
emption. Whether the TTPA claims can be distinguished from a ratable taking requirement is, therefore, not determinative."
858,9," To the contrary, however, it is highly questionable that complementarity can ever be a defense against field pre-emption. See 
Locke, 529 U.S. at 115 (HN20[
] ""When Congress has taken the particular subject matter in hand coincidence is as ineffective 
as opposition, and a state law is not to be declared a help because it attempts to go farther  [**64] than Congress has seen fit to

(1915)); Rice, 331 U.S. at 236 (""[I]f a licensed warehouseman complied with each requirement [of the federal statute that pre-
empted the relevant field], he did all that he need do. He could not be required by a State to do more or additional things or 
conform to added regulations, even though they in no way conflicted with what was demanded of him under the Federal Act.""). It 
is true that, in Transcon and Northern Natural, the Supreme Court considered the degree to which ratable taking requirements 
would conflict with the goals of the federal price regulations found in the NGA and NGPA. See Transcon, 474 U.S. at 420 (""[I]n 
the absence of ratable-take requirements, purchasers would choose a different, and presumably less costly, purchasing 
pattern.""); Northern Natural, 372 U.S. at 92 (""Moreover, any readjustment of purchasing patterns which such orders might "
859,," require of purchasers who previously took unratably could seriously impair the Federal Commission's authority to regulate the 
intricate relationship between the purchasers' cost structures and eventual costs  [**65] to wholesale customers who sell to 
consumers in other States.""). However, the core concern in both cases was the comprehensive nature of the federal policy. See 
Transcon, 474 U.S. at 422 (""The proper question in this case is . . . whether Congress, in revising a comprehensive federal 
regulatory scheme to give market forces a more significant role in determining the supply, the demand, and the price of natural 
gas, intended to give the States the power it had denied FERC.""); Northern Natural, 372 U.S. at 91 (""The federal regulatory 
scheme leaves no room either for direct state regulation of the prices of interstate wholesales of natural gas, or for state 
regulations which would indirectly achieve the same result."" (citation omitted)). Because, however, the Supreme Court discussed 
possible conflicts between the state and federal laws in those cases, we will proceed as if such conflicts are at least relevant to 
the pre-emption analysis. "
861,10," Because we decide this case on the question of field pre-emption, we have not considered the parties' filed rate doctrine 
arguments. We also decline to reconsider Tennessee's pleading standards, as some of the Defendants have urged. "
869,1," USA Swimming and Schubert also argue that TYR did not plead a Section 1 false advertising or disparagement claim against 
them. This is incorrect. (See Compl. ¶ 13 (""USA SWIMMING, SPEEDO and SCHUBERT have also combined to engage in a 
campaign of falsely disparaging the products of SPEEDO'S competitors, including TYR . . . ."").) USA Swimming and Schubert also appear to contend that TYR should be estopped from asserting a disparagement-based claim 
against them under Section 1 because in TYR's opposition to a motion to dismiss, it stated that Harcourt Brace ""is irrelevant to 
the standards for pleading a Section 1 claim."" (Docket No. 49 at 13.) However, TYR appears to have been arguing that the 
limitations set forth in Harcourt Brace do not apply to a Section 1 claim, not that the Section 1 claim was not based on 
disparagement. Because this argument is not inconsistent with its current argument, TYR is not estopped from asserting a 
disparagement-based theory against USA Swimming and Schubert. See Hamilton v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 270 F.3d 778, 
782 (9th Cir. 2001). "
870,2," HN6[
] Though the parties do not explicitly address the issue and assume that Lanham Act cases are applicable to a false 
advertising-based antitrust claim, the Court finds that an antitrust plaintiff must demonstrate that the false statement was made in 
commercial advertising or promotion, as under the Lanham Act. See Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Solution, 513 F.3d 1038, 
1052 (9th Cir. 2008). The Ninth Circuit's rationale for allowing false advertising-based antitrust claims—to prevent the deception 
of buyers to the detriment of rivals—is the same as the policy behind the Lanham Act. Indeed, Harcourt Brace's de minimis 
presumption test closely tracks the elements of a Lanham Act claim. Compare Harcourt Brace, 108 F.3d at 1152 (antitrust 
plaintiff must show statements are ""(1) clearly false, (2) clearly material, (3) clearly likely to induce reasonable reliance, (4) made 
to buyers without knowledge of the subject matter, (5) continued for prolonged periods, and (6) not readily susceptible of 
neutralization""), with Newcal Indus., 513 F.3d at 1052 (Lanham Act plaintiff must show that statement is (1) false, (2) in 
commercial advertising or promotion, (3) deceptive, (4) material, (5) in interstate commerce, and (6) that plaintiff had been 
injured)."
870,3," ""The fact is that there is nothing more important than having the manufacturers be competitive because they do provide the 
living for the athletes and that's what's really helped the sport of swimming to allow the athletes to swim to older ages, more like 
track and field. I have always felt that swimming should be like track and field (in terms of the ages and longevity of athletes) but 
the problem we have now is that everyone is contracted to one suit and some are contracted to an inferior product and those 
manufacturers need to let go and everyone can compete on a level playing field with a product that is the same and then they 
need to put the effort in and catch up."" (COE, Ex. 13.) "
871,4, The Court takes judicial notice of SwimNews.com. Fed. R. Evid. 201(b).
871,5," Although TYR has a video recording of the coaches meeting, (see Hilton Decl. ¶ 2), it is unable to point out where Schubert 
actually made such an assertion. The only evidence of this statement is the coach's declaration, executed over two years after 
the meeting took place. However, because this is a motion for summary judgment, the Court may not weigh this evidence 
against the actual recording of the coaches meeting. Balint v. Carson City, Nev., 180 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir. 1999)."
871,6," HN8[
] As noted above, the Court finds that an alleged false advertisement must, at a minimum, be actionable non-puffery 
under the Lanham Act. See Harcourt Brace, 108 F.3d at 1152 (noting the difficulty of distinguishing actionable false statements 
from puffing in setting for the de minimis presumption). "
872,7," ""In the testing that they [Speedo] do, and they go all the way to NASA and they test with a device at NASA, test the friction of 
the suit . . . . And you quantify the suit that evolved in Melbourne as being 4% less friction as the one that they had in Sydney . . . 
. And they quantify the suit that's going to come out in Beijing as being 3% faster than the suit that came out in Melbourne, or 3% 
less friction than the suit that came out in Melbourne."" (COE, Ex. 8, [Recording of National Team Coaches Meeting, Dec. 16-17, 
2007, Disk 4] at 39:05.)"
872,8," The Court reads TYR's argument as using Skinner's comments to provide the context for statements by Schubert, and not as 
providing a separate instance of false advertising. (See Opp'n Br. 9.) In any case, Defendants would be entitled to summary 
judgment, as TYR admits that it cannot prove "
873,9," The Defendants do not argue that the statement at the 2008 Manchester team meeting and the statement to the junior 
swimmers in 2009 are puffery."
873,10," This holding is supported by the fact that the Ninth Circuit has applied the ""significant and enduring impact"" test for claims 
outside the context of false advertising. Adaptive Power Solutions, LLC v. Hughes Missile Sys. Co., 141 F.3d 947, 952 (9th Cir. 
1998) "
874,11," Because the supplemental export report by Jules H. Kamin (""Kamin"") relies entirely on Cantor's report, it suffers from the 
same flaws. (See COE, Ex. 3 ¶ 1.) Kamin opines that: [*24] [t]he fact that Speedo was able to increase its market share, the absolute quantity of units sold, and its prices while 
the quality of its championship suits was not superior to that of TYR's . . . [shows] that the conduct of the defendants cause 
economic injury to consumers, sometimes called injury to competition. (Id. ¶ 5.) However, as discussed above, Cantor's report does not measure actual market share; it only measures Speedo's sales 
relative to TYR's. And Cantor's report does not support the claim that Speedo increased prices. Cantor merely found that 
Speedo charged higher prices than TYR. (COE, Ex. 1. ¶¶ 39-40 & tbl. 8.) Thus, Kamin's assertion of ""allocative inefficiency"" is 
based on faulty assumptions. (See Kamin Decl. ¶ 5(b) & (c).) "
875,12," These estimates also demonstrate the fallacy of the Cantor report. By excluding the sales of blueseventy, the new entrant, 
Cantor's analysis completely fails to account for 75% of the market, at least at this retailer."
875,13," TYR contends that the ""enduring impact"" test is a low bar, citing In re Remeron Antitrust Litigation, 335 F. Supp. 2d 522 
(D.N.J. 2004) and Indiana Grocery Co. v. Super Valu Stores, 647 F. Supp. 254 (S.D. Ind. 1986), both of which allowed antitrust "
876,," claims to proceed for relatively short periods of alleged unlawful conduct. However, neither of these cases involved a false 
advertising antitrust claim and, thus, neither applied the ""significant and enduring impact"" test set forth in Harcourt Brace. See 
Remeron, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 526-27; Indiana Grocery, 647 F. Supp. at 256-57. And although Thompson's Gas & Elec. Serv. v. 
BP Am., 691 F. Supp. 2d 860 (N.D. Ill. 2010), cites the Harcourt Brace test, it neither applies the test, nor does it involve a false 
advertising claim. 691 F. Supp. 2d 860 at 862-865."
876,14," TYR also presents the declaration of Dean Jackson, Sales Director at blueseventy, noting that, for all of blueseventy's 
success, it has been unable to sign any NCAA teams to sponsorship contracts. (Jackson Decl. ¶ 5.) Jackson states that ""Coach 
Schubert's influence and his relationship with Speedo created a barrier that was 'insurmountable.'"" (Id. ¶ 6.) Jackson does not 
purport to be an expert on economics and, in any case, attributes the ""insurmountable"" barrier to Schubert's influence rather 
than any false advertising. This declaration is far from demonstrating a significant impact on competition."
876,15," TYR does not rebut evidence that it had trouble meeting demand for its championship suits. It does submit a declaration that it 
has the capacity to produce 10,000-12,000 Tracer Light or Tracer Rise swimsuits per month, (Meng Decl. ¶ 2), but this hardly 
rebuts Speedo's evidence that the demand for TYR's suits outpaced its ability to supply the suits, despite its apparently 
strenuous efforts to do so. "
878,16," Speedo was granted summary judgment with respect to Schubert's statement to reporter Craig Lord because that statement 
was not commercial speech or advertising. (Docket No. 154 at 26-28.) TYR provides no grounds for reconsidering that ruling. 
The other statements that form the basis of TYR's antitrust disparagement claim were either not alleged to be the basis for the 
Lanham Act claim or were not raised by TYR in opposition to Speedo's prior summary judgment motion. (See Compl.; Docket 
No. 127 at 24-30.) It is too late for them to amend its Lanham Act now, on a motion to reconsider a grant of summary judgment. "
879,17," In fact, Schubert claims not to have known about the Tracer Rise at the time, (Supp. Schubert Decl. ¶ 6), though this is 
disputed."
879,18," The testimony of Genadijus Sokolovas and Russell Mark that USA Swimming and Speedo did not do internal ""testing"" on 
swimsuits prior to Schubert's comments, (Sokolovas Depo. at 16:11-25; Mark Depo. at 30:18-31:12), does not rebut Schubert's 
claim to have informally analyzed swim times involving the LZR Racer."
879,19," TYR argues that Schubert's statement is literally false because of the difference between 1.55% and 2%. The Court does not 
think that a statement can reasonably be found to be false because a number is rounded up to an integer according to 
commonly-accepted rules for rounding, the same used in the federal tax code. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 3402(b)(4) (allowing 
rounding to the nearest dollar for calculating withholding). More precisely, the Court does not think that the difference between 
1.55% and the rounded number of 2% is a material difference. "
880,20," The Lanham Act also requires that the plaintiff prove that the defendant ""caused its false statement to enter interstate 
commerce."" Southland Sod, 108 F.3d at 1139. Given that the two charged statements were given personally at a closed meeting 
in Manchester and to two junior swimmers in Guam, respectively, it is doubtful that TYR could satisfy this requirement either."
880,21," The Court rejects this new argument because it is not grounds for reconsideration. TYR has not demonstrated that it could not 
have raised this argument—which has nothing to do with the new expert report—on summary judgment. "
881,22," TYR argues that it would be impossible to track ""word-of-mouth"" dissemination. However, the impact and dissemination of the 
statement could potentially be measured by consumer surveys, as recognized by courts in other Lanham Act claims. See, e.g., 
Brunswick Corp. v. Spinit Reel Co., 832 F.2d 513, 525 (10th Cir. 1987) (""Actual consumer confusion may be shown by direct 
evidence, a diversion of sales or direct testimony from the public, or by circumstantial evidence such as consumer surveys.""). 
TYR has provided no such evidence. "
886,1," The individual defendants include Norman L. Turner, Kenneth H. Purser, and Alice W. Enge and Elizabeth Dill, as Co-
Executrixes of the Estate of Harald A. Enge. "
887,2," ""A Walker Process claim arises when a patentee baselessly institutes litigation to enforce a patent known to be unenforceable 
because the patent was procured by fraud."" Novo Nordisk of N. Am., Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 885 F. Supp. 522, 526 (S.D.N.Y. 
1995) (citing Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965))."
887,3," Because AIBT's counterclaims for invalidity, non-infringement and non-enforceability had been dismissed by the District Court 
prior to this court's issuance of its R&R, this court addressed only the remaining five antitrust counterclaims in its decision."
887,4," Consistent with the relevant standard, this court has considered the documents attached to AIBT's Complaint, as well as the 
exhibits attached to the Declaration of Christopher G. Lim (""Def. Ex.    ""), which is attached to the defendants' memorandum in 
support of their motion to dismiss. (Docket No. 9). This court has also considered two letters from Kenneth H. Purser to Harald "
888,," A. Enge dated October 3, 2002 and February 12, 2003. Those letters are described  [**9] in the Complaint and were submitted 
to the court during oral argument. "
890,5," Although the plaintiff alleges that the defendants misled the PTO by changing their description of the  [**19] '328 Patent in the 
""'702 Patent Application,"" the exhibits attached to the Complaint demonstrate that the defendants changed their description of 
the '328 Patent in the '085 Continuation Patent Application. (See Compl. PP 46-47; Compl. Exs. E at 5 and G at 5). This court 
has construed AIBT's allegations in accordance with the exhibits. "
891,6," 37 C.F.R. § 1.56(a) addresses the duty of ""[e]ach individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application … 
to disclose to the [PTO] all information known to that individual to be material to patentability …."" "
894,7," HN4[
] The issue ""whether conduct in procuring or enforcing a patent is sufficient to strip a patentee of its immunity from the 
antitrust laws is to be decided as a question of Federal Circuit law."" Nobelpharma AB, 141 F.3d at 1068. However, ""issues 
involving other elements of antitrust  [**33] law such as relevant market, market power, damages, etc.,"" which ""are not unique 
to patent law,"" are governed by the law of the regional circuit. Id."
894,8," In arguing that all of AIBT's antitrust claims are subject to dismissal for failure to plead fraud with particularity, Varian makes no 
distinction between AIBT's Walker Process claims and its sham litigation claims. (See Def. Mem. (Docket No. 9) at 10). Similarly, 
AIBT has made no such distinction in the body of its memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss, arguing instead that its 
Complaint contains sufficient allegations to plead fraud on the PTO. (See Pl. Opp. Mem. (Docket No. 11) at 6-15). Contrary to its 
position in the earlier litigation, AIBT argues in a footnote that the standards for these claims differ, and that it is not required to 
establish fraud in order to prevail on its sham litigation claims. (See id. at 7 n.3). However, the First Circuit has ""repeatedly held 
that HN5[
] arguments raised only in a footnote or in a perfunctory manner are waived."" Nat'l Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios,"
894,181," F.3d 38, 61 n.17 (1st Cir. 1999), aff'd sub nom. Crosby v. Nat'l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 120 S. Ct. 2288, 147 L. 
Ed. 2d 352 (2000).  [**34] See also Redondo-Borges v. U.S. Dep't of Housing & Urban Dev., 421 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005) (""Few 
principles are more sacrosanct in this circuit than the principle that 'issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied 
by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.'"") (quoting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 
1990)). Accordingly, AIBT's passing argument is insufficient to warrant separate analyses of AIBT's fraud claims and its sham 
litigation claims. In any event, it is clear from the Complaint that the factual basis for all of AIBT's claims is that Varian, by its 
infringement action, was attempting to enforce a patent that it knew had been obtained by fraud on the PTO. (See Compl. PP 
90-93). Therefore, the parties' arguments relating to AIBT's fraud claims control the sham litigation claims as well. "
895,9," In its Reply memorandum, Varian suggests that collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, applies to AIBT's claims concerning the 
'328 Patent ""because AIBT has not added any substantively  [**37] new facts or arguments about the '328 patent beyond those 
already held insufficient as a matter of law to allege fraud[.]"" (Def. Reply Mem. (Docket No. 15) at 4-5). This court disagrees. The 
Complaint contains new factual allegations regarding the '328 Patent, including facts regarding the substance of two letters from 
Purser to Enge, as well as facts regarding the changes to the description of Figure 6 of the '328 Patent. No such allegations 
were included in Varian's counterclaim in the infringement action, and this court has not previously considered whether they 
support AIBT's claims of fraud on the PTO. Accordingly, application of collateral estoppel principles would not be appropriate. 
See Keystone Shipping Co. v. New England Power Co., 109 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 1997) (HN8[
] ""The principle of collateral 
estoppel, or issue preclusion … bars relitigation of any factual or legal issue that was actually decided in previous litigation 
between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim."") (emphasis in original; quotations and citations omitted). "
896,10," The Inventor Declarations submitted to the PTO in this case are not comparable to declarations submitted to the PTO in 
eSpeed, Inc. v. Brokertec USA, L.L.C., 480 F.3d 1129 (Fed. Cir. 2007), on which AIBT relies. There the court upheld the district 
court's conclusion that there was an intent to deceive the PTO where the applicant had filed a ""blizzard of paper"" describing the 
prior art, along with a declaration containing ""an outright false statement"" regarding that art. eSpeed, Inc., 480 F.3d at 1137-38. 
Here, the plaintiff alleges that the Declarations were false only because they were  [**41] inconsistent with an opinion that had 
been expressed by an inventor, which opinion was not required to be disclosed to the PTO. Moreover, as detailed above, the 
facts provided to the PTO regarding the '328 Patent were not ""outright false."" "
900,11," AIBT's allegations regarding its potential customer, PSC, do not on their own allege antitrust injury. Although AIBT alleges that 
the infringement action caused a delay in the implementation of a demonstration plan that the plaintiff had planned for PSC, it 
does not allege that the delay resulted in harm to the competitive process. In particular, but without limitation, AIBT has not 
alleged facts showing that PSC ultimately accepted AIBT's product. Therefore, it has not shown that the infringement action, 
rather than AIBT's own inability to consummate a deal with PSC, impeded the plaintiff's ability to compete in the marketplace 
and deprived manufacturers of a superior product. Similarly, to the extent AIBT alleges other types of harm, such as increased 
costs or harm to its good will, it will need to show how any such harm obstructed the competitive process. It will also need to 
show that any damages it suffered occurred a result of Varian's conduct in pursuing baseless infringement claims and not as a 
result of its own decision to extend the infringement action by pursuing its antitrust counterclaims. In any event, because this 
court concludes  [**59] that AIBT has alleged antitrust harm based on its allegations regarding its sale to TSMC, the precise 
contours of AIBT's antitrust injury do not need to be defined at this time. "

whether on the facts alleged the law states with certainty that no recovery is necessary. Hawks by Hawks v. Livermore, 157 Pa.

921,15," HN11[
] The General Assembly's intent with the enactment of Section 506(c)(3) of the LIPL, 41 P.S. § 506(c)(3), was to provide the Department with the authority to issue an enforcement action. In essence, a borrower may now proceed before the 
Department and seek restitution for his  [**33] or her actual damages. The Department would then investigate the alleged illegal 
activity of the lender and pursuant to Section 506(b) of the LIPL, 41 P.S. § 506(b), issue subpoenas and require the production 
of documents. If the Department concludes that that the lender violated the LIPL, it may order restitution of the borrower's actual 
damages under Section 506(c)(3) of the LIPL. The lender then may request a hearing before the hearing officer who ""may 
review or revise determinations made by the department."" See Section 503E.(8) of the Department of Banking Code, 71 P.S. § 
733-503E.(8). Last, the lender and/or the Department, as an aggrieved party, may appeal to this Court. See 2 Pa. C.S. § 702. 
Obviously, this procedure was not followed in the present matter. Section 1953 of the Act, 1 Pa. C.S. § 1953, HN12[
] provides 
that ""the portions of statute which were not altered by the amendment shall be construed as effective from the time of their 
original enactment, and the new provisions shall be construed as effective only from the date when the amendment became 
effective."""
921,16," The Department contends that it may not ignore the fact that the Defendants have kept millions of dollars that were illegal 
obtained in violation of the CDCA and the LIPL which were promulgated to protect ""weak and needy borrowers from extortion 
and outrageous demands of unscrupulous lenders."" Pollice v. National Tax Funding, L.P., 225 F.3d 379 (3d Cir. 2000) (quoting 
47 C.J.S. ""Interest & Usury § 88 (1982)). See Plaintiffs' Brief In Opposition to Defendants' Preliminary Objections at 8. "

Pennsylvania Constitution  [**36] provides that ""[a]n Attorney General . . . shall be the chief law officer of the Commonwealth 
and shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as imposed by law."""
922,18," In TAP II, the factual situation was as follows: As noted in this Court's earlier decision in this  [**39] matter, TAP I [Commonwealth v. TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., 
868 A.2d 624 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005) (TAP I)], the present controversy arose around the use of a pricing standard know as the 
Average Wholesale Price (AWP). The Commonwealth's claims are based generally on its assertion that all the Defendants 
knowingly inflated this self-reported AWP for inclusion in a pharmaceutical publication upon which the Commonwealth 
relied. The Commonwealth alleges that the reason the Defendants inflated the AWP, which in some cases reflected a price 
hundreds of times higher than what would constitute an actual average wholesale price, is that the Defendants would 
generate revenue by virtue of direct purchasers paying more for their products and such systematic inflation would also 
result increased market share. As stated above, AWPs are used by the Commonwealth to establish a basis for reimbursement to the middleman-such as 
physicians who administer drugs to patients directly (such as intravenous cancer drugs) and pharmacy benefit managers 
who buy in quantity for resale to customers . . . . . . . . The Commonwealth further points out that the AWP plays a significant role in budgeting strategies, and  [**40] that it affects 
administrative decisions, we presume such as eligibility standards based on income and the scope of coverage. Id. at 1132-33. "
923,19, The Department cites this case to support its argument that it has parens patraie standing.
923,20," Additionally, there are serious due process questions as to whether Advance America may face litigation a second time based 
upon the same transaction. In fact, Advance America directs this Court's attention to ""[t]he Commonwealth's [Department's] 
concern about NCAS [Advance America] escaping with ill-gotten gains ignores pending class action lawsuits seeking to recover "
924,," three times the alleged overcharges NCAS [Advance America] generated in its loan program."" Johnson v. Advance America,

relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. No action or proceeding shall be open to objection on the 
ground that a declaratory judgment or degree is prayed for. The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form 
and effect, and such declarations shall have the force  [**44] and effect of a final judgment."
924,22," In Mulcahy, our Pennsylvania Supreme Court interpreted Section 1 of the Act of May 28, 1858, P.L. 622, 41 P.S. § 3 which 
was the predecessor to the LIPL. "
925,23," Section 4 of the UTPCPL, 73 P.S. § 201-4, HN21[
] provides that ""[w]henever the Attorney General . . . has reason to 
believe that any person is using or about to use any method, act or practice declared by section 3 of this act to be unlawful, and 
that proceeding would be in the public interest, he may bring an action in the name of the Commonwealth against such person . . 
. ."""
925,24," Defendants cite to nineteen other statutes that explicitly state a violation of that particular statute is a violation of UTPCPL. See 
Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Support of Preliminary Objections at 21-22. "
926,25," Defendants in the reply brief memorandum persuasively distinguish the four cases that the Attorney General cites in support of 
the per se violation argument: The AG [Attorney General] relies on four cases to support that 'violation of other consumer protection legislation are 
deemed a violation of the CPL.' (Pl. Br. 32.) None of those cases, however, stands for so broad a proposition. Hammer v. 
Nikol, 659 A.2d 617 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1995), merely held that unlawful conduct that is also fraudulent violates the UTPCPL. 
Id. at 620 (conduct that violated a city ordinance also violated the UTPCPL because the trial court record showed all the 
elements of common fraud). And the three remaining cases, Commonwealth v. Peoples Benefit Services, 923 A.2d 1230 
(Pa. Commw. Ct. 2007), Commonwealth v. Tolleson, . . . 14 Pa. Commw. 72, 321 A.2d 664 [(Pa. Cmwlth. 1974)], and 
Commonwealth v. Armstrong, 74 Pa. D. & C.2d 579, 583 (C.P. Phila. Co. 1974), all involved violations of the Fictitious 
Names Act (""FNA"") [the FNA is presently codified at 54 Pa. C.S. § [§] 301. . . [-332]  [**51] a law that is aimed at preventing 
one of the chief wrongdoings identified in the UTPCPL-confusing consumers about the 'source' of a good or service. 73 
P.S. § 201-2(4)(ii)]. Unlike the FNA, neither the CDCA nor the LIPL has as its primary aim the prevention of fraud or deceit. The AG [Attorney 
General] concedes this, acknowledging that these laws protect consumers from paying too much interest. (footnotes and 
citations omitted and emphasis in original). See Defendants' Reply Memorandum in Support of Preliminary Objections to the Amended Complaint at 29. Defendants also distinguish the other cases cited by the Attorney General in support of per se liability. See Defendants' Reply 
Memorandum in Support of Preliminary Objections to the Amended Complaint at 30-32."
926,26, The Attorney General also alleges in Count 3 of the Amended Complaint: . . . .
926,54," . In furtherance of their common interests and pursuant to a common design, AA created Advance America and 
established its loan centers to offer the line of credit product in the Commonwealth, when it knew or should have known that 
Advance America was thereby violating the Consumer Protection Law [UTPCPL]."
926,55," . AA rendered substantial assistance to Advance America to establish and operate loan centers and offer the line of 
credit product in the Commonwealth . . . . Amended Complaint, Paragraphs 54 and 55 at 14. "
927,27," The Attorney General again alleges that AA rendered substantial assistance to Advance America with knowledge that 
Advance America was violating the UTPCPL. Amended Complaint, Paragraphs 63 and 64 at 16-17."
927,28," In Feeney, our Superior Court stated  [**54] the elements of common law fraud that must be proven in order to recover under 
the catchall provisions of Section 2(4)(xxi) of the UTPCPL: [A] plaintiff must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence: (1) a representation; (2) which is material to the transaction 
at hand; (3) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to whether it is true or false; (4) with the intent of 
misleading another into relying on it; (5) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation; and (6) the resulting injury was 
proximately caused by the reliance . . . . Id. at 597. However, HN25[
] this Court has adopted a less restrictive interpretation for pleading fraud after the 1996 amendments to the 
UTPCPL than pleading common law fraud. In Commonwealth v. Percudani, 825 A.2d 743 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004), this Court stated: This Court has not addressed the 1996 amendments to the Law [UTPCPL] and their effect on pleading fraud under Section 
2(4)(xxi). In our research, we have uncovered two divergent views. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania has issued several 
opinions after the 1996 amendments in which it continues to state that a plaintiff must allege the elements of common law 
fraud in order to recover under  [**55] the catchall provisions of Section 2(4)(xxi) . . . . Conversely, several decisions of the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania have rejected the Superior 
Court's adherence to the pre-1996 pleadings requirement . . . .In Rodriguez v. Mellon Bank, N.A., 218 B.R. 764 
(Bankr.E.D.Pa.1998) . . . the Bankruptcy Court rejected the pre-1996 pleadings requirements noting that the Legislature's 
addition of the words 'or deceptive conduct' signals an approval of a less restrictive interpretation of the law and affirms the 
Supreme Court's position that the Law [UTPCPL] should be liberally construed. In Flores [v. Shapiro & Kreisman, 246 F.Supp.2d 427 Bankr.E.D. 2002] the Bankruptcy Court . . . noted that maintaining the 
pre-1996 pleading requirements would render the words 'or deceptive conduct' redundant and superfluous, which is 
contrary to the rules of statutory construction . . . . Prior to 1996, the Law [UTPCPL] merely prohibited 'other fraudulent conduct.' The Legislature's intervention in 1996 in 
conjunction with the Supreme Court's pronouncement that the Law [UTPCPL] is to be liberally construed and the Superior 
Court's continuing . . . restrictive view of the Law [UTPCPL]  [**56] leads us to conclude that the position adopted by the 
Bankruptcy Court is that which would be espoused by the Supreme Court. (citations omitted and emphasis added) Id. at 746-47. "
928,29," The Attorney General illustrates to this Court that Defendants conduct was deceptive in that the use of the phony monthly 
participation fee resulted ""in a real interest rate of 368%"" which is plainly ""unfair."" See Plaintiffs' Brief in Opposition to 
Defendants' Preliminary Objections at 43."
928,30," Defendants contend that ""any disclosure of the Monthly Participation Fee by Advance America as part of the finance charge 
would violate the disclosure requirements of TILA and Reg Z [12 C.F.R. § 226.5(b)]. The AG's [Attorney General's] claim is 
therefore, preempted by federal law."" See Defendants' Preliminary Objections to Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint at 28. Section 1610(b) of the TILA, 15 U.S.C. § 1610(b) provides: HN28[
] State credit charge statues. Except as provided in section 129 [15 USCS § 1639],  [**59] this title . . . does not otherwise annul, alter or affect in any manner, scope or applicability of the laws of any State, including, but not limited to, 
laws relating to the types, amounts or rates of charges, or any element or charges, permissible under such laws in 
connection with the extension or use of credit, nor does this title . . . extend the applicability of those laws to any class of 
persons or transactions to which they would otherwise apply . . . . (emphasis added). Regulation Z, 12 CFR § 226.1 provides that ""[t]he regulation does not govern charges for consumer credit."" (emphasis 
added). "
929,," The Attorney General cogently responds that there is ""no claim that the Defendants [Advance America] failed to comply with 
TILA or the accompanying Reg Z with respect to its disclosure . . . Defendants' [Advance America's] argument assumes that the 
so-called 'Monthly Participation Fee' was in fact 'charged for participation in a credit plan on a monthly basis.'"" See Plaintiffs' 
Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Preliminary Objections at 43. ""The Commonwealth, on the other hand, contends that this 'fee' 
was nothing more than a ruse, artifice, and a subterfuge that was actually 'interest'  [**60] as defined by Pennsylvania law."" See 
Plaintiffs' Brief in Opposition to Defendants' Preliminary Objections at 43. This Court agrees with the Attorney General that 
Advance America may not raise the provisions of the TILA as a defense to avoid liability under the UTPCPL. "
930,1," The origin of the parens patriae doctrine can be traced to medieval England. Conceptually, the doctrine is derived from the 
king's royal prerogative to act as the guardian of an individual unable to protect his own interests. The attorney general, at 
common law, was the chief legal representative of the sovereign in the courts and was the only officer who could prosecute on 
behalf of the people in order to protect the interests  [**63] of the crown. As in England, a colonial attorney general, acting as the 
chief legal officer of a British colony, enjoyed broad common law power to bring suit in parens patriae on behalf of colonial 
citizens. Jay L. Himes, State Parens Patriae Authority: The Evolution of the State Attorney General's Authority 1-2, 18-19 (The 
Institute for Law and Economic Policy Symposium paper, Apr. 23, 2004), available at http://www.abanet.org/antitrust/at-

931,2," It states, in relevant part: The Attorney General shall represent the Commonwealth and all Commonwealth agencies and upon request, the 
Departments of Auditor General and State Treasury and the Public Utility Commission in any action brought by or against 
the Commonwealth or its agencies, and may intervene in any other action, including those involving charitable bequests 
and trusts or the constitutionality of any statute."

940,1," Bayer obtained an additional six-month period of pediatric exclusivity from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) until June 
9, 2004. See 21 U.S.C. § 355a(b)(1)(B)(i)(II). "
941,2," Although this statutory stay is typically called the  [**6] ""thirty-month stay,"" in fact the stay can last for over four years. Compare 
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iii) (default maximum duration of stay is thirty months provided notice of ANDA IV is received more than 
five years after ANDA approval) with § 355(j)(5)(F)(ii) (result of earlier-filed ANDA IV is that stay is lengthened, ending five years 
plus thirty months after FDA approval of the branded drug)."
941,3," This 180-day exclusivity period became law without discussion in the relevant House Report and without debate. See H.R. 
Rep. No. 98-857, p. 1, at 28 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2647, 2661. Moreover, it was apparently not contemplated 
at the time of passage that the regulatory scheme would facilitate collusion between branded and generic firms. See e.g., S. 
Rep. No. 107-167, at 4 (2002) (""Agreeing with  [**7] smaller rivals to delay or limit competition is an abuse of the Hatch-Waxman 
law . . . ."")."
941,4," In Joblove v. Barr Labs. Inc, (In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig.), 466 F.3d 187 (2d Cir. 2005) (Tamoxifen""), the panel 
majority suggested otherwise, repeating the district court's claim that the exclusivity period cedes to the first ANDA filer to 
successfully defend. Compare Tamoxifen, 466 F.3d at 214, with In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 277 F. Supp. 2d 121, 134 
(E.D.N.Y. 2003). As we discuss in Section 5, infra, this aspect of our Tamoxifen decision was erroneous. See C. Scott Hemphill, 
Paying for Delay: Pharmaceutical Patent Settlement As a Regulatory Design Problem, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1553, 1583-86 (2006)."
941,5," Barr claimed that the  [**8] patent was invalid on the following grounds: (1) obviousness; (2) obviousness type double counting; 
and (3) inequitable conduct."
941,6, The parties subsequently agreed to extend the stay until after the entry of final judgment.
941,7," To  [**9] be more precise, the parties executed separate settlement agreements between: (1) Bayer and Barr, and (2) Bayer 
and HMR/Rugby, which was subsequently acquired by Watson. Bayer, Barr, and HMR also executed a supply agreement. "
942,8," As an alternative to quarterly payments, the settlement gave Bayer the right to either provide Barr with a license to sell Bayer-
manufactured Cipro at a royalty rate of 70% of Bayer's average selling price for brand-name Cipro. Bayer elected to make 
quarterly payments instead. Settlement payments ultimately totaled $ 398.1 million."
942,9," Barr reserved its right to reinstate its ANDA-IV if Bayer's patent were later held to be invalid. Four generic manufacturers -- 
Ranbaxy, Schein, Mylan, and Carlsbad -- subsequently challenged the Cipro patent. Ranbaxy's challenge was dismissed as 
moot in October 1999. Mylan's and Schein's consolidated challenges were dismissed at summary judgment and this dismissal 
was affirmed on appeal. Bayer AG v. Schein Pharm., Inc., 129 F. Supp. 2d 705 (D.N.J. 2001), aff'd, 301 F.3d 1306 (Fed. Cir. 
2002). Carlsbad's challenge was rejected after a nine-day bench trial. Bayer AG v. Carlsbad Tech., Inc., No. Civ. 01-867-B (S.D. 
Cal. Aug. 26, 2002). "
943,10," The indirect purchaser plaintiffs amended their complaint to add state-law, Walker Process antitrust claims, so-called based on 
the Supreme Court's decision in Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., which recognized an antitrust claim 
when patents are obtained by fraud. 382 U.S. 172, 177, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965). Because the Walker Process 
claims are preempted by patent law, see Cipro III, 363 F. Supp. 2d at 543-44, we transferred the indirect purchaser plaintiffs' 
appeal to the Federal Circuit, while retaining jurisdiction over the direct purchaser plaintiffs' appeals. The Federal Circuit 
ultimately affirmed the district court on the indirect purchaser plaintiffs' claims, agreeing with the district court's conclusion that 
the settlement did not restrain competition beyond the exclusionary zone of the Cipro patent. 544 F.3d 1323, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 
2008). "

944,12," See, e.g., C. Scott Hemphill, Paying for Delay,  [**18] 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. at 1561-62 (2006) (arguing that a settlement should 
be accorded a presumption of illegality if the settlement both restricts the generic firm's ability to market a competing drug and 
includes compensation from the innovator to the generic firm); Herbert Hovenkamp, Mark Janis, & Mark A. Lemley, 
Anticompetitive Settlement of Intellectual Property Disputes, 87 Minn. L. Rev. 1719, 1759-60 (2003) (proposing that a defendant 
would overcome the presumptive unlawfulness of a reverse payment settlement by ""showing both (1) that the ex ante likelihood 
of prevailing in its infringement lawsuit is significant, and (2) the size of the payment is no more than the expected value of 
litigation and collateral costs attending the lawsuit""). But see Alan Devlin, The Stochastic Relationship Between Patents and 
Antitrust, 5 J. Competition L. & Econ. 75, 108 (2009) (""uncritical application of standard principles of competition law to 
information markets may be myopic.""). "
945,13, Our jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims is also established by Tamoxifen. See 466 F.3d at 199-200.
945,14," Plaintiffs argued below that the agreements were unlawful because Barr and HMR conceded the validity of several additional 
patents related to Cipro. See Cipro II, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 254. Plaintiffs do not press this argument on appeal."
945,15," When Bayer and Barr entered the settlement HN16[
] in January 1997, an ANDA filer's right to 180-day exclusivity was contingent on their ""successful defense"" of a patent infringement suit. See 21 C.F.R. § 314.107(c)(1). Since Barr did not 
successfully defend the lawsuit by entering a settlement, the court found it had no  [**24] claim to the exclusivity period. Cipro II, 
261 F. Supp. 2d at 243, 247. After courts rejected the FDA's ""successful defense"" requirement, see, e.g., Mova Pharm. Corp. v. 
Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 329 U.S. App. D.C. 341 (D.C. Cir. 1998), the FDA permanently removed it. See Effective Date and 
Approval of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, 63 Fed. Reg. 59710, 57911 (Nov. 5, 1998). But this occurred after the 
agreements in this case were executed. Plaintiffs argue that the questionable validity of the regulation suggests that Barr tried to "
946,," exploit it in order to keep other manufacturers from the market, but Tamoxifen specifically rejected this argument. 466 F.3d at 
218-19. Plaintiffs assert that the Tamoxifen panel did not consider a district court case that found an earlier FDA exclusivity 
requirement contrary to the Hatch-Waxman statute. See Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Young, 723 F. Supp. 1523 (D.D.C. 1989), vacated 
as moot, 43 F.3d 712, 310 U.S. App. D.C. 61 (D.C. Cir. 1989). However, this argument is unavailing because the FDA 
promulgated the ""successful defense"" requirement in effect at the time of the agreements here after the Inwood Labs decision. 
See Abbreviated New Drug Application Regulations; Patent and Exclusivity Provision, 59 Fed. Reg. 50338 (Oct. 3, 1994). 
 [**25] The established law at the time of the agreement precluded Barr from retaining a right to exclusivity."
946,16," Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in Cipro III when it admitted that, based on its ruling in Cipro II, it need not 
consider this claim ""anew."" See 363 F. Supp. 2d at 540 (citing Cipro II, 261 F. Supp. 2d at 243-47). Cipro II considered the claim 
in the context of plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment. When addressing defendants' motion for summary judgment in 
Cipro III, the district court was required to view the evidence in plaintiffs' favor. Because the district court's analysis is consistent 
with Tamoxifen, which was decided at the 12(b)(6) stage, the district court did not err by incorporating its analysis from Cipro II."
946,17," One study found that generic manufacturers prevailed in 73% of the Hatch-Waxman lawsuits that were tried to verdict. See 
Brief for American Antitrust Institute (""AAI"") as Amicus at 3 (citing Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration, at vii (2002),

947,19," Amici similarly argue that the Tamoxifen court's permissive approach to reverse payments offers protection to patent holders

952,1," The Complaint also fails to allege a relevant market that extends beyond the KitchenAid attachment aftermarket. ""'Where the 
plaintiff fails to define its proposed relevant market with reference to the rule of reasonable interchangeability and cross-elasticity 
of demand, or alleges a proposed relevant market that clearly does not encompass all interchangeable substitute products even 
when all factual inferences are granted in plaintiff's favor, the relevant market is legally insufficient and a motion to dismiss may 
be granted.'""  [*12] In re eBay Seller Antitrust Litig., 545 F. Supp. 2d 1027, 1031 (N. D. Cal. 2008) (quoting Queen City Pizza, 
Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 436 (3d Cir.1997)). Here, POURfect has failed to allege any facts indicating that the 
Scrape-a-Bowl is interchangeable with either the KitchenAid brand or other similar products on the market, nor has POURfect 
alleged facts regarding how the prices of some aftermarket attachments affect the demand for other attachments. Therefore, 
POURfect's Complaint does not survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See Big Bear Lodging Ass'n v. Snow Summit, Inc., 182 F.3d 
1096, 1105 (9th Cir. 1999) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff's antitrust complaint where plaintiff failed to allege ""that there are no 
other goods or services that are reasonably interchangeable with lodging accommodations or ski packages within this 
geographic market""). "
953,2," To the extent POURfect alleges attempted  [*17] monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, that claim also fails 
because an attempted monopolization claim also requires a plaintiff to allege predatory or anticompetitive conduct and causal 
antitrust injury, which, as discussed above, POURfect has not done. See Rebel Oil Co., 51 F.3d at 1433 (stating that an 
attempted monopolization claim includes four elements: (1) specific intent to control prices or destroy competition; (2) predatory "
954,," or anticompetitive conduct directed at accomplishing that purpose; (3) a dangerous probability of achieving 'monopoly power'; 
and (4) causal antitrust injury"")."
954,3," Although the Court does not address the state law claims, a cursory reading of the Complaint indicates that the state law claims 
may also suffer from insufficient pleading requirements under Twombly and Iqbal. "
962,1," USA Swimming and Schubert also argue that TYR did not plead a Section 1 false advertising or disparagement claim 
 [**10] against them. This is incorrect. (See Compl. P 13 (""USA SWIMMING, SPEEDO and SCHUBERT have also combined to 
engage in a campaign of falsely disparaging the products of SPEEDO'S competitors, including TYR . . . ."").) USA Swimming and Schubert also appear to contend that TYR should be estopped from asserting a disparagement-based claim 
against them under Section 1 because in TYR's opposition to a motion to dismiss, it stated that Harcourt Brace ""is irrelevant to 
the standards for pleading a Section 1 claim."" (Docket No. 49 at 13.) However, TYR appears to have been arguing that the 
limitations set forth in Harcourt Brace do not apply to a Section 1 claim, not that the Section 1 claim was not based on 
disparagement. Because this argument is not inconsistent with its current argument, TYR is not estopped from asserting a "
963,," disparagement-based theory against USA Swimming and Schubert. See Hamilton v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 270 F.3d 778, 
782 (9th Cir. 2001)."
963,2," Though the parties do not explicitly address the issue and assume that Lanham Act cases are applicable to a false advertising-
based antitrust claim, the Court finds that HN10[
] an antitrust plaintiff must demonstrate that the false statement was made in 
commercial advertising or promotion, as under the Lanham Act. See, e.g., Newcal Indus., Inc. v. Ikon Office Solution, 513 F.3d 
1038, 1052 (9th Cir. 2008). The Ninth Circuit's rationale for allowing false advertising-based antitrust claims--to prevent the 
deception of buyers to the detriment of rivals--is the same as the policy behind the Lanham Act. Indeed,  [**13] Harcourt Brace's 
de minimis presumption test tracks several of the elements of a Lanham Act claim. Compare Harcourt Brace, 108 F.3d at 1152 
(antitrust plaintiff must show statements are ""(1) clearly false, (2) clearly material, (3) clearly likely to induce reasonable reliance, 
(4) made to buyers without knowledge of the subject matter, (5) continued for prolonged periods, and (6) not readily susceptible 
of neutralization""), with Newcal Indus., 513 F.3d at 1052 (Lanham Act plaintiff must show that statement is (1) false, (2) in 
commercial advertising or promotion, (3) likely to deceive, (4) material, (5) in interstate commerce, and (6) that plaintiff had been 
injured). "
964,3," Schubert's full statement, as quoted by Lord, is as follows; The fact is that there is nothing more important than having the manufacturers be competitive because they  [**15] do 
provide the living for the athletes and that's what's really helped the sport of swimming to allow the athletes to swim to older 
ages, more like track and field. I have always felt that swimming should be like track and field (in terms of the ages and 
longevity of athletes) but the problem we have now is that everyone is contracted to one suit and some are contracted to an 
inferior product and those manufacturers need to let go and everyone can compete on a level playing field with a product 
that is the same and then they need to put the effort in and catch up. (COE, Ex. 13.)"
964,4, The Court takes judicial notice of SwimNews.com. Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). 
965,5," Although TYR has a video recording of the coaches meeting, (see Hilton Decl. P 2), it is unable to point out where Schubert 
actually made such an assertion. The only evidence of this statement is the coach's declaration, executed over two years after 
the meeting took place. However, because this is a motion for summary judgment, the Court may not weigh this evidence 
against the actual recording of the coaches meeting. Balint v. Carson City, Nev., 180 F.3d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir. 1999)."
965,6," As discussed above, the Court finds that an alleged false advertisement must, at a minimum, be actionable non-puffery under 
the Lanham Act. See Harcourt Brace, 108 F.3d at 1152 (noting the difficulty of distinguishing actionable false  [**19] statements 
from puffing in setting for the de minimis presumption). "
966,7," Skinner's full statement at the meeting is as follows; In the testing that they [Speedo] do, and they go all the way to NASA and they test with a device at NASA, test the friction 
of the suit . . . . And you quantify the suit that evolved in Melbourne as being 4% less friction as the one that they had in 
Sydney . . . . And they quantify the suit that's going to come out in Beijing as being 3% faster than the suit that came out in 
Melbourne, or 3% less friction than the suit that came out in Melbourne. (COE, Ex. 8 [Recording of National Team Coaches Meeting, Dec. 16-17, 2007, Disk 4] at 39:05.)"
966,8," The Court reads TYR's argument as using Skinner's comments to provide the context for statements by Schubert, and not as 
providing a separate instance of false advertising. (See Opp'n Br. 9.) In any case, Defendants would be entitled to summary 
judgment, as TYR admits that it cannot prove that Skinner's statements are false.  [**24] (Id. at 5:13-15; COE, Exs. 22, 23.)"
966,9," The Defendants do not argue that the statement at the 2008 Manchester team meeting and the statement to the junior 
swimmers in 2009 are puffery. "
967,10," This holding is supported by the fact that the Ninth Circuit has applied the ""significant and enduring impact"" test for claims 
outside the context of false advertising. Adaptive Power Solutions, LLC v. Hughes Missile Sys. Co., 141 F.3d 947, 952 (9th Cir. 
1998) "
968,11," Because the supplemental export report by Jules H. Kamin (""Kamin"") relies entirely on Cantor's report, it suffers from the 
same flaws. (See COE, Ex. 3 P 1.) Kamin opines that: [t]he fact that Speedo was able to increase its market share, the absolute quantity of units sold, and its prices while the 
quality of its championship suits was not superior to that of TYR's . . . [shows] that the conduct of the defendants cause 
economic injury to consumers, sometimes called injury to competition. (Id. P 5.)  [**31] However, as discussed above, Cantor's report does not measure actual market share; it only measures 
Speedo's sales relative to TYR's. And Cantor's report does not support the claim that Speedo increased prices. Cantor merely 
found that Speedo charged higher prices than TYR. (COE, Ex. 1. PP 39-40 & tbl. 8.) Moreover, there is nothing in the record 
indicating the prices charged by other competitors. Thus, Kamin's assertion of ""allocative inefficiency"" is based on faulty 
assumptions. (See Kamin Decl. P 5(b) & (c).) "
969,12," These estimates also demonstrate the fallacy of the Cantor report. By excluding the sales of blueseventy, the new entrant, 
Cantor's analysis completely fails to account for 75% of the market, at least at this retailer."
969,13," TYR contends that the ""enduring impact"" test is a low bar, citing In re Remeron Antitrust Litigation, 335 F. Supp. 2d 522 
(D.N.J. 2004) and Indiana Grocery Co. v. Super Valu Stores, 647 F. Supp. 254 (S.D. Ind. 1986), both of which allowed antitrust 
claims to proceed on the basis of relatively short periods of alleged unlawful conduct. However, neither of these cases involved a 
false advertising antitrust claim and, thus, neither applied the ""significant and enduring impact"" test set forth in Harcourt Brace. 
See Remeron, 335 F. Supp. 2d at 526-27; Indiana Grocery, 647 F. Supp. at 256-57. And although Thompson's Gas & Elec. 
Serv. v. BP Am., No. 08 CV 2693, 691 F. Supp. 2d 860, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16906 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 25, 2010), cites the Harcourt 
Brace test, it neither applies the test, nor does it involve a false advertising claim. Id. at *2-4, *7-10. "
970,14," TYR also presents the declaration of Dean Jackson, Sales Director at blueseventy, noting that, for all of blueseventy's 
success, it has been unable to sign any NCAA teams to sponsorship contracts. (Jackson Decl. P 5.) Jackson states that ""Coach 
Schubert's influence and his relationship with Speedo created a barrier that was 'insurmountable.'"" (Id. P 6.) Jackson does not 
purport to be an expert on economics and, in any case, attributes the ""insurmountable"" barrier  [**37] to Schubert's influence 
rather than any false advertising. This declaration is far from demonstrating a significant impact on competition."
970,15," TYR also does not rebut evidence that it had trouble meeting demand for its championship suits. It does submit a declaration 
that it has the  [**38] capacity to produce 10,000-12,000 Tracer Light or Tracer Rise swimsuits per month, (Meng Decl. P 2), but 
this hardly rebuts Speedo's evidence that the demand for TYR's suits outpaced its ability to supply the suits, despite its 
apparently strenuous efforts to do so. "
972,16," Speedo was granted summary judgment with respect to Schubert's statement to reporter Craig Lord because that statement 
was not commercial speech or advertising. (Docket No. 154 at 26-28.)  [**47] TYR provides no grounds for reconsidering that 
ruling. The other statements that form the basis of TYR's antitrust disparagement claim were either not alleged to be the basis 
for the Lanham Act claim or were not raised by TYR in opposition to Speedo's prior summary judgment motion. (See Compl.; 
Docket No. 127 at 24-30.) It is too late to amend the Lanham Act claim now, on a motion to reconsider a grant of summary 
judgment. "
973,17," In fact, Schubert claims not to have known about the Tracer Rise at the time, (Supp. Schubert Decl. P 6), though this is 
disputed."
973,18," The testimony of Genadijus Sokolovas and Russell Mark that USA Swimming and Speedo did not do internal ""testing"" on 
swimsuits prior to Schubert's comments, (Sokolovas Depo. at 16:11-25; Mark Depo. at 30:18-31:12), does not rebut Schubert's 
claim to have informally analyzed swim times involving the LZR Racer."
973,19," TYR argues that Schubert's statement is literally false because of the difference between 1.55% and 2%. The Court does not 
think that a statement can reasonably be found to be false because a number is rounded up to an integer according to 
commonly-accepted rules for rounding, the same used in the federal tax code. See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 3402(b)(5) (allowing 
rounding to the nearest dollar for calculating withholding). More precisely, the Court does not think that the difference between 
1.55% and the rounded number of 2% is a material difference. "
974,20," HN24[
] The Lanham Act also requires that the plaintiff prove that the defendant ""caused its false statement to enter 
interstate commerce."" Southland Sod, 108 F.3d at 1139. Given that the two charged statements were given personally at a 
closed meeting in Manchester and to two junior swimmers in Guam, respectively, it is doubtful that TYR could satisfy this 
requirement."
974,21," The Court rejects this new argument because it is not grounds for reconsideration. TYR has not demonstrated that it could not 
have raised this argument--which has nothing to do with the new expert report--on summary judgment. "
975,22," TYR argues that it would be impossible to track ""word-of-mouth"" dissemination. However, the impact and dissemination of the 
statement could potentially be measured by consumer surveys, as recognized by courts in other Lanham Act claims. See, e.g., 
Brunswick Corp. v. Spinit Reel Co., 832 F.2d 513, 525 (10th Cir. 1987) (""Actual consumer confusion  [**56] may be shown by 
direct evidence, a diversion of sales or direct testimony from the public, or by circumstantial evidence such as consumer 
surveys.""). TYR has provided no such evidence. "
988,1," Defendants' brief refers to Section 338(j), which provides for a three year statute of limitations for ""[a]n action to recover for 
physical damage to private property under Section 19 of Article I of the California Constitution."" "
995,2," Defendants cited Gorman as 552 F.3d 1008. However, the opinion at that citation was amended and superseded by the 
opinion reported at 584 F.3d 1147. "
1006,1," Following the parties' lead, the Court analyzes the causes of action under California law. However, the parties are on notice 
that the tort claims at issue in this case present potentially difficult conflict-of-law issues, and they should either stipulate as to 
the applicable law or be prepared to fully litigate the matter. (The contract claims, in contrast, appear to be governed by choice-
of-law clauses: one agreement is governed by California law, the other by Texas law.) "
1007,2," In the Complaint, Wynne Systems tends to view the transaction as a merger, in which Mobile Mini and Mobile Storage Group 
became a single legal entity. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that ""Mobile Storage Group . . . and Mobile Mini merged,"" and 
""[b]y virtue of the merger . . . Mobile Storage Group ceased to exist as an entity."" (Compl. 11.) In the Motion to Dismiss, Defendants characterize the transaction as an acquisition by Mobile Mini of Mobile Storage Group: 
""Mobile Mini acquired Mobile Storage Group, Inc. on June 27, 2008. Through the transaction, Mobile Storage retained its 
individual legal status and became a subsidiary of Mobile Mini."" (Motion to Dismiss at 1.) The Court previously determined for jurisdictional purposes that both Mobile Mini and Mobile Storage are Delaware corporations, 
thus adopting Defendants' characterization of the transaction. However, for purposes of the present Motion, the Court must take 
the factual allegations of the Complaint as true. "
1009,3," It should be noted that the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act does not supersede contract-based causes of action. The Act 
specifically refrains from superseding ""contractual remedies, whether or not based upon misappropriation of a trade secret."" Cal. 
Civ. Code § 3426.7(b)(1). It should also be noted that, while the caselaw tends to characterize the Trade Secrets Act as ""preempting"" other causes of 
action, ""[t]he [California] Supreme Court has criticized the use of 'preempt' to describe the supersession of one state law by 
another."" Silvaco Data Syst., 184 Cal. App. 4th 210, 109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 27, 2010 WL 1713241, at *13 n.14 (quoting Zengen, Inc. 
v. Comerica Bank, 41 Cal.4th 239, 247 n.5, 59 Cal. Rptr. 3d 240, 158 P.3d 800 (2007)). The Court of Appeal has therefore 
stated its preference for the term ""supersede"" rather than ""preempt."" Id."
1009,4," To the extent that Wynne Systems's Unfair Competition claim is premised on the unlawful act of conversion, the Court finds 
that the conversion cause of action is superseded by the trade secret misappropriation cause of action. (See infra.) The unfair 
competition claim is therefore superseded by the Trade Secrets Act to the extent that the unfair competition claim is premised on 
a superseded conversion claim. See, e.g., Gabriel Technologies, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98379, 2009 WL 3326631, at *12-13 
(dismissing conversion and unfair competition causes of action where both were premised on misappropriation of trade secrets). "
1011,5," It should be noted in this respect that, as stated in the Complaint, only Defendant Mobile Storage Group entered into a 
contractual relationship with Plaintiff Wynne Systems. Because Mobile Mini and Wynne did not have a contractual relationship, 
the economic loss rule is entirely inapplicable to Wynne's causes of action against Mobile Mini."
1011,6," Further, the Court has sua sponte identified two other reasons that the Complaint fails to state a viable conversion claim. 
(Because these issues were not raised in the parties' briefings, the Court wishes to emphasize that these theories are not the 
basis for the Court's holding.) To the extent that Wynne Systems seeks to premise its conversion claim on an intangible property 
right to its software aside from its rights under the Trade Secrets Act, Wynne Systems's Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts 
(per Twombly and Iqbal) to show that such an intangible property right exists under the Ninth Circuit's three-part test. See 
Kremen, 337 F.3d at 1030; G.S. Rasmussen, 958 F.2d at 903. Also, even if Wynne Systems had satisfied the governing three-part test for establishing intangible property rights, the 
conversion claim would be preempted by the Copyright Act. See Firoozye v. Earthlink Network, 153 F. Supp. 2d 1115, 1129-30 
(N.D. Cal. 2001) (in dispute involving alleged conversion of computer software, holding that elements of claim for conversion of "
1012,," intangible property under California law are identical to elements of claim for copyright infringement under Federal law, and are 
therefore preempted by the Copyright Act); Meridian Project Syst., Inc. v. Hardin Const. Co., LLC, No. CIV. S-04-2728 FCD 
DAD, 2006 U.S .Dist. LEXIS 34092, 2006 WL 1062070, at *3-4 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2006) (same); see also Doody v. Penguin 
Group (USA) Inc., 673 F. Supp. 2d 1144, 1164-65 (D. Haw. 2009) (collecting cases); Apparel Business Syst., LLC v. Tom James 
Co., No. 06-1092, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26313, 2008 WL 858754, at *18 n.9 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 28, 2008) (""Most courts that have 
addressed the [copyright preemption] question have found such software conversion claims preempted."") (collecting cases). "
1017,1," The article is attached as Exhibit 2 to the certification of Keith J. Miller (""Miller Cert."") in support of defendants' Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure (""FRCP"") 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. [D.E. 6.] The Court may consider documents attached to or specially 
referenced in the second amended complaint, and matters of public record, without converting a motion to dismiss into one for 
summary judgment. See Mele v. Federal Reserve Bank of N.Y., 359 F.3d 251, 255 n.5 (3d Cir. 2004). "
1023,1," That  [*6] the underlying action in this case is a counterclaim rather than an original complaint is not statutorily significant 
because the anti-SLAPP statute explicitly applies to complaints and counter-complaints. See Jarrow Formulas, Inc. v. LaMarche, 
31 Cal. 4th 728, 735 n.2, 3 Cal. Rptr. 3d 636, 74 P.3d 737 (2003); CAL. CIV. PROC. CODE § 425.16(h). "
1025,2," As previously noted, paragraph 9 alleges that as part of DCI's fraudulent scheme, DCI makes it a practice to file a lawsuit 
against any company that complains to DCI about its claims for payment. (Def. Counterclaim P 9.) Paragraph 9 also alleges that 
""DCI has litigated multiple lawsuits with clients in pursuit of gains from its fraudulent business model and practices."" (Id.) "
1026,3," To the extent Urban also seeks attorney's fees pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the  [*16] Court 
DENIES that request because Urban has not shown that it complied with Rule 11's ""safe harbor"" provision. See Winterrowd v. 
Am. Gen. Annuity Ins. Co., 556 F.3d 815, 826 (9th Cir. 2009) (""A Rule 11 motion for sanctions must be served on opposing 
counsel twenty-one days before filing the motion with the court . . . ."" (citations omitted)); FED. R. CIV. P. 11(c)(2). "
1027,4," In its opposition to DCI's Motion to Dismiss, Urban alleges for the first time that the challenged conduct is ""unlawful"" because it 
violates Sections 1709 et seq of the California Civil Code. However, this allegation does not appear anywhere in Urban's 
counterclaim. "
1028,5," To the extent Urban alleges this is a tort claim for breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing, it nonetheless fails because 
Urban cannot point to any ""independent duty"" between the parties. See Freeman & Mills, Inc. v. Belcher Oil Co., 11 Cal. 4th 85, 
102, 44 Cal. Rptr. 2d 420, 900 P.2d 669 (1995) (concluding that, with the exception of insurance contracts, there can be no tort 
recovery for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, ""at least in the absence of violation of 'an independent 
duty arising from principles of tort law'"" (citation omitted)); accord Bionghi, 70 Cal. App. 4th at 1370 (""[T]ort recovery for breach of 
the covenant is available only in limited circumstances, generally involving a special relationship between the contracting parties, 
such as the relationship between an insured and its insurer."" (citation omitted)). "
1034,1," The district court later issued an amended order clarifying that Shell was entitled to injunctive relief only under Section 43(a) of 
the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), to compel LFSS to stop further use of Shell's trademarks, trade dress, and color patterns. 
See The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc. (Shell V), No. 03-1623, slip op. at 1-2 (D.P.R. Dec. 30, 2008) 
(amended judgment); The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc. (Shell IV), 596 F. Supp. 2d. 193, 201-03, 205 
(D.P.R. 2008)  [**4] (opinion and order)."
1034,2," In order to accurately describe the parties' interactions and the events leading up to this suit, all of which occurred before the 
merger, we refer to the plaintiff as ""Shell"" throughout and discuss the significance of the merger where relevant. "
1035,3," Specifically, in addition to the rent specified in the lease, Shell agreed to pay LFSS an additional $ 0.02 per gallon for the first 
480,000 gallons sold, and an additional $ 0.03 per gallon for every gallon over 490,000  [**8] that LFSS sold. "
1037,4," LFSS's argument that the district court could not convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction without an 
evidentiary hearing fails. The district court converted the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction only after issuing a 
show cause order to LFSS, and only after determining that LFSS had not advanced any new evidence or legal arguments 
beyond what it had presented at the preliminary  [**15] injunction hearing. Under those circumstances, an evidentiary hearing 
would have served little purpose, and the district court's conversion was not error. See HMG Prop. Investors, Inc. v. Parque 
Indus. Rio Canas, Inc., 847 F.2d 908, 915 (1st Cir. 1988); cf. United States v. Owens, 54 F.3d 271, 276-77 (6th Cir. 1995)."
1037,5," The parties have not briefed the question of whether this court is, in any event, bound by the bankruptcy court's determination 
that the lease remained in effect and Shell retained all its rights as a lessor under that agreement, though the district court relied 
on that judgment in rejecting LFSS's claims below. See Shell III, slip op. at 3. "
1038,6," It is clear, and LFSS does not contest, that Shell provided adequate written notice of the termination here."
1038,7," The district court's interpretation of the PMPA reflects the law of this circuit: if any of the events listed in § 2802(c) occur, 
""termination is conclusively presumed to be reasonable as a matter of law."" Desfosses v. Wallace Energy, Inc., 836 F.2d 22, 26 
(1st Cir. 1987). At least one other circuit also adopted this rule. See Hinkleman v. Shell Oil Co., 962 F.2d 372, 377 (4th Cir. 
1992) (per curiam). But see Patel v. Sun Co., Inc., 141 F.3d 447, 456-57 (3d Cir. 1998) (""There is no question that at least some 
of the § 2802(c) relevant event exceptions mandate some form of judicial scrutiny.""); Marathon Petroleum Co. v. Pendleton, 889 
F.2d 1509, 1512 (6th Cir. 1989) (suggesting that all terminations for events listed in § 2802(c) are subject to judicial scrutiny to 
determine whether they were objectively reasonable); Sun Refining & Mktg. Co. v. Rago, 741 F.2d 670, 672-74 (3d Cir. 1984) 
(holding that in light of the PMPA's purpose of benefitting franchisees, courts must  [**22] look to whether franchisor terminations 
under § 2802(c)(8) and (9) are objectively reasonable and not presume reasonableness per se). "
1039,8," Specifically, in 2000, before the CAP or the February 2001 rent benefit were implemented, LFSS's net operating income was $ 
33,440, but it loaned more than $ 150,000 to its stockholders during the fiscal year. LFSS also took out substantial loans totaling 
about $ 675,000 before implementing the CAP, and LFSS paid out more than $ 200,000 to its president, the station operator, in 
2000, 2002, and 2003."
1039,9," Specifically, this circuit looks to (1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the similarity of the goods (or, in a service mark case, the services); (3) the relationship 
between the parties' channels of trade; (4) the juxtaposition of their advertising; (5) the classes of prospective purchasers; 
(6) the evidence of actual confusion; (7) the defendant's intent in adopting its allegedly infringing mark; and (8) the strength 
of the plaintiff's mark. Int'l Ass'n of Machinists v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr., 103 F.3d 196, 201 (1st Cir. 1996);  [**24] see also Visible Sys. Corp. v. 
Unisys Corp., 551 F.3d 65, 73 (1st Cir. 2008). "
1040,10," We likewise reject LFSS's argument that Shell lacked standing to assert an injury on its Lanham Act claims because of Shell's 
2006 acquisition and share purchase and its rebranding as Sol Puerto Rico, and specifically because Sol is not the registrant of 
the relevant Shell trademarks. HN7[
] Anyone ""who may suffer adverse consequences from a violation of section 1125(a) has standing to sue regardless of whether he is the registrant of the trademark."" Quabaug Rubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co., Inc., 
567 F.2d 154, 160 (1st Cir. 1977); see also Waldman Publ'g Corp. v. Landoll, Inc., 43 F.3d 775, 784-85 (2d Cir. 1994). Sol, as 
the owner of numerous Shell stations, plainly has an interest in preventing the confusion of the Shell brand with the inferior-
quality fuel that LFSS sold while still displaying some Shell trademarks."
1040,11," Though LFSS broadly asserts that the PMPA does not allow franchisors to obtain injunctive relief against franchisees if the 
relief would give the franchisors property rights, LFSS does not claim that this prevents the district court from ordering LFSS to "
1041,," comply with its post-termination contractual obligations. In any event, we need not decide whether the PMPA allows franchisors 
to obtain injunctions to enforce those kinds of obligations. Shell's complaint also included a claim to judicially dispossess LFSS 
of the service station premises and equipment under Puerto Rican law, and Shell can obtain enforcement of the relevant post-
termination contractual provisions on that basis. Shell did not, however, bring any state law claims that would provide an 
alternate basis for it to obtain an injunctive remedy involving the lease agreement in this suit."
1041,12," In any event, as the district court noted in its opinion granting summary judgment to Shell,  [**33] the outcome would have 
been no different even if it had considered this untimely motion. LFSS's purported evidence that it was in actual competition with "
1042,," other, nearby retailers that it said received better prices from Shell was weak at best, and it failed to show price differentials. See 
Shell II, 551 F. Supp. 2d at 134 n.3."
1042,13," We note that the district court amply explained why, even assuming arguendo that LFSS presented an issue of material fact 
on the question of whether it was in competition with favored retailers, there were no material issues of fact on the other required 
elements of this claim that would preclude Shell from obtaining judgment on the merits. See Shell II, 551 F. Supp. 2d at 134-35. "
1044,1," Also named as a Defendant is the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York (""HIP""), the subsidiary of the HIP Foundation 
that actually provides insurance coverage to consumers. "
1045,2," The motions were technically fully submitted on February 19, 2010, when Defendants submitted their reply memorandum in 
support of their  [*5] motion for summary judgment and in opposition to Plaintiff's motion to amend. On February 25, 2010, 
however, Plaintiff filed a reply in support of its motion to amend, despite the fact that the Court's Order of January 27, 2010, did 
not authorize the filing of such a memorandum. Notwithstanding Plaintiff's failure to seek permission to submit a reply brief, the 
Court has considered it in resolving the pending motions. "
1047,3," Although the Complaint alleges that the Transit Health Program is a member of the relevant product market, it is not addressed 
in the parties' briefing on the instant motion or in their Local Rule 56.1 statements. Accordingly, the Court will not consider the 
Transit Health Program in resolving the pending motions."
1047,4," As a fifth supposed difference, the City indicates that ""the City and the MLC have worked in conjunction with GHI and HIP to 
craft the benefits included in their plans."" (Id.) This is hardly a relevant difference, apart from the fact that it produced the four 
distinguishing factors noted in the text above. "
1048,5," Indeed, it is undisputed that HIP offers an identical HMO plan to purchasers outside of the Health Benefits Program. (See Def.'s 
56.1 P 62.) "
1049,6," The ""upwards pricing pressure"" test ""predicts the likely competitive impact of a proposed merger based on how a merger is 
likely to alter the merged firm's pricing incentives. This analysis can be used in addition to, or instead of, the traditional structural 
approach of defining relevant markets and calculating market shares to determine the likely effect of a merger."" (Decl. of Frank 
R. Lichtenberg P 107.) The Court notes that its research has not revealed a single decision of a federal court adopting this test. 
In light of the case law's clear requirement that a Plaintiff allege a particular product market in which competition will be impaired, 
this absence of authority is hardly surprising. "
1054,1, All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2007-08 version unless otherwise noted. 
1055,2," The County disputes this fact, asserting the Laddusires were aware of the contract when it was created. However, because 
summary judgment was granted to the County, the facts must be construed in E-Z Roll Off's favor. See Kuehl v. Sentry Select 
Ins. Co., 2009 WI App 38, P5, 316 Wis. 2d 506, 765 N.W.2d 860.  [****3] Regardless, the fact is not critical to our decision."
1055,3," WISCONSIN STAT. § 893.80(1)(a) actually uses the word ""claim,"" not ""injury."" The case law, however, recognizes this 
component of the statute as the notice of injury. Vanstone v. Town of Delafield, 191 Wis. 2d 586, 591 n.5, 530 N.W.2d 16 (Ct. 
App. 1995). "
1056,4," In State ex rel. Auchinleck v. Town of LaGrange, 200 Wis. 2d 585, 596, 547 N.W.2d 587 (1996), the court also observed: 
""Further, Wis. Stat. § 893.80(5) expressly states that specific rights and remedies provided by other statutes take precedence 
over the provisions of § 893.80."" This effectively overruled the court's prior holding in DNR v. City of Waukesha, 184 Wis. 2d 
178, 191-93, 515 N.W.2d 888 (1994), where the court had concluded subsec. (5) only applied to subsec. (3)'s damage caps, not 
subsec. (1)'s notice provisions. Id. at 192. "
1057,5," In Town of Burke v. City of Madison, 225 Wis. 2d 615, 625, 593 N.W.2d 822 (Ct. App. 1999), we merely observed that prior 
decisions had focused  [****10] on three factors. In Nesbitt Farms, LLC v. City of Madison, 2003 WI App 122, P9, 265 Wis. 2d 
422, 665 N.W.2d 379, we noted Town of Burke had identified three factors ""which shed light on the question."" Eventually, we 
referred to the three factors as a ""test."" SeeOak Creek Citizen's Action Comm. v. City of Oak Creek, 2007 WI App 196, P7, 
304 Wis. 2d 702, 738 N.W.2d 168."
1057,6," Although titles are not part of statutes, WIS. STAT. § 990.001(6), they may be helpful in interpretation. Aiello v. Village of 
Pleasant Prairie, 206 Wis. 2d 68, 73, 556 N.W.2d 697 (1996). As the issue here is one of statutory interpretation, we recite the 
title to provide context. "
1058,7," The County also asserts the ""actions and proceedings""  [****14] language suggests other remedies, in addition to injunctions, 
are also appropriate in WIS. STAT. ch 133 actions. However, WIS. STAT. § 133.16 and 133.18 specifically provide for the 
recovery of costs, attorney fees, and treble damages. This serves to strengthen, not weaken, the conclusion that there is a 
specific statutory enforcement scheme."
1058,8," In addition to the provisions of WIS. STAT. §§ 133.16 and 133.18 recited in this decision, those sections also specify a statute 
of limitations, tolling provisions, an allowance for treble damages, and state enforcement procedures. Additionally, like WIS. 
STAT. § 30.294, the statute at issue in Gillen v. City of Neenah, 219 Wis. 2d 806, 580 N.W.2d 628 (1998), both sections apply 
only to the specific violations provided for by the chapter in which they are set forth. See WIS. STAT. §§ 133.16, 133.18; Gerol 
v. Arena, 127 Wis. 2d 1, 12, 377 N.W.2d 618 (Ct. App. 1985) ( WIS. STAT. ch. 133 remedies are ""confined to violations under 
ch. 133""). "
1060,9," In both Auchinleck, 200 Wis. 2d at 595-96 and Gillen, 219 Wis. 2d at 822-24, the supreme court observed the conflicting, 
specific statutory schemes had to take precedence over the more general notice statute. Thus, it is unclear whether the third 
factor could outweigh the first two factors in any given case. When first setting forth the three-factor analysis in Burke, 225 Wis. 2d at 625 and nn.3-5, we cited a different case for the 
existence of each factor. For the third factor, we cited City of Waukesha, 184 Wis. 2d 178, 515 N.W.2d 888Recall, however, 
that case was where the supreme court first recognized WIS. STAT. § 893.80(1) applied in all types of cases. Id. at 202. The 
court there did not engage in what is now our three-factor test. To the contrary, it refused to consider a claim that an exception 
existed for WIS. STAT. ch. 144 (1991-92) enforcement actions even though the chapter's enforcement provisions, WIS. STAT. 
§§ 144.98 and 144.99 (1991-92), explicitly provided that all violations of the chapter constituted public nuisances enforceable by 
injunction. Yet, that is precisely what the subsequent  [****22] Gillen decision concluded was sufficient to create an exception, 
there, without consideration of the third Burke factor. See Gillen, 219 Wis. 2d at 821-22, 826-27. The court declined in City of Waukesha, 184 Wis. 2d at 193 n.10, to address whether there should be an exception because, 
although the DNR had requested an injunction, id. at 186, it had not requested immediate relief via a temporary injunction. In 
Gillen, the court abrogated City of Waukesha, explicitly rejecting any requirement that injunctive relief, in any form, even be 
requested to recognize an exception to WIS. STAT. § 893.80(1)'s notice requirements, relying instead on the enforcement 
scheme's provision for injunctive relief. Gillen, 219 Wis. 2d at 826 (per curiam), 834-35 (C.J. Abrahamson, concurring) 
(criticizing the per curiam for failing to acknowledge it was overruling City of Waukesha ). Thus, our reliance on the much 
maligned City of Waukesha decision to recognize a third factor for the ""exceptions test,"" may not have been the best choice. 
Despite our concerns with the third factor, we are obliged to apply it. See Cook v. Cook, 208 Wis. 2d 166, 189-90, 560 N.W.2d 
246 (1997) (court of appeals may not overrule,  [****23] modify, or withdraw language from a prior published opinion). Perhaps 
the issue is ripe for review by our supreme court; it has yet to address our recognition of a three-factor test. "
1061,10," As noted supra, the WIS. STAT. § 893.80(1)(b) notice of claim is not subject to a filing deadline."
1061,11," Thus, we reject the County's bald assertion, lacking citation, that the Gillen court proceeded to examine all three factors. "
1062,12," Because we conclude WIS. STAT. ch. 133 claims are exempt from WIS. STAT. § 893.80(1)'s notice requirements, we need 
not resolve E-Z Roll Off's remaining arguments regarding continuing violations and actual notice with lack of prejudice. See 
State v. Castillo, 213 Wis. 2d 488, 492, 570 N.W.2d 44 (1997) (cases should be  [****28] decided on the narrowest possible 
grounds). "
1067,1," All facts recited in this opinion are drawn from Plaintiff's complaint, which are assumed to be true for the purposes of a motion 
to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). "
1072,2," ISPI also cites three criminal bid rigging cases in support of the same point; they add nothing to the argument. See United 
States v. Koppers Co., 652 F.2d 290 (2d Cir. 1981) (affirming criminal conviction based on explicit agreement between the only 
two competitors in the road tar business to allocate territory and pre-determine bid prices, thereby rigging bids for state 
contracts); United States v. Portsmouth Paving Corp., 694 F.2d 312 (4th Cir. 1982) (affirming criminal conviction for bid rigging 
where evidence at trial included testimony that competitors held periodic in-person meetings where they explicitly agreed to "
1073,," allocate contracts and not to submit competitive bids); United States v. Flom, 558 F.2d 1179 (5th Cir. 1977) (finding trial 
 [**24] errors and remanding for new trial convictions based on periodic meetings where competitors explicitly divided and 
allocated upcoming contracts for steel re-bars)."
1073,3," The same analysis under Twombly and Starr may apply  [**27] to the allegations of an ""agreement"" to terminate ISPI between 
Honeywell and other NOTIFIER distributors, i.e. the vertical restraint discussed in part III.A.1, supra. Because, even assuming 
that ISPI has sufficiently alleged a vertical ""agreement,"" the allegations of a vertical conspiracy are insufficient to state a claim 
under the rule of reason (infra, part III.B), the issue of whether ISPI's allegations of a vertical agreement fulfill Twombly's 
pleading requirements is not dispositive of the instant motion. The Court merely notes that allegations that Honeywell ""'warned' 
ISPI that it should not compete for the business of clients previously served by other incumbent NOTIFIER distributors"" (Compl. 
P 19), and allegations that Honeywell terminated ISPI's distributorship ""[p]ursuant and in response to the other NOTIFIER 
distributors' requests, demands and/or threats"" (Id. P 25) do not necessarily place Honeywell's conduct ""in a context that raises 
a suggestion of a preceding agreement."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557; Starr, 592 F.3d at 323. Therefore, ISPI's allegations of a 
pre-existing ""agreement"" between Honeywell and other NOTIFIER distributors, as currently pled, may be conclusory. "
1081,*," Honorable W. Harold Albritton, United States District Judge for the Middle District of Alabama, sitting by designation. "
1082,1," The Council on Dental Benefit Programs created an educational manual to include the Code on Dental Procedures and 
Nomenclature (""the Code""). Current Dental Terminology, Fifth Edition (""CDT"") contains recent revisions to the Code. The Code, 
which is designed as the national standard for reporting dental services by the Federal Government under the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (""HIPAA""), is currently recognized by third-party payers, including Defendants, 
nationwide. An underlying purpose of the Code is to provide a uniform language that accurately describes the dental, surgical 
and diagnostic services a dental service provider has rendered, thereby giving Defendants or their designated payers  [**4] the 
information they need to process a claim for payment. To claim reimbursement for dental services, dental health care providers 
complete a standardized form incorporating a CDT coding system through which procedures are identified by standardized 
designations. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants utilized automated programs to manipulate procedure codes on submitted claim 
forms and thereby reduce the amount paid for dental services. According to Plaintiffs' complaint, ""downcoding"" reduces or 
denies payment of claims submitted by dental providers by changing the CDT code assigned to a particular service to a less 
expensive CDT code. D.E. 111, at P 40. ""Bundling"" reduces or denies payment of claims by combining the CDT codes of two or 
more appropriately performed and billed procedures into one CDT code. Id. at P 41."
1082,2," The Managed Care MDL was originally limited to claims brought by medical doctors against Humana, Inc., a nationwide 
managed care organization, and other ""major HMOs,"" see Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241, 1249-50 (11th Cir. 2004), but 
grew to include many disputes between healthcare providers of all kinds (e.g., chiropractors, obstetricians and gynecologists, 
and dentists) and managed care companies who use computer software programs to process claims. Providers have, among 
other things, claimed RICO violations, alleging that managed care entities, acting individually and as part of a conspiracy, 
developed  [**6] and used certain claims processing, claims payment and/or other practices in order to ""deny, delay, and "
1083,," diminish"" payments allegedly owed. See id. at 1247 & n.1. Among the complained-of practices are ""downcoding"" and ""bundling."" 
See id. at 1248. "
1087,3," As somewhat of a last resort, Plaintiffs also argue that the district court did not dismiss their substantive RICO claim on the 
basis that the allegations were insufficiently particularized under Rule 9(b), but that its dismissal was solely grounded on what it 
held to be a lack of plausibility under Twombly. We disagree because the district court referenced Rule 9(b) in the section of its 
order specifically discussing the section 1962(c) claim. See In re Managed Care Litig., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18731, 2009 WL 
347795, at *3. But even if the district court did not apply the proper standard to the substantive RICO claim, we need not resolve 
that issue if there is another basis for affirming its judgment, because HN14[
] ""we may affirm its judgment 'on any ground that 
finds support in the record.'"" Lucas v. W.W. Grainger, Inc., 257 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2001) (quoting Jaffke v. Dunham, 352 
U.S. 280, 281, 77 S. Ct. 307, 308, 1 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1957)).  [**25] The district court's dismissal of the substantive RICO claim is 
still due to be affirmed because Plaintiffs have not pleaded the claim with sufficient particularity under Rule 9(b). "
1088,4," We are not convinced that Plaintiffs actually allege parallel conduct with regard to their allegation that Defendants used the 
same downcoding and bundling methods, because there is no indication from the complaint that Defendants used the same 
software to downcode and bundle procedures in the same way over an extended period of time. See D.E. 111, at P 42 (""To 
accomplish this downcoding and bundling, Defendants used services and software such as those sold and licensed by Dentistat 
Inc. ('Dentistat') and McKesson Corporation ('McKesson'), such as ClaimsCheck Dental, CodeReview, and AutoCoder, or 
comparable software, which, among other things, are capable of modifying code protocols."") (emphases added); D.E. 111, at P 
46 (""Through the use of Dentacom, Proclaim and other systems, Defendant Cigna aggressively reduces the payment of claims 
by systematically downcoding, bundling and pending provider claims for payment."") (emphasis added)."
1088,5," The Court acknowledged that certain examples of a parallel conduct might  [**30] be sufficient to imply a conspiracy, such as 
""parallel behavior that would probably not result from chance, coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli, or mere 
interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the parties."" 550 U.S. at 557 n.4, 127 S. Ct. at 1966 n.4 (quoting 
6 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 1425, pp. 167-85 (2d ed. 2003)). The conduct alleged here does not fall into any 
of these categories. "
1089,6," We recognize that many of our sister circuits have held that if a plaintiff fails to state a claim of a primary RICO violation, then 
the plaintiff's civil RICO conspiracy claim necessarily fails. See GE Invest. Private Placement Partners II v. Parker, 247 F.3d 543, 
551 n.2 (4th Cir. 2001); Efron v. Embassy Suites, P.R., Inc., 223 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir. 2000); Discon, Inc. v. NYNEX Corp., 93 
F.3d 1055, 1064 (2d Cir. 1996),  [**34] vacated on other grounds, 525 U.S. 128, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998); 
Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1191 (3rd Cir. 1993); Religious Tech. Ctr. v. Wollersheim, 971 F.2d 364, 367 
n.8 (9th Cir. 1992); Danielsen v. Burnside-Ott Aviation Training Ctr., Inc., 941 F.2d 1220, 1232, 291 U.S. App. D.C. 303 (D.C. 
Cir. 1991); Craighead v. E.F. Hutton & Co., 899 F.2d 485, 495 (6th Cir. 1990); In re Edwards, 872 F.2d 347, 352 (10th Cir. 
1989). This court has not expressly stated such a rule. In Jackson v. Bellsouth Telecomms., 372 F.3d 1250 (11th Cir. 2004), we 
affirmed the dismissal of a RICO conspiracy claim because the complaint failed to allege a substantive RICO claim, but we 
emphasized that ""the RICO conspiracy [claim] add[ed] nothing"" because it ""simply conclude[d] that the defendants 'conspired 
and confederated' to commit conduct which in itself does not constitute a RICO violation."" Id. at 1269. In an unpublished opinion, 
we characterized our holding in Jackson as follows: ""where a plaintiff fails to state a RICO claim and the conspiracy count does 
not contain additional allegations, the conspiracy claim necessarily fails."" Rogers v. Nacchio, 241 F. App'x 602, 609 (11th Cir. 
2007) (citing Jackson, 372 F.3d at 1269)  [**35] (emphasis added). Unlike in Jackson, Plaintiffs' conspiracy count contains 
additional allegations, separate from the allegations in the substantive RICO count. Accordingly, there appears to be no 
controlling authority in our circuit or in the Supreme Court instructing us to adopt the reasoning of our sister circuits and dismiss "
1090,," Plaintiffs' conspiracy claim because the substantive RICO claim was deficiently alleged. See also Beck v. Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 
506 n.10, 120 S. Ct. 1608, 1616 n.10, 146 L. Ed. 2d 561 (2000) (expressly declining to resolve whether a plaintiff suing under 
section 1964(c) for a RICO conspiracy must allege an actionable violation under section 1962(a)-(c)). Because Plaintiffs' 
conspiracy count fails to state a claim under Twombly and Iqbal's plausibility standard, we find it unnecessary to decide in this 
case whether Plaintiffs' conspiracy claim must also fail because of the deficiencies in the substantive RICO count."
1090,7," The only argument Plaintiffs make with respect to the claim for aiding and abetting RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 2 (Count 
II) is in a footnote, which states that their arguments apply with equal force to that claim. Plaintiffs do not offer any argument with 
respect to their claim for declaratory relief for RICO violations (Count IV). We conclude that the district court properly dismissed 
these claims for the same reasons that it dismissed the section 1962(c) and section 1962(d) claims. Additionally, Plaintiffs raise 
several other arguments on appeal with respect to the district court's order dismissing their complaint. For example, Plaintiffs 
assert that the district court erroneously found Twombly to have created a  [**37] heightened pleading standard and wrongly 
compared their RICO allegations to those in the Solomon and Genord cases that the court had earlier dismissed for failure to 
state a claim. Because we hold that the Second Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for relief under the plausibility pleading 
standard articulated by the Supreme Court in Twombly and Iqbal, we conclude that these contentions are meritless. "
1094,1," The Diamond Development Companies — Diamond Development Company N.V. (""Diamdel N.V.""), Diamond Development 
Company S.A. (""Diamdel S.A.""), and Diamond Development Company Ltd. (""Diamdel Ltd."") — joined in Jurisdictional 
Defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) and Rule 12(b)(5). In the January 23 Order, the Court granted the 
motion to dismiss with respect to Diamdel Ltd., holding that the Plaintiffs had not made out a prima facie case of personal 
jurisdiction over  [*10] Diamdel Ltd., or even a sufficient start towards a prima facie showing, pursuant to any of the four 
jurisdictional theories proposed. Plaintiff alleged that Diamdel N.V. and Diamdel S.A. were alternate names for a company in Antwerp, Belgium that sold 
diamonds to W.B. David. Defendants claimed that a company named Diamdel S.A. did not exist. Plaintiff stated in a letter to the 
Court that she did not object to dismissing Diamdel S.A. from the action, based on Defendants' representation that Diamdel N.V. 
was the correct party. In an order issued on February 24, 2009, the Court dismissed the action against Diamdel S.A. without 
prejudice. In the SAC, Plaintiff has dropped Diamdel N.V. as a defendant. In a proposed order attached to the SAC, Plaintiff states that its 
claims against Diamdel N.V. are moot due to the settlement in Sullivan v. DB Investments. Inc., 04-2819 (SRC) (D.N.J.), a class 
action filed against various De Beers entities, including some of Defendants. Plaintiff seeks to voluntarily dismiss the action 
against Diamdel N.V., without prejudice to refile if the Sullivan class action settlement is not finalized. Defendants do not oppose 
the dismissal. The Court grants Plaintiffs  [*11] request. The Court notes, however, that Plaintiff can reassert against Diamdel 
N.V. only claims that accrued on or after the date on which the Amended Complaint was filed, see Part III.D, infra. "
1095,2," Because Diamond Trading has not contested jurisdiction, the Court has not determined the specific jurisdiction pursuant to 
which it can exercise jurisdiction over the company.  [*13] In other words, the Court has not determined that it has jurisdiction 
over Diamond Trading pursuant to Section 301. The parties contest whether Diamond Trading has sufficient contacts with New 
York to satisfy Section 301. The Court finds that Diamond Trading is not an agent or department of Jurisdictional Defendants, 
and thus does not address whether jurisdiction over Diamond Trading arises under Section 301."
1095,3," The Court also granted jurisdictional discovery to determine whether CSOV was an agent or department of Jurisdictional 
Defendants. Jurisdictional Defendants argue that discovery did not reveal any evidence showing that CSOV is an agent or 
department of Jurisdictional Defendants. Plaintiff does not contest this claim. The Court agrees with Jurisdictional Defendants. 
There is no evidence on the record supporting the theory that CSOV is an agent or department of Jurisdictional Defendants, and 
thus the Court does not have jurisdiction over Jurisdictional Defendants based on CSOV's activities. "
1098,4," Courts  [*26] have applied the department test outside of the classic parent-subsidiary relationship. Volkswagenwerk 
Aktiengesellschaft v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 751 F.2d 117, 120 (2d Cir. 1984). When discussing the test, however, the majority of 
courts focus on the parent-subsidiary relationship, and, for ease of reference, this Court will do the same. In its analysis, 
however, the Court applies the test to Centenary and Consolidated, Diamond Trading's sister companies."
1098,5," In its January 2009 Order addressing personal jurisdiction, the Court found that Plaintiff had not alleged sufficient facts to make 
jurisdictional discovery appropriate as to former Defendant Diamdel Ltd., in part because Plaintiff had not alleged that Diamdel 
Ltd. had an ownership interest in CSOV or Diamond Trading. The Court realizes that this statement does not accurately reflect 
the law: the common ownership prong of the department test can be satisfied in cases involving sister companies or affiliates, if 
the ownership interests in the companies are nearly identical. The Court also stated, however, that Plaintiffs allegations against 
Diamdel Ltd. were flawed because Plaintiff had named three Diamdel companies in the AC, and stated that she was not certain 
which of the three was the appropriate defendant. Plaintiff has since identified Diamdel N.V., and not Diamdel Ltd., as the 
appropriate defendant. "
1101,6," In its January 2009 Order granting jurisdictional discovery, the Court stated that Plaintiff had made sufficient allegations 
 [*36] to justify jurisdictional discovery pursuant only to the agency and department theories of Section 301, but that discovery 
could reveal that jurisdiction is appropriate pursuant to other legal theories as well. Tese-Milner, 613 F. Supp. 2d at 419 n. 10. 
Jurisdictional Defendants argue that discovery has not produced any evidence to support other theories of jurisdiction. Plaintiff 
does not contest this statement, or argue that the Court has jurisdiction pursuant to another provision. The Court thus holds that 
Plaintiff has not made a prima facie showing of facts establishing jurisdiction pursuant to Section 301 or any other jurisdictional 
provision, including N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(2), and Section 12 of the Clayton Act. "
1102,7," The Court includes allegations regarding Jurisdictional Defendants, who are no longer part of the case, because they relate to 
the claims against Diamond Trading and CSOV "
1105,8," The Court explained that Section 1 is intended to prevent two independent sources of economic power from joining together to 
take unified action that has anticompetitive effects. Copperweld Corp., 467 U.S. at 769. A parent and its wholly-owned subsidiary 
are not separate economic actors pursuing separate interests, but rather a unified entity with a single ""corporate consciousness."" 
Id. at 769-70. Accordingly, concerted action by such entities does not give rise to the anticompetitive dangers targeted by 
Section 1. Id. "
1107,9," The SAC does include some allegations that reference potential relevant markets, including allegations that De Beers: (1) 
controls sixty percent of the world's rough diamonds; (2) maintains a ""world-wide monopoly;"" and (3) exercises control over two-
thirds of the world's supply of diamonds and over seventy-five percent of diamonds imported into the United States. The Court 
could construe these allegations as alleging that the relevant market is the worldwide market for rough diamonds or the market 
for rough diamonds imported into the U.S. The Court, however, will not interpret the SAC as containing allegations that Plaintiff 
has explicitly disavowed. "

references a recent opinion by Chief Judge Sleet of this court. See In re Metoprolol Succinate Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 
Civ. Nos. 06-52 & 06-71, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36303, 2010 WL 1485328 (D.Del. April 13, 2010)."

1116,7," The court cites the amended complaint in the current action for these facts, which do not differ from those recited in its 
Braintree/Schwarz litigation opinion. "

any other person, $ 1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the 
court."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
1119,10," As Braintree did not prosecute the '183 patent, plaintiffs do not claim that Braintree committed a fraud on the PTO."
1119,11," Although the allegation is written broadly to encompass other litigation, the complaint identifies only the Braintree/Schwarz 
litigation as the basis for plaintiffs' claim. HN8[
] ""A single lawsuit can violate antitrust law as long as it is both an objective and subjective sham."" See In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 585 F.3d 677, 686 (2d Cir. 2009). Notwithstanding, as 
discussed in the following section, plaintiffs have alleged an overall scheme comprising more than the filing of the 
Braintree/Schwarz litigation. "
1121,12," The contents of the letter to Halow, i.e., Braintree's grounds for its statement that the '183 patent was invalid, are not specified 
in the amended complaint. "
1122,13," This is likely the reason Braintree specifically avoids framing its argument as one of issue preclusion or collateral estoppel, 
notwithstanding its urging the court to apply preclusively the prior holding in a manner consistent with the doctrine."
1122,14," Although it need not consider the Orange Book listing component of the asserted scheme independently for purposes of 
deciding the present motion, the court notes its agreement with the caselaw holding that ""improper listing"" in the  [**31] FDA's 
Orange Book is not an act of petitioning for Noerr-Pennington purposes, under the rationale iterated in In re Buspirone Patent 
Litigation, 185 F. Supp. 2d 363 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Braintree's motion would be alternatively denied on this ground. "
1128,1," For a more complete recitation of the facts and procedural history of this case, the reader is directed to the Court's decision 
dated May 31, 2007. See AstraZeneca AB, et al. v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 490 F. Supp. 2d 381 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). "
1131,2," Because the Court does not find that the infringement action was objectively meritless, the Court need not examine Astra's 
subjective motivation in bringing the suit. See Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 508 U.S. 49, 
60, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993). "
1133,3," The Court also rejects Mylan's argument that dismissal of its antitrust counterclaims at this stage is not warranted because the 
counterclaims raise issues of fact requiring discovery--e.g., evidence of Astra's knowledge and motivations, policies and 
strategies related to its litigation efforts. Such evidence plainly goes to the subjective intent prong under PRE and, as discussed 
in footnote 2, supra, it is irrelevant  [*25] because the Court concludes that Astra's infringement action against Mylan was not 
objectively baseless. Moreover, as is clear from the Court's dismissal of Mylan's antitrust counterclaims, Mylan has failed to 
cross the ""threshold of plausibility"" on its counterclaims to justify discovery. See Asahi Glass Co. v. Pentech Pharms., Inc., 289 
F. Supp. 2d 986, 995 (N.D. I11. 2003) (Posner, J. ) (""[T]o avoid turning every patent case into an antitrust case, some threshold 
of plausibility must be crossed at the outset before a patent antitrust case should be permitted to go into its inevitably costly and 
protracted discovery phase…. [A]n infringement suit must be adjudged to be objectively baseless before it can be considered an 
unlawful method of competition; that is, the determination of whether such a suit is a sham depends not on what the patentee 
believes but on the nature of and the underlying merits of the patentee's case."") (emphasis added and internal quotation marks 
omitted). "

1154,2," If Congress prohibited independent action that merely restrains trade (even if it does not threaten monopolization), that 
prohibition could deter perfectly competitive conduct by firms that are fearful of litigation costs and judicial error. See 
Copperweld, 467 U.S., at 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (“Judging unilateral conduct in this manner reduces the risk 
that the antitrust laws will dampen the competitive zeal of a single aggressive entrepreneur”); cf. United States v. United States

shunned by businessmen who chose to be excessively cautious in the face of uncertainty”). Moreover, if every unilateral action 
that restrained trade were subject to  [****15] antitrust scrutiny, then courts would be forced to judge almost every internal 
business decision. See 7 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P1464c, p. 206 (2d ed. 2003) (hereinafter Areeda &

in our cases about whether a company and its agent are capable of conspiring under § 1. See, e.g., Simpson v. Union Oil Co. of 
Cal., 377 U.S. 13, 20-21, 84 S. Ct. 1051, 12 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1964); see also E. Elhauge & D. Geradin,  [****21] Global Antitrust 
Law and Economics 787-788, and n. 7 (2007) (hereinafter Elhauge & Geradin) (explaining the functional difference between 
Simpson and United States v. General Elec. Co., 272 U.S. 476, 47 S. Ct. 192, 71 L. Ed. 362 (1926), in which we treated a 
similar agreement as beyond the reach of § 1). "
1158,6," As discussed infra, necessity of cooperation is a factor relevant to whether the agreement is subject to the Rule of Reason. See 
NCAA, 468 U.S. 85, 101, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984) (holding that NCAA restrictions on televising college football 
games are subject  [****29] to Rule of Reason analysis for the “critical” reason that “horizontal restraints on competition are 
essential if the product is to be available at all”)."
1158,7," In any event, it simply is not apparent that the alleged conduct was necessary at all. Although two teams are needed to play a 
football game, not all aspects of elaborate interleague cooperation are necessary to produce a game. Moreover, even if 
leaguewide agreements are necessary to produce football, it does not follow that concerted activity in marketing intellectual 
property is necessary to produce football. The Court of Appeals carved out a zone of antitrust immunity for conduct arguably related to league operations by reasoning that 
coordinated team trademark sales are necessary to produce “NFL football,” a single NFL brand that competes against other 
forms of entertainment. But defining the product as “NFL football” puts the cart before the horse: Of course the NFL produces 
NFL football; but that does not mean that cooperation amongst NFL teams is immune from § 1 scrutiny. Members of any cartel 
could insist that their cooperation is necessary to produce the “cartel product” and compete with other products. "
1159,8," See Areeda & Hovenkamp P1471; Elhauge & Geradin 786-787, and n. 6; see also Capital Imaging Assocs., P.C. v. Mohawk 
Valley Medical Assocs., Inc., 996 F.2d 537, 544 (CA2 1993); Bolt v. Halifax Hospital Medical Center, 891 F.2d 810, 819 (CA11 
1990); Oksanen v. Page Memorial Hospital, 945 F.2d 696, 706 (CA4 1991); Motive Parts Warehouse v. Facet Enterprises, 774

Hospital, 745 F.2d 786, 828 (CA3 1984)."
1159,9," For the purposes of resolving this case, there is no need to pass upon the Government's position that entities are incapable of 
conspiring under § 1 if they “have effectively merged the relevant aspect of their operations,  [****34] thereby eliminating actual 
and potential competition . . . in that operational sphere” and “the challenged restraint [does] not significantly affect actual or 
potential competition . . . outside their merged operations.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17. The Government urges 
that the choices “to offer only a blanket license” and “to have only a single headwear licensee” might not constitute concerted 
action under its test. Id., at 32. However, because the teams still own their own trademarks and are free to market those 
trademarks as they see fit, even those two choices were agreements amongst potential competitors and would constitute 
concerted action under the Government's own standard. At any point, the teams could decide to license their own trademarks. It 
is significant, moreover, that the teams here control NFLP. The two choices that the Government might treat as independent 
action, although nominally made by NFLP, are for all functional purposes choices made by the 32 entities with potentially 
competing interests. "
1160,10," Justice Brandeis provided the classic formulation of the Rule of Reason in Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 
U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918): LEdHN[17][
] [17] “HN17[
]  The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and 
perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that 
question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before 
and after the restraint is imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable. The history of the restraint, the evil 
believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts. 
This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of 
intent  [****37] may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences.” See also Leegin Creative Leather Products, 
Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 885-887, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007); National Soc. of Professional Engineers, 
435 U.S., at 688-691, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637. "
1163,1," Colonial does not state whether PPAG has such a ""non-exclusive contract,"" or any contract, with the CDCR, but does allege 
that PPAG ""services a small number of inmates at the San Joaquin Community Hospital in Bakersfield."" (See FAC P 10.)"
1163,2," The FAC includes no allegations setting forth who provides medical care to persons incarcerated in facilities other than those 
operated by the CDCR or by private corporations operating federal prisons."
1163,3," Additionally, Colonial alleges that the CDCR, in connection with ""the latest proposed contract between the parties,"" has 
""requested a term that Colonial admit CDCR patients only to Mercy Hospital."" (See id.) Colonial does not allege whether it has 
agreed or disagreed to such additional term, but alleges that it has ""not finalized any new contract"" with the CDCR ""[g]iven the 
financial crisis which has engulfed the state of California."" (See id.) "
1164,4," Colonial does not specify the procedure employed when the CDCR determines that an inmate needs care, determines that 
Colonial should provide the care, and transports the inmate to a facility other than Mercy Hospital. Nor does Colonial describe 
the procedure employed when an inmate treated at Mercy Hospital is not admitted to the hospital through the Emergency Room. "
1166,5," Although Tampa Electric involved a claim under § 3 of the Clayton Act, the Ninth Circuit has held that the analysis set forth 
therein is applicable to a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act, with the exception that  [*16] the plaintiff alleging a § 1 claim must 
make a ""greater showing of anti-competitive effect."" See Twin City Sportservice, Inc. v. Charles O. Finley & Co., 512 F.2d 1264, 
1275 (9th Cir. 1975). "
1167,6," It would appear that ""guarded facilities,"" when read in context, is a reference to Mercy Hospital's ""dedicated, secured and 
guarded floor."" (See FAC P 24.)"
1167,7," As defendants note, the FAC alleges that the services rendered by medical providers can be rendered in any hospital room 
with a locking window, if an armed guard can be placed outside the room, (see FAC P 9), a description that would appear to 
describe rooms in every hospital facility. Indeed, the  [*18] FAC expressly alleges that medical services to incarcerated persons 
are rendered in facilities other than Mercy Hospital, specifically, in Memorial Hospital and San Joaquin Community Hospital, as 
well as in facilities, unnamed in the FAC, at which physicians provide medical care to federal prisoners incarcerated at 
institutions operated by private corporations. (See FAC PP 6, 10, 11.)"
1167,8, Colonial does not allege that Mercy Hospital has violated § 2. 
1168,9," As discussed above, however, Colonial has failed to allege sufficient facts to support a finding there exists a market limited 
solely to the ""provision of medical services to prison inmates at secure or guarded hospital facilities."" "

1995) (citing Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. & Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965))."
1172,2," Because AIBT's counterclaims for invalidity, non-infringement and non-enforceability had been dismissed by the District Court 
prior to this court's issuance of its 2009 R&R, this court addressed only the remaining five antitrust counterclaims in its decision. "
1173,3," Varian does not dispute AIBT's contention that this court retains jurisdiction to decide its motion, or that since Varian's claims 
were dismissed due to the covenant not to sue, AIBT is the ""prevailing party"" for purposes of its request for attorney fees 
pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 285. Instead, Varian argues that AIBT's request for attorney fees should be denied because the 
defendant has not established that this is an exceptional case justifying an award of such fees. (See Pls. Opp. (Docket No. 78) 
at 8-11)."
1173,4," ""Federal Circuit case-law [applies] to the § 285 analysis, as it is unique to patent law."" Digeo, Inc., 505 F.3d at 1366. "
1174,5," This court is not ruling that ""AIBT must prove its fraud claim to prevail on its motion under § 285[.]"" (Def. Reply Mem. at 3) 
(arguing that proof of fraud is not required). This court agrees that ""[i]f there is clear and convincing evidence that a plaintiff has 
brought a baseless or frivolous suit against an accused infringer, that is a sufficient basis to require a district court to deem the 
case  [*15] exceptional under § 285."" Digeo, Inc., 505 F.3d at 1367. However, since AIBT is basing its claim that this case is 
exceptional on the existence of these two letters, which AIBT contends establish knowledge of the fraud, the fact that these two 
letters do not even state a claim for fraud on the PTO defeats AIBT's claim of exceptional circumstances. "

restraint. 475 U.S. at 266-70. "
1185,3," See Gen. Hosps. Of Humana, Inc. v. Baptist Med. Sys., Inc., No. LR-C-84-455, 1986 WL 935 (E.D. Ark. Feb. 12, 1986) 
(holding that private health care providers proceeding under CON licenses are immune from anti-trust liability under the state 
action doctrine); Trident Neuro-Imaging Lab. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., No. 81-1639-1, 1982 WL 1955, at *6

] ""The Congress shall have Power. . . To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes."" U.S. Const. art. I, § 8. "
1187,5," The Supreme Court frequently has held that Congress did not state its intent to relieve a state action from the limits of the 
Commerce Clause sufficiently explicitly. See, e.g., South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82, 90, 104 S. Ct. 
2237, 81 L. Ed. 2d 71 (1984) (holding that a Congressional policy allowing vertical integration of logging on federal lands does 
not indicate that a similar  [**24] policy is permissible on State lands); New England Power Co. v. New Hampshire, 455 U.S. 
331, 102 S. Ct. 1096, 71 L. Ed. 2d 188 (1982) (holding that the Federal Power Act did not evince an intent to permit States to 
prohibit export of hydroelectric power out of state); Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U.S. 941, 959-60, 102 S. Ct. 
3456, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1254 (1982) (reasoning that Congressional deference to States on water law does not indicate that Congress 
did not intend for the Commerce Clause to apply to State water regulations). HN11[
] But Congress must authorize only the specific action, not the consequences of that action, in order to exempt it from liability under the dormant Commerce Clause. If the explicitly-authorized action has consequences that burden interstate 
commerce, it is immune from a dormant Commerce Clause challenge. See Ne. Bancorp., 472 U.S. at 174-75. "
1188,6," Defendants also move to dismiss YVMH's ""privileges and immunities"" claim. However, as YVMH makes clear in its response, 
that is not a separate claim, but simply a rephrasing of its claim for attorney's fees and costs under the dormant Commerce 
Clause through 42 U.S.C. § 1983. As discussed above, the Court dismisses that claim, so further treatment of the so-called 
privileges and immunities claim is unnecessary. "
1191,1," Pursuant to stipulation, the Court extended the time for Mr. Stathers to answer ICD's complaint. (Docket No. 33.)"
1191,2," Dreyer's requests judicial notice of filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with the Delaware Secretary of 
State. Because the facts contained in these filings  [*3] are ""capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources 
whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,"" the Court grants Dreyer's request. Fed. R. Evid. 201. "
1193,3," ICD  [*10] makes a broad allegation that Dreyer's communicated by telephone, U.S. mail and the Internet to further its alleged 
fraudulent scheme. 1AC P 76. However, this does not satisfy the specificity required for RICO claims."
1193,4," Furthermore, the alleged enterprise did not exist at that time. Although ICD avers that Mr. Stathers was part of the enterprise, it 
alleges that he became associated with Dreyer's in January, 2006."
1193,5," ICD does not appear to consider these statements false and misleading. As discussed  [*12] in greater detail below, ICD 
argues that only one of the statements made in 2007 was false and misleading. See Opp'n at 13. "
1194,6," An enterprise ""includes any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of 
individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4)."
1194,7," Notably, ICD does not plead how Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Holdings, Inc. participated in the enterprise. "
1195,8," In its complaint, ICD identifies Mr. Stathers as part of a group of persons that ""also conspired to force ICD into improper tying 
arrangements and exclusivity arrangements."" 1AC P 23. However, ICD does not plead facts to suggest that Mr. Stathers 
associated with Dreyer's prior to his  [*20] employment in January, 2006. Thus, as alleged, Mr. Stathers did not ""conspire"" with 
Dreyer's until he was a Dreyer's employee. "
1196,9," ICD cites Klor's v. Broadway-Hale Stores, 359 U.S. 207, 79 S. Ct. 705, 3 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1959), which does not support its 
position. Klor's involved allegations of a group boycott, whereby various manufacturers, distributors and a retailer conspired 
""either not to sell to Klor's or to sell to it only at discriminatory prices and highly unfavorable terms."" 359 U.S. at 209. Here, ICD 
does not plead that Dreyer's and the regional ice cream distributors conspired to engage in a group boycott against ICD. "
1197,10," In its complaint, ICD states that the alleged violations of these statutes constituted ""unfair"" business practices. 1AC P 112. 
However, because ICD states in its opposition that its UCL claim is based on ""violations of . . . 'borrowed' laws,"" the Court 
understands ICD to plead the unlawful prong of the UCL. Opp'n at 15. Pleading the ""unfair"" prong of the UCL requires a plaintiff 
to plead ""conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws 
because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms 
competition."" Cel-Tech Commun's v. L.A. Cellular Telephone Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 187, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 
(1999). As noted above, ICD fails to allege harm to competition."
1197,11," Dreyer's maintains that ICD fails to allege facts supporting such unlawful conduct by each Dreyer's entity. However, ICD 
pleads that the Dreyer's entities committed these unlawful acts through their employees. Assuming they are agents of Dreyer's, 
the employees' actions can be imputed on to their employer. "
1198,12," The Court understands ICD to bring its false advertising claim under the UCL. Thus, it need not address Dreyer's arguments 
concerning the application of California Code of Civil Procedure section 338 to this case."
1198,13," In its complaint, ICD provides conclusory statements that its ""remedy  [*30] at law is inadequate"" and that it requires 
""restitution and disgorgement of all unjust profits."" 1AC P 117; 1AC at 22. "
1202,1," The term ""material disclosures"" means ""the required disclosures of the annual percentage rate, the finance charge, the amount 
financed, the total of payments, the payment schedule, and the disclosures and limitations referred to in §§ 226.32(c) and (d) 
and 226.35(b)(2)."" 12 C.F.R. § 226.23(a)(3) n.48. "
1205,2," The remainder of the Complaint is not helpful in discerning the precise scope of Plaintiff's UCL claim. For example, the 
Complaint alleges in conclusory manner that: (1) Defendants claimed to maintain underwriting guidelines that assessed the 
ability of the borrower to repay the debt;  [*18] (2) they purposefully relaxed those guidelines and sold risky loan products to 
other borrowers like Plaintiff; (3) Defendants failed to clearly and conspicuously disclose the key provisions of the loans, even 
though they were very complicated; (4) Defendants provided undisclosed incentives to their agents and officers for marketing 
and selling these risky loans; and (5) Defendants misrepresented the true terms of the loans. (See generally Compl. PP 14-42.) 
However, none of these allegations provide any specific allegations as to who on behalf of Defendants made these 
representations, how Defendants misrepresented the terms of the loans, or why the statements were false or misleading. See 
Vess, 317 F.3d at 1106 (""Averments of fraud must be accompanied by 'the who, what, when, where, and how' of the misconduct 
charged."" (citation omitted)); Misc. Serv. Workers, 661 F.2d at 782 (noting that ""the pleader must state the time, place and 
specific content of the false representations as well as the identities of the parties to the misrepresentation"" (citations omitted)). "
1207,3," To the extent Plaintiff cites Cal. Civ. Code § 17200 in his predatory lending claim, that allegation is duplicative of the fourth 
cause of action for violation of the UCL. "
1215,1," We note that what matters here is actual coercion in the form of conditioning. Insight's promotion of its own products, even if 
vigorous and at the expense of promotion of CableCARD technology, does not give rise to a finding of the sort of coercion 
alleged here. See In re Time Warner, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22369, at *21-22  [*14] (citing Unijax, Inc. v. Champion Int'l, Inc., 
683 F.2d 678, 685 (2d Cir. 1982)). "
1216,," Plaintiffs also reprise an argument, based on Eastman Kodak, that Judge Castel rejected in In re Time Warner. Their assertion is 
that ""[a] coercive scheme may be found even if the tying arrangement leaves the consumer with some choice, or even if the 
coercion is not 100% effective in meeting the defendants' anticompetitive goal."" (Resp. 21.) We again join Judge Castel in 
finding this argument mistaken. In Eastman Kodak, the defendant required buyers of its replacement parts either to purchase 
repair services from Kodak or to promise to service their own machines; this prevented Kodak's clients from hiring third-party 
repairmen. 504 U.S. at 458. The result was to condition the availability of one product on an agreement not to buy a second 
product from a third-party. Actual coercion was therefore present. Here, however, there is no adequate allegation of conditioning, 
because CableCARDs provide an alternative to Insight customers who have no use for two-way communications. See In re 
Time Warner, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22369, at *23-24. "
1217,1," ""SLAPP is an acronym for ""Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation."" "
1218,2," Here, and elsewhere, the Court simply recites the allegations of the FAC and makes no factual findings regarding the correct 
definition of the relevant market or market share. "
1219,3," The Seventh Circuit, by contrast, does not recognize an actionable antitrust theory of false advertising or disparagement. 
Sanderson v. Culligan Int'l Co., 415 F.3d 620, 623 (7th Cir. 2005); Schachar v. Am. Acad. of Ophthalmology, Inc., 870 F.2d 397, 
399 (7th Cir. 1989)."
1219,4," Some circuits do not require plaintiffs to satisfy every element. See, e.g., Ayerst, 850 F.2d at 916-17; Am. Council of Certified 
Podiatric Physicians & Surgeons v. Am. Bd. of Podiatric Surgery, Inc., 323 F.3d 366, 371 & n.6 (6th Cir. 2003). "
1220,5," Though on a motion to dismiss the Court is ordinarily limited to considering the pleadings, the Court may also consider 
evidence ""on which the complaint 'necessarily relies' if: (1) the complaint refers to the document; (2) the document is central to 
the plaintiff's claim; and (3) no party questions the authenticity of the copy attached to the 12(b)(6) motion."" Marder v. Lopez, 450 
F.3d 445, 448 (9th Cir. 2006). Broadcom has submitted a transcript of the technology conference referred to in the FAC. (See 
FAC ¶ 36; Req. for Judicial Notice (""RJN""), Ex. 5.) Emulex argues that the transcript cannot be considered on this motion "
1221,," because it questions the reliability of the transcription. (Pl.'s Objections to Def.'s RJN at 3.) However, Emulex's claim rests not 
just on the oral statements made, but on the transcript hosted on Broadcom's website. (See FAC ¶ 36.) Emulex does not contest 
that this is the actual internet transcript referred to in the complaint. Therefore, the Court may consider the transcript under the 
incorporation by reference doctrine. "
1224,6," The Court only considers the two specifically-alleged statements regarding patent infringement as posted on the website. The 
remaining statements are either puffery, made to audiences with knowledge of the subject matter, or readily susceptible of 
neutralization."
1224,7," Again, if the statement is interpreted as asserting Emulex's inability to compete in the 10GbE controller market, the statement is 
puffery. See, supra, Part II.B.1.a."
1224,8," The Court therefore declines to consider whether an antitrust claim based on the first three statements—relating to the 
takeover attempt—is preempted by securities laws. "
1225,9," On a motion to dismiss, the Court may consider matters that are the proper subject of judicial notice, such as a publicly-filed 
complaint. See Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc Corp., 552 F.3d 981, 991 (9th Cir. 2009). "
1228,10," The Court acknowledges that the Girafa.com court stated that ""it is not relevant to [Section] 425.17(c)(1) whether [defendant] 
claimed that [plaintiff's] service infringes in a lawsuit or on a weblog."" Id. However, the Court respectfully disagrees. The medium 
in which a statement is made can give great insight into the speaker's motivation. When an accusation of infringement is made 
solely to customers without the filing of any lawsuit, one can presume that the intent was to influence customers rather than seek 
legal redress. The medium may, in some cases, be the message. "
1229,11," Generally, the Court does not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief. See Officers for Justice v. Civil Serv. 
Comm'n of S.F., 979 F.2d 721, 726 (9th Cir. 1992). However, because Emulex addressed the issue of its own accord in its 
opposition, the Court considers the issue. "
1230,1," In light of the dismissal of the entire Complaint, the Court does not address the portion of the motion seeking an order striking 
certain allegations of the Complaint. "
1231,2," The Court notes, for the sake of clarity, that APCs apply to oncology clinics, whereas the Momentum contracts pertain to 
hospital customers. The Court also notes that the parties agree that, as documents explicitly referred to and relied on by the 
Complaint, the contracts may be considered by the Court on this motion to dismiss, even though the documents are extraneous 
to the Complaint. In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir.1997); Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. 
White Consol. Indus., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)."
1231,3," Plaintiff's Opposition Brief defines GPOs as ""organizations that negotiate standardized contracts with manufacturers and 
suppliers of medical devices on behalf of their members."" Pl. Br. at 25 (quoting Natchitoches Parish Hosp. Svc. Dist. v. Tyco Int'l 
Ltd., 247 F.R.D. 253, 256 (D.Mass. 2008)). According to the helpful description of GPOs provided by the court in Natchitoches, GPOs pool the purchasing power of their members and leverage that power to negotiate lower prices. GPOs do not 
purchase any products, nor do they sign or otherwise enter into the contracts that they negotiate on behalf of their 
members. Instead,  [*5] GPOs negotiate standard form, or model, contracts that the members themselves sign and enter 
into with manufacturers. Id."
1231,4," The name of Plaintiff's wholesaler does not appear in the Complaint, but the Court takes judicial notice of it for the factual 
narrative of this Opinion. "
1233,5," In an attempt to establish that it is a direct purchaser, Warren General also points out that Amgen has admitted, through 
pleadings publicly filed in other lawsuits, that many clinics buy WBCGF from Amgen. This argument is unavailing. First, that a 
hospital or clinic buys from Amgen does not necessarily mean it purchases the product directly from the manufacturer, as 
opposed to somewhere along the distribution chain. Second, the relationship between Amgen and ""many clinics"" or other 
unidentified end users is simply irrelevant. The question the Court must address is whether the Plaintiff in this case, Warren 
General, has alleged facts in support of its claim that it is a direct purchaser of RBCGF and WBCGF from Amgen. It is well-
established that bringing a lawsuit as a class action does not dispense with the requirement that a named plaintiff must itself 
have standing to sue.  [*12] Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996); O'Shea v. Littleton, 
414 U.S. 488, 494, 94 S. Ct. 669, 38 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1974); Winer Family Trust v. Queen, 503 F.3d 319, 326 (3d Cir. 2007). "
1242,1," The county actually moved to dismiss the entire complaint, but the district court order addressed only the federal antitrust 
claims and ordered the county to answer the remainder of the complaint. On appeal, we address only the decision respecting 
the federal antitrust claims. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under the collateral order doctrine because the immunity 
asserted here includes immunity from suit. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291, 1292 (2006); Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 
U.S. 541, 546, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L. Ed. 1528 (1949) (establishing three-part test for collateral orders excepted from 
the final  [**6] judgment requirement for appealability); Martin v. Mem'l Hosp. at Gulfport, 86 F.3d 1391, 1394-97 (5th Cir. 1996) 
(explaining that orders denying claims of state action immunity are immediately appealable under Cohen); Commuter Transp. 
Sys., Inc. v. Hillsborough County Aviation Auth., 801 F.2d 1286, 1289-90 (11th Cir. 1986) (holding that HN1[
] an order 
denying summary judgment on state action immunity grounds was immediately appealable). "
1243,2," Neither in the complaint, in brief, nor at oral argument did Danner and Gateway's counsel clarify whether their challenge to the 
ordinance was facial or as-applied. Regardless of whether the statute is challenged on its face or in its application, our review of 
the state action immunity question is the same. IA Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law P 221a (3d ed. 2006) 
(""In both [facial and as-applied] cases, once the inconsistency sufficient to warrant prima facie preemption is found, the statute or 
practice survives the test only if these additional requirements are met . . . .""). To reach the immunity question in this 
interlocutory appeal, we will assume that the Sherman Act preempts both the statute on its face and the county's application of 
the ordinance. "
1244,3," Danner and Gateway also argue that the ordinance conflicts with other provisions of state law not related to the enabling 
statute. For our purposes, the fact that a local ordinance may conflict with a different state law may present a state law cause of 
action, but the noncompliance does not rise to the level of a federal antitrust violation. "
1246,1," For a conflict to exist, of course, the conduct contemplated by the statute or ordinance must also constitute a ""hybrid"" rather 
than a ""unilateral"" restraint. Fisher v. City of Berkeley, 475 U.S. 260, 266-69, 106 S. Ct. 1045, 1049-50, 89 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1986); 
see also 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U.S. 335, 345 n.8, 107 S. Ct. 720, 726 n.8, 93 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1987). This is so because 
a unilateral restraint  [**19] cannot conflict with Section 1 in light of the fact that it lacks the necessary element of concerted 
action. Fisher, 475 U.S. at 266-69, 106 S. Ct. at 1049-50."
1246,2," This is typical because resolution of the state action immunity issue may avoid the sometimes-thorny question of whether the 
conduct contemplated by the statute or ordinance falls within a category of restraints that are per se illegal, or failing that, having 
to undertake the fact-intensive inquiry required by the rule of reason."
1246,3," At oral argument, Danner and Gateway declined to label their challenge. I read their complaint, however, as only a challenge to 
how the county has applied the ordinance. On its face, the ordinance does not limit the number of exclusive franchisees. The 
county could therefore grant franchises to all players in the marketplace, including Gateway. Neither does the ordinance 
mandate or provide a formula by which the county must set residential rates. The ordinance therefore does not require the 
county to set the ""below market"" residential rates that allegedly force the franchisees to collude on the commercial side of their 
businesses. "
1253,1," Like this court in Dreher, other circuits have similarly adopted an elements test to determine whether a predicate offense has 
an effect on competition or on consumers for purposes of determining the applicability of § 921(a)(20). See United States v. 
Schultz, 586 F.3d 526, 530 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that in order for an offense to fall within § 921(a)(20)(A)'s exception, the 
Government must ""have been required to prove, as an element of the predicate offense, that competition or consumers were 
affected; possible incidental effects are not relevant.""); United States v. Stanko, 491 F.3d 408, 421 (8th Cir. 2007) (holding that a 
prior conviction under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) was not excepted by § 921(a)(20)(A) because ""none of the 
provisions of the FMIA require the Government to prove an effect upon competition or  [**9] commerce as an element of the 
offense.""); United States v. Meldish, 722 F.2d 26, 28 (2d Cir. 1983) (refusing to apply the business practices exception where the 
defendant's prior conviction ""in no way depends upon whether it has an effect on competition or consumers.""). "
1254,2," As described in the Fifth Circuit's pattern jury instructions: Title 18, United States Code, Section 371, makes it a crime for anyone to conspire with someone else to commit an offense 
against the laws of the United  [**12] States. . . . For you to find the defendant guilty of this crime, you must be convinced 
that the government has proved each of the following beyond a reasonable doubt: First: That the defendant and at least 
one other person made an agreement to commit the crime of     (describe) as charged in the indictment; Second: That the 
defendant knew the unlawful purpose of the agreement and joined in it willfully, that is, with the intent to further the unlawful 
purpose; and Third: That one of the conspirators during the existence of the conspiracy knowingly committed at least one of 
the overt acts described in the indictment, in order to accomplish some object or purpose of the conspiracy. FIFTH CIRCUIT CRIMINAL PATTERN JURY INSTRUCTIONS (2001) § 2.20."
1254,3," We evaluate both the alleged target offenses of the conspiracy conviction because it is unclear from the record which of the two 
target offenses (or both) provided the basis for the conspiracy conviction. Where there is only one conspiracy count and the 
finder of fact was required to find that the conspiracy has as its object each of the target offenses, then it would presumably be 
sufficient to deny the exception if there was at least one  [**14] target offense that did not meet it. However, if the conviction 
could have been based on either target offense, and we cannot discern which one it was based on, then both must be 
evaluated. "
1257,4," In the sentencing  [**25] context, a ""district court may consider any relevant evidence without regard to its admissibility under 
the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable 
accuracy."" United States v. Davis, 76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "
1260,1," Bank of America, N.A. (""BANA"") has also filed a motion to dismiss on grounds unique to it. The Court will address BANA's 
motion in a separate order. "

1271,1," Any city or town that establishes an airport must also establish an airport commission, ""which shall have the custody, care and 
management of the municipal airport of said city or town."" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 90, § 51E (2010). Massachusetts law confers "
1272,," [**2] upon such commissions various powers relating to airport operations, including, among other things, the powers to lease 
land, acquire property, set charges and rentals, expend funds, and promulgate rules and regulations. Id. §§ 51F-51J."
1272,2," There is no evidence that Rectrix was granted permission to become a full-service FBO, but Rectrix's agreement with BMAC 
was modified to expand the size of its leasehold and the parties agreed to terms for Rectrix's self-fueling of aircraft it owned (or 
managed or leased under an exclusive contract of least 60 days); the memorandum specifically precluded Rectrix from selling 
fuel to third parties. "

1276,8," First, Rectrix complains that the airport discriminated between Griffin and Rectrix with respect to fuel tank usage. However, 
Rectrix never developed this claim below: rather, Rectrix complained that BMAC allowed third parties to use Griffin's fuel tank 
while not allowing Rectrix to use Air Cape Cod's fuel tank; but at most these allegations would indicate discrimination between 
Air Cape Cod and Griffin or between other third parties and Rectrix--not between Griffin and Rectrix. Second, Rectrix says the 
airport refused to provide timely fuel service to Rectrix's customers and imposed on it a fueling policy that did not apply to Griffin. 
But below, Rectrix did not mention Griffin in connection with these allegations, much less show discrimination. "
1279,1," Accompanying the Motion for Summary Judgment was Defendants' Statement of Uncontested Facts (""DSUF"")(Docket # 191), 
to which Plaintiff replied with its Opposition to Statement of Uncontested Material Facts (""POSUF"")(Docket # 198). Defendants 
replied  [**4] (Docket # 208-3), and Plaintiff sur-replied (Docket # 212). Plaintiff also submitted its own Statement of Material 
Facts in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (""PSUF"")(Docket # 197), Defendant replied (DOSUF)(Docket 
208-33), and Plaintiff sur-replied (Docket # 213)."
1279,2," Dreyer's entered into an agreement in 2002, with an effective date of June 26, 2003, whereby it combined with Nestle Ice 
Cream Company, LLC to form Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Holdings, Inc. "
1280,3," Defendants have also filed a Motion to Strike the Rebuttal Declaration of Dr. Thomas Overstreet (Docket # 206), which was 
filed in response to Defendant' Motion for Summary Judgment, and after the window for expert discovery had closed in the case 
management calendar. Inasmuch as said declaration incorporated sales data produced after his original report was delivered 
and expounded upon his existing theories, Defendants' motion is DENIED. However, the report also includes new theories of 
liability, including foreclosure in certain sub-segments of the ice cream market, which were presented after the closure of expert 
discovery. These are an improper attempt to reformulate arguments regarding the relevant market, and shall be struck from the 
record. The present case is not as extreme as Lohnes v. Level 3 Communications, Inc., 272 F.3d 49, 59 (1st. Cir. 2001), which 
is cited by Defendants. Nevertheless, the new theories regarding sub-regions would require new market definitions and expert 
work  [**7] for both parties, and should thus not proceed at this advanced stage."
1280,4, This fact was not properly controverted with evidence to the contrary.
1280,5," Prior to the 2003 merger, the following brands, and possibly others, were available in Puerto Rico: Breyer's, Haägen Dazs, Blue 
Bunny, M&M Mars (Snickers, Dove, M&Ms), Payco, Flav-o-Rich, various private labels, Healthy Choice, Lady Richmond, Rich & 
Creamy, Blue Bell, and Carrusel, Nestle imported range, Edy's, Ben & Jerry's, Unilever  [**9] (Good Humor), Barbers, Nestle 
products; Budget Saver, Tofutti, Natural Fruit Corp, Parmalat -- Kinnett, Hood, Schoep's. As of 2008 the market included a "
1281,," similar number of options for the consumer: Breyer's, Haägen Dazs, Nestle, Nestle Gold, Nestle Payaso, Nestle Nevada, Nestle 
impulse products, Dole, M&M Mars (Snickers, Dove, M&Ms), Payco, Flav-o-Rich, various private labels, Healthy Choice, Lady 
Richmond, Rich & Creamy, Blue Bell, and Carrusel, Edy's, Unilever (Good Humor), Natural Fruit Corp., Rich Ice Cream and 
Products, Turkey Hill, Schoeps, Ben & Jerry's, Hunter Farms, Budget Saver, J&J Snack, Old Meeting House, Gianni of New 
York (""Gianni"") ice cream, and Gianni Italian ice. Plaintiffs have disputed the presence of Blue Bunny, and the relevance of 
various limber companies. They have not been included in this Court's analysis."
1281,6," Plaintiffs allege that the motivation for this merger was "". . . that Nestle executives responsible for investigating and approving 
the acquisition of Payco intended to monopolize ice cream distribution business in Puerto Rico and exclude or limit competitors 
such as Sterling, Unilever and Wells Dairy."" POSUF # 23. Contemporaneous to this merger, between 2002 and 2005, Sterling 
and Nestle management discussed different possibilities for merger, purchase, or the sharing of distribution rights. DSUF ## 
203-208. No agreement was ever reached. Part of Nestle P.R.'s pre merger difficulties were due to Payco's distribution network. 
""As Nestle recognized that continued competition with Payco would likely lead to further losses, acquiring Payco became an 
attractive option,"" because the local company controlled the best locations and key distribution channels. PSUF ## 24 & 28. 
Furthermore, this Court notes that the exact date of the merger is contested, but finds said fact to be immaterial for present 
purposes."
1281,7," PROMA staff expressed concern about the transaction's potential anti-competitive effects. PSUF # 46. Plaintiffs dispute this 
fact, however, their objections are centered on the merits of the decision, and not its existence. PROMA staff noted that the 
Payco/Nestle PR combination could create restrictions on competition, but the transaction was eventually approved, in part due 
to the fact that the Commonwealth wanted Nestle to continue operating its local ice cream factory. POSUF # 30. The approval 
was made official on March 25, 2003 (DSUF # 223), and stipulated that Nestle PR and Payco would not enter into exclusive 
contracts which closed more than 35% of the market to competition. DSUF # 224. Nestle P.R. also agreed that it would seek 
PROMA's  [**13] approval before granting the distribution rights over Edy's ice cream, unless Sterling should acquire the 
distribution rights to either Breyer's or Blue Bunny ice cream (or any other brand with similar sales). PSUF # 49. PROMA defined 
the relevant market as dedicated to the distribution and sale of ice cream. PSUF # 47. "
1282,8," Sterling alleges that Breyer's sales have stagnated as a result of the agreement, but this fact is in controversy, and not centrally 
relevant to the present motion. "
1283,9, This Court notes that Plaintiff posits its relevant market as the combination of these three segments.
1283,10," This conclusion is buttressed by practical idicia used by Overstreet, Plaintiff's expert. Internal Nestle documents refer to its 
competitors as Sterling, and Palm industries, excluding ice cream retailers. Accordingly, Sterling's expert determined that the 
data was not amenable to econometric analysis. Id."
1283,11," Baskin-Robbins distributed to a limited number of grocery stores at one point, but has since terminated this facet of its 
business. POSUF # 68."
1283,12, The name comes from a visit to the Island by Charles  [**20] Lindbergh in the 1920s. 
1284,13," The ""limber"" companies could be different, but Defendants have not presented evidence that ""limber"" distribution has had 
anything but a de minimis effect on the ice cream distribution market. "
1285,14," Sterling's expert accepted on its face the report of the company's executives that Sterling's sales accounted for the ice cream 
volume in SuperMax and Pueblo stores. DSUF # 235. "
1286,15," For much of the relevant period, Sterling did not carry ""cheap and sweet"" ice cream lines, which are an important seller at 
many supermarkets catering to lower income customer bases. DUSF ## 102-104. Furthermore, an important customer, 
Unilever, complained that Sterling does not have specific routes for impulse, single serving, ice cream sales. DSUF # 110. 
These factors may have limited Sterling's growth vis a vis Nestle PR/Payco."
1286,16," Sterling responds to this fact with an affidavit by one of its lawyers of a review of advertised prices. POSUF # 84. However, 
this Court finds said evidence insufficient to controvert these facts."
1286,17," A small number of Payco's agreements surpassed two years, including those with Mr. Special, Supermax, and Blockbuster 
that were for three years. See Docket # 191-88 at 30-33. Sterling points out Payco's 5 year deal with Ralph's as an example of 
an illegally long contract, but this was not 100% exclusive. Id. at 30. Plaintiff admits that it was 90% exclusive. POSUF # 211. 
Additionally, Plaintiff alleges that Payco and Nestle PR colluded regarding the terms of the Ralph's agreement about the 
payment terms to the supermarket chain. Id. "
1289,18," In fact, PROMA's guidelines would have allowed Nestle/Payco exclusive to have constituted up to 35% of the relevant market."
1289,19," Even accepting arguendo that said agreements could be construed as illegal, the entry of Gianni, coupled with Sterling's 
strong growth, clearly suggest the competitive structure of the market has not been impaired, and the market appears to have 
equal or greater competitiveness than it did prior to the 2003 merger. It is therefore impossible for this Court to infer ""but for"" 
damages, where their calculation, even in the light most favorable to Sterling, ""would 'necessitate wide ranging' speculation."" 
Sullivan v. Tagliabue, 25 F.3d 43, 51 (1st Cir. 1991). The rule of reason does not permit an inference that Sterling has 
experienced real anti-competitive  [**43] prejudice, and would have been any more or less successful had these agreements not 
existed. "
1290,20," To bolster its antitrust claims based on market foreclosure in detriment to competition, Sterling alleges that there are high entry 
barriers to the local ice cream distribution market, including: 1) the necessity of establishing a Direct Store Delivery System 
(""DSD system""), 2) purchasing trucks and freezers, 3) establishing sufficient route density, 4) obtaining ice cream brands to 
distribute, 5) failed entry by previous competitors, 6) market concentration between incumbents, 7) Puerto Rico Law 75, and 8) 
Payco's exclusivity agreements. PSUF # 198-199. Plaintiff alleges that Puerto Rico is a unique market because of its small size, 
and that local supermarkets, allegedly unlike those in the United States, do not have sufficient freezer warehouse capacity to 
store ice cream as inventory, requiring investment in a DSD system. As a result, ice cream must be frequently delivered in 
smaller quantities to in-store freezers, versus more infrequent deliveries to storage freezers, which is allegedly how the market 
works in the continental United States. Plaintiff alleges that this leads market entrants in Puerto Rico to face higher capital costs 
 [**48] because they must invest in greater refrigeration technology and more frequent routes. "
1292,21," As previously stated, Gianni recently entered the market, and while presumably on a smaller scale than both Plaintiff and 
Defendants' businesses, its entry is still significant for this Court's analysis, and Econo and Costco have also begun to self-
distribute ice cream in their stores. "
1293,22," This Court also finds that Sterling's attempted monopolization claim must be dismissed for failing to establish a dangerous 
probability that Nestle will achieve market power. The merger occurred over 6 years ago and the market remains ""robustly 
competitive."" Springfield Terminal Ry. v. Canadian Pac. Ltd., 133 F.3d 103, 110 (1st Cir. 1997)."
1293,23, Defendants allege that price increases were due to raw material price increases. DOSUF # 146. 
1294,24," Sterling also alleges conspiracy claims related to the price increase. These are unfounded because the parties are commonly 
owned, and any discussions regarding joint marketing strategies occurred during the process of the Nestle/Payco merger. Even 
if this were not the case Sterling's conspiracy claim would be very weak, because any price increases occurred after the merger 
and involve actions permitted under Linkline. Therefore, even Sterling's conspiracy claims are hindered by the need to show 
plausible causality between prohibited conduct and actual injury. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 
U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986)(stating "". . . respondents must show more than a conspiracy in violation of 
the antitrust laws; they must show an injury to them resulting from the illegal conduct. . ."" so injury does not result from "". . . 
alleged conspiracies . . . that tend to benefit respondents. . .""). "
1296,25," The Court has not discussed in detail said allegations, or Defendants' replies thereto, because they have not been linked to 
any specific acts creating antitrust injury or affecting the relevant market. Such a lack of causality to any antitrust harm leaves 
the allegations moot, even if the facts were proven true. "
1299,1, Documents pertaining to Ms. Manabat's loan and default were recorded with the Kern County Official Records. 
1301,2," ""We have extended the 'incorporation by reference' doctrine to situations in which the plaintiff's claim depends on the contents 
of a document, the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss, and the parties do not dispute the authenticity of 
the document, even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the complaint."" Knievel v. 
ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Parrino, 146 F.3d at 706). "
1304,3," The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agrees with the Ninth Circuit that 15 U.S.C. § 1635(b) does not compel a creditor to 
remove a mortgage lien in the absence of the debtor's tender of loan proceeds: Congress did not intend to require a lender to relinquish  [*21] its security interest when it is now known that the borrowers 
did not intend and were not prepared to tender restitution of the funds expended by the lender in discharging the prior 
obligations of the borrowers. Powers v. Sims & Levin, 542 F.2d 1216, 1221 (4th Cir. 1976). "
1320,1," In 2009, the Tennis Masters Cup was replaced by the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals."
1320,2," The four Grand Slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open) and the Davis Cup are not ATP 
tournaments and are regulated by the International Tennis Federation (""ITF""). But the Grand Slams have agreed to use ATP 
entry and ranking systems as the basis for determining entry and seeding of men's professional players into their events 
(Wimbledon has its own method of seeding calculation, which also takes  [**5] into account players' past performances on grass 
over the previous two years, as well as their ATP ranking). In return, playing in the Grand Slams is mandatory for top ATP 
players. The Grand Slams also agreed not to organize a year-end event competing with the ATP's Tennis Masters Cup and ATP 
agreed not to combine the Masters Cup with the Women's Tennis Association's year-end event. Additionally, ATP has an 
agreement with ITF not to schedule ATP events against Davis Cup matches and to award ATP ranking points to Davis Cup 
tournaments. "
1321,3," The Federations contend that initially the Brave New World plan downgraded the Monte Carlo tournament to Tier II. But after 
Monte Carlo sued ATP, the parties settled with Monte Carlo having a hybrid status--it awards 1,000 ranking points but is not a 
mandatory tournament for players. "
1322,4," The District Court had subject-matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1337 based on claims alleged under Sherman 
Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2 and 26, and under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 for supplemental state law claims. We have appellate jurisdiction 
 [**14] under 28 U.S.C. § 1291."
1322,5," Because the Federations did not carry their burden of proving a relevant market, we do not need to decide whether the District 
Court's single entity instruction was given in error. See infra Part III. "
1323,6," Giving the jury an overview of the rule of reason analysis for the purposes of § 1, the court stated: ""[Y]ou must first determine 
whether Plaintiffs have carried their burden to show that any challenged restraint has resulted  [**16] or is likely to result in a 
substantial harm to competition in a relevant product or geographic market(s)."" App. 257 (Antitrust Jury Instruction 10--Antitrust 
Claims: Sherman Act Section 1--Rule of Reason--Overview). Explaining the requirement of proof of competitive harm, the court 
repeated: ""[I]t is Plaintiffs' burden to show that the harm to competition occurred in an identified market, known as a 'relevant 
market.' There are two aspects to a relevant market. The first aspect is known as the relevant product market. The second 
aspect is known as the relevant geographic market."" Id. at 258 (Antitrust Jury Instruction 11--Antitrust Claims: Sherman Act 
Section 1--Rule of Reason--Proof of Competitive Harm). Closely following the Model Jury Instructions, the court then instructed 
the jury on the substance of the relevant market inquiry. Id. at 261 (Antitrust Jury Instruction 13--Rule of Reason--Proof of 
Relevant Market). Later, describing the elements of the monopolization claim under § 2, the court explained: ""Plaintiffs must 
prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants had monopoly power in a relevant market."" Id. at 272 (Antitrust 
Jury Instruction 21--Monopolization:  [**17] Relevant Market--General). Using the nearly identical language as for the rule of 
reason instructions, the court continued: ""There are two aspects you must consider in determining whether plaintiff has met its 
burden to prove the relevant market by a preponderance of the evidence. The first is the relevant product market; the second is 
the relevant geographic market."" Id. No relevant market inquiry instructions specific to § 2 claims were proposed or provided. 
See also ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Model Jury Instructions in Civil Antitrust Cases A-6 (2005) (suggesting that the 
instruction describing the relevant market for the purposes of § 1 claim incorporate the § 2 relevant market instructions)."

] The selection of a mode of antitrust analysis is a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. See Arizona v. Maricopa County Med. Soc'y., 457 U.S. 332, 337 n.3, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982)). "
1326,8," The Federations also appeal the District Court's grant of judgment as a matter of law on all antitrust liability claims against 
individual ATP directors. Relying on Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Shipowners & Merchs. Towboat Co., 467 F. Supp. 841 (N.D. Cal. 
1979), aff'd sub nom. Murphy Tugboat Co. v. Crowley, 658 F.2d 1256 (9th Cir. 1981),  [**30] the District Court held ""that civil 
liability for antitrust violations is limited to participation in inherently unlawful acts, that is, [] per se violation[s] of antitrust law."" 
App. 24. It concluded that ""the evidence [in this case] shows the individuals' conduct was not the type of inherently wrongful 
activity that gives rise to personal liability under antitrust law,"" but ""seem[s] within or at least bordering that gray area of socially 
acceptable economically justifiable business conduct that the law, in fact, permits."" Id. at 25. The Federations argue that the District Court's limitation of directors' personal liability to per se antitrust violations is legally 
incorrect. We question the persuasive value of Murphy Tugboat. See, e.g., Monarch Marking Sys., Inc. v. Duncan Parking Meter 
Maint. Co., No. 82 C 2599, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28261, 1986 WL 3625, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 13, 1986); Gregory Walker, Note, 
The Personal Liability of Corporate Officers in Private Actions Under the Sherman Act: Murphy Boat in Distress, 55 Fordham L. 
Rev. 909 (1987) (criticizing Murphy Tugboat approach to corporate officers' personal liability for antitrust violations). But we need 
not decide whether the District Court erred in  [**31] imposing a limitation on directors' personal liability and dismissing the 
antitrust claims against them. Because the Federations could not sustain their antitrust claims and failed to prove an antitrust 
violation, they would not be able to sustain the same claim against the Directors. Therefore, even assuming the District Court 
erred in granting summary judgment on the antitrust claims against the directors, plaintiffs cannot prevail on these claims. "

Indus., Inc., 980 F.2d 171, 205 (3d Cir. 1992)."
1327,11," In Copperweld, the Supreme Court held that ""the coordinated activity of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary must be 
viewed as that of a single  [**35] enterprise for purposes of § 1 of the Sherman Act."" 467 U.S. at 771. The Court reasoned that § 
1 scrutiny is not justified because ""[a] parent and its wholly owned subsidiary have a complete unity of interest,"" and when they 
agree to a course of action, ""there is no sudden joining of economic resources that had previously served different interests."" Id. 
The antitrust laws treat concerted behavior more strictly than unilateral behavior because ""[c]oncerted activity inherently is 
fraught with anticompetitive risk."" Id. at 768-69. Concerted action ""deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of 
decisionmaking that competition assumes and demands."" Id. at 769. But although parent and wholly owned subsidiaries are 
distinct corporate entities and independent legal persons, they nevertheless compose a single economic entity for antitrust 
scrutiny because ""[t]hey share a common purpose,"" id. at 771. Since they always have a ""unity of purpose or a common design,"" 
id., they are ""incapable of conspiring with each other for purposes of § 1 of the Sherman Act,"" id. at 777."

(quoting Brown, 518 U.S. at 252). ""When 'restraints on competition are essential if the product is to be available at all,' per se 
rules of illegality are inapplicable, and instead the restraint must be judged according to the flexible Rule of Reason."" Id. (quoting 
NCAA, 468 U.S. at 101). As we explained supra Part II.C,  [**44] given the circumstances of this case, the District Court 
correctly instructed the jury to evaluate the alleged restraints under the full rule of reason. "
1330,16," The presumption can also be rebutted by showing that ""one or more directors less than a majority of those voting"" suffers from 
a material and disabling interest and that ""the interested director controls or dominates the board as a whole or [that] the 
interested director fail[ed] to disclose his interest in the transaction to the board and a reasonable board member would have 
regarded the existence of the material  [**48] interest as a significant fact in the evaluation of the proposed transaction."" 
Cinerama, Inc. v. Technicolor, Inc., 663 A.2d 1156, 1168 (Del. 1995) (""Technicolor III"") (alteration in original) (quoting Cinerama, 
Inc. v. Technicolor, Inc., 663 A.2d 1134, 1153 (Del. Ch. 1994)); see also In re Transkaryotic Therapies, Inc., 954 A.2d 346, 363 
(Del. Ch. 2008). Because the Federations do not allege Pasarell controlled the ATP Board or failed to disclose his interest in 
Indian Wells, the only issue relevant to this appeal is whether the Board as a whole was interested and/or lacked independence. 
See Orman, 794 A.2d at 23. "
1331,17," The materiality requirement is not applicable to  [**50] cases involving ""classic self-dealing"" where a director ""stand[s] on both 
sides of a transaction."" HMG/Courtland Props., Inc. v. Gray, 749 A.2d 94, 113-115 (Del. Ch. 1999). Although the Federations 
label Pasarell's vote as ""self-dealing"" instead of ""self-interested,"" such characterization is misleading because Pasarell's Brave 
New World vote did not involve Indian Wells transacting with ATP. Pasarell's financial stake in Indian Wells was not ""antithetic to 
the corporate interest in a . . . proposed course of action."" 1 David A. Drexler et al., Delaware Corporation Law and Practice § 
15.05[1]. The Federations allege that Pasarell received a special benefit. Thus, they must show materiality of the interest to 
rebut the business judgment rule presumption. See generally id."
1331,18," Further, regardless of whether Pasarell's vote was materially self-interested, to rebut the business judgment rule presumption, 
the Federations would need to show that the ATP Board was materially self-interested. But because the Federations do not now 
dispute that the remaining five directors, who voted for the Brave New World plan, were not materially self-interested, the 
disinterested directors made  [**52] up the majority of the Board (six out of seven) and the majority of directors voting to approve 
the Brave New World plan (five out of six). Therefore, the Federations cannot establish that the majority of the ATP directors 
were materially self-interested. The Federations emphasize that the Brave New World plan could not have been adopted without 
Pasarell's vote. They argue that the disinterested majority rule should not apply here because the ATP Bylaws' ""super-majority"" 
voting provisions made simple majority approval insufficient to adopt the Brave New World plan. "
1332,," Because we hold the District Court was correct in its finding that Pasarell was not self-interested, we do not need to decide how 
the super-majority voting provisions might affect the self-interest inquiry. However, we note that the Delaware Supreme Court 
has previously addressed a similar issue. In Technicolor III, the corporation's certificate of incorporation included a provision 
which could be repealed with a recommendation made through a unanimous vote of qualified directors. 663 A.2d at 1170-71. 
The directors voted unanimously to recommend repealing the provision, but one of the directors was found to have been 
interested,  [**53] and plaintiffs argued that the transaction was therefore voidable. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the 
Court of Chancery's conclusion that the unanimity provision in the charter ""should not be construed to include an implied 
exclusion of interested directors from eligibility to participate in the unanimous vote."" Id. at 1171. Similarly, Pasarell's necessary 
vote, even if materially interested, is not excluded by the super-majority provision of the ATP Bylaws. The provision states that 
""two affirmative votes of the Tournament Tour Board Representatives plus two affirmative votes of the Player Tour Board 
Representatives"" are required. App. 2692. Like the provisions in Technicolor III, the bylaws here do not require exclusion of the 
interested votes, and Technicolor III suggests that no such exclusion can be implied. But although in Technicolor III the board's 
actions were examined under the business judgment rule and found not to have breached the duty of loyalty, neither the Court of 
Chancery nor the Delaware Supreme Court explicitly stated that the super-majority voting requirement does not affect the 
applicability of the business judgment rule presumption. As noted, because Pasarell  [**54] was not self-interested, we do not 
need to decide this issue. "

1356,4," Relying on this Court's earlier decision in the MDL class actions, defendants have also separately moved to dismiss plaintiffs' 
indirect purchaser claims under Puerto Rico's antitrust statute. In the MDL, the Court held that indirect purchasers do not have 
standing under Puerto Rico's antitrust statute because that statute is to be construed in harmony with federal antitrust law, and 
there has been no repeal of Illinois Brick in Puerto Rico. Plaintiffs' opposition concedes that dismissal of their Puerto Rico 
indirect purchaser claims is appropriate. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS defendants' motion to dismiss plaintiffs' indirect 
purchaser claims under the Puerto Rico antitrust statute. "
1357,5," Plaintiffs' opposition asserts that newly discovered evidence ""confirms the validity of their STN allegations."" Opposition at 
12:20. Defendants dispute the significance of the deposition and email excerpts cited by plaintiffs in their opposition. The Court 
makes no finding at this time about whether the evidence described in plaintiffs' opposition would support allegations of a 
conspiracy to fix prices of STN-LCD panels. "

means any electronics manufacturing services provider of an LCD Product. Id. PP 21-22. "
1363,3," In Air Cargo, there was a factual question as to whether some of the defendants were the actual importers of the goods, and 
thus the court granted the plaintiffs leave to amend the complaint. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35243, [WL] at *42. "
1365,4," The Court finds it unnecessary to resolve whether Motorola has sufficiently alleged a domestic effect. In addition, in light of the 
dismissal of the federal claims based on foreign-sold products, the Court does not address the parties' arguments about whether 
Motorola's claims based on foreign-sold panels contained in finished products that it purchased from intermediary non-party 
manufacturers should be dismissed because they are barred by the indirect purchaser  [*26] standing doctrine."
1365,5," In light of the Court's dismissal of the federal claims based on foreign purchases, as well as the dismissal of the state claims for 
failure to plead contacts sufficient to meet Due Process, the Court does not separately address defendants' arguments that the 
Court lacks jurisdiction over Motorola's foreign injury claims under state law. "
1366,6," Motorola incorporates by reference the arguments made by AT&T in opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss AT&T's state 
law claims on the same Due Process grounds. Accordingly, this order discusses AT&T's arguments as if they were advanced by 
Motorola in the first instance. However, as defendants' note, some of AT&T's arguments -- such as the fact that one of the AT&T 
plaintiffs is headquartered in California -- do not apply to Motorola. "
1370,1," The factual background of this action has been recounted in multiple prior orders and is well known to the parties. It will not be 
repeated here."
1370,2," Defendant HCA, Inc. correctly points out that plaintiff did not challenge the additional independent basis on which it was 
granted summary judgment. Thus, there would be no basis to vacate the judgment as to HCA in any event. "
1371,3," To the extent plaintiff is suggesting that the Supreme Court's reference in footnote 12 to ""adequate notice, representation by an 
attorney, access to a transcript of the proceedings, and the right to cross-examine witnesses,"" somehow means those particular 
items are always required, he is asking far too much from this dicta. It is apparent the Court was merely referring to the Pinhas 
plaintiff's particular complaints, and to the items set out in § 11112 (b). As explained in the order granting summary judgment, 
however, § 11112(b), only provides a ""safe harbor""--it also expressly provides that a failure to comply with all of its provisions, 
""shall not, in itself, constitute failure to meet the standards of subsection (a).""  [*8] See Smith v. Ricks, 31 F.3d 1478, 1485 (9th 
Cir. 1994) (""we reject as dicta any suggestion in Austin that a hospital [must] satisfy § 11112(b) in order to receive immunity."") 
Nor is the footnote a sufficient basis for reading out of the statute the provision of § 11112 (a) allowing for ""such other 
procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances."" "
1372,4," At the hearing, defendants proposed submitting a revised cost bill claiming only those costs associated with presenting the 
HCQIA defense, much as they revised their attorney fee claim. Although defendants likely would have incurred some costs even "
1373,," if they had presented the defense without delay, it is not persuasive that any significant costs are fairly attributable to presenting 
the HCQIA defense, on the particular factual record of this case. Accordingly, the request to submit a revised cost bill is denied. "
1377,1," A a third, intermediary standard exists in addition to the ""separate and  [**10] apart"" standard urged by Defendants and the 
""self-concealing"" standard urged by Plaintiffs. See Supermarket of Marlington, Inc. v. Meadow Gold Dairies, Inc., 71 F.3d 119, 
122 (4th Cir. 1995). Under that ""affirmative acts"" standard, ""a plaintiff must prove that the defendants affirmatively acted to 
conceal their antitrust violations, but the plaintiff's proof may include acts of concealment involved in the antitrust violation itself."" 
Id. "
1379,2," As noted above, the typical continuing violation occurs in a price-fixing conspiracy. Conceptually, price-fixing conspiracies and 
market allocation conspiracies are similar: ""The analogy between price-fixing and division of markets is compelling. It would be a 
strange interpretation of antitrust law that forbade competitors to agree on [prices], thus eliminating price competition among 
them, but allowed them to divide markets, thus eliminating all competition among them."" Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wis. 
v. Marshfield Clinic, 65 F.3d 1406, 1415 (7th Cir. 1995).  [**20] Given the similarities, the continuing violations doctrine can apply 
in a market allocation conspiracy. See Columbia Steel Casting Co., Inc. v. Portland Gen. Elec. Co., 111 F.3d 1427, 1444 (9th 
Cir. 1996) (holding, in an antitrust action alleging an agreement between two utility companies to a market allocation, that the 
utility company's refusal to allow a customer in its territory to have its power needs supplied by the other utility company was an 
overt act that restarted the statute of limitations under the continuing violations doctrine). "
1380,3," As Judge Gibson observed in Midwestern Machinery, whether the distinctive use—distinctive in the sense that it is not inherent 
in the acquisition itself—is viewed as a ""continuing violation or a different holding and use, the idea is the same"" in terms of the 
implications for statute of limitations issues. 392 F.3d at 281 n.15 (Gibson, J, dissenting). "
1382,4," If successful on their motion, Plaintiffs will have established the first element of their claims. See Admiral Theatre Corp. v. 
Douglas Theatre Co., 585 F.2d 877, 883-84 (8th Cir. 1978) (stating that the three elements of a claim under section 1 of the 
Sherman Act are (1) an agreement, conspiracy, or combination among the defendants in restraint of trade; (2) as a  [**31] direct 
and proximate result thereof plaintiffs have been injured in their business and property; and (3) the damages that the plaintiffs 
sustained are capable of reasonable ascertainment and are not speculative or conjectural)."
1382,5," There appears to be no dispute that Defendants compete at the same level of the market, and, thus, any agreement between 
them would qualify as horizontal. See Bus. Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elec. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 
808 (1988) (""[R]estraints imposed by . . . competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints . . . ."")."
1382,6," The Court's understanding is that Plaintiffs allege the conspiracy to be both a customer allocation conspiracy and a market or 
territory allocation conspiracy. "

1407,4," This motion assumed arguendo that Manufacturers had engaged in price fixing. For purposes of this appeal, we do likewise. "
1408,5," Justice Stewart dissented on the threshold question whether United Shoe had been shown to violate the antitrust laws and 
accordingly did not reach the issue of how to determine damages. (See Hanover Shoe, supra, 392 U.S. at p. 513 (dis. opn. of 
Stewart, J.).) The seven members of the Supreme Court to consider the pass-on defense thus were unanimous in rejecting it. "
1410,6," One can imagine still more remote consequences as well, such as changes in the value of a business as a going concern, or 
changes in buying patterns by consumers who substitute purchases of other products, with consequent positive and negative 
effects on the various distributors in the market. And so on, and so on."
1410,7," As originally enacted, the Cartwright Act's private damages provision read: “In addition to the criminal and civil penalties herein 
provided, any person who shall be injured in his business or property by any other person or corporation or association or 
partnership, by reason of anything forbidden or declared to be unlawful by this act, may sue therefor … to recover twofold the 
damages by him sustained, and the costs of suit.” (Stats. 1907, ch. 530, § 11, p. 987.) "
1411,8, Title 15 United States Code section 15(a).
1411,9," Section 16750, subdivision (a)."
1411,10," At issue was a claim under section 8 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. former § 8), which created liability for “the full 
amount of damages sustained” because of overcharges and other violations."
1411,11," Manufacturers argue that Hanover Shoe, supra, 392 U.S. 481, is not evidence of textual ambiguity because it was not a 
statutory interpretation case. We disagree. The United States Supreme Court itself has indicated Hanover Shoe resolved “a 
question of statutory interpretation,” namely, the “proper construction of § 4 of the Clayton Act [15 U.S.C. § 15].” (California v. 
ARC America Corp. (1989) 490 U.S. 93, 103 [104 L. Ed. 2d 86, 109 S. Ct. 1661].) More fundamentally, while it is true Hanover 
Shoe did not discuss how best to interpret the phrase “damages by him sustained,” that omission implicitly acknowledges that an 
exegesis of those few words would have yielded no answers. Tasked  [****27] with interpreting a statute, courts resort to all 
manner of tools to divine intent. Where in one case the text or legislative history may produce a clear answer, in another it may 
lead only to a dead end. Courts do not often catalogue every blind alley; that Hanover Shoe did not address the statutory text's 
opacity is of no significance. That the Supreme Court relied on nontextual tools to construe the Clayton Act is significant; it 
demonstrates the court's conclusion that the text itself was not restrictive enough to specify a unique measure of damages—that 
it was, in short, ambiguous. "
1412,12," E.g., Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (Act of July 2, 1890, ch. 647, § 7, 26 Stat. 209, 210) (“damages by him sustained”); 1899 
Michigan Public Acts, No. 255, section 11, page 412 (“damages by him sustained”); 1907 Missouri Laws, page 380 (Mo. Rev. 
Stat., former § 8972) (“damages by him sustained”); 1905 Nebraska Laws, chapter 162, section 18, page 644 (“damages by him 
sustained”); 1898 Ohio Laws, section 11, page 146 (former Ohio Gen. Code, § 6397) (“damages by him sustained”); 1893 
Oklahoma Revised Statutes, chapter 83,  [****30] section 4, page 1163 (“damages sustained”); 1898 Utah Revised Statutes, title 
54, section 1761, page 424 (“damages sustained”). "
1413,13," Nor do generic contract and tort damage cases address the significant antitrust-only policy concerns that have motivated the 
United States Supreme Court in its reading of the Sherman and Clayton Acts (15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.; id., § 12 et seq.) and that 
must influence our reading of the Cartwright Act. "
1414,14," “ ‘ “Parens patriae,” literally “parent of the country,” refers traditionally to [the] role of [the] state as sovereign and guardian of 
persons under legal disability [¶] … [¶] State attorney generals [sic] have parens patriae authority to bring actions on behalf of 
state residents for anti-trust offenses and to recover on their behalf.’ ” (Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. County of Stanislaus (1997) 
16 Cal.4th 1143, 1148, fn. 6 [69 Cal. Rptr. 2d 329, 947 P.2d 291].)"
1414,15," Bill author Representative Peter Rodino made the same point, explaining on the House floor that the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act 
had been specifically tailored, through Senate amendments to the bill that became new section 4C(a)(1) of the Clayton Act (15 
U.S.C. § 15c(a)(1)), to allow the Hanover Shoe no pass-on defense rule to coexist hand in hand with the bill's new parens 
patriae suits on behalf of indirect purchasers. (Remarks of Rep. Rodino, Debate on H.R. No. 8532, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 122 
Cong. Rec. H30878–H30879 (daily ed. Sept. 16, 1976).) "
1415,16," See Assembly Office of Research, third reading analysis of Assembly Bill No. 1162 (1977–1978 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 
17, 1977, page 1 (“The bill is modeled directly on federal law”); Senate Committee on Judiciary, Analysis of Assembly Bill No. 
1162 (1977–1978 Reg. Sess.) as amended May 17, 1977, page 2 (“This bill would enact into California law essentially the same 
provisions which were enacted last year by Congress and put into Federal law”). Notably, the text of section 16760 shows the 
Legislature shared Congress's preference for maximizing deterrence and ensuring full disgorgement of profits generated by 
antitrust  [****42] violations: section 16760 expressly authorizes the use of cy près and fluid recovery to maximize distribution to 
those harmed, with any excess to go to the Attorney General as costs or to the state as unclaimed property, rather than reverting 
to the wrongdoer. (§ 16760, subd. (e)(1)–(3).) "
1416,17," This case is perhaps far more typical. Pharmacies, intermediary purchasers, filed suit in 2004; had any consumers sought 
recovery of the same amounts Pharmacies seek (i.e., recovery for the years 2000–2004), they would have had to file suit long 
before now, and their actions could have been consolidated or coordinated without any risk of an award in this case impairing 
relief in any such hypothetical other case. "
1417,18," At the time, federal antitrust cases were treated as “applicable” (Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Great Western Financial Corp. (1968) 
69 Cal.2d 305, 315 [70 Cal. Rptr. 849, 444 P.2d 481]) and “authoritative” (Shasta Douglas Oil Co. v. Work (1963) 212 Cal. App. 
2d 618, 625 [28 Cal. Rptr. 190]) on Cartwright Act questions. Consequently, the Legislature feared Illinois Brick's rule would be 
applied equally to the Cartwright Act. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 3222 (1977–1978 Reg. Sess.) as 
introduced Mar. 27, 1978, p. 1 [bill introduced to “prevent a federal case interpretation of the Sherman Act precluding an indirect 
purchaser's standing to sue in antitrust actions [i.e., Illinois Brick] being applied to actions under the Cartwright Act”]; id. at p. 2 
[explaining the bill was needed because federal antitrust decisions like Illinois Brick were “considered ‘persuasive’ in interpreting 
the provisions of the Cartwright Act”].)"
1417,19," California was not alone in this. To date, 25 states and the District of Columbia have passed Illinois Brick repealer statutes; 
numerous others have interpreted existing state law to  [****51] allow indirect purchaser suits. (Karon, “Your Honor, Tear Down 
that Illinois Brick Wall!” The National Movement Toward Indirect Purchaser Antitrust Standing and Consumer Justice (2004) 30 
Wm. Mitchell L.Rev. 1351, 1361–1362.) The Cartwright Act amendment and other like Illinois Brick repealer statutes have 
subsequently been upheld against preemption challenges. (California v. ARC America Corp., supra, 490 U.S. at pp. 105–106.)"
1417,20," These implementation problems were those that would arise if indirect purchaser suits were permitted at the same time that 
Hanover Shoe's bar on a pass-on defense remained in place. (See Illinois Brick, supra, 431 U.S. at pp. 737?747 (maj. opn.); id. 
at pp. 761–764 (dis. opn.).) "
1418,21," In a closely related vein, we previously have approved the use of fluid recovery funds under the Cartwright Act precisely 
because they  [****56] might be the only way to “ensure that the policies of disgorgement or deterrence are realized” and 
because Cartwright Act defendants should not be “permitted to retain ill gotten gains simply because their conduct harmed large 
numbers of people in small amounts instead of small numbers of people in large amounts.” (State of California v. Levi Strauss & "
1419,," Co. (1986) 41 Cal.3d 460, 472 [224 Cal. Rptr. 605, 715 P.2d 564].) The same considerations are in play here, where rejection of 
the Hanover Shoe rule would allow alleged antitrust violators to escape without sanction."
1419,22," Indeed, the possibility that in this latter scenario Pharmacies did not lose sales as a result of the alleged price-fixing conspiracy 
rests on the rather unlikely proposition that cash-paying customers' demand for drugs is wholly inelastic to price. "
1420,23," Manufacturers argue, and the Court of Appeal agreed, that Pharmacies waived these other forms of injury. The record does 
not support this claim. Pharmacies expressly did not concede that they had suffered no other injuries as a result of the alleged 
price-fixing conspiracy. Rather, they waived any attempt to prove other injuries because those injuries' existence and measure 
were legally irrelevant under Hanover  [****61] Shoe, the rule Pharmacies contended applied under the Cartwright Act. As we 
agree that Hanover Shoe applies, we need not consider whether, had we concluded it did not, Pharmacies should have been 
permitted to prove injuries other than the overcharge in this case. (Cf. B.W.I. Custom Kitchen v. Owens-Illinois, Inc., supra, 191 
Cal. App. 3d at p. 1353 [if the pass-on defense applies, plaintiffs should have the opportunity to prove other injuries].)"
1420,24," We are aware of no statute or case that adopts such an in-between rule, and Manufacturers have cited none. The irrationality 
of such a rule is inferable as well from the United States Supreme Court's own precedents. To prevail on a pass-on defense in 
those rare instances  [****63] where it has been permitted under federal law, a defendant must show the plaintiff could not have 
raised rates otherwise (Kansas v. UtiliCorp United Inc., supra, 497 U.S. at p. 209; Hanover Shoe, supra, 392 U.S. at p. 493, fn. 
9) and did not lose sales, because the quantity to be purchased was controlled by a preexisting “cost-plus” contract (Kansas v. 
UtiliCorp United Inc., at p. 218; Illinois Brick, supra, 431 U.S. at p. 736; Hanover Shoe, at p. 494; see also Hovenkamp, The 
Indirect-Purchaser Rule and Cost-Plus Sales (1990) 103 Harv. L.Rev. 1717, 1720 [cost-plus contracts involve both a fixed 
markup and a fixed quantity to be delivered]). In essence, Supreme Court precedent recognizes that a pass-on defense (based 
on evidence of secondary consequences) is only presentable in circumstances that foreclose the possibility of tertiary 
consequences (lost sales and profits). Only then can one fairly say in defense that the plaintiff has suffered no injury as the 
result of an illegal overcharge. In contrast, in stable markup cases such as this one, where a purchaser's resale price is fixed as a direct function of its 
acquisition price so as to pass on any overcharge, the resale market's response  [****64] to that overcharge-inflated resale price 
is not fixed and may be different than it would have been in the absence of the overcharge—and that different response (e.g., 
lower sales) may injure the plaintiff. "
1422,25," Doing so would render the UCL's standing requirement substantially more stringent than other state unfair competition statutes 
such as the Cartwright Act, under which Pharmacies' standing is undisputed. Again, we see nothing in the text or history of 
Proposition 64 that suggests the voters intended such a result."
1422,26," In this court, Manufacturers argue that Pharmacies have waived reliance on their complaint's request for injunctive relief to 
defeat summary adjudication. This argument misplaces the relevant burden. If Manufacturers sought summary judgment on the 
ground Pharmacies could obtain no relief on their UCL claim, it was incumbent on Manufacturers, as the moving party, to show 
that each form of relief sought by Pharmacies was unavailable. While Manufacturers attempted that showing with respect to the 
request for restitution, their moving papers simply ignored Pharmacies' request for injunctive relief. In any event, the issue whether the availability of injunctive relief bars summary adjudication was decided by the Court of Appeal 
and fully briefed before us by the parties. It involves HN9[
] a pure issue of law, reviewable de novo. We may exercise our 
discretion to consider it. (See People v. Superior Court (Laff) (2001) 25 Cal.4th 703, 712, fn. 3 [107 Cal. Rptr. 2d 323, 23 P.3d 
563].) "

1435,1," At the outset of the case, an additional Defendant, Trailer Bridge, Inc., was named. However, the Court has recently granted a 
motion to dismiss (Docket No. 722) as to this Defendant. Accordingly, the Court shall not consider Trailer Bridge's filings in the 
instant Opinion and Order. Likewise, as Defendants Crowley Maritime Corporation and Crowley Liner Services have at this time 
filed a settlement agreement between themselves and Plaintiffs and have represented to the Court that they will no longer 
oppose the approval of other settlement agreements in the instant case (Docket No. 667), the Court shall not directly address 
their filings herein."

1436,4," When evaluating the evidence proffered by the parties in favor of or against certification of a settlement class, the Court has 
employed the preponderance of the evidence standard. See In Re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 320 (3d 
Cir.2009). "
1437,5," See supra note  [**27] 2 regarding the relevant definition of ""prices."" "
1439,6," Sea Star attached to its Motion Submitting Documents Pursuant to Court Orders of November 12 and November 13, 2009 
(Docket No. 595) evidentiary  [**35] objections to the affidavits proffered by Plaintiffs. First, Sea Star objects to the affidavit of 
Defendant Chisholm, asserting that it is unreliable because his settlement agreement with Plaintiffs was, at that time, 
undisclosed. As it has since been disclosed, the Court finds this argument MOOT. Sea Star then objects to the statements made 
by Defendant Chisholm in his affidavit as lacking foundation, lacking personal knowledge and unduly prejudicial. The Court 
OVERRULES these objections. See e.g Manual for Complex Litigation §21.21 (4th ed.2004) (""The judge need not decide at the 
certification stage whether such expert testimony satisfies standards for admissibility at trial.""). Sea Star also objects to the 
affidavit of Carlos Trigueros, arguing that the affidavit should be stricken in its entirety as it is too vague, and arguing that 
portions of it should be stricken for lack of foundation and for providing inadmissible opinions on legal issues. The Court 
OVERRULES these objections. Sea Star also objects to the affidavit of Maria V. Arbelaez, Roberto Medina, Melba J. Jordan, 
David Klau and Rafael Gonzalez based upon the same grounds. The Court OVERRULES these objections as well for  [**36] the 
reasons cited above. "
1441,7," HN11[
] With respect to the per se illegal nature of a price-fixing conspiracy, the First Circuit has stated: few agreements are deemed so pernicious that they are condemned 'per se' and without regard to the power of the parties 
to accomplish their aims, regardless of justification, and without any need to show an actual or potential adverse affect on 
consumer welfare. The classic cases are agreements to set prices, fix output or engage in horizontal market division. . . 
The categorical descriptions of per se offenses are quite misleading for anyone not well versed in antitrust. For example, 
price-fixing in its literal sense is not considered per se: virtually every sale is an agreement on price. The only  [**41] price-
fixing agreements that are condemned per se . . . are agreements (1) between competitors (2) as to competing 
products or services (3) where, in addition, the agreement is not part of a larger, legitimate economic venture. Augusta News Co. v. Hudson News Co., 269 F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis ours)."
1441,8," As already stated above, although the Crowley Defendants later withdrew their experts' affidavits, due to fairness 
considerations and acting out of an abundance of caution, the Court has chosen to review these reports as they relate to Sea 
Star's arguments against class certification and preliminary approval of the settlement agreements. "
1442,9," The Court notes that Defendant Trailer Bridge, whose motion to dismiss the Court recently granted, held a market shares 
between 12.5-15.6%, leaving the remaining Defendants with an 84.3-87.5% market share during the relevant time-period. Id. at 
Tables 1 & 2. "
1444,10," The Court has already stricken portions of Mr. St. Amand's affidavit under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 
113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993), at Docket No. 735. Accordingly, those portions are not discussed herein. "
1445,11," This is not to say that prices might not have fluctuated both up and down during the relevant time-period. Rather, the Court 
simply notes that supra-competitive prices were possible during that time, whether those prices increased or decreased from 
one year to another. "
1447,12," The Court notes that Sea Star's assertions regarding the impact of the base-rate freeze were based upon opinions of Mr. 
David  [**64] St. Amand which were stricken from the record at Docket No. 735 when the Court found him utterly unqualified to 
give testimony as to antitrust economics. "

] Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act do not themselves create private rights of action. Sections 4 and 16 of the 
Clayton Act authorize plaintiffs harmed by activity that violates §§ 1 and 2 to bring a suit for damages and injunctive relief. See 
Port Dock & Stone Corp. v. Oldcastle Ne., Inc., 507 F.3d 117, 121 (2d Cir. 2007) (""Although  [**8] [plaintiff's] substantive claims

1471,5," Prior to 2003, Rule 23 expressly authorized district courts to conditionally certify a class. See FED. R. CIV. P. 23(c)(1) (2002) 
(providing that a class certification order ""may be conditional, and may be altered or amended before the decision on the 
merits."") In 2003, however, the provision allowing for conditional certification was removed because ""[a] court that is not satisfied 
that the requirements of Rule 23 have been met should refuse certification until they have been met."" FED. R. CIV. P. 23 (2010) 
advisory committee's note to the 2003 amendments. However, as none of the parties challenge the District Court's certification 
order on the basis of that change, we will not discuss it further. "
1472,6," The District Court referred the case to a special master for the purpose of recommending a distribution plan for the indirect 
purchaser settlement award and for evaluating a fee request filed by plaintiffs' counsel. As we conclude that the Court improperly 
certified the indirect purchaser class, see infra Part III.A, the objections to the distribution  [**14] plan and fee award are moot, 
and we need not recount the special master's recommendation on those matters."
1472,7," The  [**15] objectors did not oppose certification of the direct purchaser class for the purpose of adjudicating Sherman Act 
claims. "
1473,8," The parties have not explained, nor does the record reveal, why the indirect purchaser class reaches back to 1994, but the 
direct purchaser class dates only from 1997. Whatever the reasons may be for this disparity, no one has suggested that they are 
pertinent to the present appeals."
1473,9," On June 11, 2009, plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that the objectors lack standing to appeal the 
Rule 23(b)(2) certification order because the injunction restrains only De Beers, not the objectors. We reject that argument. HN6[ ] An unnamed class member has standing to appeal a class certification order provided that the member objected  [**19] to 
the settlement and is bound by the court's judgment. Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.S. 1, 7-10, 122 S. Ct. 2005, 153 L. Ed. 2d 27 
(2002); accord Bell Atl. Corp. v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1307-10 (3d Cir. 1993). In this case, the objectors contested certification 
before the District Court. As class members, they are bound by the Court's judgment and by the terms of the settlement 
agreement, which release De Beers from antitrust liability. The objectors therefore have standing to pursue appeals, and we will 
enter a separate order denying the motion to dismiss. "
1476,10," HN22[
] Standing in those states is ordinarily but not always foreclosed. The following states lack Illinois Brick repealers but

1477,12," Our concurring colleague says we have ""attempted to address the specific nuances of the  [**32] substantive laws of the fifty 
states."" (Concurring at 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).) That is a misapprehension. HN25[
] We are certainly not saying 
that nuanced differences among state laws will prevent the certification of a class, nor are we suggesting that a state-by-state 
cataloguing of differences in state law is necessary every time a multi-jurisdiction class is certified. We are saying that the 
difference between having an antitrust claim under state law and having none is no mere nuance and cannot be solved by any 
reconfiguration of the nationwide class short of changing it from a nationwide class to one or more classes that exclude those 
who have no claim. The concurrence acknowledges this necessity by saying that, ""[i]f … neither state nor federal law provides a 
New Jersey resident with a right to relief, then the class should be redefined so that it does not include persons whose right to 
relief is governed by New Jersey law."" (Id.) "
1478,13," Again, HN28[
] we are not suggesting that a district court must conduct a state-by-state analysis every time there exists 
some difference in the state law underlying class members' claims. However, when the parties propose to use class certification 
mechanisms in a manner that materially changes substantive rights, the district court has a duty to ensure that such use does 
not create a right of recovery where none existed before. See Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 320 (imposing on district courts 
the obligation to ensure that the plaintiffs have satisfied their burden under Rule 23 before certifying a class). Hence, district 
courts must remain attuned to the kind of significant variations in state law at issue here and reject proposed classes that allow 
plaintiffs to recover damages through the class certification procedure when they would be unable to do so in an individual 
 [**35] action. "
1480,14," It is inapposite to say, as does our concurring colleague, that every plaintiff ""might have some valid claim"" in addition to an 
antitrust or  [**43] consumer protection action and that such claims might be susceptible to common elements of proof. 
(Concurrence at 13 (emphasis in original).) That is pure speculation, for, if such claims exist, the plaintiffs did not bring them. 
Every claim alleged in the complaints seeks recovery for price-fixing and monopolization by De Beers. The claims themselves 
are brought under a variety of statutory labels, but at their core they all seek damages flowing from De Beers's antitrust conduct, 
which is categorically foreclosed to indirect purchasers in many states without Illinois Brick repealers. "
1481,15," Plaintiffs argue that Warfarin Sodium II compels us to uphold the District Court's certification order, and our concurring 
colleague believes that we ""dismiss[] out of hand"" the controlling effect of that decision. (Concurring Op. at 1.) Not so, though we 
evidently do view that case differently. In Warfarin Sodium II, a nationwide class of plaintiffs sued DuPont Pharmaceuticals 
Company for deceptive advertising after DuPont claimed that Coumadin, an anticoagulation drug, produced certain benefits not 
associated with the generic form marketed by its competitors. 391 F.3d at 522-24. Plaintiffs, including indirect purchasers of 
Coumadin, brought claims for monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act, the consumer protection laws of all fifty 
 [**47] states and the District of Columbia, and the state antitrust statutes in states with Illinois Brick repealers. Id. at 524 & n.8. 
All class members also advanced a claim under the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, DEL. CODE tit. 6, § 2513, on the ground 
that the allegedly deceptive communications originated from DuPont's Delaware-based headquarters. Warfarin Sodium II, 391 
F.3d at 528. The District Court approved a settlement class, which we upheld on appeal over the protests of an objector who 
argued that variations among state consumer protection statutes defeated predominance. Id. at 529-30. Warfarin Sodium II is not controlling because the plaintiffs in that case shared a common claim under the Delaware Consumer 
Fraud Act. Id. at 528. Evidence pertaining to DuPont's distribution of deceptive marketing materials was common to all class 
members, and all class members suffered a similar harm by purchasing Coumadin under false pretenses. Id. Thus, unlike the 
plaintiffs in this case, the plaintiffs in Warfarin Sodium II shared a single, common claim that gave rise to an identical right to 
recovery under a single state statute for every member of the class. The same evidence used to support  [**48] this class-wide 
claim was also relevant to the consumer protection claims under the laws of other states, making class issues predominant over 
individual ones. The nationwide consumer protection claims certified in Warfarin Sodium II are critically different than the antitrust claims in this 
case because they were founded upon deceptive marketing practices, which were properly cognizable under the laws of all fifty 
states. See id. at 529-30 (implying that certification was proper for settlement purposes because the law in all fifty states 
provided some form of relief for DuPont's deceptive marketing practices). In contrast, many states do not permit plaintiffs to 
invoke consumer protection remedies for the antitrust harms that the indirect purchasers have suffered. Warfarin Sodium II's certification of a class for the purpose of settling indirect purchasers' antitrust claims is also distinguishable 
from this case. Unlike in Warfarin Sodium II, the District Court here included indirect purchasers from all states in a single class, 
even though indirect purchasers in many states lack standing to bring antitrust claims. Those members share no common 
question with the rest of the class because  [**49] no amount of factual similarity with other class members will confer a right to 
recover upon them. They are categorically precluded from obtaining antitrust recovery regardless of whether De Beers's price-
fixing and monopolization activity disadvantaged them. Thus, the certification of this class, unlike in Warfarin Sodium II, has 
created a remedy for class members who have no substantive right to receive it. Warfarin Sodium II's certification under state antitrust statutes is unpersuasive in this context because the class at issue in that 
case did not include claims under the laws of states without Illinois Brick repealers. Thus, we never considered whether an 
indirect purchaser in a state without a repealer could use a class settlement as a means of obtaining recovery that the purchaser 
could not receive had he brought the suit in his individual capacity. We do not construe Warfarin Sodium II as approving such a 
result. In fact, we noted in Warfarin Sodium II that ""there may be situations where variations in state laws are so significant as to 
defeat commonality and predominance, even in a settlement class."" Id. at 529. There can be no greater variation in state law than exists in  [**50] the present case, where a plaintiff in one state has access to 
a remedy that is foreclosed to an identical plaintiff situated across state lines. Thus, we have not, as the concurrence suggests, 
departed from our holding in Warfarin Sodium II that HN42[
] a class may include plaintiffs whose claims differ significantly if all 
members share at least one common issue. We have instead recognized that a plaintiff who has no right to relief cannot join in 
the same class as a plaintiff who does, and that, if those two plaintiffs are included in a single proposed class, then the court 
may not certify that class because no common issue predominates with respect to both plaintiffs."
1481,16," HN43[
] In many cases, it will be evident that all class members share common legal or factual questions, even if the precise 
elements of proof for their claims vary among jurisdictions. Under such circumstances, a district court need not conduct an 
extensive inquiry into substantive state law to formally establish commonalities that are apparent. District courts in their sound 
discretion will determine the level of analysis to undertake when deciding whether variations in state law warrant detailed 
examination and a description  [**51] of similarities and differences. In a case like this -- where the class includes many people "
1482,," who could not pursue claims in an individual action -- that more searching inquiry was needed, as the plaintiffs have tried to use 
class action procedures to create a bridge to recovery where otherwise none would exist."
1482,17," We briefly note that the indirect purchasers face factual obstacles to class certification notwithstanding the legal defects 
discussed above because competition in the market for rough gem diamonds waxed and waned during the class period. The 
class includes all indirect purchasers who acquired diamonds between January 1, 1994 and March 31, 2006, regardless of 
whether they obtained stones from De Beers or from a competitor. The record, however, reflects that many of De Beers's 
competitors did not participate in the alleged price-fixing conspiracy throughout that period. As a result, some class members purchased diamonds in a market that was heavily influenced by De Beers while others did not. 
Gary French, an expert retained by plaintiffs to calculate damages and show class-wide antitrust impact, explained that during 1999 there was a substantial drop in the price of imported diamonds.  [**52] This drop in price corresponds to a 
period of time when it is known that De Beers … [was] selling off part of the stockpile of diamonds held in reserve. Thus, 
the per-unit value of rough diamonds fell closer to what may be considered ""competitive"" levels during the sell off. (App. at 435.) French later testified that, in 2001, ""De Beers temporarily allowed the market to set prices which led to a 
subsequent drop in polished diamond prices."" (App. at 5020.) Plaintiffs who purchased diamonds before 2001 may have different rights to recovery depending on whether their supplier was 
actively cooperating with De Beers price-setting efforts. See Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., 423 F.3d 184, 207 (3d Cir. 2005) 
(indicating that HN44[
] a § 1 plaintiff must prove that the defendant joined a conspiracy to restrain trade). Similarly, those who 
acquired diamonds in 2001, when De Beers allowed market forces to dictate pricing, likely have no antitrust claim because they 
made their purchases in a competitive market. See Angelico v. Lehigh Valley Hosp., Inc., 184 F.3d 268, 273-74 (3d Cir. 1999) 
(HN45[
] requiring plaintiffs to show that they have suffered an antitrust injury -- i.e., an injury to competition -- to obtain 
 [**53] standing to bring an antitrust claim). Thus, the class, as currently defined, includes members that acquired diamonds in a market controlled by the CSO, members 
that purchased diamonds from competitors that were not participating in the CSO's price-fixing activities, and members that have 
no antitrust injury whatsoever. Hence, class members have not sustained a uniform injury as the result of De Beers's antitrust 
conduct. Instead, their injuries depend upon when they purchased their diamonds and from whom they purchased them, and 
those injuries can be established only through individual proof. The class is therefore unworkable as these factual differences 
would defeat class certification notwithstanding the legal defects in the District Court's certification order that we have discussed 
above. See Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 311-12 (HN46[
] ""[T]he task for plaintiffs at class certification is to demonstrate 
that the element of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class rather than individual 
to its members.""). "
1483,18," The five issues are as follows: (a) Whether [D]efendants combined or conspired with others to fix, raise,  [**56] stabilize and maintain the prices of 
polished diamonds; (b) Whether [D]efendants monopolized or combined or conspired with others to monopolize the supply of polished 
diamonds; (c) Whether [D]efendants' conduct caused the prices of polished diamonds to be maintained at higher levels than would 
exist in a competitive market; (d) Whether [P]laintiffs and the Class[es] are entitled to injunctive relief; and (e) Whether [D]efendants' conduct caused injury to the business or property of [P]laintiffs and the other [Class and] 
Subclass Members and, if so, the appropriate class-wide measure of damages. (App. at 1:276 (alterations in original).)"
1483,19," We express no opinion regarding whether a class could properly be certified following remand and provide guidance regarding 
the content of a certification order only to aid the District Court in disposing of a class certification motion, should the parties 
choose to file one. "
1485,20," Our concurring colleague says that we have mischaracterized the expert testimony by concluding that plaintiffs face no 
significant threat of future antitrust harm. (Concurring Op. at 18.)  [**65] However, the plaintiffs' own expert opined that ""De 
Beers is no longer able to control the quantities [of diamonds] available to the market as it had been in the past,"" and that it has 
therefore lost the ability to set the price of rough diamonds. (App. at 4321, 4323.) An industry commentator cited by that expert 
concluded that, by July 2007, ""De Beers [was] no longer providing the steady hand that controlled supply and kept prices stable. 
Prices might now be volatile, subject to the normal ups and downs of the marketplace."" (Id. at 4318.) Further, the European 
Commission has closed an antitrust investigation against De Beers on the ground that the entry of new diamond producers 
""means that there is now more competition on the rough diamonds market."" (App. at 4319.) Thus, we have noted only what the 
experts, including the plaintiffs' experts, have said: that the market has grown competitive to the point that De Beers cannot 
control the market price."
1485,21," The objectors alternatively challenge the substantive provisions of the injunction as inadequate to ensure that competitive 
forces continue to prevail in the market for rough gem diamonds. As we conclude that plaintiffs lack standing to  [**66] pursue 
injunctive relief, we need not decide whether the terms of the injunction are sufficient to safeguard competitive market forces. "
1486,22," The concurrence observes that, after years of proceedings, hundreds of pages of recommendations by the special master, 
and a lengthy opinion by the District Court considering over thirty timely objections, the objection of one person has become the 
undoing of a class certification. In our colleague's eyes, we have wielded ""a sword rather than a scapel."" (Concurring Op. at 2 
n.1.) The concurrence thus seems to imply that our decision is an overreaction to a minor problem and evidences a lack of 
appreciation for the labor involved in achieving a settlement. That is not the case. We acknowledge with gratitude, as does the 
concurrence, the intense effort invested by the  [**67] District Court in addressing this litigation. Nonetheless, the objection 
regarding the lack of predominance of class issues in this case raises an insurmountable hurdle to certification of the indirect 
purchaser class, as already described. As we have said, HN54[
] two plaintiffs cannot be joined in a single class to adjudicate 
the same set of facts when those facts give only one of them a legally cognizable claim. That a single objector raised this 
problem makes it no less salient than if all of the remaining class members had pointed it out."
1486,23," The objectors have also appealed two orders that awarded attorney's fees and approved payment of certain expenses to the 
settlement administrator. Those challenges are necessarily vacated in light of our conclusion that the class as currently defined 
was not amenable to certification. We express no opinion regarding the reasonableness of the fee award or the expenses 
incurred by the settlement administrator, and those issues are subject to reconsideration by the District Court at an appropriate 
time."
1486,1," The proceedings leading up to the approval of the class and the proposed settlement required considerable judicial time and 
attention. The litigation began nine years ago and involved seven class actions that were ultimately consolidated before the 
District Court. The parties reached a preliminary settlement in 2005, and the District Court conditionally certified the class and 
appointed retired District Judge Alfred Wolin as a Special Master to review issues related to the settlement agreement. After two 
years of proceedings, Judge Wolin wrote a 175-page Report and Recommendation regarding notice to class members and the "
1487,," distribution of settlement funds, an 87-page Report and Recommendation regarding the award of attorneys' fees and 
reimbursement of costs, and two supplemental reports. Of the tens of millions of class members, thirty-four filed timely 
objections. The District Court considered these objections in a lengthy opinion, and ultimately decided to grant final class 
certification and approval of the settlement. Only one of these objections is the subject of the majority's  [**70] opinion. Although the fact that the District Court conducted such intricate proceedings is not controlling, it is clear that the settlement was 
welcomed by nearly all affected, and that the alleged flaws form the basis for only a few complaints. As noted in an amicus brief 
filed by a trade association of jewelry manufacturers and retailers urging affirmance, ""a small number of consumers with modest 
claims and little financial interest in the outcome of the appeal"" are being allowed to prevent ""[a]n industry in financial straits"" 
from recovering some of what it lost as a result of De Beers's conduct. Amicus Br. at 4. I submit that the wholesale rejection of 
what the District Court accomplished, based on the concerns raised by just one objector among tens of millions of class 
members, uses a sword rather than a scalpel and is uncalled for. "
1488,2," In Amchem, the Supreme Court cautioned that the requirements of Rule 23 (other than manageability) ""demand undiluted, 
even heightened, attention in the settlement context,"" in part because settlements deprive courts of ""the opportunity, present 
when a case is litigated, to adjust the class, informed by the proceedings as they unfold."" 521 U.S. at 620. However, the 
Amchem Court also recognized that ""[p]redominance is a test readily met in certain cases alleging consumer or  [**76] securities 
fraud or violations of the antitrust laws."" Id. at 625. We determined that Warfarin II fell ""squarely into that category."" 391 F.3d at 
528."
1488,3," The majority distinguishes this case from Warfarin II on the basis that the Warfarin plaintiffs ""shared a common claim under the 
Delaware Consumer Fraud Act."" Maj. Op. at 42 n.15. However, we did not even address the Delaware statute in analyzing 
predominance; indeed, we acknowledged that ""that there may be variations in the rights and remedies available to injured class 
members under the various laws of the fifty states."" 391 F.3d at 530. Our discussion of the Delaware statute was limited to the 
issue of commonality; we referred to it as one of several reasons why commonality existed in the class. Id. at 528-29. The majority also distinguishes Warfarin II on the basis that its ""nationwide consumer protection claims . . . were founded upon 
deceptive marketing practices, which were properly cognizable under the laws of all fifty states."" Maj. Op. at 43 n.15. Yet our 
analysis in Warfarin was much broader than the majority suggests. Rather  [**77] than engaging in an independent analysis of 
whether every state's consumer protection law permits claims based on deceptive marketing practices, we considered the 
""consumer fraud and antitrust laws of the fifty states"" as a whole, and concluded that ""the fact that there may be variations in the 
rights and remedies available to injured class members under the various laws of the fifty states in this matter does not defeat 
commonality and predominance."" 391 F.3d at 529-30 (emphases added). Finally, the majority appears to distinguish Warfarin II as not having ""included indirect purchasers from all states in a single 
class."" Maj. Op. at 43 n.15. However, Warfarin II made no such distinction; to the contrary, we specifically noted that indirect 
purchasers were included in the class, and the class was defined as ""[a]ll consumers or Third Party Payors in the United States 
who purchased and/or paid all or part of the purchase price of Coumadin dispensed during the period March 1, 1997 through 
and including August 1, 2001."" 391 F.3d at 525. Although it may be true, as the majority contends, that there are potential class "
1489,," members who do not have a right to recover against De Beers, the District  [**78] Court should be allowed to make that 
determination on remand, and then adjust the class definition if necessary."
1489,4," The District Court determined that [w]eighing claims, particularly Consumer claims, by different state laws would not be appropriate in this case for the 
following reasons: a) De Beers, in the pursuit of a global settlement, demanded a release of potential damage claims in all 50 states; 
without class member releases from all 50 states, the settlement amount likely would have been less. b) A nationwide class of consumers had been certified in the Null case. c) All class members benefit from the additional  [**79] value of the injunctive relief obtained. d) Weighting class member claims based on the relative strength of different state law claims would be imprecise at 
best, would greatly add to the cost and complexity of processing claims, and would diminish the funds available for 
claimant recovery. e) A nationwide antitrust class action is an expedient vehicle to resolve the disparate claims of the Direct Purchasers 
and the Indirect Purchaser Subclasses. App. 279."
1489,5," It could be that the claims and laws here are sufficiently similar to those set forth and implicated in Warfarin II, thereby making 
the analysis fairly simple. There are, for instance, overlapping issues regarding ""indirect  [**81] purchasers"" in both cases. See 
Maj. Op. at 14; Warfarin II, 391 F.3d at 525. But the District Court must analyze these issues to provide us with a basis for 
review. "
1490,6," I agree with the majority's statement that De Beers's price-fixing and monopolization conduct is at the core of plaintiffs' claims. 
See Majority Op. at 36 n.14. However, plaintiffs challenge that conduct under a variety of laws, not just antitrust laws, and it is for 
the District Court to determine, in the first instance, whether those other laws provide the plaintiffs with valid causes of action."
1490,7," For the same reason, I disagree with the majority's claim that its approach serves the interests of federalism and ensures 
compliance with the Rules Enabling Act by preventing class actions from ""extend[ing] recovery to a state law plaintiff when state 
courts would not recognize the plaintiff's harm as grounds for relief."" Maj. Op. at 40. Our approach in Warfarin II and Prudential 
is premised upon the understanding that if a defendant's conduct gives rise to one cause of action in one state, and a different 
cause of action in another state, then it can be appropriate to hear both claims in a single class action. This approach respects 
the states' recognition of different causes of action, and does not ""enlarge . . . any substantive right"" in violation of the Rules 
Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b)."
1490,8," At  [**85] the same time, however, we have never required district courts, as part of the class certification process, to evaluate 
every nuance of each potential class member's claims. That type of inquiry would only mire district courts in endless class 
certification proceedings while failing to address the actual requirements of Rule 23. To the extent that there is a question about 
whether a specific class member is entitled to recover from the defendant, it should be addressed as part of the claims process, 
not the certification proceeding. "
1491,9," I am also unpersuaded by the majority's disagreement with the propriety of accepting De Beers's stipulation to a risk of future 
harm. On this issue, the majority invokes Amchem's caution that the ""specifications of [Rule 23]--those designed to protect 
absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions--demand undiluted, even heightened, attention in the 
settlement context."" 521 U.S. at 620. But De Beers is not stipulating that Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied; indeed, the majority does not 
even address whether this case satisfies the Rule's requirement that ""the party opposing the class  [**89] has acted or refused 
to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate 
respecting the class as a whole."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Rather, De Beers's stipulation addresses the question of whether 
plaintiffs face ""threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws,"" as they must in order to satisfy section 16 of the 
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26. Nothing in Amchem, Warfarin I, or the Clayton Act itself prevents De Beers from stipulating that 
such a threat exists. "
1497,1," If an NPM distributed its cigarettes nationally, and its distribution patterns approximated those of the national market, its 
payment obligations on its national sales would be apportioned 100 percent among the settling states, with the result that 
something close to 100 percent of its payments would, in the aggregate, be retained under the Original Escrow Provision. 
However, if an NPM were to concentrate its business to a single state, such as Louisiana, it would make 100 percent of its sales 
there and would be able to recoup the payments on all but roughly 2.26 percent, which is Louisiana's approximate allocable 
share. While the PMs would be required  [**6] to continue 100 percent of their payments under the MSA, an NPM that focused 
on a single regional area could be virtually exempt from the payments, thereby gaining a competitive advantage. "
1498,2," Xcaliber did not challenge the dismissal of its Commerce Clause claim in the previous appeal. Therefore, that claim is no longer 
part of the suit."
1498,3," Xcaliber asserted no claim for direct relief under the First Amendment on summary judgment and does not advance a direct 
claim under the First Amendment on appeal. Also, Xcaliber's briefing on its Equal Protection and Due Process claims only 
discusses the United States Constitution. Accordingly, any separate arguments based on the Louisiana Constitution are waived. 
See In re Texas Mortgage Servs., Inc., 761 F.2d 1068, 1073, 74 (5th Cir. 1985). "
1499,4," Xcaliber argues that Rice is not the correct standard and cites to other preemption cases that supposedly show that the proper 
inquiry is much broader. We find Xcaliber's complaints about Rice to be misguided. First, the preemption cases Xcaliber cites do 
not involve the Sherman Act. HN5[
] Because states are permitted to enact legislation that impacts competition without 
necessarily running afoul of the Sherman Act, see Community Communications Co. v. City of Boulder, 455 U.S. 40, 64, 102 S. 
Ct. 835, 70 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1982), the preemption analysis under the Sherman Act is different than the preemption analysis under 
other statutes. Second, even if Rice applies only to facial challenges, the point does not help Xcaliber because its complaint 
presents a facial challenge. Rather than seeking a private remedy against private parties or an injunction against enforcement of 
the statute in some specific, limited situation, Xcaliber seeks a declaratory judgment that the ASR is preempted by the Sherman 
Act and an injunction against the enforcement of the ASR in all situations. That is, Xcaliber claims the ASR is unconstitutional 
under the Supremacy Clause in its every application. Accordingly,  [**11] we apply the Rice per se analysis rather than rule of 
reason analysis. See Rice, 458 U.S. at 661. We also note that the other courts that have considered a claim that the MSA or its 
related legislation is preempted by the Sherman Act have applied Rice. See Grand River Enters. Six Nations, Ltd. v. Beebe, 574 
F.3d 929, 936 (8th Cir. 2009); KT & G Corp. v. Att'y Gen. of State of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1126 (10th Cir. 2008); Sanders v. 
Brown, 504 F.3d 903, 910 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 553 U.S. 1031, 128 S. Ct. 2427, 171 L. Ed. 2d 229 (2008); S & M 
Brands, Inc. v. Summers, 393 F. Supp. 2d 604, 628 (M.D. Tenn. 2005), aff'd, 228 Fed. Appx. 560; Tritent Int'l Corp. v. Ky., 467 
F.3d 547, 554 (6th Cir. 2006); Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 357 F.3d 205, 222, reh'g denied, 363 F.3d 149 (2d Cir. 2004), 
on remand, Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Cuomo, 592 F. Supp. 2d 684, 696 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), appeal docketed, No. 09-0547 (2d 
Cir. Feb. 10, 2009)."
1499,5," We note that Xcaliber's Sherman Act argument is undermined by an obvious incongruity between its allegations and the relief it 
seeks. Xcaliber specifically limits its complaint to the ASR. We have difficulty understanding why an agreement implemented 
pursuant to the MSA, but inadvertently advantageous to Xcaliber, would be acceptable while a modification of that same scheme 
that closes a loophole would violate antitrust law and be preempted. It would seem that Xcaliber's logic would require us to 
invalidate the entire statutory structure implementing the MSA rather than just the ASR. A related Fifth Circuit case for which oral 
argument was recently held presents a challenge to the MSA itself. See S&M Brands Inc. v. James Caldwell, No. 09-30985. "
1500,6," Rather, as discussed infra, Xcaliber alleges that the ASR effectively allows the PMs to conduct their business as though they 
were part of an output cartel, thereby destroying competition and forcing NPMs from the market."
1500,7," The case law is not entirely clear as to whether the hybrid restraint analysis is a separate means of satisfying Rice's per se 
violation requirement or another means of addressing Parker state-action immunity under the second prong of Rice. Compare 
Fisher v. City of Berkeley, Cal., 475 U.S. 260, 267-70, 106 S. Ct. 1045, 89 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1986) (concluding that a housing 
ordinance was not a hybrid restraint and therefore not addressing whether the ordinance would be exempt from antitrust scrutiny 
under the Parker state-action doctrine), and KT&G, 535 F.3d at 1133 (declining to address the state-action doctrine after having 
found no hybrid restraint in a case essentially identical to this case), with Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n. v. Midcal Aluminum, 
Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 103-06, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980)  [**17] (addressing concepts that later courts have treated as 
elements of the hybrid restraint analysis as part of discussion of Parker state action immunity, after having found a per se 
violation), and Sanders, 504 F.3d at 911 (finding no per se violation under Rice but addressing Parker state-action immunity 
through a discussion of cases generally associated with the hybrid restraint analysis). "
1501,8," LA. REV. STAT. § 13:5061(6) provides: HN9[
] It would be contrary to the policy of this state if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into 
such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may 
arise without ensuring that the state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted 
culpably. It is thus in the interest of the state to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a 
source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming 
judgment-proof before liability may arise."
1501,9," Since the ASR explicitly aimed, at least in part, at counteracting the competitive advantage that NPMs would enjoy absent 
some mechanism for enforcing per-cigarette costs on NPMs, the analysis does not turn on whether Xcaliber presented sufficient 
evidence of anticompetitive effect to survive summary judgment. Indeed, for purposes of our antitrust analysis, we assume that 
Xcaliber has demonstrated that the ASR increases the costs of NPMs, at least in part, in order to undermine their competitive 
advantage over PMs. "
1502,10," Obvious examples include public utilities, zoning ordinances, and enterprise zones."
1502,11," Although Xcaliber brought suit only against the State, its antitrust theory essentially requires us to find that Louisiana is 
authorizing conduct that would be illegal as a private conspiracy. By asserting a theory that depends on private violations in a 
suit against the State, Xcaliber has muddled the various lines of antitrust authority from the Supreme Court. As a result of this 
confusion, Xcaliber has placed undue emphasis on the State's failure to address the two-prong test established in Midcal. As 
explained in Sanders: A series of Supreme Court cases holds that HN12[
] any action in restraint of trade is only immune [on state-action 
grounds] if it satisfies a two-part test: The anticompetitive policy not only must be (1) ""clearly articulated and affirmatively 
expressed as  [**23] state policy,"" but also must be (2) ""actively supervised by the state itself."" Midcal, 445 U.S. at 105 
(quoting City of Lafayette v. La. Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 410, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978) (plurality 
opinion)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 324 Liquor, 479 U.S. at 343-44; Patrick v. Burget, 486 U.S. 94, 100,

(1992). Other Supreme Court cases, however, explicitly hold that a state's own acts in the antitrust area are always 
immune; these cases suggest that the two-part ""Midcal test"" is only needed to decide whether private conduct pursuant to a 
state statute gets Parker immunity. In other words, a state need not show it ""actively supervises"" private parties, as long as 
the state itself, acting as sovereign, created the restraint of trade. See Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 568-69, 104 S. Ct. 
1989, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984); City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 377-79, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113

applies based on the status of the defendant); Indep. Taxicab Drivers' Employees v. Greater Houston Transp., 760 F.2d 607, 
610 n.5 (5th Cir. 1985) (same). We find the Ninth Circuit's explanation of why Hoover rather than Midcal should apply to cases 
challenging a state's action in passing the MSA and its implementing legislation to be persuasive. See Sanders, 504 F.3d at 
917)18; see also Grand River, 574 F.3d at 939)41. Thus, Xcaliber's arguments that the State is not entitled to the protection of 
the state-action doctrine because it has failed to satisfy both of the Midcal prongs are unavailing. HN13[
] The State is immune 
from antitrust liability unless the passage of the ASR was an attempt to ""give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by 
authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their action is lawful."" Parker, 317 U.S. at 351. "
1503,12," The State has not disputed Xcaliber's claim that joining the MSA would burden Xcaliber's First Amendment rights. We assume 
without deciding that joining the MSA would in fact burden Xcaliber's First Amendment rights. "
1504,13," This reasoning also undermines Xcaliber's complaints about the PMs' ability to withhold disputed payments and the treatment 
of the exempt PMs, which exist regardless of whether or not the ASR is in effect. "

technological barrier at issue or means of circumventing that barrier are not relevant. Rather, the issue before the Court is 
whether there are undisputed facts to establish that such avoidance of technological barriers occurred in the first instance."
1589,25," As Facebook contends in its Amicus Reply, the Court finds that evidence of Power's efforts to circumvent Facebook's 
technical barrier is also relevant to show the necessary mental state for Section 502 liability. (Amicus Reply at 10-11.) Since the 
facts relating to such circumvention efforts are still in dispute, the Court finds that there is also a genuine issue of material fact as 
to whether Defendants possessed the requisite mental state. "

1596,6," 21 U.S.C. § 343-1(b) provides a mechanism by which a state may petition the FDA for an exemption from the FDCA's 
preemption provision. It is not relevant to the instant suit."
1596,7," Plaintiffs alternately refer to vitaminwater as a food or ""dietary supplement."" See, e.g., Sec. Am. Compl. P 15 (referring to 
vitaminwater as a ""dietary supplement beverage.""). Although neither party asserts that this distinction is significant to the present 
suit, it is quite clear that vitaminwater is in fact a food rather than a dietary supplement. See Final Rule, Food Labeling; 
Requirements for Nutrient Content Claims, Health Claims, and Statements of Nutritional Support for Dietary Supplements, 62 
Fed. Reg. 49859, 49862 (Sept. 23, 1997)  [*11] (""whether a product is a dietary supplement or a conventional food will depend 
on how it is labeled. To be a dietary supplement, a product must bear the term 'dietary supplement' as part of its common or 
usual name.""). See also FDA Draft, Guidance for Industry: Factors that Distinguish Liquid Dietary Supplements from Beverages, 
Considerations Regarding Novel Ingredients, and Labeling for Beverages and Other Conventional Foods (December 2009) 
(noting in non-binding recommendation that ""Beverages are conventional foods under the [FDCA]. Even when the label of a 
liquid product characterizes it as a dietary supplement, the product may not in fact be a dietary supplement.""), available at 
http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/ucm192702.htm (last visited July 2, 
2010); see generally Leah A. Satine, Is my Yogurt Lying? Developing and Applying a Framework for Determining Whether 
Wellness Claims on Probiotic Yogurts Mislead, 63 Food & Drug L.J. 537, 545-46 (2008) (noting that the FDA has interpreted the 
category of dietary supplements narrowly in circumstances where a product contains properties of both conventional foods and 
dietary supplements)."
1596,8," The  [*12] FDA has explained that while use of the term ""healthy"" typically constitutes an implied nutrient content claim, it 
could, in some circumstances, constitute a health claim where it is used in reference to a disease or health-related condition. 
See Final Rule, Food Labeling; General Requirements for Health Claims for Food: In the case of the word ""healthy,"" the agency does not believe that the use of this word would normally be a health claim. 
""Healthy"" has a wide variety of meanings in addition to ones that would satisfy the second basic element of a health claim. 
For example, ""healthy"" can certainly imply general nutritional well-being. Thus, while a claim such as ""Eat a diet low in fat 
for a healthy heart"" may be a health claim, ""Eating five fruits or vegetables a day is a good way to a healthy lifestyle"" is not. 
Moreover . . . [the] FDA may also regulate the term ""healthy"" . . . as an implied nutrient content claim."
1596,58," Fed. Reg. 2478-01, 2483-84 (Jan. 6, 1993). "
1598,9," The initial complaint identified numerous additional allegedly misleading statements. See Compl. P 18. Plaintiffs' papers on the 
instant motion suggest that they excluded from the Second Amended Complaint the statements most clearly regulated by the 
FDA so their suit would escape the bar of federal preemption. See infra note 19. Although it would not have altered the outcome 
of the motion, I do not consider the statements plaintiffs excluded from their Second Amended Complaint. See Harris v. City of 
New York, 186 F.3d 243, 249 (2d Cir. 1999) (""It is well established that an amended complaint ordinarily supersedes the original, 
and renders it of no legal effect."" (quoting Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc., 25 F.3d 1124, 1128 (2d Cir. 1994)))."
1598,10," A  [*19] claim to that effect was included in the initial complaint. See Complaint P 5 (alleging that ""certain vitamins purported to 
be contained in vitaminwater beverages are not benefiting consumers the way Defendants' claim (e.g., are incapable of being 
absorbed by the body or fail to maintain a potency between date of bottling and date of consumption).""). "
1599,11," The FDA has taken a similar position. See, e.g., Final Rule, Beverages: Bottled Water, 60 Fed. Reg. 57076, 57120 (Nov. 13, 
1995) (""[I]f the State requirement does the same thing that the Federal law does, even if the words are not exactly the same, 
then it is effectively the same requirement as the Federal requirement  [*23] . . . . the only State requirements that are subject to 
preemption are those that are affirmatively different from the Federal requirements on matters that are covered by section 
403A(a) of the act."")."
1599,12," Plaintiffs contend that defendants' preemption arguments cannot apply to the statement ""vitamins + water = what's in your 
hand"" because it was made on ""in-store advertising"" rather than labeling. See Pl. Br. at 3; Sec. Am. Coml. P 25. That contention 
rests on the erroneous assumption that a statement must be physically affixed to a product to constitute ""labeling.""  [*25] The 
FDCA defines labeling to include ""all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its 
containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article."" 21 U.S.C. § 321(m). The definition of ""accompanying"" has been 
interpreted broadly to include statements not attached to the product itself. See, e.g., Kordel v. U.S., 335 U.S. 345, 350, 69 S. "
1600,," Ct. 106, 93 L. Ed. 52 (1948) (no physical attachment between the label and product is necessary); U.S. v. 24 Bottles Sterling 
Vinegar and Honey Aged in Wood Cider, 338 F.2d 157, 159 (2d Cir. 1964) (""The distinguishing characteristic of a label is that, in 
some manner or another, it is presented to the customer in immediate connection with his view and his purchase of the 
product.""); see generally Louis Altman and Malla Pollack, 1A Callmann on Unfair Comp., Trademarks & Monopolies § 5:9 (4th 
Ed. 2009) (""The original distinction between labels and other advertising matter has . . . been blurred.""); Sarah E. Taylor, and 
Harold J. Feld, Promoting Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals on the Internet, 54 Food & Drug L.J. 423, 446 (1999) (surveying 
case law and concluding ""[i]f the matter is part of an integrated scheme to promote the product,  [*26] with a readily discernible 
nexus between product sales and the matter, the representation will constitute labeling.""). Because the statement ""vitamins + 
water = what's in your hand"" accompanied the sale of vitaminwater, it constitutes a statement made in the ""labeling"" under 21 
U.S.C. § 321(m) and therefore does not enjoy any special exemption from the preemption provision of Section 403A."
1600,13," The statute does not explicitly use the term ""disqualifying nutrient level""; that term is used in the FDA's implementing 
regulations, which are found at 21 C.F.R. § 101.14(a)(4). "
1601,14," This reference quantity, termed ""Reference Amount Customarily Consumed per Eating Occasion,"" is defined in the case of 
beverages such as vitaminwater in 21 C.F.R. § 101.12(b) as 8 fl oz (240 mL). It serves as a mandatory reference quantity for the 
purposes of calculating whether the 10% threshold has been met, but qualifies only as a recommended quantity for the purpose 
of setting serving sizes in the product label. See id. at n.5."
1601,15," These reference quantities encompass two sets of daily recommended nutrient intake values: (1) Reference Daily Intakes 
(""RDIs"") for vitamins and minerals, and (2) Daily Reference Values (""DRVs"") for macronutrients. The relevant RDI's are: 5,000 
International Units of Vitamin A, 60 milligrams of Vitamin C, 1,000 milligrams of Calcium, and 18 milligrams of Iron. See 21 
C.F.R. § 101.9(c)(8)(iv). The relevant DRV's are: 50  [*33] grams of protein and 25 grams of fiber. See 21 C.F.R. § 101.9(c)(9). "
1602,16," The FDA Fortification Policy is itself non-binding but, as described above, is incorporated by reference into binding FDA 
regulations. As the FDA has explained: While it is true that the fortification policy is only a guideline, in the context of new § 101.54(e)(1) (ii), FDA has subjected the 
use of § 104.20 (21 C.F.R. 104.20) to notice and comment rulemaking. Interested persons were given notice that FDA 
intends to use that provision as more than a guideline. Such persons had an opportunity to object . . . . No comments did. 
Therefore, the fact that part 104 (21 CFR part 104) is generally intended to be used as a guideline has no significance here."
1602,58," Fed. Reg. 2302, 2362. The defendants do not contend that the fortification policy is nonbinding."
1602,17," On December 10, 2008, the FDA sent a warning letter to defendant Coca-Cola advising that the FDA considered its product 
Diet Coke Plus, a soft drink fortified with vitamins and minerals, to be misbranded. The FDA's conclusion was based on the fact 
that Diet Coke Plus' use of the word ""plus"" violated 21 C.F.R. 101.54(e) because the addition of vitamins to ""snack foods such 
 [*34] as carbonated beverages"" was contrary to the FDA's fortification policy. See December 10, 2008 FDA Warning Letter to 
Coca Coca available at http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2008/ucm1048050.htm. See generally 
Diet Coke Plus Proves to Be a Minus With the FDA, 16 No. 12 FDA Advertising and Promotion Manual Newsletter 11 (2009)."
1602,18," See, e.g., Pauline M. Ippolito, What Can We Learn From Food Advertising Policy Over the Last 25 Years?, 12 Geo. Mason L. 
Rev. 939, 953 (2004) (explaining that the ""'jelly bean rule' . . . is designed to ensure that an advertiser of jelly beans (or other 
sugar-based products) would not be able to make, for example, a heart disease claim under NLEA rules, even though the 
product is low in fat and saturated fat, and contains no cholesterol, and thus would meet all the other conditions for a heart-
healthy claim.""). "
1603,19," Plaintiffs contend that the statements at issue are neither health claims nor implied nutrient content claims. As a result, they 
further contend, their ""claims are completely outside the scope of the coverage of the FDCA and are [therefore] not preempted."" 
See Pl. Br. at 6-7. In particular, plaintiffs contend that the Second Amended Complaint does not identify any implied nutrient 
content claim because the quoted statements ""do not suggest that vitamins or other nutrients are present in a certain specific 
amount."" Pl. Br. at 7 (emphasis in original). This argument fails because neither the FDCA nor the FDA's implementing regulations require that a statement identify a 
specific nutrient by name or quantity in order to qualify as an implied nutrient-content claim. See, e.g., 21 C.F.R. § 101.65(c)(3) 
(""a claim that a food contains oat bran is a claim that it is a good source of dietary fiber; that a food is made only with vegetable 
oil is a claim that it is low in saturated fat; and that a food contains no oil is a claim that it is fat free.""); 58 Fed. Reg. 2302, 2371 
(Jan. 6, 1993)  [*38] (describing ""contains corn oil"" as implied nutrient content claim that the product is low in fatty acids); 21 
C.F.R. § 101.54(f)(4) (describing ""high in antioxidants"" as nutrient-content claim.). Defendants concede that vitaminwater's label 
contains at least some implied nutrient content claims. See Def. Br. at 8. In addition, as discussed infra, vitaminwater contains at 
least one clear example of a health claim."
1603,20," One additional implied nutrient-content claim containing the word ""healthy"" was included in the initial Complaint: 
VitaminWater's ""multi-v,"" lemonade (vitamin a - zinc) flavor, was described as ""specially formulated with 11 essential vitamins 
and minerals, from vitamin a to zinc, to provide the body with nutrients needed to remain healthy and active."" Compl. P 18. "
1604,21," Although defendants  [*42] have not contended that the above claim constitutes a ""structure/function"" claim, a relatively 
unregulated category of claim that are commonly present on food labels, the language of the claim suggests that it may have 
been drafted with that understanding in mind. As explained below, such a contention would have no merit. The term 
""structure/function"" refers to an exception arising out of the FDCA's definition of the term ""drug."" Because the FDCA defines 
""drugs"" as ""articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease,"" but contains a limited 
exception for food products ""intended to affect the structure or any function of the body,"" see 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1), food (and 
dietary supplement) labels may make claims about the effect a product has on the ""structure or function"" of the body without 
subjecting themselves to the heightened regulations applicable to health claims. See generally Satine, 63 Food & Drug L.J. 537, 
549 (""Because of the absence of regulation for food labeling structure/function claims, they have become one of the biggest 
loopholes in the regime designed to prevent misleading labeling.""); Ilene Ringel Heller, Functional  [*43] Foods: Regulatory and 
Marketing Developments, 56 Food & Drug L.J. 197, 206 (2001) (same); U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, Food Safety: 
Improvements Needed in Overseeing the Safety of Dietary Supplements and ""Functional Foods,"" at 18, 20 (2000) (noting that 
the FDA ""has not clearly defined its standards for structure/function claims[,]. . . has taken no enforcement actions against 
questionable structure/function claims, and that ""[w]hile NLEA requires FDA to rigorously review health claims before authorizing 
their 
use 
on

no 
such 
requirements

claims"") 
available 
at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00156.pdf. Although the border between structure/function claims and health claims is in some 
cases difficult to delineate, the claim on vitaminwater's focus flavor that it may ""reduce the risk of age-related eye disease,"" does 
not present a close question: the product explicitly claims it can reduce the risk of a class of diseases and uses that very word. 
See FDA Guidance for Industry: Structure/Function Claims, Small Entity Compliance Guide, Sec. D (January 9, 2002) (noting

1605,22," Defendants' briefs discuss this issue only in passing. Because federal preemption is ordinarily an affirmative defense to a 
plaintiff's suit, it is defendants' burden to establish the prerequisites for preemption. See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 
U.S. 58, 63, 107 S. Ct. 1542, 95 L. Ed. 2d 55 (1987); see also Williams v. Gerber Prods. Co., 552 F.3d 934, 937 (9th Cir. 
2008) (declining to address untimely preemption defense)."
1605,23, Available at http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI/DRI_Guiding_Principles_Labeling/guiding_principles_labeling_full_report.pdf. 
1606,24," There is no dispute that implied field preemption is inapplicable. See Transcript of Oral Argument on February 5,  [*50] 2010 
(""Tr."") at 8:3-13. See also Lockwood v. Conagra Foods, Inc., 597 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 1032 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (""Congress has 
explicitly stated that it does not intend to occupy the field of food and beverage nutritional labeling; instead, it permits states to 
regulate subject matters covered by the NLEA and its regulations provided that such state laws do not fall within the FDCA's 
express preemption provisions) (emphasis in original); Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 532 (""We resort to principles of implied pre-
emption -- that is, inquiring whether Congress has occupied a particular field with the intent to supplant state law or whether 
state law actually conflicts with federal law -- only when Congress has been silent with respect to pre-emption."") (Blackmun, J., 
concurring) (internal citation omitted)."
1606,25," Defendants contend in a footnote that plaintiffs' claims ""implicate a federal interest embodied in the Dormant Commerce 
Clause"" because ""the burdens of additional labeling requirements would be clearly excessive in relation to the putative local 
benefits, if any, of telling the public something it already knows."" Def. Br. at 15 n.7 (citing Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 
137, 142, 90 S. Ct. 844, 25 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1970)).  [*51] Because plaintiffs' claims are premised on conduct that violates federal 
regulations, the Dormant Commerce Clause is not implicated. Moreover, Pike is inapposite; that case concerned state 
legislation, enacted for the primary purpose of promoting and preserving the reputation of Arizona farmers, which would have 
had the incidental effect of forcing plaintiff, a grower of cantaloupes, to construct a packing plant in Arizona. In concluding the 
burden imposed on interstate commerce exceeded the ""minimal"" interest of the state, the Court explicitly relied on the fact that 
the legislation did not concern the safety of food and was not designed to protect consumers from unfit goods. Id. at 143-46. In 
contrast, the legislation at issue here consists of state regulations that neither appear to be motivated by local protectionism nor 
have the effect of discriminating against out of state businesses in an area in which the states' regulatory interest is indisputable. 
See, e.g., Plumley v. Massachusetts, 155 U.S. 461, 472, 15 S. Ct. 154, 39 L. Ed. 223 (1894) (""If there be any subject over which 
it would seem the states ought to have plenary control . . . it is the protection of the people against fraud and deception in the 
 [*52] sale of food products.""). See generally 79 A.L.R. Fed. 246 Validity, Under Commerce Clause (Art I, § 8, Cl 3), of State 
Statutes Regulating Labeling of Food (2009). "
1607,26," The Center For Science In the Public Interest (""CSPI""), co-counsel for plaintiffs in this suit, sent a petition for proposed 
rulemaking to the FDA in 1999, seeking daily reference values and additional labeling for ""added sugars"" in soft drinks and other 
products, and seeking corresponding changes to nutrient-content and health-claim regulations. See Def. Br. at 10. "
1608,27," Defendants contend that the phrase ""vitamins  [*58] + water = all you need"" does not appear on the label of at least one flavor 
of vitaminwater, and that it is therefore ""impossible for each [plaintiff] to have relied on a set of representations that included it."" 
See Def. Br. at 20 n. 11. Such a fact is not contained in the Second Amended Complaint, and defendants provide no support for 
the quoted statement. When matters outside the pleadings are presented in connection with a motion to dismiss for failure to 
state a claim, ""a district court must either exclude the additional material and decide the motion on the complaint alone or 
convert the motion to one for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 and afford all parties the opportunity to present 
supporting material."" Friedl v. City of New York, 210 F.3d 79, 83 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the 
unsworn nature of the statement and the fact that no discovery has occurred, I decline to convert defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) 
motion into one for summary judgment and disregard defendants' assertion that the quoted language (""vitamins + water + all you 
need"") does not appear on all flavors of vitaminwater."
1608,28," The Second Amended Complaint alleges that each plaintiff  [*59] relied on the name ""vitaminwater"" and the statement 
""vitamins + water = all you need,"" but does not specifically allege which other statements, if any, each plaintiff relied on. Whether 
a consumer could reasonably have been misled by those phrases, even considered alone, cannot properly be decided on a 
motion to dismiss. Accordingly, even assuming the Second Amended Complaint asserts no further basis for plaintiffs' potential 
confusion, dismissal would not be warranted. "
1609,29," The notion that the FDA-mandated nutritional facts would ""cure"" the potentially misleading impression that vitaminwater was a 
healthy beverage (rather than primarily sugar water) is further undermined by the characteristics of the label itself. For example, 
vitaminwater lists its sugar content and calorie total based on the assumption that one 20 ounce bottle contains 2.5 servings. 
This is consistent with FDA regulations, but the defendants could also have chosen to provide a ""per bottle"" calorie and sugar 
total. See 21 C.F.R. § 101.12(b)  [*64] n.5; 21 C.F.R. § 101.9(b)(6) (Packages sold individually that contain 200% or more of the 
applicable reference amount may be labeled as a single serving if the entire contents of the package can reasonably be 
consumed at a single eating occasion). The FDA has recently considered changes to its policies regarding serving size 
designations. See Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, Food Labeling: Serving Sizes of Products That Can Reasonably Be 
Consumed At One Eating Occasion; Updating of Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed; Approaches for Recommending 
Smaller Portion Sizes, 70 Fed. Reg. 17010, 17013 (2005) (""In general, focus group participants thought that having multiple 
servings listed on the label . . . was misleading and confusing.""); see also Laura M. Tarantino, Acting Director, FDA Office of 
Nutritional Products, Labeling and Dietary Supplements, Letter to Food Manufacturers about Accurate Serving Size Declaration 
on Food Products (March 12, 2004) (encouraging manufacturers to label food packages as single-serving where entire contents 
of 
a 
package 
can 
reasonably 
be 
consumed 
at 
a 
single-eating 
occasion), 
available 
at http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/FoodLabelingGuidanceRegulatoryInformation/InspectionCompliance/ 
 [*65] WarningOtherLetters/ucm110234.htm; see generally William Neuman, One Bowl = 2 Servings. F.D.A. May Fix That, NY. 
Times, Feb. 5, 2010 (quoting current and former FDA officials and noting that FDA is considering update to misleading labeling 
regarding serving sizes). "
1610,30," Defendants appear to suggest the court could take judicial notice that vitaminwater tastes sweet because it is ""common sense. 
. . that [in] anything that's packed or loaded with sugar, as the plaintiffs allege here, you can taste the presence of sugar."" Tr. 
5:6-9. I do not consider that assertion to be a fact ""not subject to reasonable dispute"" as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 
201. Numerous products, such as ketchup (for instance) contain added sugar but are not necessarily considered sweet. See 21 
C.F.R. § 155.194(a)(2)(ii) (specifying that a product identified as ""ketchup"" ""catsup"" ""catchup"" must contain sweeteners). "
1611,31," Both parties rely heavily on Ninth Circuit cases regarding the applicability of Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard to 
plaintiffs' California state law claims. Ninth Circuit law does not bind this court with respect to the application of Rule 9(b) in this 
case. There is no dispute that, as a matter of California state law, plaintiffs California claims do not contain fraud as an element. 
Whether plaintiffs' claims must comply with the pleading burdens imposed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) by virtue of the complaint 
""sounding in fraud"" or being ""grounded in fraud"" is an issue of federal law, not state law. See Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. 
Banc of Am. Sec. LLC, 254 F. Supp. 2d 390, 396 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (concluding that ""[t]his Court is required to follow the 
precedent of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit with respect to the interpretation and application  [*70] of Rule 9(b),"" 
regardless of which state's law governs the underlying claim); see also Desiano v. Warner-Lambert & Co., 467 F.3d 85, 91 (2d 
Cir. 2006); Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1102 (9th Cir. 2003) (same). In any event, my conclusion that 
plaintiffs' California claims satisfy Rule 9(b) disposes of this issue."
1611,32," Plaintiffs separately allege claims under California's Business & Professions Code § 17500 et seq. for ""false advertising"" and 
""untrue advertising."" Neither party has attempted to distinguish these two claims, and they are addressed as one here."
1611,33," Plaintiffs contend in the alternative that defendants have violated the ""unlawful conduct"" prong of the UCL through violations of 
California's Sherman law. See Sec. Am. Compl. P 61. Because I find that plaintiffs have adequately pled a violation of the 
""unlawful  [*72] conduct"" prong through violations of California's FAL, I do not address this alternative contention. "
1613,34," Neither party discusses the elements of a claim of unfair competition under California law, an issue that remains somewhat 
unsettled in light of the California Supreme Court's decision in Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular 
Telephone Co., 20 Cal. 4th 163, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 548, 973 P.2d 527 (1999). Cel-Tech rejected the use of ""amorphous"" 
definitions of ""unfair"" (such as the definition in Wilner, supra) and held that  [*79] a claim of unfair business practices requires 
""conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its 
effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition."" Cel-
Tech at 184-85. However, in a footnote, the court explicitly limited its holding to cases filed by business competitors, as opposed 
to consumers. Id at 187 n.12. Subsequent cases have not been uniform in their assessment of whether Cel-Tech altered the 
analysis of a claim of Unfair Business Practices in claims brought by consumers. The better view appears to be that Cel-Tech 
standard is inapplicable in a consumer action, in view of the fact that (1) the opinion's reference to antitrust law is sensible in a 
suit alleging anti-competitive conduct, but makes little sense in a consumer action; and (2) a contrary view would render Cel-
Tech's footnote 12 meaningless. That position is supported by case law in the Ninth Circuit. See, e.g., Lippitt v. Raymond James 
Financial Services, Inc., 340 F.3d 1033, 1043 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing pre-Cel-Tech analysis in consumer UCL case); Nat'l Rural 
Telecommunications Co-op. v. DIRECTV, Inc., 319 F. Supp. 2d 1059, 1075 (CD. Cal. 2003)  [*80] (""The test annunciated in 
Cel-Tech, however, applies only to cases between direct competitors""); see also Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. 
Co., 93 Cal. App. 4th 700, 720, n.23, 113 Cal. Rptr. 2d 399 (2001) (""we are not to read Cel-Tech as suggesting that such a 
restrictive definition of 'unfair' should be applied in the case of an alleged consumer injury""); but see Scripps Clinic v. Superior 
Court, 108 Cal. App. 4th 917, 940, 134 Cal. Rptr. 2d 101 (Cal. Super. Ct. 2003) (contra). "
1614,35," California law also does not require such specificity. As California courts have recognized: ""[w]hen an unfair-competition claim 
is based on an alleged fraudulent business practice -- that is, a practice likely to deceive a reasonable consumer - 'a plaintiff 
need not plead the exact language of every deceptive statement; it is sufficient for [the] plaintiff to describe a scheme to mislead 
customers, and allege that each misrepresentation to each customer conforms to that scheme."" Linear Tech. Corp. v. Applied 
Materials, Inc., 152 Cal. App. 4th 115, 135, 61 Cal. Rptr. 3d 221 (Cal. Ct. App. 2007) (citation omitted)."
1614,36, The Second Amended Complaint cites only Cal. Civ. Code § 1770(a)(7). 
1615,37," Pursuant to Civil Code section 1782, prior to a suit  [*86] for damages under the CLRA, a plaintiff must notify the defendant of 
the alleged violation and allow the defendant an opportunity to remedy it. There is no dispute that this prerequisite has been met. "
1616,38," Defendants have not contended that plaintiffs' NJCFA claims would be preempted or ""subsumed"" by the Products Liability Act 
(""PLA""), N.J.S.A. 2A:58C-1 et seq. (1987), and this opinion therefore does not address whether such a defense would have 
merit under New Jersey law. See, e.g., Vercellono v. Gerber Products Co., No. 09-CV-2350 (DMC), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9477, 
2010 WL 455388, at *6 (D.N.J. 2010) (dismissing CLA claim as preempted by PLA). "
1617,39," Plaintiffs contend that defendants also breached an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Such an allegation is 
not in the Second Amended Complaint. If it were, it would be dismissed. An implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose 
use arises ""[w]here the seller at  [*96] the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are 
required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods."" Potler v. MCP Facilities 
Corp., 471 F. Supp. 1344, 1349 (E.D.N.Y. 1979). Plaintiffs allege that their ""particular purpose"" for purchasing vitaminwater was 
to drink a ""healthy"" beverage. However, the Second Amended Complaint does not allege that defendants knew any particular 
plaintiff purchased vitaminwater for that purpose. Consumers may seek beverages for a variety of purposes; indeed some may 
desire the beverage precisely because it contains high levels of sugar. "

Docket Item Nos. 1735-1736.) The Court STRIKES the Supplemental Declaration as inappropriately filed without leave of the 
Court. Although Plaintiffs suggested at the hearing that discovery should be reopened for a limited purpose of allowing each 
expert to use the new 2007 census data to supplement their reports, the Court did not permit it because discovery has been 
closed and trial has been set for September. Moreover, both sides' experts conceded that the 2007 census data is not granular 
enough to provide sales data for the relevant market because it provides data only for the entire California market. Finally, as 
previously stated, the Court finds that Dr. Sexton's election, without sufficient cause, to not rely on an already available source of 
sales data, namely, the Dodge Report, is detrimental to his own report and opinion. In light of the Court's striking Dr. Sexton's 
Supplemental Declaration, the Court DENIES as moot Defendant NSW's Objections and Motion to Strike Dr. Sexton's 
Supplemental Declaration. (Docket Item No. 1743.)"

1626,24, (NSW's Motion for Summary Judgment Re Antitrust Claims at 9.)
1626,25," Plaintiffs also fail to present any direct evidence of market power. To show market power through direct proof, a plaintiff must 
put forth ""evidence of restricted output and supracompetitive prices, that is direct proof of the injury to competition which a 
competitor with market power may inflict, and thus, of the actual exercise of market power."" Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1421. Here, 
Plaintiffs have not provided any evidence that Defendant NSW has restricted output, causing prices to rise. To the contrary, 
Plaintiffs failed to rebut Dr. Akemann's expert opinion that the barriers into entry into the market are low, which would effective 
prevent Defendant NSW from reducing output. (See Akemann Report at 37-38.)"

1631,42," (Deposition of William D. Spencer, Vol. III at 433:7-19, 452:25-455:9, Brasso Decl., Ex. 3.) Defendant FWS objects to the 
admission of Mr. Spencer's deposition testimony on the grounds that (1) counsel objected to the form of the question and as to 
lack of personal knowledge at the time of the deposition, and (2) the testimony is irrelevant to the issue of Defendant FWS' 
involvement in causing antitrust injury to Plaintiffs. (Defendant FWS' Objections to Evidence Submitted by Plaintiffs in Support of 
Plaintiffs' Opposition to F.W. Spencer's & Son, Inc.'s Motion for Summary Judgment at 7, Docket Item No. 1548.) Upon review of 
the deposition transcript, the Court finds that Mr. Spencer's answer is responsive and does not exhibit any confusion as to what 
was being asked. Furthermore, as the company principal, the Court finds that Mr. Spencer is likely to have personal knowledge 
of Defendant FWS' bidding practices. Finally, the Court finds that the testimony is relevant to establish that Defendant FWS' 
acceptance of Defendant NSW's higher bid was an aberration from regular company policy, which could lead a reasonable juror 
to infer anticompetitive conduct. Accordingly, the Court OVERRULES Defendant FWS' objection with regard to Mr. Spencer's

""FWS' Opposition Re Indemnity,"" Docket Item No. 1500.) Defendant NSW did not oppose Plaintiffs' Motion Re Indemnity. 
(Statement of Non-Opposition by Defendant NSW to Plaintiffs' Motion for Order Regarding Defendants' Claims of Indemnity or 
Contribution, Docket Item No. 1501.)"
1635,61," In its Opposition, Defendant FWS represents that in November 2008, it filed suit in San Mateo Superior Court against 
Defendant NSW on the indemnity provision of a purchaser order implicated in the present case. (FWS' Opposition to Plaintiff's 
Motion for Order Regarding Defendants' Claims of Indemnity or Contribution at 2, Docket Item No. 1500.) Defendant FWS 
further represents that in or about November 2009, it voluntarily dismissed the indemnity lawsuit against Defendant NSW subject 
to a ""standstill agreement."" (Id. at 2-3.)"
1635,62," (Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendant NSW's Motion for an Order for Severance of the Claims Against Defendant FWS or, at a 
Minimum, Severance of Minority Contracting Claims at 1 4, Docket Item No. 1503.) "
1636,63," The documents are: Arup (Bates No. Settlement Agreement 00001-00021); Tempco, Inc. (Bates No. Settlement Agreement 
00022-00027); Affiliated Engineers, Inc. (AEI) (Bates No. Settlement Agreement 00035-00041); and AMEC (produced redacted, 
unexecuted and without Bates Stamp)."
1636,64," Under the First, Second and Third antitrust causes of action, Plaintiffs may try their claims for attempted monopolization and 
exclusive dealing. "
1639,1," Aegis declared bankruptcy, and it was dismissed from the case on December 15, 2009 (Docket No. 22). "
1643,2," It should also be noted that, even if preemption were to result, TILA only preempts state claims based on required written 
information, i.e. on deficient or false TILDS. See, e.g., Kajitani, 647 F. Supp. 2d at 1220. Thus, to the extent that plaintiffs' claims 
for fraud and under the UCL are based on false or misleading oral representations, or false or misleading written representations 
contained in the ARM Note, such claims would not be preempted by TILA at any rate. See id."
1643,3," Defendants also target plaintiffs' ability to state a fraudulent omissions claim against Countrywide. However, since the Largents' 
claim against Countrywide is being dismissed as time-barred, the only fraudulent omissions claim that remains is asserted by the 
Baker and Lowery plaintiffs against RFC. "
1663,1," The CBA agreements  [*6] at issue (""Class Period CBAs"") are: (1) the ""2002 CBA"" covering March 1, 2002 through February 
29, 2004; (2) the ""2004 CBA"" covering March 1, 2004 through February 29, 2006; and (3) the ""2006 CBA"" covering March 1, 
2006 through February 28, 2010."
1663,2," Under the terms of the protective order, for a party to designate a document ""confidential,"" it must have a good faith belief that 
the document ""reflects or discloses its confidential or proprietary information."" To designate something ""highly confidential,"" the 
producing party must believe that the document contains ""extremely sensitive confidential and/or proprietary information."" "
1668,1," This Court's use of the word ""facts"" is solely for purposes of deciding the Motions before it. Kelly v. Curtis, 21 F.3d 1544, 1546 
(11th Cir. 1994) (citation omitted). "
1670,2," This Court notes that sections of the Antitrust Complaint, which is currently filed under seal, are quoted within this Order. See 
Order (Doc. 40, signed April 22, 2010). All material discussed or quoted, however, is substantially similar to the allegations 
contained in the complaint filed in the public record. See Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint  [*10] (Doc. 1-
2, Exhibit 4, filed November 19, 2009)."
1670,3," Trailer Bridge argues that multiple Policy exclusions, including the exclusion for injury arising out of criminal acts, do not apply 
in this case. Id. at 19-25; see Doc. 1-1, Exhibit 1, at 13. Illinois  [*11] National fails to oppose the arguments, and merely claims 
that this Court need not consider their applicability at this time. (Doc. 21 at 31). Thus, for the purposes of this Motion, Illinois 
National has conceded the issue. "
1677,1," ""But-for wages"" are the wages which, according to Ashenfelter, staff nurses would have been paid but-for the alleged 
conspiracy. The but-for wages were computed using his benchmark methodology. "
1678,2," In addition to joining Defendants' Joint Motion for Summary Judgment, Ellis has also separately moved for Summary Judgment 
on alternate grounds. [Docket No. 347/348]. "
1682,3," ""But-for  [**32] wages"" are the wages that Ashenfelter opines the staff nurses would expect to be paid in the absence of the 
alleged conspiracy. "
1683,4," Ashenfelter acknowledges that Defendant Hospitals are  [**34] too small to have any influence over staff nurse wages in the 
national market. "
1697,5," The specific statements to which Plaintiffs object are: (1) ""I have seen no evidence suggesting that such an agreement [to 
suppress nurse wages] existed;"" (2) ""there is no evidence to indicate that non-base wages, much less base wages, were the 
focal point of any alleged conspiracy;"" (3) ""[a]fter reviewing these information exchange documents, I have not found any 
evidence that suggests the presence of an agreement to fix wages or any evidence that rivals punished deviators that 
implemented significant rate increases of the type shown by AMC and NEH;"" and (4) ""[t]here is no evidence that a conspiracy 
was particularly directed at nurses in speciality departments."" Plaintiffs' Memo. at 2. "
1698,6," The specific statements to which Defendants object include: (1) ""The evidence supports the position that the information 
received by Ellis from other hospitals did not form the basis of compensation decisions or negotiation strategies. Nor does it 
appear to have had an incremental impact on such decisions to the detriment of Ellis nurses;"" (2) ""Based on these facts, it 
seems likely that knowledge gained from this informal salary survey led to wage changes [at Ellis] that were higher than would 
otherwise have been negotiated;"" (3) ""Dr. Vistnes has not shown, and I have not found, instances where these information 
exchanges led to Ellis negotiating wages with the NYSNA below that which would have existed but for these exchanges;"" (4) 
""The information received by St. Peter's was not the basis of compensation decisions, although St. Peter's considered certain 
information received. Nor does the information disclosed in these exchanges indicate  [**92] that it had an incremental impact on 
compensation decisions that inured to the detriment of St. Peter's RNs;"" (5) ""There is no evidence or testimony indicating that St. 
Peter's used this information to modify its own shift differential practices in a manner that would have made its nurses worse off 
than without the information received by St. Peter's;"" (6) ""The information received by Seton was not the basis of compensation 
decisions, although Seton considered certain information from these exchanges. I find no evidence to suggest that the 
information subject to these exchanges had an incremental impact on compensation decisions that inured to the detriment of 
Seton RNs;"" (7) ""The information obtained from other hospitals appears to have contributed to Seton's decision to increase RN 
wages to remain market competitive;"" (8) ""Dr. Vistnes has not shown, and I have not found, instances where Seton set RN 
compensation at levels below that which would have existed but for these information exchanges;"" and (9) ""The information 
received by NEH does not appear to have been the basis for any compensation decision other than determining that its wages 
were not at competitive levels and required  [**93] significant increases. I find no evidence to suggest that the information shared 
through these exchanges had an incremental impact on compensation decisions which made NEH's RNs worse off than they 
would have been but for these information exchanges."" Plaintiffs' Memo. at 3-4. "
1704,*," Honorable  [**2] J. William Ditter, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by 
designation. Donna M. Doblick, Esq. "
1705,1," The four Plaintiff companies are: (1) Race Tires America, Inc., a Division of Speciality Tires of America Inc.; (2) Speciality Tires 
of America, Inc.; (3) Speciality Tires of America (Pennsylvania), Inc.; and (4) Speciality Tires of America (Tennessee), LLC. "
1718,2," We also do not overlook the fact that it is the racers and the drivers that ultimately purchase the racing tires. Unlike in Dentsply 
and LePage's, we accordingly are not dealing with the case of a supplier entering exclusive arrangements with retailers, which 
purchase the products at issue for resale to the ultimate customers. It is undeniably troubling that the evidence in the record 
indicates that the interests of at least some of the racers, drivers, and others have evidently diverged from the interests (and 
actions of) the governing sanctioning bodies. For instance, more than one thousand racers, drivers, and other industry 
participants have actually signed STA's ""Declaration in Favor of Competition,"" attacking the single tire formula as a monopolistic 
practice and calling for its replacement. On an even more basic level, it appears clear that, the more a tire supplier offers a 
sanctioning body in terms of financial  [**55] support, the more the racers and drivers have to pay for the tires themselves. At the 
very least, such circumstances further complicate this case, providing at least some support for STA's antitrust claims against 
Hoosier and DMS. We, nevertheless find that such considerations ultimately do not assist STA. As already noted, the financial contributions do 
ultimately benefit the actual tire purchasers, either directly in the form of point funds or indirectly by providing the financial 
resources allowing the sanctioning bodies to function and hold the races in the first place. Furthermore (and as explained in 
more detail in Section III.B.3, infra), the purchasers otherwise remain free to ""vote with their trailers"" by not participating in a 
sanctioning body's races because of its adoption of a single tire rule or its entry into an exclusive deal with Hoosier. We further 
add that no racer or driver has actually joined STA as a Plaintiff in this litigation or otherwise filed an amicus curiae brief in its 
favor. "
1721,3," We specifically note that: (1) from the 1980s to approximately 2005, IMCA required its cars to use the G-60 American Racer 
tire manufactured by STA; (2) in 2006-2007, STA responded,  [**68] without success, to an RFP for an exclusive tire contract 
sent out by WISSOTA; (3) although there was no formal RFP, STA submitted a proposal to ASCS in 2007, in which it offered a 
financial contribution in exchange for exclusivity; (4) STA submitted a bid in response to USAC's RFP, although its bid, among 
other things, did not propose exclusivity; (5) an STA distributor won the bid to be UMP's exclusive tire supplier for certain races 
in 1994 but was then outbid by Hoosier in 1995; (6) after the filing of this lawsuit, STA responded with seemingly non-exclusive 
and ultimately unsuccessful bids to 2007 and 2008 RFPs from DMS; and (7) Lias Tire, an STA distributor, won an exclusive 
agreement with URC and further agreed to pay this sanctioning body $ 14,500.00 to be the single tire at approximately thirty (30) 
events. Furthermore, Hoosier and DMS should not be held legally accountable for STA's recent pattern of submitting ""non-exclusive"" 
bids to the respective sanctioning bodies, even after the sanctioning bodies expressed a desire for an exclusive relationship."
1721,4," All six of STA's claims, including STA's illegal tying claim, were properly dismissed on this ground. "
1723,1, The defendants are referred to jointly as Charter. 
1728,2," If the FCC report, which is relied on in the plaintiff's complaint for the above allegations, is considered, Charter has a 6.2% 
share of the MPVD market nationwide. But, this statistic does little to clarify Charter's market share in the geographic markets in 
which it operates."
1728,3," Simply being one of the largest companies in a market ""says nothing of a firm's ability to affect competition."" Dickson v. 
Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 210 n.20 (4th Cir. 2002);  [*20] see Roy B. Taylor Sales, Inc. v. Hollymatic Corp., 28 F.3d 1379, 
1387 (5th Cir. 1994) (finding that without more, descriptions that the defendant had the ""lead product"" and was the ""market 
leader"" were insufficient to show substantial market power). If the five largest companies each have eight percent of the market 
share, and the remaining competitors six percent each, it cannot be concluded that any one of the five largest companies has a 
predominant market share. See Dickson, 309 F.3d at 210 n.20."
1728,4," The FCC Report heavily relied on by the plaintiff in his complaint seems to confirm that ""[A]lmost all consumers are able to 
obtain programming through over-the-air broadcast television, a cable service, and at least two [direct broadcast satellite] 
providers."""
1728,5," In In re Time Warner, the Southern District of New York dismissed the plaintiff's complaint but granted leave to amend noting 
that two-way communication services might form a separate product that could be classified as the tying product. 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 22369, 2010 WL 882989, at *8. In finding that the plaintiffs had not shown coercion, the court distinguished another case 
where a district court, on similar facts, had found that actual coercion had been alleged because the plaintiffs in that case had 
alleged that they were charged higher fees for CableCARDs than for set-top boxes and the defendant had informed customers 
that CableCARDS were only available through the defendant for a monthly fee. Id. "
