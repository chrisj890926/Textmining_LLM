1007,Judges,"Judges: DANIEL R. DOMÍNGUEZ , U.S. District Judge."
1007,Opinion by,Opinion by: DANIEL R. DOMÍNGUEZ
1013,Counsel,"Counsel: they represent  [**34] able and experienced 
attorneys from both the continental United States and Puerto Rico. Both Plaintiffs' counsel and opposing counsel 
are very experienced attorneys hailing from a variety of prominent law firms. Plaintiffs' counsel has proven 
themselves to be ""honorable litigators devoted to the interests of their clients who [have] vigorously contested the 
case from its inception."" See In re Lupron, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17456, 2005 WL 2006833, at *4. Through 
counsel's skill and ingenuity, counsel has achieved a substantial recovery for the Class. Thus, counsel's caliber and 
experience weighs in favor of Lead Counsel's fee request.
3. The Complexity & Duration of the Litigation
HN6[
] ""The complexity of federal antitrust law is well known"" and ""antitrust class actions 'are notoriously 
complex, protracted, and bitterly fought.'"" In re Visa Check/Mastermoney Antitrust Litig., 297 F. Supp. 2d 503, 510 
(E.D.N.Y. 2003); Id. (citing Weseley v. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, 711 F. Supp. 713, 719 (E.D.N.Y. 1989)). The 
instant case has proved to be no exception. The present matter was complex, involving sophisticated inquiries into 
the antitrust laws which underlie this action and requiring many days of hearings relating to the intricacies  [**35] of 
the Settlements.
However, the Court must note that, even after several years of litigation, the instant case has not yet proceeded to 
the discovery phase. While Lead Counsel is to be commended for achieving a significant settlement without the aid 
of discovery, and thus controlling litigation costs for both sides, the lack of discovery diminishes the complexity and 
duration of the litigation. See In re Keyspan Corp. Sec. Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29068, at *30 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 
25,  [*460]  2005) (awarding 22.5% of the common fund in attorneys' fees where informal discovery was limited to 
the review of public documents and ""did not involve intricate disputes over privilege or other difficult legal issues nor 
did plaintiffs have to undertake special means to procure evidence that was hard to obtain.""); In re Merrill Lynch 
Tyco Research Sec. Litig., 249 F.R.D. 124, 137 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)(also awarding 22.5% of the common fund in 
attorneys' fees where plaintiffs' counsel had ""relative ease of discovery"" as counsel was not ""forced to fight for 
access to documents"" or overcome claims of privilege). Accordingly, the third factor points against an especially 
generous fee request of 33a% in a case  [**36] that settled fully without necessitating any discovery.
4. The Risks of the Litigation
HN7[
] ""Antitrust litigation in general, and class action litigation in particular, is unpredictable....[T]he history of 
antitrust litigation is replete with cases in which antitrust plaintiffs succeeded at trial on liability, but recovered no 
damages, or only negligible damages, at trial, or on appeal."" In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 187 
F.R.D. at 475-476. Further, whenever an attorney takes a case on a contingency basis, as Lead Counsel has done, 
The Court finds that the actual total value of the Settlements is $65,850,000. The actual total value of the Settlements is 
comprised of two components: the cash portion  [**33] of the settlements, $52,250,000, and the value of the base-rate freeze 
option actually selected by Class Members, $13,600,000. HN5[
] When Lead Counsel is requesting to withdraw a portion of 
the settlement fund today for their compensation, the Court finds it imprudent to rely upon a hypothetical and theoretical 
""maximized potential"" value of what the settlement fund may reach on a future date. The Court should be conservative in 
assessing the total value of the settlement fund and base those assessments on actual, tangible benefits that are able to be 
calculated in the present. See Petruzzi's, Inc. v. Darling Delaware Co. Inc., 983 F. Supp. 595, 608 (M.D. Pa.. 1996) (finding 
that ""awarding fees on the basis of a hypothetical 'common fund' in the percentage sought by class counsel would be a perverse 
result."").
14 On September 15, 2010, Lead Counsel commenced mailing the Long-Form Notice and Claim Form to 61,854 potential class 
members. These members were identified from the transactional records provided by the Horizon, Crowley and Sea Star 
Defendants.
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *459; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **32

 
there is always the risk of non-payment. Certainly there are instances where diligent and experienced plaintiffs 
attorneys pour thousands of hours and dollars into their class action case only to recover little or nothing at trial or 
on appeal. See Robbins v. Koger Props. Inc., 116 F.3d 1441 (11th Cir. 1997)(In a securities class action suit, the 
Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed an $81 million jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs, finding that plaintiffs' had 
no proof of loss causation).
The Court finds that Lead Counsel did take a risk pursuing the instant litigation on a contingency basis as there is 
always a risk of not being compensated  [**37] for counsel's time and expenses. In re Fidelity/Micron Sec. Litig., 
No. 95-12676, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21698, 1998 WL 313735, at *3 (D. Mass. June 5, 1998)(""The case involved 
some risk, but that is true of almost any litigation.""). However, the Court determines that Plaintiffs' counsels' level of 
risk was minimal. Lead Counsel filed the instant suit on April 22, 2008, a mere five days after the DOJ announced 
that it had begun investigating cabotage trade, specifically the Puerto Rico trade route on April 17, 2008. (Docket 
No. 1). On that same date, April 17, 2008, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (the ""FBI""), acting at the DOJ's 
behest, executed search warrants and served subpoenas on each of the Horizon Defendants, Sea Star Defendants 
and Crowley Defendants. In order to obtain a search warrant, the DOJ, by definition, had to have probable cause to 
believe that it would obtain evidence of an antitrust violation as a result of executing the search warrant. Such a 
belief must be grounded in reasonably trustworthy information. Several months after this raid, on October 20, 2008, 
five high ranking executives from Horizon Defendants and Sea Star Defendants pled guilty to violating the Sherman 
Antitrust Act and  [**38] provided details of the anti-competitive conspiracy.
Based upon the DOJ's raids of three large businesses, Lead Counsel had a probable basis to believe that there 
were antitrust violations at the time Lead Counsel filed this action. These suspicions would then have been 
confirmed a mere six months later when the five executives pled guilty. Although Plaintiffs' counsel undertook the 
instant action on a contingency fee basis, the investigation by the DOJ, which became public prior to the 
commencement of this litigation, mitigates counsels' risk. Lead Counsel had a strong  [*461]  basis to believe that at 
least some of the Defendants had colluded in violation of antitrust laws based upon the DOJ's conduct. Therefore, 
the Court finds that the risk of litigation factor weighs against granting attorneys' fees under the percentage of the 
fund methodology.
5. The Amount of Time Devoted to the Case by Counsel
Billing more than 30,000 hours, Lead Counsel and members of Plaintiffs' Steering Committee spent significant, but 
not excessive, time prosecuting the instant action. Throughout the pendency of this litigation, Lead Counsel has 
consistently advocated for Plaintiffs' rights and pursued settlement negotiations  [**39] and agreements to the 
benefit of the Class. Generally, Lead Counsel performed legal and factual research, worked with economic experts 
and class representatives, drafted countless briefs and reviewed countless more opposing briefs. More specifically, 
Lead Counsel drafted five class action complaints and had to defend, and prevail, against several well-written and 
prima facie, colorable, non-frivolous motions to dismiss. Even after reaching a settlement agreement, Lead Counsel 
still had to oversee the claims administration process, assist Class Members with their proofs of claim and other 
inquiries as well as handle any appeals to the Settlements. Although Lead Counsel never engaged in formal 
discovery, this factor points in favor of Lead Counsel's fee request.
6. Awards in Similar Cases
HN8[
] The Court finds it useful to turn to objective academic studies in assessing awards in similar cases. Such 
studies provide ""good indicators of what the market would pay for class counsel's services because the [data] 
show[s] what attorneys have been paid in similar cases, and thus what class counsel could have expected when 
they decided to invest their resources in this case."" In re Lawnmower Engine Horsepower Mktg. & Sales Practices 
Litig., 733 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1014 (E.D. Wis. 2010);  [**40] Turner v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc., 472 F. Supp. 2d 830, 
864 (E.D. La. 2007) (District Court looked to academic research ""to determine an average percentage for cases of 
similar magnitude."").
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *460; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **33

 
A recent study analyzing eighteen years of available opinions involving settlements in class action litigation in state 
and federal courts found that the mean and median fees awarded in the First Circuit are 20%. Theodore Eisenberg 
and Geoffrey P. Miller, Attorneys' Fees & Expenses in Class Action Settlements: 1993-2008, 7 J. of Empirical Legal 
Stud. 248 (2010) (Table 4)(""Eisenberg and Miller""). This same study also concluded that, in antitrust cases, the 
mean fee is 22% and that the median fee is 23%. Eisenberg and Miller, Table 5.
Eisenberg and Miller additionally list fee percentages in terms of the amount of the class' recovery in Table 7. The 
instant settlement fund's actual value is $65,850,000, placing it at the high end of Eisenberg and Miller's tranche of 
settlements between $38.3 million and $69.6 million. Eisenberg and Miller, Table 7. In this tier, the mean fee 
percentage for recoveries is 20.5% with a standard deviation of 10%. Thus, a fee in the range of 10.5% or 30.5% 
are reasonable when  [**41] viewed against fee awards in comparable cases. In re Lawnmower Engine, 733 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1014 (stating that Eisenberg and Miller suggest ""that courts view fee requests falling within one 
standard deviation of the mean as generally reasonable unless reasons are shown to question the fee.""); cf. In re 
Relafen, 231 F.R.D. at 80-81 (While welcoming that ""these thorough and objective studies...provide but a starting 
place...the court concludes it would be  [*462]  inappropriate to use a mean — an average — categorized according 
to the size of the settlement fund as the be all and end all of analysis."")(emphasis in the original).
More specifically, the Court investigates fees awarded in other, similar, individual cases within the First Circuit. Lead 
Counsel has cited several cases where fee awards between 30 and 33a% of the available fund were granted. See 
In re Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 300; see also In re Relafen, 231 F.R.D. at 81. However, the Court finds those 
cases distinguishable. In re Thirteen Appeals spanned a significantly longer time than the instant case, and involved 
two hundred and seventy component cases, whereas the instant MDL matter encompasses only approximately 
forty component  [**42] cases. See In re Thirteen Appeals, 56 F.3d at 307. Similarly, the In re Relafen Court found 
that class counsel had put forth ""exceptional efforts"" in litigation that ""required [an] all out effort"" as Class Counsel 
succeeded, in part, in defeating a summary judgment motion. See In re Relafen, 231 F.R.D. at 80. Class counsel in 
In re Relafen also had a ""a mass of discovery,"" including ""hundreds of hours"" consulting with experts, as well as the 
review of ""hundreds of boxes of documents."" Id. (emphasis added). The situation counsel faced in In re Relafen 
simply is not present in the instant litigation.
The Court has also located several cases within this Circuit on the lower end of the spectrum where the District 
Court awarded counsel 20% or less of the fund. See Turabao Med. Ctr. v. Beach, Nos. Civ. 96-2250, 96-8671, 96-
2290, 96-8578, 96-2459, 96-8590, 96-8712 96-4010, 1997 WL 33810581, at *4-5 (D.P.R. Aug. 13, 1997) (awarding 
fees of 20% fees of the fund in a case where there was no formal discovery and no motion practice); In re 
Fidelity/Micron Sec. Litig., No. 95-12676, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21698, 1998 WL 313735, at *3, n.6 (D. Mass. June 
5, 1998)(awarding fees totaling 17.5% of the fund in a case where no significant  [**43] discovery took place), 
remanded on other grounds, 167 F.3d 735; In re Tyco Int'l, Ltd., 535 F. Supp. 2d 249, 254 (D.N.H. 2007) (awarding 
fees amounting to 14.5% of the fund in a case where ""[i]t would be difficult to overstate the volume of discovery in 
this case"" and ""there was ""aggressive, skillfully argued, and unusually challenging motion practice.""); Mazola v. May 
Dept. Stores Co., 1999 WL 1261312, at *3 (D. Mass. Jan. 27, 1999) (Gertner, J.) (unreported opinion), (awarding 
fees of 10% of the fund where plaintiffs' counsel opposed and fought defendants for merely a couple of months. 15).
The Court finds that the award in In re Tyco is not an apt comparison to the present cabotage litigation because In 
re Tyco had a settlement fund more than three times as large as the fund presently at issue. See In re Indep. 
Energy Holdings PLC, No. 00 Civ. 6689, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17090, 2003 WL 22244676, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 
29, 2003) (HN9[
] ""[T]he percentage used in calculating any given fee award must follow a sliding-scale and must 
bear an inverse relationship to the  [**44] amount of the settlement. Otherwise, those law firms who obtain huge 
settlements, whether by happenstance or skill, will be over-compensated to the detriment of the class members 
they represent.""). Excluding In re Tyco, the litigation in the cited cases, as with the matter at hand, did not proceed 
to a formal discovery phase. While Turabao, In re Fidelity, and Mazola are comparable on the lack of formal 
discovery, these cases  [*463]  are less challenging than the instant case in the sense that they were either of a 
shorter duration or contained fewer dispositive motions.
15 The District Court additionally granted plaintiffs' counsel $1.75 million in attorneys' fees to be paid directly by defendant.
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *461; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **40

 
Lead Counsel conceded in their first brief requesting fees that ""[c]ourts in this Circuit frequently have recognized 
that fee awards in common fund cases typically range from 20 to 30 percent."" (Docket No. 836). Hence, the 33a% 
requested by Lead Counsel exceeds the ceiling on typical percentage of the fund awards in the First Circuit. Thus, 
reviewing similar fee awards advocates against granting Lead Counsel's requested award of 33a%, but dissuades 
the Court from approving an award of 20% or less.
7. Public Policy Considerations
The Court's final inquiry centers on the public policy considerations. HN10[
] Class action plaintiffs' attorneys 
 [**45] provide an invaluable service by aggregating the seemingly insignificant harms endured by a large multitude 
into a distinct sum where the collective injury can then become apparent. Due to the expense, time and difficulty of 
pursuing complex litigation, it would likely not be economical for an individual Class Member to pursue such 
litigation on their own. See Alpine Pharma., Inc. v. Chas Pfizer & Co., Inc., 481 F.2d 1045, 1050 (2d Cir. 1973) (""In 
the absence of adequate attorneys' fee awards, many antitrust actions would not be commenced, since the claims 
of individual litigants, when taken separately, often hardly justify the expense of litigation.""); In re Telectronics 
Pacing Sys. Inc., 137 F. Supp. 2d 1029, 1043 (S.D. Ohio 2001) (""Attorneys who take on class action matters serve 
a benefit to society and the judicial process by enabling such small claimants to pool their claims and resources.); 
Mazola, 1999 WL 1261312, at *4 (""The litigation is critical, because it gives voice to relatively small claimants who 
may not be aware of statutory violations or have an avenue to relief.""). These considerations weight in favor of 
granting attorneys' fees under the percentage of the fund  [**46] methodology, as private civil class action litigation 
is an important tool in enforcement of antitrust laws. See Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy, 459 U.S. 248, 262-263, 103 S. Ct. 
608, 74 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1983) (The Supreme Court has previously ""emphasized the importance of the private action 
as a means of furthering the policy goals of certain federal regulatory statutes, including the federal antitrust laws."").
B. Percentage of the Fund Analysis
In weighing all of these factors, the Court cannot approve the 33a% award requested by Lead Counsel. On the one 
hand, the Court notes that counsel has billed tens of thousands of hours in a complex matter and that counsel has 
effectively represented the Class in achieving a favorable and sizable settlement. These considerations, in addition 
to the public policy objectives of preventing collusion in the market place, point towards granting Lead Counsel's fee 
request. On the other hand, however, the Court is more persuaded by the fact that the instant matter settled before 
formal discovery proceedings commenced as discovery is often the most time intensive aspect of any complex 
litigation. Additionally, the Court maintains that attorneys' fee awards reasonably close to 33a% should be reserved 
 [**47] for cases which actually proceed to trial or settle on the eve of trial. The instant case did not even reach the 
discovery phase much less approach a trial date. Furthermore, the Court observes that counsel took almost no risk 
in accepting the instant case. Lead Counsel filed this class action a mere five days after the DOJ's and the FBI's 
raid on several defendants' offices. As a result of these raids, Lead Counsel had reason to believe that there was a 
strong probability  [*464]  that there were antitrust violations. This probability was later increased by the various 
defendants' plea agreements, which accepted antitrust liability in either their personal or official capacity. 16
An influential factor is fee awards granted previously in similar cases. When courts awarded fees of thirty percent or 
greater, the cases are generally longer in duration and more complex than the present case. When courts awarded 
fees of twenty percent or less, the amount of discovery was comparable, but the cases generally were shorter in 
duration and had fewer substantive motions than the present case. Thus, the Court determines that the correct 
16 As mentioned previously, five former employees of the Horizon and Sea Star Defendants entered guilty pleas accepting 
criminal antitrust liability. See United States v. Horizon Lines, LLC, No. 3:11-CR-0071, Second Amended Judgment (D.P.R., Apr. 
28, 2011); United States v. Chisholm, No. 08-cr-00353, Plea Agreement (M.D. Fla., Oct. 20, 2008); United States v. Serra, No. 
08-cr-00349, Plea Agreement (M.D. Fla., Oct. 20, 2008); United States v. Glova, No. 08-cr-00352, Plea Agreement (M.D. Fla., 
Oct. 20, 2008); United  [**48] States v. Gill, No. 08-cr-00351, Plea Agreement (M.D. Fla., Oct. 20, 2008); and United States v. 
Baci, No. 08-cr-00350, Plea Agreement (M.D. Fla., Oct. 20, 2008).

percentage in this matter is between 20% and 30%. In further narrowing down this range, the Court found the 
Eisenberg and Miller study helpful in illuminating that the mean and median fee awards in this Circuit, and in 
antitrust cases in general, are in the low twenty percent range.
Upon careful review, the Court hereby DENIES Lead Counsel's fee request for 33a% and instead finds that an 
award of 23% of the of the total value of the Settlements, or more precisely, $15,145,500, is just. The Court 
concludes that 23% is appropriate particularly where a class action settles before undergoing  [**49] a substantially 
protracted and costly discovery process. The Court reiterates that HN11[
] attorneys' fee awards of 33a% should 
be reserved for cases which proceed to trial or settle on the eve of trial.
C. Lodestar Cross-Check
HN12[
] The First Circuit does not require a court to engage in calculating the lodestar method when awarding 
fees based upon the percentage of the fund method. In re Thirteen, 56 F.3d at 307. Nevertheless, the Court will 
perform the lodestar calculation as the Court finds that it is a pragmatic cross-check to ensure that the Court is not 
creating a windfall for Lead Counsel. See New England Carpenters Health Benefits Fund v. First DataBank, Inc., 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97364, 7-8 (D. Mass. Oct. 20, 2009); Manual for Complex Litigation (Fourth) § 14.122 (2004) 
(""the lodestar is . . . useful as a cross-check on the percentage method . . . .); Mesko v. Cabletron Sys. (In re 
Cabletron Sys. Sec. Litig.), 239 F.R.D. 30, 37 (D.N.H. 2006) (""[I]t is now common practice to use the lodestar as a 
cross-check on the [percentage of the fund] award.""); In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liab. Litig., 553 F. Supp. 2d 442, 485 
(E.D. Pa. 2008); see also Vaughn R. Walker & Ben Horwich, The Ethical Imperatives  [**50] of a Lodestar Cross-
Check: Judicial Misgivings About ""Reasonable Percentage"" Fees in Common Fund Cases, 18 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 
1453, 1468, 1470 (2005) (advocating that courts have an ethical obligation to perform the Lodestar cross-check). 
The lodestar cross-check ensures that fees awarded under the percentage of the fund method are reasonable in 
light of the amount of work counsel actually performed. See Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992) 
(""[T]he lodestar  [*465]  represents ""a presumptively reasonable fee."").
""The lodestar cross-check is performed by multiplying the hours reasonably expended on the matter by the 
reasonable hourly billing rate which then provides the court with the 'lodestar calculation.'"" In re Diet Drugs, 553 F. 
Supp. 2d at 485-486. See Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 293 (1st Cir. 2001) (""In 
implementing this lodestar approach, the judge first calculates the time counsel spent on the case, subtracts 
duplicative, unproductive, or excessive hours, and then applies prevailing rates in the community (taking into 
account the qualifications, experience, and specialized competence of the attorneys involved)""). The proposed fee 
award is  [**51] then divided by the lodestar calculation, resulting in a lodestar multiplier. The lodestar multiplier is 
compared to other multipliers employed in similar cases. If the multiplier is too great, the Court should consider 
reducing its award calculated under the percentage of the fund method. In re Rite Aid Corp. Sec. Litig., 396 F.3d 
294, 306 (3d Cir. 2005).
In the instant matter, Lead Counsel arrived at a lodestar of $13,965,579.75 by multiplying the 30,000 hours 
plaintiffs' counsel expended by their hourly billing rates, 17 which are capped at $600 per hour. 18 Dividing the 
Court's proposed fee of 23% of the total fund, $15,145,500, by the lodestar yields a multiplier of 1.08. This low 
multiplier is certainly within the reasonable range. See In re Relafen, 231 F.R.D. at 82 (""A multiplier of 2.02 is 
17 By dividing the total lodestar by the 30,000 hours billed, the Court calculates that Lead Counsel's average hourly rate is 
approximately $465.
18 Lead Counsel has not provided the Court with detailed billing records supporting its claim of working more than 30,000 hours 
(Docket No. 836). Nevertheless, to save the Court from engaging in mathematical precision or bean-counting when calculating 
the lodestar cross-check, the Court may rely on summaries of hours submitted by counsel and not review actual billing records. 
In re Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 306-307. Based upon the Court's common sense, experience, and familiarity with this case, the Court 
finds that expending over 30,000 billable hours is reasonable in the instant matter. The Court also notes that no party has 
challenged counsels' hours.
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *464; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **48

 
appropriate.""); In re Cendant Corp., 243 F.3d at 742 (holding that a lodestar multiplier of three would be reasonable 
and appropriate); See, e.g., In re TJX Cos. Retail Sec. Breach Litig., 584 F. Supp. 2d 395, 408 (D. Mass. 2008) 
(applying a lodestar multiplier of 1.97); In re Tyco, 535 F. Supp. 2d at 271 (applying a lodestar multiplier of 2.697); 
In re Visa Check, 297 F. Supp. 2d at 524  [**52] (applying a lodestar multiplier of 3.5); see also In re Prudential, 148 
F.3d at 341 (HN13[
] ""[M]ultiples ranging from one to four are frequently awarded in common fund cases when the 
lodestar method is applied."").
The low multiplier of 1.08 indicates the relative closeness of the attorneys' fee calculated under the lodestar method 
and the percentage of the fund method. This lack of disparity confirms that  [**53] the Court's fee award under the 
percentage of the fund method is reasonable and that the fee closely approximates the fair market value for 
counsel's services. The Court finds that the modest enhancement of the lodestar amount of 8%, using the 1.08 
multiplier, is fitting for the same reasons supporting the 23% percentage of the fund award: the lack of formal 
discovery in the litigation and Lead Counsel's lack of risk in undertaking the litigation. These factors mitigate against 
increasing the 23% fee  [*466]  awarded under the percentage of the fund method in order to thus increase the 
multiplier. The Court concludes that a multiplier of 1.08 is appropriate in this matter.
With the lodestar cross-check supporting the Court's award of 23% under the percentage of the fund method, the 
Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Lead Counsel's request for attorneys' fees (Docket Nos. 839 & 
886). The Court hereby awards Lead Counsel fees of 23% of the total value of the Settlements, or more precisely 
$15,145,500. This sum shall be paid from the three settlements with the Horizon, Crowley and Sea Star 
Defendants.
III. Attorneys' Fees for Objectors
HN14[
] Generally in class action suits, once a settlement figure  [**54] has been reached, defendants have little 
interest in how the fund is ultimately appropriated, including what percentage of the fund that plaintiffs' counsel 
receives. At this stage of the litigation, Lead Counsel's interest begins to conflict with the Class Members'. Objectors 
thus aid the Court in assessing plaintiffs' counsels' request for attorneys' fees to ensure that the Class Members' 
interests are protected. See In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Actions, 278 F.3d 175, 202 (3d Cir. 
2002) (J. Rosenn, dissenting with respect to the imposition of sanctions upon objector's counsel)(""The objecting 
lawyer independently can monitor the proposed settlement, costs, and fees for Class Counsel and, thus, aid the 
court in arriving at a fair and just settlement for the members of the class who individually are largely 
unrepresented.""); see also White v. Auerbach, 500 F.2d 822, 828 (2d Cir. 1974) (""[I]t is well settled that objectors 
have a valuable and important role to perform in preventing collusive or otherwise unfavorable settlements."").
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure contemplate the possibility of fees to objectors:
[Rule 23(h)] provides a format for all awards  [**55] of attorney fees and nontaxable costs in connection with a 
class action, [and] not only the award to class counsel. In some situations, there may be a basis for making an 
award to other counsel whose work produced a beneficial result for the class, such as...attorneys who 
represented objectors to a proposed settlement under Rule 23(e) or to the fee motion of class counsel.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h), Advisory Committee Notes to the 2003 Amendments. ""An objector whose arguments result in 
a reduction of attorney-fee and expense awards provides a benefit to the class"" and are thus entitled to attorneys' 
fees. UFCW Local 880-Retail Food v. Newmont Mining Corp., 352 Fed. Appx. 232, 236 (10th Cir. 2009). Objectors 
who do not benefit the class, however, are not entitled to compensation. Id.; see In re Cendant, 404 F.3d at 197 
(""Only those attorneys who confer an independent benefit upon the class will merit compensation.""); Petrovic v. 
Amoco Oil Co., 200 F.3d 1140, 1156 (8th Cir. 1999) (""To recover fees from a common fund, attorneys must 
demonstrate that their services were of some benefit to the fund or enhanced the adversarial process."").
In the instant matter, Objectors request an award of 33a%  [**56] of the three million and fifty thousand dollars 
($3,050,000) they claimed to have secured for the Class Members. (Docket No. 951). Alternatively, Objectors seek 
the same percentage of the approximately three million dollars that the Court awarded to Lead Counsel. In support 
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *465; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **51

 
of this request, Objectors filed motions and affidavits certifying that, collectively, they expended 865.5 hours 
opposing Lead Counsel's requested attorneys  [*467]  fees. 19 (Docket Nos. 992 and 993).
Objectors have played an instrumental role in reviewing Lead Counsel's fees request and creating a benefit of the 
Class. Objectors have also aided the Court in its inquiry into the fairness of the proposed  [**57] settlement. Most 
critically, Objectors opposed the method in which Lead Counsel had initially calculated the base rate freeze option. 
Lead Counsel originally valued the base rate freeze option at $105 million by calculating all the Class Members that 
could potentially elect that option. However, the Objectors persuasively argued that the value of the base rate 
freeze option should be calculated by including only the value of the base rate freeze option actually elected by 
Class Members (Docket Nos. 862 and 875). The Objectors further requested that the Court order Lead Counsel to 
produce the identities of the Class Members that had elected for the base rate freeze option and the volume of their 
cabotage purchases in order to provide a more accurate estimate of the value base rate freeze option (Docket No. 
880).
In response to the Objectors' concerns, Lead Counsel recalculated the total value of the Settlements from 
$157,250,000 to $65,850,000. (Footnotes 8 and 12). With a lower settlement valuation, Lead Counsel lowered their 
fee request from 16% of $157,250,000, which is $25,000,000, to 33a% of $65,850,000, which is $21,950,000. Lead 
Counsel concedes that the lower fee request is ""[b]ecause  [**58] of the objections previously raised by the 
Objectors and the Court's reluctance to compute the award of attorney's fees on [the] basis of benefits not actually 
claimed by Class members."" (Docket No. 910).
The Court recognizes Objectors' valiant efforts in scrutinizing Lead Counsel's proposed attorneys' fee and for 
clarifying that the actual value of the settlement is $65,850,000 and not the $157,250,000 as originally claimed by 
Lead Counsel. The Court determines that the Objector's direct efforts benefitted the Class Members by increasing 
the settlement fund by more than three million dollars. Therefore, the Court finds that Objectors are entitled to 
attorneys' fees. Reynolds v. Beneficial Nat'l Bank, 288 F.3d 277, 288 (7th Cir. 2002) (HN15[
] ""[O]bjectors [must] 
produce an improvement in the settlement worth more than the fee they are seeking; otherwise they have rendered 
no benefit to the class.""); see Vizcaino v. Microsoft Corp., 290 F.3d 1043, 1051 (9th Cir. 2002) (""Because objectors 
did not increase the fund or otherwise substantially benefit the class members, they were not entitled to fees."").
Although the Objectors' efforts benefitted the Class, Objectors' requested award of 33a%, or  [**59] alternatively a 
percentage award equal to Lead Counsel's award, 23%, is clearly excessive. The Court finds this request exorbitant 
for a variety of reasons. First, Objectors substantive participation in this litigation was for a much more limited scope 
and duration than Lead Counsel's. Objectors did not have the responsibility of organizing the Class or defending 
against motions to dismiss or a host of Lead Counsel's other obligations.  [*468]  Second, it was the Court, and not 
the Objectors, that originated the argument that Lead Counsel was engaged in double counting as Class Members 
were not able to select both the base rate freeze option and the cash settlement option. The Court appreciates 
Objectors further development of this argument; however, the Court notes that Objectors are merely expanding 
upon the Court's previously expressed skepticism. Third, Objectors request over a million dollars in fees for billing 
865.5 hours (Docket Nos. 992 and 993) in opposing Lead Counsel's fee request. Were the Court to grant this 
request, Objectors would be compensated at more than $1100 per hour. 20 Accordingly, the Court finds that an 
19 Specifically, Pan American states that their counsel expended 139.5 hours opposing Lead Counsel's request (Docket No. 
992); V. Suarez assert that its counsel expended 272.5 hours (Docket No. 993-1); Carribean Produce's counsel alleges that it 
expended 247.5 hours (Docket No. 993-2); and Central Produce claims that its counsel expended 206 hours (Docket No. 993-3). 
Thus, in total, Objectors billed 865.5 hours for opposing Lead Counsel's fee request.
The Objectors' informative motions are hereby NOTED (Docket Nos. 992 and 993).
20 More precisely, Objectors would receive $1,162.91 per hour. The Court additionally concludes that the Objectors were 
overzealous in spending 865.5 hours for developing their arguments. As the Objectors made identical arguments common to all 
parties and sought an identical remedy, the Objectors should have pooled their resources to craft a single, cogent filing as 
opposed to duplicating their efforts.
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *466; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **56

 
award of 10% is reasonable and appropriate to reflect Objectors'  [**60] time, effort, ingenuity and success in 
increasing the kitty for the benefit of the Class.
Thus, Objectors' request for attorneys' fees (Docket No. 951) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. In 
recognition of the valuable service the Objectors provided by enlarging the settlement fund by more than three 
million dollars to the direct benefit of the Class Members, the Court hereby awards the Objectors 10% of the 
recovered amount, which is three hundred and five thousand dollars ($305,000). This sum shall be paid from the 
three settlements with the Horizon, Crowley and Sea Star Defendants. 21
IV. Incentive Awards
HN16[
] ""Because a named plaintiff is an essential ingredient of any class action, an incentive award can be 
appropriate to encourage or induce an individual to participate in the suit."" In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised 
Price Antitrust Litig., 292 F. Supp. 2d 184, 189 (D. Me. 2003). In re Lupron, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17456, 2005 WL 
2006833, at *7 (""Incentive awards are recognized as serving an important function in promoting class action 
settlements.""). Courts ""routinely approve incentive awards to compensate named plaintiffs for the services they 
provided and the risks they incurred during the course of the class action litigation."" In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate 
Antitrust Litig., 205 F.R.D. 369, 400 (D.D.C. 2002)(internal  [**62] citations and quotations omitted). Additionally, 
courts typically examine the following criteria when assessing incentive awards:
1) the risk to the class representative in commencing suit, both financial and otherwise; 2) the notoriety and 
personal difficulties encountered by the class representative; 3) the amount of time and effort spent by the 
class representative; 4) the duration of the litigation and; 5) the personal benefit (or lack thereof)  [*469]  
enjoyed by the class representative as a result of the litigation.
Swack v. Credit Suisse First Boston, LLC, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75470, 11-12 (D. Mass. Oct. 4, 2006)(internal 
quotations omitted).
Lead Counsel requests that the Court approve incentive awards in the amount of $20,000 for each of the six Class 
Representatives, thereby totaling $120,000. Lead Counsel argues that Class Representatives played a vital role in 
gathering facts, reviewing the complaint and other filings and preparing critical affidavits. While the Court notes the 
named plaintiffs' involvement in advancing the present litigation, the Court finds that the amount of the incentive 
award requested is excessive and unreasonable. 
22 The Class Representatives did not undertake 
 [**63] substantial risk or suffer notoriety or personal hardships by acting as a named plaintiff. There is ""no 
indication that [the Class Representatives] assumed a risk or inconvenience not shared by the other class members 
which is of such magnitude to merit"" an incentive award, and Plaintiffs ""do not provide specific evidence of the 
purported risk's magnitude."" In re Laidlaw Sec. Litigation, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13935, at *9 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 15, 
1992); In re AOL Time Warner ERISA Litig., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79545 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 26, 2007).
21 The Objectors have reached an agreement amongst themselves to divide any fee award based upon the respective volume of 
cabotage purchased by the Objectors from Defendants during the relevant period  [**61] (Docket Nos. 989 and 990). 
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to that V. Suárez, Inc. will receive 57.41% of the award; Caribbean Produce Exchange, Inc. 
will receive 25.49%; Central Produce El Jibarito, Inc. will receive 11.37%; and Pan American will receive 5.36%. The Court will 
uphold this agreement and orders that the Objectors' award be distributed in accordance with these percentages. Accordingly, 
the Court GRANTS the Objector's request (Docket Nos. 989 and 990) and now finds as MOOT the Objector's prior request 
(Docket No. 988).
22 The Court notes that Congress has expressed some skepticism about incentive awards. Congress made the following finding 
in the Class Action Fairness Act: ""Class members often receive little or no benefit from class actions, and are sometimes 
harmed, such as where . . . (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members."" Pub. L. 
No. 109-2, § 2(a)(3), 119 Stat. 4. Additionally, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA) prohibits granting 
incentive awards to class representatives in securities class actions. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(2)(A)(vi).
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *468; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **59

 
Although the Class Representatives invested some  [**64] amount of time to the instant suit by suppling 
documents, reviewing Court filings and executing affidavits, the Class Representatives were not subjected to 
hundreds of interrogatories and countless depositions; in fact, no Class Representative was ever deposed as the 
instant litigation did not proceed to a discovery phase. See Weseley v. Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, 711 F. Supp. 713, 
720 (E.D.N.Y. 1989)(denying incentive award to named plaintiff where plaintiff responded to document requests 
and was deposed, but did not otherwise ""perform any extraordinary services to the class""); In re Residential Doors 
Antitrust Litig., 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4292 (D. Pa. 1998)(granting an incentive award of $ 10,000 to Class 
Representatives where Class Representatives cooperated in producing documents, answering interrogatories, and 
presenting representatives for depositions). Only the fifth factor, the lack of personal benefits obtained by the Class 
Representatives, support a higher incentive award for the Class Representatives.
Giving careful and deliberate consideration to all of these factors, the Class Representatives cannot be said to have 
been an active participant in the litigation to merit $20,000.  [**65] Instead, the Court opines that a $8,000 incentive 
award per Class Representative is much more reasonable considering the level of involvement, time, effort and risk 
the Class Representative expended. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the request for $120,000 in incentive awards 
and GRANTS $8,000 in incentive awards per Class Representative, thereby totally $48,000. This sum shall be paid 
from the three settlements with the Horizon, Crowley and Sea Star Defendants.
 [*470]  V. Costs & Expenses
Lead Counsel has filed itemized, detailed and voluminous supporting evidence relating to the costs allegedly 
incurred (Docket Nos. 960, 964-979, 985, and their supporting exhibits). The Court has carefully reviewed these 
filings as the Court has ""quasi-fiduciary"" duty to Class Members while at the same time exercising its ""wide latitude 
in shaping the contours"" of an award of expenses. See In re Fidelity/Micron Sec. Litig., 167 F.3d 735, 736 (1st Cir. 
1999). Upon careful review, the Court finds that these costs are reasonable and justifiable in light of the scope and 
duration of the litigation. Therefore, the Court hereby GRANTS Lead Counsel's request for expenses and awards 
Lead Counsel $1,035,702.92 in expenses  [**66] (Docket Nos. 960 and 985). This sum shall be paid from the three 
settlements with the Horizon, Crowley and Sea Star Defendants. 23
VI. FAIRNESS, REASONABLENESS & ADEQUACY OF THE SETTLEMENTS
HN17[
] Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court ""may approve a settlement...that 
would bind class members only after a hearing and on finding that the settlement...is fair, reasonable, and 
adequate."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)(C). 24 Although the Court outlined the contours of the Settlements above, out of 
an abundance of caution, the Court makes additional factual findings regarding the fairness, reasonableness, and 
adequacy of the Settlements.
In providing notice to the Class, Lead Counsel mailed 61,854 Long-Form Notices and Claim Forms to Class 
Members identified from Defendants' transactional records. Additionally, a press release was distributed to 
approximately 4,490 major press outlets in the United States and 250 journalists  [**67] in the maritime shipping 
industry. Summary notices were also published in newspapers and magazine in September of 2010. Lead Counsel 
further established a mailing address, a website, and a toll-free telephone number, staffed with both English and 
Spanish speaking operators, where Class Members could obtain further information regarding the proposed 
Settlements.
In crafting the Horizon Settlement Agreement, Lead Counsel received the Horizon Defendants' financial records 
and was thus able to assess their ability or inability to pay a large sum or judgment. Upon close review of these 
23 In accordance with the Class Notice, dated August 25, 2010 (Docket No. 874-1), the Crowley Settlement will not reimburse 
Lead Counsel for more than $250,000 in expenses.
24 The Court held a Final Fairness Hearing on November 18, 2010 (Docket No. 876).
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *469; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **61

 
records, in consultation with a financial expert, Lead Counsel determined that Horizon Defendants' market 
capitalization had dropped almost 90% since 2007 and that Horizon Defendants' were highly leveraged, having 
almost no unencumbered assets. Horizon Defendants also had to obtain a costly amendment to an existing credit 
agreement in order to be able to commit the $20,000,000 cash portion of the Settlement. Moreover, at the request 
of the DOJ, the Court drastically lowered Horizon's criminal fine from $45,000,000 to $15,000,000 out of a concern 
for Horizon's continued viability and its ability to pay restitution  [**68] to the Class Members in the instant matter. 25
 [*471]  Similarly, Lead Counsel received confidential information from Crowley Defendants' concerning their market 
share. Lead Counsel engaged a financial expert to evaluate this information and assess Crowley Defendants' 
portion of any potential damages suffered by the Class. Furthermore, Lead Counsel and Crowley Defendants had 
two mediation sessions with an experienced mediator in  [**69] complex litigation and antitrust matters.
Lead Counsel also held arm's length negotiations with Sea Star Defendants where they vigorously challenged the 
Class' damages claim. Lead Counsel engaged a financial expert and a forensic financial expert to analyze Sea Star 
Defendants' publicly available information as well as confidential internal information provided by Sea Star 
Defendants. Like Horizon Defendants, Sea Star Defendants are highly leveraged, with virtually no unencumbered 
assets. Lead Counsel also conducted two mediation sessions with Sea Star Defendants where Sea Star 
Defendants indicated that there were significant limitations on their ability to a pay a substantial settlement amount. 
Further, Sea Star Defendants are subject to liability from multiple other lawsuits. Moreover, Lead Counsel 
considered the Court's skepticism of Plaintiffs' ability to maintain a claim against one of the Sea Star Defendants, 
Saltchuck Resources, Inc., due to lack of evidence against this particular Defendant.
Regarding Chisholm, a personal, non-corporate co-defendant, Lead Counsel has agreed to dismiss all claims 
against Chisholm under the Chisholm Settlement Agreement. In exchange, Chisholm has  [**70] agreed to fully 
cooperate in aiding Lead Counsel in this, and other related, cabotage litigation. Chisholm's participation significantly 
improved Plaintiffs' ability to prove the extent of the conspiracy. Lead Counsel reviewed Chisholm's financial 
records and based upon his assets and loss of income upon being incarcerated, Lead Counsel concluded that he 
did not have the ability to pay any monetary amount.
The Court echos its previous analysis from when it granted the Settlements preliminary approval on August 25, 
2010. In re Puerto Rican Cabotage Antitrust Litig., 269 F.R.D. at 142 and (Docket Nos. 800 and 801). Therein, the 
Court concluded that the settlement agreements were negotiated at arm's length as the negotiations were ""long and 
arduous, spanning a considerable time-period"" and that a resolution was ""reached after a great deal of dispute 
between the parties as to the terms of the agreements."" (Docket No. 801). The Court also concluded that the 
parties were sufficiently informed by the informal discovery that occurred.
The Final Fairness Hearing assuaged all of the Court's concerns regarding the Settlements themselves (Docket No. 
876). The Court found that the Long-Form Notices  [**71] sent to Class Members were sufficiently clear that Class 
Members had the option of selecting either the base rate freeze or the cash option when opting into the 
Settlements. The Court also determined that the Putative Class Members were provided with adequate information 
to make an educated decision whether or not to opt in or out of the Settlements  [*472]  within allotted the time 
period. The only remaining issue at the conclusion of the Final Fairness Hearing was Plaintiffs' counsel's utilization 
of a maximized potential value of the base-rate freeze option, in conjunction with the cash settlement, to determine 
the size of the fund from which the reasonable attorneys' fee amount could be calculated. (Footnotes 8 and 12).
25 On March 22, 2011, Horizon pled guilty to one count of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Court imposed a criminal 
fine of $45,000,000 to be paid in gradually increasing installments over four years. United States v. Horizon Lines, LLC, No. 
3:11-CR-0071, Judgment (D.P.R., Mar. 22, 2011)(Docket No. 29). The following month, however, the Court reduced Horizon's 
fine, at the request of the United States, by two-thirds to $15,000,000. The $15,000,000 fine is similarly payable in gradual 
installments over four years, in an effort ensure sufficient cash flow to continue operations and to ensure that Horizon would be 
able to compensate the Class. United States v. Horizon Lines, LLC, No. 3:11-CR-0071, Second Amended Judgment (D.P.R., 
Apr. 28, 2011)(Docket No. 37).

A. Grinnell/Tyco Analysis

] The First Circuit has yet to espouse a set of determined factors for assessing the fairness, 
reasonableness, and adequacy of a proposed settlement. Thus, the Court will follow other courts within this Circuit 
that have utilized a modified version of the Grinnell factors set forth by the Second Circuit and adopted by the Third 
Circuit. See In re Tyco, 535 F.Supp.2d at 259-60. The modified Grinnell factors are:
(1) risk, complexity, expense and duration  [**72] of the case; (2) comparison of the proposed settlement with 
the likely result of continued litigation; (3) reaction of the class to the settlement; (4) stage of the litigation and 
the amount of discovery completed; and (5) quality of counsel and conduct during litigation and settlement 
negotiations.
Id.
(1) Risk, Complexity, Expense and Duration of the Case
As the Court has already stated, the present case is a complex antitrust matter that has been pending for more than 
three years; however, the Court notes that the parties have been in settlement negotiations for two of those three 
years. While the present case involved relatively low risk due to the DOJ's investigation, the Defendants' credible 
""filed-rate"" doctrine defense, which may potentially shield Defendants from civil liability, provides heightened risk for 
Lead Counsel. Additionally, the parties' expenses to date have been reasonable, but further litigation will result in 
an exponential rise in litigation costs as the litigants enter into discovery. Following discovery, if Plaintiffs survive 
motions for summary judgment, a trial may take as long as a month, which will likely be followed with a lengthy 
appellate review process.  [**73] This factor is somewhat mixed, but, on the whole, the furculum favors approval of 
the Settlements.
(2) Comparison of the Proposed Settlement with the Likely Result of Continued Litigation
The actual value of the fund, $65,850,000, accounts for approximately 1.583% 26 of the total affected Puerto Rican 
cabotage sales for the relevant period. Other courts have approved settlements with similar percentages. See In re 
Pressure Sensitive Labelstock Antitrust Litig., 584 F. Supp. 2d 697, 702 (M.D. Pa. 2008) (approving the settlement 
where the cash portion of the settlement was approximately 1.5% of total sales); In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 
321 F. Supp. 2d at 627 (approving the settlement where the settlement represented 1.62% of total sales). However, 
the Court finds that the percentage of the settlement relative to the total sales is not a particularly prudent figure in 
assessing the adequacy of the proposed Settlements.
Other courts have  [**74] examined proposed settlements as a percentage of the alleged damages, which is a more 
reliable analysis. See In re Tyco, 535 F. Supp. 2d at 261 (finding that the proposed settlement represented  [*473]  
approximately 27% of the alleged damages which constituted an ""outstanding recovery for the class""). In the instant 
case, Lead Counsel did not estimate the Class' actual damages (Docket No. 540-25), thus, the Court cannot 
calculate what this percentage may be.
As a general rule, the Court is loathe to analyze hypothetical situations such as this one and finds predicting the 
likely result of continued litigation a Sisyphean task. Nevertheless, it is likely that the parties would vigorously litigate 
class certification, liability and damages as well as summary judgment motions in preparation for a complex trial. To 
the best of our knowledge, there are no glaring deficiencies, or smoking guns, in the Plaintiffs' arsenal that may 
substantially inflate or deflate a potential jury verdict. Beyond these broad characterization applicable to most multi-
26 Plaintiffs estimated that Defendants' total volume of commerce of Puerto Rican cabotage to be $4,159,800,000 during the 
relevant period (Docket No. 886-2). The actual value of the Settlements, $65,850,000, divided by this sum is approximately 
1.583%.
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *472; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **71

 
district litigation, the Court's crystal ball is murky and unable to forecast the outcome of summary judgment motions 
not presently before the Court nor  [**75] the precise result of a jury verdict for a trial that has not yet been 
conducted. Accordingly, this factor counsels slightly in favor of approving the Settlements as a means to ending 
what could be protracted and complex litigation with an uncertain result.
(3) Reaction of the Class to the Settlement
The Class's reaction has been very positive. 61,854 notices were sent to the Class Members identified from the 
Defendants' transactional records and press releases were widely disseminated in both English and Spanish. There 
were only three objections to the Settlements and none of the objections challenged the adequacy of the proposed 
settlement amount itself. Two of the objections related to the proposed attorneys' fees and incentive awards, while 
the third objection from INEOS only sought more information in order to decide whether or not to participate in the 
Settlements or opt-out. 27 Three objections, with none of the three challenging the amount of the Settlements, out of 
a potential Class of 61,854, certainly weighs in favor of approval. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A. Inc., 396 
F.3d 96, 118 (2d Cir. 2005) (HN19[
] ""'If only a small number of objections are received,  [**76] that fact can be 
viewed as indicative of the adequacy of the settlement.'"" (quoting 4 Alba Conte & Herbert B. Newberg, Newberg on 
Class Actions § 11.41, at 108 (4th ed. 2002)). However, we note that while ""silence constitutes tacit consent to the 
[settlement] agreement,"" Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Bolger, 2 F.3d 1304, 1313 n.15 (3d Cir. 1993), courts have found that 
a lack of response from the class is typical. See In re Traffic Exec. Ass'n—E. R.Rs., 627 F.2d 631 (2d Cir. 1980) (""A 
substantial lack of response from absentee class members appears to be the norm rather than the exception.""); see 
also Bolger, 2 F.3d at 1313 n.15 (""[P]otential objectors...have an insufficient incentive to contest an unpalatable 
settlement agreement because the cost of contesting exceeds the objector's pro rata benefit."").
(4) Stage of the Litigation & the Amount of Discovery Completed
This case has passed the motion to dismiss phase, but has not yet entered into a formal discovery phase. Lead 
Counsel has, nevertheless, conducted substantial  [**77] informal discovery which included scrutinizing the 
pleadings and filing in the DOJ's parallel criminal cases. Lead Counsel has also engaged an economic expert and a 
forensic financial analyst to ascertain potential  [*474]  damages. Additionally, Defendant Chisholm, a participant in 
the alleged conspiracy, cooperated with Lead Counsel and supplied valuable insider information. Although formal 
discovery did not occur, the Court can still conclude the parties had sufficient information to make a well informed 
decision about the Settlements. See In re Puerto Rican Cabotage Antitrust Litig., 269 F.R.D. at 141 (The Court 
previously found that the ""parties were sufficiently informed by the limited discovery which has occurred in the 
instant case.""). Thus, this factor favors approval of the Settlements.
(5) Quality of Counsel & Conduct During Litigation & Settlement Negotiations
The Court previously addressed this issue when granting preliminary approval to the Settlements. The Court stated 
that:
The negotiations for settlement in the instant case were long and arduous, spanning a considerable time-
period. Further, the settlement agreements were reached after a great deal of dispute between parties as 
 [**78] to the terms of the agreements. Accordingly, the Court finds that the negotiation of the settlement 
agreements indeed occurred at arm's length.
Id. at 141. Based upon the Court's prior finding, this factor also supports approving the Settlements.
27 The Court notes that INEOS, and any other Class Member, retained the option to opt-out of the Class and separately litigate 
against, or settle with, with the Defendants.
815 F. Supp. 2d 448, *473; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113980, **74

 
The Court will also briefly address Defendants' ability to withstand a greater judgment. The evidence shows that 
Horizon and Sea Star Defendants are both experiencing serious financial hardships and are highly leveraged. As 
the Court mentioned previously, Horizon Defendants' had to obtain a costly amendment to an existing credit 
agreement in order to fund the proposed settlement. The Court also notes that as a result of the severity of 
Horizon's financial condition, the Court reduced Horizon's criminal fine, at the request of the United States, from 
$45,000,000 to $15,000,000. 28 These Defendants' precarious financial situation counsel in favor of resolving this 
matter quickly and thus approving the Settlements.
With all of the above factors supporting approval, the Court  [**79] concludes that the proposed Settlement 
Agreements are fair, reasonable, and adequate.
VII. CONCLUSION
The Court has determined awarding Lead Counsel 23% of the total value of the Settlements, $15,145,500, is 
reasonable and appropriate. The Lodestar cross-check supports the Court's fee award. The Objectors have 
performed a valuable service in assessing Lead Counsel's fee request resulting in compensation for each and 
every Class Member. The Court has thus found that the Objectors are entitled to a fee of 10% of the $3,050,000 
they have helped recover for the benefit of the Class. The Court has also approved incentive awards of $8,000 per 
Class Representative, for a total of $48,000, and approved Lead Counsel's request for expenses in the amount of 
$1,035,702.92. Lastly, in compliance with Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court has concluded 
that the proposed Settlements are fair, reasonable, and adequate.
As the Court has determined that the attorneys' fees, costs and expenses are all reasonable for the reasons stated 
above, the Court is now satisfied that the Settlement Agreements are fair, reasonable, and adequate. Thus, the 
Court hereby  [*475]  GRANTS final approval (Docket  [**80] No. 840) to the pending Settlement Agreements for 
the reasons stated above.
IT IS SO ORDERED.

HN1[
]  Complaints, Requirements for Complaint
A court evaluates complaints in light of the plausibility pleading standard articulated in Twombly and reaffirmed in 
Iqbal. According to this standard, a plaintiff must provide allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent 
with) the defendant's liability. However, this standard neither imposes a probability requirement nor requires ultra 
specific factual allegations. Rather, the factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the 
speculative level, or raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the defendant's liability.
Civil Procedure > ... > Pleadings > Complaints > Requirements for Complaint
HN2[
]  Complaints, Requirements for Complaint
Courts use a two-step process when evaluating the facial plausibility of a complaint. First, a court must dispose of 
those allegations not entitled to a presumption of truth, namely, threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of 
action that are supported by mere conclusory statements. A plaintiff may not proceed to discovery on a complaint 
containing only conclusions about the defendant's liability. Even under this standard, however, legal conclusions 
still play a role, albeit a limited one. Specifically, legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint but 
must be supported by factual allegations, and cannot themselves be dressed up as factual allegations. Determining 

 
whether a legal conclusion ""masquerades"" as a factual allegation requires a court to consider whether there exists 
elsewhere in the complaint factual allegations supporting the allegation.

HN3[
]  Complaints, Requirements for Complaint
Courts use a two-step process when evaluating the facial plausibility of a complaint. Second, a court must examine 
those allegations, not swept aside as factually-unsupported legal conclusions, to gauge whether the remaining 
allegations, accepted as true, plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. A plausible claim is not merely 
""possible,"" or ""conceivable,"" but rather permits a court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable 
for the misconduct alleged. A Section 1 claim supported only by allegations of parallel behavior does not permit 
such an inference to be drawn, for alleging parallel decisions to resist competition is not suggestive of a conspiracy.

Though the plausibility pleading standard is undoubtedly a departure from the ""no-set-of-facts"" standard that 
reigned for the half-century following the court's decision in Conley v. Gibson, this standard nonetheless operates 
within a notice pleading regime. A complaint need not contain ""specific facts,"" but in all cases must provide the 
defendant ""fair notice"" of the alleged conduct that renders him liable to the plaintiff. For instance, an antitrust 
defendant is not provided sufficient notice of his role in an alleged conspiratorial agreement spanning a seven-year 
period in which no ""who, where, or when"" allegations are advanced. Likewise, attempting to implicate individual 
defendants in an alleged antitrust conspiracy by referring generally to ""defendants"" will not do if the complaint 
provides ""no clue"" as to the terms of the agreement, or what role each defendant played. Therefore, while specific 
facts, like the ""who, where, or when"" of a claim are not required, to the extent the absence of such allegations fails 
to provide the defendant fair notice of the claims the plaintiff asserts, a plaintiff does not fulfill his Fed. R. Civ. P. 8 
obligation to provide a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.

Discussing the conclusory/non-conclusory divide, Twombly and Iqbal define as conclusory ""bare assertions"" of 
liability, and ""threadbare"" legal statements as being denied a presumption of truth, but not allegations that contain 
factual support.

The plausibility pleading standard does not require a court to construct a mandatory checklist of the ""who, what, 
where, when, and how"" of an antitrust agreement for each defendant. Common sense prevails, and a complaint 
799 F. Supp. 2d 777, *777; 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104419, **104419

 
survives if it contains ""enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made"" among the 
defendants.

HN7[
]  Regulated Practices, Private Actions
Watson Carpet has no application until the existence of an express conspiratorial agreement is determined. But 
because a complaint containing an express conspiratorial agreement does not announce itself, a court must 
examine the complaint as a whole and determine whether such an agreement has been established by direct 
allegations, or if only circumstantial evidence has been offered in which case the allegations must plausibly 
suggest, and not merely be consistent with, a conspiratorial agreement.

]  Regulated Practices, Private Actions
To the extent Watson Carpet articulates a different standard than cases like Twombly and In re Travel Agent, this 
standard only differs as to the consequences that flow from the route a plaintiff chooses to follow when pleading an 
antitrust conspiracy while, of course, leaving the plausibility pleading standard unchanged. Watson Carpet departs 
from Twombly and certain of its progeny because the existence of a well-pled conspiratorial agreement necessarily 
removes the need to determine whether sufficient circumstantial evidence tending to exclude the possibility of 
independent conduct had been presented. The Watson Carpet plaintiff pursued the path of direct allegations to 
establish its entitlement to relief instead of supplying solely inferential allegations, a well-established pleading 
dichotomy. This distinction mirrors the ""crucial question"" for making out an antitrust claim, whether defendant's 
conduct toward plaintiff stemmed from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express.

HN11[
]  Business Torts, Fraud & Misrepresentation
In the Sixth Circuit, a plaintiff alleging fraudulent concealment must plead: 1) defendants concealed the conduct that 
constitutes the cause of action; 2) defendants' concealment prevented plaintiffs from discovering the cause of 
action within the limitations period; and 3) until discovery, plaintiffs exercised due diligence in trying to find out about 
the cause of action.

When facts exist that should excite the suspicions of a reasonably diligent person, a plaintiff that fails to make 
proper inquiries to discover his cause of action will not see the limitations period tolled. By contrast, when no 
information, actual or constructive, exists hinting at the fact of plaintiff's injury, the ""reasonable diligence"" 
requirement seems limited to denying tolling for careless plaintiffs. At bottom, the ""reasonable diligence"" component 
of the fraudulent concealment doctrine requires the plaintiff to show that he neither knew nor, in the exercise of due 
diligence, could reasonably have known of the offense.
