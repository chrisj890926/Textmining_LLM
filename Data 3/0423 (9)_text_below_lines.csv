23,3," Plaintiff's ""First Amended Pleading"" (ECF No. 37) was stricken from the record.  [*6] See Memorandum Opinion and Order 
(ECF No. 52)."
23,4," Individual Defendants are Gary R. Ellis, Lewis I. Rothman, Charles W. Grimes, Ronald O. Perelman, Theo W. Folz, James L. 
Colucci, and George Gershel."
23,5," Plaintiff, in both briefs, has, for the most part, presented the Court with a laundry list of cases in a summary fashion and without 
setting forth any developed analysis or meritorious explanation as to why the Joint Motion of All Defendants should be denied. 
He also restates  [*8] a series of allegations from the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 3) in single-spaced blocks of text. See ECF 
No. 61 at 21-27. Additionally, Plaintiff makes statements that are not on point. For example, Plaintiff writes: ""Opposing counsels' 
arguments that all elements of prima facie case against defendants are lacking is thus not supported by law."" ECF No. 61 at 17. 
No such argument regarding the McDonnell Douglas elements of a prima facie case of discrimination is made in ECF No. 26. "
24,," Finally, Plaintiff seeks to rely on the First Amended Pleading (ECF Nos. 53-1 and 2). See ECF No. 58 at 11. However, the Court 
has not yet ruled on his Motion for Leave to File an Amended Pleading in Lieu of Brief in Response to Defendants' Motions 
Under Rule 12(b) (ECF No. 53). Accordingly, the First Amended Pleading (ECF Nos. 52-1 and 2) is not properly before the 
Court. "
25,6," Defendants Gary R. Ellis, Lewis I. Rothman, Theo W. Folz,  [*12] and James L. Colucci assert that they ""must be dismissed 
from this case with prejudice for lack of personal jurisdiction."" ECF No. 29-1 at 12. A similar assertion is made in Defendant 
George Gershel's motion. See ECF No. 30-1 at 14. A dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction, however, is without prejudice. 
Intera Corp. v. Henderson, 428 F.3d 605. 620 (6th Cir. 2005). "
27,7, http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/pls/bsqry/f?p=100:7:673032241987595::NO:7:P7_CHARTE_R_NUM:1510866
27,8," According to Plaintiff, ""Somya Inc. had effectively assigned all its legal rights and interests in the subject matter of this civil 
action to Rohit Prakash in March 2006."" ECF No. 58-1 at ¶ 6. But, he provides no proof of the assignment. "
30,9," Nor does Plaintiff have standing for his state law claims (Counts 8, 9, and 10) and Count 11 to the extent that the ""derivative 
liability"" against Individual Defendants is based on the Lanham Act."
30,10," Noerr-Pennington immunity principles are derived from the holdings of the United States Supreme Court in Eastern Railroad 
Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight. Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine 
Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
32,11," 47 allegedly ""Cuban"" marks; three other ""Cuban"" marks-ROYAL CUBAN, ROYAL HAVANA  [*36] and HAVANA SWEETS; 
four DUTCH MASTERS marks; DUTCHIES; and, DUTCH TREATS. "
33,12, Plaintiff's only argument in opposition is merely to recite the language of 15 U.S.C. S 1119. See ECF No. 58 at 28. 
35,13," The Clayton Act contains a provision that authorizes service of process on a corporate defendant in any judicial district in 
which the defendant may be found, 15 U.S.C.A. § 22, but that section contains no provision authorizing service on individual 
defendants. Brink's Mat Ltd. v. Diamond, 906 F.2d 1519. 1522 (11th Cir. 1990). "
36,14," 15 U.S.C. § 22 provides: Any suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation may be brought not only in the judicial district 
whereof it is an inhabitant, but also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all process in such 
cases may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, or wherever it may be found (emphasis added). Although this statute provides for nationwide service of process, ""proper venue is still required in order to confer personal 
jurisdiction."" Hyland v. Homeservices of America, Inc., No. 3:05 CV 612 R, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47502, 2007 WL 1959158, at 
*3 (W.D.Ky. June 28, 2007)."
36,15," Ohio courts are deemed to have personal jurisdiction over a person ""as to a cause of action arising from the person's ... 
[c]ausing tortious injury by an act or omission in"" Ohio or from the person's ""[c]ausing tortious injury to any person by a criminal 
act, any element of which takes place in [Ohio], which he commits or in the commission of which he is guilty of complicity."" "
37,," Plaintiff merely recites the language from § 2307.382(A)(7) in ¶ 15 of the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 3). rather than allege 
specific facts concerning any alleged criminal act or element thereof that took place in Ohio. "
39,16," Plaintiff served a summons on Commonwealth Brands, naming it as the agent of Defendant Imperial Tobacco Group PLC for 
accepting service of process. ECF No. 4 at 7-8 and 26. According to Defendant Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, any assertion that 
Commonwealth Brands is Imperial's agent is incorrect. See ECF No. 28-1 at 11 n. 4. "
40,17, Plaintiff agrees that Defendant Imperial Tobacco Group PLC cannot be found in this district. See  [*66] ECF No. 59 at 15. 
41,18, See ECF No. 28-2 at ¶ 7. 
42,19, 18 U.S.C. § 1957(d)(2) provides: The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) are--
42,*," * * that the offense under this section takes place outside the United States and such special jurisdiction, but the defendant is 
a United States person (as defined in section 3077 of this title, but excluding the class described in paragraph (2)(D) of 
such section) (emphasis added)."
42,20," Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2) provides: For a claim that arises under federal law, serving a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction 
over a defendant if: (A) the defendant is not subject to jurisdiction in any state's courts of general jurisdiction; and (B) exercising jurisdiction is consistent with the United States Constitution and laws. "
43,21," Ohio courts are deemed to have personal jurisdiction over a person ""as to a cause of action arising from the person's . . . 
[c]ausing tortious injury by an act or omission in"" Ohio or from the person's ""[c]ausing tortious injury to any person by a criminal 
act, any element of which takes place in [Ohio], which he commits or in the commission of which he is guilty of complicity."" "
45,22," See n. 13, supra. "
46,23, Plaintiff served a summons on Defendant George Gershel in Florida. See Return of Service (ECF No. 10). 
50,24," The RICO allegations in the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 3) merely  [*98] assert in non-factual, conclusory fashion that 
Defendants Cuban Cigar Brands, N.V., Altadis Holdings U.S.A. Inc., and 800-JR Cigar, Inc. illegally owned and/or sold certain 
trademarks and/or illegally derived profits therefrom."
50,25," See n. 13, supra. "
52,26," See Return of Service (ECF No. 4) at 5-6, and 23. "
55,27," Defendant Max Rohr, Inc. was served in Wilmington, Delaware. See Return of Service (ECF No. 21). "
57,28," In their Memorandum in Opposition (ECF No. 54), Defendants argue that ""Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend should be 
denied because Plaintiff has unduly delayed in seeking leave to amend. Defendants submit that Plaintiff seeks leave now in an 
attempt to delay responding to the pending motions to dismiss."" ECF No. 54 at 3. Given the Court's prior ruling, see ECF No. 57, 
this argument is moot. "
66,1," The Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' Claims for Damages Barred by the Statutes of 
Limitations of Various States at Docket No. 331. The Plaintiffs' response is at Docket No. 353, and the Defendants' reply brief is 
at Docket No. 384. The parties also submitted several supplemental  [*2] materials to the Court. The transcript of the oral 
argument on the motion is contained in the record at Docket No. 597."
66,2," Certain claims in the IPSAC are not, or are no longer, subject to this motion. Defendants have not moved to dismiss as time-
barred the Sherman Act claim, the Wisconsin antitrust and unjust enrichment claims, the California unjust enrichment claim, and 
all claims brought under the laws of Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, and West Virginia. See Defs.' Mot. at 3 n.4. Certain 
other claims also are not subject to this motion: those state claims which the Court dismissed by granting in part the Defendants' 
prior Motion—the consumer protection claims arising under the laws of Kansas and New York, the North Dakota unjust 
enrichment claim, and the Plaintiffs' Utah Antitrust Act claim with respect to alleged damages occurring prior to May 1, 2006—
and those claims that Plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew, namely, all claims brought under Maine or Puerto Rico law, and the 
consumer protection claims brought under the laws of Michigan, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. To the extent that the motion sub 
judice sought to dismiss one of these claims that are no longer a part of the case,  [*3] the Court does not address that aspect of 
this motion."
66,3," To the  [*5] extent that the Plaintiffs rely on equitable tolling doctrines other than the fraudulent concealment doctrine for certain 
jurisdictions (such as jurisdictions that recognize multiple equitable tolling doctrines, or those jurisdictions that embrace the 
principles of ""fraudulent concealment"" within the manifolds of another equitable tolling doctrine, such as, by way of example, 
equitable estoppel, or those that might incorporate the discovery rule into the fraudulent concealment doctrine), the parties 
appear to posit that the principles and standards that the Motion places at issue, and as discussed in this Memorandum, as to 
fraudulent concealment are, as a general matter, equally applicable across jurisdictions without consideration for the actual 
doctrine at issue. See, e.g., Tr. at 16-17; 40-43; 54. In light of the Court's ruling here, which focuses on the actual facts pled in "
67,," the IPSAC, the Court need not explore the distinctions between other equitable tolling doctrines and fraudulent concealment 
generally, or specifically as to any particular jurisdiction. Nonetheless, as this litigation proceeds and insofar that jurisdiction-
specific laws on equitable tolling may arise again,  [*6] the parties will need to be explicit as to what doctrine(s) in a given 
jurisdiction are at issue. "
68,4," As will  [*11] be discussed, infra, the parties have not discussed the specific laws of the various jurisdictions at issue with 
respect to this Motion, and, thus, they present no occasion for the Court to consider whether vel non a plaintiff's inquiry notice 
and reasonable diligence are operative principles of fraudulent concealment in those jurisdictions. Of course, to the extent that 
those jurisdictions might not embrace such principles, the Defendants' arguments in favor of the judicial notice of the publications 
would be further diminished."
68,5," As an example, Defendants generally describe this element of fraudulent concealment in two distinct ways: 1) an affirmative act 
""to conceal Plaintiffs' causes of action,"" Defs.' Mot. at 11 (emphasis added); or 2) an affirmative act that ""conceals an element of 
the claim,"" Defs.' Reply at 2 (emphasis added), see also id. at 4-5, 7 (discussing same). Defendants ostensibly take the position "
69,," that there is no meaningful difference between these characterizations. However, Defendants cite case authority as to the 17 
jurisdictions at issue, which, as cited, suggests that many of the jurisdictions take differing approaches to this element—
approaches that do not necessarily conform with the Defendants' singular broad characterization of the element. See Defs.' Mot. 
at 11-12 n.14. The Defendants' cited authorities illustrate that the first element of fraudulent concealment can involve 
consideration of the defendant's conduct in terms of whether the conduct, inter alia, occurred after the wrong transpired, was 
""calculated to operate"" in a certain manner, or was the defendants' ultimate object. Plaintiffs do not raise any targeted objections to the jurisdiction-specific case  [*14] law cited by Defendants. Rather, Plaintiffs 
cite several federal court decisions that generally appear to have addressed matters relating to fraudulent concealment under 
federal law rather than the jurisdictions at issue in their claims. However, in contrast to the Defendants' position, the tenor of the 
Plaintiffs' arguments suggest that the 17 jurisdictions require that the alleged affirmative acts of concealment conceal facts about 
the Defendants' purported conduct as a general matter, rather than concealing facts that give rise to a claim or an element of 
that claim. Indeed, according to Plaintiffs, to establish this element, any facts concealed would merely need to be those that 
would prompt the Plaintiffs' inquiry notice, as opposed to facts that give rise to a cause of action. See, e.g., Tr. at 40 (""Does lying 
about what you are doing to try and calm people to relax, is that a pretextual reason[.] [S]hould that create [grounds for] 
equitable tolling."")."
69,6," Indeed, when the Court asked the parties about the omission of jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analyses in their papers, the parties 
appropriately conceded that a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction analysis would have been appropriate. Tr. at 16:10-11 (responding ""to a 
certain extent, yes"" to the question of whether a state-by-state analysis of the law of concealment is necessary); id. at 43:1 
(remarking that it ""may have been a legal mistake"" not to engage in a state-by-state analysis)."
69,7," See Ulibarri v. Gerstenberger, 178 Ariz. 151, 871 P.2d 698, 709 (Ariz. App. Ct. 1993) (""The wrongful concealment sufficient to

(Utah 1996) (""[W]hen a plaintiff alleges that a defendant took affirmative steps to conceal the plaintiffs cause of action, . . . the

of such action by the person against whom it lies, the period prior to the discovery of such cause of action shall be excluded in 
determining the time limited for the commencement thereof."")."
70,8," The parties agree that in pleading fraudulent concealment the Plaintiffs must meet the requirements of Rule 9(b). See also 
Byrnes v. DeBolt Transfer, Inc., 741 F.2d 620, 626 (3d Cir. 1984) (""We agree,  [*24] of course, that fraud, and thus fraudulent "
71,," concealment, must be pleaded with particularity."" (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and Walters v. Ditzler, 424 Pa. 445, 227 A.2d 833 
(1967)))."
71,9," In light of the Court's ruling here, the Court need not decide at this time whether such alleged facts are material as to each of 
the state claims that Plaintiffs assert. "
72,10," The Court assumes that through this allegation Plaintiffs did not intend to imply that they were contemporaneously aware of 
the alleged conspiracy at the time it supposedly was occurring. It appears that Plaintiffs meant to allege that the ""coordinated 
efforts"" that advanced the conspiracy, to the extent Plaintiffs contemporaneously knew of them, such as the UEP Certification 
Program guidelines, were ""undertaken solely for financial gain and not for humane reasons as Defendants repeatedly claimed."" "
73,11," Insofar that Plaintiffs contend that IPSAC Paragraph 238 falls into this category of allegations that demonstrate the 
Defendants' alleged misrepresentations made in regional newspaper articles, the Court does not consider it sufficient for Rule 
9(b) purposes because it does not contain any direct quote or comment made by a Defendant, but rather entails a generalized 
observation attributable to ""poultry experts."" See id. ¶ 238 (""A December 2008 Star Tribune  [*33] article identified the industry's 
collective actions as the cause of high prices: [T]he most significant influence on pricing may well have been the industry's own 
doing. Over the past two years, after a several-year slump, egg farmers have cut back on the size of their hen flocks at a pace 
not seen in more than 20 years. The result: Fewer hens means fewer eggs, which in turn means higher prices. In dozens of 
interviews, poultry experts point to the industry's move in 2002 to give hens more room as an underlying cause of higher prices. 
The United Egg producers (UEP), the industry's leading trade group, adopted guidelines for hens to have at least 67 square 
inches of space. Many producers used cages of just 50 to 60 square inches."" (alteration in original). "
74,12," Plaintiffs do not argue that the Defendants' statements failed to enumerate all of the various coordinated efforts allegedly 
undertaken to advance the conspiracy, or the existence of the alleged agreement among Defendants, and that omissions of 
such information rise to the level of a misrepresentation. Additionally, no parties have argued whether the Defendants' comments as published in newspaper articles (and ostensibly are 
excerpts from interviews with reporters) can constitute an affirmative act of concealment made by Defendants when the IPSAC 
does not allege that Defendants were the actual authors of the newspaper articles, nor plead any facts to suggest that 
Defendants exercised some control or influence over the drafting of the newspaper articles. "
79,1," Kolon had attempted for several years in the 1990's to develop a commercial para-aramid product. That effort was 
unsuccessful and in 1995 Kolon abandoned the effort. See Sept. 7, 2011 Trade Secrets Case Trial Tr. at 5067 (3:09cv58); 
Kolon's Opp. Permanent Injunction at Exhibit 3 (3:09cv58) (Docket No. 1641). It resumed the effort in approximately 2004. Id."
79,2," The relevant time period begins when Kolon says it first attempted to enter the relevant market and ends on April 20, 2009, the 
date on which Kolon first filed the counterclaim in the Antitrust Case. Kolon does not dispute that the relevant supply agreements 
are those within the January 2006 to April 20, 2009 time frame. See Mem. Opp. Summ. J. at 5 n. 5. Kolon disputes whether it is 
confined to the 2006 to 2009 time period to show its harm for the purposes of damages calculation. That, however, is a moot 
point given that DuPont's motion for summary judgment will be granted. "
80,3," According to DuPont, these three customers were: (1) Goodyear, which rejected Kolon's  [*12] products because of poor 
quality, and which, therefore, did not qualify Kolon's products; (2) Akebono, which sought Kolon's business but was told that 
Kolon did not have sufficient supply; and (3) OFS, which requested bids from Kolon, DuPont, and Teijin for a supply contract, 
and which was told 'by Kolon that Kolon did not have sufficient supply to fulfill the contract and therefore was not submitting a 
bid. Id. at 34-36. "
81,4," DuPont also notes that, even if Kolon could show a monopoly, damages, harm to competition, and foreclosure, it cannot show 
that DuPont's activities were not ""procompetitive."" According to DuPont, market foreclosure can be justified when it is 
""procompetitive."" (citing Chuck's Feed, 810 F.2d at 1294). DuPont claims its supply agreements were economically beneficial, 
ensuring stable supply and pricing. Id. at 44. "
83,5," In 2010, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were revised, and Rule 56(d) replaced Rule 56(f). Committee Notes on Rules - 
2010 Amendments (""Subdivision (d) carries forward without substantial change the provisions of former subdivision (f).""). Rule 
56(f) provided that, if a party, for good reason, could not present facts ""essential to justify the party's opposition,"" the Court could 
stay a summary judgment motion to allow for further discovery."
83,6," The Court waited to address one of the motions upon the request of the parties, who represented that they believed they could 
come to an agreement on the issues therein. The only unresolved issue goes to specific intent, an element of the attempted 
monopolization claim. However, as explained below, the Court has assumed, for purposes of the summary judgment motion, 
that a triable issue of fact on the specific intent element has been made  [*22] out. Thus, any additional discovery Kolon might 
receive before trial helping it prove specific intent would not aid the Court in deciding summary judgment. "
84,7," At one stage in the briefing process, Kolon argued that discovery into the patent litigations between Akzo  [*25] and DuPont 
was relevant to the existence of monopolization. Mem. Supp. Motion to Compel 30(b)(6) at 17 (Docket No. 140). However, that 
conclusory argument was not supported in the Rule 56(d) affidavit. See Opp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 74 ¶ 14. Nor was it ever 
explained sufficiently to warrant allowing the deposition for that purpose. "
85,8, Violations of like kind by other litigants in other cases likely will not be met with as charitably by any judge of this Court. 
86,9," SACC ¶¶ 18, 24; Opp. Summ. J. at 4 (""The relevant market in this case is para-aramid fiber for commercial applications in the 
United States.""). The Fourth Circuit has approved this definition of the relevant market. "
87,10," The Fourth Circuit noted other courts' analysis of entry barriers in its discussion of durability. E.I. du Pont de Nemours, 637 
F.3d at 451."
87,11," See, e.g., Adv. Health-Care Servs. v. Giles Memorial Hosp., 846 F. Supp. 488, 494 (W.D. Va. 1994) (""If the defendants' 
market share is declining and/or other competitors' market shares are rising, then the defendants can hardly possess monopoly 
power.""); Richter Concrete Corp. v. Hilltop Concrete Corp., 691 F.2d 818, 826 (6th Cir. 1982) (noting that a defendant's declining 
market share undermined any ""inference of capacity to monopolize"" that could be drawn from the size of the defendant's market 
share in considering an attempted monopolization claim); United States v. Syufy Enterprises, 903 F.2d 659, 666-70 (9th Cir. 
1990) (emphasizing the importance of evaluating the ability of a defendant to ""maintain"" market share and, after noting the 
defendant's declining market share, affirming the district court's finding that no monopoly power existed); Greyhound Computer 
Corp. v. International Business Machines Corp., 559 F. 2d 488, 496 n. 18 (9th Cir. 1977)  [*38] (noting that declining market 
share ""may reflect an absence of market power""); Alpha Lyracom Space Communs. V. Comsat Corp., 968 F. Supp. 876, 895 
(S.D.N.Y. 1996) (granting defendant's motion for summary judgment after noting that although entry barriers existed, the 
defendant's market share declined rather than increased during the relevant time period). "
88,12," Kolon also argues that DuPont engaged in ""price discrimination"" (sometimes Kolon calls it ""value pricing"") and asserts that the 
fact that DuPont reduced production dramatically in 2009 should raise suspicion. There is no evidence presented here that 
DuPont's use of value pricing supports an inference that it possessed monopoly power. Quite the opposite. Kolon's expert 
admitted that Kolon also engages in the same practice; that it is, in fact, a common practice; that it is not generally an 
anticompetitive practice; and that it can promote efficiency. Reply Mem. Summ. J. at 6, Exhibit 3, Bamberger Tr. 293; id. at 
Exhibit 2, Bamberger Tr. 199-201. With respect to DuPont's decrease in production in 2009, Kolon itself admitted that the United States was facing an economic 
crisis in 2009; that it is not anticompetitive to reduce production when demand decreases; and that Kolon itself had decreased 
sales during the same time period. Id. at Exhibit 2, Bamberger Tr. 45-46; see generally Reply Supp. Summ. J. at 7. And, as with "
89,," value pricing,  [*42] Kolon presented no evidence linking DuPont's decreased production to its claim that DuPont possessed 
monopoly power during the relevant time period."
89,13," See SACC ¶¶ 28-37, 29 (alleging that, from 2006 to 2009, DuPont committed ""various high-volume United States para-aramid 
fiber buyers to multi-year supply agreements that required the customer to purchase  [*43] from 80% to 100% of the customer's 
requirements from DuPont,"" and that, ""[b]ecause Dupont's supply contracts severely restricted access to customers and 
preclude effective competition, DuPont's conduct has had a direct, substantial and adverse effect on competition""); E.I. DuPont 
de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 637 F.3d 435, 451 (4th Cir. 2011) (""As to the second element of a monopolization claim, 
willful maintenance of monopoly power, Kolon's Counterclaim focuses on DuPont's use of essentially exclusive agreements with 
key para-aramid fiber purchasers.""); Opp. Summ. J. at 2 (stating that DuPont attempted to maintain its monopoly power through 
""restrictive, long-term supply agreements""). As was the case with Kolon's market share allegations, its allegations about the 
supply agreements were not borne out in discovery."
89,14," See Chuck's Feed & Seed Co. v. Ralston Purina Co., 810 F.2d 1289, 1295 (4th Cir. 1987) (noting that courts evaluating 
exclusive dealing arrangements also consider: (1) the type of goods and the geographic area; (2) how much of the market has 
been closed off to competing manufacturers because of the exclusive dealing arrangements of the defendant, and, in 
conjunction with this, whether competitors have found or are  [*45] likely to find it difficult to enter or remain in the market; and 
(3) the procompetitive effects of the dealing arrangements that might justify their use). "
90,15," Kolon does not quantify one of those three segments (tires) at all; it fails to address a significant portion of the pulp segment 
(omitting discussion of gaskets), and its analysis of fiber optic cable and the brakes sub-segment of pulp is incomplete and rife 
with false assumptions. Opp. Summ. J. at 9, 12."
90,16," See DuPont, 637 F.3d at 452 n. 12 (noting that, although Kolon had failed to calculate a specific percentage of market 
foreclosure in its SACC, it would not dismiss the counterclaim on that basis because the litigation was in the ""pre-discovery"" 
phase and Kolon had ""insufficient information"" to calculate the percentage at this stage). Of course, discovery is now over and 
Kolon has not done what the law clearly requires it to do. "
91,17," In fact, in its opposition, Kolon impliedly agrees with DuPont's assertion that its supply agreements did not tie up a significant 
portion of the customer base. Opp. Summ. J. at 33 (""[T]hat DuPont did not tie up the entire or even a significant portion of the 
customer base with onerous contracts is irrelevant."")."
91,18," An examination of the summary judgment papers, considering every agreement mentioned by both sides, reveals agreements 
with the following 21 customers to be potentially at issue: AFL, Akebono, OFS, Sumitono,  [*51] Oceaneering, Corning, 
Nisshinbo, Affinia, Garlock, Gates, Goodyear, Avon, Hollingsworth & Vose, Federal Mogul, MW Customer Papers, Toray, Fabric 
Development, Interface, Micro-Coax, Saint Gobain, and Tex Tech. Kolon mentioned in its opposition to summary judgment that it believed contracts existed that had not yet been produced. This 
contention is based on arguments in Kolon's Motion to Compel Production of Documents (Docket No. 133). That motion was 
pending when Kolon filed its opposition brief on December 23, 2011. (Docket No. 275). The Court granted the motion on 
February 22, 2012 (Docket No. 402). Kolon has not since altered its brief on this point. Nor did Kolon thereafter tell the Court that 
DuPont had not supplied all the relevant contracts."
91,19," Even if the relevant market only included DuPont's 400 United States commercial para-aramid customers, the percent of 
foreclosure would be, at most, 5 percent."
91,20," See, e.g., Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibits 63 (Interface), 65 (MW Custom Papers), 67 (Saint-Gobain)."
91,21," See, e.g., Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibits 69 (Affinia Group 100 percent requirements contract); 76 (MW Custom Papers 58 
percent requirements contract); 81 (Federal Mogul 300,000 lbs/year contract)."
91,22," The parties agree that, of the 21, certain agreements did not contain volume requirements. However, they disagree as to the 
number. DuPont claims that nine contracts did not contain volume requirements. Kolon contends that three of these contracts, 
one with Akebono, one with Oceaneering, and one with Fabric Development, were in fact volume requirements contracts. See 
Opp. Summ. J. at 15 n. 25. For the purposes of summary judgment,  [*53] the Court will assume that Kolon's representations are 
correct."
91,23," Goodyear, Corning, and Oceaneering are among those who entered into contracts with obligations that lasted approximately 
one-year during the relevant time period. AFL, Tex Tech, and OFS are among those who had contract-obligations that lasted 
only a few months of the relevant time period. Many of the contracts allowed customers to terminate the contract without cause 
or with a certain amount of notice. See, e.g., Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibits 69 (Affinia group; terminable without cause on 90 
days-notice); 70 (AFL; terminable without cause on 180 days-notice); 72 (Corning; terminable yearly); 76 (MW Custom Papers; 
terminable without cause on 1 year-notice); 82 (Nisshinbo; terminable without cause on 3 months-notice after first year of 
contract); 83 (Nisshinbo (second contract); terminable without cause on 180 days-notice). "
92,24," See, e.g., Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 16, Decl. Jerry Peters, Supply Chain Manager at Gates (explaining that Gates had 
purchased from Teijin, Kolon, and DuPont during the relevant time period, and that decisions were based on pricing); Mem. 
Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 10, Decl. Paul Williams, Prior Purchasing Manager OFS (explaining that OFS has started to purchase 
yarn from Kolon despite DuPont's recent supply agreement with OFS and that OFS did  [*55] not do so previously because 
Kolon did not have adequate supply); see also Mem. Supp. Summ. J. SOF ¶ 47 (uncontested fact) (explaining that Kolon sold 
Heracron to Corning, Garlock, Federal Mogul, and MW Custom Papers during the relevant time period)."
92,25," See, e.g. Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 30, Dep. of David Murphy, Kolon United States sales representative, at 28-29, 
31:17-32:20, 151-152 (explaining that he did not approve sales to Goodyear during the relevant time period, and that Kolon did 
not qualify its product with Goodyear until 2011); Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 12, Decl. of Mr. Jain, Chief Engineer Team 
Leader at Goodyear, ¶ 21 (""Prior to February 2011, Goodyear could not have and would not have purchased Heracron because 
it had not met Goodyear's standards and specifications.""); Opp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 44-A, Aug. 2008 email from Mr. Kang in 
response to Akebono's request for quotations for Heracron (""Several month back, we negotiated with Akebono brake (Japan) for 
long term biz plan and Quality . . . [s]o, we don't have enough room for supplying to Akebono Brake Corporation in North 
America this year.""); Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 96, email from United States Kolon  [*56] sales representative Michael 
Mitchell to OFS (""Thank you for the opportunity to bid on the OFS business . . . unfortunately, all our production capacity for high 
modulus yarn has already been allocated to existing customers.""); see also Seo Dep. Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 56, 140-
41 (""The overall amount to be used by OFS is 255 tons . . . [f]or us, to provide a price for 80 percent of that, that is too much of a 
quantity.""). "
93,26," If this were true, then both Kolon and Teijin would have ""substantially foreclosed"" the market during the relevant time period, 
because both entered into long-term exclusive supply contracts in the para-aramid market during that time frame. See Mem. 
Supp. Summ. J. SOF ¶¶ 22, 47 (uncontested fact). Supply agreements, even in markets with high-entry barriers, have certain advantages for both customers  [*60] and producers. 
In fact, customers often request these agreements to ensure stable pricing and supply. See Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal 
Co., 365 U.S. 320, 334, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961). "
94,27," Kolon cites to two portions of its sales representatives' testimony to support its argument that DuPont's supply agreements 
interfered with its business: (1) Mr. Mitchell testified that he believed that Corning did business only with DuPont and Teijin 
because of supply agreements Corning had with  [*64] them; and (2) Mr. Murphy testified that he was unable to sell Heracron to 
Goodyear because of Goodyear's supply agreement with DuPont. Opp. Summ. J. at 17. However, the records shows both Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Murphy testified that factors other than the supply agreements were 
responsible for their lack of business. Mem. Supp. Summ. J. at Exhibit 7, Mitchell Tr. 84 (explaining that he was not ""aware"" that 
DuPont's or Teijin's contracts limited Kolon's ability to sell in the United States); id. at Exhibit 30, Murphy Tr. 28. (explaining that 
Kolon could not sell to Goodyear during the relevant time period because of qualification and approval issues). During the relevant time period, Kolon acknowledged that, out of approximately 1,000 potential United States commercial para-
aramid customers in the United States, it attempted to qualify Heracron with only nine customers and contacted approximately 
68. See Mem. Supp. Summ. J. SOF ¶ 46 (uncontested fact) (citing Exhibit 97, Kolon's Resp. to 2nd Set of Interrogs., 10/4/09, at 
5-10). Thus, it attempted to qualify Heracron with less than 1 percent of United States customers and actually contacted less 
than 7 percent. The record shows that this  [*65] frail effort, and not DuPont's supply agreements, explains Kolon's low market 
share in the United States."
94,28," It is not necessary to address whether DuPont's activity was ""procompetitive"" since it is clear that DuPont did not have 
monopoly power and since Kolon has not proven foreclosure. "
95,29," It will be assumed for purposes of the motion for summary judgment that there is a triable issue of fact as to whether DuPont 
had specific intent to monopolize the para-aramid market in the United States. Kolon's argument on this point is that DuPont 
discovered the segments of the market that Kolon planned to enter and then implemented supply contracts in order to prevent 
Kolon's entry. See Mem. Opp. Summ. J. at 6-9. Of course, the desire to prevent a competitor from taking one's customers or to prevent the loss of market share is not, in and of 
itself, illegal. The purpose of the antitrust laws is to promote and protect competition, not to thwart it. See Abcor Corp. v. AM Int'l, 
Inc., 916 F.2d 924, 931 (4th Cir. 1990) (citing Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 
(1962)). No competitor can be expected to welcome news of a new entrant in the market. "
96,30," Some of these 11 customers could terminate the contract without cause after a certain period of time, most often one-year, so 
those contracts would likely be considered one-year contracts instead of multi-year contracts. And, some could be considered 
non-exclusive in the sense that they had low volume requirements, only required the buyer not to exceed a maximum amount of 
purchases per year, or only limited purchases of a particular type. However, granting every inference in Kolon's favor for the 
purposes of summary judgment, the Court assumes they could be classified as multi-year contracts."
96,31," Kolon  [*71] has offered no evidence as to why it did not do business in these other segments or as to what percent of the 
market each segment (tires, MRG, aerospace, pulp, etc.) covered. "
97,32," Once Kolon had capacity, Kolon did do business with OFS."
97,33," Corning, Garlock, Federal Mogul, Gates, Akebono, MW Customer Papers, and Goodyear all did business with Kolon during 
the relevant time period. See Mem. Supp. Summ. J. SOF ¶ 47 (uncontested fact); supra n. 24 & n. 25. "
101,1," The selection of the mode of  [*11] analysis to apply to an antitrust claim is a question of law for the court to determine. 
California ex rel. Harris v. Safeway, Inc., 651 F.3d 1118, 1124 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that the selection of the proper mode of 
antitrust analysis is a question of law, to be reviewed de novo on appeal (citing XI Phillip Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, 
Antitrust Law ¶ 1909b, at 279 (2d ed. 2005))); Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of R.I., 373 F.3d 57, 
61 (1st Cir. 2004) (stating that whether a plaintiff's alleged facts comprise a per se claim is normally a question of legal 
characterization that can often be resolved by the judge on a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment); Deutscher Tennis 
Bund, 610 F.3d at 833 (holding that the ""application of the quick look analysis is a question of law to be determined by the court,"" 
and therefore has no application to jury inquiry (citing ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Model Jury Instructions in Civil Antitrust 
Cases A-8 n. 2 (2005)))."
101,2," Comcast's argument about per se liability and regulatory approval is not new. In deciding Comcast's Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we 
rejected - both on initial review and on reconsideration - its argument that the initial Class Complaint failed to state a per se 
violation, finding that the allegations supported a claim that the swap agreements constituted a horizontal market allocation. 
Addressing one of Comcast's  [*13] main arguments, we held that ""[t]he mere fact that regulatory and law enforcement agencies 
may have reviewed and approved the challenged transactions is not ground for dismissal of Plaintiffs' claims."" Glaberson v. 
Comcast Corp., Civ. A. No. 03-6604, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62672, 2006 WL 2559479, at *10 (E.D.Pa. Aug. 31, 2006) modified 
by Glaberson v. Comcast Corp., Civ. A. No. 03-6604, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91990, 2006 WL 3762028 (E.D.Pa. Dec. 19, 2006)

conduct'"" and that ""'[t]here is no general presumption that Congress intends the antitrust laws to be displaced whenever it gives 
an agency regulatory authority over an industry""' (quoting Phonetele, Inc. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 664 F.2d 716, 729 (9th Cir. 
1981))))."
102,3," Comcast argues that because the transactions were not among competitors,  [*14] the entire section 1 claim fails, even if 
analyzed under the rule of reason. We will return to this issue infra."
102,4, All references herein to the Complaint are to the Class's Third Amended Complaint. 
104,5," Hindery wrote that cable systems owning spread out franchises, had always struck me as nonsensical. It was inefficient for cable operators and confusing for customers. I strongly believed 
that the entire industry, including TCI, would benefit enormously by ""clustering"" cable systems into specific markets, with 
one cable operator per market. To make this plan work, however, we'd have to convince other cable operators to voluntarily 
swap systems across the country. This was no small challenge. To pull it off, we'd have to get everybody to agree to basic 
valuations and stick to them. But I knew it was quite doable, provided we could get everybody rowing in the same direction. (Pl. Ex.52 at 73-74.) "
105,6," In his book, Hindery wrote, Comcast, which is based in Philadelphia, had been trying for years to buy Lenfest Communications, which owned the cable 
systems in suburban Philadelphia. Gerry Lenfest, the company's founder and namesake, had always refused to sell. Luckily 
for me, AT&T owned 50 percent of Lenfest. To entice Brian [Roberts] to stand down on MediaOne, I decided to offer him 
Lenfest Communications. . . . I told Brian flat out that he could have Lenfest, and therefore the Philadelphia systems he'd wanted for so long, on one 
condition. He had to promise right then and there not to fight me on MediaOne. He had to agree to take Lenfest as a 
consolation prize and walk away. . . . Brian considered my offer, then extended his had to shake on the deal. (Pl. Ex. 52, Hindery, The Biggest Game of All,  [*29] p. 2.)"
105,7," In response to this evidence, Comcast asserts that the Class's reliance upon the Lenfest transaction to support a per se claim 
of market allocation is improper because the Lenfest transaction was an acquisition transaction, not a swap of cable assets. 
Comcast argues that the Class seeks to mischaracterize the Lenfest sale as a swap because we have previously held that the "
106,," per se claim is limited to the Class's allegations in the Third Amended Complaint that only the swap agreements constituted per 
se violations, while the Class separately alleged that the acquisition agreements were subject to rule of reason analysis. See 
Glaberson, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62672, 2006 WL 2559479, at *9 n.7 (citing Third Amended Complaint ¶¶ 73-74.) Based on the 
Hindery evidence, we find that the Class has met its summary judgment burden to demonstrate a genuine issue of fact whether 
AT&T's agreement to sell the Lenfest assets was an integral part of a broader agreement to swap cable assets between AT&T 
and Comcast."
106,8," We have previously held that non-compete agreements executed upon the sale of a business are generally not recognized as 
antitrust violations, see Class Cert. Mem. at 18-19, and rejected the Class Expert's market structure analysis to the extent he 
relied upon the Lenfest non-compete agreement. (Id.)"
106,9," Michael Doyle, the president of Comcast's Eastern Division, testified that one additional advantage of the clustering, too, is your ability of getting into the new products. In a lot of Comcast 
acquisitions where companies were smaller, they didn't have and didn't spend the capital necessary to offer the new 
products.  [*34] And so certainly the advantage to clustering is you have the resources and you have the personnel who 
can run the new products. And in this day and age, as well as it's been over the last years, it's not a video industry 
anymore. It's a video, Internet, and telephone industry. It's a commercial business application. So, I think the clustering certainly gives you the ability to offer more advanced services to consumers. (Def. Ex. 50, Doyle Dep., 91:12-92:3.) "
107,10," Robert Pick, Comcast's senior vice president of corporate development, testified that the idea of clustering just sort of morphed from the industry. Part of it was competitively driven when you have - when you 
had like the direct broadcast satellite providers come into being. Their footprint by nature is national. They just put a satellite 
up in the air and then the signal can reach most of the country. So when their footprint is national, you know, and we're dealing with small franchises, we obviously cannot compete 
effectively. They can tell one story. They have an upgraded network. They give one channel lineup. They can offer more 
channels. So for us to compete when we're just a particular franchise in a market makes it more difficult.  [*35] It also 
started to develop as the telephone companies got into the business and their - their footprint by nature is much larger than 
ours. And so - and then it just sort of happened when you - you know, TCI at one point in time was the largest cable 
operator in the U.S. and they were financially and operationally stressed at one point in time, so they looked to create 
clusters or they were giving - they've either sold systems or created joint ventures with - with operators where they would 
put the systems, clustered systems, on a local basis and said to an operator, here, you run it, you're better able to run these 
things because of the scale economies within a cluster. (Def. Ex. 54, Pick Dep., 56:6-57:13.)"
107,11," Hindery testified that clustering ""had nothing to do with controlling the market. It had everything to do with putting ourselves in 
an operating cost structure that mirrored as closely as possible our nearest and closest competitors."" (Def. Ex. 51, Hindery Dep., 
132:11-15.)"
107,12," Roberts testified that [t]here was, post-'92, as I have said repeatedly, a desire to take this patchwork of cable systems, and create more sensible 
businesses so we can compete more effectively in the future  [*36] against the oncoming competitors, who all had complete 
DMAs, where in case of satellite, two competitors for every market who had a hundred percent market share in the United 
States. So every home in America can get the product. They [national footprint DBS providers] can run an ad in the middle 
of the Super Bowl, let alone, in local broadcast television. So there was, no question, a lot of desire to try to get larger in markets. (Def. Ex. 56, Roberts Dep., 144:23-145:22.)"
107,13," The FCC stated that Clustering of cable systems can create greater economies of scale and size. Accordingly, it can enable cable operators to 
offer a wider variety of broadband services at lower prices to customers in geographic areas that are larger than single 
cable franchise areas. Clustering can thus make cable operators more effective competitors to LECs whose local service 
areas are usually much larger than a single cable franchise area. The General Accounting Office, in its report on the 
changing status of competition to cable television, also found that ownership ties and clustering strategies may provide cost 
savings and possible competitive advantages. (Def. Ex. 17, FCC 99-418, Sixth Annual Competition Report,  [*37] ¶ 162.) "
108,14," Michael Salinger, Director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Economics, testified before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee on the Time Warner/Comcast/Adelphia transaction that: It was also very clear from the outset that the parties' principal objective in making the acquisition and asset swap was to 
increase ""clustering"" in the TWC and Comcast cable assets. Clustering enables cable firms to realize economies of scale 
associated with providing cable service in contiguous areas. By acquiring contiguous systems, TWC and Comcast could 
lower several categories of costs, such as management, administrative and marketing costs, as well as the expense of 
providing system upgrades. In addition, TWC and Comcast could use clustering to position themselves better to compete 
with local telephone companies and other providers in the delivery of video and telephone service. (Def. Ex. 22, Michael Salinger, Dir. Bureau of Econ., Prepared Statement of the FTC: Sports Programming and Cable 
Distribution: The Comcast/Adelphia/Time Warner Transaction (Dec. 7, 2006), p. 4.) "
112,15," The FCC's Time Warner/Comcast/Adelphia Order stated, in response to an objection to the proposed merger that: In DMAs where both Time Warner and Comcast currently operate, however, they generally do not compete directly for 
subscribers. Their systems usually operate in adjacent franchise areas within a DMA, and consumers do not have the 
ability to choose between them. Accordingly, the elimination of Time Warner's or Comcast's presence in a particular DMA 
does not likely indicate the loss of head-to-head competition. (Def. Ex. 16 ¶ 82.) The Class concedes that the FCC approved the transaction, but contends that neither the FCC's approval nor 
its legal  [*55] conclusion are proper evidence of competition. (Counterstatement of Facts ¶ 33.)"
112,16," In approving the Comcast/AT&T Transaction, the FCC stated: CFA offers no evidence to suggest that AT&T and Comcast would overbuild each other's cable systems such that the 
proposed merger would diminish competition in these local franchise areas. Applicants deny having any intentions to 
overbuild, and confirm that they have not overbuilt in each other's franchise areas, with the exception of the few non-
consolidated affiliate systems. Accordingly, we cannot conclude from the record that AT&T and Comcast had intentions of 
overbuilding each other's local markets, or that they were likely to do so. (Def. Ex. 15 ¶ 94.) In the AT&T/MediaOne order, the FCC found: BellSouth argues that the merger will eliminate current and future MVPD competition between AT&T and MediaOne in local 
areas where the Applicants have overlapping or adjacent cable franchise areas. BellSouth contends that, in the absence of 
the proposed merger, AT&T and MediaOne would build over (""overbuild"") each other's cable systems, thereby offering 
consumers in those areas two MVPD cable choices. However, we find no evidence in the record to suggest  [*56] that 
AT&T and MediaOne would overbuild each other's cable systems such that the proposed merger would diminish 
competition in these local areas. . . . Since the initial acquisition of the Fayetteville and Powder Springs overbuilt systems, the system owners have not 
constructed anymore overbuilds, and there is no evidence to suggest that AT&T and MediaOne would overbuild one 
another absent the merger. AT&T and MediaOne hold overlapping franchise authority in 13 other areas, but have no 
overbuilds in these areas. There is no evidence that they would overbuild each other in these areas absent the merger. We 
find that the proposed merger is unlikely to diminish MVPD competition between the Applicants to a degree that would 
warrant the denial of the Application or the imposition of conditions. (Def. Ex. 14 ¶¶ 94-95.) The Class concedes that the FCC approved the transactions, but contends that neither the FCC's 
approval nor its legal conclusion are proper evidence of competition. (Counterstatement of Facts ¶ 34.) "
113,17," Dr. Williams also notes that a non-compete agreement was executed between Comcast and executives at Prime 
Communications, as part of a loan agreement. (Williams Decl. ¶ 23.) There is no evidence that Prime Communication was 
involved in any of the acquisition or swap transactions."
113,18," The  [*60] Class makes additional arguments that Comcast also competed with other MSOs for original cable franchises and 
engaged in ""benchmark competition"" with other MSOs. We have already rejected these portions of the Class expert's market 
structure analysis. (See Class Cert. Mem. at 18 (rejecting theory of competition for the award of original franchises because all 
awards occurred before the class period); id. at 51-52 (rejecting theory of benchmark competition as not capable of proof at trial 
through common evidence).)"
113,19," Dr. Williams conceded that, in reviewing all of the documents and depositions in the case, he had seen no business plan 
suggesting that Comcast or another MSO was planning to overbuild another MSO in the Philadelphia DMA. (Def. Ex. 59, 
Williams Dep., 105:9-106:18.) "
114,20," See Counterstatement of Facts ¶ 8. The Class cites overbuilding that occurred in New York City (Pl. Ex. 89, Hindery Dep., 
95-96); Dover, Delaware (where Storer Cable, a competitor to a corporate predecessor of Marcus Cable - itself now a Comcast 
corporate predecessor - overbuilt approximately 500 homes) (Pl. Ex. 27 at COM-PA0776597); Terre Haute, Indiana (where 20-
25% of Time Warner's territory had been overbuilt by Charter) (Pl. Ex. 23 at COM-PA1130645); Tampa, Florida (where an 
Adelphia franchise was overbuilt by Time Warner) (Pl. Ex. 35); Kalamazoo, Michigan (where Cablevision overbuilt 
approximately 300 homes served by Adelphia) (Pl. Ex. 40 at COM-PA1835049); Ann Arundel County, Maryland (where 
Millenium Cable and AT&T had overbuilt each other's areas representing 50,000 homes passed) (Pl. Ex. 92 at 294-95; Pl. Ex. 
103 at COM-DOJ273974-75); City of Aventura, Florida (where a Comcast area was overbuilt by Cablevision and Comcast 
overbuilt AT&T areas) (Pl. Ex. 120 at COM-PA1082923); Alameda, California (5,300 homes overbuilt by Comcast) (Pl. Ex. 124 
at  [*65] COM-PA1267909); Newman County, Georgia (18,000 subscribers overbuilt by Charter and Comcast) (Id. at COM-
PA1267922); Oshtemo County, Michigan (Cablevision overbuilt an Adelphia franchise area) (Pl. Ex. 133 at COM-PA1835049); 
Orlando, Florida area (Brighthouse overbuilt an Adelphia franchise area) (Pl. Ex. 106 at COM-PA00011036); Powhatan, 
Virginia (80,000 homes overbuilt by Adelphia) (Pl. Ex. 112 at COM-PA0374859); and Dolthan, Alabama (6,500 homes in a 
Comcast franchise area overbuilt by Time Warner) (Pl. Ex. 125 at COM-PA1382980). "
115,21," We concluded that ""[b]ecause the record evidence shows that consumers throughout the DMA can face similar competitive 
choices and suffer the same alleged antitrust impact resulting from Comcast's clustering conduct in the Philadelphia DMA, we 
find that it can be the appropriate geographic market definition."" (Class Cert. Mem. at 14-15.)"
115,22," We reject Comcast's reliance upon Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc. v. Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc., 546 U.S. 164, 174-75, 126 S. Ct. 
860, 163 L. Ed. 2d 663 (2006) and Feesers, Inc. v. Michael Foods, Inc., 498 F.3d 206, 214 (3d Cir. 2007). Volvo Trucks and 
Feesers were not Sherman Act market allocation cases. Rather they were decisions construing Section 2(a) of the Robinson-
Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a), involving claims of price discrimination by a manufacturer against entities in the market position 
of a wholesaler. See Volvo Trucks, 546 U.S. at 171; Feesers, 498 F.3d at 208-11."
115,23," As we stated in the class certification proceedings, Under the first theory, ""perceived potential competition,"" the Supreme Court held that competition might be diminished if a 
company that industry participants had thought might actually enter the market on its own, instead simply acquired a "
116,," company already in that market. See Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. at 625 (""[T]he Court has interpreted § 7 as 
encompassing what is commonly known as the 'wings effect'- the probability that the acquiring firm prompted premerger 
procompetitive effects within the target market by being perceived by the existing firms in that market as likely to enter de 
novo. . . . The elimination of such present procompetitive effects may render a merger unlawful under § 7.""). Under these 
cases, ""perceived potential competition focuses on the premerger effect on prices of the perception that if profits rise, a new 
company will enter the market and drive down both prices and profits."" Alberta Gas Chemicals Ltd. v. E.I. Du Pont de 
Nemours & Co., 826 F.2d 1235 (3d Cir. 1987). . . . The actual potential competition doctrine has not received a clear stamp of validity  [*71] from the Supreme Court, but other 
courts have applied it where the plaintiff can show: (1) that the relevant market is oligopolistic; (2) that absent the 
acquisition [of the incumbent cable operator], the acquiring company [Comcast] would likely have entered the market in the 
near future either de novo or through a toehold acquisition; and (3) that such entry by the acquiring company [Comcast] 
would carry a substantial likelihood of ultimately producing deconcentration of the market or other significant procompetitive 
effects. Tenneco, Inc. v. FTC, 689 F.2d 346, 352 (2d Cir. 1982) (citing Marine Bancorporation, 418 U.S. at 630, 633). Behrend v. Comcast, 245 F.R.D. 195, 207 (E.D. Pa. 2007)."
116,24," We also find that the Class, to the extent that it raises the issues, cannot rely upon other forms of competition identified by its 
expert Dr. Williams, namely benchmark competition, competition for original cable franchises, and competition for bargaining 
power with programming content providers, which we have previously rejected as unsupported by evidence common to the 
class."
116,25," Section 2 of the Sherman Act states: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire 
with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign 
nations"" is guilty of an offense and subject to penalties. 15 U.S.C. § 2."
116,26," Comcast argues with respect to both claims that the Class has failed to show predatory conduct. Accordingly, our analysis of 
the two section 2 claims is identical for the purposes of the Motion. "
117,27," In the class certification proceedings, we rejected two other theories presented by the Class to demonstrate predatory 
conduct. We rejected the Class's assertion that Comcast's anti-RCN lobbying activity could be used as proof of predatory 
conduct, because it was at odds with the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.  [*74] (Class Cert. Mem. at 46 (citing Eastern R.R. 
Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United Mine Workers of 
Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965) (holding that an individual is immune from antitrust 
liability for exercising First Amendment right to petition the government)).) We also extensively discussed the issue of Comcast's 
conduct in denying access to its DBS competitors to CSN Philadelphia in the last class certification opinion, which was based on 
the same record currently before us on summary judgment. We rejected Dr. Williams' and Dr. Singer's opinions tying Comcast's 
clustering activity in the Philadelphia DMA to reduced DBS penetration rates as susceptible to proof at trial through available 
evidence common to the class. (Id. at 26-28.) In its summary judgment brief and in its Counterstatement of Facts, the Class 
concedes that these issues have been rejected and does not reraise them, other than to preserve an objection to the prior 
rulings."
117,28," To determine whether there exists a viable claim of monopolization or attempted monopolization, a court must inquire into the 
relevant product and geographic market. Spectrum Sports, Inc., 506 U.S. at 459.  [*76] We have already held in the class 
certification proceeding that the Class can establish through common evidence its definitions that the relevant product market is 
the provision of multichannel video programming service (""MVPS"") and the relevant geographic market is the Philadelphia DMA. 
For the purposes of its summary judgment motion, Comcast does not challenge these definitions. "
118,29," Kintner explains, In considering exclusionary practices, it is critical to bear in mind that all competition excludes. Every act of innovation, price 
cutting, new entry or expanded output harms competitors, excluding them from some part of the market, sometimes to the 
point of destruction. But the antitrust laws actively promote this kind of harm to  [*79] competitors. . . . [I]t is only when firms 
engage in practices that are inefficiently exclusionary - practices that predictably will lead to lower output and higher prices 
by reducing competition in the market as a whole - that antitrust law may intervene to enjoin or penalize the conduct."
118,2," Kintner, Federal Antitrust Law, § 14.14."
118,30," At least one court has held that the question is not whether the business justification is sufficient, but merely whether 
defendant establishes it had one. Bell v. Dow Chem. Co., 847 F.2d 1179, 1186 (5th Cir. 1988) (stating that the Supreme Court's 
decision in Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 597, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985) 
""does not hold that a jury can weigh the sufficiency of a legitimate business justification against the anticompetitive effects of a 
refusal to deal in or order to find intent by a defendant to monopolize. . . . The fact determination that may be left to a jury is 
whether the defendant has a legitimate business reason for its refusal, not whether that reason is sufficient. The Aspen jury 
presumably found all of [defendant's] business justifications to be unpersuasive, not persuasive but insufficient."")."
118,31," We note that in Microsoft  [*80] the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit offered an alternative 
route to demonstrating that the conduct was predatory, holding that ""if the monopolist's procompetitive justification stands 
unrebutted, then the plaintiff must demonstrate that the anticompetitive harm of the conduct outweighs the procompetitive 
benefit."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 59; see also Abbott Labs. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 408, 422 (D. Del. 2006) 
(stating that Microsoft's rubric allowed alternate means to plaintiff to rebut defendant's justification: as pretextual or, alternatively, 
by demonstrating that the anticompetitive harm of the conduct outweighs the procompetitive benefit). The Third Circuit has never 
specifically adopted this alternative. See e.g., United States v. Dentsply Intern., Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 187, 196 (3d Cir. 2005) 
(acknowledging business justification defense to predatory conduct claim without mentioning balancing) (citing LePage's Inc. 
324 F.3d at 152); Broadcom Corp., 501 F.3d at 318 (same). Other post-Microsoft appellate decisions have also been silent on 
whether this alternative is available. See e.g., Morris Commc'ns Corp. v. PGA Tour, Inc., 364 F.3d 1288, 1295 (11th Cir. 2004) 
 [*81] (holding that once the defendant has met its burden to show its valid business justification, the burden shifts to the plaintiff 
to show that the proffered business justification is pretextual); ACT, Inc. v. Sylvan Learning Sys., Inc., 296 F.3d 657, 670 (8th 
Cir. 2002) (holding that when a valid business reason exists for the conduct alleged to be predatory or anti-competitive, that 
conduct cannot support the inference of a section 2 violation; plaintiff's evidence did not create a triable jury question on whether 
defendant's proffered business reasons were legitimate); see also 3 Areeda and Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, § 658 (3d ed. 
2007) (noting generally that few decisions have discussed the burden shifting issue in any detail). In their discussion of the section 2 issues, neither party relied upon the alternative balancing test, made any argument that the 
test is applicable under Third Circuit case law, or attempted to apply the test to the summary judgement record. Moreover, the 
Class initially advised the Court that it was not relying upon the alternative balancing test. (N.T. 4/2/12 at 3:16-5:3.) However, in 
a later correspondence, the Class noted that, as part of its argument that  [*82] Comcast lacked a valid business justification, it 
had argued in a footnote that a reasonable jury could conclude that the harm caused by Comcast's anticompetitive conduct ""far 
overshadowed"" any claimed business justification. (See Pl. Mem. at 72 n.55.) We find that any reliance upon the alternative balancing test was waived. The Class's footnote was entirely devoted to the 
pretext issue, not the balancing test. Moreover, arguments ""raised in passing (such as, in a footnote), but not squarely argued, "
119,," are considered waived."" John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Int'l Corp., 119 F.3d 1070, 1076 n.6 (3d Cir. 1997) (finding cursory 
arguments contained in footnote in appellate brief were waived). The Class's correspondence, issued after it had stated on the 
record that it was not relying upon the test, is insufficient to raise an argument that it did not include in its formal brief. See 
Acumed LLC v. Advanced Surgical Servs., Inc., 561 F.3d 199, 223 (3d Cir. 2009) (holding that a party has sufficient notice 
before a summary judgment is entered against it if it had reason to believe that the court might reach the matter at issue on the 
pending summary judgment application and the party had an opportunity  [*83] to support its position fully); Warren G. v. 
Cumberland County Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 80, 84 (3d Cir. 1999) (holding that an issue is waived if it is not raised in a party's initial 
appellate brief)."
119,32," The Court stated: We have said enough about the great hold that the defendants have on this market. The percentage is so high as to justify 
the finding of monopoly. And, as the facts already related indicate, this monopoly was achieved in large part by unlawful 
and exclusionary practices. The restrictive agreements that pre-empted for each company a segment of the market where it 
was  [*86] free of competition of the others were one device. Pricing practices that contained competitors were another. 
The acquisitions by Grinnell of ADT, AFA, and Holmes were still another. Grinnell long faced a problem of competing with 
ADT. That was one reason it acquired AFA and Holmes. Prior to settlement of its dispute and controversy with ADT, 
Grinnell prepared to go into the central station service business. By acquiring ADT in 1953, Grinnell eliminated that 
alternative. Its control of the three other defendants eliminated any possibility of an outbreak of competition that might have 
occurred when the 1907 agreements terminated. By those acquisitions it perfected the monopoly power to exclude 
competitors and fix prices. Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 576. "
120,33," CEO Roberts testified that among the advantages of clustering were economies of scale and improved consumer benefits. And I would say that those two categories are what I've been talking 
about with clustering, that I think in '99 you - depending on the scale, now this total acquisition would have done what I said 
earlier, make us substantially larger, so we would have qualified for programing discounts. We would be able to consolidate managers within a market. We'd be able to open up call centers within those markets, that 
would be open 24 hours a day, instead of kicking over to an answering service at night. When most people watch 
television, historically, that's how cable service was provided. Now you had a much larger area, and you're able to use new 
technology, as well as have a bigger scale of operations. We are able to recruit better executives because it's closer to the caliber of being a TV station general manager. Often 
considered the best job in media was to run one of the local markets, because you had the entire market in the broadcast 
industry or the radio industry, or the newspaper industry, or frankly, the phone industry. You  [*90] were in charge of either 
a state or a city. So heretofore, we would have, you know, lower paid, smaller area of line of responsibility. So there's a 
myriad of benefits that happened in that situation. Def. Ex. 56, Roberts Dep., 116:2-117:16 "
121,34," Robert Pick testified in response to a question by Class counsel about whether Comcast studied whether its estimated 
efficiencies were realized that, I'm not aware - I'm not sure or at least I'm not aware of any specific studies that were done to see if they were achieved or 
not achieved. Some of them obvious were obvious. For instance, I think in the operating efficiencies, we assumed that we 
could bring margins of the AT&T systems to that level close to or similar to the Comcast system. And so it's just obvious that you could see during the financial - looking at financial results that if the margins of those things 
approved - improved at or close to Comcast systems, you would see that we were able to do that. (Pl. Ex. 92, Pick Dep., 305:12-22.) "
122,35," COO Burke testified that Basic cable rates in virtually every system in every cable company in every state in the country are raised every  [*95] year 
because our programming costs go up every year. And, so, there were basic rate increases I would say in virtually all of the 
systems in the Philadelphia area every year during the period of time. . . . We raise prices every year because our programming increases every year. (Def. Sup. Ex. 93, S. Burke Dep., 44:5-20, 45:5-8.)"
122,36," See Def. Ex. 18, Seventh Annual Competition Report, ¶ 166 (clustering ""permits cable operators to . . . gain efficiencies 
related to economies of scale and scope resulting in lower administrative costs, enhanced deployment of new technologies, and 
encouraging the extension into previously unserved areas""); Def. Ex. 19, FCC 01-389, Eighth Annual Competition Report, ¶ 14 
(""By clustering their systems, cable operators may be able to achieve efficiencies that facilitate the provision of cable and other 
services, such as telephony.""). "
123,37," An OVS is a ""facility consisting of a set of transmission paths and associated signal generation, reception, and control 
equipment that is designed to provide cable service which includes video programming and which is provided to multiple 
subscribers within a community. . . ."" 47 C.F.R. § 76.1500(a)."
123,38," Dr. Singer, a class expert, opined that the fifteen area contractors constituted approximately 53% of the available contractors 
in the Philadelphia area. (Singer Decl. ¶ 124.) "
124,39," After offering direct testimony that RCN had suffered set backs and delays due to Comcast's interference with contractors, on 
cross-examination at his deposition, RCN executive Scott Burnside confirmed the testimony of the Rule 30(b)(6) witness: Q. And you testified about access to contractors. RCN was able to get contractors to build out in Delaware County, right? . . . THE WITNESS: To some degree, yes. BY MR. KORPUS: Q. To a degree sufficient to build out its system in Delaware County to its specifications, right? MR. WOODWARD: Objection. Form. THE WITNESS: To do construction in Delaware County, they were able to get construction people willing to do work in 
 [*105] Delaware County. (Def. Ex. 47, Burnside Dep., 158:25-159:13.). Burnside also testified that some contractors left Comcast to work for RCN 
because they did not like Comcast's ""bullying tactics."" (Id. at 160:25-161:11.) "
126,40," We note that Dr. Singer addresses the issue in his declaration, opining that ""[t]here does not appear to be a compelling 
justification for [the contractor no-compete] conduct, as one Comcast official noted to another that 'I am not entirely sure what 
problem a[n] [exclusivity] program would be designed to solve' and that exclusive contracting 'has not bubbled up from the field 
as an urgent need and so I am not sure what we are trying to fix.'"" (Singer Decl. ¶ 112 (quoting COM-PA1456482).) While it is 
unclear whether Dr. Singer was aware of Comcast's stated justifications when he stated there did not appear to be one, his 
opinion denying that Comcast had stated any justifications is not supported by the record. "
127,41," We note that the summary judgment record includes testimony from Scott Burnside that Comcast used CSN Philadelphia to 
create an entry barrier. Burnside, referring to the month-to-month contract period, testified ""it gave Comcast some leverage . . . 
over RCN and where RCN might go into other competitive - other communities in that greater Philadelphia market. (Pl. Ex. 83, 
Burnside Dep., 104:23-105:2.; but see Def. Ex. 47, Burnside Dep., 114:18-21 (stating ""RCN still does have the programming 
required to be competitive because they are there and competing on a daily basis.""); see also Def. Ex. 55, RCN 30(b)(6) Dep., 
49:5-15 (stating that obtaining programming is not an entry barrier)). However, we find that the evidence cited for the ""outside the industry norm"" proposition, as well as the claim that Comcast told 
RCN it would terminate its access to CSN Philadelphia, is taken out of context. CSN Philadelphia's CEO Jack Williams informed 
RCN on May 25, 2000 that, due to changes in the cost of programming, the market, and the needs of Comcast's affiliates, 
 [*116] Comcast would not be able ""to extend its arrangement with your system at the price and on the other terms and 
conditions currently in effect when your agreement expires this coming October."" (Pl. Ex. 118, Letter of May 25, 2000 
(emphasis added).) The letter states that this same notice was being given to all CSN Philadelphia affiliates. The Class 
concedes that RCN received a long-term contract executed in December 2003, and made effective as of October 1, 2001, the 
termination date of its prior long-term contract. (Pl. Ex. 79.) The contention that the intervening short-term contracts were ""outside the industry norm"" is based upon a letter Comcast CEO 
Brian Roberts sent to Senator Arlen Specter. In describing Comcast's relations with RCN, he stated that RCN ""has had, and 
continues to have, a contractual agreement to carry Comcast SportsNet on its systems in the network's greater Philadelphia 
service area;"" that in ""October 2000, every Comcast SportsNet affiliate was offered a six-month carriage renewal (through March 
2001), after which the carriage agreement would remain in place on a continuous, month-to-month basis; while this month-to-
month agreement is in place, either Comcast SportsNet  [*117] or the affiliate has the right to terminate the agreement on 90 
days' notice."" (Pl. Ex. 135, Letter of April 16, 2001, p. 6 (emphasis in original).) Roberts told Specter that Comcast did this ""to 
assure affiliates of continuous service while the company reviewed its business plan and structure"" and Roberts stated that 
Comcast advised RCN that, on completion of that review, it would offer ""all affiliates a standard new contract whose terms and 
length will be consistent with established industry practices."" (Id. (emphasis in original).) The Class reads the statement that the 
new contract would ""be consistent with industry standards"" as evidence that the interceding month-to-month arrangement was 
outside the norm. This characterization ignores the evidence, undisputed by the Class, that the interceding arrangement was 
imposed on all affiliates and was instituted by Comcast ""to assure affiliates of continuous service while the company reviewed its 
business plan and structure."" (Id.) "
129,42," In the section of his report entitled ""Incumbent Cable Operators Reduce Rates when Competitors Enter,"" Dr. Williams opines The evidence illustrates, through individual pricing decisions, how incumbent cable operators responded to new entrants. 
The econometric analyses reviewed above establish that competition lowers rates, while the evidence shown in the table 
illustrates how incumbent cable operators compete for subscribers using lower rates and other promotional incentives. 
Comcast's anticompetitive conduct, which created and increased barriers to entry, reduced the extent of that entry, which 
would have required Comcast to offer such lower rates and promotions. (Williams Decl., ¶ 143.) As evidence supporting his opinion, Dr. Williams specifically cites the CAP program in Folcroft. (Id., 
Table 6.)"
129,43," In addition to relying upon the decision in LePage's, Inc., the Class cites to Telecor Communs., Inc. v. Southwestern Bell Tel. 
Co., 305 F.3d 1124, 1139-40 (10th Cir. 2002)  [*128] to also support the proposition that conduct by a monopolist to lock up "
130,," customers with long term contracts in anticipation of competition is exclusionary. The case is inapposite. At the referenced pin 
cite, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, discusses whether the ""state action doctrine"" immunized conduct 
under state antitrust law, declining to reach the question because ""it is clear that no state policy expressly permitted 
Southwestern Bell to attempt to lock up customers contractually long beyond the November 1996 introduction of competition in 
an effort to stymie that competition."" Id. The Court was clearly discussing an inapposite doctrine concerning an inapposite state 
law issue."
130,44," We note that Comcast asks that, in the event we should only find that there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether its conduct 
toward RCN was predatory, we amend our class certification order to limit the Class to subscribers residing in Delaware County. 
(See Def. Mem. at 50-51.) Because we conclude that the Class may present to a jury its section 1 rule of reason claim that 
Comcast's clustering conduct unreasonably restrained trade, as well as its section 2 monopolization claim based upon the 
targeted discounts in Delaware County, we find no cause to amend our order."
130,45," Individual antitrust injury or antitrust impact, must be established for a plaintiff to have standing under section 1 or 
 [*131] section 2 of the Sherman Act. Bell v. Dow Chem. Co., 847 F.2d 1179, 1182 (5th Cir. 1988) (holding that ""Antitrust injury 
is a component of the standing inquiry, not a separate qualification.""). This requirement is inferred from section 4 of the Clayton 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, which affords a remedy to any person injured in his business or property ""by reason of"" an antitrust 
violation. In Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977), the 
Supreme Court described antitrust injury as . . . injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes the defendants' acts 
unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible 
by the violation. It should, in short, be ""the type of loss that the claimed violations . . . would be likely to cause."" "

Atl. Richfield, 495 U.S. at 342-44. "
135,1," The Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent decisions of the Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981. Bonner v. 
City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981)(en banc)."
135,2," Despite Plaintiffs' somewhat convoluted argument, the ""other property"" exception to the economic loss rule plays no part in 
Plaintiffs' product liability claim. Based on Plaintiffs' complaint, the aircraft was sold, as a single ""integrated package,"" with the 
allegedly defective emergency brake system. See East River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., 476 U.S. 858, 867, 106 
S. Ct. 2295, 90 L. Ed. 2d 865 (1986). Therefore, the aircraft should be considered a single product with respect to the economic 
loss rule. See id.; Turbomeca, S.A. v. French Aircraft Agency, 913 So. 2d 714, 717 (Fla. 3d DCA 2005) (citing Casa Clara 
Condo. Ass'n v. Charley Toppino & Sons, Inc., 620 So. 2d 1244 (Fla. 1993)) (""Courts have refused to bifurcate products into 
parts where a component part harms or destroys the finished product.); Jarmco, Inc. v. Polyguard. Inc.. 668 So. 2d 300, 303 
(Fla. 4th DCA 1996), approved, Polyguard, Inc. v. Jarmco, Inc., 684 So. 2d 732 (Fla. 1996) (""[T]he 'other' property exception "
136,," to the [economic loss rule] must be limited to property that is unrelated and unconnected to the product sold and there is no 
privity between the owner of the property damaged and the distribution chain for the product causing the damage.""). "
140,*," The Honorable C. Darnell Jones, District Judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, 
sitting by designation. "
141,1," Because Bocobo disputes the veracity of the reports maintained by SJHS in a ""secret personal file,"" we will not consider that 
evidence at the summary judgment stage. "
143,2," Bocobo's brief does not assert error in the resolution of Counts 7, 9, 11, and 12, or in Counts 13, 14, and 15, which were added 
in an amended complaint. Additionally, it offers no argument regarding his defamation claim under Count 8. Therefore, he has 
waived any arguments regarding the resolution of Counts 7, 8 (as to defamation only), 9, and 11 through 15. See United States 
v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 222 (3d Cir. 2005)."
143,3," Although it is unclear from Bocobo's complaint whether he intended to include SJHS as a defendant in Count 6, the District 
Court found the conduct charged in Count 6  [**10] ""factually interrelated"" to other counts in which SJHS was a named 
defendant and treated SJHS as a Count 6 defendant. We do the same."
143,4," The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, and 15, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1332.  [**11] We have 
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291."
143,5," Substantively, the NJAA is ""virtually identical"" to the Sherman Act, and the New Jersey legislature ""intended the [NJAA] as 
consistent with federal antitrust law, and expressly provided that it 'be construed in harmony with ruling judicial interpretations 
of comparable Federal antitrust statutes and to effectuate, insofar as practicable, a uniformity in the laws.'"" Ideal Dairy Farms, 
Inc. v. Farmland Dairy Farms, Inc., 282 N.J. Super. 140, 659 A.2d 904, 920 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1995) (quoting N.J. Stat. Ann. § "
144,56," :9-18).  [**13] Accordingly, our analysis of Bocobo's federal antitrust claims in Count 1 applies to his NJAA claims in Count 2, 
and we resolve both counts together."
144,6," Preliminarily, we reject Bocobo's objections  [**15] to the District Court's act of defining the relevant product and geographic 
markets rather than preserving that question for the jury. It was proper for the District Court to delimit the market in order to 
assess antitrust injury at the summary judgment stage. Cf., e.g., Barton & Pittinos, Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 118 F.3d 
178, 182 (3d Cir. 1997) (upholding summary judgment based on a lack of antitrust injury where the district court's decision 
depended heavily on its definition of the relevant product market). "
145,7," We find the District Court's definition of the relevant geographic market for radiology jobs proper, given uncontested evidence 
that: (1) SJHS recruited radiologists from Colorado; (2) Chase was hired from Camden County, New Jersey; and (3) Bocobo 
himself searched for a new position at least as far as the Philadelphia area. See, e.g., Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. 
Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 29, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984) (noting that the market for anesthesiologist jobs ""is not necessarily 
the same as the market in which hospitals compete in offering services to patients . . . [and that] it may encompass competition 
among anesthesiologists for exclusive contracts . . . and might be statewide or merely local""), abrogated in part on other grounds 
by Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006); Balaklaw, 14 F.3d at 799; 
Collins v. Assoc. Pathologists Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 478-79 (7th Cir. 1988). "
146,8," We reject Defendants' argument that Bocobo's CEPA claim is barred by the statute of limitations. In CEPA cases, ""the 
employee's cause of action . . . accrues on the date of actual discharge[,] . . . [which is] the last day for which the employee is 
paid a regular salary or wage,"" Alderiso v. Med. Ctr. of Ocean Cnty., Inc., 167 N.J. 191, 770 A.2d 275, 277 (N.J. 2001), and 
Bocobo brought his suit well within one year of his final day of work, July 13, 2001. "
147,9," In his reply brief, as in his briefs before the District Court, Bocobo asserts in much greater detail that SJHS and Chase collected 
""anecdotal allegations"" about him in a ""secret personal file"" and published false and misleading statements to hospital 
personnel, RCSJ, and Alliance based on ""one-sided and incomplete portrayals of events."" (Reply 22.) Bocobo claims SJHS and 
Chase knew the stories were false or recklessly disregarded their unreliability. Because Bocobo did not raise this argument in 
his opening brief, he waived it, see Pelullo, 399 F.3d at 222, and we consider only his challenge to the District Court's ruling on 
special damages. "
156,1," The D.C. District Court Order suggests that the DOJ's complaint against Lucasfilm was filed on December 21, 2010, whereas 
the CAC states that it was filed on December 14, 2010. The difference is immaterial here, but the Court takes the date as pled in 
the CAC to be true for purposes of these motions."
156,2," Plaintiffs ask this Court to apply the doctrine of judicial  [**9] estoppel to prevent Defendants from taking a position on this 
motion that is inconsistent with the position they took before the D.C. District Court that the same allegations ""stated a claim 
upon which relief may be granted."" Opp'n to Joint Mot. 6 n.2 (citing New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S. Ct. 
1808, 149 L. Ed. 2d 968 (2001)). The Court declines to apply the judicial estoppel doctrine here. Defendants' apparent 
concession that the DOJ stated a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act is not clearly inconsistent with Defendants' position 
here that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. Section 1 of the Sherman Act governs a claim to relief "
157,," by the government. Section 4 of the Clayton Act governs a claim to relief by an individual and has the additional requirement of 
antitrust injury, which is inapplicable to the government's Section 1 claim."
157,3," As with the discrepancy in the date of the filing of the DOJ's complaint against Lucasfilm, as described in footnote 1, the D.C. 
District Court Order suggests that the final judgment against Lucasfilm was filed on June 3, 2011, whereas the CAC states that it 
was filed on June 2, 2011. The difference is immaterial here, but the Court  [**10] takes the date as pled in the CAC to be true 
for purposes of this motion."
157,4," Plaintiffs included additional factual allegations supporting a conspiracy, allegedly uncovered in discovery, in their section of the 
Joint Case Management Statement. ECF No. 109. Although the Court does not opine on the eventual admissibility of this 
evidence, the Court presently gives no weight to these additional factual allegations as they are not properly before the Court on 
these motions."
157,5," As discussed below, Pixar and Lucasfilm  [**12] entered into other agreements in addition to entering into a ""Do Not Cold Call"" 
agreement. "
159,6," After the hearing, Plaintiffs withdrew their claim under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600. ECF No. 111. Accordingly, Defendants' 
joint motion to dismiss as to this claim is DENIED as MOOT."
159,7," The CAC originally contained a prayer for injunctive relief, see CAC 126, 135, 143, and declaratory relief, see id. 143, 152, 154, 
155, 157, 158. However,  [**17] Plaintiffs have since withdrawn their prayer for injunctive relief, see ECF No. 89, and declaratory 
relief, see ECF No. 111."
159,8," While the name of each Superior Court case listed only Adobe Systems Inc. as the defendant, the Superior Court complaints 
also named as defendants Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm, Pixar, and Does 1-200. "
161,9," Defendants' briefing does not contest that the individual bilateral agreements are horizontal agreements between competitors 
in restraint of trade, which are either per se unlawful, Am. Ad Mgmt., 92 F.3d at 786, or at  [**24] least, as alleged here, prima 
facie anticompetitive under the rule of reason analysis. See Brantley v. NBC Universal, Inc., 675 F.3d 1192, 2012 U.S. App. 
LEXIS 6441, 2012 WL 1071257, at *3 (9th Cir. Mar. 30, 2012). As an initial matter, the parties agree that the Court need not 
decide, at this stage, whether the rule of reason or per se analysis applies to this case. Reply 9; Tr. 29:15-17. Thus, whether 
Defendants had a procompetitive justification for their bilateral agreements, a consideration that is relevant only under a rule of 
reason analysis, is properly decided in later stages of litigation. See Arizona v. Maricopa Cnty. Med. Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 343, 
102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982)."
161,10," The third factor, whether the alleged restraint affected interstate commerce, is not in dispute. "
167,11," Defendants focus their arguments on antitrust injury, but appear cursorily to attack Plaintiffs' Article III standing. Joint Mot. 9. 
HN10[
] Plaintiffs meet the requirements for Article III standing: (1) injury in fact; (2) causal connection; (3) redressability. Takhar v. Kessler, 76 F.3d 995, 999-1000 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal quotations omitted). Plaintiffs allege that their salaries were 
artificially reduced as a result  [**48] of Defendants' alleged anticompetitive conduct and that their injury can be redressed 
through the payment of damages should Plaintiffs establish liability. As Plaintiffs were directly affected by the alleged agreement 
to eliminate competition, they have antitrust standing as well. AGC v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 545, 103 
S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983)."
167,12," Defendants repeat their argument that Plaintiffs have failed to allege a relevant market and control of that market, see Section 
III.A.1.b.iii, supra, to argue that Plaintiffs have also failed to allege antitrust injury. See Joint Mot. 18-19. As discussed above, the 
Court declines to require a market analysis at the motion to dismiss stage. "
168,13," The Court notes that even if Plaintiffs'  [**54] UCL claim were to survive a motion to dismiss, the UCL claim would likely face 
an insurmountable hurdle at the class certification stage given that the Ninth Circuit has foreclosed the certification of nationwide 
classes under the UCL. See Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 585 (9th Cir. 2012). "
169,14," To the extent Corley v. Long-Lewis, Inc., 688 F. Supp. 2d 1315, 1336 (N.D. Ala. 2010), conflicts by suggesting that the federal 
enclave doctrine applies as long as ""some of the events alleged . . . occurred on a federal enclave,"" the Court instead follows the 
Ninth Circuit, which has held to the contrary. While it is true, as Lucasfilm notes, Lucasfilm Reply 2, that Judge Wilken applied 
the federal enclave doctrine to bar plaintiff's defamation claim in Totah even though the defamatory statement was uttered and 
republished outside of the Presidio, Totah is not an example of a sister court adopting Corley's ""some of the events"" standard. 
Judge Wilken stated that ""the substance and consummation of the  [**57] tort [of libel] occurs when and where the third person 
receives, reads, and comprehends the libelous matter,"" and held that federal enclave jurisdiction applied because the allegedly 
libelous statements at issue in that case had been received on a federal enclave. Totah, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 39940, 2011 WL 
1324471, at *2. "

182,1," The Court notes that Plaintiff, while represented  [*3] by counsel, previously filed a complaint in this Court regarding the same 
subject property, but voluntarily dismissed her suit on June 4, 2010. See Hoilien v. OneWest Bank, No. 10-00121, Doc. # 11. 
Plaintiff has also filed three other suits in this Court against mortgage lenders regarding other properties. See Hoilien v. Bank of 
Am., No. 10-00761, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89155, 2011 WL 3494523 (D. Haw. Aug. 10, 2011); Hoilien v. Bank of Am., No. 10-
00760, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67662, 2011 WL 251831 (D. Haw. June 23, 2011); Hoilien v. Bank of Am., No. 10-00712, 2011 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27863, 2011 WL 976699 (D. Haw. Mar. 17, 2011)."
182,2," Defendants have submitted copies of the Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Notice of Mortgagee's Intention to Foreclose 
Under Power of Sale, Mortgagee's Affidavit of Foreclosure Under Power of Sale, and Mortgagee's Quitclaim Deed Pursuant to 
Power of Sale as exhibits to their Request for Judicial Notice. (Doc. # 29, Exs. C-G.) The Court takes judicial notice of those 
documents, which are public documents recorded in the Bureau of Conveyances. See United States v. 14.02 Acres of Land 
More or Less in Fresno Cnty., 547 F.3d 943, 955 (9th Cir. 2008) (citing Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 
2001) (""Although, as a general rule, a  [*4] district court may not consider materials not originally included in the pleadings in 
deciding a Rule 12 motion, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d), it 'may take judicial notice of matters of public record' and consider them 
without converting a Rule 12 motion into one for summary judgment.""))."
182,3," Moving Defendants requested that the Court take judicial notice of their Verified Complaint for Ejectment and the Maui District 
Court orders. Pursuant to Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the court may take judicial notice of papers filed in state 
court and of state court orders. See Porter v. Ollison, 620 F.3d 952, 955 n.1 (9th Cir. 2010); Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena 
Airport Auth. v. City of Burbank, 136 F.3d 1360, 1364 (9th Cir. 1998). The state court documents are relevant to the present 
matter. Therefore, the Court grants the request for judicial notice. "
185,4," The Court notes that Plaintiff's FAC is a boilerplate complaint alleging many of the same causes of action that she has alleged 
in previous actions against mortgage lenders and that have been alleged in numerous actions by other pro se plaintiffs before 
this Court. This Court has dismissed these complaints for failure to state a claim, explaining in detail the complaints' deficiencies. "
186,," See, e.g., Vertido v. GMAC Mortg. Corp., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5117, 2012 WL 139212 (D. Haw. Jan. 17, 2012); Hoilien v. 
Bank of Am., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89155, 2011 WL 3494523 (D. Haw. Aug. 10, 2011); Hoilien v. Bank of Am., 2011 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 67662, 2011 WL 2518731 (D. Haw. June 23, 2011);  [*16] Phillips v. Bank of Am., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6745, 2011 WL 
240813 (D. Haw. Jan. 21, 2011)."
186,5," In addition to the Ninth Circuit's instruction  [*18] on MERS, this Court has previously instructed Plaintiff on the insufficiency of 
bald assertions about MERS. For example, in a 2011 order in another case filed by Plaintiff against mortgage lenders, this Court 
noted: Plaintiff appears to be alleging that MERS may not foreclose, or has improperly foreclosed, because it is not a holder of the 
note. As it stands, however, Plaintiff's Count XII makes little sense because standing is a requirement for a plaintiff in order 
to proceed in a lawsuit, not one that a defendant must establish. Further, Plaintiff's statement that MERS has no legal 
standing to foreclose is a conclusory allegation insufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Hoilien v. Bank of Am., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89155, 2011 WL 3494523, at *11 (D. Haw. Aug. 10, 2011); see also Hoilien v. 
Bank of Am., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67662, 2011 WL 251831, at *13 (D. Haw. June 23, 2011); Hoilien v. Bank of Am., 2011 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 27863, 2011 WL 976699, at *14 (D. Haw. Mar. 17, 2011). "
187,6," The Mortgage explicitly provides, ""Borrower does hereby mortgage, grant and convey to MERS (solely as nominee for Lender 
and Lender's successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of MERS, with power of sale, the following described 
property ...."" (emphasis added) (Doc. # 29, Ex. C, at 2.)"
187,7," Plaintiff also asserts a violation of § 481A-3(a), but this statute is inapplicable to mortgage transactions. See Cavaco v. Mortg. 
Elec. Registration Sys., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44484, 2011 WL 1565979, at *7 n.1 (D. Haw. Apr. 25, 2011). "
188,8," As the Court previously explained, Plaintiff cannot base her claim on either occurrences that happened prior to June 6, 2007, or 
TILA violations, including Defendants' alleged failure to provide her with a Notice of Right to Cancel."
188,9," Although not published, Henderson was issued after January 1, 2007, and may be cited pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate 
Procedure 32.1(a) and Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3(b). "
189,10," Count III of Plaintiff's FAC alleges ""Fraudulent Concealment—Tolling of Statute."" Equitable  [*27] tolling, however, is not an 
independent cause of action; it is a doctrine that serves to toll a statute of limitations that would otherwise bar a plaintiff from 
bringing a cause of action. See King v. California, 784 F.2d 910, 915 (9th Cir. 1986). Thus, the Court reads Plaintiff's third Count 
requesting tolling of TILA's statute of limitations in conjunction with Plaintiff's claim for TILA damages. "
190,11," Although Plaintiff's allegations of fraud are not against the Moving Defendants, the Court addresses this issue sua sponte 
because Plaintiff alleges that the Moving Defendants ""are subject to the Mortgage and Note violations of all of its predecessors 
and said violations serve to bar said Defendants from taking any action against Plaintiff and/or the 'property'...."" (FAC ¶ 37.) 
Plaintiff further alleges that the Moving Defendants ""knew or should have known"" of IndyMac's alleged violations. (FAC  [*31] ¶ 
38.) These bare assertions are not entitled to an assumption of truth. See Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. at 1951. Moreover, the underlying 
fraud allegations against IndyMac do not state a claim for relief. "
192,12," Even though this claim is not alleged directly against Moving Defendants, the Court reviews this issue sua  [*41] sponte 
insofar as Plaintiff attempts to impute liability for these alleged violations on the Moving Defendants. "
193,13," As with the previous Count, the Court reaches this issue sua sponte insofar as Plaintiff's theory of liability against the Moving 
Defendants is predicated on IndyMac's purported wrongdoings. "
194,14," The provision provides, ""Every such conveyance not so recorded is void as against any subsequent purchaser, lessee, or 
mortgagee, in good faith and for a valuable consideration, not having actual notice of the conveyance of the same real estate 
...."" (Haw. Rev. Stat. § 502-8.) "
195,15," These restrictions allegedly include ""[i]mposing restrictions to modification required to avoid double taxation and make 
collection of payments by the trust and payment to the investors a single pass through taxable event,"" ""[i]mposing restrictions 
upon the number of Mortgages in the pool which may be modified,""  [*50] and ""[p]roviding a procedure for foreclosure but no 
procedure to modify the loan as an alternate dispute resolution."" (FAC ¶ 144.) "
202,1," Additionally, as noted in the prior  [*15] dismissal order, under the conspiracy theory then-articulated, entities such as HP and 
Dell who purchased ODDs from named defendants in allegedly rigged auctions and incorporated those ODDs into products sold 
to the public, would somehow have been both knowing co-conspirators and unwitting victims of the price-fixing. "
203,2," The Indirect Purchasers, in particular, do contend that the effect of the alleged ODD price fixing was to raise the prices they 
paid for products containing them, but not that there was a conspiracy to fix the prices of those products per se."
203,3," For example, the Indirect Purchasers assert claims regarding ""ODDs designed to be attached externally to devices such as 
computers."" Putting aside standalone ODD player/recorders designed primarily for audio or visual entertainment purposes that 
may include additional features and circuitry, such devices typically  [*17] consist of little other than the ODD, a case, USB 
connection circuitry and cabling. As such, it seems unlikely that they are typically, if ever, manufactured and sold by entities 
unrelated to the manufacturers of the ODDs. If so, it is unclear why such products would be part of the Indirect Purchasers' case, 
rather than that of the Direct Purchasers."
203,4," In a related issue, the IP SAC does not  [*19] name the Sony entity that manufactures and sells the PlayStation as a defendant. 
Presumably Indirect Purchasers contend that entity was not involved in the conspiracy, and that they can therefore recover for 
any effect that price-fixing of ODDs had on the price of PlayStations. Direct Purchasers, however, have named that Sony entity 
as a defendant, and apparently contend that their class includes PlayStation purchasers, under the theory that the first 
transaction outside the conspiracy is a direct purchase. While this presents a conflict between the two complaints, it does not 
support dismissal of either. "
204,5," Subsequent to the hearing, the parties have submitted several statements of recent decisions they contend bear on the issues 
in this action. In at least one instance, such a statement was simply filed, in others, they were accompanied by requests for 
leave to submit them, as is required by Civil Local Rule 7-3(d). All the statements of recent decision will be deemed properly 
filed. "
205,6," Defendants question whether it is realistic that Dell and HP ultimately will participate as class members in this action. While that 
may present certification issues, it does not undermine the plausibility of the claims at the pleading stage."
205,7," To the extent plaintiffs contended that all manufacturers and sellers of ODD products were part of the purported conspiracy, 
they failed to allege facts making such a claim plausible. "
206,8," As noted, however, the indirect purchasers may be contending that such external ODDs are encompassed in their complaint. 
Unless there are third party entities that purchase ""internal"" ODDs, put them in a case and resell them, this issue may need to be 
resolved at a later stage, and in any event, further clarity will be  [*28] required."
206,9," Defendants complain that the allegations regarding the named plaintiffs' purchases are too vague to determine what kinds of 
products they purchased. Whether the named plaintiffs can serve as adequate class representatives upon refinement of the 
class definitions remains to be seen, but it would be premature to parse and dismiss some portion of the claims for lack of 
standing at this stage."
206,10," To the extent this definition might be construed as encompassing ""external"" ODDs that are  [*29] designed for use with 
computers and are essentially just ""internal"" ODDs in cases, such devices are better classed in the preceding category, as 
discussed above."
206,11," Defendants argue that the DP SAC does not contain any such clear exclusion. To the extent the pleading itself is ambiguous, 
plaintiffs will be held to the representations made in their briefing and at the hearing."
206,12," Again, the definitions of the products and descriptions of the claims are sufficiently unclear that it is arguable that plaintiffs 
have omitted any claim related to ODDs preinstalled in computers, videogame consoles, and camcorders manufactured by 
defendants from both the DP SAC and the IP SAC. Read liberally, however, it is apparent that the DP SAC should be construed 
as intending to assert such a claim. "
208,13," The separate motion filed by defendants Quanta Storage Inc. and Quanta Storage America Inc. is an exception because it 
focuses on an argument that plaintiffs lack Article III standing for failure to plead sufficient facts to establish cognizable injury. 
Although framed in different terms, the contentions advanced by the Quanta entities are effectively a subset of the issues raised 
in the joint motions, in that they contend any price-fixing in connection with the Dell and HP auctions does not support an 
inference that the prices of other ODDs were affected. This argument fails in light of the analysis above. "
209,14," The Indirect Purchasers concede their claims under New Hampshire and Utah antitrust laws are limited to the time periods 
beginning January 1, 2008, and May 1, 2006, respectively. For that reason it would be equally appropriate to characterize that 
one aspect of the motion as having been granted. Regardless how the disposition is characterized, plaintiffs will be held to their 
concession. "
211,1," The parties use the terms ""device"" and ""chip"" interchangeably in their papers. The Court will use the term ""device"" in this Order. "

215,4," PNY urges the Court to look at the overall scheme alleged in the Complaint to determine whether  [*17] it has stated a claim for 
antitrust violation. Pl.'s Opp'n 14 (citing Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 
1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962) (courts should not ""tightly compartmentaliz[e] the various factual components and wip[e] the slate 
clean after scrutiny of each""). While the slate need not be ""wiped clean"" after scrutiny of a particular theory, each legal theory 
must be examined for its sufficiency separately. In City of Groton v. Conn. Light & Power Co., 662 F.2d 921, 928-29 (2d Cir. 
1981) (quoted in Intergraph Corp., supra, 195 F.3d at 1367) , the Second Circuit explained: [W]e reject the notion that if there is a fraction of validity to each of the basic claims and the sum of the fraction is one or 
more, the plaintiffs have proved a violation of section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act. The proper inquiry is whether, qualitatively, 
there is a ""synergistic effect."" While the ultimate determination of an antitrust violation rests on the ""overall combined effect"" of the alleged acts, see City of 
Anaheim v. S. Cal. Edison Co., 955 F.2d 1373, 1376 (9th Cir. 1992), ""there can be no synergistic result"" if none of the acts 
alleged is an antitrust violation. Cal. Computer Prods. v. Int'l Bus. Machs., Corp., 613 F.2d 727 (9th Cir. 1979)."
215,5," 15 U.S.C. § 2. Monopolizing trade a felony; penalty Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony . . . "
216,6," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything 
 [*20] forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor."" 15 U.S.C. § 15. Section 16 of the Clayton Act provides that ""[a]ny person, 
firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a 
violation of the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
217,7," PNY's  [*26] reasoning is somewhat circular: ""SanDisk's anticompetitive licensing scheme has given it the power to control 
prices and exclude competition, as evidenced by SanDisk's actual exercise of control over prices and the actual exclusion of 
competition in the Relevant Markets."" Complaint 117. "
218,8," The Court assumes that PNY uses the term ""several"" in its ordinary meaning: a small number; more than two or three but not 
very many. OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY ONLINE, http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/176914 (last visited Apr. 17, 
2012). "
220,9," PNY alleges in its Complaint that Kingston's Counterclaim in SanDisk Corp. v. Kingston Tech. Co., 10-cv-00243 (W.D. Wis.) 
survived a motion to dismiss. In its opposition, it adds that ""PNY's allegations are nearly identical to the claims that were the 
subject of a trial in the Western District of Wisconsin."" Pl.'s Opp'n 1-2. The Counterclaim in Kingston (which was filed under seal) 
does not nudge PNY's claims in this case across the line from possible to plausible. Moreover, the Court notes that in the 
Kingston, after a full trial on the merits, the Judge's findings of fact do not support many of PNY's allegations about SanDisk's 
market power or the barriers to entry into the downstream markets. "
221,10," At best, PNY alleges patent misuse through this licensing  [*38] provision. Complaint 90. While this may suffice as an 
equitable defense to a patent infringement lawsuit, it stops well short of establishing a Sherman Act violation."
221,11," SanDisk cites court cases upholding, as procompetitive, licensing agreements, much like its contract with PNY, requiring 
royalty payments on sales  [*39] of products not covered by the licensor's patents where the parties' contract contained a clause 
stating that this method for calculating royalties was a convenient means to calculate royalties. Mot. to Dismiss 7-9. Because all 
of the cases cited were decided on with the benefit of a full evidentiary record, either following trial or on summary judgment, it is 
not clear whether, as a matter of law, because the parties' contract contains such a convenience of the parties license recital, 
PNY is precluded from alleging that the method for calculating royalties is anticompetitive. "
222,12," PNY alleges that it entered into the agreement to put an end to a patent infringement lawsuit PNY brought against it, but it 
does not suggest that the lawsuit was a ""sham litigation"" or ""bad faith prosecution."" See Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc., 601 
F.2d 986 (9th Cir. 1979) (prosecution of patent enforcement actions are presumed to be in good faith, but if prosecuted in bad 
faith, it may violate antitrust laws)."
222,13," 15 U.S.C. § 1. Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; penalty Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade  [*42] or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in 
any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . ."
222,14," PNY argues in its opposition that through discovery it expects to get more information about the contracts. Pl.'s Opp'n 20. 
Unfortunately, PNY cannot save its Section 1 claim based on the expectation that through discovery it might find a factual basis 
for its conspiracy claim. In Twombly, supra, the Supreme Court cautioned  [*44] ""a district court must retain the power to insist 
on some specificity in pleading before allowing a potentially massive factual controversy to proceed."" 550 U.S. at 558. Based on 
the present state of the pleadings, PNY may not obtain this discovery. "
224,15," In its opposition, PNY indicates that the claim for intentional interference could satisfy the unfair prong. Because this is not 
pled as a basis for the UCL claim, and also because the claim for intentional interference fails to state a claim, this argument 
cannot prevent dismissal. "
226,1," The Motions addressed here are: Motion to Dismiss Indirect Purchaser Second Amended Consolidated Complaint as to 
Defendants Michael Foods, Inc. and Papetti's  [*2] Hygrade Egg Products, Inc. (Doc. No. 327) (hereinafter, ""Michael Foods 
Mot.""); Defendant Rose Acre Farm, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss Indirect Purchasers' Second Consolidated Amended Class Action

354), and the Defendants' filed reply briefs (Doc. Nos. 375, 377, 378, 379, 381, 382, 383). Additionally, the parties filed various 
supplemental materials in support of their positions. The transcript of the oral argument on the Motions is contained in the record 
at Docket No. 597."
226,2," Certain claims in the IPSAC are presently not, or are no longer, subject to these motions, namely, those state claims which the 
Court dismissed by granting in part a prior joint defense motion to dismiss—the consumer protection claims arising under the 
laws of Kansas, New York, and West Virginia, the North Dakota unjust enrichment claim, the Plaintiffs' Utah Antitrust Act claim 
with respect to alleged damages occurring prior to May 1, 2006, and certain federal and state antitrust claims with respect to 
alleged injuries relating to purchases of manufactured products incorporating processed eggs—and those claims that Plaintiffs 
voluntarily withdrew, namely, all claims brought under Maine or Puerto Rico law, and the consumer protection claims brought 
under the laws of Michigan, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. See March 19, 2012 Op. and Order, 841 F. Supp. 2d 867, 2012 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 37265, 2012 WL 935669  [*4] (Doc. Nos. 631 and 632). The Court also has dismissed all damages for pending 
claims outside the various applicable statutes of limitation periods. See Apr. 4, 2012 Mem. and Order, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
48321, 2012 WL 1137100 (Doc. Nos. 650 and 651). To the extent that the motions sub judice seek to dismiss any such claims 
that are no longer a part of the case, the Court does not address that aspect of these motions."
226,3," Although movant Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products, Inc., identifies itself as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Defendant Michael 
Foods and has jointly  [*5] filed a motion to dismiss with Michael Foods, Michael Foods Mot. at 1, this movant is not named as a 
defendant in the IPSAC. Only Paragraph 129 refers to Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products, Inc. as a ""Defendant,"" but given the 
structure of the IPSAC, the Court concludes such a reference is an editorial oversight. Ergo, Papetti's Hygrade Egg Products, 
Inc. is not a party in this suit and lacks standing to bring a motion to dismiss. As such, the Court denies Papetti's Hygrade Egg 
Products, Inc.'s motion to dismiss insofar that it seeks dismissal from the suit. The Court does not include Papetti's Hygrade Egg 
Products, Inc. in its count of the nine moving Defendants. "
228,4," At this time, the Court notes that several Defendants request the Court's judicial notice of certain documents in order to bolster 
their arguments in support of dismissal. However, the Court declines to consider any of the proffered documents for purposes of 
evaluating the adequacy of the IPSAC. "
229,," Michael Foods asks for notice of a Declaration of William L. Greene, counsel for Michael Foods, and several attachments 
purportedly comprising certain UEP meeting minutes, for the purposes of demonstrating that ""Michael Foods was selling egg 
products made with non-UEP Certified eggs"" prior to its joining the UEP Certified Program. Michael Foods Mot. at 11; see also 
id. at 6-7. Michael Foods also cites the Declaration in relation to arguments concerning whether trade group meeting attendance 
allegations can sustain the claim that Michael Foods joined the alleged conspiracy. Michael Foods Reply at 7. In seeking to 
refute factual allegations suggestive of its agreement to the alleged conspiracy, Rose Acre seeks judicial notice of several 
documents cited in the IPSAC—four  [*14] news or periodical articles and a document purported to be UEP's Animal Husbandry 
Guidelines for U.S. Egg Laying Flocks (2000 ed.). Rose Acre Mot. at 6-7 & n.7, 12; see also id., Ex. C; Rose Acre Reply at 7. 
Additionally, Land O'Lakes asks the Court to judicially notice January 25, 2005 UEP meeting minutes to demonstrate that its 
representative was present at the meeting but did not participate. Land O'Lakes Mot. at 3. Neither these materials, nor the Defendants' arguments in support of judicial notice of these materials, provide occasion for the 
Court to deviate from the general rule that ""a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss may not consider matters extraneous to 
the pleadings."" In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). In ruling on a Rule 
12(b)(6) motion, ""a court must consider only the complaint, exhibits attached to the complaint, matters of public record, as well 
as undisputedly authentic documents if the complainant's claims are based upon these documents."" Mayer v. Belichick, 605 
F.3d 223, 230 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). Here, the Court need not consider the Defendants' proffered materials because 
none  [*15] of the exceptions apply. Plaintiffs did not attach the materials to the IPSAC as exhibits; the materials are not 
incorporated through citation or limited quotation; and it is unclear whether the authenticity of the materials are unchallenged. 
See Sept. 26, 2011 Mem., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109641, 2011 WL 4465355, at *23. Additionally, the Plaintiffs' federal and state 
claims are not central to, based upon, or integral to these proffered materials. See id. The Court recognizes that if any of the proffered materials verges on being central to the Plaintiffs' claims, it would be Rose 
Acre's proffered UEP Animal Husbandry Guidelines. See 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109641, [WL] at *23 n. 32 (""By illustrative 
contrast [to certain other documents offered for judicial notice], the UEP Certification guidelines are arguably integral to Plaintiffs' 
antitrust claim . . . . . But this example is purely academic ....""). However, as is true of the other Defendants' extrinsic documents, 
it is unclear whether the authenticity of Rose Acre's document is challenged or not. Moreover, as alleged in the IPSAC, the UEP 
Certification guidelines are not static, but instead constitute an ever-evolving set of documented standards that over time were 
modified to incorporate  [*16] many of the features that the Court has concluded are anti-competitive, such as the prohibition on 
backfilling, the 100% rule, and so forth See, e.g., id. ¶¶ 62, 170, 174-75, 202, 224, 295. So although the ""UEP Certification 
guidelines"" as a general concept are central to the Plaintiffs' claims, as the guidelines are described in the IPSAC, no single 
version of the guidelines as embodied by a single document could be so integral to the Plaintiffs' claims as to be properly before 
the Court on a motion to dismiss. "
230,5," The IPSAC designates the Land O'Lakes employee's attendance at the meeting as either a UEP member or guest. IPSAC ¶ 
215. The IPSAC, however, does not explicitly allege that Land O'Lakes was ever a member of UEP."
230,6," As an exception to this, Land O'Lakes is ambiguously referred to parenthetically in an allegation that Moark LLC applied and 
was certified under the UEP Certification Program: ""The following Defendants submitted applications for certification and agreed 
to implement the [UEP Certification Program] guidelines: as of March 22, 2002, . . . Moark (Land O'Lakes) . . . ."" Id. ¶ 163. 
However, this allegation is simply too vague to provide adequate notice to Land O'Lakes of its supposed offense."
230,7," Because the applicable pleading standards do not allow the Court to consider allegations that are unsupported and bald 
conclusions, the Court cannot appropriately consider the IPSAC's allegation that ""Land O'Lakes has been an active participant in 
. . . Moark's, UEP's, and its co-conspirators' efforts to reduce supply and fix prices"" as anything more than  [*22] a conclusory 
allegation. Id. ¶ 62. There are simply no specific facts in the IPSAC to support Land O'Lakes' alleged ""active participation"" in the 
conspiracy, and as such the Court need not accept such a charge as true. See Doug Grant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., 
232 F.3d 173, 183-84 (3d Cir. 2000); Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997). "
231,8," To the extent that Plaintiffs seek to premise secondary liability on a ""joint venture"" liability theory, Pls.' Resp. at 57-58, and 
assuming, arguendo, this theory is applicable in the federal antitrust context, there are insufficient facts to adequately plead such 
a form of liability. In the absence of any other specific facts pled, the conclusory and vague accusation that Land O'Lakes and 
Moark were in a ""joint venture"" simply does not suffice for pleading purposes. See generally, e.g., Restatement (Third) of 
Agency § 3.03 cmt. (e)(2) (2006) (""An association limited to a single project is a joint venture. A joint venture is treated as a form 
of partnership, in which duties and authority are limited by the scope of the venture.""); Uniform Partnership Act § 202 (1997) 
(discussing criteria for forming a partnership); id.  [*23] § 306 (""Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), all 
partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided 
by law."")."
231,9," Defendants cite case law that speaks to Section 1 claims in support of the proposition that a defendant must have joined and 
participated in the alleged conspiracy in order for a claim against them to  [*25] be sufficiently pled. See Michael Foods Mot. at 
3-4 (citing Jung v. Ass'n of Am. Med. Colls., 300 F. Supp. 2d 119, 161 (D.D.C. 2004), Hinds County v. Wachovia Bank N.A., 620

2d at 161). "
232,10," Ostensibly, this observation also would hold true for the Plaintiffs' consumer protection claims that arise from violations of 
antitrust law in jurisdictions that follow or have adopted federal antitrust conspiracy principles."
232,11," The same would be true for various jurisdictions' civil conspiracy claims—in the event that Plaintiffs are relying on civil 
conspiracy to establish the individual Defendants' vicarious or joint liability for the underlying consumer protection or unjust 
enrichment claims, as opposed to individual liability."
232,12," It may well be that each and every one of  [*29] the jurisdictions at issue has adopted federal antitrust conspiracy principles or 
follows similar, if not identical, principles of civil conspiracy as to the various antitrust, consumer protection, and unjust 
enrichment claims. Yet, in light of the Defendants' failure to proffer any meaningful legal authority in support of their arguments, 
the Court presently has no means of evaluating or recognizing the validity vel non of those arguments. The Court simply is not in 
a position to rule as a matter of law as to any state claim that Plaintiffs must plausibly suggest that Defendants joined or 
participated in the alleged conspiracy in order to state a claim against each moving Defendant. The Court shall not and cannot 
assume the burden of deciding this matter as to the 46 state claims when the Defendants have elected not to do so. The Court recognizes that Plaintiffs also rely on similar legal authority as Defendants in responding to the Defendants' individual 
motions. Nonetheless, a motion to dismiss requires a defendant to bear the onus of raising and properly supporting arguments 
for dismissal. As such, in these circumstances, the Plaintiffs' equivalent failure to address relevant jurisdiction-specific 
 [*30] case law cannot constitute grounds for dismissal. "
233,13," ""Leave to amend must generally be granted unless equitable considerations render it otherwise unjust."" Arthur v. Maersk, Inc., 
434 F.3d 196, 204 (3d Cir. 2006) (citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962), and Lorenz v. 
CSX Corp., 1 F.3d 1406, 1414 (3d Cir. 1993)). No Defendant has raised arguments that provide sufficient grounds to weigh 
against permitting Plaintiffs to seek leave to amend those claims that the Court dismisses without prejudice."

244,2," The FTC's brief offers this explanation of the economic incentives involved: According to a study conducted by the FTC of the industry as a whole .  [**7] . ., a branded manufacturer typically loses 
about 90 percent of its unit sales over the course of generic entry. While generic entrants gain that unit volume, they do not 
gain all the revenues lost by the branded manufacturer because, as generic competition sets in, the price falls, on average, 
to about 15 percent of what the branded manufacturer was charging. Thus, a branded manufacturer can expect that, if a 
drug is earning $1 billion a year before generic entry, the manufacturer will only earn about $100 million a year once 
generic competition has matured, and all the generic companies put together will only earn about $135 million a year (90% 
x 15% x $1 billion), thus leaving approximately $765 million a year for the public through the benefits of competition. The 
parties have a strong economic incentive to avoid that result. Appellant Br. 33-34 (footnotes omitted). "
246,3," Besins filed a separate lawsuit against Watson and Paddock, but the outcome of that case is not relevant to this appeal. "
247,4," Two other sets of plaintiffs—direct and indirect purchasers of AndroGel—joined the FTC in the district court and made a variety

] The analysis of whether a reverse payment agreement gives rise to antitrust liability is the same for claims brought 
under the Sherman Antitrust Act, which was involved in Valley Drug, and under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which is 
involved in this case. See Schering-Plough Corp. v. FTC, 402 F.3d 1056 (11th Cir. 2005) (applying the same antitrust analysis to 
Sherman Act and FTC Act claims). "
250,6," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), HN15[
] we adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981. The CMS decision was issued on April 22, 1981."
250,7," The traditional antitrust analysis consists of two tests: the ""per se"" test and the ""rule of reason"" test. See Schering-Plough Corp. 
v. FTC, 402 F.3d 1056, 1064 (11th Cir. 2005). Under the per se test, the challenged restraint categorically violates the antitrust 
laws because it is ""so obviously anticompetitive, or so unlikely to be pro-competitive, that [it] can be deemed to violate [the 
antitrust laws] without much more than an examination of the agreement itself and the relationships of the parties to the 
agreement."" Valley Drug, 344 F.3d at 1303. Under the rule of reason test, the legality of the challenged restraint hinges upon 
whether it promotes or suppresses competition. See Schering-Plough, 402 F.3d at 1064. "
251,8," The FTC's brief in this case places great weight on our statement in Schering-Plough that a proper antitrust analysis of reverse 
payment agreements needs to ""evaluate the strength of the patent."" 402 F.3d at 1076 (emphasis added). The FTC argues that 
evaluating the ""strength of the patent"" means evaluating ""the strength of the patent holder's claims of validity and infringement, 
as objectively viewed at the time of settlement."" We disagree. HN19[
] When read in the context of the facts and the reasoning 
of Schering-Plough, the phrase ""strength of the patent"" refers to the potential exclusionary scope of the patent—that is, the 
exclusionary rights appearing on the patent's face and not the underlying merits of the infringement claim. Nowhere in the 
Schering-Plough opinion did we actually evaluate the merits of the infringement claim when defining how much competition the 
patent could potentially exclude from the market. "
252,9," HN20[
] In 2003 Congress amended the statutory provisions governing the 180-day exclusivity period to keep corks out of the 
bottle by providing that the first paragraph IV ANDA filer forfeits its right of exclusivity if it fails to market a generic drug within 
certain time periods. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(D). A grandfather provision of that amendment specified that the changes would 
not apply to paragraph IV ANDAs filed before the date of enactment. Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and

252,10," There was no allegation in our first two decisions that the patents were fraudulently obtained or that the litigation giving rise to 
the settlement was a sham. See Valley Drug, 344 F.3d at 1307-09 & nn.19, 21; Schering-Plough, 402 F.3d at 1068. The plaintiff 
in our third decision did contend that there had been sham litigation, but we rejected that contention as unfounded. See Andrx, 
421 F.3d at 1233-34. We stated in Valley Drug that: ""[A]ppellees have neither alleged nor asserted that the patent was procured by fraud, that 
appellants knew the patent was invalid, that there was no objective basis to believe that the patent was valid, or any such similar 
allegations. We therefore are not called upon to decide what the antitrust consequences of such circumstances might  [**38] be."" 
344 F.3d at 1307 n.19. We make the same observations about this case and limit our decision in the same way. Although the 
FTC's complaint alleges that Solvay was ""not likely to prevail"" in its infringement actions against Watson and Par/Paddock, it 
does not contend that any of the three companies knew that the patent was invalid or not infringed or that there was no objective 
basis to believe the patent was valid and infringed. Accordingly, we do not rule out the possibility that sufficient allegations of any 
of those facts would state a valid antitrust claim. "
267,1," The Baton Rouge project was being performed by Verge, a wholly owned subsidiary of CamSoft. For the sake of clarity, the 
Court will not distinguish between Verge and CamSoft. "
274,1," We note that the parties in this case, as well as the trial court, refer to ""unfair and deceptive trade practices"" claims. Because 
N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 refers to ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce[,]"" and no longer contains the 
word ""trade,"" we will refer to Defendants' claims as ""Section 75-1.1 claims."" See N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 (2011); see also 
Talbert v. Mauney, 80 N.C. App. 477, 343 S.E.2d 5 (1986). "
286,1," In accordance with the court's prior Orders, VictoryLand's brief (Doc. # 574) is construed as a Renewed Motion to Exclude the 
Expert Report and Testimony of Michael A. Williams, Ph.D. (See Doc. # 563 ¶ 3; Doc. # 549 (denying the motion to exclude 
without prejudice with leave to renew).) "
291,1," Civil penalties recovered under the MCPA are divided evenly between the Attorney General's Office of Consumer Protection 
and the General Fund of the State of Mississippi. Miss. Code § 75-24-19(1)(b). "
292,2," In Hawaii v. Standard Oil, the Supreme Court held that the Clayton Act did not permit the State of Hawaii to seek damages for 
its citizens via a parens patriae suit alleging antitrust violations. Hawaii, 405 U.S. at 260-62. In response, Congress passed 15 
U.S.C. § 15c, which authorizes state attorneys  [**11] general to sue for antitrust violations and recover damages on behalf of 
their citizens. State v. Marsh & McLennan Companies, 286 Conn. 454, 466-68, 944 A.2d 315 (2008); see Caldwell, 536 F.3d at 
427 n.5; TFT-LCD, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17793, 2011 WL 560593, at *4 n.2. The Supreme Court has acknowledged ""the long 
history of state common-law and statutory remedies against monopolies and unfair business practices"" and concluded that ""this 
is an area traditionally regulated by the States."" California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 101, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 
2d 86 (1989)."
292,3," While Maryland was brought in the Supreme Court as an original action, it remains a helpful explanation of the parens patriae 
authority. "
294,4," Caldwell was ""groundbreaking,"" Lemann, 111 Colum. L. Rev. at 133, and has been discussed in a number of circuit and district 
court decisions, discussed below. It also has been the subject of academic attention, perhaps because of an emerging circuit 
split. E.g., id.; Jacob Durling, Waltzing Through a Loophole: How Parens Patriae Suits Allow Circumvention of the Class Action 
Fairness Act, 83 U. Colo. L. Rev. 549 (2012); Carswell, 78 U. Chi. L. Rev. at 353-57; Guyon Knight,  [**18] The CAFA Mass 
Action Numerosity Requirement: Three Problems with Counting to 100, 78 Fordham L. Rev. 1875 (2010). "
297,5," To be clear, class actions are not authorized in Mississippi courts. USF&G Ins. Co. of Miss. v. Walls, 911 So. 2d 463, 467 
(Miss. 2005) (""Since there is no rule or statute which expressly or impliedly provides for class actions, we are compelled to 
conclude that they are not permitted in any legal proceedings in our state courts.""). The MCPA also bars class actions attempted to be brought under its auspices. Miss. Code § 75-24-15(4). ""Thus, any purported 
class action complaint or master complaint on behalf of several plaintiffs asserting violations of Section 75-24-5 is 
 [**29] arguably improper."" Walker W. Jones, III & Jason R. Bush, An Overview of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act, 
Mississippi Defense Lawyers Assoc. Quarterly, Winter 2006, at 12 (collecting cases)."
297,6," The defendant in Vioxx did not argue that the suit was a mass action. Vioxx, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2526, 2012 WL 10552, at 
*5 n.4. "
298,7," An opinion from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey aptly illustrates one way in which CAFA's 
legislative history can be manipulated to support either party's position. See Harvey v. Blockbuster, Inc., 384 F. Supp. 2d 749, 
752-54 (D.N.J. 2005)."
298,8," Madigan and Washington involved the same issues pending before this Court: whether the attorney generals of Illinois, 
Washington, and California could, via parens patriae suit alleging antitrust violations by LCD panel makers, seek restitution, 
damages for their citizens, injunctive relief, and civil penalties in their own state courts. Madigan, 665 F.3d at 770; Washington, 
659 F.3d at 846. The Attorney General  [**34] of South Carolina brought a similar suit in state court. The defendants removed the action to 
federal court for reasons akin to those argued here. The action was remanded. South Carolina v. AU Optronics Corp., No. 3:11-
cv-731, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104213, 2011 WL 4344079 (D.S.C. Sept. 14, 2011). "
299,9," Although Caldwell forecloses it, there is a possibility that a ""mass action"" should be thought of as a ""mass joinder."" Courts 
apply CAFA's mass action provisions to mass joinders, and typically decline to apply the mass action provisions to suits lacking 
100 named plaintiffs. See Lowery, 483 F.3d at 1198 (""CAFA's mass action provisions extend  [**35] federal diversity jurisdiction 
to certain actions brought individually by large groups of plaintiffs."") (evaluating an amended complaint listing over 400 plaintiffs 
under CAFA's mass action provisions); Abrego Abrego, 443 F.3d at 678 (evaluating a complaint filed by 1,160 plaintiffs as a 
mass action); Nevada v. Bank of America Corp., 672 F.3d 661, 672 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that the State of Nevada's parens 
patriae suit was not removable as a mass action because the state was the real party in interest and thus ""the action [fell] 99 
persons short of a 'mass action'""); Anderson v. Bayer Corp., 610 F.3d 390, 393 (7th Cir. 2010) (""The instant cases contain fewer 
than 100 plaintiffs and thus are not removable under the plain language of the statute.""); Nunn v. Monsanto Co., No. 4:11-cv-
1657, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128375, at *8 (E.D. Mo. Nov. 7, 2011) (""In order for this Court to have jurisdiction under the mass 
action provisions, defendants must demonstrate that there really are 100 plaintiffs.""); TFT-LCD, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17793, 
2011 WL 560593, at *8 (""courts have held that the plaintiffs in a mass action must be individually named plaintiffs with their own 
direct claims in order to be counted toward CAFA's 100 person requirements."")  [**36] (collecting cases); see also Nan S. Ellis, 
The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005: The Story Behind the Statute, 35 J. Legis. 76, 104-05 (2009); Hittner et al., Fed. Civ. 
Pro. Before Trial - 5th Cir. Ed. ¶ 2:3027 (2011) (mass actions require 100 or more plaintiffs and CAFA can be avoided ""by filing 
separate lawsuits, each involving fewer than 100 plaintiffs""). Mississippi's own history sheds some light on the issue. Because Mississippi law prohibits class actions, mass joinders became 
a popular work-around. See, e.g., Harold's Auto Parts, Inc. v. Mangialardi, 889 So. 2d 493, 494 (Miss. 2004) (""The case before 
us has endured seven amended complaints, and now involves the claims of 264 plaintiffs against 137 named defendants who 
have identified approximately 600 different employers where asbestos exposure might have taken place.""). Mass joinders were 
arguably so popular that CAFA's drafters made them removable; at least, some lawyers have concluded as much: ""The inclusion 
of 'mass actions' in [CAFA's] definition of 'class action' was a Congressional attempt to address notorious joinder abuses at the 
state level in Mississippi and other states."" Anthony Rollo & Gabriel A. Crowson, Mapping  [**37] the New Class Action Frontier - 
A Primer on the Class Action Fairness Act and Amended Federal Rule 23, 59 Consumer Fin. L. Q. Rep. 11, 14 (Spring-Summer 
2005); see also S. Amy Spencer, Once More Into the Breach, Dear Friends: The Case for Congressional Revision of the Mass 
Action Provisions in the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 39 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 1067, 1081 (2006) (discussing the mass action 
provision's attempt to address ""cases with claims joined under liberal West Virginia or Mississippi statutes""); 14B Charles A. 
Wright et al., Fed. Practice & Procedure § 3724, at 910-11 (4th ed. 2009) (""The mass actions made removable [by CAFA] 
typically are actions brought in states whose court systems do not provide for class actions.""); Knight, 78 Fordham L. Rev. at 
1878."
299,10," ""Indeed, [CAFA] is not complete without its exceptions."" Hollinger, 654 F.3d at 569. "
300,11," At least one court has found the exception applicable outside of the parens patriae context, in a case where the sole plaintiff 
was a citizen suing on behalf of the general public. Breakman v. AOL LLC, 545 F. Supp. 2d 96, 100-01 (D.D.C. 2008). The 
defendant conceded that the general public exception applied. Id. at 101."
300,12," The State further alleged that LCD panels are not minor components of those devices, claiming that LCD technology has a 
""virtually 100% market share for laptops and flat panel computer monitors, and at least 80% market share for flat panel TVs."" 
Docket No. 1-1, at 14."
300,13," Courts may take judicial notice of census data. Hollinger, 654 F.3d at 571-72 (""United States census data is an appropriate 
and frequent subject of judicial notice."") (citations omitted). "
302,14," In this discussion, ""individuals"" and ""individual claims"" includes consumers and local governments. "
303,15," Other courts have recognized the difficulty in construing CAFA's mass action provisions. The Eleventh Circuit found that 
""CAFA's mass action provisions present an opaque, baroque maze of interlocking cross-references that defy easy 
interpretation."" Lowery, 483 F.3d at 1198. The Ninth Circuit called the mass action  [**50] language ""bewildering"" and once 
declined to rule on some of its ""thorniest"" provisions. Abrego Abrego, 443 F.3d at 682, 686. Commentators have agreed. Andrew 
D. Weinstock & Philip G. Watson, Where Defendants Fear to Tread?, For The Defense, Apr. 2009, at 15, 17 (""Unfortunately, the 
language of the [mass action] provision is dense and ambiguous. . . . [Congress] passed a law that is puzzling, overly complex, 
and at times contradictory.""); Spencer, 39 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. at 1073 (""CAFA's plain language by no means provides clear 
guidelines for attorneys or the judiciary.""). Fortunately, then, mass actions ""are apparently not common. Clermont and Eisenberg's study [of federal cases decided under 
CAFA between February 18, 2005 and August 18, 2007] unearthed only two cases that involved a mass action and only three 
others that discussed a mass action."" Stephen B. Burbank, The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 in Historical Context: A 
Preliminary View, 156 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1439, 1449 n.29 (2008) (citing Clermont & Eisenberg, CAFA Judicata: A Tale of Waste and 
Politics, 156 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1553, 1566 n.34 (2008) (describing federal mass actions as ""rare""))."
303,16," In other cases, this sub-section has been moot because the action had already been transferred to a MDL court. E.g., Vioxx, 
2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2526, 2012 WL 10552. "
314,1," Verizon Communications, Inc. is the parent corporation of Verizon Florida, LLC. (Doc. # 9 at ¶ 5). The Court collectively refers 
to both entities as ""Verizon"" herein."
314,2," Basic local telephone services connect one customer to another using telephone lines or wires. (Id. at ¶ 18). Enhanced 
services include features such as voice mail. (Id.)."
314,3," AstroTel's Amended Complaint also contains ""Count 14"" in which AstroTel requests a permanent injunction. As HN1[
] a 
demand for relief is not a complaint count, it is not necessary to examine AstroTel's request for injunctive relief under the rubric 
of Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P. "
315,4," Although the Court could consider the external documents and convert the Motion to Dismiss into a Motion for Summary 
Judgment pursuant to Rule 12(d), Fed.R.Civ.P., the Court determines that it would not be appropriate to do so at this early 
juncture. The Court will give the parties an opportunity to conduct discovery before moving forward with Summary Judgment 
analysis."
315,5," HN5[
] As a general matter, antitrust law ""does not restrict the long recognized right of [a] trader or  [*7] manufacturer engaged in . . . business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to the parties with whom he will deal."" United 
States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307, 39 S. Ct. 465, 63 L. Ed. 992, 1919 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 460 (1919). "
316,6," Prof'l Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 56, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 
(1993)(defining ""sham litigation"" in the context of antitrust law); Andrx Pharms., Inc. v. Elan Corp., 421 F.3d 1227, 1233 (same)."
316,7," See, e.g., Conwood Co., L.P. v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 290 F.3d 768, 776, 783-88 (6th Cir. 2002)(finding Sherman violation when 
defendant (1) deliberately provided false information to retail establishments to exclude competitors from the market and (2) 
removed  [*11] the competitor's point of sale racks from retail establishments). "
321,8," At this juncture, the Court is not certain as to whether Verizon Florida LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary. HN28[
] If it is wholly 
owned by Verizon Communications, the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine cannot be overcome. However, if is a not a wholly 
owned subsidiary, AstroTel may be able to plead factors showing ""separateness of [the] subsidiary from its parent company"" in 
order to overcome the doctrine. Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 772, at n. 18. "
328,1," The FTC complaint quoted specific portions of the memoranda. For example: ""Budget continues in some markets to undercut 
us on One-Way rates. Either get below them or go up to a fair rate. Whatever you do, LET BUDGET KNOW. Contact a large 
Budget Dealer and tell them. Contact their company store and let the manager know . . . My direction is either get up to a fair 
rate or get down below the  [**4] competitor. EITHER WAY, LET THEM KNOW."" In re U-Haul Int'l, Inc., 2010 FTC LEXIS 61, 
2010 WL 2966779, at *2-3 (F.T.C. July 14, 2010)."
328,2," Specific examples of the comments included: ""we're very, very much trying to function a price leader [sic] and not give away 
[market] share""; ""me trying to get us to exercise price leadership every time we get what we consider to be an opportunity, it's 
another indicator to [Budget] as to, hey, don't throw the money away""; ""[i]f [Budget] cave[s] on prices the net effect is we got less 
money""; ""if [Budget] perceive[s]  [**5] that we'll let them come up a little bit [on price], I remain optimistic they'll come up, and it 
has a profound effect on us."" In re U-Haul Int'l, Inc., 2010 FTC LEXIS 61, 2010 WL 2966779 at *4-5. "
329,3," Whether prospective attorneys' fees would be included is a question we need not resolve. HN4[
] Spielman v. Genzyme Corp., 251 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2001), held that the plaintiff's own fees could be included in a chapter 93A claim but not those of 
the class; but Spielman was not dealing there with CAFA which looks to aggregated class damages to meet the $5 million 
threshold. "
330,4," HN7[
] Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, does cover ""attempt[s] to monopolize""; and one circuit court did treat a failed attempt to conspire in a two-carrier market as attempt at ""shared"" monopolization, United States v. Am. Airlines, 
Inc., 743 F.2d 1114 (5th Cir. 1984)--a debatable approach. VI Areeda Antitrust Law ¶ 1407 , at 36-39 (1986) [**11] ."
330,5," HN9[
] FTC Summary, 75 Fed. Reg. at 35034 (""[I]nvitations to collude increase the risk of anticompetitive harm to consumers, and as such, can violate Section 5 of the FTC Act.""); see also id. at 35034 n.3 (listing prior FTC actions based on invitations to 
collude); In re Valassis Commc'ns, Inc., 2006 WL 1367833 (F.T.C. Apr. 19, 2006); In re Stone Container Corp., 125 F.T.C. 853, 
854 (1998). "
331,6," U-Haul argues that Liu must satisfy the FTC's ""consumer injury test"" to state a claim for unfairness under Chapter 93A. The test 
is limited to consumer unfairness claims and does not govern Liu's claim based on an alleged unfair method of competition. See 
FTC Policy Statement on Unfairness appended to In re Int'l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949, 1070-76 (1984). "
332,7," A manager might well have balked at calling Budget if the knowledge that price-fixing is a federal felony carrying a jail sentence 
has spread beyond lawyers. But managers could easily not understand that merely raising prices would be a basis for civil 
actions under section 5 and chapter 93A if the increases were part of Shoen's plan that the increases be accompanied by calls. "
345,1," REPORTER'S NOTE: Pursuant to the authority vested in the Supreme Court by K.S.A. 20-3002(c), Judge Thomas E. Malone, 
of the Kansas Court of Appeals, was appointed to hear case No. 101,000 to fill the vacancy on the court created by the 
retirement of Chief Justice McFarland. "
368,1," REPORTER'S NOTE: Pursuant to the authority vested in the Supreme Court by K.S.A. 20-3002(c), Judge Thomas E. Malone, 
of the Kansas Court of Appeals, was appointed to hear case No. 101,000 to fill the vacancy on the court created by the 
retirement of Chief Justice McFarland. "
370,1," Remaining Defendants AB Conduit, Ticor Title, and American Home Mortgage Servicing Inc. have not appeared in this action 
and the Notice of Removal states that they have not been served with the summons and complaint. See Dkt. # 1. Plaintiff's 
complaint was filed on October 17, 2011. No proof of service of summons and complaint against these Defendants has been 
filed. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) provides that ""[i]f a defendant is not served within 120 days after the complaint is filed 
the court - on motion or on its own after notice to the plaintiff - must dismiss the action without prejudice against that defendant 
or order that service be made within a specified time."" Accordingly, Plaintiff is ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE in writing why this 
action should not be dismissed without prejudice against Ticor Title, AB Conduit and American Home Mortgaging Service Inc. 
Plaintiff shall file proof of service of summons and complaint evidencing that Defendants were served within Rule 4(m)'s 120-day 
window or show good cause for her failure to do so. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m). Plaintiff's response is due no later than May 23, 
2012."
370,2," On June 30, 2011, MERS, as nominee for AB Conduit, executed the Corporate Assignment of the Deed of Trust (the 
""Assignment"") resulting in the assignment of all beneficial interest under the Deed of Trust to RCS. Garber Decl. ¶ 6. "
379,1," The Agreement was entered into by Motorola Inc. and Motorola Industrial, Ltda. (collectively ""Motorola"") and CT. [DE1-3, 
Ex.A]."
379,2," For present purposes, the currently operative pleading is CT's Amended Counterclaim. [DE15]. "
392,1," The Biovail defendants have changed their names or corporate structures following a merger. See Notice of Change of Names 
of Biovail Defs. (08-cv-2431 ECF No. 407; 08-cv-2433 ECF No. 375). For the sake of continuity, the Court will continue to refer 
to these defendants collectively as ""Biovail."""
392,2," The facts here are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The Court will frequently cite to the following documents: Biovail Stmt. 
(ECF No. 413/ECF No. 381); GSK Stmt. (ECF No. 411/ECF No. 379); Pls.' Stmt. Resp. (ECF No. 431/ECF No. 394); Pls.' Stmt. 
(ECF No. 430/ECF No. 393). Where the Court refers to ECF numbers in this memorandum, the first number listed corresponds 
to the docket entry in 08-cv-2431, and the second corresponds to 08-cv-2433. The Court will cite Biovail exhibits as ""BX,"" GSK 
exhibits as ""GX,"" and plaintiffs' exhibits as ""PX."" "
393,3," In 2007, Congress amended the FDCA to provide that the FDA shall not delay approval of an ANDA on account of a pending 
citizen petition unless the FDA determines that ""a delay is necessary to protect the public health."" Food & Drug Administration 
Amendments Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-85, § 914, 121 Stat. 823, 954 (2007) (codified as amended at 21 U.S.C. § 
355(q)(1)(A)(ii)). The 2007 amendments occurred after Biovail filed its citizen petition and are not applicable to this case. "
394,4," The Third Circuit has applied the sham exception to petitions to the Department of Commerce and the U.S. International Trade 
Commission. Cheminor Drugs, Ltd. v. Ethyl Corp., 168 F.3d 119, 123 (3d Cir. 1999). However, it does not appear to have 
decided whether the sham exception applies to FDA citizen petitions. Biovail does not dispute that the sham exception applies to its citizen petition. See Biovail Br. 47. The Court therefore does not 
address the argument considered and rejected by the court in In re Prograf Antitrust Litigation that the sham exception to Noerr-
Pennington immunity is unavailable in the FDA citizen petition context. See In re Prograf Antitrust Litig., No. 11-md-2242, 2012 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12053, 2012 WL 293850, at *5 (D. Mass. Feb. 1, 2012). In that case, the antitrust defendant cited Kottle v. Nw. 
Kidney Centers for the proposition that the sham exception does not apply because the FDA resembles a political entity more 
than a judicial body. See Kottle v. Nw. Kidney Ctrs., 146 F.3d 1056, 1062 (9th Cir. 1998)  [*14] (""Only when administrative 
officials must follow rules is it meaningful to ask whether a petition before an agency was 'objectively baseless' . . . .""). The 
Prograf court rejected the application of Kottle. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12053, 2012 WL 293850, at *5; see also In re Flonase 
Antitrust Litig., 795 F. Supp. 2d 300, 310 n.11 (E.D. Pa. 2011). "
395,5," The Supreme Court compared the notion of probable cause here to the same notion in the common law tort of wrongful civil 
proceedings, frequently called ""malicious prosecution."" PRE, 508 U.S. at 62, 62 n.7.  [*15] In PRE, the Court also cited the 
standard from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 in finding that the defendant's copyright action was ""warranted by existing law"" 
or, at the very least, ""based on an objectively good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law."" Id. 
at 65. Justice Souter's concurrence cautioned, however, against ""transplanting every substantive nuance and procedural quirk of 
the common-law tort of wrongful civil proceedings into federal antitrust law."" Id. at 67 (Souter J., concurring)."
395,6," ""Whether conduct in procuring or enforcing a patent is sufficient to strip a patentee of its immunity from the antitrust laws is to 
be decided as a question  [*17] of Federal Circuit law."" Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1068 (Fed. 
Cir. 1998); see also Honeywell Int'l Inc. v. Univ. Avionics Sys. Corp., 488 F.3d 982, 1000-01 (Fed. Cir. 2007); In re Wellbutrin SR 
Antitrust Litig., No. 05-396, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9687, 2006 WL 616292, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 9, 2006). "
396,7," The plaintiffs argue that the proper burden of proof is the preponderance of the evidence standard for civil cases, but cite only 
one case, which predates PRE, in support of this proposition. See Litton Sys., Inc. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 700 F.2d 785, 813 (2d 
Cir. 1983) (""We see no reason to impose any higher burden of proof on the antitrust plaintiff asserting sham than would 
ordinarily be applicable in any civil issue.""). To the extent that non-Federal Circuit law from before PRE is relevant, the Court 
notes that case law from other circuits adopted a clear and convincing evidence standard. See Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc., 
743 F.2d 1282, 1288 (9th Cir. 1984) (requiring clear and convincing evidence of bad faith prosecution of patent suit); MCI 
Commc'ns. Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1155 (7th Cir. 1983) (approving jury instructions that emphasized the 
clear and convincing  [*20] evidence standard, on account of the First Amendment concerns at issue)."
396,8," The Orange Book also listed the '327 patent as covering Wellbutrin XL. Infringement of the '327 patent was asserted in the 
Anchen, Abrika, and Watson lawsuits, but claims relating to the '327 patent were eventually dropped from each of the cases. 
See BX 12 (Anchen); BX 13 (Abrika); BX 14 (Watson). The Court does not understand the plaintiffs to be challenging conduct 
relating to the '327 patent as a violation of the antitrust laws. "
399,9," HN10[
] The infringement provision of the Hatch-Waxman  [*31] Act, 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(2)(A), states that it is an act of infringement to submit an ANDA that describes a drug claimed in a patent. Thus, the patent holder may sue before the product 
goes to market. "
400,10," The Court notes that although Judge Selna later changed his mind, his minute order on summary judgment had tentatively 
found a genuine issue as to what the FDA's ANDA requirements were as to Anchen. Tentative Summ. J. Order 13-17 (BX 34). Similarly, although the Court of Appeals did not have the opportunity to opine on the Anchen case, the panel at oral argument 
repeatedly asked Anchen's counsel questions about whether the FDA required hydrochloric acid to be listed and quantified if it 
tended to stabilize the product. See, e.g., Biovail Reply Ex. D at 16-17. "
403,11," Although there are scattered references in the '341 patent to the USP, they do not relate to the dissolution profile testing 
conditions. See, e.g., '341 Patent col. 3, ll. 28-31 (BX 1). "
404,12," Thus, Abrika used the pH switch test as part of its quality control parameters for its enteric-coated product in its ANDA 
submission. Kaplan Rpt. ¶ 99 (July 20, 2011) (BX 121). "
410,13," The FDA also requested that GSK conduct dose dumping testing for Wellbutrin XL itself in October 2006. See PX 487 at 
GSKWXL50373034 (referencing correspondence from October 13, 2006). "
411,14," The plaintiffs have not elaborated upon whether, in their view, the petition must be the but-for or proximate cause, or whether 
the petition must be the sole cause of the favorable outcome, or just one contributing cause. Nor have they cited any case law 
discussing the proper standard."
411,15," In addition, the plaintiffs cite two paragraphs in the report of the defendants' expert, Douglas Sporn, for the proposition that the 
Citizen Petition had no impact on the FDA's policy and practice regarding  [*76] alcohol-related dose dumping. Pls.' Br. 100 
(citing Sporn Rpt. ¶¶ 94, 95 (PX 80)). But the Court does not read Mr. Sporn's report as an expert admission that the Citizen 
Petition had no impact on the FDA's policy and practice on dose dumping. Rather, Mr. Sporn appeared to be commenting on the 
impact of the Citizen Petition as to the timing of FDA action - that is, opining that the Petition did not cause the delay in ANDA 
approval, which is an element of the plaintiffs' affirmative antitrust case. Sporn Rpt. ¶¶ 94, 95 (PX 80). "
414,16," The Court considered the request as to the hydroxy-metabolite, which the FDA granted, above. "
416,17," In October 2008, the FDA's Division of Bioequivalence wrote to Teva Pharmaceuticals regarding a proposed generic version 
of 300 mg Wellbutrin XL. In that letter, the FDA recommended measuring the parent compound as well as all three active 
metabolites in a study for individuals who complained of suffering from adverse events or lack-of-effect when switching from 
Wellbutrin XL to Teva's generic equivalent. BX 103 at TEVA_WXL00483-84. This information was not available to Biovail at 
 [*94] the time the Citizen Petition was filed, however."
416,18," See BX 99 at 86 (showing an AUC ratio of 0.89 for Wellbutrin XL as compared with IR). The AUC is a measurement of the 
extent to which a drug stays in the body and for how long. An AUC ratio of 0.89 for Wellbutrin XL means that XL's AUC is 11% 
lower than that of IR. Fleischer Rpt. ¶ 13 (BX 124). "
429,1," Plaintiff refers to himself as ""Rick Favaloro, J.D.,"" and states that he is ""a licensed Texas attorney with a perfect ethical record,""

or suspended except pursuant to a procedure which is fair and reasonable and is carried out in good faith. In no event shall

436,1," Any harm that accrues after the tolling of the statute of limitations periods but that is associated with an overt act that occurred 
prior to the limitations period is not remediable. However, ""each separate cause of action that so accrues [during the statute of 
limitations period] entitles a plaintiff to recover not only those damages which he has suffered at the date of accrual, but also 
those which he will suffer in the future from the particular invasion, including what he has suffered during and will predictably 
suffer after trial."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338-39, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971). "
439,1," ""DUMF"" refers to the Amended Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts and Supporting Evidence in Support of 
Defendant's Motions for Summary Judgment, or, in the alternative Summary Adjudication of Issues. See Court's Docket, Doc. 
No. 50. ""AMF"" refers to Weco's Statement of Additional Disputed Material Facts. See id., Doc. No. 57-1. ""PRDUMF"" refers to 
Weco's Response to Sherwin-Williams' Amended Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts. See id. ""DRAMF"" refers to 
Sherwin-Williams' Response to Weco's Additional Disputed Facts. See id. Doc. No. 60-1. The Court will note any factual 
disputes where they exist, and, for purposes of summary judgment, will construe any ambiguities in the light most  [*3] favorable 
to Weco, the non-moving party. See Stegall v. Citadel Broad, Inc., 350 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir. 2003). The Court notes Weco has filed written objections to the Declarations of Harvey Hill, William Turner, and Robert Latunski filed in 
support of the motion to dismiss. See Court's Docket, No. 57-2. Sherwin-Williams has filed written objections to the Declaration 
of John Sorensen filed in support of Weco's Opposition. See Court's Docket, Doc. No. 61. To the extent the facts set forth in the 
declarations are disputed, the Court does not rely on them, and therefore makes no rulings on the evidentiary objections, at the 
summary judgment stage."
439,2," Weco contends the ""Ultra"" product line is Sherwin-Williams ""top-of-the-line"" automotive paint and is much more expensive than 
the ""Western"" product line. See AMF No. 20; Sorensen Decl. ¶ 7. "
440,3," As discussed below, this order is the subject of Sherwin-Williams' counterclaims. See UMF No. 43; PRUMF No. 43."
440,4," Weco disputes this and maintains that, in or about 2006, it offered paint manufactured by Matrix as an alternative to Sherwin-
Williams ""Ultra"" paint line, but only after Mastercraft and Color Glow asked for a more affordable alternative, and only so that it 
wouldn't lose Mastercraft and Color Glow's premium paint business. See PRUMF No. 19; Sorensen Depo. 156:11-158:7; 
Sorensen Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9. Weco contends it neither wanted nor attempted to replace Sherwin-Williams ""Western"" paint with any 
other paint. See AMF No. 22; Sorensen Decl. ¶¶ 8, 9."
440,5," Sherwin-Williams contends it began selling directly in order to preserve Mastercraft and Color Glow's business because it 
viewed Weco as a competitor once Weco began offering other manufacturers' products. See UMF No. 21. Latunski Decl. ¶¶ 4, 
8; Turner Decl. ¶¶ 7-8. Weco disputes this and argues Sherwin-Williams offered to sell to Mastercraft and Color Glow because it 
wanted to ""get rid"" of its jobbers, and Weco, in particular. See PRUMF No. 21; Barcellos Depo. 43:11-20."
440,6, Weco contends Sherwin-Williams already had this information. See Sorensen Decl. ¶19. 
443,11," Further, Sherwin-Williams maintains it increased its profit margin by selling directly because the prices it charged to end users 
were greater than the prices it charged to Weco. Sherwin-Williams offers evidence that the packaging of the product remained 
the same, and there were no increased delivery costs because Mastercraft and Color Glow were added to an existing delivery 
route. As discussed above, Weco argues Sherwin-Williams necessarily incurred higher  [*19] costs due to an increased number 
of deliveries and the attendant increases in fuel and labor costs. However, there is no evidence that these costs would have 
been greater than the price Sherwin-Williams charged to Mastercraft and Color Glow. "
446,12," Sherwin-Williams also contends its decided to discontinue the ""Western"" line in order to comply with government clean air 
regulations. Under Ohio law, ""[w]here performance of a contractual promise is rendered impossible by the law, nonperformance 
is excused."" Toledo Police Patrolmen's Assn., Local 10, IUPA v. Toledo, 94 Ohio App.3d 734, 739, 641 N.E.2d 799, 802 (Ohio 
App. 1994). However, there is no evidence that the ""Western"" paint line violated any specific regulations, only that Sherwin-
Williams discontinued  [*30] the ""Western"" line to replace it ""with higher quality paint lines, which were also more compliant with 
increasingly stringent limitations on Volatile Organic Compounds, or VOC's."" Latunski Decl. ¶ 7. Thus, there is no evidence that 
it was ""impossible"" to maintain an adequate stock of the ""Western"" products to service Weco's needs."
446,12," However, it is undisputed that Sherwin-Williams ""eventually"" discontinued the ""Western"" line. See UMF No. 44; PRUMF No. 
44. "
447,13," In light of the parties' briefs, the court assumes that under Ohio law summary judgment based on an alleged breach of a 
contract's  [*33] express terms does not automatically require dismissal of a breach of contract claim premised on the implied 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In the event Ohio law is to the contrary, the court will give leave to file a supplemental 
dispositive motion."
447,14," To the extent Sherwin-Williams seeks to enforce the limitation of remedies clause  [*35] with respect to Weco's claim for 
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, the Court finds that the clause is unconscionable under Ohio law. 
""Limitation-of-liability clauses are viewed critically, but may be freely bargained for in Ohio and will be enforced 'absent important 
public policy concerns, unconscionability, or vague and ambiguous terms.'"" Doe v. SexSearch.com, 551 F.3d 412, 419 (6th Cir. 
2008). The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that ""[u]nconscionability has generally been recognized to include an absence of 
meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties together with contract terms which are unreasonably favorable to the other 
party."" Lake Ridge Academy v. Carney, 66 Ohio St. 3d 376, 383, 613 N.E.2d 183 (1993). Here, the limitation of liability clause is 
unreasonably favorable to Sherwin-Williams because it gives Weco no recourse for any wrongful act against it, related to the 
Jobber Agreement or not, and whether intentional or not. See FAC, Ex. A ¶ 6b. Weco also contends that the Jobber Agreement 
was not negotiated, and that after twenty-seven years of business, Weco was faced with the decision between signing the "
448,," agreement or risking the loss of its business  [*36] relationship with Sherwin-Williams. See Sorensen Decl. ¶ 11. For these 
reasons, the Court finds that the limitation of remedies clause is unenforceable."
448,15," The FACC also asserts counterclaims for ""Goods Sold and Delivered"" and ""Account Stated."" FACC ¶¶ 10-15. These causes 
of action are premised on the same facts as the breach of contract counterclaim and also seek payment of the $135,083.27 
allegedly due and owing. Sherwin-Williams makes no argument with respect to its counterclaims for misappropriation of trade 
secrets or unfair competition. "
454,1," These three cases also happen to be the only citations in Amex III that support its ""vindication of rights"" analysis. See Amex III, 
667 F.3d at 219. This is of course self-referential: the citation of Second Circuit opinions by the district courts of this Circuit is not 
a form of endorsement. "
456,2," Amex III asserts that ""[o]ther Circuits permit plaintiffs to challenge class-action waivers on the grounds that prosecuting such 
claims on an individual basis would be a cost prohibitive method of enforcing a statutory right,"" Amex III, 667 F.3d at 216-17 
(citing In re Cotton Yarn Antitrust Litig., 505 F.3d 274, 285 (4th Cir. 2007); Livingston v. Assocs. Fin., Inc., 339 F.3d 553, 555, 
557 (7th Cir. 2003); Adkins v. Labor Ready, Inc., 303 F.3d 496, 502-03 (4th Cir. 2002). Each of those opinions quotes the 
""prohibitive costs"" passage of Green Tree, but none uses the phrase as Amex III uses it--and all find in favor of the party seeking 
to enforce the arbitration clause. For one thing, the plaintiffs in each case failed to provide non-conclusory cost evidence. 
Notably, in Livingston and Adkins (upon which Cotton Yarn relies) the plaintiffs  [**27] had raised the specter of prohibitive 
arbitration fees--not expenses incident to litigation. See Livingston, 339 F.3d at 557 (""Tellingly, [plaintiffs'] only 'evidence' of 
prohibitive arbitration costs is an unsubstantiated and vague assertion that discovery in an unrelated arbitration matter disclosed 
fees of nearly $2,000 per day.""); Adkins, 303 F.3d at 503 (""[Plaintiff] does not even provide any evidence about the most basic 
element of this challenge: the size of the allegedly 'prohibitive' arbitration fee itself.""). These cases were thus concerned about 
the price of admission. "
457,3," It evidently did not occur to French or the panel that the rules of evidence do not govern arbitration, and that an arbitrator can 
consult treatises and articles for relevant antitrust and economic principles, and should do so in some cases. "
489,1," The claims against some of the individual defendants were dismissed prior to trial. The remaining individual defendants are Eric 
A. Nielsen, John Traut and Alan Watts. On appeal, the assertions against them are not distinct from the claims against the 
Association itself. When we refer to the Association as a party in this opinion, we are referring to the entity and the three 
members collectively. "
490,2," ""The Port of Baltimore plays a vital role in Maryland's economy, generating $3.2 billion in annual revenue and local purchases, 
as well as supporting 50,700 jobs."" Maryland At A Glance: Port of Baltimore, Maryland State Archives (Mar. 27, 2012),

490,3," Some background information in this opinion derives from the fiscal notes of Senate Bill 237 (2000) and House Bill 884 (2004). 
As we will discuss more fully infra, Senate Bill 237 established a State Board of Docking Masters; House Bill 884 abolished the 
State Board of Docking Masters and transferred  [***6] the regulatory authority of such masters to the State Board of Pilots. We 
will use these fiscal notes to aid our discussion of pilotage in Maryland. See Robey v. State, 397 Md. 449, 457, 918 A.2d 499

491,4," At the time of trial, KMTC was owned by Krause's wife, Joann Krause, and his son, David Krause. From 1989 to 2000, Krause 
was a part owner of KMTC. In 2000, Krause relinquished his stake in KMTC. "
492,5," This principle was confirmed by the testimony of Captain Michael Duarte, a docking master in Boston's harbors and KMTC's 
expert witness on tugboat capabilities, who agreed that a docking master  [***11] must exercise discretion in ""choosing how to 
accomplish a particular job"" and stated further that this ""would have a lot to do with the docking pilot, his experience, knowing his 
boats and the people running the boats . . . and knowing the waters and the berths."" "
494,6," ""Bollard pull"" is a term for the towing capacity of a tug."
494,7," In its brief, KMTC asserts that it ""does not challenge the rotation system itself"" but rather challenges ""the aspect of the 
Association's work rule rotation system . . . that restrains and excludes [KMTC] from competing to serve some of its own 
customers."" To the extent we can distinguish  [***19] these two positions, we interpret this to mean that KMTC only criticizes the 
rotation system as it affects its preexisting contracts with shipping lines, not as it operates generally."
494,8," We have selected the third issue partly as a result of a process of elimination. With regard to the first issue, we cannot 
determine whether the concerted action by the Pilot Defendants could constitute a conspiracy to violate § 1 of the Sherman Act 
because the record contains very little relevant information. See American Needle, Inc. v. NFL,     U.S.    , 130 S. Ct. 2201, 2209, 
176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (Whether parties are engaged in a conspiracy to violate § 1 of the Sherman Act is not based upon 
legal formalities but rather on ""a functional consideration of how the parties involved in the alleged anticompetitive conduct 
actually operate.""). As for issue two, the Association claims that it is immune from liability under the state action doctrine.  [***21] The state action 
doctrine is an affirmative defense to an antitrust claim that requires a defendant to show ""first, [that] the State has articulated a 
clear and affirmative policy to allow the anticompetitive conduct, and second, [that] the State provides active supervision of [the 
alleged] anticompetitive conduct undertaken by private actors."" FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 631, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 
119 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1992) (citation omitted). Because the trial court resolved this case on a motion for judgment, the Association "
495,," was never required to present evidence on its state action defense. Thus, the record is scant as to the degree to which the 
Board actually supervised the Association's work rules. With regard to issue four, the trial court's order granting judgment gives us no indication as to whether the court concluded 
KMTC's evidence as to damages was credible. Finally, we will not focus on the argument that most, but not all, of KMTC's claimed damages were time-barred because 
resolving this issue would not fully address the disputes between the parties. In contrast, the record is sufficient for us to determine whether the anti-competitive effects of the Association's work rules are 
reasonable. Moreover,  [***22] in light of the importance of docking masters to the efficient operation of the Port of Baltimore, 
resolution of this question is in the public interest. "
496,9," A ""rule of reason"" analysis is conducted in various stages, where each party must satisfy an initial burden before a court 
conducts a complete review of the relevant facts. As stated in Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 
317 (2d Cir. 2008): HN8[
] Under the rule of reason, the plaintiffs bear an initial burden to demonstrate the defendants' challenged behavior 
had an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market. Because the antitrust laws protect 
competition as a whole, evidence that plaintiffs have been harmed as individual competitors will not suffice. If the plaintiffs 
satisfy their initial burden, the burden shifts to the defendants to offer evidence of the pro-competitive effects of their 
agreement. Assuming defendants can provide such proof, the burden shifts back to the plaintiffs to prove that any 
legitimate competitive benefits offered by defendants could have been achieved through less restrictive means. Ultimately, 
the factfinder must engage in a careful weighing of the competitive effects of the agreement—both pro and con—to 
determine if the effects of  [***27] the challenged restraint tend to promote or destroy competition. (Citation omitted). For purposes of this discussion, we will assume that each party has met its initial burdens and perform a full 
""rule of reason"" analysis. "
497,10," The text of the law is accessible at the Maryland State Archives website (vol. 204 in the online version) available at:

497,11," As stated in the Preamble to Maryland's Pilotage Act of 1787: WHEREAS it is necessary for the safety and preservation of vessels bound from this state to sea, or coming into 
Chesapeake bay . . . that able and experienced pilots should be established to conduct and pilot such vessels, for 
reasonable fees, to their several  [***31] moorings, and that ignorant and unskillful persons should be prevented from 
undertaking such pilotage. . . ."
497,1787, Md. Laws (November Session) at 277. 
498,12," The concept of a centralized entity for collecting pilotage fees developed incrementally. By Chapter 214 of the acts of 1853, 
the ""board of pilots"" was charged with collecting license fees from vessels exempted from the mandatory pilotage requirement 
and distributing those revenues to licensed pilots. 1853 Md. Laws 278. The 1853 statute was codified as Article 74 § 19 of the 
Code of 1860. Shortly thereafter, the ""board of pilots"" was charged with collecting all pilotage fees. See Chapter 25, Acts of 
1866, 1866 Md. Laws 35. This arrangement remained in effect for nearly a century. See MD. ANN. CODE (1904) Art. 74, § 19 
 [***34] and MD. ANN. CODE (1924) Art. 74, § 19. By Chapter 523 of the Acts of 1947, the Association was designated as the 
collection agent. 1947 Md. Laws 1282. Substantially the same statutory provision appeared in the 1951 and 1957 Codes, see 
MD. ANN. CODE (1951) Art. 74, § 12; MD. ANN. CODE (1957) Art. 74, § 1019, as well as in the current Act. "
499,13," Not all bay pilots in Maryland waters hold a license issued by the Board. The United States Coast Guard licenses pilots for 
vessels that travel from one domestic port to another, see 46 U.S.C. § 8502 (2006), while Maryland licenses pilots for ships 
bound to or coming from foreign ports. BOP § 11-501; see also Alex A. Parks & Edward V. Cattell, Jr., THE LAW OF TUG, TOW, AND PILOTAGE 991 (3rd ed. 1994) (""In the United States, vessels engaged in the coastwise trade [i.e., from one domestic port to 
another] must be piloted by holders of Coast Guard-issued licenses, while vessels involved in foreign trade . . . must employ 
state-licensed pilots."")."
499,14," § 11-603. Licensed pilot — Conflicts of interest. HN14[
] (a) Prohibited. — A licensed pilot may not engage in conduct that constitutes a conflict of interest. (b) Circumstances. — A conflict of interest exists in situations in which: (1) except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a licensed pilot solicits or accepts financial or other consideration of 
value from a tugboat, towing, vessel-assist, vessel-owning, or vessel-chartering company, or an agent or officer of that 
company, or from any other entity providing services in the port community; (2) a licensed pilot takes any action with the intent to benefit or harm the economic interests of a tugboat, towing, vessel-
assist, vessel-owning, or vessel-chartering company, or any other entity providing services in the port community; (3) a licensed pilot allows personal financial interests to conflict with professional responsibilities; (4) a licensed pilot solicits  [***38] business for a tugboat, towing, vessel-assist, vessel-owning, or vessel-chartering 
company, or any other entity providing services in the port community; or (5) a licensed pilot discourages a person from engaging the services of a tugboat, towing, vessel-assist, vessel-owning, or 
vessel-chartering company, or any other entity providing services in the port community. (c) Circumstances — Conflict does not exist. — A conflict of interest does not exist in situations in which: (1) remuneration is paid to the pilot through the Association in return for the provision of pilotage services; or (2) there is an exchange of nominal social pleasantries between the licensed pilot and any entity providing services to the 
port community. "
501,15," Nor was there any evidence produced, assuming the job could be performed by another tug company, as to why KMTC could 
not purchase more modern equipment, with increased horsepower and maneuverability, to compete more effectively with the 
other tug companies and avoid this problem altogether."
501,16," Article 24 provides: HN15[
] That no man ought to be taken or imprisoned  [***46] or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or 
outlawed, or exiled, or, in any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty or property, but by the judgment of his 
peers, or by the Law of the land."
501,17," The protections afforded by Article 24 extend to equal protection of the laws. See, e.g., State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws v. 
Board of Supvrs., 342 Md. 586, 595 n.6, 679 A.2d 96 (1996). "
502,18," As stated in appellants' amended complaint, Krause requested that the trial court declare BOP § 11-603, ""and any other 
piloting law requiring Joseph Krause to practice his profession only through membership in the Association, to be an unlawful 
restraint of the right of freedom of contract . . . ."" In opening statements on the State's motion for summary judgment, counsel for 
Krause emphasized that ""Captain Krause is challenging the validity of the statute as a whole"" and that ""[t]he State will argue this 
is not a facial attack, but it is."" Again, in their opposition to the State's motion for judgment, appellants urged that ""[b]oth 
 [***49] Krause Marine and Captain Krause assert that the Pilots Act is an unlawful restraint on their respective freedoms of 
contract."""
502,19," To understand Krause's volte face, we must return briefly to the proceedings before the trial court and consider an affirmative 
defense raised by the State. Prior to filing the current action, Krause was the subject of an administrative disciplinary proceeding brought by the Board 
against him for an alleged violation of § 11-603. The Board prevailed before the administrative law judge. Krause sought judicial 
review and, eventually, the administrative decision was affirmed in part and reversed in part by a panel of this Court in State 
Board of Pilots v. Krause, No. 2979, September Term, 2007, (filed July 24, 2009), cert. denied, 411 Md. 357, 983 A.2d 432 
(2009). Krause did not challenge the constitutionality of § 11-603 in that proceeding. Before the trial court in the instant case, the State asserted that Krause waived the right to challenge § 11-603 by failing to rase 
it in the administrative proceeding. In response, Krause argued that the requirement of exhaustion of administrative remedies 
was inapplicable because he was challenging the Pilots Act as a whole, citing Ins. Comm'r v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of 
the United States, 339 Md. 596, 619, 664 A.2d 862 (1995).  [***50] Krause was adamant about characterizing his claim as a "
503,," facial attack on the constitutionality of the Act (as opposed to a challenge to a discrete, fact-specific situation) to rebut the 
""exhaustion of administrative remedies"" defense proffered by the State."
503,20," Our own review of the Act leads us to conclude that no single provision of the Act requires pilots to be members of the 
Association.  [***51] BOP § 11-603(c)(1) prohibits pilots from receiving remuneration for their services other than through the 
Association and BOP § 11-505(a)(2)(iii) requires the Association to distribute net fees to ""regularly working licensed pilots who 
are members in good standing of the Association."" The two statutes operate together to impose an effective requirement of 
Association membership, at least for those pilots who wish to earn a living through their services. Krause cannot simultaneously 
assert that ""this is not a challenge to . . . the 'conflict of interest' provision, § 11-603"" while also contending that this ""is a 
challenge only to the required Association membership"" when § 11-603 is an integral part of the statutory scheme requiring 
membership. "
509,1," Because oral argument would not be of material assistance, the Court orders these matters submitted on the briefs. E.D. Cal. 
Local Rule 78-230(h)."
509,2," To the extent possible, the following facts are taken from Plaintiffs' FAC (ECF No. 1.) For the purposes of this Motion, the Court 
accepts Plaintiffs' facts as true and makes all inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs."
509,3," In 2008, Plaintiffs again refinanced the property into an ARM with Wells Fargo. (ECF No. 7, Ex. C.) "
510,4," Negative  [*4] amortization refers to the situation where a loan payment for a particular period is less than the interest charged 
for that period, so the balance owed on the loan increases over time."
510,5," All further references to ""Rule"" or ""Rules"" are to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure unless otherwise noted. "
514,6," Further, Plaintiffs' contention that the three-year statute of limitations may apply to their damages claim misconstrues the 
statute: the one-year limitations period applies to damages claims, the three-year period applies to rescission claims. Cf. 15 
U.S.C. §§ 1640, 1640(e) and 15 U.S.C. §§ 1635, 1635(f). "
517,7, Defendants have not yet filed an Opposition to the Motions for TRO/PI and an expedited hearing. 
570,1," Hughes further  [**44] argues that the Intake notes are inadmissible because they are unreliable and represent multiple levels 
of hearsay. Hughes Suppl. Mem. at 14-16. Neither of these arguments has merit. Hughes contends that the notes are unreliable 
because they reflect confusion and contain inconsistent statements. Id. at 14-15. But the inconsistencies in the notes can be 
taken into account in assessing their probative value. There is no reason why the confusion reflected in the notes need bar their 
inadmissibility altogether. Hughes further contends that the notes ""present multiple levels of hearsay, as they purport to reflect 
the out of court statements of three different declarants: the intake screening person, Mr. Hughes, and O/P."" Id. at 15-16. But 
Hughes himself seems to recognize that the hearsay of whomever wrote the notes is admissible under the business records 
exception. Id. at 15. And Hughes' own statements about the transaction are not hearsay at all, as they are not being admitted for 
their truth — that what Hughes said was true or that ""O/P"" actually said those things — but rather as evidence of what Hughes 
thought about the transaction when he spoke to Weinstock. For example, even if Hughes  [**45] were incorrect in his 
representation that ""he isn't on the deed but does have a lease,"" that would nonetheless be probative of what Hughes thought at 
that time about whether he was on the deed. "
573,2," If the Court ultimately concludes that there is a contract between Wells Fargo and Hughes, then under Schiff the judgment for 
unjust enrichment will have to be vacated. "
577,1," 15 U.S.C. § 1. Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; penalty Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony ... "
578,2," 15 U.S.C. § 2. Monopolizing trade a felony; penalty Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize  [*6] any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed 
guilty of a felony ..."
578,3," In its Opposition Brief, High Tek attempts to explain why it believes that Ishida parts is the relevant market. For example, it 
argues that Ishida equipment is the ""premium brand,"" the ""gold standard"" of weighing and packaging equipment, that Ishida 
equipment is utilized by a majority of manufacturers and distributors of packaging equipment. Facts not alleged in the Complaint 
will not prevent dismissal for failure to state a claim. Without deciding whether the additional facts are sufficient to state a Section 
2 Sherman Act claim, the Court will permit High Tek to amend its Complaint to allege additional  [*8] facts."
578,4," The term ""monopolize,"" as used in the federal antitrust laws, means the power either to obtain, or to maintain, the power to 
remove or exclude competitors from the field of competition in a particular business or industry. Since H&C is the exclusive 
distributor of Ishida parts, H&C maintains its so-called monopoly power to purchase Ishida parts because of H&C's contract with 
Ishida to be the exclusive North American distributor for Ishida parts, not because of any of the alleged anticompetitive behavior. 
Additionally, High Tek's theory, that because it is a competitor that has been harmed, that H&C has harmed competition does 
not state a claim under the antitrust laws. ""[T]he plaintiff here must allege and prove harm, not just to a single competitor, but to 
the competitive process, i.e., to competition itself."" NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 135, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 
2d 510 (1998). "
588,*," Hon. Sandra Day O'Connor, Associate  [**2] Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation. "
589,1," Specifically, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 17:46B-45(c) provides that ""[a]ny person or organization aggrieved with respect to any filing 
which is in effect, may make written application to the commissioner for a hearing thereon,"" which the commissioner will review 
to determine if a hearing is necessary. Id. at § 17:46B-45(c). At oral argument, Appellants admitted that they have not 
challenged the Appellees' title insurance rates in a formal administrative hearing. "
592,2," Although Appellants state in their complaint that the DOBI has not obtained the type of data necessary to determine whether 
Appellees' title insurance rates ""conformed to . . . statutory requirements,"" App. at 81, they nonetheless concede that the DOBI 
approved Appellees' rates, see App. at 82. Under New Jersey law, such approval necessarily requires a determination that the 
rates are ""not unreasonably high, and are not inadequate for the safeness and  [**17] soundness of the insurer, and are not 
unfairly discriminatory."" N.J. Stat. Ann. § 17:46B-45(a); see also N.J. Builders Ass'n v. Sheeran, 168 N.J. Super. 237, 402 A.2d 
956, 961 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1979) (noting that N.J. Stat. Ann. § 17:46B-45 evidently requires the DOBI Commissioner to 
conduct ""some degree"" of fact-finding). "
594,3," It is well established that the filed rate doctrine can serve as a defense  [**22] against both federal and state actions. See, e.g., 
Am. Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Cent. Office Tel., Inc., 524 U.S. 214, 228, 118 S. Ct. 1956, 141 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1998) (holding that the 
""respondent's state-law claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine"")."
594,4," Appellants also argue that ""the filed rate doctrine has been the subject of sustained criticism by the [New Jersey] courts and 
has never been applied to the New Jersey title insurance regulatory regime."" Appellants' Br. at 40. However, as the District Court 
correctly noted, New Jersey courts have recently affirmed the vitality of the filed rate doctrine. See, e.g., Richardson, 853 A.2d at 
963 (""[T]he doctrine maintains a substantial role in administrative ratemaking . . . ."")."
594,5," Appellants sought, inter alia, a ""final injunction . . . enjoining Defendants  [**26] from engaging in collective rate setting with 
regard to all future title insurance rate filings with the Department of Insurance."" App. at 86."
594,6," As the District Court recognized, the filed rate doctrine does not bar injunctive relief claims against future rates. See Square D. 
Co., 476 U.S. at 422 & n.28 (noting that the filed rate doctrine specifically precludes antitrust claims for treble damages). "
595,8," Because Appellants lack standing to pursue their claims, we will not reach their arguments that the District Court erred by 
concluding that Appellants' injunctive relief claims are barred by the McCarran-Ferguson Act and N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:9-5(b)(4) 
antitrust liability exemptions. "
596,9," Although the District Court dismissed Appellants' complaint with prejudice because ""the McCarran-Ferguson Act and N.J. Stat. 
Ann. § 56:9-5(b)(4) bar [Appellants'] federal and state antitrust claims,"" In re N.J. Title Ins. Litig., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67273, 
2010 WL 2710570, at *12, we may affirm the District Court's decision on different grounds. See Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. 
Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 904 n.1 (3d Cir. 1997). "
598,*," Hon. Sandra Day O'Connor, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the Supreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation. "
599,1," This directive is set forth in Department of Insurance Forms and Rates Bulletin No. 5. Loss Cost Filing Requirements, Forms 
and Rates Bulletin No. 5 (Dep't of Ins. amended Nov. 27, 1995), http://delawareinsurance.gov/ departments/documents/ 
bulletins/formbull5.pdf [hereinafter Bulletin No.5]. The DOI Commissioner may issue orders, notices and bulletins regulating 
Delaware insurance practices. See Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, § 312(a)-(c)."
599,2," The exemption is set forth in Department of Insurance Forms and Rates Bulletin No. 27. Title Insurance Filing Requirements, 
Forms and Rates Bulletin No. 27 (Dep't of Ins. Sept. 2, 2010), http://delawareinsurance.gov/ departments/documents/bulletins/ 
formbull27.pdf [hereinafter Bulletin No. 27]."
599,3," Appellants also named Appellees' parent companies as defendants and asserted an unjust enrichment claim. The District Court 
dismissed that claim as well as the parent companies under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). See McCray v. Fidelity 
Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 636 F. Supp. 2d 322 (D. Del. 2009). Appellants do not pursue those claims on appeal."
599,4, Appellees allegedly account for about 98 percent of the title insurance premiums paid in Delaware. 
600,5," Appellants also argue that District Court erred by applying the filed rate doctrine to dismiss their injunctive relief claim. The 
District Court correctly observed that the filed rate doctrine precludes injunctive relief to the extent that such relief ""seeks to 
prevent the defendants from relying on the filed rate."" McCray, 636 F. Supp. 2d at 334; see Burlington N., Inc. v. United States, 
459 U.S. 131, 138-42, 103 S. Ct. 514, 74 L. Ed. 2d 311 (1982) (vacating an injunction that ordered a reduction in rates). 
Because Appellants did not clearly state the type of injunctive relief  [**9] they sought in their initial complaint and requested only 
that the ""unlawful conduct be enjoined,"" J.A. at 65, the District Court properly dismissed the claim and granted Appellants leave 
to clarify their demand for relief. "
602,6," Appellants argue that interpreting the filed rate doctrine as lacking a ""meaningful review"" requirement would eradicate the state 
action doctrine. Under the state action doctrine, private entities participating in state-administered price regulation can assert 
antitrust immunity if, inter alia, ""the State provides active supervision of anticompetitive conduct  [**18] undertaken by private 
actors."" FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., 504 U.S. 621, 631, 112 S. Ct. 2169, 119 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1992). Therefore, ""[t]he mere 
potential for state supervision"" is not sufficient to invoke the state action doctrine. Id. at 638. However, there is no apparent 
requirement to reconcile the filed rate and state action doctrines, as courts have generally applied them independently. See, 
e.g., Trigen-Okla. City Energy Corp. v. Okla. Gas & Elec. Co., 244 F.3d 1220, 1224-25 (10th Cir. 2001) (dismissing claims under 
state action doctrine and as a result declining to reach filed rate doctrine); City of Kirkwood v. Union Elec. Co., 671 F.2d 1173, 
1182 (8th Cir. 1982) (independently analyzing the filed rate doctrine and the state action doctrine). Moreover, the doctrines do 
not completely overlap because the filed rate doctrine, unlike the state action doctrine, does not provide complete immunity from 
antitrust liability. See Essential Commc'ns, 610 F.2d at 1121."
602,7," Appellants suggest that the DOI could not genuinely review the challenged rates because DTIRB did not provide sufficient data 
to support its filings. However, Appellants do not provide any authority showing that the filed rate doctrine is dependent on the 
thoroughness of an agency's fact-finding. See Goldwasser v. Ameritech Corp., 222 F.3d 390, 402 (7th Cir. 2000) (rejecting the 
argument that the doctrine should not apply where agencies ""rarely exercise their muscle and thus give  [**20] no meaningful 
review to the rate structure""). Additionally, since filing its rates in 2004, DTIRB has provided a statistical plan that enables the 
DOI to monitor the bureau's rate adequacy. "
603,8," Indeed, Appellants concede that ""cases have noted that the availability of an alternative regulatory remedy is not a 
'prerequisite' for application of  [**21] the filed rate doctrine."" Appellants' Br. at 28 n.9 (citing Wegoland, Ltd. v. NYNEX Corp., 
806 F. Supp. 1112 (S.D.N.Y. 1992)). And in any event, Delaware allows interested parties to challenge insurance rates by 
making written application to the Commissioner for an administrative hearing. The Commissioner will determine if a hearing is 
justified, after which the Commissioner may deem the filings ""no longer effective."" Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, § 2520(a)-(c). At oral 
argument, counsel for Appellants conceded that they did not administratively challenge DTIRB's rates."
603,9," Appellees also argue that the DOI's supporting data requirement governs ""filings by rating bureaus for lines of insurance other 
than title insurance."" Appellees' Br. at 7 n.3. However, nothing in Bulletin No. 5 indicates that the regulation is limited  [**24] to 
certain types of insurance. See Bulletin No. 5 (stating that the bulletin applies generally to ""participating insurers""). "
604,10," At oral argument, counsel for Appellant argued that Appellees' rate filings are invalid because the Appellees jointly formulated 
the proposed rates even though Bulletin No. 5 required each insurer to ""individually determine and file the rates it will use as a 
result of its own independent company decision-making process."" Bulletin No. 5. However, Bulletin No. 27 ""allow[ed] an 
exception to the requirements of using the rating format (loss cost) prescribed in Bulletin No. 5,"" which necessarily included the 
directive to individually determine and file rates. Bulletin No. 27. Indeed, the DOI issued Bulletin No. 5 in order to ""specif[y] the 
framework under which . . . insurers . . . will operate in a loss cost system.""  [**26] Bulletin No. 5. Because that system was 
temporarily lifted in Bulletin No. 27, Appellants cannot rely on its requirements to insist that Appellants' rate filings are improper. 
In addition, title 18, section 2501 of the Delaware Code states that, among other things, ""[t]he purpose of this chapter is to . . . 
authorize and regulate cooperative action among insurers in rate making."""
604,11," Appellants also argue that the Kmart improper filing exception applies because: (1) the DITRB's filings include hidden costs 
based on ""kickbacks and other inducements unrelated to the business of insurance,"" Appellants' Br. at 32 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted); and (2) the Tenth Circuit addressed a similar situation in TON Services, Inc. v. Qwest Corp., 493 
F.3d 1225 (10th Cir. 2007), and refused to apply the filed rate doctrine, see Appellants' Br. at 33. These arguments are 
meritless. With regard to Appellants' ""hidden costs"" argument, it is well established that ""there is no fraud exception to the filed 
rate doctrine."" AT & T Corp. v. JMC Telecom, LLC, 470 F.3d 525, 535 (3d Cir. 2006). Thus, the fact that Appellees allegedly hid 
expenses and engaged in other fraudulent conduct does not  [**27] make the doctrine inapplicable. Furthermore, Appellants' 
second argument is unpersuasive both because TON Services is non-binding authority and because the insurers in that case, 
unlike Appellees, failed to file new rates and failed to file supporting data for existing rates absent legal permission from the 
regulating agency. See 493 F.3d at 1237. "
605,12," The filed rate doctrine does not bar injunctive relief claims with respect to future rates. See Square D, 476 U.S. at 422 & n.28 
(noting that the filed rate doctrine precludes antitrust claims for treble damages); Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, 
Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application ¶ 247d (3d ed. 2006) (""[T]here is no reason to think 
Keogh would prohibit an injunction against an antitrust violation attending some tariff that would or might be filed in the future. 
Such a tariff has not been 'filed' at all.""). However, the McCarran-Ferguson Act exempts conduct from antitrust liability if it: (1) 
constitutes ""the business of insurance,"" (2) is ""regulated pursuant to state law,"" and (3) does not ""constitute acts of boycott, 
coercion or intimidation."" Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. FTC, 998 F.2d 1129, 1133 (3d Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted)."
605,13," Although Appellees  [**32] do not address standing, ""we are required to raise issues of standing sua sponte if such issues 
exist."" Steele v. Blackman, 236 F.3d 130, 134 n.4 (3d Cir. 2001) (citing FOCUS v. Allegheny Cnty. Court of Common Pleas, 75 
F.3d 834, 838 (3d Cir. 1996)). "
606,14," When reviewing a complaint for standing, we determine ""whether the allegations on the face of the complaint, taken as true, 
allege facts sufficient to invoke the [court's] jurisdiction."" Reilly, 664 F.3d at 41 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)."
606,15," DTIRB's current rates do not constitute a legal injury under the filed rate doctrine. Keogh, 260 U.S. at 163 (stating that 
""[u]nless and until suspended or set aside, th[e filed] rate is made, for all purposes, the legal rate""); see also Wegoland, 27 F.3d 
at 18 (""[T]he doctrine holds that any 'filed rate' . . . is per se reasonable and unassailable in judicial proceedings brought by 
ratepayers.""). Thus, Appellants must establish standing based on the possibility of future unfair rates. "
607,*," This opinion has been circulated among all judges of this court in regular active service pursuant to Circuit Rule 40(e). No judge 
requested to hear this case en banc. "
614,**," The Honorable Edmond E. Chang, Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by 
designation."
614,1," On February 17, 2012, a new NCAA regulation permitting multi-year scholarships became final. See Steve Wieberg, Multiyear 
Scholarship  [**3] Rule Narrowly Survives Override Vote, USA TODAY (Feb. 17, 2012, 7:00 p.m.), http://www.usatoday.com/ 
sports/college/story/2012-02-17/multiyear-scholarships-survives-close-vote/53137194/1. Since plaintiffs seek damages for prior 
actions taken by the NCAA and its member schools, the repeal of the multi-year scholarship prohibition does not render this 
case nonjusticiable. "
615,2," Agnew originally filed the lawsuit as a class action, but had not filed a motion to certify a class at the time of the dismissal of the 
claims at issue. Thus, when plaintiffs' claims were dismissed, the entire lawsuit was dismissed, since there were no other parties 
with legally protected interests in the litigation. See Wiesmueller v. Kosobucki, 513 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir. 2008). "
618,3," Aside from the fact that the plaintiffs misunderstand the need for the existence  [**19] of a relevant market, it is unclear why 
they would adamantly seek to avoid the topic of market power. This appears to be a clear monopsony case, since the NCAA is 
the only purchaser of student athletic labor. In any event, HN11[
] a showing of market power is not necessary in a case 
involving clear restrictions on price and output unless and until a full Rule of Reason analysis takes place. See Bd. of Regents, 
468 U.S. at 109-10. "
619,4," Of course, plaintiffs must show more than this to actually progress past the motion-to-dismiss stage. As stated supra, a 
successful Sherman Act plaintiff must prove the existence of ""(1) a contract, combination, or conspiracy; (2) a resultant 
unreasonable restraint of trade in the relevant market; and (3) an accompanying injury."" Denny's Marina, 8 F.3d at 1220. It is 
unquestionable that the member schools of the NCAA agreed to  [**20] follow the NCAA's Bylaws, thus meeting the first element 
of a Sherman Act claim. Since the district court concluded that plaintiffs did not identify a relevant market in their complaint, it did 
not address whether plaintiffs adequately alleged that the Bylaws are an unreasonable restraint of trade or that they suffered an 
accompanying injury. Likewise, we need not analyze plaintiffs' assertions regarding the reasonableness of the NCAA's restraints 
or plaintiffs' alleged injury, since we ultimately conclude that plaintiffs failed to allege a relevant market in their complaint. "
621,5," To illustrate, Forbes reported that the University of Texas' college football team was worth $129 million in 2011 and generated 
$71 million in profits. Chris Smith, College Football's Most Valuable Teams, FORBES (Dec. 22, 2011, 11:43 a.m.), 
http://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissmith/2011/12/22/college-footballs-most-valuable-teams/. "
622,6," We need not touch upon the debate of whether all eligibility rules or just most eligibility rules are due a presumption, as the 
Bylaws at issue in this case are not, in fact, eligibility rules. "
623,7," One should not mistake the analysis we discuss here as requiring proof of the procompetitive nature of the NCAA's ""no 
payment"" rules on a case-by-case basis. This analysis involves a determination of whether a rule is, on its face, supportive of the 
""no payment"" and ""student-athlete"" models, not whether ""no payment"" rules are themselves procompetitive—under Board of 
Regents, they clearly are. "
625,8," Again, this does not necessarily mean that any challenge  [**48] of any NCAA bylaw will survive the motion-to-dismiss stage. 
Many NCAA bylaws can be deemed procompetitive ""in the twinkling of an eye."" Cf. Bd. of Regents, 468 U.S. at 109 n.39 
(quoting P. Areeda, The ""Rule of Reason"" in Antitrust Analysis: General Issues 37-38 (Federal Judicial Center, June 1981)). "
631,1," Under Rule 120 in 2007, Amos had 75 days (until May 14, 2007) in which to redeem. She claimed that she sent an intent-to-
redeem letter to the public trustee before the redemption deadline. The public trustee, however, never received the letter. On 
May 8, six days prior to the redemption deadline, Amos' attorney notified the public trustee of Amos' intent to redeem. And, on 
May 14, Amos wired the necessary funds to the public trustee. Aspen Alps, however, exercised  [***5] its statutory right to veto 
the redemption and directed the public trustee to deny Amos' attempt to redeem."
631,2," Aspen Alps asserted counterclaims, including, for declaratory judgment that Aspen Alps properly purchased the property at the 
foreclosure sale and that it held free and marketable title, and to quiet title in the property. "
632,3, We granted review on the following issues:
632,1," . When bidders at a public foreclosure sale conspired to rig the bidding in violation of the Colorado Antitrust Act and the 
resulting deed is void, may the court nevertheless award the foreclosed property to one of the conspirators rather than void 
the sale?"
632,2," . Whether a foreclosing bank's material failure to comply with C.R.C.P. 120's requirements to identify and give notice to all 
interested parties voids the resulting foreclosure sale. "
633,4, Equitable Bank does not claim to have mailed notice to the Estate or to Brandy Righetti.

provisions, ""even if doing so produces anomalous results.""). "
634,6," The petitioners challenge the trial court's finding that the Estate and Brandy Righetti were not entitled to notice under Rule 120. 
Even assuming that C.R.C.P. 120 required Equitable Bank to provide notice to the Estate or to Brandy Righetti as co-personal 
representative of the Estate, we would reach the same result because the Estate received constructive notice through the actual 
notice provided to Amos. Thus, the same lack of prejudice analysis would apply."
634,7," The parties disagree about whether the issue of bid rigging is before the Court, or whether we are confined to the issue on 
which we granted certiorari review: whether, when bidders at a public foreclosure sale conspired to rig the bidding in violation of 
the Colorado Antitrust Act and the resulting deed is void, the foreclosed property may be awarded to one of the conspirators 
rather than void the sale. This Court has the authority to review issues encompassed within the certiorari issue. C.A.R. 53(a)(1) 
(""The statement of an issue presented will be deemed to include every subsidiary issue clearly comprised therein.""). 
 [***17] Here, the issue of whether bid rigging occurred must be resolved to reach the issue on certiorari. "
635,8," HN6[
] The statute provides a civil private right of action for violation of the Act in section 6-4-114: ""Any person injured in its . . . property by reason of any violation of this article may sue therefor and, if successful, shall recover any actual damages 
sustained by such person."""
635,9," Section 6-4-121 provides: HN7[
] All contracts or agreements made by any person while a member of any combination, [or] conspiracy . . . 
prohibited under this article which are founded upon, or are the result of, or grow out of, or are connected with any violation 
of this article, either directly or indirectly, shall be void, and no recovery thereon or benefit therefrom shall be had by or for 
any such person. . . . "
637,10, The trial court admitted the statements under the CRE 801(d)(2)(E) hearsay exception. 
638,11," The creditor bank, Equitable Bank, submitted an initial bid in the amount of its debt, which was then outmatched by the 
remaining bidders."
638,12," I agree with the majority that, under section 6-4-119, C.R.S. (2011), we must interpret section 6-4-106(1)'s prohibition on bid 
rigging consistent with federal antitrust law. Maj. op. at ¶ 27. "
641,13," To the extent the majority's ""see"" cite to the ""Personal Service"" provisions  [***40] of C.R.C.P. 4 is intended to imply that a 
personal representative is a designated agent of her estate for purposes of service of process, I consider that suggestion not 
only mistaken but also irrelevant. As a general matter, the manner of presenting claims against an estate is prescribed at section 
15-12-804, C.R.S. (2011), but proceedings to enforce a mortgage or other lien against property of an estate are expressly 
exempted from this provision and are governed instead by C.R.C.P. 120, which contains service requirements of its own, 
separate and distinct from those of Rule 4. In any event, Rule 4(e)(4) delineates persons upon whom delivery of process naming 
a particular entity will be considered adequate, not persons from whom notice of an ongoing proceeding will be imputed to that 
entity, regardless of adequate service. In this case, it is undisputed that neither the estate itself nor anyone in the capacity of 
personal representative for the estate was ever even named in the motion for a foreclosure sale, much less served with notice of 
the sale. "
645,1," AFL, IBEW, and Painters are all TPPs that underwrite prescription drugs costs for their plan members, i.e. insured consumers. 
They will be referred to collectively in this opinion as ""named plaintiff TPPs."""
645,2," Jurisdiction over this action is proper under the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which grants federal district courts original 
jurisdiction over ""any civil action in which the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000, exclusive of 
interests and costs, and is a class action in which . . . any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any 
defendant."" 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2); see Kaufman v. Allstate N.J. Ins. Co., 561 F.3d 144, 148 (3d Cir. 2009)."
645,3, The facts are stated based on evidence offered to support Indirect Purchasers' Fourth Amended Complaint.
645,4," To establish  [**9] bioequivalence, the generic version must contain the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, route of 
administration, and strength. "
646,5," In 2007, after the citizen petitions at issue in this case were filed, Congress passed a law allowing the FDA to summarily 
dismiss citizen petitions, in order to prevent pharmaceutical companies from using this process to delay generic entry into the 
market. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(q)(1)(A)(ii)."
646,6," Indirect Purchasers also  [**12] allege that consumers and TPPs were forced to pay and/or reimburse for Flonase at a 
supracompetitive price as a result of GSK's conduct. However, for reasons discussed infra, I will exclude the proposed class 
members proceeding under this ""branded overcharge"" theory. "
647,7," As a result of this ruling, named plaintiff International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Ironworkers 
Local No. 79 Health Fund (""IABORI "") was dismissed from this action. "
648,8," Indirect Purchasers' fourth amended class action complaint includes claims under North Carolina's monopolization statute, N.C. 
Gen. Stat. § 75-2.1, et seq., and North Carolina's UDTP statute, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1, et seq. I have already found that none 
of the named plaintiffs in this case can establish standing to bring an action under these North Carolina statutes. For the reasons 
outlined infra, I do not find that Indirect Purchasers can seek certification of a class pursuant to the monopolization and UDTP 
statutes of North Carolina. Additionally, Indirect Purchasers' fourth amended class action complaint includes a claim under Arizona's UDTP statute, Ariz. 
Rev. Stat. § 44-1522, et seq. However, I previously granted GSK's motion for  [**18] summary judgment as to Indirect 
Purchasers' Arizona UDTP claim because Indirect Purchasers had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether 
GSK engaged in deception, as required by the Arizona statute. In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 815 F. Supp. 2d. 867, 885-86 (E.D. 
Pa. 2011); see also Kuehn v. Stanley, 208 Ariz. 124, 91 P.3d 346, 351 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2004). At this stage in the litigation, with 
discovery already closed and without any evidence raising a genuine issue as to whether GSK engaged in deception, I do not 
find that Indirect Purchasers can now seek certification of a class pursuant to Arizona's UDTP statute."
648,9," The remaining state law claims have been outlined in ""Appendix A"" at the end of this opinion. The statutes at issue are often 
labeled ""Illinois Brick repealers"" in light of the Supreme Court's decision prohibiting federal antitrust suits by indirect purchasers. 
Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 728, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). Numerous states across the country have 
subsequently passed ""Illinois Brick repealers"" enabling an indirect purchaser to bring an antitrust claim under state law. 
Furthermore, in those states with a repealer statute, indirect purchasers are not barred from  [**19] recovery for unjust 
enrichment damages. My previous opinions have detailed ""Illinois Brick repealers"" and the similar theories underlying each of Indirect Purchasers' 
remaining state law claims. See In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 815 F. Supp. 2d. 867, 882-85 (E.D. Pa. 2011); In re Flonase 
Antitrust Litig., 692 F. Supp. 2d 524, 534 (E.D. Pa. 2010); In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 610 F. Supp. 2d 409, 413 (E.D. Pa. 
2009)."
648,10," Indirect Purchasers first moved for class certification on December 12, 2008. Since that time, I have twice denied Indirect 
Purchasers' motion for class certification without prejudice to re-brief the issue in light of opinions by the Third Circuit, first in In 
re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litigation, 552 F.3d 305 (3d Cir. 2008),  [**20] then in Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., 667 F.3d 
273 (3d Cir. 2011). In December 2011, Indirect Purchasers re-filed their previous two motions for class certification and 
accompanying memoranda and expert declarations, along with new supplemental memoranda. GSK responded to Indirect 
Purchasers' motion in the same fashion. All of the re-filed motions, memoranda, and declarations that have been filed since 
December 2011 have been taken into consideration. "
653,11," I recognize that the elements of the remaining state unjust enrichment claims are not exactly the same as those of the 
monopolization and UDTP state statutes. In general, to state a claim for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must show that the 
defendant received a benefit from the plaintiff, that the defendant accepted and retained the benefit conferred, and that it would 
be inequitable for the defendant to retain that benefit without paying. See Powers v. Lycoming Engines, 245 F.R.D. 226, 231 
(E.D. Pa. 2007); Undoing the Otherwise  [**37] Perfect Crime—Applying Unjust Enrichment to Consumer Price-Fixing Claims, 
Daniel R. Karon, 108 W. Va. L. Rev. 395, 409 (2005). Indirect Purchasers have successfully plead, and survived summary 
judgment on, unjust enrichment claims under the laws of Arizona, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin. While there are minor 
variations amongst these claims, see App. A, I do not find, nor does GSK assert, that the variation among the remaining state 
unjust enrichment laws is material to this decision on certification. To prove their unjust enrichment claims, all class members will rely on common evidence focused on whether: (1) GSK's 
conduct delayed generic competition; (2) the delay of generic entry enriched GSK as a result of overcharges and monopoly 
profits in the Flonase market from August 2004 to March 2006; (3) this additional enrichment came at the expense of the class; 
and (4) whether, as a matter of equity, the retention of this benefit would be unjust. ""As is the nature of unjust enrichment claims, 
this common evidence will focus on the defendant's gain and not on the plaintiff's loss."" Terazosin, 220 F.R.D. at 698. "
654,," The class proceeding under unjust enrichment claims will only be limited to  [**38] the extent that (1) ""generic only"" class 
members (March 2006—March 2009 generic FP purchasers only) and (2) class members who only purchased and/or 
reimbursed for FP in the state of Florida cannot recover damages based on a theory of unjust enrichment. See In re Flonase 
Antitrust Litig., 692 F. Supp. 2d 524, 544 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (dismissing Indirect Purchasers' unjust enrichment claim under Florida 
law because Florida requires that a plaintiff confer a direct benefit upon a defendant in order to state a claim for unjust 
enrichment)."
654,12," Rausser's opinions can be found in three separate expert declarations (January 2010, May 2010, and October 2010 
Declarations), two depositions (March 2010, January 2012), and his testimony at Indirect Purchasers' class certification hearing 
on February 27-29, 2012. "
655,13," Stangle's opinions can be found in three expert declarations (April 2010, June 2010, February 2012) and one deposition (May 
2010). Navarro issued one expert declaration in April 2010 and was deposed in May 2010. Both Stangle and Navarro testified 
during the class certification hearings on February 27-29, 2012. "
656,14," Indirect Purchasers repeatedly emphasize that this evidence of general economic principles and actual market data is the 
same evidence that a group of direct purchasers relied on in seeking certification in a related action, alleging injury through 
overcharges as a result of delayed generic entry into the market. See American Sales Co., Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham 
Corp., 274 F.R.D. 127 (E.D. Pa. 2010). Because in November 2010 I granted that motion for class certification, Indirect 
Purchasers claim that their proposed class should be certified. However, this motion for class certification presents certain 
issues and complexities that were absent in my certification of a direct purchaser class. For one, GSK neither contested that 
motion nor asserted a Daubert challenge against the direct purchaser plaintiffs' two certification experts. More importantly, 
though, the issues of antitrust impact and damages are different in the context of an indirect purchaser class, largely as a result 
of the cost and payment structure present in the pharmaceutical industry and the fact that the indirect purchaser class is much 
larger than  [**48] thirty member direct purchaser class. To the extent Indirect Purchasers assert that impact can be proven based solely on GSK's alleged exclusionary conduct, in 
accordance with the presumption of impact established in Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Co., 561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1977), I do not find 
such a presumption compatible with the record of this case. See In re OSB Antitrust Litig., No. 06-826, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
56617, 2007 WL 2253425, at *6-7 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 3, 2007) (noting that courts in the Third Circuit apply the Bogosian doctrine 
almost exclusively in direct, not indirect, purchaser actions, and explaining that even in direct purchaser actions ""the Third Circuit 
also requires proof of actual classwide economic injury - a 'belt and suspenders' approach to establishing impact.""). In addition, 
the continued existence of the Bogosian presumption appears uncertain within the Third Circuit. See Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 
F.3d at 326 (""We emphasize that actual, not presumed, conformance with the Rule 23 requirements is essential.""). Regardless, Indirect Purchasers do not rely exclusively on general economic principles and GSK's alleged anticompetitive 
conduct to demonstrate impact. As discussed infra, Rausser utilizes a yardstick  [**49] methodology and sensitivity analysis, 
relying on available industry nationwide and state-specific data, to show that impact to these class members is capable of proof 
through common evidence. "
658,15," In a similar delayed generic entry case, the presence of these consumers in a proposed class of consumers and TPPs was a 
critical reason behind the court's denial of class certification. See Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health & Welfare Plan v. 
GlaxoSmithKline, PLC, No. 04-5898, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105646, 2010 WL 3855552, at *26 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 2010). At the 
early stages of this litigation, Indirect Purchasers' proposed class included these consumers. Stangle and Navarro pointed out 
the existence of these uninjured parties in their initial expert declarations. Indirect Purchasers subsequently amended their class 
definition to exclude these consumers."
658,16," Rausser explained that rebates are offered by manufacturers of branded drugs to create incentives for moving volume. 
Rebates, of course, offset the net cost of a brand drug; therefore, they only make sense economically if the revenue decrease 
GSK experiences is more than outweighed by the volume increase that they are able to capture as a result. Because generic 
entry triggers a steady decrease in brand drug volume, drug manufacturers typically reduce the number of rebates offered after 
generic entry. This case was no different, as Rausser reviewed  [**56] internal GSK data demonstrating such a reduction in 
rebates after generic entry."
658,17," It must be noted that Rausser's analysis of TPPs does not include fully-insured TPPs, which have been excluded from the 
class because they do not bear the cost burden for an FP purchase. At the early stages of this litigation, Indirect Purchasers' 
proposed class included these TPPs—one named plaintiff, in fact, was a fully-insured TPP. Again, Stangle and Navarro "
659,," explained the presence and uninjured nature of these TPPs in their  [**57] initial declarations. Indirect Purchasers subsequently 
amended their class definition to exclude these TPPs. All of the remaining named plaintiff TPPs are self-insured plans."
659,18," Moreover, some of these plan provisions, though present in a particular TPP prescription drug program, are unlikely to effect 
this analysis because they are rarely triggered. For instance, Stangle admitted that it is unlikely that benefit maximums will ever 
affect an individual plan member. Named plaintiff Painters utilizes a participating pharmacy network, requiring its plan members 
to absorb more of a drug's cost if purchased outside that network. In reviewing all of Painters' actual claims data, Rausser noted 
that no prescriptions were filled in non-participating pharmacies during the Class Period. "
660,19," Stangle challenged the sufficiency of Rausser's sensitivity analysis by claiming that it only accounted for a two-tier drug 
formulary. However, Rausser explained that by using such an extreme value ($40 differential in consumer contribution between 
brand and generic drugs), his sensitivity analysis encompassed more than a two-tier prescription drug plan. "
661,20," Rausser does not argue with the notion that he uses an average price. As he explained: ""It's a price that's used throughout the 
pharmaceutical industry. I look at the total dollars, I look at the extended units, and I've got a price for which those extended 
units moved through the market. It is an average price, there is no question about that."" (H'rg Tr. 33.)"
661,21," Rausser pointed out a third mistake in Stangle's analysis: the inclusion of a transaction that fell outside the Class Period. While 
correcting for this mistake also changed the calculation such that AFL was injured in Florida, this mistake/correction does not 
carry the same weight as the other two corrections noted above in attempting to ascertain whether Rausser's methodology is 
capable of establishing impact to this  [**67] class."
661,22," GSK and Stangle repeatedly note the significant variation between the actual generic prices paid in a given state and 
Rausser's ""but-for"" generic price. For example, they noted that although Rausser's ""but-for"" generic price never exceeds 
$50/bottle, named plaintiff Painters reimbursed for generic FP purchases in 2006 at prices as high as $63.97/bottle. Therefore, 
GSK appears to argue that the ""but-for"" prices in 2004 should match up more closely with the actual prices paid in the class 
states in 2006. However, this contention again fails to recognize that earlier generic entry in 2004 would allow for a lower generic 
entry price than in 2006."
661,23," The ten states are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Mexico, Tennessee, and Wisconsin."
661,24," The rest of the price variation, as Rausser explained, existed because Stangle included prices from the mail-order distribution 
channel, all of which were found in named plaintiff Painters' internal data. Rausser demonstrated that these prices also exhibited 
little price variation. Furthermore, although the prices in the mail-order channel do not exactly parallel those seen in the retail 
channel, Rausser analyzed each of the distribution channels for FP and found that consumers of FP were injured by GSK's 
exclusionary conduct. Unlike Rausser's average brand price for Flonase after generic entry, discussed infra, I do not find that 
Rausser's average  [**69] generic price is masking the absence of injury for class members purchasing FP in certain distribution 
channels. "
662,25," GSK cites to Reed, in particular, where plaintiffs relied on Rausser's expert testimony, and the court did not find that he had 
applied his econometric principles and methods reliably to the particular facts of that case. Yet this case and Reed are simply 
inapposite. Reed involved allegations of wage-suppression by a class of hospital-based registered nurses. The court noted that 
numerous factors could affect the wages of an individual nurse—age, nurse performance and merit, sign-on or retention 
bonuses, and non-wage compensation (i.e. employee benefits, overtime). Defendants presented evidence that, because of 
these various factors, the wages paid varied greatly and, more importantly, certain nurses actually received pay increases during 
the class period. Although Dr. Rausser's methodology failed to control for all the relevant factors in Reed, I find Rausser's 
methodology to be sufficient for the facts of this case."
662,26," In Weiss v. AstraZeneca, No. BC323107 (Ca. Sup. Ct. 2008), Rausser criticized the usefulness of similar aggregated data 
from third-party vendors to establish impact and class-wide damages to a class of uninsured consumers, insured consumers, 
and third-party payors. Much of the testimony, admittedly, appears contradictory to that set forth by Rausser in the instant case. 
Rausser explained that Weiss required a different analysis because the class was alleging that a drug manufacturer issued "
663,," misleading advertisements concerning the effectiveness of one drug compared to another drug with a chemically different 
makeup, different dosage requirements, and a relatively similar price. On the other hand, this case concerns allegations of 
foreclosed generic competition, involving two bioequivalent substitutable drugs with vastly different prices. I am satisfied that the 
market dynamics of the two cases are sufficiently different so as not to undermine Rausser's testimony in this case. "
664,27," Both Stangle and Rausser agreed that approximately 21.5% of insured consumers fit this purchasing pattern. Neither expert 
offered an estimate as to how many uninsured consumers only purchased Flonase before generic entry and made no purchases 
after generic entry."
664,28," Navarro and Stangle noted that it is quite possible that TPPs may have only reimbursed for Flonase purchases during the 
Class Period; for example, a TPP may have shut down in the period between May 2004 and May 2006, or it may only have a "
665,," few reimbursements in a class state during the Class Period, all concentrated between May 2004 and May 2006, because it is 
an out-of-state TPP. "
666,29," Rausser also explained that common data was available to enable him to ""back out"" of his damages calculation transactions 
by consumers purchasing only Flonase during the Class Period."
666,30," Both Rule 23(c)(1)(C), which allows for the amendment of class certification orders at any time before final judgment, and Rule 
23(d),  [**87] which authorizes courts to make appropriate orders to facilitate class action proceedings, provide adequate 
methods through which I can address any potential difficulties associated with damage allocations as they may arise. "
679,1," The Court is aware of the ""quick look,"" or abbreviated  [*21] rule of reason analysis discussed in Major League Baseball 
Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 F.3d 290, 317-18 (2d Cir. 2008). However, neither party invokes that analysis, and rightly 
so, as it is not applicable to the facts of this case. I therefore discuss it no further. "
692,1," In their respondents' brief, the Hyneks assert that this appeal is premature because it is taken from the court's order sustaining 
defendants' demurrers, not the final judgment in this matter. However, as is pointed out by the Wilsons in their reply brief, the 
clerk of this court notified the parties by a letter dated June 29, 2010, that we would consider the appeal as being from the 
judgment or dismissal order. "
693,2," Polo Fund and the Coast Defendants also assert that the Wilsons' section 17200 claim is barred by the statute of limitations. 
However, as we have concluded that the section 17200 claim fails to state a cause of action as a matter of law, we need not 
address this alternative contention. "

2010 (respectively, ""Oct. 6 Tr.""; ""Oct. 7 Tr.""), and the binders of materials, consisting of demonstratives, exhibits, and deposition 
excerpts, submitted by the parties at the hearing: the plaintiffs' binder regarding section 10706 (""Pls. Section 10706 Binder""); the 
plaintiffs' hearing binder (""Pls. Hr'g Binder""); the defendants' hearing binder (""Defs. Hr'g Binder""); the defendants' proffer at 
hearing on class certification binder (""Defs. Proffer Binder""); and the plaintiffs' closing arguments binder (""Pls. Closing Binder""). "
717,2," On January 13, 2009, in view of the huge volume of documents to be produced in discovery and other discovery issues, many 
of which involved challenging e-discovery matters, the Court referred this case for the management of all pretrial matters, 
discovery, and scheduling jointly to Magistrate Judge John M. Facciola and Magistrate Judge Alan Kay. See Referral Order at 2, 
Jan. 13, 2009 [Dkt. No. 179]. Magistrate Judge Facciola and Magistrate Judge Kay have provided the Court and the parties with 
invaluable assistance, presiding over a lengthy discovery process, lasting over two years, in which the parties have raised 
complex legal issues and have exchanged millions of pages of documents. See In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 
MDL No. 1869, 281 F.R.D. 1, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132720, 2011 WL 5603995, at *1 (D.D.C. Nov. 17, 2011) (Facciola, Mag. 
J.). Magistrate Judge Facciola's expertise in e-discovery matters and his weekly conference calls with counsel during the early 
stages of discovery made possible an efficient and largely non-contentious discovery process despite the complexity  [**24] of 
the case and the challenging nature of some of the discovery issues. "
718,3," To preview, see infra at 61 n.11 & 64 n.12, Gordon Rausser is plaintiffs' retained expert, and Robert D. Willig is defendants' 
retained expert. Dr. Rausser is the Robert Gordon Sproul Distinguished Professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He 
has held positions teaching economics and statistics at numerous universities and has published widely in these fields. See 1st 
Rausser Report at 1. Dr. Willig is a Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, where he holds a joint 
appointment in the Economics Department and at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. His 
 [**27] focus is microeconomics, specializing in industrial organization. He has published widely in these fields. See Willig Report 
at 1. "
721,4," HN4[
] In addition to the four express requirements of Rule 23(a), there are two implied requirements: (1) the class must be ""sufficiently defined so as to be identifiable as a class""; and (2) the named representatives must ""fall within the class."" Vigus v. 
Southern Ill. Riverboat/Casino Cruises, Inc., 274 F.R.D. 229, 235 (S.D. Ill. 2011) (citing Oshana v. Coca-Cola Co., 472 F.3d 506, 
513 (7th Cir. 2006); Alliance to End Repression v. Rochford, 565 F.2d 975, 977 (7th Cir. 1977)). "
728,5," In their supplemental briefing, plaintiffs  [**68] state that they do not object to the Court applying the preponderance of the 
evidence standard because they believe they can readily satisfy it; nevertheless, plaintiffs note that they ""are not agreeing that a 
preponderance standard should apply."" Pls. Supp. Brief at 3 n.5. "
730,6," Defendants use the terms ""feasible"" and ""viable"" in evaluating the issue of common impact. See Willig Report ¶ 11 (stating that 
defendants asked Dr. Willig to determine ""whether it is feasible for plaintiffs to demonstrate through common proof that members 
of the proposed class suffered economic injury"") (emphasis added); Defs. Wal-Mart Reply Brief at 1 (stating that the central 
question before the Court is whether plaintiffs have proffered ""a viable classwide method for proving injury at trial"") (emphasis 
 [**74] added). "
731,7," To be clear on terms, as discussed below, such an exact offset between a fuel surcharge and a base rate would mean that an 
individual plaintiff has no claim for damages, but not necessarily that that plaintiff was not injured by the defendants' alleged 
conspiracy. See, e.g., In re EPDM Antitrust Litig., 256 F.R.D. at 88 (""[I]t is possible for a plaintiff to suffer antitrust injury-in-fact 
and yet have no damages because it has taken steps to mitigate the actual price paid through rebates, discounts, and other non-
price factors . . . . By expending resources to negotiate down from the supracomeptitive prices established by the cartel, plaintiffs 
who have suffered no damages  [**79] may still have suffered an injury-in-fact from the antitrust conspiracy. The fact that a 
plaintiff may have successfully employed bargaining power to fend off the effect of the conspiratorial practices does not mean 
that it has not been put in a worse position but-for the conspiracy."") (emphasis in original); see infra at 115-16. "
732,8," The findings set forth in this Opinion are made ""only for purposes of class certification and [are] not binding on the trier of facts"" 
on the merits at trial. In re Initial Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d at 41; see In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 
at 318 (HN21[
] a court's findings ""for the purpose of class certification are conclusive on that topic,"" but ""do not bind the fact-
finder on the merits""); see also Behrend v. Comcast Corp., 655 F.3d at 190. These findings therefore ""'may be revised (or wholly 
rejected) by the ultimate factfinder[.]'"" In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d at 318 n.19 (quoting Unger v. Amedisys 
Inc., 401 F.3d 316, 323 (5th Cir. 2005))."
732,9," During the class certification motions hearing, the Court noted that the class definition proposed by plaintiffs in their motion 
papers is different from the class definition proposed by plaintiffs in their  [**84] second consolidated amended complaint. See 
Oct. 7 Tr. at 331. Compare Class Mot. at 1, with 2d Am. Compl. ¶ 38. In view of some case law suggesting that a district court 
may be bound by the class definition set forth in a complaint, see Berlowitz v. Nob Hill Masonic Mgmt., Inc., Civil Action No. 96-
1241, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22599, 1996 WL 724776, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 6, 1996); see also Brewer v. Salyer, Civil Action No. "
733,06," -1324, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61285, 2009 WL 2019923, at *3 (E.D. Cal. July 8, 2009), the Court directed two questions to the 
parties at the motions hearing: (1) How do the plaintiffs want the class defined?; and (2) Is there some obligation on the plaintiffs 
to move to amend their amended complaint to match the definition set forth in the class certification motion? See Oct. 7 Tr. at 
331. In response to the Court's two questions, the parties filed a joint submission regarding the class definition in which they agreed 
that a formal amendment to plaintiffs' complaint was ""not necessary"" and that the Court ""may decide plaintiffs' motion for class 
certification based on the proposed class definition in the motion, and on the record before it."" Joint Class Definition Submission 
at 1. In accordance with the parties' joint submission,  [**85] the Court has decided plaintiffs' motion for class certification based 
on the proposed class definition in their motion, not the definition in their second consolidated amended complaint. "
738,10," Under Rule 23(c)(1)(B) and (g), plaintiffs seek formal designation of Quinn Emanuel and Hausfeld as co-lead class 
 [**105] counsel. See Class Mot. at 2; Class Mem. at 62 n.219. Upon consideration of the matters set forth in Rule 23(g), the 
Court will grant plaintiffs' request and will designate these two firms as co-lead class counsel. "
740,11," Dr. Rausser provides a detailed discussion of his qualifications and background in his expert report. See 1st Rausser Report 
at 1-2. In summary, Dr. Rausser is the Robert Gordon Sproul Distinguished Professor at the University of California at Berkeley 
and the former Dean of that University's College of Natural Resources. Class Mem. at 4 n.3. Dr.  [**115] Rausser's work focuses 
on the subjects of economics, applied economics, econometrics, and statistics. See id. He has published more than 250 articles, 
books, and book chapters, and has written more than 100 commissioned papers, governmental reports, and work papers. Id. Dr. 
Rausser served as the Chief Economist to the Agency for International Development in Washington, D.C. from 1988 to 1990, 
and as a Senior Economist at the President's Council of Economic Advisors from 1986 to 1987. Id. "
741,12," Dr. Willig provides a detailed description of his qualifications and  [**118] background in his expert report. See Willig Report ¶¶ 
1-6. In summary, Dr. Willig has been a Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University for over 30 years. 
Class Opp. at 6 n.2. He has written 75 articles on economics and a book on competition and the theory of industrial market 
structure. Id. His focus is on microeconomics, with particular specialization in industrial organization, and he teaches courses on 
microeconomics, regulation, antitrust, and competition policy. Id. Dr. Willig served as the Chief Economist in the Antitrust 
Division of the United States Department of Justice from 1989 to 1991. Id. He also has done research and economic analysis of 
the railroad industry, including testifying before the STB, and its predecessor, the ICC, about issues affecting the industry. Id. "
745,13," The Seventh Circuit's decision in Messner v. Northshore University HealthSystem suggests that defendants' argument 
regarding captive shippers and antitrust injury is more appropriately categorized as an argument that ""the class for which 
certification is requested is fatally overbroad because it contains members who could not have been harmed[.]"" Messner v. 
Northshore Univ. HealthSystem, 669 F.3d at 824. As the court in Messner explained: ""[I]f a proposed class consists largely (or 
entirely, for that matter) of members who are ultimately shown to have suffered no harm, that may not mean that the class was 
improperly certified but only that the class failed to meet its burden of proof on the merits. . . . If, however, a class is defined so 
broadly as to include a great number of members who  [**134] for some reason could not have been harmed by the defendant's 
allegedly unlawful conduct, the class is defined too broadly to permit certification."" Id. (emphasis added). As the Court has found, 
however, plaintiffs have shown by a preponderance of the evidence that railroads are affected by competitive constraints 
applying to both captive and non-captive shippers. Thus, the Court concludes that the class is not defined so broadly as to 
include a great number of members who ""could not have been harmed"" by defendants' allegedly unlawful conduct. Id. "
751,14," The 21 declarations submitted by defendants are listed below in alphabetical order: Declaration of Charles M. Adams, UP

751,15," There are two basic types of rail traffic: intermodal traffic; and carload traffic. See Class Opp. at 14 n.18; Oct. 7 Tr. at 207. As 
defendants define it, intermodal traffic ""proceeds both by rail and by some other mode."" Oct. 7 Tr. at 207; see Class Opp. at 14 
n.18. ""All other rail traffic is known as 'carload' traffic,"" Class Opp. at 14 n.18, which consists of, for example, ""a container that 
has chemicals in it or that has coal, or it's a designated kind of rail vessel designed to hold the specific kind of traffic."" Oct. 7 Tr. 
at 207-08. "
753,16," During the class certification hearing, defendants' counsel argued, seemingly for the first time, that ""[t]here was no change in 
the intermodal standard fuel surcharges of any consequence during the class period."" Oct. 7 Tr. at 208. After the hearing, 
defendants argued this point again in their supplemental briefing. See Defs. Wal-Mart Brief at 11. The Court is not persuaded by 
that argument. See 2d Rausser Report at 22-23; Pls. Wal-Mart Reply Brief at 14-15 & nn.33-34. "
754,17," As for use of the RCAF-A mechanism of recovery, BNSF price and fuel escalation guidelines stated: ""RCAF-A is absolutely 
unacceptable."" RD Ex. 223, BNSF Price and Fuel Escalation General Guidelines, at BNSF-0404221, Jan. 2004. "
755,18," As defendants explain, the term ""captive"" is used in two different ways: ""In some cases, it is applied to a shipper that is served 
by only one railroad although that shipper has viable transportation options available through trucks and/or barges. Other times, 
it is applied to a shipper that claims that it has no viable transport alternatives to the railroad that serves it."" Defs. Supp. Brief at 
18 n.10. "
759,19," Mr. Schaff, in his declaration, referenced the shipping customer [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] See Schaff Decl. ¶ 18. 
But Mr. Lawson, another NS vice president, admitted during his deposition that the Schaff declaration described only three 
contracts without providing any information on whether [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] HD Ex. 83, Lawson Dep. at 126. "
760,20," For another example of a company directive not to discount base rates in exchange for application of a fuel surcharge, see RD 
Ex. 91, BNSF Memorandum from S. Kyei, at BNSF-0325453, Mar. 28, 2008 (""CEO's Mandate for Marketing's Fuel Surcharge 
Programs"": ""Every price authority should have a fuel surcharge applied""; ""Marketing Team should not discount a fuel surcharge 
to raise price""). "
762,21," As discussed below, see infra at 138-39, Dr. Rausser also concludes that a common damage methodology works in this case. "
764,22," Defendants contend that one part of ""Characteristic 5"" references objectionable interline-related communications. See Defs. 
Interline Objections, Ex. C, at 80-81. Specifically, defendants say that Dr. Rausser improperly has relied on interline-related 
communications when he states that costs of implementing and maintaining the conspiracy would have been extremely low due 
to ""established mechanisms  [**207] for communicating and tracking prices[.]"" Id. (emphasis added). The Court has not relied on 
this part of Characteristic 5 in reaching in decision on plaintiffs' motion for class certification. "
765,23," Moreover, as Dr. Rausser points out, the existence of private price agreements in the rail freight industry does not distinguish 
the industry ""from many other industries, including some that have experienced price fixing despite the supposedly confidential 
nature of customer contracts."" 2d Rausser Report at 10 & n. 16 (citing peer-reviewed study concluding that ""cartels in industries 
with fuller reporting on prices are not statistically significantly higher than for cartels in other industries""). "
770,24," Both sides and their experts reference and rely on a 2009 study that was conducted by Laurits R. Christensen Associates, Inc. 
and commissioned by the STB to analyze competition, capacity, and service quality in the rail freight industry. See, e.g., Oct. 6 
Tr. at 140-41; Oct. 7 Tr. at 272-73; see generally HD Ex. 12, LAURITS R. CHRISTENSEN ASSOCIATES, INC., VOLUME 2, ANALYSIS OF 
COMPETITION,  [**232] CAPACITY, AND SERVICE QUALITY (Nov. 2009) (hereinafter, ""Christensen Report""). Plaintiffs say that the 
Christensen Report supports Dr. Rausser's conclusion that there was a structural break in the relationship between fuel costs 
and rail freight prices that was consistent with the start of the alleged conspiracy. See Oct. 6 Tr. at 140-41; see also Christensen 
Report at 9-16-9-17. Defendants say, among other things, that the Christensen Report ""does quite the opposite."" Oct. 7 Tr. at 
272. Defendants do not dispute, however, that the Christensen Report relies on evidence common to the class and itself 
constitutes such common evidence. Thus, if anything, the Christensen Report supports plaintiffs view that injury-in-fact is 
capable of common proof at trial. The question of which party's characterization of that report is correct is a matter to be resolved 
by the finder of fact at trial. "
777,1," The Court also declines to postpone the Case Management and Scheduling Order deadlines as proposed by Lakeland 
Regional. "
790,*," Circuit Judges Flaum, Rovner, and Williams took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. "
791,1," The indirect purchasers had sought injunctive relief under the federal antitrust laws, but the district court dismissed those 
claims, 667 F. Supp. 2d at 941, and they are not now before us. "
792,2," Data from the International Fertilizer Industry Association give the following figures for 2003 through 2009: 21,203.1 (2003); 
20,090.7 (2004); 19,273.3 (2005); 20,770.9 (2006); 19,455.1 (2007); 16,045.7 (2008); and 18,908.2 (2009). See http://www. 
fertilizer.org/ifa/ifadata/search (last visited June 25, 2012). These data appear to refer to thousands of metric tons. "
802,1, The facts are drawn from the Amended Complaint and are assumed to be true for purposes of this motion. 
803,2, Russell's name is misspelled as Russel in the amended complaint.
803,3," Some of these companies are  [*6] not listed in the case caption, but are listed in the body of the amended complaint."
803,4," In a March 26, 2012 Order, I stated that the motion for sanctions would not be heard unless and until the Defendants' motion to 
dismiss is granted. "
805,5," In Valdez, the court held that photos of properties taken by a real estate salesperson constitute ""listing information,"" ownership 
of which is vested in a real estate broker after the salesperson's ""association"" with the broker ends under New York law. See 
Valdez, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30160, 2010 WL 1221404, at *5-6 (citing 19 N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. § 175.14). The 
Defendants here have not advanced this argument."
805,6," I agree with the Defendants that, to the extent Sparig seeks prospective relief relating to the covenant not to compete, his 
claims are moot since the covenant has expired and no longer restricts him in any way."
805,7," Although Sparig has not expressly pleaded a breach of contract claim, his fourteenth cause of action refers to ""Nonpayment of 
Commissions."" Am. Compl. p. 32. "
806,8," The Defendants argue that Sparig cannot raise a piercing-the-veil claim for the first time in his opposition to their motion. But 
""an attempt of a third party to pierce the corporate veil does not constitute a cause of action independent of that against the 
corporation; rather it is an assertion of facts and circumstances which will persuade the court to impose the corporate obligation 
on its owners."" Morris v. N.Y. State Dep't of Taxation & Fin., 82 N.Y.2d 135, 623 N.E.2d 1157, 1160, 603 N.Y.S.2d 807 (N.Y. 
1993). Thus, Sparig did not need to assert a separate claim to pierce the corporate veil. "
807,9," Danenberg and Russell have submitted affidavits stating that Russell owns 99% of SRE and Danenberg owns the remaining 
1%. See Danenberg Aff. ¶¶ 3, 5, ECF No. 11; Russell Aff. ¶ 4, ECF No. 11. If Sparig wants to further amend his complaint based 
on this information, he may seek leave to do so. "
815,1," A Certificate is a document that shows ownership of a mortgage-backed security issued pursuant to a registration statement 
and prospectus supplement in a public offering. Each Certificate represents a particular tranche within an offering. Because 
""Certificate"" refers to the document evidencing ownership of a specific tranche, the Court uses the terms ""tranche"" and 
""Certificate"" somewhat interchangeably. An Offering refers to the process by which the Certificates were sold to Plaintiffs. The 
Offering Documents refer to the Registration Statements, Prospectuses and Prospectus Supplements, Term Sheets, and other 
written materials pursuant to which the Certificates were offered."
815,2," The Defendants are: CWALT, Inc., CWABS, Inc., CWMBS, Inc., CWHEQ, Inc., (the ""Depositors""), CFC, Countrywide Home

820,9," The Court further notes that the AC fails to plead with specificity facts that would allow the Court to infer that, at the time the 
Prospectus Supplements were issued, specific defendants intended for other specific defendants to violate the transfer-of-title 
provisions in the PSAs. Were this the AC's only deficiency, repleading the misrepresentation claims might be appropriate. As 
discussed above, it is not."
820,10," As discussed above, the Court accepts this proposition for the sake of argument but notes that Western and Southern has 
failed to plead subjective intent not to perform with the requisite level of specificity under Rule 9(b). "
821,11," The parties agree that the Court should look to federal law for interpretation of the OCAA. They disagree as to which Circuit's 
precedent is most helpful. The Court is interpreting an Ohio law. HN10[
] Ohio courts, though not bound by decisions from 
courts within the Sixth Circuit, frequently cite such decisions and would likely find them more persuasive than decisions from 
outside the Sixth  [*27] Circuit. The Court therefore gives preference to decisions from within the Sixth Circuit in the OCAA 
portion of this Order."
821,12," Ohio courts are split on the related question of whether a plaintiff must also plead an enterprise distinct from the alleged 
pattern of corrupt activity. Compare State v. Lynch, 2012 Ohio 2521, P21, 2012 WL 2050862, at *4 (Ohio Ct. App. June 6, 2012) 
(""We will therefore herein consider whether the State indeed demonstrated a 'structure separate and apart, or distinct, from the 
pattern of corrupt activity' concerning appellant's heroin-dealing activities."") with State v. Baker, 2012 Ohio 887, P12, 2012 WL 
707093, at *3 (Ohio Ct. App. Mar. 5, 2012) (""[T]his court has expressly rejected the notion that the state must prove that the 
enterprise is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.""). The Court does not find it necessary 
to reach this question. "
822,13," Western and Southern argues that HMV Properties does not apply because it involved a federal RICO claim and relied on pre-
Boyle authority. Opp. at 17-18 n.23. To the contrary, Ohio courts look to federal RICO cases to interpret the OCAA (supra, n.11), 
and HMV Properties explicitly considered Boyle and held that allegations similar  [*32] to the ones in this case were insufficient. 
HMV Properties, LLC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1161, at *37, 2011 WL 53166 at *14 (""Plaintiffs do little more than offer conclusory 
statements as to the existence of an association-in-fact enterprise without offering any facts in support of the Boyle factors: 
purpose, relationship, or longevity."")."
822,14," Two recent cases have held that Countrywide and LandSafe could constitute a RICO enterprise. In re Countrywide Fin. Corp. 
Mortg. Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig, 601 F. Supp. 2d 1201, 1214-15 (S.D. Cal. 2009);  [*37] Johnson v. KB Home, 720 F. Supp. 
2d 1109, 1120-21 (D. Ariz. 2010). Those cases did so HN15[
] under a doctrine called the ""something more"" test, which holds 
that a parent and its subsidiary may constitute a RICO enterprise when each plays a different role or the decision to operate 
through a subsidiary facilitates the activity of the enterprise in some way. In re Countrywide Fin. Corp. Mortg. Mktg. & Sales 
Practices Litig., 601 F. Supp. 2d at 1214-15. The ""something more"" test has not been endorsed by the Ninth Circuit, Sixth 
Circuit, or any Ohio court. The Court finds no indication that an Ohio court would apply the ""something more"" exception, and 
therefore declines to address it in this case. "
823,15," In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., cited by Western and Southern, is instructive. 618 F.3d 300 (3d Cir. 2010). There, the 
Third Circuit found that, under Boyle, a series of bilateral contracts between one broker and many insurers did not constitute a 
RICO enterprise. Id. at 375. The insurers were not connected as part of an enterprise because, ""plaintiffs' factual allegations do 
not plausibly imply anything more than parallel conduct by the insurers."" Id. at 374. A bid-rigging allegation succeeded, 
 [*38] because bid-rigging required the cooperation of the various insurers. Id. at 377-78. Nothing in the AC alleges that the 
underwriters coordinated or cooperated with each other. On the contrary, the implication of the AC is that Countrywide pressured 
the underwriters to compete with each other by ""waiving in"" increasing numbers of noncompliant loans."
823,16," The Court also notes that the allegations relating to foreclosure misconduct do not make economic sense. The gist of Plaintiff's 
foreclosure misconduct allegations is that foreclosure firms attempted to cover up deficiencies in title transfers and foreclose on 
borrowers. But it is not clear how that behavior could have hurt noteholders. If the foreclosure firms were successful, then the 
recovery to the trusts would increase; if unsuccessful, the trusts would not be in any worse position than before the misconduct. "
826,17," MassMutual was based on, among others, the following cases: Lintz v. Carey Manor Ltd., 613 F. Supp. 543, 551 (W.D. Va. 
1985) (""Just as the same act can violate both federal and state law simultaneously, or a state statute as well as state common 
law, so too can it violate several Blue Sky laws simultaneously.""); Simms Inv. Co. v. E.F. Hutton & Co., 699 F. Supp. 543, 546 
(M.D.N.C. 1988) (""[T]he securities laws of two or more states may be applicable to a single transaction without presenting a

894,1," The ALJ identified a fourth battery type - the uninterruptible power source(""UPS"") — but the Commission rejected that finding, 
and it is not at issue on appeal. "
895,2," The complaint also charged Polypore with entering into an unlawful joint marketing agreement with Hollingsworth & Vose, in 
violation of § 5 of the FTC Act, and that Daramic monopolized the alleged relevant markets, in violation of § 5, by executing 
contracts with large customers that would preclude or deter Microporous from competing effectively. The ALJ found against 
Polypore on  [**9] the first count but against complaint counsel on the second. Neither decision was appealed to the 
Commission."
895,3," United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963). "
896,4," Once the Government makes a showing that the firm controls an undue percentage share of the relevant market and the 
acquisition would cause a significant increase in the concentration, the defendant must produce evidence that shows the market 
share statistics inaccurately show the probable effect on competition.  [**12] FTC v. Univ. Health, Inc., 938 F.2d 1206, 1218 
(11th Cir. 1991). "
897,5," El Paso supplied more than 50% of the gas consumed in California and was the only out-of-state provider. Here, Daramic 
controlled 48% of the SLI market to Entek's 52%, and one battery producer testified that the two did not act as competitors."
897,6," In El Paso, Pacific Northwest's dealings with the utility customer caused El Paso to depart from its previous offer of interruptible 
supply and offer the utility a long-term contract for firm deliveries and at lower prices. In the instant case, Microporous's dealings 
with East Penn caused Polypore to make price concessions to East Penn. Similarly, Microporous's overture to JCI caused 
Polypore to seek a longer term contract."
897,7," See Graphic Prods. Distribs., Inc. v. Itek Corp., 717 F.2d 1560, 1573 (11th Cir. 1983)  [**16] (HN5[
] ""Evidence of intent is 
highly probative . . . 'because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret the facts and to predict consequences.'"") 
(quoting Chi. Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 244, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918))."
897,8," Although El Paso did not use the term actual competitor, that meaning was clear. The court held: ""Unsuccessful bidders are no 
less competitors than the successful one."" 376 U.S. at 661, 84 S. Ct. at 1049. It also noted that the acquired company's efforts to 
win contracts, ""though unsuccessful, had a powerful influence"" on El Paso. Id. at 659, 84 S. Ct. at 1048. Similarly, Microporous 
was an unsuccessful bidder, and its efforts had an influence on the market very similar to that in El Paso."
897,9," Polypore's only other argument - that the acquisition here did not increase concentration because Microporous had no actual 
pre-acquisition sales in the market - is foreclosed by El Paso. Moreover, the acquisition here did increase concentration in that it 
eliminated the pre-acquisition influence on the market exercised by Microporous. And, it eliminated the competition in the 
 [**18] market which Polypore itself contemplated in its MP Plan."
897,10," Our confidence that Microporous was an actual competitor is amply supported by the Supreme Court decisions in El Paso and 
Marine Bancorporation. That conclusion, and the applicability of the presumption, is also confirmed by the leading scholar: HN6[
] The acquisition by an already dominant firm of a new or nascent rival can be just as anticompetitive as a merger to 
monopoly. If the rival has already made its first sale in the monopolist's market, the merger is clearly ""horizontal."" If the rival 
has not yet made its first sale, the tendency is to call the acquisition a ""potential competition"" or non-horizontal merger. But 
the distinction between ""actual"" and ""potential"" competition is readily exaggerated. For example, a firm that submits bids 
against the dominant firm but loses is clearly an ""actual"" competitor, perhaps even forcing the dominant firm to lower its bid 
in the face of a rival bidder. But even the firm that is preparing to make its first bid or its first sale must be counted as an 
""actual"" rival once the entry decision has been made. "
898,," Acquisition of such a rival preserves the dominant firm's status, at least until another  [**19] nascent rival appears on the 
scene. In most such cases, we do not believe it is worthwhile to ascertain the number of rivals or the likelihood or time 
period in which another nascent rival will appear. The important point is that the acquisition eliminates an important route by 
which competition could have increased in the immediate future. It thus bears a very strong presumption of illegality that 
should rarely be defeated."
898,4," Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 912a (3d ed. 2006)."
898,11," Our careful review of the  [**20] record persuades us that the several challenges to the Commission's findings of fact are 
wholly without merit - e.g., with respect to whether Microporous's dealings with JCI, Exide, and East Penn involved the SLI 
market; with respect to whether Microporous's board of directors was on board with the expansion plans of management; with 
respect to the imminent capability of Microporous to supply the SLI market; and with respect to whether before acquisition, 
Polypore did in fact act in procompetitive ways (in the SLI market as well as the other two markets) in response to Microporous's 
dealings in the market."
898,12," Because we conclude that this case is guided by El Paso, and because the Commission properly applied the Philadelphia 
National presumption, we do not reach the Commission's alternative holding that the acquisition violated § 7 based on the 
potential competitor doctrine. "
900,13," Polypore argues in its reply brief that the divestiture order should have contained a ""safety valve,"" like that found in Chicago 
Bridge & Iron Co. v. FTC, 534 F.3d 410 (5th Cir. 2008), which permitted the exclusion of certain assets in the divestiture order if 
the acquirer and the monitor trustee both found them unnecessary. However, Polypore neither raised this issue before the 
Commission nor in its initial brief so the issue is waived. See Norelus v. Denny's, Inc., 628 F.3d 1270, 1297 (11th Cir. 2010) 
(initial brief); Cotherman v. FTC, 417 F.2d 587, 591-92 (5th Cir. 1969) (exhaustion before the FTC). "

911,2," Notably, ""Plaintiffs argue[d] that there is 'no realistic possibility' that the direct purchasers of interchange fees—i.e., the card-
issuing banks—would file a lawsuit challenging the unlawful fixing of those fees, for several reasons."" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
97009, [WL] at *7. The district court rejected the argument, ""because it ignores the critical fact that the overwhelming majority of 
ATM card-issuing banks pay more in interchange fees than they receive."" Id. In other words, they are net payers. Id. ""Because 
they pay more in interchange fees than they receive, the higher the interchange fee, the higher their costs. Thus, there is a very "
912,," realistic possibility that these entities (or some subset of them) would file suit to challenge the fixing of interchange fees at 
artificially high rates."" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97009, [WL] at *8. In the end, the district court concluded that ""card-issuing banks 
are better-off if interchange fees are eliminated,"" and so they have incentive to sue. Id. "
913,3," ""[T]he exception that [Freeman] purported to recognize is not yet one acknowledged by the Supreme Court, which has thus far 
been indifferent to the question whether the  [**18] direct purchaser is likely to sue. What the [Ninth Circuit] was really describing 
was a 'control' or perhaps a 'co-conspirator' exception."" 2A Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law ¶ 346f (3d ed. 2007). "
914,4," Although the argument touches upon the initial inquiry whether Plaintiffs are indirect purchasers, we address the argument 
within our discussion of the co-conspirator exception. "
916,5," Plaintiffs argue that Delaware Valley construed Shamrock Foods to mean that plaintiffs have standing by ""establish[ing] a price-

Freeman, 322 F.3d at 1140. "
918,7," In In re TFT LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litigation, the Northern District of California held that a purchaser of a finished TFT-LCD 
product was a direct purchaser, even though ""the alleged price-fixing conspiracy existed only with regard to TFT-LCD panels, 
and not finished products."" 267 F.R.D. 291, 306-07 (N.D. Cal. 2010).  [**35] The district court classified consumers of the final 
products as direct purchasers because they ""purchase[d] directly from the alleged violator."" Id. at 307 (quoting In re Sugar Indus. 
Antitrust Litig., 579 F.2d 13, 17 (3d Cir. 1978)). In support of the conclusion, the Northern District of California cited two Third 
Circuit cases. In In re Sugar Industries Antitrust Litigation, the Third Circuit classified candy wholesalers as direct purchasers because the 
candy manufacturers also refined sugar (sugar refiners being the alleged violators). 579 F.2d at 17-18. In In re Sugar Industries, 
the plaintiff ""limited the issue to the summary judgment only insofar as it affects the direct purchases of candy from defendants,"" 
because ""in the face of Illinois Brick . . . plaintiff has no hope of success on the purchases from nondefendants."" Id. at 16. Thus, 
In re Sugar Industries actually exemplifies the exception allowed when an upstream violator controls or owns the direct 
purchaser, which is discussed in more detail below. See id. at 18-19; 2A Phillip E. Areeda et al., Antitrust Law ¶ 346f & n. 41. Later, in In re Linerboard Antitrust Litigation, the Third Circuit classified purchasers of corrugated  [**36] sheets and boxes as 
direct purchasers of linerboard (which was included in the purchased corrugated sheets and boxes), because the linerboard was 
subject to a price-fixing agreement. 305 F.3d 145, 158-60 (3d Cir. 2002) (""Illinois Brick . . . bans Clayton Act lawsuits by persons 
who are not direct purchasers from the defendant antitrust violator.""). Similarly, the Seventh Circuit has held that ""the first 
purchaser[ ] from outside the conspiracy"" may sue. Paper Sys. Inc. v. Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 281 F.3d 629, 631-32 (7th Cir. 
2002). Thus, these cases restrict Illinois Brick's influence by allowing an exception when the direct purchaser conspires with the 
seller, even though the price illegally set is an upstream cost that is passed-on to the plaintiffs. This contradicts the Supreme 
Court's admonition ""not to 'carve out exceptions to the [direct purchaser] rule for particular types of markets.'"" Utilicorp, 497 U.S. 
at 216 (quoting Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 744). "
919,8," Freeman concludes the paragraph discussing the exception by stating that ""[t]here's no realistic possibility Sandicor will sue 
them,"" but in the corresponding footnote the court finds Royal Printing applicable because of the associations ownership of 
Sandicor. 322 F.3d at 1146 n.12."
919,9," We do not rely on the same reasoning as the district court, because Royal Printing may cast some doubt on the  [**40] district 
court's conclusion. In Royal Printing, we found that the plaintiffs had standing to sue for the purchases they had made from 
wholesalers controlled by the paper manufactures even though the plaintiffs also made purchases from independent 
wholesalers. Royal Printing, 621 F.2d at 324, 327-28. "
920,10," As for the time period from July 2, 2000, to February 1, 2001, there  [**44] are no allegations that Bank Defendants controlled 
one another or conspired to fix foreign ATM fees. As such, the concern in Royal Printing of a controlling party prohibiting the 
direct purchaser from suing is not present here. "

following the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Schering-Plough. However, none of the cases cited by defendants employs such a 
presumption; rather, they stand for the unsurprising proposition that HN6[
] this court will follow the decisions of its sister courts 
where it finds them persuasive. See, e.g., Ramadan v. Chase Manhattan Corp., 229 F.3d 194, 197-203 (3d Cir. 2000) (following 
the rulings of other courts of appeal on similar facts but conducting an independent analysis). As explained below, we do not find 
the Eleventh Circuit's decision in Schering-Plough persuasive, and thus decline to follow it."
937,9," The Eleventh Circuit subsequently applied, without further significant explication, the scope of the patent test announced in 
Valley Drug and Schering-Plough in another case, Andrx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Elan Corporation, PLC, 421 F.3d 1227 (11th 
Cir. 2005). "
938,10," That case was severed by the Second Circuit and transferred to the Federal  [**37] Circuit because it involved a claim arising 
out of patent law. See Order, No. 05-2863 (2d Cir. Nov. 7, 2007). "
939,11," The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America points to a more recent study concluding that, in the years from 
2000 to 2009, generics prevailed in slightly less than half of their challenges. RBC Capital Mkts., Pharmaceuticals: Analyzing 
Litigation Success Rates 4 (2010), available at http://www.amlawdaily.typepad.com/pharmareport.pdf. Even if the industry's own 
figures are accepted, they show that a substantial fraction of Hatch-Waxman patent challenges  [**41] succeed on the merits. 
Moreover, the study cited by the industry further states that ""when you take into account patent settlements and cases that were 
dropped, the success rate for generics jumps to 76%, substantially in favor of challenging patents."" Id. "
942,12," Plaintiffs argue that because defendants' cross appeal was dismissed as untimely defendants' 23(f) petition should have been 
dismissed also. HN19[
] An appeals court has discretion to consider an interlocutory appeal even after the entry of final 
judgment. Cf. In re Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Prods. Antitrust Litig., 788 F.2d 1571, 1573-74 (Temp. Emer. 
Ct. App. 1986). Moreover, in granting defendants' 23(f) petition, this court has already considered the issue of the 
appropriateness of review, and we see no reason to reconsider the decision to hear this appeal. "
943,13," Specifically, the Special Master excluded from the class direct purchasers who did not purchase a generic version of K-Dur 
after generic entry. "
946,14," This is a different appeal than Valley Drug, 344 F.3d 1294 (11th Cir. 2003), discussed supra. "
947,1," Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Final Approval of the Class Action Settlement Between Plaintiffs and Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco 
Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc. (Doc. No. 465) (hereinafter, ""Mot.""). They also submitted filings supplementing this Motion. 
(Doc. Nos. 483, 484, and 690). "
948,2," The factual background discussed here is drawn from the exhibits and materials submitted in relation to the Motion sub judice, 
the hearing on the Motion, and the overall record of this case. The Court  [**2] also considered the Plaintiffs' Motion for Final 
Approval of the Sparboe Settlement (Doc. No. 443) (hereinafter, ""Sparboe Final Approval Mot.""), and the pending Plaintiffs' 
Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and for Reimbursement of Expenses (Doc. No. 493) (hereinafter, ""Fees Mot.""), in which 
Plaintiffs seek attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses relating to the litigation to be paid from the Moark Settlement. As 
to the motion for fees, the Court does not address here the substantive arguments, which will be addressed separately."
948,3," Land O'Lakes Inc. filed an individual motion to dismiss this complaint (Doc. No. 239) and joined Moark, LLC and Norco Ranch, 
Inc., as well as several other Defendants, in certain joint motions to dismiss the complaint. The individual motion and the joint 
motions respect to Moark were withdrawn with subject to reinstatement if the proposed Moark Settlement is not finally approved. 
See Stipulation (Doc. No. 338). Although they had joined several joint motions to dismiss, Moark, LLC and Norco Ranch, Inc. 
also filed an answer to the complaint. See Answer (Doc. No. 245)."
948,4," Plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking leave to file a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint that seeks, inter alia, 
to revive claims against Defendants Hillandale-Gettysburg, L.P., Hillandale Farms, Inc., and Hillandale Farms East, Inc. and to 
amend claims of fraudulent  [**5] concealment and tolling of the statute of limitations. Opposition briefing has been filed, and the 
Court will address that motion separately. "
949,5," In Case Management Order No. 1, the Court approved the following law firms to serve as Interim Co-Lead Counsel: Weinstein 
Kitchenoff & Asher LLC; Hausfeld LLP; Bernstein Liebhard LLP; and Susman Godfrey LLP. It appears there are additional 
counsel that Interim Co-Lead Counsel have directed to work on this case. See Fees Mot. at 1. Thus, reference herein to ""Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel"" may also encompass the efforts of other counsel who represent Plaintiffs and acted at the direction of Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel."
949,6," Eleven days following the execution of the Moark Settlement, the parties executed a First Addendum to Settlement Agreement 
Between Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs and Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc. and Land O'Lakes, Inc. Mot., Ex. 1B (Doc. 
No. 465-4). The Addendum extended the date that obliged Moark to transfer the Settlement Amount to an escrow account from 
ten days following the execution date of the Moark Settlement to sixteen days. Id. "
950,7," The  [**10] terms used in this Order that are defined in the Moark Settlement Agreement are, unless otherwise defined herein, 
used in this Order consistent with the definitions of the agreement. "
951,8," The agreement provided that Settlement Fund may be reduced if ""class members whose sales equal 7.5% or more of the total 
US egg sales"" opt out of the Moark Settlement. Moark Notice at 3. However, this reduction provision is inapplicable because the 
condition that would otherwise trigger that provision did not occur. See Final Hr'g Tr. at 35:10-35:20. "
952,9," The Plaintiff's Motion stated that 894 Claim Forms had been submitted. See Keough Aff. ¶ 16. However, because the Plaintiffs 
provided updated numbers during their presentation in the final fairness hearing, the Court references those numbers here. 
Plaintiffs intend to make recommendations as to the treatment of late Claims Forms in a plan of allocation that will be submitted 
for the Court's approval."
952,10," The Direct Action Plaintiff Status Report states that ""[a]ll of the Direct Action Plaintiffs except Giant Eagle have remained in the 
Moark class  [**20] settlement based on the statements in the Moark Class Settlement Agreement and Notice that remaining in 
that settlement class ""does not prejudice their rights to exclude themselves from any other past, present or future settlement 
class or certified litigation class"" in this case. To be clear, only Giant Eagle has opted out of the Moark settlement class."" Id. at 2. 
This statement applies only to the presently pending Direct Action Plaintiff cases brought by The Kroger Co. and co-plaintiffs 
(Civil Action No. 10-7605 (E.D. Pa.)), Supervalu Inc. (Civil Action No. 10-6736 (E.D. Pa.)), Publix Super Markets, Inc. (Civil 
Action No. 10-6737 (E.D. Pa.)), and Giant Eagle, Inc. (Civil Action No. 10-1698 (W.D. Pa.)). The statement does not apply to the pending Direct Action Plaintiff cases brought by Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs 
(Civil Action No. 11-8808 (E.D. Pa.), and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. (Civil Action No. 11-0510 (E.D. Pa.). Both of these cases were 
filed after the Status Report. However, because Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs' names do not appear on the list of 
names of those parties who filed requests for exclusion from the Moark Settlement, Exhibit 4 to  [**21] the Plaintiffs' Motion (Doc. 
No. 465-10), it appears that this group of Direct Action Plaintiffs did not opt-out of the Moark Settlement. However, the names of "
953,," Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs do appear on that list, and it appears they have opted out of the Settlement. See 
Keough Aff. ¶ 17. Moark and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc., C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company, L.P. 
recently reported reaching a settlement of the claims against Moak and submitted a stipulation of dismissal that the Court is 
approving this same date."
953,11," The Court recognizes that the statistics provided here slightly differ with the equivalent statistics that the Plaintiffs provided in 
connection with their motion for approval of the Sparboe Settlement. However, the Court deems these minor differences to be 
inconsequential."
953,12," Although Moark served notice of the settlement to the appropriate officials, it did not do so promptly after the Agreement was 
filed, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1715(b). Mot. at 9. Section 1715(b) provides: ""Not later than 10 days after a proposed 
settlement of a class action is filed in court, each defendant that is participating in the proposed settlement shall serve upon the 
appropriate State official of each State in which a class member resides and the appropriate Federal official, a notice of the "
954,," proposed settlement . . . ."" Under Section 1715(d), an order granting final approval of a settlement agreement may not take 
place earlier than ninety days after the appropriate federal and state officials have been served with notice. Plaintiffs advised the Court about the timing of the CAFA notice requirement on the Moark and Sparboe Settlements, and 
requested the Court proceed with the final approval hearing on the Moark Settlement  [**25] as scheduled and to hold its 
decision on the Plaintiffs' motion for final approval in abeyance until the ninety-day expiration date passed without any objections 
or requests for hearings being received from any relevant authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1715(d). See Mot. at 9. Over ninety 
days have elapsed since Moark served the appropriate state or federal officials with the CAFA notice, and there have been no 
requests for hearings or objections to the settlement made. It follows that, although the notice requirements under CAFA have 
not been fully met on a technical basis, the substance of the requirements have been satisfied insofar as giving federal and state 
officials sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard concerning the Moark Settlement. See D.S. ex rel. S.S. v. New York City 
Dep't of Educ., 255 F.R.D. 59, 80 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (approving the settlement on a provisional basis until the CAFA notice 
deadline passes and no federal or state official requests a hearing); Kay Co. v. Equitable Prod. Co., No. 06 Civ. 00612, 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41892, 2010 WL 1734869, at *4 (S.D. W.Va. Apr. 28, 2010) (""Since more than 100 days have passed since 
service was perfected and since there have been no adverse comments  [**26] from any of the aforesaid State or Federal 
officials, the Court FINDS that compliance with CAFA is satisfactory.""). But see True v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 749 F. Supp. 2d 
1052, 1083 (C.D. Cal.2010) (determining that its authority to approve a settlement was ""questionable"" when the defendant gave 
CAFA notice only ten days prior to the final settlement approval hearing). "
956,13," The Supreme Court recently explained: ""What matters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common 'questions'—even 
in droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the 
litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common answers."" 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class 
Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)) "
957,14," The Court may also consider other possibly relevant information as to the adequacy of counsel, such as proposed terms for 
attorneys' fees and nontaxable costs and ""any other matter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the 
interests of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B), (C). "
960,15," For these same reasons, to the extent that consideration of Rule 23(b)(3)(C)  [**49] is pertinent here, and, for now, without 
regard to the remand mechanisms for an MDL action, it would be preferable to adjudicate these claims in one judicial proceeding 
and in one forum as a class action. See Amalgamated Workers Union of Virgin Islands v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., 478 F.2d 
540, 543, 10 V.I. 575 (3d Cir. 1973) (""The 'superiority requirement' was intended to refer to the preferability of adjudicating 
claims of multiple-parties in one judicial proceeding and in one forum, rather than forcing each plaintiff to proceed by separate 
suit, and possibly requiring a defendant to answer suits growing out of one incident in geographically separated courts.""). See 
generally Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) 1966 note (""Also pertinent is the question of the desirability of concentrating the trial of the 
claims in the particular forum by means of a class action, in contrast to allowing the claims to be litigated separately in forums to 
which they would ordinarily be brought.""). However, as one commentator has discussed, in light of 28 U.S.C. § 1407, as a 
general matter, ""[t]his factor should . . . be of little or no significance in resolving the superiority issue."" Newberg, supra, §4:31. 
Indeed,  [**50] this factor appears to have limited bearing under the present circumstances because the United States Judicial 
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation previously considered, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the desirability of centralizing the various 
initially-filed direct purchaser class action suits in this particular forum, see In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 588 F. 
Supp. 2d 1366, 1367 (J.P.M.L. 2008), and a consolidated class action complaint was filed which superseded all previously-filed 
direct purchaser complaints. "
962,16," The Third Circuit Court of Appeals recognizes that ""[g]reat weight is accorded [the] views [of the trial judge] because he is 
exposed to the litigants, and their strategies, positions and proofs. He is aware of the expense and possible legal bars to 
success. Simply stated, he is on the firing line and can evaluate the action accordingly."" Walsh v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Co., Inc., 726 F.2d 956, 965 (3d Cir. 1983) (quoting Ace Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Crane Co., 453 F.2d 30, 34 (3d Cir. 1971))."
962,17," The Manual for Complex Litigation observes that the ""task is demanding because the adversariness of litigation is often lost 
after the agreement to settle."" David F. Herr, The Manual for Complex Litigation § 21.61, at 487 (4th ed. 2011). Indeed, the 
observation that ""'[c]ourts applying [a multifactor] test [ ] often recite the litany and engage in pro forma analyses, but their hearts 
are not in it,'"" could be an equally a propos statement for those parties advancing unopposed motions for final settlement 
approval. Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 605 n.10 (3d Cir. 2010) (dissenting, Smith, J.) (quoting Jonathan R. 
Macey & Geoffrey P. Miller, Judicial Review of Class Action Settlements, 1 J. of Legal Analysis 167, 172 (2009)). Here, there is an absence of any objectors or any adversarial challenge to the Motion at bar, which appears to account for the 
dearth of any arguments criticizing, exposing, or meaningfully addressing possible flaws or drawbacks to the settlement 
agreement appearing in the record. Nonetheless, the Court recognizes that although the final settlement approval process may 
have lacked an edgy or adversarial demeanor, this does not necessarily  [**57] bear on whether the settlement negotiation 
process was adversarial and resulted in a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement. This is because the focus here is on the 
settlement agreement, and ""[w]hether or not there are objectors or opponents to the proposed settlement, the court must make 
an independent analysis of the settlement terms."" Herr, supra, at 488. Furthermore, the Court notes that, in response to the 
Court's inquiries for additional facts and development of the record, Interim Co-Lead Counsel fully and appropriately cooperated 
in the Court's efforts to consider and analyze the proposed settlement. Nonetheless, in the event that any other partial or complete settlements are reached in the future of this case, or in this multi-
district litigation generally, all parties' counsel are well-advised to, again, continue to be responsive and attentive to the Court's 
inquiries as to settlement agreements during the various approval processes, and also to anticipate and be cognizant of what 
appropriate, specific information the Court needs—particularly in light of recent case law developments—in order to perform the 
fact intensive inquiry required for executing its duty to protect  [**58] absentee class members. After all, the burden lies with the 
movants to demonstrate that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. "
963,18," The Court of Appeals invites individualized analysis by noting that ""[o]ther related factors . . . also may be relevant to this 
inquiry."" Prudential, 148 F. 3d at 323 n.73. "
965,19," Although the response rate to the Notice of Settlement (as measured by the number of Claim Forms returned in relation to 
number of Notices distributed) is low, the Court does not draw any inferences of negative class reaction to the settlement from 
this response rate. Cf. Zimmer Paper Products, Inc. v. Berger & Montague, P.C., 758 F.2d 86, 92-93 (3d Cir. 1985) (recognizing 
that an ostensibly low response rate may not in fact be low in light of other similar settlements). As previously discussed, the 
Court has determined that Class Members had adequate notice and opportunity to submit claims, opt out, or file objections. 
Furthermore, by comparison there were an additional  [**67] 222 Class Members who only requested exclusion from the 
Sparboe Settlement. See Keogh Aff. ¶ 17."
965,20," Interim Co-Lead Counsel has represented that several of the parties that opted out of the settlement, and that have now filed 
suits as Direct Action Plaintiffs, were in contact with counsel prior to the filing of this class action suit and so ""Plaintiffs and [those 
parties"" knew exactly what [the suit] was about. So . . . everyone was well familiar with what the settlement was, what the terms 
of settlement were, and what the litigation was about."" See Final Hr'g Tr. at 42:19-43:2."
965,21," As to this Girsh factor, the Plaintiffs' Motion argues that this factor weighs in favor of final approval because of ""the cooperation 
that will be provided by Moark as a result of this Settlement."" Mot. at 17. Because this factor requires assessment of the 
adequacy of counsel's knowledge and appreciation for the merits before settlement negotiations to ensure those negotiations 
are informed, the Court does not find this particular post hoc argument dispositive of whether Interim Co-Lead Counsel was 
adequately informed entering into and during settlement negotiations."
965,22," The Court recognizes that once experienced litigators, such as Interim Co-Lead Counsel, have acquired certain knowledge or 
insights about the litigation, such information will continue to inform Counsel's understanding of the case and appreciation of the 
merits. Accordingly, the Court determines it is appropriate to cross-reference here its observations and findings made in its "
966,," separate Memorandum concerning final approval of the Sparboe Settlement as it is relevant to the Court's independent 
assessment of this Girsh factor."
966,23," Additionally, Moark ""provided sales data and other financial information"" in advance of settlement negotiations ""that permitted 
Plaintiffs to accurately estimate the range of damages that could be proven at trial."" Bernstein Decl. ¶ 9. This particular 
information exchange appears primarily to have assisted  [**72] Interim Co-Lead Counsel in supporting the value of the 
settlement. See, e.g., id. ¶ 16 (framing the settlement amount in terms of Moark egg sales, net profits, and availability of ""reliable 
data""); Mot. at 11-12 (""The Settlement Agreement was only entered into after careful review of Moark's sales figures, net profits 
and market share during the damages period, and balanced them against the likely expense of litigating claims against Moark 
through trial.""). However, this does not appear to be the only result of the information exchange because such information also 
would have furthered counsel's appreciation for the merits of the case as well as establishing damages and identification of 
potential class members. "
968,24," Based on this observation, the Court of Appeals has questioned the significance of this factor in ""settlement-only"" class 
actions following the Supreme Court's decision in Amchem. See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321. "
969,25," The Third Circuit Court of Appeals expects that ""settling parties . . . should . . . provide[] information to determine the range of 
reasonableness of the [settlement] allocation 'in light of the best possible recovery,' and 'in light of all the attendant risks of 
litigation.'"" Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 354 (citations omitted). The Court further explains that ""'[t]his figure should generate a range of 
reasonableness (based on size of the proposed award and the uncertainty inherent in these estimates) within which a district 
court approving (or rejecting) a settlement will not be set aside.' Precise value determinations are not required.'"" Id."
969,26, Plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence for the record concerning such a present value analysis. 
970,27," The Court does not comment on whether the information and facts that Moark may provide would be established, or even 
admissible, at trial, based upon counsel's representations. "
972,28," See generally In re Ikon Office Solutions, Inc., Secs. Litig., 194 F.R.D. 166, 184 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (""Approval of a plan of 
allocation of a settlement fund in a class action is 'governed by the same standards of review applicable to approval of the 
settlement as a whole: the distribution plan must be fair, reasonable and adequate.' "" (quoting In re Computron Software, Inc., 6 
F. Supp. 2d 313, 321 (D.N.J. 1998));  [**94] Newberg, supra, § 12.35 (same)."
972,29," As discussed earlier, following the final fairness hearing Plaintiffs filed a Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and for 
Reimbursement of Expenses, in which Plaintiffs seek specific amounts for attorneys' fees and reimbursement  [**96] of 
expenses relating to the litigation to be paid from the Moark Settlement. The Court intends to address this Motion separately, 
and does not consider here the substantive arguments presented in that Motion in relation to considering whether the Moark 
Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. After all, the Court's inquiry as to this Prudential factor focuses on whether the 
settlement agreement's provision for attorneys' fees are reasonable, and that provision only sets forth that attorneys' fees and 
expenses are subject to Court approval. "
976,1," Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Final Approval of Settlement Agreement with Sparboe Farms, Inc. (Doc. No. 443) (hereinafter, 
""Mot.""). They also submitted filings supplementing this Motion. (Doc. Nos. 483 and 485). "
977,2," The background discussed here is drawn from the exhibits and materials submitted in relation  [**2] to the Motion sub judice, 
the hearing on the Motion, and the overall record of this case, including the Plaintiffs' Motion for Final Approval of the Class 
Action Settlement Between Plaintiffs and Defendants Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and Land O'Lakes, Inc. (Doc. No. 465) 
(hereinafter, ""Moark Final Approval Mot."")."
977,3," Plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking leave to file a Third Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint that seeks, inter alia, 
to revive claims against Defendants Hillandale-Gettysburg, L.P., Hillandale Farms, Inc., and Hillandale Farms East, Inc. and to 
amend claims of fraudulent concealment and tolling of the statute of limitations. Opposition briefing has been filed, and the Court 
will address that motion separately. "
978,4," In Case Management Order No. 1, the Court approved the following law firms to serve as Interim Co-Lead Counsel: Weinstein 
Kitchenoff & Asher LLC; Hausfeld LLP; Bernstein Liebhard LLP; and Susman Godfrey LLP. It appears there are additional 
counsel that Interim Co-Lead Counsel have directed to work on this case. See Fees Mot. at 1. Thus, reference herein to ""Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel"" may also encompass the efforts of other counsel who represent Plaintiffs and acted at the direction of Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel. "
979,5," Paragraph 3 of the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint states: Plaintiffs entered into a Settlement Agreement with Sparboe Farms, Inc. (""Sparboe""), a formerly named Defendant, which 
this Court has preliminarily approved. As part of that Settlement Agreement, Sparboe agreed to cooperate with Plaintiffs 
and provide documents and information related to the allegations in Plaintiffs' initial Complaint. Plaintiffs have incorporated 
much of that information into this Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint."
979,6," The terms used in this Order that are defined in the Sparboe Settlement Agreement are, unless otherwise defined herein, used 
in this Order consistent with the definitions of the agreement. "
980,7," In the Agreement, ""Class Period"" is defined as ""the period from and including January 1, 2000 up to and including the date 
 [**14] when Notice of the Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving this settlement and certifying a class for settlement 
purposes is first published."" Id. ¶ 5. Thus, the Class Period for the Sparboe Settlement is from January 1, 2000 through October 
23, 2009. This actual Class Period contrasts with the end date for the Class Period listed in the Notice of the Sparboe Settlement, which is 
stated as July 15, 2010. See Mot., Ex. 2.A., Notice of Sparboe Settlement at 2 (Doc. No. 443-6) (hereinafter, ""Sparboe Notice""). 
It appears that the date listed in the Sparboe Notice is an inadvertent typo. July 15, 2010 is the end date of the class period for 
the Moark Settlement (and the date on which the Court preliminarily approved the Moark Settlement and the notices of the 
Sparboe and Moark Settlements). See Order on Preliminary Approval of Settlement with Moark, LLC, Norco Ranch, Inc., and 
Land O'Lakes Inc.; Notice Approval Order; Mot., Ex. 2.A., Notice of Moark Settlement at 2. "

court); Direct Action Plaintiff Status Report (Doc. No. 457). The Direct Action Plaintiff Status Report states that ""[a]ll of the Direct Action Plaintiffs . . . have opted out of the Sparboe class 
settlement and will play no role in the fairness hearing."" Id. at 2. This statement applies only to the presently pending Direct 
Action Plaintiff cases brought by The Kroger Co. and co-plaintiffs (Civil Action No. 10-7605 (E.D. Pa.)), Supervalu Inc. (Civil 
Action No. 10-6736 (E.D. Pa.)), Publix Super Markets, Inc. (Civil Action No. 10-6737 (E.D. Pa.)), and Giant Eagle, Inc. (Civil 
Action No. 10-1698 (W.D. Pa.)). The statement does not apply to the  [**21] pending Direct Action Plaintiff cases brought by Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and its co-
plaintiffs (Civil Action No. 11-8808 (E.D. Pa.)), and Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. (Civil Action No. 11-0510 (E.D. Pa.)). Both of these 
cases were filed after the Status Report. However, it appears that Kraft Foods Global, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs, and Winn-Dixie 
Stores, Inc. and its co-plaintiffs, have opted out of the Sparboe Settlement. See Keough Aff. ¶ 17."
982,9," The Court recognizes that the statistics provided here slightly differ with the equivalent statistics that the Plaintiffs provided in 
connection with their motion for approval of the Moark Settlement. However, the Court deems these minor differences to be 
inconsequential. "
983,10," Although Sparboe served notice of the settlement to the appropriate officials, it did not do so promptly after the Agreement 
was filed, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1715(b). Mot. at 7. Section 1715(b) provides: ""Not later than 10 days after a proposed 
settlement of a class action is filed in court, each defendant that is participating in the proposed settlement shall serve upon the 
appropriate State official of each State in which a class member resides and the appropriate Federal official, a notice of the 
proposed settlement . . . ."" Under Section 1715(d), an order granting final approval of a settlement agreement may not take 
place earlier than ninety days after the appropriate federal and state officials have been served with notice. Plaintiffs advised the Court about the timing of the CAFA notice requirement on the Sparboe and Moark Settlements, and 
requested the Court proceed with the final approval hearing on the Sparboe Settlement as scheduled and to hold its decision on 
the Plaintiffs' motion for final approval  [**25] in abeyance until the ninety-day expiration date passed without any objections or 
requests for hearings being received from any relevant authority pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1715(d). See Mot. at 7. Over ninety 
days have elapsed since Sparboe served the appropriate state or federal officials with the CAFA notice, and there have been no 
requests for hearings or objections to the settlement. It follows that, although the notice requirements under CAFA have not 
been fully met on a technical basis, the substance of the requirements have been satisfied insofar as giving federal and state 
officials sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard concerning the Sparboe Settlement. See D.S. ex rel. S.S. v. New York City 
Dep't of Educ., 255 F.R.D. 59, 80 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (approving the settlement on a provisional basis until the CAFA notice 
deadline passes and no federal or state official requests a hearing); Kay Co. v. Equitable Prod. Co., No. 06 Civ. 00612, 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41892, 2010 WL 1734869, at *4 (S.D. W.Va. Apr. 28, 2010) (""Since more than 100 days have passed since 
service was perfected and since there have been no adverse comments from any of the aforesaid State or Federal officials, the 
Court FINDS that compliance  [**26] with CAFA is satisfactory.""). But see True v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 749 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 
1083 (C.D. Cal. 2010) (determining that its authority to approve a settlement was ""questionable"" when the defendant gave CAFA 
notice only ten days prior to the final settlement approval hearing). "
985,11," The Supreme Court recently explained: ""What matters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common 'questions'—even 
in droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common  [**32] answers apt to drive the resolution of 
the litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common 
answers."" Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class 
Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009))."
985,12," For purposes of this Motion and in considering the Plaintiffs' claims against Sparboe, the Court considers Sparboe as a named 
Defendant in this suit even though it is not named as a defendant in the operative pleading, the Second Consolidated Amended 
Class Action Complaint. The Court recognizes that the Order preliminarily approving the Sparboe Settlement stayed the suit 
against Sparboe and was entered prior to the filing of the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. As explained 
above, the Court determines that if Sparboe had been named as a defendant in the Second Consolidated Amended, the claims 
against it would not have substantively differed from the essence of the claims against it asserted in the First Consolidated 
Amended Class Action Complaint. "
986,13," The possible diversity among the Class members in terms of financial resources—for example, a national corporate entity as 
compared to the proprietor of a neighborhood restaurant—and the implications of that diversity was discussed during the 
preliminary approval hearing. In particular, the possibility was raised that a class member with less financial resources might find 
a monetary settlement with Sparboe more beneficial than a class member with greater financial resources. In response, Interim 
Co-Lead Counsel explained that all Class members equally benefit from advancing the entire suit against the remaining 
Defendants which would enable them to obtain the ""aggregate damages"" the Class members would be entitled to, and that, 
indeed, a Class member with less financial resources might obtain greater benefit from Sparboe's cooperation than a larger 
 [**38] producer in this nonmonetary consideration when considered in light of the relative scale of the costs of bringing this suit. 
Prelim. Hr'g Tr. 22:7-22:13."
986,14," The Court may also consider other possibly relevant information as to the adequacy of counsel, such as proposed terms for 
attorneys' fees and nontaxable costs and ""any other matter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the 
interests of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B), (C). "
989,15," For these same reasons, to the extent that consideration of Rule 23(b)(3)(C) is pertinent here, and, for now, without regard to 
the remand mechanisms for an MDL action, it would be preferable to adjudicate these claims in one judicial proceeding and in 
one forum as a class action. See Amalgamated Workers Union of Virgin Islands v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., 478 F.2d 540, 
543, 10 V.I. 575 (3d Cir. 1973) (""The 'superiority requirement' was intended to refer to the preferability of adjudicating claims of 
multiple-parties in one judicial proceeding and in one forum, rather than forcing each plaintiff to proceed by separate suit, and 
possibly requiring a defendant to answer suits growing out of one incident in geographically separated courts.""). See generally 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) note (1966) (""Also pertinent is the question of the desirability of concentrating the trial of the claims in the 
particular forum by means of a class action, in contrast to allowing the claims to be litigated separately in forums to which they 
would ordinarily be brought.""). However, as  [**50] one commentator has discussed, in light of 28 U.S.C. § 1407, as a general 
matter, ""[t]his factor should . . . be of little or no significance in resolving the superiority issue."" Newberg, supra, §4:31. Indeed, 
this factor appears to have limited bearing under the present circumstances because the United States Judicial Panel on 
Multidistrict Litigation previously considered, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the desirability of centralizing the various initially-filed 
direct purchaser class action suits in this particular forum, see In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 588 F. Supp. 2d 1366, 
1367 (J.P.M.L. 2008), and a consolidated class action complaint was filed which superseded all previously-filed direct purchaser 
complaints. "
990,16," As discussed earlier, the Notice of the Sparboe Settlement appears to contain an inadvertent typo as to the end date for the 
Class Period. However, because the actual Class Period was set forth in the Settlement Agreement, which was made available 
for the putative  [**54] Class Members' examination, and because the Notice as disseminated defined the Class broader, rather 
than narrower, than the actual Class definition, the Court does not find the oversight sufficient to have prevented putative class 
members from failing to understand the Settlement Agreement terms or prevent them from opportunity to opt out or object to the 
Agreement. It follows that the Court does not find that the existence of this typo requires additional notice to new class members 
as to the Class Period. "
991,17," The Third Circuit Court of  [**56] Appeals recognizes that ""[g]reat weight is accorded [the] views [of the trial judge] because he 
is exposed to the litigants, and their strategies, positions and proofs. He is aware of the expense and possible legal bars to 
success. Simply stated, he is on the firing line and can evaluate the action accordingly."" Walsh v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea 
Co., Inc., 726 F.2d 956, 965 (3d Cir. 1983) (quoting Ace Heating & Plumbing Co. v. Crane Co., 453 F.2d 30, 34 (3d Cir. 1971))."
991,18," The Manual for Complex Litigation observes that the ""task is demanding because the adversariness  [**57] of litigation is often 
lost after the agreement to settle."" David F. Herr, The Manual for Complex Litigation § 21.61, at 487 (4th ed. 2011). Indeed, the 
observation that ""'[c]ourts applying [a multifactor] test [ ] often recite the litany and engage in pro forma analyses, but their hearts 
are not in it,'"" could be an equally a propos statement for those parties advancing unopposed motions for final settlement 
approval. Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 605 n.10 (3d Cir. 2010) (dissenting, Smith, J.) (quoting Jonathan R. 
Macey & Geoffrey P. Miller, Judicial Review of Class Action Settlements, 1 J. of Legal Analysis 167, 172 (2009)). Here, there is an absence of any objectors or any adversarial challenge to the Motion at bar, which appears to account for the 
dearth of any arguments criticizing, exposing, or meaningfully addressing possible flaws or drawbacks to the settlement 
agreement appearing in the record. Nonetheless, the Court recognizes that although the final settlement approval process may 
have lacked an edgy or adversarial demeanor, this does not necessarily bear on whether the settlement negotiation process was 
adversarial and resulted in a fair, reasonable, and adequate  [**58] settlement. This is because the focus here is on the 
settlement agreement, and ""[w]hether or not there are objectors or opponents to the proposed settlement, the court must make 
an independent analysis of the settlement terms."" Herr, supra, at 488. Furthermore, the Court notes that, in response to the 
Court's inquiries for additional facts and development of the record, Interim Co-Lead Counsel fully and appropriately cooperated 
in the Court's efforts to consider and analyze the proposed settlement. Nonetheless, in the event that any other partial or complete settlements are reached in the future of this case, or in this multi-
district litigation generally, all parties' counsel are well-advised, again, to continue to be responsive and attentive to the Court's 
inquiries as to settlement agreements during the various approval processes, and also to anticipate and be cognizant of what 
appropriate, specific information the Court needs—particularly in light of recent case law developments—in order to perform the 
fact intensive inquiry required for executing its duty to protect absentee class members. After all, the burden lies with the 
movants to demonstrate that the settlement is fair, reasonable,  [**59] and adequate. "
993,19," The Court of Appeals invites individualized analysis by noting that ""[o]ther related factors . . . also may be relevant to this 
inquiry."" Prudential, 148 F. 3d at 323 n.73. "
996,20," Based on this observation, the Court of Appeals has questioned the significance of this factor in ""settlement-only"" class 
actions following the Supreme Court's decision in Amchem. See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321. "
997,21," By contrast, ordinarily, ""[i]n order to assess the reasonableness of a proposed settlement seeking monetary relief, 'the present 
value of the damages plaintiffs would likely recover if  [**80] successful, appropriately discounted for the risk of not prevailing, 
should be compared with the amount of the proposed settlement.'"" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 322. (citing Gen. Motors, 55 F.3d at 
806). "
998,22," The Court does not comment on whether the information and facts that Sparboe may provide would be established, or even 
admissible, at trial, based upon counsel's representations. "
1001,23," ""Class Period"" is defined as ""the period from and including January 1, 2000 up to and including the date when Notice of the 
Court's entry of an order preliminarily approving this settlement and certifying a class for settlement purposes is first published."" 
Thus, the Class Period for the Settlement Agreement is from January 1, 2000 through  [**93] October 23, 2009. "
1004,1," This case was brought in the wake of the 1998 government antitrust enforcement action against Microsoft. That action 
ultimately resulted in a ruling, supported by factual findings made by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, that Microsoft violated § 2 
of the Sherman Act by monopolizing and attempting to monopolize the operating systems market. See United States v. Microsoft 
Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000), aff'd in part, 253 F.3d 34, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Novell's claim that it 
was injured by virtue of Microsoft's monopolization of the operating systems market was tolled while the government action was 
pending because it overlapped with the government's claim  [*4] in that action. Some of Judge Jackson's factual findings in the 
government case have been granted collateral estoppel effect in this action. (See Oct. 4 Court Correspondence, ECF No. 163; 
Trial Tr. at 143-57, 167-97, Oct. 18 & Nov. 14, 2011). In this Opinion, I refer to Judge Jackson's findings as Factual Finding ¶    ."
1004,2," The Fourth Circuit had jurisdiction to review the limitations question because this action had been transferred to the District of 
Maryland for resolution of pretrial issues pursuant to the Multidistrict Litigation Act. See 28 U.S.C. § 1407. I served as the trial 
judge in the action under an intercircuit assignment to the District of Utah, the district in which the case was filed. In the District 
of Maryland pretrial proceedings, the case number for this action was No. 05-cv-1087-JFM. In the District of Utah, its case 
number is No. 2:04-cv-01045-JFM. ECF references in this Opinion are to the Utah docket."
1004,3," I discuss these theories in section V.B. In the government case, Judge Jackson defined ""middleware"" as software that ""relies 
on the interfaces provided by the underlying operating system while simultaneously exposing its own APIs to developers."" 
Finding of Fact ¶ 28.  [*5] The D.C. Circuit accepted this definition, writing that middleware simply refers to ""software products 
that expose their own APIs."" Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 53. The products Novell developed that it alleges constitute middleware are 
PerfectFit (the shared code written into WordPerfect and PerfectOffice), AppWare (which was included in PerfectOffice), and 
OpenDoc."
1004,4," After the jury hung, I interviewed the jurors and permitted counsel to do so as well. It appears undisputed that eleven of the 
twelve jurors would have returned a verdict in favor of Novell on the issue  [*6] of liability. However, in light of what jurors said 
after the trial, it would be entirely speculative to assess the amount of damages the jury would have awarded had it not hung on 
the issue of liability. It might have taken into account in awarding damages not only weaknesses in Novell's damages claim but 
weaknesses in its liability claim as well. In any event, the fact that a majority of the jurors would have returned a verdict of liability 
in favor of Novell does not relieve me of the responsibility to rule on independent claims or on Microsoft's Rule 50(b) motion. See 
Noonan v. Midland Capital Corp., 453 F.2d 459, 463 (2d Cir. 1972) (""If the position of some jurors favoring plaintiff is enough [to 
prevent a judge from granting a Rule 50(b) motion], there could never be a judgment for insufficiency of the evidence 
notwithstanding a verdict.""); Stewart v. Walbridge, Aldinger Co., 882 F. Supp. 1441, 1443 (D. Del. 1995) (""[T]he fact that the jury 
was unable to reach a unanimous verdict does not in any way affect this Court's duty to rule on the [Rule 50(b)] motion.""). "
1005,5," This Opinion does not contain extensive citations to Tenth Circuit antitrust law because I have concluded that the  [*7] facts 
governing my ruling are so case specific that the proper disposition of the Rule 50 motion requires close examination of the 
evidence in this case rather than comparison of this case to others. I note, however, my holding entirely accords with the Tenth 
Circuit's view that, as a general matter, a tough-minded business decision that adversely affects competition does not constitute 
an ipso facto violation of the Sherman Act. See Christy Sports, LLC v. Deer Valley Resort Co., 555 F.3d 1188, 1198 (10th Cir. 
2009)."
1005,6," Windows 95 was launched at a gala event at Microsoft's corporate headquarters. Gary Gibb, who managed the development of 
the  [*8] versions of Novell's office productivity applications for Windows 95, attended the event. He testified that he was 
displeased because he was not invited into the tent where Jay Leno, a television personality, was serving as the master of 
ceremonies. It was apparent to Gibb that Microsoft was using the event to market not only Windows 95 but also Microsoft's own 
office productivity applications, which ran on Windows 95. (Gibb, Trial Tr. at 818, Oct. 26, 2011). Gibb's perception of the event 
reflects that in 1995, Novell was concerned that what Microsoft was attempting to do was to use Windows 95 to increase its 
share of the applications market, not to maintain its monopoly in the operating systems market."
1005,7," At the same time, some executives at Microsoft encouraged developers to write for another operating system, OS/2, rather 
than for Windows. (See Peterson,  [*10] Trial Tr. at 4708, Dec. 7, 2011). Novell relies upon this evidence to infer that Microsoft, 
in pursuit of monopoly power, was talking from both sides of its mouth. "
1006,8," PerfectOffice 3.0 did not achieve a sizeable market share. (See Noll, Trial Tr. at 1915, Nov. 15, 2011). However, this may well 
have been due to the fact that many consumers were not buying new applications during 1994 and the first seven months of 
1995 because they were awaiting the release of Windows 95 and applications written to it. "
1007,9," There is additional evidence that by October 1994 Gates was concerned about competition from Lotus and Novell. For 
example, Gates wrote an email, after watching a demonstration of Novell's new technology at a conference held in Scottsdale, 
Arizona on September 20, 1994, stating that ""Novell [was] a lot more aware of how the world [was] changing than I thought they 
were."" (Pl.'s Ex. 222; see Pl.'s Exs. 17, 31-33, 54, 72, 88, 91, 127, 201). There also was evidence that other executives at 
Microsoft perceived Novell's products to constitute middleware threats to Microsoft's operating system. Brad Silverberg, a senior 
Microsoft executive, wrote in an email dated June 15, 1993 that ""our competitors are going to do everything they can to fragment 
windows, they will build their own middleware to claim api ownership."" (Pl.'s Ex. 54 at MS 0185884). Likewise, John Ludwig of 
Microsoft wrote an internal email in which he stated, inter alia, that ""our worst nightmare is novell/lotus being successful at 
establishing their 'middleware' as a standard.  [*16] [O]urs ought to be ubiquitously available to forestall this. [O]ur huge 
advantage vis-à-vis novell is our end-user franchise, we shouldn't cast aside this advantage."" (Id.; see Pl.'s Exs. 32 at MS 
7079459, 33 at MS 5011635, 44 at MS 7080466-67)."
1007,10," As Novell's counsel acknowledged in closing argument, the Hood Canal plan was never implemented in light of the fact that 
Excel, Word, and Office did not use the functionality provided by the namespace extension APIs. (Trial Tr. at 5324-25, Dec. 13, 
2011). However, Novell contends the Hood Canal plan is relevant in casting light upon the reason for Gates's decision to 
withdraw support for the namespace extension APIs on October 3, 1994. That contention is not unreasonable. "
1008,11," Rietveld, Calkins, Moon, and Mella did not testify at trial. "
1010,12," To repeat, Novell's theory is not that the October 3, 1994 decision had an anticompetitive effect in the applications market in 
violation of § 2. Any claim based  [*29] upon that theory is, as stated above, barred by limitations."
1010,13," Microsoft also makes several arguments to the effect that Novell did not present sufficient evidence of damages. These 
arguments are, however, in large part merely different iterations of other contentions I address in section V. "
1011,14," Some of the facts stated in section I are repeated in sections IV and V in connection with the portions of the legal analysis to 
which they pertain. "
1012,15," Prior to the hearing on the Rule 50 motion, Novell contended that the act of withdrawing support for the namespace extension 
APIs was itself an unlawful act because beta versions of a release cannot be modified except to fix bugs discovered during the 
course of the beta process. However, as I noted in section I, supra, Novell did not press this contention at the Rule 50 hearing, 
and it is unsupported by the evidence."
1012,16," Microsoft  [*37] argues that while deception may give rise to a common law tort, it cannot, as a matter of law, form the basis 
for a Sherman Act claim. Although deception usually sounds in tort, see Restatement (Second) of Torts § 526 (1977) (defining 
fraudulent misrepresentation/deceit), I see no reason it could not also give rise to an antitrust claim if the purpose of the 
deception is to mislead a competitor into taking action (or not taking action) that would substantially change the competitive 
environment. Microsoft distinguishes cases in which deceptive conduct has given rise to antitrust liability on the grounds that 
such cases typically involve deception of third parties, not competitors. See Am. Prof'l Testing Serv., Inc. v. Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich Legal & Prof'l Publ'n, Inc., 108 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir. 1997); Int'l Travel Arrangers, Inc. v. W. Airlines, 623 F.2d 
1255, 1260-63 (8th Cir. 1980). Those cases, however, do not turn on the identity of the party deceived but on whether the 
challenged conduct in fact harmed competition. See Rambus, Inc., v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 522 F.3d 456, 464, 380 U.S. App. 
D.C. 431 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (""Deceptive conduct—like any other kind—must have an anticompetitive effect in order  [*38] to form 
the basis of a monopolization claim. . . . Cases that recognize deception as exclusionary hinge, therefore, on whether the 
conduct impaired rivals in a manner tending to bring about or protect a defendant's monopoly power."")."
1012,17," What the evidence, specifically Gates's email announcing the decision to withdraw support for the namespace extension APIs, 
does suggest is that Microsoft was attempting to buy time for its own office productivity application developers to catch up, so 
that eventually Microsoft could use the enhanced technology created by Windows 95 as effectively (and potentially, by 
integration of the applications and the operating system, more effectively) as its major competitors, including Novell. That, 
however, is quite different from imputing to Microsoft knowledge that Novell needed the namespace extension APIs to develop 
its own applications. Of course, in fact, as the evidence  [*40] established, Novell could have used Microsoft's common file open 
dialog, which remained available to it after support for the namespace extension APIs was withdrawn, to develop its applications. "
1013,," According to Novell, those programs simply would not be as good as they could have been if Microsoft had continued to make 
its own technology available to Novell."
1013,18," Novell argues that Microsoft's willingness to sacrifice the short-term profits it would have earned from increased sales of 
Windows 95 to customers who would buy the operating system if it ran Novell's applications constituted a classic hallmark of 
anticompetitive behavior because monopolists are assumed to be rational, and the sacrifice of short-term profits can be 
explained only by the desire to reap long-term gains by maintaining the monopoly. See,  [*43] e.g., Reazin v. Blue Cross & Blue 
Shield of Kan., Inc., 635 F. Supp. 1287, 1309 (D. Kan. 1986), aff'd, 899 F.2d 951 (10th Cir. 1990). The flaw in this argument is 
that there is no evidence that Microsoft sacrificed any short-term profits by withdrawing support for the namespace extension 
APIs. Novell's own theory is that support for the APIs were withdrawn to prevent a decline of sales of Microsoft's office 
productivity programs (Word, Excel, and Office) because Novell and Lotus would have been able to put products superior to "
1014,," them on the market if support for the namespace extension APIs had not been withdrawn. Thus, assuming that Microsoft's 
revenues from the sale of Windows 95 might have slightly declined because a limited number of purchasers would not buy 
Windows 95 unless there were Novell applications made for Windows 95, there is no basis for inferring that the decline of 
revenues would not have been more than offset by an increase of revenues in the sales of Word, Excel, and Office. I recognize that this conclusion may appear somewhat disturbing because arguably it rewards Microsoft for unsavory behavior in 
the applications market. Nevertheless, the reasoning is sound. Although  [*44] the proposition upon which Novell relies makes 
eminent sense as a matter of theory, it is based upon a factual inference about how a rational actor would behave, and here the 
evidence does not support the inference. Moreover, Novell has only itself to blame for the quandary in which it finds itself 
because it was its own delay in filing this action that resulted in its claims in the applications market being barred by limitations. 
See Novell, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11520, 2005 WL 1398643, at *5."
1014,19," Although I accept this assumption, it is problematic. While the evidence is undisputed that historically WordPerfect had been 
cross-platformed to various operating systems, (see Harral, Trial Tr. at 216, Oct. 20, 2011; Gibb, Trial Tr. at 776-77, 781, Oct. 
26, 2011; Frankenberg, Trial Tr. at 994-97, Nov. 7, 2011), this is not an instance in which it can reasonably be said that the past 
is a prologue of the future, particularly in light of the technological breakthrough that Novell acknowledges Windows 95 achieved. 
Likewise, although Harral and Gibb testified that looking into the future Novell intended to make the PerfectOffice suite cross-
platform after the initial release of PerfectOffice for Windows 95, (Harral, Trial Tr. at 371, Oct. 24, 2011;  [*46] Gibb, Trial Tr. at 
787, Oct. 26, 2011), mere intent and aspiration do not provide sufficient evidence that, in fact, Novell's applications would have 
been cross-platform. Moreover, although one of Novell's experts testified that Linux ""became a full-fledged, commercial product"" 
in 1996, (Noll, Trial Tr. at 1961, Nov. 15, 2011), the version of WordPerfect for Linux that Corel released in the spring of 1996 
was an older version of WordPerfect that did not contain the same shared code as the version of WordPerfect developed for 
Windows 95. (Murphy, Trial Tr. at 4914-16, Dec. 8, 2011). As such, it was inferior to the WordPerfect application that ran on 
Windows 95. (Id.). "
1015,20," According to Microsoft expert Kevin Murphy, these market share numbers must be further reduced by approximately 50% 
because office suites or any of their component applications were installed on only one-half of all PCs. (Murphy, Trial Tr. at 
4750, Dec. 7, 2011)."
1015,21," Novell's reliance upon the DOS installed  [*51] base also raises a significant question as to whether Novell assigned the 
claims asserted in this action to Caldera, Inc. when it sold its DOS business to Caldera. In the Asset Purchase Agreement it 
made with Caldera, Novell transferred ""all of Novell's right, title, and interest in and to any and all claims or causes of action held 
by Novell at the Closing Date and associated directly or indirectly with any of the DOS Products or Related Technology."" (See 
Asset Purchase Agreement, Holley Decl. Supp. Microsoft Mem., Ex. P, at 4-5, ECF No. 495-16). I previously ruled that this 
assignment encompassed the operating systems monopoly claim asserted in this action because the claim asserted here arose 
in the operating systems market in which DOS had competed. See In re Microsoft Corp. Antitrust Litig., 699 F. Supp. 2d 730, 
739 (D. Md. 2010). The Fourth Circuit reversed my ruling. See Novell, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 419 Fed. Ap'x. 254, 261 (4th Cir. 
2011). I remain bound by that decision. If the Tenth Circuit finds resolution of the issue to be necessary to its decision on 
Microsoft's Rule 50 motion, however, it may conclude that the law of the case doctrine does not apply and that it may 
 [*52] revisit the Fourth Circuit's ruling because the evidence presented at trial is more extensive than was the evidence in the 
summary judgment record upon which the Fourth Circuit relied. Specifically, the Tenth Circuit might decide that because, as the 
record now reflects, Novell's claim depends in large part upon the conversion of its share of the DOS installed base into a "
1016,," significant share of the Windows market, that claim is ""associated directly or indirectly with . . . the DOS Product or Related 
Technology"" and thus was transferred to Caldera."
1016,22," The barrier to entry issue was eloquently described, from a business point of view, in an email sent on August 17, 1997, by 
Jeff Raikes, then a Microsoft executive, to Warren Buffett. (Pl.'s Ex. 360 at MS-PCA 1301176). In the email, Raikes wrote of the 
importance of ""widen[ing] the moat,"" i.e. increasing the barrier to entry, by tying together Microsoft's applications  [*56] and "
1017,," Windows. I admitted the email into evidence despite the fact that it was not written until after the events that gave rise to this 
action on the ground that the jury might find it reflected the views of Microsoft's executives during the relevant time period. Novell referred to the email at trial and has likewise referred to it in opposing Microsoft's Rule 50 motion. In the event that the 
Tenth Circuit reverses my ruling that Microsoft's Rule 50 motion should be granted, it would be helpful in the retrial of this case if 
the Tenth Circuit were to decide whether the Raikes email was properly admitted. It would also be helpful, in the event of a 
reversal of my Rule 50 ruling, if the Tenth Circuit resolved a disagreement between the parties as to the proper causation 
standard. Microsoft contends that the standard that should be applied is whether its decision to withdraw support for the 
namespace extension APIs ""contributed significantly to its continued monopoly power."" (Microsoft Mem. at 82). Conversely, 
Novell contends that the appropriate standard is whether Microsoft's decision was ""reasonably capable of contributing 
significantly"" to Microsoft's monopoly power. (Novell Opp'n at  [*57] 94-95). In reaching my decision, I have not found it 
necessary to resolve this issue."
1017,23," This statement is not meant as an unfavorable observation about Novell's counsel. They have skillfully and energetically 
pursued a claim that I have concluded is not supported by the evidence.  [*59] It is not, however, frivolous. Likewise, my 
statement is not intended to reflect badly upon Novell. The evidence presented at trial showed that Novell simply did not believe 
the deadline of bringing applications to market within 90 days of the release of Windows 95—a deadline that was dictated solely 
by marketing considerations—was material to the success of Novell's applications. The tradition and culture at WordPerfect had 
been to develop better products than WordPerfect's competitors, and to depend upon the high quality of those products to 
achieve market success. Therefore, it is not surprising that Gibb, Harral, and Richardson— who had been employed by 
WordPerfect prior to its sale to Novell—would have been primarily concerned about delivering the best software applications 
they could write, even if that entailed some delay. Unfortunately, economic realities, including cost-cutting measures Novell felt 
compelled to take, were collapsing the world to which they had been accustomed and were destroying Novell's ability to provide 
hand-tailored products and services to its customers. (Frankenberg, Trial Tr. at 1097-98, Nov. 7, 2011; Bushman, Trial Tr. at 
3161-62, Nov. 28, 2011; Acheson,  [*60] Trial Tr. at 3968, 3972, Dec. 2, 2011; LeFevre, Trial Tr. at 4024-26, Dec. 2, 2011; Def.'s

1018,24," Gibb's testimony that Quattro Pro was code complete in time for Quattro Pro and PerfectOffice to be released on schedule is

1024,1," At oral argument on July 10, 2012, counsel for Weisheng confirmed the Court's understanding in the following exchange: THE COURT: The only thing I didn't understand is whether you are contending that the summons was not properly served. MR. MASON: No. "
1029,2," Although defendants do not cite this case, United Elec., Radio & Mach. Workers of Am. v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 
1080 (1st Cir. 1992), suggests that the corporate form may not be disregarded, for the purposes of a ""minimum contacts"" 
analysis, absent a finding of fraudulent intent on the parent's behalf. But this case involved an ERISA plan, and the Court 
carefully and repeatedly noted that its analysis was tied to the particularities of this statute. Courts within the First Circuit 
therefore have not adhered to this requirement outside the context of ERISA. "

1038,1," Although these cases involve the filed-rate doctrine's antitrust implications, the doctrine also applies when rate-payers 
challenge the rate they have been charged. In that situation, the filed-rate doctrine protects the company. The doctrine requires 
that the company charge only the rate it filed, prevents it from charging any other rate, and bars private suits based on the 
properly filed and duly approved rates. See, e.g., In re Investigation of Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co., 66 Ohio St. 3d 81, 1993 Ohio 
184, 609 N.E.2d 156 (Ohio 1993)."
1038,2," Title insurance is ""[a]n agreement to indemnify against loss arising from a defect in title to real property."" BLACK'S LAW 
DICTIONARY 819 (8th ed. 2004)."
1038,3, Title XXXIX prohibits such inducements. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3953.26. 
1040,4," Appellants also cite United States v. Title Ins. Rating Bureau of Arizona, 700 F.2d 1247 (9th Cir. 1983), and In re Ticor Title Ins. 
Co., 112 F.T.C. 344, 1989 WL 1126786 (F.T.C. 1989). These cases, however, are irrelevant. Rating Bureau of Arizona 
addressed escrow services, and In re Ticor involved  [**14] title search and examination charges. In both cases, the court held 
that the service provided was not the business of insurance. Neither case, however, involved rate-making, a central component 
of insurance and insurance regulation. "
1043,5," Section 1.54 replaced § 1.24. It provides: ""A statute which is reenacted or amended is intended to be a continuation of the prior 
statute and not a new enactment, so far as it is the same as the prior statute."" Ohio Rev. Code § 1.54. "
1044,6," The filed-rate doctrine can also bar injunctive relief, if the injunction that plaintiffs seek is no more than a request for a different 
rate-making decision, Dolan, 365 F. App'x. at 276, or if the injunction would force the court to alter an existing rate. The filed-rate 
doctrine applies in this scenario because it is designed ""to protect the exclusive authority of the agency to accept or challenge 
[rates]."" Town of Norwood, Mass. v. New England Power Co., 202 F.3d 408, 420 (1st Cir. 2000) (Boudin, J.)."
1044,7," Appellants concede there is no boycott, coercion, or intimidation here."
1044,8," The district  [**29] court's opinion illustrates why it is preferable to address antitrust immunity before the filed-rate doctrine. The 
opinion below offers a thorough discussion of the filed-rate doctrine, culminating in a holding that Appellants' damages claims 
had to be dismissed, but their injunctive claims might be permissible, as long as those claims did not interfere with established 
rates. Later, however, the district court dismissed Appellants' claims with prejudice because ""the McCarran-Ferguson Act is a "
1045,," complete bar to Plaintiffs' federal antitrust claim . . . [and] [t]he same logic holds true for Plaintiffs' Valentine Act claim."" Allowing 
Appellants to re-plead either cause of action, it wrote, would ""be an exercise in futility."" This is true. But it also means that the 
court's discussion of the filed-rate doctrine was unnecessary: the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the Ohio Insurance Code barred 
the suit wholesale. "
1048,1," 15 U.S.C. § 1. Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; penalty Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the 
several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . ."
1048,2," 15 U.S.C. § 2. Monopolizing trade a felony; penalty Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony . . . "
1049,3," In its Opposition Brief, High Tek attempts to explain why it believes that Ishida parts is the relevant market. For example, it 
argues that Ishida equipment is the ""premium brand,"" the ""gold standard"" of weighing and packaging equipment, that Ishida 
equipment is utilized by a majority of manufacturers and distributors of packaging equipment. Facts not alleged in the Complaint 
will not prevent dismissal for failure to state a claim. Without deciding whether these additional facts are sufficient to state a 
Section 2 Sherman Act claim, the Court will permit High Tek to amend its Complaint to allege additional facts."
1049,4," The term ""monopolize,"" as used in the federal antitrust laws, means the power either to obtain, or to maintain, the power to 
remove or exclude competitors from the field of competition in a particular business or industry. Since H&C is the exclusive 
distributor of Ishida parts, H&C maintains its so-called monopoly power to purchase Ishida parts because of H&C's contract with 
Ishida to be the exclusive North American distributor for Ishida parts, not because of any of the alleged anticompetitive behavior. 
Additionally, High Tek's theory, that because it is a competitor that has been harmed, that H&C has harmed competition does 
not state a claim under the antitrust laws. ""[T]he plaintiff here must allege and prove harm, not just to a single competitor, but to 
the competitive process, i.e., to competition itself."" NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 135, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 
2d 510 (1998). "
1050,5," H&C relies on the Restatement of Torts to insinuate that it may interfere with High Tek's contracts with impunity so long as the 
contracts are terminable at-will. See H&C's Br. 17 (""because [the Complaint] concerns a matter involving competition between 
High Tek and H&C, High Tek has no [tortious interference] claim as to its [at-will] contracts""). The Restatement provides that 
competition does not justify inducing breach of contract where the contract is not terminable at-will. See Restatement (Second) 
of Torts § 768, comm. subs. 2 (1979). This does not mean,  [*16] as Defendant appears to argue, that interference with an at-will 
contract is always justified by competition. See H&C's Br. 17. The ""competition as justification"" defense rests solely on the notion that when a contract is terminable at-will, there is only an 
expectancy of a continuing contractual relationship and therefore, the termination of contractual relations interferes with future 
relations for which the plaintiff has no legal assurance. Thus, a defendant may plead, as an affirmative defense, that competition 
justified its acts in inducing breach. On the other hand, when the contract is not terminable at-will, there is greater definiteness of 
the legal relationship and the defendant is not justified by the mere fact of competition to induce a breach. Accordingly, 
competition is not a defense to an intentional interference claim where the contract is for a specific term."
1050,6," Notably, the first line of the opinion on which Defendant itself relied at oral argument (and which is cited in its briefs) provides 
that: ""The competition privilege is an affirmative defense to the tort of interference with prospective economic advantage."" San 
Francisco Design Ctr. Associates v. Portman Companies, 41 Cal. App. 4th 29, 50 Cal. Rptr. 2d 716 (Cal. Ct. App. 1995) 
 [*17] (emphasis added.) "
1051,7," In its Reply brief H&C raises the issue that High Tek has not sufficiently specified the parties with whose relationships H&C has 
interfered. Reply Br. 13. The Court will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a reply memorandum because 
Plaintiff did not have an opportunity to address this issue. "
1056,1, The Court denied Plaintiffs' motion to certify a subclass. 
1059,2," The NAR guideline cited by Plaintiffs states that ""A broker who participates in the affairs of an association of Realtors should be 
alert to discussions at an association meeting relating to commission levels, pricing structures, or marketing practices of other 
brokers."" Ann McDonald Deposition, DN 656-15 at p. 20. "
1064,3," Plaintiffs maintain that full commission rates between 5% and 7% are consistent with the alleged conspiracy. Defendants 
charged a full commission rate of exactly 7% in 7.21% of their transactions, as agents were encouraged to obtain full 
commissions higher than the minimum acceptable commission of 6%. Defendants charged exactly 5% in 12.76% of their 
transactions during the Class Period. According to Plaintiffs and Dr. Yavas, ""one explanation for a 5% commission is the offer of 
a volume discount off of the 6% standard to a customer who is selling one residence and buying another, and who retains the 
agent as the listing agent for the residence to be sold and also as the buyer's agent on the residence to be purchased."" DN 654 
at p. 32-33. Additionally, other discounts may be offered or commissions foregone altogether when agents are buying or selling 
property for themselves. Also, in some situations, a broker will authorize payment for a repair or improvement of a property by an 
agent if such a cost is preventing the transaction from closing. Id. Dr. Yavas has also presented several reasons for commission 
rate variations such as policies allowing for friends and relatives to obtain services at reduced commission and savvy home 
sellers who ask the listing agent to reduce the commission if a buyer comes straight to the firm. However, Plaintiffs maintain that, 
if the standard were lower, the discounted rate would likewise be lower. "
1067,4, The Court assumes Plaintiffs are referring to the federally mandated HUD-1 disclosure forms.
1067,5," Plaintiffs cite to an email from Brad DeVries to Rhonda Benavidez, which states: ""We are also looking at the HUD statements 
for the closings we have on our competitors listings. We are calculating the amount we get, plus the amount they keep, and then 
coming up with a total. We think that will give us the answer we are looking for (or at least part of it)."" DeVries Deposition, DN 
654-11 at p. 24. "
1070,6," In addition to arguing that the comments made at the public hearing do not amount to an illegal agreement, Defendants also 
argue that the comments made at the public hearing are not admissible pursuant to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which 
""allows businesses to combine and lobby to influence the legislative, executive, or judicial branches of government or 
administrative agencies without antitrust or § 1983 liability, because the First Amendment's right of petition protects such "
1071,," activities."" Knology, Inc. v. Insight Communs. Co., L.P., 393 F.3d 656, 658 (6th Cir. 2004). Plaintiffs maintain that Mr. McMahan's 
and Mr. Myer's comments should be considered by this Court by arguing that the ""sham"" exception to the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine is applicable. ""Such a 'sham' situation involves a defendant whose activities are not genuinely aimed at procuring 
favorable government action at all, not one who genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental result, but does so through 
improper means."" Id. at 658-59 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, because the Court finds that the Plaintiffs' reading 
of the Holiday Inn transcript is unreasonable, the Court need not determine that applicability of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. "
1077,1," Although the record does not specifically describe the duties of a physician on trauma call, we infer that the duties are distinct 
from performing trauma surgery."
1077,2, All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise specified. 
1080,3," Racek argues that the Hospital and its alleged coconspirators engaged in a ""group boycott"" of general surgeons or a 
""horizontal restraint,"" which under relevant case law constitute per se unreasonable restraints on trade and therefore relieve the 
court from having to apply a rule of reason analysis to  [*16] determining whether Racek identified an unreasonable restraint of 
trade in the relevant market. We disagree. First, Racek has not identified a horizontal restraint, which involves ""entities at the 
same level combining to deny a competitor at their level the benefits enjoyed by the members of the group."" (Freeman v. San 
Diego Assn. of Realtors (1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 171, 195, fn. 26, 91 Cal. Rptr. 2d 534.) The Hospital is not at the same level of 
market structure as Racek because it does not compete with him as a surgeon. Second, the type of ""group boycott"" that 
constitutes a per se unreasonable restraint of trade arises when there is an effort ""to disadvantage competitors by 'either directly 
denying or persuading or coercing suppliers or customers to deny relationships the competitors need in the competitive struggle.' 
. . . In these cases, the boycott often cut off access to a supply, facility, or market necessary to enable the boycotted firm to 
compete."" (Northwest Stationers v. Pacific Stationery (1985) 472 U.S. 284, 293-294, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202, citations 
omitted.) That is not the situation described by the complaint. Instead, as we have explained, this case involves a hospital's 
internal staffing decisions, and case law  [*17] invariably analyzes antitrust challenges to such staffing decisions under a rule of 
reason analysis rather than finding them to constitute a per se unreasonable restraint on trade. (BCB Anesthesia, supra, 36 F.3d 
at p. 667.) "
1081,4," Racek contends that he has identified ""serious anti-competitive injury in that the Hospital's acts have resulted in substandard 
care being offered to the patients of the only designated pediatric trauma center in San Diego County."" He is apparently referring 
to the complaint's allegation that due to the Hospital's purported policy of giving preference to pediatric surgeons for all surgeries 
and only allowing pediatric surgeons to be on general surgery call duty, surgeries are not scheduled as soon as they would be if 
general surgeons were allowed to operate. The problem with this argument is that an antitrust claim requires an injury to 
competition in the market, and the alleged provisions of substandard care is not an injury to the competitiveness of the 
marketplace. "
1083,5," This statement is consistent with Racek's complaint, which states that ""[s]tarting in or about October 2006, and continuing to 
the present, [the Hospital] breached the oral agreement"" by failing to assign him to the shift promised by LoSasso. It is also 
consistent with the statement in Racek's declaration that ""in October 2006, Dr. Hilfiker announced that she would give 
preference to pediatric surgeons for primary trauma call shifts,"" and that according to his review of data beginning in the Fall of 
2006, his primary call shifts ""decreased to 2.5 to 5 per month,"" and his back-up call shifts increased to approximately 11 per 
month. "
1085,6," In addressing the quantum meruit cause of action in his appellate briefing Racek argues that under the  [*35] terms of his 
written agreement with the Hospital, he should have been compensated at the rate applicable to primary call shifts whenever he 
was on back-up call duty and called to perform the duties of a physician on primary call. However, that argument describes a 
claim for breach of contract, not a claim for quantum meruit, which, as we have explained, cannot exist when an express 
contract covers the same subject matter. We have seen no indication in the record that Racek intends to assert a cause of 
action against the Hospital for breach of his written contract; he has chosen to proceed under a theory of quantum meruit. "
1093,1," In Bonner v. Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
1094,2," nFinanSe does allege that InComm told nFinanSe executives at a business meeting in 2011 that ""NetSpend, American 
Express, Western Union, and MoneyGram had 'all signed' onto InComm's . . . Network with a fixed reload price of $3.95. 
(Compl. ¶ 103. However, even if this pleading is accepted as true, there is no indication that the same conversation occurred 
between InComm and NetSpend or between InComm and PayPal, or that these businesses proceeded as groups based on the 
understanding that otherwise there would be ""a substantial loss of the business and good will."" Interstate Circuit, 306 U.S. at 
222. "
1095,3," nFinanSe also claims ""[a]s further evidence of the Visa Amendment . . . [that], in late 2010, InComm charged and collected 
from nFinanSe $65,000 for warehouse security upgrades that InComm told nFinanSe were required by Visa."" (Compl. ¶ 39.) 
Such evidence is of no consequence: security upgrades required by Visa were necessary because InComm was distributing 
nFinanSe's Visa cards on a case-by-case basis, not because InComm had agreed to distribute the cards on the same terms as 
the Discover Contract. "

1107,6," ""In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the 
basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be 'grounded in fraud' or to 'sound in fraud,' and the pleading of that claim as a 
whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)."" Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103-1104. "

1120,4," See 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a) (""No State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress

law, was amended in 2011. See Act of Sept. 16, 2011, § 19(a), 125 Stat. 331. The prior version of the statute provided: ""The 
district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents . . . . Such 
jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent . . . cases."" Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, 62 Stat. 931."
1120,5," The Supreme Court specifically disavowed a broad interpretation of its holding such that ""all legal malpractice suits arising out

355 S.W.3d 634, 646 (Tex. 2011), petition for cert. filed, No. 11-1118 (U.S. Mar. 9, 2012). The Court indicated that  [**8] ""any 
state litigant asserting a legal malpractice action to recover for damages resulting from his patent attorney's negligence in patent 
prosecution or litigation must also satisfy all four elements of the Grable test to place his claim under exclusive federal 
jurisdiction."" Id."
1120,6," The relators filed a motion in the trial court to stay proceedings pending our resolution of the mandamus petition, and in that 
context the parties disputed the significance of our request for a response to the relators' petition. Mandamus relief (other than 
temporary relief) cannot be granted unless the court receives or requests a response. TEX. R. APP. P. 52.4.  [**9] But regardless 
of whether the court has preliminarily decided that a petition may be meritorious, a response often aids the efficient use of 
judicial resources by inviting the real party in interest to offer its own legal analysis and perspective of the challenged action. 
Accordingly, the mere request for a response does not imply any preliminary judgment about the merits of the petition. Rule 52.8 
does not suggest otherwise—that rule provides that ""[i]f the court is of the tentative opinion that relator is entitled to the relief 
sought or that a serious question concerning the relief requires further consideration . . . the court must request a response if 
one has not been filed."" TEX. R. APP. P. 52.8(b)(1) (emphasis supplied). "

patent law for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a). See id. at 1267. Because the Federal Circuit agreed that federal jurisdiction 
could be exercised pursuant to § 1338(a), the district court's refusal to remand the case was affirmed. See id. at 1273; see also 
28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) (""If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the

1123,15," All of the case law provided to us by the relators involved or otherwise made specific reference to federal antitrust causes of 
action. See Tafflin, 493 U.S. at 462, 110 S. Ct. at 796-97 (in context  [**21] of holding that state courts have concurrent

that ""[a]lthough federal antitrust claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts [citing General Investment], the 
Court of Appeals ruled that the dismissal of petitioners' complaints in state court barred them from bringing a claim based on the 
same facts under the Sherman Act""); Hathorn v. Lovorn, 457 U.S. 255, 266 n.18, 102 S. Ct. 2421, 2429 n.18, 72 L. Ed. 2d 824

matter limited by federal law, for which recovery can be had only in the federal courts""). "
1124,16," The relators' petition focuses on the Grable test and its consideration of whether the exercise of federal jurisdiction over an 
overlying state-law claim would disturb ""any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities."" 
Grable, 545 U.S. at 314, 125 S. Ct. 2368; Minton, 355 S.W.3d at 640. Accordingly, their arguments are oriented towards 
justifying the federal interest in adjudicating the claim. The more appropriate question is whether state courts may exercise their 
presumed concurrent jurisdiction without offending some federal interest."
1124,17," See,  [**23] e.g., Am. Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l Football League, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 2212, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010); Leegin Creative

common-law right to recover antitrust fine from employees whose conduct occasioned the fine)."
1124,19," We also note that a conclusion that federal courts have exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction over this malpractice claim would 
be diametrically opposed to the prior ruling in this same dispute that ""federal question jurisdiction does not exist in this case, and 
removal was not proper on this basis."" Rx.com, Inc. v. O'Quinn, 766 F. Supp. 2d 790, 793, 797 (S.D. Tex. 2011). If we granted 
the relief sought by the relators, the real parties in interest would face the circumstance of having to re-file their claims in federal 
district court after one federal district judge has already ruled that there is no federal subject-matter jurisdiction over the claim. A 
federal court—perhaps even the same federal district judge—might then be forced to either exercise jurisdiction  [**25] or 
effectively leave the real parties judicially homeless, shunned by both state and federal courts refusing to exercise jurisdiction to 
resolve their claims on the merits. Such ""jurisdictional ping-pong"" is undesirable due to its tendency to ""undermine public 
confidence in our judiciary"" and ""squander private and public resources."" Christianson, 486 U.S. at 818-19, 108 S. Ct. at 2179. "
1125,1," RX.com, Inc. v. O'Quinn, 766 F. Supp. 2d 790, 795-97 (S.D. Tex. 2011). "
1127,2," In Minton, there was a factual dispute regarding the applicability of the experimental use exception to the on-sale bar to 
patentability of the invention. The court of appeals' opinion reveals that there was also, however, a legal dispute. Minton v. 
Gunn, 301 S.W.3d 702, 709 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2010), rev'd on other grounds, 355 S.W.3d 634 (Tex. 2011) (noting that 
dispute was ""predominately one of fact""). In the court of appeals, the parties disagreed on the standard that applies for 
determining when testing is sufficient to constitute an experimental use. The plaintiff contended that ""experimental use is 
supported by any testing needed to convince the inventor that the invention is capable of performing its intended purpose in its 
intended environment."" Id. at 712 n. 46. The court of appeals disagreed and held that the testing must relate to a claimed feature 
of the patented invention. Applying this standard, the court of appeals concluded that the testing evidence offered by the inventor 
did ""not, as a matter of  [**34] law, support experimental use."" Id. at 712. Because the court of appeals affirmed a no-evidence 
summary judgment on this basis, the disputed legal issue was critical to the ultimate issue in the case. In contrast, in this case, 
there is no evidence of a significant, disputed legal issue in the plea to the jurisdiction."
1127,3," To the extent relators rely on expert reports they provided this Court after oral argument, we may not consider evidence not 
before the trial court at the time of the plea to the jurisdiction hearing. See In re Taylor, 113 S.W.3d 385, 392 (Tex. App.—
Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, orig. proceeding) (stating that, in mandamus proceedings, we ""focus on the record that was before the 
trial court"" and exclude from our consideration filings ""that were not part of the trial court record at the time of the hearing on the 
motion that is the subject of the original proceeding.""). Even if I  [**36] were to consider these reports, it is still not clear to me 
that there is a substantial federal question; relators' motion for summary judgment (which real-party plaintiffs filed after oral 
argument and was also filed after the ruling on the plea to the jurisdiction) is not based on any arguments under the Sherman 
Act."
1127,4," Real-party plaintiffs contend that we cannot consider this evidence under the well-pleaded complaint rule, a federal standard 
that limits subject-matter-jurisdiction inquiries to the face of the plaintiff's complaint. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Constr. 
Laborers Vacation Trust for S. Cal., 463 U.S. 1, 10, 103 S. Ct. 2841, 2847, 77 L. Ed. 2d 420 (1983) (""the plaintiff's complaint 
establishes that the case 'arises under' federal law""). Arguably, the inquiry here could be governed by the Texas procedure that 
permits challenges to the existence of jurisdictional facts in a plea to the jurisdiction. See Tex. Dep't of Parks & Wildlife v. 
Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226-27 (Tex. 2004). Because the documents on which relators rely do not demonstrate a substantial, 
disputed federal issue, I need not decide this issue. "
1129,5," This requirement, known as the centrality requirement, addresses whether the plaintiff's claim is ""federal enough"" to justify invocation of federal question jurisdiction. Centrality 
asks how much—an assessment ill-suited to a cut-and-dried rule. It calls for a standard that . . . tends to collapse 
decisionmaking back into the direct application of the background principle or policy to a fact situation. Standards allow for 
the decrease of errors of under- and over-inclusiveness by giving the decisionmaker more discretion than do rules. 
Standards allow the decisionmaker  [**42] to take into account all relevant factors or the totality of the circumstances. We 
should not be surprised or disappointed, then, if the centrality inquiry does not always yield litmus-like answers. The nature 
of the inquiry requires nuance and balancing. Richard D. Freer, Of Rules and Standards: Reconciling Statutory Limitations on ""Arising Under"" Jurisdiction, 82 Ind. L.J. 309, 
320 (2007). "
1135,1," This section contains citations to the file histories of Dyson's patents. These file histories are thousands of pages long, and the 
Court granted leave for Dyson to file them as PDFs on a CD-ROM, rather than on CM/ECF. Given that, the Court cannot cite to 
the file histories using a CM/ECF document and page number. In addition, although each patent's file history is contained within 
its own PDF, none of these PDFs is consecutively paginated from beginning to end (e.g., with Bates numbers). Citations are 
therefore formatted as in this example, ""FH449 at 19"" — where ""FH"" represents ""file history""; ""449"" is the last three digits of the 
patent number (in this case, U.S. Patent No. 7,931,449); and ""19"" represents the nineteenth page in the PDF submitted on CD-
ROM, regardless of whether that page displays some other page number. "
1137,2," At the preliminary injunction hearing, it became clear that Dyson began selling bladeless fans in the United States in March 
2010, rather than October 2009. The difference is immaterial for present purposes. "
1140,3," See Part V.B, infra. "
1141,4," Therasense discusses inequitable conduct, which — before Therasense — operated on a similar but looser standard than 
Walker Process fraud. Therasense, however, raised inequitable conduct to match the standard for Walker  [**31] Process claims 
based on omissions. See George G. Gordon & Stephen A. Stack, Aligning Antitrust and Patent Law: Side Effects from the 
Federal Circuit's Cure for the Inequitable Conduct ""Plague"" in Therasense, 26 Antitrust 88, 88-90 (Fall 2011). "
1143,5," This disposition moots  [**37] any consideration of Dyson's argument that Cornucopia's Walker Process claim does not meet 
Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard. "
1144,6," This disposition moots any consideration of the parties' arguments about the relevant antitrust market and applies equally to 
Cornucopia's state-law antitrust claim (Count III). ""Arizona antitrust law is interpreted in accordance with federal law."" Cal. E. 
Labs., Inc. v. Gould, 896 F.2d 400, 403 (9th Cir. 1990); Brooks Fiber Commc'ns v. GST Tucson Lightwave, Inc., 992 F. Supp. 
1124, 1130 (D. Ariz. 1997). "
1150,1," More detailed facts specific to each moving defendant are set forth below. Additionally, a fuller statement of facts relating 
 [*6] to non-moving defendants is contained in the Court's December 2, 2011 Order. See Dkt. 159, at 21-23. "
1151,2," The Court has some concern about the continued vitality of the liberal amendment policy adopted in Harris v. Amgen, based as 
it is on language in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957), suggesting that ""a complaint 
should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in 
support of his claim. . .."" Given Twombly and Iqbal's rejection of the liberal pleading standards adopted by Conley, it is uncertain 
whether the language in Harris v. Amgen has much of a life expectancy. "
1152,3," Throughout this decision, IPC refers to the indirect purchasers' Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (Dkt. 
164). DPC refers to the direct purchasers' Second Amended Class Action Complaint (Dkt. 163)."
1152,4," The parties dispute whether Potandon owns packing sheds. See, e.g., Potandon Reply, Dkt. 214, at 6-7; Indirect Purchaser 
Opp., Dkt. 206, at 13-14. For purposes of resolving this motion, the Court will accept as true the allegation that Potandon has its 
""own packing sheds."" See IPC ¶ 226 (quoted above); DPC ¶ 99 (alleging Potandon supracompetitively raised prices ""both in its 
own sheds and through its growers' sheds."") (emphasis added). "
1153,5," Additionally, in responding to this round of motions, plaintiffs do not appear to rely on a single-entity theory of liability. The Court 
will therefore not address that issue. "
1154,6," The direct purchasers' new allegations regarding  [*23] United II are more extensive than the indirect purchasers'. The indirect 
purchasers basically just add United II's statement of corporate purpose, along with an allegation showing that United II's board 
is populated with numerous UPGI members. United II argues that both new complaints are deficient, but does not directly argue 
that if the direct purchasers' complaint survives, the indirect purchasers' complaint should not. See, e.g., United II Reply, at 3 n.5 
(noting that the direct purchaser complaint is more extensive than the ""minimal allegations made by the indirect purchaser 
plaintiffs""). Regardless, however, even the indirect purchasers' minimal new allegations are just enough to nudge their claim 
against United II across the line from ""possible"" to ""plausible."" "
1157,7," The indirect purchasers do not use the term ""instrumentality"" in describing Idahoan (and this term comes from the Supreme 
Court's decision in American Needle, which will be discussed). But, like the direct purchasers, they allege evidentiary facts 
supporting a conclusion that Idahoan was an instrumentality of its owners. See, e.g., IPC ¶¶ 130-49, 299, 329-36. "
1158,8," Idahoan points out that in its earlier order, the Court stated that it would not disregard the separate corporate form of another 
defendant - Potandon. See Dec. 2, 2011 Order, Dkt. 159, at 45 (""Potandon - a separate corporate entity - cannot be implicated 
in the conspiracy based solely on the fact that one of its owners was an alleged conspirator."") (citing In re Ins. Brokerage 
Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d at 341 n.44). But the defendants are distinguishable because plaintiffs did not plausibly allege that 
Potandon was created and operated as an instrumentality of the conspiracy. "
1164,1," Plaintiffs filed suit against Wellmark, Inc. d/b/a Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa and Wellmark Health Plan of 
Iowa, Inc., which is the Health Maintenance Organization of Wellmark, Inc. The defendants will be collectively referred to as 
Wellmark. "
1165,2," The chiropractic profession has special significance to this state: Chiropractic was founded in Iowa in 1895 by D.D. Palmer, a Canadian immigrant. Palmer was a practitioner of magnetic 
healing; he had no formal medical training but was well read in both anatomy and physiology. He devoted a great deal of 
time to the study of the spine and eventually concluded that all disease was the result of abnormal spinal function. Palmer 
performed his first adjustment in 1895. Subsequent to his initial successes, Palmer's popularity increased and in 1896 he 
founded the first school of chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa, now known as the Palmer College of [C]hiropractic. One of 
Palmer's first patients gave the profession its name by combining the Greek words ""chiro"" (hand) and ""praktikos"" 
 [**5] (done by). . . . . In 1906 Palmer's son, B.J. Palmer, took over the school and is credited with the development of the chiropractic profession. 
By 1910 the Palmer School had courses in X-ray studies and was the first to use this new technology to detect spinal 
misalignments. In 1935 B.J. Palmer established a research clinic at the school and is credited with developing a prototype 
of the electroencephalogram or EEG. Kristyn S. Appleby & Joanne Tarver, Medical Records Review § 5.16, at 5-74 (4th ed. 2010). Palmer College of Chiropractic is 
""[k]nown throughout the profession as The Fountainhead [because it] changed the world as the first institution to offer 
chiropractic education."" Palmer College of Chiropractic, Palmer at a Glance, http://www.palmer.edu/PalmerAtAGlance/(last

1166,3," Wellmark is a purchaser of health services on behalf of its members. See Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 749 F.2d 922, 
925 (1st Cir. 1984) (""Blue Shield in essence 'buys' medical services for the account of others . . . .""). Wellmark is thus a 
""monopsonist,"" not a monopolist, as plaintiffs plead. See Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition 
and  [**8] Its Practice § 1.2(b), at 14 (4th ed. 2011). ""A monopsonist is a monopoly buyer rather than seller."" Id. ""Although most 
antitrust litigation of market power offenses has involved monopoly sellers rather than buyers, monopsony can impose social 
costs on society similar to those caused by monopoly."" Id. The distinction is not relevant for the issues decided in this opinion, 
but may be relevant under other substantive areas of antitrust law. See id. at 14-16. "
1167,4," Wellmark supported its motion with numerous exhibits, including 1986 Iowa Acts ch. 1180 (H.F. 2219), which enacted the 
insurance provisions relied on by plaintiffs; an affidavit by Wellmark's associate general counsel and assistant board secretary, 
Michele Druker, attesting Wellmark's preferred provider contracts require insurance commissioner approval; preferred provider 
agreement prototypes from 2007 and 2001 stamped ""Approved"" by the insurance commissioner; and the insurance 
commissioner's administrative regulations governing preferred provider agreements, Iowa Admininstrative Code rule 191—27. 
The parties stipulated the court should consider these exhibits along with plaintiffs' resistance and supporting exhibits in ruling 
on Wellmark's motion to dismiss."
1167,5," On April 6, 2009, shortly after Wellmark's motion for summary judgment, the district court severed Division I (the class action 
claims) from Division II (Dr. Mueller's individual claim) pursuant to the parties' stipulation. Division II remained under the existing "
1168,," case number. The district court ordered plaintiffs to file a recasted third amended petition including only Division I, which would 
be separately docketed. This is an appeal of the separately docketed case."
1168,6," In 1989, President George H.W. Bush enacted legislation mandating the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a

1173,12," New legislation, effective July 1, 2012, prohibits health insurers from imposing larger copayments for chiropractic services than 
for services by medical doctors or osteopaths. 2012 Iowa Legis. Serv. H.F. 2465, § 36 (West 2012) (to be codified at Iowa Code 
§ 514C.29) (""[A] policy, contract, or plan providing for third-party payment or prepayment of health or medical expenses shall not 
impose a copayment or coinsurance amount on an insured for services provided by a doctor of chiropractic licensed pursuant to 
chapter 151 that is greater than the copayment or coinsurance amount imposed on the insured for services provided by a person 
engaged in the practice of medicine and surgery or osteopathic medicine and surgery under chapter 148 for the same or a 
similar diagnosed condition even if a different nomenclature is used to describe the condition for which  [**35] the services are 
provided.""). Legislation and regulations administered by the Iowa Insurance Division have uniform applicability statewide. By 
contrast, plaintiffs' allegations in this litigation target the conduct of a single health insurer. "
1175,13," The fee schedules that Wellmark submitted were merely ""Illustrative,"" according to the charts, comparing ""Facility"" and ""Non-
Facility"" and ""PPO/Indemnity"" and ""HMO."" "
1176,14," This point is illustrated by Health Care Equalization Committee of the Iowa Chiropractic Society v. Iowa Medical Society, 851 
F.2d 1020 (8th Cir. 1988). In that case, chiropractors sued Wellmark's predecessor for antitrust violations, challenging its refusal "
1177,," to include chiropractic services in health care service plans. Health Care Equalization Comm., 851 F.2d at 1022. The court found 
the state action exemption available, noting that under state law at that time, ""the exclusion of chiropractors from health care 
service plans was not merely contemplated by the State of Iowa, but compelled."" Id. at 1026. The Eighth Circuit thus found the 
state action exemption applied, not because some state regulation existed in the general area, but because the decisions being 
challenged as anticompetitive were directly covered by regulation. Nowadays state law mandates the inclusion rather than the 
exclusion of chiropractic services, see, e.g., Iowa Code section 514.7(3),  [**49] but the conceptual point remains the same. "
1179,15, Wellmark reurges this argument on appeal as an alternative ground for affirming dismissal of the antitrust claims. 
1186,1," On  [**4] August 4, 2010, the Antitrust Division closed its five-year investigation of potential antitrust violations without taking 
any action."
1186,2," Era and related entities Era Aviation, Inc. and Era Group Inc. are wholly owned by defendant SEACOR Holdings. "
1187,3," Following SOI's letter request for additional discovery, and the defendants' opposition thereto, the Court issued an Order on 
December 30, 2010, stating that ""[t]he scope of all permitted depositions shall be strictly limited to the allegations set forth in 
Plaintiff's Amended Complaint ¶¶ 30-32"" and that ""[d]ocument discovery at this time is not warranted."" App. 157. "
1188,4, The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. 
1190,5," Although Twombly was decided at the motion to dismiss stage, we recently explained that HN9[
] Twombly ""aligns"" the standard for ruling on a motion to dismiss and the standard for summary judgment in an antitrust case insofar as ""[p]laintiffs 
relying on circumstantial evidence of an agreement must make a showing at both stages (with well-pled allegations and 
evidence of record, respectively) of something more than merely parallel behavior, something plausibly suggestive of (not merely 
consistent with) agreement."" Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 322 (punctuation and citations omitted)."
1190,6, The defendants do not contest that they exhibited parallel behavior by raising prices in a nearly simultaneous fashion.

BanxCorp, Ex. 7, D.E. 170-2, at *33) and a contract between Bankrate and RateCatcher, (id. at *42)."
1203,3," The Court also notes that in ¶ 188 of the 5AC, Plaintiff points to a press release in support of its allegation of market 
division/customer allocation. Plaintiff cites to a hyperlink purportedly pointing to the press release, but does not include the press 
release in the exhibits attached to the 5AC. The Court is unable to consider the content of the press release because (1) the 
hyperlink appears to be inactive, (2) the press release does not appear to have been included in the attached exhibits, and (3) 
no argument has been made that such document would be integral to the complaint. See In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. 
Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997) (""As a general matter, a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss may not consider 
matters extraneous to the pleadings. However, an exception to the  [*39] general rule is that a document integral to or explicitly 
relied upon in the complaint may be considered without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary judgment."") 
(emphasis omitted) (citations and internal quotations omitted). "
1206,4," Bankrate does not tailor any of its arguments specifically to Plaintiff's Attempted Monopoly claim. In fact, Defendant argues the 
following as to the Third Claim: ""With predatory pricing no longer pled as a basis for its § 2 claims, BanxCorp has not pled any 
anticompetitive conduct to support its § 2 claims and the Court should therefore dismiss BanxCorp's Second and Third Claims 
for relief."" (Def. Opp. Br. at 20). "
1222,1," House Bill Nos. 77, 78 and 356 amended, inter alia, sections 292.602 (establishing the Missouri emergency response 
commission), 292.617 (requiring reports when storing explosives on property), 643.225 (establishing asbestos abatement 
projects), and 643.228 (requiring training courses for asbestos removers). "
1224,2," Chronister is particularly instructive, as the plaintiff there had prevailed at the trial court level based on a petition in which the 
sole count was titled ""Conversion."" Memco, Inc. v. Chronister, 27 S.W.3d 871 (Mo. App. 2000). On appeal, the defendant argued 
that the judgment was based on an unavailable remedy because an action in conversion had not been pleaded or proven 
properly. Id. at 873. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court of appeals explained that, although the plaintiff had titled his 
claim as one sounding in conversion, ""the facts  [**32] stated [in the petition] referred to and supported multiple causes of 
action,"" id., and ""[t]he claims asserted in the petition [were] broad enough to state a cause of action for fraud""—the basis on 
which, the court of appeals found, relief actually had been granted. Id. at 875. "
1226,3," See Johnson v. Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc., 885 S.W.2d 334 (Mo. banc 1994);  [**37] R.L. Nichols Ins., Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 865 
S.W.2d 665 (Mo. banc 1993); Shqeir at 948."
1226,4," Section 260.249 purports to provide for administrative penalties when section 260.247 is violated, but it does not apply in this 
situation. See sec. 260.249 (stating that when the director of natural resources determines a provision of sections 260.200 to 
260.281 has been violated, he may assess an administrative penalty on the violator). First, the rules used for assessing the 
penalty clearly contemplate that a violation would cause endangerment to either human health or the environment, whereas 
here, County's violation only caused harm to a business entity. See 10 CSR 80-2.040(3). Additionally, any penalty assessed 
""shall be paid to the county in which the violation(s) occurred."" 10 CSR 80-2.040(4). County has violated the statute in this 
situation. It makes no sense for County to pay a penalty to itself. "
1227,5," See section VII.C, below, for a discussion of the date the two-year period began. "
1232,1," The Supreme Court, in Associated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 
103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983), and subsequently in Cargill, 479 U.S. 104, 107 S.Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427, declined to 
apply this test, reasoning that it may lead to contradictory and inconsistent results. Instead, the Court identified ""other factors in 
addition to antitrust injury"" to determine whether a particular plaintiff was an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws. Cargill, 479 
U.S. at 111 n.6, 107 S.Ct. at 490 n.6. "
1233,2," Although not alleged in QSGI's Second Amended Complaint, this in effect is an alleged 15 U.S.C. § 2 violation."
1233,3," See (DE 54, p.13) (listing the eight competitors' websites that are still operating in the used IBM mainframe computer market). "
1234,4," Although QSGI alleges antitrust injury based on IBM's six-month rule beginning in 2007, QSGI made no effort to preserve 
relevant documents in anticipation of a potential lawsuit. QSGI has admitted to the destruction of documents in a storage facility 
in Minnesota in 2009, and now QSGI has essentially no documentation or information to establish a basis for a proper antitrust 
claim. See (Plaintiff's Response to IBM's Motion to Compel Compliance with March 16, 2012 Order and For Sanctions for 
Noncompliance (May 7, 2012, ECF No. 70)). "
1239,1," The ""Advertising Injury"" coverage was an addition (""extension"") to the general commercial liability coverage and was contained 
in a November 30, 2005 amendment to the Zurich policy. "
1249,1," The court described a service zones model as follows. Police patrols perform in overlapping assignment areas within an area 
that is divided into zones. Between three and six officers are on duty, depending upon the typical intensity of the shift. A shift 
supervisor divides the service area into two to four zones, depending on the number of officers on duty. The on-duty officers are 
responsible for calls in their assigned zones, but may leave the area in order to respond to an emergency or “a major incident” in "
1250,," another zone. The supervisor would maintain overlapping responsibility in the cover car. The court found that these operational 
efficiencies were made possible in part because the Town completely surrounds the City."
1250,2," The City Police Department urges that antitrust plaintiffs have a heightened burden to demonstrate standing, reasoning that 
litigation in an antitrust case may be used to restrain, rather than to protect, legitimate competition. See Brunswick Corp. v. 
Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977) (“Plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury, which 
is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts 
unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts made possible by the 
violation.”); see also 2 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 335a (2d ed. 2000) (noting that antitrust standing “requires 
more than the constitutional minimum for the ‘case or controversy’ ” requirement). Because we conclude that the Sheriff's Office 
does not have constitutional standing, we need not reach the issue of whether the Sheriff's Office is required to prove so-called 
antitrust  [****10] standing. "

Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth., 584 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir. 2009))."
1258,2," Specifically, the Court presumes familiarity with the following decisions: the September 7, 2011 Decision and Order, Hinds 
Cnty. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 811 F. Supp. 2d 910 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (""Hinds County V""); the June 23, 2011 Decision and Order, 
Hinds Cnty. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 790 F. Supp. 2d 121 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (""Hinds County  [**19] IV"") ; the April 29, 2011 
Decision and Order, Hinds Cnty. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 790 F. Supp. 2d 106 (S.D.N.Y. 2011); the April 26, 2010 Decision and 
Order, Hinds Cnty. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 708 F. Supp. 2d 348 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); and the March 25, 2010 Decision and 
Order, Hinds Cnty. v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 700 F. Supp. 2d 378 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (""Hinds County I""). "
1260,3," The Court notes that the SCACAC already expressly includes the GE Defendants as named co-conspirators. (SCACAC ¶¶ 43-
44.) "
1264,4," The Court is certainly not tasked with examining any other criminal indictments or filings in an effort to divine the Government's 
possible rationales for its charging decisions. See Morton Salt, 387 F.2d at 97 (""[T]he absence of complete identity of defendants 
may be explained on several grounds unrelated to the question of whether the private claimant's suit is based on matters of 
which the Government complained. [S]ome of the conspirators whose activities injured the private claimant may have been too 
low in the conspiracy to be selected as named defendants or co-conspirators in the Government's necessarily broader net."" 
(internal quotations and citation omitted)). "
1265,5," The cases cited by the GE Defendants provide  [**43] no support for their position. Each case refusing to apply § 16 (i) did so 
on the grounds that the private, civil plaintiffs alleged a conspiracy in a different market than the earlier, Government action. See, 
e.g., Novell, 505 F.3d at 321 (""The DOJ complaint only expressly alleges harm to the markets for PC operating systems and for 
Internet browsers. Novell's allegations of harm to the office-productivity-applications market, therefore, overlap little with the 
subject matter of the DOJ complaint.""). "
1274,1," Citations to the ""Trial Tr."" refer to the transcript of SENA's criminal trial on alleged antitrust violations (discussed infra). In 
addition, we make a few citations to materials contained in the sealed appendix. With respect to that material only, we hereby lift 
the seal."
1274,2," Plaintiffs describe ""coated"" papers as ""papers that contain a layer of coating material . . . in combination with an adhesive on 
one or both surface(s) of the paper."" Compl. ¶ 6."
1274,3, The individual market shares at the time of other publication paper producers are unclear from the record.
1274,4, The parties dispute whether demand for publication paper increased in the latter half of 2002 and in 2003. 
1275,5," To implement a price increase once it is announced, manufacturers in the publication paper industry (as, surely, in many 
industries) engage in individualized negotiations with customers to try to persuade them to accept all or part of the price 
increase, while customers—particularly larger ones with more leverage—attempt to convince the vendor not to apply the full 
proposed price increase to their accounts. "
1276,6," The parties dispute whether, when they spoke, either Korhonen or Tynkkynen (or both) were aware of IP's possible price 
increase. Asked at SENA's criminal trial what prompted him to call Tynkkynen, Korhonen testified that he did not have a ""specific 
recollection"" of the phone call, but that it ""c[ould] be related to"" IP's price increase. Trial Tr. at 308. In a subsequent declaration, 
however, Korhonen asserted that during the February 6 phone call he did not discuss with Tynkkynen ""any specific price 
increase or a possible price increase."" Decl. of Kai Korhonen  [**13] in Supp. of Defs. SEO and SENA's Mot. for Summ. J. ¶ 39. 
Tynkkynen contends that Tynkkynen first learned of IP's plan to raise its prices on February 8, two days after the phone call. "
1278,7," Plaintiffs also take issue with the district court's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury 
could find that Korhonen and Tynkkynen conspired to reduce the supply of publication paper. We agree with the district court 
that the evidence demonstrates conclusively  [**21] that SENA's plan to reduce capacity was in development long before 
Korhonen and Tynkkynen began communicating in August 2002. Accordingly, we will not discuss further plaintiffs' allegations 
concerning reductions in capacity. "
1281,8," Any questions of Tynkkynen's credibility, perception, or memory  [**31] are, of course, for the jury. On this appeal, we must 
assume they will be answered in favor of plaintiffs. "
1282,9," Plaintiffs' economic expert, Dr. John C. Beyer, estimated that SENA and UPM's prices were 5.98% higher during the class 
period than they would have been in the absence of the alleged conspiracy. Using this estimate, Dr. Beyer calculated further that 
plaintiffs sustained $102.5 million in  [**36] damages during the class period as a result of the alleged conspiracy. Defendants' 
expert, Dr. Peter Bronsteen, contested this analysis."
1282,10," Neither this court nor any other of which we are aware has determined whether Matsushita's ""tends to exclude"" standard 
applies to the causation element as well as to the agreement element of a section 1 price-fixing claim. Assuming, without 
deciding, that it does, we are satisfied that the causation evidence discussed infra would satisfy that standard. "
1284,11," During SENA's criminal trial, Korhonen testified that even if UPM had not followed IP's price increase in February 2003, SENA 
would still have increased its prices. Korhonen conceded, however, that notes taken by an investigator during Korhonen's earlier 
interview with the DOJ reflected that Korhonen told the government that he would not have allowed SENA to raise its prices had 
Tynkkynen informed him that UPM would not match IP. Although Korhonen testified that he did not have a specific recollection 
of making this statement, he did not deny making it."
1284,12," Although the record is not decisive in this respect, there is evidence that SENA and UPM each consistently attempted to 
implement the full amount of the February 2003 price increase when negotiating contracts with customers, reflecting the 
""seriously implement"" aspect  [**45] of the alleged agreement. For instance, Tynkkynen refused to allow UPM salespeople to 
enter into contracts with customers at prices below the full price increase amount, even when customers threatened to take their 
business elsewhere. There is also some evidence that SENA stood firm on the price increase despite customer resistance."
1284,13," This Court has on at least one occasion mentioned other factors that may inform a court's decision regarding disputed 
causation issues at summary judgment, see Williams v. Utica Coll. of Syracuse Univ., 453 F.3d 112, 121-22 (2d Cir. 2006); see 
also Williams v. KFC Nat'l Mgmt. Co., 391 F.3d 411, 422-25 (2d Cir. 2004) (Calabresi, J., concurring) (considering strength of 
evidence, relative knowledge of parties, and ""how strongly we feel about making an error in one direction as against the other""). 
Such considerations have not been addressed by the parties, and  [**46] we therefore do not address them further, although it 
appears that these factors favor plaintiffs here. "
1288,1," GDSes distribute airline fare, flight, and availability information to travel agents, enabling those travel agents to make 
reservations and issue tickets  [*6] to travelers. (Pl.'s Second Am. Compl. 2, ¶ 2.) Airlines provide their information to GDSes 
and pay each GDS a booking fee for every reservation that is made through the GDS. (Id. at 3, ¶¶ 6-7.)"
1288,2," The GDS model is explained in detail in the Court's November 21, 2011 Order Regarding Motions to Dismiss and Motion for 
Leave (doc. 244). "
1289,3," Section 2 of the Sherman Act reads, in relevant part, as follows: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony . . . ."
1289,15, U.S.C.A. § 2 (West 2012).
1289,4," It would take a treatise to respond to all of the arguments raised by the parties in their motion-to-dismiss briefing. Therefore, the 
Court will explicitly address only those arguments (a) that are germane to the disposition of the instant motions and (b) that are 
not indirectly addressed by the Court's analysis. "
1291,5," Section 1 states, ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1. "
1292,6," Throughout its briefing, Travelport highlights purported discrepancies between American's allegations and the actual 
documents from which  [*23] the allegations are derived. While the Court is permitted to consider certain documents described 
in American's second amended complaint, and even though the Court is not bound to treat as true any allegations that contradict 
such documents, the Court declines to engage in significant document review at the pleading stage. In other words, the Court 
will not undertake to check the accuracy of the allegations in American's fifty-five-page second amended complaint and four-
page supplement by comparing each of those allegations to the document from which it is derived. Such an evidence-based 
process is more appropriately conducted at the summary-judgment stage. At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, the Court will treat 
American's allegations as true and will only refuse to give them effect if they are directly contradicted by a document obviously 
central to American's second amended complaint. See Kaiser Aluminum, 677 F.2d at 1050; Sullivan, 600 F.3d at 546. "
1293,7," This alleged agreement not to compete is horizontal because it is primarily between Orbitz and other travel agencies. See Bus. 
Elec. Corp. v. Sharp Elec., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988) (""Restraints imposed by agreement 
between competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints.""). That Travelport has joined in the agreement 
and policed it does not render the agreement a vertical restraint, even though Travelport has a vertical relationship with Orbitz. 
See Red Diamond Supply, Inc. v. Liquid Carbonic Corp., 637 F.2d 1001, 1004 (5th Cir. 1981) (""Conspiracies between a 
manufacturer and its distributors are . . . treated as horizontal when the source of the conspiracy is a combination of the 
distributors.""). Moreover, American's failure to identify the other travel-agency participants is not fatal to American's section 1 claim (as it was to 
many of American's claims in the first amended complaint) because American has alleged the identity  [*29] of at least two 
members of the conspiracy—Travelport and Orbitz—and because American has alleged sufficient facts to apprise Travelport 
and Orbitz of the particular agreement that it is challenging. In any event, American explains that it knows the identities of the 
other travel-agency participants but that Orbitz refused to consent to American's filing of a proposed second amended complaint 
that included those names. If this is true, then Orbitz should not be permitted to now challenge the sufficiency of American's 
complaint on that basis. "
1294,8," Travelport posits that ""[a] plaintiff that voluntarily enters into and enjoys the benefits of a contract cannot later complain that the 
contract violates the antitrust laws."" (Travelport Supp. Mot. to Dismiss 6.) According to Travelport, American ""will need to show 
that [it] had anticompetitive terms imposed upon it"" and that it ""unwillingly complied."" (Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).) 
Travelport's position is difficult to reconcile with the United States Supreme Court's comments in Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. 
International Parts Corporation, 392 U.S. 134, 140, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968), overruled on other grounds by 
Copperweld Corporation v. Independence Tube Corporation, 467 U.S. 752, 777, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). 
There, the Supreme Court, in holding that in pari delicto is not a defense to an antitrust action, stated that a ""plaintiff who reaps 
the reward of treble damages may be no less morally reprehensible than the defendant, but the law encourages his suit to 
further the overriding public policy in favor of competition."" Id. at 139. The Court noted further that ""permitting the plaintiff to 
recover a windfall gain does not encourage  [*32] continued violations by those in his position since they remain fully subject to 
civil and criminal penalties for their own illegal conduct."" Id. Thus, the Court is not persuaded that American must allege facts 
showing that it was completely innocent in its involvement in the scheme embodied by the subscriber agreements. But at the same time, the Supreme Court explicitly declined to answer the question of whether ""truly complete involvement and 
participation in a monopolistic scheme could ever be a basis, wholly apart from the idea of in pari delicto, for barring a plaintiff's 
cause of action."" Id. at 140. That is, ""Perma Life Mufflers did not foreclose a defense to an antitrust claim based on a plaintiff's 
'truly complete involvement.'"" Rogers v. McDorman, 521 F.3d 381, 388-89 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting Perma Life Mufflers, 392 U.S. 
at 140). In any event, American's allegations do not suggest that it had ""truly complete involvement"" in the drafting and selection 
of provisions in the subscriber agreements. To the contrary, American has alleged facts indicating that the economic realities 
were such that American had little choice but to accept the terms in the subscriber agreements. Thus,  [*33] American should 
not be barred from asserting section 1 claims based on its subscriber agreements with Sabre and Travelport simply because 
American was a party to those agreements. See Perma Life Mufflers, 392 U.S. at 140 (""[E]ven if petitioners actually favored and 
supported some of the other restrictions, they cannot be blamed for seeking to minimize the disadvantages of the agreement 
once they had been forced to accept its more onerous terms as a condition of doing business.""). "
1310,*," The Honorable George H. Wu, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation."
1310,1," The precept is most often cited as the ""filed rate doctrine,"" although  [**3] it is sometimes referenced as the ""filed tariff doctrine"" 
(see, e.g., Davel Commc'ns, Inc. v. Qwest Corp., 460 F.3d 1075, 1084 (9th Cir. 2006)), and, on rarer occasions, as the 
""Keogh doctrine"" (see, e.g., Cost Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Wash. Natural Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 943 & n.7 (9th Cir. 1996)), after the 
case where it was purportedly first established (i.e., Keogh v. Chi. & Nw. Ry. Co., 260 U.S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 67 L. Ed. 183 
(1922)). As used herein (except where a different term is utilized within a quoted source), the reference will be to the ""filed rate 
doctrine."""
1310,2," The district court's dismissal decision is reported at Carlin v. DairyAmerica, Inc., 690 F. Supp. 2d 1128 (E.D. Cal. 2010). "
1311,3," HN2[
] In the context of milk and milk products, ""handler"" is defined in 7 C.F.R. § 1000.9 (2012)."
1311,4," For example, HN7[
] there is no FMMO covering the state of California. See Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons, 539 U.S. 59, 61, 123 S. Ct. 2142, 156 L. Ed. 2d 54 (2003). "
1313,5," See also Kenneth Bailey & Peter Tozer, An Evaluation of Federal Order Reform, 84 J. Dairy Sci. 974, 977 (2001) (indicating 
that NASS had been using such exchanges for pricing information but that they were considered to be ""thin markets"" because 
only a small percent of the commodities were actually traded on them and, hence, they were subject to potential price 
manipulation). "
1314,6," HN22[
] The AMAA contains no provision under which milk producers can challenge a marketing order through administrative 
review. See United Dairymen of Ariz. v. Veneman, 279 F.3d 1160, 1164 (9th Cir. 2002). The Supreme Court in Stark v. 
Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 64 S. Ct. 559, 88 L. Ed. 733 (1944), held that producers  [**19] could obtain judicial review of the 
Secretary of Agriculture's practice of deducting certain administrative expenses from the settlement fund before calculating the 
blended price which resulted in a reduced price for the producers. The Court found a basis for judicial review because the AMAA 
had given producers ""definite personal rights"" and ""the silence of Congress as to judicial review is, at any rate in the absence of 
an administrative remedy, not to be construed as a denial of authority to the aggrieved person to seek appropriate relief in the 
federal courts in the exercise of their general jurisdiction."" Id. at 309. In our consideration of the holdings in Stark, we concluded 
that ""judicial review of the producers' complaint was necessary to 'ensure achievement of the Act's most fundamental objectives 
— to wit, the protection of the producers of milk and milk products.'"" United Dairymen, 279 F.3d at 1165 (quoting Block, 467 
U.S. at 352). "
1316,7," As noted by the NASS: In cases where there had been reporting problems, NASS provided the firms with their previously reported data and asked 
them to review and submit appropriate corrections. NASS agreed to summarize results of this process in a special report to be released on June 19, 2008. However, no firms 
provided corrected data, and therefore NASS will not issue a special report. News Release, Nat'l Agric. Statistics Serv., U.S. Dep't of Agric., NASS Will Not Issue Special Report on Nonfat Dry Milk Prices 
(June 19, 2008), available at http://www.nass.usda.gov/Newsroom/Notices/06_19_2008.asp (last visited June 19, 2012). "
1318,8," As noted in Lowering the Filed Tariff Shield, 56 Vand. L. Rev. at 1599: HN27[
] In original design,  [**31] the [filed rate] doctrine was intended to serve as a sword to protect consumers from 
monopolistic price discrimination, such as a railroad charging different rates to customers of different states, or charging the 
shipping companies with whom it competes exorbitant prices, without justifications based on the cost of providing service to 
the customer."
1318,9," For example, HN31[
] California has declined to create a state filed rate doctrine even where the tariffs are filed with the state 
regulatory agency having authority over the subject area and even if the rates have been approved as reasonable by that 
agency. See Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 992-93 (9th Cir. 2000). "
1320,10," Plaintiffs also relied on our decision in Wileman Bros., which is readily distinguishable from the present case. In Wileman 
Bros., the defendants were nectarine and plum growers who served as members of committees appointed by the Secretary of 
Agriculture and who (without  [**41] the Secretary's authorization) issued and enforced a ""well-matured"" standard governing 
when those varieties of fruits could be picked. Wileman Bros. did not involve a tariff or rate submitted to or issued by a federal 
agency. Thus, the filed rate doctrine was not applicable to that situation. Further, the holding of that case was that the "
1321,," defendants could not establish immunity from antitrust claims on the simple basis that the Secretary had ""tacitly"" approved the 
higher maturity standards they issued by his failing to explicitly disapprove them, as he could have done under applicable 
regulations. See 909 F.2d at 337-38."
1321,11," Gallo relied on an earlier case involving market rates for electricity, where it was held that the filed rate doctrine applied 
because the FERC was ""doing enough regulation to justify federal preemption of state laws."" Gallo, 503 F.3d at 1041 (quoting 
Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cnty. v. Dynegy Power Mktg., Inc., 384 F.3d 756, 760 (9th Cir. 2004)).  [**43] In Gallo too, 
we concluded that the FERC was doing enough regulation for the filed rate doctrine to apply. First, the FERC determined that 
the best way to ensure just and reasonable rates in the evolving natural gas market was to allow natural gas sales to proceed at 
market prices. See id. at 1041-42. Second, the FERC reviewed the natural gas market and determined it was competitive. See 
id. at 1042. Third, although the FERC did not impose individualized reporting requirements on sellers of natural gas, it 
maintained ongoing oversight of the market and took corrective responses to evidence of market manipulation. See id. We thus 
concluded that, ""[b]ecause FERC has not abdicated its responsibilities but has acted, albeit with a light hand, to authorize just 
and reasonable rates in the natural gas arena, the Filed Rate Doctrine continues to preempt any rate-setting activities by the 
courts and bar federal antitrust claims under the Filed Rate Doctrine."" Id."
1321,12," The USDA clearly had statutory authority. Plaintiffs' Complaint alleges that the Secretary issued a rule that allowed for such 
review in 2007. Thus, even if the Secretary did not choose to review the accuracy of data reported to NASS, he had the power to 
do so. "
1322,13," Defendants' citations are to the federal register and, hence, judicially noticeable. See 44 U.S.C. § 1507."
1322,14," Plaintiffs also cite three cases from the same district court which declined to apply the filed rate doctrine to Medicaid 
reimbursement rates for prescription drugs. Each case, however, rejected the application of the doctrine at least in part because 
there were no filed rates. Massachusetts v. Mylan Labs., 357 F. Supp. 2d 314, 329 (D. Mass. 2005) (holding that the filed rate 
doctrine was inapplicable because ""[t]he reported data do not control the rates which Defendants can charge customers, as a 
tariff would""); In re Lupron Mktg. and Sales Prac. Litig., 295 F. Supp. 2d 148, 163 n.16 (D. Mass. 2003); In re Pharm. Indus. 
Average Wholesale Price Litig., 263 F. Supp. 2d 172, 192 (D. Mass. 2003) (holding that filed rate doctrine did not apply because 
pharmaceutical  [**49] companies do not file rates with any agency). Furthermore, none of these cases address the doctrine at 
significant length and they would not therefore be particularly persuasive even if they were on point. "
1323,15," Accord City of Groton v. Conn. Light & Power Co., 662 F.2d 921, 929 (2d Cir. 1981): Under the Keogh or ""filed rate"" doctrine, . . . a public utility subject to regulation is not subject to antitrust liability to its 
customers for rates or services provided under tariffs approved by the appropriate regulatory agency. The rationale is that 
the regulatory agency determines the legal rate and the utility must collect it while it is in effect. The doctrine applies to 
rates that have been published but not acted upon by the regulatory agency, because they are the legal rates until 
suspended or set aside. (Citation omitted)."
1323,16," The Court in Ark. La. Gas Co. also noted that ""[w]e save for another day the question whether the filed rate doctrine applies in 
the face of fraudulent conduct."" Id. at 583 n.13. "
1324,17," Defendants also cite Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. where the Court declined to order the lower court to direct an agency to 
make a retroactive determination where Congress had not granted such authority to the agency. 341 U.S. at 254. It was noted 
that the agency's decision was required because the reasonableness of the rate charged, which could only be assessed by the 
agency, was determinative as to whether the plaintiff had a viable cause of action and a basis for the federal courts to exercise 
jurisdiction. Id. at 253-54. "
1325,18," However, the Court found that the ICC had not found the rates were unreasonable but rather that the carrier had engaged in 
an unreasonable practice. It then held that: The Commission argues that under the filed rate doctrine, a finding that the carrier engaged in an unreasonable practice 
should, like a finding that the filed rate is unreasonable, disentitle the carrier to collection of the filed rate. We have never 
held that a carrier's unreasonable practice justifies departure from the filed tariff schedule. But  [**59] we need not resolve 
this issue today because we conclude that the justification for departure from the filed tariff schedule that the ICC set forth 
in its Negotiated Rates policy rests on an interpretation of the Act that is contrary to the language and structure of the 
statute as a whole and the requirements that make up the filed rate doctrine in particular. Under the Negotiated Rates policy, the ICC has determined that a carrier engages in an unreasonable practice when it 
attempts to collect the filed rate after the parties have negotiated a lower rate. The ICC argues that its conclusion is entitled 
to deference because § 10701 does not specifically address the types of practices that are to be considered unreasonable 
and because its construction is rational and consistent with the statute. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources 
Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). We disagree. For a century, this Court has held that the Act, as it incorporates the filed rate doctrine, forbids as 
discriminatory the secret negotiation and collection of rates lower than the filed rate. See supra, at 126-128. By refusing to 
order collection of the filed rate solely because the parties  [**60] had agreed to a lower rate, the ICC has permitted the 
very price discrimination that the Act by its terms seeks to prevent."
1325,497, U.S. at 129-30 (footnote omitted). 
1326,19," The district court also held that the filed rate doctrine should preclude plaintiffs' claim for damages because they had not 
alleged that DairyAmerica's actions were willful or knowing. 690 F. Supp. 2d at 1139-40. Plaintiffs argue that NASS's instructions 
were clear and that the fact that DairyAmerica's reporting errors were self-serving suggests that its misstatements were knowing. 
The Supreme Court made a similar inference in American Trucking, holding that ""[t]he guidelines for antitrust immunity . . . are of 
such a nature that carriers who submit tariffs in substantial violation of agreements will be aware of their transgressions."" 467 
U.S. at 370-71. The regulations in this case were similarly clear (""don't report long-term prices"" is not a very hard instruction to 
understand), yet we need not address the issue of whether DairyAmerica's misreporting was intentional because neither the 
district court nor the parties have identified a precedent which holds that knowledge is determinative of plaintiffs' right to proceed. 
 [**63] The district court quotes Cooperative Power Association v. FERC, which held that American Trucking ""approved 
retroactive tariff rejection as a sanction for knowing violations of agreements"" but omits its qualification that the Supreme Court's 
decision was premised on the assumption that ""any carrier in substantial violation of a rate-bureau agreement would be aware of 
the violation."" 739 F.2d 390, 391 n.3 (8th Cir. 1984) (per curiam). Cooperative Power contains no language requiring knowledge. 
And since American Trucking assumed knowledge, it did not reach the question of whether damages could be recovered without 
it."
1326,20," The district court found that about 90 percent of the contracts reported to the NASS by DairyAmerica were forward contracts, 
which under DMEA procedures were not to be included in the data provided to the NASS. 690 F. Supp. 2d at 1131."
1326,21," While the defendants argue that the AMS (which defendants characterize as ""the division that the Secretary charged with 
FMMO minimum price oversight and enforcement"") did not reject or change previously announced FMMO prices as a result of 
the discovery of their misreporting, the USDA OIG has stated: ""Given that incorrect nonfat dry milk prices were factored into the 
FMMO formula, AMS has stated that its published FMMO prices were incorrect. According to the AMS, this caused the total "
1327,," value of milk to be understated by $50 million between April 29, 2006 and April 14, 2007."" Further, on June 28, 2007, AMS 
issued a report on ""Impacts of NASS Nonfat Dry Milk Price and Sales Volume Revisions on Federal Order Prices"" which was 
based on revisions due to the discovery of the misreporting."
1327,22," Because the USDA itself had no mechanism for retroactive sanctions, plaintiffs reason, it could only have attempted to 
calculate revised rates to facilitate private litigation (they deny, however, that such an interpretation of the agency's actions is 
necessary for their claims to succeed). "
1328,23," If the acts of misreporting by the handler were considered to be violations of the FMMO orders themselves, the AMAA 
provides for civil penalties of up to $1,000 for each such violation. 7 U.S.C. § 608c(14)(B)."
1328,24," MS referred to these as ""reallocation"" effects. Defendants call them a ""dynamic model."" But all parties are referring to the 
same phenomenon."
1328,25," Defendants  [**73] also note that other firms' misstatements were included in the revised figures issues by NASS and then 
argue that plaintiffs might not be able to get data from firms besides DairyAmerica in discovery and hence would not be able to 
calculate accurate revised prices using the FMMO formulas. But if plaintiffs seek to recover damages from DairyAmerica only, 
damages would be measured by the effect DairyAmerica's misstatements alone had on the FMMO prices. Also, as noted above, 
DairyAmerica sells about 75 percent of the NFDM produced in the United States, and approximately 90 percent of its contracts 
reported in the weekly NASS surveys were forward contracts which should not have been included."
1328,26," As stated in Clemente v. State, 40 Cal. 3d 202, 219 Cal. Rptr. 445, 707 P.2d 818, 828 (Cal. 1985): HN52[
] In general, one who has been tortiously injured is entitled to be compensated for the harm and the injured party 
must establish ""by proof the extent of the harm and the amount of money representing adequate compensation with as 
much certainty as the nature of the tort and the circumstances permit."" (Rest.2d Torts, § 912, p. 478.) However, ""[t]here is 
no general requirement that the injured person should prove with like definiteness the extent of the harm that he has 
suffered as a result of the tortfeasor's conduct. It is desirable that responsibility for harm should not be imposed until it has 
been proved with reasonable certainty  [**75] that the harm resulted from the wrongful conduct of the person charged. It is "
1329,," desirable, also, that there be definiteness of proof of the amount of damage as far as is reasonably possible. It is even more 
desirable, however, that an injured person not be deprived of substantial compensation merely because he cannot prove 
with complete certainty the extent of harm he has suffered."" (Rest.2d Torts, § 912, com. a, at p. 479.) (Alteration in original). "
1349,1," Motorola's TAC alleges antitrust claims based on three categories of purchases: ""(1) LCD Panels delivered by the Defendants 
to Motorola in the United States; (2) LCD Panels delivered to Motorola manufacturing facilities abroad for inclusion in Motorola 
devices imported into the U.S. by Motorola and later sold by Motorola to customers in the United States; and (3) LCD Panels 
delivered to Motorola manufacturing facilities abroad for inclusion in Motorola devices sold to Motorola customers abroad."" TAC 
¶ 184. Defendants seek summary adjudication on the second and third categories of claims (the ""foreign injury claims""). "
1380,1," B&T and MAS's motion is an amended motion to dismiss. They filed an initial motion to dismiss based on the original 
complaint. The amended motion is aimed at the FAC."
1380,2," B&T and MAS have also moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to lack of standing under Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(1). "
1381,3," While Midwest says it ""made many unsuccessful attempts to contact [Wayne County] to object  [*9] to and further discuss the 
discrepancy in the bid amounts,"" Midwest does not allege that it submitted a formal bid protest under Wayne County Ordinance 
§ 120.161(a). Instead, Midwest says it made telephone calls to Wayne County. FAC at ¶¶ 48, 52. "
1383,4," B&T and MAS have moved to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) based on Midwest's lack of standing. This argument is 
based on Midwest's failure to alleged an antitrust injury, which is not exactly the same as Article III standing. As the Court has 
explained: HN4[
] The related concepts of antitrust injury and antitrust standing are often confused. This confusion  [*16] occurs 
because the two concepts ""share a common ingredient."" The common ingredient is that both requirements limit ""recovery to 
those who have been injured by restraint on competitive forces in the economy."" Any inquiry to determine whether antitrust 
injury has been shown is more limited than one to determine whether the plaintiff has standing. The single determinant of 
antitrust injury is whether the plaintiff has suffered an ""injury the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that 
flows from that which makes [a defendant's] act [ ] unlawful."" On the other hand, even if an antitrust injury is shown 
sufficiently, standing may be denied on the basis of other factors. The purpose of the additional inquiries is to confine 
recovery to cases that promote the congressional intent to ensure that consumers receive the benefits of competitive 
markets. Baum, 31 F. Supp. 2d at 1022 n. 6."
1383,5," Both Michigan and Federal courts have noted that MARA is patterned after the Sherman Act. HN5[
] ""The Michigan antitrust act is patterned after the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., and Federal court interpretations of the Sherman Act are 
persuasive authority as to the meaning of the Michigan act."" Goldman v. Loubella Extendables, 91 Mich.App. 212, 219, 283 
N.W.2d 695 (1979). MARA ""adopted language from and is interpreted consistent with the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1."" 
Perceptron, Inc. v. Sensor Adaptive Machs. Inc., 221 F.3d 913, 919 n. 6 (6th Cir. 2002). Thus, courts have applied the same 
analysis to claims under the Sherman Act and MARA. "
1387,6," B&T and MAS also contend that to the extent Midwest brings these claims under 15 U.S.C. § 13a, they must be dismissed 
because HN17[
] no private cause of action exists under this section. "

Pharmaceuticals Corp. (formerly Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz), (4) Pfizer Inc. (including two indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries: G. D.

companies merged in 1999. Def. Mem. 1 n.1, Docket Entry 678. "
1395,3," ""Drug Mart I,"" a decision not directly relevant here, is reported at 378 F. Supp. 2d 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2005). "
1397,4," ""PBMs"" are pharmacy benefit managers. Def. R.56.1 ¶ 39."
1397,5," Plaintiffs had previously produced a list of approximately 2,770,426 potential lost customers for 500 pharmacies. Def. R.56.1 ¶ 
50."
1397,6," For purposes of statistical analysis, defendants point out that the equivalent of ten years of data was collected and analyzed. 
Herscovici Decl. ¶ 13. Plaintiffs originally identified thirteen favored purchasers and three distributors. Tietjen Decl. Ex. 6, Docket "
1398,," Entry 686. Three of the favored purchasers were able to produce data beginning from 1998. Pl. R.56.1 ¶ 66. Express Scripts 
matched data beginning from January, 2002; Advance PCS collected data from January, 2006. Id. Plaintiffs contend that 
Express Scripts, Medco and CVS/Caremark currently account for 50% of the PBM marketplace. Pl. Opp. at 7 n.19, Docket Entry 
684."
1398,7," Although defendants challenge several aspects of the results of the matching process as calculated by plaintiffs, I rely — as do 
defendants in large part — on plaintiffs' tabulations of matched lost customers for purposes of deciding the pending motion."
1398,8," ""Herscovici Decl."" refers to the Declaration of Steven Herscovici, Ph, D., submitted in support  [*17] of defendants' motion for 
summary judgment, Docket Entry 681."
1398,9," Although plaintiffs note that the five favored purchasers that were searched as part of the matching process account for only 
50% of the PBM marketplace, and that only the  [*19] most common prescription drugs were included in the search protocol, 
plaintiffs offer no alternative base figure for comparison."
1398,10," After defendants submitted their summary judgment motion, plaintiffs further refined their results and dismissed some of their 
claims. Defendants then filed an amended memorandum of law to reflect plaintiffs' changes to the matching results. Docket 
Entry 698. In the amended memorandum, defendants calculate that 87% of plaintiffs' claims are based on five or fewer lost 
customers per year. Docket Entry  [*20] 698-1 at 10. "
1400,11," In their memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, plaintiffs contend that Pharma-Card lost 2,773 customers. Pl. Opp. 
at 22."
1400,12," Pharma-Card identified a total of 1,669 lost transactions through the matching process. Pl. Opp. at 23. I presume that the 
number of claimed lost transactions is smaller than the number  [*23] of lost customers because lost transactions were 
determined solely from the matching process and not manually supplemented. Even if Pharma-Card operated at a single retail 
location, this would amount to approximately 160 lost transactions per year, a tiny sum when compared to the more than 22,000 
BNPD transactions conducted annually by the average retail pharmacy."
1400,13," Plaintiffs do contend that some customers were lost to favored purchasers other than those whose data was used in the 
matching process. Pl. Opp. at 15, 19. It was plaintiffs, though, who selected the favored purchasers whose data would be 
included."
1400,14," In addition, reports of customers as related by pharmacy employees are arguably hearsay. See, e.g., Teitjen Decl. Ex. 20, 
Tallman Aff. ¶ 8 & Ex. B at 4; id. Ex. 23, Mouret Aff. ¶ 10; id. Ex. 29, Ellison Aff. ¶ 10. However, the Second Circuit has explicitly 
permitted testimony of the same type pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3) when offered in antitrust cases to prove 
customers' motives. Hydrolevel Corp. v. Am. Soc'y of Mech. Eng'rs, Inc., 635 F.2d 118, 128 (2d Cir. 1980); Herman Schwabe, 
Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 297 F.2d 906, 914 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 865, 82 S. Ct. 1031, 8 L. Ed. 2d 85 (1962). "
1401,15," The Court has, on other occasions, stated that the Robinson-Patman Act should be construed liberally and ""broadly to 
effectuate its purpose."" Abbott Labs. v. Portland Retail Druggists Ass'n, Inc., 425 U.S. 1, 11, 96 S. Ct. 1305, 47 L. Ed. 2d 537 
(1976), quoted in Jefferson Cnty. Pharm. Ass'n, Inc. v. Abbott Labs., 460 U.S. 150, 159, 103 S. Ct. 1011, 74 L. Ed. 2d 882 
(1983). Although Volvo does not disavow these prior decisions, the Volvo decision does seem to place more emphasis on the 
possible anti-competitive effects of the  [*27] Robinson-Patman Act than prior decisions. At least one scholar has noted that the 
Robinson-Patman Act has ""come into disfavor"" during the last quarter century. Daniel J. Gifford & Robert T. Kudrle, The Law 
and Economics of Price Discrimination in Modern Economies: Time for Reconciliation?, 43 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. 1235, 1269 
(2010)."
1401,16," Plaintiffs also assert claims pursuant to Sections 2(d) and 2(f) of the Robinson-Patman Act, discussed infra. "
1402,17," Defendants  [*29] do not contest, for purposes of the pending motion, plaintiffs' allegations of discriminatory pricing. Indeed, 
the Seventh Circuit, ruling on appeal from a grant of judgment as a matter of law against the plaintiff class, stated that ""the 
manufacturers of brand name prescription drugs engage in price discrimination . . . . Everyone knows this."" In re Brand Name 
Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., 186 F.3d 781, 786 (7th Cir. 1999)."
1402,18," In opposing summary judgment, plaintiffs cite cases suggesting that a showing of injury to a competitor is sufficient to 
establish competitive injury, even in the face of proof that competition remains healthy. Pl. Opp. at 40 (citing Chroma Lighting v. 
GTE Products Corp., 111 F.3d 653, 657 (9th Cir. 1997)  [*31] (referring to ""Congressional intent to protect individual competitors, 
not just market competition"") and J.F. Feeser, Inc. v. Serv-a-Portion, Inc., 909 F.2d 1524, 1535 (3rd Cir. 1990) (holding that 
""evidence of injury to a competitor may satisfy the component of competitive injury necessary to show a violation of the 
Robinson-Patman Act"")). See also Alan's of Atlanta, Inc. v. Minolta Corp., 903 F.2d 1414, 1418 n.6 (11th Cir. 1990) (citing cases 
and finding that ""the legal focus of the competitive injury inquiry is on the competitor, not the consumer""). The language from 
Volvo quoted in the text raises a question about the continued viability of these holdings. "
1403,19," A plaintiff seeking to establish competitive injury in a secondary-line case must prove that it was a disfavored purchaser 
engaged in actual competition with a favored purchaser(s) at the time of the price differential. Best Brands Beverage, Inc. v. 
Falstaff Brewing Corp., 842 F.2d 578, 584 (2d Cir. 1987). Defendants apparently do not dispute, at least for purposes of this 
motion, that plaintiffs and the favored purchasers whose data was used in the matching process were in competition. "
1406,20," Judge Glasser discussed the standard to apply in analyzing antitrust injury as follows: First,  [*47] the plaintiffs must prove the fact of antitrust injury; second, they must make a showing regarding the amount of 
damages in order to justify an award by the trier of fact. . . . [P]laintiffs' burden of proving the fact of damage under § 4 of 
the Clayton Act is satisfied by its proof of some damage flowing from the unlawful conspiracy. Once causation is 
established, the jury is permitted to calculate the actual damages suffered using a ""'reasonable estimate, as long as the jury 
verdict is not the product of speculation or guess work.'"" The plaintiffs therefore must proffer evidence of some damage, 
with the recognition that the actual amount need not be proven to the same degree of certainty as proving some quantum of 
damages. Drug Mart II, 472 F. Supp. 2d at 423-24 (citing Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 114, 89 S. Ct. 
1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1969) and Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555, 562, 51 S. Ct. 248, 75 
L. Ed. 544 (1931)). "
1408,21," Section 2(d)  [*52] prohibits any person engaged in commerce to pay or contract for the payment of anything of value to or for the benefit of a customer 
of such person in the course of such commerce as compensation or in consideration for any services or facilities furnished 
by or through such customer in connection with the processing, handling, sale, or offering for sale of any products or 
commodities manufactured, sold, or offered for sale by such person, unless such payment or consideration is available on 
proportionally equal terms to all other customers competing in the distribution of such products or commodities."
1408,15," U.S.C. § 13(d). Section 2(f) provides that it is ""unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such 
commerce, knowingly to induce or receive a discrimination in price which is prohibited by this section."" Id. § 13(f). "
1409,1," Defendant Steve Vande Vegte (""SVV"") does not join in CleanTech's motion. "
1410,2," Both parties refer to a second lawsuit between Vande Vegte and CCT in their moving papers even though this vital second 
 [*5] lawsuit is not clearly alleged anywhere in the complaint. (See Def.'s Mot. 7:11-12; Pl.'s Opp'n 4:4-6.) CleanTech cites 
Paragraph 106 of the complaint, which only passingly mentions ""concurrent litigation"" against Clean Earth Solutions with no 
mention of CCT; CCT conveniently does not identify any allegation in the complaint that discusses the second lawsuit. "
1411,3," CleanTech claims that CCT's opposition was untimely. (Def.'s Reply 6:23-28.) This argument is completely baseless and 
frivolous. Based on the May 7, 2012 hearing date for this motion, CCT's opposition was due April 23, 2012. CleanTech concedes 
that that is indeed the due date for the opposition. The docket shows that CCT filed its opposition on April 23, 2012. (Doc. 20.) 
Accordingly, the Court rejects CleanTech's claim and will consider CCT's opposition in assessing the merits of CleanTech's 
motion. "
1414,4," The Cartwright Act is California's antitrust law that ""was modeled after the Sherman Act."" Cnty. of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. 
Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001). Accordingly, ""[t]he analysis under  [*17] California's antitrust law mirrors the 
analysis under federal law because the Cartwright . . . was modeled after the Sherman Act."" Id. (citations omitted). Therefore, 
because CleanTech's argument against CCT's Cartwright Act claim is predicated on the insufficiency of CCT's Sherman Act 
claims, CleanTech also fails to show that CCT's Cartwright Act claim is insufficiently pled as well."
1414,5," Though it is unclear which litigation that the ""State Court lawsuit"" refers to, the analysis below applies to both the SVV litigation 
and the unalleged second lawsuit between Vande Vegte and CCT. "
1415,6," CleanTech further moves to dismiss CCT's UCL claim on the grounds that it is barred by California's absolute litigation 
privilege. ""The usual formation is that the privilege applies to any communication (1) made in judicial or quasi judicial 
proceedings; (2) by litigants or other participants authorized by law; (3) to achieve objects of the litigation; and (4) that have 
some connection or logical relation to the action."" People v. The Pac. Lumber Co., 158 Cal. App. 4th 950, 958, 70 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
501 (2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). CleanTech fails to identify any communication or action that falls 
under this protection. Therefore, the Court rejects CleanTech's absolute-litigation-privilege argument. "

1420,3," Comcast also argues that the Second Circuit failed to consider the fact that its decision violated the American Rule on 
attorneys' fees. Under the American Rule, ""each party is to bear its own costs of litigation, unmitigated by any fee-shifting 
exceptions."" Arbor Hill Concerned Citizens Neighborhood Ass'n v. Cnty. of Albany, 522 F.3d 182, 186 (2d Cir. 2008). According 
to Comcast, American Express III is contrary to the American Rule ""because it provides access to class-action procedures and 
fees even though the Sherman Act — which should be the controlling statutory pronouncement on the issue — does not."" Defs.' 
Supp. Memo. at 6. As noted above,  [**15] I cannot ignore American Express III just because the Second Circuit did not 
expressly discuss the American Rule argument. In any case, Comcast's argument is unconvincing. American Express III does 
not require the parties to cover each other's fees. Instead, it merely protects access to statutory remedies. "
1421,4," The arbitration agreement itself only provides for filing fees. The arbitration agreement provides that ""Comcast will advance all 
arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the 
arbitration. You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or 
expert witnesses."" Defs.' Mot. to Compel, Ex. D at 10 (emphasis added). Moreover, if the arbitration concludes in Comcast's 
favor, Fromer is required to reimburse Comcast for the arbitration fees. Id. "
1424,1," In this subsection, the Court's citation to the ""Max FAC"" refers to the First Amended Complaint in the related case. In the 
sections that follow, a citation to the ""FAC"" should be understood to refer to the operative pleading in the present case. By the 
same token, the Court citation within this subsection to documents by ""Docket No."" likewise refer to the docket in the related 
case."
1424,2," And even more specifically, the 892 Patent claims a method to achieve weight loss in mammals (including humans) by 
decreasing the amount of blood leptin through dietary intake of ""viscous, water-soluable, non-nutritive, non-starch, indigestible 
polysaccharides."" Id. "
1425,3," Recently, on July 17, 2012, the Court stayed TriPharma's claims against Max Int'l pending adjudication of the present action."
1425,4," TriPharma requests the Court take judicial notice of the Superior Court's Order, as well as other documents. (See generally 
Request for Judicial Notice (""RJN"") (Docket No. 44) & Exhibits thereto.) The Court grants TriPharma's request. See Fed. R. 
Evid. 201 (judicial notice); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001) (courts may judicially notice public 
documents). "
1426,5," TriPharma also sued First Fruits Beverage Company LCC. The Court refers to these two Defendants collectively as ""First 
Fruits"". The Court refers separately to First Fruits Business Ministry, LLC as ""FFBM"" in connection with FFBM's Motion to 
Dismiss claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction. Where appropriate, First Fruits Beverage Company LLC is referred to 
separately as ""FF Beverage"". In addition to the entity Defendants, TriPharma asserts claims against individuals Roger J. Catarino (""Catarino"") and Greg Guss 
(""Guss""). Guss is Vice Present of Sales and Marketing for one of the First Fruits entities. (FAC ¶ 10.) Catarino is the President 
and Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") of both entities. (FAC ¶ 11.)"
1426,6," More specifically, TriPharma alleges that First Fruits ""falsely advertise[d] and label[ed] the consumer beverage TrimFit as the 
892 Product which was tested under"" studies conducted by UConn and UMinn (""the Studies""). (FAC ¶ 19.) Beyond the mere 
exclusive right to sell, market and distribute any products that are based on the 892 Patent, TriPharma also claims ""the exclusive 
right to refer to and utilize the Studies to sell, market[,] and distribute the 892 Product."" (Id. ¶ 19.)"
1426,7," Products can contain a number of different formulations of viscous polysaccharides. (FAC ¶ 18; cf. FAC Ex. A at 1 (""METHODS 
TO REDUCE BODY FAT"") & 4:41-44 (""Any water-soluble, non-nutritive, indigestible, non-starch, viscous polysaccharide 
available to one of skill in the art can be used in the compositions and methods of the invention."") "
1427,8," TriPharma refers to the ""False Marking Act"" and cites 15 U.S.C. § 292. (FAC at 15.) Elsewhere in the FAC, and in context, it 
becomes clear that TriPharma bases its claim on the Patent Act's prohibition against false marking."
1427,9," The traditional bases personal jurisdiction are service of a defendant in the forum state, consent of the defendant, and domicile 
of the defendant within the forum state. See Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604, 610-11, 110 S. Ct. 2105, 109 L. Ed. 2d 
631 (1990) (the party is served within the state); Nat'l Equip. Rental v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311, 316, 84 S. Ct. 411, 11 L. Ed. 2d "
1428,354," (1964) (the party consents); Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463, 61 S. Ct. 339, 85 L. Ed. 278 (1940) (the party is domiciled 
in the state). "
1429,10," With the Reply, Defendants offer the Supplemental Catarino Declaration to establish that Catarino's discussions with 
Dameshek were exclusively on behalf of FF Beverage and did not involve FFBM. (See Supp'l Catarino Decl. (Docket No. 55-1) ¶ 
12.) The emails between the two CEOs are admittedly lacking in specificity as to which First Fruits entity or entities would 
partner in the acquisition. Nevertheless, even assuming the initial emails to Dameshek were on behalf FF Beverage, Catarino 
has also acknowledged his actions on behalf of FFBM in acquiring the rights to the 892 Patent. (See RJN (Docket No. 44) Ex. 2 
(Catarino Decl.) ¶¶ 3-4.) "
1430,11," The Catarino Declaration was offered as part of an action filed in the Southern District of California to vacate the TriPharma-
Imagenetix arbitration award. The Court takes judicial notice of this document."
1430,12," Moreover, the Court notes that a number of factors weigh strongly in favor of a conclusion that the exercise of jurisdiction over 
FFBM is reasonable. Because FFBM is jointly represented by FF Beverage, which has not challenged the Court's jurisdiction, 
the burden of the FFBM defending in this forum is minimal, and this factor weighs strongly in favor of a finding of 
reasonableness. Moreover, the Court discerns no conflict with another state, and a strong interest in California in adjudicating 
the claims asserted against TriPharma, whose principal place of business is in the state. Thus, the third and fourth factors weigh 
in favor of a finding of reasonableness. Additionally, given this Court's familiarity with the present action, the TriPharma-
Imagenetix arbitration, and other related cases based upon rights to the 892 Patent, the fifth factor, related to judicial efficiency, 
weighs in favor of a finding of reasonableness. Finally, the sixth factor, related to the plaintiff's interest in convenient and 
effective relief, also weighs in favor of finding of reasonableness. Accordingly, on the merits, the Court also finds the exercise of 
personal jurisdiction reasonable. "
1432,13, The Court's analysis in footnote 12 is equally applicable to Catarino. 
1434,14," TriPharma has offered ample evidence that TrimFit Water is offered for sale in the forum state, but has failed to offer evidence, 
as opposed to mere representation, that it is offered for sale in the Central District of California. (See, e.g., Dameshek Decl. 
(Docket No. 69-1) ¶ 24 (referring to introduction of TrimFit Water to distributors that ""cover virtually all of the territory of 
California""). Nevertheless, given that Defendants do not contend otherwise, and that it indeed appears from the record that the 
product is distributed nationwide, the Court accepts this representation. "
1435,15," For a time, some doubt existed regarding the continuing viability of this alternative test; however, the Ninth Circuit recently 
removed that doubt, reaffirming the validity of this ""serious questions"" test. See Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 
1127, 1131-35 (9th Cir. 2011). "
1436,16," The present case does not, as suggested by Defendants, involve the limitation placed on the related doctrine of issue 
preclusion set forth in Vandenberg v. Superior Court, 21 Cal. 4th 815, 825, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 366, 982 P.2d 229, 234 (1999), 
which held that ""a private arbitration award, even if judicially confirmed, may not have nonmutual collateral estoppel effect under 
California law unless there was an agreement to that effect in the particular case."" Id.; cf. Murphy v. Murphy, 164 Cal. App. 4th 
376, 398, 78 Cal. Rptr. 3d 784 (2008) (differentiating between issue preclusion and claim preclusion). In setting forth its central 
holding regarding issue preclusion, the California Supreme Court expressly preserved existing California law regarding the claim 
preclusive effect of arbitration awards. Vandenberg, 21 Cal. 4th at 825 n.2 (""Nothing in our decision imposes or implies any 
limitations on the strict res judicata, or claim preclusive, effect of a California law private arbitration award."")"
1436,17," It is clear that this broad construction of ""cause of action"" likewise applies to arbitrated disputes. Thibodeau v. Crum, 4 Cal. 
App. 4th at 755 (noting, as to the scope of the claim preclusive effect to be given an arbitration award, ""arbitrating parties are 
obliged, . . . to place before their arbitrator all matters within the scope of the arbitration, related to the subject matter, and 
relevant to the issues."")."
1436,18," Defendants have presented evidence that Imagenetix has again purported to terminate the exclusive license based on 
TriPharma's failure to meet the minimum purchases requirement. (Opp'n at 12; Catarino Decl. (Docket No. 38) ¶¶ 21-22 & Ex. 
17 (letter from Imagenetix to TriPharma purporting to terminate exclusive license).) TriPharma has presented evidence that 
Imagenetix has refused to provide it with the product it has ordered, and that Imagenetix has refused to cooperate in permitting 
TriPharma to obtain products from a third-party supplier. (Dameshek Decl. (Docket No. 57) ¶¶ 3-4 & Ex. 10.) It appears that 
Imagenetix takes issue with TriPharma's use of the trademark ""Trisynex"", to which Imagenetix claims rights, in connection with 
TriPharma's order. (Id. Ex. 10 at 4 (April 25, 2012 email combining a purported repudiation of the arbitration award, an express 
refusal to fill TriPharma's purchase order, and a demand that TriPharma cease and desist use of the mark ""Trisynex""); cf. 
Catarino Decl. (Docket No. 38) Ex. 17 (Imagenetix's May 30, 2012 purported termination of agreement).) This issue was raised 
in post-hearing briefs, but the arbitrator refused to resolve it because it was not raised before the close of the hearing, and it 
appears to remain outstanding. (FAC Ex. C at 32-33.) Nevertheless, in light of the uncontroverted evidence that Imagenetix 
refused to provide the ordered product to TriPharma, the Court concludes that the purported termination of the exclusive license 
does not alter its analysis regarding the preliminary relief sought with the present motion. "
1437,19," For purposes of the present discussion, the Court assumes this point is a valid one. The Court does not express any opinion 
on the merits of this argument."
1437,20," Absent class members are given a pre-judgment opportunity to opt out. That FFBM had the benefit of an analogous post-
judgment option — one that could be exercised when the details of the adjudication are known and the consequences thereof 
can be assessed with greater clarity — makes even clearer that due process concerns are not implicated here. "
1440,21," Pursuant to Rule 65(d)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in addition to being applicable to the entities and 
individuals specifically identified above, upon notice, this injunction is also applicable to any individual or entity who acts jointly 
with or in concert with any one or more of them. "
1443,1," A complete factual history of this action is set forth in TruePosition, Inc. v. Ericsson, et al., No. 11-4574, 844 F. Supp. 2d 571, 
2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1646, 2012 WL 33075 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 6, 2012). Although this Memorandum Opinion is based upon the 
original Complaint, it gives a sound factual history of the action."
1443,2," Positioning technology"" refers to technology used to locate mobile handsets."
1443,3," In the United States, two major carriers (AT&T Wireless and T-Mobile) have implemented TruePosition LMUs at approximately 
90,000 cell sites."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 47.)"
1443,4," 3GPP is named as a defendant in this action. Truepositon only recently served the Amended Complaint on 3GPP. 3GPP filed a 
Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff TruePosition, Inc.'s Amended Complaint on August 15, 2012. (Doc. No. 131.) This Motion will be 
addressed at a later time. "
1444,5," ETSI was voluntarily dismissed from this action on August 10, 2012. (Doc. No. 130.) Prior to its dismissal, ETSI filed a Motion 
to Dismiss. (Doc. No. 102.) In their Joint Motion to Dismiss, the Corporate Defendants joined in ETSI's dismissal motion. (Doc. 
No. 103.) We find that the only novel issue that is relatable to  [*6] the Corporate Defendants is ETSI's argument concerning 
ripeness. We will address the ripeness issue at the end of this Memorandum Opinion. Infra Section IV.D."
1444,6," Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, federal question jurisdiction exists based upon the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
1448,7, RAN stands for Radio Access Network. (See Am. Compl. Glossary of Acronyms.) 
1449,8," ALU, which does not have essential patents in OTDOA, argues that it does not have a vested interest in excluding UTDOA 
from the 4G LTE Standard. (ALU's Supplemental Mem. Law Support Corp. Defs.' Joint Mot. to Dismiss Am. Compl. at 6.) ALU 
argues that it would benefit, not suffer, from having another option to put into its RAN equipment, particularly if, as TruePosition 
contends, the UTDOA option is desired by ALU customers (i.e., U.S. telecommunications carriers). (Id. at 7.) TruePosition 
counters ALU's argument by stating that ""[ALU] specifically sought to delay standardization until it could build UTDOA into its 
own RAN equipment; it successfully promoted standardization  [*26] of its preferred UTDOA configuration, not one it could 'buy' 
from TruePosition; and then it proposed to standardize UTDOA so that only a RAN equipment manufacturer like [ALU] could 
compete to make and sell UTDOA equipment."" (TruePosition's Opp'n to Joint Mot. to Dismiss Am. Comp. and Supplemental 
Mem. of ALU at 37.) "
1450,9," The 3GPP organizational structure relies on a Radio Access Network Technical Specification Group ('RAN TSG' or 'RAN 
Plenary') to create technical documents, known as 'Specifications,' for the structure and operation of RAN networks and 
equipment."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 36.) ""The RAN TSG consists of five Working Groups (RAN1 through RAN5), each covering different 
aspects of the network, that perform that technical work of evaluating proposed work items and developing the draft 
Specification."" (Id.) Updates to 3GPP Specifications are issued sequentially in a series of ""Releases."" (Id. ¶ 38.) The 
technologies and methods stated in each Release may build upon or add to a prior release. (Id.) When a Release is completed 
by 3GPP, it is adopted and promulgated as a standard by 3GPP's regional Organizational Partners. (Id.)"
1450,10," Release 11 of 3GPP's Specification for 4G LTE technology is to be completed, at its earliest, by September 2012. (Am. 
Compl. ¶ 91.) "
1451,11," Work Items are proposals to include technology features in 3GPP standards initially created through private discussions 
among members of a Working Group outside of the formal meeting context. (Id. ¶ 37.) In order to be considered by the RAN 
Plenary Group, a Work Item proposal must list the support of at least four members although Work Item proponents often have a 
longer list including companies that have no direct interest in the outcome  [*33] or do not intend to contribute to the project. (Id.)"
1451,12," In the Amended Complaint, TruePosition states that ""the Chairman of the Plenary Group and of each RAN Working Group has 
extraordinary authority to determine which technologies will be included in the Specification, and the order in and speed at which 
each element of the Specification must be drafted, reviewed, simulated, and completed."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 39.) ""Chairman 
positions are almost exclusively filled by representatives from major multinational telecommunications equipment manufacturers, 
such as the Corporate Defendants."" (Id. ¶ 40.) "
1452,13," Truepositon argues that the Qualcomm representative's denial of AT&T's request is an act against its own interest in 
furtherance of the conspiracy due to AT&T's significant power within the mobile telecommunications market. "
1453,14," Although the fact that ALU signed on to TruePositon's UTDOA Work Item does not alone negate all of the allegations of its 
involvement in an illegal conspiracy, we have given this fact serious consideration in our evaluation of TruePosition''s claims 
against ALU. "
1454,15," The November 2009 RAN1 Working Group meeting was an important meeting because it was supposed to be the final 
session before the cut-off for including technologies in Release 9. (Am. Comp. ¶ 81.) "
1460,16," TruePosition explains that ""[h]igh accuracy positioning capability is a necessary feature where required by government 
regulation or by a government request for proposals."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 125.) ""Certain governments require highly accurate 
positioning capability to promote public safety and to support domestic security and law enforcement."" (Id.) TruePosition states 
that customers for highly accurate positioning capability include wireless carriers and law enforcement. (Id.) "

1465,1," The factual background of this case  [*2] is well known to the parties and the court. We include only the salient facts here, and

nonprofit trade association of which all defendants are members. PhRMA was previously known as the Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers Association, or PMA. We use PhRMA throughout for consistency purposes. "
1467,4," Compare Quacchia v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1442, 1453, 19 Cal. Rptr. 3d 508 [""conduct can be 'unfair'

1468,5," The record contains an ""Order regarding February 1, 2005 Case Management Conference"" in which Judge Sabraw noted that

1472,10," Plaintiffs had previously filed separate opposition to the Amgen motion. It was supported by a separate statement disputing 
Amgen's material facts, a request for judicial notice of six assorted  [*30] documents, and a declaration of plaintiffs' counsel 
Russell F. Brasso attaching 24 exhibits. "
1473,11," Plaintiffs also filed a peremptory challenge pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6. The challenge was denied on 
the ground that they previously filed a successful section 170.6 challenge to the Honorable Jon S. Tigar. "
1474,12," Judge D'Opal subsequently struck this second supplement ""as no facts suggesting new grounds for disqualification learned of 
or arising after the filing of the first statement of disqualification [were] presented therein."""
1474,13," The only newly-filed paper appears to be defendants' joint objections to plaintiffs' evidence, filed on January 28, 2011. "
1480,14," Plaintiffs contended below that the ""purported substitution"" was ""defective for three reasons"" and that Covington was still 
counsel of record when the matter was assigned to Judge Brick. Judge D'Opal rejected this contention, concluding that 
""sufficient evidence supports the basic fact that Covington was not 'a lawyer in the proceeding' when the Presiding Judge 
assigned this case to Judge Brick  [*58] for all purposes . . . ."" Plaintiffs do not challenge this conclusion on appeal. "
1481,15," It should be recalled that plaintiffs had first sought to continue the motion on November 13, 2006, by a request to Judge 
Sabraw. Judge Sabraw denied it, a ruling that plaintiffs unsuccessfully challenged by writ petition. Plaintiffs' opposition to the 
merits motions also contained a 437c(h) request. "
1482,16," In a similar vein, Judge Sabraw had earlier observed that whatever deficiencies plaintiffs asserted in discovery, it was their 
own fault. As he put it, ""Plaintiffs have had an adequate opportunity to prepare their case and develop evidence to oppose the 
motions for summary judgment,"" including ""the opportunity to depose the persons responsible for setting prices."" "
1486,17," The Cartwright Act is patterned after the federal Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), and decisions under the latter 
are applicable to the former. (Corwin v. Los Angeles Newspaper Service Bureau, Inc. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 842, 852, 94 Cal. Rptr. 
785, 484 P.2d 953.) "
1487,18," The Aguilar opinion brought California in line with Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp. (1986) 475 U.S. 574, 
106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538, in which the United States Supreme Court set forth how courts should analyze summary 
judgment motions involving claims under the Sherman Act, as well as companion cases Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. (1986) 
477 U.S. 242, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 and Celotex Corp. v. Catrett (1986) 477 U.S. 317, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 
265. (Aguilar, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 848.) Doing so, Aguilar liberalized the granting of summary judgment in California. (Ibid.; 
Nazir, supra, 178 Cal.App.4th at pp. 248, 285.) "
1490,19," Plaintiffs argued below that defendants failed to meet their initial burden because their evidence consisted merely of ""bald 
denials"" that they engaged in collusive behavior. This, they argued, was insufficient under Aguilar. As is seen from the foregoing, 
plaintiffs' description was myopic. The evidence did more than baldly assert that defendants set their prices independently—it 
established that prices were independently determined, based upon defendants' individual market analyses which generally 
utilized public information. In any event, plaintiffs do not reiterate this argument on appeal, which we construe as a concession 
that defendants' evidence satisfied their initial burden of production."
1490,20," Plaintiffs variously describe this conspiracy in their opening brief: ""to voluntarily restrain their price increases""; ""to not increase 
their prices in excess of the CPI""; ""to hold . . . the increase in the weighted average of changes in the net prices . . . to an 
approximate level not greater than . . . the Consumer Price Index""; ""to limit [a company's] price increases, if any, on the entire 
line of its prescription drug products in any calendar year to an amount not to exceed the increase in the CPI""; ""to peg future 
price increases to the CPI""; to keep  [*97] ""prices in line with the CPI or CPI plus 1 to two-and-a-half percent."" And it appears 
that at some point, plaintiffs' theory morphed into a conspiracy to use the CPI as a floor, rather than a ceiling."
1490,21," As discussed above, Judge Brick properly sustained defendants' objections to all documents pertaining to the ""Pledge."" We 
discuss these documents to provide context for plaintiffs' opposition, not because they have any evidentiary value."
1490,22, The request was ultimately denied. 
1491,23," In their reply brief, plaintiffs attempt to justify this omission: ""Plaintiffs do not contend that the 'pledge injured them, as indeed it 
is hard to see how a maximum price agreement hurt the pharmacists. This in itself explains why the 'pledge' or 'CPI' was not 
mentioned in the [third amended complaint] . . . ."" "
1492,24," In a case management order ten days later, Judge Sabraw reiterated that  [*106] in their third amended complaint ""Plaintiffs 
are encouraged to clarify whether their claim is that Defendants agreed not to sell drugs in California for below the Canada price 
(but permit independent competition above that floor) or to sell drugs for fixed prices above the Canada price (so the price in "
1493,," California would fluctuate in tandem with the Canada price) or to sell drugs for fixed prices (that happen to be above the Canada 
price) or some combination of these theories."" "
1494,25," Plaintiffs had previously sought to reopen Dolan's apex deposition on other grounds. In an August 28, 2006 order denying that 
request, Judge Sabraw observed, ""The Court will presume for this motion that the allegedly collusive and illegal settlement 
between Bristol Myers Squibb and Apotex is relevant to the claims in this case. The Court notes, however, that the claims in this 
case concern an alleged multilateral conspiracy among the defendants to not sell drugs in California below the Canada price. 
The claims in this case do not encompass every potentially unlawful action that any of the defendants may have engaged in for 
the purpose of obtaining higher prices for their products."" "
1495,26," Plaintiffs apparently had at least two warnings that there appeared to be a disconnect between the conspiracy alleged in the 
third amended complaint and the conspiracy argued in their opposition to the merits motions. As Judge Brick explained in his 
order granting the merits motions: ""[O]ne of the court's last orders before the summary judgment motions were originally set to 
be heard in December 2006 expressly declined to resolve 'whether or in what circumstances  [*118] Plaintiffs might be required 
to amend their Complaint if the evidence supports claims that are different from the ones asserts in the Third amended 
Complaint.' [Citation.] Then, before the February 11 hearings, this Court's tentative ruling asked Plaintiffs to explain where the 
CPI theory is pleaded."" Despite this, plaintiffs never requested leave to amend, electing instead to hang their hats on their 
insistence that the third amended complaint encompassed the CPI theory. "
1496,27," Again, plaintiffs do not dispute defendants' representation."
1496,28," It is perhaps the case that any attempt to amend would fail because the proposed claim would be subject to demurrer as being 
barred by collateral estopped. (Yee v. MobileHome Park Rental Review Bd. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1409, 1429, 73 Cal. Rptr. 2d 
227; see generally Foxborough v. Van Atta (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 217, 230, 31 Cal. Rptr. 2d 525 [proposed amendment barred 
by statute of limitations and no basis for ""relation back""].) Specifically: In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., supra, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1735, 2000 WL 204064  [*120] (In re Brand 
Name) was a suit by a nationwide class of retail pharmacies against wholesalers and manufacturers of brand name prescription 
drugs alleging violations of the Sherman Act, 15 United States Code section 1 et seq. As described by the district court: ""Class 
Plaintiffs claim that Defendants entered into a conspiracy to deny them discounts and to peg any future price increases to gains 
in the Consumer Price Index ('CPI')."" (In re Brand Name, supra, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1735, [WL] at *1.) Describing plaintiffs' 
proposed methodology as ""ill-defined and vague"" and ""neither capable of evaluation nor meaningful analysis"" (2000 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 1735, [WL] at *4), the district court concluded that plaintiffs presented no evidence that they were injured by the CPI 
conspiracy or that would support a jury's award of damages to compensate for any injury (2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1735, [WL] at 
*5) and that plaintiffs demonstrated no basis for the entry of an injunction. Defendants claimed below that the issue litigated in In re Brand Name and the CPI theory belatedly asserted by plaintiffs are 
identical, and that the CPI issue was decided unfavorably to plaintiffs there. At the hearing on the merits motions, defendants 
represented, and plaintiffs did not dispute—and indeed, at oral  [*121] argument here conceded—that plaintiffs here were all 
class members in the In re Brand Name case, and that one of the plaintiffs here was also a named plaintiff there. Thus, 
defendants argue that collateral estoppel would apply. (See Pacific Lumber Co. v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2006) 37 
Cal.4th 921, 943, 38 Cal. Rptr. 3d 220, 126 P.3d 1040.) This issue was not fully developed or briefed below, and is not 
necessary to our decision. We thus do not decide it here."
1496,29," Defendants contend that plaintiffs have abandoned this theory in favor of the CPI theory. They cite plaintiffs' lead counsel's 
statement at the hearing on the pass-on motions  [*123] that ""There is an outstanding agreement to fix prices. . . . By the way, it 
looks like the floor is CPI, not Canada. CPI long left Canada. But now it's CPI."" This contention is contrary to plaintiffs' 
representation at the hearing on the merits motions, as well as in their briefs on appeal, that they are still pursing the Canadian 
floor conspiracy. "
1497,30," While plaintiffs claim on appeal that Rost's testimony is so significant that it defeats summary judgment, they did not even 
mention him in their opposition below, nor cite his testimony in their separate statement of facts. This failure alone is reason 
enough for us to disregard it. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(3).) "
1498,31," As discussed ante, plaintiffs challenge Judge Brick's evidentiary rulings only as to three specific exhibits—1, 111, 117—a 
challenge we concluded was without merit."
1498,32," We need not consider whether Amgen, PhRMA, and JJHCS were entitled to separate summary judgments. "
1509,1," There were no objections to the documentary evidence received, and no Daubert motions were filed. Reliability objections to 
the testimony of plaintiff's economic expert are addressed and rejected in this Memorandum. "
1511,2," As detailed in Section II.D, infra, plaintiffs presented evidence that Ortho did not charge the BBLP prices to any customer until 
after it allegedly engaged in unlawful price-related conversations with Immucor. At the class certification hearing, the parties 
disputed the probative value of a slide contained in an October 30, 2000, Ortho presentation regarding the BBLP. The slide is 
labeled ""Communication with Customers,"" and it lists the names of seven major customers alongside dates ranging from 
September 27, 2000, to October 20, 2000. (Pls.' Mot. Ex. 56, at 5.) The record contains no evidence regarding the nature of any 
communications between Ortho and those customers. Ortho contends that the slide establishes that it had already 
 [**11] implemented the BBLP prior to the alleged price-fixing conspiracy, which plaintiffs contend began in November 2000. 
Plaintiffs argue that, even if Ortho engaged in some kind of discussion with select customers in September and October of 2000, 
Ortho did not finalize the BBLP until after its allegedly unlawful communications with Immucor. On the present state of the "
1512,," record, the Court finds that the slide does not establish that Ortho implemented the BBLP before the AABB meeting, which 
began on November 4, 2000."
1512,3," At the class certification hearing, Ortho provided the Court with the Supplemental Declarations of Mike Poynter and Bill Weiss, 
two Immucor executives. In those declarations, Poynter and Weiss aver that they do not ""remember anything being said during 
[Ortho's] presentation about a 2001 price increases or anything about Ortho's future pricing plans."" (Supp. Poynter Decl. ¶ 8; see 
also Supp. Weiss Decl. ¶ 5.) However, other Immucor employees who attended the AABB meeting testified to the contrary. "
1513,4," The Court dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Ortho's parent company, Johnson & Johnson Health Care Systems. See In re 
Blood Reagents Antitrust Litig., 756 F. Supp. 2d 623, 633 (E.D. Pa. 2010). "
1514,5," The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Behrend on June 25, 2012. See 133 S. Ct. 24, 183 L. Ed. 2d 673, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 
4754, 80 U.S.L.W. 3707 (U.S. June 25, 2012) (No. 11-864). "
1520,6," At the class certification hearing, Dr. Bronsteen testified that the evidence regarding whether TBR are commodities is ""mixed."" 
(7/26/12 Hr'g Tr. 182.) He argued that differences in the prices of Ortho's and Immucor's TBR during the class period show that 
some customers preferred one defendant's TBR to the other. (Id. at 182-83.) However, Dr. Beyer's analysis shows that, even if 
Ortho and Immucor prices were not identical for all products, they were similar. (See, e.g., Beyer Reply fig.1.) Moreover, Dr. 
Bronsteen compares average prices charged by Immucor and Ortho. Those average prices are very similar through 2004. (See 
Bronsteen Report Exs. 9A-9D.)  [**40] The Court concludes that divergence in prices after 2004 is explained, at least in part, by 
the discounts Immucor gave some of its customers through price protection and pricing tiers. "
1521,7," HN22[
] Variation in the prices paid by individual customers does not preclude a finding of predominance. See, e.g., K-Dur,"
1521,686," F.3d 197, 2012 WL 2877662, at *19-20; McDonough, 638 F. Supp. 2d at 486. However, plaintiffs must be able to account 
for such variation using common proof— which they have persuaded the Court that they will be able to do in this case. See infra 
Part IV.B.1.c.3.i. "
1523,8," HN25[
] Even at the merits stage, plaintiffs need not measure damages with complete certainty, because courts recognize 
the ""inherent difficulty of identifying a 'but-for world.'"" Behrend, 655 F.3d at 203. At the merits stage, plaintiffs must demonstrate 
damages only ""as 'a matter of just and reasonable inference.'"" Id. (quoting Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper 
Co., 282 U.S. 555, 563, 51 S. Ct. 248, 75 L. Ed. 544 (1931)). "
1524,9," For the same reason, the parties agree that it would be difficult to apply multiple regression analysis, another technique often 
used to isolate anticompetitive effects, reliably in this case. (See Beyer Reply ¶ 52-53; 7/26/12 Hr'g Tr. 164-66.)"
1524,10," Dr. Beyer also presents a variation  [**56] on this methodology in which he adjusts the size of the but-for price increases of 
individual TBR products to reflect the distribution of actual price increases on different TBR products. (Beyer Reply ¶ 74.) The 
weighted average price increase, however, remains 25%. (Id.)"
1524,11," At the class certification hearing, Dr. Bronsteen testified that it did not make sense for the 25% price increases to stop after 
five years. In his opinion, defendants would have continued raising prices in the but-for world ""until they reach[ed] the level of 
[the prices actually charged]."" (7/26/12 Hr'g Tr. 194.) Dr. Bronsteen oversimplifies this point. There are a number of reasons that 
the price obtained by noncolluding duopolists might be lower than that obtained by a cartel. See, e.g., IIB Areeda et al., supra, at 
¶ 405c (""[W]ith any market of given structural and other characteristics, the probability of effective cooperation in raising price 
and restricting output is much greater with express collusion than with mere reliance on recognized interdependence.""); In re 
High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., 295 F.3d 651, 656 (7th Cir. 2002) (Posner, J.) (""[S]ellers would not bother to fix list 
prices if they  [**57] thought there would be no effect on transaction prices."")."
1524,12," Dr. Beyer uses Immucor's standard costs for both defendants because  [**58] Ortho has represented that its cost data is 
unreliable. Because both defendants manufactured the same products from similar raw materials and were subject to the same 
regulations, Immucor's costs are a reasonable proxy for Ortho's costs. (Beyer Reply ¶ 56.) At the very least, using Immucor's 
standard costs is sufficient to ""give 'a reasonable estimate' of damages. And nothing more is required."" McDonough, 638 F. 
Supp. 2d at 491 (quoting Rossi v. Standard Roofing, Inc., 156 F.3d 452, 484 (3d Cir. 1998)). "
1526,13," Dr. Bronsteen also testified at the certification hearing that he ""suspect[ed]"" that if Dr. Beyer made this type of adjustment, but-
for prices would fall below average prices and plaintiffs would be unable to prevail on the merits. (7/26/12 Hr'g Tr. 197.) The 
Court notes that Dr. Bronsteen did not perform any analysis to support his suspicion. More fundamentally, HN29[
] ""a district 
court has limited authority to examine the merits when conducting the certification inquiry""; the ""ability of the named plaintiff to 
succeed on his or her individual claims has never been a prerequisite to certification of the class."" Sullivan, 667 F.3d at 305."
1526,14," In his original Report, Dr. Beyer stated that the first increase in but-for prices would occur in 2000. (Beyer Report ¶ 95.) His 
Reply Report shifts the first increase to 2001. (Beyer Reply ¶ 73.) Ortho contends that this change makes Dr. Beyer's 
methodology ""even more ad hoc and speculative."" (Def.'s Surreply 11.) However, Dr. Beyer provides  [**66] a persuasive 
explanation for the change. He explains that he shifted the first but-for price increase because the alleged price-fixing conspiracy 
did not begin to impact customers until 2001; neither defendant imposed its substantial price increases until early 2001. (Beyer "
1527,," Reply ¶ 73.) Thus, since plaintiffs do not allege that prices increased in 2000 due to unlawful collusion, ""it is more accurate for 
but-for prices to equal actual prices in 2000 and to have but-for prices only start diverging from actual prices in 2001."" (Id.)"
1527,15," On the present  [**69] state of the record, the Court is not entirely persuaded by Dr. Beyer's explanation for why he uses 
RhoGAM as a yardstick only when the RhoGAM market had three competitors. However, that issue does not require the Court 
to reject the RhoGAM yardstick at the certification stage. "
1528,16," Ortho argues in its surreply brief that requiring it to litigate individual plaintiffs' fraudulent concealment defenses in separate 
damages proceedings would ""infringe Ortho's substantive rights and thereby violate the Rules Enabling Act."" (Def.'s Surreply 22-
23.) Ortho cites two cases for this proposition: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011), and 
Hohider v. United Parcel Service, Inc., 574 F.3d 169 (3d Cir. 2009). Neither case supports Ortho's argument. In Dukes, the Supreme Court held that it would violate the Rules Enabling Act to calculate individual plaintiffs' damages by 
applying a formula, without conducting any ""individualized proceedings."" 131 S. Ct. at 2561. That is very different from the 
procedure envisioned in this case, in which each individual plaintiff would  [**73] be required to show that it was entitled to tolling 
of the statute of limitations. In Hohider, the district court erroneously concluded that it did not need to determine whether individual employment-
discrimination plaintiffs were qualified for their jobs in order to determine whether they were entitled to relief. 574 F.3d at 198. 
Based on that conclusion, the court certified a class under Rule 23(b)(2). The Third Circuit reversed, holding that an 
individualized analysis of each plaintiff's qualifications was, in fact, necessary to the adjudication of their claims and was 
fundamentally ""incompatible with the requirements of Rule 23."" Id. at 196. In this case, in contrast, there is no question that the 
essential elements of plaintiffs' claims and each plaintiff's entitlement to tolling of the statute of limitations will be adjudicated on 
the merits. Moreover, unlike in Hohider, analysis of those issues in a class action is compatible with the requirements of Rule 23. 
See, e.g., Linerboard, 305 F.3d at 163. "
1532,1," Font alleges that I have violated the Constitution and am partial to defendants' attorneys and requests my recusal. (See Docket 
No. 110; Docket No. 112, p. 2; Docket No. 113, p. 3; Docket No. 116, p. 2). ""Any . . . magistrate judge of the United States shall 
disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned,"" or ""[w]here he has a personal bias 
or prejudice concerning a party . . . ."" 28 U.S.C. §§ 455(a), 455(b)(1). Under § 455(a), recusal is required ""only if the charge 
against [the judge] is supported by a factual foundation and the facts provide what an objective, knowledgeable member of the 
public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality."" In re United States (Franco), 158 F.3d 26, 30 
(1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The words ""bias or prejudice"" in § 455(b)(1) ""connote a favorable 
or unfavorable disposition or opinion that is somehow wrongful or inappropriate . . . ."" Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 550 
(1994). Importantly, ""[t]he trial judge has a duty not to recuse himself or herself if there is no objective basis for recusal."" In re 
United States (Vásquez-Botet), 441 F.3d 44, 67 (1st Cir. 2006). Moreover, ""judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid 
basis for a bias or partiality motion . . . ."" Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555-56. Judge Besosa already denied Font's first request for my recusal (Docket No. 111), but since § 455 calls for self-disqualification, I 
will nonetheless briefly consider the other motions. Font does not plainly state the reason he believes I am partial to the defense 
attorneys, making it difficult to assess his position. As each motion is accompanied by requests to deny the pending motions to 
dismiss and set the case for trial, the best inference I can draw is that Font is relying on the mere fact that his requests have not 
been granted. However, that fact is in the nature of ordinary case management and judicial determination, and does not on its 
own suggest any ""wrongful or inappropriate"" predisposition. See Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555-56. Because Font has not alleged 
anything that would establish even the objective appearance of partiality, his pending requests for my recusal are denied. "

Apr. 12, 2000). "
1540,3," I do not address the insurance defendants' res judicata arguments for two reasons. First, since supplemental jurisdiction is not 
proper, analyzing an affirmative defense would invite decision on a Commonwealth-law controversy that is not before this court. 
In any case, the insurance defendants filed only untranslated Spanish-language documents from the Commonwealth courts. 
This violates Local Rule 5(g), and considering such documents to decide a res judicata defense could be reversible error. See 
Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party v. Dalmau, 544 F.3d 58, 67 (1st Cir. 2008). "
1552,1," In addition to the named Defendants, Plaintiffs have named several co-conspirators, including, inter alia, Tronox Inc. (""Tronox"") 
and The National Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd. (d/b/a ""Cristal""). Tronox filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 
2009, and is therefore precluded from being named as a defendant. See 11 U.S.C. § 362(a).  [**6] Plaintiffs originally sought to 
include Cristal as a named defendant in this case, but this Court dismissed Cristal for want of jurisdiction on March 31, 2011. 
See Mem. Op. and Order, ECF Nos. 101 & 102. Subsequently, Plaintiffs have sought formal reconsideration of that decision on 
two occasions. On April 3, 2012, this Court denied the Plaintiffs first motion for reconsideration by Memorandum Order (ECF No. 
268). At the August 13, 2012 Class Certification hearing, this Court again denied the Plaintiffs' request to add Cristal as a 
defendant. See Order, ECF No. 332."
1552,2," Plaintiffs originally defined the Class Period as beginning in March of 2002. Plaintiffs  [**8] have since modified the Class 
Period to begin on February 1, 2003 because ""[t]he evidence shows that while the Cartel behavior began as early as 2002, it 
does not appear to have become fully effective until February 2003. [citation omitted] As a result, and to be conservative, "
1553,," Plaintiffs propose to delay the start of the Class period until February 1, 2003, despite the evidence of illegal antitrust activity 
before that date."" Pls.' Class Mem. at 3 n.2, ECF No. 247. "
1557,3," In their Class Opposition Memorandum, Defendants make the same arguments for both the typicality and adequacy of 
representation prongs of Rule 23. See Defs.' Class Opp'n at 42-46. Because the typicality inquiry ""tend[s] to merge with the 
adequacy of representation requirement,"" Falcon, 457 U.S. at 158 n.13, the Court will address these elements together. "
1558,4," To the extent that this argument overlaps with the predominance inquiry relating to impact, that argument will be addressed 
infra."
1558,5, See supra note 4.
1558,6," HN10[
] Pursuant to the 2003 amendments to Rule 23,  [**29] the Court's inquiry into the qualifications and experience of Plaintiffs' counsel are no longer investigated under Rule 23(a), but instead are to be determined under Rule 23(g). See infra at 
Section IV for that discussion. "
1559,7," At the August 13, 2012 class certification hearing, the parties did not introduce live expert  [**32] testimony—instead, they 
introduced excerpts of deposition testimony, and excerpts of the expert declarations."
1559,8," For example, Dr. John Beyer, a frequent plaintiffs' expert in class certification cases, has outlined the relevant market factors 
used to prove common impact in The Role of Economics in Class Certification and Class-Wide Impact, in LITIGATING 
CONSPIRACY:  [**34] AN ANALYSIS OF COMPETITION CLASS ACTIONS (Stephen Pitel ed. 2006). "
1560,9," See John H. Johnson & Gregory K. Leonard, Economics and the Rigorous Analysis of Class Certification in Antitrust Cases, 3 
J. COMPETITION L. & ECON., 341, 344-345 (2007) (taking issue with the ""prototypical plaintiffs' argument and arguing that ""the 
requirement of common proof of antitrust injury should usually present a substantial hurdle for plaintiffs.""). "
1561,10," ""Interchangeability implies that one product is roughly equivalent to another for the use to which it is put; while there may be 
some degree of preference for one over the other, either would work effectively."" Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc., 
124 F.3d 430, 437 (3d Cir. 1997)  [**40] (citation omitted)."
1561,11," Required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Form 10-K is a comprehensive annual report summarizing a 
company's performance and financial condition. "
1562,12," This conclusion relates only to the commodity-like nature of TiO2. Defendants' arguments that pricing for TiO2 is determined by 
individual negotiations and varied contract terms  [**42] will be discussed in the predominance section infra. "
1563,13," This elements involves two distinct questions: ""One is the familiar factual question whether the plaintiff has indeed suffered 
harm, or 'injury-in-fact.' The other is the legal question whether any such injury is 'injury of the type the antitrust laws were 
intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants' acts unlawful."" Cordes & Co. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. A.G. 
Edwards & Sons, Inc., 502 F.3d 91, 106 (quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 
50 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977)). Because Plaintiffs in this case allege only one injury—that they were subjected  [**48] to artificially 
inflated prices for TiO2 as a result of a price-fixing conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act—the Defendants do 
not challenge this element. See Cordes, 502 F.3d at 107 (""Because each class member allegedly suffered the same type of 
injury, the legal question of whether such an injury is 'of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from 
that which makes defendants' acts unlawful,' Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 489, is a common one.""). Accordingly, the legal question of 
injury is common to the class, and this Court will focus on the first prong of the impact analysis—whether the class members 
suffered ""injury-in-fact."" "
1565,14," The EPDM court made this statement in the context of evaluating the damages prong of the predominance inquiry. However, it 
is equally applicable on the ""impact"" prong as well. "
1566,15," Dr. Lamb notes that his model is ""preliminary, given that discovery is ongoing."" He states that he is ""highly confident that a 
model similar to this one will be capable of showing the degree to which prices were artificially inflated as a result of the Cartel 
and computing aggregate overcharges to the Class as a whole at trial."" Lamb Report ¶ 82. "

NER Data Products, Inc. (""NER"") are three remanufacturers who have purchased microchips from Static Control for Lexmark 
toner cartridges and were once third-party defendants to the suit. They are not parties to the appeal."
1582,3," In comparison, Static Control claims that the price of Hewlett Packard toner cartridges fell during the same period because 
Hewlett Packard does not employ a similar ""Prebate"" program and remanufacturers are able to occupy a larger share of the 
aftermarket for Hewlett Packard toner. "
1585,4," Static Control concedes that ""a party cannot recover more than the value of the bond for injunction-related damages."" First 
Appellant Br. at 25 & n.10 (citing Mich. AFSCME Council 25, Local 1640 v. Matrix Human Servs., 589 F.3d 851, 860 (6th Cir.

1587,5," Lexmark argued  [**26] below that the relevant market was the larger primary market for all brands of laser printer cartridges 
and parts, not just the aftermarket for Lexmark products. The jury in its advisory findings sided with Static Control. R. 1366 
(Special Verdict Form at 15). On appeal, Lexmark does not concede its position on the relevant market, but argues against 
standing using the aftermarket. Second Appellee Br. at 40. "
1588,6," Specifically, Static Control complains that Lexmark engaged in anticompetitive conduct by creating two classes of otherwise 
identical cartridges, Prebate and non-Prebate, selling the non-Prebate cartridges at artificially inflated prices, falsely invoking 
patent rights to prevent remanufacturers from repairing Prebate cartridges, and engaging in other threatening behavior. "
1590,7, The district court did not explicitly discuss the potential for duplicative recovery. 
1592,8," Static Control claims Lexmark's Noerr-Pennington argument is waived as it was not raised below and was raised on appeal 
only in a footnote. Third Appellant Br. at 7 n.3. However, HN17[
] ""standing is a jurisdictional requirement that cannot be 
waived, and such may be brought up at any time in the proceeding."" Zurich Ins. Co. v. Logitrans, Inc., 297 F.3d 528, 531 (6th 
Cir. 2002)."
1592,9, The Lanham Act provides: 
1593,," HN20[
] Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services,  [**46] or any container for goods, uses in 
commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or 
misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which (A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of 
such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or 
commercial activities by another person, or (B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of 
his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities, shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act."
1593,15, U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1). 
1594,10," Even if we were to adopt the AGC factors, Static Control's claim would not necessarily fail. Although we have determined that 
Static Control failed to satisfy the AGC factors regarding its antitrust allegations, this does not necessarily mean Lanham Act 
standing would be lacking. Not all of Lexmark's conduct supposedly in violation of the Lanham Act is the same as the conduct 
supposedly violating the Sherman Act. In particular, Static Control alleges that Lexmark violated the Lanham Act when Lexmark 
falsely advertised that Static  [**51] Control infringed Lexmark's patents. Because this was not part of Static Control's antitrust 
allegations, the district court at a minimum should have applied the AGC factors to Static Control's allegations of false 
advertising directly targeting Static Control (not just the Prebate program) and its injuries in conducting the five-factor analysis."
1594,11," The district court also dismissed the state-law civil-conspiracy claim for lack of standing; however, Static Control has not 
raised this issue on appeal. Static Control mentioned in a footnote in its opening brief that the district court also erred in 
dismissing its state-law civil-conspiracy claim. First Appellant Br. at 56 n.14. Lexmark then pointed out the waiver, Second 
Appellee Br. at 62, and Static Control did not dispute the waiver or make any arguments on either waiver or the civil-conspiracy 
claim in its Third  [**52] Brief. "
1595,12," Static Control is right that if a district court erroneously dismisses a legal claim otherwise entitled to a jury determination, any 
subsequent findings of fact by the judge must be vacated and the claim relitigated before a jury. Lytle v. Household Mfg., Inc., 
494 U.S. 545, 552-53, 110 S. Ct. 1331, 108 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1990). That procedural posture, however, is not present in this case. 
Nonetheless, when a party has the right to a jury determination on an issue under the Seventh Amendment, there is ample "
1596,," precedent that an advisory jury does not satisfy that requirement. See Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 337 n. 24, 
99 S. Ct. 645, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1979) (""[A]n advisory jury . . . would not in any event have been a Seventh Amendment jury.""). "
1599,13," The jury instructions later also define exhaustion as Static Control's burden, using the exact same categories of cartridges the 
jury was previously instructed did not ""directly infringe."" R. 1365 (Jury Instructions at 25-26)."
1599,14," Lexmark suggests on appeal that the entirety of the jury's verdict on inducement was ""unreasonable and against the weight of 
the evidence."" Second Appellee Br. at 32. This argument, however, is briefed in the context of the excluded opinion-of-counsel 
letter and only further elaborated upon in Reply. Despite Lexmark's apparent waiver of this issue, the merits of the sufficiency-of-
the-evidence argument is discussed herein due to its relevance to the opinion-of-counsel issue. "
1600,15," Static Control's general counsel had previously obtained a legal opinion letter regarding the illegality of Lexmark's Prebate 
program under principles of property and contract law. Static Control provided this letter to its customers as assurance that 
""Prebate does not create any legal barrier to the purchase and reuse by others of 'prebate' cartridges."" J.A. at 1280 (Letter from 
Static Control). The letter from counsel stated that it ""does not deal with the application of either patent law or antitrust law"" to 
Lexmark's Prebate program. However, despite this assertion, the letter includes a short paragraph stating that counsel ""see[s] 
nothing in either area of [patent or antitrust] law that would raise any questions  [**74] about my conclusion [and] there are 
doctrines in both areas of law that might well prevent the successful adoption by any manufacturer"" of a program to prevent 
reuse of toner cartridges. Id. at 1286. "
1601,16," North Carolina passed a law in October 2003 that Static Control believed made Prebate restrictions unenforceable in North 
Carolina. The jury was instructed that these cartridges could not infringe. R. 1365 (Jury Instructions at 19). "
1603,17," Lexmark relies heavily on the district court's statement that ""Lexmark fail[ed] to set forth any evidence,"" R. 1008 (D. Ct. Order 
4/24/07 at 15). The district court recited at length Static Control's burden and applied it to the facts. Id. at 9-15. The district court 
appears to have been emphasizing that Lexmark's suggestion that there were open issues of fact was unsupported by any 
actual evidence. "
1605,1," For clarification, the Court notes that the Plaintiffs to this lawsuit are referred to collectively as either ""Plaintiffs"" or ""Cellular 
South"" throughout this memorandum opinion."
1605,2," The Court notes that it has reviewed the case law supplemented by Plaintiffs on August 22, 2012 [98]. "
1606,3," 4G is the successor to 3G and 2G technologies and, according to Plaintiffs, is intended eventually to supplant those standards."
1606,4," See Golden Bridge Technology, Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 547 F.3d 266, 269 (5th Cir. 2008) (The 3GPP ""institutes uniform 
technology standards for the telecommunications industry to ensure worldwide compatibility of cellular devices and systems. 
More than 260 companies belong to 3GPP, representing all levels of the cell phone industry. The 3GPP members are 
responsible for creating and developing the 3GPP standard, which means determining what technologies will be included in the 
standard as either mandatory or optional features"")."
1606,5, Band Class 17 was originally labeled Band Class 15. 
1607,6," The doctrine of primary jurisdiction operates, when applicable, to postpone judicial consideration of a case until an agency with 
special competence in the area makes a determination regarding a particular issue involved in the case. Mercury Motor Express, 
Inc. v. Brinke, 475 F.2d 1086, 1092-93 (5th Cir. 1973). The doctrine ""applies where a claim is originally cognizable in the courts, 
and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues which, under a regulatory scheme, 
have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case the judicial process is suspended 
pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views."" United States v. Western Pac. R.R., 352 U.S. 59, 63-64, 
77 S. Ct. 161, 1 L. Ed. 2d 126, 135 Ct. Cl. 997 (1956);  [**10] see also Wagner & Brown v. ANR Pipeline Co., 837 F.2d 199, 201 
(5th Cir. 1988)."
1607,7," As discussed supra, ""Auction 73"" happened in 2008, when the FCC licensed rights in the 700  [**11] MHz spectrum, including 
the Lower A, B, and C Blocks. "
1610,8," Iqbal illustrated its analysis of the first prong as follows: We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth. 
Respondent pleads that petitioners ""knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [him]"" to harsh 
conditions of confinement ""as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no 
legitimate penological interest."" Complaint ¶ 96, App. to Pet. for Cert. 173a-174a. The complaint alleges that Ashcroft was 
the ""principal architect"" of this invidious policy, id., ¶ 10, at 157a, and that Mueller was ""instrumental"" in adopting and 
executing it, id., ¶ 11, at 157a. These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in Twombly, amount to nothing 
more than a ""formulaic recitation of the elements"" of a constitutional discrimination claim, 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 
167 L. Ed. 2d 929,  [**22] namely, that petitioners adopted a policy "" 'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects 
upon an identifiable group ."" Feeney, 442 U.S., at 279, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 60 L. Ed. 2d 870. As such, the allegations are 
conclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. Twombly, supra, 550 U.S., at 554-555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929. 
To be clear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical. We do not so 
characterize them any more than the Court in Twombly rejected the plaintiffs' express allegation of a ""'contract, combination 
or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,'"" id. at 551, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929, because it thought that claim too 
chimerical to be maintained. It is the conclusory nature of respondent's allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful 
nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth. Id. at 1951. "
1611,9," Plaintiffs contend that the Court ""need not make the determination about whether the per se or rule of reason applies at this 
juncture since that question need not be decided the context of the current motions."" The Court agrees. See TruePosition, Inc. v. 
LM Ericsson Telephone Co., 844 F. Supp. 2d 571, 2012 WL 22075, at *18 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (""We agree with the Defendants that 
a decision concerning the standard we will use [i.e., rule of reason or per se] to determine whether the restraint on trade is 
unreasonable is a premature question if the Complaint fails to allege a conspiracy. Therefore, we will reach this question only if 
we find that TruePosition has sufficiently alleged a conspiracy.""). "
1614,10," The Court notes that Plaintiffs do not point to any comments made by AT&T or any commentary made by any individual 
referencing any action taken by AT&T."
1614,11," While a Qualcomm employee allegedly stated that there ""could be"" blocking by such unnamed 3GPP members, there is no 
allegation that any blocking actually  [**37] occurred."
1614,12," The Court notes that even Plaintiffs' version of this conversion (which is taken as true) only states that the petition itself caused 
delay in Band 12. The comment from Gene Fong does not state, or even infer, that an ""agreement"" or a ""conspiracy"" between 
any individuals or entities, much less the Defendants to this action, could or would cause such delay."
1614,13," As noted in relation to the comment made by Gene Fong, the comment made by Edgar Fernandes states that the petition and 
related filings ""gummed up the works."" The comment does not state nor infer that any agreement or concerted action by any of 
Defendants caused or threatened such alleged delay. "
1615,14," Each of the comments  [**40] allegedly made occurred after the petition for rulemaking and after each of the Defendants had 
already set forth in public filings its opposition on technical grounds to the regulatory relief that Cellular South and other carriers 
had requested. As Cellular South even recognizes, it was publically known that AT&T, Verizon, and numerous others in the 
industry opposed the regulatory relief requested by Cellular South."
1615,15," As noted supra, roaming services are network services that customers of Cellular South may utilize when outside of Cellular 
South's service area. "
1617,16," See also Car Carriers, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 745 F.2d 1101, 1106 (7th Cir. 1984) (""[T]he costs of modern federal antitrust 
litigation and the increasing caseload of the federal courts counsel against sending the parties into discovery when there is no 
reasonable likelihood that the plaintiffs can construct a claim from the events related in the complaint""); Note, Modeling the Effect 
of One-Way Fee Shifting on Discovery Abuse in Private Antitrust Litigation, 78 N.Y. U. L. Rev. 1887, 1898-1899 (2003) 
(discussing the unusually high cost of discovery in antitrust cases); MANUAL FOR COMPLEX LITIGATION, FOURTH, § 30, p. 519 (2004) 
(describing extensive scope of discovery in antitrust cases); Memorandum from Paul V. Niemeyer, Chair, Advisory Committee 
on Civil Rules, to Hon. Anthony J. Scirica, Chair, Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (May 11, 1999), 192 F.R.D. 
354, 357 (2000) (reporting  [**52] that discovery accounts for as much as 90 percent of litigation costs when discovery is actively 
employed). "
1619,17," As discussed supra, while Plaintiffs proffer, under their Section 1 claim, that an agreement between AT&T and Motorola ""had 
to have"" happened prior to Motorola's proposal in 2008 to create a separate band class, there is not a single factual allegation 
supporting such a conclusory assertion."
1619,18," See Transcript of Milken Institute 2012 Global Conference, April 29-May 2, 2012, Los Angeles, A Conversation With AT&T's 
Randall Stephenson (11:00 AM-Wednesday May 2, 2012, at p. 2). "
1620,19," For clarification, the Court notes that Verizon did not object to the creation of Band Class 17 at 3GPP in 2008. "
1633,1," Because this appeal is from an order granting dismissal, the facts are taken from the FAC. "
1634,2," The original complaint also brought claims against Defendants' affiliates, HSBC Finance Corporation and Best Buy Co., Inc. 
However, Davis has since voluntarily dismissed these affiliates from the case. "
1639,3," HN23[
] California intermediate courts agree with our conclusion that regulations can create safe harbors. Most recently, in Lopez v. Nissan North America, Inc., 201 Cal. App. 4th 572, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 116, 132 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011), the state appellate "
1640,," court discussed approvingly our decision in Alvarez v. Chevron Corp., 656 F.3d 925, 933 (9th Cir. 2011), where we held that 
California gasoline regulations created a safe harbor against the UCL. See also Byars v. SCME Mortg. Bankers, Inc., 109 Cal. 
App. 4th 1134, 135 Cal. Rptr. 2d 796, 805-806 (Cal. Ct. App. 2003) (noting that HUD policy statement created safe harbor for 
mortgage lender's conduct)."
1640,4," Consistent with this view, Cel-Tech repeatedly explains that HN28[
] it is the conduct, not the actor, that the safe harbor 
embraces. See also 973 P.2d at 541 (""If the Legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded 
no action should lie, courts may not override that determination.""); id. (""To forestall an action under the unfair competition law, 
another provision must actually 'bar' the action or clearly permit the conduct.""); id. at 541-42 (""Acts that the Legislature has 
determined to be lawful may not form the basis for an action under the unfair competition law . . . .""); id. at 542 (""[C]ourts may not 
use the unfair competition law to condemn actions the Legislature permits.""). "
1641,5," Davis also argues that the disclosure of the annual fee in the online application was ""unfair and deceptive"" in violation of the 
OCC regulation and was therefore ""unlawful"" under the UCL. However, because the safe harbor protects the application, this 
basis for the UCL claim must fail. While we are sensitive that there may be some facial tension between the TILA safe harbor 
and the OCC regulation in this situation, we need not address it here because (1) the California Supreme Court has not 
indicated that such a tension thwarts the safe harbor, and (2) in any event, the parties have not raised this issue. "
1643,6," Although Defendants argue on appeal, as they did at the district court, that Davis's UCL claims are preempted by federal law, 
we need not reach that issue because we conclude that Davis has failed to state a claim under the UCL. "
1647,1," Plaintiff's Request for Judicial Notice (Docket Item No. 27) is DENIED as the court finds the information contained therein 
irrelevant to this determination. "
1649,2," Plaintiff attempts to escape a  [*14] determination that these statements are puffery by arguing that ""factual assertions are not 
puffery."" That much is true, but it does not assist Plaintiff here because it is also true that vague assertions are not actionable 
under the CLRA even if they are purported assertions of fact. See, e.g., Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., 622 F.3d 
1035, 1043 (9th Cir. 2010) (""'[A]ll the advantages that only the nation's largest wireless company can provide' is a vague 
statement and provides nothing concrete upon which [plaintiff] could reasonably rely."") Moreover, the ""classic example of an actionable representation of fact"" cited by Plaintiff is inapposite to this case. While there 
does appear some facial similarly between an auto dealer's assertion that a windshield is made of shatterproof glass and this 
action since both do involve glass and the breaking of glass, the similarities end there. In the case underlying the ""classic 
example,"" the auto dealer made a specific written representation that the glass windshield would not would not fly or shatter 
under the hardest impact. Baxter v. Ford Motor Co., 168 Wash. 456, 459-60, 12 P.2d 409 (1932). In contrast, Apple is not 
alleged to have made any similar  [*15] statement concerning the glass housing on the iPhone 4. "
1657,1," 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) states: HN1[
] (c) A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time before final judgment it 
appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded. An order remanding the case 
may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal. A 
certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the State court. The State court may 
thereupon proceed with such case. "
1659,2," HN5[
] A defendant's subjective good faith belief that removal was proper is insufficient to establish that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees under Section 1447(c). Valdes, 199 F.3d at 292 (""To be sure, the district court 
may award fees even if removal is made in subjective good faith."")."
1659,3," HN9[
] A state legislature cannot by statute confer jurisdiction over a state-law claim to a federal court. See Burford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315, 317, 63 S. Ct. 1098, 87 L. Ed. 1424 (1943). The district court observed that if it were to accept the argument 
that the ""in harmony"" language of the TFEAA presents a ""stated federal issue,"" then ""every cause of action brought in state court 
under the TFEAA would automatically be removable to federal court."""
1659,4," Sabre contends that Waste Control does not apply here because Waste Control was decided before the Supreme Court's 
decision in Grable and concerned the question of whether a Texas antitrust claim is ""completely preempted"" by federal antitrust 
law. Sabre points out that ""significant federal issue"" jurisdiction is different than jurisdiction based on complete preemption and 
that it is undisputed that state antitrust claims are not preempted by federal antitrust law. See Bernhard v. Whitney Nat'l Bank, 
523 F.3d 546, 551 (5th Cir. 2008) (holding that if  [**10] a petition ""alleges only state law claims, the district court [has] federal 
question jurisdiction over their case only if: (1) the state law claims necessarily raise a federal issue or (2) the state law claims "
1660,," are completely preempted by federal law.""); California v. ARC Am. Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 102, 109 S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 
(1989) (""Congress has not pre-empted the field of antitrust law . . . . Congress intended the federal antitrust laws to 
supplement, not displace, state antitrust remedies.""). However, this court's assertion in Waste Control that TFEAA claims are 
""wholly state claims,"" 199 F.3d at 784, rebuts the argument that a TFEAA claim necessarily ""raise[s] a stated federal issue"" 
because the statute ""requires"" that state courts interpret it ""in harmony"" with federal antitrust law. Moreover, it is not 
determinative that Grable was decided after Waste Control because Grable did not address TFEAA claims and did not create a 
new basis for federal question jurisdiction. See Grable, 545 U.S. at 312-14; see generally Fairbairn, Jennifer E., Keeping Grable 
Slim: Federal Question Jurisdiction and the Centrality Test, 58 Emory L.J. 977, 977-89 (2009). "
