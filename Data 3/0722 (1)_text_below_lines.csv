22,1," Defendant Barrett Daffin Frappier Treder & Weiss were named in the second amended complaint, but on September 9, 2015, 
an order issued pursuant to the stipulation of the parties that Defendant Barrett Daffin Frappier Treder & Weiss need not actively 
participate in this action and is being treated as a nominal party to this action. (ECF No. 30.)"
22,2," Defendant Nationstar requests that the Court take judicial notice of official records of the County of Tulare and Tulare County 
Superior Court. Under the Federal Rules a court may take judicial notice of a fact that is ""not subject to reasonable dispute in 
that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready 
determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Judicial notice may 
be taken ""of court filings and other matters of public record."" Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 
(9th Cir. 2006); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001). The Court grants Defendant Nationstar's request 
for judicial notice. "
42,1," As this Opinion's caption makes plain, the parties' roles have changed throughout the course of this labyrinthine litigation. The 
initial Complaint named the Monroe Estate as a Defendant. (Dkt. #1). For the purposes of AVELA I., the Monroe Estate was a 
Counterclaimant, while V. International and X One X were Third-Party Defendants. (Dkt. #215). And with regard to the instant 
Opinion, V. International and X One X are both Counterclaimants, while the Estate Movants and LGP are all Counter-
Defendants. (Dkt. #219, 257). The Court provides a more thorough account of this case's post AVELA I procedural history infra."
42,2," This case draws on facts from the Answer of [V. International] to First Amended Counterclaim, and Related Counterclaims (""V 
Int'l Countercl."" (Dkt. #219)), and from the Answer of [X One X] to First Amended Counterclaim, and Related (Amended) 
Counterclaims (""X One X Am. Countercl."" (Dkt. #257)). For the purpose of adjudicating the Estate Movants' and LGP's motions 
to dismiss, the Court accepts as true the well-pleaded allegations in these counterclaims. See, e.g., Growblox Scis., Inc. v. GCM 
Admin. Servs., LLC, No. 14 Civ. 2280 (ER), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44679, 2016 WL 1275050, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2016). 
For ease of reference, the Court refers to the Estate Movants' opening brief as ""Estate Br."" (Dkt. #251); to V. International's and 
X One X's briefs in opposition to the Estate Movants' motion to dismiss as ""V. Int'l Estate Opp."" (Dkt. #258) and ""X One X Estate 
Opp."" (Dkt. #260), respectively; and to the Estate Movants' reply as ""Estate Reply"" (Dkt. #267). Similarly, the Court will refer to 
LGP's opening brief as ""LGP Br."" (Dkt. #270), to X One X's opposition as ""X One X LGP Opp."" (Dkt. #273), and to LGP's reply 
as ""LGP Reply"" (Dkt. #274)."
42,3," Although X One X and V. International have filed separate counterclaims, they rely on essentially the same facts. (Compare V. 
Int'l Countercl. ¶¶ 10-32, with X One X Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 11-36). Nonetheless, for clarity's sake, in this Opinion the Court will 
cite to the factual allegations in both parties' counterclaims. "
43,4," The Contested Marks' Registration Numbers are: 1509758, 1889730, 2180950, 2223599, 2985935, 4040943, 4336364, 
4419275, 4487208, 4487210, 4511420, and 4743834. (V. Int'l Countercl. ¶ 25; X One X Am. Countercl. ¶ 28) "
44,5," The February 10, 2016 endorsement also set page limits for opening (35 pages), opposition (35 pages), and reply (15 pages) 
briefs. (Dkt. #243, at 2). The Estate Movants argue that X One X and V. International disobeyed the Court's endorsement, 
because X One X filed a 35-page opposition brief, and V. International filed a 12-page opposition brief. (Estate Reply 1 n.1). The 
Estate Movants also fault V. International for incorporating by reference large portions of X One X's brief. (Id.). It was the Court's 
expectation that X One X and V. International would file a joint 35-page opposition brief or, alternately, separate briefs with a 
collective page count of 35. But the February 10, 2016 endorsement did not explicitly forbid V. International and X One X from 
submitting the opposition briefs they did. X One X and V. International, then, violated the spirit, but not the letter, of the February 
10, 2016 endorsement. If and when the Court issues future endorsements in this case, it will expect X One X and V. 
International to honor them faithfully. "
50,6," As discussed supra, V. International does not specify the parties against whom it asserts any of its counterclaims. And in turn, 
the Court is not sure if V. International intended to assert Counterclaims One, Two, and Three against the Monroe Estate (which 
owns the Contested Marks) or all of the Estate Movants (which includes ABG and Salter, who do not own the Contested Marks). 
(See Estate Br. 20 n.6; V. Int'l Countercl. ¶ 25 (identifying the Monroe Estate as the Contested Marks' owner)). X One X's 
amended counterclaims, however, appear to resolve this ambiguity. X One X brings its three trademark counterclaims against 
the Monroe Estate alone. (X One X Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 37-56). The Court assumes that V. International intended to do the same. "
54,7," These deficiencies obviate the need for the Court to consider whether the Estate Movants' trademark-litigation efforts are 
entitled to Noerr-Pennington immunity. See United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 669-70, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 
14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); E. R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 136, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 
2d 464 (1961). Nonetheless, the Court pauses to make a clarifying point. The Estate Movants note correctly that Professional 
Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993), sets 
forth a two-prong test for determining whether litigation efforts are a ""sham"" and therefore outside of Noerr-Pennington's 
protections. (Estate Br. 11-12 (discussing Prof'l Real Estate, 508 U.S. at 60)). But the Professional Real Estate test is only 
relevant ""to determining whether a single action"" — like one prior lawsuit — ""constitutes sham petitioning."" Primetime 24 Joint 
Venture v. Nat'l Broad., Co., 219 F.3d 92, 101 (2d Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). ""In cases in which 
the defendant is accused of bringing a whole series of legal proceedings,"" courts in this Circuit ask a different, ""prospective"" 
question to determine whether those proceedings were a sham: ""Were the legal filings made, not out of a genuine interest in 
redressing grievances, but as part of a pattern or practice of successive filings undertaken essentially for purposes of 
harassment?"" Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, this distinction matters. In Counterclaim Four, V. International suggests that the Estate Movants have sent many cease-
and-desist letters, and threatened many lawsuits, in order to further their monopolistic efforts. (V. Int'l Countercl. ¶¶ 59, 63, 69). 
Put another way, V. International appears to take issue not only with the Monroe Estate's assertion of counterclaims in this case, 
but with the Estate Movants' litigation efforts in many cases. To be clear, the Court takes no position on whether V. 
International's allegations in this regard are true. But because those allegations suggest (implausibly) that the Estate Movants 
have engaged in a series of sham litigation efforts, the Professional Real Estate test does not speak to them. "
58,8," X One X also alleges that the Monroe Estate is ABG's alter ego. (X One X Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 11-14). The Court rejects this 
theory for the same reasons it rejected V. International's identical argument. "
96,1," This Joint Motion to Dismiss is supported by four distinct briefs: (i) Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Joint 
Motion to Dismiss All Complaints (""Twombly Br."") (ECF No. 207-2); (ii) Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of 
Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaints for Lack of Standing (""Standing Br."") (ECF No. 207-3); (iii) "
97,," Memorandum of Point sand Authorities in Support of Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss Various Claims as Time Barred (""SoL 
Br."") (ECF No. 207-4); and (iv) Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Defendants' Joint Motion to Dismiss the 
Indirect Purchaser End Payer Plaintiffs' and Indirect Purchaser Commercial Food Preparers' Consolidated Class Action 
Complaints (""State Law Br."") (ECF No. 207-5). "
100,2," Though the Court credits the allegation that TUG catches, cans, and sells its tuna under the CotS brand. "
101,3," Beyond the fact that they fail to name the Parent Defendants in their Complaint, the EPP Complaint (ECF No. 149) is not 
among those Complaints that adequately allege the Parent Defendants' direct participation in the conspiracy through use of 
acceptable group pleading or otherwise. "
103,4," Though the Court finds less persuasive the allegations that TUG, through its other subsidiary TUNAI, shares some office space 
at CotS branches in the United States."
103,5," And at the MTD hearing, Plaintiffs conceded that they did not specifically allege an inequitable result in their Complaints. (See 
Hr'g Tr. 39:6-10.) The Court declines to infer such a result from the pleadings as they stand, and will instead grant Plaintiffs the 
opportunity to amend their Complaints to allege an inequitable result."
103,6," Because Plaintiffs collectively fail to allege an inequitable result as to both Parent Defendants, the Court need not address, and 
therefore makes no specific conclusion regarding, whether each individual Plaintiff's Complaint adequately alleges the unity of 
interest required for alter ego. However, each Plaintiff will have an opportunity to amend its Complaint consistent with the Court's 
Order. "
104,7," Some Plaintiffs further allege overlap between Dongwon's other subsidiaries and StarKist's governing board. (See, e.g., Kroger 
Compl. ¶ 23.) However, overlap between employees of Dongwon's other subsidiaries and StarKist says less about Dongwon's 
control over StarKist when compared to the overlap between Dongwon's officers and StarKist's corporate governance."
104,8," Though the Court notes that allegations against Dongwon are measurably weaker than those against TUG, including, for 
example, the lack of any allegation that Dongwon shares office space with StarKist. "
105,9," At the MTD Hearing, counsel argued that these are specific allegations. (Hr'g Tr. 24:24-25:12.) The Court disagrees, but is 
willing to find that these are specific conclusions. "
106,10," Including the deficiently pled allegation that ""Dongwon dominated or controlled StarKist's canned tuna business as reflected 
by, among other actions, Dongwon's domination or control of StarKist's production, pricing, hiring, budgeting, capitalization, 
and/or marketing of canned tuna."" (E.g., Meijer Compl. ¶ 16.) "
108,11," Plaintiffs at the hearing further urged the Court to delay deciding this question until the class certification stage. (Hr'g Tr. 42:20-
60:15.) In part, Plaintiffs referenced several district courts that have concluded that in antitrust cases it ""is a close question"" 
whether to apply California law in a state that would otherwise bar indirect-purchaser recovery. E.g., In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) 
Antitrust Litigation, No. M 07-1827 SI, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97825, 2013 WL 4175253, at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 11, 2013); Pecover 
v. Electronic Arts Inc., No. C 08-2820 VRW, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140632, 2010 WL 8742757, at *20 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 21, 2010). 
However, there are many other Courts that do not find the inquiry to be so close; in fact, the final case Plaintiffs provided the 
Court at the hearing explicitly notes that ""[g]iven that the action simply could not go forward in non-repealer states, however, it is 
too much of a stretch to employ California law as an end run around the limitations those states have elected to impose on "
109,," standing."" In re Korean Ramen Antitrust Litig., No. 13-CV-04115-WHO, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7756, 2017 WL 235052, at *22 
(N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2017) (alteration in original) (citing In re Optical Disk Drive Antitrust Litig., No. 3:10-MD-2143 RS, 2016 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 15899, 2016 WL 467444, at *12 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 8, 2016)). The Court here agrees. And because Plaintiffs have 
brought a putative class consisting of ""[a]ll persons and entities who resided in the United States . . . during the Class Period[,]"" 
(EPP Compl. ¶ 68), this is fatal to such a class. However, Plaintiffs here—as with all other claims—will be granted leave to 
amend."
109,12," Additionally, pursuant to Ninth Circuit precedent Shady Grove's result is the only portion of that case that is useful to this court. 
Infra Part IV.B.(xv). "
110,13," This, of course, implicates the procedure of when indirect purchasers may recover. But the fact that an indirect purchaser may 
nonetheless recover under the statute pursuant to a suit by the Attorney General does not alter the substance of indirect 
purchasers' personal remedy—they have none. "
111,14," Defendants also argue in their Reply that (1) a fundamental tenet of statutory construction is to assume only prospective 
application; and (2) the Oregon legislature could have easily indicated any intent to make the statute apply retroactively. (1) 
Defendants are correct that the Supreme Court has articulated this maxim of construction, but the animating concern behind 
such construction is to avoid constitutional conflict, Vartelas v. Holder, 566 U.S. 257, 132 S.Ct. 1479, 1486-87, 182 L. Ed. 2d 473 
(2012), and Oregon's retroactivity test embraces this concern. (2) Defendants are correct that the Oregon legislature could have 
easily indicated any intent to make the statute apply retroactively, but the legislature could just as easily have indicated any 
intent to make the statute apply only prospectively. And the case Defendants cite for that proposition itself recognizes that 
""remedial and procedural statutes are [often] applied retroactively."" Perkins v. Willamette Indus., Inc., 273 Ore. 566, 542 P.2d 
473, 475 (1975). "
112,15," CFPs additionally argue that Plaintiffs' allegations satisfy Rule 9(b). (CFP Opp'n 25-26.) Given that the Court concludes 
Plaintiffs' allegations do not sound in fraud, the Court does not address this argument. "
113,16," Defendants' Reply asserts that ""Plaintiffs acknowledge that unconscionability is a required element of . . . District of Columbia . 
. . consumer protection claims."" (State Law Reply 12.) Aside from mischaracterizing EPPs' and CFPs' positions, (CFP Opp'n 27 
(""[A] violation of the . . . DCCPPA . . . does not require 'unconscionable conduct.'""); EPP Opp'n 67 (explaining ""[n]or do all of the 
statutes require a complaint to allege unconscionable conduct."" and citing D.C. authority), this position is also legally incorrect. 
See, e.g., Eggs, 851 F. Supp. 2d at 897-98 (""The DCCPPA prohibits 'unlawful trade practices,' and, although certain of the 
enumerated 'unlawful trade practices' as defined by D.C. Code § 28-3904 may require the element of unconscionable conduct to 
be alleged, Defendants have not identified any authority that suggests that an allegation of 'unconscionable conduct' is required 
in order for a violation of the Antitrust Act to constitute an unlawful trade practice under the DCCPPA for pleading purposes.""). "
115,17," Additionally, it seems unlikely that Plaintiffs would be able to show ""substantial injury,"" something Plaintiffs admit is required to 
meet the unfairness prong of MUTPA. (EPP Opp'n 61); see Tungate, 714 A.2d at 797 (""The difference between some portrait 
packages in schools that received a commission and those that did not is as little as $1.25, in the case of a $7 package. Such a 
difference would clearly be insubstantial . . . ."")."
115,18," Defendants effectively rehash this argument later in their brief under the ground that Maine requires a showing of ""deceptive 
inducement of purchase"" pursuant to Tungate. (State Law Br. 13-14.) Regardless of its classification, this additional line of 
argument is now moot."
115,19," As in the fraudulent concealment context, the Court applies Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement in light of the relevant state-
law enunciations of the requirements to validly plead a fraud cause of action. See infra note 29. "
116,20," Defendants cite two additional cases in their reply: Packaged Ice, 779 F. Supp. 2d at 665, and Cast Iron, 2015 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 121620, 2015 WL 5166014, at *29. One is not useful. Cast Iron, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121620, 2015 WL 5166014, at 
*29 (dismissing claim because ""the Indirect Purchasers have neither addressed Defendants' argument with respect to Michigan 
nor cited any authority specific to the state of Michigan""). The other inferentially undercuts Defendants' position. Packaged Ice, 
779 F. Supp. 2d at 666 (noting that the ""[d]efendants argue that the IP [p]laintiffs' claims under the Michigan Consumer 
Protection Act . . . must be dismissed for failure to allege an intent to deceive on the part of the Defendants"" and because ""[t]he 
[relevant complaint] fails to allege such conduct . . . the Court dismisses the claim for this reason""). "
118,21," Defendants effectively re-raise this argument later in their brief, arguing that ""CFPs' Missouri consumer protection claims 
should be dismissed because Missouri bars indirect purchasers from recovery under its state laws."" (State Law Br. 7.) 
Accordingly, the Court DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss on this ground. "
122,22," Defendants do not here argue that the alleged injury is not ""substantial"" within the meaning of Ames. Indeed, Ames relied on 
F.T.C. v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 92 S. Ct. 898, 31 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1972), for its articulation of the Rhode Island 
unfairness inquiry. Ames, 767 A.2d at 681, 681 n.6. And Sperry explicitly sets forth the three discrete inquiries as factors rather 
than elements, 405 U.S. at 244, n.5, such that a finding of ""substantial"" injury may not in all cases be required. "
131,23," This also necessarily implicates the redressability requirement. Even if other named Plaintiffs allegedly suffered validly pled 
harms under similar state statutes, to assume that those same harms occurred to individuals in other states—not a single one of 
which is before this Court—leaves the Court able only to speculate that granting relief under those state statutes without any 
identified plaintiffs would redress those hypothetical harms. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 505, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 45 L. Ed. 2d 
343, (1975) (noting that individuals asserting harm on behalf of a third party, while not necessarily barred under Article III 
standing, may have difficulty showing that ""relief will remove the harm""). "
133,24," Several of Plaintiffs' cited cases rely on the following language from Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc. to support 
the proposition that each new injury restarts the statute-of-limitation clock as to all injuries: In the context of a continuing conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws, such as the conspiracy in the instant case, this has 
usually been understood to mean that each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendants a cause of action accrues 
to him to recover the damages caused by that act and that, as to those damages, the statute of limitations runs from the 
commission of the act. . . . . However, each separate cause of action that so accrues entitles a plaintiff to recover not only 
those damages which he has suffered at the date of accrual, but also those which he will suffer in the future from the 
particular invasion, including what he has suffered during and will predictably suffer after trial."
133,401," U.S. 321, 338-39, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971). However, the Court declines to extend this forward-looking logic in 
a backwards manner. In other words, each new injury constitutes Sherman-Act-compensable harm, and—when timely 
litigated—permits redress for any additional injuries flowing from the first injury, during and after the pendency of litigation. It 
does not therefore necessarily follow that each new injury constitutes Sherman-Act-compensable harm that—when timely 
litigated—provides an avenue of redress for past, non-timely-pursued harms. "
134,25," CFPs do not address the relevant accrual rule under South Carolina law, despite the fact that CFPs bring a claim under South 
Carolina's Unfair Trade Practices Act (S.C. Code §§ 39-5-10, et seq.). (CFP Compl. ¶ 144.) Accordingly, Defendants have not 
moved to dismiss on this ground and the Court does not here determine what accrual rule governs claims under South 
Carolina's Unfair Trade Practices Act."
134,26," Upon review, the Court concludes that the discovery rule indeed should apply in these states. See, e.g., Taitano v. Calvo Fin. 
Corp., 2008 Guam 12, ¶¶ 45, 55 (""[T]his court has held that 'the statute of limitations [for an action sounding in fraud] will begin 
to run when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that his injury was caused by wrongdoing or that someone has done 
something wrong to him.'"" (quoting Gayle v. Hemlani, 2000 Guam 25, ¶ 24)); Passatempo v. McMenimen, 461 Mass. 279, 960 
N.E.2d 275, 293 (Mass. 2012) (""This court has developed a discovery rule [for actions sounding in fraud] to determine when the 
statute of limitations begins to run in circumstances where the plaintiff did not know or could not reasonably have known that he 
or she may have been harmed by the conduct of another."" (quoting Koe v. Mercer, 450 Mass. 97, 876 N.E.2d 831, 836 (Mass. 
2007))); Bemis v. Estate of Bemis, 114 Nev. 1021, 967 P.2d 437, 443 (Nev. 1998) (""In dealing with statutes that do not specify 
when a cause of action accrues, we have held that the discovery rule would apply.""); Torrealba v. Kesmetis, 124 Nev. 95, 178

reasonable diligence should have known, of the wrongful act and its resulting injury""); Gust, Rosenfeld & Henderson v.

discovery rule is whether the plaintiff's injury or the conduct causing the injury is difficult for plaintiff to detect, not whether the 
action sounds in contract or in tort.""); Hermitage Corp. v. Contractors Adjustment Co., 166 Ill. 2d 72, 651 N.E.2d 1132, 1136, 209

to put a prudent person on inquiry about 'a particular fact, [but] who omits to make such inquiry with reasonable diligence"" 
(quoting S.D. Codified Laws § 17-1-4); Univ. of Vt. v. W.R. Grace & Co., 152 Vt. 287, 565 A.2d 1354, 1357 (Vt. 1989) (explaining 
that ""it is clear that the discovery rule . . . applies even where the statute is silent on the matter"" and holding that ""the discovery 
rule should be read into [Vermont's general six-year statute of limitations for civil actions]""); Hansen v. A.H. Robins, Inc., 113 
Wis. 2d 550, 335 N.W.2d 578, 583 (Wis. 1983) (""In the interest of justice and fundamental fairness, we adopt the discovery rule 
for all tort actions other than those already governed by a legislatively created discovery rule. Such tort claims shall accrue on 
the date the injury is discovered or with reasonable diligence should be discovered, whichever occurs first.""). Finally, Arkansas 
and New Hampshire likely—as a purely definitional matter—recognize the doctrine of fraudulent concealment, rather than 
following the ""discovery rule;"" but the result of applying both states' law in the present case is the same regardless, see infra 
Section V. E.g., Chalmers v. Toyota Motor Sales, USA, Inc., 326 Ark. 895, 935 S.W.2d 258, 261 (Ark. 1996) (""Fraud suspends 
the running of the statute of limitations, and the suspension remains in effect until the party having the cause of action discovers 
the fraud or should have discovered it by the exercise of reasonable diligence."" (citing First Pyramid Life Ins. Co. v. Stoltz, 311 
Ark. 313, 843 S.W.2d 842 (1992), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 908, 114 S. Ct. 290, 126 L. Ed. 2d 239 (1993))); Perez v. Pike Indus., 
153 N.H. 158, 889 A.2d 27, 30 (N.H. 2005) (""[T]he discovery rule exception does not apply unless the plaintiff did not discover, 
and could not reasonably have discovered, either the alleged injury or its causal connection to the alleged negligent act.""). "
136,27," Defendants' sole citation to Hipp v. Vernon L. Smith & Assocs., Inc., 2011 Ark. App. 611, 386 S.W.3d 526, 530 (Ark. Ct. App. 
2011) for support is inapposite. The parties in Hipp were not contesting when the statute of limitations began to run, but instead 
arguing about whether the statute should have been tolled under the doctrine of fraudulent concealment. Id. (""[A]ppellants do not 
dispute the fact that their complaint was not filed within either of the applicable limitations periods. Nonetheless, appellants 
contend that the fraud perpetrated by the appellees tolled the limitations period."" (emphasis added)). "
137,28," Plaintiffs characterize this statutory provision as follows: the ""Iowa antitrust statute of limitations begins to run after the cause 
of actions accrues or is discovered, whichever is later."" (EPP and CFP app. III, at 2.) The statute, however, clearly implicates 
fraudulent concealment rather than the discovery rule. "
142,29," Defendants arguably try to import other aspects of the Ninth Circuit's fraudulent concealment standard, such as the 
requirement that a plaintiff ""detail with particularity the time, place, and manner of each act of fraud, plus the role of each 
defendant in each scheme."" (SoL MTD 16-19 (citing Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., 326 F.2d 575, 577 (9th 
Cir. 1991)). Compare SoL Reply 7 (""[W]here Plaintiffs' fraudulent concealment allegations fail under federal law, they similarly 
fail under state laws.""), with SoL MTD 16-19.) However, Rule 9(b) does not include these additional requirements. Accordingly, 
the Court applies Rule 9(b)'s command that a party plead ""with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud[,]"" but does so 
in light of each individual state articulation of the applicable doctrine of fraudulent concealment. "
143,30," Additionally, the Court previously dismissed EPPs' pre-2011 allegations as insufficient to plausibly allege a conspiracy under 
the Sherman Act. (First MTD Order 17-18.) Because conspiratorial conduct lies at the heart of all EPPs' state law claims, the 
Court need only consider the doctrine of fraudulent concealment as it pertains to EPPs' post-2011 allegations; i.e., even if 
fraudulent concealment saved EPPs' pre-2011 allegations, they are nonetheless insufficient to plausibly support EPPs' 
corresponding state-law-based allegations."
143,31," These mooted states are Arkansas, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Nebraska. "
145,32," Plaintiffs cite Frederick v. Wallerich, No. A15-2052, 2016 Minn. App. Unpub. LEXIS 746, 2016 WL 4068931, at *4 (Minn. Ct. 
App. Aug. 1, 2016),  [**208] review granted (Oct. 26, 2016), for their rule statement. Aside from now currently being slated for 
Minnesota-Supreme-Court review, Frederick—as opposed to Minnesota Laborers—additionally (1) is a lower court decision, that 
(2) was unpublished, and therefore may not be cited as precedent, and (3) articulates a standard specific to ""[f]raudulent 
concealment . . . in an attorney-client relationship . . . ."" Accordingly, the Court will use the Minnesota Laborers rule statement. "
147,33," Virginia also requires that ""[t]he fraud which will relieve the bar of the statute . . . be of that character which involves moral 
turpitude, and must have the effect of debarring or deterring the plaintiff from his action.'"" Id. at 340. However, at least in the 
present case, this requirement is merely duplicative of the ""affirmative acts of misrepresentation requirement,"" and thus is 
satisfied on the facts of this case. See id. (discussing Virginia Supreme Court case explaining that moral turpitude requires that a 
""defendant . . . intend to conceal the discovery of the cause of action by trick or artifice""). "
149,34," All aspects of this Order and the Court's prior Order, (ECF No. 283), apply with equal force to the pending motions in DAP 
member cases 16cv51, 16cv264, 16cv247, 16cv398, and 16cv1226. "
154,1," The majority of these background facts were stipulated by the parties and recounted in the district court's Pretrial Order. 7 J.A. 
1291-1301. Because this is an appeal from the district court's grant of Cardinal and O&M's motion for summary judgment, to the 
extent facts are disputed we assume that any nonconclusory version presented by Suture Express is correct. Multistate Legal 
Studies, Inc. v. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Legal & Prof'l Publ'ns, Inc., 63 F.3d 1540, 1545 (10th Cir. 1995) (citing Eastman 
Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 456, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992)). "
155,2," ""Total"" sales includes those made to both acute and non-acute care providers, rather than simply to acute care providers. "
156,3," Medline, the other national broadline distributor who is not a party to this case, used similar bundling packages. So did many of 
the regional distributors, such as Seneca Medical and MMS. "
158,4," HN6[
] Again, under the rule of reason, the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the restraint of trade is, on balance, 
unreasonable. See Law, 134 F.3d at 1019. Thus, the per se ""elements"" are in fact more akin to ""factors"" under this analysis, 
useful for providing a framework forward but perhaps not themselves actual requirements for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie 
case. See Fortner I, 394 U.S. at 499-500. "
159,5," Compare Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494, 511 (3d Cir. 1998) (""Where appreciable tying 
market power cannot be shown, inquiry into the tied product market cannot be avoided, and the plaintiff therefore has the more 
difficult burden of showing that the arrangement violated the rule of reason because it unreasonably restrained competition in the 
tied product market.""), Breaux Bros. Farms, Inc. v. Teche Sugar Co., 21 F.3d 83, 88 (5th Cir. 1994) (noting plaintiffs could prevail 
in absence of showing market power if they proved an ""unreasonable restraint of trade""), and Grappone, Inc. v. Subaru of New 
England, Inc., 858 F.2d 792, 799 (1st Cir. 1988) (Breyer, J.) (examining competitive effects under rule of reason after 
determining plaintiffs had not shown market power to satisfy per se rule), with PSI Repair Servs., Inc. v. Honeywell, Inc., 104 
F.3d 811, 815 n.2 (6th Cir. 1997) (explaining that ""market power in the tying product market is an indispensable requirement 
under either per se or rule-of-reason analysis"" because the two theories have ""merge[d]""), Dig. Equip. Corp. v. Uniq Dig. Techs., 
Inc., 73 F.3d 756, 761 (7th Cir. 1996) (""[S]ubstantial market power is an indispensable ingredient of every claim under the Rule 
of Reason.""), and Amey, Inc. v. Gulf Abstract & Title, Inc., 758 F.2d 1486, 1502-03 (11th Cir. 1985) (listing per se elements in 
rule of reason analysis). The Supreme Court's most recent foray into tying analysis did not resolve the issue. In Illinois Tool Works, the Court held that a 
patent in the tying market would no longer be dispositive of market power for purposes of a per se tying claim, and therefore 
required a plaintiff to prove market power instead of simply relying on the presumption. 547 U.S. at 45. In abolishing that 
presumption, though, the Court did not necessarily abrogate the rule from Hyde applicable to the rule of reason: ""When . . . the 
seller does not have either the degree or the kind of market power that enables him to force customers to purchase a second, 
unwanted product in order to obtain the tying product, an antitrust violation can be established only by evidence of an 
unreasonable restraint on competition in the relevant market."" 466 U.S. at 17-18; see id. at 29. "
160,6," Justice Scalia dissented because (among other reasons) he thought the Court erred in accepting the plaintiffs' market definition 
and in its analysis of aftermarket effects in the per se claim. But, supporting the use of direct evidence under the rule of reason, 
he wrote: ""I would instead evaluate the aftermarket tie alleged in this case under the rule of reason, where the tie's actual 
anticompetitive effect in the tied product market, together with its potential economic benefits, can be fully captured in the 
analysis. Disposition of this case does not require such an examination, however, as [plaintiffs] apparently waived any rule-of-
reason claim they may have had in the District Court."" Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 502-03 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citation 
omitted)."
160,7," Cardinal and O&M also argue that PeaceHealth is inapposite because the court's discussion on direct effects in the tied market 
took place during its discussion of economic coercion — i.e., whether the sale of one product was conditioned on the purchase 
of another. Aplee. Br. at 40. This is true, but it does not mean the two elements were unrelated. In fact, they were: the Ninth 
Circuit described its inquiry as whether ""the defendant possesses enough economic power in the tying product market to coerce 
its customers into purchasing the tied product."" PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d at 913. "
163,8," Professor Elhauge explained that he could not examine 100% of Cardinal's and O&M's contracts because of the arduousness 
of the task (there were thousands of individual contracts) and because neither defendant produced all of the agreements. 2 J.A. 
362, 380-81."
163,9," Suture Express points to Fortner I for the proposition that it need only show that ""any appreciable number of buyers"" is 
affected, not the entire market. Aplt. Br. at 36 (quoting 394 U.S. at 504). While (again) not suggesting that Suture Express must 
demonstrate harm to 100% of the suture-endo market, it is worth pointing out that this discussion by the Supreme Court 
concerned what constitutes ""sufficient economic power"" in the tying market — not what counts as harm to competition in the tied 
market. See 394 U.S. at 502-04. "
168,1," The claims described in the operative complaints may be briefly summarized. Defendant Warner Chilcott (""Warner"") is the drug 
manufacturer that owns the patent covering Loestrin 24. After Defendant Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Watson"") filed its 
notice of intent to introduce a generic version of Loestrin 24, Warner sued for patent infringement. The parties settled on 
condition that Watson delay entry of its generic version; in exchange, Watson got favorable promotional deals, as well as the 
promise that Warner would not introduce its own generic version of Loestrin 24. Next, Defendant Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
(""Lupin"") announced its intent to introduce a generic version of Loestrin 24; again, Warner sued and, again, the parties settled, 
agreeing that Lupin would delay the introduction of its generic Loestrin 24 in exchange for attorneys' fees and other benefits to 
Lupin. Warner used the purchased delay to push its Loestrin 24 prescriptions to Minastrin 24 Fe (""Minastrin""), which would not 
face generic competition for several years. See generally In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig., 814 F.3d 538, 541-42 (1st Cir. 
2016). [*9] Federal antitrust claims challenging these settlement agreements, as well as Defendant Warner's conduct during the patent 
prosecution, Warner's patent defense against Watson and Lupin, and a purported product hopping scheme, as violative of §§ 1 
and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, were brought by several large pharmaceutical and grocery companies, which are 
retail purchasers of Loestrin 24 (CVS Pharmacy, Inc., Rite Aid Corp., Rite Aid Hdqtrs Corp., Walgreen Co., The Kroger Co., 
Safeway Inc., HEB Grocery Co. L.P., Albertson's LLC) (""Retail Plaintiffs""), as well as by putative classes of Direct Purchaser "
169,," Plaintiffs (""DPPs""), which comprise companies that purchase drugs, including Loestrin 24, and other products for resale or 
distribution. Claims seeking injunctive relief under § 2 of the Sherman Act and damages and injunctive relief under the antitrust 
laws and common law of unjust enrichment of various states were brought by putative classes of End Payor Plaintiffs (""EPPs""); 
they consist of health and welfare benefit plans, which have indirectly purchased, paid for, and reimbursed the purchase of 
Loestrin 24, and individuals who purchased or paid some or all of the purchase price of Loestrin 24. All of the claims arise in the 
context of the regulatory framework established by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, Pub.L. 
No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act."
169,2," The Retail Plaintiffs do not dispute that the listed oral contraceptives are therapeutically interchangeable with Loestrin 24. ECF 
No. 256 at 6. EPPs acknowledge that there are therapeutic alternatives to Loestrin 24, but do not specifically acknowledge that 
the ten drugs proposed by Defendants are among them. ECF No. 257 at 6. DPPs argue that therapeutic substitutability is 
irrelevant but also complex if viewed from the perspective of whether patients can switch from one product to another. ECF No. 
262 at 15 & n.37. Like EPPs, they do not concede that the ten drugs listed by Defendants are necessarily therapeutically 
interchangeable, nor do they expressly assert that they are not."
169,3," Plaintiffs counter with the declaration of an equally well-credentialed economist, Dr. Meredith Rosenthal, who avers that the 
documents sought are neither ""necessary or sufficient"" for a determination of the antitrust market in issue. ECF No. 263-5 ¶¶ 9, 
26. While such an averment may well be pertinent at a later phase of the case (particularly at summary judgment or trial), the 
only question for a threshold discovery dispute is whether the documents are relevant to Plaintiffs' claims (Dr. Rosenthal says 
they are not) or to Defendants' defenses (Dr. Addanki says they are). "
170,4," This proposition derives from the so-called ""Cellophane Fallacy,"" an economic principle positing that proof that substitutes will 
enter a market in response to a meaningful price increase does not prove that the pre-increase price was set at a competitive 
level. Aggrenox, 199 F. Supp. 3d at 667. Rather, cross-elasticity of demand among certain drugs ""may . . . be the product of 
monopoly power rather than a belief on the part of consumers that the products are good substitutes for one another."" United 
States v. Eastman Kodak Co., 63 F.3d 95, 105 (2d Cir. 1992). "

Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Flowers_Campaign )."
172,6," My discovery decision should not be read as a rejection of the analytical framework adopted in Aggrenox. To the contrary, as 
the case proceeds, the parties remain free to propose to the Court that Aggrenox-based streamlining is appropriate and should 
be adopted. "
183,1," On January 5, 2015, District Judge Robert J. Shelby referred this case to the undersigned Magistrate Judge under 28 U.S.C. § 
636(b)(1)(B). (ECF No. 3.)"
183,2," Pursuant to D.U. Civ. R. 7-1(f), the undersigned finds oral argument unnecessary and will make its recommendation based on 
the Amended Complaint and written memoranda. "
190,3," 15 U.S.C. § 3 effectively applies 15 U.S.C. § 1 to the District of Columbia and the United States territories. Thus to the extent 
Ms. Van Ornum asserts claims under this statute, they suffer from the same plausibility defects as the 15 U.S.C. § 1 antitrust 
claims discussed above. "
200,1," These facts are drawn from the Second Amended Complaint (ECF No. 14), as well as the parties' factual statements filed as 
required by DRI LR Cv 56. CDS's Statements of Undisputed and Disputed Facts are referred to as ""C-SUF"" (ECF No. 30-3) and 
""C-SDF"" (ECF No. 30-2). Karndean's Statements of Undisputed and Disputed Facts are referred to a ""K-SUF"" (ECF No. 24-1) 
and K-SDF"" (ECF No. 31-2). Except as noted in the text, the facts recited above are undisputed. Virtually all documents filed by 
the parties in this matter were filed under seal. On March 7, 2017, this Court entered an Order to show cause why the parties' 
disputed and undisputed facts could not be unsealed so that that they could be cited in this R & R. No objection was made by 
either party as of the date specified in the Order, March 13, 2017. All documents presented as exhibits to the disputed and 
undisputed facts remain under seal."
200,2," If the Agreement did control this dispute, it would have been transferred to the Western District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to the 
clause calling for exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes in that venue or in the analogous state court. K-SUF ¶ 13 (ECF No. 25-
23 at 67, 73 § 16). "
201,3," CDS disputes that it was underperforming in terms of sales. It claims it met Karndean's sales goals every year (except one), 
resulting in a 395% increase in sales over a five-year period. C-SDF ¶ 40; C-SUF ¶ 69. While CDS concedes being told at least 
once it needed to improve its sales, it claims it responded with improved sales. C-SUF ¶ 69 (citing Thompson Dep. at 28). 
Somewhat inconsistently, CDS also justifies what Karndean's chief executive officer labeled as ""below par"" sales for the 
northeast region by arguing that Karndean's ""market analysis for New England was based on crude census figures about 
households and income and grossly inaccurate statistics related to the flooring industry."" C-SUF ¶ 87 (citing Perrin Dep. at 22). 
As Karndean points out, CDS cites no evidence to support that derogatory characterization of Karndean's basis for its sales 
expectations for New England."
201,4," CDS claims that its confusion was Karndean's fault in that the new rebate program was imposed without adequate explanation. 
C-SDF ¶ 41."
201,5," CDS does not dispute that it was seriously and persistently in arrears and that Karndean was frustrated by its failure to pay 
down a significant past due debt. K-SUF ¶¶ 43-45. Instead, CDS blames its financial difficulties on Karndean. For example, it 
claims its profit margins were adversely affected by the change to the rebate program and ""the pricing book that Karndean 
required CDS to use."" C-SDF ¶ 44; C-SUF ¶ 68. In addition, as CDS fell behind in its payments and its credit line was frozen, 
Karndean made its problems worse by delaying and withholding shipments; in one instance, CDS's owner had to charge 
$23,000 on his personal credit card in order to fulfill a customer's order. C-SUF ¶¶ 81-84. "
202,6," CDS denigrates Karndean's reasons for dissatisfaction with CDS as a ""pretext,"" presumably to cover up its nationwide plan to 
eliminate distributors. C-SDF ¶ 39. However, the evidence CDS cites in support of that assertion does not establish that 
Karndean's stated concerns about CDS were pretextual. Rather, CDS's evidence is consistent with Karndean's increasing 
frustration as the reasons for making a change with its distribution strategy in New England piled up. See nn. 3-5 supra. For 
example, CDS does not dispute its serious problems with making timely payments for product or its confusion over the rebate 
program, while the evidence it proffers makes clear that these were very serious matters for Karndean. Nevertheless, for 
purposes of this motion, I accept that there is a factual dispute regarding whether part or all of Karndean's motivation was to 
implement a nationwide plan to eliminate distributors almost entirely."
202,7," In argument, CDS adverts to the termination clause in the lapsed 2006 Distribution Agreement, hinting that it somehow gives 
rise to a trial-worthy issue on the period of notice to which CDS was entitled in that the clause required written notice thirty days 
prior to the expiration of successive one-year terms (ending on April 24 in each year). Even if applicable, that termination clause 
is rendered feckless by CDS's decision to end the relationship immediately rather than invoking whatever contractual right to a 
longer notice period arguably arose under the 2006 Distribution Agreement."
202,8," CDS argues that there is a third reason — that Karndean failed to compensate it for all of its earned rebates. It cites no 
evidence to support this assertion. Karndean has sustained its burden of presenting admissible evidence that the balance for 
which it is suing is net of the earned rebates; CDS presented nothing to dispute this fact. K-SUF ¶ 54 (Keller Decl. ¶ 14). CDS's 
argument about earned rebates will not be considered further."
202,9," CDS claims this amounts to $228,000. C-SDF ¶ 25. "
204,10," For example, CDS colorfully alleges that Karndean's actions are analogous to Putin's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. 
ECF No. 30-1 at 1."
204,11," CDS's claim of ""animus"" is stated in a conclusory fashion with no factual support beyond citation to the testimony of 
Karndean's chief executive officer about the trend in the number of distributors from five in 2002 to eleven in 2007, and back to 
five in 2014. C-SUF ¶ 71 (citing Perrin Dep. at 37). Otherwise, the evidence cited by CDS reflects Karndean's growing 
dissatisfaction with CDS's sales and delayed payments, including emails and testimony confirming those frustrations. K-SDF ¶ 
106. This proffer confirms Karndean's statement of reasons; it does not support CDS's claim of some wrongful animus. "
207,12," Ironically, CDS claims there were obvious clues of what Karndean was up to in that, over many years, it was incrementally and 
methodically reducing its dependence on distributors, except in remote areas (for example, Alaska). C-SUF ¶¶ 71, 73. Karndean 
disputes that this is accurate. K-SDF ¶¶ 71-73. Whether or not it is true, CDS's perception that it was true is a reason why its 
claim to have been deceived that Karndean might not do the same thing in New England rings hollow. "
208,13," In its argument, CDS adds two additional theories of unjust enrichment that are missing from the Second Amended Complaint. 
First, it alleges that Karndean has been unjustly enriched by ""the retention of approximately 500,000 square feet in future 
commercial 'spec' sales for commercial products that were sold by CDS"" when the relationship ended. This claim is borrowed 
from the offset defense CDS raised to Karndean's counterclaim for goods sold and delivered. I will address it in that context, as it 
was raised in the pleadings; it will not be discussed as part of Count III, where it does not appear. Second, CDS charges that 
Karndean was unjustly enriched when it took over the customer base that CDS had developed, enjoying sales of $2.7 million in 
2014 and 2015. This is CDS's tortious interference claim in different garb; I have addressed it in that context and will not address 
it again. "
213,1," On January 5, 2015, District Judge Robert J. Shelby referred this case to the undersigned Magistrate Judge under 28 U.S.C. § 
636(b)(1)(B). (ECF No. 3.)"
213,2," Pursuant to D.U. Civ. R. 7-1(f), the undersigned finds oral argument unnecessary and will make its recommendation based on 
the Amended Complaint and written memoranda. "
219,3," 15 U.S.C. § 3 effectively applies 15 U.S.C. § 1 to the District of Columbia and the United States territories. Thus to the extent 
Ms. Van Ornum asserts claims under this statute, they suffer from the same plausibly defects as the 15 U.S.C. § 1 antitrust 
claims discussed above. "
228,1," The putative class includes individuals who purchased trucks, as well as those who leased them. Dkt. 49 ¶ 5. However, all 
Plaintiffs identified in the TAC were lessees. Under the terms of certain leases, a Plaintiff had the right to purchase the leased 
vehicle at the end of the period covered by the lease. "
229,2," These Plaintiffs include the following: David Velasco, Yamina Rodriguez, Alvaro Hernandez, Carlos Quiroa, Clovis Gonzales, 
Darnell Young, Jose Velasco, Eduardo Grijalva, Efrain Lara, Emmanuel Vasquez, Ervin Midence, Esly Nahun Loyo, Geovany 
Mendieta, Gloria Mendieta, Ilario Julio Vaquerano, Jairo Cerros, Jorge Guevara, Juan Munoz, Kevin Rodas, Luis Midence, 
Marvin Estrada, Pedro David Alas Ramirez, Rogelio Rodriguez, Wilfredo Reyes, David Banda, Ramon Guerrero, Javier Perez, 
Marvin Caballero, Francisco Caballero, Garry Ebalobur, Luis Martinez, Douglas Romero, Alvaro Arambula, Maria Franco, 
Francisco Hernandez, Tony Rivera, Jorge Gonzales, Hector Martinez, Francisco Chavez, Edwin Quinonez, Oswaldo Melo, 
Camilo Ceballos, Noe Rodriguez, Marin Campos, Jorge Palacios, Jesse Perez, Jose Aguilar, Guillermo Casillas, Kim Macaraeg, 
Herminio Martinez, Fredy Ramirez, Dennis Vega, Alvaro Arcila, Jose A. Fuentes, Juan Martinez, Gustavo Palencia, Patrick Vo, 
Jose Cruz Rosas Espinoza, Juan R. Gonzalez, Alirio S. Caceres Avelar, and Francisco Mendez. "
236,3," The TAC alleges that some of the Trucks caught on fire, and includes the general claim that the use of the Trucks by the 
drivers endangered ""the lives of the Plaintiffs as well as the general public."" Dkt. 49 ¶¶ 2-3. However, these alleged hazards 
were attributable to the alleged defects, not to the inherently dangerous nature of the Trucks. Further, the claim of danger is not 
stated with specificity. "
238,4," Paccar and Inland argue that the breach of warranty claims fail because the Kenworth Warranty includes a one-year limitations 
period, and the claims were not timely brought.. Dkt. 54-1 at 14. Plaintiffs respond breach of the implied warranty claim did not "
239,," accrue the defects in the Trucks first appeared, but when ""Defendant was either unwilling or unable to provide a lasting solution."" 
Dkt. 58 at 9. In support of this position Plaintiffs cite Valencia v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am. Inc., 119 F. Supp. 3d 1130, 1142 (N.D. 
Cal. 2015)., which states ""that the date of accrual of the statute of limitations may be tolled for attempted repairs within the one-
year implied warranty."" Because the resolution of this issue will require the consideration of certain factual matters, it cannot be 
resolved on the present Motions. "
242,5," Kenworth has requested that the Court take judicial notice of the Second Amended Complaint filed in Aryeh. Dkt. 61. It alleged

256,104," It should be noted that the Plaintiff's Count I, entitled ""Piercing the Corporate Veil,"" is not an independent legal claim. See 
Second Am. Compl. ¶ 1553. Rather, veil piercing is a method by which a plaintiff seeks to hold a defendant liable for the 
obligations of a corporation. See GEBAM, Inc. v. Investment Realty Series I, LLC, 15 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1326 n.21 (N.D. Ga. 
2013) (""Piercing the corporate veil is not itself an independent cause of action, but rather is a means of imposing liability on an 
underlying cause of action."") (quoting Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U.S. 349, 354, 116 S. Ct. 862, 133 L. Ed. 2d 817 (1996)). As a 
result, it was improper for the Plaintiff to assert this as a separate count in her SAC. Nonetheless, the Court will still consider 
whether it is appropriate to pierce the corporate veil."
256,105," The Court also notes that the Plaintiff fails to provide a choice of law analysis. The Court may have to apply foreign law to

America. See Fish & Neave v. Perovetz, No. 91 CIV. 7047 (CSH), 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20228, 1993 WL 7572, at *4 (S.D.N.Y.

258,118," The Plaintiff contends in her response brief that the Defendants' actions did, in fact, cause her to involuntarily contribute 
capital and resources to the racketeering scheme. See Pl.'s Resp. Br., at 51-52. But the Plaintiff does not cite any allegations in 
her SAC supporting her claim. She only cites case law. Id. "
260,1," On January 5, 2015, District Judge Robert J. Shelby referred this case to the undersigned Magistrate Judge under 28 U.S.C. § 
636(b)(1)(B). (ECF No. 3.)"
260,2," Pursuant to D.U. Civ. R. 7-1(f), the undersigned finds oral argument unnecessary and will make its recommendation based on 
the Amended Complaint and written memoranda. "
265,3," 15 U.S.C. § 3 effectively applies 15 U.S.C. § 1 to the District of Columbia and the United States territories. Thus to the extent 
Ms. Van Ornum asserts claims under this statute, they suffer from the same plausibility defects as the 15 U.S.C. § 1 antitrust 
claims. "
276,1," Because this case is before the Court on motions to dismiss, the facts are set forth as alleged in the Complaint. (Doc. No. 1.) "
278,2," ""Noerr-Pennington"" refers to two cases: E. R. R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 
523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); and United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 
(1965)."
278,3," Momenta disputes whether the Eleventh Circuit's opinion in Delong Equipment Co., 840 F.2d 843 at 855 n.16, can truly be read 
as endorsing the rule later adopted more explicitly by the Third and Ninth Circuits. The Court's review of the Eleventh Circuit's 
opinion confirms that, at the very least, that court assumed that the rule allowing an integrated reading of the general venue 
statute and Section 12 was applicable. In any event, a detailed parsing of this single out-of-circuit case is of little importance to 
the Court's decision here. "
280,4," ""Elasticity"" refers to ""the responsiveness of a dependent economic variable to changes in influencing factors."" Elasticity, 
Merriam-Webster Dictionary (online ed.). A product with highly elastic demand, then, would be one for which demand would 
dramatically decrease in response to an increase in price. Also relevant to the apportionment of the overcharge is the degree of 
competition in the market for the relevant product. Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 742."
280,5," Similarly, if a contract has a fixed-quantity provision but calls for a fixed price rather than cost-plus pricing, any increase in cost 
will be borne by the middleman—rendering indirect purchaser liability particularly inappropriate. "
281,6," Another potential source for elasticity is the fact that a hospital's patient population may not necessarily be static. One can 
imagine, for example, a hospital that specializes in a particular type of care, but then faces an increase in the costs of that type 
of care due to an increase in the related pharmaceutical prices. That hospital might choose to focus its resources on other areas 
of treatment, and by extension other patients. Again, this is not to say that anything of the sort has happened or would happen 
here—merely that the factual assumptions underlying the functional equivalent analysis are more complex than they may seem 
at first blush. "
290,1," Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration also referred to the new allegations in the proposed second amended complaint as ""[n]ew 
evidence."" (Pls.' Mot. at 11.) In response, defendants argued that all of the ""new evidence"" was available to plaintiffs four months 
before the hearing on their motions to dismiss, and therefore plaintiffs could not move for reconsideration on the basis of new 
evidence. (McCormick Opp. at 4-7; Wal-Mart Opp. at 3-4.) In reply, plaintiffs clarified that they are seeking reconsideration only 
on the basis of legal error. (Pls.' Reply at 2-4, ECF No. 119 (redacted version at ECF No. 116).) "
293,2," The parties have also obscured the issue of anticompetitive effect by referring to supracompetitive prices without specifying 
whether they mean (1) only retail prices or also wholesale prices and (2) branded prices, private-label prices, or both. In addition, 
the parties have failed to explain why it is or is not plausible that defendants' conduct caused (or was likely to cause) prices to 
rise above competitive levels. "
295,1," As a department of the City, SFMTA cannot be sued individually. See Cal. Gov't Code §§ 23000, 23004. All claims asserted 
against SFMTA are deemed to be asserted against the City. "
296,2," Plaintiff and all defendants who have been served have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). Although a magistrate judge does not have jurisdiction over an action unless all parties have 
consented, this Court does not require the consent of defendants who have not been served as they are not parties. See 
Buckley v. Wagstaffe, No. 15-CV-06231-DMR, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61976, 2016 WL 2641541, at *1 (N.D. Cal. May 10, 2016) 
(citing Neals v. Norwood, 59 F.3d 530, 532 (5th Cir. 1995) (holding that magistrate judge had jurisdiction to dismiss prison 
inmate's action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as frivolous without consent of defendants because defendants had not been served yet 
and therefore were not parties); United States v. Real Prop., 135 F.3d 1312, 1317 (9th Cir. 1998) (holding that magistrate judge 
had jurisdiction to enter default judgment in in rem forfeiture action even though property owner had not consented to it because 
28 U.S.C. § 636(c)(1) only requires the consent of the parties and the property owner, having failed to comply with the applicable 
filing requirements, was not a party))."
296,3," Missud also alleges here, as he has in several of his prior actions, that he is a federal informant. See Missud I, 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 15607, 2013 WL 450391, at *1; Notice of Removal (""NOR,"" dkt. no. 1), Ex. A (""Compl.,"" dkt. no. 1-1)."
296,4," In this Order, the Court refers to several documents filed in Case 537723. None of the documents in that case were assigned 
docket numbers. The Court identifies documents from the docket of Case 537723 by name and date only. That docket can be 
accessed from the Superior Court's online services webpage ( http://sfsuperiorcourt.org/online-services ). "
299,5," During Missud I, the district court issued a summons for the City and AutoReturn. See Missud I, Summons, dkt. no. 25. 
However, Missud never served AutoReturn properly. See Missud I, Order Re Service of Summons, dkt. no. 42 (""As [Missud] has 
not filed proof that Defendants have been properly served under Rule 4, this Court will not consider any further filings until he 
files such proof.""). The district court entered judgment without AutoReturn appearing in the case. See Missud I, Judgment, dkt. 
no. 71. "
300,6," As explained below, Missud failed to serve the complaint on AutoReturn before the case was remanded to the Superior Court. 
After the remand and Case 537723 had resumed, Missud served AutoReturn. "
302,7," Throughout his Complaint, Missud replaces the letter ""s"" with dollar signs. In quoting Missud's complaint, the Court replaces the 
dollar signs with the letter ""s""."
302,8," As no amended complaint has been filed, the original complaint is the operative complaint. "
304,9," AutoReturn also asserts that, although the Complaint alleges that AutoReturn towed three of Missud's vehicles, it does not 
allege that AutoReturn towed the other two. Id. at 2 n.2. "
305,10," Missud, who does not file documents with the Court electronically, submitted the Opposition to the Court on August 16, 2016. 
The Opposition was entered into the Court's ECF docket on August 18."
305,11," Missud might be referring to Tenderloin Housing Clinic, Inc. v. Sparks, 8 Cal. App. 4th 299, 10 Cal. Rptr. 2d 371 (1992). It is 
not clear, however, how that case relates to any of the issues raised by Defendants' motions. "
308,12," The Court notes that under both federal and state law, there is significant overlap between the doctrines of collateral estoppel 
and res judicata. Following Judge Chen's lead, the undersigned addresses Missud's § 1983 claim under the doctrine of collateral 
estoppel and therefore does not reach the question of whether this claim is also barred under the doctrine of res judicata."
308,13," To the extent that the City Defendants include individuals and entities who were not properly served or were not named 
defendants in Missud's prior actions, the Ninth Circuit has recognized that collateral estoppel may be invoked by ""a defendant 
attempting to preclude a plaintiff from relitigating an issue that the plaintiff previously litigated unsuccessfully against a different 
party."" State of Idaho Potato Comm'n v. G & T Terminal Packaging, Inc., 425 F.3d 708, 714 (9th Cir. 2005). The Supreme Court 
has explained that ""[d]efensive use of collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from relitigating identical issues by merely 
'switching adversaries.'"" Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 329, 99 S. Ct. 645, 58 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1979). 
However, a court's application of the doctrine must be just and equitable. See Blonder-Tongue Labs. Inc. v. Univ. of Ill., 402 U.S. 
313, 333-34, 91 S. Ct. 1434, 28 L. Ed. 2d 788 (1971). Factors that may be considered to determine whether the assertion of 
defensive collateral estoppel is equitable include: (1) the potential for inconsistent outcomes; (2) the plaintiff's prior ability to join 
the new parties in the prior action; and (3) judicial economy. Hynix Semiconductor Inc. v. Rambus Inc., No. 00-cv-20905-RMW, 
2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10939, 2009 WL292205, at *2-6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 3, 2009). Under the facts here, the Court concludes that 
it just and equitable to permit all the City Defendants to invoke the doctrine of collateral estoppel against Missud. "
311,14," AutoReturn did not argue in its motion that Missud's claims against it are barred under the preclusion doctrines discussed 
above. Therefore, the Court does not address here whether Missud's claims against AutoReturn may be precluded for reasons 
similar to those discussed above with respect to the City Defendants, namely, that both this Court and the Superior Court 
already entered judgment against Missud on the same claims. Although this is an issue that can be raised sua sponte, the Court 
declines to do so here because it finds that the claims asserted against AutoReturn fail on other grounds. "
312,15," The City's demurrer was filed on February 3, 2015. In it, the City argues that Missud's amended complaint ""does not state any 
legally [*47]  actionable conduct by the defendant"" and cites as an example that ""Section 3294 of the Civil Code governs when 
punitive damages may be awarded against a defendant."" February 3, 2015, City's Mem. of P. & A. at 5-6; see also City's 
Demurrer. Similarly, AutoReturn argued in its March 17, 2016 demurrer that ""Civil Code section 3294 does not constitute a 
cause of action."" March 17, 2017 AutoReturn's Mem. of P. & A.; see also AutoReturn's Demurrer at 2. "
313,16," The City argued in its demurrer that Missud merely recites ""bare legal conclusions"" in support of his UCL claim and does not 
provide any factual information as to any of the provisions of the California Business and Professions Code are applicable to the 
instant case."" February 3, 2015 City's Mem. of P. & A.; see also City's Demurrer. Similarly, AutoReturn argued in its demurrer 
that Missud's allegations do not contain the specificity necessary to state a claim under the UCL. March 16, 2016 AutoReturn's 
Mem. of P. & A.; see also AutoReturn's Demurrer."
313,17," It is possible that AutoReturn is also protected by the immunity afforded private companies that carry out state regulatory 
programs. See F.T.C. v. Phoebe Putney Health Sys., Inc., 568 U.S. 216, 133 S. Ct. 1003, 1011, 185 L. Ed. 2d 43 (2013). The 
Court does not reach this question, however, because Missud has not alleged any conduct that is actionable under the UCL. "
314,18," The City argued in its demurrer as follows: Lastly, plaintiff claims that the City violated the [CFCA]. The CFCA allows the government . . . , through the Attorney 
General [*52]  or local prosecutors, or individual citizens to bring civil actions to recover damages, penalties and costs 
when government contractors, vendors or others defraud the government. For purposes of the CFCA, ""government"" 
includes local governmental entities . . . . Here, plaintiff merely cites to the definition of a ""claim"" under the CFCA and fails 
to identify any other section of the Code that would be applicable to his cause of action. Because plaintiff has fails [sic] to 
identify any action taken by defendant that could form the basis of a cause of action, this demurrer must be sustained. Feb. 3, 2015 City Demurrer at 6-7. AutoReturn argued in its demurrer that Missud ""failed to allege the necessary facts to state a 
claim under the False Claims Act."" March 16, 2016 AutoReturn Demurrer at 3. "
317,1," During the relevant period, US Airways was a stand-alone corporation. In December 2013, US Airways Group and AMR 
Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, Inc., merged to form American Airlines Group, Inc., and US Airways 
became a wholly owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group, Inc. "
323,2," US Airways presented evidence that, without considering travel agent incentives, Sabre charged supracompetitive prices, and 
therefore US Airways had damages, ranging from $44.5 million to $73.2 million, depending on whether a $1.35 or $0 booking 
fee benchmark is used. (PX-1184.) US Airways' experts also explained that, even accounting for travel agency incentives in a 
two-sided market, Sabre had lower but still supracompetitive prices. (Tr. 2361:20-2362:25; 2453:24-2454:5; 2514:8-20.) 
Although the jury found that the relevant market was one-sided, it also hypothetically found damages of approximately $5 million 
if the market were two-sided. "
324,3," The jury in the present case was instructed: A second dispute, which you must also decide, is whether the market is one-sided or two-sided. US Airways contends that 
the market is one-sided and that you should consider only the impact on the airline side when you evaluate the issue of 
harm to competition. Sabre contends that the market is two-sided and that you should consider the net competitive impact 
of the restraints both on the airline side and on the travel agent side when you are assessing harm to competition. [*28] Two-sidedness is a special concept in antitrust economics. In a two-sided market, a firm sells two different products or 
services to two different groups of consumers, and demand from one group of consumers depends on the demand from the 
other group. However, a market is not two-sided merely because there are customers on both sides, such as buyers and 
sellers brought together by an intermediary. The market in this case is considered two-sided if the two sides are 
interdependent such that a change in price on one side of the market affects demand on the other side. (Tr. 5626:4-22.) "
325,4," See Oz Shy, A Short [*31]  Survey of Network Economics, 38 Review of Indus. Org. 119, 136 (2011) (""The example of 
payment cards highlights the limitation of the two-sided market theory, because under full capacity no new spillovers between 
buyers and merchants can be created. More precisely, no additional network effects can be generated once most buyers already 
use payment cards and most merchants accept merchant cards. Therefore, policy conclusions of two-sided market models 
should be confined to immature markets."") (emphasis added); Alan Frankel and Allan L. Shampine, The Economic Effects of 
Interchange Fees, 73 Antitrust L. J. 627, 655 (2006) (""By its nature, a network externality is likely to become less important . . . 
as a network matures.""). "
327,5," The ""legacy"" carriers refers to the older airline carriers that existed prior to deregulation of the airline industry -- American, 
Continental, Delta, Northwest, United and US Airways. (Tr. 993:13-22.)"
327,6," When asked to assume hypothetically that the relevant market was two-sided, the jury also determined that US Airways 
""proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Sabre unreasonably restrained trade in the relevant market by means of the 
challenged contract provisions."" The evidence was sufficient to support this finding as well. US Airways presented evidence to 
show that even in a two-sided market, taking into account incentives paid to the travel agents, Sabre's net prices were 
supracompetitive. See supra note 2, at 15-16; (Tr. 1903:11-18; 5486:3-5487:12; PX-777.) US Airways' evidence regarding 
reduced quality and technological stagnation in the market is unaffected by a determination that the market is one-sided or two-
sided. See supra at 24. US Airways also presented indirect evidence of harm in the two-sided market, by showing Sabre's 
market power plus lack of innovation and technological stagnation, which harmed both sides of the market. See infra at 27-29."
327,7," Sabre disputes the ""could harm competition"" aspect of this statement of the law, which was also reflected in the Court's jury 
instruction. Sabre asserts that MacDermid raised the standard for the indirect method by requiring ""some evidence that the 
challenged action has already had an adverse effect on competition."" 833 F.3d at 182. Sabre misunderstands MacDermid. 
MacDermid was primarily concerned with what ""plus factors"" would be sufficient under the indirect test. The difference in 
language between MacDermid and the Second Circuit's other cases outlining the indirect test is not substantive. See, e.g., 
Amex, 838 F.3d at 195 (""could harm competition""); Tops Mkts., 142 F.3d at 96 (""sufficient market power to cause an adverse 
effect on competition"") (citation omitted); Capital Imaging Assocs., 996 F.2d at 546 (""potential for genuine adverse effects on 
competition""); K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs., 61 F.3d at 129 (""will harm competition market-wide""). The indirect test is a ""proxy"" for "
328,," showing through direct evidence that an adverse effect has already occurred. Tops Mkts., 142 F.3d at 97. ""[D]espite the 
differences in phrasing, our cases have always required, as a practical matter, some evidence that the challenged action has 
already had an adverse effect on competition . . . ."" MacDermid, 833 F.3d at 182. The indirect test is a method of testing for 
adverse effect ""even if consumers have not yet felt that effect."" Id. An effect not yet felt by consumers may be difficult to prove 
empirically, but may be proved indirectly and circumstantially, with proof of market power plus some basis to believe that the 
challenged behavior could harm competition. See id. at 182-83 (""How 'actual harm' is shown [i.e. directly or indirectly] 
determines whether proof of market power is also required."")."
328,8," At trial, US Airways presented evidence that Sabre did not have market power over Southwest Airlines and, therefore, that 
Southwest's booking fee of $1.35 represented a reasonably competitive booking fee. (Tr. 1351:8-15.) Stiglitz explained that 
Southwest was not subject to the same contractual restraints as the legacy airlines and had a different business model than the "
329,," legacy carriers. Southwest relies less on business travelers who book through corporate travel agents and in turn through the 
GDSs, and relies more on the Southwest website to connect directly to travelers. (Tr. 1301:18-1302:12; 1306:13-1307:9.) "
330,9," At the time of this Opinion's issuance, volumes 6 to 14 of Phillip E. Areeda and Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, have not 
been released in the Fourth edition."
330,10," Contrary to Sabre's assertion, the Court did not rule ""as a matter of law"" that Sabre had met its burden regarding the existence 
of procompetitive effects. The sentence that Sabre cites appears in the Court's summary judgment opinion in the middle of a 
paragraph listing the arguments Sabre made about the procompetitive effects of the agreement. US Airways, Inc. v. Sabre 
Holdings Corp., 105 F. Supp. 3d 265, 283 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). The only conclusion was that Sabre's assertions regarding 
procompetitive effects were sufficient to meet its burden to offer evidence that the contract had procompetitive effects in step two 
of the rule of reason for purposes of summary judgment. Id. "
332,11," The fallacy of Sabre's argument is illustrated by the factual context. The parties entered into the 2011 Contract on February 
23, 2011. US Airways promptly filed this action on April 21, 2011, challenging the full content provisions in the 2006 contract and 
its successor, the 2011 Contract. On Sabre's motion for summary judgment, the Court accepted Sabre's argument that US 
Airways' claim for damages arising out of the 2006 agreement was outside the 4-year statute of limitations, in part, because the 
claims accrued on the date that the 5-year contract took effect, and rejected US Airways' argument that the cause of action 
accrues on the date the overcharges are paid. See US Airways, 105 F. Supp. 3d at 277-78. The Court accordingly limited the 
damages period to damages incurred under the 2011 Contract. Id. at 279. Sabre implies that if US Airways believed that it was 
charged supracompetitive prices under the 2011 Contract, it should have alleged that they were caused by the 2006 contractual 
restraints (which were extended in the 2011 contract). Sabre's argument would mean that, no matter how many times the parties 
extended their 5-year contract, US Airways would never have a timely claim -- overpayments on any given contract would 
necessarily occur more than 4 years after the inception of the preceding contract. "
333,12, Any of Sabre's many arguments that were not addressed herein have been considered and rejected. 
353,1," ""Peachtree"" collectively refers to the plaintiffs/appellants/cross-appellees: Settlement Funding, LLC; a related entity, Peachtree 
Settlement 
Funding, 
LLC; 
and 
an 
individual 
annuitant, 
Evelyn 
Franklin. 
""Rapid"" 
collectively 
refers 
to 
the 
defendants/appellees/cross-appellants: Rapid Settlements, Limited; a related entity, Rapid Management Corporation; Stewart A. 
Feldman, an individual who owns and manages these companies; and another related entity, RSL Funding, LLC. "
354,2," This court has previously described the structured settlement payment industry in greater detail. See Symetra Life Ins. Co. v. 
Rapid Settlements, Ltd., 775 F.3d 242, 245-46 (5th Cir. 2014)."
354,3," Although Franklin was a New York resident, Peachtree sued Rapid, which is based in Texas, in Texas court."
354,4," This litigation has involved numerous amended, consolidated, and severed claims and suits relating to similar allegations of 
tortious conduct by Rapid."
354,5," ""Wentworth Parties"" collectively refers to J.G. Wentworth SSC LP; JGWPT Holdings, LLC; JLL Partners, Inc.; David Miller; and 
JG Wentworth Originations, LLC. Some of the Wentworth Parties appear to hold ownership stakes in the same entities that 
comprise Peachtree—Settlement Funding, LLC, and Peachtree Settlement Funding, LLC. In other words, at the risk of some 
oversimplification, the Wentworth Parties are members of Peachtree. However, Rapid's claims against the Wentworth parties 
were distinct from its litigation with Peachtree."
354,6," The third-party claims were brought by RSL Funding, LLC."
354,7," The Wentworth Parties asserted that Rapid's state law civil conspiracy claim, which alleged that the Wentworth Parties entered 
into improper agreements with other companies in the structured-settlement-purchasing business to refrain from interfering with 
their contracts, implicated federal antitrust law and thus raised a federal question. "
355,8, The party's claims were referred to a magistrate judge for all proceedings.
355,9," Because we are not satisfied that there is subject matter jurisdiction, we do not reach the merits of Peachtree's appeal."
355,10," Neither party has raised whether the Wentworth Parties, as third-party defendants, were entitled to remove the case at all 
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441, cf., e.g., First Nat. Bank of Pulaski v. Curry, 301 F.3d 456, 461-63 (6th Cir. 2002) (""[T]hird-party 
defendants do not have a statutory right of removal pursuant to § 1441(a).""), or whether they were entitled to remove the case 
six years after the commencement of the state court action, see 28 U.S.C. § 1446(c)(1) (""A case may not be removed . . . on the 
basis of jurisdiction conferred by section 1332 [diversity jurisdiction] more than 1 year after commencement of the action.""). "
356,11," In its Supplemental Jurisdictional Brief, Peachtree argues that in a joint case management plan Rapid admitted that it was 
pursuing a claim for federal antitrust violations. It stated that RSL Funding ""seeks damages for alleged violations of federal 
antitrust law."" Whether a federal question arises, however, is determined from the face of the plaintiff's complaint, and no more. 
See Hart v. Bayer Corp., 199 F.3d 239, 244 (5th Cir. 2000) (""If, on its face, the plaintiff's complaint raises no issue of federal law, 
federal question jurisdiction is lacking.""); accord, e.g., R.I. Fishermen's All., Inc. v. Rhode Island Dep't Of Envtl. Mgmt., 585 F.3d 
42, 48 (1st Cir. 2009) (""[T]he plaintiff's well-pleaded complaint must exhibit, within its four corners, either an explicit federal 
cause of action or a state-law cause of action that contains an embedded question of federal law that is both substantial and 
disputed."") (emphasis added). Regardless of its intentions, Rapid never amended its third-party complaint to reflect that it sought 
damages for violations of federal antitrust law. For the reasons stated, the third-party complaint does not, on its face, raise a 
federal question."
356,12, Recall that the Wentworth Parties were subsequently dismissed by settlement and are no longer parties to this litigation. 
357,13," Peachtree admitted that it does not know the citizenship of every member of two entities, JLL Fund V AIF I, L.P. (""AIF I"") and 
JLL Fund V AIF II, L.P. (""AIF II""), which it in turn admitted are members of an entity called JLL JGW Distribution, LLC, which is, 
according to Mayer, an indirect member of both Settlement Funding, LLC, and Peachtree Settlement Funding, LLC. Peachtree 
also failed to describe the limited partner(s) of an entity called JLL Associates V, LP, which is also, according to Mayer, an 
indirect member of both Settlement Funding, LLC, and Peachtree Settlement Funding, LLC."
357,14," Peachtree contends that although complete diversity was not established at the time of removal, the parties were indisputably 
diverse at the time of judgment as a result of corporate changes in their respective citizenship. Continuing, Peachtree further 
argues that diversity jurisdiction may be established based on the state of facts that existed at either the time of removal, or, as 
in this case, at the time of judgment; it cites Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 117 S. Ct. 467, 136 L. Ed. 2d 437 (1996), for 
the proposition that courts may look to diversity as it existed at the time of judgment if a party (as here, the Wentworth Parties) is 
dismissed by settlement during the course of the litigation. This argument is void of merit. The Supreme Court in Grupo 
expounded: ""all challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction [are] premised upon diversity of citizenship against the state of facts that 
existed at the time of [removal]-whether the challenge be brought shortly after filing, after the trial, or even for the first time on 
appeal."" Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Glob. Grp., L.P., 541 U.S. 567, 571, 124 S. Ct. 1920, 158 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2004). It noted that 
Caterpillar reflected a single exception to the virtually inviolable rule because ""the jurisdictional defect it addressed had been 
cured by the dismissal of the party that had destroyed diversity."" Id. Peachtree cannot argue that this case comes within this 
exception because it admits that it cannot show that the remaining parties were completely diverse at the time of removal. "
358,15," Peachtree suggests that, were we to remand this case to the district court for additional factfinding, it may be able to 
determine the citizenship of the entities whose citizenship as it existed at the time of removal is currently unknown. Peachtree 
and its parent company, the J.G. Wentworth Corporation, are sophisticated entities represented by a large, multinational law 
firm. Peachtree admitted in its supplemental brief filed on December 28, 2016, that ""[d]espite expending considerable resources 
and diligently endeavoring to determine the constituency of [the unknown-citizenship entities at the time of removal], [Peachtree] 
cannot feasibly trace each investing entity back to a corporation or a natural person."" Peachtree has not, in the months since, 
supplemented the record or otherwise indicated that it has ascertained, or will be ever able to ascertain, the citizenship of those 
unknown-citizenship entities. Nor has it explained how remand will allow it to obtain information that is not currently available. 
Accordingly, remand to the district court for this purpose only forestalls the ultimate dismissal of the case as we have discussed 
above."
358,16, All pending motions are denied as moot.

402,1, Gultek is one of the owners of both companies.
402,2," The display boxes state either Oakley or Ray Ban, not both, and use ""Ray Ban"" without the hyphen. (Document Nos. 24-14, 
24-15, 24-16). "
404,3," The Court in Bausch & Lomb goes on to explain that, despite the descriptive nature of the individual words ""ray"" and ""ban,"" 
when the words are joined together ""they gain a new meaning, one that is only suggestive of the product the name identifies."" 
Bausch & Lomb Inc. v. Nevitt Sales Corp., 810 F. Supp. 466, 470-71 (W.D.N.Y. 1993) (citations omitted)."
404,4," Even if Oakley is a geographic trademark it is still protected in this context. Geographically descriptive trademarks are not 
inherently distinctive, but can be protected under the Lanham Act if they have achieved secondary meaning. Pebble Beach Co. 
v. Tour 18 I, Ltd., 942 F. Supp. 1513, 1538 (S.D. Tex. 1996), aff'd as modified, 155 F.3d 526 (5th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). 
The Oakley trademark indisputably has achieved secondary meaning, because it is incontestable. Soweco, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., 
617 F.2d 1178, 1184-85 (5th Cir. 1980) (""An 'incontestable' mark cannot be challenged as lacking secondary meaning; such 
marks are conclusively presumed to be nondescriptive or to have acquired secondary meaning."") (citation omitted)."
404,5," Defendants argue that this factor is irrelevant in a comparative advertising context, ""since competitors won't be willing to 
compare their products with a mark that is weaker than theirs."" (Document No. 25 at 36). However, Defendants cite no case law 
for this proposition. Defendants also make general objections to the admission to some of Plaintiffs' evidence on the subject, but 
fail to do so with specificity. See Payne v. Park, No. 3:11-CV-0497-B, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100978, 2012 WL 2958624, at *4 
(N.D. Tex. July 19, 2012) (""FED. R. EVID. 103(a)(1) requires an objecting party to make specific objections detailing the specific 
evidence the party wishes to have stricken and stating the specific grounds upon which each piece of evidence should be 
stricken."") (citing Brockie v. Ameripath, Inc ., No. 3:06-CV-0185-G, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29672, 2007 WL 1187984, at *6 "
405,," (N.D.Tex. Apr. 23, 2007)); United States v. Avants, 367 F.3d 433, 445 (5th Cir. 2004)). Therefore Defendants' objections are 
overruled. "
406,6," It is not proper for the Court to weigh the credibility of Gultek at the summary judgment stage. Heinsohn v. Carabin & Shaw, 
P.C., 832 F.3d 224, 245 (5th Cir. 2016) (citations omitted). "
407,7," ""Summary judgment on behalf of a plaintiff in a trademark or unfair competition case can be difficult to obtain, but certainly not 
impossible if the facts of liability are clear."" McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 32:121 (4th ed.) (citations 
omitted). The Court believes that other cases within the Fifth Circuit granting summary judgment for the plaintiff are 
distinguishable. For example, in Texas Tech University v. Spiegelberg, there was evidence of the defendant's bad faith intent as 
well as actual confusion, the ""best evidence"" of a likelihood of confusion. 461 F. Supp. 2d 510, 523 (N.D. Tex. 2006); see also 
Bd. of Supervisors for Louisiana State Univ. Agric. & Mech. Coll. v. Smack Apparel Co., 550 F.3d 465, 483 (5th Cir. 2008) 
(granting summary judgment for plaintiff based partially upon defendant's clear intent to profit from plaintiff's reputation). 
Furthermore, Cartier, Inc. v. Deziner Wholesale, LLC, which is cited extensively by Plaintiffs, is not binding on this Court, as it is 
an unpublished New York case. No. 98 CIV. 4947 (RLC), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4157, 2000 WL 347171, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 
2000) (granting summary judgment for plaintiff). "
408,8," Federal dilution law was revised in 2006, by the enactment of the ""Trademark Dilution Revision Act"" or ""TDRA."" McCarthy § 
24:101; Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Texas Sys. ex rel. Univ. of Texas at Austin v. KST Elec., Ltd., 550 F. Supp. 2d 657, 673 
(W.D. Tex. 2008)."
408,9, These factors are: (i) The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark. (ii) The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark. (iii) The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark. 
409,, (iv) The degree of recognition of the famous mark. (v) Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the famous mark. (vi) Any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark.
409,15, U.S.C. § 1125(c)(2)(B).
409,10," Notably, ""'[f]ame' is a different concept for applying the dilution rule than for the likelihood of confusion rule. The standard for 
the kind of 'fame' needed to trigger anti-dilution protection is more rigorous and demanding than the 'fame' which is sufficient for 
the classic likelihood of confusion test."" McCarthy § 24:104 (citations omitted). Therefore, the Court's finding above that Plaintiffs' 
marks are strong and well-known does not also demonstrate that they are famous."
409,11," ""One way to evidence the extent of actual recognition of the mark would be through the use of a survey. A survey is direct, not 
circumstantial, evidence of the perceptions of the consuming public."" Id. at § 24:106 (citation omitted). Plaintiffs do not provide 
this direct evidence, and without it the Court is particularly reluctant to find that the Ray-Ban and Oakley marks are famous at the 
summary judgment stage."
409,12," As discussed above, both marks are registered. ""However, as the leading commentator notes, '[o]ne cannot logically infer 
fame from the fact that a mark is one of the millions on the federal Register. On the other hand, one could logically infer lack of 
fame from a lack of registration ....'"" Bd. of Regents, Univ. of Texas Sys. ex rel. Univ. of Texas at Austin v. KST Elec., Ltd., 
550 F. Supp. 2d 657, 675 (W.D. Tex. 2008) (citing McCarthy § 24:106). "
410,13, Presumably Defendants meant to raise the defense of acquiescence. 
411,14," Plaintiffs cite to the Declaration of Jason Groppe, who is assistant general counsel of litigation at Luxottica. (Document No. 32-
2). "
412,15," ""It is unclear whether the Fifth Circuit [even] recognizes a separate defense of waiver [...] in the trademark context,"" RE/MAX 
Int'l, Inc. v. Trendsetter Realty, LLC, 655 F. Supp. 2d 679, 711 n.12 (S.D. Tex. 2009), and Defendants do not cite any case law 
supporting a defense of waiver in the trademark context. "
415,1," The named plaintiffs are John Nypl; Lisa McCarthy; Mad Travel, Inc., a.k.a. Travel Leaders; Valarie Jolly; Go Everywhere, Inc.; 
and William Rubinsohn, d.b.a. Rubinsohn Travel."
415,2," Defendants are JPMorgan Chase & Co.; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.; J.P. Morgan Bank, N.A.; Bank of America Corporation; 
Bank of America, N.A.; HSBC Finance Corporation; HSBC Bank USA, N.A.; HSBC North America Holdings Inc.; HSBC Holdings 
plc; Citicorp; Citigroup, Inc.; Citibank, N. A; UBS AG; Barclays PLC; Barclays Capital, Inc.; Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc; 
and Royal Bank of Scotland, plc. "
423,1, Capitalized terms (other than proper nouns) that are not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Stipulation. 
435,1," See Thompson v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., No. 2:16-cv-1183 (D. Utah) (transferred from the Southern District of California on 
November 21, 2016); Stillings v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., No. 2:16-cv-1257 (D. Utah) (transferred from the Northern District of 
California on December 8, 2016)."
435,2," The motion to transfer was also filed in the Henry action. Def.'s Mot. [No. 1:17-cv-00117, Dkt. # 6]; Def.'s Mem. [No. 1:17-cv-
00117, Dkt. # 6-1]. Any citation to defendant's motion or memorandum refers to both docket entries, unless otherwise noted."
435,3," Plaintiffs filed their joint memorandum in the Henry action as well. See Pls.' Opp. [No. 1:17-cv-00117, Dkt. # 17]. Any citation to 
plaintiffs' joint memorandum refers to both docket entries, unless otherwise noted. "
436,4," In addition to the cases filed in federal district courts across the country, there is also an ongoing administrative proceeding, 
which was initiated on August 8, 2016 by the Federal Trade Commission, against 1-800 Contacts and its competitors. See In re 
1-800 Contacts, Inc., No. 9372, 2017 FTC LEXIS 19, 2017 WL 511541 (F.T.C. Feb. 1, 2017). "
437,5," Only one competitor, Lens.com, refused to enter into an agreement and proceeded to litigate 1-800 Contacts' trademark claim 
in Utah. See 1-800 Contacts, Inc. v. Lens.com, Inc., 722 F.3d 1229 (10th Cir. 2013)."
437,6," On February 1, 2017, plaintiffs in both actions moved jointly to stay all proceedings in this Court pending the JPML's decision 
on Bartolucci's section 1407 motion to consolidate. Joint Mot. for Temporary Stay of All Proceedings Pending Ruling on Mot. for 
Transfer & Coordination by the JPML [No. 1:17-cv-00097, Dkt. # 10] (""Pls.' Joint Mot. to Stay""); Pls.' Joint Mot. to Stay [No. 1:17-
cv-00117, Dkt. # 8]. Defendant 1-800 Contacts opposed the motion to stay the next day in both cases. Def. 1-800 Contacts' 
Opp. to Pls.' Joint Mot. to Stay [No. 1:17-cv-00097, Dkt. # 12] (""Def.'s Opp. to Stay""); Def.'s Opp. to Stay [No. 1:17-cv-00117, 
Dkt. # 9]. The Court granted that motion in part on February 3, 2017, staying all proceedings other than defendant's section 
1404(a) motion to transfer. Min. Order (Feb. 3, 2017)."
437,7," Defendant Vision Direct has yet to be served or enter an appearance in the Henry action, and has not joined 1-800 Contacts' 
motion. HN1[
] The Court has broad discretion to order a transfer and may even do so sua sponte. In re Scott, 709 F.2d 717, "
438,721," , 228 U.S. App. D.C. 278 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Moreover, the Court notes that Vision Direct has not opposed transferring similar 
claims to the District of Utah. See Joint Mot. to Transfer Venue to District of Utah, Thompson v. 1-800 Contacts, Inc., No. 3:16-
cv-02552 (S.D. Cal.) [Dkt. # 20] at 2 (""Plaintiffs . . . and Defendant[] 1-800 Contacts, Inc. . . . submit this joint motion for an order 
transferring this action to the United States District Court for the District of Utah pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). Defendant 
Vision Direct, Inc. has confirmed that it also does not oppose this request.""). Thus, the Court will proceed to rule on the motion to 
transfer despite the lack of input from Vision Direct. "
439,8," The Court is also independently satisfied that both actions could have been brought in the District of Utah. Venue is proper in 
the District of Utah under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 and Section 12 of the Clayton Act because 1-800 Contacts maintains its principal 
place of business in Draper, Utah, defendant Vision Direct markets and sells its products nationwide, plaintiffs allege that 1-800 
Contacts ""engineered"" a ""hub-and-spoke"" conspiracy that would have emanated from its headquarters in Utah, and a substantial 
part of the events giving rise to plaintiffs' claims took place in Utah. See Bartolucci Compl. ¶¶ 10, 18-22; Henry Compl. ¶¶ 21, 56. 
Moreover, each corporate defendant would be subject to process in the District of Utah because they are each subject to 
personal jurisdiction there due to their establishment of business contacts in Utah by affirmatively selling and marketing their 
products. See Bartolucci Compl. ¶ 13; Henry Compl. ¶ 12; Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 473-76, 105 S. Ct. 
2174, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1985). "
443,9," The parties in the two actions before the Court agree that the seven class actions currently filed against 1-800 Contacts all 
raise virtually identical claims. See Def.'s Mem. at 5-7; Pls.' Opp. at 2; see also Pls.' Joint Notice of Filing [Dkt. # 20] (informing 
the Court of the filing of a related case in the Eastern District of Arkansas, which ""shares common questions of fact and law with 
each of the cases currently subject"" to the currently pending motion before the JPML). "
457,1," The Court's July 12, 2016 order granting Plaintiffs' motion for class certification [665] is presently on appeal to the Eleventh 
Circuit pursuant to Rule 23(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but such an appeal ""does not stay proceedings in the 
district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f). The Eleventh Circuit did not so 
order, and on October 19, 2016 this Court—consistent with the parties' wishes—declined to stay the case. "
458,2," Throughout this Order, citations to deposition testimony and to the parties' briefs are to the page numbers that appear on the 
transcript or brief itself. All other record cites refer to the page of the PDF document filed on the Court's electronic docket, not to 
the page numbers (if any) reflected on the documents being cited."
458,3," Alaska Airlines is also a legacy carrier, but it flies only regional routes."
458,4," ""Unbundling"" is somewhat of a loaded term in the context of this litigation. The Court adopts Defendants' nomenclature only for 
ease of reference. It makes no finding and expresses no opinion about whether Defendants and other airlines introduced new 
fees or simply began to separately itemize charges that had previously been ""bundled"" into ticket prices. "
459,5," Fees for second checked bags were announced by United on February 4, 2008, effective May 5; announced by US Airways on 
February 26, effective May 5; announced by Northwest on March 28, effective May 5; announced by Continental on April 4, 
effective May 5; and announced by American on April 28, effective May 12. Alaska, which as noted above is a regional legacy 
carrier, announced and implemented its second bag fee on July 1, 2008, later than its non-regional counterparts."
459,6," Following AirTran's announcement, other LCCs that had yet to introduce a second-bag fee—including JetBlue, Frontier, and 
Republic Airlines—announced in April and May 2008 that they would do so beginning in June."
459,7," On April 14, 2008, approximately four months before Northwest announced that it would implement a first-bag fee, Delta and 
Northwest had announced that they would merge, forming a combined carrier that would be called Delta and of which Anderson 
would be CEO. [350-55] at 2. "
460,8," The CLT is a group of Delta's most senior executives—including, during the time period in question, Anderson, Bastian, 
Gorman, and Hauenstein—who serve as an advisory group to the CEO. "
461,9," It turned out not to be, as Delta did not announce until November 5 that it would be imposing a first-bag fee effective December 
5."
461,10," Smith later testified that he did not recall what, if anything, he did with that information and that he did ""not always"" do what he 
told Fornaro he would. [556-1] at 1050, 1056; see also [577] at 67 (answering, in response to whether he typically followed 
through with things he tells his boss he will do: ""Normally, but not always with Mr. Fornaro. Sometimes mandates are sent out 
that I don't act on."")."
461,11," For AirTran's second-quarter 2008 earnings call held in July 2008, Fornaro had not included first-bag fees in his prepared 
remarks but had considered how he would answer a question about first-bag fees from analysts. [361-2] at 216; [560] at 91-92. 
""At that point, it was a variation of, you know, we're working on the technology, and we haven't made a decision. You know that "
462,," changed to we have the technology, and we haven't made a decision."" [361-2] at 216-217. However, as just noted, that question 
was not asked on the second-quarter earnings call."
462,12," Burman had been involved in Delta's first-bag-fee analysis. [557] at 67. Boeckhaus's responsibilities included baggage 
handling, so Fasano believed that he would be in a position to know about Delta's bag-fee policies. [582] at 130-31."
462,13," Neither Rossano nor Ringler was involved in or had knowledge of the process leading to Delta's decision to impose a first-bag 
fee. [350-40] at 64; [350-41] at 91. Rossano did participate in weekly ""baggage calls,"" but the undisputed evidence is that those 
meetings focused on ""operational performance"" and bag fees were never discussed. [584] at 148-51; [350-41] at 25, 40, 91."
462,14," Healy did relay to Wiggins and Hutchins that he had ""heard . . . that [Delta is] ready and can go anytime."" [557] at 350. "
463,15," Gorman found Fornaro's comments ""inappropriate"" in light of Defendants' antitrust training and compliance and explained that 
Delta was left in ""almost disbelief that he made such a comment."" [588] at 31. Hauenstein similarly described the statement as 
""[un]wise"" given ""antitrust compliance"" and prohibitions on discussing future pricing. [567] at 122. Bastian ""found it kind of odd . . 
. that AirTran would even talk about that topic on the call . . . [b]ecause we know not to talk about pricing matters in a public call."" 
[366] at 49. Gail Grimmett in revenue management described the conversations as ""could you believe . . . that he made a pricing 
comment on a call."" [565] at 200."
463,16," Delta disputes that the value proposition reflects the ""views"" of Delta, as Plaintiffs contend it does. Rather, Delta asserts that 
the value proposition was an ""advocacy piece"" prepared by revenue management, which opposed a first-bag fee both before 
and after October 23, 2008."
463,17," Bastian testified that he came into the October 27 CLT meeting inclined to adopt the first-bag fee but that he ""wanted to hear 
the discussion and the debate"" before firmly committing. [350-22] at 45."
463,18," In the same press release, Delta announced it was eliminating certain fuel surcharges, reducing phone-reservation charges, 
eliminating its curbside check-in fee, and reducing its second-bag fee from $50 to $25. "
465,19," None of the Daubert motions presently at issue questions the experts' qualifications, and the Court finds that each expert is 
qualified by his knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education to testify competently to the matters contained in his report."
465,20," Defendants previously moved [399] to exclude the opinions offered by Singer in support of Plaintiffs' motion for class 
certification, but those opinions are not at issue in the instant motion."
465,21," See, e.g., [269-4] at ¶ 2 (""Defendants engaged in collusion to jointly impose first bag fees.""); id. at ¶ 33 (""Delta's and AirTran's 
decisions to adopt first bag fees were the result of collusion.""); [269-8] at ¶ 1 (""Delta and AirTran engaged in an anticompetitive 
conspiracy to charge a first bag fee . . . .""); [626-4] at 882 (Singer testifying that ""Defendants in my opinion have conspired to 
raise bag fees""). "
466,22," See, e.g., [556-1] at 1562 (""Defendants' actions are more consistent with a conspiracy to jointly impose first bag fees than with 
unilateral conduct.""); id. at 1565 (concluding that ""Defendants' actions were inconsistent with unilateral conduct""); id. at 1575 
(opining that certain evidence confirms that Defendants' decisions to adopt first-bag fees ""were more consistent with conspiracy 
than unilateral conduct); id. at 1688 (replacing a prior reference to ""an anticompetitive conspiracy to charge a first bag fee"" with a 
reference to actions that ""are more consistent with conspiracy than unilateral conduct"")."
466,23," In fact, Defendants' own experts have submitted their opinions that Defendants' conduct was more consistent with unilateral 
activity than collusion. See, e.g., [632-3] at ¶ 16 (Andrew Dick opining that Defendants' conduct was ""consistent with economic 
theories and principles identifying unilateral conduct""). "
470,24," Insofar as Plaintiffs dispute the applicability of those criteria, they are free to cross-examine Dick about them, but the Court 
declines to preclude his testimony as to their relevance from an economic perspective. "
474,25," In their briefs, the parties disputed whether a heightened summary-judgment standard might apply in this case. See, e.g., 
[632-1] at 7; [643] at 9. At the hearing held on the pending motions for summary judgment, however, Defendants conceded that 
no such heightened standard applies, and even absent that concession, the Court would not find any heightened standard 
appropriate. Rather, the Court applies general summary-judgment principles subject only to the inferential limitations that apply 
in all antitrust-conspiracy cases. "
475,26," Delta increased its first-bag fee in July 2009 and then again in January 2010. AirTran kept its first-bag fee at $15 until 
September 2010. [353-29] at 35-36. "
476,27," The Eleventh Circuit has adopted as binding precedent all Fifth Circuit decisions issued before October 1, 1981. Bonner v. 
City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc). "
477,28," See [350-99] at 18 (Delta's third-quarter earnings call transcript); [350-103] at 32 (JetBlue's third-quarter earnings call 
transcript); [350-103] at 47-48 (US Airways' third-quarter earnings call transcript). The question was also asked during second-
quarter earnings calls for airlines that had already introduced it at that point. See, e.g., [350-60] at 19 (American Airlines' second-
quarter earnings call transcript)."
477,29," Plaintiffs' cursory assertion that the question Crissey posed was ""incongruent with his level of sophistication and more 
consistent with planted questions,"" [554] at n.55, is insufficient to contradict Crissey's declaration testimony for purposes of 
withstanding summary judgment. "
478,30," At the outset, AirTran suggests that a communication may be credited as a plus factor only if three criteria are satisfied, see 
[604] at 17-18, but the Court disagrees. HN28[
] Whether a communication constitutes a plus factor is an inquiry not 
susceptible to determination by any rigid test. In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig., 782 F.3d 867, 878 (7th Cir. 2015), on which 
AirTran relies, did not treat any particular factors as dispositive; it merely suggested that the evidence before it would have been 
more persuasive if those factors were present. And Plaintiffs correctly point out that the causation requirement AirTran would 
impose improperly puts the cart before the horse in the context of a motion for summary judgment in a § 1 conspiracy claim. 
However, the other considerations identified by AirTran—the parties to the conversation, the detail of its contents, and its timing 
vis-à-vis the challenged action—are certainly among those relevant to whether a communication constitutes a plus factor. "
479,31," Indeed, Jack Smith confirmed that AirTran was ""always looking to see what the grapevine is . . . on what other competitors 
[were] doing,"" even though such information usually came in the form of ""gossip, chatter, and rumors"" that were of unreliable 
accuracy. [360] at 69-70. "
483,32," Nine of Plaintiffs' exhibits—Exhibits 444, 446-452, and 454—were timely provided to the Court for filing in connection with 
Plaintiffs' opposition to Defendants' motions for summary judgment but inadvertently omitted from the docket. These documents 
have been provided to the Clerk's office today for filing to ensure that the record is complete, and nothing about their belated 
entries on the docket should suggest that they were not available for the Court's review in connection with the pending motions. "

503,2," Unless otherwise noted, the facts are taken from the second consolidated amended class action complaint (""SAC""), Dkt. No. 
102, and are accepted as true for the purposes of this Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See, e.g., Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 
147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002). However, HN1[
] ""[t]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a 
complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "
504,3," The ""spot price"" refers to the current market price of the underlying physical commodity. "
506,4," As in the SAC, this opinion will refer to platinum and palladium bullion and platinum and palladium bullion coins, platinum and 
palladium futures traded on NYMEX and other U.S. exchanges, shares of platinum and palladium ETFs, OTC platinum and 
palladium, and platinum and palladium spot or forward transactions and options, or any of the foregoing, as ""Platinum and 
Palladium Investments."" SAC ¶ 22 n.13. "
507,5," Although the Court must accept all facts alleged in the SAC as true, see infra Part III.A, the Court observes that, in connection 
with their allegations that Defendants engaged in such practices, Plaintiffs point to statements in HSBC's and UBS's settlements 
with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA"") to impute 
HSBC's and UBS's conduct leading up to the settlements to the Defendants in this action. While the Court accepts as true the 
allegations that these statements were made, as noted above, it does not accept as true the implicit suggestion that all 
Defendants engaged in such conduct. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "
509,6," Although Plaintiffs are unable at this stage to quantify each individual Defendant's short position in the futures and OTC 
markets, they rely on publicly available data in support of this claim. See SAC ¶ 192-193. "
510,7," Although UBS filed a separate motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), because UBS joined the 
remaining Defendants' motion, see Dkt. No. 113 at 1 n.1, references to ""Defendants"" in Parts III.B-III.D of this opinion include 
UBS. UBS's stand-alone motion is addressed separately below. See Part III.F. "
511,8," Unless otherwise noted, the legal standard set forth below governs the Court's analysis of Defendants' motion to dismiss. "
514,9," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' conspiracy allegations rely almost exclusively on the opinions of unidentified experts, and that 
the Court may not consider those opinions at the motion to dismiss stage. Defs.' Joint Br. at 19-24. HN9[
] There is a difference 
between expert opinions, which the Court does not rely on, and allegations based on those opinions, which the Court may rely 
on—and has relied on—in analyzing whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim. See, e.g., In re Silver, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
137746, 2016 WL 5794777, at *17 (""The Court is not, however[,] relying on Plaintiffs' opinions (expert or otherwise) but rather on 
Plaintiffs' factual assertions regarding pricing and other economic data, which courts generally accept at the pleading stage."") 
(emphasis in original) (citations omitted). The Second Circuit and district courts in this circuit routinely rely on expert and 
statistical analyses contained in pleadings. See, e.g., Carpenters Pension Trust Fund of St. Louis v. Barclays PLC., 750 F.3d 
227, 234 n.8 (2d Cir. 2014) (relying on, among other things, plaintiff's expert economic analysis showing loss causation); In re 
LIBOR-Based Fin. Instruments Antitrust Litig. (""LIBOR I"") 935 F. Supp. 2d 666, 716-17 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (accepting plaintiffs' 
proffered expert data analyses comparing LIBOR rates to other data), vacated and remanded sub nom. on other grounds by, 
Gelboim, 823 F.3d 759; Dover v. British Airways, PLC (UK), No. 12-cv-5567, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10565, 2014 WL 317845, at 
*2 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2014) [*45]  (noting that plaintiff's statistical analysis of prices ""is a factual allegation that the Court must 
credit""); Fed. Hous. Fin. Agency v. UBS Americas, Inc., 858 F. Supp. 2d 306, 332 (S.D.N.Y. 2012), aff'd, 712 F.3d 136 (2d 
Cir. 2013) (addressing plaintiffs' internal review of a sampled subset of loan files and valuation models at the motion to dismiss 
stage). "
516,10," Although Defendants do not appear to contest Plaintiffs' constitutional standing to bring a Sherman Act claim, their arguments 
concerning Plaintiffs' failure adequately to plead an antitrust injury is relevant to both constitutional standing and the antitrust 
standing inquires. See, e.g., Defs.' Joint Br. at 25 (arguing that Plaintiffs' allegations fall short of adequately pleading an antitrust 
injury because ""Plaintiffs only assert that 'manipulation of the Fixing impacted . . . transactions and caused Plaintiffs and the 
Class to incur greater losses and/or realize lower prices than they would have realized in a free and open competitive market'"") 
(quoting SAC ¶ 247); see also id. at 36. Accordingly, before proceeding to the parties' arguments concerning Plaintiffs' Sherman 
Act claim, the Court must first satisfy itself that Plaintiffs have constitutional standing to pursue this claim; the Court can raise the 
issue sua sponte. E.g., Cent. States Se. & Sw. Areas Health & Welfare Fund v. Merck-Medco Managed Care, L.L.C., 433 F.3d 
181, 198 (2d Cir. 2005) (HN12[
] ""Because the standing issue goes to this Court's subject matter jurisdiction, it can be raised 
sua sponte."") (citing United States v. Quinones, 313 F.3d 49, 57-58 (2d Cir. 2002)); see also Thomas v. City of New York, 143 
F.3d 31, 34 (2d Cir. 1998) (noting that because of the ""Article III limitations on judicial power . . . the court can raise [an Article III 
issue] sua sponte""); Schwartz v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., No. 14 CIV. 9525 (KPF), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3410, 2017 WL 95118, 
at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2017) (reasoning that that the court has an ""'independent obligation to consider the presence or absence "
517,," of subject matter jurisdiction sua sponte . . . [including] whether a plaintiff has standing under Article III to pursue its claim'"") 
(quoting Jennifer Matthew Nursing & Rehab. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Human Servs., 607 F.3d 951, 955 (2d Cir. 2010)). "
518,11," Although the Second Circuit has not directly addressed this issue, it has cited with approval the D.C. Circuit's ""holding that 
statutory standing under the antitrust laws is not a prerequisite to federal subject matter jurisdiction."" Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 
318 F.3d 113, 128 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 289 F.3d 98, 107-08, 351 U.S. App. D.C. 
223 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (""Unlike constitutional standing, this court's jurisdiction does not turn on antitrust standing."")); see also 
Paulsen v. Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, 773 F.3d 462, 468 (2d Cir. 2014) (reasoning that ""statutory standing is not 
jurisdictional unless Congress says so"") "
522,12," Since Gelboim, at least one other court has found non-direct plaintiffs to be efficient enforcers. See Merced Irrigation Dist. v. 
Barclays Bank PLC, No. 15 CIV. 4878 (VM), 220 F. Supp. 3d 412, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163006, 2016 WL 6820738, at *4 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 10, 2016). In Merced, the plaintiff did not deal directly with Barclays, but instead ""ended up on the wrong side of 
an independent"" contract, the terms of which referenced the indexes allegedly manipulated by Barclays. Id. (citations omitted). 
The court recognized that it was ""unclear how many entities are parties to contracts that reference the indexes at issue"" and 
that, ""if Barclays were to be held responsible for all of them, it would greatly expand Barclay's potential liability."" Id. Nevertheless, 
the court concluded that ""this factor is unlikely to have as much weight as it did in Gelboim, where innumerable financial "
523,," instruments all over the world relied upon LIBOR to determine rates of return, because the scope of Merced's action is limited to 
contracts which settled against the indexes at four Western United States based trading hubs."" Id. (internal quotation marks and 
citations omitted) (emphasis added). The limited scope of the plaintiffs' transactions in Merced is not present here. "
527,13," Defendants' reliance on Parkcentral Global Hub, Ltd. V. Porsche Automobile Holdings SE is unavailing. In Parkcentral, the 
Second Circuit applied the Morrison and Absolute Activist tests to claims under § 10(b) against foreign defendants for securities 
transactions relating to securities-based swap agreements pegged to the foreign defendants' stock"
527,14," The Court notes that, although Plaintiffs cite several paragraphs in the SAC as support for their assertion that the OTC 
transactions at issue are limited to transactions where liability was incurred or title was transferred in the United States, the 
allegations in the SAC are not so limited. In light of the Court's conclusion, and the Second Circuit's holding in Absolute Activist, 
however, any OTC transactions that fall outside those limitations will necessarily require an impermissible extraterritorial 
application of the CEA. To the extent that the SAC seeks to assert claims regarding OTC contracts where irrevocable liability to "
528,," carry out the transaction occurred or where title was transferred outside the United States, such claims must be, and are, 
dismissed. "
532,15," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' ""net 'short' position"" theory is insufficient to establish motive. Defs.' Joint Br. at 43-45. As 
discussed above, see supra Part III.B(1)(b), the Court agrees. Regardless, even if Plaintiffs are able to establish that Defendants 
held large net short positions during the Class Period and profited from holding those positions, such generalized motive 
allegations ""could be imputed to any corporation with a large market presence in any commodity market,"" and are insufficient to 
show intent."" In re Crude Oil Commodity, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47902, 2007 WL 1946553, at *8. "
533,16," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have not alleged ""any particular communications supposedly evidencing Defendants' 
manipulative intent,"" and instead rely on references to ""regulatory investigations into other entities that are not defendants here, 
into other financial benchmarks, and to articles describing alleged investigations into precious metals markets,"" all of which 
Defendants describe as an insufficient ""hearsay"" substitute for factual allegations. Defs.' Joint Br. at 45-46. In a footnote, 
Defendants invite the Court, if it is so ""inclined[,] to strike the offending allegations"" and ask the Court to treat their motion as a 
motion to strike pursuant Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f). Id. at 46 n.32. The Court is not so inclined. First, those 
allegations do not form the basis of the Court's conclusions in this case. Second, ""'motions to strike under Rule 12(f) are rarely 
successful.'"" Hidalgo v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc., 148 F. Supp. 3d 285, 292 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Unless 
there ""is a strong reason for doing so . . . courts should not tamper with the pleadings."" Restis v. Am. Coalition Against Nuclear 
Iran, Inc., 53 F. Supp. 3d 705, 731 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). HN37[
] ""'To prevail on a [Rule 12(f)] motion to strike, a party must demonstrate that (1) no evidence in support of the allegations would be admissible; (2) that the allegations have no bearing on 
the issues in the case; and (3) that to permit the allegations to stand would result in prejudice to the movant."" Landesbank 
Baden-Württemberg v. RBS Holdings USA, Inc., 14 F. Supp. 3d 488, 497 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (quoting In re Fannie Mae 2008 Sec. 
Litig., 891 F. Supp. 2d 458, 471 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (alteration in original). Defendants have not met this standard, let alone 
attempted to meet it in their footnote. "
540,17," Depending on the basis for personal jurisdiction, due process under either the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment applies. ""[T]he 
due process analysis is basically the same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The principal difference is that 
under the Fifth Amendment the court can consider the defendant's contacts throughout the United States, while under the 
Fourteenth Amendment only the contacts with the forum state may be considered."" Chew v. Dietrich, 143 F.3d 24, 28 n. 4 (2d 
Cir. 1998); see also Straub, 921 F. Supp. 2d at 253 (""[B]ecause the language of the Fifth Amendment's due process clause is 
identical to that of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, the same general principles guide the minimum contacts 
analysis.""). "
542,18," ""Because the service of process provision applies only to 'such cases' described in the preceding clause, the Second Circuit 
has concluded that nationwide service of process is permissible ""only in cases in which its venue provision is satisfied.'"" Sullivan 
v. Barclays, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25756, 2017 WL 685570, at *42 (quoting Daniel, 428 F.3d at 423). Neither party has 
addressed the relationship between the venue provision and the service of process provision, nor have the Foreign Defendants 
contested that venue is proper in this district."
542,19," Plaintiffs have not asserted any other subsections of C.P.L.R. § 302 as statutory bases for personal jurisdiction over the 
Foreign Defendants. "
544,20," Plaintiffs' assertion that the LPPFC ""is indistinguishable from the Fixing [Members] for jurisdictional purposes"" SAC ¶ 46, is a 
legal conclusion that the Court need not—and does not—accept as true. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. "
545,21," At least two courts in this district observed that the question whether the same standard that governs the alter ego analysis for 
liability purposes controls for jurisdictional purpose has not yet been addressed by the Second Circuit and that courts have taken 
a variety of approaches when confronted with this question. See, e.g., Int'l Equity Investments, Inc. v. Opportunity Equity 
Partners, Ltd., 475 F. Supp. 2d 456, 459 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (declining to decide whether ""the choice of law for alter ego analysis 
for personal jurisdiction purposes is different than for liability""); In re Lyondell Chem. Co., 543 B.R. 127, 139 n.38 (Bankr. 
S.D.N.Y. 2016) (""Some federal courts have engaged in a choice of law analysis to decide which law to apply to an alter ego 
theory of jurisdiction, usually finding that the law of the corporation's state of incorporation governs. Other courts have disagreed, 
distinguishing the analysis for 'alter ego' liability and for 'alter ego' jurisdiction, and finding that because 'alter ego' jurisdiction is 
either a construction of the statute providing jurisdiction or is part of due process (or both), for a jurisdictional veil piercing 
analysis, courts should apply either the law governing the interpretation of the jurisdictional statute or federal due process 
jurisprudence, or both."") (collecting cases) (citations omitted). "
546,22," The cases cited in this paragraph address the alter ego analysis under New York law, but ""Second Circuit's common law 
standard is taken directly from New York law."" Lakah v. UBS AG, 996 F. Supp. 2d 250, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). Accordingly, the 
standard is same. See Wajilam Exports (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. ATL Shipping Ltd., 475 F. Supp. 2d 275, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) 
(reasoning that federal common law and New York law of veil-piercing are not ""meaningfully distinct"")."
546,23," The Court recognizes that most district courts in this circuit—and the Second Circuit itself—point to Marine Midland as support 
for the proposition the alter ego standard applicable to personal jurisdiction questions is different from the standard applicable to 
liability questions. The Court disagrees with that reading of the case. In Marine Midland, the Second Circuit analyzed the 
fiduciary shield doctrine, under which ""it is unfair to force an individual to defend a suit brought against him personally in a forum 
with which his only relevant contacts are acts performed not for his own benefit but for the benefit of his employer."" 664 F.2d at 
902. The court held that, when determining whether it is fair to pierce the fiduciary shield, a ""less onerous standard"" applies, and 
""it is sufficient to inquire whether the corporation is a real or shell entity."" Id. at 903-904. The Court does not read Marine Midland 
as establishing a less onerous standard applicable in all cases involving an alter ego analysis in the personal jurisdiction context. 
However, because Plaintiffs' allegations do not show that the LPPFC was merely a shell of the Fixing Members, the Court need 
not determine the scope of Marine Midland here. "
548,24," Plaintiffs point to ""[a] variety of other facts,"" which they assert indicate that Defendants' scheme targeted the U.S.,"" and which 
they argue demonstrate that the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over the Foreign Defendants. Those factors include, 
inter alia, that ""[p]rices were 'fixed' at 2:00 p.m. London time each day to coordinate with the start of the U.S. trading day"" and 
that the Fix Prices were ""stated in U.S. dollars."" Pls.' JDX Opp'n at 1. As Defendants point out, however, ""[t]he U.S. dollar is the 
standard unit of currency in international commodities markets, including for the London and leading European markets that 
trade in platinum and palladium."" Def. LPPFC Reply to Pls.' Consol. Opp'n and in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(2) (""LPPFC JDX Reply""), Dkt. No. 131, at 3. In addition, Plaintiffs have not alleged that the Fixing was conducted in 
a different currency prior to the beginning of the Class Period, or that the Fixing Members changed the currency in order to 
facilitate the alleged price manipulation. As to the timing of the Fixing Calls, Plaintiffs do not allege that the Fixing Members 
changed the Fixing Calls' schedule to orchestrate their alleged scheme; in fact, as the LPPFC notes, Plaintiffs' assertion ""is 
contradicted by [their] more specific allegation that '[f]or various reasons, such as changing daylight savings times, the Fix 
occurred at different times during the New York trading day, and sometime did not occur at all.'"" LPPFC JDX Reply at 3 (quoting 
SAC ¶ 10 n.3)."
548,25," In addition to its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), ICBC also moves to dismiss the 
SAC against it for failure to state a claim. See ICBC JDX Br. at 11-12. Because the Court concludes that it does not have 
personal jurisdiction over ICBC, ICBC's Rule 12(b)(6) motion is denied as moot. "
550,26," Plaintiffs cite Loreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, 797 F.3d 160, 180 (2d Cir. 2015) and In re Foreign 
Exch. Benchmark Rates, 74 F. Supp. at 588-89, in support of their argument that the Court may rely on allegations concerning 
regulatory investigations as showing that UBS participated in the alleged manipulation of the platinum and palladium Fix Prices. 
See Pls.' UBS Opp'n at 7-8. Those cases are inapposite. For example, in In re Foreign Exch. Benchmark Rates, the court took 
""judicial notice of penalties and fines levied by regulators in three countries against six Defendants as a result of some of the 
investigations detailed in the U.S. Complaint and for the very conduct alleged in the Complaint."" 74 F. Supp. 3d at 592 
(emphasis added). On that basis, the court found that ""[t]he penalties provide[d] non-speculative support for the inference of a 
conspiracy."" Id. Plaintiffs' references to foreign and domestic investigations and settlements do not involve ""the very same 
conduct conducted alleged in the"" SAC. Plaintiffs' reliance on Anderson News is similarly unavailing. Pls.' UBS Opp'n at 9 (citing 
Anderson News, 680 F.3d at 184 (""The choice between . . . plausible inferences . . . is one for the factfinder."")). While Plaintiffs 
are correct that it is the factfinder's role to choose between plausible inferences, it nevertheless remains the Court's role to 
distinguish between plausible and conclusory allegations. "
554,1," For purposes of this decision, and consistent with Plaintiffs' allegations in the Amended Complaint, Interstate refers to both 
Interstate Management Company, LLC and Interstate Hotels & Resorts, Inc."
554,2," The Court takes as true the allegations in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint. See Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 91 (2d Cir. 
2000). The Court also considers the exhibits attached to the Amended Complaint and ""any statements or documents 
incorporated in it by reference,"" as well as ""documents that the plaintiffs either possessed or knew about and upon which they 
relied in bringing the suit"" and ""matters of which judicial notice may be taken."" See id. at 88; Kolchinsky v. Moody's Corp., 10 
Civ. 6840 (PAC), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25650, 2012 WL 639162, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2012). "
555,3," The Accretion and CCN Clauses of the 2000 Memorandum of Understanding were incorporated into the 2001 IWA as Article 
60 and Addendum IV. "
559,4," Defendants highlight that the Amended Complaint appears to merge the two purported services clusters into one purported 
services cluster. Interstate Br. at 16-18. The Court agrees that the Amended Complaint is unclear in defining the clusters, but 
conducts its market analysis as though Plaintiffs properly alleged two services clusters."
559,5," At the February 1, 2017 hearing, counsel for Plaintiffs conceded that hotel labor services ""are provided by hotel employees,"" 
but stated that the Hotel Workers Union ""is a facilitator or arranger"" for those services. Tr. 7:9-21. "
570,1," United acknowledges that to the extent it engaged in illegal antitrust conduct after the confirmation date of its plan of 
reorganization, any claim by DHL arising from that conduct is not discharged. Accordingly, the Court has construed the motion 
as one for partial summary judgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (recognizing that summary judgment is available to dismiss 
""part"" of a claim). "
571,2," DHL notes that not all of its affiliates received notice, but that is immaterial. There is no genuine dispute that the entities holding 
Disputed Claims received notice. Moreover, DHL had previously acknowledged at a hearing before Judge Gleeson that ""[t]here 
is clearly, we don't dispute, there is notice that they were bankrupt."""
571,3, DPWN acquired Exel plc in 2005. DPWN then merged DHL Logistics and Exel to create DHL Supply Chain. 
572,4," DHL's employees also had their own questions about the calculations behind the surcharges. In fact, DHL employees 
suspected that United's fuel surcharge was greater than its actual fuel costs. "
577,5," I recognize that DHL's claim was not contingent or unmatured. However, the point is that since a creditor is expected to assert 
claims that may never come into being because of contingencies, it is not too much to ask a creditor like DHL, which has 
knowledge of facts suggesting a presently actionable claim, to file a claim as well."
577,6," Because of the distinction between a claim in bankruptcy and a claim upon which relief can be granted, DHL's reliance on In re 
Copper Antitrust Litigation, 436 F.3d 782 (7th Cir. 2006), is misplaced. As a practical matter, In re Copper Antitrust was not a 
bankruptcy case. Thus, the Seventh Circuit's statement that ""it is not enough . . . to point to facts which might have caused a 
plaintiff to inquire, or could have led to evidence supporting his claim,"" 436 F.3d at 792, is not the standard in determining 
whether to allow a proof of claim. "
580,7," Moreover, even if I accepted DHL's position that it lacked inquiry notice before the Confirmation Date, the Bankruptcy Code 
provides for a motion to modify the confirmation plan if DHL had any late objections to it. See 11 U.S.C. § 1329; In re McBride, 
337 B.R. 451, 455 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 2006)."
580,8," Antitrust claims are considered tort claims. See Texas Indus., Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 634, 101 S. Ct. 
2061, 68 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1981). "
581,9," For this reason, DHL's reliance on Morton's Market, Inc. v. Gustafson's Dairy, Inc., 198 F.3d 823 (11th Cir. 1999), is misplaced 
— it is simply an example of one set of facts where the issue of reasonableness was not clear as a matter of law. Here, as 
explained, the issue is clear. Indeed, it is significant that the Morton's Market court, by way of contrast to its own facts, 
highlighted a situation where there are ""widely publicized earlier investigations of exactly the same antitrust violations,"" as an 
example of when investigations are ""held to constitute adequate notice to others of their possible claims."" Id. at 833. As the 
background facts demonstrate, a widely publicized investigation was exactly DHL's situation with respect to its antitrust claim."
581,10," Independence Airway's antitrust claim arose from a different set of alleged anticompetitive conduct than the conduct alleged 
by DHL. This distinction is of no moment; the important fact is that the bankruptcy court permitted Independence Airway's 
antitrust claim as an administrative expense. "
582,11," DHL relies on In re Motors Liquidation Co., 829 F.3d 135 (2d Cir. 2016), but that case discusses the notice obligations of a 
debtor without regard to the inquiry notice of a particular creditor, and thus fits easily within the Second Circuit's ranking of the 
issues in the instant case."
582,12," This Memorandum Decision and Order does not determine the length of time that encompasses DHL's surviving post-
Confirmation Date antitrust claim, as the parties have not adequately briefed it. The Court reserves decision on that issue 
pending further proceedings. "
584,1," Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without 
a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. Accordingly, the hearing set for April 3, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. is hereby vacated 
and off calendar."
584,2," The details of Polaris' allegations against Kingston have been summarized in previous Orders and are omitted here for brevity. 
(See Dkt. 84.) "
588,3," There is a line of Ninth Circuit precedent that holds, to the contrary, that all pretrial discovery is presumptively public. See San 
Jose Mercury News, 187 F.3d at 1103 (""It is well-established that the fruits of pretrial discovery are, in the absence of a court 
order to the contrary, presumptively public.""); In re Roman Catholic Archbishop of Portland in Oregon, 661 F.3d 417, 424 (9th 
Cir. 2011) (""As a general rule, the public is permitted 'access to litigation documents and information produced during 
discovery.'"") (quoting Phillips, 307 F.3d at 1210). Under that framework, the standard to overcome the presumption of public 
access to all pretrial discovery is the good cause standard delineated in Rule 26(c). See San Jose Mercury News, 187 F.3d at 
1103. However, given Supreme Court precedent, the fact that all three Ninth Circuit cases involve third-party intervenors, and 
the presence of additional Ninth Circuit precedents to the contrary, the Court believes these cases are not controlling. The Court 
is also guided by the fact that presuming public access to all pretrial discovery would undermine the inherent nature of discovery, 
wherein the parties coordinate compliance with their obligations without judicial awareness or micromanaging. The parties curate 
discovery in their court filings; courts often never see and are unaware of the universe of materials produced. Finally, applying 
such a presumption to privately-exchanged discovery results in a convoluted paradigm in which the uniform presumption can 
sometimes be overcome by good cause instead of the typical, higher compelling reasons standard without explicit justification 
for any such distinction. "
590,4," Perhaps due to the Supreme Court's diction in Nixon, some courts have granted significantly broader protection to businesses. 
See, e.g., Campbell v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, 642 F.3d 820, 822 n.1 (9th Cir. 2011) (noting litigant's desire to seal 
information that ""could reveal . . . confidential business strategies and other commercially sensitive information"" and stating in 
passing that, while mindful of the litigant's ""interest in protecting its proprietary business information,"" extensive swaths of 
documents were inappropriately filed under seal); Barnes v. Hershey Co., No. 3:12-CV-01334-CRB, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
52330, 2015 WL 1814293, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2015) (sealing ""account assignments and divisions, financial information 
regarding specific clients, and . . . organization structure""); Selling Source, LLC v. Red River Ventures, LLC, No. 2:09-CV-01491-
JCM, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49664, 2011 WL 1630338, at *6 (D. Nev. Apr. 29, 2011) (sealing ""a company's business model or 
agreements with clients""); Biovail Labs., Inc. v. Anchen Pharm., Inc., 463 F. Supp. 2d 1073, 1083 (C.D. Cal. 2006) (sealing 
""manufacturing information""); Apple Inc. v. Samsung Elecs. Co., 727 F.3d 1214, 1221 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (applying Ninth Circuit 
law and stating that if ""documents will cause competitive harm to a business"" that supports keeping them under seal). Such a 
capacious rule would place virtually all corporate records under seal, severely undermining access to justice, thwarting the 
foundational values of judicial accountability, due process, and public access to judicial proceedings, and granting businesses 
disproportionate, expansive protection. The Court refuses to countenance categorically sealing corporate records and thereby 
allow a narrow exception from Nixon to swallow the rule of public access. "

665,1," A detailed description of the facts and background of this case is set forth in the fact section of the court's summary judgment

667,2," ST also argues that ABS's failure to prove antitrust injury for its violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act ""mandates a judgment in 
favor of ST on that claim"" (Def.'s Opening Br. (dkt. #742) at 4), but as ABS points out in response, the jury's verdict is better 
interpreted as requiring judgment against ST under § 2 and against ABS for treble damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act. Cf. 
Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 569 U.S. 27, 133 S. Ct. 1426, 1438, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013) (HN4[

acquisition or maintenance of that power[,] as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior 
product, business acumen, or historic accident.' United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-571, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. 
Ed. 2d 778 (1966). A private plaintiff seeking damages must also show that (3) the monopolization caused 'injur[y].' 15 U.S.C. § 
15."") (alterations in original). "
670,3," ST also argues that the jury's ""anticompetitive conduct as a whole"" finding is unsupportable for the same reasons the court 
should reject the jury's specific anticompetitive contract findings. "
671,4," By virtue of the jury denying ABS any monetary damages for past acts, ST's challenge to an award of damages is moot."
671,5," ABS's proposed instruction merely explained, ""[i]f you do not find in ABS's favor on its antitrust claim, you must consider 
whether ABS has shown . . . that ST engaged in an act or practice that has substantially interfered with ABS's ability to compete "
672,," against ST on the merits,"" and provided a single example of a circumstance in which the only manufacturer of a given drug 
blocks its competitors by tying up manufacturing of a critical ingredient. (Proposed Jury Instrs. (dkt. #492) at 20-21.) "
674,6," ABS also notes that while Exhibit 518 identifies the analog filter and the min span function as features, it also states that min 
span is set at 0.01 microseconds, which is the same level to which Schilffarth testified before min span was changed to 0.1 
microseconds. (Pl.'s Reply Br. (dkt. #754) at 18-19.) "
675,7," The parties fault each other for the limited evidence as to how much ""noise,"" if any, is filtered by the digital processor. ST faults 
ABS for introducing its analog filter theory of non-infringement for the first time at trial (Def.'s Opp'n Br. (dkt. #752) at 29 n.6), 
while ABS claims that it introduced evidence about how the analog filter operates only after ST first presented its electronic spike 
infringement theory at Robinson's deposition, which was held on this subject on the weekend after the trial itself had already 
begun (Pl.'s Reply Br. (dkt. #756) at 18 n.4). The court permitted ST to take this late deposition because ABS was given leave to 
reassert its non-infringement defense with respect to claims 40-46 of the '092 patent after the court entered summary judgment 
of infringement based on ABS's earlier concession of infringement. In turn, this change in ABS's position was prompted by ST's 
late-proposed construction of ""detecting waveform pulses,"" which itself was triggered by ABS's late assertion of a newly-
identified prior art reference. (See 7/29/16 Op. & Order (dkt. #622).) As the court remarked in the opinion and order permitting 
ST to take the deposition, rather than parcel out fault at the time, counsel for both parties recognized that ""patent litigation 
frequently involves managing moving targets and contingent positions."" (Id. at 3-4.) The court is no more inclined to allocate fault 
now for the parties' late-developing arguments "
676,8," ST also contends that ABS's argument presents a ""practicing the prior art"" theory, which fails as a matter of law. Contrary to 
ST's assertion, ABS's contention that claim 13 of the '092 patent is invalid because the DiVa system does not process signals 
shorter than 0.1 microseconds in a similar way that the min span function of the GSS system rejects signals of the same length 
is not a classic ""practicing the prior art"" defense, but rather a clumsy argument for interpreting the distinguishing ""noise"" element 
of the ""detecting waveform pulses"" step consistently in both the infringement and invalidity contexts. See Amazon.com, Inc. v. 
Barnesandnoble.com, Inc., 239 F.3d 1343, 1351 (HN13[
] ""Because the claims of a patent measure the invention at issue, the 
claims must be interpreted and given the same meaning for purposes of both validity and infringement analyses.""). The basic 
reasoning that nullifies ""practicing the prior art"" arguments is nevertheless pertinent here. By focusing so heavily on ST's 
infringement arguments regarding the GSS system in its invalidity case, ABS failed to meet its higher burden of proving invalidity 
by clear and convincing evidence. See Zenith Elecs. Corp. v. PDI Commc'n Sys., Inc., 522 F.3d 1348, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2008)."
676,9," Obviously, therefore, ABS's argument that a new trial is required to resolve any inconsistencies in the jury's invalidity findings 
as to claims 1, 13 and 40 of the '092 Patent is rendered moot. "
677,10," ""The Federal Circuit reviews procedural matters that are not unique to patent issues under the law of the particular regional 
circuit court where appeals from the district court would normally lie."" DMI, Inc. v. Deere & Co., 802 F.2d 421, 428 (Fed. Cir. 
1986); see also Callaway Golf Co. v. Acushnet Co., 576 F.3d 1331, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (""We review inconsistent verdicts, an 
issue not unique to patent law, under regional circuit law."")."
677,11," ST did not seek a new damages trial for infringement of claim 13 of the '092 patent, moving only for the court to ""enter 
judgment as a matter of law of infringement in ST's favor."" (Def.'s Opening Br. (dkt. #742) at 31.) "
679,12," Even though Nolan admitted that the specifications of the '987 patent do not address which kill laser to use, how to avoid light 
leaking or how to turn the laser on or off, the failure of the '987 patent to address those issues alone does not render its claims 
obvious. As explained below, while the '987 patent's discussion of photodamage sorting is admittedly somewhat superficial, this 
is not a situation where the patent fails completely to explain how to implement the claimed invention, which would give rise to 
an enablement problem. See Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp., 532 F.3d 1318, 1327 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that a 
party's argument that a person of ordinary skill would not have been able to incorporate a web browser into existing electronic 
prior art systems ""might suggest that the claims present an enablement issue, rather than support a conclusion of 
nonobviousness"" because the patent was ""itself silent regarding how to actually implement the methods claimed therein with a 
web browser"")."
679,13, The court will grant ST's unopposed motion for leave to file supplemental authority (dkt. #758). 
682,14," ST argues that the jury could have inferred that ""ST protocols were in fact disclosed to ABS under Section 16 of the 
Agreement by direct transmission from the ST sorting lab to ABS personnel, rather than through an earlier 'taking' by Kathy 
Mean,"" based on testimony at trial from an ABS employee that she and other ABS ""technical personnel . . . routinely entered 
ST's laboratory, where ST's confidential protocols were kept, and interacted with ST's employees."" (Def.'s Opp'n Br. (dkt. #752) 
at 46-47 (citing 8/5/16 Trial Tr. (dkt. #719) at 32-35).) Even if the jury could have reached its verdict based on that evidence, 
however, the jury would have had to interpret the definition of ST's confidential information in Section 16 as encompassing a 
similarly broad scope that would cover the Kathy Mean scenario -- in other words, that the confidentiality provision precluded use 
and disclosure of ST's confidential information even if it was obtained by ABS through means other than an ST employee directly 
disclosing that information to an ABS employee. "
686,15," In Arcturus, the trial court lowered the amount of the liquidated damages to reflect a ""commercially reasonable sum"" under the 
circumstances. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49944, 2016 WL 4272381, at *5."
686,16," In full, Section 23 provides that: ""Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, by any 
court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified by such court in compliance with the law and, as modified, 
enforced. The remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the modified provision and as if 
such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had not been contained herein."" (Trial Ex. 82 at 11.) "
688,17," As already discussed, the jury also found in ST's favor on a number of ST's patent infringement claims and its claim that ABS 
materially breached the 2012 Agreement by using its confidential information. (Liability Special Verdict #2 (dkt. #697).) "
689,18," In addressing ST's arguments, the court will also grant its motion for leave to file, and will consider, ST's surreply. (Dkt. #746.) "
690,19," As a practical matter, this is a distinction without a difference, since the court does not find a competitive need for ABS to be 
freed from its contractual obligations until the end of its current contract."
690,20," Moreover, as discussed later in this opinion, ST's cancellation notice does not moot ABS's claim for injunctive relief because 
ST will not be permitted to unilaterally stop providing sexed semen processing services to ABS before the 2012 Agreement ends 
by its terms on August 31, 2017. "
692,21," ABS goes to great pains to emphasize that no court in the Seventh Circuit has formally applied the four-factor eBay test to 
date, but fails to explain how this is of any import in determining what, if any, permanent injunctive relief is appropriate under 
Section 16 of the Clayton Act. First, eBay is obviously controlling precedent for all lower courts. Second, eBay simply articulates 
the four, equitable factors that federal courts have always considered in determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief. 
Third, while suggesting that a showing of ""future antitrust injury"" suffices, ABS points to an older Supreme Court case stating 
only that a threat of future injury is enough to ""make the cause of action for relief by injunction,"" not that showing such a threat 
alone is enough for a plaintiff to obtain a permanent injunction. United States v. Or. State Med. Soc'y, 343 U.S. 326, 333, 72 S. 
Ct. 690, 96 L. Ed. 978 (1952) (emphasis added). Fourth, while plaintiff is correct that the Seventh Circuit did not address the 
third and fourth eBay factors in Marshfield Clinic, the Seventh Circuit had already affirmed the district court's decision to grant 
equitable relief, which it reached after applying the traditional factors, including the balance of hardships, in an earlier appeal in 
that case. See Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wis. v. Marshfield Clinic, 883 F. Supp. 1247, 1263 (W.D. Wis. 1995), aff'd in "
693,," part and rev'd in part, 65 F.3d 1406 (7th Cir. 1995). Thus, the court appropriately looks to traditional equitable factors in 
determining the appropriateness of injunctive relief. See, e.g., SEC v. Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., 752 F.3d 285, 296 (2d Cir. 
2014) (""eBay strongly indicates that the traditional principles of equity it employed are the presumptive standard for injunctions in 
any context"") (citations omitted); AlliedSignal, Inc. v. B.F. Goodrich Co., 183 F.3d 568, 573 (7th Cir. 1999) (balancing hardships 
to the parties and the public in issuing preliminary injunction related to a section 7 Clayton Act claim). If anything, this balancing 
under the eBay factors is even more appropriate considering the ""unique aspects"" of the interplay between patent and antitrust 
principles at issue here. Apple Inc. v. Motorola, Inc., 757 F.3d 1286, 1312 (Fed. Cir. 2014), overruled on other grounds by 
Williamson v. Citrix Online, LLC, 792 F.3d 1339, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2015); see also Avaya Inc. v. Telecom Labs, Inc., Civil Action 
No. 06-2490 (JEI/KMW), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88815, 2014 WL 2940455, at *6 (D.N.J. June 30, 2014) (""Rather, a more 
coherent interpretation of §16 and federal courts' equitable powers is that the 'threatened injury' requirement sets forth the 
preliminary showing necessary to authorize injunctive relief, while the four-factor [eBay] test directs a court's issuance of the 
injunction sought.""). "
695,22," For the same reason, ST's argument that ABS presented insufficient evidence at trial that other bull studs wish to terminate 
their contracts with ST early fails. See United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 110 F. Supp. 295, 349 (D. Mass. 1953), aff'd 
per curiam, 347 U.S. 521, 74 S. Ct. 699, 98 L. Ed. 910 (1954) (finding that injunctive relief modifying the monopolist's leases with 
other manufacturers was appropriate even though a substantial majority of manufacturers expressed a preference for leasing). 
The marketplace is best able to decide if this is so as well. "
698,1," In the interest of brevity, only one citation is provided when a fact appears more than once in the parties' cross statements. See 
Am. Safety Cas. Ins. Co. v. City of Waukegan, 776 F. Supp. 2d 670, 678 n.1 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (adopting same practice). Nucap 
and Bosch cite to tab numbers in paper copies of the exhibits attached to their motions for summary judgment. Nucap's exhibits 
to its Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Facts can be found at ECF No. 474 (Ex. 1); ECF No. 475 (Ex. 18, 23); ECF No. 476 (Ex. 29-
32, 34-35, 39); ECF No. 477 (Ex. 45, 47, 49-51); ECF No. 651 (Ex. 19-22, 24-28 filed under seal); ECF No. 652 (Ex. 33, 36-38 
filed under seal); ECF No. 653 (Ex. 40-44, 46, 48 filed under seal); and ECF No. 654 (Ex. 2-17 filed under seal). Nucap's exhibits 
to its Response to Bosch's Statement of Facts, filed under seal, can be found on the docket at ECF No. 468 (Ex. 1-22); ECF No. 
469 (Ex. 23-32); ECF No. 470 (Ex. 33-46). Bosch's exhibits to its Local Rule 56.1 Statement of Facts can be found at ECF No. 
343 (Ex. 13, 23-25, 35, 37) and ECF No. 347 (the remaining exhibits, numbers 1-36, filed under seal). Bosch's exhibits to its 
Response to Nucap's Statement of Facts, filed under seal, can be found on the docket at ECF No. 555 (Ex. 38-46)."
698,2," Bosch also objects that certain paragraphs of Nucap's Local Rule 56.1(b)(3) response designating additional facts 
mischaracterize the underlying evidence. (E.g., ECF No. 495 ¶¶ 27, 32.) While some of those objections amount to legal 
argument, the court addresses the disputes over the proper characterization of the evidence cited only to the extent the facts are 
material."
698,3," Nucap also lodges an objection that the evidence cited does not support one of Bosch's statements of fact. (See ECF No. 589 
¶ 39.) The court need not resolve this objection because the facts in question—which parts were reordered after May 17, 2011—
are not material in the summary judgment sense. "
699,4," Nucap's complaint alleges that Bosch GmbH is the indirect parent of ""Bosch Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and Bosch 
Automotive Products (Nanjing) Co., Ltd. (collectively with Bosch Trading (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., ""Bosch China""), and Bosch 
Sistemas de Frenos S. de R.L. de C.V. and Bosch S. de R.L. de C.V. (collectively with Bosch Sistemas de Frenos S. de R.L. de 
C.V., ""Bosch Mexico"")."" (ECF No. 239 ¶ 28.) "
700,5," Citations to paragraph numbers of ""Countercl."" refer to the sequence of paragraph numbers beginning on page 45 of Bosch's 
live answer. (ECF No. 328.) "
701,6," Nucap attempts to assert in its Local Rule 56.1 responses that Bosch's evidence of this fact is insufficient to support a finding 
on this fact. As explained in the text, infra, even if this dispute is genuine, it is not material as the summary judgment evidence 
establishes Nucap's awareness of the POTCs by no later than May 2011."
701,7," Bosch lists this fact as denied in its Local Rule 56.1 response, but it cites no contrary evidence. (See ECF No. 495 at 13.) It 
argues only that the POTCs required Nucap to allow it to access the database, i.e., the source of the authority by which access 
was obtained. (See id.) That is a legal argument. The court therefore deems this fact admitted. "
704,8," Nucap points to e-mail messages from Wilkes to Bill Murray (""Murray""), Bosch's Vice President, Global Operations, dated 
March 23 and 26, 2013, in which Wilkes stated that, ""This is what we are doing to preserve the supplier drawing."" (Bosch Resp. 
to Nucap Counter SOF ¶ 8, ECF No. 495 (quoting message).) Wilkes sent Khokhar a copy of that message. (Ex. 29 to Nucap 
Resp. to Bosch SOF at Nucap-0144556, ECF No. 468.) Nucap suggests that message could be understood as clothing Wilkes 
with apparent authority, but the message does not concern forming a confidentiality agreement. (See id.) Nor is Murray Bosch's 
legal department, and Wilkes had already advised Khokhar by March 2013 that he could not form a binding agreement without 
approval from Bosch's legal department. (See Wilkes Decl. Ex. 2 at Nucap-0146692, ECF No. 347-4.) See Opp v. Wheaton Van 
Lines, Inc., 231 F.3d 1060, 1065 (7th Cir. 2000) (holding that reasonable fact finder could conclude that agent had no apparent 
authority to sign bill of lading limiting principal's liability, in part, because principal previously told mover that she wanted to insure 
her property for its full value); Anetsberger v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 14 F.3d 1226, 1235 (7th Cir. 1994) (holding agent lacked 
apparent authority to waive terms of agreement because principal spelled out who could waive terms in the agreement itself and 
principal did not later acquiesce in agent's unauthorized alteration of terms). "
708,9," The official English text of the CISG can also be found at U.S. Ratification of 1980 United Nations Convention on Contracts for 
the International Sale of Goods: Official English Text, 52 Fed. Reg. 6262, 6263 (52 FR 6262-02, 1987 WL 128849. "
709,10, The court assumes but does not decide that the language of § 32.3 is broad enough to opt the instant dispute out of the CISG.
709,11," This does not mean that no opt-out on formation issues is possible under Article 6 of the CISG. At least one nation has opted 
out. See Mitchell Aircraft Spares, Inc. v. European Aircraft Service AB, 23 F. Supp. 2d 915, 918 (N.D. Ill. 1998) (finding Illinois 
law governed formation issues ""because Sweden declared in its instrument of ratification that it would not be bound by Part II""). "
711,12," Nucap and Bosch discuss the CISG Advisory Council Opinion 13, Rule 7, which provides that a standard term that is ""so 
surprising or unusual"" that a reasonable person could not have expected such a term, will not become part of an agreement."" 
(Bosch's Reply Mot. Summ. J., Ex. A, ECF No. 493-1.) As the court sees it, Rule 7 sensibly expresses one way to determine 
what one party to a contract knew or was deemed to know about the other party's subjective intent under Article 8, but when the 
parties mutually intended to assent to a term that would surprise a reasonable person, their intentions still control. "
714,13," Bosch does not propose to define the market in terms of the breadth of the suppliers' catalogs of shims or backing plates. (See 
Countercl. ¶¶ 92-93.) In any event, Bosch's allegations that it and many other aftermarket manufacturers required a single 
supplier with a ""full catalog"" of shims sheds no light on the cross-elasticity of demand for shims and plates between OEM and 
aftermarket brake pad manufacturers. See id. ¶ 97; see also House of Brides, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1850, 2014 WL 64657, at 
*6 (explaining that preferences, like a preference for ""full catalog"" suppliers, do not plausibly allege a market in the consumer 
preference). "
718,1," Former Defendant Highmark, Inc. was dismissed from this action on June 9, 2016, following its settlement of all claims with 
LifeWatch. See ECF Nos. 96, 98. LifeWatch has not sued any other administrators in this case, but it notes that ""[u]nsued co-
conspirators include other Blue Plans."" TAC ¶ 18. "
719,2," LifeWatch cites numerous published studies supporting its claims that ""there is reliable evidence that telemetry is superior to 
event monitoring technology and that telemetry provides more effective detection of infrequent cardiac arrhythmias than other 
monitoring devices."" Id. ¶ 36 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. ¶¶ 35, 37-41, 45 (summarizing specific scientific 
reports on telemetry). LifeWatch also cites a 2010 American Heart Association literature review of available outpatient cardiac-
monitoring devices, including a decision tree for physicians showing that ""telemetry is the only choice for one palpitation situation 
and one syncope situation and is a preferred choice for two other situations."" Id. ¶ 42; see also id. ¶ 43 (further explaining the 
recommendations in the 2010 American Heart Association literature review)."
719,3," In the interim period, the case was transferred into and then back out of a multidistrict litigation (""MDL""). On November 9, 2012, 
Defendant Blue Cross notified the Court that it had filed a Notice of Related Action tagging this action as related to certain cases 
pending transfer to create an MDL styled as In re Blue Cross & Blue Shield Antitrust Litig., MDL-2406. ECF No. 32. 
Subsequently, on December 13, 2012, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (the ""Panel"") issued a conditional order 
transferring this case to an MDL in the Northern District of Alabama. See ECF No. 34 at 2. As a result, on December 20, 2012, 
the Court approved a stipulation for temporary stay of proceedings in this case. Id. On February 13, 2013, the Court approved 
and signed a second stipulation by the parties to continue the temporary stay. ECF No. 43. LifeWatch initially opposed transfer and moved to vacate the conditional transfer order, arguing that this action differs from the 
other centralized actions in that it focuses on an alleged conspiracy to deny insurance coverage for certain life-saving medical 
technologies, whereas the conspiracy alleged in the MDL proceedings dealt with the allegedly improper allocation of insurance 
markets. See ECF No. 46. The Panel was not persuaded by this argument and found instead that this case would benefit from 
the framework provided by the centralized proceedings for discovery and motion practice. See id. Accordingly, the Panel issued "
720,," a transfer order on April 1, 2013. See id. ECF No. 46. On July 7, 2015, pursuant to the advisement of the transferee court, the 
Panel issued a conditional remand order, thereby sending the case back to this Court. ECF No. 47. The case was formally 
reopened that same day."
720,4," On February 17, 2016, the Court denied as moot both the motion to dismiss and motion for leave to file a reply brief. ECF No. 
88."
720,5," After being granted an extension, Defendants timely filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint on May 31, 2016. 
ECF No. 95. On June 30, 2016, LifeWatch filed a response in opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss. ECF No. 100."
720,6," Particularly within the antitrust context, the Third Circuit has interpreted Twombly as teaching that ""allegations of conspiracy are 
deficient if there are 'obvious alternative explanation[s]' for the facts alleged."" In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 
322-23 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567). Nevertheless, ""it is inappropriate to apply Twombly's plausibility 
standard with extra bite in antitrust and other complex cases."" West Penn Allegheny Health Sys., Inc. v. UPMC, 627 F.3d 85, 98 
(3d Cir. 2010). "
721,7," This is not to be confused with a finding that LifeWatch has suffered no antitrust injury, which is ""an issue that only comes into 
play as and when it appears that all the elements of liability have been adequately alleged"": If a plaintiff tries to make an antitrust case by alleging that the defendant spat in the street, it would be ridiculous for the 
court to respond, ""Now I know that spitting in the street is not an antitrust violation. But suppose it were. What would be the 
anticompetitive effect of spitting in the street, and has this plaintiff demonstrated any such effect?"" To try to answer a 
question in that form is to undertake a fool's errand. Ronald W. Davis, Standing on Shaky Ground: The Strangely Elusive Doctrine of Antitrust Injury, 70 Antitrust L.J. 697, 732 
(2003). The Court doubts that LifeWatch can establish antitrust standing. The Court need not fully flesh out this analysis or 
actually decide this question, however, because it finds that LifeWatch has failed to adequately plead an antitrust violation in the 
first place. "
723,8," In their reply, Defendants distinguish both West Penn and McCready on the basis that those cases involved alleged 
conspiracies with the respective plaintiffs' competitors, whereas here, ""LifeWatch does not allege that Defendants conspired with 
a LifeWatch competitor to reduce competition among telemetry providers,"" and ""Defendants did not conspire with LifeWatch 
competitors to boycott LifeWatch."" Reply Mem. at 6-7, ECF No. 102-1. The Court agrees with Defendants' observation, but 
cautions that ""[t]he availability of [an antitrust] remedy to some person who claims its benefit is not a question of the specific 
intent of the conspirators"" and ""cannot reasonably be restricted to those competitors whom the conspirators hoped to eliminate 
from the market."" McCready, 457 U.S. at 479; see also Ronald W. Davis, Standing on Shaky Ground, 70 Antitrust L.J. at 761 
(opining that the Third Circuit has been ""misled"" by Supreme Court precedent into promoting ""a flat rule limiting antitrust injury 
only to customers or competitors"")."
723,9, LifeWatch does not allege that all Blue Plans have participated in the alleged conspiracy. See infra n.12.
723,10," This is not exactly a failure to show antitrust injury or antitrust standing, but instead a failure to plead a necessary component 
of substantive liability under the Sherman Act: HN4[
] When a court concludes that no violation has occurred, it has no occasion to consider standing [**18]  . . . . An 
increasing number of courts, unfortunately, deny standing when they really mean that no violation has occurred. In 
particular, the antitrust injury element of standing demands that the plaintiff's alleged injury result from the threat to 
competition that underlies the alleged violation. A court seeing no threat to competition in a rule-of-reason case may then 
deny that the plaintiff has suffered antitrust injury and dismiss the suit for lack of standing. Such a ruling would be 
erroneous, for the absence of any threat to competition means that no violation has occurred and that even suit by the 
government--which enjoys automatic standing--must be dismissed. Levine v. Cent. Florida Med. Affiliates, Inc., 72 F.3d 1538, 1545 (11th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 820, 117 S. Ct. 75, 136 
L. Ed. 2d 34 (1996) (quoting 2 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 360f, at 202-03 (rev. ed. 1995)). "
724,11," Though LifeWatch briefly mentions (for the first time in its opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss) that the purported 
""anticompetitive end"" of the Uniformity Rule is ""colluding to deny coverage to subscribers,"" Opp. at 12-13, LifeWatch does not 
describe how this ""collusion"" constitutes ""conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself,"" Spectrum Sports, 506 U.S. 
at 458. It is unclear what competition the Blue Plans theoretically could seek to unfairly destroy via the Uniformity Rule: 
Competition amongst telemetry providers to sell devices to insurance plans? No, because LifeWatch does not allege that the 
Blue Plans treat various telemetry providers differently. Competition amongst insurance plans to purchase telemetry devices, or 
to enroll subscribers? No, because LifeWatch alleges that ""the Blue Plans operate as if they were a single insurance company.""

Blue Plans not named as defendants in this lawsuit. TAC ¶¶ 46, 82."

] ""Monopsony power is market power on the buy side of the market."" Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., 549 U.S. 312, 320, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2007) (citing Roger D. Blair & Jeffrey L. Harrison, Antitrust 
Policy and Monopsony, 76 Cornell L. Rev. 297 (1991))."
724,14," It is not uncommon for anticompetitive effects to result from the exercise of monopsony or oligopsony power. See, e.g., 
Warren S. Grimes, The Sherman Act's Unintended Bias Against Lilliputians, 69 Antitrust L.J. 195, 210 (2001) (""The very nature 
of monopsony or oligopsony power is that it tends to suppress output and reduce quality or choice.""); Maurice E. Stucke, 
Looking at the Monopsony in the Mirror, 62 Emory L.J. 1509, 1510 (2013) (""The monopsonist can also reduce the quality of 
products it purchases and the amount of innovation that an otherwise competitive market would foster.""). "
725,15," The Court declines to grant leave to amend on the basis that ""amendment would be futile."" Lake v. Arnold, 232 F.3d 360, 373 
(3d Cir. 2000). Over the past five years, LifeWatch has amended its complaint three separate times--yet it still has not alleged 
any colorable antitrust violation and would not be able to do so even if the Court granted leave to amend yet again."
725,1," The Court considered the contents of Plaintiff's Proposed Amended Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss 
(ECF No. 101-1), Defendants' Proposed Reply (ECF No. 102-1), Defendants' Proposed Notice of Supplemental Authority (ECF 
No. 108-1), and Plaintiff's Proposed Notice of Supplemental Authority (ECF No. 109-1) in deciding Defendants' Motion to 
Dismiss the Third Amended Complaint (ECF No. 95). "
729,1," OrthoAccel's argument that Propel's pleading overlooked interchangeable substitute products—such as orthodontic surgery 
and salt water rinses—is unavailing. The law does not require Propel to plead an infinite range of possible substitutes and there 
is no evidence before the Court to suggest that surgery or salt water is a substitute product to an accelerated vibratory 
orthodontic device. See Du Pont, 351 U.S. at 394. "
730,2," The Court reserves its judgment as to whether the AcceleDent NOW Program is truly an exclusive-dealing arrangement. 
Discovery may or may not reveal that the AcceleDent NOW Program is a de facto exclusionary contract. See ZF Meritor, 696 
F.3d at 282. The Court did not consider the AcceleDent NOW contract attached to the partial motion to dismiss because the 
parties contest whether it is a complete copy or actually executed version. "
733,1," At oral argument, the City agreed to postpone enforcement of and/or penalties for violation of the disclosure requirement until 
the Court rules on the Chamber's pending motion. "
734,2," One of the cases on which the Chamber relies, Nat'l Constructors Ass'n v. Nat'l Elec. Contractors Ass'n, 498 F. Supp. 510 (D. 
Md. 1980), recognized that this rule was supported by ""long-standing authority,"" but concluded that a broader, more flexible 
standing requirement should be applied. Id. at 518-19. The case was decided before the Supreme Court reiterated in Cargill that 
a private plaintiff may exercise the remedy provided in § 16 only on a showing of ""threatened loss or damage"" that is personal to 
the plaintiff. "
736,3," In their reply memorandum, the Clark plaintiffs take the position that a violation of § 8(e) will arise as soon as the Teamsters 
are certified as the exclusive bargaining representative. Section 8(e) precludes a labor organization and an employer from 
entering into a certain type of agreement. The terms of the contract, not the designation as a bargaining representative, is the 
key to a § 8(e) violation. "
737,4," The Clark plaintiffs suggest that, because the Teamsters represent NLRA-covered employees in other contexts, it qualifies as a 
""labor organization"" in all contexts. Clark v. City of Seattle, C17-0382RSL (Dkt. # 34 at 6). The case cited in support of this 
proposition says nothing of the sort, however."
737,5," In their reply, the Clark plaintiffs conflate union representation with union membership. Section 8(b)(4) precludes a labor 
organization from requiring a self-employed person to join the organization: it does not preclude universal representation of 
members and non-members in a work group. "
738,6," The Chamber also argues that the Ordinance conflicts with Congress' choice to leave the actual negotiations and adoption of 
working conditions to the parties, without government interference. If, however, the NLRA does not apply because for-hire 
drivers are independent contractors, the right to bargain collectively and the procedures through which that right is exercised will 
be determined by state law, as is the case with public employees and agricultural workers. The Clark plaintiffs assert that ""the NLRA preempts the Ordinance under Machinists to the extent that it facilitates and/or 
regulates union tactics permitted by Sections 8(e) and 8(b)(4)."" Clark v. City of Seattle, C17-0382RSL (Dkt. # 13 at 23). As is the 
case for the Chambers' alternative argument, if the NLRA does not apply because for-hire drivers are not employees, state law 
would provide the parameters for representation and collective bargaining. "
744,1," The Court expresses no opinion about the viability of the plaintiffs' state-law antitrust claims. The Court only notes that the 
plaintiffs' allegations regarding interstate commerce do not give rise to a federal claim for purposes of the remand analysis in this 
case."
744,2," Furthermore, even if the Court were to find that the plaintiffs' second amended complaint asserts claims under the Sherman 
Act, the Court would not exercise jurisdiction over those claims because the Court dismissed those claims with prejudice on July 
29, 2016. (Doc. 27, Case No. 2:15-cv-00951-MHH). Instead, the Court would strike the federal claims from the second amended 
complaint and remand the action to state court. "
748,1," Plaintiff urges the Court to deny Defendant's Motion because Defendant failed to comply with Central District Local Rule 7-3. 
(See Opp'n at 11-12.) Local Rule 7-3 requires that, at least seven days prior to the filing of any motion, the parties ""first contact 
opposing counsel to discuss thoroughly, preferably in person, the substance of the contemplated motion and any potential 
resolution."" C.D. Cal. L.R. 7-3. According to Plaintiff, Defendant failed to timely meet and confer as required by Local Rule 7-3, 
instead waiting until two days before filing the instant Motion to inform Plaintiff of its intention to file it. (See Opp'n at 11.) 
Although the Court does not condone Defendant's behavior, the Court finds that it would be inappropriate to decide Defendant's 
Motion on this procedural ground. The Court admonishes Defendant to comply with this Court's Local Rules and Standing Order 
and warns Defendant that failure to do so in the future may result in the imposition of sanctions. "
750,2," In its Motion, Defendant does not address whether the failure to buy licenses constitutes a viable antitrust injury; rather, it 
addresses only the timing of any alleged injury and whether any injury had accrued before Plaintiff filed the instant action. 
Accordingly, the Court assumes for the purposes of this Motion that the failure to buy licenses constitutes a viable antitrust 
injury. "
751,3," The parties dispute whether it is appropriate for Defendant to reference an interim license agreement between the parties, as 
they had mutually agreed that neither party was to use the negotiation for or existence of the interim license in any way during 
this litigation. (See Mot. at 4-5 n.4; Opp'n at 16.) However, because the Court finds that Plaintiff is claiming past injury due to 
Defendant's member stations' alleged failure to negotiate for licenses, the existence of this interim license agreement has no 
effect on the Court's decision. Therefore, the Court need not determine whether Defendant's reference to it is appropriate at this 
stage. "
752,4," Defendant suggests that Plaintiff's claims here are compulsory counterclaims that must be brought in the Pennsylvania action. 
(See Mot. at 23.) Plaintiff argues that its claims are not compulsory counterclaims because they do not arise out of the same 
""transaction or occurrence."" (See Opp'n at 21-23.) Indeed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13 requires that any defendant who 
has a claim arising out of the same ""transaction or occurrence"" must bring its claim as a compulsory counterclaim. See Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 13(a). The Court need not determine whether Plaintiff's claims are compulsory counterclaims, however, because the first-
to-file rule examines only whether the two suits address substantially similar issues—not whether they arise from the same 
transaction or occurrence. See Wallerstein, 967 F. Supp. 2d at 1296. "
761,1," The cases, listed in the order in which they were filed, are: (1) Blue Gentian, LLC and National Express, Inc. v. Tristar Prods., 
Inc. and Wal-Mart Store, Inc., 1:13-cv-1758-NLH-AMD (hereinafter ""Blue Gentian""); (2) Tristar Prods., Inc. and Ragner Tech. 
Corp. v. Nat'l Express, Inc., DAP Prods., Inc. and E. Mishan and Sons, Inc., 2:13-cv-7752-ES-MAH (hereinafter ""Tristar""); (3) 
Ragner Tech. Corp. and Tristar Prods., Inc. v. Michael Berardi (member of Blue Gentian, LLC), Cheryl Berardi (member of Blue 
Gentian, LLC), and Nat'l Express, Inc., 1:15-cv-7752-NLH-AMD (hereinafter ""Ragner I""); (4) Telebrands Corp. v. Ragner Tech. 
Corp. and Tristar Prods., Inc., 2:15-cv-3163-ES-MAH (hereinafter ""Telebarands I""); (5) Ragner Tech. Corp. and Tristar Prods., 
Inc. v. Telebrands Corp., 2:15-cv-8185-ES-MAH (hereinafter ""Ragner II""); (6) Telebrands Corp. v. Ragner Tech. Corp. and 
Tristar Prods., Inc., 2:16-cv-3474-ES-MAH (hereinafter ""Telebrands II""); and (7) Telebrands Corp. v. Ragner Tech. Corp. and 
Tristar Prods., Inc., 2:16-cv-3594-ES-SCM (hereinafter ""Telebrands III""). "
762,2," See L. Civ. R. 40.1(c)(""When a civil action: (1) relates to any property included in a case already pending in this Court; (2) 
grows out of the same transaction as any case already pending in this Court; or (3) involves the validity or infringement of any 
patent, copyright or trademark which is involved in a case already pending in this Court, counsel shall at the time of filing the 
action inform the Clerk of such fact. Whenever possible, such action shall be assigned to the same Judge to whom the pending 
related action is assigned."")."
762,3," Tristar's papers request consolidation with only three of the five cases pending before Judge Salas. However, during oral 
argument, counsel for Tristar orally modified the motion to include Telebrands III. Similarly, Tristar's proposed order states that Tristar seeks ""consolidat[ion] in this District under Civil Action No. 2:13-cv-07752-
ES-MAH [Telebrands] for discovery and pretrial purposes."" (Docket 13-1758, Entry #237-13) At oral argument, counsel for 
Tristar clarified that Tristar seeks consolidation of the cases regardless of which case becomes the lead case-- i.e., regardless of 
whether the cases are consolidated in Camden or Newark."
762,4," Indeed, after Ragner I was transferred to New Jersey, the Berardi Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal 
jurisdiction. "
763,5," Tristar asserts that the '076 patent is ""pivotal"" to the entire ""constellation"" of cases."
763,6," The Motion to Transfer Ragner I was granted. Later, Magistrate Judge Hammer granted consolidation of Tristar, Telebrands I, 
and Ragner II over Tristar's objection that Tristar should not be included in the consolidation."
763,7," The Court does not imply that Blue Gentian and Ragner I were omitted in bad faith. To the contrary, the Court has no basis to 
conclude that any counsel appearing in any of the seven cases deliberately intended to mislead this Court, or any other Court, at 
any time. The Court recognizes that each of these cases are complex in their own right, and that intervening events-- such as the issuance 
of the '076 patent in May, 2015, the reexamination of that patent at the USPTO, and subsequent appeal to the PTAB (which is 
still pending), in addition to transfers between Courts and reassignments within this District-- further complicate the situation. 
Indeed, it is precisely such complexity that supports the Court's conclusion that consolidation is inappropriate. "
764,8," Even the Third Amended Complaint, which was filed in April, 2016, includes the following certification, ""[Tristar and Ragner], by 
their undersigned counsel, hereby certify pursuant to Local Civil Rule 11.2 that the matters in controversy are not the subject of 
any other action pending in any other court or of any other pending arbitration or administrative proceeding."" (Docket 13-7752, 
Entry #122-2, p. 22 of 147) "
765,9," To date, Blue Gentian's docket has over 245 entries; Tristar's docket has over 145 entries."
765,10," Thus the Court disagrees with Tristar and Ragner's assertion that the reasoning of Judge Hammer's consolidation opinion in 
the Tristar action supports further consolidation of Blue Gentian and Ragner I. Simply put, there is less overlap and more "
766,," differences between Blue Gentian and Ragner I on one hand, and the four other actions on the other, than there is among the 
individual suits within the consolidated Tristar action. "
801,1," Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without 
a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. Accordingly, the hearing set for April 17, 2017, at 1:30 p.m. is hereby 
vacated and off calendar. "
803,2," Since Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of the first element of trade dress infringement, 
the Court need not consider the remaining two elements of this cause of action. "
808,1," ""Architectural paint"" is defined as ""interior and exterior architectural coatings, sold in containers of five gallons or less for 
commercial or homeowner use, but does not include aerosol spray paint or coatings purchased for industrial or original 
equipment manufacturer use."" Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 48701(a). "
811,2," ""The analysis under [the Cartwright Act] mirrors the analysis under federal law because [it] was modeled after the Sherman 
Act."" Cty. of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); Name.Space, Inc. v. 
Internet Corp. for Assigned Names & Numbers, 795 F.3d 1124, 1131 n.5 (9th Cir. 2015) (""Because analysis under the Cartwright 
Act is identical to that under the Sherman Act, we also affirm the district court's dismissal of the Cartwright Act claim."" (citations 
omitted)). "
812,3," PaintCare and Clean Harbors dispute this allegation. See PaintCare Mot. at 3; Clean Harbors Mot. at 7. On a motion to 
dismiss, resolution of such disputes of fact is inappropriate."
812,4," The precise antitrust theory impacts whether the alleged conspiracy is properly considered as a vertical or horizontal restraint 
of trade and whether to apply a per se illegality analysis or ""rule of reason"" analysis. The Court need not decide now whether per 
se or rule of reason analysis applies; ""that decision is more appropriate on a motion for summary judgment."" In re High-Tech 
Emp. Antitrust Litig., 856 F. Supp. 2d at 1122 (citing cases). "
813,5," These allegations counter PaintCare's arguments that (1) Plaintiff has not shown how its presence in the market would 
increase the amount of paint available (PaintCare Mot. at 14); (2) Plaintiff ""does not allege any facts to support its speculation 
that without Plaintiff's particular Oakland recycling plant, there would be less recycled paint available to consumers in the Bay 
Area to compete with virgin paint"" (PaintCare Reply at 2); and (3) ""Plaintiff pleads no facts suggesting that the location of a 
recycler has any relationship to the availability of recycled paint in that same geographic area"" (PaintCare Mot. at 9 (emphasis 
omitted)). "
818,6," To the extent PaintCare relies on CalRecycle's approval of its plans as proof that it sought to fulfill the Program's goal, the 
Court declines to consider such evidence at the motion to dismiss stage. "
819,7," The August 10, 2010 amendment of AB 1343 stated: (a) Except as provided in subdivision (c), an action solely to increase the recycling of architectural paint by a producer, 
stewardship organization, or retailer that affects the types or quantities being recycled, or the cost and structure of any 
return program, is not a violation of the statutes specified in subdivision (b). "
820,," (b) The following statutes are not violated by an action specified in subdivision (a): (1) The Cartwright Act (Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 16700) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and Professions 
Code). (2) The Unfair Practices Act (Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 17000) of Part 2 of Division 7 of the Business and 
Professions Code). (c) Subdivision (a) shall not apply to any agreement establishing or affecting the price of paint, except for the architectural 
paint stewardship assessment, or the output or production of paint, or any agreement restricting the geographic area or 
customers to which paint will be sold. Dkt. No. 51-2 at ECF p.39. "
821,8," PaintCare and Plaintiff filed requests for judicial notice. See PaintCare RJN, Dkt. No. 53; Pl. RJN, Dkt. No. 58. Because the 
Court does not rely on the documents sought to be judicially noticed, the Court DENIES both requests AS MOOT. See 
McLaughlin v. Wells Fargo Bank, NA, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177945, 2015 WL 10889993, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 29, 2015). "
823,1," This motion was also brought by Francis H. Scola, III, at the time it was filed, but the Court has since dismissed all claims 
against Scola on motion of the parties [ECF No. 338]. Also since filing, defaults were entered against Alianza Financial and 
Alianza Holdings [ECF No. 366], after they failed to retain counsel following the withdrawal of their prior counsel. Because these 
Defendants were represented by counsel at the time this motion was filed, however, the Court will consider them nondefaulted 
parties for purposes of this Order. Defaults were entered earlier in the litigation against Defendants Crystal Tower Partners II, LLC, and Crystal Tower on Brickell 
Plaza, LLC [ECF No. 51], both of which never made an appearance. "
824,2," JAWHBS alleges that Botero and/or Delaney acted at all relevant times as the owners, principals, agents, or alter egos of the 
Alianza and Crystal Tower entities, which themselves were merely partners, joint ventures, agents, or alter egos of each other. 
Third Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17-18."
824,3," JAWHBS alleges that Arevalo acted at all relevant times as the owner, principal, agent, or alter ego of JA Energy, and that 
Cowan acted at all relevant times as the owner, principal, partner, agent or alter ego of Shutts & Bowen. Id. ¶¶ 5, 8. "
825,4," JAWHBS alleges that Cronig acted at all relevant times as the owner, principal, agent, or alter ego of Watson Brickell. Id. ¶ 22. "
827,5, The Court notes that Shutts & Bowen and Cowan did not join in this argument. Joint Mot. at 8 n.7.
827,6, JAWHBS brings a claim under this section. See Third Am. Compl. ¶ 86; see also id. ¶ 80. 
828,7," In this case, the ""relevant market"" would be the group of bidders vying to purchase the Brickell Parcels. "
830,8," In their separate motion to dismiss, Shutts & Bowen and Cowan argue that JAWHBS cannot allege that they violated the 
antitrust laws because, they contend, attorneys are exempt from antitrust liability for performing legal work on a client's behalf. 
""[A]n attorney may be found individually liable under the antitrust laws only if he exceeds his role as legal adviser and becomes 
an active participant in formulating policy decisions with his client to restrain competition."" Brown v. Donco Enters., Inc., 783 F.2d 
644, 646 (6th Cir. 1986); see also Tillamook Cheese & Dairy Ass'n v. Tillamook County Creamery Ass'n, 358 F.2d 115, 118 (9th 
Cir. 1966). Therefore, to state a claim against an attorney for individual liability under antitrust law, a plaintiff must allege ""that 
the defendant attorney exerted his power and influence so as to direct [his client] to engage in the complained of acts for an 
anticompetitive purpose."" Brown, 783 F.2d at 646-47. While JAWHBS's allegations as to Cowan's participation in the alleged 
bidrigging scheme are not voluminous, the Court finds they are sufficient. JAWHBS alleges that Cowan participated in the 
negotiations, along with Arevalo, Botero, and Delaney, regarding the Botero Group's payment to the Arevalo Group in exchange 
for the Arevalo Group's forbearance from entering a bid. And it alleges that Cowan indicated the Arevalo Group's intent to 
expose its presence as a competing bidder to the Trustees and/or the Bankruptcy Court if the Botero Group did not agree to the 
scheme. Accepting these allegations as true, the Court finds it is plausible that Cowan (and thereby Shutts & Bowen) exceeded 
the role of legal adviser and became an active participant in the scheme, sufficient to support a claim for violation of the antitrust 
laws and thereby satisfy the first element of the FDUTPA analysis. "
831,9, The Court need not address the Defendants' argument that this claim is time barred. 
832,10," The Court comes to the same conclusion if JAWHBS's civil conspiracy claim is framed as a civil aiding and abetting claim. To 
support such a claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) the party whom the defendant aids must perform a wrongful act that causes an injury; (2) the defendant must be 
generally aware of his role as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity at the time he provides the assistance; (3) the 
defendant must [*31]  knowingly and substantially assist the principal violation. Julin v. Chiquita Brands Int'l, Inc. (In re Chiquita Brands Int'l, Inc.), 690 F. Supp. 2d 1296, 1310 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (quoting 
Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 477, 227 U.S. App. D.C. 167 (D.C. Cir. 1983), cited with approval in Cent. Bank of Denver, 
N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., 511 U.S. 164, 181, 114 S. Ct. 1439, 128 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1994)); see also 
Schneberger v. Wheeler, 859 F.2d 1477, 1480 (11th Cir. 1988) (holding that knowledge of the violation and of one's own role in 
the violation are required to satisfy the test for aiding and abetting). The elements of a civil aiding and abetting claim, by their 
own terms, presuppose the existence of a violation. The corollary to that premise, then, is that without a violation there can be no 
aiding and abetting liability. Thus, there can be no aiding and abetting liability here for any claim other than the claim for violation 
of FDUTPA, and the Court finds that JAWHBS has set forth allegations to support this claim on those grounds sufficient to 
withstand a motion to dismiss. "
840,*," Honorable D. Brooks Smith, United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, assumed Chief Judge status on October 1, 2016."
840,**," Honorable D. Michael Fisher, United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, assumed senior status on February 1, 2017. "
857,*," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
858,1," ""Circle trips"" begin and end at the same point, but involve multiple stopovers. "
859,2," ""Double open jaw"" trips are those in which the origin and destination of the first flight are different from the origin and 
destination of the second, such that instead of traveling outbound from A to B and back from B to A, the customer travels 
outbound from A to B, but, then, on the second trip, from C to D."
859,3," Although the order is arguably susceptible to different readings, Plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument that the district court's 
order did not implicitly or explicitly grant summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor as to the unfiled fares, fuel surcharges, and 
discount fares. We treat the order as merely denying summary judgment in Defendants' favor as to these rates. "
863,4," Some airlines privately filed fuel surcharges, but entered them into the database incorrectly such that they were not flagged to 
be presented to the DOT and thus were not considered ""filed"" within the meaning of the DOT's regulations. "
864,5," Notwithstanding Gallo [**24] 's instruction that actual filing does not end the filed rate doctrine inquiry, Judge Wallace cites 
Gallo and Carlin as establishing a ""clear barrier"" between filed and unfiled rates, such that an agency's failure to regulate is only 
relevant where the rate in question was not filed. We do not find this reading of Gallo and Carlin persuasive. On the contrary, 
while those cases may have dealt with rates not actually filed, their reasoning expressly invokes ""the principles underlying [the] 
doctrine"" to find that its application does not turn on ""the act of literal rate filing."" Gallo, 503 F.3d at 1040. Our opinion does not 
effect the unbounded expansion that Judge Wallace cautions against. Rather, it consistently applies the logic expressly set forth 
in our prior cases. To hold, as Judge Wallace advocates, that merely filing a rate triggers application of the doctrine in every 
circumstance, would permit carriers to avoid civil antitrust damages by filing rates even where the relevant agency has expressly 
stated that it cannot or will not engage in regulation. Such application of the doctrine completely untethers it from both its 
underlying justification and the reasoning of our prior decisions. We decline to adopt such a rule. "
866,1," The majority, in footnote 5, asserts that Gallo stands for the proposition that the filed rate doctrine's application ""does not turn 
on 'the act of literal rate filing'"" (Majority Opinion at n.5, quoting Gallo, 503 F.3d at 1040). The majority's statement is misleading. 
The full sentence from Gallo, from which the majority selectively clips, is: ""Moreover, although the Supreme Court initially applied 
the Filed Rate Doctrine to actual filed rates, courts have held that the principles underlying this doctrine preclude challenges to a 
wide range of FERC actions, not just the act of literal rate filing."" Id. In essence, what Gallo conveys here is that while the filed 
rate doctrine has commonly applied only to actually-filed rates, its reach can expand even further, to scenarios in which rates 
have not been filed. In no way does Gallo suggest that the filed rate doctrine does not apply to actually-filed rates. Indeed, 
application to filed rates makes sense and is not ""unbounded,"" because it allows the DOT to rely on complaints about a filed rate 
to exercise its supervision. "
871,1," This calculation is identical to the one I docketed in October 2016. (ECF No. 493.) Because MacDermid objected to my 
calculation of CUTPA damages at that time (ECF No. 494), I ordered the parties to file briefs to address MacDermid's argument 
regarding restoration of a portion of the CUTPA damages award. (ECF No. 496.) Neither party objected to any other aspect of 
the calculation. I also extended the time for the parties to address attorneys' fees and interest until 14 days after this ruling. (ECF 
No. 498.) "
874,2," Note, however, that because the base of compensatory and punitive damages plus attorneys' fees was reduced by the 
elimination of the antitrust award to an amount that fell below MacDermid's $15 million offer of compromise (i.e., $11,824,818 in 
compensatory and punitive damages plus $2,641,587 in attorneys' fees = $14,466,405), MacDermid may no longer be entitled to 
offer-of-judgment interest. I raised this point in my original proposed recalculation but have not yet rendered a final ruling on it, 
due to the fact that the amount of post-judgment attorneys' fees may affect the calculus. (ECF No. 493 at 2.)"
874,3," Indeed, MacDermid also asks me to go further and assess a new punitive damages award under CUTPA, after performing a 
full analysis of the factors endorsed by Connecticut courts for determining punitive damages. (ECF No. 494 at 12-15.) This, too, 
would go well beyond ""recalculat[ing] damages."" MacDermid, 833 F.3d at 192."
874,4," MacDermid argues that the ""leaving undisturbed"" language is not part of the mandate, by which it apparently means that that 
phrase does not appear in the remand order. (ECF No. 500 at 7.) But even if the Second Circuit's judgment should be treated as 
""a formal mandate,"" Fed. R. App. P. 41(a), such that the mandate in this case does not include the opinion itself, I must still 
consider the opinion in construing the remand order, 18B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 4478.3 (2d 
ed. 2016)(""[I]t is proper to consult the appellate opinion for guidance in construing the mandate"") — especially when the remand 
order directs me to recalculate damages in a manner ""consistent with this Court's opinion."" (ECF No. 492 at 1.)"
874,5," I use the phrase ""antitrust component"" in this opinion only as shorthand for the portion of the jury's CUTPA award (i.e., 
$3,941,325) I found to be duplicative of the awards on the antitrust claims. "
875,6," MacDermid argues that the jury instructions do not warrant the conclusion that the jury's CUTPA verdict was legally derivative 
of its antitrust verdict, but I need not decide that issue. I conclude only that, in light of MacDermid's representations to the jury 
that its claim of a CUTPA violation ""rests on the antitrust "" issues, (ECF No. 462 at 89), it is not a ""serious injustice"" to leave at 
zero the antitrust portion of the CUTPA award now that the Second Circuit has found the antitrust claims legally deficient."
875,7," As Cortron points out, however, there were steps MacDermid could have taken in the appeal to attempt to create an opening 
for the argument it now seeks to make. (ECF No. 499 at 15.) For example, it could have asked the Second Circuit, in the event 
of reversal on the antitrust claims, to order that I revisit the antitrust component of the CUTPA award and decide whether it 
should be reinstated. It also could have sought rehearing of the Circuit's ruling to make the same point. MacDermid does not 
suggest that it took any such steps. "
876,8," I note that both parties appear to be in agreement that post-judgment interest is recoverable, and that such interest should be 
recalculated from February 17, 2015 — the date of original judgment. (ECF No. 499 at 24); (ECF No. 494 at 17.) Therefore, the 
parties need not address those issues in their memoranda. "
886,1," Stevens Creek initially brought four claims, but only the § 2(a) claim for damages remained at the time of trial."
886,2," This is in contrast to the typical RPA case, in which a smaller purchaser challenges volume based discounts for which it cannot 
qualify because of its size. See, e.g., FTC v. Morton Salt, 334 U.S. 37, 68 S. Ct. 822, 92 L. Ed. 1196, 44 F.T.C. 1499 (1948); 
Volvo Trucks, 546 U.S. at 176 (""Congress responded to the advent of large chainstores, enterprises with the clout to obtain 
lower prices for goods than smaller buyers could demand[, by enacting the RPA].""). "
891,3," The Court previously distinguished Southwest Paper on other grounds not relevant here. See Order on Motion to Exclude, ECF 
178. 12 "
893,4," The plaintiffs in Comcoa had proposed the following language: To be functionally available to all purchasers means that the level of discounts offered by defendants were equally available 
to all purchasers. If only large purchasers from defendants could, as a practical matter, qualify for the highest level of 
discount, then defendants' discounts were not functionally available to plaintiffs and therefore the price discrimination 
element of section 2(a) has been satisfied."
893,931, F.2d at 664 & n.13. 
907,1," The Court did not consider Plaintiffs' surreply, ECF No. 53, because it was filed without leave of court. ""Neither the local rules 
of this Court nor the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow a party to file a surreply as a matter of right."" Mize v. Quarterman, 
No. 4:07-cv-3507, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14012, 2010 WL 644844, at *5 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 18, 2010) (Ellison, J.) (striking surreply 
filed without leave of court)."
907,2, It is not clear from the amended complaint what the exact relationship is between Region 4 ESC and TCPN. 
909,3," Defendants do not challenge Plaintiffs' business tort claims on any other grounds. Nonetheless, the Court observes that 
Plaintiffs' claim that Gordian and R.S. Means conspired to ""cause the breach of contract that resulted in [P]laintiffs' damages,"" 
Am. Compl. ¶ 68, would likely not withstand 12(b)(6) scrutiny. HN2[
] Under Texas law, ""[t]he essential elements of a civil 
conspiracy claim are: 1) two or more persons; 2) an object to be accomplished; 3) a meeting of the minds on the object or 
course of action; 4) one or more unlawful, overt acts; and 5) damages as the proximate result."" Homoki v. Conversion Servs., 
Inc., 717 F.3d 388, 404-05 (5th Cir. 2013) (citing Juhl v. Airington, 936 S.W.2d 640, 644 (Tex. 1996)). Plaintiffs have not alleged 
sufficient factual matter to support all of these elements. In addition, Plaintiffs vaguely allege that Gordian ""acquired"" R.S. Means 
in July of 2014. Am. Compl. ¶ 15. It is not apparent that Texas law would permit a civil conspiracy claim in light of that 
acquisition. See Grizzle v. Tex. Commerce Bank, N.A., 38 S.W.3d 265, 284 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2001) (acknowledging split 
among Texas courts of appeals on whether a parent corporation can civilly conspire with its wholly-owned subsidiary), rev'd in 
part on other grounds, 96 S.W.3d 240 (Tex. 2002). "
912,4," Defendants cite Love Terminal Partners, L.P. v. City of Dallas, 527 F. Supp. 2d 538 (N.D. Tex. 2007). There, a court granted a 
motion to dismiss on Noerr-Pennington grounds, finding the sham exception inapplicable because the complaint ""fail[ed] to 
allege facts that would support [that] exception."" Id. at 552 n.7. Some other courts have also stated that plaintiffs must plead 
facts plausibly supporting the sham exception in order to avoid Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal on Noerr-Pennington grounds. E.g., 
Sweet St. Deserts, Inc. v. Chudleigh's Ltd., No. 12-3363, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49283, 2013 WL 1389760, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 
4, 2013) (""Plaintiff must sufficiently plead, therefore, that the demand letter was both 'objectively baseless' and 'subjectively 
motivated' by anticompetitive intent.""); Select Comfort Corp. v. Sleep Better Store, LLC, 838 F. Supp. 2d 889, 899 (D. Minn. 
2012) (""the pleadings do not reveal [the] claim [in a demand letter] to be objectively baseless""). These cases cannot be 
reconciled with the numerous authorities cited above, some of which are binding on this Court and all of which are more 
persuasive on this issue."
912,5," For purposes of the present motion, the Court assumes that the pre-litigation conduct upon which Plaintiffs' business tort claims 
are based consists entirely of ""acts reasonably and normally attendant upon effective litigation."" See Coastal States Mktg., 694 
F.2d at 1367. It is not clear that this is an accurate assumption, however. The amended complaint alleges that Defendants took various actions beyond sending the cease-and-desist letter to Plaintiffs. 
See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 26 (alleging that Gordian ""publically [sic] criticiz[ed] Plaintiffs by alleging that Plaintiffs did not have 
ownership rights to the material in the CCD Catalogue""); id. ¶ 59 (Defendants ""threat[ened] legal action"" and ""publically alleg[ed] 
that Plaintiffs did not have ownership rights to the material in the CCD Catalogue,"" which resulted in both 4Clicks Solutions and 
KATA Management terminating their agreements with Plaintiffs); id. ¶ 70 (""Defendants published disparaging statements, both 
orally and written, about Plaintiffs' ownership rights to the material in the CCD Catalogue. Defendants stated Plaintiffs did not 
have ownership rights to the material in the CCD Catalogue . . . . "" (emphasis added)). It is not readily apparent that these 
actions were ""reasonably and normally attendant upon effective litigation,"" at least insofar as they were directed to Plaintiffs' 
customers and business partners or other third parties and were not sufficiently tied to the threatened litigation. See Wolf, 2016 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118857, 2016 WL 4597638, at *8 n.6 (refusing to decide, at 12(b)(6) stage, whether defendant's ""direct 
communications with [plaintiff's client] encouraging [the client] not to work with [p]laintiffs should be considered acts reasonably 
attendant upon litigation and immunized under Noerr-Pennington""); Luxpro Corp. v. Apple, Inc., 658 F. Supp. 2d 921, 929 (W.D. 
Ark. 2009) (denying 12(b)(6) motion where defendant had not shown that its ""post-litigation conduct of sending warning letters, 
making threats, and exerting pressure on [plaintiff's] clients [was] incidental to the prosecution of the . . . litigation . . . [or] was in 
anyway related to its right to petition a court""); Laitram Mach., Inc. v. Carnitech A/S, 901 F. Supp. 1155, 1161 (E.D. La. 1995) 
(""The Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not extend to sending letters to a competitor's customers alleging violation of trade 
secrets and infringement of patents."" (emphasis added)); cf. Coastal States Mktg., 694 F.2d at 1367-68 & n.30 (threats to 
actually litigate against a competitor's customers are not ""per se unprotected""); Matsushita Elecs. Corp. v. Loral Corp., 974 F. 
Supp. 345, 359 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (holding that demand letters sent to defendants on day suit was filed, and letters sent thereafter 
to non-litigant companies as part of a ""reasonable attempt to determine whether it should join those companies as defendants,"" 
were ""reasonably attendant upon effective litigation""). To the extent they were not, those actions lie outside the limits of the 
Noerr-Pennington defense, regardless of the sham litigation exception. The Court's recommendation that Defendants' motion be denied in light of the sham exception makes further consideration of 
this issue unnecessary at this stage. See Wolf, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118857, 2016 WL 4597638, at *8 n.6. Further 
development of the facts may add clarity or obviate the question entirely. "
913,6," The Court does not find it appropriate to convert Defendants' 12(b)(6) motion into one for summary judgment. See Harris v. 
Coastal Offshore, Inc., No. 2:11-cv-58, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64314, 2011 WL 2457922, at *3-4 (S.D. Tex. June 16, 2011) 
(Jack, J.)."
913,7," The letter designates ""CCD"" as collectively referring to All Cost Data, CCD, JOC Group, and MJS, but also appears to use 
""CCD"" to mean Construction Cost Data, LLC alone. "
915,8," This case is unlike those where courts have found that an exhibit, on its face, ""directly refute[s]"" a crucial allegation made in the 
complaint. See Sheppard v. Tex. Dep't of Transp., 158 F.R.D. 592, 597-98 (E.D. Tex. 1994) (granting motion to dismiss where 
plaintiff alleged he had received a right-to-sue letter but exhibit showed that the letter was not a right-to-sue letter); Case v. State 
Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 294 F.2d 676, 676-78 (5th Cir. 1961) (district court properly dismissed plaintiff's claim that defendant 
wrongfully terminated contract because terms of the contract, which was attached to the complaint, gave defendant the right to 
terminate the agreement with or without cause). "
916,9," The letter's mere assertion that the Construction Task Catalog was ""a registered trademark"" of Gordian does not establish this 
fact. Rather, the Court takes judicial notice of the official trademark registration documents attached to Defendants' Second 
Amended Counterclaims. ECF No. 29-2; see Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d 454, 461 n.6 (5th Cir. 2007) (HN18[
] ""[I]t is clearly proper in deciding a 12(b)(6) motion to take judicial notice of matters of public record."")."
916,10," Nor does it directly refute, for 12(b)(6) purposes, Plaintiffs' allegation that the Construction Cost Catalog was based on data 
from a publicly available unit price book the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers created. See Am. Compl. ¶ 20. "
917,11," While the October 2015 registration occurred after Defendants sent the cease-and-desist letters, HN21[
] ""registration is not required to obtain copyright protection, see 17 U.S.C. § 408(a), [although] it is a prerequisite to bringing an infringement action in 
federal court, see [17 U.S.C.] § 411(a)."" BWP Media USA, Inc. v. Gossip Cop Media, LLC, 87 F. Supp. 3d 499, 503 (S.D.N.Y. 
2015). "
918,12," HN29[
] The TFEAA provides that it is to be interpreted ""in harmony with federal judicial interpretations of comparable federal antitrust statutes."" Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 15.04. Courts regularly apply principles developed under federal antitrust 
law, particularly the Sherman Antitrust Act, to claims brought under the TFEAA. See In re Mem'l Hermann Hosp. Sys., 464 
S.W.3d 686, 708 & n.107 (Tex. 2015); McPeters v. LexisNexis, 11 F. Supp. 3d 789, 796-97 (S.D. Tex. 2014) (Ellison, J.). "
919,13," In the Court's view, Defendants' motion to dismiss meaningfully challenges only the ""monopoly power"" sub-element. See Mot. 
Dismiss 13-14. In their response, however, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants' motion seeks to ""re-defin[e] the relevant market 
presented in Plaintiffs' [amended complaint]"" by ""deceptively expanding the market to include all services involving construction 
cost data"" rather than just job order contracting unit price books. Pls.' Resp. to Mot. Dismiss ¶¶ 20-21. While that response 
arguably removes any prejudice Plaintiffs may have incurred with respect to the relevant product market issue, at no point have 
the parties presented argument regarding the relevant geographic market. Even if Defendants' reply could somehow be 
construed as doing so, HN38[
] Defendants' ""failure to raise this argument in [their] opening brief is sufficient to deny it."" Barrash v. Am. Ass'n of Neurological Surgeons, Inc., No. 4:13-CV-1054, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12056, 2014 WL 357809, at *12 
(S.D. Tex. Jan. 31, 2014) (Ellison, J.) (citing Conway v. United States, 647 F.3d 228, 237 n.8 (5th Cir. 2011) (HN39[
] 
""Arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are forfeited."")); accord Gillaspy v. Dallas Ind. Sch. Dist., 278 F. App'x 307, 
315 (5th Cir. May 13, 2008) (unpublished opinion) (""It is the practice of this court and the district courts to refuse to consider 
arguments raised for the first time in reply briefs."" (citations omitted)); Murthy v. Abbott Labs., 847 F. Supp. 2d 958, 977 n.9 (S.D. 
Tex. 2012) (Ellison, J.) (same). "
920,," In any case, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged the ""rough contours"" of a relevant geographic market. 
HN40[
] A relevant geographic market is ""the area in which the defendant effectively competes with other individuals or 
businesses for the distribution of the relevant product."" Morton Bldgs. of Neb., Inc. v. Morton Bldgs., Inc., 531 F.2d 910, 918 (8th 
Cir. 1976); accord Wampler, 597 F.3d at 744 (the relevant geographic market is defined as ""the area of effective competition,"" 
which is the ""area 'in which the seller operates and to which buyers can practicably turn for supplies'""). The parties agree that 
Plaintiffs define the relevant geographic market to be ""Texas,"" which is consistent with the repeated references to Texas in the 
amended complaint. Pls.' Resp. to Mot. Dismiss ¶ 20; Defs.' Reply 7. The allegations that Plaintiffs competed with Defendants in 
Texas and that vendors and contractors in Texas were unable to find alternatives to Defendants' product before Plaintiffs 
entered the market or after Plaintiffs left it, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 36-38, plausibly suggest that Texas is the area of effective 
competition. Although Plaintiffs allude to the national market and other markets, those references are not inconsistent with the 
existence of a discrete Texas market (or submarket), and there is nothing before the Court to indicate that a localized market for 
job order contracting unit price books is implausible. "
921,14," Contrary to Defendants' contention, these allegations are not ""conclusory."" See Mot. Dismiss 13. HN46[
] Courts ""label 
allegations conclusory when they are vague, lacking in specifics, or amount to mere recitations of the relevant legal standards 
without any supporting factual narrative."" Morris v. Thaler, 425 F. App'x 415, 423 (5th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (unpublished 
opinion). Plaintiffs' allegations are none of those things. For example, the allegation that Gordian's acquisition of R.S. Means in 
2014 gave Defendants control of ""100% of the market"" for unit price books is supported not only by the alleged 30% price hike, 
but also by allegations that ""vendors no longer had a readily available alternative commercial"" unit price book to use and that 
Plaintiffs' short-lived entry into the market gave customers ""2 options"" to select from. Am. Compl. ¶ 37. "
925,1," Plaintiff also makes contradictory allegations about blood plasma proteins having a ""high degree of substitutability"" and that 
""there are no suitable substitutes for these products, at any price."" Thus, the Court does not consider these allegations in 
evaluating the sufficiency of the Complaint, since they effectively cancel one another out. "
931,1," The Court also incorporates by reference its prior orders from October 31, 2016 (ECF No. 56) and November 17, 2016 (ECF 
Nos. 76-77). "
932,2," In the Order Consolidating Cases, the Court noted that Sidlo agreed to consolidation for purposes of discovery. ECF No. 29 at 
2 n.1; Sidlo, ECF No. 85 at 2 n.1; see also ECF No. 56 (noting consolidation for purposes of discovery)."
932,3," Each of these orders was filed both in the instant case as ECF Nos. 56, 76, and 77 and in the Sidlo litigation, as ECF Nos. 487, 
507, and 508, respectively. "
933,4," EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd, provides that a hospital may not transfer an individual whose ""emergency medical condition has 
not been stabilized"" unless the transfer is appropriate and defines what constitutes an appropriate transfer."
933,5," Although AMR was not named in the FACC; based on the filings in the Sidlo litigation, the Court is aware that the competitor 
referenced in the FACC is AMR (not to be confused with HLF's parent company AMRG). Based on information from the Sidlo 
matter, AMR appears to have entered the market shortly before it signed the contract with KFHP in September 2013. Sidlo, 
KFHP's Supplemental Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 285-1 at 4 (""To avoid HLF's rapidly increasing prices, KFHP 
entered into a long-term contract with AMR, a new air transport company in Hawaii, in September 2013."") (relying on Decl. of 
Thomas Risse ¶ 3, Sidlo, ECF No. 287-1)."
933,6," HLF has alleged that its own FCAs ""recognize that the treating physician under EMTALA is free to call upon an alternative 
transportation service provider if a patient has an [emergency medical condition]"" and thus the FCAs do not violate EMTALA. 
See FACC ¶ 25. HLF alleges that KFHP's pre-authorization mandate to hospitals, by contrast, applies ""regardless of whether the 
patient has an EMC"" and thus violates EMTALA. See id. ¶ 26. KFHP asserted at the hearing that its pre-authorization 
requirement only covers non-emergency conditions and still allows hospitals to select the air transport provider in an emergency 
situation as required by EMTALA, citing a letter from March 19, 2015 discussed infra at 10-11. However, this Court may not 
decide which party's interpretation is correct on a motion to dismiss. The Court also notes that HLF has alleged that KFHP's pre-
authorization demands were made regardless of whether patients were in an unstabilized condition, and that KFHP's March 19, 
2015 letter is not definitive on this issue. The Court thus must accept as true at this stage that at least some of the flights at issue 
involved patients in an unstable condition. "
934,7," Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201(c)(1), a court ""may take judicial notice on its own."" The Court will take judicial notice 
of this letter, as it is central to the theories of HLF's direct claims, both parties referred to it at the April 4, 2017 hearing, and the 
authenticity does not appear to be in dispute as both parties consented to the Court's prior consideration of this letter in the 
instant matter and the Sidlo action. See ECF No. 74; Sidlo, ECF No. 505 (indicating that both parties consented to review of this 
letter, among other documents); see also infra at 15-16, 57-58 (discussing standards for judicial notice). "
936,8," Like EMTALA's delegation of authority to the treating hospital or physician to choose the emergency air transport provider, 42 
U.S.C. § 1395dd, the regulations governing the ACA state that an insurance plan or issuer must cover emergency services 
""[w]ithout the need for any prior authorization determination, even if the emergency services are provided on an out-of-network 
basis."" 29 C.F.R. § 2590.715-2719A(b)(2)(i). KFHP's alleged mandate to hospitals to obtain pre-authorization for emergency 
transports, if true, would implicate EMTALA and the ACA in the same way. As the FACC and the parties' briefing focuses on 
EMTALA, the Court will do likewise here."
936,9," The Court notes that this second definition of ""unfair conduct"" may appear to allow claims based on the violation of any law's 
policy or spirit. However, read according to its plain language this formulation permits only violations of an antitrust law's policy 
or spirit, as it refers to ""those laws"" stated in the first definition, which relate to antitrust. Cf. Hungate v. Law Office of David B. 
Rosen, 139 Haw. 394, 391 P.3d 1 (2017) (where statutory language is unambiguous, courts ""give effect to plain and obvious 
meaning""). In addition, interpreting ""those laws"" to refer to competition-related laws accords with the scope of the other two 
definitions. See State v. Crouser, 81 Haw. 5, 13 n.6, 911 P.2d 725, 733 (1996) (in interpreting legal texts, the meaning of words 
or phrases may be determined by reference to those associated with it under the principle of noscitur a sociis). Cf. Island 
Tobacco Co. v. R.J. Reynolds Indus., Inc., 513 F. Supp. 726, 737 (D. Haw. 1981) (""Unfair trade practices which violate the spirit 
of the antitrust laws fall within the purview of the [FTCA].""); Bartleys Town & Country Shops, Inc. v. Dillingham Corp., 530 F. 
Supp. 499, 514 (D. Haw. 1982) (discussing with approval a Seventh Circuit case noting that the FTCA was ""designed to restrain 
practices as unfair"" which had not yet but were likely to grow into ""Sherman Act dimensions"" if unrestrained). "
937,10," It is for this reason that HLF's citation to Coast Plaza Doctors Hospital v. UHP Healthcare, 105 Cal. App. 4th 693, 705, 129 
Cal. Rptr. 2d 650 (2002) for the proposition that courts have allowed unfair competition claims for alleged violations of EMTALA, 
Opp. at 9, is not persuasive. Because California defines unfair competition to include otherwise unlawful practices, a plaintiff 
alleging unfair competition in California could base its claim on a violation of EMTALA regardless of whether it had an 
independent right to sue under EMTALA itself or whether a violation of EMTALA affects competition. In any event, the Court is 
not bound to follow the holding of this particular case and declines to do so here."
937,11," Although HLF asserts that Whitey's Boat Cruises is distinguishable because it dealt with a common law unfair competition 
claim, as opposed to a statutory claim, HLF has not provided, nor has the Court been able to locate, any authority addressing 
how that difference might be relevant in interpreting the type of conduct Hawaii courts consider unfair. "
938,12," The parties have not discussed whether Congress was concerned with business interests or competition in enacting the ACA. 
However, the Court notes that, like EMTALA, the seemingly applicable regulations for the ACA appear to limit causes of action 
for a violation the preauthorization requirement to those brought by the Secretary of Labor or plan participants or beneficiaries 
and do not allow business competitors more broadly to bring claims. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132, 1134. The Court's holdings 
regarding EMTALA would thus appear to apply to the ACA as well. However, as the parties have not briefed this issue or any 
implications for standing, and given the Court's other holdings on this claim, the Court declines to address this further."
938,13," If Hawaii were, like California, to borrow violations of other laws, then it would allow HLF to assert a cause of action based on 
EMTALA despite not being a patient. However, as KFHP asserts, the cause of action would be against hospitals, not against 
health plans like KFHP. See 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(d)(2)(A) (providing for a ""civil action against the participating hospital""); see 
also Jackson v. E. Bay Hosp. 246 F.3d 1248, 1260 n.6 (9th Cir. 2001) (""EMTALA only applies to hospitals which choose to 
participate in Medicare.""); Eberhardt, 62 F.3d at 1257 (""EMTALA does not allow private suits against physicians.""). Allowing a 
claim against KFHP would go well beyond even California's borrowing statute, as it would expand not only the category of 
persons who could bring claims for violations of other laws, but also the category of persons who may be held to have violated 
those laws. The Court is unwilling to read HRS § 480-2 so broadly in the absence of more explicit authority."
938,14," Although HLF has alleged that prior to KFHP's pre-authorization requirement, physicians generally chose HLF over its 
competitor, FACC ¶ 187, HLF has not plausibly alleged that choosing its competitor resulted in increased risks of or actual harm 
to patients."
938,15," HLF asserted at the hearing that it would need to reach discovery in order to know whether there was injury to patients. 
However, whether or not discovery will support allegations does not absolve HLF of the burden to plead the existence of such 
injuries; otherwise, HLF's claim risks an unwarranted fishing expedition. "
940,16," ""[L]ower prices, so long as they are not predatory, actually benefit competition, as opposed to harming it."" Wadsworth, 818 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1267. HLF has not suggested a predatory pricing scheme exists, nor does one seem plausible here, especially 
given the absence of allegations that KFHP has substantial market power, which are critical for a predatory competitor to recoup 
its losses. See Rebel Oil Co., Inc. v. Atl. Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1434 (9th Cir. 1995); FACC ¶ 188; see also infra at 33-35 
(discussing allegations regarding economic power)."
940,17," The Court notes that, contrary to KFHP's implication, Motion at 13, it appears that under Hawaii law HLF does not have to 
allege that KFHP competes with HLF. See HMA, 113 Haw. at 110, 148 P.3d at 1212 (holding that ""plaintiffs need not be 
competitors of [the defendant]"" nor need they be ""in competition"" with the defendant). This appears to differ with federal 
antitrust law, which requires that the parties compete in the same market. See Amarel v. Connell, 102 F.3d 1494, 1508 (9th Cir. 
1996) as amended (Jan. 15, 1997). However, even under Hawaii law, the plaintiff must still sufficiently allege the nature of 
competition. HMA, 113 Haw. at 111-12, 148 P.3d at 1213-14."
940,18," Indeed, in supporting its conclusions, the Hawaii Supreme Court quoted and emphasized the following factual allegations, 
among others: ""[The defendant] dominates the enrollee market in Hawaii with over 65% of Hawaii's population enrolled in one of 
HMSA's plans. In this regard, HMSA is the largest provider of fee-for-service insurance in the State with more than 90% of the "
941,," market and is the second largest HMO provider in the State. Similarly, [the defendant] dominates the physician market, with 
approximately 90% of Hawaii's physicians participating in HMSA's networks."" HMA, 113 Haw. at 112, 148 P.3d at 1214 
(emphasis omitted)."
941,19," As Wadsworth post-dates both Twombly and Iqbal, the discussion of HMA in Wadsworth reaffirms the reasoning of the Hawaii 
Supreme Court in finding the HMA pleading sufficient even in light of the stricter pleading standards of Twombly and Iqbal, 
contrary to what KFHP suggests. See Reply at 5."
941,20," HLF's allegations that KFHP plausibly could achieve this result are also suspect, as discussed infra at 34-35."
941,21," Indeed, KFHP asserted at the hearing that HLF has FCAs with other healthcare providers like HMSA. ECF No. 101 at 11 (Tr. 
of H'ring). Although such information is not currently before the Court, and is thus not properly considered, that type of 
information would be relevant for understanding how the flights at issue relate to the market for air ambulance services in Hawaii 
and the corresponding impact on HLF and on the market as a whole. "
942,22," Although HLF indicated at the hearing that the hospitals acceded because KFHP threatened them with breach of contract 
lawsuits, HLF has not suggested that such lawsuits were meritless. To the contrary, the March 19 letter suggests that KFHP was 
attempting to enforce existing contracts in non-emergency transports, which undermines the plausibility of HLF's allegations that 
KFHP's pre-authorization requirement was anticompetitive. Moreover, as KFHP notes, hospitals can face severe penalties for 
violating EMTALA. See Reply at 4, and the March 19 letter supports that doctors, like Dr. McDowell, strive to abide by EMTALA 
in circumstances where they believe it applies."
942,23," Moreover, to the extent that an increased level of patient risk is relevant, HLF has only alleged the possibility that choosing the 
competitor service might increase the risk because the transport might take longer. See FACC ¶¶ 2 (""In situations where 
minutes can mean the difference between life and death, a patient's life may literally depend on the ability of an air ambulance to 
respond to a situation immediately.""); 187 (HLF has three times as many aircraft as its competitor); 188-89 (HLF provides faster, 
better service than its competitor). However, HLF has not alleged facts plausibly indicating that lower quality of service matters in 
the flights at issue. "
943,24," Indeed, the market may now offer a choice between two medically appropriate service providers competing on both quality 
and price: HLF, which offers an allegedly higher-quality (that is, potentially quicker) but higher-priced ambulance service, and 
AMR, which offers an allegedly lower-quality (i.e., potentially slower) but also lower-priced service. The shift in the market 
alleged in HLF's FACC may simply reflect a preference for the latter option, finding it represents a better overall value. 
Agreements made by insurers, hospitals, and service providers, such as those referred to in the March 19, 2015 letter may 
represent such a balance between patients' interests in the promptness of service and price."
943,25," The Court notes that EMTALA may complicate the interplay of competitive forces in the air ambulance market in Hawaii. While 
HLF has correctly alleged that EMTALA delegates the authority to choose the transport service used to the treating physician, 
FACC ¶ 22; EMTALA does not appear to address the issue that it is the insurer of unstabilized patients, not the treating 
physicians, who bears the cost of emergency flights. The Court notes that HLF has asserted that it should be allowed to charge, 
in the case of an unstabilized patient, a rate set only ""by market and competitive forces."" Sidlo, HLF's Limited Response to 
Factual Assertions Made By KFHP, ECF No. 355-2 at 5 n.3. In any event, it remains HLF's duty to sufficiently allege injury to 
competition if it wishes to bring a claim for unfair competition. "
946,26," Although the Court recognizes that KFHP's assertions in the letter might be contradicted or proven untrue, the fact that HLF is 
aware of KFHP's stated position in this letter and has failed to allege any facts which would undermine it is troubling."
946,27," 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) provides that a plan participant or beneficiary may bring a civil action ""to recover benefits due to him 
under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the 
terms of the plan."" HLF has brought claims as the assignee of benefits, which assignment this Court previously held does not 
violate the anti-assignment provision of the plan. ECF No. 76 at 31."
946,28, ECF No. 56 in this action was also filed as ECF No. 487 in the Sidlo action. 
947,29," As KFHP notes, the pendency of the Sidlo appeal does not preclude the application of collateral estoppel. See Robi v. Five 
Platters, Inc., 838 F.2d 318, 327 (9th Cir. 1988) (""The present appeals in no way affect the 'firmness' of the Robi decisions in the 
district court for purposes of issue preclusion."")."
947,30," The Court recognizes that HLF has presented claims under Section G for preservation and to the extent that any patient was 
transported from the scene of an incident to a facility, rather than between facilities. Opp. at 23 n.11. Based on the FACC, the 
Court cannot determine whether there are any scene-to-facility transports that may be governed by Section G. However, to the 
extent that HLF is asserting that facility-to-facility transports are governed by Section G, the Court finds such claims to be 
collaterally estopped by virtue of the Sidlo decision. "
948,31," In addition, this Court issued a minute order on September 6, 2016 noting that the parties appeared at the time to agree that 
the fair market rate is the appropriate rate and directed the parties to explore with the magistrate judge whether they could use 
alternative dispute resolution to determine what fair market value rate was. ECF No. 38. Moreover, during the summary 
judgment hearing the Court indicated multiple times that it encouraged the parties to address the rate of reimbursement issue 
before the magistrate judge. See Sidlo, Tr. of Hearing, Sept. 15, 2016, ECF No. 421 at 16, 97. These directives belie KFHP's 
assertion that the Court has already determined what the proper rate of reimbursement was, and the Court additionally notes 
that the parties do not currently appear to agree that fair market value is the appropriate rate. "
950,32," KFHP also made an offer of legal defense to its members. See Request, Ex. 2. However, as the offer of defense does not 
appear to be at issue here, the Court will not discuss it further. "
951,33," HLF argued at the hearing that it seeks to have the Court through the assignment determine the amounts to which HLF has 
alleged it is entitled, and the indemnity would be the means of collecting those amounts after entitlement has been proven. 
However, this discussion at the hearing only further reinforces the Court's conclusion that this claim is not yet ripe. "
952,34," The court in Brewer noted that it ""was unaware of any Hawai'i cases that have expanded this principle to include legal rights 
that the assignor acquired after the assignment."" 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46429, 2011 WL 1637323, at *11. This Court has also 
been unable to locate any such authority in Hawaii."
952,35," In its Opposition, HLF does not assert that there has been any other assignment of rights apart from that given in the Standard 
Ambulance Consent Form. See Opp. at 30. "
953,36," KFHP has argued that the assignment by its plain terms does not include indemnification. See Reply at 18. However, even if 
the term ""payment"" could be construed to include indemnification rights, the Assignors could still only assign those rights that 
existed at the time of assignment. As such, the Court does not need to reach the interpretation of the term because the 
Assignors did not have this right at the time of assignment to the extent it was not included in the benefits plans. See Request, 
Ex. 4. The Court discusses infra HLF's position that the benefits plans should be construed to include the indemnity promises if 
they are held preempted. "
955,37," Although KFHP does not explicitly claim to be acting in its fiduciary capacity in its communications to members regarding the 
indemnification, the effect of its indemnification offer is to uphold the interests of its members and ensure that their ultimate 
liability is limited to the extent set forth in their plans."
955,38," In its conclusion, the court in Borton relied on Davidian v. Southern California Meat Cutters Union & Food Employees Benefit 
Fund, 859 F.2d 134 (9th Cir. 1988), which affirmed a finding of preemption as to claims for bad faith, fraud, deceit, and breach of 
fiduciary duty by a plan member against a plan. There, a representative of the plan allegedly misled him as to the limitations of "
956,," various health insurance plans from which he could choose on retirement, and the Ninth Circuit concluded that these claims 
were preempted because they related to the administration of an employee benefit plan. 859 F.3d at 135. "
961,1," Cigna has become a reluctant supporter of the merger, stating in its appellate brief that ""[i]n accordance with the merger 
agreement, Cigna has appealed and defers to Anthem."" Cigna Br. 3. Indeed, the district court noted the ""elephant in the 
courtroom,"" for at trial Cigna executives dismissed various of Anthem's claims of savings, cross-examined the merging parties' 
expert witness, and refused to sign Anthem's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. United States v. Anthem, Inc., 
236 F. Supp. 3d 171, 2017 WL 685563, at *4 (D.D.C. 2017). Anthem suggested this is a ""'side issue,' a mere 'rift between 
CEOs.'"" Id. That their relationship may have deteriorated has little to do with the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger. "
977,1," In addition, the dissenting opinion's rosy forecast (at 8) that Anthem's employer-customers would then automatically use those 
(unproven) savings to raise their employees' pay is cut out of whole cloth. Not even Anthem offered up that Panglossian 
prediction."
977,2," Curiously, none of the large employers who, according to Anthem, stand to gain billions of dollars in savings have filed any brief 
in support of this merger."
977,3," See also Rebel Oil Co. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1433 (9th Cir. 1995) (""Consumer welfare is maximized when 
economic resources are allocated to their best use, and when consumers are assured competitive price and quality."") (citing, 
inter alia, National Gerimedical Hosp. & Gerontology Ctr. v. Blue Cross of Kansas City, 452 U.S. 378, 387-388, 101 S. Ct. 2415, 
69 L. Ed. 2d 89 & n.13 (1981)). "
978,4," See also Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 988 (9th Cir. 2000) (""[T]he central purpose of the antitrust 
laws, state and federal, is to preserve competition. It is competition—not the collusive fixing of prices at levels either low or 
high—that these statutes recognize as vital to the public interest."")."
978,5," Thus far the courts of appeals—including United States v. Baker Hughes, 908 F.2d 981, 285 U.S. App. D.C. 222 (D.C. Cir. 
1990), and all of the cases on which the dissenting opinion relies—have only held that efficiencies may be used as part of an 
evidentiary burden-shifting scheme to rebut the government's prima facie showing of an anticompetitive merger. No court of 
appeals has gone as far as Anthem and held that a reduction in costs standing alone greenlights a substantially anticompetitive 
merger that would otherwise be barred by the Clayton Act. See Federal Trade Comm'n v. University Health, Inc., 938 F.2d 1206, 
1222 n.29 (11th Cir. 1991) (""Of course, once it is determined that a merger would substantially lessen competition, expected 
economies, however great, will not insulate the merger from a section 7 challenge.""); AREEDA & HOVENKAMP, supra, ¶ 970f, at 42. "
980,1," To be sure, if a price decrease were accompanied by a substantial reduction in quality, that fact would raise a separate concern 
about this merger. But here, the record does not contain sufficient evidence, beyond some speculation and guesswork by the 
Government, that the merger would cause an actual decrease in the quality of medical service provided to employers by 
hospitals and doctors, or in the quality of customer service provided to employers by insurers. Relatedly, the Government suggests that the current Cigna employer-customers, once switched over to Anthem after the 
merger, would utilize healthcare services more often. The Government argues that the higher utilization would cancel out some 
of the cost savings that the employer-customers would otherwise achieve. That suggestion is likewise highly speculative and 
does not square with the record, which shows that current Anthem employer-customers have lower utilization rates than the 
current Cigna employer-customers. See J.A. 480. "

1019,1," The Board found as fact that Petitioners ""have disputed the results of the peer review."" (Board Order, Findings of Fact no. 10.)"
1019,2," The Board's reference to ""Generally Accepted Auditing Standards ('GAAS')"" appears to be a misnomer. The NCAC refers to 
""generally accepted auditing standards,"" 21 NCAC 08N.0403, and to ""Government Auditing Standards,"" 21 NCAC 08N.0409, 
both of which appear to be applicable to the audit reviewed by Purvis in this case. "
1022,3," G.S. § 93-12 provides in pertinent part that the ""Board . . . shall consist of seven members to be appointed by the Governor, 
five persons to be holders of valid and unrevoked certificates as certified public accountants issued under the provisions of this

1033,3," ""Dual tracking"" occurs when a servicer is negotiating with defaulted homeowners on their loans for a loan modification while 
also initiating the foreclosure process. See Gelinas v. Bank of America, N.A., No. 16-1355-RAJ, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 45845, 
2017 WL 1153859, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 28, 2017). "
1035,4," In opposition, Plaintiff argues that the property is still considered a principal residence under RESPA since the home is being 
used by the family after Smith moved into a nursing care facility in October 2015 and the property is not used for business, 
commercial or agricultural purposes. In reply, Defendant argues Smith has not alleged and can no longer show that she actually 
resides and intends to remain at the property. The Court declines to consider the hypothetical allegations that are not yet alleged 
in the complaint and reserves the issue for further briefing in the event Defendant files another motion to dismiss. "
1037,5," Congress granted the CFPB exclusive authority to interpret the federal consumer financial laws and deference shall be granted 
under Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). 
Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v. Morgan Drexen, Inc., 60 F. Supp. 3d 1082, 1091 (C.D. Cal. 2014). "
1038,6," The parties also dispute whether other complaints against SLS that were submitted to the CFPB can be used to allege a 
""pattern or practice."" The complaint cites five different complaints against SLS to the CFPB concerning loan modification issues. 
(Dkt. No. 1, Compl. ¶ 14.) Since Plaintiff's allegations of alleged RESPA violations against SLS are sufficient to allege a ""pattern 
or practice"", the Court need not address this issue."
1038,7," While Plaintiff argues she also alleged a loss in equity in her property, it is not claimed in the complaint. "

1065,4," Koehler, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 176971, 2012 WL 6217635, supra, is a notable exception. However, the author of that opinion, 
Judge Illston, later expressly repudiated its reasoning and held that ""to establish standing, plaintiff must allege that he intends to

1086,2," Since the Court finds that ChromaDex's claim is barred by the economic loss rule, it need not consider Elysium's arguments as 
to whether ChromaDex adequately pled justifiable reliance. (See Dkt. 30-1 at 9.)"
1086,3," Since the Court finds that ChromaDex has failed to allege the existence of a protectable trade secret, it need not consider 
Elysium's additional arguments as to whether these claims are sufficiently pled. (See Dkt. 30-1 at 11-21.) "
1088,4," See Dkt. 38 at 13-14 (relying on Inamed Corp. v. Kuzmak, 275 F. Supp. 2d 1100, 1124 (C.D. Cal. 2002); B. Braun Med. Inc. v.

1094,1," These agreements were entered into by Defendant, Cephalon, Inc. (""Cephalon""), the brand-name manufacturer of Provigil, and 
the following Defendant generic drug manufacturers: Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Barr""); Mylan Laboratories, Inc. and Mylan 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively ""Mylan""); Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. 
(collectively ""Teva""); and Ranbaxy Laboratories, Ltd. and Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively ""Ranbaxy"") (collectively 
referred to as the ""Generic Defendants""). "
1095,2," The Daubert motion challenging Dr. Singer's damages analysis was filed by all Defendants. However, Cephalon, Teva and Barr 
have since settled with Apotex and the Retailer Plaintiffs. (See Dkt. 06-1797, Doc. No. 503; Dkt. 06-2768, Doc. No. 1057.)"
1095,3," The FDA publishes a list of all patents covering a drug under which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be 
asserted in the ""Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations"" publication, also known as the Orange 
Book. Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd., 527 F.3d at 1282. "
1096,4," As a result of studying Provigil's effects on children, Cephalon also received an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity on 
Provigil, extending Cephalon's exclusivity period through April 6, 2015. "
1097,5," As a result of the settlement with Cephalon, the following claims brought by Apotex are no longer part of the case: 1) Walker 
Process fraud against Cephalon in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; (2) sham litigation against Cephalon in violation of 
Section 2 of the Sherman Act; and (3) tortious interference with prospective business relations against Cephalon."
1097,6," Dr. Singer also provides an alternate calculation in which the initial damages period extends from June 2007 through 
September 2009, in the event that the jury finds that Apotex would not have entered the market until June 2007. (See Singer 
Supp. Rep., Appx. 3, ¶ 11.) "
1100,7," Mr. Thomas opined that Cephalon's various FDA exclusivities would have lapsed on June 24, 2006. (See Thomas Rep. ¶ 117.) "
1101,8," Plaintiffs filed a motion in limine seeking to preclude Defendants from presenting evidence or arguing that Cephalon would 
have sued Apotex in the but-for world. I denied this motion without prejudice because I could not resolve the issues raised 
therein without considering actual pieces of evidence or argument and the context in which they were presented. (See Doc. No. 
1050, Or. Jan 20, 2016.) In denying the motion, I noted that Plaintiffs are free to renew their objections at the trial as the record 
develops. That said, if Plaintiffs elicit from Dr. Singer testimony that Cephalon would not have sued Apotex in the but-for world, 
Defendants' evidence and argument to the contrary are certainly relevant. In the event that Defendants do seek to present such 
evidence and argument, Plaintiffs may renew their other objections at the appropriate time. "
1102,9," The motion was originally referred to Magistrate Judge David R. Strawbridge for disposition. Judge Strawbridge initially granted 
Defendants' motion to exclude Mr. Fahner's opinions. However, Apotex objected to the ruling, and I partially reversed Judge 
Strawbridge's order, finding that Mr. Fahner's opinion as to generic Provigil's re-launch date in the but-for world was admissible. "
1104,10," Dr. Singer explained during deposition that averaging market share assumptions in this manner is ""a fairly common thing to 
do, and because each month is being treated the same, [he is] fairly confident that had [he] done a step function, five five five 
and then ten ten ten, [he is] pretty confident it wouldn't have made a difference."" (Singer Dep., Feb. 28, 2014, pp. 198-99.) 
Defendants provide no evidence indicating that averaging market shares in this manner is uncommon for economists or 
otherwise improper."
1104,11," Defendants attempt to argue that Dr. Singer's review of the 2011 and 2013 market share projections was deficient because he 
did not independently verify with Apotex that the projections were prepared for the same purpose and used in the same manner 
as the initial entry market share projections described above. Dr. Singer explained that after reviewing various depositions and 
speaking with Apotex employees, he understood that the initial market share projections were created in Apotex's day-to-day 
business operations, and were used to make various decisions about market entry and opportunities. (Singer Dep., Feb. 28, 
2014, pp. 183-84.) He explained that he understood the 2011 and 2013 market share projections to be used in the same 
fashion, but could not recall independently verifying that understanding with Apotex employees. (Id. at pp. 184-86.) However, 
there is no indication in the record that the creation or purpose of the 2011 and 2013 market share projections somehow differed 
from the projections created by Apotex between 2002 and 2008. Therefore, I do not find that exclusion on this ground is 
appropriate."
1104,12," Defendants also cite to Legendary Art, LLC v. Godard, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116270, 2012 WL 3550040 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 17, 
2012). Unlike Dr. Singer, the expert in Legendary Art performed absolutely no independent assessment as to the reliability of a 
business projection. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116270, [WL] at *1. Further, the business projection in that case provided the 
backbone for the expert's entire damages assessment, including expected profits and losses, in a market with which the expert 
had no familiarity. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 116270, [WL] at *1, 4. Here, Dr. Singer has testified as an expert in several antitrust 
cases involving the pharmaceutical industry, and he is relying upon Apotex's assessment for one piece of his overall analysis. "
1105,," Indeed, the majority of his economic analysis has not been challenged as unreliable by Defendants. Finally, the court in 
Legendary Art had numerous reasons to question the accuracy of the business records that the expert relied upon. 2012 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 116270, [WL] at *2, 4. Therefore, I find Dr. Singer's analysis to be distinguishable. "
1118,1," Plaintiff did not attach a copy of the subscription agreement to his complaint even though it is referenced and relied on for his 
allegations against Defendants. In their opposition, Defendants attach a copy of the subscription agreement arguing that the 
Court may consider it as it is incorporated by reference in the complaint. In reply, Plaintiff does not oppose the authenticity of the 
Agreement. HN10[
] A court can consider documents that are incorporated by reference but not physically attached to a complaint if they 
are central to the plaintiff's claims and no party questions their authenticity. Marder v. Lopez, 450 F.3d 445, 448 (9th Cir. 2006); 
Sanders v. Brown, 504 F.3d 903, 910 (9th Cir. 2007) (""Review is generally limited to the contents of the complaint, but a court 
can consider a document on which the complaint relies if the document is central to the plaintiff's claim, and no party questions "
1119,," the authenticity of the document."") ""[W]hen [the] plaintiff fails to introduce a pertinent document as part of his pleading, [the] 
defendant may introduce the exhibit as part of his motion attacking the pleading"" Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 453 (9th Cir. 
1994) (citations omitted) (overruled on other grounds by Galbraith v. Cnty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2002)). 
Therefore, the Court considers the subscription agreement that Defendants attach to their motion as it is referenced in the 
complaint, the claims rely on this document and Plaintiff does not dispute the authenticity of the Agreement. "
1120,2," In response, Plaintiff also argues that the safe harbor provision, under 15 U.S.C. § 78u-5(c)(1)(B)(i) does not apply because 
Defendants had actual knowledge that the statements were false. Since Defendants did not raise this provision as part of their 
motion to dismiss, the Court declines to address the issue. "
1121,3," Moreover, HN17[
] certain broken promises of future conduct or performance may be actionable in an action for intentional 
misrepresentation but not negligent misrepresentation. Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 2 Cal. App. 4th 153, 158, 2 
Cal. Rptr. 2d 861 (1991) (trial court properly sustained demurrer on cause of action for negligent misrepresentation); Stockton "
1122,," Mortg., Inc. v. Tope, 233 Cal. App. 4th 437, 458, 183 Cal. Rptr. 3d 186 (2014) (""Although a false promise to perform in the future 
can support an intentional misrepresentation claim, it does not support a claim for negligent misrepresentation."")."
1122,4," In making their arguments, Defendants lump all provisions of the state securities claim alleged in the complaint. "
1124,5," Plaintiff argues the Dean is an officer of SDEP; however, the complaint does not make that assertion. "
1125,**, The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision without oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).

1127,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. 
1142,1," The APA was amended, but for simplicity the Court will refer to the APA and its amendments as the APA. "
1145,2," At oral argument, counsel stated that Fegan's claim that the NBPA has these requirements is based on Article 36 of the CBA 
and on the NBPA Regulations. However, Article 36 does not seem to be in the briefing on these motions and the Regulations — 
counsel didn't point to any particular section — do not appear to contain such requirements. However, for purposes of these 
motions the Court assumes Fegan's claim is true. "
1147,3," Consider these hypotheticals. If an agent declares bankruptcy, certainly the bankruptcy court may distribute the bankruptcy 
estate to the benefit of the agent's creditors even if that would cause the agent to violate NBPA requirements concerning, for 
example, maintaining an office space and other assets. Similarly, if an agent is convicted of a crime, certainly a court may 
sentence him to imprisonment even though such an order would ""interfere"" with his ability to perform as a player agent. "
1150,1," The Court notes that Counter-Defendants' request to stay discovery on Dell's counterclaims is moot because discovery is 
already complete in this case. See Status Conf. Tr. 39, ECF No. 616 (notifying the Court that discovery is closed and the case is 
ready for trial)."
1150,2," Dell alleged antitrust counterclaims against the patent owners and Audio MPEG, who were the original Plaintiffs in this case, 
and additionally joined SISVEL, the parent company of Audio MPEG, as a third-party defendant. Countercl. ¶¶ 28, 44. According 
to Dell, SISVEL administers the MPEG patent pool, with SISVEL alone having ""responsibility for licensing non-U.S. Patents in

infringement occurred within the period prescribed by [statute]."" 137 S. Ct. 954, 967, 197 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2017). "
1152,5," Dell disputes this assertion from Federal Circuit dictum regarding the way courts ""generally"" handle cases with patent claims 
and antitrust counterclaims, arguing that bifurcation is the exception, not the rule. Def.'s Resp. Br. 8, ECF No. 306 (citations 
omitted). Whether bifurcation under such circumstances is the way courts ""generally"" proceed, or is the exception, is immaterial 
to the analysis here as this Court exercises its discretion on the facts of this case, rather than applying a rule of generality or 
exception. See In re Hamilton, 82 F.3d 432 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table decision) (refusing to issue a writ of mandamus to a district 
court to bifurcate the patent and antitrust claims for trial). "
1153,6, Counter-Defendants did not request the Court to bifurcate Count XI of Dell's counterclaim. 
1154,7," See Countercl. ¶ 208 (Count VIII: ""In the event that the Asserted Patents are found valid, infringed, and enforceable, Counter-
Defendants have failed to comply with their RAND obligations.""); ¶ 213 (Count IX: ""In the event that the Asserted Patents are 
found valid, infringed, and enforceable, Dell has been damaged as a result of its reasonable reliance and Counter-Defendants' 
failure to offer a license to the Asserted Patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions.""); ¶ 217 (Count X: 
""In the event that the Asserted Patents are found valid, infringed, and enforceable, Dell has been damaged as a result of its 
reasonable reliance and Counter-Defendants' waiver of its [sic) rights to seek licensing fees beyond those fees that are 
reasonable and non-discriminatory.""). "
1160,*," This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral

388, 403 (3d Cir. 2015), (""We do not believe Actavis's holding can be limited to reverse payments of cash."")."
1198,25," Nor is this remedy speculative or designed to address merely hypothetical behavior, despite the Defendant's arguments to the 
contrary. Indeed, a no-AG settlement was expressly considered by Actavis Holdco as one potential form of payment. See Brau 
Decl. Ex. E at 5 [Doc. 564-8] (presentation discussing ""Watson/Par Options - Potential Settlement Features"" including 
""Agreement by Solvay with Watson to Not Launch an Authorized Generic for Androgel."")."
1198,26," This would not necessarily be a modification of the Teva Injunction. The Teva Injunction applies to Teva and its subsidiaries. 
Actavis Holdco could be sold and cease to be a subsidiary of Teva at any time. Thus, an injunction against Actavis Holdco would 
ensure that Actavis Holdco's anti-competitive conduct would be prevented no matter its ownership."
1198,27," Contrary to the Defendant's contention, an advance notice requirement would not necessarily be redundant. The advance 
notice requirement contained in the Teva Injunction only applies to agreements prohibited by the Teva Injunction. Since no-AG "
1199,," agreements are not prohibited by the Teva Injunction, a new advance notice requirement covering such agreements would not 
be duplicative."
1199,28," As an aside, the Defendant briefly argued that the FTC was inappropriately seeking a declaratory judgment against conduct 
that had happened in the past. Though Actavis Holdco seems to have abandoned this argument in its reply brief, the Court will 
briefly address it here. The FTC is not seeking a declaratory judgment; it is asking the Court to hold that the agreement was 
unlawful, and therefore grant an injunction. The Defendant's argument is inapposite. "

discussed above, Mr. Williams and Ms. Goldstone are not members of the class in this case, have no standing to object, and 
have withdrawn their objections. Additionally, as described below, the named Plaintiffs performed significant work on behalf of 
the class and the requested incentive awards are not disproportionate to the average recovery for class members."

1239,11," The Court calculated this figure by comparing the net settlement fund (from all settlements) with the requested fees, costs, and 
incentive awards divided by the approximate number of class members (($168,950,000 - $36,237,500 - 2,051,740.60 - 
95,495.09 - 300,000) ÷ 10,870 = $11,983.9) with the net settlement fund with the final fees, costs, and incentive awards divided

pending Motions."
1244,3," Section 30-63(c) of the Connecticut General Statutes sets forth the post and hold requirement as follows: For alcoholic liquor other than beer, each manufacturer, [**6]  wholesaler and out-of-state shipper permittee shall post with 
the department, on a monthly basis, the bottle, can and case price of any brand of goods offered for sale in Connecticut, 
which price when so posted shall be the controlling price for such manufacturer, wholesaler or out-of-state permittee for the 
month following such posting. On and after July 1, 2005, for beer, each manufacturer, wholesaler and out-of-state shipper 
permittee shall post with the department, on a monthly basis, the bottle, can and case price, and the price per keg or barrel 
or fractional unit thereof for any brand of goods offered for sale in Connecticut which price when so posted shall be the 
controlling price for such brand of goods offered for sale in this state for the month following such posting. Such "
1245,," manufacturer, wholesaler and out-of-state shipper permittee may also post additional prices for such bottle, can, case, keg 
or barrel or fractional unit thereof for a specified portion of the following month which prices when so posted shall be the 
controlling prices for such bottle, can, case, keg or barrel or fractional unit thereof for such specified portion of the following 
month. Notice of all manufacturer, [**7]  wholesaler and out-of-state shipper permittee prices shall be given to permittee 
purchasers by direct mail, Internet web site or advertising in a trade publication having circulation among the retail 
permittees except a wholesaler permittee may give such notice by hand delivery. Price postings with the department setting 
forth wholesale prices to retailers shall be available for inspection during regular business hours at the offices of the 
department by manufacturers and wholesalers until three o'clock p.m. of the first business day after the last day for posting 
prices. A manufacturer or wholesaler may amend such manufacturer's or wholesaler's posted price for any month to meet a 
lower price posted by another manufacturer or wholesaler with respect to alcoholic liquor bearing the same brand or trade 
name and of like age, vintage, quality and unit container size; provided that any such amended price posting shall be filed 
before three o'clock p.m. of the fourth business day after the last day for posting prices; and provided further such amended 
posting shall not set forth prices lower than those being met. Any manufacturer or wholesaler posting an amended price 
shall, at the time [**8]  of posting, identify in writing the specific posting being met. On and after July 1, 2005, all wholesaler 
postings, other than for beer, for the following month shall be provided to retail permittees not later than the twenty-seventh 
day of the month prior to such posting. All wholesaler postings for beer shall be provided to retail permittees not later than 
the twentieth day of the month prior to such posting. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 30-63(c). Section 30-6-B12 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies further clarifies these 
requirements. See, e.g., Conn. Agencies Regs. § 30-6-B12(d) (allowing amendments to posted price schedules to correct 
""obvious typographical errors"")."
1245,4," Section 30-68m(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes sets forth the mandate that ""[n]o retail permittee shall sell alcoholic 
liquor at a price below his or her cost."" ""Cost"" is in turn defined as follows: (A) for alcoholic liquor other than beer, the posted bottle price from the wholesaler [**9]  plus any charge for shipping or 
delivery to the retail permittee's place of business paid by the retail permittee in addition to the posted price, and (B) for 
beer, the lowest posted price during the month in which the retail permittee is selling plus any charge for shipping or 
delivery to the retail permittee's place of business paid by the retail permittee in addition to the price originally paid by the 
retail permittee . . . . Conn. Gen. Stat. § 30-68m(a)(1)."
1245,5," Section 30-68k of the Connecticut General Statutes provides: No holder of any wholesaler's permit shall ship, transport or deliver within this state or any territory therein or sell or offer for 
sale, to a purchaser holding a permit for the sale of alcoholic liquor for on or off premises consumption, any brand of 
alcoholic liquor, including cordials, . . . at a bottle, can or case price higher than the lowest price at which such item is then 
being sold or offered for sale or shipped, transported or delivered by such wholesaler to any other such purchaser to which 
the wholesaler sells, offers for sale, ships, transports [**10]  or delivers that brand of alcoholic liquor within this state. Similarly, manufacturers and wholesalers are prohibited from: (1) ""discriminat[ing] in any manner in price discounts between one permittee and another on sales or purchases of alcoholic 
liquors bearing the same brand or trade name and of like age, size and 5 quality,"" or (2) ""allow[ing] in any form any 
discount, rebate, free goods, allowance or other inducement for the purpose of making sales or purchases."" "
1246,," Conn. Gen. Stat. § 30-63(b). Section 30-94(b) of the Connecticut General Statutes and section 30-6-A29(a) of the Regulations of Connecticut Agencies 
further limit the ability of participants in Connecticut's liquor market to offer discounts to their customers."
1246,6," The court notes that Total Wine's Complaint includes several allegations that suggest the Connecticut liquor regime is unfair to 
consumers. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 17 (""Under this anticompetitive regime, a retailer like Total Wine & More cannot use its market 
and business efficiencies to reduce the prices offered to consumers.""). Whether or not the statutory and regulatory scheme 
implemented by the State of Connecticut is wise is not a question for this court. Rather, the court can only be asked to determine 
whether the challenged provisions are preempted by federal law. Arguments as to the harm inflicted on consumers by this 
scheme are more appropriately directed to Connecticut's executive and legislative branches of government. "
1247,7," The parties agree that Norman Williams provides at least part of the framework governing the court's analysis. See Mem. of 
Law in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (""State Defs. Mem. in Supp."") (Doc. No. 38-1) at 7; Joint Mem. of Law by Wine & Spirits 
Wholesalers of Conn., Conn. Beer Wholesalers Ass'n, Conn. Rest. Ass'n, & Conn. Package Stores Ass'n in Supp. of their Mot. 
to Dismiss (""Trade Ass'ns Mem. in Supp."") (Doc. No. 66-1) at 10; Brescome Barton, Inc's Mem. of Law in Supp. of its Mot. to 
Dismiss (""Brescome Mem. in Supp."") (Doc. No. 80-1) at 4; Opp'n at 11. "
1248,8," The state defendants—who also ask the court to uphold the challenged provisions—appear to disagree with the trade 
associations' argument that the court can only determine if the challenged statutes are unilateral or hybrid restraints after 
evaluating whether they are per se violations of the Sherman Act. See State Defs. Mem. in Supp. at 4 (""The Challenged 
Provisions are Unilateral Restraints Imposed by the State of Connecticut and May Not be Preempted.""), 7 (""Federal Preemption 
May Not be Founded Upon Conduct Analyzed Under a Rule of Reason Standard.""). "
1250,9," The intervenors suggest that the court ignore 324 Liquor. They argue that ""324 Liquor was, in all respects relevant to this 
motion, abrogated by"" Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 
(2007), because 324 Liquor ""was decided at a time when resale price maintenance was still deemed per se unlawful under the 
Sherman Act . . . ."" Intervenors Reply at 2. Accepting the intervenors' contention that ""Leegin announced that a categorical rule 
of reason applied to all vertical restraints, and expressly overturned Dr. Miles,"" id. at 2, overturning Dr. Miles had no effect on the 
324 Liquor court's determination that the provisions there qualified as hybrid restraints, see 324 Liquor, 479 U.S. at 345 n.8. In 
the wake of the Court's opinion in Fisher—which was less than one year old when 324 Liquor was decided—the Supreme Court 
could not have held the New York provisions at issue in 324 Liquor were inconsistent with the Sherman Act absent a conclusion 
that they constituted a hybrid restraint. See Fisher, 475 U.S. at 267-68 (contrasting hybrid restraints with ""unilateral action 
outside the purview of § 1"" of the Sherman Act). "
1253,10," Total Wine suggests that the Ninth and Fourth Circuits have correctly understood 324 Liquor as mandating a determination 
that post and hold provisions are horizontal restraints that constitute per se violations of the Sherman Act. See Opp'n at 28-29. 
Whatever the relevance of 324 Liquor to other parts of those courts' decisions, neither opinion cited or referenced 324 Liquor in 
determining that post and hold provisions are per se violations of the Sherman Act. See Costco Wholesale Corp., 522 F.3d at 
895-96; TFWS, Inc. v. Schaefer (""TFWS I""), 242 F.3d 198, 209-10 (4th Cir. 2001). As such, Total Wine's suggestion that 324 
Liquor was relevant to these determinations rings hollow."
1253,11," Total Wine is correct, however, that after Battipaglia, ""the Supreme Court has made it clear that an actual 'contract, 
combination or conspiracy' need not be shown for a state statute to be preempted by the Sherman Act."" Freedom Holdings I, 
357 F.3d 205, 223 n.17 (citing 324 Liquor, 479 U.S. at 345-46 n.8). Despite contrary suggestions from the defendants, see, e.g., 
State Defs. Mem. in Supp. at 12 (discussing Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 907, 127 S. Ct. 
2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007)), subsequent Supreme Court decisions do not undermine the Second Circuit's interpretation of 
324 Liquor in Freedom Holdings I. Relatedly, the state defendants contend that Total Wine was required to plead ""enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest 
that an agreement was made,"" in the wake of Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 
(2007). See State Defs. Mem. in Supp. at 14 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). However, Twombly was not a preemption 
case; rather, it involved allegations of wholly private antitrust violations, see Twombly, 550 U.S. at 550-51. As such, Twombly is 
of limited relevance, apart from its elucidation of Rule 8's pleading standard. Total Wine does not dispute that ""plaintiffs [must] 
plausibly plead, and prove, an actual agreement to fix or control prices"" in antitrust cases related to private conduct. Opp'n at 21. 
Freedom Holdings I, by contrast, makes clear that no actual agreement needs to be pleaded or shown for a plaintiff to succeed 
on a preemption claim. See 357 F.3d at 223 n.17. "
1255,12," The intervenors contend that Connecticut's Liquor Control Act is not ""functionally identical"" to the New York scheme analyzed 
in 324 Liquor, because the latter ""allowed wholesalers to manipulate bottle prices untethered to any case prices, effectively 
controlling resale prices for the same month."" See Intervenors Reply at 4 n.3. The portion of 324 Liquor that the intervenors cite 
for this proposition, see id. (citing 324 Liquor, 479 U.S. at 341), offers no support for their characterization of the scheme at issue 
in 324 Liquor. Indeed, it appears that New York's scheme did tether bottle prices to case prices, at least to some extent, see 324 
Liquor Corp., 479 U.S. at 338 (""The [New York State Liquor Authority], however, has promulgated a rule stating that for cases 
containing 48 or fewer bottles, the posted bottle price multiplied by the number of bottles in a case must exceed the posted case 
price by a 'breakage' surcharge of $1.92."" (citations omitted)), much like Connecticut's Liquor Control Act does, see Conn. Gen. 
Stat. § 30-68m(a)(3) (computing bottle price by adding ""an amount that is not less than"" a statutory minimum, to quotient 
determined by dividing case price by number of units or bottles). Therefore, to suggest that Connecticut's statutory regime 
meaningfully differs from New York's scheme analyzed in 324 Liquor on the grounds that bottle prices in Connecticut are 
tethered to case price is not helpful."
1255,13," The final case cited by the trade associations—Little Rock School District v. Borden, Inc., No. LR-76-C-41, 1980 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 17902, 1980 WL 1882 (E.D. Ark. Aug. 5, 1980)—is easily distinguished. First, as was the case with Serlin, the court's 
opinion in Little Rock School District preceded both Fisher and 324 Liquor. Second, like the markup scheme upheld in Flying J, 
the markup challenged in Little Rock School District did not allow ""wholesalers [to] sell to the retailers at one price and force the 
retailers to apply the minimum markup to another,"" Flying J, 621 F.3d at 666. See Little Rock Sch. Dist., 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
17902, 1980 WL 1882, at *1 (""[The] Arkansas statute establishe[d] that it is a criminal violation to price milk at less than cost plus 
four per cent."" (citation omitted)). "
1256,14," Notwithstanding Total Wine's references to manufacturers in Count Two, the minimum retail price provisions operate only in 
the context of the relationships between wholesalers—who set the bottle price—and retailers—who are not permitted to sell 
below ""cost."" See Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 30-68m(a)(1), 30-68m(a)(3), 30-68(b). "
1258,15," Similarly, though the conspiracy in United States v. Apple Inc., 952 F. Supp. 2d 638 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), had horizontal and 
vertical elements, the primary issue was the manner in which the ""vertical actor [was] alleged to have participated in an unlawful 
horizontal agreement."" See 952 F. Supp. 2d at 690-91 (emphasis added). "
1259,16," The section of Midcal to which Total Wine cites offers no support for its assertion: Total Wine points the court to a section of 
the decision discussing Parker immunity, not the distinction between unilateral and hybrid restraints. See Midcal, 445 U.S. at 
105-06."
1259,17," Admittedly, the Ninth Circuit's analysis relied in part on its conclusion that the post and hold provisions were preempted by the 
Sherman Act. See Costco Wholesale Corp., 522 F.3d at 898. Most relevantly here, however, the Ninth Circuit did not view the 
challenged restraints as impossible to separate from one another, as Total Wine suggests the court should consider the 
challenged provisions in this case. "
1265,1," Unless otherwise noted, all references to ""ECF"" are to the electronic docket for Case No. 13-md-2475. ""Landowner ECF"" refers 
to the electronic docket for Case No. 13-cv-7443. "
1267,2," ""Spoofing"" involves bidding on, or offering for sale, a particular cargo with the intent to cancel the bid or offer prior to executing 
the trade. Trader SAC ¶ 70; Landowner SAC ¶ 236."
1267,3," Following stipulations by all parties, the Trader Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint on February 27, 2015, ECF No. 
308 (""Trader SAC""), and the Landowner Plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint on April 30, 2015, Landowner ECF No. 96 
(""Landowner SAC""). The Second Amended Complaints substituted certain defendants but did not affect any of the substantive 
claims."
1267,4," Defendants BP America Inc., BP Corporation North America Inc., Mercuria Energy Trading Inc., Shell Trading US Company, 
Trafigura Beheer B.V., Vitol S.A., and Vitol Inc. did not join in either of the motions to dismiss the Landowner Plaintiff's 
Complaint. See Defs.' Extraterritorial Memo. at n.2; Defs.' Memo. at n. 1. "
1270,5," Assuming that the relevant transactions are those occurring on the commodities exchanges, no one disputes that NYMEX is a 
""domestic exchange"" within the meaning of Morrison. The parties disagree, however, on the status of ICE Futures Europe. The 
Trader Plaintiffs argue that ICE Futures Europe is a ""de facto domestic exchange."" Trader Extraterritoriality Memo. 6-9. They 
also argue that activity on ICE Futures Europe constitutes domestic transactions, as further defined by Absolute Activist, on the 
basis of the domestic location of ICE Futures Europe's servers, where buy and sell orders are matched. Id. at 9-12 (citing Trader 
SAC ¶¶ 159-60). With respect to the first argument, Defendants assert that ICE Futures Europe is not a registered exchange to 
which the CEA anti-manipulation rules apply. Defs.' Extraterritoriality Reply at 7. Defendants also contend that transactions on 
ICE Futures Europe are not domestic transactions because the two formulations the Court of Appeals provided in Absolute 
Activist apply only to ""off exchange"" transactions. Id. at 8. Although the facts of Absolute Activist arose in the context of a private 
investment transaction, nothing in that decision suggests that its holding is limited to such transactions. Rather, the decision 
provides a framework for determining when ""the purchase or sale of a security that is not listed on a domestic exchange should 
be considered 'domestic' within the meaning of Morrison."" 677 F.3d at 66-67. Accordingly, its guidance is applicable to any 
transaction not on a domestic exchange, whether because the transaction is a private one or because the exchange on which 
the transaction occurred is not a domestic one. See, e.g., City of Pontiac Policemen's & Firemen's Ret. Sys. v. UBS AG, 752 
F.3d 173, 181 (2d Cir. 2014) (applying Absolute Activist test to securities traded on foreign exchange); In re Foreign Exch. 
Benchmark Rates Antitrust Litig., No. 13-cv-07789 (LGS), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128237, 2016 WL 5108131, at *26-27 
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2016) (same, in CEA claim) (""FOREX""). "
1273,6," The Landowner Plaintiff expressly adopted the arguments asserted by the Trader Plaintiffs in the supplemental letters. ECF No. 
414 (Landowner Plaintiff's letter dated Oct. 19, 2016)."
1273,7," The Landowner Plaintiff does not allege that Defendants participated in or intended to restrain trade in the U.S. crude oil 
market, only that Defendants' conduct led to suppressed prices for WTI and LLS. See, e.g., Landowner SAC ¶¶ 3-4. As a result, 
the Landowner Plaintiff does not suggest any purported motivation by Defendants to influence U.S. crude oil prices."
1273,8," In re Commodity Exchange, Inc. Gold Futures and Options Trading Litig., 213 F. Supp. 3d 631, 2016 WL 5794776 (S.D.N.Y. 
2016) (""Gold"") and In re London Silver Fixing, Ltd., Antitrust Litig., 213 F. Supp. 3d 530, 2016 WL 5794777 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) 
(""Silver"") run somewhat counter to this conclusion. In the Gold and Silver cases, the district court held that harm to plaintiffs who 
traded gold, silver, and their derivatives was inextricably intertwined with the harm defendants intended to cause. In reaching this 
holding, the court expressed concern about defining the relevant market as the ""Fixing,"" the process by which defendants set the 
benchmark prices for gold and silver, because it is ""an artificially-constructed private 'auction' that was instituted for the sole 
purpose of allowing the Fixing Banks to set a market-wide benchmark."" Gold, 213 F. Supp. 3d 631, 2016 WL 5794776 at *10; 
accord Silver, 213 F. Supp. 3d 530, 2016 WL 5794777, at *9. Defining the restrained market in this way would leave only the 
manipulating entities with standing to sue, an ""absurd"" result. Id. However, instead of defining the relevant market as those that 
incorporated the benchmark set at the Fixing, the district court turned to the ""inextricably intertwined"" test. "
1274,9," To the extent that this issue did not form the sole basis of the district court's decision, the Court respectfully disagrees with the 
analysis. In an alternative holding, the district court relied on the Court of Appeals' rejection of the downstream purchasers' 
theory that defendants had conspired to manipulate the regional premium. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138437, 2016 WL 5818585, at 
*8. However, even if the downstream purchasers proved that defendants intended to manipulate the regional premium, that 
regional premium was not directly incorporated into the price those plaintiffs paid for aluminum products. By contrast, the direct 
aluminum purchasers alleged that the increased regional premium was an explicit component of the price they paid. See 833 
F.3d at 155. "
1275,10," The Trader SAC does not specify pursuant to which state's common law the Trader Plaintiffs bring their unjust enrichment 
claim. Trader SAC ¶¶ 590-98. In briefing the motions to dismiss, the parties each assume New York law applies. "
1276,11," Some courts have addressed the issue of standing under each state's laws as a threshold question regardless of the plaintiff's 
status as the representative of a putative class. See, e.g., In re HSBC BANK, USA, NA., Debit Card Overdraft Fee Litig., 1 F. 
Supp. 3d 34, 48-50 (E.D.N.Y 2014); Simington v. Lease Fin. Grp., LLC, No. 10-cv-6052 (KBF), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25671, 
2012 WL 651130, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2012). Other courts have held that a named plaintiff need only have standing to bring 
a claim under the statute applicable to his own claim because the named plaintiff is serving as a representative for those who 
may have claims under other states' statutes. See, e.g., Blessing v. Sirius X V I Radio Inc., 756 F. Supp. 2d 445, 450-52 
(S.D.N.Y. 2010); In re Bayer Corp. Combination Aspirin Prod. Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig., 701 F. Supp. 2d 356, 376-77 
(E.D.N.Y. 2010)."
1276,12," In the SAC, the Landowner Plaintiff is unclear as to whether he is seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, or both, under 
state law. See SAC ¶¶ 344, XI.B (Prayer for Relief). If the Landowner Plaintiff is seeking injunctive relief for the alleged violation 
of Louisiana's antitrust law, that provision also mirrors the parallel portion of the Clayton Act. Louisiana law provides that ""[a]ny 
person may sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or 
damage by a violation of the provisions of this Part under the rules governing such proceedings."" La. Stat. Ann. § 51:129. The 
Clayton Act similarly provides that ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive 
relief, in any court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of 
the antitrust laws . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. In any event, a plaintiff is required to demonstrate antitrust injury whether seeking "
1277,," injunctive or monetary relief. Paycom Billing Servs. v. MasterCard Int'l, Inc., 467 F.3d 283, 290 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing Cargill, Inc. 
v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 110-11, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 & nn.5-6 (1986))."
1277,13," The Landowner Plaintiff also is unclear about the relief sought in connection with his unfair trade practices claim. SAC ¶¶ 314, 
XI.B (Prayer for Relief). Under LUTPA, injunctive relief is limited to actions brought by the Louisiana State Attorney General. See 
La. Stat. Ann. § 51:1407. "

1321,1," Unless otherwise noted, the facts are taken from the Second Amended Complaint (""SAC""), Dkt. No. 121, and are accepted as 
true for the purposes of this Rule 12(b)(6) motion. See, e.g., Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. 2002). 
However, ""[t]he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal 
conclusions."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "
1322,2," Ms. Levy does not provide specific dates for her purchase of platinum contracts, but on page 130 of her 142-page complaint 
notes that she purchased NYMEX Platinum Contracts ""in the winter and spring of 2008."" SAC ¶ 617."
1322,3," The Court takes judicial notice of the docket sheet and operative complaint in Levy v. Joseph Welsh et al., 12-cv-2056 
(E.D.N.Y.), 13-cv-01858 (S.D.N.Y.) and id. Dkt. No. 63 (""2012 Am. Compl.""). The Second Circuit has explained that the harm in 
considering material extraneous to the complaint on a motion to dismiss is that the plaintiff does not have ""notice that the 
material may be considered."" See Mangiafico v. Blumenthal, 471 F.3d 391, 397 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing Chambers v. Time Warner, 
Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002)) (holding that ""docket sheets are public records of which the court could take judicial 
notice""). Because Ms. Levy herself filed the complaint in the Eastern District of New York in 2012 and litigated the case through 
its conclusion, and because the existence of this previous action was raised in both Defendants' motion to dismiss and Plaintiff's 
opposition to that motion, there is no question that she had notice of these materials. The Court does not, however, take judicial 
notice of the truth of the matters asserted in the 2012 Amended Complaint. "
1327,4," As noted above, there are significant issues regarding the plausibility of many of Ms. Levy's assertions—including that she, as 
the holder of approximately $280,000 in leveraged platinum options, was a competitor of the LPPFC."
1327,5," In her opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss, Plaintiff argues that she is ""automatically entitled to a tolling of the statute of 
limitations at this stage of the litigation, since she filed while the Class Action is still pending."" Pl's Opp'n at 3. The Supreme 
Court has held that, in the context of an individual plaintiff who files a suit separately from a pending class action, ""the 
commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who 
would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action."" Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.S. 
345, 353-54, 103 S. Ct. 2392, 76 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1983) (quoting American Pipe & Const. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 554, 94 S. 
Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974)); see also In re WorldCom Sec. Litig., 496 F.3d 245, 254-55 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding that 
American Pipe tolling applies to class members who file individual suits before class certification is resolved). This tolling 
doctrine is inapplicable in this case, however, because Plaintiff's claims accrued—and expired—long before the class action 
litigation was commenced. Thus to the extent Plaintiff seeks tolling of her statutes of limitations, she seeks tolling for the seven 
years between her injury and filing of the SAC in September 2015. "
1332,1," Because the Court has previously described plaintiffs' allegations in detail, it refers the reader to those descriptions. See 
McCormick, 217 F. Supp. 3d at 130-31; March 21 Mem. Op. at 2-3. "
1333,2," McCormick's motion is entitled ""Motion to Dismiss Consumer Plaintiffs' Second Amended Consolidated Class Action 
Complaint,"" and it states that McCormick ""renews by reference the arguments set forth as to Plaintiffs' state law claims in 
McCormick's initial Motion to Dismiss."" (McCormick Mot. at 1-2.) The Court has previously held that those counts state a claim, 
see McCormick, 217 F. Supp 3d 124, so it will deny the portion of McCormick's motion that seeks dismissal of plaintiffs' state law 
claims. "
1337,3, The Court need not reach defendants' alternative challenges to plaintiffs' relevant market allegations and standing. 
1339,1," The class is defined as ""persons who received, or are entitled to receive, proceeds of an Estate that paid fees to BMS, 
excluding (a) trustees who have a contract with BMS, (b) creditors who have received 100% of their claim, (c) for the purposes "
1340,," of the second claim only, persons not entitled to assert a claim under the state statute identified in that claim, and (d) the judicial 
officers adjudicating the action and any member of their immediate families."" (Dkt. 1 ¶ 93.)"
1340,2, The court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).
1340,3," Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are taken from plaintiff's complaint and are presumed true for the purpose of 
resolving the pending motion. Active Disposal, Inc. v. City of Darien, 635 F.3d 883, 886 (7th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted)."
1340,4, The court infers that the interest paid to an estate was less than what would be paid to a normal commercial client.
1340,5, The complaint includes additional allegations that are not pertinent to the disposition of the motion. 
1341,6," McGarry's argument that Illinois Brick is no longer valid law goes nowhere. Until and unless the Supreme Court overrules 
Illinois Brick, it is binding on the court. See Bosse v. Oklahoma, 580 U.S.    , 137 S. Ct. 1, 2, 196 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2016) (""Our 
decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised 
doubts about their continuing vitality."")"
1341,7," McGarry alleges that Crane entered into a contract with BMS, but because the estate paid for the services, it is the direct 
purchaser. BMS argues that the direct purchaser is either the partner bank or the trustee, but for purposes of this motion, the 
court assumes that McGarry is correct. "
1342,8," Additionally, trying to determine the amount of damages ""passed on"" by the Integrated estate would be complicated by having 
to determine what percentage of the overcharge affected the trustee, whose compensation is tied to the amount of proceeds 
ultimately disbursed. See 11 U.S.C. § 326(a). "
1349,1," In contrast, as the Ninth Circuit has noted, ""the proper definition of 'unfair' conduct against consumers 'is currently in flux' 
among California courts."" Davis v. HSBC Bank, 691 F.3d 1152, 1169 (9th Cir. 2012). "
1356,1," To the extent that ""Jeanette Haddad, Broker"" is distinct from Jeanette Haddad, those distinctions are not material to our 
resolution of the claims on appeal."
1356,2," When formed, Reserve Realty was named UC Properties, LLC (UC Properties). On July 22, 2004, Scalzo filed articles of 
amendment, changing the name of the company from UC Properties to Reserve Realty."
1356,3, The Kuehner and Haddad families have been personal friends and business associates since the late 1970s.
1356,4," The plaintiffs moved to add Scalzo Realty as a necessary party to the action. The trial court granted the motion, ordering that 
the complaint be amended to state facts showing the interest of Scalzo Realty in the action and that Scalzo Realty appear as a 
defendant. Thereafter, Scalzo Realty was defaulted for failure to plead. Subsequently, the plaintiffs withdrew this action as to 
Scalzo Realty. "
1357,5, Reserve Realty was formed by Jeanette Haddad and Scalzo to market and sell the Reserve as it became subdivided.
1357,6," Pursuant to paragraph twelve of the purchase and sale agreement for parcel 15, titled conditions of purchase, Woodland was 
required to obtain government approval for the development of a conference center and to provide Windemere with a site plan 
sketch for an office building so that Windemere could petition for a change in the master plan to allow for the construction of a 
large office space."
1357,7," Theodore Haddad, Jr., acted on behalf of Jeanette Haddad."
1357,8," The trial court determined that it was not clear precisely how the final, fully-executed hard copies of the agreements came to be 
executed by Jeanette Haddad. Although Theodore Haddad, Jr., testified that Jeanette Haddad was faxed the agreements on 
September 10, 2003, and she subsequently returned them with her signature via fax on the same day, the trial court did not find 
his testimony entirely credible. The trial court found, however, that Carl Kuehner, Jr., executed the agreements on behalf of both 
BLT and Windemere with the intent that the defendants be legally bound."
1357,9," In the buyer's agreement, the defendants appointed Scalzo Realty, UC Properties, and Jeanette Haddad as their exclusive 
agents to assist in the purchase of parcel 13 and parcel 15."
1357,10, The consent agreements did not address the defendants' obligation to use the plaintiffs' brokerage services.
1357,11," In the exclusive right to sell—listing agreement for parcel 13, BLT granted Jeanette Haddad and Scalzo Realty the exclusive 
right to sell and/or lease parcel 13. "
1358,12," In the exclusive right to sell/lease—listing agreement for parcel 13, BLT granted UC Properties, Scalzo Realty, and Jeanette 
Haddad the exclusive right to sell and/or lease parcel 13 or any portion of parcel 13."
1358,13," In the exclusive right to sell/lease listing agreement for parcel 15, Windemere granted UC Properties, Scalzo Realty, and 
Jeanette Haddad the exclusive right to sell and/or lease parcel 15 or any portion of parcel 15."
1358,14," In the exclusive right to sell—listing agreement for parcel 15, Windemere granted Jeanette Haddad and Scalzo Realty the 
exclusive right to sell and/or lease parcel 15."
1358,15," Subsequently, on May 6, 2014, the plaintiffs commenced two actions seeking to foreclose liens that they had recorded as to 
parcel 13 and parcel 15 (foreclosure actions). On September 28, 2015, the parties filed a stipulation in each of the foreclosure 
actions, stipulating that the memorandum of decision in the present action required the conclusion that the plaintiffs could not 
establish probable cause to sustain the validity of the liens, as required by General Statutes § 20-325e. The parties, therefore, 
stipulated that judgment be rendered against the plaintiffs in the foreclosure actions, but that all appellate rights be reserved. The 
plaintiffs also have appealed from the judgments ordering the discharge of the liens. See Reserve Realty, LLC v. BLT Reserve, 
LLC, 174 Conn. App. 150, 165 A.3d 159, 2017 Conn. App. LEXIS 245 (2017); Reserve Realty, LLC v. Windemere Reserve, 
LLC, 174 Conn. App. 152, 165 A.3d 160, 2017 Conn. App. LEXIS 244 (2017). "
1359,16," The plaintiffs further argued that the defendants' illegal tying arrangement claim must fail because it did not pass the rule of 
reason test. As subsequently discussed in this opinion, tying arrangements, due to their manifestly anticompetitive nature, fall 
under the per se test, not the rule of reason test."
1359,17," General Statutes § 35-29 provides in relevant part: ""Every lease, sale or contract for the furnishing of services or for the sale of 
commodities . . . on the condition or understanding that the lessee or purchaser shall not deal in the services or the commodities 
of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, shall be unlawful where the effect of such lease or sale or contract for sale 
or such condition or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any part of trade 
or commerce and where such goods or services are for the use, consumption or resale in this state."""
1359,18," General Statutes § 35-44b provides: ""It is the intent of the General Assembly that in construing sections 35-24 to 35-46, 
inclusive, the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."""
1359,19," But see Illinois Tool Works, Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 31, 43-45, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006) 
(rejecting dicta from Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 regarding presumption that patents afforded sufficient market power 
to restrain competition in tied market). "
1360,20," Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14 (2012), provides in relevant part: ""It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in 
commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or contract for the sale of . . . commodities . . . for use, 
consumption, or resale within the United States . . . or fix a price charged therefor, or discount from, or rebate upon, such price, 
on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall not use or deal in the . . . commodities 
of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, 
agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."" "
1361,21," ""Although both tests must be met to constitute a violation of § 1 of the Sherman [Antitrust Act 15 U.S.C § 1], under § 3 of the 
Clayton Antitrust Act; 15 U.S.C. § 14; a [tying arrangement] is per se illegal if either condition is met. Times-Picayune Publishing 
Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 608, 609, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 [(1953)]; Moore v. Jas. H. Matthews & Co., 550 F.2d 
1207, 1214 (9th Cir. [1977]); Advance Business Systems & Supply Co. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55, 61-62 (4th Cir. [1969]), cert. 
denied, 397 U.S. 920, 90 S. Ct. 928, 25 L. Ed. 2d 101 [(1970)]; ILC Peripherals Leasing Corp. v. International Business 
Machines Corp., 448 F. Supp. 228, 230 (N.D. Cal. [1978]). Since General Statutes § 35-29 is patterned after § 3 of the Clayton 
[Antitrust] [A]ct; 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1971 Sess., p. 4182 (remarks of Rep. David H. Neiditz); Brodigan, `The Connecticut 
Antitrust Act,' 47 Conn. B.J. 12, 15 (1973); and specifically includes the provision of services within its ambit, we believe that it is 
appropriate to adopt the Clayton [Antitrust] [A]ct test in determining whether a violation of § 35-29 has occurred. Thus, the 
declaration of covenants and restrictions is unlawful per se if either condition under Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. United States, 
supra, [356 U.S.] 6, is met; that is, if (1) the party has sufficient economic power in the tying product, or (2) a not insubstantial 
amount of commerce is affected."" (Footnotes omitted.) State v. Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., supra, 181 Conn. 661-62."
1361,22," The plaintiffs claim that, even if this court is bound by Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., the present action is distinguishable. Specifically, 
the plaintiffs argue that: (1) the covenants in Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., bound all subsequent purchasers, whereas in the present 
case only Windemere and the first purchasers after BLT are bound; (2) the owner in Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., was also the broker, 
and therefore had an economic interest in both the tying product and the tied product; (3) the purchasers in Hossan-Maxwell, 
Inc., had no power to negotiate, whereas in the present case the defendants freely entered into the listing agreements after 
negotiations; and (4) the illegal clauses in the present case are part of otherwise valid agreements, and therefore the rule of 
reason test, not the per se test, should apply. For the reasons discussed subsequently in this opinion, we conclude that Hossan-
Maxwell, [***21]  Inc., is analogous to the present case and, therefore, we are not persuaded by the plaintiffs' argument."
1361,23," ""In Connecticut, the uniqueness and special characteristics of a particular plot of land have long been recognized."" State v. 
Hossan-Maxwell, Inc., supra, 181 Conn. 665, citing Anderson v. Yaworski, 120 Conn. 390, 395, 399, 181 A. 205 (1935). "
1363,24," The plaintiffs failed to raise the issue as to a ""not insubstantial"" amount of commerce test in their main brief. Because this is an 
alternative test to finding a tying arrangement and it was a means by which the trial court found an illegal tying arrangement, 
however, we still address whether a ""not insubstantial"" amount of commerce was affected. In addition, the defendants argued in 
their briefs that a ""not insubstantial"" amount of commerce was foreclosed in the tied market for brokerage services, and the 
plaintiffs addressed the issue in their reply brief."
1363,25," The total amount foreclosed is only a portion of the property of the Reserve being sold by Woodland with the tied brokerage 
services. See Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., supra, 394 U.S. 502 (""[f]or purposes of determining whether 
the amount of commerce foreclosed is too insubstantial to warrant prohibition of the practice . . . the relevant figure is the total 
volume of sales held [***27]  by the sales policy under challenge, not the portion of [the] total accounted for by the particular 
plaintiff who brings suit""). The record indicates that additional buyers of the Reserve parcels included White Peterman for 
$13,931,000, with Jeanette Haddad and Scalzo Realty receiving a 3 percent commission, and WCI for approximately $44 
million, with Jeanette Haddad and Scalzo Realty receiving a 3 percent commission. "
1366,1, All further statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code unless otherwise indicated.
1366,2," The parties refer to such interfacility transportation as ""nonemergency"" ambulance transportation and distinguish it from 911-
originated, ""emergency"" transportation. Interfacility transportation typically originates at one health care facility—such as a 
nursing home or hospital—and transports the patient to another. "
1367,3," The full text of the ordinance states: ""It shall be unlawful for any person, either as owner, agent or otherwise, to operate,

1373,2," Long before the Trulia trend began, Judge Baird of our adjoining circuit perceived the same underlying issue, declining to 
approve a similar settlement in Frachter v. Florida Progress Corp., 99-6167CI-20, 2002 WL 1558220, at *9 (Fla. Cir. Ct. Mar. 20,

1374,5, The same criteria had earlier appeared in a circuit court opinion: 
1375,," (1) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (2) the reaction of the class to the settlement; (3) the stage of the

(""Motions to dismiss are looked on with disfavor by the court, and are granted sparingly and with care""). "
1381,1," As I noted in an earlier opinion, In re Namenda Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litigation, No. 15 Civ. 7488, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
76675, 2017 WL 2226591, at *1 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2017), the Honorable Colleen McMahon, C.J., addressed Forest's 
motions to dismiss in three coordinated cases in Sergeants Benevolent Association Health & Welfare Fund v. Actavis, PLC 
(""Namenda III""), Nos. 15 Civ. 6549, 15 Civ. 7488, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128349, 2016 WL 4992690 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 13, 2016). 
Further background can be found in that opinion, Judge McMahon's opinion on competing partial summary judgment motions, In 
re Namenda Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litigation (""Namenda IV""), No. 15 Civ. 7488, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83446 (S.D.N.Y. May 
23, 2017), and in decisions in a related 2014 case brought by the State of New York against Actavis and Forest, New York v. 
Actavis, PLC (""Namenda I""), No. 14 Civ. 7473, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172918, 2014 WL 7015198 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2014), and 
New York ex rel. Schneiderman v. Actavis PLC (""Namenda II""), 787 F.3d 638 (2d Cir. 2015). "
1382,2," A ""cost-plus"" contract has been defined as an agreement in which the ""customer is committed to buying a fixed quantity 
regardless of price,"" thus insulating the upstream purchaser ""from any decrease in its sales as a result of attempting to pass on 
the overcharge,"" Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 736, or an agreement by an indirect purchaser ""to purchase a fixed quantity, paying 
the direct purchaser's costs plus a predetermined additional fee,"" Simon v. KeySpan Corp., 694 F.3d 196, 202 (2d Cir. 2012). "
1383,3," The plaintiffs further contend that certain documents are beyond the scope of the requests for production at issue. (Pl. Memo. 
at 5, 12, 16). Because I find that Forest has not established that the information is relevant, I do not address this argument. "
1384,4," As I understand it, if the plaintiffs establish that injury was caused by the hard switch, that injury will necessarily be an antitrust 
injury. See, e.g., Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 342, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) 
(""[The antitrust injury requirement] ensures that the harm claimed by the plaintiff corresponds to the rationale for finding a 
violation of the antitrust laws in the first place, and it prevents losses that stem from competition from supporting suits by private 
plaintiffs for either damages or equitable relief.""). "
1385,5," I make a distinction here between general sales data and information related to plaintiffs' ""pricing for sales of pharmaceuticals 
to their customers,"" which appears to be connected primarily with Forest's argument about the ""cost-plus exception"" (Def. 
Memo. at 11), and is discussed below. "
1386,6," The magistrate judge held: The downstream price charged throughout the chain of distribution is irrelevant to plaintiffs' alleged damage for 
overcharges. The relevant inquiry is whether, in the unique market of pharmaceutical drugs, defendant's alleged ""product 
hopping"" caused plaintiffs to pay more than they would have paid absent any unlawful conduct to suppress competition. 
Evidence of discounts, coupons, contracts, margins, and rebates involving downstream sales made after the 
wholesalers' [*20]  purchase would have no tendency to make a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would 
be without the evidence. In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride and Nalaxone) Antitrust Litigation, No. 13-MD-2445, slip op., ¶ 3 (E.D. Pa. Feb.

1397,1," Because Class B and Class C waste are subject to largely identical disposal requirements, the term ""Class B/C"" is used herein 
to refer collectively to Class B and Class C waste. "
1398,2," The relevant states are the following 36 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico: Alabama; Arizona; Arkansas; 
California; Delaware; Florida; Georgia; Illinois; Indiana; Iowa; Kansas; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; Massachusetts; 
Michigan; Minnesota; Mississippi; Missouri; Nebraska; New Hampshire; New York; North Carolina; North Dakota; Ohio; 
Oklahoma; Pennsylvania; Rhode Island; South Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; Vermont; Virginia; West Virginia; and Wisconsin."
1398,3," The radioactive concentration of the waste that can be accepted at each facility is reported in its waste acceptance criteria. (D.I. 
211 at 75:3-15; D.I. 212 at 469:1-7; D.I. 214 at 797:21-798:9)"
1398,4," Because processing is not a functional substitute for disposal, the court need not determine if the ability of nuclear power plants 
to set up in-house down-blending is more than theoretical, as it appears to be. (D.I. 215 at 1027:3-1028:14; Id. at 1051:16-
1052:1; D.I. 220 at 2141:2-10; see also D.I. 215 at 1052:2-5 (admitting that even if a nuclear power plant could set up an internal 
operation for down-blending resins, ""they would still have to send the down-blended material for disposal at a disposal facility""))"
1398,5," Sealed sources, which are most often employed in hospitals and universities, are small amounts of highly concentrated 
radioactive material sealed in a capsule, and down-blending risks rupturing the capsule. (D.I. 215 at 1069:1-1070:5)"
1398,6," Energy Solutions has described down-blending as a ""process by which high activity waste that would otherwise be classified as 
Class B and C waste can be blended with lower-activity waste resulting in a homogenous Class A waste package, which is less 
expensive to dispose of."" (PTX 344 at -122) "
1400,7," For the same reasons, the court finds that SAFSTOR is not an alternative to disposal, because SAFSTOR, like storage, is 
simply an interim function before active decommissioning which, in the end, terminates the nuclear power plant's operating 
license, thereby ending its responsibility for the LLRW. "
1401,8," Apparently, some de minimis amount of residue remains after down-blending that must be disposed of in a Class B/C facility. 
Energy Solutions does not market this fact to customers or potential customers, instead claiming that all LLRW from Erwin is 
disposed at Clive. (See D.I. 211 at 139:6-15; PTX 180 (claiming ability to dispose of Class A, B, and C due to down-blending 
capabilities); PTX 185 at -087 (stating that all resins from Erwin goes to Clive)) Because Energy Solutions has raised this "
1402,," technicality now as a litigation tactic, the court finds that it does not reflect the commercial realities of what customers 
understand to be their disposal options."
1402,9," Energy Solutions is clearly in a different positon than other processors. It has executed exclusivity agreements with those 
processors requiring all of the LLRW they handle to be sent to Clive, instead of WCS, for disposal. (PTX 55 (discussing the ""last 
processor we have to tie-up to ensure all processed [low-level waste] comes to Clive""); PTX 441 at -142 (reporting that Energy 
Solutions ""has negotiated exclusive contracts with two other processors ... in an effort to keep WCS from promoting the 'exempt' 
waste process through their facilities""))"
1402,10, Sempra Safe is the former name of Erwin's down-blending facilities. (D.I. 211 at 223:8-18) 
1405,11," Given that neither Valhi nor WCS have taken any steps, even preliminary ones, to close WCS and actually made several 
contrary representations to their regulators, their investors, and this courtroom, the court gives no weight to the announcement 
by Valhi's CEO at trial that Valhi will close WCS if the merger does not go through. (D.I. 217 at 1580:17-24 (announcement by 
Valhi CEO on May 2, 2017); D.I. 215 at 1209:18-24 (statement by WCS CEO on April 28. 2017 that ""no decision has been 
made"" to close if the merger does not occur): DTX 395 (Valhi filing with the SEC six weeks before trial stating that disposal of 
LLRW is ""a key element of our long term strategy"")) "
1406,12, The NRC estimates that the cost to review the application would be $7.5 million (Id. at -637) 
1407,13," As used in § 6.05, the term ""Alternative Transaction"" means any direct or indirect sale of the Company or ten percent (10%) or 
more of the Equity Securities or assets of the Company. (Id.)"
1407,14," Under Delaware law, officers and directors of a wholly-owned subsidiary, so long as it is solvent, owe fiduciary duties to the 
corporate parent and its ultimate owners, which here would be a family trust established for the benefit of Lisa K. Simmons and 
Serena Simmons Connelly and their children. In re Tropicana Entm't, LLC, 520 B.R. 455, 471 (Bankr. D. Del. 2014) (citing 
Trenwick America Litig. Trust v. Ernst & Young, L.L.P., 906 A.2d 168, 200 (Del. Ch. 2006)). "
1408,15," Even though BSFR serves only the operational market (due to lack of rail access) and US Ecology serves only the 
decommissioning market (due to the time lag from the exemption process), both players have a market share of [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT] or less, meaning any combination of these two players into one market for disposal of lower-
activity LLRW will have a minimal impact on the computation of market shares and market concentration. See, e.g., Anthem, 
2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23613, 2017 WL 685563, at *20 (combining two different products in the same market did not invalidate 
that market, particularly where it had 'little bearing on the market share calculations""). "
1411,16," Dr. Mayo calculated decommissioning market shares using two different methods: 2016 revenue received and 2016 RFPs 
awarded. (D.l. 213 at 603:18-604:14). Normally market shares are calculated using annual sales. See, e.g., United States v. 
Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270, 272, 86 S. Ct. 1478, 16 L. Ed. 2d 555 (1966). Dr. Mayo presented the RFP calculation as an 
alternative, because Section 7 ""looks not merely to the actual present effect of a merger but instead to its effect upon future 
competition."" Id. at 277. REPs, which reflect anticipated revenue, can indicate future competition. By this measurement, 
however, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] and post-merger Energy Solutions would have a monopoly—a result that does 
not best reflect market realities. Accordingly, the court is relying on the share calculations using revenue received. "
1412,17," Defendants did not present any analysis showing that the market shares would change if the court excluded ""true B/C"" and 
""true A"" as they suggested. Dr. Mayo did perform this analysis and reached ""exactly the same conclusion,"" a ""presumption of 
anticompetitive harm."" (D.I. 213 at 611:6-613:8)"
1412,18," For example, defendants have not shown that prices actually changed in response to a threat of storage. Moreover, 
defendants have not shown how storage can constrain anti-competitive pricing when generators must dispose of the stored 
waste eventually. "
1413,19," Conversely, HN17[
] if the government demonstrates high barriers to entry, that fact ""further enhance[s]"" any proof of ""the 
anticompetitive effect of the merger."" Heinz, 246 F.3d at 717; see also Univ. Health, Inc., 938 F.2d at 1220 (stating that the 
government can bolster its prima facie case, as it did here, ""with evidence that substantial barriers to entry into the relevant 
market exist""). "
1414,20," The court does not mean to suggest that the evidence is in equipoise; only that it would require careful and time intensive 
consideration when the court must be mindful of the fact that defendants' merger agreement will terminate by its own terms if the 
merger is not consummated by July 31, 2017. (DTX 322 at -263) "

exception of certain municipal matters, were handled in the District Court of the Virgin Islands. Significant jurisdictional changes 
evolved from 1917 to 1954. In 1936, Congress promulgated the original Organic Act of 1936, which was signed into law by 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 22, 1936. It [**61] was this Organic Act of 1936 that inter alia created the District Court 
of the Virgin Islands. Later, an amended Organic Act was enacted on July 22, 1954, now referred to as the Revised Organic Act 
of 1954. The 1984 comprehensive amendments to the Revised Organic Act of 1954, drastically changed the landscape of the 
judicial system in the Virgin Islands of the United States. The historic amendments gave the local legislature the ability to confer 
greater autonomy by statute to the local courts, which it chose to do, divesting the ”District Court“ of most of its jurisdiction over 
”local“ matters. By 1991, the Territorial Court assumed full jurisdiction over all local civil actions pursuant to § 21 of the Revised 
Organic Act, as amended, and local Act No. 5594, 4 V.I. Code Ann. § 76(a) (Bill No. 18-0362). Three years later, the Territorial

1428,1," On January 5, 2017, the parties appeared before the Court for a settlement conference and were directed to discuss a 
settlement. (ECF No. 23.) The parties did not reach a settlement. "
1430,2," The Court reviewed and considered the parties' letters to the Court regarding Inserra Supermarkets, Inc. v. Stop & Shop 
Supermarket, Co., LLC, 240 F. Supp. 3d 299, 2017 WL 773876 (D.N.J. 2017) and Sumas v. Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v.

2017). (ECF Nos. 25-27.) The Court finds the cases instructive but not dispositive, particularly in light of the fact-intensive nature 
of an antitrust claim. See Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 318 (3d Cir. 2007)."
1430,3," Plaintiffs assert claims for monopolization, attempted monopolization, and conspiracy to monopolize pursuant to Section 2 of 
the Sherman Act in the First Count of the Complaint. (ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 114-25.) As the elements differ for each claim, the Court will 
analyze them separately even though they were pled together as a single count. "
1448,1," Ferrellgas does business as ""Blue Rhino."" "
1450,2," Because continued sales at supracompetitive prices are overt acts under the continuing violations theory, this court need not 
address Plaintiffs' allegations that Defendants' conspiratorial communications about pricing and fill levels were additional overt 
acts sufficient to invoke the theory. "
1456,3," Judge Posner has described dicta as ""any statement made by a court for use in argument, illustration, analogy or suggestion. It 
is a remark, an aside, concerning some rule of law or legal proposition that is not necessarily essential to the decision and lacks 
the authority of adjudication."" United States v. Crawley, 837 F.2d 291, 292 (7th Cir. 1988) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Because I believe the discussion of antitrust in Klehr falls under the category of dicta, I do not believe it deserves the lofty 
position of authority afforded to it by the majority's opinion. But I will proceed in my analysis as if the language is binding 
authority on us. "
1457,4," There is but one possible exception: paragraph 13, which alleges that ""during calls and meetings with AmeriGas executives 
occurring at least as late as 2010, Janish repeatedly dismissed concerns that Blue Rhino might undercut AmeriGas on price or "
1458,," fill levels with words to the effect of, 'I talked to Blue Rhino, and that's not going to happen.'"" But even this allegation falls short of 
the Twombly standard. The complaint does not allege whether the conversations between AmeriGas and Blue Rhino occurred 
during the limitations period, only that comments from those alleged conversations were purportedly shared in a later retelling of 
the conversations. And the retelling can only report on ""words to the effect of"" whatever was said. The dates of the 
conversations are left to the widest range of time, though curiously late enough to just reach into the limitations period. To be 
sure, the complaint names one individual employed by AmeriGas. But naked assertions of misconduct, combined with a name 
discovered from a company directory, are not enough to survive a motion to dismiss under Twombly and Iqbal."
1458,5," In fact, the FTC, whose 2014 lawsuit precipitated this case, disagrees with the plaintiffs' allegations. ""The Commission's 
Complaint does not allege that [the defendants'] initial decisions to reduce fill levels to 15 pounds were the result of an 
agreement."" In re Ferrellgas Partners, L.P., FTC Docket No. 9360, 2014 FTC LEXIS 279, 2014 WL 5787605, at *6 (Oct. 31, 
2014) (emphasis added)."
1458,6," The majority opinion offers this small comfort to defendants: a plaintiff cannot recover for injuries suffered outside the four-year 
limitations period. But I see nothing in this opinion preventing a new lawsuit against the defendants four (or 40) years from now 
so long as fill levels remain at 15 pounds, even if price fluctuates. Small comfort indeed. "
1462,*," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
1465,1," These holdings were not without controversy. Justice Frankfurter dissented in Boxing Club and Radovich, arguing that the 
doctrine of stare decisis required the Court to exempt boxing and football from antitrust laws as well. Boxing Club, 348 U.S. at 
248-51 (""It would baffle the subtlest ingenuity to find a single differentiating factor between other sporting exhibitions . . . and 
baseball insofar as the conduct of the sport is relevant to the criteria or considerations by which the Sherman Law becomes 
applicable to a 'trade or commerce.'"") (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); Radovich, 352 U.S. at 455-56. Justice Harlan, joined by 
Justice Brennan, dissented in Radovich for similar reasons. Radovich, 352 U.S. at 456 (""Since I am unable to distinguish football 
from baseball under the rationale of Federal Base Ball and Toolson, and can find no basis for attributing to Congress a purpose 
to put baseball in a class by itself, I would adhere to the rule of stare decisis and affirm the judgment below."") (Harlan, J., 
dissenting). Justice Minton dissented in Boxing Club based on his belief that boxing is neither trade nor commerce. Boxing Club, 
348 U.S. at 251-53 (""What this Court held in the Federal Baseball case to be incident to the exhibition now becomes more 
important than the exhibition. This is as fine an example of the tail wagging the dog as can be conjured up."") (Minton, J., 
dissenting). "
1466,2," The exceptions to the rule, as noted in Miller v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir. 2003), are not applicable here. "
1474,1," The Court's exclusion of Plaintiffs' regression model proposal for purposes of this Motion should not be construed as precluding 
Plaintiffs from presenting a regression model at summary judgment or trial if Plaintiffs demonstrate at that time that the model 
withstands Daubert scrutiny. "
1481,2," Allergan also relies heavily on Allied Orthopedic Appliances, Inc. v. Tyco Healthcare Group L.P., 247 F.R.D. 156 (C.D. Cal. 
2007), but that decision supports the Court's analysis. There, the district court observed that the plaintiffs would have to show 
that, absent the antitrust violation, class members would have paid less for the product actually purchased or switched to a 
cheaper generic alternative. See id. at 166-67. Plaintiffs could not show that more than ""a handful"" of class members would have 
switched to the foreclosed generic product and had not submitted credible evidence that the alleged antitrust violations (market-
share discounts, sole-source contracts, and the introduction of the defendant's new product line) had artificially inflated the price 
of the product that class members actually purchased. Id. at 166. "

1485,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. 
1489,1," The Court takes as true all nonconclusory allegations in the Complaint and construes them in the light most favorable to 
Plaintiffs for purposes of ruling on the Motion. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 664 (2009) 668-69, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 
868 (2009). "
1492,2, The conduct comprising the alleged antitrust violations forms the basis of the Plaintiffs' UCL claim. See Complaint at ¶¶ 77-80.
1492,3," The Complaint explains that, pursuant to the November 1, 2011 Consent Decree, the Technical Services were to be provided 
for up to one year after RBC and SNTech entered into an agreement for those services. Complaint at ¶ 50. Thus, drawing all 
reasonable inferences in favor of Plaintiffs, RBC may have provided some Technical Services in November or December 2012. 
Arguing that RBC's antitrust behavior goes beyond its failure to provide sufficient Technical Services, Plaintiffs mention RBC's 
""ongoing attempts to monopolize the [electric motor spa pump market] since SNTech's bankruptcy."" Opposition at 16. But 
neither the Complaint nor the Opposition present any factual allegations of ongoing antitrust activity. In fact, the Complaint relies 
exclusively on RBC's 2010 attempt to acquire AOS, its eventual acquisition of AOS subject to the Consent Decree (presumably 
in 2011), and its inadequate provision of Technical Services in connection with the Consent Decree. See Complaint at ¶¶ 3, 7, 
36-41, 54-64. "
1493,4," The Court agrees with RBC's assessment of the speculative damages exception's application to RBC's attempted and eventual 
acquisition of AOS. See Reply at 11-12. The Complaint alleges that RBC entered into the Consent Decree and divested its spa 
motors business to preserve competition in that market and create a viable competitor to RBC. Complaint at ¶ 46. ""Accordingly, 
if [the] Plaintiffs were unable to sue RBC immediately after the acquisition in 2011, the reason was not that [the] Plaintiffs' injury 
at the time was speculative. Rather, it was because RBC's acquisition of AOS did not injure [the] Plaintiffs."" Reply at 12; see also 
Steshenko v. Gayrard, 70 F. Supp. 3d 979, 987 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (""'[A] plaintiff may plead herself out of court' if she 'plead[s] 
facts which establish that [s]he cannot prevail on h[er] . . . claim.'"" (alterations in original) (quoting Weisbuch v. County of Los 
Angeles, 119 F.3d 778, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 1997))). Indeed, the Plaintiffs' theory of antitrust liability stems directly from RBC's 
provision of Technical Services to SNTech and SNTech's resulting failure in the spa pump motor market. Moreover, as 
discussed below, even if RBC's acquisition of AOS was not time barred, an antitrust injury arising from such acquisition is 
implausible. "

1500,2," The AC does not state specify the capacity in which the State Defendants are being sued. I therefore assume Dr. Kaul intends 
to advance both official and individual capacity claims against these defendants. "
1501,3," On December 22, 2016, Dr. Kaul moved for a default judgment against Dr. Moore, and then again on May 5, 2017. (ECF Nos. 
146, 194) On June 16, 2016, Dr. Moore moved to vacate the clerk's entry of default, dismiss the motion for default judgment, and 
join the co-defendants' omnibus motion to dismiss. Dr. Moore claims that he was never served the original complaint, filed in the 
S.D.N.Y., or this amended complaint, an issue that many defendants have raised. (ECF No. 194) Dr. Kaul responded on June 
29, 2017. (ECF No. 198) Because there exists good cause, because Dr. Moore has several meritorious defenses to Dr. Kaul's 
allegations, and because there is no prejudice to Dr. Kaul, who has responded to the omnibus motion, the motion is granted. "
1503,4," Another lawyer, not Hollenbeck or a member of his firm, but Charles Shaw, Esq., represented Dr. Kaul in the disciplinary 
proceedings."
1503,5," Here is an example, which purportedly ties Brach Eichler to ASIPP, Drs. Kaufman and Staats, and the Governor. It is 
representative of the approach of the AC: The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians violated 18 U.S.C. § 1961 when it permitted its New Jersey 
chapter to conspire with the defendant governor, defendant state and defendant medical board to unlawfully obtain the 
plaintiff's property. [*15]  Defendant Kaufman and Staats are senior board members of the defendant and its New Jersey 
chapter. Staats was appointed the defendants president in 2015 and along with defendant Kaufman competed with the 
plaintiff in the same market. Kaufman and Staats both receive patients from and refer patients to the defendant 
neurosurgeons, and used their positions of power within the defendant's political action committees to give money to the 
defendant governor. The business partner of defendant Staats was appointed to the defendant medical board by the 
defendant governor in 2014, in return for the money that the defendant's New Jersey chapter gave to the defendant 
governor. The money was given to defendant Brach Eichler by way of inflated legal fees, which were then siphoned to the 
defendant governor through political lobbying firms. The defendant governor rewarded defendant Staats by appointing his 
partner to the defendant medical board and by using his executive power to revoke the plaintiffs medical license. The 
plaintiff, in contrast to many of the defendants, never sought political patronage. (AC ¶ 81)"
1503,6," Gorrell's actions also ""contributed to the opiate epidemic that now plagues the state, because patients with spinal pain had had 
to resort to the use of opiates, consequent to the reduced availability and increased cost of minimally invasive spine surgery."" 
(Id. ¶ 109) "
1504,7," Dr. Kaul specifically faults Dughi Hewit for declining to file a motion to disqualify the Deputy Attorney General from his case 
after Dr. Kaul filed an ethics complaint against her. (Id. ¶ 287)"
1504,8," The AG had been investigating Dr. Kaul since April 2012. A few days before the AG initiating the disciplinary action, on June 7, 
2012, Dr. Kaul attempted to enjoin the State and various state agencies from immediately suspending his controlled dangerous 
substance registration. That complaint was dismissed by the trial court, and then the appeal of that dismissal was dismissed by 
the Appellate Division in July 2012. (Def. Ex. E, F) "
1505,9," ""OptiMesh is a three[-]dimensional mesh bag to contain bone fragments. '. . . mesh is simply a bag that contains bones and is 
not capable of maintaining the load of body weight and, therefore, it is not considered to be an appropriate prosthetic device for 
an interspace.'"" (Order 2 n.1)"
1505,10," ""Allograft bone is obtained from a cadaver. Autograft bone is harvested from the patient's own body, often from the iliac crest."" 
(Order 17 n.5) "
1506,11," The Board, in adopting the ALJ's findings of fact as to T.Z., quoted Dr. Naseef directly on this point: [Dr. Naseef testified that] they were in a place I have never seen before . . . this one completely missed the pedicle and 
went directly through the lamina and into the vertebral body which putting screws in that is a completed different field. When 
you are not in bone, it's grossly abnormal."" (Order 18-19)"
1506,12," ALJ Solomon specifically found the ""testimony of each and every witness produced by [the Attorney General] . . . extremely 
credible and compelling"" while most of Dr. Kaul's witnesses lacked credibility or opined on irrelevant issues. (ALJ Op. 78-79) "
1507,13," Over the objection of Dr. Kaul's counsel, the Attorney General admitted an independent (i.e., not official) transcript from one 
day of the 23-day hearing. Dr. Kaul had apparently appended the transcript to a letter addressed to President Obama, which he 
had posted on a personal website. ""It shows,"" the Board concluded, ""that Respondent's transcript and the official transcript had 
only minor insubstantial inconsistencies."" (Order 22)"
1507,14," In videos posted to his website, Dr. Kaul claimed mat he was ""absolutely shocked"" by the ALJ's decision and pledged to 
continue to perform spine surgeries and teach others his methods. The plan, he said, was to open minimally invasive spine 
surgery clinics in places where people lack access to affordable spine care, such as Africa, Mexico, and Colombia. (Id. 22-23)"
1507,15," In March 1999, while practicing medicine in England, a patient for whom Dr. Kaul had administered anesthesia died. About 
two years later, in February 2001, a jury convicted Dr. Kaul of gross negligence and manslaughter. From September 2000 to 
May 2001, Dr. Kaul made a number of false or misleading statements about those criminal proceedings, the related disciplinary 
proceedings, and later, the conviction, in a number of documents submitted to the Board and New Jersey hospitals. (ALJ Op. 
90-92) For example, on April 8, 2011, Dr. Kaul submitted an application for privileges at HUMC. He was asked the following question: 
""Please indicate if you have been ever been convicted of any criminal offense, excluding minor traffic violations, e.g., passing a 
stop sign, (if yes, give details on a separate sheet.)"" Kaul checked the ""NO"" box, even though he had been convicted of 
manslaughter just a few months earlier. "
1509,16," Claiming inadequate service of process, GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett, and Crist moved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(4). Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett, and Crist also move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 12(b)(2)."
1509,17," A motion for leave to file a second amended complaint was denied without prejudice in January 2017 for failure to attach a 
proposed pleading. (ECF No. 156) "
1511,18," As it happens, records of Dr. Kaul's proceedings before the Board are posted on the Board's website. See 
http://www.njconsumeraffairs.gov/bme/Pages/actions.aspx . "
1512,19," No party has raised the applicability, or not, of Colorado River abstention in light of UNN-L332-15, which involves many of 
parties and all of the same causes of action in this case. 424 U.S. 800, 96 S. Ct. 1236, 47 L. Ed. 2d 483 (1976)."
1512,20," That is also why the Santos case, UNN-L332-15, cannot be the basis of Rooker-Feldman dismissal. As far as the Court is 
aware, there was no final judgment entered in that case as of the time this action was commenced, and there does not appear to 
have been a final judgment even now."
1512,21," The only other case cited by defendants, Harris v. N.Y. State Dep't of Health, 202 F. Supp. 2d 143, 150-51 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), 
involved a doctor who actually appealed the revocation of his medical license to a New York state court. "
1513,22," The Bank defendants argue that Rooker-Feldman dismissal is appropriate on grounds unique to them. Around April 2009, TD 
Bank became the holder of a $1 million loan that another bank had made Dr. Kaul and his companies. In 2012, he defaulted on 
that loan; on March 22, 2013, TD Bank obtained a default judgment against Dr. Kaul and his businesses. Attempting to enforce 
the judgment, the Bank Defendants allegedly ""defraud[ed] the plaintiff of his right to sell his Manhattan townhouse"" and ""used 
false pretenses to obstruct [] the townhouse and force it into foreclosure."" (E.g. AC ¶¶ 184-85) Dr. Kaul, the Bank defendants 
conclude, is thus a state-court loser complaining of injuries caused by a state-court judgment rendered before this case was 
filed, which he invites me to review and reject. Dr. Kaul, however, does not assert claims based on injuries caused by the state court judgment itself, but rather injuries 
traceable to the Bank Defendants' attempts to enforce that judgment. See, e.g., B.S. v. Somerset County, 704 F.3d 250, 260 (3d 
Cir. 2013) (holding that suits seeking redress for injuries traceable to defendants' actions, rather man the state court orders 
themselves, are not barred by Rooker-Feldman). Nor does Dr. Kaul explicitly ask this court to invalidate the judgment. Post-
Exxon, a court must be cautious in applying Rooker-Feldman where the federal claims do not directly clash with the state claims, 
but are merely ""intertwined"" with them. See, e.g., Gary v. Braddock Cemetery, 517 F.3d 195, 200 n.5 (3d Cir. 2008)) (advising 
caution in employing pre-Exxon Third Circuit precedent interpreting Rooker-Feldman). The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not 
apply to the claims against the Bank defendants. "
1514,23," At least with respect to allegations of altered transcripts, the Board noted that the single instance of such alteration provided 
by Dr. Kaul contained only ""minor insubstantial inconsistencies."" (Order 22) "
1515,24," Even if this reference to reinstatement and expungement were construed as a claim for equitable or declaratory relief, the law 
of this Circuit would mandate a stay, not outright dismissal, of the AC. See, e.g., Marran, 376 F.3d at 155. To look at it another away, consider this. The central insight of Younger is that a federal court should not grind important and 
presumptively lawful state processes to a halt by granting discretionary equitable relief. To do otherwise would unduly interfere in 
a state's sovereign prerogatives, which is why the ""normal thing to do"" is to withhold the requested relief and dismiss the case. 
E.g., New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 359, 109 S. Ct. 2506, 105 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1989) (Or, 
where both an injunction and damages are requested, stay the case and let the state proceedings run their course.) In this case, 
the administrative proceedings, while technically still pending, have essentially concluded. The time for Dr. Kaul to appeal the 
Board's Order lapsed long ago. The primary objective of AC appears to be to obtain money damages. I am confident that, to the 
extent Dr. Kaul intended to plead it, the discretionary equitable relief requested here will not unduly interfere with any state 
proceedings or objectives."
1515,25," Same reasoning applies to Zahl v. Harper, 282 F.3d 204 (3d Cir. 2002), in which a doctor tried to get a district court to enjoin 
the State from bringing disciplinary proceedings. The Third Circuit ruled that the district court appropriately dismissed the case 
on abstention grounds."
1515,26," The Bank Defendants claim that their default judgment against Dr. Kaul injects special jurisdictional considerations as to the 
claims against them. There is no analysis, however, why that may be the case. Because the Bank Defendants have failed to 
argue, let alone show, that Younger abstention is triggered by its March 22, 2013 default judgment or the subsequent 
foreclosure proceedings, I will not abstain from hearing the claims as to them. "
1516,27," AC ¶ 63 (""Warren Buffet[t] is the Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, which is the parent company of GEICO. The 
defendant is liable for illegal acts to which there exists a nexus to the aforementioned corporations. The protections of the 
corporate veil become forfeited when the majority of shareholders are ignorant as to the existence of the illegal acts. The illegal 
act was the alteration of court transcripts by the defendant state, which deprived the plaintiff of his Constitutional right to due 
process and which caused damage to the plaintiff's estate and reputation. The defendant violated the Racketeer and Influenced 
Corruption Act when he conspired by willful ignorance with the defendant Governor to revoke the medical license of the 
plaintiff."")"
1516,28," Because I dismiss the AC pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) as to Crist, Berkshire Hathaway, and Buffett, I do not reach these 
defendants' arguments mat dismissal is warranted for lack of sufficient process and personal jurisdiction."
1516,29," See, e.g., Jones v. TD Bank, 468 F. App'x 93, 94 (2012) (no private right of action under the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. §

1517,30," H&S and Hollenbeck advance a res judicata argument based on orders from another action. The facts necessary to perform 
the appropriate analysis, however, are not apparent from the face of the complaint or other documents properly considered on a 
motion to dismiss. On August 25, 2014, H&S obtained a default judgment against Dr. Kaul in the amount of $97,886.96 for unpaid legal services. 
Almost two years later, in June 2016, Dr. Kaul filed a motion to vacate the judgment and sought leave to file an answer, 
counterclaims, and third party complaint. The proposed counterclaims and third party complaint asserted RICO, Hobbs Act, mail 
fraud, wire fraud, honest services fraud, and violations of constitutional rights against the Governor, the Board, and Drs. 
Peterson and Heary. On October 6, 2016, the motion to vacate was denied. (Def. Ex. Q) S&H and Hollenbeck do not identify which order—the August 2014 default judgment or the October 6, 2016 denial of the motion 
to vacate—they believe carries preclusive effect. Presumably they mean the default judgment; if so, I still cannot discern from 
the face of the complaint and the appropriate documents the relationship between the $97,886.96 worth of legal fees Dr. Kaul 
owed S&H and the $196,000 S&H allegedly ""attempted to extort"" from Dr. Kaul weeks before the August 2013 disciplinary 
hearings. The answer to that question would be best explored on a motion for summary judgment, not to dismiss. "
1518,31," The doctrine rests on considerations of fairness and efficiency: Under the entire controversy doctrine, a party cannot withhold part of a controversy for separate later litigation even when 
the withheld component is a separate and independently cognizable cause of action. The doctrine has three purposes: (1) 
complete and final disposition of cases through avoidance of piecemeal decisions; (2) fairness to parties to an action and to 
others with a material interest in it; and (3) efficiency and avoidance of waste and delay. See DiTrolio v. Antiles, 142 N.J. 
253, 662 A.2d 494, 502 (N.J. 1995). As an equitable doctrine, its application is flexible, with a case-by-case appreciation for 
fairness to the parties. Paramount Aviation Corp. v. Agusta, 178 F.3d 132, 137 (3d Cir. 1999). "
1519,32," New Jersey's Antitrust Act is essentially a replica of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act. See, e.g., N.J. Stat. § 56:9-1, et seq. "
1520,33," CNS presents a more difficult case. In the state case, Drs. Przybylski, Carmel, and Moore allegedly colluded to influence 
legislatures and companies to change certain billing codes in ways that favored neurologists. While CNS was not a named 
defendant in the State Complaint, Dr. Kaul used the placeholder ""ABC Associations 1-5"" to capture unknown professional 
organizations that assisted in that effort. In this federal case, Przybylski, Carmel, and Moore are alleged to be CNS members, 
and CNS allegedly ""used its political action committees to influence . . . legislation"" that favored neurosurgeons. (AC ¶¶ 91) It's 
not clear, however, whether that ""legislation"" was directed towards the billing codes, or something else entirely. Because I 
cannot determine from the face of the complaint whether res judicata applies, I cannot grant dismissal as to CNS on those 
grounds."
1520,34," Without further facts, I will not imply a duty to amend the prior Complaint. The case law seems to indicate that the question 
turns on when the plaintiff knew about the cause of action. See Cafferata v. Peyser, 251 N.J. Super 256, 260-61, 597 A.2d 1101 
(Super. Ct. App. Div. 1991). "
1521,35," Congress did not abrogate the States' sovereign immunity when it enacted section 1983, e.g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 
342, 99 S. Ct. 1139, 59 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1979), the Sherman and Clayton Acts, e.g., Jackson v. Conn. Dep't of Pub. Health, 3:15-
CV-750 (CSH), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80672, at *40-42 (D. Conn. June 20, 2016), Gebman v. State, No. 07-cv-1226 (GLS-
DRH), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46125, at *11-13, 2008 WL 2433693 (N.D.N.Y. June 12, 2008), or the RICO statute, Dianese v. 
Pennsylvania, Civil Action No. 01-2520, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10917, at *17 (E.D. Pa. June 19, 2002). The Third Circuit, and later the Supreme Court, held that Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity with its commerce 
clause powers. See United States v. Union Gas Co., 832 F.2d 1343, 1356 (3d Cir. 1987), affirmed, 491 U.S. 1, 109 S. Ct. 2273, 
105 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1989). That decision, however, was overruled in Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 544, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 134 
L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996)."
1521,36," They may remain potentially liable as persons in their individual capacities, however. See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 25, 112 
S. Ct. 358, 116 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1991); Estate of Lagano v. Bergen Cnty. Prosecutor's Office, 769 F.3d 850, 856 (3d Cir. 2014)."
1521,37," To the extent they are private citizens, they probably lack ""person"" status to be sued under section 1983, however. See infra 
Part IV.B. "
1523,38," These defenses—especially qualified immunity—ordinarily parry alleged violations of constitutional rights; it is somewhat 
atypical for a public official to shield themselves from violations of federal statutes, such as the RICO or antitrust laws, with 
absolute or qualified immunity. Nevertheless, there is persuasive authority that absolute and qualified immunity applies to RICO 
claims, and none of it appears to be disputed. See, e.g., Cullinan v. Abramson, 128 F.3d 301, 308-312 (6th Cir. 1997) (applying 
qualified and absolute immunity to RICO claims); Van Beek v. Ag-Credit Bonus Ptnrs., 316 F. App'x 554, 555-56 (9th Cir. 2008) 
(applying judicial and prosecutorial immunity to RICO claims); Parette v. Virden, 173 F. App'x 534, 536 (8th Cir. 2006) (applying 
absolute immunity analysis to RICO claims). As to antitrust claims, there seems to be no authority directly on point. There is no reason to think, however, that the Sherman or 
Clayton acts abridged the common law immunity from damages suits ""for all persons—governmental or otherwise—who were 
integral parts of the judicial process."" Briscoe v. Lahue, 460 U.S. 325, 335-36, 103 S. Ct. 1108, 75 L. Ed. 2d 96 (1983). And 
while the qualified immunity analysis has been honed in the context of alleged violations of civil or constitutional rights, there is 
no obvious reason to think that it cannot be performed in the context of antitrust claims. The debate in any case is academic; the 
AC fails to state a claim under the antitrust laws, which is essentially the first step in the qualified immunity analysis."
1523,39," The State does not assert that Drs. Przybylski and Kaufman are absolutely immune for claims arising from their testimony, or 
that Chiesa is entitled to prosecutorial immunity. I therefore do not reach those issues. Again, because it is not clear whether Drs. Przybylski or Lomazow are state officials, I do not reach the qualified immunity 
question as to them. To the extent the motion is denied, it is without prejudice as to them. "
1524,40," For the purposes of argument going forward, I assume that a plaintiff may obtain injunctive relief under RICO. Curley v. 
Cumberland Farms Dairy, 728 F. Supp. 1123, 1137-38 (D.N.J. 1989) (concluding that injunctive relief is unavailable under 
RICO); but see Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Phillip Morris, 171 F.3d 912, 935 n.20 (3d Cir. 1999) (""This 
court has yet to decide whether injunctive relief is available for a private party under RICO.""). "
1525,41," Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), by any person injured in her business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962. In 
order to state a claim under 1964(c), a plaintiff must plead ""(1) a section 1962 violation and (2) an injury to business or property 
by reason of such injury."" Lightning Lube, Inc., v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1187 (3d Cir. 1993). To establish a claim under 
1962(a), ""a plaintiff must allege: (1) that the defendant has received money from a pattern of racketeering activity; (2) invested 
that money in an enterprise; and (3) that the enterprise affected interstate commerce."" Id. at 1189 (citation omitted). Establishing 
a pattern of racketeering requires allegations of ""at least two acts of racketeering activity within a ten-year period."" 18 U.S.C. § 
1961(5). Under section 1962(b), ""a plaintiff must show injury from the defendant's acquisition or control of an interest in a RICO 
enterprise, in addition to injury from the predicate acts"" of racketeering. Lightning Lube, 4 F.3d at 1190. To allege a claim under 
Section 1962(c), a plaintiff must plead conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. District 1199P Health & 
Welfare Plan v. Janssen, L.P., 784 F. Supp. 2d 508, 518-19 (D.N.J. 2011) (citation omitted). Section 1962(d) prohibits conspiring 
to violate sections (a)-(c). 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d). "
1526,42," Nor does the AC very specifically really adequately allege the use of the mails or interstate wires. There are a handful of 
exceptions. (E.g., AC ¶¶ 200-206, 208) Nevertheless, the letters or wires element is pled only generally and without reference to 
the interstate/intrastate distinction. (E.g., ¶ 200 (""Dughi + Hewit, LLC violated 18 U.S.C. § 1341 when it schemed to defraud the 
plaintiff of his property with false representations of the work it had performed and for which the plaintiff had paid it $7500. The 
defendant committed wire fraud when it caused these false representations to be transmitted by phone and internet.""); ¶ 201 
(""Andrew Kaufman violated 18 U.S.C. § 1341 when he communicated via phone and the internet that the plaintiff was not 
qualified to perform minimally invasive spine surgery.""). Nor is there is the relation, if any, of the use of wires or mails to the 
allegedly fraudulent scheme explained. At any rate, the substantive allegations of fraud for each of these allegations are far too 
thin and non-specific to state a claim for mail, wire, or honest services fraud."
1526,43," There is also a jurisdictional element; the statute applies to one who ""in any way degree obstructs, delays, or affects 
commerce or the movement of any article or commodity by robbery or extortion . . ."" 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a). The AC only 
sometimes alleges that the attempted extortion was an effort to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce. That would be an 
independent reason to dismiss many of these extortion claims. "
1527,44," It is not clear whether the representation was related to the administrative proceedings. (AC ¶ 76 (""The defendant defrauded 
the plaintiff of approximately $200,000 with false representations that it had performed legal work in preparation for the plaintiffs 
OAL hearing. The defendant then attempted to extort $196,000 from the plaintiff two weeks before the OAL hearing was meant 
to commence with the threat that they would abandon the case if the plaintiff did not pay the money within 24 hours of the 
demand."") "
1528,45," I quote three of the conspiracy allegations, which are typical. See, e.g., AC ¶ 74 (alleging that Staats ""conspired with the 
defendant governor, defendant medical board and defendant state in a scheme whose purpose was to revoke the plaintiff's 
medical license . . . Defendant is regularly in Washington, DC meeting with Congressmen and US Senators, and the defendant 
society of which he is the President, has an active political donation apparatus. The defendant's business partner was appointed 
to the defendant medical board by the defendant governor in approximately 2014, and was involved in the attempt by the 
defendant medical board to extort $450,000 from plaintiff.''); AC ¶ 77 (Hollenbeck ""conspired with the defendant governor, 
defendant state and defendant medical board to extort money from the plaintiff under the color of right, with a threat two weeks 
before the OAL hearing, that he would withdraw legal services if the plaintiff did not pay $196,000 within twenty-four hours. The 
defendant . . . is a member of the New Jersey Republican Party. The defendant has close professional and commercial ties with 
the defendant governor and defendant attorney general and has given money to the Republican Party. The defendant has 
offices in both Trenton and Washington, DC.""); AC ¶ 125 (alleging that GEICO ""conspired with the defendant governor and his 
executive agencies to impose a $450,000 'fine' which they attempted to extort from the plaintiff when he made an application for 
license reinstatement in 2014"")."
1528,46," Specifically, the AC pleads violations of section 2 of the Sherman Act, which generally addresses single-firm conduct. Since 
this is a pro se plaintiff, I assume the AC intends to plead section 1 violations as well. "
1529,47," E.g., AC ¶ 94 (""The effect of the monopolization has been an increase in the cost of care and a reduction in the availability of 
clinical services."")"
1529,48," Noerr-Pennington, by the way, would probably apply to the RICO claims as well. Cf. We, Inc., v. City of Philadelphia, 174 F.3d 
322, 326-27 (3d Cir. 1999) (""This court, along with other courts, has by analogy extended the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to offer 
protection to citizens' petition activities in contexts outside the anti-trust area as well.""). "

U.S. 238 (1944), overruled on other grounds by Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 429 U.S. 17 (1976), and Precision Instrument 
Manufacturing Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., 324 U.S. 806 (1945). "
1562,17," Under its sixth cause of action, Lawrence Livermore makes two conflicting arguments: (1) under Article 13, Lawrence 
Livermore is entitled to the excess of the costs and (2) Femto-Sec is not entitled to any recovery or settlement because 
Lawrence Livermore terminated the License and Article 9, which keeps certain parts of the License alive after termination, does 
not apply to Article 13. -1551 Case, Docket No. 165-16 ¶¶ 165, 167-69. However, Lawrence Livermore's motion for summary 
judgment regarding its sixth crossclaim is narrow and only focuses on the first question: ""Lawrence Livermore does not move on 
the other elements of its Sixth Crossclaim against Femto-Sec and Dr. Neev. Ex. 56, ¶ 169."" -1551 Case, Docket No. 171 at 21. 
Therefore, at this time, the Court does not determine whether, because of Article 9, Femto-Sec does not have any right to 
recovery or settlement under the License. For the narrow question before the Court, the Court will assume that Article 13.4 
survives the termination of the License so that the Court can determine Femto-Sec's rights under Article 13.4. "
1564,18," Femto-Sec argues that the indemnification claims in Articles 16 and 13.2 are contradictory and invalid. -1551 Case, Docket 
No. 179 at 15. But as the Court discusses, each Article covers a different type of lawsuit, i.e., Article 16 covers defensive actions 
and Article 13.2 covers offensive actions."
1564,19," Femto-Sec disputes whether Lawrence Livermore's attorneys' fees are excessive. -1551 Case, Docket No. 178 at 18. 
However, the Court makes no determination about the amount of attorneys' fees that Lawrence Livermore can recover at this 
time. The Court has only found that Femto-Sec must indemnify Lawrence Livermore under Article 13.2. "

recovery or settlement under the License. For the narrow question before the Court, the Court will assume that Article 13.4 
survives the termination of the License so that the Court can determine Femto-Sec's rights under Article 13.4. "
1596,18," Femto-Sec argues that the indemnification claims in Articles 16 and 13.2 are contradictory and invalid. -1551 Case, Docket 
No. 179 at 15. But as the Court discusses, each Article covers a different type of lawsuit, i.e. [*98] , Article 16 covers defensive 
actions and Article 13.2 covers offensive actions."
1596,19," Femto-Sec disputes whether Lawrence Livermore's attorneys' fees are excessive. -1551 Case, Docket No. 178 at 18. 
However, the Court makes no determination about the amount of attorneys' fees that Lawrence Livermore can recover at this 
time. The Court has only found that Femto-Sec must indemnify Lawrence Livermore under Article 13.2. "
1598,1," All facts are taken from Sherr's First Amended Complaint [Docket No. 15] and are assumed true. Poehl v. Countrywide Home 
Loans, Inc., 528 F.3d 1093, 1096 (8th Cir. 2008). "
1612,1," Because the ""free base"" forms of many pharmaceutical compounds often do not exhibit the range of physical properties that 
are suitable for drug development, chemists sometimes modify the characteristics of the compound by adding an acid to form an 
""acid addition salt."" One common acid addition salt is a salt of methanesulfonic acid, also known as ""mesylate."" Novartis sells 
Gleevec with imatinib mesylate in a tablet form."
1612,2," Once a salt is selected, a drug manufacturer can also select a polymorphic form of the salt. Salts crystallize in a variety of 
different shapes, depending on conditions like temperature, solvent, and degree of supersaturation. When a salt is to be used in 
pharmaceutical drugs, some crystalline forms are preferable to others, as the form of the salt can affect drug qualities such as 
stability, dissolution, and bioavilability. In addition, certain crystalline forms may not be ideal for mass-scale production, in light of 
the form's flow properties, compressibility, bulk density, and particle sizes. Plaintiffs allege that ""[n]eedle-shaped crystals, which 
are long and very thin . . . are very difficult to handle both in the laboratory and in commercial production."" Id. ¶ 41. Accordingly, 
it is preferable to use a non-needle crystalline form when developing a salt for use in prescription drugs. Id. ¶ 42."
1612,3," The '051 Patent is alleged to expire November 23, 2019. CAC ¶ 262. The CAC alleges that the '799 Patent, due to the terminal 
disclaimer, would expire the same day, id. ¶ 293, but Novartis represents that the RE'932 Patent expires on July 16, 2019 [ECF 
No. 112 at 4 n.6]."
1612,4," The Court understands the term ""methanesulfonate salt"" to be identical to ""mesylate salt"" in this case, and thus uses them 
interchangeably. "
1613,5," Although the Patent Board's decision is not attached to the CAC, it is cited at length therein. Moreover, because documents in 
the patent's prosecution history are public records, the Court may take judicial notice of their contents. See Beddall v. State St. 
Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16-17 (1st Cir. 1998)."
1613,6," ""If, on examination, it appears that the applicant is entitled to a patent under the law, a notice of allowance will be sent to the 
applicant . . . ."" 37 C.F.R. § 1.311(a). "
1615,7," Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (""FDCA""), a drug manufacturer must obtain FDA approval to market a drug 
product by filing a New Drug Application (""NDA""). The FDA will approve the NDA if the drug applicant is able to demonstrate that 
the drug is safe and effective to treat a particular condition. Within thirty days after the FDA approves an NDA, the drug applicant 
must submit a ""Form 3542"" to the FDA, in which the sponsor discloses all patents that it believes are implicated by its new drug. 
Specifically, FDA regulations require the applicant to disclose each patent that claims the drug or a method of using the drug that is the subject of the [new drug application] . . . and with 
respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the 
patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product."
1615,21," C.F.R. § 314.53(b)(1). If, however, there are no relevant patents that could reasonably be asserted, the applicant is also 
required to disclose this information. The regulation provides that [i]f the applicant believes that there are no relevant patents that claim the drug substance . . . drug product . . . or the 
method(s) of use for which the applicant has received approval, and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement 
could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner of the patent engaged in the manufacture, use, or sale 
of the drug product, the applicant will verify this information in the appropriate forms. Id. § 314.53(c)(3). The FDA publishes the patent information provided by the drug applicant in a compendium called Approved 
Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book). "
1616,8," The CAC explains the Hatch-Waxman amendments as follows. See CAC ¶¶ 58-64. In 1984, Congress passed the ""Hatch-
Waxman"" amendments to the FDCA, which were designed to speed the introduction of low-cost generic drugs into the market by 
permitting generic manufactures to file abbreviated new drug applications. The FDA will approve an ANDA as long as the 
applicant can show that the proposed generic is therapeutically equivalent to an existing brand-name drug on the market. The 
Hatch-Waxman amendments also created a mechanism to resolve potential patent disputes between would-be generic 
manufacturers and brand-name manufacturers before the launch of a generic product. When filing an ANDA, the generic 
manufacturer must certify, in one of four ways, that its proposed drug will not infringe any patents listed in the Orange Book for 
the brand-name drug. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(2)(A)(vii). If the generic drug sponsor files a ""Paragraph IV Certification,"" a brand-
name manufacturer can sue the ANDA applicant for patent infringement (notwithstanding the fact that the applicant is not yet 
infringing). The resulting lawsuit, which is commonly known as ""Hatch-Waxman Litigation,"" has the effect of staying the FDA's 
final approval of the ANDA until the earlier of (1) the passage of 30 months or (2) a court entering final judgment finding that the 
patent is invalid or not infringed by the generic. Until one of those conditions occurs, the FDA cannot authorize the generic 
manufacturer to go to market with its product. In addition, the Hatch-Waxman amendments provide that the first ANDA drug 
applicant to challenge a patent through a Paragraph IV Certification is eligible for six months of marketing exclusivity after it 
brings its drug to market."
1616,9, Novartis did not assert the '799 Patent or the RE'932 Patent against Sun. 
1619,10," Although the Court need not reach the antitrust standing issue because the claims are dismissed on other grounds, it notes 
that whether Plaintiffs, as indirect purchasers, have antitrust standing to recover under state antitrust statutes in federal court is a 
question of state law, see Salveson v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., 166 F. Supp. 3d 242, 256 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 663 F. App'x 71 (2d 
Cir. 2016), cert. denied 137 S.Ct. 1826, 197 L. Ed. 2d 760 (2017); see also In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litig., No. 13-
MD-2420 YGR, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, 2014 WL 4955377, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2014) (""[A]ntitrust standing under 
state law is just that, a matter of state law.""); D.R. Ward Constr. Co. v. Rohm & Haas Co., 470 F. Supp. 2d 485, 494 (E.D. Pa. 
2006), that the parties failed to adequately brief. Furthermore, the Court does not understand Novartis' challenge to Plaintiffs' 
standing to assert claims in states where they do not reside and have not been injured to raise an Article III standing issue that 
must be addressed now. See Newberg on Class Actions § 2:3; In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 
148 F.3d 283, 307 (3d Cir. 1998) (""The absentee class members are not required to make a similar [Article III] showing, because 
once the named parties have demonstrated they are properly before the court, 'the issue [becomes] one of compliance with the 
provisions of Rule 23, not one of Article III standing.'"" (quoting Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 113, 122 (3d Cir. 
1985), aff'd, 482 U.S. 656, 107 S. Ct. 2617, 96 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1987))). "
1621,11," Plaintiffs alleged that the Buchdunger and Druker articles disclosed that scientists used the β-crystalline form of the mesylate 
salt. CAC ¶ 183. The actual description of these articles calls that allegation into question. The 1996 Buchdunger Article 
apparently discussed ""crystalline derivatives"" without describing any specific crystalline form. See CAC ¶¶ 165-67. The 1996 "
1622,," Druker Article only seems to discuss mesylate salt generally, not its crystalline forms. See CAC ¶¶ 159-64. In any event, both 
were disclosed prior to the issuance of the '051 Patent."
1622,12," The Federal Circuit has described Walker Process fraud as distinct from inequitable conduct because ""[t]he heightened 
standard of materiality in a Walker Process case requires that the patent would not have issued but for the patent examiner's 
justifiable reliance on the patentee's misrepresentation or omission."" Dippin' Dots, Inc. v. Mosey, 476 F.3d 1337, 1346-47 (Fed. 
Cir. 2007); see also C.R. Bard, 157 F.3d at 1365 (explaining that ""an equitable defense . . . may be satisfied when material 
information is withheld with the intent to deceive the examiner, whether or not the examiner is shown to have relied thereon""); 
SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., No. C 04-4379 JF (RS), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87344, 2008 WL 4615605, at *5 n.5 
(N.D. Cal. Oct. 17, 2008) (""Walker Process fraud essentially is a more egregious version of inequitable conduct.""). In Metris 
U.S.A., Inc. v. Faro Techs., Inc., the court observed that, following a Federal Circuit decision in 2011 that heightened the 
standard for inequitable conduct, ""it appears that Walker Process fraud is now largely coextensive with the new inequitable 
conduct doctrine."" 882 F. Supp. 2d 160, 174 (D. Mass. 2011). Thus, although the Federal Circuit has not clarified how 
coextensive Walker Process fraud is with inequitable conduct, it seems to remain the case that a plaintiff that fails to allege 
inequitable conduct, necessarily fails to allege Walker Process fraud. Dippin' Dots, 476 F.3d at 1346-47. "
1624,13," Novartis also argues that the state-law Walker Process fraud claims should be dismissed because they are preempted by 
federal patent law. When determining whether state-law claims are preempted by federal patent law, Federal Circuit law 
controls. Dominant Semiconductors Sdn. Bhd. v. OSRAM GmbH, 524 F.3d 1254, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In Hunter Douglas, Inc. 
v. Harmonic Design, Inc., the Federal Circuit considered whether federal patent law preempted state law claims for, inter alia, 
state unfair competition law that prohibited tortious activities in the marketplace. 153 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1998), overruled on 
other grounds, Midwest Industries, Inc. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F.3d 1356, 1358-59 (Fed. Cir. 1999). It held that there was 
no field preemption of state unfair competition law by federal patent law. Hunter Douglas, 153 F.3d at 1334-35. With respect to 
conflict preemption, Hunter Douglas held that state-law claims were preempted by federal patent law only""[i]f a plaintiff bases its 
tort action on conduct that is protected or governed by federal patent law."" Id. at 1335. Because Novartis' preemption argument 
does not implicate this Court's jurisdiction, the Court need not address it here. This Court also need not address Defendants' 
state law-specific arguments for dismissal. "
