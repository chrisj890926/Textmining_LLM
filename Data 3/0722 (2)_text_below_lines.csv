42,1," At this time, the Court refrains from addressing whether Union Defendants are afforded statutory and nonstatutory exemptions 
to the anti-trust laws. "
44,2," Prime Healthcare alleges the following activities were ""coordinated"" by Defendants in ""secret meetings,"" and constitute anti-
competitive conduct that resulted in a restraint of trade: (1) Kaiser Defendants are violating the Taft-Hartley act, 29 U.S.C. § 186, by disguising payments to the SEIU under the Labor 
Management Partnership Trust, which is nothing more than a vehicle to funnel payments directly to the SEIU to knock out 
Kaiser's competitors. Kaiser Defendants allegedly paid over $140 million into the Partnership Trust since 2004. The Trust then 
transferred over $50 million to the Labor Management Coalition which essentially made direct payments to representatives of 
the SEIU. These facts demonstrate that the Partnership Trust is a sophisticated money laundering operation, and the payments 
are part of the benefits the SEIU receives directly for participating in the illegal conspiracy. (FAC ¶¶173-187); (2) Union Defendants sought to increase the number of healthcare workers it represents by waging pressure campaigns against 
Kaiser competitors to render those companies less competitive. (FAC ¶¶ 195-97); (3) Union Defendants  [*21] targeted Kaiser competitors Columbia/HCA, Tenet and CHW, using tactics such as publicizing 
reports and studies designed to cast a negative light on the hospitals, some of which resulted in investigations by agencies. 
(FAC ¶¶198-203); (4) Union Defendants' organizing tactics resulted in Tenet and CHW ""strik[ing] a deal"" with Union Defendants, which in turn 
""raised its cost-structure and made it less of a market threat to Kaiser."" (FAC ¶¶202-203); "
45,," (5) Union Defendants advocated in favor of two ballot initiatives, which would have increased costs for for-profit hospitals, but 
later abandoned support of those initiatives after entering into an agreement with the California Hospital Association. (FAC ¶¶ 
207-211); (6) Kaiser Defendants supported Union Defendants' proposal to increase nurse staffing ratios, a decision made against Kaiser's 
own business interest because increased staffing increases hospital costs and which only served to increase SEIU membership. 
(FAC ¶¶ 214-20); (7) Kaiser and Union Defendants negotiated the termination of approximately 1,350 of SEIU-represented Kaiser employees, an 
action that was not in the best interest of the Union Defendants but strengthened Kaiser's role  [*22] in the market. (FAC ¶¶ 226-
29); (8) Kaiser Defendants encourages its members to call a ""nurse line"" before seeking emergency care, in which Kaiser coerces 
their members to select Kaiser facilities for their emergency room needs instead of non-Kaiser hospitals. (FAC ¶¶ 252-54); (9) Kaiser Defendants, through threats and intimidation, forces its members to transfer from Prime Healthcare's hospitals to 
Kaiser facilities, and harasses, intimidates and coerces the treating Prime Healthcare physician to authorize the transfer of the 
Kaiser member patient. (FAC ¶¶ 254-56); (10) Kaiser Defendants refuse to pay claims from non-Kaiser hospitals such as Prime Healthcare, thereby raising Prime 
Healthcare's cost to do business and remain a competitor. (FAC ¶¶ 257-60; 305); (11) Kaiser Defendants and Union Defendants together increased wages for healthcare workers, reflecting ""an attempt to mask 
its anticompetitive conduct from antitrust scrutiny by taking advantage of the antitrust exemption afforded labor unions under 
current case law."" (FAC ¶ 262); (12) Defendants together planned a public campaign against Prime Healthcare, which Union Defendants executed beginning in 
February 2010. (FAC ¶¶ 265-288); (13)  [*23] Union Defendants supported California Senate Bill 408, legislation ""prepared in retaliation for Prime's November 2010 
acquisition of Alvarado Hospital and designed for no purpose other than to restrict Prime's ability to acquire additional hospitals."" 
While many hospitals opposed this measure, Kaiser ""stood on the sidelines."" The bill was ultimately vetoed by Governor Jerry 
Brown. (FAC ¶¶ 290-91); (14) Union Defendants campaigned to block the bankruptcy sale of Victor Valley Community Hospital to Prime Healthcare 
Services Foundation. (FAC ¶¶ 292-96); (15) By contrast, Union Defendants have not publicized negative information regarding Kaiser's overpayment for reporting 
excess cases for certain illnesses, assessment of record penalties, mortality rates identified in Kaiser's kidney transplant 
program, or Occupational Safety and Health Act complaints filed by Kaiser employees. (FAC ¶¶ 302-09); (16) Kaiser and Union Defendants advocated for the passage of SB 1285, a bill that would require hospitals with an out-of-
network emergency utilization rate of greater than fifty percent to adjust charges for out-of-network emergency care. (FAC ¶¶ 
312-318); (17) During a meeting between Prime Healthcare  [*24] representatives and SEIU-UHW President Dave Regan, Mr. Regan 
""demanded that Prime enter into an organizing agreement with UHW,"" and ""if Prime did not capitulate to his demands, [Union 
Defendants] would push the 'Prime Bill', i.e., SB 1285."" Prime did not agree and the next day the bill was passed in the California 
legislature. (FAC ¶¶ 318-20); (18) Union Defendants have launched unsuccessful litigation against Prime Healthcare. (FAC ¶¶ 321-23) "
51,3," At this time, the Court refrains from taking judicial notice of publicly available information showing Kaiser's market share. "
57,1," HN1[
] In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, ""[t]he facts contained in the petition are  [**2] treated as true and they 
are construed liberally in favor of the plaintiffs."" In re T.Q.L., 386 S.W.3d 135, 139 (Mo. banc 2012). ""The court makes no effort 
to weigh the credibility and persuasiveness of the facts alleged."" Id. "
58,2," In both points, Hedrick has failed to follow the required format for a Point Relied On under Rule 84.04(d)(1)(C). HN3[
] Failure to follow Rule 84.04 is cause for dismissal. However, we will review this appeal ex gratia as the issues are sufficiently defined 
and easily resolved. "
59,3," All statutory references are to RSMo 2000, through the most current cumulative supplement, unless otherwise indicated."
59,4," At oral argument Hedrick's counsel stated that Hedrick first became aware of the policy when he received his service letter 
following his termination."
59,5," Notably, neither party produced a written policy concerning the prohibition against patronizing a competitor; however, even if 
one were to have been produced, our analysis does not change because being terminated for refusing to sign a restrictive 
covenant (the use of which is against public policy) is not at issue. "
63,1," The four GDSs are Sabre/Travelocity, Worldspan, Galileo, and Amadeus. (See id. ¶ 2.) "
64,2," Because Pro Search's First Amended Complaint relies upon the contracts, the Court grants VFML's request to take judicial 
notice of the contracts. Branch, 14 F.3d at 453-54. (See Doc. 40.) However, the Court cannot, and does not, consider 
extraneous assertions regarding the contracts, including assertions to the effect that some of the contracts have already been 
 [*8] terminated. "
65,3," This is in contrast to the situation in ICE Portal, Inc. v. VFM Leonardo, Inc., No. 09-61424-CIV-ALTONAGA/Brown (S.D. Fla. 
July 6, 2010), where the plaintiff had alleged tying. See 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68005, [WL] at *6. Pro Search attached a copy of 
the ICE Portal court's order to its Opposition. (See Opp'n Ex. A, Doc. 34.) "
66,4," Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961), referenced by Pro Search in its 
papers and at oral argument, does not support Pro Search's Sherman Act claims. The Tampa Electric Court reversed a 
summary judgment, concluding that a twenty-year requirements contract between a public utility and a coal supplier did not 
violate § 3 of the Clayton Act. "
67,5," ""Dastar substituted a new opening sequence, credit page, and final closing for those of the Crusade television series; inserted 
new chapter-title sequences and narrated chapter introductions; moved the ""recap"" in the Crusade television series to the 
beginning and retitled it as a ""preview""; and removed references to and images of the book. Dastar created new packaging for 
its Campaigns series and (as already noted) a new title."" Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23, 26-27, 
123 S. Ct. 2041, 156 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2003). "
72,1, Plaintiff referenced this case in the Complaint and in the IFP application 
97,1," Two other defendants named in the first amended complaint, Cardinal Health, Inc. and Owens & Minor, Inc. have been 
voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Doc. No. 42. This action makes moot a portion of the motion to dismiss filed as Doc. No. 
23 and makes the motion to dismiss filed as Doc. No. 25 entirely moot."
97,2," The court shall also rule as follows upon motions connected to the motions to dismiss. The unopposed motion to amend the 
memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss filed by defendant Owen & Minor Distribution, Inc. (Doc.  [**3] No. 45) and that "
98,," defendant's request for judicial notice (Doc. No. 29) shall be granted. The motion for oral argument filed by defendants Cardinal 
Health 200, LLC and Owens & Minor Distribution, Inc. (Doc. No. 48), which is also unopposed, shall be denied. "
101,3," Defendant Cardinal has cited Bailey's, Inc. v. Windsor Am., Inc., 948 F.2d 1018, 1032 (6th Cir. 1991) for the proposition that a 
defendant whose share of the market is less than that of other competitors lacks the market power to restrain trade in violation of 
§ 1 of the Sherman Act. The market share of the defendant in that case, however, was much less than the alleged market share 
of defendants Cardinal and O&M in this case."
101,4," Plaintiff also alleges that each product category within the broader market of med-surg products constitutes a relevant market 
or submarket. Doc. No. 19, ¶¶ 25-26. "
102,5," The type of factual analysis described in Allen and Lockheed Martin occurred in Thurman Industries, Inc. v. Pay 'N Pak Stores, 
Inc. 875 F.2d 1369, 1374 (9th Cir. 1989) where a plaintiff unsuccessfully argued upon summary judgment that a market should 
be defined by customers of home center stores that provide one-stop service as opposed to less comprehensive retail outlets. 
See also, Westman Comm'n Co., 796 F.2d at 1221-22 (discussing  [**21] markets defined by consumers who demand a 
""cluster"" of goods but not finding such to be the case for restaurant equipment purchasers). "
105,6," This conclusion is supported by more recent reviews of case law. E.g., In re Pool Products Distribution Market Antitrust 
Litigation, 940 F. Supp. 2d 367, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52298, 2013 WL 1556391 **10-11 (E.D.La. 4/11/2013); Kolon Industries, 
Inc. v. E.I.DuPont De Nemours and Co., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48722, 2012 WL 1155218 **9-11 (E.D.Va. 4/5/2012); Loren Data 
Corp. v. GXS, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88222, 2011 WL 3511003 *7 (D.Md. 8/9/2011)(50% or 60% is insufficient usually, but 
other relevant factors should be considered); see also, Cohlmia v. St. John Medical Center, 693 F.3d 1269, 1283 (10th Cir. 
2012)(citing IIB Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law 250 (3d ed. 2006) as stating, ""We . . . presume that market shares below 
50 or 60 percent do not constitute monopoly power . . . . [and e]ven without an absolute rule, a clear presumption will almost 
always be decisive.""). "
114,1," Defendants contend that Reebok's licensing rights were exclusive in some, but not all, apparel categories. See Defs.' Mot. to 
Dismiss. 1. "
115,2," Defendants appear to disagree with this notion and argue that the NFL and the NFL teams have collectively licensed their 
logos and other trademarks for use in consumer apparel products for at least fifty years. See Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss. 1. "
118,3," It is for this reason that the American Needle court rejected the applicability of Weber v. Nat'l Football League, 112 F. Supp. 2d 
667 (N.D. Ohio 2000), a case that is also cited by Defendants here. The Weber court rejected the plaintiff's alleged relevant 
market consisting of the domain names for NFL teams, ""jets.com"" and ""dolphins.com."" Id. at 673. However, that court's 
reasoning is distinguishable because the ""exact purpose"" of a domain name is to identify the origin of a product (in that case, 
web content). See Am. Needle, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 693 n.2."
118,4," The area in which this Court sits—San Jose, CA—may be viewed as one such region, as fan allegiance to either the San 
Francisco 49ers or Oakland Raiders may not be as clear-cut in Santa Clara County as it is in other regions of the Bay Area. "
120,5," With regard to a sufficiently pleaded  [**26] relevant market, the American Needle court noted the following: Our analysis is limited to the issues raised in defendants' motion to dismiss. As pointed out above, we have not determined 
whether the markets plaintiff alleges do in fact exist, thereby supporting its claims. We have found only that the law does 
not preclude an antitrust claim based on such markets. Even though plaintiff's market definitions do not fall due to reliance 
on NFL trademarks, they may still be improper. As indicated in our analysis, if the true product in this case is NFL teams' 
logos, not the items that carry them, then there may be no justification for limiting the relevant market to headwear and 
apparel that carry these logos. Perhaps, the market would more properly include all merchandise carrying NFL logos. Of 
course, this broader market definition would then alter the impact of the exclusive contract with Reebok, which is allegedly 
limited to the manufacture and distribution of headwear and apparel. Am. Needle, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 696. The Court adopts a similar sentiment in this case. This Order finds only that, taking as true 
the facts alleged in the Complaint, Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a relevant  [**27] market so as to withstand Defendants' 
Motion to Dismiss. "
123,, 
124,7," It appears that Defendants contends that a favorable outcome for plaintiffs in this case and the American Needle case would 
amount to ""duplicative recovery,"" which is the fourth of the AGC factors as enumerated by the Ninth Circuit in American Ad 
Management. 190 F.3d at 1054."
124,8," Defendants appear to concede this point: ""Plaintiff is correct that any recoveries by a former licensee for lost profits would not 
necessarily be duplicative of recoveries for damages by licensees, retailers, consumers, or others in the distribution chain."" 
Defs.' Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss 12, Docket Item No. 36 (internal citation omitted)."
124,9," In its Motion to Dismiss, Defendant appears to suggest that, despite the exclusive licensing agreement, NFL-licensed T-shirts 
are manufactured by at least one other company in addition to Reebok, namely a company called VF. As Plaintiff suggests, if 
Defendant can show that this is true and that Plaintiff purchased a product manufactured by VF, Defendant would still have to 
show that such a product was not subject to a premium due to the allegedly anticompetitive agreement. Such a determination 
would be better suited to resolution upon review of a fuller record. "
143,1," Defendant numbered its answers and counterclaims separately, thereby repeating paragraph numbers. [Doc. No. 9.] Unless 
otherwise noted, paragraph numbers referenced herein refer to counterclaims. "
144,2," In its motion, Plaintiff repeatedly conflates the pleading standard under Rule 8 with a requirement to plead with particularity. 
[See, e.g., Doc. No. 19, Pl.'s Mot., at 9, 10.] Even after Iqbal and Twombly the plausibility standard of Rule 8 does not require 
""the who, what, when, where, and how of the misconduct alleged."" See Cafasso, U.S. ex rel. v. General Dynamics C4 Systems, 
Inc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1055 (9th Cir. 2011). See also Quintana v. California-Osha, 1:12-CV-00822-LJO, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
137215, 2012 WL 4433798, at *3 (E.D. Cal. Sept. 24, 2012); Wanachek Mink Ranch v. Alaska Brokerage Int'l, Inc., C06-
089RSM, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43816, 2009 WL 1342676, at *3 (W.D. Wash. May 5, 2009); Cascades Computer Innovation 
LLC v. RPX Corp., 12-CV-01143 YGR, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10526, 2013 WL 316023, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 24, 2013); Coal. for 
a Sustainable Delta v. F.E.M.A., 711 F. Supp. 2d 1152, 1159 n.2 (E.D. Cal. 2010). "
145,3," Plaintiff's argument that Defendant fails to ""even identify if the alleged contract was written or oral,"" [Doc. No. 19, Pl.'s Mot., at 
9], cites no authority requiring such identification. Cf. James River Ins. Co. v. DCMI, Inc., C 11-06345 WHA, 2012 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 96808, 2012 WL 2873763, at *3 (N.D. Cal. July 12, 2012) (finding the allegation of existence of a ""written or verbal 
contract"" sufficient for a breach of contract claim). "
146,4," Plaintiff argues that Defendant's UCL claim fails because the pleading ""identifies 'no particular section of the [§ 17200] statutory 
scheme which was violated and fails to describe with reasonable particularity the facts supporting violation.'"" [Doc. No. 19-1, Pl.'s 
Mot., at 11 (citing Schwartz v. IndyMac Fed. Bank, 2:10-CV-00516, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75646, 2010 WL 2985480, at *4 (E.D. 
Cal. July 27, 2010).] However, the Schwartz court erroneously relies on a California state court action applying state pleading 
standards. Id. (citing Khoury v. Maly's of California, Inc., 14 Cal. App. 4th 612, 619, 17 Cal. Rptr. 2d 708 (1993). State pleading 
standards are inapplicable here. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938); Swierkiewicz v. 
Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 513, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002); 28 U.S.C. § 1652. "
149,5," The Court is aware of at least one district court holding to the contrary. See Newgent v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 09CV1525 
WQH, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18476, 2010 WL 761236, at *7 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 2, 2010) (granting a motion to dismiss a promissory 
estoppel claim under the rationale that ""[b]ecause Plaintiff was already legally obligated to make payments on her mortgage . . . 
the payment in reliance on the promise that Wells Fargo would delay the trustee's sale was not detrimental.""). While it is true that 
under California substantive law breach of contract and promissory estoppel ultimately depend on mutually exclusive findings of 
fact (i.e. consideration and lack of consideration), id. (citing Healy v. Brewster, 59 Cal. 2d 455, 463, 30 Cal. Rptr. 129, 380 P.2d 
817 (1963)), Newgent errs by applying this issue of proof at the pleading stage. Even though inconsistent findings of fact may 
not survive the proof stage, inconsistent claims are explicitly permitted at the pleading stage under Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 8(d)(3). "
150,6," While Plaintiff correctly points out that Defendant's subsequent assertion that it ""lost over $400,000,"" [Doc. No. 26, Def.'s Opp., 
at 19, n.4], may not be considered for the purpose of this motion because it represents a factual allegation outside of the 
pleadings, see Ritchie, 342 F.3d at 908, there is no requirement for such a specific allegation at the pleading stage. See 1849 
Condominiums Ass'n, Inc. v. Bruner, 2:09-CV-3339-JAM-EFB, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16017, 2011 WL 646390 at *3 (E.D. Cal. 
Feb. 17, 2011) (finding the pleading of damages ""according to proof at trial . . . sufficient to establish damages for this stage of 
the pleadings.""). "
153,1," ""Defendants"" are Pfizer Inc. and Warner-Lambert Co. (collectively ""Pfizer"" or Defendants)."
153,2," ""Plaintiffs"" are the certified direct purchaser class (""Class Plaintiffs""), opt-outs CVS Pharmacy, Inc., Rite Aid Corp. and Rite Aid 
HDQ TRS. Corp. (""CVS/Rite Aid"") and opt-outs Walgreen Co., The Kroger Co.,  [*3] Safeway Inc., American Sales Co., Inc., 
Supervalu Inc. and HEB Grocery Co. LP (""Walgreen"")."
153,3," The background of the instant litigation was set forth in detail in the Court's Opinions dated August 27, 2009, deciding Pfizer's 
motion to dismiss, dated January 25, 2011, granting Plaintiffs' motion for class certification, and dated August 10, 2011, granting 
in part and denying in part Class Plaintiffs' initial crime-fraud motion. The Court presumes familiarity with the facts and 
arguments summarized in those Opinions as well as the abbreviations and acronyms used therein. "
155,4," DS refers to Defendants Statement of Undisputed Facts and Plaintiffs' corresponding responses, ECF No. 593; PS refers to 
Plaintiffs' Revised Statement of Undisputed Material Facts and Defendants' corresponding responses, ECF No. 570; JS refers to 
the Joint Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, ECF No. 592. "
156,5," This Court summarized and rejected plaintiffs' additional direct evidence of market power as follows: Plaintiffs also offer the following as direct evidence of market power: (1) testimony of Plaintiffs' economic expert, Dr. Jeffrey 
Leitzinger that for a 3-year period prior to generic entry Remeron's price had increased from approximately $1.86 per tablet 
to approximately $2.29 per tablet, (2) Organon's internal documentation showing that Organon lost a significant percentage 
of its sales following generic entry, and (3) testimony of a Defense economic expert, Dr. Januz Ordover, that Organon had 
the ability to charge prices above short-run marginal cost prior to generic competition. Plaintiffs devote only a few 
sentences discussing these facts and offer no analysis about how these facts suffice to permit a reasonable juror to find 
monopoly power. As will be discussed, without evidence that sheds light on material factors such  [*14] as Organon's price 
relative to its total costs (marginal and fixed) and whether output was restricted, monopoly power cannot be found as a 
matter of law. See, e.g., PHILLIP E. AREEDA AND HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW, AN ANALYSIS OF 
ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION, p. 516 (2d ed. 2002) (""No matter how accurately measured, of 
course, a substantial excess of price over marginal cost does not necessarily bring excess returns on investment. A firm 
generates excess profit only if price exceeds its average total cost, including its cost of capital."") (emphasis added); William 
M. Landes and Richard A. Posner, Market Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 HARV. L. REV. 937, 939 (1981) (""When the 
deviation of price from marginal cost ... simply reflects certain fixed costs, there is no occasion for antitrust concern."")."
156,367, F. Supp. 2d at 681 n.10. 
159,6," Defendants also argued that Plaintiffs' request should not be granted because the case was on appeal, but the Court has since 
been notified that the First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the jury verdict following trial and Judge Saris's Findings of Fact and 
Conclusions of Law concerning Pfizer's off-label marketing of Neurontin. In re Neurontin Marketing and Sales Practices Litig., 
712 F.3d 21 (1st Cir. 2013)."
159,7," Judge Saris's findings included: ""[F]raudulent marketing activities took place during the following time periods for each 
indication: (1) bipolar disorder: July 1998 through December 2004; (2) neuropathic pain: November 1997 through December 
2004; (3) migraine: April 1999 through December 2004; and (4) doses greater than 1800 mg/day: November 1997 through 
December 2004."" (2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99593, [WL] at *12); ""Kaiser relied on defendants' fraudulent marketing activities 
during the following time periods for each indication: (1) bipolar disorder: June 1999 through December 2004; (2) neuropathic 
pain: September 1999 through December 2004; (3) migraine: September 1999 through December 2004; and (4) doses greater 
than 1800 mg/day: September 1999 through December 2004."" (2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99593, [WL] at *30); ""[T]here  [*26] is no 
reliable scientific evidence that Neurontin is effective for bipolar disorder, migraine, or at high doses. With respect to some kinds 
of neuropathic pain, there is some scientific evidence of efficacy. However, as the FDA found, there is no reliable scientific 
evidence to support a broad indication of neuropathic pain."" (2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99593, [WL] at *34); ""[T]he jury returned a 
verdict for Kaiser . . . finding that defendants engaged in fraudulent business acts or practices with respect to all off-label 
indications except nociceptive pain. The jury also found that those fraudulent acts or practices caused Kaiser damages with 
respect to all off-label indications except nociceptive pain. The Court agrees with the jury's conclusion."" (id. at 46). Judge Saris's 
findings of fact relating to the nature and scope of the off-label marketing were necessary to the finding of Pfizer's liability in that 
case such that Pfizer is estopped from denying them in this case. "
173,1," According to the records of the Registrar's Office, the property located at 6544 Tammy Cove, Memphis, Tennessee, was sold 
at a tax sale on January 9, 2013. (Clerk and Master's Tax Deed, Shelby County Register's No. 13028886.)"
173,2," Service of process cannot be made on unnamed or fictitious parties. The filing of a complaint against ""John Doe"" defendants 
does not toll the running of the statute of limitations against those parties. See Cox v. Treadway, 75 F.3d 230, 240 (6th Cir. 
1996); Bufalino v. Mich. Bell Tel. Co., 404 F.2d 1023, 1028 (6th Cir. 1968). Accordingly, it is recommended that the complaint be 
dismissed against the unnamed defendants ""Agents"" of MLG&W. "
174,3," Hayes is no stranger to federal litigation. Indeed, Hayes has filed at least nine pro se federal lawsuits in the last eight years (not 
 [**9] including any state lawsuits). Hayes is a former City of Memphis police officer. He filed a number of lawsuits against the 
City of Memphis that culminated in a settlement on January 20, 1999, pursuant to which in exchange for $643,000, Hayes 
agreed to resign his position with the Memphis Police Department (""MPD"") and release all claims related to his employment with 
MPD. These lawsuits included Hayes v. Herenton, No. 95-2969-MlV (W.D. Tenn.)(filed December 5, 1995); Hayes v. City of 
Memphis, No. 97-2197- MlV (W.D. Tenn.)(filed Mar. 5, 1997); and Hayes v. City of Memphis, No. 98-2319-MlV (W.D. 
Tenn.)(filed Apr. 8, 1998). After his settlement, Hayes filed other lawsuits: Hayes v. City of Memphis, No. 00-2560-MlA (W.D. 
Tenn.)(filed June 27, 2000); Hayes v. City of Memphis, No. 01-2695-GA (W.D. Tenn.)(filed Aug. 30, 2001). "
178,4," Hayes has not attached any of the purported EFTs to his complaint, and the court has no information regarding the EFTs other 
than the allegations in Hayes's complaint. "
179,5," Section 1601, cited by Hayes, sets forth the congressional findings and declaration of purpose and  [**26] is obviously not 
relevant. "
180,6, The complaint also contains a paragraph 43 on page 14. 
181,7," 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) provides: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, 
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through 
a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. "
187,1," Titanium dioxide (""TiO2"") is a ""dry chemical powder that is the world's most widely used pigment for providing whiteness, 
brightness, and opacity . . . to many products, particularly paints and other coatings."" See Mem. Op. Granting Mot. for Class 
Certification 2, ECF No. 337 (internal quotation omitted)."
187,2," This case was originally filed against five entities: DuPont, Huntsman, Kronos, Millennium, and the National Tioxide Company 
Limited. See Am. Consolidated Compl. (ECF No. 51). In addition, the Consolidated Complaint alleged that the following persons 
were co-conspirators, though they were not named as parties: Lyondell Chemical Company (""Lyondell""); Tronox; the consulting 
company International Business Management Associates, Inc. (""IBMA""); and James R. Fisher (""Fisher"" or ""Jim Fisher""), the 
President and Chief Executive Officer  [**6] of IBMA. Alleged co-conspirators Lyondell and Tronox were never named in this 
action, presumably because each filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in January 2009. 
Further, the Plaintiffs did not name IBMA or Jim Fisher as parties to this case. The National Titanium Dioxide Company Limited, 
which is domiciled in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, was dismissed from this action for lack of personal jurisdiction on March 31, 
2011. See Mot. Dismiss Op. & Order, ECF Nos. 103 & 104. Finally, on August 6, 2013, this Court ordered a stay of all "
188,," proceedings between the Class Plaintiffs, DuPont, and Huntsman, as those parties have reached agreements in principle to 
settle and release the class claims in this litigation, as against DuPont and Huntsman. See Stay Order, ECF No. 484. All told, the 
remaining Defendants in this case are Millennium and Kronos."
188,3," The Defendants' pending Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings, Dismiss for Improper Venue, Strike Jury 
Demands, and Amend the Class Definition (ECF No. 423) will be addressed in a separate Memorandum Opinion."
188,4," Tronox is a former subsidiary of Kerr-McGee Corporation (""Kerr-McGee""). This Memorandum Opinion refers to the company as 
Tronox and Kerr-McGee interchangeably. "
190,5, ISK is not involved in this action. 
191,6," See Pls.' App. B at effective date 3/1/2002. Because titanium dioxide contracts were individually negotiated, the announced 
price or ""list price"" was often different from the price that customers actually paid. Nevertheless, the price increase 
announcements may be indicative of collusion, because an agreement to fix prices is a Section 1 violation, regardless of 
whether defendants are successful in charging those prices. In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., 385 F.3d 350, 362-62 (3d Cir. 2004) 
(""[A] horizontal agreement to fix prices need not succeed for  [**20] sellers to be liable under the Sherman Act."" (citing United 
States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 224, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 nn.59, 60 (1940)))."
191,7," By nearly parallel, this Court refers to sets of price increase announcements in which the amounts differed by $0.01 or $0.02 
cents, or where a pigment producer's announced increase was to be effective on a later date. See, e.g., Pls.' App. B at effective 
dates 6/15/2004 (all pigment producers but Kronos announcing a price increase of $0.04 per pound, to be effective on June 15, 
2004) & 7/1/2004 (Kronos announcing a price increase of $0.04, effective July 1, 2004, just after the other four pigment 
producers). "

192,14," See id. at effective date 9/1/2010. It is noteworthy that Huntsman, a self-described ""small fry"" among producers of titanium 
dioxide, had the lowest United States market share of any of the original five Defendants during the Class Period. Huntsman

198,15," Defendants' Appendix B is attached to their Joint Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 443. "
201,16," The Matsushita standard has likewise been applied in cases alleging illegal restraints of trade other than price-fixing, such as 
the alleged agreement to boycott at issue in Merck-Medco Managed Care, LLC v. Rite Aid Corp., 201 F.3d 436 (4th Cir. 
1999) (unpublished table decision). "
205,17," See generally Pls.' App. B. Twenty of the twenty-five parallel price increases involved identical amounts. In five sets of 
increases, one or two of the pigment producers announced a price increase that differed by $0.01 or $0.02 cents per pound. Id."
205,18," Comparing the Class Period to the prior eight years, it is noteworthy that Kronos rescinded a price increase  [**75] in 
September 1994. See PX 92. "
213,1," This bylaw has been rescinded. [Dkt. 46 at 13 ¶ 54.] Because Mr. Rock seeks damages for actions taken before the bylaw was 
rescinded, its repeal does not render this case nonjusticiable. See Agnew, 683 F.3d at 332 (""Since plaintiffs seek damages for 
prior actions taken by the NCAA and its member schools, the repeal of the multi-year scholarship prohibition does not render this 
case nonjusticiable.""). "
214,2," Mr. Rock's initial complaint was joined by two former Division III student-athletes who challenged the NCAA's rule prohibiting 
athletics-based financial aid in Division III athletics. The Court ultimately concluded that one of those plaintiffs failed to allege 
direct antitrust injury, [dkt. 38 at 10-11], and that although the other had standing to challenge the rule, the prohibition on 
athletics-based financial aid in Division III athletics was presumptively procompetitive as a matter of law, [id. at 22]. "
218,3," The Court ultimately finds Mr. Rock's proposed relevant market plausible at this stage of the litigation. See infra, Part III.D. "
219,4, FBS used to be called Division I-A. [Dkt. 48 at 17 n. 10.] 
220,5," The NCAA again argues that professional football could be a plausible substitute for Division I football, [dkt. 48 at 18 n. 11], but 
the Court has previously rejected that argument because there has been no assertion that professional football offers an 
opportunity for the participant to obtain a bachelor's degree, which is a key part of the market allegations at issue in this litigation, 
[dkt. 38 at 15 n.6]. Likewise, it does not appear that junior colleges are a plausible substitute because as Mr. Rock alleges, and 
the NCAA does not dispute, unlike Division I schools, junior colleges cannot award bachelor's degrees. [Dkt. 46 at 8 ¶ 26.] To 
the extent that the NCAA proposes  [*31] Division III football as a potential substitute for Division I football, [dkt. 48 at 19], that 
argument fails because Division III schools abide by an NCAA bylaw, which the Court has already upheld as a matter of law, 
[dkt. 38 at 19-22], prohibiting them from awarding athletics-based scholarships. That is a material distinction for purposes of this 
litigation, given that Mr. Rock's lawsuit revolves around obtaining athletics-based scholarships. "
221,6," In fact, the majority of cases the NCAA cites involve market definition analysis in the context of an injunction, summary 
judgment, or after trial. The procedural context of those cases does not assume the truth of a plaintiff's factual allegations and, 
instead, requires a plaintiff to present evidence in support of his claims. See, e.g., Hammel v. Eau Galle Cheese Factory, 407 
F.3d 852, 859 (7th Cir. 2005) (""Summary judgment is not a dress rehearsal or practice run; it is the put up or shut up moment in 
a lawsuit, when a party must show what evidence it has that would convince a trier of fact to accept its version of the events.""). 
Thus, those cases are of limited use at this stage of the litigation."
221,7," Of course it is possible that the commercial realities of the marketplace  [*36] have changed since the statements cited in this 
paragraph were made, but these post-trial court findings lend plausibility to Mr. Rock's allegation at this stage of the litigation that 
neither Division II football nor NAIA football are adequate substitutes for Division I football. "
222,8," The NCAA argues that ""there is not a simple bright line dividing FCS and non-Division I football opportunities"" based on their 
respective revenues. [Dkt. 48 at 16.] But the Court cannot make that determination as a matter of law on a motion to dismiss. In 
other words, even if the NCAA is correct that some FCS teams generate revenue similar to successful Division II schools, [id. at 
16-17], Mr. Rock alleges that additional benefits come with being part of Division I football, and the Court will accept that 
allegation as true for purposes of ruling on the pending motion. "
223,9," Although the NCAA ""respectfully continues to assert"" that the bylaws at issue are ""presumptively procompetitive,"" [dkt. 48 at 25 
n.22], the Court again rejects that argument based on Agnew, [dkt. 38 at 7 n.3 (citing 683 F.3d at 345 (holding that the bylaws at 
issue ""cannot be deemed procompetitive at the motion-to-dismiss stage""))]. "
231,1," Plaintiffs argue that Doctors Health, Inc. V. Aetna, 605 F. 3d 1146 (11th Cir. 2010) supports a contrary result. However, in 
Doctor's Health, the claims were not Released Claims because, inter alia, unlike the plaintiffs in Shane, the plaintiff alleged that 
the HMO manager overpaid medical providers. Importantly,  [*19] the claim pursued by Doctors Health in the adversary action 
shared no factual basis with the Shane complaint. In contrast, just like in Love, the Conway complaint alleges Defendants 
underpaid medical providers by conspiring, through BCBSA, to use their market power to force providers to provide services on 
Defendants' terms."
231,2," Defendants additionally argue that the claims in Conway are Released Claims under the second part of the first prong, i.e., 
because they are ""arising out of"" or are ""in any way related to""... (ii) ""the business practices that are the subject of § 7"" of the 
Settlement Agreements. See Love, D.E. 928 at § 13.1(a). The Court does  [*20] not reach this argument as the Conway claims 
are clearly Released Claims under the first part of the first prong (the claims are ""arising out of"" or are ""in any way related to"" (i) 
""any of the facts, events, transactions, occurrences, courses of conduct, business practices, representations, omissions, 
circumstances, or other matters referenced"" in Love...."") and are therefore barred. Id. "
233,3," Plaintiffs cite Hold v. Manzini, 736 So. 2d 138, 141-42 (Fla. 3d DCA 1999) and Scheck v. Burger King Corp., 756 F. Supp. 543, 
547 (S.D. Fla. 1991) for the proposition that a general release cannot be applied to bar claims that have not yet accrued at the 
time the release was executed. However, these decisions  [*26] relate to claims that could not have been brought at the time the 
releases at issue were signed, unlike the claims in Conway. "
241,1," At Wells Fargo's request, the trial court judicially noticed various documents including plaintiffs' deed of trust recorded in April 
2008,  [***3] a notice of default recorded in January 2009, a notice of trustee's sale recorded in April 2009, and the trustee's 
deed upon sale recorded in April 2010."
241,2," “As authorized by Congress, the United States Department of the Treasury implemented the … HAMP … to help homeowners 
avoid foreclosure during the housing market crisis of 2008. ‘The goal of HAMP is to provide relief to borrowers who have 
defaulted on their mortgage payments or who are likely to default by reducing mortgage payments to sustainable levels, without 
discharging any of the underlying debt.’ ” (West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780, 785 [154 Cal. Rptr. 
3d 285].) Treasury guidelines set forth threshold criteria to define the class of eligible borrowers, and those guidelines set forth 
accounting steps using a standardized net present value test to determine whether it is more profitable to modify the loan or to 
allow it to proceed to foreclosure. (Nungaray v. Litton Loan Servicing, LP (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1499, 1502 [135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
442].) “Calculations under HAMP involve assigning values to certain variables  [***5] that are largely within the servicers' 
discretion, thus precluding any entitlement to loan modifications.” (Id. at fn. 1.) "
245,3," In Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., the plaintiff alleged that after an accident, an unnamed claims adjustor for State 
Farm told her she was authorized to use a local dealership for auto repairs but that State Farm later refused to pay for them. 
(Tarmann v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., supra, 2 Cal.App.4th at pp. 156–157.)  [***22] The plaintiff had “generally alleged 
that the persons were ‘authorized agents of State Farm … cloaked with such authority’ and were ‘adjustors and/or claims 
supervisors/managers[.]’ However, she specifically alleged she did not know their names.” (Id. at pp. 157–158, fn. omitted.) The 
Court of Appeal declined in that instance to hold State Farm necessarily possessed full information concerning the facts, and 
would not relax the strict pleading requirements for fraud against a corporation in the face of those allegations, stating “… State 
Farm has no more reason to know who made the allegedly false representations to Tarmann than Tarmann.” (Id. at p. 158.) "
247,4," HN9[
] The elements of negligent misrepresentation are the same as those for fraud with the exception of the knowledge 
requirement, which requires a defendant's representation to be made without reasonable ground for believing it to be true. (West 
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., supra, 214 Cal.App.4th at p. 792.) "
248,5," The court in Jolley agreed that “ ‘Nymark and the cases cited therein do not purport to state a legal principle that a lender can 
never be held liable for negligence in its handling of a loan transaction within its conventional role as a lender of money.’ ” 
(Jolley, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 902.) It acknowledged the California Legislature's ameliorative efforts to assist homeowners 
at risk of losing their homes and cited the existence and strengthening of those legislative measures as “demonstrat[ing] a rising 
trend to require lenders to deal reasonably with borrowers in default to try to effectuate a workable loan modification” and used 
them as an indication courts “should not rely mechanically on the ‘general rule’ that lenders owe no duty of care to their 
borrowers.” (Id. at p. 903.) Though the court conceded the recently enacted laws against dual tracking did not apply, it 
nevertheless held that legislation “set[] forth  [***34] policy considerations that should affect the assessment whether a duty of 
care was owed to [the plaintiff] at that time.” (Id. at p. 905.) Thus, it concluded the trial court erred: that triable issues of fact 
existed as to the relevant considerations underlying a duty of care, which precluded judgment as a matter of law in Chase's 
favor. (Id. at p. 906.) "

297,1," This MDL action  [*4] was reassigned from the Judge Hibbler's docket to this Court's docket on April 30, 2012. Earlier this year, 
the Court issued a ruling on the motion to dismiss filed by the one remaining Direct Purchaser Plaintiff (Schreiber Foods) [see 
314]. The remaining Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs have filed a motion for preliminary approval of their settlement [327], to which 
Schreiber has objected [see 339, 341, 344, 354]. Those matters concerning the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs remain pending and 
will be addressed in a separate order. The principal difference between ""direct"" purchasers and ""indirect"" purchasers is that 
indirect purchasers purchased products from a person or company that is not one of the defendants, whereas direct purchasers 
purchased directly from the defendants. This opinion relates solely to the motions seeking dismissal of the Indirect Purchaser 
claims."
297,2," The motion to set aside default was brought in the Kansas Indirect Purchaser Action and was filed with the transferor court. 
The motion has never been filed on this Court's docket. Furthermore, the parties make passing reference to other motions to set 
aside Keller's default, presumably also brought before transferor courts.  [*5] To the extent that there are any additional pending 
motions to set aside default that were filed in the transferor courts and that rest on the same arguments and authority as the 
Kansas motion, the Court's ruling applies equally to those motions. As a matter of efficient docket management, the parties are 
directed to re-file any motions previously filed before another court on this Court's docket. "
299,3," While the Rudman/Palombella and Waun complaints assert three federal antitrust claims for injunctive relief (Count I-III) and 
claims for damages under state statutes (Count IV) and the common law of unjust enrichment (Count V), the Asmann complaint 
brings only state law claims for antitrust violations (Counts I and II) and unjust  [*11] enrichment (Count III)."
299,4," Judge Hibbler's memorandum opinion and order of February 4, 2011, sets forth a detailed factual history, which the Court 
adopts and incorporates in this opinion. Thus, the Court only briefly recounts the facts alleged in Plaintiffs' complaints."
299,5," In ruling on the direct purchasers' motion to dismiss, the Court previously found that the direct purchasers complaint sufficiently 
alleged that (1) the markets for Milk Futures contracts for June, July and August 2004 were relevant markets; (2) Defendants 
had market power; and (3) Defendants wrongfully acquired that market power. To the extent that these conclusions, as well as 
additional conclusions found in Judge Hibbler's prior ruling, apply to the indirect purchasers' allegations, the law-of-the-case 
doctrine applies, as the law-of-the-case presumption holds when a case is reassigned from one judge to another. See Minch v. 
City of Chicago, 486 F.3d 294, 301 (7th Cir. 2007) (""Among other things, the law of the case doctrine embodies the notion that a 
court ought not to re-visit an earlier ruling in a case absent a compelling reason, such as manifest error or a change in the law, 
that warrants re-examination.""); Brengettcy v. Horton, 423 F.3d 674, 680 (7th Cir. 2005); Mendenhall v. Mueller Streamline Co., "
300,419," F.3d 686, 691 (7th Cir. 2005) (""In situations where a different member of  [*14] the same court re-examines a prior ruling, 
the law of the case doctrine * * * reflects the rightful expectation of litigants that a change of judges midway through a case will 
not mean going back to square one"") (internal quotations omitted). "
303,6," Although Plaintiff Palombella resides in Massachusetts, she does not allege that she purchased any products in 
Massachusetts. "
304,7," Section 16 provides: ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any 
court of the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust 
laws[.]"" 15 U.S.C. § 26."
304,8," Although Illinois Brick dealt with indirect purchaser suits seeking damages (see U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Indiana Gas Co., 350 F.3d 
623, 627 (7th Cir. 2003) (""[T]he direct-purchaser doctrine does not foreclose equitable relief.""), and Plaintiffs  [*32] here seek 
only injunctive relief for their federal antitrust claims, subsequent cases also analyze the directness of the injury when only 
equitable relief is sought. See, e.g., Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 734 Health & Welfare Trust Fund v. Philip Morris Inc., 196 
F.3d 818, 825 (7th Cir. 1999) (noting that the ""direct-purchaser doctrine of Illinois Brick and the direct-injury doctrine of 
Associated General Contractors are analytically distinct"" and are ""independent obstacle[s] to recovery""); In re Plasma-Derivative 
Protein Therapies, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2501, 2012 WL 39766, at *8."
304,9," In AGC, the Supreme Court also held that courts examining antitrust standing are to consider the type of injury and whether it is 
""of the type that the antitrust statute was intended to forestall."" 459 U.S. at 538- 39 (citing Brunswick, 429 U.S. at 487-88). The 
Court will consider this factor under the rubric of antitrust injury, as the Seventh Circuit has structured its analysis of antitrust 
injury and antitrust standing in this manner. See Kochert, 463 F.3d at 715-719 (analyzing  [*34] antitrust injury prior to the 
antitrust standing factors set out in AGC ); Serfecz, 67 F.3d at 596-97 (examining antitrust injury and antitrust standing 
separately); Local Beauty Supply, Inc. v. Lamaur Inc., 787 F.2d 1197, 1201 (7th Cir.1986) (distinguishing between the 
requirements of antitrust injury and antitrust standing). "
305,10," In general, ""[p]assing on describes the action of an overcharged buyer who passes the extra expense on to those who buy 
from him."" In re Sugar Industry Antitrust Litig., 579 F.2d 13, 16 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). The 
""passing-on"" theory has been invoked in one of two ways: ""Defensive passing on refers to efforts by antitrust defendants to show 
that a particular plaintiff was not injured because he had foisted the inflated price onto his own customers. Offensive passing on 
is used to characterize  [*38] plaintiffs' strategy proving that an overcharge was imposed upon them by buyers closer to the 
defendant in the chain of distribution."" Id. (internal quotations omitted); see also Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen Inc., 643 F.3d 77, 
85 (3d Cir. 2011). "
306,11," As a threshold matter, Judge Hibbler previously held that the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs may only recover for damages caused 
by Defendants' monopolization of the milk futures market. Accordingly, the Court permitted claims to go forward for Plaintiffs 
whose injuries stem from the anticompetitive effects of monopolization on the milk futures market, including ""purchasers of milk 
futures during months besides June, July, and August 2004 * * * [and] any Plaintiffs who entered into contracts whose value was 
directly tied to the price of milk futures will also be allowed to proceed."" The Court denied recovery for damages arising from the 
increase of prices in the cheddar spot market because they ""stem from the collateral manipulation of the cheese markets."" Here, 
Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs allege that both facets of Defendants' scheme injured them, as they purchased products whose 
prices were determined by both the cheese spot and milk futures markets. But, contrary to Plaintiffs' mistaken assumption, Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs also include both cheese and milk commodities buyers at the wholesale level.  [*40] See Direct Purchaser 
Compl. ¶¶ 26, 28. Thus, Plaintiffs are not claiming a new category of injuries as they suggest, and they have not put forth any 
additional reasons for departing from Judge Hibbler's prior ruling. Judge Hibbler previously rejected the claims of Direct 
Purchasers of milk and cheese not indexed to the CME (based on the filed-rate doctrine) and the monopolization claims of 
purchasers whose injuries stem from the inflated price of cheese for lack of standing. Because Plaintiffs have offered no support 
for departing from Judge Hibbler's prior rulings other than one based on a mistaken assumption about the identity of Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs, Judge Hibbler's prior holdings remain law of the case. See Creek v. Village of Westhaven, 144 F.3d 441, 
445 (7th Cir. 1998) (""The law of the case doctrine is a rule of practice, based on sound policy that, when an issue is once 
litigated and decided, that should be the end of the matter.""). "
307,12," In their response to Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Asmann Plaintiffs set up an almost identical scenario: Here, the Petition alleges Defendants manipulated the index that is used to set the price for the products that Plaintiff 
purchased. Consequently, the price that retailers paid DFA for those products was increased and those retailers in turn 
increased their prices to the general public, including Plaintiff. In particular, Defendants purchased all the contracts on the 
Cheddar Spot market with the purpose and effect of raising the prices that DFA received for its products that use the "
308,," Cheddar Spot market as the basis for their prices. Plaintiff's payment of higher prices for those products has been caused 
by the exact conduct forbidden by [antitrust statutes]."
308,13," As discussed above, the fact that the alleged conspiracy operated in the separate but related futures market does not 
necessarily doom the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' claims; however, it is a fact that the casual connection is even more 
attenuated and complicated here than in the typical indirect purchaser case because the allegedly price-fixed products are not 
components of the finished goods. "
309,14," Defendants have asked in their briefing that the dismissal be with prejudice and without leave to attempt to replead given that 
the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs already have had an original and two amended complaints; Plaintiffs request that the Court sua 
sponte grant leave to replead in the event of  [*55] a dismissal order. The Court adopts a middle ground: if, after reviewing the 
Court's decision, the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs believe that they have a viable basis to replead, they may file a motion 
requesting leave to do so. "
312,1," The DAPs have filed six amended complaints: Publix Super Markets, Inc. filed a second amended complaint on March 1, 2013; 
Supervalu, Inc. filed a second amended complaint on March 1, 2013; Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets,  [*3] Inc., 
C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Co. (the ""Winn-Dixie Plaintiffs"") filed a third amended complaint on March 1, 2013; 
Kraft Foods Global, Inc., Kellogg Co., General Mills, Inc., and Nestle USA, Inc. (the ""Kraft Plaintiffs"") filed a second amended 
complaint on March 6, 2013; Giant Eagle, Inc. filed a second amended complaint on March 7, 2013; and Kroger Co., Safeway, 
Inc., Walgreen Co., Hy-Vee, Inc., Albertsons LLC, The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., H.E. Butt Grocery Co., and Conopco, 
Inc. (the ""Kroger Plaintiffs"") filed a second amended complaint on March 8, 2013. "
313,2," Although  [*6] certain plaintiffs have stated that judicial estoppel cannot apply if inconsistent positions are taken in the same 
proceeding, see Docket No. 824 at 38-40, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected this contention. See In re Teleglobe 
Commc'ns Corp., 493 F.3d 345, 377 (3d Cir. 2007)."
313,3," Although the Court declines to apply judicial estoppel, it does note that the Defendants may use discovery to inquire into 
inconsistencies in the Plaintiffs' complaints. "
314,4," The parties agree that, in the absence of fraudulent concealment, the Plaintiffs may not recover claims for damages that 
accrued before September 24, 2004. See, e.g., Docket No. 827 at 2 (arguing that the DPPs ""should be permitted to pursue 
damages that pre-date the September 24, 2004 commencement of the limitations period""). "
315,5," The Plaintiffs generally allege that members of the UEP, acting under the pretense of concern for animal welfare, collectively 
used the Certified Program to house fewer hens per cage and thereby curtail the supply of domestic eggs. See, e.g., Publix 
Cmplt. at ¶¶ 132-37."
315,6," Various plaintiffs, including the DPPs, also argue that ""it is Defendants' burden to show the existence of any 'storm warnings' 
that should have prompted Plaintiffs' inquiry."" See, e.g., Docket No. 827 at 12. These plaintiffs are correct that, in determining 
whether inquiry notice exists at the summary judgment stage of a RICO case, a defendant must show that storm warnings 
existed before a plaintiff must prove  [*16] that it exercised due diligence. See Mathews, 260 F.3d at 252. Here, however, the 
Court is not weighing whether the parties have satisfied their evidentiary burdens. Moreover, the Court will not, as certain 
plaintiffs suggest, rely on the legal arguments presented in the Defendants' Statement of Law to evaluate the sufficiency of a 
complaint's factual allegations. See, e.g., Docket No. 825 at 26 (claiming that the Defendants' ""motion to dismiss is defeated by 
their Statement of Law""). The question before the Court is whether, irrespective of what the evidence may eventually prove or 
what the Defendants have written in their Statement of Law, the Plaintiffs have adequately pled that they exercised reasonable 
diligence in uncovering their claims. The DPPs' vague allegations that they acted with appropriate diligence by taking 
unspecified ""reasonable steps"" falls short of this standard. "
317,7, The Defendants do not argue that Giant Eagle's diligence allegations fail to satisfy Rule 9(b). See Docket No. 805 at 19 n.10.
317,8," In their briefing, the DAPs note that Appleton Electric Co. v. Graves Truck Line, Inc., 635 F.2d 603 (7th Cir. 1980), held that 
""where a class action suit is instituted against a class of unnamed defendants . . . the statute of limitations is tolled as to all "
318,," putative members of the defendant class."" See id. at 609-10. However, the Appleton court faced a ""true conflict between the 
operation of the statute of limitations and Rule 23,"" and believed that a contrary holding would ""sound the death knell"" for 
defendant class actions. See id. The instant matter  [*25] involves an entirely different calculus, because the Plaintiffs are not 
suing a class of defendants under Rule 23. Additionally, the Court recognizes that the original class complaints did allege that unnamed co-conspirators were involved in the 
alleged conspiracy, but finds that such generalized allegations were insufficient to put Sparboe and Weaver Bros. on notice of 
the claims against them. Compare Brief of the Kraft Plaintiffs, Docket No. 825 at 38 (arguing that Sparboe had adequate notice 
because it ""knew, or reasonably should have known, that it had potential liability when the original class action complaints were 
filed""), with Wyser-Pratte, 413 F.3d at 568 (rejecting such an argument). The DAPs' claim that Weaver Bros. had ""notice of the 
class action and the likelihood that [it] could be named as [a] Defendant[],"" see Docket No. 824 at 34 n.14, falls particularly flat, 
given that in the absence of Giant Eagle's suit, Weaver Bros. would not even be a defendant in this matter. "
324,1," Section 3 of the Clayton Act provides: It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or 
contract for sale of goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities, whether patented or 
unpatented, for use, consumption, or resale within the United States or any Territory thereof or the District of Columbia or 
any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States, or fix a price charged therefor, or discount 
from, or rebate upon, such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser thereof shall 
not use or deal in  [*16] the goods, wares, merchandise, machinery, supplies, or other commodities of a competitor or 
competitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or such condition, agreement, or 
understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce."
324,15, U.S.C. § 14. 
327,2," ""The relevant market has both a product and a geographic dimension."" Republic Tobacco Co. v. North Atlantic Trading Co. 
Inc., 381 F.3d 717, 738 (7th Cir. 2004). ""Identifying a geographic market requires both, 'careful selection of the market area in 
which the seller operates, and to which the purchaser can practicably turn for supplies.'"" Id. (quoting Tampa Electric Co. v. 
Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 327, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961)). At this point in the proceedings, the relevant 
geographic market is not in dispute. "
328,3," Plaintiff also heavily relies on a consent judgment which resulted from claims similar to plaintiff's in United States and State of 
Texas v. United Regional Health Care System, 7:11-cv-00030 (N.D. Tex. 2011), (Complaint, Final Judgment, and Competitive 
Impact Statement available at http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases). The matters in this cited proceeding, however, were not 
adjudicated by a court on the merits on any issue of fact or law, and are not authoritative or controlling. See Beatrice Foods Co. 
v. F.T.C., 540 F.2d 303, 312 (7th Cir. 1976) (""The entering of a consent decree, . . . , is not a decision on the merits and 
therefore does not adjudicate the legality of any action by a party thereto.""). "
329,4," SIH asserts that plaintiff has not adequately plead coercion, and has merely established that SIH and BCBSI negotiated a 
contract provision that provided BCBSI members with larger discounts for SIH's inpatient and outpatient services in exchange for 
a limitation on BCBSI's ability to enter into contracts  [*35] with non-SIH providers of outpatient services in a limited area. Plaintiff "
330,," responds that it has sufficiently alleged coercion through its allegations that SIH has a more than 75% share of the market for 
acute care services and the ability to coerce BCBSI economically to agree not to provide in-network insurance coverage of 
outpatient surgical services provided by plaintiff and other competitors."
330,5," As noted infra, plaintiff's Illinois Antitrust Act claims are subject to the same analysis as its federal claims, and its state law tying 
claim, Count VII, is dismissed on the same basis as the substantially similar federal claim. "
339,1," Plaintiff ELG Inglewood LLC (""ELG"") also sued the unions (Count II), alleging similar actions with respect to a related 
commercial real estate development. As discussed below, those claims were dismissed in part, and ELG has since waived 
decision on its appeal."
339,2," See United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); E. R.R. Presidents 
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961)."
339,3," We recite the facts here as a prelude to deciding whether Noerr-Pennington warrants dismissal of the claims. For reasons 
described below, we treat the district court's dismissal as a grant of summary judgment to the unions, and therefore consider all 
facts and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to WCS, the non-moving party. Bonds v. Leavitt, 629 F.3d 
369, 380 (4th Cir. 2011). "
340,4," As to ELG's Count II, the district court concluded that one of the three underlying legal proceedings allegedly instigated by the 
unions was objectively baseless. Accordingly, the court granted the unions' motion to dismiss as to two of the three alleged 
'sham' suits, but allowed this one portion of Count II to survive. "
341,5," In IGEN Int'l, the defendant Roche Diagnostics GmbH failed to raise the Noerr-Pennington doctrine until after the district court 
denied its motion to dismiss. 335 F.3d at 308-10. On appeal, Roche challenged the district court's decision to deny its Noerr-
Pennington argument as untimely. While conceding that ""[t]his circuit has previously characterized Noerr-Pennington as an 
affirmative defense,"" the panel nonetheless stated in dicta that ""Roche was not required to plead [Noerr-Pennington]  [**13] as 
an affirmative defense."" Id. at 311. We, however, remain bound by our earlier precedent that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is an affirmative defense. See 
McMellon v. United States, 387 F.3d 329, 333 (4th Cir. 2004). "
342,6," These documents principally concerned the underlying administrative and state court proceedings and consisted of permit 
applications, legal filings, administrative hearings, judicial orders, deposition excerpts, and affidavits. The unions attached these 
materials to their motion to dismiss, as did WCS to their response to that motion. "
344,7," While the parties fully briefed and argued this issue in the court below, WCS has not pressed for a different sham litigation 
standard on appeal. Nevertheless, ""we possess the discretion under appropriate circumstances to disregard the parties' 
inattention to a particular argument or issue."" United States v. Ashford, 718 F.3d 377, 380, 2013 WL 3069778 (4th Cir. 2013) 
(internal quotations omitted). In order to properly assess  [**24] whether WCS's complaint should be dismissed because of the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine, we believe it is necessary to apply the correct sham litigation standard, and we exercise our 
discretion to do so. "
345,," At oral argument, the unions sensed our inclination to sua sponte address this question, and requested that we allow 
supplemental briefing on this point. We deny this request, as we have reviewed the parties' briefing at the district court on this 
issue and find it more than sufficient."
345,8," ""Although we could remand to the district court for reconsideration under the appropriate standard of review, doing so would 
serve no useful purpose. . . . The validity vel non of a summary judgment entails a pure question of law and, therefore, we are 
fully equipped to resolve the question as a matter of first-instance appellate review."" Piccicuto v. Dwyer, 39 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 
1994). "
347,9," We disagree with the unions that either Racetrac Petroleum, Inc. v. Prince George's County, 601 F. Supp. 892 (D. Md. 1985), 
aff'd on its reasoning, 786 F.2d 202 (4th Cir. 1986), or Pendleton Construction Corp. v. Rockbridge County, Virginia, 652 F. 
Supp. 312 (W.D. Va. 1987), aff'd on its reasoning, 837 F.2d 178 (4th Cir. 1988), stand for such a proposition. These cases 
neither involved a pattern of litigation nor adopted the suggestion that litigation cannot be sham where a litigant ultimately 
received a fair adjudication. In fact, we rejected such a literal conception of access-barring in Hosp. Building Co. v. Trs. of Rex 
Hosp., concluding  [**33] that access-barring occurs ""if the proof establishes . . . intent to delay approval of HBC's application for 
a certificate of need and thereby delay its entrance into the Raleigh market."" 691 F.2d 678, 687 (4th Cir. 1982) (emphasis 
added). "
351,*, This matter is being decided by a quorum. 28 U.S.C. § 46(d). 
353,1," See also Terry v. Tyson Farms, Inc., 604 F.3d 272, 277 (6th Cir. 2010) (""The tide  [**8] has now become a tidal wave . . . . All 
told, seven circuits—the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits—have now weighed in on this issue, 
with unanimous results."") (citing cases)."
353,2," HN5[
] Even the dissent in Wheeler conceded a requirement of anti-competitive effect in § 192(e): ""Subsections (c)-(e) [of §"
353,192," ], unlike subsections (a) and (b), prohibit only those acts[] which have the effect of 'restraining commerce' or which produce 
another common antitrust injury, such as 'creating a monopoly.'"" See Wheeler, 591 F.3d at 374 (Garza, J., dissenting). Although 
divided as to the meaning of § 192 (a)-(b), the Wheeler en banc court was thus unanimous that § 192(e) is not violated absent a 
 [**9] showing of anti-competitive conduct."
353,3," See, e.g., Schreiber v. Burlington Northern, Inc., 472 U.S. 1, 12, 105 S. Ct. 2458, 86 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985) (""We hold that the term 
'manipulative' as used in [Securities Exchange Act] § 14(e) requires misrepresentation or nondisclosure. It connotes 'conduct 
designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities.'"" (citation omitted)); Ernst & 
Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 199, 96 S. Ct. 1375, 47 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1976) (""['Manipulative'] connotes intentional or willful

354,8," This is not the type of pro-competitive business justification which arguably must be properly pled as an affirmative defense to a 
prima facie showing of anti-competitive conduct. See NCAA v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 113, 104 S. Ct. 
2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). This is merely evidence relevant to whether there was any underlying anti-competitive conduct to 
begin with. See American Needle, 130 S.Ct. at 2216-17."
354,9," See American Needle, 130 S.Ct. at 2216 n.10 (recognizing that even a devious intention will not necessarily de-legitimize an 
otherwise permissible act, ""'because knowledge of intent [is to] help the court to interpret facts and  [**14] to predict 
consequences.'"" (quoting Bd. of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238, 38 S. Ct. 242, 62 L. Ed. 683 (1918))."
354,10," See PAUL A. SAMUELSON, ECONOMICS 56-60 (11th ed. 1980)."
354,11," We separately note that the district court found that PPC did not violate PSA § 192(a) because it did not engage in any ""unfair"" 
or ""deceptive"" practices. As some courts have described this provision as the PSA's ""catchall,"" it would be anomalous to 
conclude that PPC did not do anything unfair or deceptive, but that it did illegitimately attempt to manipulate or control prices. 
See Been v. O.K. Indus., Inc., 495 F.3d 1217, 1229 (10th Cir. 2007). While a better argument could be made that PPC violated the PSA by intentionally creating a chicken supply shortage, nothing 
in the record supports that assertion. Moreover, in the months following the El Dorado facility's idling, the total domestic supply of 
commodity chicken actually increased. Thus, the chicken processing industry either had enough new entrants or enough unused 
capacity to immediately compensate for any supply shortage created by PPC. "
358,1," Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act establish a private right of action for a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Thus the 
Clayton Act claim will stand or fall with the Sherman Act claim. Similarly, Illinois law directs a district court to ""use the 
construction of the federal law by the federal courts as a guide in construing [the Illinois Antitrust Act]"" when ""the wording [of the 
Act] is identical or similar to that of federal antitrust law."" 740 ILCS 10/11. Therefore, the Illinois Antitrust Act claim will stand or 
fall with the Sherman Act claim as well. See, e.g., DSM Desotech, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5980, 2009 WL 174989, at *12 
(""Because Desotech has stated valid claims for attempted monopolization under section 2 of the Sherman Act . . . Desotech has 
likewise stated a valid claim under 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/3.""). "
361,2," Specifically, the Complaint alleges that AB Sciex entered into a ""Consent to Transfer and Assignment of Licenses to Certain AB 
Software"" letter agreement with De Lage Landen Financial Services, Inc. (""DLL'). Under the agreement DLL purchased AB Sciex 
mass spectrometers. DLL would then lease these instruments to consumers. It also would provide financing services to 
consumers who wished to purchase an AB Sciex instrument. When a lease term ended, DLL would then sell the used 
instrument on the secondary market. It often engaged third party sellers, like IET, to handle these sales. Under the letter 
agreement, a reseller engaged by DLL was permitted to sell an AB Sciex mass spectrometer to a customer with the software 
license loaded onto the spectrometer. In other words, AB Sciex was contractually prohibited from charging a licensing fee to 
customers who purchased from IET provided that  [*22] IET was selling a mass spectrometer on behalf of DLL. Despite the 
exemption, AB Sciex threatened to impose the site license fee in connection with two potential sales by IET. "
365,3," Regardless of whether IET is able to plead a federal antitrust claim eventually, the Court maintains subject matter jurisdiction 
over the action as IET's complaint established diversity of citizenship under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 for purposes of federal subject 
matter jurisdiction. "
382,1," Although the Complaint alleges complex causes of  [**6] action, HN2[
] ""Rule 8's pleading standard applies with the same degree of rigor 'in every case, regardless of its size, complexity, or the numbers of parties that may be involved.'"" W. Penn 
Allegheny Health Sys., Inc. v. UPMC, 627 F.3d 85, 98 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting 5 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal 
Practice & Procedure § 1221 (3d ed. 2004)). "
383,2," Sandra Irish, the spouse of George Irish, is also a plaintiff in this case. (Doc. No. 1 at 2.) She is only named as a plaintiff in 
Count Twenty-Four, a state law claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. (Id. at 90-91.) As discussed infra, Count 
Twenty-Four will be dismissed because the Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction  [**8] over the state law 
claims."
383,3," HN3[
] A ""member"" of an LLC is ""[a] person who has been admitted to membership in a limited liability company and who has not dissociated from the company."" 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 8903(a). The committee commentary on this statute notes: ""This 
definition is intended to make clear that a member has all of the rights incident to ownership, not merely the economic rights."" In 
effect, with regard to an LLC, the words ""member"" and ""owner"" appear to be synonymous."
383,4," The table located in Appendix I attached to this Opinion describes the defendants in this action and the ""defendant group"" with 
which they are associated. See infra App. I. The table located in Appendix II organizes Defendants by the counts in which they 
are named. See infra App. II."
383,5," The Court will add the designation ""GP"" to ""Waldman and Black GP"" in order to differentiate it from individual Defendants 
William Waldman and William Black. Waldman and Black GP is not listed as a Carversville Defendant in the Complaint. (Doc. 
No. 1 at 3.) Waldman and Black GP is alleged to be liable under Counts Nineteen, Twenty-Two, Twenty-Three, and Twenty-
Four. The Complaint seems to infer that Waldman and Black GP may not exist as a legal entity. (See id. at 38.) "
384,," Bugaj and Fischer, P.C. is also named as a defendant in this case, but is not listed as a Carversville Defendant in the Complaint. 
(Id. at 3-4.) Bugaj and Fischer, P.C. is a law firm that is partly owned by Defendant  [**11] Ronald Bugaj. (Id.) Bugaj and Fischer, 
P.C. is alleged to be liable under Counts Nineteen, Twenty-Two, Twenty-Three, and Twenty-Four. "
385,6, Santos Rolon is employed by Defendant Weichert Realtors/Paupack Group. (Doc. No. 1 at 7.)
385,7," The following facts are set forth in the Complaint. HN4[
] The Court considers these facts in the light most favorable to 
Plaintiffs. All ""well-pleaded"" facts will be considered by the Court as true. Facts that are conclusory in nature, however, are not 
entitled to an assumption of truth. Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2010)."
385,8," The Complaint does  [**16] not state when these activities allegedly took place. Based on the order of paragraphs in the 
Complaint, the Court will infer these activities took place between 2002 and 2005. "
386,9," On February 1, 2005, the Re/Max franchise previously owned by MIK was transferred to Waldman and Black GP. 
Simultaneously, Waldman and Black GP executed a Re/Max Franchise Agreement with Re/Max. Plaintiffs operated under this 
franchise  [**17] as employees or independent contractors until November 2010, when Re/Max terminated the franchise. On August 25, 2010, Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Pike County, Pennsylvania, seeking a preliminary 
injunction to prevent the termination of the Re/Max Franchise. On November 1, 2010, the state court held that Plaintiffs were not 
owners of the Re/Max Franchise after February 1, 2005. The state court also found that, despite Plaintiffs' argument that 
Waldman and Black GP was a mere ""straw party,"" the ""clear and unambiguous wording"" of the contract did not support Plaintiffs' 
argument. The court held that Plaintiffs' ""straw party"" argument ""challenges the validity of the contract itself,"" and ""[t]hat type of 
claim must be submitted to arbitration under Paragraph 15 of the Agreement."" Despite these rulings, Plaintiffs continue to refer to Waldman and Black GP as a ""straw party"" (see Doc. No. 1 at 37, 38, 39, 40, 
45, 60), and characterize the February 1, 2005 agreement not as an agreement which terminated Plaintiffs' ownership of the 
Franchise, but as ""an accommodation to Plaintiff Irish."" (Doc. No. 1 at 13; see infra Section (IV)(B)(2).)"
386,10, The Complaint does not specify the time frame in which these checks were received or when the gasoline was paid for. 
387,11, The Complaint does not explain how this loan from Invest National Bank and Trust was improper or harmed Lakefront.
387,12," ESSA is a regional bank. It is an acronym for East Strausburg Savings Association. See ESSA Bank & Trust — About Us, 
https://www.essabank.com/html/essa_history.html. "
388,13," This allegation contradicts the theory that Carversville Defendants defrauded the ESSA Defendants in order to obtain loans. 
See supra Section (II)(C)(7)."
388,14," The Complaint avers: ""Due to the conduct of the Carversville Defendants, by and through [Lakefront], Irish was required to 
engage the services of a forensic accountant . . . ."" (Doc. No. 1 at 27.) This paragraph could be read to infer that Irish hired a 
forensic accountant because he became suspicious about the financial state of Lakefront and the actions of Carversville 
Defendants following the December 10 meeting. The Complaint, however, does not specifically make this allegation. "
389,15," A Schedule K-1 is a tax form used to report a taxpayer's portion of a corporation's income or loss which passes to the taxpayer 
as a shareholder of the corporation. Although not specifically alleged in the Complaint, Accounting Defendants prepared the 
Schedule K-1 for Irish yearly from 2002 to 2009. (See Mot. Hr'g Tr. 160:4-15; 161:7-9; 165:6-12 Nov. 6, 2012.)"
389,16," The Court will view the reference to ""Mr. Fishbein"" as a reference to Defendant Benjamin Fishbein."
389,17," Although the Complaint does not identify Joseph Rydzewski, he appears to be an attorney affiliated with Spall. "
390,18," The Complaint does not state who were the parties to the Records Action, nor is a copy of the petition attached to the 
Complaint. Based on allegations in the Complaint, it appears that Carversville Defendants were named as defendants in the 
Records Action. (See, e.g., Doc. No. 1 at 34.)"
390,19," The Complaint states: ""The Plaintiff [sic] hereby incorporates the assertions in the November 2nd Report as if set forth at 
length  [**32] with this complaint."" (Doc. No. 1 at 36.) Because the Report is not attached to the Complaint, the Court is unable to 
consider its content."
390,20," It is unclear whether ""Waldman and Black"" here refers to the individual Defendants or Waldman and Black GP. "
391,21," It is unclear what ""removing"" means, in light of the fact that Waldman and Black GP owned the Re/Max Franchise. It may refer 
to terminating Plaintiffs' relationship with the franchise, or with Re/Max as the franchisor."
391,22, It is unclear whether Waldman attended both the meeting with ReMax and the meeting with law enforcement.
391,23," Plaintiffs allege that the meetings with the law enforcement officer and the Pike County District Attorney are part of the 
conspiracy to operate the RICO enterprise through the commission of a pattern of racketeering activity and to commit criminal 
acts restraining commerce in violation of the antitrust laws. In effect, the Complaint alleges that Defendants present at the 
meeting committed crimes in the presence of the law enforcement officials attending the meeting. Trooper Van Luvender and 
District Attorney Tonkin are not named as defendants in this lawsuit. There is no allegation in the Complaint that any public 
employee or official committed any acts that assisted the alleged conspiracy."
391,24," The Complaint does not allege what these material misrepresentations were, what injury they caused, or provide any other 
details."
391,25, The Complaint does not elaborate on how this contention is relevant to the lawsuit. 
392,26," The Complaint describes the events leading to this meeting as follows: ""The negotiations between Ferguson and Waldman on 
the one hand, and the Meagher Defendants on the other hand, proceeded to the point of a writing with terms for use at a 
meeting scheduled to be held — and then held — on October 9, 2009, the second of such meetings."" (Doc. No. 1 at 43.)"
392,27," The Complaint does not explain why or how the Re/Max Franchise would be ""weak"" under  [**38] the operation of Meagher 
Defendants."
392,28," It is unclear what obligation or duty any party to this franchise extension was operating under requiring them to benefit Irish or 
MIK."
392,29," The relationship between this extension and the extension requested in Bugaj's July 26, 2010 letter is unclear. "
393,30, Ms. Strong is not named as a defendant in this case.
393,31," The case numbers for the civil actions filed against Plaintiffs are alleged in the Complaint as follows: No. 2123-Civil-2010 (Ct. 
Com. Pl. Pike Cnty.); No. 2360-Civil-2010 (Ct. Com. Pl. Pike Cnty.); No. 2584-Civil-2010 (Ct. Com. Pl. Pike Cnty.). (Doc. No. 1 at 
55-57.) The Complaint also alleges that another case, No. 2681-Civil-2010, was filed against Plaintiffs, but does not allege the 
location of the court in which the case was filed. (Id. at 57.) Case No. 2584-Civil-2010 was filed by Defendant G. Anderson Homes against MIK, Irish, and Defendants William Black and 
William Waldman, but was discontinued without prejudice. (Id.) Plaintiffs contend that ""[l]ater, because this action named Black 
and Waldman as parties, with whom it was conspiring, G. Anderson Homes, Inc. discontinued the action without prejudice."" (Id.) 
It is unclear if Plaintiffs  [**43] are alleging that Defendant G. Anderson Homes joined the conspiracy after filing this lawsuit, or 
simply forgot they were conspiring with Black and Waldman before initiating the lawsuit and, upon realizing that they were part of 
a conspiracy with Waldman and Black, discontinued the lawsuit."
393,32," The case numbers for the civil actions filed by MIK are as follows: No. 2412-Civil-2010 (Ct. Com. Pl. Pike Cnty.); No. 2596-
Civil-2010 (Ct. Com. Pl. Pike Cnty.); No. 700-Civil-2011 (location of court not alleged in Complaint). (Doc. No. 1 at 57-59.) MIK 
also filed an action before a district magistrate against Defendants G. Anderson Homes, Inc. and Grace Anderson, No. 417-DM-
2010. (Id. at 59.) MIK prevailed before the district magistrate, but G. Anderson Homes appealed. (Id.) The case is now pending 
before the Court of Common Pleas at No. 1329-Civil-2010. (Id.) As of the date of the issuance of this Opinion, the Court has not 
been informed of the outcome of this case. "
394,33, These other shareholders are not named as plaintiffs in the Complaint filed in the instant case. 
395,34," Because 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) is the substantive RICO provision primarily used in litigation, the Court will review the elements 
of § 1962(c) before addressing § 1962(a) and (b). "
396,35," The RICO Case Statement filed by Plaintiffs describes the alleged enterprise as follows: ""The members of the enterprise 
include the Carversville Defendants: Ferguson; Waldman; Black; Waldman and Black [GP]; Woldow; Vehstedt; Bugaj; Bugaj and 
Fischer, P.C.; Carversville [Development Company] and Carversville Group."" (Doc. No. 58 at 21.) Defendants challenge whether 
an enterprise has been established. In view of the fact that the Court is dismissing the RICO counts on other grounds, there is 
no need to decide the merits of the claim regarding the sufficiency of the alleged enterprise. "
397,36," 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1) provides, in relevant part: HN15[
] ""[R]acketeering activity"" means . . . any act which is indictable under any of the following provisions of title 18, United States Code: . . . section 1341 (relating to mail fraud), section 1343 (relating to wire fraud), section 1344 (relating to 
financial institution fraud) . . . . "
398,37, The other section is § 1962(b). See infra. 
399,38," Pennsylvania law permits a derivative action on behalf of a limited liability company. See Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 
1506 (""In an action to enforce a secondary right brought by one or more stockholders or members of a corporation or similar 
entity because the corporation or entity refuses or fails to enforce rights which could be asserted by it, the complaint shall set 
forth . . . ."") (emphasis added). "
400,39," HN31[
] A RICO case statement may be considered in assessing the merits of Plaintiffs' RICO claims. De Lage Landen Fin. Servs. v. Rasa Floors, LP, No. 08-0533, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19994, 2009 WL 564627, at *10 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 5, 2009). "
401,40," The judicial order appointing the receiver is attached to Defendants Ferguson, Waldman, Black, Waldman and Black GP, 
Carversville Development Company, and Carversville Group's Memorandum of Law in Support of the Motion. (Doc. No. 97-1.) HN32[
] When reviewing a motion to dismiss, a district court ""can consider 'a document  [**68] integral to or explicitly relied 
upon in the complaint.'"" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc. Sec. Litig., 184 F.3d 280, 287 (3d Cir. 1999) (quoting In re Burlington 
Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997)) (emphasis omitted). A district court may also review ""an 
'undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff's claims are based 
on the document.'"" In re Rockefeller Ctr. Props., Inc., 184 F.3d 280, 287 (quoting Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. 
Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993)). Here, the Court may consider this judicial order in deciding the instant Motions to Dismiss because Plaintiffs refer to, and rely on, 
the Receivership Litigation in the Complaint. "
402,41," At the November 6, 2012 hearing on these Motions, Plaintiffs' counsel conceded that Plaintiffs do not have standing to file suit 
for alleged frauds upon Lakefront. (Mot. Hr'g Tr. 153:5-155:10.) "
403,42," The state court held that a claim challenging the validity of the Transfer Agreement must be submitted to arbitration under the 
terms of the Agreement. (Doc. No. 97-2 at 3.) Plaintiffs do not challenge the validity of the contract here, and instead continue to 
assert that Waldman and Black GP is a ""straw party."" "
404,43," HN35[
] ""Res judicata requires that federal courts give state court judgments the same preclusive effect that the issuing state 
courts would give them. While this doctrine sometimes is used narrowly to refer to claim preclusion, whereas collateral estoppel 
customarily refers to issue preclusion, [the Third Circuit] ha(s) previously noted that the preferred usage of the term res judicata 
 [**77] encompasses both claim and issue preclusion."" Russo v. City of Philadelphia, 459 Fed. App'x 176, 178 (3d Cir. 2012) 
(internal quotations omitted). Additionally, HN36[
] in the Third Circuit, a number of affirmative defenses not listed in Rule 12(b), including res judicata, can be decided at the motion to dismiss stage. See Ball v. Famiglio, No. 12-1067, 726 F.3d 448, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 16529, 2013 
WL 4038562, at *7 n.16 (3d Cir. Aug. 9, 2013) ("". . . a number of affirmative defenses that are not listed in Rule 12(b) could still 
be made by motion, provided that the basis of the defense was apparent on the face of the complaint. . . Williams v. Murdoch, 
330 F.2d 745, 749 (3d Cir. 1964) (affirmative defense of res judicata may be raised by a motion to dismiss or by an answer)). Thus, given the similarity between res judicata and collateral estoppel, both can be the subject of a motion to dismiss when the 
defense is obvious on the face of the complaint."
404,44," Although Plaintiffs contend the Court should not consider the Franchise Litigation complaint and order, Plaintiffs have 
analyzed these documents and presented arguments about them in their Supplemental Briefs in Opposition to the Motions to 
Dismiss. (See, e.g., Doc. No. 169 at 21-26.) "
406,45," The other plaintiffs were Gregory A. Vannetta, Russ Kline, and Joseph Murray. (Doc. No. 151-1 at 1.)"
406,46," Plaintiffs also contend that Defendants engaged in bank fraud in regard to the loans made by ESSA Defendants. Bank fraud is 
a predicate act under 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1). As discussed supra, Plaintiffs do not have standing to raise claims related to ESSA. 
Therefore, only mail fraud and wire fraud are relevant to this discussion. "
407,47," Because the Complaint does not describe the Schedule K-1 Form's purpose, the Court has taken judicial notice of this 
description on the IRS website. See supra note 15. The Schedule K-1 form may also report the share of business losses. "
409,48," This allegation does not specifically reference the ""Schedule K-1."" It could refer to Lakefront's inaccurate tax returns, or some 
other unrelated tax return. Reading the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court will consider it as referring to 
the alleged scheme involving false Schedule K-1 forms."
409,49," The $15,000 deposit is the only money the Complaint alleges Irish was required to deposit into Lakefront. Irish does not allege 
he was fraudulently induced to invest the $15,000, and the RICO case statement does not make any mention of the $15,000 "
410,," payment. The Complaint asserts that ""Irish and the other members [of Lakefront] were required to deposit the amount of $15,000 
into the operating account of [Lakefront]."" (Doc. No. 1 at 10-11.) Irish contends that he is the only member who complied with 
this requirement, but the failure of the other members to make the payment does not raise an inference of mail fraud. There is no 
allegation in the extensive Complaint that he was misled into making the $15,000 deposit. Moreover, because the $15,000 
payment was made ""at the time of the creation of [Lakefront]"" (id.), it was made even before Irish received the first Schedule K-1 
form reporting his share of Lakefront's income or possibly losses. As noted, the Complaint does not allege that a loss was 
reported on the 2002 Schedule K-1. Consequently, no Schedule K-1 form could have induced him to pay  [**98] the $15,000. "
412,50," It is also questionable whether a non-owner operating under a franchise has suffered an antitrust injury based upon a decision 
by the franchisee either to transfer the franchise to another party, or to terminate the franchise. "
413,51," The Complaint does not cite the source of these figures, but the Court accepts them as being true on a Motion to Dismiss. "
415,52," Even when the rule of reason is considered with respect to the claim of an illegal boycott, as discussed above, Plaintiffs have 
not met their initial burden of showing that the alleged combination or agreement produced adverse, anti-competitive 
 [**117] effects within the relevant geographic market. "
422,1, The Court has reviewed the Motion for Sanctions and has concluded that sanctions are not warranted here. 
428,*," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
429,1," The facts are drawn from the allegations  [**5] in the operative Corrected Second Amended Complaint (SAC), filed on January 
25, 2011, which on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we accept as true and construe in the light most favorable to Somers. Moyo v. 
Gomez, 40 F.3d 982, 984 (9th Cir. 1994). "
430,2," Specifically, Somers sought to certify a class with the following definition: ""All persons and entities in the United States 
(excluding federal, state and local government entities, Apple, its directors, officers and members of their families) that from 
December 31, 2003 to the present (""Class Period"") purchased an Apple iPod indirectly from Apple for their own use and not for 
resale."" "
433,3," Somers includes a section entitled ""Preservation of Claims for Appeal"" in her amended complaints related to her tying and 
overcharge iPod claims. However,  [**18] these statements are not affirmative assertions of a claim in a complaint, and therefore 
they do not serve to renew claims that she previously dropped."
433,4," We reject Somers' argument that she can assert a damage claim under California's UCL. Somers only seeks compensatory 
damages, which are not recoverable under the UCL. Alvarez v. Chevron Corp., 656 F.3d 925, 933 n.9 (9th Cir. 2011) (HN8[
] 
""Under the UCL, [p]revailing plaintiffs are generally limited to injunctive relief and restitution."" (citation and quotes omitted)); 
 [**21] Cacique, Inc. v. Robert Reiser & Co., Inc., 169 F.3d 619, 624 (9th Cir. 1999) (""California law is clear that §§ 17200 et seq. 
do not authorize a suit by a private party for damages.""); Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 29 Cal. 4th 1134, 131 Cal. 
Rptr. 2d 29, 63 P.3d 937, 943 (Cal. 2003) (""A UCL action is equitable in nature; damages cannot be recovered.""). "
435,5," We note that HN11[
] antitrust injury is also the threshold requirement for antitrust standing, which is required for treble damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15(a).  [**26] See Gerlinger v. Amazon.com, Inc., Borders Group, Inc., 
526 F.3d 1253, 1256 (9th Cir. 2008); Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 987 (9th Cir. 2000) (discussing the 
five elements of antitrust standing)."
435,6," While Somers alleges that Apple promised to sell ""some songs"" for 69 cents each after Amazon began selling online music, 
those tracks were ""few and far between."" SAC ¶ 84."
435,7," Somers suggests for the first time on appeal that regardless of what Apple charged, she was damaged because she was not 
able to purchase music at a lower price from Apple's competitor. But Somers did not assert this basis for damages below, and in 
any event, it is contrary to her alleged overcharge theory. "
450,1," Although the NCTA's membership does not consist solely of cable companies, we refer to the NCTA and Time Warner 
collectively as ""Cable Companies"" throughout the opinion for ease of reference. Respondents FCC and the  [**5] United States 
have submitted a joint brief to the court. Thus, references throughout this opinion to the FCC's arguments on appeal should be 
understood to incorporate the position of the United States as well. "
451,2," Following the release of the 2011 FCC Order, in July 2012 and July 2013, the FCC released its most recent reports on the 
state of competition in the video programming industry. The 2012 FCC Report reviews industry data from 2007-2010, see 2012 
FCC Report ¶ 1, while the 2013 FCC Report reviews data from 2011-2012, see 2013 FCC Report ¶ 1, 2013 FCC LEXIS 3158."
451,3," As of June 2012, the top five MVPDs in terms of total subscribers were, from largest to smallest: Comcast, DIRECTV, DISH 
Network, Time Warner, and Cox Communications. See 2013 FCC Report ¶¶ 25, 27, 70, 97, 2013 FCC LEXIS 3158. "
452,4," OVDs do not include MVPDs that offer their subscribers access to their programming through the Internet. 2012 FCC Report ¶ 
2 n.6. "
457,5," As a result of its merger with NBC Universal, and following its sale of 17 networks to non-MVPDs, as of June 2012, Comcast 
had an ownership interest in 50 national networks, as well as numerous regional news and sports networks. See 2013 FCC 
Report ¶ 39, Table B-1, Table C-1, 2013 FCC LEXIS 3158; 2012 FCC Report ¶ 45. In approving the merger, the FCC expressed concern that Comcast's incentive and ability to harm unaffiliated networks would 
thereby increase: "
458,," Comcast's large subscriber base potentially allows it to limit access to customers for any network it wishes to disadvantage 
by either denying carriage or, with a similar but lesser competitive effect, placing the network in  [**32] a less penetrated tier 
or on a less advantageous channel number (making it more difficult for subscribers to find the programming). In doing so, 
Comcast can reduce viewership of competing video programming networks, which in turn could render these networks less 
attractive to advertisers, thus reducing their revenues and profits. As a result, these unaffiliated networks may compete less 
aggressively with NBCU networks, allowing the latter to obtain or . . . maintain market power with respect to advertisers 
seeking access to their viewers."
458,2011," Comcast/NBCU Order ¶ 116. These concerns led the FCC to condition the merger on Comcast's agreement to certain 
restrictions aimed at reducing affiliation-based discrimination, in addition to those imposed by the program carriage regime. See 
id. ¶¶ 121-24. "
459,6," On November 7, 2011, the NCTA filed a petition for review of the 2011 FCC Order in the D.C. Circuit. On November 22, 2011, 
the D.C. Circuit transferred that petition to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2112(a)(5), where it was consolidated with 
 [**38] the petition for review of the 2011 FCC Order filed by Time Warner on October 11, 2011. "
461,7," The Cable Companies' reliance on Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 94 S. Ct. 2831, 41 L. Ed. 2d 730 
(1974), is misplaced. Unlike the right-of-reply rules struck down in that case, the program carriage regime is ""not activated by 
any particular message spoken by [MVPDs] and thus exact[s] no content-based penalty,"" Turner I, 512 U.S. at 655, and it does 
not mandate that MVPDs support views that they oppose, see Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 256-57. "
465,8," The Cable Companies rely on Comcast Corp. v. FCC, 579 F.3d 1, 388 U.S. App. D.C. 102 (D.C. Cir. 2009), to argue that cable 
operators ""no longer  [**61] have the bottleneck power over programming that concerned the Congress in 1992,"" id. at 8. The 
relevant market in that case, however, was the national MVPD market, not local MVPD markets. See id. As the D.C. Circuit has 
pointed out in the subsequent cases cited in text, cable operators retain market power in certain local MVPD markets."
465,9," We reject the Cable Companies' argument that data regarding Comcast cannot be used to justify the program carriage 
regime's regulation of other MVPDs' speech. The Cable Companies have brought a facial, not an as-applied, challenge to the 
program carriage regime and, thus, we properly consider whether the video programming industry, in whole or in part, justifies 
the challenged regime. See Cablevision Sys. Corp. v. FCC, 649 F.3d at 712. "
467,10," As stated supra at [32], an adverse carriage decision based on the views expressed by an unaffiliated network or a legitimate 
business reason is permissible only insofar as it is not a pretext for affiliation-based discrimination."
467,11," As discussed in section II.B. infra, we are today vacating the standstill rule because the FCC promulgated it in violation of the 
APA's notice-and-comment requirements, and thus we consider the program carriage regime's constitutionality without regard 
thereto. "
468,12," For this reason, the pre-2011 cases cited by the Cable Companies, in which the FCC allegedly failed to require a showing of 
market power, are inapposite. In any event, it is not clear that the FCC failed to consider cable operators' dominant market 
position in those cases. See Tennis Channel, Inc. v. Comcast Cable Commc'ns, LLC, 25 FCC Rcd. 14149, ¶ 20 (Med. Bur. 
2010) (stating that Comcast's ""refusal to expand The Tennis Channel's distribution"" was ""particularly detrimental to the network"" 
because ""Comcast is the dominant cable operator in seven of the ten largest television markets""); Herring Broad., Inc. v. Time 
Warner Cable, Inc., 23 FCC Rcd. 14787, ¶ 19 (Med. Bur. 2008) (stating that Time Warner has ""quasi monopolies in key markets, 
such as New York and Los Angeles, that are essential to WealthTV's long-term viability"" (internal quotation marks omitted))."
468,13," The Cable Companies have pointed to no evidence that the program carriage regime has, in fact, chilled speech by deterring 
MVPDs from developing or investing in affiliated networks. "
469,14," For the same reasons that the program carriage regime survives intermediate scrutiny, we conclude that HN34[
] the prima facie standard is not arbitrary and capricious under the APA. See Cablevision Sys. Corp. v. FCC, 649 F.3d at 713 (HN35[
] ""First Amendment intermediate scrutiny is, of course, substantially more demanding than arbitrary and capricious review of 
agency action."") Further, because we conclude that the program carriage regime is constitutional, we need not address the FCC's assertion that 
the Cable Companies waived their First Amendment and APA challenges to the prima facie standard. "
470,15," Because the FCC has never issued a standstill order in the program carriage context, it cannot rely on cases in which courts 
have held an agency rule procedural because it modified procedures, but not substantive standards, for an established agency 
practice. See JEM Broad. Co. v. FCC, 22 F.3d 320, 327, 306 U.S. App. D.C. 11 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (holding agency rule procedural 
because it employed same substantive standards as its predecessors); Notaro v. Luther, 800 F.2d 290, 291 (2d Cir. 1986) 
(holding agency rule procedural because ""approach set out in the training aid accords with the Commission's regulations and 
past practices"")."
470,16, We express no opinion as to whether the standstill rule is consistent with §§ 616 and 624 of the Communications Act. 
471,17," See Implementation of the Cable Television Consumer Protection & Competition Act of 1992, 22 FCC Rcd. 17791, ¶¶ 135-37 
(2007) (discussing proposal to adopt standstill requirement and seeking comment on issuance of temporary stay orders); see 
also 47 C.F.R. § 76.1003(l)  [**88] (setting forth standstill requirements for program access complaints). "
472,18," In light of our decision to vacate, we do not reach the Cable Companies' substantive challenges to the standstill rule under the 
First Amendment, APA, and Communications Act, as these concerns may be obviated if the FCC does not re-promulgate the 
rule or if it proposes—or after comment adopts—a modified rule not presenting the problems raised in these challenges. "
484,1," This opinion refers to four Defendants collectively or alternatively as ""Pfizer"": Pfizer  [*16] Inc., Pfizer Manufacturing Ireland, 
Pfizer Ireland Pharmaceuticals, Warner-Lambert Company, and Warner-Lambert Company LLC. Pfizer Inc. is a Delaware 
corporation that sold branded Lipitor. Pfizer Manufacturing Ireland (""Pfizer Ireland""), formerly known as Pfizer Ireland 
Pharmaceuticals, formerly known as Warner Lambert Export, Ltd., is a partnership organized and existing under the laws of 
Ireland, and is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc; Pfizer Ireland was the exclusive licensee of the '995 patent, 
which is the patent at issue in this litigation. Warner-Lambert Company is a corporation formerly organized under Delaware law 
which co-promoted Lipitor with Pfizer and later became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer by merger in 2000; in 2002, Warner-
Lambert Company became a Delaware limited liability company and changed its name to Warner-Lambert Company LLC."
484,2," This opinion refers to Defendants Ranbaxy, Inc., Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Ranbaxy Laboratories, Ltd, collectively or 
alternatively as ""Ranbaxy."""
484,3," At the time the motion to dismiss was filed, three groups of Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs asserted claims in three operative 
complaints: (1) ""Direct Class Plaintiffs"":  [*17] a purported class of direct purchasers identified in Consolidated Amended Class 
Action Complaint and Jury Demand, No. 3:12-cv-02389-PGS-DEA (Sept. 10, 2012) (""Compl.""), (2) ""Opt-Out Walgreen Plaintiffs"": 
identified in Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, Walgreen Co. et al. v. Pfizer Inc. et al., No. 3:12-cv-04115-PGS-DEA (July 5, 
2012) (""Walgreen Compl.""); and (3) ""Opt-Out Meijer Plaintiffs"": identified in Complaint and Demand for Jury Trial, Meijer, Inc. et 
al. v. Pfizer Inc. et al., No. 3:12-cv-04537-PGS-DEA (July 19, 2012) (""Meijer Compl.""). While the motion was pending, an 
additional group of Direct Purchasers brought suit, and stipulated with Defendants that they would be subject to the decision on 
this pending motion. See Rite Aid Corp. et al. v. Pfizer Inc. et al., No. 3:12-cv-07561-PGS-DEA (Dkt. Nos. 1 & 9). The facts 
alleged in all of the Complaints are substantially similar; this decision primarily refers to the Direct Class Plaintiffs' Complaint, 
although the Court has reviewed and considered all of them. "
485,4," The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (""FDCA""), 21 U.S.C. §§ 301-399 (2006), requires a company seeking to market a 
new drug to file information for any patents covering the drug for which a claim for infringement could reasonably be asserted, 
which  [*21] the FDA lists in the Orange Book. Under Hatch-Waxman, manufacturers seeking to market a generic form of an 
innovator drug before the last expiring Orange Book-listed patent must file a ""Paragraph IV Certification"" with its ANDA, 
certifying that its product will not infringe any listed patent and/or that the patent is invalid or unenforceable. 21 U.S.C. § 
355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV). This constitutes an artificial act of infringement, after which the innovator has 45 days to sue, which lawsuit 
would trigger a 30-month stay of final FDA approval of the ANDA. See id. § 355(j)(5)(B). This allows the generic manufacturer to 
litigate patent validity and infringement to avoid facing an ""at risk"" product launch and exposure to substantial damages. The first 
generic to file an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV Certification is eligible for 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity, during 
which the FDA may not approve any later-filed ANDAs. See id. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv). "
486,5," The Complaint provides by way of an analogy and illustration the image of a person's left hand and right hand, which are also 
non-superimposable mirror images of each other."
486,6," The Complaints list the in vitro COR and CSI assays and the in vivo AICS screen as the primary tests. Id. ¶¶ 127, 130. "

524,*," This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral 
estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited 
under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 32.1. "
525,1," We take this representation as to the ""dominance"" of M-I and Baroid in the bentonite and barite mining and production fields as 
true, as required when reviewing a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). M-I avers that other companies also mine 
and produce bentonite and barite. See Appellee's Br. at 5 n.3."
525,2," The parties do not specify whether there is any material difference between ""Baroid Corporation"" and ""Baroid Industrial Drilling 
Products."" "
527,3," The district court dismissed the federal antitrust claims with prejudice, stating, ""[i]f this [the previously explained problem with 
TKO's claims] were the only deficiency with plaintiff's antitrust claims, the court would grant leave to permit a Second Amended 
Complaint with more specific factual allegations; however, the issues discussed below preclude plaintiff from being able to state 
an antitrust claim here."" Opinion & Order at 8; Appellant's App. at 134. The court dismissed the state claims without prejudice, 
giving TKO the opportunity to re-file its state claims. TKO rejected that offer, however, and asked the court to enter a final 
judgment, which it did. "
531,1," Steadfast contends, and plaintiff does not dispute, that federal law applies to the determination of the arbitrability of the claims 
herein. "
532,2," This provision of the endorsement to Section VII is identical to the provision superceded in Section VII of the Policy. Compare 
ct. doc. 6-2 at 8. "
533,3," Plaintiff argues that ambiguities should be construed against Steadfast, the drafter of the Policy. However, that rule of 
construction does not trump the strong preference in favor of arbitration. See Chen-Oster v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., 785 F. 
Supp. 2d 394, 403 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), rev'd on other grounds by, Parisi v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., 710 F.3d 483 (2d Cir. 2013)."

552,1," Nor does the Court actually find that the FDCA and FPLA's regulations are not ""comprehensive"" or detailed. For instance, the 
FDCA regulations detail, inter alia, the size of type, measurement terms, abbreviations, and types of fractions that may be used. 
See 21 C.F.R. § 701.13. The FPLA similarly sets forth the permitted measurement terms, units, and fractions. See Cal. Bus. & 
Prof. Code § 12603. "
553,2," As Defendant points out, Plaintiff is free to lobby Congress or the FDA to change these rules, but not the Court. (See Mot. Br. 6 
n.5.)"
553,3," Although the Court decided that the safe harbor defense applies, its finding of federal preemption is sufficient to dismiss 
Plaintiff's labeling claims. See Chacanaca v. Quaker Oats Co., 752 F. Supp. 2d 1111, 1125 n.8 (N.D. Cal. 2010 (claims relating 
to statements made on granola bar labels were expressly preempted, and thus ""defendant's safe harbor argument is moot""). The 
Court recognizes that the arguments regarding both safe harbor and federal preemption substantially overlap."
553,4," Plaintiff's FAL claim cannot be premised on Sugar's allegedly deceptive packaging since the FAL requires a untrue or [*16]  
misleading ""statement."" See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500. The Court thus dismisses the FAL claim in its entirety. "
554,5, The Court has already dismissed the FAL claim in its entirety. (See supra Part III.A.2.)
554,6, See the Court's discussion in Part III.A above. 
555,7," At oral argument, counsel for Plaintiff asked that the Court consider Baggett v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 582 F. Supp. 2d 1261 
(C.D. Cal. 2007) to support its UCL claim. Baggett, however, is distinguishable from the situation here because Hewlett-Packard 
allegedly made affirmative false representations that its ink cartridges were empty when they were not. Id. at 1269. Here, 
Defendant's design and packaging simply does not rise to the level of actionable misrepresentation. "
566,1," On certain occasions in the briefs, the End-Payors are alternatively referred to as ""indirect purchasers."" See, e.g., Defs.' Mem. 
Supp. Their Mot. Dismiss Indirect Purchasers' Consol. Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 114) Pursuant Fed. Rule Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), 
ECF No. 156. The Court, however, believes the former appellation to be more apt than the latter."
566,2," The Direct Purchasers have lodged the following charges against the Defendants: (1) conspiracy to monopolize, in violation of 
Sherman Act section 2, 15 U.S.C. § 2, against AstraZeneca  [**12] and Ranbaxy; (2) conspiracy to monopolize, in violation of 
Sherman Act section 2, against AstraZeneca and Teva; (3) conspiracy to monopolize, in violation of Sherman Act section 2, 
against AstraZeneca and Dr. Reddy's; (4) agreement in restraint of trade, in violation of Sherman Act section 1, 15 U.S.C. § 1, 
against AstraZeneca and Ranbaxy; (5) agreement in restraint of trade, in violation of Sherman Act section 1, against 
AstraZeneca and Teva; (6) agreement in restraint of trade, in violation of Sherman Act section 1, against AstraZeneca and Dr. 
Reddy's; (7) monopolization, in violation of Sherman Act section 2, against AstraZeneca; (8) attempt to monopolize, in violation 
of Sherman Act section 2, against AstraZeneca; (9) agreement in restraint of trade, in violation of Sherman Act section 1, against 
all of the Defendants; and (10) conspiracy to monopolize, in violation of Sherman Act section 2, against all of the Defendants. 
See Consol. Am. Compl. & Demand Jury Trial ¶¶ 166-234, ECF No. 131. For their part, the End-Payors' in their consolidated complaint have set forth state-based claims for relief that are largely 
analogous to the Direct Purchasers' federal claims, as well as a standalone  [**13] claim for declaratory relief under sections 1 
and 2 of the Sherman Act and injunctive relief under section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26. See Corrected Consol. Am. 
Class Action Compl. & Demand Jury Trial ¶¶ 157-195, ECF No. 114. "
567,3," The Defendants also assert that the End-Payors' claims should additionally be dismissed on the same grounds as those 
proffered in their motion to dismiss the Direct Purchasers. See Defs.' Mem. Supp. Their Mot. Dismiss Indirect Purchasers' 
Consol. Am. Compl. (Dkt. No. 114) Pursuant Fed. Rule Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), at 2-4, ECF No. 156. Because of their 
expressly duplicative nature, these grounds will only be discussed in the section of this memorandum dealing with the Direct 
Purchasers. See infra section II.B. "
568,4," The  [**19] Direct Purchasers moved to file a single, consolidated memorandum in opposition to the Defendants' motions to 
dismiss, Direct Purchaser Pls.' Mot. File Single Consol. Mem. Opp'n Four Mots. Dismiss, ECF No. 162, but the Court denied 
their request, Elec. Order, Mar. 13, 2013, ECF No. 165. As a result, in an attempt to minimize redundancy, each of the Direct 
Purchasers' four opposition memoranda respond to a different set of arguments raised in the Defendants' motions. See Direct 
Purchaser Class Pls.' Opp'n AstraZeneca's Mot. Dismiss 8 n.24, ECF No. 168 (matching each of the Direct Purchasers' 
opposition memoranda with corresponding arguments made by the Defendants). "
569,5," If a generic manufacturer files a paragraph IV certification and a brand manufacturer files a patent infringement suit against the 
generic manufacturer within forty-five days of receiving notice of the paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not grant final 
approval to the ANDA until either thirty months have passed or a court has issued a decision deeming the patent invalid or not 
infringed, whichever is earlier. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(c)(3)(C); Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc., 496 U.S. 661, 677-78, 110 S. Ct. 
2683, 110 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1990)."
569,6," Because  [**25] the facts alleged in the Direct Purchasers' and End-Payors' complaints largely mirror one another, this Court 
here adopts the facts alleged in the latter and largely excludes parallel citation references to similar provisions in the former. "
570,7," Nexium is recommended for individuals who suffer from erosive esophagitis and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
See End-Payors' Compl. ¶ 65."
570,8," The following nine other Nexium patents listed in the Orange Book did not form the basis of AstraZeneca's litigation against 
Ranbaxy: U.S. Patent No. 4,786,505 (the ""'505 patent""); U.S. Patent No. 4,853,230 (the ""'230 patent""); U.S. Patent No. 
4,738,974 (the ""'974 patent""); U.S. Patent No. 5,690,960  [**27] (the ""'960 patent""); U.S. Patent No. 5,900,424 (the ""'424 
patent""); U.S. Patent No. 7,411,070 (the ""'070 patent""); U.S. Patent No. 6,147,103 (the ""'103 patent""); U.S. Patent No. 6,191,148 
(the ""'148 patent""); and U.S. Patent No. 6,166,213 (the ""'213 patent""). Id. ¶ 75."
570,9," The End-Payors seek to substantiate this allegation by making reference to collateral rulings of the European Patent Office in 
2006 and 2011 in connection with two European Nexium patents, in which the challenged patents were determined invalid on 
account of their failure to satisfy the ""inventive-step"" patentability requirement, the European equivalent  [**28] of the U.S. 
nonobviousness requirement. Id. ¶ 71. "
571,10," AstraZeneca claimed Teva's generic Nexium would infringe the '504, '192, '872, '810, and '085 patents. But AstraZeneca 
subsequently amended its complaint to withdraw its allegation that Teva infringed the '810 patent and add an allegation that 
Teva infringed the '070 patent. Id. ¶ 78. Eight other Nexium patents listed in the Orange Book (the '505, '230, '974, '960, '424, 
'103, '148, and '213 patents) did not form the basis of AstraZeneca's litigation against Teva and would not  [**29] have prevented 
Teva from entering the market in late 2008. See id. ¶ 79."
571,11," AstraZeneca claimed that Dr. Reddy's generic Nexium would infringe the '504, '872, and '085 patents. Id. ¶ 82. In reply to Dr. 
Reddy's answer, AstraZeneca also alleged that Dr. Reddy's generic Nexium would infringe its '192 patent. Id. "
572,12," Dr. Reddy's subsequently filed its own motion for declaratory judgment in May 2008, by which it sought a similar judgment 
affirming the noninfringement of those patents listed in the Orange Book which AstraZeneca had failed to assert previously in its 
infringement actions against the Generic Defendants. Id. ¶ 96."
572,13," Although the New Jersey District Court denied AstraZeneca's motion to dismiss Teva's declaratory judgment for lack of 
jurisdiction, it granted AstraZeneca's motion to stay declaratory judgment until AstraZeneca's principal infringement action 
against Teva had been resolved. Id. ¶ 98. "
573,14," The End-Payors allege that, despite the parties' briefing of claim construction in the summer of 2009, both parties requested 
that the court delay its construal of their claims to drag out litigation past January 7, 2010, by which time the parties had entered 
into the reverse payment agreements. Id. ¶ 99. "
575,15," Three of the formerly active Nexium patents listed in the FDA Orange Book in connection with AstraZeneca's NDA expired in 
2007. See Direct Purchasers' Compl. ¶ 73."
575,16," Although the Third Circuit formally stood alone in opposition to its sister circuits, earlier jurisprudence in the Sixth and District 
of Columbia Circuits provides additional foundation for the Third Circuit's reasoning. See In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., 332 
F.3d 896, 908 (6th Cir. 2003) (ruling that an agreement effecting a delay in market entry by generic drug manufacturers is ""a 
classic example of a per se illegal restraint of trade""); Andrx Pharms., Inc. v. Biovail Corp. Int'l, 256 F.3d 799, 811, 347 U.S. App. 
D.C. 178 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (holding that a reverse payment agreement ""could reasonably be viewed as an attempt to allocate 
market share and preserve monopolistic conditions"")."
575,17," The reasons for taking such action were fivefold: (1) reverse payments raise a ""potential for genuine adverse effects on 
competition,"" Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2234 (quoting Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ind. Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 460, 106 S. Ct. 
2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted); (2) ""these anticompetitive consequences will at least 
sometimes prove unjustified,"" id. at 2235-36; (3) ""where a reverse payment threatens to work unjustified anticompetitive harm, 
the patentee likely possesses the power to bring that harm about in practice,"" id. at 2236; (4) ""[a]n unexplained large reverse 
payment itself would normally suggest that the patentee has serious doubts about  [**45] the patent's survival,"" id.; and (5) ""the 
fact that a large, unjustified reverse payment risks antitrust liability does not prevent litigating parties from settling their lawsuit,"" 
id. at 2237. See generally id. at 2234-37. "
576,18," Although this three-factor inquiry is set forth in a First Circuit case in which only section 1 of the Sherman Act was at issue, 
see Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of R.I., 373 F.3d 57, 61 (1st Cir. 2004), various other courts, 
 [**46] including the Supreme Court, have held that the rule of reason applies with equal force to claims brought under section 2, 
see, e.g., Standard Oil Co. of N.J. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 61-62, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911); cf., e.g., United 
States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 59, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (per curiam). "
577,19," What is more, in this particular case, the Direct Purchasers may not even need to allege a relevant market in order to state 
their Sherman  [**51] Act claims. The relevant market serves merely as a proxy for market power when direct evidence of 
market power is unavailable. IIB Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 531a, at 232 (3d ed. 2007) (""Finding 
the relevant market and its structure is typically not a goal in itself but a mechanism for considering the plausibility of antitrust 
claims that the defendants' business conduct will create, enlarge, or prolong market power.""). But see id. ¶ 531a, at 233 (""Even 
when direct measures of power are feasible, courts would still find market definition useful . . . . Thus, while market definition and 
computation of market share is often said to be a surrogate for more 'direct' measures of market power, it is often more than a 
surrogate.""). Where direct evidence of market power is available, however, a plaintiff need not attempt to define the relevant 
market. Id. ¶ 531f, at 241. Such appears to be the case here, see Direct Purchasers' Compl. ¶¶ 143-145, 147-151 (alleging that 
""[AstraZeneca] had the power to maintain the price of the drug it sold as Nexium at supracompetitive levels without losing 
substantial sales to other products prescribed and/or used for the same purposes  [**52] as Nexium, with the exception of AB-
rated generic versions of Nexium,"" id. ¶ 143, and that ""AstraZeneca . . . enjoyed high barriers to entry with respect to competition 
. . . due to patent and other regulatory protections and high costs of entry and expansion,"" id. ¶ 150), which would tend to 
eliminate the need formally to define a relevant market, see Coastal Fuels of P.R., Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 
182, 196-97 (1st Cir. 1996). "
579,20," The  [**60] Generic Defendants, however, pay no heed to the Direct Purchasers' allegation that ""AstraZeneca has already 
paid Ranbaxy millions of dollars under their Agreement."" Direct Purchasers' Compl. ¶ 120. That said, because this allegation 
was made simply upon information and belief — and, more importantly, because the inclusion of a monetary payment in the 
AstraZeneca/Ranbaxy agreement ultimately does not affect this Court's analysis — this Court has no qualms crediting the 
Generic Defendants' account. "
580,21," Indeed, even Chief Justice Roberts, who authored the dissenting opinion in the case, acknowledged that nonmonetary forms 
of consideration carry worth in the antitrust context. See id. at 2239 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (commenting that the brand 
defendant ""gave its competitors something of value (money) and, in exchange, its competitors gave it something of value 
(dropping their legal claims)"")."
580,22," The Federal Trade Commission, one of the two federal agencies responsible for enforcing federal antitrust laws, has published 
numerous studies suggesting that nonmonetary pay-for-delay agreements in which a brand drug manufacturer declines to sell 
an authorized generic during a first-filer's 180-day exclusivity period constitute reverse payments. See, e.g., FTC Report on 
Authorized Generics, supra,  [**63] at 152 (concluding that ""[a] review of recent brand-generic settlements reveals that 
agreements not to compete with ANDA-generics through an [authorized generic] have become a recognized mode for a brand to 
provide compensation to generics and, therefore, can be used as exclusion payments in patent settlement agreements""); Fed. 
Trade Comm'n, Pay-for-Delay: How Drug Company Pay-Offs Cost Consumer Billions 5 (2010), available at 
http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/01/100112payfordelayrpt.pdf (acknowledging that not all pay-for-delay agreements involve cash 
payments). In addition, case law confirms that although contingent liabilities technically ""depend[] on a future event that may not 
even occur[] to fix either [their] existence or [their] amount,"" Freeland v. Enodis Corp., 540 F.3d 721, 730 (7th Cir. 2008) (second 
alteration in original) (quoting In re Knight, 55 F.3d 231, 236 (7th Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted), courts have 
nevertheless rejected the notion that such liabilities are without any value whatsoever, see, e.g., id. (""[A] contingent liability is not 
valued at its full amount . . . . Rather, a contingent liability is valued at its face amount multiplied by the probability  [**64] that it 
will become due.""). "
581,23," The Court need not address the Defendants'  [**67] contention that Federal Circuit law governs this dispute, see 
AstraZeneca's Mem. 8-9; Teva's Mem. 7-9, as the Supreme Court has already weighed in on this issue, see Actavis, 133 S. Ct. 
at 2231 (""[I]t would be incongruous to determine antitrust legality by measuring [a reverse payment] settlement's anticompetitive 
effects solely against patent law policy, rather than by measuring them against procompetitive antitrust policies as well. . . . [T]his 
Court has indicated that patent and antitrust policies are both relevant in determining the 'scope of the patent monopoly' — and 
consequently antitrust law immunity —that is conferred by a patent.""); id. at 2236 (""[I]t is normally not necessary to litigate 
patent validity to answer the antitrust question . . . .""). But see id. at 2240 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (asserting that questions of 
patent invalidity and infringement, in the context of reverse payments, are ""plainly a question of patent law"")."
581,24," The rationale underlying the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is ostensibly rooted in the First Amendment's Petition Clause, 
 [**69] which provides that ""Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the right of the people . . . to petition the Government."" 
U.S. Const. amend. I. "
582,25," Technically, AstraZeneca's memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss and the three partially redacted settlement 
agreements referenced therein were filed eleven days apart. The disparity in the filing dates is explained, however, by the fact 
that the Court denied AstraZeneca's motion to impound the settlement agreements, see Elec. Order, Feb. 28, 2013, ECF No. 
153; see also AstraZeneca Defs.' Mot. Impoundment Confidential Materials, ECF No. 140, which led AstraZeneca  [**71] to 
furnish these documents to the Court at a later date. Accordingly, for the purposes of citation, this Court effectively treats the 
redacted versions of the settlement agreements as though they were appended to AstraZeneca's support memorandum in the 
first instance. "
583,26," In their memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss the End-Payors' complaint, the Defendants present an alternate 
interpretation of the relevant petitioning conduct, arguing that they ""petition[ed] the [New Jersey District Court] to enter consent 
judgments as orders of the court enjoining Ranbaxy, Teva, and [Dr. Reddy's] from marketing a generic version of Nexium until 
May 2014."" Defs.' Mot. Dismiss End-Payors 3. Even were this Court to adopt the Defendants' broader definition of ""petitioning,"" 
the conclusion reached in this memorandum ultimately would be the same, as it is not the Defendants' mere efforts to obtain a 
consent judgment that the Plaintiffs are challenging. Rather, the Plaintiffs have taken particular issue with the settlement 
agreements undergirding the consent judgments and the purported use of the New Jersey District Court as an instrument to 
legitimate the Defendants' allegedly anticompetitive arrangement."
583,27," The same argument can be made with respect to settlements alone. See Ku, supra, at 421-26. Admittedly, courts have 
deemed settlements between private parties and the state to be incidental to the petitioning that takes place via litigation. See, 
e.g., A.D. Bedell Wholesale Co. v. Philip Morris Inc., 263 F.3d 239, 252-54 (3d Cir. 2001). These types of settlements are quite 
distinguishable from those assented to between two or more private parties, however, because, in the former case, the state is 
operating as an actor that is directly engaged in the decisionmaking process. "
584,28," Despite the Defendants' protestations to the contrary, the fact that the settlement agreements would have been null and void 
absent the approval of the New Jersey District Court has no bearing on the present analysis. "
585,29," Indeed, the very fact that the Defendants can with a straight face advance this Noerr-Pennington argument based on consent

589,57," For further explanation of Illinois Brick-repealer statutes, see infra section II.C.3.b."
589,58," Part of the reason for this confusion arises from the fact that the ""named plaintiffs"" and (putative) ""class representatives"" are 
not necessarily the same. This is because ""[c]lass counsel need not put forward all named plaintiffs, or only named plaintiffs as 
proposed class representatives."" 1 Newberg on Class Actions § 2:1, at 58 (5th ed. 2013)."

when their members make co-payments. End-Payors' Supplemental Mem. 1."
590,61," Although the Defendants contend that this Court must engage in a choice-of-law analysis in order to determine what they 
characterize as the standing of the named class representatives, Defs.' Mot. Dismiss End-Payors 8-10; Defs.' Reply End-Payors 
3, it would be premature for the Court to commence this analysis at this stage before the parties are able to engage in discovery. 
This is because the putative class consists of members who have suffered harm in many more states than the named plaintiffs; 
the End-Payors, indeed, describe the putative class as constituting the following: All persons or entities who purchased and/or paid for some or all of the purchase price for Nexium and/or its AB-rated 
generic equivalents in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, 
Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico  [**102] . . . . End-Payors' Compl. ¶ 113. The End-Payors' complaint futher alleges that, ""[f]or purposes of the Class definition, persons or 
entities 'purchased' Nexium or its generic equivalent if they paid or reimbursed some or all of the purchase price."" Id. To hold 
that the class representatives may only pursue claims in their principal place of business would be improvident because it would 
risk jeopardizing the interests of other members of the putative class who purchased Nexium in a range of states. "
591,62," Although the Defendants claim that the law has changed since this Court's opinion in Relafen, this Court holds that any 
change  [**105] in the law following recent rulings of the First Circuit in Plumbers' Union does not implicate the ability of the 
named end-payor plaintiffs to represent the putative class in this case for the reasons articulated below. "
594,63," See also The Shell Co. (P.R.) Ltd. v. Los Frailes Serv. Station, Inc., 551 F. Supp. 2d 127, 135 (D.P.R. 2007) (""Puerto Rico 
courts generally follow federal antitrust law when interpreting local antitrust laws."")."
594,64," Since the Defendants' filing, the Utah Antitrust Act has been renumbered. Citations to said law reflect the current 
 [**117] codification. "
602,1," This party is referenced in Plaintiffs' pleadings as the Detroit Medical Center, but the Court recently entered a July 10, 2013 
stipulated order substituting VHS of Michigan, Inc. in place of the Detroit Medical Center."
602,2," More specifically, Defendants Trinity Health Corp., Henry Ford Health System, William Beaumont Hospital, Mount Clemens 
General Hospital, Inc. and VHS of Michigan, Inc. (formerly the Detroit Medical Center) filed a joint response in opposition to 
Plaintiffs' motion. Although, as noted, Plaintiffs have reached settlements with each of these Defendants except VHS of 
Michigan, these settlements have not yet been finally approved. For the remainder of this opinion, then, the Court will continue to 
refer to ""Defendants"" as the parties opposing Plaintiffs' motion. "
603,3," As noted earlier, apart from this rule of reason claim, Plaintiffs also have alleged that the Defendant health care providers 
committed a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act by conspiring among themselves and with other Detroit area hospitals to 
hold down the wages of RNs employed by these institutions. In a March 22, 2012 opinion and order, however, the Court found 
that Defendants were entitled to summary judgment in their favor as to this per se claim, see Cason-Merenda, 862 F. Supp.2d at 
628-41, leaving Plaintiffs' rule of reason claim as the sole remaining basis  [**8] for recovery going forward in this litigation."
603,4," In its summary judgment ruling,  [**9] the Court referred frequently to the ""DOJ/FTC Guidelines,"" an August 1996 statement 
issued by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission that spells out the antitrust enforcement policies of 
these two federal agencies with respect to certain forms of joint activity in the health care industry. See Cason-Merenda, 862 F. 
Supp.2d at 607 n.6. "
604,5," As explained by Plaintiffs, contingent nurses ""work flexible schedules or assignments and perform the same essential duties as 
regular staff nurses,"" and  [**12] their pay ""is extremely closely linked to that of the identically qualified staff nurses with whom 
they work side by side."" (Plaintiffs' Motion, Br. in Support at 10 n.14.) "
605,6," According to Plaintiffs, Defendant's expert, Dr. Edward A. Snyder, retreated from this claim at his deposition, testifying that his 
initial calculations inaccurately treated a nurse's vacations, holidays, and other compensated time off as non-base pay. Plaintiffs' 
expert, Dr. Ashenfelter, has opined that if these elements of compensated time off are properly recorded as base pay, then the 
median percentage of total compensation accounted for by non-base pay ranges from 9 to 20 percent, in contrast to the 17 to 32 
percent range set forth in Dr. Snyder's report. (See Ashenfelter Rebuttal Report at ¶¶ 83-84.) "
608,7," As observed by the court in Foundry Resins, 242 F.R.D. at 407, HN10[
] while courts previously examined the qualifications of class counsel as part of their Rule 23(a)(4) inquiry, this practice arguably has been altered as a result of the 2003 enactment 
of Rule 23(g), which specifies the factors a court must consider in appointing class counsel. Thus, in the brief in support of their 
motion, Plaintiffs have separately addressed the ability of their proposed class counsel to ""fairly and adequately represent the 
interests of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B). The Court need not dwell on this question at any length, because it is clear that the proposed class counsel in this case have the 
experience, knowledge, and resources to fairly and adequately represent the interests of the proposed class. Indeed, given that 
counsel are actively involved in the litigation of similar antitrust claims of depressed RN wages in other cities around the country, 
they  [**29] are able to bring a unique degree of knowledge and experience to bear in pursuing the claims in this case. 
Moreover, two of the three firms proposed as class counsel were active participants in the initial pre-suit investigation and 
evaluation that led to the claims asserted in this case. Finally, class counsel, like the named Plaintiffs, have played a determined, 
persistent, and vital role in the lengthy and challenging settlement negotiations that have spanned several years of this litigation, 
and these efforts have already achieved a substantial settlement for the benefit of the RN class. The Court readily concludes, 
therefore, that proposed class counsel meet the standards for appointment set forth in Rule 23(g). "
610,8," As noted by Plaintiffs,  [**36] the court in Fleischman addressed the question of predominance on an issue-by-issue basis, in 
accordance with Second Circuit precedent that authorizes the courts to certify a class as to a particular issue regardless of 
whether a plaintiff's claim as a whole satisfies the Rule 23(b)(3) requirement of predominance. See Fleischman, 2008 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 57188, 2008 WL 2945993, at *6 (citing Cordes & Co., 502 F.3d at 108-09). The Sixth Circuit has yet to decide whether 
such an issue-by-issue inquiry into predominance is appropriate. See Randleman, 646 F.3d at 356. "
611,9," The court in that case revisited the question of class certification in  [**39] a later ruling, with the plaintiffs seeking to limit their 
proposed class to current employees only, and requesting only injunctive or declaratory relief rather than an award of damages. 
See In re MPT, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 249, 2006 WL 38937, at *1 (D.N.J. Jan. 5, 2006). The court again concluded that the 
proposed class was insufficiently cohesive to warrant certification and that the plaintiffs' claims instead ""raise[d] a number of 
individualized issues,"" where even the more limited class proposed by the plaintiffs ""includes approximately forty-thousand 
(40,000) members, and encompasses more than four-thousand (4,000) different jobs (including, for example, attorneys, 
geologists, pilots and engineers) and a wide range of education levels (ranging from high school to Ph.D. degrees)."" 2006 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 249, [WL] at *6. Although the plaintiffs sought to bridge this evidentiary gap through the opinion of an expert in labor 
economics who proposed to derive benchmarks from cross-industry salary surveys, the court found that this expert opinion failed 
to ""address the main question confronting the Court — whether members of the Proposed Class are sufficiently cohesive with 
respect to the employment opportunities available to them."" 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 249, [WL] at *10. "
612,10," To be sure, the court in Fleischman adhered to its decision to deny class certification as to the issues of antitrust impact and 
damages, even after the plaintiffs in that case retained Dr. Ashenfelter as an additional expert whose benchmark analysis 
offered a means by which the plaintiffs could potentially establish antitrust impact and damages through common proof. This 
ruling, however, was based in part on procedural considerations that are not pertinent here. See Fleischman, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 23727, 2010 WL 681992 at *3 (holding that the plaintiffs were not permitted to present a new benchmark analysis from 
Dr. Ashenfelter that rested upon previously discoverable data). To the extent that the court further concluded that individualized 
inquiries into the discrete  [**45] components of each RN's total compensation would remain necessary even in light of Dr. 
Ashenfelter's benchmark approach, see 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23727, [WL] at *6, this Court respectfully takes a different view of 
the necessity of individualized proofs as to the non-base-wage elements of RN compensation under Dr. Ashenfelter's proposed 
approach, for reasons noted already and addressed at greater length below. "
614,11," In light of the Court's determination that common issues predominate as to Plaintiffs' proposed direct method of proving 
antitrust impact through Dr. Ashenfelter's benchmark approach, Plaintiffs correctly observe that it is not necessary for them to 
show that they can indirectly establish this impact through proof common to the class. Nonetheless, for the sake of 
completeness, the Court addresses the parties' arguments on this question. "
615,12," The sole exception to this rule is Henry Ford Hospital, but the record reveals that nearly all of the various RN job titles at this 
facility map onto the same pay scales."
615,13," Moreover, to the extent that variations in compensation among the individual members of the RN class are a function of non-
base elements of their pay, the Court observed earlier that Dr. Ashenfelter's theory of antitrust impact and damages seeks to 
ameliorate the effect of differences in non-base pay by altogether omitting any possible components of non-base pay from his 
determination of the but-for wages RNs would receive in the absence of the alleged conspiracy. Again, while Defendants are 
free to challenge this benchmark approach, it provides a mechanism for Plaintiffs to establish antitrust impact and damages "
616,," through class-wide proof without the need to address the more individualized inquiries that are inherent in the divergent non-
base-pay elements adopted by the various Defendant hospitals. "
621,1," Plaintiffs in their Amended Complaint use group pleading to discuss the allegations against the various defendants, i.e., they 
utilize one name to collectively refer to several different defendants. This practice has made it exceedingly difficult to discern 
which individual defendants are alleged to have participated in the events in question and proves fatal to Plaintiffs' claims 
regarding the group of defendants referred to as the ""Genting Defendants. See infra Section II(C). However, in setting forth the 
statement of facts, the Court refers to individual defendants and to groups of individual defendants according to the terminology 
used by Plaintiffs in the Amended Complaint, except where otherwise noted."
621,2," Plaintiffs also refer to EPT, EPT Concord and EPT Concord II as the ""EPT Defendants."" Am. Compl. at 1. However, for the 
sake of clarity, the Court will only use the term ""Entertainment Properties"" when discussing this set of defendants. Additionally, in 
Paragraph 95 of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs refer to ""Entertainment Properties"" as ""Defendant,"" suggesting that 
Entertainment Properties refers only to one defendant; however, the Court will construe the use of the singular to be a 
typographical error and treat this reference as applying to the group of defendants previously described as ""Entertainment 
Properties."" Id. ¶ 95. "
622,3," When referring to ""Empire"" in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs do not adequately specify whether they are referring to Empire 
Resorts, Inc. alone or to both Empire Resorts, Inc. and Monticello. See e.g., Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11, 13, 18, 20-22, 23-25, 35, 85-89, 
94-99, 122, 124, 130-39. In the interest of clarity, and because it does not change the legal analysis, the Court will interpret 
references to ""Empire"" in the Amended Complaint, whether stating Defendant Empire or the Empire Defendants, as referring to 
both Empire Resorts, Inc. and Monticello."
622,4," Plaintiffs in their Amended Complaint refer to Genting New York, LLC as ""Genting USA."" Am. Compl. ¶ 40."
622,5," Although Plaintiffs define ""Kien Huat"" to include six defendants, they seem to use ""Kien Huat Realty"" and ""Kien Huat"" 
interchangeably. See Am. Compl. ¶ 36. Moreover, in their opposition to the Genting Defendants motion to dismiss Plaintiffs 
define ""Kien Huat"" to only include Kien Huat Realty and not the John Doe entities 1-5 as they do the Amended Complaint. See 
Pls.' Opp. Mem. to Genting Defendants (""Pls.' Opp. Mem. to Genting ) 1, Doc. 50. "
625,6, See supra note 2. 
628,7," Since the Court may dismiss the Amended Complaint on the basis of Plaintiffs' failure to allege a relevant market, it will not 
address whether Plaintiffs have adequately alleged conduct in violation of the antitrust laws. Integrated Sys. & Power, Inc. v. 
Honeywell Int'l. Inc., 713 F. Supp. 2d 286, 299 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (dismissing Section 1 case based on failure to allege a relevant 
product market and an antitrust injury, since ""each independently is grounds to dismiss the complaint under the rule of reason,"" 
and declining to address defendant's argument that the conduct alleged was inadequate to state an antitrust violation). "
630,8," When questioned about the allegations of harm to consumers at Oral Argument, Defendants merely responded that ""if"" there 
was a sufficient allegation of harm, Plaintiffs would then need to allege a relevant market and market power. Tr. 32:13-25 - 33:1-
11. "
631,9," In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs mention two potential additional markets, a ""Casino Gaming Market"" and a ""Casino 
Resort Tourism Market."" Am. Compl. ¶¶ 143-44. However, in their opposition papers, plaintiffs clarified that ""[t]he relevant 
market is the Racing/Gaming Market in the Catskills region. Pls.' Opp. Mem  [*40] to Empire 16 n.6. Moreover, at Oral 
Argument, Plaintiffs reiterated that there was only one relevant market the Catskills Racing/Gaming Market which draws tourists 
from a 100-mile radius from the Town of Thompson. Tr. 99.21-25 - 101:1-7."
631,10," Plaintiffs argue that they do not have to define a market on their Section 1 claim because they are alleging a per se violation. 
Tr. 99:21-25 - 101:1-7. However, as the Court has already ruled that Plaintiffs claims do not set forth a per se violation, Plaintiffs 
are indeed required to plead a relevant market. "
633,11," ""The New Concord Casino Resort's ""catchment area"" (an economic term referring to the county where the casino property is 
located along with the surrounding areas in which it generates the most concentrated economic activity) would be the area within 
a radius of approximately 100 miles from the Town of Thompson. . .that catchment area is known as the New York-Northeastern 
New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area. . .a 23 county area classified by the U.S. Office of 
Management and Budget as part of the 2010 U.S. Census. Am. Compl. ¶ 147."
633,12," ""The nearest resort casinos that offer entertainment and dining facilities that are comparable to those planned for the New 
Concord Casino Resort are . . . Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun in Connecticut[.]"" Am. Compl. ¶ 132"
633,13," ""Plaintiffs' New Concord Casino Resort would cater to both ""day-trippers"" residing in or close to the Catskills region and the 
traditional overnight tourists who currently account for 3.5 million visits annually to the Catskills region who comprise Monticello 
Casino's current consumer base, and to new overnight visitors principally from within an approximately 100 mile radius who 
would visit and stay at or near the New Concord Casino Resort  [*49] as a gaming and resort vacation destination, like the resort 
casinos in . . . Atlantic City."" Am. Compl. ¶ 157. "
634,14," The Amended Complaint does not explicitly assert that the proposed New Concord Casino Resort is ""unique."" "
635,15," In their opposition papers, Plaintiffs argue that a court in this district has accepted the ""narrow"" Atlantic; City gaming market as 
a plausible market and cite to Mirage Resorts, Inc. v. Trump, 97 Civ. 6693 (DAB), 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19896, 1998 WL 
898340 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22,1998). [*56]  Pls.' Opp. Mem. to Empire 17 n.7. However, in Mirage, the issue of a relevant market 
was not in dispute. "
636,16," Relatedly, Plaintiffs allege that there are five casinos within the relevant market as they define it. Am. Compl. ¶149. However, 
they do not identify them and utterly fail to explain, in light of the presence of the other four casinos, how it is that it is Monticello 
could have a 100% monopoly."
636,17," Although Kien Huat Realty and Genting NY do not file their motion on behalf of John Doe entities 1-5, they request that the 
Court dismiss the claims against John Doe entities 1-5 ""to the extent they are affiliates of Kien Huat Realty or Genting NY. 
Genting Defs.' Mem. 13 n.9, Doc. 46. However, for the sake of consistency and clarity, the Court will refer to Kien Huat Realty 
and Genting NY as the ""Genting Defendants"" in the following discussion, except where otherwise  [*61] noted. "
638,18," With respect to the allegation that Genting NY lobbied the New York State legislature  [*69] against the development of 
casinos within driving distance of the Resorts World Casino, Genting NY argues that Plaintiffs are not claiming that the lobbying 
was directed at the Concord site in particular, but rather against gaming facilities in general, Genting Defs.' Mem. 5, and that 
even if Plaintiffs had alleged that Genting NY lobbied against the development of the Concord site, its action is protected by the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which precludes antitrust claims based on lobbying. E.R.R. Presidents Conference, v. Noerr Motor 
Freight Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) (finding no antitrust liability for petitioning government for 
favorable and potentially anticompetitive legislation); see also Ottensmeyer v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co. of Md., 756 F.2d 
986, 993 (4th Cir. 1985) (""The policies behind the Noerr—Pennington doctrine include preserving an individual's first amendment 
right to petition government officials. ). Plaintiffs in response do not actually address whether Genting NY's lobbying efforts fall 
within the Noerr—Pennington doctrine, see Pls.' Opp. Mem. to Genting 13 n.11, and, accordingly, abandon this argument. "
639,19," In In re Elevator Antitrust Litigation, Plaintiffs asserted that defendants, in order to effect an antitrust conspiracy, participated in 
meetings in the United States and Europe to discuss pricing and market divisions, agreed to fax prices for elevators and 
services, rigged bids for sales and maintenance, exchanged price quotes, allocated markets for sales and maintenance, 
'collusively' required customers to enter long-term maintenance contracts, and collectively took actions to drive independent 
repair companies out of business. The Second Circuit explained that, ""[a]s  [*72] the district court observed, the complaint 
enumerates 'basically every type of conspiratorial activity that one could imagine . . . The list is in entirely general terms without 
any specification of any particular activities by any particular defendant[; it] is nothing more than a list of theoretical possibilities, 
which one could postulate without knowing any facts whatever.'"" 502 F.3d at 50-51 (citations omitted and brackets in original). "
641,20," Plaintiffs cite the following language in Daniel: ""[M]any of the officers and directors of ABEM were at one time, or are presently, 
affiliated with other co-conspirator institutions, including the hospital Defendants, or organizations in the specialty of emergency 
medicine . . . These interrelationships further enable ABEM and Diplomats of ABEM to control and influence the specialty of 
emergency medicine throughout the United States and to perpetrate and perpetuate anticompetitive conduct through their 
alleged conspiracies . . . Accordingly, Plaintiffs have stated a claim for conspiracy to monopolize."" 988 F. Supp. at 127. "
650,1," Orchard operates 90 stores in seven geographic markets in California, (""Central"" Region, ""Central-South Coast/Los Angeles 
County"" Region, ""East Bay"" Region, ""Monterey Bay"" Region, ""Orange County"" Region, ""San Francisco Peninsula"" Region, 
""Silicon Valley"" Region) as well as two stores in Oregon (""Portland"" region). Id.,  [**4] ¶ 147."
650,2," The power tool market Orchard refers to is one that contains seven professional-grade power tools. METCo, Makita and Black 
& Decker are the three leading suppliers of the full line of professional power tools. Id. ¶¶ 15, 31 & 70. "
651,3," Black & Decker, the third major supplier of ""professional"" power tools, is not similarly dependent on Home Depot for sales. Id. ¶ 
49. "
653,4," Notably, Orchard alleges that Black & Decker has come forward to confirm that it was approached, threatened, and punished 
by Home Depot, but does not allege that Home Depot ever implied to Black & Decker that it should end its relationship with 
Orchard because METCo and Makita were going to do so as well. "
658,5," ""[S]uppose that the defendant has entered into distinct tying or exclusive dealing contracts with four different purchasers. Each 
contract individually forecloses approximately 15 percent of the market in question and thus would ordinarily be insufficient to 
establish a violation. However, in the aggregate the contracts foreclose approximately 60 percent of the market, which is more 
than sufficient. In such a case it would clearly be improper for the court to examine each agreement with the same defendant 
separately, conclude that the agreement standing alone is insufficient to establish illegality, and dismiss the complaint without 
considering the impact of the aggregation."" 2 Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 310c1, p. 201-02 (3d ed. 2010). "
660,6," The SAC also alleged a claim based on tortious interference with Orchard's existing contractual relationships with its 
customers, but Orchard has dropped this aspect of its claim. Opp., at 24:13-16. "

668,4," This opinion will refer to the page numbers in the ECF versions of the R&R and Decision & Order. The opinions are also 
available at Precision Associates, Inc. v. Panalpina World Transport (Holding) Ltd., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51330, 2011 WL 
7053807 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2011), report and recommendation adopted by, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 113829, 2012 WL 3307486, 
(E.D.N.Y. Aug 13, 2012)."
668,5," In certain claims the plaintiffs allege that the defendants fixed ""surcharges"" (e.g., Claim 1 — Security Surcharge Agreement), 
and in others they allege that the defendants fixed ""rates,"" ""prices,"" or ""rate increases"" (e.g., Claim 6 — Peak Season Rate 
Increase Agreements). For ease of reference and because the parties do the same, the court will generally use the term 
""surcharge"" to refer to all such surcharges, rates, and rate increases. "
670,6," The defendants have provided the court with a useful chart that lists the claims and the defendants named in each that can be 
found at D.E. 783-1."
670,7," SDV Logistique Internationale also filed a motion to dismiss, D.E. 789, which has been withdrawn in light of that defendant's 
settlement with the plaintiffs, D.E. 859. "
673,8," For example, as the defendants recognize, the plaintiffs cite several cases where courts allowed the addition of representative 
plaintiffs for state law claims after finding that the existing plaintiffs had adequately alleged standing as to related claims. See In 
re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., 694 F. Supp. 2d 1302, 1329 (S.D. Fla. 2010); In re Flash Memory Antitrust Litig., 643 F. 
Supp. 2d 1133, 1164 (N.D. Cal. 2009); In re TFT-LCD Antitrust Litig., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1124 (N.D. Cal. 2008); In re 
Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., 540 F. Supp. 2d 1085, 1099 (N.D. Cal. 2007). "
675,9," As noted above, the TAC defines Freight Forwarding Services to ""include"" services relating to the organization of transportation of items via air and ship and can include related activities such as 
customs clearance, warehousing and ground services. The providers of this package of services are sometimes referred to 
as ""third party logistics providers,"" and are referred to in this Complaint as ""Freight Forwarders."" While  [*44] air and ocean 
freight forwarding services include ancillary truck and rail services, ""Freight Forwarding Services"" does not include 
transportation services related solely to truck and/or rail. (TAC ¶ 17). The TAC also defines ""U.S. Freight Forwarding Services"" as (a) Freight Forwarding Services purchased or sold in the United States regardless of the location of shipment or (b) Freight 
Forwarding Services with respect to shipments into, out of, or within the United States. (TAC ¶ 18)."
675,10," Although the plaintiffs assert that Claim 1 was previously ""upheld"" and that this is now law of the case, that is inaccurate. The 
defendants did not move to dismiss Claim 1 in the SAC on standing grounds and thus the court did not address the plaintiffs' 
standing as to that claim. "
676,11," Claim 1 also includes an allegation that, as to an initial iteration of the security surcharge at issue in that conspiracy, ""the 
Security Surcharge Defendants and others did impose, and Plaintiffs and class members did pay, a security surcharge on such 
air freight shipments including shipments into, out of and within the United States."" TAC ¶ 310 (emphasis added). "
679,12," Although the court does not apply a veil-piercing analysis, the allegations in the TAC are sufficient to allege that some of the 
parent defendants here controlled their subsidiaries as to the transactions at issue. See American Fuel Corp. v. Utah Energy 
Development Co., Inc., 122 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 1997) (""New York law requires the party seeking to pierce a corporate veil to 
make a two-part showing: (i) that the owner exercised complete domination over the corporation with respect to the transaction 
at issue; and (ii) that such domination was used to commit a fraud or wrong that injured the party seeking to pierce the veil."") 
(citing Morris v. New York State Dep't of Taxation & Fin., 82 N.Y.2d 135, 623 N.E.2d 1157, 603 N.Y.S.2d 807, 810-11 (1993)). "
680,13," Related to this point, the parties are in sharp disagreement as to the significance of the allegations in the TAC that certain 
defendants touted their integrated operations on their corporate websites. The court does not find it necessary to rely on these 
allegations in coming to its conclusions. "
681,14," The plaintiffs refer to the guilty pleas extensively in the TAC and have attached them to their opposition to the Joint Motion to 
Dismiss and the court may therefore properly consider them in connection with the motions. See ATSI Commc'ns, 493 F.3d at 
98; Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 322. "
682,15," One defendant directly admitted to utilizing a subsidiary to carry antitrust misconduct. See Plaintiff's Opp. to Joint Mot. To 
Dismiss, D.E. 829, Ex. G, at 5 (Kühne and Nagel International AG admitted to participating in a conspiracy through one of its 
subsidiaries that is not named in the TAC). "
684,16," The defendants attack the plausibility of a global agreement to pass on air and ocean surcharges, asserting that the alleged 
agreement related only to passing on air carrier charges. They thus argue it is not plausible that the global agreement would 
encompass the surcharges in claims 3, 5, and 6 which did not involve air carrier fees. The TAC does not allege, however, that 
the initial agreement was limited to air carrier surcharges — rather, the allegations in Claim 10 are that the defendants agreed to 
pass on air and ocean carrier surcharges as they came in, and in other instances refer generally to passing on of surcharges. 
See TAC ¶¶ 564-65. It is also plausible that the conspiracy evolved over time to include ocean surcharges."
684,17," TAC alleges that FFI was formerly called Freight Forwarders Europe (""FFE""). TAC ¶ 304. "
685,18," [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] see, e.g, TAC ¶ 306, 505, there is no allegation that they joined the global agreement by 
virtue of this association."
685,19," As noted above, the TAC defines ""U.S. Freight Forwarding Services"" as ""(a) Freight Forwarding Services purchased or sold in 
the United States regardless of the location of shipment or (b) Freight Forwarding Services with respect to shipments into, out of, 
or within the United States."" TAC ¶ 18. "
686,20," The FTAIA states: Sections 1 to 7 of this title [the Sherman Act] shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce (other than import 
trade or import commerce) with foreign nations unless— (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect— (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce with 
foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United 
States; and (2) such effect gives rise to a claim under the provisions of sections 1 to 7 of this title, other than this  [*89] section. 15 
U.S.C. § 6a. Although there is some disagreement in the courts as to whether the FTAIA limits the courts' subject matter jurisdiction or 
modifies the elements of a Sherman Act claim, the current binding Second Circuit law is that the statute is jurisdictional. See 
Filitech S.A. v. France Telecom S.A., 157 F.3d 922, 931 (2d Cir. 1998); see also Lotes Co., Ltd. v. Hon Hai Precision Industry 
Co. Ltd., No, 12-CV-7465, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 69407, 2013 WL 2099227, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 14, 2013); In re Vitamin C 
Antitrust Litigation, 904 F. Supp. 2d 310, 315 (E.D.N.Y. 2012). The defendants' motion is a facial attack on the sufficiency of the 
pleadings to invoke the court's jurisdiction."
686,21," Although the previous complaint could have been read to apply to foreign-to-foreign routes, neither party raised this issue. 
Both sides point out the other's failure to object to this aspect of the R&R, but neither side has made a waiver argument. 
Therefore, because there is no law of the case on this issue and because the merits have been fully briefed, the court will 
proceed to the substance of the dispute. "
687,22," In the R&R on the SAC, this court found that the ""relevant conduct""—the ""fixing of prices for the service of organizing and 
facilitating the transport of air cargo between locations abroad and the United States""—involved import commerce, or in the 
alternative had a ""direct, substantial, and foreseeable effect"" on import trade or import commerce, and that ""the Sherman Act 
claim arises out of that effect."" R&R at 71 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 6a(1)(A), (2)). In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the 
fact that the defendants' alleged antitrust misconduct affected goods physically moving into, out of, and within the United States 
commerce.  [*92] Because this motion is concerned with different conduct, the prior FTAIA ruling has no direct applicability to 
the discussion that follows. "
689,23," Although these statistics focus on freight forwarding services for ""imports into and exports out of"" the United States, these 
figures demonstrate the extent of the United States market and its connection to the global one."
689,24," The plaintiffs cite as additional evidence of a domestic effect that ""Plaintiffs, U.S. businesses, purchased U.S. Freight 
Forwarding Services in the U.S., and likely paid from U.S. bank accounts."" Joint FTAIA Opp., D.E. 828, at 6. Although the TAC 
does not allege that the purchases were made from United States bank accounts, this is a reasonable inference to be drawn. 
Nevertheless, the court is reluctant  [*101] to place any particular weight on the geographical location of the source of payment 
for goods or services as evidence of an effect on domestic commerce. "
690,25," The other cases cited by the defendants similarly involved indirect effects on United States markets. See McGlinchy v. Shell 
Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 813-15 (9th Cir. 1988) (finding effects on U.S. market insufficient where the defendants terminated an 
agreement with the American plaintiff for services in Southeast Asia); Eurim—Pharm GmbH v. Pfizer, Inc., 593 F. Supp. 1102, 
1106-07 (S.D.N.Y. 1984) (""spillover effect"" on domestic commerce not enough). "
691,26," Similarly, in another case relied on by the defendants, the court found that it was ""fairly indisputable"" that allegations that ""U.S. 
residents and citizens paid more for air passenger transportation"" was a direct effect on United States commerce for the purpose 
of the first prong of the inquiry. In re Transpacific Passenger Air Transp. Antitrust Litig., No. 07-CV-05634, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
49853, 2011 WL 1753738, at *6 (N.D. Cal. May 9, 2011). The court nonetheless found that the plaintiffs' ""foreign injury"" there did 
not arise from the domestic effect on United States purchasers, failing the second prong of the inquiry. 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
49853, [WL] at *5-7. Although the court there defined the ""foreign injury"" as ""overcharges associated with flights originating in 
Asia,"" 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49853, [WL] at *3, it did not clearly articulate whether those purchases were made in Asia, or in the 
United States, or elsewhere. Thus it is not at all clear whether the court's analysis concerning the second prong in that case has 
any relevance here, which relates solely to the purchase in the United States of foreign-to-foreign freight forwarding services. "
693,27," The plaintiffs also object to the grouping of ABX Logistics Worldwide NV/SA with the other three DSV entities, arguing that it 
was purchased by DSV A/S in September 2008 after the  [*118] relevant events in the TAC took place. See TAC ¶ 58. The TAC 
names ABX separately in the caption of the individual claims and includes separate factual allegations against it. Indeed, ABX is 
named in claims that do not name DSV as a defendant. There is also no assertion in the TAC that a reference to ""ABX"" is meant 
to bind any other DSV entity. See TAC ¶ 61. Regardless, the court need not parse this distinction at this stage because the 
allegations against DSV are sufficient to state a claim against the moving defendants. "
694,28," This grouping includes ABX Logistics Worldwide NV/SA, which has entered into a separate settlement agreement with the 
plaintiffs. D.E. 715. Thus the court does address whether the allegations against ""DSV"" are sufficient to bind ABX. "
695,29," The TAC also asserts claims against Geodis in Claims 1, 5, and 8, but Geodis only attacks the plausibility of these claims 
against them on grouping grounds. Geodis also re-raises the personal jurisdiction argument that the court previously rejected in 
order to preserve its right to re-assert that defense after jurisdictional discovery has been completed. "
696,30," The only case that the defendants cite to dispute the application of the slight evidence rule is inapplicable here because, as 
they recognize, it was decided on a summary judgment standard. See Geodis Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, D.E. 807, at 
 [*128] 9 (citing Fears v. Wilhelmina Model Agency, Inc., No. 02-CV-4911, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4502, 2004 WL 594396, at *15 
(Mar. 23, 2004)). "
698,31," See also Toll Holdings Limited Annual Report for 2009, at 77, available at http://www.tollgroup.com/annual-reports (stating that 
Toll launched of ""full takeover"" of Baltrans in December 2007, acquired majority ownership in February 2008, and 100% 
ownership in March 2008) (incorporated into TAC at ¶ 156 and considered by the court pursuant to ATSI Commc'ns, 493 F.3d at 
98 and Tellabs, 551 U.S. at 322). "
702,32, The plaintiffs have not advocated partial severance nor would there be any practical benefit from such a result. 
708,1," In its Notice of Motion, Blizzard states that it moves for a finding of liability as to its first cause of action for intentional 
interference with contractual relations, its second cause of action for breach of contract, and its fourth cause of action for unfair 
competition in violation of California Business & Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq. (""UCL""). Blizzard's third cause of action is 
captioned ""unjust enrichment,"" which is not itself a separate legal claim. See Melchior v. New Line Prod., Inc., 106 Cal. App. 4th 
779, 793 (2003). And although it is not precisely a remedy either, the Court agrees this issue is more amenable to resolution in a 
damages phase."
708,2," The Court declines to set forth a detailed ruling on every objection raised by the parties, particularly those not material to the 
Court's rulings."
708,3," In a procedure that has become familiar to the vast majority of internet users, installation of WoW software requires assent to 
the EULA and ToU via a dialog box that conditions installation of the software upon the user's mouse click indicating acceptance 
of the software provider's terms. (See Rice Decl. ¶¶ 28-31.) Access to game play requires such assent. (Id. ¶ 31.) "
709,4," Various versions of the EULA and the ToU have been used, but all versions used since at least October 2007 have contained 
this prohibition. (Rice Decl. Ex. 2.)"
709,5," In addition to the Bots, Defendants also offer for sale an ""enhancement"" to Pocket Gnome, called ""Pocket Goblin,"" which is a 
collection of software ""hacks"" or ""cheats"" that allow players to engage in activities normally restricted by the game, such as 
flying, walking through walls, or moving faster. (Becker Depo. at 148-54.)"
709,6," The specifics of the pricing structure are not fully supported by the evidence cited, which consists of deposition testimony and 
PayPal records; however, in their Statement of Disputed Facts, Defendants expressly agree these facts are uncontroverted. 
(Compare Docket No. 86-1 ¶ 52) (setting forth  [**8] pricing structure), with Docket No. 140 ¶ 30 (no objection to substance of 
Blizzard's ¶ 52).)"
709,7," The evidence cited does not establish that at any given time, there are 100-120 of Defendants' Bots running in WoW; however, 
Defendants agree these facts are uncontroverted. (Compare Docket No. 86-1 ¶ 54 (Blizzard's proffered fact), with Docket No. 
140 ¶ 31 (Defendants concur with Blizzard's proffered fact except as to the use the term ""exponentially"").) "
711,8," Defendants purport to dispute this fact, but the evidence cited does not dispute the Rice Declaration on this topic. (See Defs.' 
Statement of Disputed Facts ¶ 11 (citing Rice Depo. at 63-65).) Because the Bots are specifically designed to be difficult to 
detect, Rice compared the email addresses used to purchase the Bots with email addresses used to set up WoW accounts. 
 [**13] (Rice Decl. ¶ 42.) In doing so, he found that emails used to purchased the Bots were associated with over 1,400 
disciplinary actions by WoW for botting and related activity. (Id. & Ex. 8.) "
712,9," The Court disagrees that certain evidence regarding Defendants' knowledge somehow absolves Defendants of liability. (See 
Defs' Motion at 4-5.) Specifically, Defendants argue that they expressly warn their customers that use of the software violates 
the terms of the EULA and ToU; thus, the responsibility for any breach belongs solely to their users. However, this warning does 
not have the effect of transferring the Defendants' legal responsibility for Defendants' actions to their users. Instead, this 
evidence establishes Defendants' knowledge of the probability that their users will breach the EULA and ToU; thus, establishing 
the second element of Blizzard's tortious interference claim. "
713,10," These actions are continuing in nature; thus, the Court rejects Defendants' ""timing"" argument that points to an absence of 
evidence regarding the possible lack of an existing contract between Blizzard and a botting software purchaser at the time the 
botting software is purchased from Defendants. (See Defs.' Motion at 2-3.) Thus, because Defendants continue to support their 
customers' WoW game play using the Bots long after purchase, the timing argument is unpersuasive.  [**20] Moreover, even if 
this were not the case, the uncontroverted evidence establishes that WoW game players purchase month-to-month licenses of 
the botting software; thus, eventually the existence of a WoW account will eventually precede the monthly renewal of a botting 
software license in the vast majority of the time."
713,11," The Court disagrees with Defendants'  [**21] contention that these expenditures ""are not damages, but are mere prophylactic 
measures [Blizzard] has chosen to take to address its perceived problem."" (Defs.' Motion at 2.) By analogy, repairing a hole in a 
dam may be prophylactic, but it also has a cost. "
714,12," Blizzard also contends that it is entitled to summary judgment on its UCL claim under the ""unfair"" prong. HN10[
] An ""unfair"" 
business practice consists of ""conduct that threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of 
one of those laws because  [**23] its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or otherwise significantly 
threatens or harms competition."" Cel-Tech Commc'ns, 20 Cal. 4th at 187. ""[A]n 'unfair' business practice occurs when it offends 
an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to 
consumers."" People v. Casa Blanca Convalescent Homes, 159 Cal.App.3d 509, 530, 206 Cal.Rptr. 164 (1984). Blizzard does 
not separately articulate why the unfair prong applies to Defendants' conduct. Therefore, and because summary judgment under 
the unlawful prong authorizes the remedies available under the UCL, the Court does not consider whether summary judgment in 
Blizzard's favor is warranted under the unfair prong of the UCL claim."
714,13," Because the Court has granted summary judgment in favor of Blizzard, Blizzard has not only a likelihood of success on the 
merits but also actual success on the merits of its claims. "
718,1," For purpose of the pending motion, Plantronics agrees that the Court should treat POD agreements as exclusive dealing 
arrangements. (Tr. at 4)"
718,2," Although Plantronics attached an unauthenticated POD agreement to its Opening Brief (D.I. 10), Plantronics is no longer 
relying  [**8] on this exhibit for purpose of this motion. (Tr. at 9)"
718,3," Plantronics also contends that an antitrust injury cannot result ""from agreements that can be terminated with ease."" (D.I. 14 at 
2) But whether SIDs have an actual choice in terminating Plantronics' POD agreements is a factual question that will only be 
resolved following discovery. See, e.g., United States v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 194 (3d Cir. 2005) (finding harm to 
competition ""in spite of the legal ease with which the relationship can be terminated,"" because ""the dealers have a strong 
economic incentive to continue"" with relationship). "
720,4," While GN concedes that Plantronics' SEC documents by themselves may not be sufficient to establish a relevant market, GN 
offers the documents as evidence of ""industry recognition,"" which is one of the ""market-defining"" factors in Brown Shoe. (See Tr. 
at 38) "
728,1," Novell's successor as owner of WordPerfect, Caldera, settled antitrust claims with Microsoft in 1996. The Fourth Circuit held 
that Novell's Asset Purchase Agreement with Caldera did not encompass Novell's remaining claim before us; in other words, 
Novell did not transfer its operating systems market claim to Caldera. See Novell, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 429 F. App'x 254, 261 
(4th Cir. 2011). "
729,2," Section 2 addresses not just successful monopolies but also attempted ones, allowing liability when the defendant ""intends"" to 
achieve a monopoly and comes ""dangerous[ly]"" close to achieving it. See Spectrum Sports v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 459, 113 
S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993). In this case, though, Novell doesn't pursue an attempt claim, only one for unlawful 
monopoly maintenance. "
732,3," Something that wound up happening anyway, despite antitrust's intervention. For an interesting account of this history and of 
questions surrounding market definition in Aspen, see Jeffrey Macher & John Mayo, Making a Market Out of a Molehill? 
Geographic Market Definition in Aspen Skiing, 6 J. Competition L. & Econ. 911 (2010). "
734,4," There is still another feature of refusal to deal doctrine worth mention. In Trinko, the Supreme Court emphasized that the 
monopolist in Aspen effectively refused to deal with its smaller rival even on terms it offered everyone else. See Aspen, 472 U.S. 
at 593; Trinko, 540 U.S. at 410. The Aspen Skiing Company sold its tickets at retail price to others, and participated in a town-
wide system of credit, but when its smaller rival Aspen Highlands offered to pay retail with credit  [**38] the monopolist initially 
refused. Since Aspen and Trinko, some have suggested that this kind of discrimination is also an essential element to any claim 
for a refusal to deal. See, e.g., MetroNet Servs. Corp. v. Qwest Corp., 383 F.3d 1124, 1132-33 (9th Cir. 2004). At the same time, 
it's conceivable a monopolist might at least sometimes have procompetitive rationales for treating a rival differently (say, 
because it's more costly to deal with distant rivals than other nearby customers). See Four Corners, 582 F.3d at 1225 (hospital 
justified in refusing to deal with particular doctor because it was unprofitable for the hospital to do so). And one can question 
whether discrimination is necessary to establish potential for competitive harm. Our analysis, after all, already seeks to ascertain 
whether a monopolist's conduct makes any economic sense. Neither are we sure how a discrimination rule might apply to a 
situation like this case where the contested conduct (withdrawing NSEs) affected only rivals. So far, our cases haven't decided 
whether discrimination is essential for success in a refusal to deal case or just helpful to its cause. Neither must we here 
because, as we've seen, Novell's  [**39] refusal to deal claim fails anyway. "
736,5," Novell points to dicta in Christy Sports suggesting that ""[w]e would not even preclude the theoretical possibility that"" a 
defendant's change in business model ""could  [**44] give rise to an antitrust claim, for example, if by first inviting an investment 
and then disallowing the use of the investment the [defendant] imposed costs on a competitor that had the effect of injuring 
competition in a relevant market."" 555 F.3d at 1196. The court in Christy Sports proceeded to hold, however, that the plaintiffs in 
that case couldn't succeed because they didn't satisfy the profit sacrifice test. Id. at 1197 (dismissing because ""we have no 
indication that [the defendant] is terminating a profitable business relationship""); see also Four Corners, 582 F.3d at 1225 (""[I]n 
Christy Sports, we held that 'the key fact' permitting liability in Aspen Skiing 'was that the defendant terminated a profitable 
relationship without any economic justification.'"") (quoting Christy Sports, 555 F.3d at 1197). The dicta, moreover, is open to 
considerable interpretation on its own terms. To the extent the dicta suggests liability may attach based on deceptive conduct by 
a dominant firm, we've already seen why Novell can't prevail. To the extent the dicta suggests raising rivals' cost theory 
displaces the profit sacrifice test within the traditional refusal to deal context, that cannot  [**45] be the case. As we have already 
seen, unilateral refusals to deal are almost always lawful. Trinko, 540 U.S. at 409. Cases that meet the profit sacrifice test 
represent a ""limited exception."" Id. Where, as here, there is no evidence that the defendant has sacrificed short-term profits to 
further an anticompetitive agenda, the plaintiff cannot prevail. "
747,1," Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without 
a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. Accordingly, the hearing set for September 30, 2013 at 1:30 p.m. is hereby 
vacated and off calendar. "
748,2," For additional factual background see the Court's June 21, 2013 Order Granting Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaims. 
(Dkt. No. 72.)"
748,3," The FACC also mentions intentional interference with Alternative's independent contractors and employees. (FACC ¶ 72.) 
These claims, however, were dismissed by the Court's June 21, 2013 Order granting Epicor's motion to dismiss Alternative's 
original counterclaims, and the FACC contains no new allegations pertaining to these claims. (See Dkt. No. 72 at 11-12.) "
749,4," The relevant market has been defined in the Court's June 21, 2013 Order as companies that provide implementation and 
support services for the Epicor 9 Platform. (Dkt. No. 72.) "
763,1," Facebook has provided the 2009 and [**7]  2011 versions of the policies, in addition to the originally cited 2012 versions. (D.I. 
18 Exs. 11-14) For purposes of the motion to dismiss, the Court will consider the 2009 and 2011 versions of the policies. "
764,2," Kickflip alleges that the 2011 policy conditioned access to Facebook's social-game marketplace on the use of Facebook 
Credits. (D.I. 1 at 12)"
764,3," As the Court has found that Kickflip has adequately alleged pretext, the Court need not reach Kickflip's other asserted grounds 
for surviving the motion to dismiss, i.e., Kickflip's theory of intent and preparedness to re-enter the virtual-currency market. "
765,4," Facebook requests that if the Court denies its motion, that the Court order discovery on the limited issue of standing. (D.I. 16 at 
10 n.10) By separate order, the Court will grant this request. "
772,1," UPMC in its motion to dismiss and brief in support argues the second amended complaint is ""procedurally improper"" under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 because plaintiffs did not request and receive leave of court prior to filing the second 
amended complaint. (ECF No. 95 ¶ 1; ECF No. 96 at 7.) UPMC argues in light of the motion for preliminary approval of 
settlement that was  [*11] pending at the time UPMC filed its motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, plaintiffs' claims 
do not satisfy the joinder requirement because ""Highmark's presence [in the lawsuit] is a collusive sham."" (ECF No. 96 at 13.) 
The court at the hearing on the pending motions to dismiss commented: The first issue I want to take up with respect to UPMC is the issue concerning Rule 15 and whether there was a violation of 
Rule 15 in filing the second amended complaint. And also there's the improper joinder issue, but I think that's moot now 
because the settlement is no longer in place between Highmark and the plaintiffs. So, that is moot. The question on Rule 15, the Court has flexibility under Rule 15 and, as pointed out, leave would be freely given. I don't 
want to elevate substance over form. This is the type of situation where leave would have been given and so I think that is 
moot. (H.T. 7/1/13 (ECF No. 235) at 3-4.) Counsel for UPMC declined to be heard further with respect to those issues. (Id. at 4.) The 
court having decided those issues on the record at the hearing will not address them in this opinion."
772,2," The factual background is derived from the factual allegations in the second amended complaint, which are accepted as true 
for purposes of deciding the motions to dismiss. U.S. Express Lines Ltd. v. Higgins, 281 F.3d 383, 388 (3d Cir. 2002) (""When 
considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts accept as true the allegations in the complaint and its attachments, as well as 
reasonable inferences construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.""). "
773,3," According to plaintiffs, Highmark in the brief commented, in pertinent part: Defendant [UPMC] asserts that the Takeover is justified because Highmark has allegedly engaged in anticompetitive 
behavior. Remarkably, as an example of such behavior, Defendant cites Highmark's rejection of Defendant's overtures to 
attempt to form a ""super"" monopoly for the provision of health care in Western Pennsylvania in which UPMCHS, the leading 
provider of hospital services, and Highmark, the leading health insurer, would combine forces. (ECF No. 90 ¶ 74.)"
773,4," Plaintiffs allege that in the fall of 2005, the board chairman of Highmark admitted to the board chairman of WPAHS ""that 
Highmark was colluding with UPMC and that what Highmark was doing with UPMC was ""probably illegal."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 31.)"
773,5," Plaintiffs allege various government agencies have investigated ""UPMC's and Highmark's Illegal Conduct."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 181-
89.) "
775,6," Plaintiffs allege:  [*24] ""UPMC has also used its market power to coerce third parties, including the Veterans Administration 
Pittsburgh Healthcare System (the ""VA""), which is staffed in significant part by residents from UPMC."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 176-80.)"
775,7," Plaintiffs allege: West Penn Allegheny was formed by a combination in August 2000 of The Western Pennsylvania Healthcare System, 
comprised of The Western Pennsylvania Hospital (""West Penn"") and Suburban General Hospital, and the Pittsburgh-based 
hospitals formerly affiliated with AHERF, including Allegheny General Hospital (""AGH""), Allegheny Valley Hospital (now the 
Alle-Kiski Medical Center), Forbes Regional Hospital (now The Western Pennsylvania Hospital — Forbes Regional 
Campus), and Canonsburg General Hospital. (ECF No. 90 ¶ 37.) "
776,8," Plaintiffs allege: ""UPMC's unilateral ability to set rates wherever it desires, and its ability to favor certain insurers over others, is 
evidence of the extraordinary market power that UPMC exercised and continues to exercise, and results in antitrust injury and 
damages, market injury and damages, and class injury and damages."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 170.)"
776,9," Plaintiffs in the second amended complaint refer to Highmark's competitors as ""United Healthcare,"" ""Coventry,"" ""Aetna,"" and 
""CIGNA."" The court in this opinion will, therefore, refer to Highmark's competitors by those names. "
777,10," According to plaintiffs, the effect of UPMC's unwillingness to deal reasonably with outside insurers was confirmed by the report 
dated September 10, 2008, prepared for the PID, which stated: [O]ne area of competitive concern raised in our interviews with market participants in western Pennsylvania involves key 
gaps in provider networks for some of Highmark's main competitors and potential competitors, such  [*28] as Health 
America and United. According to Highmark data, both Health America and United do not have contracts with two of the 
flagship UPMC hospitals located in the Pittsburgh area, UPMC Presbyterian and UPMC Shadyside. Some market 
participants have indicated concern that limitations in contracting with UPMC derive from a previous agreement between 
Highmark and UPMC. (ECF No. 90 ¶ 89.) Plaintiffs offer by way of further example the exclusion of United Healthcare, ""a well-capitalized company with 
a strong track record of success in many markets across the United States,"" from the health insurance market in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania. (Id. ¶¶ 90-93.)"
777,11," According to the second amended complaint, a report prepared for the Pennsylvania Insurance Department provides that 
Highmark has ""substantial market power"" in Western Pennsylvania. (ECF No. 90 ¶ 215.) "
778,12," Plaintiffs allege ""a significant portion of the commercial enrollees in the UPMC Health Plan are UPMC employees and their 
dependents, who are automatically enrolled in the UPMC Health Plan."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 211.)"
778,13," Plaintiffs allege that ""[w]hen West Penn Allegheny requested improved reimbursement rates in 2005 and 2006, Highmark CEO 
Dr. Melani said he could not increase West Penn Allegheny's rates because of Highmark's agreement with UPMC to block 
United's entry into the  [*33] Pittsburgh market."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 140.) Plaintiffs by way of further example of how the rate 
discrimination harmed WPAHS allege ""Highmark has systematically underpaid West Penn Allegheny for emergency care 
service"" and ""discriminated against West Penn Allegheny in the award of grants to improve the quality of medical care in the 
Pittsburgh medical community."" (Id. ¶¶ 143, 146.) "
779,14," According to plaintiffs: ""Highmark did not agree to properly narrow the reimbursement gap between West Penn Allegheny and 
UPMC until Summer 2008, when it acted under the pressure of the Department of Justice's continuing investigation of 
Highmark's and UPMC's illegal conspiracy."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 148.)"
779,15," Plaintiffs allege Romoff ""has admitted that 'No-Tiering-No-Steering' provisions result in increased costs to consumers,"" and 
that such an admission is a concession ""that a prohibition against tiering and steering will increase costs."" (ECF No. 90 ¶¶ 161, 
163.) According to plaintiffs, ""as such, UPMC has admitted the antitrust injury resulting from its ""No-Tiering-No-Steering"" 
provisions."" (Id. ¶ 163.)"
779,16," According to plaintiffs, Ken Melani, president and chief executive officer of Highmark, ""attempted to conceal the real reason for 
this action by falsely telling the press that Highmark needed to cut administrative costs."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 97.) Plaintiffs allege 
""[n]ot only did Dr. Melani's statements contradict Highmark's previous, multi-year marketing campaign for Community Blue as a 
low-cost alternative, but small business groups in the region expressed their dismay at losing a low-cost health insurance 
option."" (Id. ¶ 98.) "
781,17," For a plaintiff to properly allege a plausible antitrust violation under § 1, he or she must set forth factual allegations to show 
""(1) 'that the defendant was a party to a contract, combination ... or conspiracy' and (2) 'that the conspiracy  [*41] to which the 
defendant was a party imposed an unreasonable restraint on trade.'"" Burtch, 662 F.3d at 221 (quoting In re Ins. Brokerage 
Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 315 (3d Cir. 2010)). For a plaintiff to properly allege an antitrust violation under § 2, he or she must set forth factual allegations to show the 
defendant's ""'(1) [] possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that 
power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic 
accident.'"" Race Tires Am., Inc., Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 614 F.3d 57, 75 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Eastman Kodak Co. v. 
Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 481, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992))."
781,18," The measure of damages for plaintiffs' claim for tortuous interference with contractual relations asserted under Pennsylvania 
common law against UPMC is based upon Highmark's ""artificially inflated premium costs."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 268.) UPMC does not 
argue that claim is barred by the filed rate doctrine. UPMC argues this court should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over 
that claim and it is untimely because it was filed after the expiration of the applicable  [*42] two-year statute of limitations. (ECF 
No. 96 at 19; ECF No. 124 at 9-10.) UPMC's arguments with respect to plaintiffs' claim for tortious interference with existing and 
prospective contractual relations will be addressed in part D infra. "
782,19," The Court rejected the argument that to avoid discriminatory rates all shippers injured may sue to recover based upon the 
difference in rates. Keogh, 260 U.S. at 164. The Court reasoned that it was ""highly improbable"" all courts and juries would 
provide each shipper ""the same measure of relief."" Id "
785,20," To the extent claims are asserted against defendants in this case based upon the reasonableness of rates paid by individuals, 
e.g., Pamela Lang, those claims are barred by the filed rate doctrine. 40 Pa. Stat. § 3801.303 (""Each insurer shall file with the 
department rates for individual accident and health insurance policies which it proposes to use in this Commonwealth except 
those rates which, in the opinion of the commissioner,  [*57] cannot practicably be filed before they are used.""). "
788,21," Plaintiffs also distinguish Korte because it was not an antitrust action and ""there was no contention in that case that 
anticompetitive activity had corrupted the market forces that were supposed to determine what rates were charged within the 
'flexibility band.'"" (ECF No. 222 at 9.) One might assert that this argument supports plaintiffs' contention that the filed rate 
doctrine does not bar their claims because they alleged the UPMC-Highmark conspiracy excluded Highmark's competitors from 
the market. See Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 1144, 1159 (3d Cir. 1993).  [*69] The applicability of the filed 
rate doctrine, however, is not based upon culpable conduct by the defendant. H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., 954 F.2d 
485, 489, 492 (8th Cir. 1992) (rejecting the plaintiffs' argument ""that the filed rate doctrine does not apply in the face of 
fraudulent conduct"" because ""the [defendants'] underlying conduct does not control whether the filed rate doctrine applies. 
Rather, the focus for determining whether the filed rate doctrine applies is the impact the court's decision will have on agency 
procedures and rate determinations.""); Simon v. Keyspan Corp., 785 F.Supp.2d 120 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (""Simon I""). ""Thus, 
'[a]pplication of the filed rate doctrine in any particular case is not determined by the culpability of the defendant's conduct or the 
possibility of inequitable results.'"" Simon I, 785 F.Supp.2d at 138 (quoting Marcus v. AT&T Corp., 138 F.3d 46, 58 (2d Cir. 
1998)). The filed rate doctrine applies when its principles are implicated by a measure of damages based upon rates approved 
by an administrative agency. The PID approved the rates, i.e., the range of rates, charged by Highmark in this case, and 
plaintiffs are requesting damages based  [*70] upon the difference between the approved rates Highmark charged and a 
hypothetical rate Highmark should have charged absent the UPMC-Highmark conspiracy. Plaintiffs' claims for damages are, 
therefore, barred under Keogh. "
791,22," Whether claims based upon this measure of damages would be barred by Keogh depends in large part upon whether 
Highmark's competitors were required to file their rates with the PID or were exempt from the filing requirement under section 
(d). This court is also not aware whether those competitors had approved rates which were lower than Highmark's approved 
 [*82] rates. "
793,23," At  [*89] the hearing with respect to the pending motions to dismiss, plaintiffs suggested to the court that a LECG report with 
""extensive findings about the barriers of entry to the health insurance market and about its findings that Highmark had 
substantial market power"" could be incorporated by reference into the second amended complaint. (H.T. 7/1/2013 (ECF No. 
235) at 44-45.) Plaintiffs argued the document, which is 193 pages, is publicly available and they quoted extensively from it in 
the complaint. (Id. at 45.) Highmark following the hearing filed a ""Response to Plaintiffs' Request to Take Judicial Notice of the 
LECG Report."" (ECF No. 214.) Plaintiffs replied to Highmark's response and asserted, among other things, that ""[p]laintiffs' 
claims are in no way dependent upon the Court considering the LECG Report, which only substantiates the SAC's adequately 
pled claims."" (ECF No. 217 at 5) (emphasis in original.) The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has commented: As a general matter, a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings. 
Angelastro, 764 F.2d at 944. However, an exception to the general rule is that a ""document integral to or explicitly 
 [*90] relied upon in the complaint"" may be considered ""without converting the motion [to dismiss] into one for summary 
judgment."" Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1220 (emphasis added); see also Trump, 7 F.3d at 368 n. 9 (""a court may consider an 
undisputedly authentic document that a defendant attaches as an exhibit to a motion to dismiss if the plaintiff's claims are 
based on the document."") (quoting Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3rd 
Cir.1993)). The rationale underlying this exception is that the primary problem raised by looking to documents outside the complaint-
lack of notice to the plaintiff-is dissipated ""[w]here plaintiff has actual notice ... and has relied upon these documents in 
framing the complaint."" Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3-4 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Cortec Indus., Inc. v. Sum Holding L.P., "
794,949," F.2d 42, 48 (2nd Cir.1991)); see also San Leandro, 75 F.3d at 808-09. What the rule seeks to prevent is the situation in 
which a plaintiff is able to maintain a claim of fraud by extracting an isolated statement from a document and placing it in 
the complaint, even though if the statement were examined in the full context of the document, it would be  [*91] clear that 
the statement was not fraudulent. See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1220. ... [T]he language in both Trump and Shaw makes clear that what is critical is whether the claims in the complaint are ""based"" 
on an extrinsic document and not merely whether the extrinsic document was explicitly cited. See Trump, 7 F.3d at 368 n. 
9; Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1220. In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). Plaintiffs' concession in their response that their ""claims are in no way dependent upon the Court considering the LECG Report"" 
indicates the LECG Report is not integral to their claims, i.e., their claims are not based upon that document. Although plaintiffs 
cite to the document and quote from it the second amended complaint, the court declines to consider the entirety of the 193-
page document in deciding the pending motions to dismiss. See In re Schering Plough Corp, Intron/Temodar Consumer Class 
Action, 678 F.3d 235, 250-51 (3d Cir. 2012) (""Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2), a complaint should set forth a ""short and plain 
statement"" of the claim to relief. Plaintiffs cannot be permitted to incorporate an endless series of external documents into a 
complaint simply ""by  [*92] reference"" to them, as this would lead to an impossible task for defendants in filing their answers, 
and for courts in reviewing the sufficiency of complaints.)."
794,24," The court's discussion infra  [*94] is limited to addressing Highmark's argument that plaintiffs did not sufficiently allege it had 
market power with respect to counts IV and V of the second amended complaint. The parties did not brief and the court does not 
address whether plaintiffs set forth factual allegations sufficient to satisfy the other elements of a claim for monopolization or 
attempted monopolization under § 2."
794,25," ""Monopoly power under § 2 requires 'something greater' than market power under § 1."" Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino 
Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d 430, 442 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 481). "
796,26," The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has identified the following five ""main sources of entry barriers:"" ""(1) legal license 
requirements; (2) control of an essential or superior resource; (3) entrenched buyer preferences for established brands; (4) 
capital market evaluations imposing higher capital costs on new entrants; and, in some situations, (5) economies of scale."" 
Rebel Oil Co., Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1439 (8th Cir. 1995)."
796,27," Plaintiffs allege the relevant market with respect to Highmark is the market of ""health care financing and administration for 
private employers and individuals,  [*102] including indemnity insurance, managed care products such as HMO, PPO, or POS 
plans, and third-party administration of employer self-funded health plans."" (ECF No. 90 ¶ 210.) The court will refer to this 
market as the ""relevant market"" in this section of the opinion."
796,28," As discussed supra, monopoly power is a substantial degree of market power. Having concluded plaintiffs alleged facts to 
support the conclusion that Highmark possessed monopoly power in the relevant market, the court will not address whether 
plaintiffs sufficiently alleged Highmark had market power for the purpose of their attempted monopolization claim. The court 
notes, however, that [t]o say that one who has monopolized has also attempted to monopolize is redundant and adds nothing to the scope of 
available remedies. The attempt is merged into the completed offense. Of course, the plaintiff may plead both offenses and 
allow the court to base its disposition on either or neither offense as the evidence emerges. "
797,," AREEDA & HOVENKAMP, FUNDAMENTALS OF ANTITRUST LAW, supra at 8-35. At least two courts of appeals to consider the issue have 
held that a defendant that actually monopolizes a market cannot be held liable for attempting  [*103] to monopolize the market. 
Re/Max Int'l, Inc. v. Realty One, Inc., 173 F.3d 995, 1021 (6th Cir. 1999) (""Of course, the evidence supporting Re/Max's claim 
that the defendants have monopoly power cuts against its theories of attempted monopolization and conspiracy to 
monopolize.""); Olympia Equip. Leasing Co. v. W. Union Tel. Co., 797 F.2d 370, 373 (7th Cir. 1986) (""Olympia's complaint also 
charges attempted monopolization, but in a case such as this where the plaintiff presents (as we shall see) adequate evidence 
of monopoly power, he can get no mileage out of charging attempted as well as completed monopolization.""). In LePage's Inc. v. 
3M, 324 F.3d 141, 169 (3d Cir. 2003), the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit did not address the particular issue, but declined 
to ""consider the correctness of the District Court's ruling on the attempted monopolization claim because [it upheld] its decision 
on the monopolization claim."" The court noted: ""The jury returned the same amount of damages on both claims and LePage's 
concedes that under those circumstances discussion of the attempted monopolization is unnecessary."" Id. "
802,29," UPMC first argued that for Highmark's involvement in the conspiracy to be truly complete, Highmark had to be ""more culpable"" 
than UPMC. (ECF No. 96 at 15.) UPMC abandoned that argument in its supplemental brief filed after the hearing with respect to 
the pending motions to dismiss. UPMC in its supplemental brief noted: ""A co-conspirator's involvement is 'truly complete' only 
where the co-conspirator is at least a 'substantially equal participant' in the alleged wrongdoing."" (Id. (quoting Hess I, 424 F.3d at 
383)); (ECF No. 219 at 7 n.2).) "
803,30," As the court noted in Wallach, following Bateman courts applied the second prong of the two-part test, which specifically refers 
to securities law, to antitrust suits, i.e., ""preclusion of suit cannot significantly interfere with the enforcement of antitrust laws."" 
Wallach, 814 F.Supp.2d at 437 n.4. UPMC does not argue and the court sees no reason why the preclusion of a lawsuit filed by 
Highmark against UPMC based upon the facts alleged in the second amended complaint would interfere with the enforcement of 
antitrust laws. The court will, therefore, focus its inquiry on whether Highmark's involvement in the UPMC-Highmark conspiracy 
was truly complete. "
804,31," UPMC argues plaintiffs lack antitrust standing because plaintiffs' alleged  [*134] injuries are too remote. (ECF No. 96 at 18.) 
UPMC's argument is based upon Highmark being a ""more direct victim of UPMC's alleged actions."" (Id.) As discussed supra, 
plaintiffs' claims are based upon UPMC and Highmark conspiring to, among other things, increase their profits by raising the 
rates Highmark charged to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs allege they suffered the exact injury UPMC and Highmark conspired to achieve. 
Plaintiffs under those circumstances do not lack standing to sue UPMC and Highmark for the difference between the rates 
Highmark charged to plaintiffs and the rates they would have charged plaintiffs in the absence of the conspiracy. Plaintiffs' 
claims as plead, however, are barred under the filed rate doctrine."
804,32," To the extent the claims asserted against Highmark in counts IV and VI are also based upon the UPMC-Highmark conspiracy 
to restrict competition and raise prices and not unilateral action taken by Highmark, those claims are redundant to count II. "
806,33," The court is not aware whether the other investigations, i.e., investigations performed by the Department of Justice or the PID, 
were public knowledge prior to December 2, 2008. "
819,1," Similarly, the court cannot at this early stage determine what weight to afford evidence of the DOJ's consent decrees with other 
employers, which provide a list of exceptions to the prohibition of entering into no-solicitation/no-hire agreements, in determining 
which rule should apply. See BMI, 441 U.S. at 13 (finding that HN17[
] while a consent decree may be ""a unique indicator that 
the challenged practice may have redeeming competitive virtues,"" it ""does not immunize the defendant from liability for actions, 
including those contemplated by the decree, that violate the rights of non-parties."") "
826,1," The Nebraska Attorney General stated that he was investigating possible violations of the Nebraska Unfair Competition Act and 
the Nebraska Deceptive Trade Practices Act."
826,2," Defendants also filed an objection to plaintiff's exhibits and declarations. Filing No. 35. The court has reviewed the same and 
determines that it should be denied. The court has ignored the hearsay, and only identified that information as is relevant and 
made its conclusions based on the uncontested evidence and argument presented to the court."
826,3, It is clear that Activision invented the technology that is covered by these patents.
826,4, The patents in this case involve digital signage. 
827,5," The court agrees that Farney Daniels is not a party to this lawsuit. Accordingly, the court  [**5] will review the case as it 
pertains to Activision. "
830,6," The court likewise notes that the United States Constitution states: ""To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by 
securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries."" United States 
Constitution, Art. 1, § 8, cl. 8."
830,7," See Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 415 n.12, 122 S. Ct. 2179, 153 L. Ed. 2d 413 (2002) (noting that a number of 
decisions have concluded that the right of access to the courts in the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause, the First 
Amendment Petition Clause, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, and the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection and 
Due Process Clauses); see also Harrison v. Springdale Water & Sewer Comm'n, 780 F.2d 1422, 1427-28 and n.7 (8th Cir. 1986) 
(finding the constitutional  [**18] right litigants have to petition courts for redress of grievances impliedly includes a right to 
counsel); HN11[
] ""The right to counsel in civil matters 'includes the right to choose the lawyer who will provide that 
representation.'"" Texas Catastrophe Property Ins. Ass'n v. Morales, 975 F.2d 1178, 1181 (5th Cir. 1992)."
830,8," United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965) (right to petition the government); 
Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) (same). "
831,9," The court might view this matter very differently if (1) there was an imminent threat of significant harm to the citizens or the 
State of Nebraska; or (2) if the investigation uncovered what clearly appeared to be violations of state law, that reach the 
standard of ""bad faith"" as discussed hereinafter. That is not the case at this point in the investigation. "
832,10," Century Link is also located in Omaha, Nebraska. "
841,1," Fields's complaint alternates between the terms ""H-pilings"" and ""H-piles""."
841,2," As used in the complaint, the term ""covered period"" refers  [**3] to ""the time period covered by the latest supply agreement 
between Fields and [NYS], which ran from May 4, 2005 until May 4, 2012."" (Dkt. No. 1, ¶ 9)."
841,3," As used in the complaint, the term ""relevant market"" refers to ""the product market of structural steel products, including H-
pilings, in the geographic market of North America, including the United States and the geographic submarkets of the states and 
territories in which Fields and [NYS] did business during the covered period."" (Id. ¶ 10). "
843,4," The parties' briefing indicates that it was NYS's general partner, Nucor Corporation, that acquired Skyline (Dkt. No. 38, at 14 
n.5; Dkt. No. 58, at 9). "
844,5," Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 49 Stat. 1526, amended § 2(a) of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 70. Accordingly, the courts 
often refer to 15 U.S.C. § 13(a) by its designation as § 2(a) under the Clayton Act. See, e.g., Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc. v. "
845,," Reeder-Simco GMC, Inc., 546 U.S. 164, 175, 126 S. Ct. 860, 163 L. Ed. 2d 663 (2006) (""Section 2, 'when originally enacted as 
part of the Clayton Act . . . .""). "
848,6," NYS attached the supply agreement to its motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 38-1). The Court need not exclude the supply agreement 
to avoid converting the motion to one for summary judgment, as it may  [**30] treat the agreement as incorporated into the 
complaint by reference. See Moses.com Securities, Inc. v. Comprehensive Software Sys., Inc., 406 F.3d 1052, 1063 n.3 (8th 
Cir. 2002) (citing Venture Assoc's Corp. v. Zenith Data Sys., 987 F.2d 429, 431 (7th Cir. 1993) (HN15[
] ""Documents that a 
defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff's complaint 
and are central to [its] claim"")). "
849,7," For purposes of this motion, this distinction is only determinative as to the elements of the claim for negligent 
misrepresentation, as Fields agrees with NYS ""that the substantive law of Texas and Arkansas [are] essentially the same for 
each of the tort counts, except the negligent misrepresentation count."" (Dkt. No. 58, at 19-20 n.3). The parties argue whether, if 
Texas law applies, a shorter limitations period applies to bar certain of these tort claims. Because the Court determines 
Arkansas law applies, the Court does not reach the limitations issue."
849,8," Fields pleads conspiracy as its third cause of action (Dkt. No. 1, ¶¶ 33-36). However, the Court considers the claims in the 
order briefed by the parties. "
853,9," Paragraph 17 of the contract states that ""[t]his Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to 
the subject matter hereof, supersedes all prior representations, documents or statements transmitted between the parties, and 
may be amended only by written instruments signed by both parties."" (Dkt. No. 38-1, at 6-7, ¶ 17). The attached terms and 
conditions of sale provides, in part, ""Except as otherwise agreed in a writing signed by Buyer and Nucor, the applicable Nucor 
sales order acknowledgement, together with these terms and conditions constitute the entire agreement between Nucor and 
Buyer relating to the sales of such goods by Nucor."" (Id. at 9, ¶ 1) (The terms and conditions of sale uses ""Nucor"" to refer 
collectively to Nucor-Yamato Steel Company ""together  [**49] with its affiliates"" (Dkt. No. 38-1, at 9)). "
857,1," The factual recitation generally summarizes Ms. Khan's operative complaint (""complaint""). "
861,2," F.R.Civ.P. 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to state law causes of action:  [**17] ""[W]hile a federal court will examine 
state law to determine whether the elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of action, the Rule 9(b) 
requirement that the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity is a federally imposed rule."" Vess v. Ciba-Geigy 
Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1995)(italics in original)) "
862,3," ""In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the 
basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be 'grounded in fraud' or to 'sound in fraud,' and the pleading of that claim as a 
whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)."" Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103-1104. "
872,1," Persons desiring to practice the profession of public performance promoters are required to obtain a license and be registered 
in the Registry of Public Performance Promoters pursuant to the Public Performance Promoter Act, Law 182 of September 3, 
1996, 15 L.P.R.A. §§ 2001-2007. The licenses are issued by the Public Performance Promoters Services Office, an office 
created within the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury — the government agency responsible for regulating the profession. 15 
L.P.R.A. § 2006. Further, public performance producers holding a license pursuant to Law 182 are required to become members 
of the COPEP pursuant to the COPEP Act. 15 L.P.R.A. § 2012. "
873,2," Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 
1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "
876,3," Vagueness and overbreadth analysis are not entirely separable but they derive from different policies and look to different 
effects. A vagueness inquiry focuses on whether a law states its proscriptions in terms sufficiently indefinite that persons of 
reasonable intelligence ""must necessarily guess at its meaning"". Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 607, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 
L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973) (quoting Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926)). But an overbreadth analysis looks to 
whether a law ""sweeps within its ambit (protected) activities"" as well as unprotected ones, Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 97, 
60 S. Ct. 736, 84 L. Ed. 1093 (1940). Therefore, because Plaintiff attacks the statute for lack of a definition of the proscribed 
activity, the Court will address Plaintiff's claims under a vagueness analysis as it is more appropriate. See Fantasy Book Shop, 
Inc. v. City of Boston, 652 F.2d 1115, note 9 (1st Cir. 1981). "
877,4," Plaintiff's constitutional challenge is also based on alleged differential treatment of public performance producers based on their 
country of residence, which the Court addressed in Section II.A.1. ""First Cause: Violation of the Dormant Foreign Commerce 
Clause,"" ante. "
885,1," Unless otherwise noted, all facts are taken from Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (Dkt. 1-71.) The Court must accept as 
true all of the factual allegations contained in a complaint when deciding a motion to dismiss. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 
678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "
887,2," At the time Defendants  [*11] removed the case to this Court, a Motion to Quash Subpoena or for Protective Order (""Motion to 
Quash"") by nonparty Skyline Surgery Center, LLC (""Skyline"") was pending before Judge Dunn. Skyline entered the pending 
Motion to Quash in this Court on February 8, 2013. (Dkt. 7.) Skyline is an ambulatory surgery center expanding to Bannock 
County in 2013. In its Motion to Quash, Skyline seeks protection from a subpoena duces tecum it received from the original 
Defendants during the course of discovery in the state court action. This Court entered an order on April 3, 2013 (Dkt. 19) 
extending the original Defendants' response deadline to Skyline's Motion to Quash until twenty-one days after Defendants' 
motions to dismiss are decided. If the Court grants Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, Skyline would not be subject to the 
subpoena duces tecum and its Motion to Quash would be moot. However, because the Court is denying Defendants' Motions to 
Dismiss in part, the original Defendants now have twenty-one days from the date of this order to respond to Skyline's motion."
887,3," With the exception of Plaintiffs' failure to allege any facts to establish liability of the various newly added defendants, the 
Second and Third Motion to Dismiss raise the same arguments as Defendants' First Motion to Dismiss."
887,4," Unless otherwise specified, the original and newly added Defendants will be collectively referred to hereinafter as the 
""Defendants."" "
888,5," Other than the original Defendants, the SAC does not specify which of the newly added Defendants interfered with RMMM's 
 [*17] contract with Anesthesia Associates, or with either RMMM's or Elquist's prospective economic advantage. "
889,6," Once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case for tortious interference with contract, the burden is on the defendant to 
prove justification or privilege. Id. at 284."
889,7," Defendants obtained a copy of the Medical Management Services Contract from attorney Curt Thomsen, who represented 
Anesthesia Associates in connection with subpoenas issued by Plaintiffs to Anesthesia Associates' physicians and other 
personnel while this action was pending in state court. (Dkt. 4-2.) Although, when ruling on a motion to dismiss, the court must 
generally convert a Rule 12(b)(6) motion into one for summary judgment under Rule 56 if the court considers evidence outside 
of the pleadings, a court may consider certain materials, such as documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated 
by reference in the complaint, or matters of judicial notice, without converting the motion to dismiss into one for summary 
judgment. United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 907-908 (9th Cir. 2003). As the Management Services Contract is referenced 
throughout the SAC, and forms the basis of Plaintiffs' interference with contract claim, the Court will consider the agreement 
without converting Defendants' motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment. Id. at 908. "
891,8," A dismissal without leave to amend is improper unless it is clear that the complaint ""could not be saved by any amendment."" 
Harris v. Amgen, Inc., 573 F.3d 728, 737 (9th Cir. 2009). It does not appear that Plaintiffs could amend their complaint to 
adequately allege tortious interference with contract given the at-will provision of the Management Services Contract and 
Plaintiffs' failure to identify any breach of either an express or implied term of that agreement despite having filed three versions 
of their complaint. Plaintiffs' interference with contract claim is accordingly  [*26] dismissed with prejudice. "
892,9," Although  [*31] Count Three is based on the termination of RMMM's business relationship with Anesthesia Associates, Elquist 
appears to assert the claim along with RMMM. (Dkt. 1-71, ¶¶50-51.) In the First Motion to Dismiss, Defendants argued Elquist 
failed to identify a business relationship between Elquist and Anesthesia Associates (as opposed to between RMMM and 
Anesthesia Associates) and that Count Three must accordingly be dismissed as to Elquist. (Dkt. 4-1, p. 21.) Plaintiffs clarified in 
their Joint-Response, ""Mr. Elquist pleads in Count Two that the Defendants interfered with his prospective economic advantage 
in developing a new surgery center; RMMM pleads in Count Three that the Defendants interfered with its prospective economic 
advantage in continuing the management services contract with [Anesthesia Associates]."" (Dkt. 28, p. 17.) The Court will 
accordingly analyze Count Three as RMMM's claim for interference with its prospective economic advantage in continuing the 
Management Services Contract. "
893,10," ""Wrongful means"" can include conduct in violation of ""(1) a statute or other regulation; (2) 'a recognized rule of common law, 
such as violence, threats of intimidation, deceit[,] misrepresentation, bribery, or disparaging falsehood', ... or (3) 'an established 
standard of trade or profession."" Quality Resource, 706 F.Supp.2d at 1099 (internal citations omitted). As the Court has already 
determined Plaintiffs' sufficiently alleged Defendants' interference was for an improper purpose, it need not reach whether 
Defendants also used wrongful means in interfering. Bliss, 121 Idaho at 286 (to state a claim for interference with prospective 
economic expectancy, a plaintiff must allege either that defendant had an improper purpose to harm the plaintiff or that the 
defendant used wrongful means to cause injury to the prospective economic relationship). "
894,11," In several regards, the Court respectfully departs from the state court's analysis of Plaintiffs' antitrust claims. However, 
interlocutory orders, such as the state court's ruling primarily denying the original Defendants' motion to dismiss, are 
interlocutory and ""subject  [*37] to reconsideration by the court at any time."" Dessar v. Bank of America Nat'l Trust and Savings 
Association, 353 F.2d 468, 470 (9th Cir. 1965). It follows that upon removal, this Court may in its discretion depart from the state 
court's ruling on Defendants' motion to dismiss. Preaseau v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 591 F.2d 74, 79-80 (9th Cir. 1979)."
894,12," Federal courts analyze restraint of trade claims under either the rule of reason standard or per se standard. Leegin Creative 
Leather Products, Inc., v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 885, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007). The rule of reason standard 
is the favored approach and was the standard applied by the state court. (Dkt. 1-31, p. 17.) As the per se rule is ""confined to 
restraints . . . that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output,"" a per se prohibition  [*39] is 
not justified unless a restraint has ""manifestly anticompetitive"" effects, and ""lack[s] . . . any redeeming virtue."" Leegin, 551 U.S. 
at 886 (internal citations and quotations omitted). The Court agrees with the state court that a rule of reason standard is the 
appropriate standard in this case. "
895,13," As Plaintiffs note, there is a narrow exception to the market participant requirement for parties who injuries are ""inextricably 
intertwined with the injury the conspirators sought to inflict."" (Dkt. 28, p. 11) (citing Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 
465, 484-85, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982)). However, the plaintiff in McCready, unlike RMMM, was a consumer in 
the affected market. The injury she suffered, suppressed competition in the psychotherapy market and the corresponding cost of 
such suppression, was a direct result of the act alleged to be in violation of the antitrust laws. By contrast, RMMM's alleged loss, 
its contract with  [*42] Anesthesia Associates to provide medical management services, has no effect on competition."
895,14," The state court dismissed Plaintiffs' restraint of trade claim in its entirety because neither Plaintiff adequately alleged 
Defendants' conduct caused an injury to competition. As such, the court determined Plaintiffs lacked antitrust standing to bring a 
§1 claim. (Dkt. 1-31, pp. 17-20.) However, in so holding, the court did not address Defendants' argument that RMMM lacked 
standing to bring either a restraint of trade or a monopoly claim because it is not a participant in the relevant market. "
900,1, The IPP Complaint and the Indiana Complaint contain nearly identical factual allegations. 
902,2," Specifically, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs assert claims under Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, 
Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin state law."
902,3," Specifically, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs assert claims under Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nebraska, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and South Carolina state law. "
903,4," Specifically, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs assert claims under Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, 
Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin state law."
903,5," Specifically, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs assert claims under Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nebraska, 
New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and South Carolina."
903,6," Specifically, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs  [*15] assert claims under Arizona, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, 
Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, 
North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin state law. "
904,7," Neither Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs nor Indiana asserts claims for injunctive relief against Star Pipe Products. (See IPP Action, 
Docket Entry No. 110 at ¶¶ 142-54; Indiana Action, Docket Entry No. 22 at ¶¶ 133-45). In both the IPP Complaint and the 
Indiana Complaint, however, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs and Indiana state in the prayer for relief that they seek an injunction 
against all Defendants. As a statement included in a prayer for relief is  [*20] insufficient to assert a claim, see, e.g., Soder v. 
Chenot, No. 06-1522, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93657, 2007 WL 4556670, at *6 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 20, 2007), and Indirect Purchaser 
Plaintiffs and Indiana did not address this issue in their briefs after it was raised by Star Pipe Products, the Court concludes that 
Indirect Plaintiff Purchasers and Indiana have not asserted a claim for injunctive relief against Star Pipe Products. "
905,8," Specifically, Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs and Indiana seek an injunction enjoining McWane and Sigma from: (1) ""[e]ntering into 
a distribution agreement that eliminated Sigma as an entrant into the Domestic DIPF market;"" (2) [e]xcluding actual and potential 
competitors through the adoption and enforcement of exclusive distribution policies;"" (3) ""[a]greeing to charge prices at certain 
levels and otherwise to fix, increase, maintain or stabilize prices of DIPF sold in the United States;"" (4) ""[p]articipating in 
conversations and communications regarding prices to be charged for DIPF;"" and (5) ""[k]eeping the existence of the conspiracy 
unknown in order to foster the illegal anticompetitive conduct . . . ."" (IPP Action, Docket Entry No. 110 at ¶¶ 144, 152; Indiana 
Action, Docket Entry No. 22 at ¶¶ 135, 143). "
906,9," Furthermore, the other case cited by Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs, In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 2d 517, 544 (D.N.J. 
Sept. 29, 2004), is not on point as the plaintiffs in that case apparently specified that they were proceeding under the laws of 
each of the fifty states. "
911,10," Defendants concede that AGC does not apply to claims brought under Minnesota and North Carolina law. (See IPP Action, 
Docket Entry No. 177, Attach. 1, App'x II). "
912,11," Only Star Pipe Products makes specific arguments regarding the applicability of the AGC test to Indiana antitrust law, 
contending that Indiana courts would likely apply the AGC test because Indiana antitrust law was patterned after the Sherman 
Act. (Indiana Action, Docket Entry No. 28, Attach. 1 at 5). "
914,12," Star Pipe Products also advances this argument in favor of dismissing Count Eight; however, as the Court has already 
determined that dismissal of Count Eight  [*59] is appropriate on other grounds, the Court considers Star Pipe Products' 
arguments as they apply to Counts Three and Four only. "
924,1," For convenience, and following the parties' usage, the Court hereinafter refers to all non-credit forms of payment as ""cash."" "
926,2," See also Cal. Civ. Code § 1748.1(a); Colo. Rev. Stat. § 5-2-212(1); Conn. Gen. Stat. § 42-133ff(a); Fla. Stat. § 501.0117; 
 [**12] Kan Stat. Ann. § 16a-2-403; Me. Rev. Stat. 9-A § 8-303(2) (repealed Sept. 27, 2011); Mass Gen. Laws ch. 140D, § 
28A(a); Okla. Stat. tit. 14A, § 2-211(A); Tex. Fin. Code § 339.001. "
927,3," In their initial complaint, plaintiffs named only the Attorney General as a defendant, but later amended their complaint to name 
the three District Attorneys as well. See generally Compl.; FAC. Before plaintiffs filed their amended complaint, however, the 
Attorney General moved to dismiss the initial complaint. On consent of the parties, the Court later deemed the motion to dismiss 
to be directed against the First Amended Complaint. See Order of July 31, 2013. Also on consent of the parties, the Court 
deemed plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction to be directed not only against the Attorney General, but also against the 
District Attorneys. See Order of August 14, 2013. The District Attorneys joined in the Attorney General's motion to dismiss, as 
well as his opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction. "
928,4," To be precise, defendants contend that it is unclear whether Patio.com intends to display the credit card surcharge prominently 
or only as a line item on the customer's receipt. See Defs.' Mem. at 34-35. Fairly read, however, the Ross Declaration indicates 
that Patio.com wants to include a line item on its receipt in addition to other means of prominently  [**23] advertising the 
surcharge. The Ross Declaration states that Patio.com wants ""to charge a different price for credit card usage"" and ""call that 
price a 'surcharge'"" in order to ""provide a meaningful incentive to many customers to switch to paying with a debit card, cash or 
check."" Ross Decl. ¶ 8. "
929,5," In an earlier decision in the same case, the court rejected Fulvio's argument that section 518 was impermissibly vague on its 
face. See People v. Fulvio (""Fulvio I""), 135 Misc. 2d 93, 514 N.Y.S.2d 594, 596-97 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 1987)."
929,6," See also Cash Discount  [**27] Act § 102 (defining ""regular price"" as (1) the ""tag or posted price"" for an item if a single price is 
tagged or posted, or (2) the credit-card price if (a) no price is tagged or posted, or (b) two different prices are tagged or posted, 
one for cash and one for credit). "
930,7," In a representative case, an investigator called a small home heating oil company ""pretending to be a customer ordering oil,"" 
and an employee ""quoted the price of oil and said that [the company] charge[s] a fee on top of that price for using a credit card."" 
Decl. of Michael Parisi ¶ 6. The Attorney General took the position that that constituted the imposition of an unlawful surcharge 
under section 518. The company ultimately entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance, which included an agreement to 
refund ""all previously imposed surcharges"" over a specified period. Id., ex. A, ¶ 9. The Attorney General took the same position 
in numerous other cases around the same time. See Decl. of John Conover ¶¶ 3-5; Decl. of Donna Zasowski ¶¶ 3-6; Second 
Decl. of Deepak Gupta (""Second Gupta Decl.""), exs. F, H (press releases announcing settlements with numerous other heating-
oil companies). "
931,8," Because the Court easily concludes that section 518 fails intermediate scrutiny, it need not resolve plaintiffs' argument that the 
statute sweeps up both commercial and noncommercial speech, subjecting the law to strict scrutiny. See Riley v. Nat'l Fed'n of 
the Blind of N. Carolina, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 796, 108 S. Ct. 2667, 101 L. Ed. 2d 669 (1988);  [**33] Brown v. Entm't Merchants 
Ass'n, 131 S. Ct. 2729, 2738, 180 L. Ed. 2d 708 (2011). The Court notes, however, that commercial speech generally includes 
speech that ""does no more than propose a commercial transaction,"" United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 409, 121 
S. Ct. 2334, 150 L. Ed. 2d 438 (2001), or is ""related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience."" Cent. 
Hudson, 447 U.S. at 561. In this case, while price information no doubt proposes a transaction and relates to economic interests, 
""what is going on here is more than just a debate about how best to sell toothpaste."" BellSouth, 542 F.3d at 505. Plaintiffs want 
to convey not only the terms of a transaction, but also why prices are what they are and who is responsible. Given current 
debates over swipe fees and financial regulation more generally, those questions have a powerful noncommercial valence. See 
id. at 504-05 (discussing a regulation prohibiting a seller from including a line item on an invoice separately detailing the cost of a 
particular tax); Bloom v. O'Brien, 841 F. Supp. 277, 280-81 (D. Minn. 1993) (similar). "

954,22," Defendants do not seek to strike plaintiff's ninth cause of action for violation of the CFAA. Because the CFAA is a federal 
statute, California's anti-SLAPP statute does not apply to it. Bulletin Displays, LLC v. Regency Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 448 
F.Supp.2d 1172, 1180 (C.D. Cal. 2006) (""Although the anti-SLAPP statute does apply to state law claims brought in federal 
court, . . . it does not apply to federal question claims in federal court because such application would frustrate substantive 
federal rights,"" citing Globetrotter Software, Inc. v. Elan Computer Group, Inc., 63 F.Supp.2d 1127,1130 (N.D. Cal. 1999), and In

properly directs its anti-SLAPP motion only to the pendant state law claims set out in the complaint""). "
955,23," Some California courts have held that ""mixed causes of action"" come within the ambit of § 425.16 only if the ""gravamen or 
principal thrust"" of the claim is protected activity. See, e.g., California Back Specialists Medical Group v. Rand, 160 Cal.App.4th 
1032, 1036-37, 73 Cal. Rptr. 3d 268(2008); Freeman v. Schack, 154 Cal.App.4th 719, 727, 64 Cal. Rptr. 3d 867 (2007); Wang v. 
Wal-Mart Real Estate Business Trust, 153 Cal.App.4th 790, 802, 63 Cal. Rptr. 3d 575 (2007). Others have indicated that 
applying the anti-SLAPP statute more broadly is the correct approach. See Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. v. Paladino, 89 
Cal.App.4th 294, 308, 106 Cal. Rptr. 2d 906 (2001) (""a plaintiff cannot frustrate the purposes of the SLAPP statute through a 
pleading tactic of combining allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one 'cause of action'""). Federal 
district courts in California applying the anti-SLAPP statute to ""mixed causes of action"" generally utilize the approach adopted 
here. See, e.g., GA Telesis, LLC v. GKN Aerospace, Chem-Tronics, Inc., No. 12—CV—1331—IEG, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
38358, 2013 WL 1147951, *8 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 19, 2013) (""Mixed causes of actions are subject to § 425.16 if at least one of the 
underlying acts is protected conduct""); Crowe v. Gogineni, No. 2:11—cv—3438 JAM DAD, 2012 U.S .Dist. LEXIS 176343, 2012 
WL 6203124, *5 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2012) (""Moreover, ""[w]here . . . a cause of action alleges the plaintiff was damaged by 
specific acts of the defendant that constitute protected activity under the statute, it defeats the letter and spirit of section 425.16 
to hold it inapplicable because the liability element of the plaintiff's claim may be proven without reference to the protected 
activity.' . . . 'A mixed cause of action is subject to section 425.16 if at least one of the underlying acts is protected conduct, 
unless the allegations of protected conduct are merely incidental to the unprotected activity,'"" quoting Salma, 161 Cal.App.4th at "
956,1287," ; Peregrine Funding, Inc., 133 Cal.App.4th at 674). Accordingly, the court concludes that Mireskandari's causes of action 
are subject to the anti-SLAPP statute if they are based on at least one act of protected conduct, unless that protected conduct is 
merely incidental to the unprotected activity."

Blair""); see also id., ¶ 139 (alleging that plaintiff's suit led to a thorough internal investigation of racial discrimination in the 
Metropolitan Police Department, the resignation of Department leaders, and an acknowledgment of the existence of race 
discrimination by the Department's new leader)."
959,34," Absent a concession or uncontested evidence establishing illegality as a matter of law, it is not defendant's burden to 
demonstrate that the alleged newsgathering conduct was legal. See Bulletin Displays, LLC, 448 F.Supp.2d at 1185 (""Where the 
parties to an anti-SLAPP motion dispute the legality of the defendant's [alleged] actions, and the plaintiff cannot establish as a 
matter of law that the actions were illegal, then the claimed illegitimacy of the defendant's acts is an issue which the plaintiff must 
raise and support in the context of the . . . discharge of the plaintiff's burden to provide a prima facie showing of the merits of the 
plaintiff's case,"" quoting Paul for Council, 85 Cal.App.4th at 1367). As other courts have explained, requiring defendant to 
establish that its activity was legally valid would ""run[ ] contrary to legislative design"" by ""confus[ing] the threshold question of 
whether the SLAPP statute . . . applies with the question whether the . . . plaintiff established a probability of success on the 
merits."" See Navellier v. Sletten, 29 Cal.4th 82, 94-95, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 530, 52 P.3d 703 (2002) (quoting Fox Searchlight 
Pictures, 89 Cal.App.4th at 305); M.F. Farming Co. v. Couch Distributing Co., 207 Cal.App.4th 180, 196, 143 Cal. Rptr. 3d 160 
(2012)."
959,35," Although Lieberman predated Flatley, and Flatley did not address Lieberman, the court believes the two cases can be 
reconciled because in Flatley, defendant admitted facts demonstrating that it had engaged in criminal extortion, while in 
Lieberman, the defendant apparently did not concede the alleged illegal activity. Compare Flatley, 39 Cal.4th at 329 (relying on "
960,," uncontroverted evidence — a letter defendant did not deny he sent, and uncontested declarations — in finding extortion as a 
matter of law) with Lieberman, 110 Cal.App.4th at 165 (rejecting plaintiff's argument that secret recording was illegal conduct not 
covered by § 425.16, and reasoning that it was plaintiff's burden to establish that the conduct was unlawful). See also Cross v. 
Cooper, 197 Cal.App.4th 357, 384, 127 Cal. Rptr. 3d 903 (2011) (describing the ""narrow circumstances"" at issue in Flatley, 
where ""[u]ncontradicted and uncontested evidence . . . conclusively established criminal extortion as a matter of law"")."
960,36," Plaintiff asserts that the statutes of limitations governing his claims were equitably tolled during the pendency of his U.K. action 
against ANL. The court disagrees. As plaintiff concedes in arguing that res judicata does not bar this action, his U.K. suit did not 
assert all of the claims he pleads here; it alleged only a defamation claim. This alone precludes the application of equitable 
tolling to a majority of plaintiff's claims, which are based on a different primary right — violation of plaintiff's privacy rights. See 
Arnold v. United States, 816 F.2d 1306, 1312 (9th Cir. 1987) (""[E]quitable tolling does not apply when a plaintiff has pursued a 
remedy as to only one of several distinct wrongs""). Equitable tolling is only appropriate, moreover, if defendants would not be 
unduly prejudiced. In re Marriage of Zimmerman, 183 Cal.App.4th 900, 911, 109 Cal. Rptr. 3d 96 (2010). Defendants assert they 
will be prejudiced if they are forced to defend a claim the U.K. courts have already dismissed; because plaintiff fails to rebut this, 
the court will not equitably toll the statute of limitations on plaintiff's fifth cause of action for false light, the sole defamation-type 
claim he asserts. Both because plaintiff's U.K. action did not assert many of the claims he pursues here, and because 
defendants would be prejudiced by having to defend a defamation/false light claim twice, the court declines to exercise its 
equitable power to toll the statutes of limitations governing plaintiff's claims. "
961,37," Plaintiff's fourteenth cause of action seeks a declaration under the federal Declaratory Judgment Act. Because it is a federal 
claim, and because it is based, in part, on plaintiff's rights under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030, 
the claim cannot be stricken under the anti-SLAPP statute. See Summit Media LLC v. City of Los Angeles, 530 F.Supp.2d 1084, 
1095 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (""Anti-SLAPP [m]otions challenge particular causes of action, rather than individual allegations or theories 
supporting a cause of action. . . . Where a complaint contains both SLAPP and non-SLAPP causes of action, the SLAPP claims 
alone may be stricken. CBSO's single counter claim is brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2201 . . .,which is a federal cause of action 
seeking declaratory relief. The cause of action for which Plaintiff seek anti-SLAPP relief involves exclusively federal law claims. 
Therefore, the California statute is not an applicable relief""); see also Bulletin Displays, LLC, 448 F.Supp.2d at 1180."
961,38," Defendants also rely on Alberghetti v. Corbis Corp., 713 F.Supp.2d 971, 983 (C.D. Cal. 2010). There, however, the court 
applied a two-year statute of limitations to torts based on violation of publicity rights. Id. at 981. See also Long v. Walt Disney 
Co., 116 Cal.App.4th 868, 874, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 836 (2004) (applying a two-year statute of limitations to a claim for violation of 
the right of publicity). Neither Alberghetti nor Long supports defendants' argument that a one-year limitations period applies to all 
of plaintiff's content-based claims."
961,39," The McGuiness court also dismissed a negligence claim as barred by Code of Civil Procedure § 340(3). In 1982, the year 
McGuiness was decided, Code of Civil Procedure § 340(3) set forth the statute of limitations governing actions for injury to or the 
death of one caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another. It thus covered libel as well as negligence claims alleging 
personal injury. See Neel v. Magana, Olney, Levy, Cathcart & Gelfand, 6 Cal.3d 176, 181, 98 Cal. Rptr. 837, 491 P.2d 421 
(1971) (""Actions in tort for negligence are classified as to the nature of the damage. An action for 'injury' or 'death' comes under 
the one-year limitation of section 340, subdivision 3. . .""). This statutory scheme was changed in 2002, when the California 
legislature deleted ""for injury to or for the death of one caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another"" from § 340(3) and 
enacted Code of Civil Procedure § 335.1, which provides a two year statute of limitations for actions alleging injury to, or the 
death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another."
961,40," In their reply, defendants argue that plaintiff's UCL claim is governed by the one or two-year statutes of limitations applicable 
to his other claims, citing Silvas v. E*Trade Mortg. Corp., 514 F.3d 1001, 1007 n. 3 (9th Cir. 2008). Silvas, however, held that the 
statute of limitations governing UCL claims could not extend the limitations period that applied to claims under the federal Truth 
in Lending Act (""TILA""), because TILA's shorter statute of limitations was federal law that expressly preempted the UCL statute 
of limitations. Defendants have not identified a federal statute relevant to this case that preempts the four-year statute of 
limitations that generally governs UCL claims. "
962,41," FAC, Exh. 47. Some of the alleged bases for plaintiff's first, fourth, sixth, tenth, and thirteenth causes of action appear to be 
time-barred. For example, plaintiff's IIED claim is based on the publication of ""offensive caricatures and cartoons likening [him] to 
. . . terrorists."" The only example of an ""offensive caricature"" or ""cartoon"" included in the complaint and exhibits is a Daily Mail 
cartoon published in 2008. Because defendants published the cartoon more than two years before plaintiff filed his complaint, 
the statute of limitations bars plaintiff from asserting IIED claim based on that publication. Thomas, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37789 
2009 WL 1273190 at *19. Plaintiff's thirteenth cause of action is also based, however, on the ""smear campaign"" defendants 
purportedly carried out against him, which involved publications distinct from the offensive caricatures described in the claim. 
(See FAC, ¶ 265; id., ¶ 267.) The complaint does not clearly allege when articles that were part of this purported campaign were 
published. Insofar, however, as the April 1, 2011 article, which does not include any offensive caricatures or cartoons depicting 
plaintiff, was allegedly part of defendants' ""smear campaign,"" plaintiff's thirteenth cause of action is not completely time-barred."
962,42," The court will not strike plaintiff's claims under the anti-SLAPP statute because they are partially based on actions falling 
outside the limitations period so long as he can show a probability of prevailing on any part of the claim. Oasis West Realty, LLC 
v. Goldman, 51 Cal.4th 811, 820, 124 Cal. Rptr. 3d 256, 250 P.3d 1115 (2011) (""If the plaintiff 'can show a probability of 
prevailing on any part of its claim, the cause of action is not meritless' and will not be stricken: 'once a plaintiff shows a 
probability of prevailing on any part of its claim, the plaintiff has established that its cause of action has some merit and the entire 
cause of action stands,'"" quoting Mann v. Quality Old Time Serv., Inc., 120 Cal.App.4th 90, 106, 15 Cal. Rptr. 3d 215 (2004)); 
Wallace v. McCubbin, 196 Cal.App.4th 1169, 1211, 128 Cal. Rptr. 3d 205 (2011) (""Oasis clearly holds that, where a cause of 
action (count) is based on protected activity, the entire cause of action may proceed as long as the plaintiff shows a probability of 
prevailing on at least one of the asserted bases for liability""). "
963,43," Plaintiff cannot evade the statutes of limitations applicable to his claims by asserting that all of the publications constituted a 
single ""continuing tort"" — either because they included similar content, or because the articles remained available on 
defendants' websites following their initial publication. ""The single-publication rule limits tort claims premised on mass 
communications to a single cause of action that accrues upon the first publication of the communication[.]"" Roberts, 660 F.3d at 
1166-67. Under California's single-publication rule, once a defendant publishes a statement on a website, the defendant does 
not republish the statement by simply continuing to host the website. Yeager v. Bowlin, 693 F.3d 1076, 1082 (9th Cir. 2012) 
(citing Roberts, 660 F.3d at 1169). The continuing tort doctrine applies only when ""there is 'no single incident' that can 'fairly or 
realistically be identified as the cause of significant harm.'"" Flowers v. Carville, 310 F.3d 1118, 1126 (9th Cir. 2002). The Ninth 
Circuit has held that the publication of content constitutes an identifiable single incident causing harm. Id. (citing Lettis v. U.S. 
Postal Serv., 39 F.Supp.2d 181, 205 (E.D.N.Y.1998) (""[A] cause of action for defamation accrues immediately upon the 
occurrence of the tortious act and thus, is not appropriate for the continuing violation exception"")); see also Rodriguez v. County 
of Los Angeles, No. CV 07-2644 ABC, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103774, 2007 WL 7708555, *5-6 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 11, 2007) (an 
alleged invasion of privacy, false statement. and falsification of evidence each constituted ""self-contained acts"" that did not 
qualify for treatment as a continuing tort, even though plaintiff alleged that they were part of same conspiracy to violate her 
rights); Mittleman v. U.S. Dep't of Treasury, 919 F.Supp. 461, 466-67 (D.D.C. 1995) (declining to apply the continuing tort 
doctrine to save time-barred claims including false light, IIED, interference, and negligence). "

964,48," For the same reason, any interference with plaintiff's contracts with the unnamed ""numerous clients"" alleged in his seventh 
cause of action must have occurred outside the limitations period for tortious interference with contract."
964,49," Even if the court were to find that plaintiff's eighth cause of action were not time-barred, it would conclude that plaintiff had 
failed to show a probability that he will prevail on the merits of the claim. Plaintiff fails to allege facts indicating that he had a pre-
existing relationship with any future client. He simply alleges in a conclusory manner that defendants interfered with his 
""prospective economic relations"" with unnamed ""future customers."" Plaintiff's eighth cause of action thus fail as a matter of law. 
See, e.g., Roth, 25 Cal.App.4th at 546 (""In addition, an essential element of the tort of intentional interference with prospective 
business advantage is the existence of a business relationship with which the tortfeasor interfered. Although this need not be a 
contractual relationship, an existing relationship is required"")."
964,50," FAC, ¶ 111. "
965,51," Some of the allegations supporting plaintiff's false light claim describe actions that occurred outside the one-year limitations 
period. As noted, however, the court will not strike the cause of action so long as plaintiff can show a probability of prevailing on 
any part of the claim. Wallace, 196 Cal.App.4th at 1211."
965,52," Although the parties describe plaintiff's seventh and eighth causes of action as ""newgathering"" claims (see, e.g., Motion at 7), 
as alleged, the tortious interference claims are based solely on the publication of content. Consequently, the court's conclusion 
above that plaintiff's tortious interference claims are time-barred ""content claims"" disposes of them."
965,53," See supra, note 37. Although defendants' initial list of the purportedly time-barred ""newsgathering claims"" included the 
fourteenth cause of action, they do not mention it again or provide any argument concerning the applicable statute of limitations 
for the claim. Plaintiff similarly does not discuss the statute of limitations governing the claim. The court thus assumes that 
defendants' statement that plaintiff's fourteenth cause of action is a time-barred ""newsgathering claim"" was in error."

a finding of delayed discovery[.]"" Yumul, 733 F.Supp.2d at 1133. The court similarly grants plaintiff leave to amend if he can 
allege specific facts supporting his delayed discovery theory. California courts disfavor dismissal without prejudice in the anti-
SLAPP context. See Simmons v. Allstate Ins. Co., 92 Cal.App.4th 1068, 1073, 112 Cal. Rptr. 2d 397 (2001) (""Allowing a SLAPP 
plaintiff leave to amend the complaint . . . would completely undermine the statute by providing the pleader a ready escape from 
section 425.16's quick dismissal remedy""). In this case, however, granting defendants' anti-SLAPP motion to strike plaintiff's 
intrusion claim ""without granting [him] leave to amend would directly collide with Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)'s policy favoring liberal "
967,," amendment."" Verizon Delaware, Inc. v. Covad Communications, 377 F.3d 1081, 1091 (9th Cir. 2004). Although Covad 
concerned an original complaint, rather than an amended complaint, which is what the court considers here, the distinction is not 
material, since this is the first complaint the court has been asked to dismiss. The court therefore dismisses plaintiff's intrusion 
claim without prejudice. See id. (upholding the district court's decision to permit amendment before ruling conclusively on an 
anti-SLAPP motion); see also Art of Living Found. v. Does, No. 10-5022, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63507, 2011 WL 2441898, *9

however. To the extent plaintiff relies on those publications, therefore, his false light claim is time-barred. Because the February 
2012 article is the only article referenced in the complaint that was published within the limitations period, the court limits its 
consideration of the merits of plaintiff's false light claim to assessing whether the publication of that article will support the claim. "

. was a convicted conman with bogus legal qualifications."" (Id., Exh. 48.) Plaintiff also alleges that defendants placed him in a 
false light by reporting that he had been convicted of a crime. (FAC, ¶ 183.) As noted, the February 2012 article described 
plaintiff as a ""convicted conman."" (Id., Exh. 48.) Plaintiff asserts he was never convicted of fraud, or found guilty of any crime, 
while he was living in Los Angeles. (Id., ¶ 184.) Rather, he contends, he pleaded ""no contest"" in February 1991 to a ""strict 
liability issue, where there was no issue of moral turpitude, which was expunged entirely from his record in or about 1994."" (Id., ¶ 
101.) Citing Jennings v. Telegram-Tribune Co., 164 Cal.App.3d 119, 210 Cal. Rptr. 485 (1985), defendants argue that their 
statement concerning plaintiff's criminal conviction cannot be the basis for a false light claim because it was ""substantially true"" 
and/or protected by the ""fair report"" privilege. In Jennings, the appellate court held that the ""gist or sting"" of newspaper articles 
stating that plaintiff had been convicted of tax fraud were""fair and true"" reports of the plaintiff's plea of no-contest to the offense 
of willful failure to file tax returns. 164 Cal.App.3d at 128. Here, similarly, the February 2012 article's description of plaintiff as a 
""convicted conman"" captures the ""substance [and/or] the gist"" of plaintiff's no-contest plea in 1991 to fifteen criminal charges, 
including charges for making false and misleading statements. While the term ""convicted conman"" is harsh, the court cannot say 
that the average reader would interpret ""conman"" as meaning something so different than making criminally false and 
misleading statements that the article no longer constitutes ""fair and true"" reporting. Cf. id. ('Tax fraud' and 'tax evasion' are 
harsh terms; but we cannot say the average reader would have viewed the offenses [for failure to file tax returns] differently""); "
974,," see also Kilgore, 30 Cal.3d at 777 (""[T]he average reader of either paper would reasonably interpret the articles to imply only 
that Kilgore was connected in some fashion with organized crime. As we see it, this is exactly the import of Attorney General 
Younger's [press] release. In other words, we simply do not believe that the average reader would take the articles to intimate 
that Kilgore was involved in every — or even necessarily more than one — type of organized criminal activity. We hold, 
therefore, that the papers captured the substance of Attorney [General] Younger's release, and thus that the requirement of 
section 47, subdivision 5, to wit: that the reports be fair and true, was satisfied as a matter of law""); Handelsman v. San 
Francisco Chronicle, 11 Cal.App.3d 381, 385-86, 90 Cal. Rptr. 188 (1970) (holding that a newspaper article using the term 
""theft"" was a fair and true report of the substance of a complaint for civil conversion, and noting that ""a slight inaccuracy in the 
details will not prevent a judgment for the defendant, if the inaccuracy does not change the complexion of the affair so as to 
affect the reader of the article differently than the actual truth would""). Similarly, the article's use of the word ""convicted"" is a 
substantially fair and true report of plaintiff's no-contest plea. See Jennings, 164 Cal.App.3d at 128. The court concludes, 
therefore, that even accepting plaintiff's factual allegations concerning his ""no contest"" pleas as true, defendants' statement in 
the February 2012 article about plaintiff's criminal background is ""substantially true."" The report is therefore protected speech, 
and plaintiff has failed to show that it is probable he will prevail on his false light claim to the extent it is based on defendants' 
""convicted conman"" statement. See Epicor Software Corp. v. Alt. Tech. Solutions, Inc., No. SACV 13-00448-CJC, 2013 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 109278, 2013 WL 3930545, *6 (C.D. Cal. June 2, 2013); see also Hayward, 265 Cal.App.2d at 262."
974,94," Motion at 14. As support for this argument, defendants cite Greenbelt Publ. Ass'n v. Bresler, 398 U.S. 6, 14, 90 S. Ct. 1537, 26 
L. Ed. 2d 6 (1970), Franklin v. Dynamic Details, Inc., 116 Cal.App.4th 375, 387, 10 Cal. Rptr. 3d 429 (2004), and Partington v. 
Bugliosi, 56 F.3d 1147, 1156-57 (9th Cir. 1995). These cases are distinguishable because the publications at issue there 
disclosed the facts underlying the challenged statement of opinion. The reader could therefore determine the limited facts 
implied by the statement of opinion and treat the opinion as subjective commentary on those facts. Here, defendants simply 
stated that plaintiff's legal credentials were ""bogus,"" without disclosing the facts on which the statement was based. For this 
reason, the statement is not a ""pure"" statement of opinion. See Nicosia v. De Rooy, 72 F.Supp.2d 1093, 1104-05 (N.D. Cal. 
1999) (where defendant ""did not identify the documents or otherwise disclose the basis for her conclusion that [plaintiff] had 
committed perjury,"" her statements accusing plaintiff of perjury were actionable, not pure rhetoric or hyperbole). "

argue that ""plaintiff's complaint that [defendants] did not mention his degree in England or his later academic record is the kind of 
superior editing of the press that the [California] Supreme Court has rejected."" Shulman, however, did not address the 
publication of false or misleading content. The passage from Shulman defendants cite concerns the publication of allegedly 
private facts. The court's statement that courts ""do not, and constitutionally [can]not, sit as superior editors of the press"" was 
directed to plaintiffs' argument that the broadcast at issue ""could have been edited"" to serve the viewers' interest in the 
purportedly private facts while still preserving plaintiffs' privacy. See id. at 229. The Shulman court did not hold that courts 
inappropriately sit as ""superior editors of the press"" when they permit plaintiffs to assert causes of action based on misleading 
statements."
975,99," Defendants proffer evidence that the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found that plaintiff included false information in his 
application for admission to the roll of solicitors. (See, e.g., Hodgkinson Decl., Exh. U at 48-50). They argue, accordingly, that 
plaintiff's false light claim fails because their reports of his ""bogus"" legal qualifications were true. While the court can take judicial "
976,," notice of the existence of public records, including court records such as the transcript of the SDT proceedings proffered by 
defendants, it cannot take judicial notice of another court's factual findings to the extent they concern a matter disputed in the 
current litigation. See, e.g., Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001) (""A court may take judicial notice of 
matters of public record without converting a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. But a court may not take 
judicial notice of a fact that is subject to reasonable dispute. Thus, the district court had authority under Rule 201 to take judicial 
notice of the fact of the extradition hearing, the fact that a Waiver of Extradition was signed by Kerry Sanders, and the fact that 
Kerry Sanders purportedly waived his right to challenge his extradition to New York as Robert Sanders. . . . But the court did 
more than take judicial notice of undisputed matters of public record. The court took judicial notice of disputed facts stated in 
public records. . . . [T]he district court incorrectly took judicial notice of the validity of Kerry Sanders's waiver, which was as yet 
unproved""). Consequently, the court cannot take judicial notice of the fact that plaintiff submitted false information in his 
application for admission to the roll of solicitors. Rather, to determine whether plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of 
prevailing of the merits of his false light claim, the court looks to the face of the complaint, which alleges that plaintiff's legal 
qualifications were valid. (FAC, ¶ 60; id., ¶ 62; id., ¶ 178.)"
976,100," This conclusion here does not preclude defendants from demonstrating at a later point in these proceedings that plaintiff's

territorial restrictions, including those related to the media broadcasting of baseball exhibitions. See Toolson v. New York

choose another city over San José given the efforts that the A's have already expended to negotiate the Option Agreement with 
San José. "
1005,16," Although state law creates the City's causes of action, the court appears to have federal question jurisdiction over the UCL 
claims because entitlement to relief is necessarily predicated on the resolution of a substantial federal antitrust question. See

1006,17, The court exercises supplemental jurisdiction over these state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). 
1008,18," MLB also asserts in a footnote that the option agreement between San Jose and the A's is void, and therefore the City has not 
pled the existence of a valid contract, relying on the judicially noticed ""[RDA]: Asset Transfer Review"" report from the California 
State Controller finding certain asset transfers from the RDA to the City after January 1, 2011 to be invalid. See Dkt. No. 26-4. 
The court concludes that the ""[RDA]: Asset Transfer Review"" report is insufficient to definitively show that the Option Agreement 
is invalid. At the dismissal stage, the court draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff based on the allegations in the 
complaint and presumes that the contract is valid. "
1009,*," The plaintiffs conceded (Doc. 53) the invalidity of Claims One through Five of the '071 patent and withdrew any allegation of 
infringement of Claim Six in both the '526 patent and the '071 patent. Because each patent includes only six claims, the plaintiffs' "
1010,," remaining allegations of infringement involved only Claims One through Five of the '526 patent. In response to an order (Doc. 
75),  [*3] the parties filed a claim construction chart (Doc. 76) that reduced the claim disputes (1) to the terms ""lantern,"" ""fuel 
system,"" and ""beveled seat"" in Claim One and (2) to similar language in Claims Two through Five. The Markman order (Doc. 87) 
resolves each claim construction dispute. "

days later, on December 6, 2012, USS told Checkpoint it believed the sanctions motion was frivolous and it would file a cross-

1026,30," USS explained this specific ""indication"" further: (1) USS salesman Todd Reynolds went on a golf outing in 2010 with Tim 
Hopson (from Hy-Vee) and also Jeff Frazier and Kirk Armstrong (two salesmen from EAS manufacturer-competitor 
Sensormatic);  [*26] and (2) Frazier and Armstrong told Reynolds they made no headway selling to Hopson, who told them Hy-
Vee already had an exclusive contract with Checkpoint. "
1027,31," See response brief at 2 n.2 (docket no. 155) (referring to these documents, which are all exhibits to the response brief). "
1028,32," Checkpoint  [*32] makes a half-hearted reaffirmation of its argument that 11-of-34 retailers is not a ""substantial majority"" of 
customers, but cites no case law in opposition to USS's legal authority for the common-sense proposition that it is not the mere 
number of customers but their market share that is important. See, e.g., U.S. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 196 (3rd Cir. 
2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1089, 126 S. Ct. 1023, 163 L. Ed. 2d 853 (2006) (noting that exclusive dealing arrangements with 
""a few high volume businesses"" were anticompetitive, even though sales could also be made ""directly to end-user consumers or 
to a multitude of smaller retailers"") (emphasis added). Checkpoint also characterizes USS's response as a recitation of 
""evidence to support a new theory about how Checkpoint violated the antitrust laws"" which USS never ""actually asserted in its 
complaint"" — the ""new theory"" being exclusion from a substantial majority of the market, as opposed to a substantial majority of 
customers. Reply at 1 (docket no. 178). But this characterization ignores USS's existing allegations that don't refer to a 
substantial majority of customers, but instead to market share. See, e.g, second amended complaint at ¶3 (""Checkpoint 
 [*33] foreclosed a substantial share of the Relevant Markets, by entering into long term exclusive contracts that prohibited 
customers from dealing with competing suppliers of EAS systems."") (emphasis added); id. ¶52 (""Checkpoint has foreclosed a 
substantial majority of the market through its exclusive dealing and anticompetitive bundled discounts"") (emphasis added). Essentially, Checkpoint's motion for sanctions for continuing to prosecute baseless claims depends on an overly-literal reading 
of certain allegations in USS's complaint and ignoring other allegations. I conclude that Checkpoint's insistence that USS has 
long known it has no evidence to support its exclusive dealing claims is premised entirely on Checkpoint's own too-narrow 
definition of those claims."

1029,39," Checkpoint notes USS did not meet and confer with Rymsza before it filed suit and asserts this shows USS did not conduct an 
adequate pre-suit investigation, since Rymsza was USS's own salesperson responsible for calling on several customers in the "
1030,," Relevant Market. USS responds that: (1) a few weeks after USS filed its complaint, USS fired Rymsza because his attitude was 
a ""poison in the office,"" so USS had not been inclined to solicit his input during its pre-suit investigation; and (2) in any event, 
Rymsza had already shared his observations about Checkpoint's competitive activity with other USS employees, such as Todd 
Reynolds and Rod Holm, with whom USS did confer. That USS did not seek direct input from Rymsza before filing its complaint 
shows at worst that USS's investigation was less thorough than it could have been; it does not show USS's investigation

1033,51," The Special Master suggests, however, that Checkpoint should be more careful in its document characterizations. Checkpoint

Cnty of Tuolumne v. Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001); G.H.I.I. v. MTS, Inc., 147 Cal. App. 3d 256, 265, 
195 Cal. Rptr. 211 (Ct. App. 1983). "
1047,5," Judge Tigar found the plaintiffs' alleged product and geographic markets adequately pleaded, and those same markets are 
pleaded here. "
1048,6," The FAC only states that Quest ""has bargained for"" a right of first refusal—it never says that Aetna ever agreed to it. "
1049,7," The plaintiffs' argument appears to stem from the allegation in their FAC that ""loss of in-network status with respect to as little 
as 10% of a physician's patients can cause a laboratory to be  [*45] dropped from use by the physician, completely."" FAC ¶ 109. 
This assertion is quite different than the argument the plaintiffs make in their opposition briefs. "
1053,8," As the California Court of Appeal stated, ""Having in mind the incredibly complex nature of the package being offered by 
defendants . . . proof of their costs will undoubtedly become a lawyer's nightmare, though it may turn out to be a C.P.A.'s dream. 
All the same we find nothing in the Act's definition of 'costs' which compels a holding that plaintiffs can never prove what they 
allege."" Paramount Gen. Hosp. Co. v. Nat'l Med. Enters., Inc., 42 Cal. App. 3d 496, 504, 117 Cal. Rptr. 42 (Ct. App. 1974) 
(citations omitted). "
1056,9," Aetna and BSC argue that the plaintiffs are barred from bringing interference with prospective economic advantage claims 
because they are not strangers to the alleged relationships. Aetna Br. 14; BSC Br. 20. Because the Court finds that the plaintiffs 
have not adequately pleaded any relationship, there is no need to address Aetna and BSC's argument. "
1062,1," The parties refer to these agreements as ""Do Not Cold Call"" agreements, anti-solicitation agreements, anti-poaching 
agreements, and anti-competitive agreements. In this Order, the Court refers to these agreements as ""anti-solicitation 
agreements."""
1062,2," Under the provisions of Section 5(a) of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 16(a), the proposed final judgment has no prima facie 
effect in any subsequent private lawsuit brought against Defendants. "
1063,3," While the name of each Superior Court case listed only Adobe as the defendant, the complaints also named Apple, Google, 
Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm, Pixar, and Does 1-200, as defendants. "
1065,4," The Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART Defendants' Objections to Evidence in Pls.' Reply Supp. Suppl. Class 
Cert., ECF No. 469. The Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Strike Ms. Sandberg's declaration as improper. Id. (citing 
Contratto v. Ethicon, 227 F.R.D. 304, 308 n.5 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (striking witness declaration because it was an ""attempt to 
introduce  [**21] new evidence in connection with their reply papers."")). The Court DENIES Defendants' request to supplement 
the record as to the deposition testimony of Dr. Murphy. All of the excerpts to which Defendants cite were properly submitted to 
the Court by Plaintiffs. Defendants' request constitutes impermissible ""further argument on the motion."" Civ. L. R. 7-3(d)(1). The 
Court GRANTS Defendants' request to supplement the record as to the deposition testimony of Dr. Shaw as the excerpts to 
which Defendants cite were not submitted by Plaintiffs, and thus may be provided to complete the record. The Court DENIES 
Defendants' request to strike Dr. Leamer's analyses regarding salary ranges because it is proper rebuttal analysis. The Court 
GRANTS Defendants' request to strike Dr. Leamer's ""superadditive"" theory in his rebuttal report. "
1066,5," As discussed above, in the initial Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs also sought to certify an ""All Employee Class"" 
consisting of more than 100,000 employees. Class Cert. Mot. at 1. The Court denied certification of both the All Employee and 
Technical classes without prejudice. Plaintiffs have, in their Supplemental Motion, moved to certify only the Technical Class. 
Accordingly, this Order pertains only to that Class. "
1069,6," At the August 8 hearing on the Supplemental Motion for Class Certification,  [**36] the Court expressed concern regarding 
whether Hariharan, a former employee of Lucasfilm, could satisfy the typicality requirement given that Lucasfilm recently 
reached a settlement agreement with Plaintiffs. The Court is persuaded that Hariharan still satisfies the typicality requirement 
because he continues to have an active antitrust claim against the remaining members of the conspiracy. See Aug. 8 Tr. at 
21:15-23 ([T]he people who worked for the settled companies during the class period still have active claims against the other 
members of the conspiracy because . . . all of the members of the combination conspiracy . . . are liable for one another's 
conduct.""); see also In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 267 F.R.D. 594 (""[A] conspirator is jointly liable for everything 
done during the period of the conspiracy's existence.""). "
1070,7," In their initial opposition to Plaintiffs' class certification motion, Defendants pointed to a series of antitrust class actions alleging 
wage suppression by horizontal agreement in which district courts outside this circuit denied class certification on the basis that 
individual issues of antitrust impact and damages would predominate  [**42] over classwide issues. See Weisfeld v. Sun 
Chemical Corp., 210 F.R.D. 136 (D.N.J. 2002), aff'd by 84 F. App'x 257 (3d Cir. 2004); Reed v. Advocate Health Care, 268 
F.R.D. 573 (N.D. Ill. 2009); Fleischman v. Albany Med. Ctr., No. 06-765, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 57188, 2008 WL 2945993 
(N.D.N.Y. July 28, 2008); In re Comp. of Managerial, Prof'l, & Technical Emps. Antitrust Litig., No. 02-2924, 2003 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 22836, 2003 WL 26115698 (D.N.J. May 27, 2003). However, these cases are inapposite because they lack the 
comprehensive documentary record present in the instant case. Moreover, in the instant case, the comprehensive documentary 
record strongly supports the Plaintiffs' experts' theories. In addition, intervening authority such as Amgen has refined the 
predominance inquiry since the cases cited by Defendants were decided. This is particularly true with respect to Reed, a 
Northern District of Illinois case that predates the Seventh Circuit's decisions in Butler v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 727 F.3d 796 
(7th Cir. 2013), and Messner v. Northshore Univ. HealthSystem, 669 F.3d 802 (7th Cir. 2012). These two Seventh Circuit cases 
suggest that the Reed court construed the predominance requirement too stringently. The Court further notes that other 
 [**43] district courts have certified wage suppression antitrust classes, including one since the latest Supreme Court cases. 
See, e.g., Merenda v. VHS of Mich., Inc., No. 06-15601, 296 F.R.D. 528, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131006, 2013 WL 5106520 "
1071,," (E.D. Mich. Sept. 13, 2013); Johnson v. Ariz. Hosp. & Healthcare Ass'n., No. 07-1292, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122807, 2009 WL 
5031334 (D. Ariz. July 14, 2009). "
1073,8," The First and Third Circuits in pre-Dukes, Amgen, and Comcast cases vacated district courts' certification of classes under 
Rule 23(b)(3) and remanded for reconsideration based in part on theories that have been superseded by intervening Supreme 
Court authority. See In re New Motor, 522 F.3d at 8; In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 307 (3d Cir. 2008). 
For example, the First and Third Circuits relied on a theory  [**52] that ""[i]n antitrust class actions, common issues do not 
predominate if the fact of antitrust violation and the fact of antitrust impact cannot be established through common proof."" In re 
New Motor, 522 F.3d at 20; see also In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d at 311 (same). This appears to conflict 
with the Supreme Court's conclusion in Amgen that ""Rule 23(b)(3) . . . does not require a plaintiff seeking class certification to 
prove that each ""elemen[t] of [her] claim [is] susceptible to classwide proof."" 133 S. Ct. at 1191 (emphasis in original). 
Nevertheless, some of the theories in In re New Motor and In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litigation are consonant with 
Amgen. Specifically, the Third Circuit held that a rigorous analysis required resolving conflicts in expert opinions that go to 
certification and that a party's indication that it intends to use common evidence is insufficient for certification. In re Hydrogen 
Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d at 321-23. Similarly, the First Circuit held that a district court should have engaged in a 
searching inquiry into the validity of a novel and complex theory of impact. In re New Motor, 522 F.3d at 27. Accordingly, 
 [**53] the First Circuit found that a district court should have addressed criticisms of the plaintiffs' expert's methodology. Id. In 
light of the fact that these theories appear to be consistent with Supreme Court authority, the Court applies them in the instant 
action. "
1074,9," The third factor, whether the alleged restraint affected interstate commerce, is not disputed. "
1084,10," Chris Galy stated in his deposition: ""Where a manager would come in and say 'I believe that I have an [sic] high-performing' — 
in fact, I just had one of these about a month ago, couple months ago, where we went out and hired somebody, and as we were 
looking at some of the folks on the team, we recognized that the person is — we were at risk of potentially having this person 
feel like they were, you know, not in the market range, so we did an action for [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. . . . We 
gave [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] a salary increase."" Cisneros Decl., Ex. FF (Galy Depo.) at 195. Defendants contest 
this anecdote by contending that the employee in question received a salary increase for purposes unrelated to internal equity. 
Yet the portions of Chris Galy's deposition that the Defendants cite are not in the record. The Court relies on the materials that 
the parties placed in the record. "

Business and the  [**112] Department of Economics at the University of Chicago. Murphy received a bachelor's degree in 
economics from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1981, and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 
1986. Dr. Murphy has published on labor markets and the determinants of wages and compensation. His work in labor 
economics has addressed the market determinants of wage by skill level as well as the determination of relative wages across 
industries and occupations. "
1088,14," Kathryn Shaw, Ph.D., is the Ernst C. Arbuckle Professor of Economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Dr. Shaw 
received an A.B. degree from Occidental College and Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University. Dr. Shaw has published on 
the topic of personnel economics. She also co-pioneered the field of ""insider econometrics,"" a research field in personnel 
economics in which researchers go within companies and use insider knowledge and data to identify the performance gains 
from management practices. "
1089,15," ""A regression is a statistical tool designed to express the relationship between one variable, such as price, and explanatory 
variables that may affect the first variable. Regression analysis can be used to isolate the effect of an alleged conspiracy on 
price, taking into consideration other factors that might also influence price, like costs and demand."" In re Aftermarket Auto. 
Lighting Prods. Antitrust Litig., 276 F.R.D. 364, 371 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "
1092,16," To account for titles with insufficient data to run the title-by-title analysis, Dr. Leamer also divides the employee groups into 
deciles and measures the correlation of each decile to the mean; these groups exhibit the same positive relationship. See 
Leamer Suppl. Rep. Figs. 9, 10. "
1093,17," Dr. Leamer also estimated regressions by splitting the Technical Class titles into deciles. Dr. Leamer explains that, to form the 
ten groups, he ranked titles on the basis of average (inflation adjusted) total compensation over the lifetime of the title and then 
divided these up into deciles based on employee-years. Although Dr. Leamer attempted to break the firms up into 10 equal sized 
groups (equal based on employee years), some groups ended up being larger than others because some titles were more 
populous than others. Leamer Suppl. Rep. ¶ 43, n.8."
1093,18," Plaintiffs argue that this latter result is particularly significant. Defendants' expert, Dr. Murphy, initially contended that an 
""alternative hypothesis that the level of compensation of Defendants' employees is broadly determined by competition in a vast 
labor  [**134] market for similar employees and that adjustments for unique circumstances of particular employees are highly 
individualized."" Murphy Rep. ¶ 89. Plaintiffs argue that this contention becomes unsupportable when used to explain why gains 
for some are shared with others in a subsequent year; there is not a sensible reason that an external force such as increased 
demand for computers would affect some employees in one year and the rest in the next, without resort to internal forces such 
as fairness concerns. Leamer Suppl. Rep. ¶ 8 (""Furthermore, the sharing of gains over time strongly indicates the existence of 
an internal sharing force driving the structure of class member compensation, rather than only external market forces.""). "
1097,19," Defendants moved to strike Dr. Leamer's report in support of Plaintiffs' initial motion for class certification for failure to provide 
reliable, relevant, and admissible testimony under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical, 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. 
Ed. 2d 469 (1993), and Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Defs.' Mot. to Strike Rep. of Dr. Edward E. Leamer (""Mot. to 
Strike""). ECF No. 210. The Court rejected Defendants' motion in its April 5 Class Certification Order. See Apr. 5 Class Cert. 
Order at 49-50 (""While the Court has concerns about the probativeness of some of Dr. Leamer's statistical evidence . . . the 
Court does not find this evidence is so methodologically flawed as to warrant exclusion.""). In their Opposition to the 
Supplemental Motion for Class Certification, Defendants do not raise any new Daubert challenges to the expert opinions set 
forth by Dr. Leamer or Dr. Hallock. See Suppl.  [**150] Opp'n. "
1098,20," Dr. Leamer explains in his supplemental report that he chose to work with title averages because: individual data is likely to be dominated by forces that operate at the individual level, which can make it difficult to detect the 
firm wide effects including the spread of the anti-cold-calling agreements broadly across the firms. Averaging across 
individuals in a title can average out the individual effects, thus making the firm-wide effects more transparent. In addition, a 
title-level analysis provides a clearer perspective on the compensation structures the documentary evidence shows 
Defendants used to maintain their many employees and maintain internal equity among their employees. Leamer Suppl. Rep. ¶ 19. "
1103,21," Defendants also contend that, because the Court ""'encouraged' Leamer to address . . . whether additional variables were 
needed,"" Suppl. Opp'n at 23, and Dr. Leamer did not add variables to his Conduct Regression analysis, Dr. Leamer's model 
should be rejected now. Defendants argue that this is an issue of even greater importance now that Dr. Leamer opines that 
compensation within a firm is highly correlated. Suppl. Opp'n at 23. Defendants maintain that, ""[w]ithout accounting for the 
correlation, Leamer's model cannot reliably determine or measure impact or damages."" Suppl. Opp'n at 23-24 (citing Murphy 
Suppl. Rep. ¶¶ 68-69). Dr. Leamer contends that he ""considered whether to add any variables"" but is ""not aware of any [he] 
need[s] to add at the present time."" Leamer Suppl. Reply Rep. ¶ 66. Given that the  [**176] Court's acceptance of the Conduct 
Regression as a means of proving and calculating harm to the Class was not contingent upon Dr. Leamer's addition of more 
variables to his analysis, the Court does not reject Dr. Leamer's model on this basis. "
1105,22," Defendants further suggest that certifying the Technical Class would violate the Rules Enabling Act because it would prevent 
Defendants from asserting statutory defenses to which they are entitled. In making this argument, Defendants rely on a section 
of Dukes in which the Supreme Court held that Rule 23(b)(2), which provides for the certification of a class seeking injunctive 
relief and not damages, was not an appropriate vehicle for certifying a class of discrimination plaintiffs who sought backpay 
 [**184] under Title VII. Opp'n at 25 (citing Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2561). The Supreme Court held that the putative class could not 
be certified in part because the defendant would not be able to litigate Title VII defenses that it may have had against individual 
class members. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. at 2561. As a result, class certification would have expanded plaintiffs' substantive rights 
under Title VII. This Dukes holding applied to a class under Rule 23(b)(2), which provides for only injunctive relief and not for 
damages; thus, this holding is inapplicable to the instant case. Further, Defendants here have not identified any statutory 
defenses that Defendants would have against particular class members, nor have Defendants contended that certification would 
expand Plaintiffs' rights under the antitrust laws. "
1112,1," Plaintiff argues that Diodes is inapposite because it predates CUTSA and a later codification of a rule moving the obligation to 
identify the precise trade secrets from the pleading stage to the discovery stage. See Opp'n at 7. The Court is not convinced on 
this point: ""[F]ederal courts in the Ninth Circuit look to Diodes for guidance on the applicable pleading standard for claims 
brought under the CUTSA."" Pellerin v. Honeywell, Int'l, Inc., 877 F. Supp. 2d 983, 988 n.1 (S.D. Cal. 2012); see also Farhang v. 
Indian Inst. of Tech., Kharagpur, No. 08-02658 RMW, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53975, 2010 WL 2228936, at *13 (citing Diodes, 
260 Cal. App. 2d at 253). "
1113,2," Farhang held that a patent application cited in an otherwise vague pleading regarding trade secrets could give reasonable 
notice of the scope of a purported trade secret. See 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53975, 2010 WL 2228936, at *13. However, the 
patent applications in Farhang were unpublished and not publicly available. Plaintiff's patents have issued and been published. 
""[I]t is well established that disclosure of a trade secret in a patent places the information comprising the secret into the public 
domain. Once the information is in the public domain and the element of secrecy is gone, the trade secret is extinguished . . . .""

1121,3," Defendant notes that it is not aware of a November 28, 2012 letter, but only of a November 20, 2012 letter. The parties do not 
further address this point, so the Court analyzes only the November 20, 2012 letter. "
1125,1," Ferdman did not pay for the cellular telephones, but the price ""paid"" reflects the amount Sprint billed to the corporate accounts. "
1126,2," Ferdman miscalculates the subtotal for eight Samsung D720 cellular telephones, purchased for $199.99 each. He lists the 
subtotal as $1,599.00, but the correct calculation is $1,599.92. This correction brings the total to $17,035.59."
1126,3," This amount reflects the correction made to Ferdman's calculation, discussed in footnote 2, supra at 5. The amount he stated in 
his written objection was $20,714.67. See Defendant's Amended Objections ¶ 3, at 2. "
1127,4," The Court's citations to the transcript of the hearing refer to the court reporter's original, unedited version. Any final transcript 
may contain slightly different page and/or line numbers. "
1132,, 
1136,6," Ferdman also argues that the PSR incorrectly calculated the total amount of loss between May 15, and May 25, 2011. See 
Objections at ¶ 37, at 12. The Court overrules this objection, because the PSR accurately calculated this amount as $45,035.59. "
1137,7," As discussed in the Relevant Law Regarding Restitution section, supra at 11-15, the MVRA and VWPA are nearly identical in 
authorizing an award of restitution, and, thus, cases interpreting one statute are persuasive in interpreting the other. "
1138,8," Section (b)(4) of the MVRA authorizes courts to ""reimburse the victim for lost income and necessary child care, transportation, 
and other expenses incurred during participation in the investigation or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings "
1139,," related to the offense."" 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(b)(4). The authorization for lost income in this section relates only to the ""investigation 
or prosecution of the offense or attendance at proceedings related to the offense,"" and does not answer the question 
 [*57] whether courts may properly award lost income or lost profits relating to the property damage but not associated with the 
investigation or prosecution of the offense."
1139,9," The Fifth Circuit decided  [*59] this case under the VWPA, but it is persuasive in interpreting the MVRA. See Relevant Law 
Regarding Restitution discussion, supra at 11-15."
1139,10," The Fourth Circuit decided this case under the VWPA, but it is persuasive in interpreting the MVRA. See Relevant Law 
Regarding Restitution discussion, supra at 11-15. "
1140,11," The Second Circuit decided this case under the VWPA, but it is persuasive in interpreting the MVRA. See Relevant Law 
Regarding Restitution discussion, supra at 11-15."
1140,12," The Sixth Circuit decided this case under the VWPA, but it is persuasive in interpreting the MVRA. See Relevant Law 
Regarding Restitution discussion, supra at 11-15. "
1143,13," As explained in Section I of the Analysis, supra at 23-27, the ""retail"" price is what Ferdman calls the ""list"" price, and reflects 
prices between $449.99 and $549.99. The Court has determined that these higher prices more accurately reflect the retail price 
of the cellular telephones because of the business model in subsidizing the cellular telephones and pairing them with service 
contracts. This section incorporates that analysis and will focus on whether this retail value is the correct measure for restitution, 
or if the lower prices, ranging between $149.99  [*74] and $199.99, is correct. Ferdman refers to these lower amounts as the 
actual price paid, even though Ferdman did not pay for the cellular telephones but charged them to someone else's account. "
1144,14," The Ninth Circuit decided this case under the VWPA, but it is persuasive in interpreting the MVRA. See Relevant Law 
Regarding Restitution discussion, supra at 11-15. "
1145,15," The Ninth Circuit decided this case under the VWPA, but it is persuasive in interpreting the MVRA. See Relevant Law 
Regarding Restitution discussion, supra at 11-15. "
1147,16," While Ferdman asked in his Objections for a hearing on the amount of restitution if the Court imposed an amount greater than 
$20,714.67, he did not renew the request for an evidentiary hearing at the sentencing hearing. Moreover, if Ferdman wanted to 
question McGough, he would have subpoenaed him to the sentencing hearing rather than just show up and argue the point. 
While Ferdman  [*92] does not bear the burden of proof, if he wanted to cross-examine the evidence, it was not solely the 
burden of the United States to bring its evidence in precisely the form that Ferdman wanted it; the question is whether the United 
States made its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, and the Court finds the Sprint Letter, without anything to 
undermine it, satisfies that burden. Moreover, the Court's only rationale for holding an evidentiary hearing would be to establish 
that McGough falsely represented Sprint's losses to the Court, and Ferdman's conjecture that the losses overstate Sprint's 
losses does not, alone, give the Court reason to believe that McGough lied to the Court. The Court, accordingly, denies 
Ferdman's written request for an evidentiary hearing. "
1148,17," Congress expressed concern that restitution be calculated as expeditiously as possible. 18 U.S.C. § 3663A(c)(3) provides that 
a court shall not order restitution if ""determining  [*95] complex issues of fact related to the cause or amount of the victim's 
losses would complicate or prolong the sentencing process to a degree that the need to provide restitution to any victim is 
outweighed by the burden on the sentencing process."" See also 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(1)(B)(ii). The Court must also be mindful to 
""impose sentence without unnecessary delay."" Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(1). The Court does not see a sound reason to require 
proof for a complicated calculation based on Sprint's costs in providing the cellular telephones for sale when an easier 
calculation, based on the retail value of the telephones, is rooted in Sprint's losses. The Court notes that, while it does not rest its 
opinion on the ease of calculation, it is easier for a court to take the market value of a shelf product than try to calculate the cost 
of production, particularly in a case like this one, where no one has given the Court the data to make that computation. Also, 
companies that are victims may be reluctant to share such information or go to the expense of making that calculation, causing 
them to forego a claim of restitution, and be victimized a second time by a legal rule that makes seeking restitution  [*96] either 
cost prohibitive or otherwise not worth the effort. "
1151,1," Although the parties' submissions before the Court were filed under seal, the Court declines to file the present Order under 
seal. ""The operations of the courts and the judicial conduct of judges are matters of utmost public concern and the common-law 
right of access to judicial proceedings, an essential component of our system of justice, is instrumental in securing the integrity 
of the process."" Romero v. Drummond Co., 480 F.3d 1234, 1245 (11th Cir. 2007)(internal citations omitted). "
1152,2," In connection with its Mr. Ray's Affidavit (Doc. # 101), Astro Tel has submitted a binder of exhibits  [**6] classified by Astro Tel 
under the categories FC, EX, AP, and PHB (among others). "
1153,3," Astro Tel's Complaint also contains a ninth ""count"" seeking injunctive relief. Rather than a separate, substantive count, count 
nine merely contains a prayer for relief. "
1154,4," Astro Tel incorrectly asserts that this Court previously ""found against"" Verizon on this issue. (Doc. # 100 at 9). The Court 
denied Verizon's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss after determining that Astro Tel's operative Complaint contained adequate 
market definitions  [**13] to escape dismissal. (Doc. # 49 at 8). At this stage of the proceedings, however, Astro Tel must proffer 
evidence in support of its allegations. Astro Tel has not done so with respect to its market definitions. This is fatal to its antitrust 
claims. "
1155,5," As described in Mr. Ray's affidavit, CPNI is ""Customer Proprietary Network Information."" (Ray Aff. Doc. # 101 at ¶ 12). "
1156,6, Astro Tel has not alleged that Verizon's marketing materials contained any false statements.

1162,9," Astro Tel references ""Ray Aff. (Ex. 5, FC-22, FC-28)"" in this section of its response to Verizon's Motion for Summary Judgment. 
These documents do not save Astro Tel's civil conspiracy claim. Mr. Ray's affidavit does not evidence any agreement between 
Verizon and another entity to participate in an unlawful purpose nor does it provide an evidentiary basis for the other required 
elements for stating a civil conspiracy claim. Likewise, the documents labeled FC-22 and FC-28 are two of Astro Tel's service 
tickets, which purport to show that in February of 2010, and January of 2011, Verizon failed to timely install ordered services for 
Astro Tel customers. Astro Tel leaves this Court guessing as to how Verizon's allegedly deficient provision of 
telecommunications services  [**40] to Astro Tel's customers gives rise to a civil conspiracy claim. "

Berry as unpersuasive, concluding instead that the California Supreme Court would find that the CLRA applied to services 
related to the mortgage loans challenged in that case. See also Jefferson v. Chase Home Fin. LLC, No. 06-cv-6510-TEH, 2007

1201,9," The Court notes that, even if Plaintiffs lack publicity rights in broadcast footage, the ""group licensing"" market they identify would 
still encompass the market for group licenses to use their names, images, and likenesses in videogames. The NCAA does not 
argue that the First Amendment or California Civil Code precludes Plaintiffs from selling the rights to use their names, images, 
and likenesses in videogames. Such an argument would likely fail in light of the Ninth Circuit's recent decision in  [**34] this 
case. In re NCAA Student-Athlete Name & Likeness Licensing Litig., 724 F.3d 1268, 1284 (9th Cir. 2013) (""EA's use of the

1233,4," ""Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' and Attorneys General's Joint Application for Attorneys' Fees; Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' 
Application for Costs and Incentive Awards; and Attorneys' General's Application for Costs,"" dated August 6, 2013 (hereinafter, 
""Application""); a copy of the petition is attached as Exhibit 65 in the Appendix hereto. For clarity, all exhibits to the entire Report 
and Recommendations are being numbered sequentially beginning with those in the Appendix to Part I."
1233,5," During the course of the proceedings before the [*91]  Special Master leading up to this Part III of the Report and 
Recommendations, the leadership of the Attorneys General and IPP Counsel were requested to negotiate the broad procedures 
for petitioning for awards of attorneys' fees and the reimbursement of expenses. These negotiations resulted in an agreement 
under which they determined that they would submit a joint petition requesting an aggregate fee award of 25% of the common 
fund, which would then be divided 80.8% to IPP Counsel and 19.2% to the AGs. They also agreed that IPP Counsel and the 
AGs would submit individual requests for the reimbursement of expenses, that compensation for counsel for Celestica and 
Resellers' Allocation Counsel would be requested as expense item, that the totality of expenses requested would not exceed an 
agreed upon cap and that IPP Counsel would submit a request for incentive awards to the named plaintiffs. A copy of this 
agreement is attached as Exhibit 66 to the Appendix hereto. Other than this negotiation, the Special Master has not requested or attempted to suggest any division of the aggregate fee 
award among Counsel. First, the Special Master believes that, especially in light of the fact that the [*92]  aggregate fee request 
is less than Counsel's aggregate lodestar, no allocation to individual firms or Attorneys General can be fairly made without 
knowing the totality of the amount of the fee available for division. Second, while reported lodestars certainly play a role in a fee "
1234,," division, intimate knowledge of the individual firms' relative contributions to Counsel's efforts as a whole — the kind of knowledge 
that is uniquely in the province of the attorneys who assumed leadership roles — is indispensable to a fair and reasonable 
division of a fee award. The Special Master fully endorses the concept embodied in this Court's decision to assign to Co-Lead 
Counsel for the DRAM direct purchaser plaintiffs the responsibility to allocate their aggregate award among the direct purchaser 
plaintiffs' counsel and recommends that this procedure be adopted for IPP Counsel and the Attorneys General. See, ""Order 
Awarding Plaintiffs' Counsel Attorneys' Fees and Reimbursement of Expenses,"" filed August 16, 2007, Dkt. No. 1682."

1235,12," This finding also includes the claims of those Government Purchasers being represented [*96]  by and released in a non-class 
capacity by the Attorneys General. "
1239,13," The AGs also brought their claims pursuant to their own state laws, which also provide for the awarding of reasonable 
attorneys' fees. See, e.g., Fla. Stat. § 542.23 (""In any action under this section in which the plaintiff substantially prevails, the 
court shall award the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee, to the plaintiff.""); Fla. Stat. § 501.2105 (the court may 
award costs and fees); Fla. Stat. § 501.2075 (""If civil penalties are assessed in any litigation, the enforcing authority is entitled to 
reasonable attorney's fees and costs."") Finally, the settling parties here contemplated an award of fees to the AGs. See, e.g., 
Samsung Settlement Agreement ¶ 20 (Dkt. No. 1747-3). "
1240,14," As it developed, the lodestar approach has the tendency to mire trial courts in the minutiae of counsels' daily activities, and in 
the inevitable second guessing of virtually every decision from pre-trial strategy (was filing this motion or that document request 
""reasonably necessary?"") to the staffing of counsels' activities (could that brief have been competently drafted by a lawyer with 
less seniority and hence a lower hourly rate?). See e.g., In re Washington Public Power Supply System Securities 
Litigation, 779 F. Supp 1063 (D.Ariz. 1990). In response to this trend, the Third Circuit convened a Task Force to study the 
question of common fund fee award. In 1985, that Task Force issued a report endorsing the percentage of the fund approach. 
Court Awarded Attorney Fees, Third Circuit Task Force, 108 F.R.D. 237, 250 (1985). "
1241,15," See the Joint Petition submitted to the Special Master on August 7, 2013, a copy of which appears in the Appendix hereto as

submitted to the Special Master on August 7, 2013. Copies of the Gross Declaration and the Varanini Declaration appear in the 
Appendix hereto as Exhibits 67 and 68 respectively."
1241,17," Numerous courts in this Circuit and elsewhere have awarded fees exceeding 25%, including fee awards of one-third of the 
common fund generated by the work of plaintiffs' counsel, under circumstances similar to this case. See, e.g., In re Pacific 
Enters. Sec. Litig., 47 F.3d at 379 (fee award of one-third of common fund justified due to complexity of issues and risks 
involved); Vizcaino, 290 F.3d at 1047-52 (affirming award of 28% of $96 million common fund because of exceptional result and 
extreme risks of the litigation); In re Heritage Bond Litig., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13627, 2005 WL 1594389, at *8 (C.D. Cal. June 
10, 2005) (one-third was justified based on the result obtained, Class Counsel's effort, experience and skill, and the great risk 
assumed); see, e.g., In re Activision Sec. Litig., 723 F. Supp. 1373, 1378 (N.D. Cal. 1989) (benchmark is closer to 30%). In re 
Automotive Refinishing Paint Antitrust Litig., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 569, at *23 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 3, 2008) (one-third, where class 
counsel spent almost [*120]  six years and more than 48,000 hours prosecuting the case); In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 231 
F.R.D. 52, 77-82 (D. Mass. 2005) (one-third of common fund was justified due to, inter alia, skill and efficiency of counsel, 
complexity and four-year duration of the litigation, and class counsel's expenditure of tens of thousands of hours on the case); In 
re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25067, at *58 (D.D.C. July 13, 2001) (determining that one-third was 
reasonable and granting fee award of approximately 34% of the total estimated settlement amount in antitrust price fixing 
litigation); In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51271 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2013) (28.5% of the 
common fund awarded as attorneys' fees); In re Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 1819 (N.D. 
Cal. Oct. 14, 2011) (33-1/3% of common fund awarded as attorneys' fees); Brailsford v. Jackson Hewitt, Inc. et al., C06-00700 
CW, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35509, at *14 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2007) (awarding 30% of the common fund)."
1241,18," As described in the Report, Part I, the litigation was settled in a series of settlements negotiated over a five plus year period. 
Report, Part I, at ¶¶ 4-8. The first settlement negotiated was with Samsung and included a separate breakdown of an amount for "
1242,," attorneys' fee payments to the IPP Counsel and the AGs in the amounts of $19.5 million and $1 million, respectively, which have 
been held in separate escrow accounts from the balance of the Samsung payments. Id at ¶ 59. However, none of the 
subsequent settlements with the other Defendants included any separate breakdown of contributions earmarked for attorneys' 
fees. Id at ¶¶ 61-98. The Petition filed by IPP Counsel and the AGs seeks a fee award of 25% of the total $310,720,000 
Settlement Fund, without regard [*122]  to the location of the escrowed funds from which it would be paid. The Special Master 
agrees that it is appropriate to compute the Ninth Circuit benchmark fee, which is the starting point for making all fee awards in 
this Circuit, as 25% of the total cash settlement consideration regardless of whether certain amounts of that consideration are 
earmarked for certain purposes since all such purposes are for the benefit of the proposed settlement classes. Moreover, the 
Special Master finds that treating the $20,500,000 separately contributed by Samsung for the purpose of paying a portion of 
counsels' fees and expenses the same as all other funds contributed by the defendants is a fair and reasonable method of 
reconciling the difference between the provisions of the Samsung settlement agreement and the other five agreements that 
make up the global settlement of the litigation."

1242,20, A copy of each of these declarations appears in the Appendix hereto as Exhibit 69. 
1243,21," The Special Master notes that a review of the individual firm declarations reveals that there may be some very limited 
confusion in a couple of the declarations as to the hourly rates reported on an individual firm basis, and therefore neither of Mr. 
Gross' lodestar calculations (which he does qualify as ""approximate"") is purely current or purely historical. However, this is 
irrelevant to the validity of the lodestar cross check since in this Circuit, when using the lodestar approach it is appropriate to 
compensate attorneys in common fund cases for delay in payment, ""either (1) by applying the attorneys' current rates to all 
hours billed during the course of the litigation; or (2) by using the attorneys' historical rates and adding a prime rate 
enhancement."" Fischel v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc'y of the United States, 307 F.3d 997, 1010 (9th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation

1244,26," Although not a lodestar method award, Judge Illston recently reconsidered and increased to 25% an award she had made of

Block Enterprises, LLC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128514 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 10, 2012)."

Declaration is included in Exhibit 69 in the Appendix hereto. "

Richard M. Pearl, dated September 7, 2012 and filed the same day also as part of Docket No. 6662-3, which is Exhibit 72 to the 
Appendix hereto."
1245,30," While not all are not completely free of areas that might bear more inquiry if the lodestar method were employed, employing 
any particular lodestar as a cross-check does not require a determination that every hour in the computation was in fact 
reasonably expended for the benefit of the class. The cross-check requirement is satisfied if the lodestar when compared to the 
percentage fee award generates a multiplier that is within a range that the court finds is fair and reasonable in light of the 
particular circumstances of the case and multipliers awarded in similar matters. Similarly, the common expedient of applying a 
percentage reduction to the claimed lodestar for what some courts believe is an inevitable degree of duplication and waste 
does [*137]  not mean that each of the individual firm lodestars that make up the aggregate lodestar should be subject to the 
same reduction, or necessarily any reduction at all. It may be that some of the individual lodestars reflect services of very little 
value to the class while others reflect the services of counsel who held the laboring oars and exercised rigorous ""billing 
judgment"" when recording their time. This is a determination that does not become relevant until there is an allocation of the fee "
1246,," award among individual firms, a determination, which as the Special Master noted above, is best made by leadership counsel 
who are the most familiar with the work done in the litigation."
1246,31," Some of these efforts will be discussed below and others are detailed in the Report, Part I, at ¶¶ 42-55, 108-114 and 204-260."

Class is also consideration for the release of the parens patriae claims being asserted on their behalf by certain of the AGs, and 
that no determination of the applicability of AGC was ever made as to those claims. Nevertheless, the Special Master agrees 
with the view that the dismissal of the claims arising from the purchase of DRAM containing products was a ""devastating"" blow 
to the Settlement Class's chances of securing a significant recovery in this litigation and that Counsel should be both

] F.R.Civ.P. 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to state law causes of action: ""[W]hile a federal court will examine state law to determine whether the elements of fraud have been  [**28] pled sufficiently to state a cause of action, the Rule 9(b) 
requirement that the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity is a federally imposed rule."" Vess v. Ciba-Geigy 
Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1995)(italics in original)) "

1295,1," Health care providers generally bill patients for services under CPT code designations. Each service has its own CPT code.

1295,2," The regulation was amended on January 7, 2013, to further expand the types of x-rays that chiropractors may perform. See 43 
N.J.R. 3076(a), 3078 (Nov. 21, 2011). "
1296,3," A third bill proposed to amend the medical service corporation law to treat doctors of chiropractic as participating physicians. 
Assembly Bill 21, 196th Leg. (1974). The proposal was not adopted until 1977. L. 1977, c. 297, § 3 (codified at N.J.S.A. 17:48A-
32). "
1297,4," We do not address whether a consumer may seek relief in a private action based on rights established in N.J.S.A. 17B:27-51.1. 
That issue is not before us. "
1298,5, Plaintiff Association of New Jersey Chiropractors did not join in the contract count of the amended complaint. 
1300,6," The federal analog is Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which states, ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 2."
1300,7," As plaintiffs here do not allege that Horizon has engaged in illegal restraint of trade under the analogous provision of our 
Antitrust  [*30] Act, N.J.S.A. 56:9-3, we need not address the basis for the court's decision on Section 1. However, we note that 
the court recognized, ""It is well established that an insurer such as Blue Cross, who in effect purchases health care services on 
behalf of its subscribers, does not violate Section 1 by using its market power to negotiate even sharply discounted fees that 
healthcare providers agree to accept as full payment for services."" Griffiths, supra, 147 F. Supp. 2d at 1210 (surveying 
authority). "
1301,8," Defendants do not argue, and therefore we do not address whether Horizon's challenged activities are exempt under the New 
Jersey Antitrust Act. See N.J.S.A. 56:9-5(b)(4) (exempting ""the activities . . . of any insurer . . . to the extent such activities are 
subject to regulation by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance""); N.J.S.A. 56:9-5(b)(5) (exempting ""bona fide . . . 
charitable activities of any not for profit corporation . . . established exclusively for . . . charitable purposes); N.J.S.A. 56:9-5(c) 
(exempting ""any activity directed, authorized or permitted by any law of this State"" that conflicts with the New Jersey Antitrust 
Act). "
1306,1," Plaintiffs initially also filed suit against the videogame developer, Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA), and the marketing firm, Collegiate 
Licensing Company (CLC), but subsequently agreed to settle their claims against those parties."
1306,2," All subsequent references to ""Plaintiffs"" in this order allude specifically to the twenty-one Antitrust Plaintiffs and not to the four 
Right-of-Publicity Plaintiffs, whose claims are not at issue here. "
1308,3," Because Plaintiffs only need to satisfy the commonality requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) with respect to the proposed Damages 
Subclass, those requirements are addressed in a separate section of this order. "
1309,4," Although the NCAA contends that ""[i]ndividual defenses will predominate,"" Docket No. 789, NCAA Sur-Reply, at 22, it raises 
this argument under Rule 23(b)(3), not Rule 23(a)(3). Accordingly, these ""individual defenses"" are addressed separately below, 
in the section discussing the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3). "
1310,5," Like Parrish, Brown involved claims by a group of retired football players seeking to assert their group licensing rights under a 
series of agreements with the NFL. In considering the plaintiffs' class certification motion, the Brown court explained, Contrary to Defendants' assertions, [the named plaintiff]'s relative lack of celebrity does not cause his damages claim to 
conflict with the claims of absent class members. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants failed to honor 
individual licensing agreements, where the players' relative celebrity would likely affect how much Defendants owed each 
retired NFLPA member. Instead, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants failed to license the group of retired NFLPA members in 
the proposed class and to distribute group licensing revenue to them."
1310,281, F.R.D. at 442-43. 
1311,6," Indeed, Plaintiffs' expert could propose a different model for allocating damages among team members without altering his 
substantive analysis of the NCAA's impact on the relevant markets. This is one reason why Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, 133 S. 
Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013), which the NCAA cites  [*29] for support, is inapposite here. In Comcast, the Supreme Court 
decertified a class of antitrust plaintiffs because their expert's damages model was based, in part, on a theory of antitrust liability 
that the trial court had rejected. Id. at 1433. Here, in contrast, not only is Plaintiffs' damages model based on a permissible 
theory of antitrust liability but, what's more, the NCAA has attacked an aspect of Plaintiffs' damages model that could be altered 
without changing their underlying theory of antitrust liability. "
1313,7," Using players' jersey numbers is not an option because NCAA teams frequently allow multiple players to wear the same jersey 
number. "
1324,1," Specifically, FDMS's original Complaint alleged tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual and business 
relationships (Count I), false endorsement/association in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A) (Count II), 
trademark, service mark and tradename infringement in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1) and 1125(a)(1)(A) 
(Count III), false advertising in violation of the Lanham Act 15 U.S.C. § 1125 (a)(1)(B) (Count IV) and common law unfair 
 [*4] competition (Count V). Following a stay of this action pending final disposition of the earlier case filed in the District of Utah 
and the subsequent denial of FDMS's Preliminary Injunction Motion filed in this Court, FDMS was permitted to amend its 
Complaint (ECF No. 91). The Amended Complaint (ECF No. 92) filed by both First Data Plaintiffs seeks declaratory relief (Counts I & IX) and alleges 
breach of contract (Count II), common law unfair competition (Count III), tortious interference with existing and prospective 
contractual and business relationships (Count IV), injurious falsehood (Count V), as well as violations of the Lanham Act, 15 
U.S.C. §§ 1114(1) and 1125(a)(1)(A) (Counts VI, VII & VIII). "
1325,2," Specifically, SecurityMetrics alleges: For PCI Standard compliance validation purposes, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover each divide merchants into four levels; 
 [*7] American Express divides them into three; and JCB divides them into two. Following the classifications used by Visa 
and MasterCard, the lowest-volume merchants are commonly referred to as ""Level 4 merchants."" Def.'s Countercl. ¶ 30. The Court adopts this terminology herein. "
1326,3," The Terms of Settlement is a one page document, reading in relevant part: First Data Merchant Services (""FD"") and SecurityMetrics, Inc. (""SM"") agree to the following essential terms  [*10] of 
settlement: • The parties shall incorporate these terms of settlement in a final settlement agreement, in a form and with content 
mutually acceptable to both parties, [REDACTED]. • [REDACTED] • The parties shall keep confidential the terms of this settlement and those facts and circumstances forming the basis 
of or that relate to allegations that were asserted by both parties in connection with this dispute, and shall include 
mutual confidentiality provisions in a final settlement agreement. • The parties shall agree to mutual non-disparagement provisions, consistent with the relationship of competitors in a 
free market place, in a final settlement agreement. • [REDACTED] • FD shall dismiss with prejudice the lawsuit it filed in Federal Court, and the parties hereby mutually release each 
other from any and all obligations and claims, known or unknown. Def.'s Countcl. Ex. F, ECF No. 157-6. "
1328,4," Of course, the Court's refusal to dismiss SecurityMetrics' First Counterclaim does not bar First Data from raising these 
arguments or similar estoppel arguments on dispositive motion."
1328,5," This Court will follow the common convention of referring to the individual sections of the Lanham Act rather than the United 
States Code. For ease of reference, however, citations are formatted using the United States Code. "
1329,6," The cases from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit contain similarly contradictory statements. Compare P. Lorillard 
Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 186 F.2d 52, 47 F.T.C. 1755 (4th Cir. 1950) (""To tell less than the whole truth is a well known 
method of deception."") with Matkari, 7 F.3d at 1139 (rejecting Lanham Act claim that defendant's act of putting a drug on the 
market constituted a false statement that the defendant's drug had received FDA approval)."
1329,7," Moreover, because SecurityMetrics has stated a claim for affirmative misstatement, this Court need not determine the legal 
viability of a false advertising claim premised upon a failure to disclose. See supra note 6 & accompanying text."
1329,8," In its  [*22] Opposition brief, SecurityMetrics asserts that its Sixth Counterclaim is brought pursuant to § 43(a)(1)(A). See Def.'s 
Opp'n, at 20."
1329,9," First Data states that it seeks only partial dismissal of the Sixth Counterclaim; specifically, it claims to only seek dismissal 
based on ""misleading product designations,"" not ""false statements."" See Pls.' Mot. Dismiss, at 9. "

The Court notes that those cases are not binding authority on this Court and finds them distinguishable  [*27] based upon the 
interests raised."
1331,14," Based on the timing of the suit, certain  [*30] other further requirements may be applicable. See 15 U.S.C. § 1064. These 
requirements have not been raised here."
1331,15," In its Motion to Dismiss, First Data cites to several district court opinions for the proposition that standing to maintain a 
cancellation action requires a commercial or economic interest in the disputed mark. See Pl.'s Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Certain 
Countercl., at 12 (citing to Akhenaten v. Najee, LLC, 544 F. Supp. 2d 320, 332 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); Gen. Healthcare Ltd. v. Qashat, "

LEXIS 9243, 2000 WL 897141, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2000)). This Court does not find those cases to be persuasive in the 
discussion here. In particular, none of the cited cases are from the Fourth Circuit or this Court. Instead, the Federal Circuit (and 
its predecessor, the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals), which reviews the decisions of the Trademark Trial 
and Appeal Board, is the more persuasive authority."
1332,16," As indicated supra, ISOs are ""third-party sales organizations that associate with acquirers and payment processors to find, 
open, aggregate, and manage merchant processing accounts."" Def.'s Countercl. ¶ 90."
1332,17," Following the convention laid out above, this Court will refer to sections of the Sherman Antitrust Act in-text but will cite to the 
United States Code."
1332,18," Similarly, § 11-204(a)(1) of the Commercial Law Article of the Maryland Code states that HN22[
] ""[a] person may not . . . 
[b]y contract, combination, or conspiracy with one or more other persons, unreasonably restrain trade or commerce."" HN23[
] 
In construing this provision, the courts are to be ""guided by the interpretation given by the federal courts to the various federal 
statutes dealing with the same or similar matters."" Md. Code, Commercial Law, § 11-202(a)(2). "
1334,19," Similarly, § 11-204(a)(2) of the Commercial Law Article of the Maryland Code provides: HN30[
] A person may not . . . Monopolize,  [*39] attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with one or more other 
persons to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce within the State, for the purpose of excluding competition or of 
controlling, fixing, or maintaining prices in trade or commerce. Md. Code, Com. Law § 11-204(a)(2). As noted supra, HN31[
] the interpretation of the Maryland antitrust statute is to be 
""guided by the interpretation given by the federal courts to the various federal statutes dealing with the same or similar matters."" 
Md. Code, Commercial Law, § 11-202(a)(2)."
1334,20," In addition, SecurityMetrics argues that its allegations with respect to the bundled discounts  [*41] provided to ISOs, the use of 
allegedly ""baseless"" litigation, and the use of a ""misinformation campaign"" to convince ISOs that SecurityMetrics cannot use 
merchant data for selling its products or services are all also sufficient to support its attempted monopolization claim. Def.'s 
Opp'n, at 42-46. "
1346,1," This Court has already addressed the statutes of limitations challenge by dismissing challenges to the AstraZeneca/Ranbaxy 
Agreement brought under Illinois, Puerto Rico, Utah, and Rhode Island law, as well as the twenty-three states with statutes of 
limitations of four years or less. Order 80-86; Order End-Payor Pls.' Mot. Leave Amend Consol. Am. Class Action Compl.

1346,2," As I write this paragraph, I'm struck by how ""the more things change the more they remain the same."" Jean-Baptiste Alphonse 
Karr, Les Guêpes, Jan. 1849 (""plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose""). Compare Professor Arthur Sutherland's famous 
poem The Ship Blaireau describing the cases of Church v. Hubbart, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 187, 2 L. Ed. 249 (1804) and Mason v. 
Ship Blaireau, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 240, 2 L. Ed. 266, 16 F. Cas. 1009 (1804): Well now they file their libels And they cite Sir William Scott. The sailors say the French must pay; Their counsel argues not. Legal Chowder: Lawyering and Judging in Massachusetts 189-190 (Kass., J. ed. 2000). "
1347,3," Nothing has so diluted and debased the importance of fact-finding in the federal courts as the requirement of the U.S. 
Sentencing Guidelines to find ""faux facts"" in the sentencing of offenders. United States v. West, 552 F. Supp. 2d 74, 76 (D. 
Mass. 2008). These sentencing conclusions are drawn from a mosaic of hearsay largely controlled by the government. The data 
may be based on uncharged, unproven, even acquitted conduct. See United States v. Green, 346 F. Supp. 2d 259, 278-79 (D. 
Mass. 2004), vacated in part sub nom., United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2005), vacated and remanded sub 
nom., United States v. Pacheco, 434 F.3d 106 (1st Cir. 2006). It is indeed ironic that we today routinely impose lengthy prison 
sentences based on  [**27] nothing more than uncorroborated hearsay but are exhorted to apply ""rigorous analysis"" to citizens 
seeking the benefits of collective action against a defendant. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551. "
1348,4," The parties (and potential interveners) raise a lot of hullabaloo over this Court's refusal to accept filings under seal. It is true 
that AstraZeneca's present discounts granted to various purchasers constitute confidential business data. Even though there is 
here no suggestion that AstraZeneca is violating the Robinson-Patman Act, Pub. L. No. 74-692, 49 Stat. 1526 (codified at 15 
U.S.C. § 13), revealing these present and ongoing relationships could embarrass AstraZeneca commercially as less favored 
purchasers jockey for better deals and most favored purchasers see their competitive advantage evaporating. Naturally AstraZeneca here seeks a litigation advantage by spreading its particular discounts and discount policies before the 
Court to further the arguments  [**30] made in the text above - it just doesn't want anyone else to know what it is doing. In short, 
it wants to win - but it doesn't want me to explain why (or why not). This is simply unacceptable. Courts are public institutions, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. See 
Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 580, 100 S. Ct. 2814, 65 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1980). Their moral authority 
arises in significant measure from the fact that ""[j]udicial choice, at its best, is reasoned choice candidly explained."" Hon. Robert 
E. Keeton, Keeton on Judging in the American Legal System 5 (1999). Here, it's no secret that AstraZeneca discounts Nexium sales and discounts deeply. At the present stage of the litigation, this is 
all the Court needs to know to evaluate the expert reports at the level of generality set forth in the text above. Accordingly, this 
Court has simply ignored the detailed data AstraZeneca seeks to place before it under seal. These materials are to be returned 
to AstraZeneca. Its motions to file these documents under seal are thus denied as moot (ECF Nos. 323, 367, 425) as are the 
motions of the potential intervenors (ECF Nos. 371, 385). This problem, of course, is not going to go away. Should  [**31] the End-Payors prevail at trial, the actual assessment of 
damages may require the examination of these discounts in exquisite detail. We can cross that bridge when we come to it, 
however, because the Court will reach that issue only if AstraZeneca is in violation of the antitrust laws, and that makes a 
significant difference. "
1350,5," The Court toyed with defining the proposed class to include only members who actually suffered economic injury. Such a 
definition, however, would create an impermissible ""fail-safe"" class - one in which  [**37] it is virtually impossible for the 
Defendants ever to ""win"" the case, with the intended class preclusive effects. I am indebted for this insight to Matthew Stein, 
Esq., speaking at the ABA 17th Annual National Institute on Class Actions (October 24, 2013). "
1353,6," This Court speaks of ""management for trial"" rather than using the more familiar ""case management"" phrase to emphasize the 
goal of the entire process. The matter is fully discussed in United States v. Massachusetts, 781 F. Supp. 2d at 21-26."
1353,7," Walker upholds the innovative trial management decisions of the judges of the Middle District of Florida. After class action 
proceedings in the courts of Florida, see Engle v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 945 So.2d 1246 (Fla. 2006), that district wound up with over 
5,000 individual tobacco product  [**51] liability suits to try. One of America's most productive federal district courts, United States v. Massachusetts, 781 F. Supp. at 26, each judge of the 
Middle District of Florida handles a caseload of 513 civil cases. Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, U.S. District Court - 
Judicial Caseload Profile, Federal Court Management Statistics, http://jnet.ao.dcn/sites/default/files/pdf/FCMS_District_Profile 
s_September_2012.pdf#page=91 (last visited Nov. 13, 2013). Moreover, the Middle District of Florida is a true trial court. While a 
citizen's right to sit on the nation's federal juries has declined by nearly a third over the last eight years (32.54% to be exact), see 
SEC v. EagleEye Asset Mgmt., No. 11-11576-WGY, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 144700, 2013 WL 5498182, at *2 n.5 (D. Mass. Oct 
4, 2013), in the Middle District of Florida it has actually increased by 17.29% over the same period. "
1354,," Having boiled the 5,000+ individual cases down to 1360 cases that are actually triable, the judges of the Middle District of 
Florida reached out to their colleagues nationwide. At present, thirty-eight judges from every geographical circuit sitting in all five 
of the locations where Middle Florida holds court are scheduled to try as  [**52] many of these Engle progeny cases as can be 
reached in 2014. No vanishing jury trial here - indeed, this intricate procedural and practical challenge shows the federal district 
courts at their best, a truly national court system."
1354,8," Pursuant to the Court's Order, see ECF No.352, and its Order addressing the End-Payor Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend 
Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, see ECF No. 448, this class definition applies specifically to the End-Payors' 
challenges against the reverse payment agreements made between AstraZeneca and Teva (""AstraZeneca/Teva Agreement""), 
and AstraZeneca and Dr. Reddy's (""AstraZeneca/Dr.Reddy's Agreement""). In regards to the agreement between AstraZeneca 
and Ranbaxy (""AstraZeneca/Ranbaxy Agreement""), the End-Payor class is limited to the following states: Maine, Vermont, and 
Wisconsin. "
1358,1," Judge Hibbler's memorandum opinion and order of February 4, 2011, and this Court's memorandum opinion and order of 
January 18, 2013, set forth a detailed factual history, which the Court adopts and incorporates in this opinion."
1358,2," The Wolf Haldenstein complaint was the last direct purchaser complaint filed in this district. Prior to its filing, there were four 
prior cases with eight other law firms representing Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs. The first of those was filed four months before the 
Wolf Haldenstein complaint, and the complaint filed by Lovell Stewart (co-lead counsel) preceded the Wolf Haldenstein 
complaint by almost a month. "
1359,3, The Wolf Haldenstein partnership agreement provides for a 90-day notice period. 
1361,4," Lovell Stewart submitted a statement concerning Ms. Fait's motion, noting that it takes ""no  [*20] position on which successor 
entity should be appointed as our co-lead counsel"" and ""oppos[ing] any appointment of both successors as separate co-lead 
counsel"" as ""contrary to the interests of the class."" Lovell Stewart noted, ""The amount of work in the case to date and the 
prospective work remaining, while large, was not and will not be the type of case for which three co-lead counsel are 
appropriate."" See Dkt. No. 391 (emphasis in original). "
1362,5," The Court is aware that liaison counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Court. See, e.g., In re Ameriquest Mortg. Co. 
Mortg. Lending Practices Litig., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100766, 2008 WL 5170769, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 10, 2008).  [*23] The 
MCL § 10.221 outlines the responsibilities of liaison counsel: Charged with essentially administrative matters, such as communications between the court and other counsel (including 
receiving and distributing notices, orders, motions, and briefs on behalf of the group), convening meetings of counsel, 
advising parties of developments, and otherwise assisting in the coordination of activities and positions. Such counsel may 
act for the group in managing document depositories and in resolving scheduling conflicts. Liaison counsel will usually have 
offices in the same locality as the court. The court may appoint (or the parties may select) a liaison for each side, and if 
their functions are strictly limited to administrative matters, they need not be attorneys. At this time, the arrangement of Lovell Stewart as lead counsel and Wolf Haldenstein as local counsel appears all that is needed 
to efficiently and effectively represent the interests of Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs. "
1415,1, The Court will issue a separate order regarding Best Buy's motion for fees and costs. Docket No. 8610. 
1417,2," Further, the Court notes that the trebled damages award of $22,415,829 is more than offset by the $229,000,000 in settlements 
that Best Buy received from other defendants, and thus to the extent  [*190] that the jury improperly included any damages 
attributable to Toshiba in its damages award, HannStar is not harmed."
1417,3," Those entities are Acer Display Co., NEC LCD Technologies Ltd., Hydis Technologies Co., Ltd. (BOE Hydis Technology Co., 
Ltd.), Unipac Optoelectronics, Mitsubishi Electronics Corp., Royal Philips Electronics N.V., and Toppoly Optoelectronics. "
1421,4," The satisfaction would be ""partial"" because Best Buy seeks its fees and costs as the prevailing party under the antitrust 
statutes."
1421,5," The Ninth Circuit's decision in William Inglis cited Syverson with approval. Syverson was superseded by statute as stated in 
Goodman v. Lozano, 47 Cal.4th 1327, 104 Cal. Rptr. 3d 219, 223 P.3d 77 (2010). In Goodman, the California Supreme Court 
interpreted various sections of the California Code of Civil Procedure regarding who is a ""prevailing party""; those California 
statutes are not at issue in this case. However, to the extent it is relevant, the Goodman court reaffirmed the principle that ""[i]f 
the settlement amount is greater than the damage award, the award is entirely offset, resulting in a zero judgment."" Goodman, 
47 Cal. 4th at 1330. "
1425,1," The July 18, 2013 Order can be found at Dahl v. Bain Capital Partners, LLC, No. 07-12388-EFH, 963 F. Supp. 2d 38, 2013 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 100432, 2013 WL 3802433, *1-10 (D. Mass. July 18, 2013) [**13]  (denying Carlyle and other defendants' 
renewed individual motions for summary judgment). The related orders are Dahl v. Bain Capital Partners, LLC, 937 F. Supp. 
2d 119, 122-39 (D. Mass. 2013) (denying summary judgment on Defendants' omnibus motion as to Count One but reserving the 
issue of Defendants' individual connection to the overarching conspiracy under Count One for a additional briefing, and denying 
summary judgment as to Count Two); and Dahl v. Bain Capital Partners, LLC, 937 F. Supp. 2d 119, 139 (D. Mass. 2013) 
(denying motion for reconsider under Count Two)."
1425,2," Interlocutory review under 28 U.S.C. §1292(b) is warranted only when the challenged order ""involves [1] a controlling question 
of law [2] as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and [3] that an immediate appeal from the order may 
materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."" 28 U.S.C. §1292(b). Because certification under §1292(b) is an 
""extraordinary procedure,"" the party seeking it bears the ""heavy burden"" of demonstrating all three factors. United Air Lines, 
Inc. v. Gregory, 716 F. Supp. 2d 79, 89 (D. Mass. 2010). "
1433,1," On October 29, 2013, the above-entitled action was transferred from the docket of Senior District Judge Harold D. Vietor to 
Chief Judge James E. Gritzner for reasons of Court administration."
1433,2," Judge Vietor declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims contained in Counts IV through X of the 
Complaint, dismissing those Counts without prejudice. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3); United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 
U.S. 715, 726, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966). Those Counts are not at issue herein."
1433,3," The Dismissal Order simply parenthetically referenced [*4]  the section of the Iowa Competition Law that directs harmonization 
with the federal statutory structure: ""See Iowa Code § 553.2 (""This chapter shall be construed to complement and be 
harmonized with the applied laws of the United States which have the same or similar purpose as this chapter. This construction 
shall . . . be made to achieve uniform application of the state and federal laws prohibiting restraints of economic activity and 
monopolistic practices.""). Dismissal Order at 19. "
1434,4," Defendants had argued generally that a failure to meet the standing requirements under the federal statutory framework would 
also constitute a failure under the Iowa Competition Law, citing Davies v. Genesis Medical Center Anesthesia & Analgesic, P.C., 
994 F. Supp. 1078, 1103 (S.D. Iowa 1998). Mot. Dismiss 5-6, ECF No. 22-1. In response, Plaintiff did not raise a distinction that 
such a finding under the federal framework would not necessarily also preclude standing under the Iowa statute. Pl.'s Resist. to 
Mot. Dismiss 8-9, ECF No. 33. "
1444,1," Rule 65(c) provides for the posting of security to cover losses incurred by any party found to have been wrongfully restrained or 
enjoined."
1444,2," The Defendants note a nuance in how courts in this Circuit have articulated the standard for injunctive relief. Reply at 17, n.7 
(Adv. Pro. ECF No. 64). See N.Y. Progress & Prot. PAC v. Walsh, 733 F.3d 483, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 21579 at *4 (citing 
Winter v. Natural Resource Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20, 129 S. Ct. 365, 172 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2008)) (stating that four 
elements all must be satisfied: irreparable harm, likelihood of success on the merits, balance of equities tips in the moving 
party's favor, and injunctive relief is in the public interest). The Court notes that all the formulations include irreparable harm and 
a review of the merits. The Court's result today would be the same regardless of which formulation of the test is used. "
1445,3," In responding to the Court's question about evidence at the hearing, Plaintiffs' counsel referred to information in the Plaintiffs' 
 [**17] answers to interrogatories. Of course, such discovery is not filed with the Court as a matter of course and only makes its 
way into the record if it is submitted by a party. It was not submitted to the Court by the Plaintiffs here."
1445,4," As the Second Circuit explained in Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency Med., 428 F.3d 408 (2d Cir. 2005), HN7[
] Congress did not intend the antitrust laws to provide a remedy in damages for all injuries that might conceivably be 
traced to an antitrust violation."" Associated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 
459 U.S. 519, 534, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). Just as in common-law tort and contract litigation, concepts 
such as ""foreseeability and proximate cause, directness of injury, certainty of damages, and privity of contract"" circumscribe 
a party's right to recovery, so in antitrust actions ""the plaintiff's harm, the alleged wrongdoing by the defendants, and the 
relationship between them,"" can limit the right to sue . . . The same logic applies to claims for injunctive relief under Section 
16 of the Clayton Act. Id. at 436; see also National Auto Brokers Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 60 F.R.D. 476, 492 (S.D.N.Y. 1973) (to obtain 
injunctive relief,  [**18] a plaintiff must demonstrate that ""he is threatened with loss or damage . . . 'of a sort personal to the 
plaintiff.'"") (quoting United States v. Borden Co., 347 U.S. 514, 518, 74 S. Ct. 703, 98 L. Ed. 903, (1954)). "
1446,5," Notably, the alleged injury in that case is similar, if not identical to the injuries alleged in this case."
1446,6," At the hearing, the Plaintiffs sought to excuse their failure to provide evidence for a variety of reasons. But the Court is 
unpersuaded. The Court is particularly skeptical of Plaintiffs' position because they have had access in the DOJ Action to 
millions of pages of documents, as well as numerous deposition transcripts."
1446,7," At the hearing, the Clayton Plaintiffs requested to supplement their submission with additional documents. But the Court denied 
that request given all the circumstances in this case, including that the Plaintiffs waited until noon on Thursday November 23, 
2013, to file their TRO Motion that they requested be heard on Monday, November  [**21] 26, 2013. Cf. SEC v. Frank, 388 F.2d 
486, 490 (2d Cir. 1968) (""One standard with respect to the taking of evidence derivable from this framework is that where 
interlocutory relief is truly needed, Rule 65 demands such but only such thoroughness as a burdened federal judiciary can 
reasonably be expected to attain within twenty days.""); Consolidated Gold Fields PLC v. Minorco, S.A., 871 F.2d 252, 256 (2d 
Cir. 1989) (HN9[
] ""There is no hard and fast rule in this circuit that oral testimony must be taken on a motion for a preliminary 
injunction or that the court can in no circumstances dispose of the motion on the papers before it."") (quoting Redac Project 6426, 
Inc. v. Allstate Insurance Co., 402 F.2d 789, 790 (2d Cir. 1968)). "
1447,8," Indeed, courts in the Southern District of New York have recognized divestiture as an appropriate remedy for violations of the 
Clayton Act. See Julius Nasso Concrete Corp. v. DIC Concrete Corp., 467 F. Supp. 1016, 1025 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (HN11[
] 
""Carving  [**25] out an exception for divestiture from the general grant of power to fashion equitable remedies is contrary to the 
general purpose behind section 7 and this Court agrees that there is not sufficient reason to do so absent express 
Congressional mandate.""); Fuchs Sugars and Syrups, Inc., v. Amstar Corp. 402 F. Supp. 636, 640 (S.D.N.Y. 1975) (concluding 
that divestiture is a potential remedy for private parties injured by violations of the Clayton Act); see also Cia. Petrolera Caribe, 
Inc. v. Arco Caribbean, Inc., 754 F.2d 404, 417 (1st Cir. 1985). "
1448,9," Mr. Alioto actually filed a lawsuit in the Northern District of California challenging the merger in early July—without seeking a 
lifting of the bankruptcy stay—but then waited more than a month to file the Clayton Adversary."
1448,10," Indeed, counsel for US Airways stated that if the DOJ action ended and the Clayton Plaintiffs ""want to come in the next day 
and say that even though she's cleared the merger that you should stop it, they get that opportunity."" Id. at 32."
1448,11," The scheduling order in the Clayton Adversary provides that ""[n]otwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in 
the event of any resolution of the DOJ Action in favor of the Defendants, (a) Defendants reserve all of their rights to seek to 
consummate the merger . . . and (b) Plaintiffs reserve all of their rights to seek in this Court appropriate relief enjoining 
consummation of such merger, pending disposition of the Adversary Proceeding."" Id. at ¶ 12. "
1449,12," Based on Supreme Court decisions from the 1960s such as Brown Shoe, the Plaintiffs advocate a very stringent rule that 
market share alone can establish a successful Section 7 antitrust claim. Defendants disagree, presenting a more comprehensive 
review of the subject that includes more recent case law. As the Court is not ruling on the ultimate merits of the Section 7 claim 
here, the Court is not making any final determination now of the nuances of the standard to be applied on the merits. But a quick 
review of the relevant antitrust case law suggests that antitrust law has evolved since the 1960's to encompass a more flexible, 
industry-specific analysis. For purposes of the TRO request at issue, therefore, the Court uses the standard described above as 
a reference  [**33] point to discuss the merits of Plaintiffs' case."
1449,13," There was no trial or decision on the merits in the DOJ case. Therefore, the allegations in the DOJ Complaint have not been 
proved true or false and remain merely allegations. "
1450,14," HHI is an index used to measure concentration  [**35] in a market, which is calculated by squaring the market share of each 
firm competing in a market and then summing the resulting numbers. See United States Department of Justice and Federal 
Trade 
Commission 
Horizontal 
Merger 
Guidelines, 
§ 
5.3 
(August 
19, 
2010) 
available 
at www.justice.gov/atr/public/guidelines/hmg-2010.html#5 (the ""Merger Guidelines""). The DOJ uses HHI numbers to determine 
thresholds for when an industry is considered highly concentrated or when potential mergers require investigation. Id."
1450,15," The HHI issue highlights the difficulties of relying too heavily upon other parties for one's analysis. While the DOJ Complaint 
includes this information, the Court is mindful that the DOJ has, in fact, decided to settle its lawsuit. So one must assume that 
the anticompetitive concerns raised by this HHI information have, in the opinion of the DOJ, been satisfactorily addressed by the 
terms of the settlement of the DOJ Action. As Defendants' counsel pointed out at argument, the DOJ has specifically concluded 
that the settlement of the Government's antitrust case, complete with its contemplated divestitures, yields better results for the 
public than blocking the merger as originally  [**36] proposed. See Remarks as Prepared for Delivery by Assistant Attorney 
General Bill Baer at the Conference Call Regarding the Justice Department's Proposed Settlement with US Airways and 
American Airlines (November 12, 2013) http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/press_releases/2013/301626.htm (""this settlement . . . 
provides more competition than exists today in this industry""); see also Jack Nicas, Big Airline Merger Is Cleared to Fly, THE

chief, said the settlement was better for competition than if the government had won a court injunction against the merger, 
because the concessions will allow low-cost carriers to expand at major airports.""). Without some independent analysis, it is 
difficult for the Court to draw conclusions from the statements and analysis of the Government upon which the Plaintiffs heavily 
rely, including the DOJ Complaint and the GAO Report."
1450,16," One court has, in fact, rejected the Plaintiffs' theory that a national market exists for airline travel. See Malaney v. UAL Corp., 
434 Fed. Appx. 620, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 10638 at *4-5 (9th Cir. May 23, 2011), affirming 2010 Dist. LEXIS 106049. "
1451,17," Defendants' expert calculated that the post-merger system-wide HHI will be 1768, which is below the Merger Guidelines 
threshold for highly concentrated markets. Declaration of Janusz Ordover ¶ 71 (ECF No. 67)."
1451,18," At the hearing, Defendants' counsel focused his discussion of the likelihood of success on the role of low cost carriers 
(""LCCs"") in the airline industry, a topic frequently discussed during the lengthy trial before the Court on the rejection of collective 
bargaining agreements under Section 1113. Counsel stated that the existence of LCCs plays a significant role in, among other 
things, competitive pricing in the industry and that the settlement furthers the ability of LCCs to flourish by allowing them 
 [**40] access to key airports where they previously were hampered by slot and gate restrictions. Once again, the Plaintiffs have 
presented little analysis on that issue."
1451,19," A more fulsome analysis of the calculations involved in quantifying the risk from delaying the merger is contained in 
paragraphs 12, 15 and 16 of the Polle Declaration. "
1452,20," See TRO Motion at 14 (""Under the Tunney Act, the settlement is subject to public comment for a period of 60 days, and the 
district court retains jurisdiction to ultimately approve or disapprove the merger."")."
1452,21," Indeed, the Court noted at the hearing that the Plaintiffs should seek redress from the United States District Court for the 
District of Columbia to the extent the Plaintiffs claim there is anything about the DOJ Action that prevents consummation of the 
Merger. "
1455,22," To the extent that approval of the settlement is covered under Section 1127(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Court finds that 
the circumstances are warranted and this confirmed plan, when considered in light of the settlement, would satisfy Section 1129 
of the Bankruptcy Code. "
1460,1, VFML did not challenge the sufficiency of Pro Search's allegations with respect to the three Product Markets. 
1461,2," Another competitor with VFML, ICE Portal, settled an antitrust action with VFML and ""no longer distributes directly to the 
channels  [*14] for hotel content distribution, but instead has an agreement with VFML to use its distribution platform."" (SAC ¶ 
88.) According to Pro Search, ""[a]fter ICE Portal settled with VFML, [Pro Search] became VFML's main remaining competitor in 
the relevant markets."" (Id. ¶ 89.) "
1462,3," The Omega decision, which concerned a judgment following trial, did not address de facto exclusivity. "
1463,4," As the Court finds that Pro Search has sufficiently pleaded a de facto exclusive dealing claim, the Court makes no finding as to 
whether Pro Search has pleaded a claim based on the agreements themselves. "
1465,5," Although in its Opposition Pro Search ""withdrew"" its copyright claim, it was because ""it is unclear what the confirmation status 
of [the copyright applications] is and whether they have been processed and accepted,"" not because Pro Search does not 
believe it is the author of the works. (Opp'n at 25); see also Dastar, 539 U.S. at 35 (""Reading 'origin' in § 43(a) to require 
attribution of uncopyrighted materials would pose serious practical problems."")."
1465,6," Although Pro Search is in some sense the producer and the author, in that it sells products that are for the distribution of 
images (see SAC ¶¶ 31-41  [*30] (defining Product Markets)), Pro Search's claim is that VFML misrepresents the creator of the 
images, not that VFML misrepresents the product itself (i.e., the management and distribution of images). Cf. Martin v. Walt 
Disney Internet Group, No. 09CV1601-MMA (POR), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65036, 2010 WL 2634695, at *8 (S.D. Cal. June 30, 
2010) (""Under Dastar, the 'good' at issue in this case is [Defendant's magazine], since the magazine itself is the product offered 
for sale to the public. Plaintiff's photograph constitutes the 'idea[s], concept[s], or communication[s] embodied within those 
goods,' which according to Dastar, are clearly not protected under Section 1125(a) of the Lanham Act.""). "
1466,7," Indeed, VFML does not argue that its own contract with Best Western International is terminable at will, unlike its agreements 
with certain other hotels. (See Mot. at 5-6 (Hilton contract ""can be terminated for any reason upon 30-days' notice""; IHG contract 
""can be terminated for any reason upon 90-days' notice with payment of [fees]."").) "
1469,1," Antitrust conspiracies are typically labeled as either horizontal or vertical. ""Restraints imposed by agreement between 
competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, and those imposed by agreement between firms at 
different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Bus. Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 108 S. 
Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988) (emphases supplied). Hub-and-spoke conspiracies are a hybrid in which a hub, ""generally the 
dominant purchaser or supplier in the relevant market,"" coordinates concerted action between ""spokes,"" that is, direct 
competitors connected to the hub by a vertical agreement.  [*5] See Total Benefits Planning Agency, Inc. v. Anthem Blue Cross 
& Blue Shield, 552 F.3d 430, 435 n.3 (6th Cir. 2008). ""The rim of the wheel is the connecting agreements among the horizontal 
competitors . . . that form the spokes."" Id. "
1471,2," Cascades has also sued the following RPX members for infringing various Elbrus Patents:  [*11] ACER America Corp.; Dell, 
Inc.; Hynix Semiconductor, Inc.; LG Electronics; Sharp Electronics Corp.; Sony-Ericsson; and Pantech Wireless, Inc. (FAC ¶ 19.) 
Of these, LG Electronics and Dell were named as defendants in the original complaint in this case. Cascades voluntarily 
dismissed its claims against LG (Dkt. No. 88) and did not name Dell as a defendant in the FAC after the Court dismissed the 
original complaint's claims against Dell with leave to amend (Dkt. No. 93 at 10-12). "
1472,3," The FAC describes Philips as having ""0%"" market share, but at oral argument Cascades' counsel clarified that Philips ""was just 
launching its product line,"" thereby confirming the inference that Philips held a de minimus but actual share of the market. (Dkt. 
No. 113 (""Transcript"")  [*16] at 22:22-25.) "
1475,4," RPX discounts as ""irrelevant,"" ""vague,"" or ""cryptic"" allegations tending to show that the value of Cascades' patent portfolio was 
significantly greater than $10 million. For example, RPX claims that it is irrelevant that Intel took a license ""for a substantial, 
seven-figure lump-sum payment"" (FAC ¶ 11), because ""Intel's situation was unique, coming in the context of Intel hiring the 
patents' lead inventor, Mr. Boris Baba[i]an."" (RPX Mot. at 5) The FAC says nothing about Intel ""hiring"" Babaian, but does specify 
that he is ""an Intel Fellow  [*27] (a prestigious honor)."" (FAC ¶ 10.) Accepting RPX's argument requires one to infer that, 
because Babaian was an Intel Fellow, Intel gratuitously paid millions for his patents. At the pleading stage, the Court cannot 
draw that inference."
1475,5," To be clear, the Court does not pass on the question of whether Cascades' alleged offers to individual Manufacturing 
Defendants should have been more attractive to them. There are a number of reasons why the alleged individual licenses might 
have been unattractive to an individual Manufacturing Defendant acting independently, including perceived weakness of 
Cascades' claims to patent validity, perceived weakness of Cascades' infringement claims, or a desire to repel perceived 
nuisance suits. The Court decides only that the FAC alleges facts which ""tend[] to exclude the possibility of independent action,"" "
1476,," Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984), and provide ""plausible 
grounds to infer an agreement,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556."
1476,6," Manufacturing Defendants purport to demonstrate the counterintuitive proposition that LG's settlement of Cascades' claims—
that is, its acceptance of Cascades' asking price—""confirm[s] that Cascades' asking price was too high."" (Mfr. Reply at 8.) They 
infer from the FAC that LG settled for $800,000 and then ask the Court to determine that this ""minimal payment,"" which 
Manufacturing Defendants say is ""less than a typical run up to a Markman hearing,"" is ""most plausibly viewed as a nuisance 
fee.""  [*32] (Id.) To support their representation of the cost of a Markman hearing, Manufacturing Defendants cite a case where a 
defendant paid nearly $4.7 million in fees to win summary judgment. (Id. (citing MarcTec, LLC v. Johnson & Johnson, 664 F.3d 
907, 910 (Fed. Cir. 2012).) Setting aside how this argument asks the Court to draw inferences adverse to Cascades, as well as 
to assume a fact neither alleged in the FAC nor subject to judicial notice—the cost of a typical Markman hearing—the argument 
does not support dismissal, even if the Court were to accept arguendo its premise that the Elbrus Patents were valueless and 
that LG settled only for ""nuisance value."" To wit: if the Court takes at face value Manufacturing Defendants' claim that a 
Markman hearing typically costs $4.7 million, then Cascades' offer of a license for $5 million with a rebate for the first to accept 
would yield, for the first taker, a discount even on nuisance value. Yet, the FAC alleges, no Manufacturing Defendant responded, 
even with an aggressively lower counteroffer. Thus, even granting Manufacturing Defendants their premises for the sake of 
argument, LG's settlement with Cascades does not require the Court to infer  [*33] that Cascades overvalued the Elbrus Patents 
when it offered to license them individually to the Manufacturing Defendants."
1476,7," The Manufacturing Defendants contend that the severe penalties imposed for willful infringement of valid patents makes any 
conspiracy to do so ""extraordinarily risky and therefore implausible."" (Mfr. Mot. at 16.) If that view were correct, no plaintiff could 
ever state a claim for conspiracy to infringe a patent, because the penalties for infringement would always render such a claim 
implausible. That view, however, is not correct. While a court may dismiss as implausible a conspiracy claim where the alleged 
conspiracy is ""highly unlikely to succeed,"" Universal Grading Serv. v. eBay, Inc., C-09-2755 RMW, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2325, "
1477,2012," WL 70644, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2012), the Manufacturing Defendants' argument does not address the likelihood of 
success of the FAC's alleged conspiracy. Rather, it denies that anyone would ever be so bold as to risk conspiring. That denial is 
no reason to dismiss Cascades' FAC. "
1480,8," Courts presumptively apply the rule of reason standard except in those cases where the alleged agreement or activity is 
""manifestly anticompetitive"" and lacks ""any redeeming virtue."" Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 
877, 886, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, ""the per se rule is appropriate 
only after courts have had considerable experience with the type of restraint at issue . . . and only if courts can predict with 
confidence  [*46] that it would be invalidated in all or almost all instances under the rule of reason[.]"" Id. at 886-87 (citations 
omitted). Here, Cascades characterizes the alleged conspiracy as a simple price-fixing scheme among direct competitors (e.g., 
FAC ¶ 67; Opp'n at 27-28), though the FAC could be said to allege a group boycott by direct competitors as well (see, e.g., FAC 
¶¶ 39, 100). Normally, either form of restraint is considered per se unreasonable. Leegin, 551 U.S. at 886 (horizontal price-
fixing); NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 135, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998) (competitors' boycott). 
However, the Court believes that this case is not the same type of case in which those categories of per se unreasonable 
restraints were developed. That is because the market here is one for an intellectual property right rather than for a good or a 
service, and a market for intellectual property is, at least arguably, different in kind from the traditional objects of antitrust 
analysis. For example, it is not obvious how the high incidence of patent invalidity should impact economic analysis of a ""market"" 
for patent licenses, considering how often the patents underlying those licenses are revealed as worthless.  [*47] That factor 
alone would appear to make pricing patent licenses an altogether more volatile and risky proposition than pricing known widgets, 
with uncertain impacts on the market for such licenses. A market would only seem to exist for valid patents, but patent validity 
may be difficult to predict. The Court is cognizant that the validity of the '750 Patent is currently at issue in litigation outside this 
District. The economic questions raised by this case are more complex than Cascades has acknowledged. The Court notes the 
Supreme Court's ""reluctan[ce] to adopt per se rules with regard to restraints imposed in the context of business relationships 
where the economic impact of certain practices is not immediately obvious."" Leegin, 551 U.S. at 877 (quoting State Oil Co. v. 
Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 10, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997)). Moreover, per se rules derive from a considered assessment of 
a business practice's demonstrable economic effects, not from empty formal categories. See Bus. Electronics Corp. v. Sharp 
Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 726, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988); Leegin, 551 U.S. at 887. The Court believes this 
case presents non-obvious questions about the economic effect of RPX's business model. Accordingly, the Court  [*48] is 
unwilling to say—at least without further development of the record—that the type of arrangement alleged in the FAC is so 
manifestly anticompetitive, so lacking in redeeming virtues, and so certain to be invalidated under the rule of reason that it may 
confidently be labeled a per se unreasonable restraint. "
1482,9," RPX does not expressly challenge Cascades' pleading of either the ""willful acquisition"" or ""antitrust injury"" prongs. "
1483,10," Manufacturing Defendants argue that the FAC must be dismissed on Noerr-Pennington grounds because the events 
purportedly giving rise to Cascades' antitrust injuries, and therefore its standing to sue, occurred prior to the commencement of 
the Illinois patent litigation—those events being the alleged October 2011 failure of licensing negotiations with RPX and 
Manufacturing Defendants' alleged  [*60] January 2012 refusal to respond to Cascades' individual settlement offers. (Mfr. Reply 
at 13-14.) The Court cannot so find as a matter of law, because the argument rests on the not-yet-established premise that a 
refusal to take a license under Cascades' patents was tantamount to a refusal to settle. "
1484,11," The Court also DENIES AS MOOT Cascades' Motion for Leave to File Notice of Recent Decision (Dkt. No. 118). The decision 
Cascades has lodged, a ruling in the ongoing patent litigation in the Northern District of Illinois declining to dismiss Cascades' 
infringement suit for lack of standing, played no part in the Court's ruling here, which is confined to the sufficiency of the 
pleadings. "
1487,1," The initial complaint filed on April 16 was heavily redacted and Encana sought to file an unredacted complaint under seal. That 
request was denied. (ECF No. 9.)"
1487,2," Plaintiff also filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). (ECF No. 47.) 
That motion has been denied without prejudice as premature as no answer to the counterclaim has been filed. (ECF No. 169.) "
1490,3," Encana's motion and Zarembas' response refers to the paragraphs in the First Amended Counterclaim. The same paragraphs 
appear in the Second Amended Counterclaim, although in different places. Unless otherwise noted, the paragraph references 
here are to the allegations in the Second Amended Counterclaim."
1490,4," The Court accepts the truth of the allegation for purposes of the motion, that a news article was written and that it contained 
these allegations. "

1503,2," Unless otherwise noted, the following allegations are taken from the amended consolidated complaint, see Docket No. 50. For

1521,2, The Court GRANTS Defendants' unopposed Request for Judicial Notice. Docket No. 43; see Fed. R. Evid. 201. 
1526,1," Plaintiffs included such an allegation in their initial complaint, see Compl. ¶¶ 16, 18, but after having been provided with the 
relevant portions of the Publishers' supply contracts, omitted that allegation from the First Amended Complaint. In addition, on 
consent of the parties, the Court has reviewed in camera full copies of the relevant contracts submitted by the Publishers, and "
1527,," has determined that nothing therein requires Amazon to use device-specific DRM or to maintain its e-book platform as a closed 
ecosystem."
1527,2," Plaintiffs' inability to provide a plausible motive for the Publishers to enter into the alleged vertical arrangements with Amazon 
easily distinguishes this case from Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 59 S. Ct. 467, 83 L. Ed. 610 (1939), North 
Texas Specialty Physicians v. FTC, 528 F.3d 346 (5th Cir. 2008), and Laumann v. National Hockey League, 907 F. Supp. 2d 
465 (S.D.N.Y. 2012), on which plaintiffs rely. North Texas Specialty Physicians involved a traditional horizontal price-fixing 
conspiracy, see N. Texas Specialty Physicians, 528 F.3d at 352, and Interstate Circuit and Laumann both involved horizontal 
conspiracies that were facilitated and implemented by additional vertical agreements, see Interstate Circuit, 306 U.S. at 214-21; 
Laumann, 907 F. Supp. 2d at 485-86. Unlike the novel vertical arrangements alleged in the case at bar, all participants  [**14] in 
these horizontal schemes had clear economic motives. In addition, in Laumann, the only of these cases involving a motion to 
dismiss, the plaintiffs provided detailed allegations plausibly suggesting concerted action that far exceed the meager allegations 
present here. See id. at 485-88. "
1528,3," In addition, plaintiffs never explain why it matters that the ABA-Kobo program is indirect, and also never allege that they ever 
sought a direct agreement with the Publishers on reasonable terms. Cf. Paddock Publications, Inc. v. Chicago Tribune Co., 103 
F.3d 42, 47 (7th Cir. 1996) (""[Plaintiff] has never tried to make a better offer, and we conclude that it has come to the wrong 
forum. It should try to outbid the [defendants] in the marketplace, rather than to outmaneuver them in court.""). "

Delaware, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri,

comply with the license requirements 17 U.S.C. § 114, § 115 and/or § 106(1);"
1550,11," . a digital transmission of a music video or user-uploaded video (i.e., a video uploaded to the service by the end-
user) that, in addition to requiring a public license, also requires that the service, in order to offer the music video or 
user-uploaded video on or via the service, obtain a license directly from the owner or administrator of the rights in the 
musical composition(s) embodied therein for rights other than the right of public performance (e.g., synchronization or 
mechanical  [*9] rights) and/or"
1550,111," . a digital transmission made from a digital music file either (a) uploaded by an end-user to the server and/or (b) 
matched from a file on end-user's computed or device to a digital music file on the Service's server (such server, in 
either case, often referred to as either the ""cloud"" or a ""locker""). b. ""New Media Service"" shall mean a standalone service by which New Media Transmissions of musical compositions are 
made available or accessible (i) primarily by means of the Internet, a wireless mobile telecommunications network, and/or 
acomputer network and (ii) to the public, whether or not, in exchange for a subscription feel, other fee or charge; and 
whether or not such offering includes exposure to advertisements before, during and/or after the transmission of such 
compositions . . . . "
1551,3," ""Sony/EMI"" refers to the combined catalogs of Sony and EMI; Sony/ATV became the administrator of BMI's catalog in July 
2012. "
1553,4," The Department of Justice has submitted its views, which deplore the creation of any avoidable inconsistency between this 
decision and the earlier one of the Honorable Denise Cote, U.S.D.J., In re petition of Pandora Media Inc., No. 12 Civ. 8035 
(DLC), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133133 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2013). The inconsistency is just a difference of view of the power of 
the application of Section 106 and the copyright holders'  [*16] rights under the Copyright Law, and will be resolved the Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit or decree amendment procedures, or managed commercially. "

2d 606 (1982)). "
1581,2," ""It would be extraordinarily time-consuming and expensive . . . if each music user (such as a radio station) had to negotiate a 
separate agreement with the holder of the copyright in each work the user wished to perform."" Def. Resp. at 2. Indeed, Plaintiff's 
expert Dr. Peterson testified that a PRO's ability to provide ""one stop"" shopping for desired musical rights reduces the 
transaction costs associated with obtaining rights to perform copyrighted music. Peterson Deck ¶ 9. In other words, using a PRO 
for licensing purposes is more efficient and cost-effective."
1581,3," While RMLC represents around 10,000 radio stations, only 6,500 are ""direct"" members. N.T. 12/9/13 Velez at 23. The 
remaining 3,500 stations are not members, but still have to pay fees for RMLC's operational expenses. Id. at 24. These stations 
are referred to as ""bound"" stations, and must pay fees as a result of a court order that was issued to stop ""freeloading"" by non-
members; that is: non-members receiving the benefits of RMLC despite not paying any of their operational expenses. Id."
1581,4," Prior to 2009, RMLC had never sought permission from radio stations to represent them in negotiations with SESAC. N.T. 
12/9/13 Velez at 26."
1581,5," RMLC's suit is against SESAC, Inc.; SESAC, LLC; and SESAC Holdings, Inc. RMLC and Defendants refer to the defendants 
collectively as ""SESAC,"" this Court shall do the same. "
1582,6," In this context, a ""repertory"" constitutes the PRO'S collection of compositions that fall under the PRO'S representation. N.T. 
12/10/13 Collins Direct at 75. "
1583,7," SESAC offers an ""all talk"" amendment for stations that have a news talk format. This license provides a 75% discount on the 
blanket license fee. 12/9/13 Velez at 60. In contrast to the ASCAP and BMI per-program licenses, stations do not have to report 
the amount of music used. "
1584,8, Mr. Eckert is also the chairman of the Nebraska Broadcaster's Association.
1584,9, Simulcast means that the same programming that is aired on KXPN is also aired on KICS. 
1585,10," Prior to 2009, RMLC had negotiated licensing fees with ASCAP and BMI that also used a fixed fee for blanket licenses. N.T. 
12/10/13 Velez at 45. The RMLC negotiated this fixed fee under the assumption that stations' revenue would continue to grow, 
and thus would pay a lesser percentage of their revenue on licensing fees as revenue grew. Id. at 45. However, when the 
economic recession hit, stations actually saw their revenue fall; thus, they were soon paying a greater percentage of revenue in 
licensing fees. Id. As a result, the RMLC sought and obtained from ASCAP and BMI blanket license fees that are a percentage 
of a PRO'S revenue, so that dollars paid to ASCAP and BMI for licensing fees increase as revenue increases, but decrease as 
revenue decreases. Id. Pursuant to the consent decrees, the rate courts in the Southern District of New York determined the 
appropriate percentage for the new licensing period. Id. at 39. "
1588,11," The facts in this section are relevant in the substantive analysis of Plaintiff's Sherman Act claims. Namely, the facts relate to 
the determination of the relevant market, which is a ""deeply fact-intensive inquiry."" Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 F.3d 191, 199-200 
(2d Cir. 2001). Although the relevant market is a question of fact, I will analyze the correct market in my legal analysis of 
Plaintiff's Section 1 and Section 2 claims. See infra § (III)(A)(1). The testimony of Plaintiff's and Defendants' experts will also be 
further discussed in connection with my analysis of the relevant market. "
1589,12," Admittedly, it is conceivable that there exists, somewhere, some composer who has chosen to eschew all three PROs, and 
direct license their works. However, no evidence of any such an anomaly has been presented."
1589,13," As noted above, SESAC's online search tool expressly disclaims that it is accurate, advises stations that it could change on a 
daily basis, and limits the user to 100 searches per session. N.T. 12/9/13 Velez at 90. N.T. 12/9/13 Eckert at 166. However, we 
also acknowledge that SESAC does give permission to exceed this 100-search limit, on a case-by-case basis. N.T. 12/10/13 
Collins Direct at 101. "
1591,14," As the Honorable Judge Brody explained, this test incorporates both ""reasonable interchangeability"" and ""cross-elasticity of 
demand."" Specifically, as to reasonable interchangeability: If the hypothetical market-wide monopolist could profitably impose a small price increase on all the in-market products 
simultaneously, it must be because consumers are captive; they are not venturing outside the market to make purchases 
when prices in the market go up. This in turn means that those out-of-market products are not reasonably interchangeable 
with the in-market products; otherwise consumers would be buying them instead of [*38]  the in-market products to take 
advantage of the lower price. Babyage.com, 558 F. Supp. 2d at 581. Similarly, as to the test's incorporation of the principle of cross-elasticity of demand: Suppose the hypothetical market-wide monopolist increased the price on only one of the in-market products. Then the 
demand for the rest of the in-market products would increase. After all, they are interchangeable with the now-higher-priced "
1592,," product, and they are now cheaper than that product. This shows that in-market products have high cross-elasticity of 
demand. Id."
1592,15," In practice, a station would only need the direct licenses to works that are ""exclusive"" to SESAC. The copyrights of many 
songs are owned by multiple people, who may each independently license their work, either directly or through the PRO of their 
choosing. N.T. 12/9/13 Velez at 30. Thus, many songs are represented by multiple PROs. Id. A radio station only needs a 
license from one PRO to play such songs. Id. Thus, in practice, a station could substitute a SESAC blanket license with a bundle 
of direct licenses for songs that are ""exclusive"" to SESAC, as licenses from other PROs would be sufficient for the non-exclusive 
songs. The record does not contain any evidence of how a user might determine if a song is ""exclusive"" to SESAC (or to any 
other PRO). Thus, the distinction makes little difference for purposes of our analysis."
1592,16," Dr. Schmalensee did not conduct his own market analysis, and did not offer an opinion as to the relevant market. In this 
regard, I note that both parties initially indicated that they would not introduce expert testimony at the injunction hearing. 
However, RMLC had a change of heart on this point, and included expert opinion from Dr. Peterson in it's Reply Brief. See Pl. 
Reply, Ex. A, ECF NO. 43-1. Not surprisingly, SESAC also had a change of heart, and retained Dr. Schmalensee to rebut Dr. 
Peterson. Dr. Schmalensee was required to prepare a report under extremely strict time constraints. Nevertheless, Dr. 
Schmalensee was deposed, testified at the hearings, and provided an insightful analysis of Dr. Peterson's report. We 
acknowledge that time constraints precluded Dr. Schmalensee from doing little more than critiquing Dr. Peterson's report, and 
we would expect that SESAC will provide additional expert testimony in future proceedings. As the Third Circuit noted, at preliminary stages ""detailed economic analysis ... is seldom before the court and cannot be 
expected."" See Allis-Chalmers, 414 F.2d at 520-21 (quoted case omitted). For present purposes, we consider the full record 
before us, and conclude that RMLC has sufficiently put forward & prima facie case. Of course, this conclusion does not preclude 
a different finding at later stages of this case, after full discovery and careful expert analysis. "
1594,17," As stated by the Third Circuit, a Hub and Spoke conspiracy: involves a hub, generally the dominant purchaser or supplier in the relevant market, and the spokes, made up of the 
distributors involved in the conspiracy. The rim of the wheel is the connecting agreements among the horizontal competitors 
(distributors) that form the spokes. Howard Hess Dental Labs, Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 602 F.3d 237, 255 (3d Cir. 2010)."
1594,18," Defendants' argument that it is not an agreement among ""direct competitors"" is somewhat inconsistent with evidence in the 
record that shows that its affiliates are permitted to directly license their works and have done so in some instances. See N.T. 
12/10/13 Collins Cross at 13."
1594,19," The ""unreasonable restraint on trade"" element is ""analyzed under either the per se standard or the rule of reason standard."" 
Burtch, 662 F.3d at 222. The question of which standard to apply is a question of law for the court. Behrend v. Comcast Corp., "
1595,," No. 03-6604, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51889, at *10 n.l (E.D. Pa. Apr. 12, 2012). Plaintiff argues that the SESAC's conduct is per 
se unlawful. However, the Supreme Court has made clear that the conduct that Plaintiff attacks here (offering only blanket 
licenses at a unilaterally set price) is more appropriately addressed pursuant to the rule of reason. See BMI, 441 U.S. at 19-10; 
see also Meredith Corp, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24517, at *35 (applying Supreme Court's decision in CBS to require ""that 
SESAC's blanket license . . . should be subject to the more discriminatory analysis of the rule of reason""). Ins. Brokerage 
Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300 317 (3d Cir. 2010) (""if ""restraint at issue is sufficient different from the per se archetypes to require 
application of the rule of reason"" the per se theory fails)."
1595,20," I note that the issues presented in the instant motion appear to have a somewhat different focus than past cases asserting 
antitrust challenges against PROs. In past cases, it seems that the plaintiffs' motivation in obtaining licenses was to have the 
right to play music. See BMI, 441 U.S. at 22. In comparison (and at least as presently cast), the current case seems focused on 
the stations' desire to obtain a SESAC blanket license to avoid copyright infringement. See e.g. Souza Dep. at 114.."
1595,21," Plaintiff argues that a radio station has little incentive to obtain direct licenses because they would still need a blanket license, 
and thus would be double paying for any work they directly licensed. The Second Circuit rejected a similar argument in Buffalo 
Broadcasting because stations could avoid double payment by foregoing a blanket license. 744 F.2d at 929. However, in this 
case, where the focus is more on obtaining rights sufficient to ensure compliance with the copyright laws (as opposed to 
obtaining rights merely to fulfill music playing needs), stations cannot forego a blanket license, because they cannot fully control 
the music they play, and cannot discern the full library of songs for which they need to obtain direct licenses. "
1596,22," Neither party has stated what a ""competitive price"" for a SESAC blanket license might be. However, both experts agreed with 
the economic principle that a seller with 100% market power would price its product above the competitive level in the absence 
of any restrictions on pricing. See N.T. 12/9/13 Peterson at 48-49. Because of the inability of either party to conduct a more 
searching analysis on the issue due to the expedited nature of discovery, this Court will accept this principle for purposes of this 
motion. However, I reiterate that this is a factually complex case and the current record is limited; the ultimate merits will be 
determined at the appropriate stage of proceedings. See Allis-Chalmers, 414 F.2d at 511. "
1597,23," If direct evidence of monopoly power is present then defining the relevant market is not needed. Broadcom Corp. 501 F.3d at 
307 n.3. "
1598,24," SESAC's auditing power derives from the terms of the current licensing agreement. If this Court were to grant the requested 
relief, and maintain the status quo by enjoining the increase of rates in the 2014 rate card, it would not have any effect on the 
other (non-price) terms of the licensing agreement, such as the ability to conduct audits."
1598,25," We cannot overlook the fact that Plaintiff waited almost a year after filing of the Complaint to file the instant motion, despite the 
fact that SESAC has always been entitled to unilaterally conduct an audit (which may result in additional fees). This delay 
weighs heavily against a finding of irreparable harm, See Lanin v. Borough of Tenafly, 515 Fed. Appx. 114, 117-18 (3d Cir. 
2013) (non-precedential) (district court properly relied on delay in filing preliminary injunction motion as proof that risk of 
irreparable harm did not exist). Moreover, the delay further highlights that the ""harm"" targeted by this motion is the upcoming 
rate increase, not SESAC's auditing power, and/or the uncertainty it may cause. "
1599,27," Plaintiff also argues that their overwhelming showing of success on the merits lessens the burden of demonstrating irreparable 
harm. To begin, the Third Circuit has not adopted the ""sliding scale"" approach to injunction standards. In this Circuit, irreparable 
harm must always be present for an injunction to issue. See Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sec'y of United States HHS, 
No. 13-1144, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 2706, at *6 (3d Cir. Feb. 7, 2013) (noting that the Third Circuit has not embraced the ""sliding 
scale"" in issuing injunctions, and examining whether plaintiff has met their burden as to each element). Additionally, although I conclude - based on the current record - that Plaintiff has established a likelihood of success, this 
showing certainly was not ""overwhelming."" Indeed, this is a complex case and the current record is far from comprehensive; 
discovery was expedited and Defendants' expert was retained with little time in which to offer an opinion on critical matters such 
as the relevant market. Regardless, it is well settled that the failure to establish irreparable harm precludes injunctive relief; 
Plaintiff's showing of likelihood of success cannot cure the absence of irreparable harm. See McKeesport Hosp., 24 F.3d at 523."
1599,28," Because of the failure to establish irreparable harm, the final two factors (balance of harms and public interest) need not be 
addressed. See AT&T v. Winback & Conserve Program, 42 F.3d 1421, 1427 n.8 (3d Cir. 1994) (noting that ""[the] latter two 
factors should be taken into account only when they are relevant""). "

1602,4," For the purposes of this order, the court must assume that all of McCormick's factual allegations are true. Morgan v. Church's 
Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir.1987). "
1604,5," Defendants Inland Waters and Inland/Xcel argue separately that McCormick's action against them is barred because 
McCormick agreed to a two-year period of limitations in two subcontractor agreements (CS-1368 and DWS 876/77). McCormick 
denies that either agreement produced by the Inland Defendants pertains to this action, and it represents that the alleged activity 
in its First Amended Complaint took place prior to June 1, 2006. Because it is unclear whether either agreement pertains to the 
instant case, the court declines to decide the issue. "
1606,6," McCormick argues that unlike the plaintiff in Gatt, McCormick was never a member of the fraudulent scheme. However, the 
Gatt court expressly declined to consider whether the equitable doctrine of in pari delicto barred Gatt's claims, and did not rely in 
substantial part on Gatt's involvement in the conspiracy in determining that it lacked antitrust standing. See Gatt, 711 F.3d 80-81. "
1607,7," The court notes that McCormick alleges that it performed ""isolated work"" on CS-1368 on an ""emergency[-]needs"" basis. Id. at 
347. "
1613,1," We only consider the theories of refusal to deal and predatory pricing. We do not address monopoly leveraging. See Law 
Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, L.L.P. v. Bell Atl. Corp., 305 F.3d 89, 108 (2d Cir. 2002), rev'd, Verizon Commc'ns Inc. v. Law Offices 
of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S 398, 415 n.4, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004). Counsel stated at oral argument that 
MiniFrame did not present that theory to us or to the District Court. Oral Arg. Tr. at 9:7 (""We didn't argue monopoly leveraging.""). Similarly, we do not consider bundled discounting, which was also not presented to us. See Cascade Health Solutions v. 
PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883 (9th Cir. 2008); LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc). Nor do we consider tying under Section 1 of the Sherman Act or price discrimination under Section 2(a) of the Clayton Act as 
amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). MiniFrame's complaint did not set forth claims under those statutes."
1613,2," ""MiniFrame does not appeal from the dismissal of what was Count X,"" an unfair competition claim. See Appellant's Br. at 16 n.5 
(incorrectly describing Count X as an unjust enrichment claim). "
1616,1," The court has also certified two subclasses, consisting of those dairy farmers ""who are members of DFA or otherwise sell milk 
through DMS ('DFA/DMS subclass')"" and those dairy farmers ""who are not members of DFA and do not otherwise sell milk 
through DMS ('non-DFA/DMS subclass')."" Subclass plaintiffs also oppose Defendants' motion. "
1617,2," In initially denying class certification, the court confronted a similar issue, observing that: [A]lthough Plaintiffs concede that their expert focused on the wrong component of price, erroneously opined that the impact 
of the alleged conspiracy would be found in the component pricing, and disclaimed any significant  [*12] impact of the 
conspiracy on premiums paid to farmers, Dr. Rausser has repeatedly stated that he has not abandoned the opinions he 
articulated in his Initial Declaration. Accordingly, Plaintiffs and their expert either have a significant difference of opinion 
regarding critical components of Plaintiffs' theory of common adverse impact or the court must rely on Dr. Rausser's 
fundamentally flawed Initial Declaration. If there is a third alternative, Plaintiffs have not identified it. Allen v. Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc., 279 F.R.D. 257, 269-70 (D. Vt. 2011) (internal citation omitted). "
1620,3," Plaintiffs claim that Dr. Rausser originally conducted a SSNIP test with the supply of milk imported into Order 1, but did not 
include it in his Initial Report. See Doc. 458 at 8 (""Dr. Rausser conducted (but did not include in his initial report) a SSNIP 
analysis of imported milk[.]""). If this is true, it did not make its way into Dr. Rausser's Rebuttal Report which contains an entirely 
different SSNIP analysis. "
1621,4," Dr. Rausser relied on the elasticities analyzed and published in: Adesojio Adelaja, Price Changes, Supply Elasticities, Industry 
Organization, and Dairy Output Distribution, 73 Am. J. of Ag. Econ. No. 1 (Feb. 1991); and J.P. Chavas  [*27] et al., A Regional 
Analysis of Milk Supply Response in the United States, 12 N. Central J. of Ag. Econ. No. 2 (July 1990)."
1621,5," Dr. Rausser's Initial Report indicates that 14.1%, 30.4%, 66.5%, and 53.7% of the milk produced by Order 1 farmers would 
benefit economically by leaving in favor of Order 33 in the years 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2009 respectively. (Doc. 372-7 at 12; 
7/22/11 Rausser Initial Report, Ex. 11.) "
1622,6," Defendants have clarified that ""the issue is not whether  [*33] Plaintiffs . . . or Dr. Rausser have evidence or opinions regarding 
participation in the conspiracy by DFA, DMS or Dean. It is Dr. Rausser's views as to the other alleged co-conspirators that [are] 
the object of the Motion."" (Doc. 405 at 13.) "
1626,7," Dr. Rausser has suggested that a Boston reference zone may also be used to measure the capacity of milk plants by location 
adjustment. This approach appears to be tainted by the same bias  [*47] as his use of the Boston base blend price. "
1627,8," Defendants note that this court previously criticized Dr. Rausser's proposed damages model for failing to account for ""the return 
on investment some dairy farmers  [*53] may experience through joining cooperatives that own their own processing plants and 
return profits to their members based upon processing activities."" Allen v. Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc., 279 F.R.D. 257, 270 (D. 
Vt. 2011). According to Defendants, in some instances, cooperatives made patronage payments that exceeded the amount of 
Dr. Rausser's claimed damages. This court, however, previously found that the failure of Dr. Rausser's regression model to 
reflect the payments for vertically integrated cooperatives ""does not . . . render Dr. Rausser's regression model unusable."" Allen 
v. Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc., 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 164718, 2012 WL 5844871, at *15 (D. Vt. Nov. 19, 2012). "
1628,9," Post-hearing, Defendants submitted the opinion in In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 725 F.3d 244, 406 U.S. 
App. D.C. 371 (D.C. Cir. 2013), in which the D.C. Circuit vacated the district court's class certification  [*55] decision, and 
directed the district court on remand to take a ""hard look"" at Dr. Rausser's damages model because it ""purport[ed] to quantify the 
injury in fact to all class members"" but the model also yielded ""similar results"" for certain legacy shippers that were clearly not 
impacted by the conspiracy. Id. at 252-55. The D.C. Circuit concluded that Dr. Rausser's regression model generated ""false 
positives"" and ""detect[ed] injury where none could exist."" Id. While recent criticism of this magnitude is concerning, in that case, 
the D.C. Circuit could identify a group of shippers that were indisputably unaffected by the conspiracy, and apply the regression 
model to them. Here, the task is considerably more complex, and the court cannot as easily conclude that Dr. Rausser's 
regression model fails to produce reliable results. "
1632,1," This order relies in part on the representations of counsel at the hearing on November 15, 2013. See MANUAL FOR COMPLEX

] ""A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form 
of an opinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to 
understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is 
the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of 
the case."" Fed. R. Evid. 702. "
1659,3," ""A market is defined as a product or group of products and a geographic area in which it is produced or sold such that a 
hypothetical profit-maximizing firm, not subject to price regulation, that was the only present and future producer or seller of 
those products in that area would likely impose at least a 'small but significant nontransitory' increase in price, assuming the 
terms of sale of all other products are held constant."" Merger Guidelines § 1.0. "
1660,4," It is unclear whether Froeb's statement applies to the geographic market created for the monopoly claims in Counts 3 and 4, 
the conspiracy claim in Count 2, or both. "
1661,5," Orders 5 and 7 cover all or part of fourteen states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Plaintiff Fidel Breto has one store 
located in Tennessee, and Food Lion has 1,300 stores in 11 states: Delaware,  [**37] Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, 
North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The states in Orders 5 and 7 in which 
Plaintiffs are located are as follows: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West 
Virginia."
1661,6, Price elasticity is noted as a foundational element in Froeb's definition of a geographic market. 
1662,7," With regard to Plaintiffs' locations, Froeb graphs Orders 5 and 7, including many locales lacking any stores owned by Plaintiffs, 
and makes the following assumption: Customers locate  [**44] stores near population centers and locate distribution centers to minimize the cost of distribution to 
stores. In the model, customer locations are represented by a grid of 119 evenly-spaced customer locations within Order 
Nos. 5 and 7. The total measure of demand at each location is proportional to the census population nearest that point. [Id. at 32 n.60.] Froeb's reason for doing this rather than mapping Plaintiffs' locations is unclear, but his more extensive (and, 
albeit, hypothetical) rendering may be reliable under the principle that the greater includes the lesser. Froeb's model includes the 
actual locations of Defendants' (sellers) processing plants and, arguably at least, the practicable alternatives for Plaintiffs 
(buyers). His inclusion of additional (perhaps superfluous) buyers does not undermine his conclusion that prices could be 
manipulated. It should not be inferred that we are opining on the correctness of Froeb's conclusions, we merely note that his 
method harmonizes with the Tampa Electric standard. "
1663,8," ""The model specifically considers (1) the locations of plants and customers, (2) the elasticity of demand for milk, determined by 
parameters that measure both demand  [**45] and cost characteristics of the milk industry, and (3) the costs of transporting 
bottled milk."" [R. 1159-5 at 31.]"

1663,10," Plaintiffs urge us to hold that the district court erred when it relied on Froeb's deposition testimony more heavily than the 
contents of his expert report. Traveling down that line of argument is unnecessary. Simply reiterating a long-standing and 
unremarkable principle is sufficient: the law establishes burdens of persuasion, and parties must bear those burdens. Clear 
deposition testimony that contradicts one's own expert report may make bearing that burden  [**46] more difficult, and that 
challenge may grow more daunting when the testimony and report are related to a difficult legal issue. Ultimately, we trust that 
courts vigorously endeavor to rule properly by reviewing the evidence put before them. The onus is on the parties to advocate 
clearly. "
1664,11," In the context of reviewing a magistrate judge's decision as to a dispositive motion and after a party's objection, three other 
courts of appeal have held that a presumption should exist that a district court properly reviewed the motion. United States v. 
Hamell, 931 F.2d 466, 468 (8th Cir. 1991) (explaining that unless contrary evidence  [**49] is presented, the appellate court 
should assume a district court engaged in appropriate review); Brunig v. Clark, 560 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir. 2009) (""[W]e will not 
assume that the district court did not conduct the proper review.""); Garcia v. City of Albuquerque, 232 F.3d 760, 766 (10th Cir. 
2000) (""[N]either 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) nor Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b) requires the district court to make any specific findings; the 
district court must merely conduct a de novo review of the record."")."
1664,12, The entire quote reads as follows: 
1665,," As I understand it, I have been asked to analyze whether in fact the creation of NDH and the assertion that there would be 
economies of size and lower prices through efficiencies generated by that creation from January 1, 2002 going forward, 
whether that in fact was true or not, and whether in fact there is a reliable economic model of collusion rather than 
independent self-interest that says, yes, they did engage in actions that in fact are consistent only with collusive decisions 
by Dean, DFA, and NDH, and that decisions resulted in elevated prices to  [**53] the plaintiffs in this case. Now, that was a hypothesis, sir. First of all, there is a story that can be told that supports the defendants—or the plaintiffs. There is a story. There is a 
hypothesis that supports them. There is a counter-hypothesis, that is what Dean and Suiza represented to Justice, which in fact there [are] economies of 
size, there [are] efficiencies, we are going to pass those on and the plaintiffs in this case are going to enjoy the lower prices. 
That is what we looked at. Cotterill Depo. at 17-18. "
1668,1," For simplicity, the Court refers to the plaintiffs as one entity; House of Brides therefore takes the singular form throughout the 
opinion. "
1671,2," Furthermore, to the extent that Alfred Angelo owns its own retail stores, it cannot be said to have conspired horizontally with 
those stores in its role as a manufacturer. See Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 777, 104 S. Ct. 
2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984) (holding that ""conspiracy""  [*16] does not cover an agreement between a wholly owned subsidiary 
and its parent because the two have a ""complete unity of interest""). "
1673,3," It bears noting that the Supreme Court has touted the potential competitive benefits of vertical agreements to maintain 
minimum resale prices, stating that the practice ""can stimulate interbrand competition—the competition among manufacturers 
selling different brands of the same type of product—by reducing intrabrand competition—the competition among retailers selling 
the same brand."" Leegin, 551 U.S. at 890. ""[E]very one of the potentially anticompetitive outcomes of vertical arrangements 
depends on the uniformity of the practice."" Frank H. Easterbrook, Vertical Arrangements and the Rule of Reason, 53 Antitrust 
L.J. 135, 162 (1984). So, while it is not necessary in this case to decide whether the alleged agreements were plausibly 
unreasonable because House of Brides has not successfully alleged a relevant product market,  [*25] precedent and prevailing 
economic theory indicate that the practice of setting minimum resale prices is not, in fact, as ""shocking"" as House of Brides 
claims it to be. Am. Compl. ¶ 45. "
