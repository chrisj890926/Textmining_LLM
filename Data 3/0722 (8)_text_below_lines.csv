22,1," Plaintiffs originally named the TMB and fourteen of its members in both their individual and official capacities. The parties 
thereafter stipulated to the dismissal of the TMB and its members in their individual capacities, based on the parties' agreement 
that full relief could be obtained against the TMB's members in their official capacities. For convenience's sake, the Court refers 
herein to the members of the TMB collectively as ""the TMB."" "
23,2," According to Teladoc, its physicians do not prescribe ""DEA-controlled substances (including narcotics) or what are referred to 
as lifestyle drugs (i.e., Viagra, [*6]  or diet pills)."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 82). "
25,3," The TMB further suggests prior lack of standing is insufficient to prevent the application of limitations. No authority is cited for 
that proposition, however. Moreover, Dr. Hood lacked standing to attack the rules governing the practice of medicine in Texas 
prior to his licensure because he had not suffered any injury prior to that date. The TMB provides no explanation as to how his 
ability to seek relief for his alleged injury could have expired prior to his suffering the injury. "
26,4," In opposing Plaintiffs' application for a preliminary injunction the TMB declined to assert any immunity defenses. Accordingly 
this issue is addressed for the first time herein. "
31,5," In addition, the Court notes that, even if the theories are contradictory, a litigant is permitted to offer alternative theories of 
liability."
31,6," It is worth noting that the Fifth Circuit has characterized ""the jurisprudence in the area of the dormant Commerce Clause [as], 
quite simply, a mess,"" based on the Supreme Court's admitted failure to ""produce a readily discernable standard for 
distinguishing between statutes that have discriminatory effects and those that merely create incidental burdens."" Churchill 
Downs Inc. v. Trout, 589 F. App'x 233, 235 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing GMC v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 298 n.12, 117 S. Ct. 811, 136 L. 
Ed. 2d 761 (1997)). "
34,1," The parties stipulated [*2]  in their Joint Stipulated Facts that ""no facts other than the facts contained [in the Stipulated Facts] 
may be submitted or referenced in support of or in opposition to any motion for summary judgment."" Stip. Facts 2:3-5. Defendant 
concedes in its Statement of Genuine Disputes in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [60] (""Statement of 
Disputes"") that ""all facts submitted in [Plaintiff's] Statement of Uncontroverted Facts were stipulated to by"" Plaintiff and 
Defendant. Def.'s Statement Disputes 1:25-2: 1. Given this concession and the language of the parties Joint Stipulated Facts 
[43] that the parties ""jointly stipulate to the following facts,"" the Court finds that each of the facts contained in the Stipulated Facts 
is undisputed. "
35,2, The parties filed the CPA Contract under seal [56]. 
36,3," For example, the ""Eligible Vehicles"" provision states: ""Vehicles must be registered solely in the United States and must be 
operated in the United States."" Stip. Facts P 14a (citing CPA Contract, p. 4)."
36,4," The CPA Contract also provides for the possibility of fleet incentive chargebacks if the ""In-Service Requirements"" are violated. 
 [*8] See CPA Contract, p. 4. "
38,5," The parties stipulated that ""no facts other than the facts contained [in the Joint Stipulated Facts] may be submitted or 
referenced in support of or in opposition to any motion for summary judgment."" Stip. Facts 2:3-5. The Stipulated Facts makeno 
mention of Defendant's affirmative defense. Only paragraphs 15 and 23 are relevant to the affirmative defense. These 
paragraphs state, in relevant part: ""Ford personnel told Mr. Catoire that, pursuant to the 'In-Service Requirements,' vehicles 
purchased pursuant to the CPA Contract had to be operated in the United States, and Mr. Catoire understood that [*15]  this 
meant the vehicles could not be exported,"" and ""Except for the export prohibition, [Defendant] agrees that the CPA Contract is a 
legally binding and valid contract."" Stip. Facts PP 15, 23. "
42,1," The proposed second amended complaint alleged Bailey [*6]  stopped paying assessments in February 2010 and died in 
March 2011. It further alleged the Unit 8 assessments were $14,000 in arrears as of April 2014. As discussed below, the second 
amended complaint was never filed."
42,2," The court's full explanation was as follows: ""Well, I read the declaration of the banker expert, if you will. I'm not in a position to 
advance that motion to today and grant the motion to amend [*7]  to allege that cause of action. I mean, I looked at it and I 
thought about it, and personally I thought it might be, perhaps, a good way for the plaintiff to go, but I wasn't sure. And I 
understand the plaintiff's position. They're sitting there, they're not getting their money, and they want it. And I—I just can't, in my 
own mind, come up with some legal theory as to how they are going to get it. [¶] . . . [¶] . . . You go ahead and come in here on 
July 28, and you can argue what you want to us at that time."" "
43,3," We deny the Association's motion for judicial notice. The documents attached as Exhibits A through C of the motion are already 
in the appellate record, and the document attached as Exhibit D postdates the judgment and is not necessary [*10]  for our 
determination of the issues on appeal. "
45,4," The Association's reliance on In re Spa at Sunset Isles Condo. Ass'n, Inc. (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2011) 454 B.R. 898, is misplaced. 
There, the bankruptcy court held federal bankruptcy law preempted Florida's statute relieving lenders of liability for homeowners 
association assessments prior to foreclosure. (Id. at pp. 905-906.) No bankruptcy preemption issues apply here. Moreover, the 
bankruptcy code at issue required only that the association's expenditures benefit the lender; there was no requirement, as there 
is under California law, that the lender's retention of the benefit be unjust. (Id. at p. 908.)"
45,5," (Unif. Common Interest Ownership Act of 1982, § 3-116 (amended 2008), 7 pt. II, U.L.A. 374.) "
49,1," AEIS was originally a joint-venture between Maritz and American Express. (Dkt. 1 at ¶ 17) In February of 2010, Maritz 
purchased the minority shares held by American Express in AEIS. (Id. at ¶ 18) After becoming the 100% owner of AEIS, Maritz 
changed the name from AEIS to Intelispend. (Id.) "
51,2," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981. "
52,3," The Court has considered the arguments raised in Bray's Motion, specifically that he was not given an opportunity to file a 
response to the motion requesting extension prior to the Court's ruling. The Court granted the extension of deadlines due to the 
nature of the dispute raised in the motion to transfer. Had the Court awaited Bray's response, its ruling would have been the 
same. Therefore, the Court did not require a response prior to ruling on the motion requesting extension. If the Missouri Court 
declines to accept transfer, Bray will have an opportunity to weigh-in on the setting of case management deadlines in this case. "
56,1," To be more precise, the current iteration of Killian's complaint alleges only 36 individual markets, because Killian's lawyers 
forgot to include the Fresno metropolitan statistical area. However, Killian's lawyers have made clear that this was an inadvertent 
omission, and Killian will not be penalized for this. Killian will be permitted to amend the operative complaint to cure this 
omission. For the sake of efficiency, this discussion assumes that Killian has actually alleged all 37 of the markets it intended to 
allege, because that will be the case once Killian's lawyers fix the mistake. "
57,2," The SAC alleges that although HomeTeam purported to leave the Bakersfield market in 2014 (in an attempt to encourage 
Killian to settle prior state-court litigation between the parties), it merely handed its operations over to Orkin, a company owned 
by HomeTeam's parent company, Rollins. Even if HomeTeam has truly exited the Bakersfield market, its allegedly monopolistic 
conduct before its exit is still a proper basis for an antitrust claim for damages, and also likely does not moot Killian's prayer for 
injunctive relief with respect to that market, given the SAC's allegation that HomeTeam left the market despite that it was 
profitable and could easily return to the same improper tactics as before. See, e.g., United States v. Concentrated Phosphate 
Exp. Ass'n, 393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968) (noting, in an antitrust case, that ""[m]ere voluntary 
cessation of allegedly illegal conduct does not moot a case; if it did, the courts would be compelled to leave '[t]he defendant . . . 
free to return to his old ways.'"" (quoting United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S. Ct. 894, 97 L. Ed. 1303 
(1953) (alterations original)). In any case, Killian also alleges HomeTeam continues to engage in monopolistic conduct in the 
Fresno market. "
62,1, It would not bar SolarCity's remaining state law tort claims.
62,2," The District presents no additional arguments on the merits of its state-action immunity defense. Instead, it only takes issue 
with the [*8]  Court's finding that whether Arizona has a clearly expressed and articulated policy displacing competition in the 
retail electricity market was a question of fact. "
64,3," Although refined in Hall, the doctrine originated in Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway, Co., 260 U.S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 
67 L. Ed. 183 (1922), and has been criticized and narrowed by the Ninth Circuit in Cost Management, 99 F.3d at 943-48. "
65,4," If, for instance, SolarCity filed suit challenging the rates for electricity set by the ACC, the doctrine would apply and bar the suit. 
See Hall, 453 U.S. at 584"
65,5," The District argues that its Board approved the prices, and thus they are entitled to deference. But the District cannot self-
police its own rates, especially given the Board is elected by its ""shareholders,"" much like a for-profit corporation. (Doc. [*16]  39, 
PP 24, 25)."
65,6," The cases cited by the District in support of immediate appeal are not Ninth Circuit authority, and each case dealt with a trial 
court's denial of an immunity at the summary judgment stage, not the 12(b) stage. See Commuter Transp. Sys., Inc. v. 
Hillsborough Cty. Aviation Auth., 801 F.2d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir. 1986) (finding district court's order denying summary judgment 
on state-action immunity grounds a final appealable decision); Tucson Unified Sch. Dist. v. Borek, 234 Ariz. 364, 322 P.3d 181, 
184 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2014) (accepting special action jurisdiction of trial court order denying [*18]  summary judgment on absolute 
immunity under A.R.S. § 12-820.01); Pinal Cty. v. Cooper, 360 P.3d 142, 2015 WL 6157397, at *2 (Ariz. Ct. App., 2015) 
(allowing appeal of immunity claims denied on motion for summary judgment)."
65,7," The Court has serious doubts as to whether the two immunity issues are immediately appealable. ""Federal appellate 
jurisdiction is generally limited to review of 'final decisions of the district courts of the United States.'"" DC Comics v. Pac. Pictures 
Corp., 706 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir. 2013) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1291)). The Court did not make a final decision on the state-
action doctrine or absolute immunity under Arizona law. The District is free to raise these immunities at summary judgment. "

United States Supreme Court's abrogation of the ""no set of facts"" standard for determining the adequacy of a pleading in Bell 
Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, a Sherman Act case: We have often stated that a claim should not be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) unless the plaintiff would not be entitled to 
relief under any set of facts or any possible theory he may prove consistent with the allegations in the complaint. See, e.g., 
Martin K. Eby Constr., 369 F.3d at 467 (quoting Jones, 188 F.3d at 324). This standard derived from Conley v. Gibson, 
which stated that ""a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the 
plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2

75,63," Id. Iqbal illustrated its analysis of the first prong as follows: We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the complaint that are not entitled to the assumption of truth. 
Respondent pleads that petitioners ""knew of, condoned, and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject [him]"" to harsh 
conditions of confinement ""as a matter of policy, solely on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no 
legitimate penological interest."" [*16]  Complaint ¶ 96, App. to Pet. for Cert. 173a-174a. The complaint alleges that Ashcroft 
was the ""principal architect"" of this invidious policy, id., ¶ 10, at 157a, and that Mueller was ""instrumental"" in adopting and 
executing it, id., ¶ 11, at 157a. These bare assertions, much like the pleading of conspiracy in Twombly, amount to nothing 
more than a ""formulaic recitation of the elements"" of a constitutional discrimination claim, 550 U.S., at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 
namely, that petitioners adopted a policy ""'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable 
group."" Feeney, 442 U.S., at 279, 99 S.Ct. 2282. As such, the allegations are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed 
true. Twombly, supra, 550 U.S., at 554-555, 127 S.Ct. 1955. To be clear, we do not reject these bald allegations on the 
ground that they are unrealistic or nonsensical. We do not so characterize them any more than the Court in Twombly 
rejected the plaintiffs' express allegation of a ""'contract, combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry,'"" id., at 551, 
127 S.Ct. 1955, because it thought that claim too chimerical to be maintained. It is the conclusory nature of respondent's 
allegations, rather than their extravagantly fanciful nature, that disentitles them to the presumption of truth. Id. at 680-81, 129 S. Ct. at 1951."

(""Colon-Grau"") in his personal and official capacity as an External Advisor; and Lorena Diaz-Trancon (""Diaz-Trancon"") in her 
personal and official capacity as a Type VII Internal Medical Council of CFSE."
114,2," For purposes of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, all facts in Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, Docket No. 28, are presumed to be 
true. "
116,3," Even though Plaintiffs have sued CFSE officials in both their personal and individual capacity in addition to the CFSE, Plaintiffs 
are suing them based on their conduct as CFSE officials. Plaintiffs cannot circumvent the doctrine of Parker immunity by simply 
suing the state agency officials that engaged in the challenged activity, rather than the state agency itself. See Fisichelli v. City 
Known as Town of Methuen, 956 F.2d 12, 15-16 (1st Cir. 1992). Accordingly, Plaintiffs' claims against the individual Defendants 
are also dismissed."
116,4," The Parker state-action immunity doctrine should not be confused [*11]  with the state-action doctrine under the Fourteenth 
Amendment. They are two completely different doctrines. "
118,5," Plaintiffs refute the CFSE's judgment concerning the medical efficacy of chiropractic treatment. Docket No. 28. However, 
whether the CFSE's judgments are correct or medically sound is irrelevant. It is not for this Court to determine whether 
chiropractic services are an effective treatment for Puerto Rican injured workers' back injuries. The critical inquiry is whether the 
Puerto Rico legislature [*16]  has authorized the CFSE to make those judgments — which it has. "
120,6," Plaintiffs' complaint also fails to allege that any of the BOD's members are active market participants that compete with 
chiropractors."
120,7," Plaintiffs argue that the CFSE is controlled by active market participants because four out of the seven members of the CFSE's 
Industrial Medical Council (""IMC"") are medical doctors. Docket No. 84 at 6. However, Plaintiffs' argument is based on Plaintiffs' 
incorrect statement that the IMC is part of the governing BOD of the CFSE. Id. Had Plaintiffs read the Worker's Compensation 
Act, they would have realized that the IMC is a separate body from the BOD. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11 §§ 1b-2, 1c. The BOD is 
the only governing body with decision making authority in the CFSE. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11 § 1b-2. Any action taken by the IMC 
must first be submitted to the BOD for ratification. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 11 § 1c. Therefore, the fact that four IMC members are 
medical doctors does not warrant the conclusion that the CFSE is controlled by active market participants."
120,8," Plaintiffs referred to the IMC [*24]  members as decision makers. However, the Court has already pointed out that Plaintiffs 
were incorrect in deeming IMC members the decision makers of the CFSE. See supra note 7. "
123,1," Internet traffic is in Internet Protocol format, while telephone traffic is in Time Division Multiplexing format."
123,2," Although the monopoly system was referred to as the ""Bell System,"" the company's name was American Telephone and 
Telegraph Company, and its corporate descendant is today known as ""AT&T."" "
125,3," This opinion will treat ""basic services"" as a synonym for ""telecommunications services"" and ""enhanced services"" as equivalent 
to ""information services,"" even though the terms have slightly different meanings. See Huber, Federal Telecommunications, at

131,1," United Credit Recovery, LLC (""UCR"") [*2]  was served with the Amended Complaint on April 7, 2015. [Docket No. 29]. Leonard 
Potillo was served on April 9, 2015. [Docket No. 31]. Wilbur Tate, III was served on April 6, 2015, and has never answered. 
[Docket No. 33]. UCR and Potillo received an extension of time to answer. [Docket Nos. 44, 48]. Potillo answered the Amended 
Complaint on June 8, 2015. [Docket No. 65]. UCR filed a pro se answer on June 8, 2015. [Docket No. 66]. On June 10, 2015, 
this Court issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that UCR's answer be stricken because a corporation cannot 
appear pro se in this district. [Docket No. 67]. The District Court adopted this Report and Recommendation and struck UCR's 
answer. [Docket No. 86]. On June 18, 2015, Potillo moved to stay the lawsuit because he was being held without bond at the 
Orange County, Florida correctional facility and lacked financial and legal resources to participate in the lawsuit. [Docket No. 69]. 
U.S. Bank and TMT opposed the motion. [Docket Nos. 74, 81]. This Court denied Potillo's motion on July 6, 2015. [Docket No. 
82]. As a result, UCR and Tate have not answered the Amended Complaint, nor did they respond to the instant motion. U.S. 
Bank [*3]  moved to stay discovery pending the outcome of the instant motion to dismiss. [Docket No. 75]. This Court granted 
the motion. [Docket No. 88]. "
132,2," The Eleventh Circuit has described forward flow agreements in this context as follows: When a consumer is delinquent on a credit account, the company that provided the account begins by trying to collect the 
debt itself. After 180 days, however, the company normally sells the debt to a wholesale purchaser. Most sales of debt 
occur in large pools. Some of these pools are sold at auction. Others are sold pursuant to long-term contracts with large 
purchasers, so-called ""forward-flow contracts."" Forward-flow contracts are attractive to the seller because they provide a 
consistent and reliable way to get rid of debt. They are attractive to the wholesaler because they provide a reliable supply 
and also typically guarantee that the accounts are a representative sample of the company's debt pool and that none of the 
debtors are deceased or bankrupt. S.E.C. v. Merch. Capital, LLC, 483 F.3d 747, 750 (11th Cir. 2007). "
133,3," This statement is very confusing, because in paragraph 58 of the Amended Complaint TMT stated that it had raised, not 
lowered, its bid based on information from U.S. Bank's Outsourcing Manager, Vince Lorenzo. Perhaps, TMT is referencing its 
earlier bid of $0.055. Amended Complaint, ¶ 51. "
135,4," TMT did not respond to U.S. Bank's argument in support of dismissing Count Ten. See TMT's Brief in Opposition to Motion to 
Dismiss (""TMT's Mem."") [Docket No. 63]. As a result, it waived its objections. Njema v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 124 F. Supp. 3d 
852, Civ. No. 13-519 (PJS/JSM), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108758, 2015 WL 5008940, at *12 (D. Minn. Aug. 18, 2015) (failing to 
respond to defendant's statements in a motion for summary judgment regarding damages resulted in waiver of plaintiff's 
argument on that point) (citing Salaimeh v. Messerli & Kramer, P.A., Civ. No. 13-3201 (DSD/HB), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165386, 
2014 WL 6684970, at *2, n. 2 (D. Minn. Nov. 25, 2014) (noting that plaintiff did not address certain issues raised by defendant in 
her opposition to summary judgment and stating ""[a]lthough this court considers those claims, it notes that they have been 
effectively waived."") (citing Satcher v. University of Ark. at Pine Bluff Bd. Of Trs., 558 F.3d 731, 735 (8th Cir. 2009) (""[F]ailure to 
oppose a basis for summary judgment constitutes waiver of that argument."")). At any rate, TMT agreed at the motion to dismiss 
hearing that this Court could recommend dismissal of Count Ten. As a result, the Court will not address Count Ten further [*21]  
in this Report and Recommendation except to recommend its dismissal with prejudice (the relief sought by U.S Bank and not 
opposed by TMT) to the District Court. "
136,5," The parties' arguments in favor of and opposing dismissal of the federal claims are considered in more detail, infra. "
137,6," For the reasons described infra, the Court will not consider this exhibit. U.S. Bank stated that it was not offering the document 
in support of its motion and then did exactly that. U.S. Bank Mem., pp. 30-31. The Court also did not consider Exhibit F to the 
Poley Affidavit, which U.S. Bank stated it was submitting ""for purposes of illustration only"" and then relied on the exhibit to show 
that TMT's statement that it never received any offering materials regarding [*26]  the March, 2012 DDA Portfolio was ""patently 
false."" Id., p. 32, n.18. "
138,7, These facts were not pled in the Amended Complaint.
138,8," In Bledsoe, the Eighth Circuit described the requirement for an ascertainable structure distinct from the pattern of racketeering 
activity in terms of criminal enterprises, such as a Mafia family or prostitution ring, both of which would have an organizational 
structure and system of authority beyond that necessary to perpetuate the predicate crimes. 674 F.2d at 665. "
148,9," Having concluded that the RICO claims were timely (although insufficiently pled), the Court need not address TMT's argument 
that  there was ample evidence to support tolling of the statute of limitations. TMT's Mem., p. 21. However, the Court does note 
that the case cited by U.S. Bank for the proposition that equitable tolling based on fraudulent concealment had to be pled with 
particularity in the complaint is distinguishable. U.S. Bank's Reply Mem., p. 4 (citing Summerhill v. Terminix, 637 F.3d 877, 880 
(8th Cir. 2011)). In Summerhill, the claims were clearly time-barred and the court determined that it was plaintiff's burden to 
plead tolling based on fraudulent concealment with particularity. 637 F.3d at 880. Normally, a statute of limitations is an 
affirmative defense, which it is a defendant's burden to plead and prove. [*66]  John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 
U.S. 130, 128 S. Ct. 750, 753, 169 L. Ed. 2d 591 (2008). Therefore, the possible existence of a statute of limitations defense is 
not ordinarily a ground for dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), ""unless the complaint itself establishes the defense."" Jessie 
v. Potter, 516 F.3d 709, 715, n.2 (8th Cir. 2008) (citing Varner v. Peterson Farms, 371 F.3d 1011, 1017-18 (8th Cir. 2004)). 
Here, there is nothing obvious about the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint that brings the RICO claims outside the statute 
of limitations. "
150,10," A tying arrangement is defined ""as an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also 
purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier."" Northern 
Pac. Ry. Co., 356 U.S. at 5-6. "
152,11," Some courts distinguish between the ""injury to competition"" requirement of a substantive Sherman Act claim and the 
requirements for standing to assert an antitrust claim. TheMLSonline.com, Inc. v. Regional Multiple Listing Serv. of Minn., 840 F. 
Supp. 2d 1174, 1180 (D. Minn. 2012) (citing Angelico v. Lehigh Valley Hosp., Inc., 184 F.3d 268, 275 n.2 (3d Cir. 1999) (""The 
District Court erred by incorporating the issue of anticompetitive market effect into its standing analysis, confusing antitrust injury 
with an element of a claim under section 1 of the Sherman Act.""); Doctor's Hosp. of Jefferson, Inc. v. Southeast Med. Alliance, 
Inc., 123 F.3d 301, 305 (5th Cir.1997) (distinguishing between ""antitrust injury and injury to competition, the latter of which is 
often a component of substantive liability."")). As the court noted in TheMLSonline.com. Inc.: ""[t]he two concepts are closely 
related, however, and the Eighth Circuit and decisions from this District largely conflate [*79]  the two and incorporate an injury-
to-competition requirement into the analysis of antitrust standing. E.g., Midwest Commc'ns, 779 F.2d at 450 (noting in its 
discussion of antitrust injury for purposes of determining standing that ""Congress enacted the antitrust laws to protect 
competition, not competitors""); Fair Isaac Corp. v. Experian Info. Solutions Inc., 645 F.Supp.2d 734, 751 (D. Minn. 2009) 
(""[M]erely showing that [defendant] targeted and caused injury to [plaintiff] is insufficient to show an antitrust injury necessary to 
establish antitrust standing."")."" 840 F. Supp. 2d at 1180. In Minnesota Made Hockey, Inc. v. Minnesota Hockey, Inc., 789 F. 
Supp. 2d 1133, 1142-43 (8th Cir. 2011) the Eighth Circuit distinguished between antitrust standing and antitrust injury, but then 
focused its standing analysis on whether plaintiff had adequately pled that it was the target of anticompetitive activity. Neither party framed the issue of anticompetitive injury as a question of antitrust standing. Of course, the Court is entitled to 
""'examine standing sua sponte where standing has erroneously been assumed . . . .'"" Meuir v. Greene County Jail Employees, 
487 F.3d 1115, 1119 (8th Cir. 2007) (quoting Adarand Const., Inc. v. Mineta, 534 U.S. 103, 109, 122 S. Ct. 511, 151 L. Ed. 2d 
489 (2001)). Even assuming that TMT did not need to show competitive injury to establish antitrust standing, it was required to 
do so to assert a substantive claim under the Sherman Act. TheMLSonline.com, 840 F. Supp. 2d at 1180. Therefore, the Court 
has focused its attention on TMT's failure to adequately plead a substantive Sherman Act claim. "
155,12," At the motion hearing, U.S. Bank's counsel conceded that if the federal claims were dismissed, jurisdiction would be lacking 
over the state law claims. "
161,1," Defendants' request for judicial notice is GRANTED. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b) (the court ""may judicially notice a fact that is not 
subject to reasonable dispute because it . . . can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot 
reasonably be questioned""); see also Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006) (the court 
""may take judicial notice of court filings and other matters of public record""). "
162,2," On November 3, 2010 a Notice of Default was also recorded by CRC. Dkt. No. 8, at Ex. C. "
175,1," It is unclear whether the defense of frustration of purpose can even justify rescission of a contract under Michigan law. See 
Liggett, 676 N.W.2d at 637; See also Klein Steel Services Inc. v. Sirius Protection, LLC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59054, 2014 WL 
1685912 (E.D. Mich. 2014). Federal courts in Michigan have dismissed claims for rescission on this ground. See, e.g. Klein 
Steel Services, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59054, 2014 WL 1685912 at *4. A party can, however, seek restitution under a theory of 
frustration of purpose if that party has conferred any benefits on the opposing party through partial performance. See Jabero v. 
Harajli, 2004 Mich. App. LEXIS 1507, 2004 WL 1335896 at *3 (Mich.Ct.App. 2004). "

209,7, The parties agree that Albertsons has timely asserted its antitrust claims. 
210,8," On August 4, 2015, the court ultimately denied the joint motion of class plaintiffs and Amex for final approval of their proposed 
class action settlement. See In re Am. Express Anti-Steering Rules Antitrust Litig., No. 11-MD-2221 (NGG) (RER), 2015 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 102714, 2015 WL 4645240 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2015). Various class actions related to Amex's NDPs, as well as a 
related class action captioned Marcus Corp. v. American Express Co., No. 13-CV-7355 (E.D.N.Y.) (NGG) (RER), remain 
pending before the court."
210,9," The MPs challenge the same NDPs at issue in the Government Action, as well as two additional provisions contained in the 
NDPs that the Government did not challenge: (1) the no-surcharge rule, a provision prohibiting merchants from imposing a fee 
for the use of an Amex card that is not imposed equally on all other payment products (i.e., prohibiting merchants from 
differentially surcharging Amex cards vis-a-vis its competitors' cards), and (2) a provision prohibiting merchants from 
mischaracterizing Amex cards or engaging in activities that harm Amex's business or brand. See Government Decision, 88 F. 
Supp. 3d at 163."
210,10," The Government Action included only a Section 1 claim, and did not include a Section 2 claim. "
211,11," Also pending before the court are four fully briefed motions in limine, which the court does not address in this Memorandum 
and Order."
211,12," The court does not construe the panel's December 18, 2015, Order as having any jurisdictional effect on the MP Actions, 
which were separately filed from the Government Action and are not currently before the Second Circuit."
211,13," In the context of an amendment to a pleading, certain of the typical Rule 15 inquiries merge, in effect, with the Rule 16 inquiry, 
such as prejudice to the non-movant. Others, however, do not, including whether the amendment is futile even if the movant 
shows good cause to modify the scheduling order. "
212,14," The MPs argue that the Supreme Court's recent decision in B&B Hardware Inc. v. Hargis Industries Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1293, 191 
L. Ed. 2d 222 (2015), broadened the identicality standard into an inquiry concerning whether the two issues in the two actions 
are not ""materially unlike."" (See. e.g., MPs' Suppl. Mem. at 22 (""The question is whether steering by discounting is 'materially 
unlike' steering by surcharging in a manner that has 'legal significance' . . . ."").) The court is not convinced that the Supreme Court's decision in B&B Hardware went so far. There, in holding that findings from a 
registration challenge to a trademark in the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (""TTAB"") could apply to a later infringement 
action brought in federal court, [*72]  the Court noted that if the same usage of a trademark is at issue in the registration 
proceeding and the district court proceeding, then the ""issues"" to be decided in the context of the likelihood of confusion test are 
likely identical, but that if ""a mark owner [later] uses its mark in ways that are materially unlike the usages in its [previous TTAB] 
application, then the TTAB is not deciding the same issue"" as presented in the later federal action based on the later use of the 
mark. B&B Hardware, 135 S. Ct. at 1308. Nothing in the Court's analysis indicates that its use of the ""materially unlike"" 
framework applies outside of the factual context of the case—i.e., whether determinations made about a usage of a mark in the 
first action apply to a similar analysis of a materially similar usage of a mark in the second action. Cf. id. (""A fortiori, if the TTAB 
considers a different mark altogether, issue preclusion would not apply."")."
212,15," This differs from the approach of other circuits, see, e.g., Turney v. O'Toole, 898 F.2d 1470, 1472 n.1 (10th Cir. 1990) 
(""Because either proposed reason would have been a sufficient ground for granting the writ, it cannot be said that either issue 
was actually and necessarily decided.""), as well as the Restatement of Judgments, see Restatement (Second) of Judgements § 
27 cmt. i (""If a judgment of a court of first instance is based on determinations of two issues, either of which standing 
independently would be sufficient to support the result, the judgment is not conclusive with respect to either issue standing 
alone.""). "
216,16," Because the court finds that summary judgment is inappropriate even if the no-surcharge rule is analyzed unbundled from the 
rest of the NDPs, it need not reach the MPs' argument that consideration of the no-surcharge rule in isolation is legally 
impermissible. (See MPs' Original Mem. at 38-40 (arguing that principles set forth in Continental v. Union Carbide & Carbon 
Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962), preclude consideration of one alleged restraint without 
consideration of the others); Defs.' Original Reply at 23-24 (arguing that consideration of the no-surcharge rule in isolation [*86]  
is appropriate because regulators and Congress have elected to treat discounting and surcharging differently).) "
217,17," Of course, Amex does not make the parallel argument that the NM's' prohibition on merchant discounting (as opposed to 
surcharging) ensures lower prices for its cardholders. A discount offered by a merchant for the cardholder's use of an Amex card 
would, in fact, result in lower prices for Amex cardholders. But the NDPs prevent such conduct by merchants. "
218,18," But see, e.g., Dana's R.R. v. Attorney Gen., No. 14-14426, 807 F.3d 1235, 1239, 1247 n.9 (11th Cir. 2015) (distinguishing 
Expressions Hair Design and explaining that ""[t]autologically speaking, surcharges and discounts are nothing more than two 
sides of the same coin; a surcharge is simply a 'negative' discount, and a discount is a 'negative' surcharge"")."
218,19," Even if Amex was correct that, as a legal matter, a sufficient showing by a defendant that Section 1 damages were not 
speculative could defeat the application of the purchaser-accrual exception under Section 2, summary judgment on the Section 
2 claim would not be appropriate in this case because there are genuine issues of material fact with respect to whether the MPs' 
Section 1 damages were or were not speculative. See infra Part III.B.3.b. "
219,20," The parties appear to agree that a purported class action challenging the NDPs filed on April 18, 2006, tolled the statute of 
limitations pursuant to American Pipe Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.S. 538, 94 S. Ct. 756, 38 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1974), through 
the present. (See Defs.' Original Mem. at 3 & n.2; MPs' Original Mem. at 24 n. 11.) Accordingly, for purposes of the speculative 
damages exception and summary judgment, the relevant inquiry [*96]  is whether a reasonable jury could find that the MPs' 
future damages were speculative as of the beginning of May 2002. If a reasonable jury would be compelled to find that damages 
were reasonably estimable as of May 2002, then, based on the effective dates of each merchant agreement, each MP's Section 
1 claim (except Albertsons) would have necessarily expired before May 2006, no claims would be tolled pursuant to American 
Pipe, and the MP Actions (filed in 2008 and 2011) would be time-barred. In other words, the parties appear to agree that damages that may have occurred in January 2002 are time-barred. Even if they 
were speculative as of the signing of the merchant agreement (for example, in 1996), these damages would have actually 
occurred (and were no longer speculative) at the very latest upon Amex actually imposing a supracompetitive discount fee for 
that particular month, and the MPs were therefore required to file suit for January 2002 damages by January 2006, before 
American Pipe tolling applied. The MPs did not file suit by January 2006, and claims related to January 2002 damages expired 
in January 2006. Claims related to damages that occurred in June 2002 would have similarly expired [*97]  in June 2006, but 
American Pipe tolled the expiration of the claim for June 2002 damages through 2008 and 2011, when the MPs filed suit. The court notes, in addition, that the filing of the Government Action in October 2010 also tolled any of the MPs' live claims as of 
that date. See 15 U.S.C. § 16(i). However, because the Government Action was filed many years after the May 2006, class 
action, it is the 2006 date and American Pipe tolling that provides the MPs with the longest period of tolling and the relevant date 
of May 2002 for purposes of the speculative damages exception. "
220,21," With respect to a minority of the MPs, the parties dispute whether agreements entered from 2002 through 2005, which appear 
to have amended each of the particular MPs' operative card acceptance agreements in order to create new, higher fuel discount 
rates as opposed to the pre-existing and otherwise generally applicable supermarket discount rates, constitute overt acts that 
inflicted new injury under the continuing violation doctrine. Amex argues that the increased fuel discount rates merely remedied 
a windfall that the MPs were receiving for fuel that they sold, since fuel discount rates for other fuel retailers were historically 
higher than supermarket discount rates. (See Defs.' Original Reply at 20-21.) In addition, Amex argues that the agreements 
setting forth the fuel discount rates constitute agreed-upon contracts between it and the MPs, and therefore cannot qualify as a 
""unilateral"" increase in the discount rate. (Id. at 20.) The MPs counter that the new fuel discount rates were exactly the type of 
act that qualifies as an overt act inflicting new injury under the continuing violation doctrine: whereas before, the MPs did not pay 
Amex a premium for fuel transactions, they [*100]  did after the change. The court concludes that genuine issues of material fact preclude the entry of summary judgment on this sub-issue. If the 
agreements containing the new fuel discount rates are, in fact, ""new"" and independent agreements between the MPs and Amex, 
then the court's discussion in the SOL Decision regarding when performance under a long-term contract can qualify as an overt 
act (e.g., a unilateral increase in the discount fee) becomes irrelevant, because a new claim for damages would have accrued at 
that time with respect to that particular contract and any resulting damages. If, on the other hand, the rise in fuel discount rates 
occurred pursuant to the original merchant agreements, the MPs have raised a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether 
the new rate is more than a mere ""reaffirmation"" of a previous act, and instead qualifies as an overt act that allows them to 
recover damages stemming from that act. Cf., e.g., Madison Square Garden, L.P. v. Nat'l Hockey League, No. 07-CV-8455 
(LAP), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80475, 2008 WL 4547518, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2008) (holding that the renewal of policy that 
does not include any substantive changes in the plaintiff's rights constitutes a reaffirmation of the prior act and not a new and 
independent act). "
221,22," The court notes, as Amex points out, that there may be little reason to apply the speculative damages exception to the laches 
defense, as the reason justifying the exception—that the plaintiff [*105]  could not have known the extent of its monetary 
damages at the time of the unlawful act—does not apply where the plaintiff could have brought suit seeking prospective 
injunctive relief to stop both the unlawful act and the further accumulation of unknown and speculative damages. "
226,**," The Honorable Rosemary Márquez, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, sitting by designation."
226,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.
226,1," We consolidate Appeals No. 13-17408, 13-17618, and 14-16144 for purposes of disposition. "
227,2," [**5] Thus, it is not necessary to reach Best Buy's arguments that the judgment may be affirmed on the alternative grounds 
that HannStar's conduct satisfied the import commerce exclusion to the FTAIA, or that the FTAIA does not apply to claims under 
Minnesota law."
227,3," Although the jury also found that the conspiracy did not involve conduct with a ""direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable 
effect on trade or commerce in the United States,"" this does not speak to the jury's findings regarding effects on import 
commerce. In light of the jury instructions, the most natural understanding of ""in the United States"" is ""wholly within the United 
States,"" i.e., in nonimport domestic commerce. "
231,1," The parties heavily cite, and assume substantial familiarity with, this Court's two principal decisions in Aluminum in their filings 
in relation to the pending motions. In the first decision, this Court dismissed an initial set of complaints and granted certain 
plaintiffs leave to amend. In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig. (""Aluminum I""), No. 13-MD-2481 KBF, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 121435, 2014 WL 4277510 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2014). In the second decision, this Court allowed the Section 1 claims of 
certain plaintiffs to survive the various defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motions, but dismissed all Section 2 claims. In re Aluminum 
Warehousing Antitrust Litig. (""Aluminum II""), 95 F. Supp. 3d 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). The parties here devote a great deal of 
attention to comparing and contrasting plaintiffs' pleadings to those at issue in Aluminum I and Aluminum II. "
232,2," The Court notes recent Second Circuit case law suggesting this is the appropriate course for the Court to follow. See Loreley 
Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, 797 F.3d 160, 191 (2d Cir. 2015)."
232,3," Unless otherwise noted, citations to the record refer to the lead docket in this case, 14-cv-3728. "
233,4," On September 28, 2015, plaintiffs filed—and the Court accepted—a Corrected Consolidated Amended Complaint that fixed 
several numerical errors. (Corrected Consolidated Amended Complaint (""CAC""), ECF No. 138; see ECF No. 141.) Plaintiffs also 
filed a corrected omnibus brief in opposition to defendants' motions to dismiss that reflected those corrections. (ECF No. 139.) 
The Court will refer only to those corrected filings in the remainder of this decision. "
234,5," The Court notes that while plaintiffs appear to have used the complaints filed in Aluminum as a template in drafting the CAC 
and seem to assume a great deal of familiarity with the operation of the LME and metals markets in general, the CAC does not 
clearly explain what, if any, differences exist between the operation of the zinc and aluminum markets. The CAC largely 
assumes that zinc pricing operates similarly to that for aluminum, and does not explain the mechanics of the market to the same 
degree that the plaintiffs in Aluminum did in their latest pleadings."
234,6," According to the LME's website, the non-ferrous metals transacted on the LME include, inter alia, zinc, aluminum alloy, 
aluminum, copper, [**17]  lead, nickel, tin and NASAAC (North American Special Aluminum Alloy Contract). Non-ferrous Metals, 
LME Website (Nov. 20, 2015), https://www.lme.com/metals/non-ferrous/ . Plaintiffs repeatedly cite the LME's website in the 
CAC, and it is therefore incorporated by reference. (E.g., CAC ¶¶ 101 n.19, 102 n.20, 106 n.22, 107 n.23, 108 n.28.)"
234,7," Category 1 members consist primarily of investment banks that are members of the open-outcry ""Ring"", which, as discussed 
below, is the process by which physical base metals are traded. (CAC ¶ 100.) Category 2 members are associated broker 
clearing members and have all the privileges of Category 1 members except that they may not openly trade in the Ring. (CAC ¶ 
100.) Category 5 members are primarily mining companies. (CAC ¶ 100.) "
235,8," ""The LME Official Price is the last bid and offer price quoted during the second Ring session and the LME Official Settlement 
Price is the last cash offer price."" LME Official Price, LME Website (Nov. 20, 2015), https://www.lme.com/en-gb/pricing-and-
data/pricing/official-price/ ."
235,9," As discussed below, plaintiffs improperly apply generic names to corporate affiliates throughout the CAC, making it difficult at 
various points for the Court to determine which specific defendant(s) to whom plaintiffs intend to refer. "
237,10," The CAC does not provide any indication that Metro or Henry Bath would have had to be complicit in (or even have knowledge 
of) Pacorini's false listing of their warehouses as delivery locations. If the falsified deliveries to Metro and Henry Bath 
warehouses were entirely fabricated, the Court doesn't see why Pacorini would need Metro or Henry Bath's cooperation or 
involvement. "
238,11," According to the Report of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate, Metro's Vice President of 
Marketing, Mark Askew, sent an email in December 2010 to Metro CEO Chris Wibbelman expressing reservations about ""Q 
Management"" in light of a conversation with ""Paco"" (i.e. Pacorini) a few weeks prior. (CAC ¶ 240.) The CAC contains no 
allegations describing what this email relates to or whether it has any relation to zinc or to Pacorini's New Orleans warehouses."
238,12," The CAC does not define or elsewhere reference ""J. Aron."" The Court presumes that plaintiffs mean to refer to J. Aron & 
Company, which the plaintiffs in Aluminum alleged was a trading division of Goldman Sachs. See Aluminum II, 95 F. Supp. 3d at 
445 n.28. "
239,13," As discussed above, plaintiffs also allege that all of the defendants conspired to monopolize that market in violation of Section 
2. (CAC ¶¶ 271-76.) "
240,14, The Herfindahl index is a standard measure of concentration used in industrial organization analysis. (CAC ¶ 144 n.51.)
240,15," When a warrant is ""canceled"", the canceled metal is added to the load-out queue but the owner continues to pay daily rent 
until the metal exits the facility. (CAC ¶ 134.) "
241,16," Neither § 1 nor § 2 of the Sherman Act provides for a private right of action. That is accomplished by §§ 4 and 16 of the 
Clayton Act. Section 4 provides for a treble damages action and states that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws"" may sue for treble damages. 15 U.S.C. § 15. Section 16 provides 
for an action for injunctive relief and states that ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and 
have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by [**43]  a violation of the antitrust laws . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. 
Plaintiffs must establish antitrust standing with respect to each antitrust claim pursued. See Daniel v. Am. Bd. of Emergency 
Med., 428 F.3d 408, 436-38 (2d Cir. 2005) (antitrust standing inquiry is injury-specific). Accordingly, the Court reviews standing 
with regard to plaintiffs' §§ 1 and 2 claims separately."
241,17," That plaintiffs do not allege that their zinc was stuck in the load-out queue at Pacorini's New Orleans warehouses behind that 
of Pacorini's allegedly ""preferred customers"" does not mean that they fail to allege injury in fact. Plaintiffs' allegations that they 
paid higher prices as a result of defendants' conduct, even if causation is attenuated, are sufficient to plead injury in fact. 
Defendants' arguments relating to the indirectness of plaintiffs' alleged injury are more appropriately directed at the question of 
antitrust injury and efficient enforcer prongs of the standing analysis. "
243,18," The term ""fulcrum"" is defined as ""the support about which a lever turns,"" or alternatively, ""one that supplies capability for 
action."" Fulcrum, Merriam-Webster, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fulcrum (last visited Nov. 17, 2015)."
243,19," The sole arguable exception is that plaintiff Jasper Materials, Inc., alleges that it purchased zinc directly from Glencore during 
the Class Period. (CAC ¶ 56.) "
244,20," Defendants counter that plaintiffs are not efficient enforcers because their injuries are at best indirect and speculative, and at 
worst nonexistent. Defendants contend that warrant holders whose metal was possibly stuck in the queue at Pacorini's New 
Orleans warehouses behind that of Pacorini's ""preferred customers"" were more directly harmed by defendants' alleged 
agreement. At this stage, that argument cannot alter the outcome on this element. Injury to such entities (such as inflated rents 
and warehousing fees, or delayed load-outs) could well be entirely different from the injury alleged by plaintiffs here (namely, 
paying inflated prices for primary zinc due to increases in the MW SHG Premium). "
245,21," At oral argument, plaintiffs asserted that because Counts II-IV incorporate all of the CAC's preceding allegations, those claims 
may be fairly read as alleging monopoly power in both markets. (October 30, 2015 Oral Arg. Tr. (""Oral Arg. Tr."") at 102:24-
103:20, ECF No. 153; see [**59]  CAC ¶¶ 271, 277, 284.) This, however, is not a fair characterization of the CAC, which 
specifically alleges monopoly power only over the warehousing services market and the relevant counts make no reference to 
the market for the sale of primary zinc. (See CAC ¶¶ 271-90.) As discussed below, to the extent that plaintiffs seek to amend 
their complaint to attempt to state a monopoly claim as to both markets, the Court grants them leave to amend to do so."
245,22," Plaintiffs cite In re Crude Oil Commodity Futures Litigation, 913 F. Supp. 2d 41 (S.D.N.Y. 2012), for the proposition that paying 
supra-competitive prices as a result of a defendant's monopoly power is a ""quintessential antitrust injury"" for Section 2 purposes. 
Id. at 57. In Crude Oil, the court noted the lack of authority ""for the proposition that an antitrust injury cannot extend beyond the 
bounds of the monopolized market,"" and went on to conclude that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged antitrust injury because their 
losses were ""of the type that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent."" Id. While the paying of higher prices due to monopoly 
power is at the very core of what Section 2 is intended to prevent, as explained below, Section 2 is designed to protect against 
the raising of prices or restricting of output in the particular, defined market [**60]  for which the defendant has monopoly power, 
not in an entirely separate market. "
246,23," In Crimpers, the Second Circuit applied McCready's inextricably intertwined concept where the plaintiff alleged claims under 
both Sections 1 and 2, but the Court's analysis was focused on the Section 1 conspiracy claim (and actually questioned whether 
plaintiff's Section 2 monopolization claim was in fact one of oligopoly under Section 1, see Crimpers, 724 F.2d at 291 n.1); it did 
not specifically address whether and how the inextricably intertwined concept might apply to Section 2, see id. at 294-95. The 
Second Circuit again cited McCready's inextricably intertwined language in a case involving a Section 2 claim in In re DDAVP 
Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litigation, 585 F.3d 677 (2d Cir. 2009), although in that case the plaintiffs alleged that they were direct 
purchasers of the drugs as to which the defendants were alleged to have unlawfully maintained a monopoly, id. at 683. Given 
the absence of discussion of there being multiple markets at issue, it is far from clear that In re DDAVP was intended to 
endorse [**63]  the application of McCready to a situation in which plaintiffs allege injury in one market caused by defendants' 
monopoly in another market. Plaintiffs point to no lower court decision citing McCready's inextricably intertwined language that 
discussed the interaction of two different markets where the alleged monopolistic conduct in one market caused damage in 
another market. "
247,24," Although certain sets of defendants are affiliated with one another, defendants have for the most part not argued that plaintiffs' 
Section 1 claim is deficient for failure to allege an agreement between separate entities (although defendants vigorously contest 
whether any alleged agreement has otherwise been sufficiently pled). Because the CAC alleges agreements between a number 
of entities from different corporate families, plaintiffs' Section 1 claim does not fail under Copperweld's separate entities 
requirement. That being said, to the extent that plaintiffs' Section 1 claim remains viable only as to defendants that are part of the 
same corporate family (such as Glencore Ltd. and Pacorini), plaintiffs' allegations run into Copperweld issues. "
248,25," In Mayor & City Council of Baltimore v. Citigroup, Inc., the Second Circuit reviewed whether allegations of certain parallel 
conduct in the auction rate securities market were sufficient to support a § 1 conspiracy. Plaintiffs alleged that defendant banks 
conspired with each other to simultaneously stop buying auction rate securities for their own proprietary accounts, causing 
auctions to fail and the market to collapse. 709 F.3d at 131-32. The Court found that the allegations [**70]  supported only 
parallel conduct. Id. at 138. The Court began by noting that the crucial question in a § 1 case is whether the challenged conduct stems from an agreement, 
and that the existence of such an agreement is a legal conclusion to be determined by the court—and not a factual allegation. Id. 
at 135-36 (citing Starr v. Sony BMG Music Entm't, 592 F.3d 314, 319 n.2 (2d Cir. 2010)). The Court further stated that plaintiffs 
must allege additional circumstances supporting an inference of conspiracy; merely alleging that parallel conduct occurred is 
insufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss because it would ""risk propelling defendants into expensive antitrust discovery on 
the basis of acts that could just as easily turn out to have been rational business behavior as they could a proscribed antitrust 
conspiracy."" Id. at 136-37. The Court found that defendants' alleged actions—an en masse flight from a collapsing market in 
which they had significant downside exposure—made perfect sense in light of their business interests. Id. at 138. This 
distinguished the case from Starr, in which specific allegations supporting an inference that defendants' parallel conduct was 
against their own economic self-interest led the Second Circuit to conclude that plaintiffs had plausibly alleged an antitrust 
conspiracy. [**71]  See id. at 138-39 (citing Starr, 592 F.3d at 327). Accordingly, the Court affirmed the district court's grant of 
defendants' motion to dismiss. Id. at 140. "
249,26," To the extent that plaintiffs point to the ""Queue Manager"" spreadsheet as further evidence of an unlawful agreement, the CAC 
describes the spreadsheet as something that Pacorini used as a ""very private"" and ""strictly 'in-house'"" project; it is thus unclear 
how evidence relating to the spreadsheet could meaningfully contribute to plaintiffs' claim that this collection of defendants 
engaged in a broad five-year conspiracy. (CAC ¶ 196.) "
250,27," The Court separately considers below (in addressing [**77]  what the Court refers to as plaintiffs' second theory) whether the 
allegations relating to the Queue Order Agreement may nonetheless support a plausible inference of a narrower (both 
temporally and in scope) conspiracy under § 1."
250,28," The Court incorporates by reference its prior discussion of the flaws with plaintiffs' direct evidence relating to the alleged 
Queue Order Agreement and Pacorini's practice of falsifying bills of lading, and notes that it considers all of that evidence 
collectively with plaintiffs' other allegations to determine whether plaintiffs have pled a plausible § 1 conspiracy."
250,29," The CAC alleges that Glencore did not acquire Pacorini until September 2010, approximately four months after the start of the 
Class [**81]  Period. (CAC ¶ 108.) Notably, the CAC does not allege that defendants made an agreement that each would 
acquire a LME-certified warehousing services provider. "
251,30," Furthermore, even if these allegations contributed some support to an inference of an anticompetitive agreement, the CAC 
does not allege that JPMorgan or Henry Bath provided any similar incentive payments. "
253,31," Plaintiffs argue that the alleged agreement to restrain supply in the zinc warehousing market constitutes a per se violation of 
Section 1. The Court need not resolve whether the purported conspiracy should be viewed as a per se violation or whether it 
must be reviewed under a rule of reason analysis because plaintiffs have not plausibly pled the existence of concerted action 
that could give rise to a Section 1 violation in the first instance."
253,32," Noticeably absent from plaintiffs' market allocation theory is any mention of the JPMorgan-affiliated [**93]  entities. (See CAC 
¶¶ 241-43.) Thus, even if the Market Allocation Agreement was sufficiently pled against the other defendants, the JPMorgan "
254,," entities and Henry Bath would be entitled to dismissal of this claim because the CAC does not plausibly allege that they were 
allocated any market or had any involvement in this alleged scheme."
254,33," The Court notes that the plaintiffs in Aluminum relied on these same emails and argued they were about the aluminum market. 
See Aluminum II, 95 F. Supp. 3d at 435."
254,34," Under this theory, the other warehouse operating defendants, Metro and Henry Bath, are not involved in the unlawful 
agreement. Thus, if this theory was the only basis upon which plaintiffs stated a plausible Section 1 claim, both of these 
defendants would be entitled to dismissal."
254,35," While the CAC does not expressly include the language of a hub-and-spoke theory, the Court addresses it because at this 
stage the complaint need only give full notice of the circumstances giving rise to the plaintiffs' claim for relief and need not also "
255,," correctly plead the legal theory or theories supporting the claim. Simonton v. Runyon, 232 F.3d 33, 36-37 (2d Cir. 2000). The 
Court raised the possibility of a hub-and-spoke theory in the questions that it provided the parties the day before oral argument 
(ECF No. 149), and the parties had the opportunity to address—and did address—this theory at oral argument (Oral Arg. Tr. at 
17:25-20:14, 49:7-49:22, 115:7-115:18). "
257,36," At oral argument, plaintiffs argued—for the first time—that by incorporating all of the CAC's prior allegations into their Section 
2 claims (see CAC ¶¶ 271, 277, 284), those claims may be fairly read as alleging monopolization of the LME Zinc Warehouse 
Services Market and ""the market for the physical price of zinc."" (Oral Arg. Tr. at 102:24-103:20). As currently pled, the CAC does 
not plausibly allege monopoly power in the market for the sale of primary zinc. For instance, none of the Section 2 counts make 
any direct reference [**106]  to that market and the allegations in the CAC taken as a whole do not connect the dots to plausibly 
show that Glencore Ltd. and/or Pacorini have monopoly power in that market. If plaintiffs seek to assert that Glencore's activity in 
the physical zinc market created a monopoly position or was dangerously close to doing so, they must make that allegation more 
directly than they have done thus far. As set forth in the Leave to Amend section below, the Court will allow plaintiffs another 
opportunity to re-plead their monopolization and attempted monopolization claims in a way that addresses both markets. "
258,37," As was the case in Aluminum II, plaintiffs' § 2 claim is also incompatible with their § 1 claim. In Aluminum II, this Court stated 
that the first level purchasers' monopolization claim was undermined by the plausible and conflicting allegations that Goldman 
Sachs and Metro needed and used conspirators in areas outside Detroit to assist in their scheme. See Aluminum II, 95 F. Supp. 
3d at 455-56. Plaintiffs' monopolization claim here is similarly incompatible with their allegations [**109]  that Glencore Ltd. 
and/or Pacorini needed and used third parties to effect the scheme, although the Court notes that, in this case, Glencore 
appears to have a more dominant position in the zinc market than Goldman Sachs/Metro had with respect to aluminum."
258,38," Defendants also contend that the CAC does not contain the necessary facts to support a plausible product or geographic 
market. Because the Court grants defendants' motions on other grounds, it need not reach this argument."
258,39," Plaintiffs' allegations that Glencore affiliates were responsible for cancelling large volumes of zinc are wholly conclusory and 
are insufficient to show monopoly power in the physical zinc market. (See CAC ¶¶ 146-50, 157). The Court does recognize, 
however, that the allegations here do suggest that Glencore and its affiliates occupy a more dominant and influential position in 
the zinc market than Goldman Sachs and its affiliates occupied with respect to the aluminum market. (E.g., CAC ¶ 64.) "
260,40," There appears to be a great deal of redundancy between conspiracy claims brought under Sections 1 and 2. At least one 
court in this district has stated that ""[a]ny section 2 conspiracy to monopolize [**117]  must be covered under the broader 
umbrella of a section 1 conspiracy in restraint of trade."" H.L. Hayden Co. of New York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 672 F. Supp. 
724, 741 n.21 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) aff'd, 879 F.2d 1005 (2d Cir. 1989). There is nothing in the case law to suggest that the 
plausibility threshold is lower to state a conspiracy to monopolize claim under Section 2 than for a claim alleging a conspiracy in 
restraint of trade under Section 1. "
262,41," The Court notes that plaintiffs would be advised to more clearly differentiate the roles played by Glencore Ltd. and Pacorini, 
instead of using the generic term ""Glencore"", throughout any second consolidated amended complaint."
262,42," The Court has considered plaintiffs' other arguments, and has determined that they are without merit. "
267,1," Because the district court excluded the report of Reed's expert, Dr. Warren-Boulton, only on the issue of damages, we need not 
reach Reed's challenge to that decision because the materiality defect in Reed's Lanham Act and Sherman Act claims causes 
them to fail in any event. "

274,2," In support of this proposition, Irmat points to its recent experience with customers from the state of Georgia. Because of a new 
Georgia state licensing requirement, Irmat briefly ceased providing mail-order services to customers in Georgia in June 2015. 
See O'Keefe Aff. ¶¶ 14-15. As a result, dermatologists in Georgia found alternative pharmacies to refer patients to. Id. ¶ 16. 
Though Irmat resumed the provision of such services in August 2015, ""the vast majority of dermatologists that had previously 
referred patients to Irmat did not revert back to doing so."" Plaintiff's Opening Brief (""Pl. Br."") at 10, ECF No. 15. "
275,3," ""Participating Pharmacies"" is not a defined term in the 2015 Agreement. "
277,4," Because the Court finds that AccessHealth had actual authority to bind Irmat, it need not reach the issue of whether, in the 
absence of such actual authority, Irmat would still be bound by the 2015 Agreement on a theory of apparent authority."
277,5," Irmat argues that Optum's 2015 Pharmacy Manual (which describes the necessary accreditations for mail-order pharmacies), 
and Optum's prohibition on providing mail-order pharmacy services, were not clearly incorporated by reference into [**21]  
Irmat's own separate agreement with AccessHealth. This argument is a red herring that the Court need not reach. The 
dispositive point, for purposes of plaintiff's breach-of-contract claim, is that the 2015 Agreement entered into on Irmat's behalf by 
AccessHealth is a valid contract that binds Irmat. "
278,6," Plaintiff's implied covenant theory faces another hurdle that renders its success unlikely, viz., ""New York law requires dismissal 
of an implied covenant claim where the claim derives from the same set of facts as a breach of contract claim,"" as it does here. 
FCOF UB Sec. LLC v. MorEquity, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 2d 224, 231 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). "
280,7," The relevant provision in the 2015 Pharmacy Manual could be reasonably read to mean that a mail-order pharmacy does not 
qualify for participation [**33]  in Optum's retail pharmacy network merely by virtue of being a mail-order pharmacy, rather than 
as completely foreclosing the possibility of a pharmacy participating in both networks. "
281,8," Irmat asserts in a footnote, without any explanation, that the 2015 Agreement constitutes a per se illegal ""group boycott,"" but 
Irmat fails to explain who is boycotting what. Pl. Br. at 19 n.7. The word ""boycott"" does not even appears in its complaint. This 
argument is made far too summarily to warrant the Court's consideration."
281,9," While Irmat dismisses these justifications as pretextual, this contention, at present, lacks evidentiary support. "
282,10," A court assessing a motion for a preliminary injunction must ""ensure that the 'public interest would not be disserved' by the 
issuance"" of such an injunction. Salinger, 607 F.3d at 80. Here, plaintiff has failed to show that an injunction is warranted and, as 
such, the Court need not address the public interest. However, to the extent the issue has not been entirely obviated, the Court 
finds the public interest to be a neutral factor. On the one hand, termination will result in the disruption of medical services to 
many of Irmat's customers. On the other hand, at present, Irmat lacks the accreditations as a mail-order pharmacy that Optum 
contends it requires to ensure that ""pharmacies in its mail pharmacy network have the appropriate controls and processes in 
place to safely and effectively dispense medications by mail."" Tanner Decl. ¶ 7. The public has an interest in uninterrupted and 
safe medical care and, as such, the public interest would not clearly be served or disserved by the issuance of the requested 
injunction. "
284,1, This 2009 action will be referred to as In re Propane I. 
289,2," Plaintiffs' main argument against application of the doctrine of laches is that laches should not be applied at this stage of the 
proceedings. (Doc. # 222, p. 14). However, the doctrine of laches has often been applied at the pleadings stage. See Goodman, 
606 F.2d at 809; Wolfchild v. Redwood Cty., 91 F. Supp. 3d 1093, 1105 (D. Minn. 2015); Little Rock Cardiology Clinic, P.A. v. 
Baptist Health, 573 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1152 (E.D. Ark. 2008) aff'd sub nom. Little Rock Cardiology Clinic PA v. Baptist Health, 
591 F.3d 591 (8th Cir. 2009). "
290,3, This action will be known as the Ortiz Complaint 
292,4," Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint is insufficient because it fails to allege facts that tend to exclude 
the existence of independent action. (Doc. # 211, p. 25). However, this is a requirement at the summary judgment, not the 
motion to dismiss stage. See Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 at 554, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929; see also Erie Cty., Ohio v. 
Morton Salt, Inc., 702 F.3d 860, 869 (6th Cir. 2012)."
292,5," As discussed in the Order of Dismissal, at this stage, this Court must accept the factual allegations as true and may not 
consider outside evidence. (Doc. # 162, p. 5). Thus, at this juncture, the Court is not capable of deciding whether any Plaintiffs 
were included in the release provisions of In re Propane I. "
300,1," Plaintiffs' economist, MacKie-Mason, did not dispute News Corp.'s 2.7 year average in his expert reports. He also offered no 
opinion or analysis that the average contract length was different or longer than News Corp.'s estimation. (See News Corp. Ex. 
24, MacKie-Mason Dep. Tr. 67:13-19.) For the first time during briefing of this motion, Plaintiffs' submit a declaration from 
MacKie-Mason in which he performs a new analysis to rebut News Corp.'s 2.7 year average. (See Pl. Ex. 3, Declaration of 
Jeffery MacKie-Mason in Support of Opposition to Summary Judgment.)"
300,2," Plaintiffs contend that News Corp.'s average excludes contracts entered into before 2008 but ran during the damages period. 
(Caughey [**14]  Decl. Ex. 3, Declaration of Jeffrey MacKie-Mason in Support of Opposition to Summary Judgment at ¶ 19.) "
302,3, News Corp. disagrees and contends that Valassis failed because of its own strategy. But that is a fact question for the jury.
302,4," The proscriptions of Section One of the Sherman Act are narrower than Section Three of the Clayton Act. See Tampa Elec. 
Co., 365 U.S. at 335 (""We need not discuss the respondents' further contention that the contract also violates s 1 and s 2 of the "
303,," Sherman Act, for if it does not fall within the broader [**23]  proscription of s 3 of the Clayton Act it follows that it is not forbidden 
by those of the former.""). Because News Corp.'s motion is denied with respect to Plaintiffs' Sherman Act Section One claims, 
News Corp.'s motion is also denied under Section Three of the Clayton Act. "
308,5," Plaintiffs also point out that MacKie-Mason presents an ""alternative benchmark"" consisting of firms that the ""data vendor 
Capital IQ identified as ""similar to News [Corp.]."" (Michael Decl. Ex 48, MacKie-Mason Rebuttal Rpt. at 54.) "
309,6," News Corp. also challenges the portions of MacKie-Mason's testimony in which he suggests that News Corp.'s high profit 
margins necessarily indicate market power. But, as Plaintiffs point out, MacKie-Mason opines that News Corp.'s ""persistently 
high"" profit margins are but one indicator of market power. (Michael Decl. Ex. 4, MacKie-Mason Rpt. at 71). This testimony is 
admissible. See, e.g., MacDermid Printing Solutions, Inc. v. Cortron Corp., No. 08 Civ. 1649, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79941, 2014 
WL 2615361, at *5 (D. Conn. June 12, 2014) (noting that profit margins may ""indirectly"" speak to market definition). "
312,1, The following facts are drawn from the parties' Local Rule 56(a) Statements and are undisputed unless otherwise indicated. 
316,2," I should note that there is also some evidence indicating that the CBA was incorporated into the PLA. Each PLA at issue stated 
that its provisions were subject to the existing Schedules A. Although neither party could procure a list of the Schedules A listed 
in the PLAs, a plain reading of the PLAs suggests that the Schedules A were a list of CBAs to be incorporated into the PLAs. 
See Def.'s Ex. 70, at 4. I gave Ironworkers the opportunity to dispute this inference through post-hearing supplemental [**21]  
memorandum, but they have failed to do so. Furthermore, Ironworkers could not point to any legal authority indicating that CBAs 
were legally outside the scope of the PLAs. "
317,3," After oral argument, I asked Ironworkers to provide support for their contention that Carpenters' enforcement of their CBA was 
contrary to public bid statutes. Ironworkers failed to mention any specific public bid law that the Carpenters allegedly violated in 
their attempt to enforce provisions of the CBA agreement. Accordingly I conclude that no dispute of material fact exists with 
respect to the allegations that the Carpenters enforced their CBA contrary to any public bid law."
317,4," I also should note that the assertion that construction managers did not exist in 1959 is quite dubious, given that Carpenters 
have pointed to two pre-1959 cases involving construction managers. Nevertheless, that factual question is not material. "
318,5," The Carpenters have not claimed that the challenged agreements fall within the statutory exemption. In any event, the 
agreements would not fall under the statutory exemption because the agreements concern both union and non-union conduct. 
See Local 210, 844 F.2d at 79."
318,6," See also H. Perritt, Jr., Keeping the Government Out of the Way: Project Labor Agreements Under the Supreme Court's 
Boston Harbor Decision, 12 Lab. Law. 69, 90 (1996) (""[T]he more logical relationship between the two statutes is that conduct 
allowed by the NLRA also is within the labor exemptions to the antitrust laws. In other words, if a project labor agreement is 
permitted by section 8(e), it may not be the basis of antitrust liability.""). "
319,7," The Carpenters have come forward with evidence that the subcontracting agreements are part of the existing CBAs, which, 
absent evidence to the contrary, I conclude serve the legitimate goal of controlling the workplace. D.L.R. ¶¶ 29-34; Def.'s Mot. 
Summ. J. Br. at 6-9."
319,8," Courts have also looked to the history of bargaining over a particular subject as evidence that an agreement relating to that 
subject fell within the non-statutory labor exemption. See Local Union No. 189, Amalgamated Meat Cutters & Butcher Workmen 
of N. Am., AFL-CIO v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U.S. 676, 697, 85 S. Ct. 1596, 14 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1965). In the instant case, the 
Carpenters [**32]  point to the fact that Ironworkers have similar subcontracting agreements with their union-affiliated employers. 
That is even further evidence that such agreements are the proper subject of a CBA. "
320,9," The Carpenters also point out that injunctive relief is not available under section 187. I need not address that issue because I 
have concluded that there has been no unfair labor practices violation. "
321,10," Because I have concluded that the construction industry proviso applies to shield the Carpenters from any alleged labor 
violation with respect to their lawful subcontracting agreements, I do not reach the question whether [**38]  or not an issue of 
fact was raised with respect to Carpenters' role in Turgeon's rescission of MRS's contract."
321,11," Ironworkers moved to strike portions of the Carpenters' reply brief and accompanying exhibits (doc. # 106). Ironworkers 
argued that Carpenters violated Rule 56 and Local Rule 7(d) by introducing new materials in their reply brief and arguing outside 
the scope of the discussion of matters raised by [**39]  Ironworkers' opposition brief. Furthermore, Ironworkers argued that 
Carpenters violated Rule 56 by using inadmissible evidence in support of its motion for summary judgment. There is no need to 
strike those portions of the reply brief. See Martin v. Town of Westport, 558 F. Supp. 2d 228, 231 (D. Conn. 2008) (""the court 
knows the difference between admissible and non-admissible evidence, and would not base a summary judgment decision [on 
the latter]""). Because I have arrived at my conclusion independent of the Carpenters' arguments in their reply brief and the 
alleged inadmissible evidence submitted in support of the motion for summary judgment, I deny as moot Ironworkers' motion to 
strike (doc. # 106). "

326,3," This dispute is being litigated concurrently in this District in front of Judge Chatigny. Charter Practices International v. Robb, 
No. 12-cv-01768 (RNC)."
326,4," Section 19a-14 states that DPH has the power to ""[c]onduct any necessary review, inspection or investigation regarding 
qualifications of applicants for licenses or certificates, possible violations of statutes or regulations, and disciplinary matters."""
326,5," C.G.S. §20-202(2) states that the Board may impose disciplinary action pursuant to Section 19a-17 where, inter alia, there is 
""proof [**8]  that [a licensed veterinarian] has been guilty of . . . negligence towards animals[.] In determining whether the holder 
of such license has acted with negligence, the board may consider standards of care and guidelines published by the American 
Veterinary Medical Association including, but not limited to, guidelines for the use, distribution and prescribing of prescription 
drugs."""
326,6," Dr. Robb was not always of the view that state law is silent as to rabies dosages amounts. This is evident from various sources. 
Dr. Robb stated the following at a January 7, 2015 hearing in front of the Defendant Board: MR. BERNARD: Now, [whether you administered half dosages of rabies vaccine is] either true or not true. If it's [**9]  true, 
the reasons why you did it are not really anything we care about. DR. ROBB: Oh really. MR. BERNARD: There's a state statute that says you are to administer a full dose of rabies vaccine. DR. ROBB: That's wrong. MR. BERNARD: What's wrong? "
327,," DR. ROBB: You should be interested. MR. BERNARD: No, no. DR. ROBB: The state statute is harming your pet because it's outdated. You should be interested. Doc. 20-2, at 120 (emphasis added). Additionally, in his Second Amended Answer in the administrative proceeding, he argued 
that Conn. Agencies Regs. 22-359-1 is ""an unconstitutional delegation of powers,"" but also referred to it as a ""regulatory 
requirement . . . to administer the rabies vaccine in accordance with the private for-profit manufacture's label directions."" Doc. 5-
7, at 2. Further, in his initial TRO and PI papers, he refers to this as an ""outdated regulation."" Doc. 5-1, at 10. He also admits 
Section 22-359-1 is a regulation that ""arguably requires that a veterinarian follow for-profit manufacturer label instructions when 
administering rabies vaccines."" Id. at 13."
327,7," Dr. Robb explained in his memorandum of law in support of his TRO and PI that the ""Aesculapian Authority is the power of 
physicians to choose for their patient what they believe is the best practice,"" a ""power [that] is now available to Veterinarians 
because of companion animal practice."" Doc. 5-1, at 7 n.1 (citing Bernard E. Rollin, PhD, An Introduction to Veterinary Medical 
Ethics, Theory and Cases, at 84 (2d ed. 2006)). The adjective ""Aesculapian"" is derived from Aesculapius, the Greco-Roman god 
of medicine."
327,8," There are a several issues with Plaintiff's citations to Dr. Loeven's March 27, 2015 testimony. First, his name is Dr. Koen 
Loeven, not Dr. Jeffrey Loeven. Doc. 39-4, at 8. Second, this witness was called by DPH, and thus is not the Defendant Board's 
witness. Id. (""The Department [**11]  calls Dr. Loeven to the stand""). Third, and most significantly, in a section omitted from 
Plaintiff's excerpted submission from the transcript, Dr. Loeven testified that: ""My function was to review the case as to the 
standard of care under Connecticut statute and also veterinary guidelines and I believe that the use of half volume rabies 
vaccination is against State statute and also against the standard of care."" Id. at 10 (emphasis added); see also id. at 13 
(Plaintiff's letter response to Dr. Loeven ""did not change the main core of my review that the standard of veterinary care was 
violated""). "
328,9," Dr. Robb alleges that there are ""multiple doctors of veterinary medicine,"" such as Dr. Marcus Suppa, D.V.M., who either 
""ceased providing size-appropriate vaccination dosages or [] entertained the possibility of offering size-appropriate vaccination 
dosages and have decided not to offer them as a direct result of the Defendants' anticompetitive actions."" Id. ¶ 52."
328,10," Dr. Robb alleges that ""owners of pets who are concerned about or who have experienced VAAEs as a result of needless, one-
size-fits-all vaccine dosages have flocked to his practice."" Id. ¶ 50. Dr. Robb also alleges that ""[m]any individual pet owners on 
[sic] Connecticut would, if they had the opportunity, purchase vaccination lower-dosage services for their small pets."" Id. ¶ 53. 
Dr. Robb then identifies one [**15]  such patient who ""demand[s] and desire[s] half-dosages of vaccine for [her] smaller pets 
[and] will be unable to contract for them"" because of the Board's action. Id. "
329,11," Defendants argue that ""antitrust standing"" is a jurisdictional question. Doc. 39-1, at 14 n.6 (citing Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 
793, 800 (2d Cir. 1994)). First, Balaklaw does not address the question of the jurisdictional nature of antitrust standing. Second, 
while the question has been the subject of some debate, the Second Circuit has cited with approval the D.C. Circuit's ""holding 
that statutory standing under the antitrust laws is not a prerequisite to federal subject matter jurisdiction."" Lerner v. Fleet Bank, "
330,," N.A., 318 F.3d 113, 128 (2d Cir. 2003) (citing In re Lorazepam & Clorazepate Antitrust Litig., 289 F.3d 98, 107-08, 351 U.S. App. 
D.C. 223 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (""Unlike constitutional standing, this court's jurisdiction does not turn on antitrust standing."")); see also 
Paulsen v. Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, 773 F.3d 462, 468 (2d Cir. 2014) (""statutory standing is not jurisdictional 
unless Congress says so""). Therefore, the Court need not address Defendants' antitrust standing argument as part of its Article 
III jurisdictional analysis. "
331,12," In this regard, this case is distinct from Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 185 L. Ed. 2d 264 (2013), in which the 
Court rejected plaintiff's standing theory that it was injured through the adoption of certain costly measures it took in anticipation 
of the government's use of a regulatory power in a way [**23]  that might injure it. There, where the government had not even 
taken action with respect to the regulation at issue, the Court denied this standing theory because ""[a]llegations of a subjective 
'chill' are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective harm or a threat of specific future harm."" Id. at 1152. 
Here, where Dr. Robb is already facing regulatory sanctions (in the form of forcing him to refrain from providing lower dosages), 
he has caught a ""chill"" from standing in the face of the adverse wind of the administrative proceeding, and that chill is objective, 
not subjective, since Dr. Robb is required to defend himself against the administrative charges. Dr. Robb clearly stands in the 
face of a ""threat of specific future harm,"" a circumstance sufficient at this stage of the case to constitute Article III ""injury."" "
332,13," The Court acknowledges (as made clear below) that for purposes of establishing an antitrust claim, the ""ultimate existence of 
an [**27]  'agreement' under antitrust law . . . is a legal conclusion, not a factual allegation,"" and thereby should not be 
accepted as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Citigroup, Inc., 709 F.3d 129, 135 
(2d Cir. 2013). However, for purposes of standing, the Court may accept as true that the individual Defendants entered into an 
agreement without accepting the ""ultimate existence of an 'agreement'"" as that term is used with respect to the antitrust laws. 
See Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 264 (""an injury-in-fact,"" for standing purposes, ""differs from a 'legal interest'; 
an injury-in-fact need not be capable of sustaining a valid cause of action""). "
335,14," To the extent Dr. Robb refers to the Board's earlier May 4, 2015 denial of his motion to dismiss, that decision likewise can in 
no way be used to infer an illegal conspiracy to remove Dr. Robb from the market. In that decision, the Defendant Board properly 
rejected Dr. Robb's clearly erroneous argument for dismissal based on an entirely unsupportable interpretation of North Carolina 
State Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission, 135 S. Ct. 1101, 191 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015). See Doc. 5-9."
335,15," This motive cannot even apply to the two members of the Board who do not have any demonstrated pecuniary motive to 
remove Dr. Robb from the market, Defendants Bernhard and O'Neill. The claims against them are therefore not just without 
merit, but largely frivolous. "
336,16," As Dr. Robb admitted in his reply brief in support of his preliminary injunction, ""the Board's argument that Dr. Robb has 
'grossly misconstrued' the holding of North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners . . . is now moot because Dr. Robb's 
verified amended complaint (Dkt. 30) does not allege that the Board is violating the federal antitrust laws by way of its 
composition alone."" Doc. 31, at 4. "

Defendants as an affirmative defense is substantively identical to subsection 6a of the FTAIA. 740 ILCS 10/5; 15 U.S.C. § 6a.

341,11," The IAA adds to the language of the FTAIA that any harm to U.S. exporters must also affect the State of Illinois. 740 ILCS 
10/5. "
343,12," The Court notes that certain phraseology used by Defendants, such as ""extraterritorial,"" is not improper in the context of the 
Commerce Clause, but is more commonly associated with a Due Process challenge. See Watson v. Employers Liability 
Assurance Corp., 348 U.S. 66, 71 (1954) (referencing ""extraterritoriality due process doctrine""). To avoid confusion, and in light 
of Defendants' unequivocal statement that they are not arguing a Due Process defense in the instant motion, this Court limits its 
analysis in this Part II to whether the Commerce Clause presents a bar to certain of the State's claim-', and does not address 
whether application of the IAA to the alleged conduct would exceed the scope of the lAA's reach for Due Process purposes. "

346,16," Defendants also briefly argue at page one of their Surreply that the Attorney General, has waived its argument against their 
Commerce Clause defense by initially characterizing it as a ""due process"" defense. See Ill. S. Ct. Rule 341(h)(7) (""Points not 
argued are waived and shall not be raised in the reply brief); S. Rep. at 1. However. mischaracterization of an argument is not 
the same as failing to raise the point at all: the State's initial brief argues and cites case law (described at page 11, supra) in 
support of its position that Illinois may impose liability for conduct that extends beyond its borders that causes in-state harm. 
MSJ at 14. The argument that the IAA is applicable to Defendants' alleged conduct despite limits on extraterritorial state 
regulations was therefore not waived by the State's initial brief."

346,20," The court's reasoning in Epel relied in part on the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in another case called Pharmaceutical 
Research & Manufacturers Of America v. Walsh, where plaintiffs also challenged a state statute under the Commerce Clause. 
538 U.S. 644, 669 (2003). The regulation at issue in Walsh was a ""prior authorization"" process applied by the State of Maine to 
Medicaid sales from drug manufacturers who declined to enter into rebate agreements for program participants. Id. at 650. 
Plaintiff; in Walsh argued that the program constituted an impermissible extraterritorial regulation under the negative or donnant 
aspect of the Commerce Clause as iterated in Baldwin and Healy by regulating the terms of transactions occurring outside the "
347,," state, and also that the program discriminated against interstate commerce by subsidizing in-state sales. Id. at 669. The Walsh 
court found that the Maine law did not regulate out-of-state prices, either expressly or effectively, nor did it attempt to tie in-state 
prices to out-of-state prices, and held, without further explanation, that ""[t]he rule that was applied in Baldwin and Healy 
accordingly is not applicable to this case."" Id."

355,1," This understanding may exceed what would be properly understood in viewing the allegations [*12]  in the light most favorable 
to Plaintiff. Caterpillar was named by IronPlanet's President, but no one else was. It approaches speculation to infer from the 
cryptic remarks of IronPlanet's President that there was more than one other threat conveyed to IronPlanet, and there is no basis 
to choose between Komatsu and Volvo as the threatmaker if there was only one other threat. "
357,2," The term ""domestic incumbent manufacturers"" refers to ""somebody who's currently a manufacturer,"" whether or not that 
manufacturer happens to be a defendant in this case. (D.I. 44 at 109)."
357,3," The parties agree that the exclusive dealing allegations may be characterized as three separate cases, one against each of the 
Manufacturer Defendants. (D.I. 44 at 44, 46). For purposes of showing substantial foreclosure, ICP argues that the effects of 
each exclusive dealing arrangement can be aggregated under principles established in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 337 
U.S. 293, 69 S. Ct. 1051, 93 L. Ed. 1371 (1949). (D.I. 36 at p. 40; D.I. 44 at 46)."
357,4," ICP contends that since the Manufacturer Defendants have prevented them from using IronPlanet, there are no alternative 
means of distribution left. For purposes of this motion, the Court assumes, without deciding, that ICP's inability to use IronPlanet 
precludes the consideration of IronPlanet as an alternative distribution method."
357,5," It is not entirely clear what ICP means by this. From the context of the complaint, I take it to mean that SANY products are 
available for purchase in 5% of the nationwide market for new heavy construction equipment. While this may indicate that using 
IronPlanet would permit a seller to reach more of the market (as ICP states in the preceding sentence that ""[t]hrough IronPlanet, 
ICP would reach approximately 80 percent of end users""), it does not indicate that SANY has been unable to establish its own 
alternative means of distribution. (See id. ¶ 76). "

370,2," Because the Court finds that Trendsettah provided sufficient circumstantial evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as 
to Swisher's monopoly power, the Court need not consider whether Trendsettah has provided direct evidence to raise a genuine 
issue of material fact as to Swisher's monopoly power, particularly the requirement to show supracompetitive prices."
370,3," The Ninth Circuit regularly uses SSNIP analysis to determine the relevant market in antitrust cases. Saint Alphonsus Med. Ctr.-
Nampa Inc. v. St. Luke's Health Sys., Ltd., 778 F.3d 775, 784 (9th Cir. 2015) (""A common method to determine the relevant 
geographic market, and the one used by the district court, is to find whether a hypothetical monopolist could impose a 'small but 
significant nontransitory increase in price' (""SSNIP"") in the proposed market.""); Vesta Corp. v. Amdocs Mgmt. Ltd., 129 F. Supp. 
3d 1012, 2015 WL 5178073, at *8 (D. Or. 2015) (observing that courts ""often employ"" SSNIP analysis to determine the relevant 
market in antitrust claims related to horizontal mergers). SSNIP analysis determines the relevant market by testing whether a 
monopolist ""could profitably impose a small but significant and nontransitory price increase."" Theme Productions, Inc. v. News 
Amer. Mkt'g FSI, 546 F.3d 991, 1002 (9th Cir. 2008). ""If a significant number of customers would respond to a SSNIP by 
purchasing substitute products, the SSNIP would not be profitable for the hypothetical monopolist. If a monopolist could not 
profitably impose a SSNIP, the market definition should be expanded to include those substitute products that constrain the 
monopolist's pricing."" Id. (citations omitted)."
370,4, Swisher's assertion at oral argument that Trendsettah's expert performed no SSNIP analysis is simply mistaken. 
371,5," At the hearing on Swisher's motion for partial summary judgment, Swisher argued for the first time that it is entitled to summary 
judgment on Trendsettah's Florida antitrust claim because there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Swisher has 
made a prima facie case of market power: the relevant market for Trendsettah's Florida antitrust claim is Florida, see Fl. Stat. § 
542.19 (prohibiting monopolies only ""in this state""), and Swisher's market share for Florida is less than 65%. See Docket No. 67-
10 at 23 (stating that Swisher's share of non-tipped cigarillos for the region consisting of Mississippi, Alabama, western 
Tennessee, and Northwest Florida is between 53-62%, and Swisher's share for the region consisting of Georgia, Puerto Rico, 
the Caribbean Islands, and the rest of Florida is 35-41%). Swisher did not raise this argument in its moving papers, however. 
Docket No. 67-1 at 20-21. Accordingly, this argument is waived for present purposes. See Zamani v. Carnes, 491 F.3d 990, 997 
(9th Cir. 2007) (""The district court need not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief.""). "
372,6," In its complaint, Trendsettah also alleged that Swish's anticompetitive conduct included charging Trendsettah prices above 
those designated in the private label agreements, disparaging Trendsettah in the market, and removing Splitarillo products and 
advertisements from wholesaler and distributors' shelves. Docket No. 1 ¶¶ 31 (overcharging), 36-40 (disparagement and 
removal). Trendsettah provided no evidence of overcharging at summary judgment. Docket No. 81 at 58 (""undisputed"" that 
""Swisher never charged [Trendsettah] higher prices for Splitarillos than those set forth in the parties agreements""). Moreover, as 
discussed in Section 3.3 below, Trendsettah has failed to provide any evidence that Trendsettah suffered injury as a result of 
Swisher's alleged disparagement or its removal of Splitarillo products and advertisements. E.g., Id. at 61 (""Undisputed that 
[Trendsettah] lacks knowledge that any of its customers stopped doing business as a result of the specific acts of Swisher 
removing Splitarillos products or advertising and marketing materials from stores.""). "
374,7," As relevant to Trendsettah's trade libel claim, the declarant also stated that part of the following statement is not true: ""No 
Swisher representative has made statements to, or engaged in any conduct at, SM Brothers, Inc., that disparaged Splitarrillos 
brand cigarillos, Trendsettah USA, Inc., or Trend Settah, Inc., that had the purpose of reducing or stopping Splitarillos brand 
cigarillos purchases or sales, or that had the purpose of undermining Splitarillos brand cigarillos, Trendsettah USA, Inc. or Trend 
Settah, Inc. in any way."" Docket No. 88 at 3. The declarant does not identify what part of that statement is false, however. Id."
374,8," In response to a question whether any company ""reduce[d] the volume of their business with Trendsettah as a result of 
Swisher's alleged disparagement of Trendsettah,"" Akrum Alrahib, founder of Trendsettah, stated that ""[he] wouldn't know what 
the individual wholesaler did or --intended to do after they heard that."" Docket No. 83-1 at 13."
374,9," The parties do not dispute that SM Brothers, Inc. has continued doing business with Trendsettah. Docket No. 81 at 65."
374,10," The Court is skeptical that a plaintiff can maintain a claim for tortious interference with a third-party contract against a 
defendant when, as here, the tortious interference arises wholly from conduct that constitutes breach of a separate, unrelated 
contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. Said another way, there must be some evidence of breach of the third-party 
contract, typically by showing that the third party has been induced to breach. See, e.g., Law Offices of David J. Stern, P.A. v. 
SCOR Reinsurance Corp., 354 F. Supp. 2d 1338, 1341 (S.D. Fla. 2005); Chicago Title, 832 So. 2d at 814 (""Chicago Title 
offered no evidence and raised no issue of material fact as to whether Stewart Title intended to procure the breach of the 
contracts between Chicago Title and the Alday Agencies.""). To allow such a claim would, in effect, convert an ordinary breach of 
contract claim to an additional tort claim when the defendant's breach of its contract with the plaintiff also affects the plaintiff's 
third-party contracts. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff should instead seek consequential damages for the ensuing breach 
of its third-party contract, see Hadley v. Baxendale, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (Ex. Ch. 1854), and not bring a separate tort claim. The 
Court nevertheless declines to grant summary judgment on Trendsettah's tortious interference with contract claim on this basis 
because, in any event, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to either breach, causation, or resulting damages. "
375,11," Trendsettah's assertion at oral argument that Swisher did not argue lack of breach, causation, or damages in its motion for 
partial summary judgment is mistaken. See Docket No. 67-1 at 28 (""Plaintiffs also fail to show that they lost any business as a 
result of the alleged interference.""), 29 (""There is no record evidence to show that Swisher's alleged actions influenced, induced, 
or coerced even one company to breach its contract or avoid doing business with [Trendsettah]."") (internal quotations and 
alterations removed). "

383,18," Stockholder plaintiffs who seek expedition benefit from the most favorable standard available under our law for assessing the 
merits of a claim—""colorability""—and from the sensible policy of this Court to attempt to resolve disclosure claims before 
stockholders are asked to vote. See Ortsman v. Green, 2007 Del. Ch. LEXIS 29, 2007 WL 702475, at *2 (Del. Ch. Feb. 28,

384,24," ""Confirmatory"" discovery is discovery taken after an agreement-in-principle to settle a case has been reached. Theoretically, it 
is an opportunity for plaintiffs' counsel to ""confirm"" that the settlement terms are reasonable—that is, to probe further the 
strengths and weaknesses of the claims relative to the consideration for the proposed settlement. In reality, given that plaintiffs' 
counsel already have resigned themselves to settle on certain terms, confirmatory discovery rarely leads to a 
renunciation [**22]  of the proposed settlement and, instead, engenders activity more reflective of ""going through the motions.""

388,46," In contrast to the settlement context, the Court does not need to weigh the ""get"" of the supplemental disclosures against the

Accordingly, an award of fees in the mootness fee scenario may be appropriate for supplemental disclosures of less significance 
than would be necessary to sustain approval of a settlement. The amount of the fee in the mootness scenario, however, would 
be commensurate with the value of the benefit conferred. Thus, for example, a supplemental disclosure of nominal value would 
warrant only a nominal fee award."

394,79," Meinhart, plaintiffs' expert, points out that not all stockholders can access all of this information because some of the forward-
looking data are available only from proprietary fee-based services. It may be correct that not all of these data would be freely or 
easily obtainable. A fair summary, however, does not require disclosure of sufficient [**55]  data to allow stockholders to perform 
their own valuation. And it certainly does not require disclosure of underlying data that stockholders could obtain on their own, 
even if doing so would involve some cost or investment of time. Meinhart also opines that the multiples show a high level of 
dispersion, but he fails to explain how that information undermines J.P. Morgan's analysis or is otherwise informative considering 
that J.P. Morgan explicitly stated that its analysis was not strictly quantitative in nature. See Proxy at 126-27 (""J.P. Morgan did 
not rely solely on the quantitative results . . . . Based on various judgments concerning relative comparability of each of the 
selected companies to Trulia, as well its experience with the industry . . . J.P. Morgan selected a range of revenue and Adjusted 
EBITDA multiples that it believed reflected an appropriate range of multiples applicable to Trulia."")."

394,81," See id. The supplemental disclosure in Celera added more categories of summary data, namely the high, low, median, and 
mean multiples. This distinction is immaterial. The point of a fair summary is to summarize the methodologies and assumptions 
the financial advisor used in its analysis. Here, the Proxy fairly summarizes J.P. Morgan's use of multiples in its trading multiples 
analysis."
394,82," Plaintiffs also rely on a transcript ruling in Turberg v. ArcSight, C.A. No. 5821-VCL (Del. Ch. Sept. 20, 2011) (TRANSCRIPT). 
As in Celera, the initial description in ArcSight did not have any multiples at all. The plaintiff obtained a full description of the 
analysis comparable to the depiction that would appear in a board book. The Court praised that disclosure in the context of a "
395,," non-adversarial presentation regarding settlement approval. The case is distinguishable because, unlike here, no summary 
multiples were initially provided to stockholders."

period, its 2028 EBITDA would amount to nearly $10 trillion, more than half the current GDP of the United States."
395,88," See Rosenbaum & Pearl, supra note 83, at 132 (""The perpetuity growth rate is typically chosen on the basis of the company's 
expected long-term industry growth rate, which generally tends to be within a range of 2% to 4% (i.e., nominal GDP growth).""). "
396,89," As noted above, after the settlement hearing, the parties commendably agreed to narrow the release to exclude ""Unknown 
Claims,"" foreign claims, and claims arising under state or federal antitrust law. Nevertheless, even if the Supplemental 
Disclosures had provided sufficient consideration to warrant the ""give"" of a release of claims, which they did not, the scope of the 
revised release still would have been too broad to support a fair and reasonable settlement because the revised release was not 
limited to disclosure claims and fiduciary duty claims concerning the decision to enter the merger."
396,90," Because I reject the proposed settlement, I do not address the issue of class certification, although stockholder classes in

398,1," The factual background is derived from the undisputed evidence of record and the disputed evidence viewed in the light most 
favorable to the nonmoving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202

MOFCOM (ECF No. 284, Part I ¶ 19), short for ""Ministry of Commerce."" (ECF No. 268-22 ¶ 3.) For simplicity, all three of these

400,4," In 2004, proposals to ""set the bauxite export quota at one million tons"" and ""to set 180 as the minimum price for 2005 export 
quota"" ""failed to pass in the enlarged council meeting."" (ECF No. 268-10 at 2.) Proposals ""to set the bauxite export quota at 1 
million metric tons for 2007,"" ""to maintain the level of bauxite export quota at 970,000,"" and ""to set the minimum price for 2007 
bauxite export quota at 130/ton,"" ""100/ton,"" ""60/ton,"" and ""80/ton"" all ""failed to pass in the enlarged council meeting"" in 2006. 
(ECF No. 268-12 at 2-3.) During the 2007 meeting, proposals to set the 2008 bauxite export quota at 950,000, 1 million, and 1.1 
million metric tons similarly failed. (ECF No. 268-13 at 1-2.) A 2009 proposal that the 2010 bauxite export [**11]  quota ""be cut 
down by 30%-50% of total volumes"" failed to pass as well. (ECF No. 268-17 at 1.)"
400,5," Only one of the Bidding Committee's announcements concerning the 2009 bauxite export quota was produced here. The 
conclusion that the 2009 quota was 930,000 primarily is based on a Bauxite Branch proposal at the 2009 meeting that the quota 
""remain at 930,000 tons."" (ECF No. 268-17, at 1). It is supported by the Bidding Committee's first announcement on bauxite 
export quotas for 2009, which specifies 465,000 tons available. (ECF No. 268-62, at 2). Announcements in other years show 
that 50 percent of the total annual quota was released with each announcement. (ECF Nos. 268-55, 268-56, 268-57, 268-58, 
268-60, 268-61, 268-63, 268-64, 268-65, 268-66.)"
400,6," According to the minutes, the only other relevant resolution that ""passed and came into resolution"" was one to ""maintain the 
minimum price for the bauxite export quota at 130/ton,"" which passed during the 2008 Bauxite Branch meeting. (ECF No. 268-15 
at 2.) No evidence was produced to indicate what the Bidding Committee set the minimum price for the quota following this 
resolution. "
401,7," In plaintiff's original complaint, it named the following as defendants: Nanchuan Minerals Group Co. Ltd.; Jersey Mineral 
Processing Co. Ltd.; CMP Ltd., Minelco Tianjin Minerals Co. Ltd.; Minelco, Inc., USA; and LKAB. (ECF No. 1.) Due to ineffective 
service of process, LKAB, Minelco Tianjin Minerals Co. Ltd., and Minelco, Inc., USA were dismissed by stipulation (ECF Nos. 16, 
43), and Nanchuan Minerals Group Co. Ltd. [**15]  and Jersey Mineral Processing Co. Ltd. were terminated. Plaintiff filed its first 
amended complaint on July 17, 2009, naming only Bosai and Tianjin as defendants. (ECF No. 92.) Bosai was previously known 
as Nanchuan Minerals Group Co. Ltd. and Tianjin was previously known as Jersey Mineral Processing Co. Ltd. (ECF No. 92, ¶¶

417,1," The class action in the Northern District of California (Los Gatos Mercantile, Inc. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 13-cv-13-

Antitrust Litig., 959 F. Supp. 2d 799 (D. Md. 2013). It should also be noted that while Tronox was initially a defendant and an 
alleged co-conspirator in the Maryland case, it later declared bankruptcy. See In re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust Litig., 959 F. Supp.

422,4," Dr. Williams relies heavily on Professor Kovacic's article for this part of his opinion. In the section upon which Dr. Williams 
relies, Professor Kovacic himself notes: ""Other transactions require scrutiny, such as patent licensing, cross-licensing, and 
patent pools, as well as the settlement of seemingly frivolous lawsuits."" William E. Kovacic et al., Plus Factors and Agreement in 
Antitrust Law, 110 Mich. L. Rev. 393,423(2011). "
424,5," It is undisputed that DuPont did not actually attend the General Meetings of the TDMA until 2010. (D.I. 242, Ex. 7 at 159; D.I. 
245, Ex. 70 at 181-82; D.I. 396 at 11-12). Valspar states that this is immaterial, as DuPont attended other CEFIC meetings which 
were concurrent with the General Meetings. (D.I. 396 at 11-2; see also D.I. 249, Exs. 179-81). The Court will assume, for 
purposes of this motion, that DuPont and the other defendants [**27]  were at quarterly CEFIC meetings of some sort—and 
therefore were capable of communicating with each other in person—even though DuPont did not attend the General Meetings."
424,6," The two 2009 DuPont emails seem, to put it charitably, inconsistent with the idea that DuPont had agreed to fix prices seven 
years earlier. "
425,7," Contrary to Valspar's urging at oral argument, there is no nefarious inference of prior knowledge that can be derived from this 
communication. (D.I. 396 at 62-63). This conversation occurred after not only Millennium's announcement, but also the 
announcements from DuPont, Huntsman, and Kronos. (D.I. 247, Ex. 106 at 400)."
425,8," This is how the quote appears in Valspar's brief. (D.I. 286 at 25). The context is important, however. Mr. Cemy wrote this email 
in response to one from Kronos executive Joe Maas, where Mr. Maas informed Mr. Cemy that the Israeli paint company 
Tambour asked for a reduction in price for titanium dioxide. (D.I. 298, Ex. 407). Mr. Maas thought Kronos should comply and 
""take [that] business unless it [would] really [have] an adverse pricing impact in the market."" (Id.). In response, Mr. Cemy stated 
that ""such decisions [would] have an adverse impact on prices,"" and that prices [**30]  were higher in the Near East ""as a result 
of significant price increases having been implemented by competition."" (Id.). Mr. Cemy went on to state that Kronos should not 
lower prices for Tambour, as that would thereby ""give a signal to competition"" about Kronos' ""bidding . . . for the ENAP 
business."" (Id.). This email, as a whole, is thus best understood as one in which Kronos—knowing how its decisions may affect 
the market—sought to avoid providing its competitors with information about its activities. Therefore, not only does this email fail 
to support a nefarious inference of conspiracy, it clearly shows a perfectly legitimate, competitive interest. The Cemy excerpt is 
characteristic of many of the statements to which Valspar cites in support of its theory. That is, divorced from context, the quote 
is ambiguous. In context, the quote is not ambiguous. Instead, it can only be read as probative of ""legitimate behavior."" See In re 
Citric Acid Litig., 191 F.3d 1090, 1099 (9th Cir. 1999). "
426,9," It is clear from context that ""our collective needs"" refers to Millennium's needs, not the needs of Millennium and its competitors. 
Mr. Vercollone uses the phrase after separately asking four Millennium employees whether the statistics would meet their 
individual needs. "
428,10," The Third Circuit's Chocolate Confectionary decision, decided after the Maryland Class Action ruling, is, I think, quite 
instructive. While it remains clear that careful consideration of the evidentiary record is necessary, it seems to me that Chocolate 
Confectionary might also be understood as suggesting that, in the antitrust oligopoly context, summary judgment cannot be 
avoided simply by having amassed a significant amount of ambiguous evidence. See In re Chocolate, 801 F.3d at 396-97, 397 
n.9 (""[A] plaintiff relying on ambiguous evidence alone cannot raise a reasonable inference of a conspiracy sufficient to survive 
summary judgment."" (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 597 n.21, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L.

460,84," Dr. Rausser estimates that, together, the Manufacturer Defendants made up approximately forty-six percent of Pool's total 
purchases during the relevant time period. Dr. Rausser does not further break down that number. See Rausser Initial Report, 
April 10, 2014, at 37. According to the defendants' experts, Pentair's sales to Pool accounted for anywhere from twenty to 
twenty-five percent of Pool's total purchases during the relevant period. This is almost twice as large as Pool's next largest 
supplier, Hayward. See Johnson Initial Report, at 29; Elzinga DPP Report, April 10, 2014, at 16-17. "
472,1," Because there are multiple Motions, Responses, and Replies, I will refer and cite to them by their ECF docket number."
472,2," Plaintiffs name as defendants Jay Lowe and Connie and Jay Lowe Antiques. I refer to them collectively as ""Lowe."" "
473,3," Although it is not attached as an exhibit to the AC, the Reeses reference the agreement in the AC and do not dispute that Ex. B 
is the actual agreement. Accordingly, I consider it as part of the pleadings in deciding the pending Motions to dismiss. See W. 
Penn Allegheny Health Sys. v. UPMC, 627 F.3d 85, 97 n. 6 (3d Cir. 2010) (stating that, HN5[
] as a general rule, the court may 
not consider on a motion to dismiss matters extraneous to the pleadings, but an exception exists for documents ""integral to or 
explicitly relied upon in the complaint""). "
474,4," Also named as defendants are MAD, S. Clayton Pennington, editor of MAD, and Kate Pennington, managing editor of MAD 
(collectively with Solis-Cohen, the ""MAD Defendants""). (Id. ¶¶ 13-14.) The AC contains no substantive allegations concerning 
the Penningtons."
474,5," Plaintiffs do not specifically state which Defendants they intend to hold liable under Count II and Count III. I assume they intend 
to include P&P, the individual Pook Defendants, and the MAD defendants. I note that while these Counts do not mention him, 
Lowe has raised an argument why the claims should be dismissed. There is no allegation that Lowe was responsible for the 
placement of his newtique on the cover of the sale catalogue; indeed the Reeses entitle that portion of the AC ""Pook's Promotion 
of Lowe's ""Newtiques"" . . . . (AC at page 15.) While there is [**10]  no allegation that he published the allegedly negative 
comment in MAD about the quality of the Reeses' collection, he is quoted in the Article. Accordingly, I will address this aspect of 
the claim when I discuss Lowe's Motion."
474,6," Count IV also does not specify which defendants Plaintiffs intend to name. They mention only that the count is based on ""Pook 
& Pook sale preparation by Lowe/Caffarella."" (Id. ¶ 198.) I note, however, that the MAD Defendants have included an argument 
why the Sherman Act count should be dismissed as to them. (See MAD Defs.' Mem. at 11-12.) In their Response, the Reeses 
have not addressed that argument, and only discuss the Sherman Act claim with regard to P&P, the individual Pook Defendants, 
Lowe, and Caffarella. (See Resp. at 60-63.) Accordingly, I assume that Plaintiffs intended to assert Sherman Act liability only 
against P&P, the individual Pook Defendants, Lowe, and Caffarella."
474,7," Count X also does not state which defendants are sought to be held liable. It merely recited ""Defendants have breached duties 
owed the Reeses."" (AC ¶ 228.) I assume that Count X includes all defendants. "
475,8," The Third Circuit has also recognized that bankruptcy jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 157(a) extends to cases ""arising under,"" 
""arising in,"" and ""related to"" bankruptcy jurisdiction. In re W.R. Grace & Co., 591 F.3d 164, 171 (3d Cir. 2009). ""Arising under"" 
and ""arising in"" claims are ""core"" bankruptcy claims; claims ""related to"" a bankruptcy case are not. Stoe v. Flaherty, 436 F.3d 
209, 219 (3d Cir. 2006). "
476,9," The Third Circuit has similarly held that claims [**16]  that ""arise in"" bankruptcy include those ""that by their nature, not their 
particular factual circumstances, could only arise in the context of a bankruptcy case."" Stoe, 436 F.3d at 218 (citing Halper v. 
Halper, 164 F.3d 830, 836 (3d Cir. 1999) (stating that a proceeding is ""core"" ""if it is a proceeding that, by its nature, could arise 
only in the context of a bankruptcy case"") (quotation omitted) (emphasis added); 1 Collier on Bankruptcy § 3.01[4][c][iv] at 3-
31). "
478,10," The balance of Count II concerns only P&P, the individual Pook Defendants, Lowe, and Caffarella. The only other time the 
MAD Defendants are mention is the assertion that the placement of the newtiques on the cover of the sale catalogue ""carried 
through antique malls and the nation's leading antique journal — the Maine Antique's Digest, both falsely represented, 
disparaged the Reeses' collection while inflating the value of Lowe's fake newtiques."" (AC ¶ 170.)"
478,11," I discuss at length — and reject — whether the Article can constitute ""commercial advertising or promotion"" below in the 
consideration [**23]  of Defendant Lowe's Motion."
478,12," The Article is referenced and quoted in the AC but not attached thereto. I consider it as part of the pleadings in deciding the 
pending Motions to dismiss. W. Penn Allegheny Health Sys., 627 F.3d at 97 n. 6. It stated in pertinent part: As with many regional auction houses, Pook & Pook in Downington, Pennsylvania, will sell any collection that comes along. 
. . . When a local collector wanted to downsize his huge toy collection, Pook & Pook agreed to try its first toy sale. . . . Everyone in the toy world seemed to know the major consignor was Carter Reese, longtime collector who bought toys that 
he loved before collectors got hung up on condition. It didn't matter to him if the toy had replaced figures, was repainted, or 
if much of the paint was missing. If the toy had charm and was cheap, he bought it. ""The sale was a good test of the [**25]  middle market,"" said dealer Jay Lowe of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who came to the 
sale and did some buying. The market has changed; condition makes a big difference. It used to be if a toy was an 8.5 or a 
9, it could bring top dollar. Now it has to be 9.5 to 9.9 perfect, and if it isn't, it is not easy to sell, and the price differences 
are enormous."" "
479,," Lowe explained that's because in the 1970's and 1980's toys were rare, and fewer than 5% of the collectors wanted toys 
that were perfect. Now some toys that were rare are not rare anymore, and 60% of the toy collectors want toys to be 98% 
perfect. ""It's the same thing with coins,"" Lowe went on. ""One coin might sell for $1500, and one a little better goes for $3000, and 
one still better, $10,000. And it is the same with furniture. A chest with a rich old surface will bring one price, and one of the 
same forms that has been refinished [will bring] sixty to seventy percent less. The pendulum has swung. Huge prices are 
paid for condition."" Lowe remembered a time when he could buy a toy for $800 that was missing a figure and needing a little repair and give it 
to a fellow to fix it and sell it for $1500 and have made a nice profit. Not anymore. [**26]  ""Now I buy a toy for $800, and it 
costs me $400 to fix it, and I hope to sell it for $1500. Condition is king,"" he said. . . . The consensus was that may of the toys that Pook offered brought all they were worth, and there were a lot of bargains for 
dealers who knew what they were buying. . . . Condition drives all markets because collectors with deep pockets see perfect toys as investments. There was very little for 
them at this middle-market sale. . . . Some thought Pook should have employed a toy expert who would have included condition reports in the lot descriptions 
as many specialty toy auctioneers do, but others said the fact that this toy sale was not at a specialized toy auctioneer 
brought out the trade, who thought they would have a chance to make a discovery or two. (ECF 25-2.)"
479,13," Count VII, alleging injurious falsehood, also references Section 623A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. This section also 
has an actual malice element since it too requires that the defendant ""knows that the statement is false or acts in reckless 
disregard of its truth or falsity."" (Id.) Finally, Count VII also references Restatement Section 626, ""Disparagement of Quality,"" 
which specifically incorporates the ""rules of liability . . . stated in § 623A."" Restatement (Second) of Torts § 626. Accordingly, I 
find that [**27]  every iteration of the injurious falsehood tort pled in Count VII contains an actual malice element."
479,14," See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964) (defining the actual malice 
standard)."
479,15," They also spend many pages asserting that they have suffered defamation, a claim they have not pled in the AC. (See Resp. 
at 49-53.) "
482,16," Count I of the AC does not state clearly to whom ""Pook"" refers. AC ¶ 16 states that Ron and Debra Pook would be referred to 
collectively as the ""Pooks."" AC ¶ 17 states that Pook & Pook, Inc. would be referred to as ""Pook & Pook."" The individual Pook 
family members are referred to individually by their first names. (See AC ¶¶ 20-22.) I assume that the use of ""Pook"" in Count I 
refers to P&P and not the individual Pook Defendants."
482,17, Caffarella has not joined this argument. 
484,18," As I previously noted, although Count II does not mention him, Lowe has raised an argument why the claim should be 
dismissed. There is no allegation that Lowe was responsible for the placement of his newtique on the cover of the sale 
catalogue. Accordingly, I limit the discussion of liability to the allegedly negative comment in the Article about the quality of the 
Reeses' collection sold at the auction, based upon Lowe's quotes in the Article."
484,19," See HN26[
] 42 Pa.C.S. § 5523 (providing one year statute of limitation on claims of commercial disparagement, false light and injurious falsehood); Pro Golf Mfg., 809 A.2d at 245 (holding that ""one-year limitations period found in Section 5523(1) 
governs an action for commercial disparagement""); Little v. City & Cty. of Philadelphia, Civ. A. No. 07-5361, 2008 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 57972, 2008 WL 2704579, at *4 (E.D. Pa. July 3, 2008) (holding that false light claim is subject to a one-year statute of 
limitations of Section 5523). "
486,20," Although Plaintiffs quote Section 2(c) of the Robinson-Patman Act in the AC, neither side has addressed Count IV in terms of 
this statute. It provides: HN28[
] (c) It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of such commerce, to pay or grant, or 
to receive or accept anything of value as a commission, brokerage, or other compensation, or any allowance or discount in 
lieu thereof, except for services rendered in connection with the sale or purchase of goods, wares, or merchandise, either to 
the other party to such transaction or to an agent, representative, or other intermediary therein where such intermediary is 
acting in fact for or on behalf, or is subject to the direct or indirect control, of any party to such transaction other than the 
person by whom such compensation is so granted or paid."
486,15," U.S.C. § 13(c). HN29[
] This provision ""was designed to eliminate the competitive advantage large buyers and sellers 
attained over their smaller competitors by virtue of their economic clout and bargaining power."" Stephen Jay Photography, Ltd. v. 
Olan Mills, Inc., 903 F.2d 988, 991 n. 5 (4th Cir. 1990). Section 2(c) ""encompasses cases of commercial bribery tending to 
undermine the fiduciary relationship between a buyer and its [**50]  agent, representative, or other intermediary in a transaction 
involving the sale or purchase of goods."" Harris v. Duty Free Shoppers Ltd. P'ship, 940 F.2d 1272, 1274 (9th Cir. 1991) (citation 
omitted). For a finding of commercial bribery, plaintiff ""must show that the illegal payments in question crossed the line from 
buyer to seller or vice-versa."" Envtl. Tectonics v. W.S. Kirkpatrick, Inc., 847 F.2d 1052, 1066 (3d Cir. 1988), aff'd, 493 U.S. 400, 
110 S. Ct. 701, 107 L. Ed. 2d 816 (1990); see also Ellwood City v. Pennsylvania. Power Co., 570 F. Supp. 553, 562 (W.D. PA. 
1983) (noting ""intrastate sales are subject to the Robinson—Patman Act as long as the sales remain in the flow of interstate 
commerce""). The AC also cites and quotes 15 U.S.C. § 13a, prohibiting price discrimination. Because there is no allegation of commercial bribery or price discrimination, I find these aspects of Count IV are also subject to 
dismissal. "
489,21," Lowe also argues that many provisions of the AC should be struck under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) because they 
constitute immaterial, impertinent and scandalous material. (ECF 27 at 34.) HN38[
] Rule 12(f) provides: ""[t]he court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f). 
HN39[
] ""Motions to strike function 'to clean up the pleadings, streamline litigation, and avoid unnecessary forays into 
immaterial matters.'"" Mitchell v. Cmty. Educ. Ctrs., Inc., Civ. A. No. 14-5026, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105718, 2015 WL 4770652, 
at *11 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 11, 2015) (quoting [**60]  McInerney v. Moyer Lumber & Hardware, Inc., 244 F. Supp. 2d 393, 402 (E.D. 
Pa. 2002)). HN40[
] ""'The standard for striking a complaint or a portion of it is strict, and only allegations that are so unrelated 
to the plaintiffs' claims as to be unworthy of any consideration should be stricken.'"" Ford-Greene v. NHS, Inc., 106 F. Supp. 3d 
590, 2015 WL 2395409, at *21 (E.D. Pa. 2015) (quoting Steak Umm Co., LLC v. Steak 'Em Up, Inc., Civ. A. No. 09-2857, 2009 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101357, 2009 WL 3540786, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 29, 2009)). Consequently, ""[m]otions to strike are generally 
disfavored by courts and will be denied unless the allegations 'have no possible relation to the controversy and may cause 
prejudice to one of the parties, or if the allegations confuse the issues in the case.'"" Mitchell, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105718, 
2015 WL 4770652, at *11 (quoting Natale v. Winthrop Res. Corp., Civ. A. No. 07-4686, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54358, 2008 WL 
2758238, at *14 (E.D. Pa. July 9, 2008)). Many of the provisions Lowe seeks to strike use bright purple prose to describe the Defendants' actions. Most of it, however, I 
find is related to the allegations of the claims that I find can survive. However, the Motion is due to be granted as to the following 
material: (1) Heading ""V. Pooling"" and ¶¶ 81-82 (describing an alleged 1987 conviction suffered by Ron Pook ; and (2) Heading 
""VII. The 'Second Rape' of the Reeses."" None of this material is related to the surviving claims and may cause prejudice or 
confusion. "

539,7," This motion and court order did not include the Thomson and TDA settlement since that settlement was not entered into until 
June 10, 2015, after the motion for preliminary approval was filed. "
541,8," The following factual and procedural recitation is relevant to the discussion of both approval of the settlement and the request 
for fees and expenses. "
542,9," The DAPs are another group of plaintiffs in this case that purchased CRT Products directly from defendants. They include 
computer and television manufacturers such as Dell and Sharp and retailers such as Target, Best Buy and Costco. The DAPs 
joined this litigation between 2011 and 2014."
542,10," By Order dated February 9, 2015, the Court vacated the trial date. Docket No. 3515. "
544,11," On November 18, 2015, the Court issued an order reminding the parties that, pursuant to the Court's previous order at page 6 
of Docket No. 4077, ""motions and other papers directed to the attention of the Special Master are to be served on him but not, in 
the first instance, to be filed with the Court."" Docket No. 4195. Following that Order, the Special Master arranged [*194]  for all 
communications, other than routine e-mails about ministerial matters, to be filed with him using the JAMS Electronic Filing 
System called ""Case Anywhere."" Docket No. 4201."
544,12," On December 11, 2015, objectors Josef Cooper and Francis Scarpulla filed a motion with the Court asking to be appointed 
Co-Lead Counsel in this case to represent all consumers with claims in the ""non-repealer"" states. Docket No. 4241. At the 
January 5, 2016 hearing, when asked about this motion and whether it could render the Special Master's Report and 
Recommendation moot if granted, Messrs. Cooper and Scarpulla represented that this should not be the case since, if their 
request is granted, they envisioned only making the same arguments that they have made here in the context of their objections 
but now they would merely be making those arguments in their new capacity. The Court is scheduled to hear this motion on 
February 18, 2016."
544,13," Reply briefs from Lead Counsel were not considered in the Court's original scheduling order. See Docket No. 4185. However, 
Lead Counsel requested the opportunity to file a reply briefs on December 13, 2015 because the Objectors' reply briefs had 
gone ""far beyond replying to the [*195]  IPP's initial submissions and raise[d] a number of new matters."" The Special Master 
granted Lead Counsel's request on December 14, 2015, permitting Lead Counsel to file responsive briefs, not to exceed 20 
pages, by December 23, 2015. In that order, the Special Master delineated the five specific issues that Lead Counsel could 
address in his responsive briefing. On December 14, 2015, Mr. Scarpulla requested that he be allowed to file a sur-reply if Lead 
Counsel were to be permitted to submit further reply briefs. The Special Master denied Mr. Scarpulla's request."
544,14," The Special Master reserved jurisdiction on the issue of allocation of attorneys' fees to decide after the Court issues its final 
award on approval of the settlement and attorneys' fees/costs and incentive awards. "
545,15, One Supplemental Objection was filed at Docket 4144 by the same objectors who filed an objection at Docket 4119.
545,16," One objection, by Objector [*196]  Johnson (Docket No. 4128), was received on 10/16/15 after the 10/9/15 deadline. The 
Special Master has considered it notwithstanding the late filing. The objection of Saik (Docket No. 4140) was filed late, on 
10/24/15, but admissible evidence confirmed that it was delivered to the Clerk's office on 10/9/15."
545,17," Lead Counsel contends that Messrs. Scarpulla and Cooper lack standing to object to the Proposed Settlements since they are 
not members of the class and they are bringing the objections on behalf of the IPPs as a whole rather than on behalf of an 
individual class member client. Messrs. Scarpulla and Cooper contend that as class counsel they have standing in light of their 
fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the class. See In re TracFone Unlimited Serv. Plan. Litig., 112 F. Supp. 3d 993, 2015 
WL 4051882, at * 11 (N.D.Cal. July 2, 2015) (objector has no legal standing to object to a settlement unless he can demonstrate 
that he is an aggrieved class member); but see Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 960 (9th Cir. 2003) (""class counsel 
ultimately owe their fiduciary responsibility to the class as a I whole and are therefore not bound by the views of the named 
plaintiffs regarding any settlement""). The Special Master concludes that the proper approach is to consider the arguments set 
forth in their briefs in furtherance of the Court's fiduciary duty to the class to assure that the settlement is fair. See Rodriguez v. 
Disner, 688 F.3d 645, 656 (9th Cir. 2012); In re Pet Food Products Liab. Litig. 629 F.3d 333, 349 (3d Cir. 2010) [""trial judges 
bear the important responsibility of protecting absent class members,"" and must be ""assur[ed] that the settlement represents 
adequate compensation for the release [*199]  of the class claims.""]; Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 593 (3d Cir. 
2010) [stressing that ""[t]he purpose of Rule 23(e) is to protect the unnamed members of the class,"" and that a ""district court acts 
as a fiduciary"" for absent class members]. "
546,18," The Settlement Amounts have been deposited into an escrow account and invested. If the Settlements are finally approved, 
any interested earned thereon (together with the Settlement Amounts) will become part of the Settlement Fund."
546,19," It should be noted that the Proposed Settlement Class is identical to the class preliminarily approved by the Court with respect 
to the settlements at issue here (Docket No. 3906) as well as the Settlement Class finally approved by the Court in conjunction 
with IPP's settlement with LG (Docket No. 2542). The LG Court-approved settlement also involved an identical release of all 
claims nationwide."
546,20," Residents of [*204]  Illinois, Oregon and Washington are excluded from the Nationwide Class because the Attorneys General 
of those states are suing the Defendants on behalf of residents of those states."
546,21," All of the Indirect Purchaser State Classes are the same except that three states — Hawaii, Nebraska and Nevada — have 
slightly shorter damages periods because the statutes allowing indirect purchasers to bring an antitrust claim for damages in 
these three states were enacted after March 1, 1995, the beginning of the alleged Class Period. The Court dismissed claims 
based on purchases made prior to the enactment of these statutes on the grounds that the state legislatures did not intend the 
statutes to apply retroactively. See In Re: Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litig., 738 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1025-26 (N.D.Cal. 
2010). "
547,22," It should be noted that the Court has already certified 22 indirect purchaser state classes which are defined similarly to the 
Indirect Purchaser State Classes proposed here (Docket Nos. 1742 and 1950). The Settlement Class proposed here is different 
in that the Class that was already certified: (1) requires that the Indirect Purchaser State Class Members be residents of the 
respective States, whereas here, the Settlement Class requires only that the purchase was made in one of [*205]  the States; (2) 
is limited to televisions and monitors containing CRTs, whereas the Settlement Class here includes CRTs, televisions and 
monitors containing CRT and other products containing CRTs; and (3) consists of the Indirect Purchaser State Classes defined 
above, whereas the Settlement Class here also includes the Nationwide Class. "
548,23," Neither the Report & Recommendation in DRAM nor the Court's approval of that Report & Recommendation can be found on 
Westlaw. The Special Master will therefore cite directly from the docket version of this document throughout this Report & 
Recommendation. "
549,24," Objectors Scarpulla and Cooper point to language in Lead Counsel's November 19, 2015, motion brief in which Lead Counsel 
stated that ""Lead Counsel was appointed to represent the interests of purchasers in the 22 indirect purchaser state classes. He 
has no duty to represent [*213]  purchasers in other states."" Motion for Final Approval, p. 43, n.71. Objectors take this quote out 
of context. Lead Counsel was not stating that he never advanced the interests of the Nationwide class in this litigation. Instead, 
he was merely explaining that, during the litigation phase of the case, he had ""no duty to represent"" members of the Nationwide 
Class for purposes of approaching attorneys general about pursuing potential parens patriae actions. Lead Counsel sufficiently 
explained this distinction in his Reply brief. There, he notes that at the settlement stage, he had a duty to represent all members 
of the proposed settlement class vigorously which, as the Special Master has observed, is exactly what Lead Counsel did. "
554,26," All Statewide Damages class members will be required to complete a claim form containing: (i) contact information; (ii) 
verification of membership in one of the Statewide Damages Classes; (iii) the number and type of each CRT Product purchased 
during the class period; and (iv) an attestation under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate. All claimants 
will be subject to auditing and requests for documentation of purchases by the Settlement Administrator. "
559,27," See, e.g., Objectors' law review-styled discussion at pages 18-20 of their December 9, 2015 Reply brief. "
561,28," The Net Settlement Fund consists of the $10 million total, less 25% for attorneys' fees, [*256]  litigation expenses, notice and 
claim expenses. The Net Settlement Fund is to be a minimum of $5 million. "
569,29," IPP counsel notes correctly that a DOJ prosecution of one defendant actually helps other defendants who argue that their non-
prosecution demonstrates their innocence. Alioto Reply Decl. ¶4."

581,1," On January 5, 2015, District Judge Robert J. Shelby referred this case to the undersigned Magistrate Judge under 28 U.S.C. § 
636(b)(1)(B). (ECF No. 3.)"
581,2," Pursuant to DUCiv R 7-1(f), the undersigned finds oral argument unnecessary and will make its recommendation based on the 
Complaint and written memoranda. "
582,3," To assist the Court and the parties in fully comprehending her claims, the undersigned suggests Ms. Van Ornum use complete 
words and sentences instead of acronyms to articulate her allegations in the future. "
583,4," See, e.g., Compl. 18 (""5. Ds #3 D/p: w/ ETYK;...""). Ms. Van Ornum uses these acronyms to refer to Defendant #3, the AHA, in 
a ""doctor patient relationship, direct, indirect & consequential"" with Ethel T. Y. Kurihara (ETYK), Ms. Van Ornum's mother. (See 
Compl. 4, 9, ECF No. 7.) "
589,5," The undersigned notes that these excerpts typify Ms. Van Ornum's allegations, both against individual Defendants, such as 
Kuakini, as well as against the Defendants generally. "
590,6," Ms. Van Ornum defines ""Nurse"" as ""a graduate person who has the knowledge of SCI, are supervised by a 'physician', 
concerning public 'health', welfare, education[.]"" (Compl. 6, ECF No. 7.)"
590,7," Ms. Van Ornum defines ""Immunologic"" as ""the response of white blood cells destroying & engulfing 'pathogen',"" with 
""pathogen"" meaning ""a 'microorganism' normally harmless becoming 'pathogenic'"" and ""pathogenic"" referring to ""a parasite[.]"" 
(Compl. 5, 7, ECF No. 7.) "
591,8," Ms. Van Ornum defines ""SC"" as ""'Simpler compound' (1) monosaccharide; (2) amino acids, (3) fatty acid;; [sic]"" and ""MN"" as 
""'Micro-nutrition', 2nd stage of 'metabolism',"" with ""metabolism"" [*36]  defined at length and with further abbreviations in the 
Complaint. (Compl. 6, 7, ECF No. 7.)"

No. 7.) "
595,1," Unless otherwise indicated, all ECF references are from the docket of No. 14-04592 in the Northern District of California. "
603,2," The Court notes that Plaintiffs also apparently failed to comply with the Court's local rules when filing the motion to seal. When 
seeking to file under seal a document designated as confidential by the opposing party or a non-party, Civil Local Rule 79-5(e) 
requires Plaintiffs to file a declaration identifying the document sought to be sealed and the designating party. Civ. L.R. 79-5(e). 
Plaintiffs did not identify non-parties Google or IBM in Plaintiffs' required declaration. See ECF No. 137-1. However, on 
December 9, 2015, Oracle informed the Court that Plaintiffs sought to seal documents designated [**32]  as confidential by 
Google and IBM. ECF No. 141. On December 14, 2015, Google filed a declaration stating that Plaintiffs sought to seal 
documents designated as confidential by Google, and that Google was informed by Oracle's counsel that Plaintiffs sought to 
seal these documents. ECF No. 143. IBM has not filed a response to Plaintiffs' motion to seal, and it is not clear to the Court 
whether Plaintiffs informed IBM that Plaintiffs sought to file documents designated by IBM as confidential. "
607,3," The Court notes that Plaintiffs do not argue that the speculative damages exception, discussed by the [**46]  Ninth Circuit in 
Samsung, applies to Plaintiffs' claims. In the instant case, after Plaintiffs have twice amended the complaint and had multiple 
opportunities to brief the issue, ""[t]he Court is not inclined to manufacture arguments on Plaintiff[s'] behalf."" Kiland v. Boston 
Scientific Corp., No. C 10-4105 SBA, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35901, 2011 WL 1261130, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2011) (citing 
Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Washington, 350 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir. 2003) (""Our adversarial system relies on the advocates to 
inform the discussion and raise the issues to the court."")). Accordingly, the Court addresses only the exceptions to the default 
accrual rules and the tolling doctrines raised in Plaintiffs' original and two supplemental briefs."
607,4," In Plaintiffs' brief, they argue that the eBay litigation tolls their claims until September 2, 2014. However, the DOJ proceeding 
against eBay ended on September 2, 2014. Section 16(i) provides that the statute of limitations is ""suspended during the 
pendency thereof and for one year thereafter."" (emphasis added). Oracle suggests that Plaintiffs seek to toll the statutes of 
limitations until September 2, 2015. See Reply at 5. "
610,5," Plaintiffs expressly disclaim that Oracle's hiring of Hari in 2012 constitutes a continuing violation. See ECF No. 155, at 3. The 
Court agrees that Oracle's hiring of Hari is not an ""overt act"" sufficient to trigger the continuing violation theory. Even if Oracle 
hired Hari at an artificially depressed salary, the salary was based on alleged anticompetitive actions taken by Oracle prior to the 
limitations period. See In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, 591 F.2d 68, 71-72 (9th Cir. 1979) (holding that the defendants' 
refusal during the limitations period to purchase afterburner devices from [**58]  a particular company did not constitute an overt 
act because the defendants' refusal was based on an agreement entered into prior to the limitations period). Thus, Oracle's 
hiring of Hari is not ""a new and independent act that is not merely a reaffirmation of a previous act."" See Samsung, 747 F.3d at 
1202. "
612,6," The Court reiterates that this result is the same even if the Court were to consider the documents submitted by Plaintiffs in their 
procedurally improper ex parte motion to supplement the record. See ECF No. 138. None of the proffered documents reveal 
specific Secret Agreements, or actions by [**63]  Oracle to ratify existing Secret Agreements, after 2009. "
614,7," Oracle denies that the ""no hire"" list is unlawful, and argues that the identified non-solicitation agreements are either unilateral 
policies by Oracle not to hire from its business partners or are narrowly tailored and ancillary to legitimate business interests. "
615,," Mot. at 4, 20-22. Oracle further argues that the ""no hire"" list reflects the tracking of permissible non-solicitation agreements that 
DOJ requires of the Adobe and eBay defendants. Id. at 3-4."
615,8," Plaintiffs also allege that an Adobe employee sent an email about a ""no hire"" agreement to an Oracle employee from the 
Adobe employee's private email account. SAC ¶ 47. However, Plaintiffs do not argue that the Adobe employee's act should 
constitute fraudulent concealment by Oracle. Additionally, Plaintiffs fail to allege that the use of a private email account was 
unusual at Adobe. See Animation Workers II, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111262, 2015 WL 4974343, at *8 (plaintiffs averred that the 
defendants ""sometimes communicated about the conspiracy over personal email accounts instead of employer accounts,"" which 
was a ""sharp deviation from standard business practice""). "
616,9," In Plaintiffs' procedurally improper ex parte motion to supplement the record, and in Plaintiffs' supplemental briefing on the 
accrual of Hari's claims, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should find fraudulent concealment based on the actions of Google. See 
ECF No. 138 Ex. B; ECF No. 149, at 6-7. Plaintiffs appear to argue that, even in the absence of sufficient allegations that Oracle 
itself fraudulently concealed the Secret Agreements, the Court may find fraudulent concealment based entirely on actions of 
concealment taken by Google. As noted above, the Court struck Plaintiffs' ex parte motion. However, even if the Court were to 
consider, and accept, Plaintiffs' argument, the Court would find that Plaintiffs' ex parte motion does not sufficiently allege 
fraudulent concealment by Google that may be imputed to Oracle. [**78]  The documents attached to Plaintiffs' ex parte motion 
reveal Google employees openly discussing a restricted hiring policy. See ECF No. 138 Ex. B. The documents do not reveal that 
Google took steps to keep employees from discussing the restricted hiring policy, that Google sought to destroy evidence of the 
restricted hiring policy, or that Google avoided discussing the restricted hiring policy in writing. There are also no allegations 
about fraudulent concealment by Google in the SAC. Accordingly, the Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pled 
fraudulent concealment would not be altered were the Court to consider the documents from Plaintiffs' ex parte motion."
616,10," Plaintiffs also allege that Oracle continues to mislead the public about the Secret Agreements because an Oracle 
spokeswoman stated on October 14, 2014 that ""Oracle was deliberately excluded from all prior litigation filed in this matter 
because all the parties investigating the issue concluded there was absolutely no evidence that Oracle was involved."" Id. ¶ 108. 
Regardless of whether this statement misleads the public, the statement was made after Plaintiffs filed the instant action and 
thus could not have fraudulently concealed Plaintiffs' claims."
616,11," Other courts have found that misleading statements constitute affirmative acts of fraudulent concealment only if Plaintiffs 
allege actual reliance upon the allegedly misleading statements. See Block v. Toyota Motor Corp., 5 F. Supp. 3d 1047, 1061 (D. 
Minn. 2014) (finding no fraudulent concealment based on allegedly false public statements where plaintiffs did not show that 
they were aware of the public statements); In re Magnesium Oxide Antitrust Litig., Civ. No. 10-5943 (DRD), 2011 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 121373, 2011 WL 5008090, at *23 (D.N.J. Oct. 20, 2011) (""Implicit in the notion that a plaintiff's inquiry was misled or 
relaxed by an act of concealment is that the plaintiff relied on that act of concealment. . . . Here, Plaintiffs make no allegations 
that they were misled by Defendants' concealment of the alleged conspiracy and therefore have failed to meet the second 
element of fraudulent concealment.""). [**81]  The Court observes that Plaintiffs do not allege that they ever read, let alone relied 
on, Oracle's SEC filings. See Animation Workers I, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 1217 (noting ""Plaintiffs simply offer no factual allegations "
617,," with regards to . . . Plaintiffs' reliance on such information""). Though the Court need not resolve whether Plaintiffs must allege 
actual reliance, the Court is skeptical that Plaintiffs could satisfy any actual reliance requirement. "
618,12," Plaintiffs argue that the documents submitted with Plaintiffs' procedurally improper ex parte motion reveal Oracle exchanged 
compensation information with competitors. First, Plaintiffs include an email from an Adobe employee asking Oracle and other 
technology companies to participate in a survey regarding the equity options given to employees. See ECF No. 138 Ex. B. 
However, the email itself indicates that Oracle had not responded to the request for information. See id. Second, Plaintiffs point 
to a document listing compensation information for Director and Vice President positions at four companies that Oracle received 
from a ""confidential source."" Id. Given that the proposed class excludes corporate officers and senior Oracle executives, it 
appears that this compensation information is not relevant to Plaintiffs' allegations. See SAC ¶ 64 (providing class definition). 
Moreover, Garrison, Van Vorst, and Hari were not corporate officers or senior executives, and thus this compensation 
information would not [**87]  apply to them. Further, Plaintiffs fail to allege that Oracle used this information to create pretextual 
reasons for Plaintiffs' compensation, or to conceal the Secret Agreements. Plaintiffs thus fail to explain how Oracle fraudulently 
concealed the Secret Agreements or why Plaintiffs' reliance on Oracle's SEC filings was reasonable. Accordingly, even if the 
Court were to consider the documents submitted in Plaintiffs' ex parte motion, the Court would not find that Plaintiffs adequately 
alleged fraudulent concealment. "
620,13," The continuous accrual rule is similar to the continuing violation theory. ""However, unlike the continuing violation doctrine, 
which renders an entire course of conduct actionable, the theory of continuous accrual supports recovery only for damages 
arising from those breaches falling within the limitations period."" See Aryeh, 55 Cal. 4th at 1199. Whether Plaintiffs have 
sufficiently alleged a continuing violation is discussed above. See supra. "
624,1," The Court filed an Amended Memorandum and Order on November 12, 2015 (Doc. Nos. 1346 & 1347) to correct certain 
typographical errors. This Amended Memorandum and Order did not alter the substance of the Court's earlier ruling."
624,2," The Plaintiffs, in their supplemental briefing, cite to a number of cases for support of this argument. In United States v. Con'l 
Grp., the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that evidence of certain competitive activity among alleged co-conspirators does not 
prevent the court from finding the existence of a conspiracy. 603 F.2d at 467 (citing United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., "
625,310," U.S. 150, 225 n.59, 60 S. Ct. 811, 84 L. Ed. 1129 (1940)). Similarly, the mere cessation by a co-conspirator of activity in 
furtherance of the conspiracy is not sufficient to establish withdrawal. Id. Withdrawal is an affirmative defense, and the defendant 
must prove that it ""took affirmative action to defeat or disavow the purpose of the conspiracy."" Id. 466."
625,3, Attached as Exhibit 1 to Doc. No. 1334 (filed under seal). 
626,4," The Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs are unable to rely on record [*9]  evidence to support the existence of a 
conspiracy extending past 2008. The lawsuits which make up this current multidistrict litigation were filed at the end of 2008. In 
2009, the Court issued a case management order which relieved the parties of an obligation to preserve documents generated 
after December 31, 2008 pending the parties' joint proposal regarding preservation of documents. (Doc. No. 24). The parties 
attempted to provide a joint proposal as to their respective preservation obligations, but ultimately this proved unsuccessful and 
the Court appointed a special master to review the parties' respective positions and issue a report and recommendation. (Doc. 
No. 63). This was filed on March 9, 2009 (Doc. No. 71) and subsequently adopted (Doc. No. 83). The report stated that the 
parties had no obligation to preserve records created before January 1, 1999 and after December 31, 2008. (Doc. No. 83 at 9.) 
In 2013, however, the parties agreed to exchange post-2008 transactional data and supplement it on an ongoing basis. (Doc. 
No. 829). This data was used by Dr. Rausser in his model, discussed infra. "
628,5," While this issue was alluded to in the initial briefing, the Court did not incorporate it into the analysis of the class pre-2008 
because there did not appear to be any substantial regulatory regimes in place. The Defendants' initial round of briefing 
regarding class certification only made reference to legislation passed in California in 2008. Def. Memo Opposing Class Cert at 
34 (citing prop 2, Cal Health & Safe Code Ann. 25990). Notably, however, this argument focused on challenging the adequacy of 
Dr. Rausser's model to show the conspiracy's impact on the egg market. Given this single example, the Court did not find that 
Dr. Rausser's failure to incorporate it into his model was sufficient to defeat predominance. Class Cert I, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
152967, [WL] at *21, n. 17. The Defendants' [*17]  supplemental briefing on this issue, however, is substantially more 
comprehensive as to post-2008 legislative action and indicates that multiple state legislatures were pursuing—and 
implementing—separate legislative schemes regarding laying hen welfare which would have had the effect of reducing the size 
of flocks. Def. Memo at 7. "
633,1," Any reference to ""Manitou"" in this opinion encompasses both Manitou NA and Manitou France."
633,2," Denis McCormick, along with his wife, Jane McCormick, owned McCormick."
633,3," There was evidence showing that McCormick had been selling telehandlers to [*5]  Osentoski at a lower than normal profit 
margin, with Osentoski then selling the telehandlers to consumers. McCormick viewed Osentoski as a sub-dealer of 
telehandlers. However, Osentoski subsequently began purchasing telehandlers directly from Manitou NA for resale, cutting 
McCormick out of the picture."
633,4," Using the $1.69 million revenue figure from 2001 as the base, a 10-percent upward progression, had it been met, would have 
produced $1.85 million in revenue for 2002, $2.04 million in revenue for 2003, $2.24 million in revenue for 2004, $2.47 million in 
revenue for 2005, and $2.72 million in revenue for 2006. Mr. McCormick's testimony supported these calculations."
633,5," MCL 445.1457a(1), which is part of the MFUEA, provides, in pertinent part, that ""[a] supplier shall not terminate, cancel, fail to 
renew, or substantially change the competitive circumstances of an agreement without good cause."" Mr. McCormick testified 
that two or three other dealers were also apparently selling Manitou telehandlers within McCormick's exclusive territory. "
634,6," The agreement indicated that ""Manitou France is a world-leading company in the field of designing, manufacturing and 
marketing telescopic handlers for the construction, agricultural and industrial markets, and Manitou N.A. is its subsidiary 
responsible for the distribution of such products in the US market."" The agreement identified Gehl as ""a leading company in the 
field of designing, manufacturing and marketing compact equipment, including telescopic handlers, for the construction and 
agricultural markets[.]"" Gehl had hundreds more authorized dealers in the United States than Manitou."
634,7," Mr. McCormick testified that it was in the second half of 2005 that the full implementation of the 2004 agreement started 
impacting his business."
634,8," The breach of contract [*9]  claim was eventually settled by the parties, and in November 2008, the trial court granted summary 
disposition in favor of Manitou NA on its request for declaratory relief, concluding that Manitou NA had no obligation under the 
MFUEA to repurchase inventory from McCormick."
634,9," McCormick went out of business in 2008, allegedly due to the unlawful conduct and actions by Manitou NA. "
636,10," Although Coop Theatres was a criminal case brought under the Sherman Act, the conclusion that the booking agents' ""no-
solicitation"" agreement was a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act would be equally applicable in the context of a civil 
action. The MARA also contains criminal penalties for violations of § 2 of the MARA. MCL 445.779."
636,11, The jury here was instructed in accordance with the antitrust-injury principles enunciated in Atlantic Richfield.
636,12," Given the precedent, we reject McCormick's argument, which does not allude to any [*16]  supporting authority, that the 
relevant consumer or marketplace pertained to telehandler dealers, not consumers purchasing telehandlers from dealers. "
637,13," We would also point out an interesting distinction between the MARA and the Sherman Act. As indicated above, MCL 
445.778(2) authorizes an action for damages when a person is ""injured directly or indirectly in his or her business . . . by a 
violation of [the MARA]."" (Emphasis added.) Section 15 of the Sherman Act authorizes an action for damages when a person is 
""injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 15 USC 15(a). The Sherman Act does 
not reference indirect injuries. To the extent that the anticompetition or competition-reducing aspect of the 2004 agreement, i.e., 
the non-solicitation provision, [*19]  indirectly caused injury to McCormick, the MARA would appear to provide relief in the form 
of damages. However, the jury was ultimately instructed, on the basis of federal law, that McCormick had to establish a direct 
injury to its business. There is no issue on appeal concerning the instruction, and our analysis does not rely on an indirect 
antitrust injury."
637,14," McCormick had also pursued a ""monopoly"" counterclaim under the MARA, MCL 445.773, which was eventually dismissed and 
never resurrected, and our discussion in this [*21]  opinion regarding McCormick's MARA counterclaim pertains solely to the 
MARA restraint-of-trade claim alleged by McCormick and presented to the jury."
637,15," During the trial, the trial court altered its decision in regard to whether the 2004 agreement constituted a per se horizontal 
restraint of trade in violation of the MARA, concluding that it did as a matter of law. "
638,16," As noted in McCormick's appellate brief, ""[t]he injury suffered from the non-solicitation provision [was] different from that 
caused by Manitou's decision to sell its telehandlers in McCormick's exclusive territory through Gehl[,]"" and ""[t]he latter claim 
was raised under MFUEA."" "
639,17," We review de novo a trial court's ruling on a motion for summary disposition. Loweke v Ann Arbor Ceiling & Partition Co, LLC, 
489 Mich 157, 162; 809 NW2d 553 (2011). With respect to the well-established principles governing the analysis of a motion for 
summary disposition brought pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), this Court in Pioneer State Mut Ins Co v Dells, 301 Mich App 368, 
377; 836 NW2d 257 (2013), stated: In general, MCR 2.116(C)(10) provides for summary disposition when there is no genuine issue regarding any material fact 
and the moving party is entitled to judgment or partial judgment as a matter of law. A motion brought under MCR 
2.116(C)(10) tests the factual support for a party's claim. A trial court may grant a motion for summary disposition under 
MCR 2.116(C)(10) if the pleadings, affidavits, and other documentary evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to 
the nonmovant, show that there is no genuine issue with respect to any material fact. A genuine issue of material fact exists 
when the record, giving the benefit of reasonable doubt to the opposing party, leaves open an issue upon which reasonable 
minds might differ. The trial court is not permitted to assess credibility, weigh the evidence, or resolve factual disputes, and 
if material evidence [*27]  conflicts, it is not appropriate to grant a motion for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10). 
A court may only consider substantively admissible evidence actually proffered relative to a motion for summary disposition 
under MCR 2.116(C)(10). [Citations and quotation marks omitted.]"
639,18," We also note that ""this Court may overlook preservation requirements if the failure to consider the issue would result in 
manifest injustice, if consideration is necessary for a proper determination of the case, or if the issue involves a question of law 
and the facts necessary for its resolution have been presented[.]"" Smith v Foerster-Bolser Constr, Inc, 269 Mich App 424, 427; 
711 NW2d 421 (2006). All three of these bases support examining and resolving the relation-back issue, even had the matter 
been unpreserved. "
640,19," The record, and specifically the trial testimony of Mr. McCormick and Timothy Osentoski, supports Manitou NA's contentions. 
There [*33]  was evidence that McCormick had made $5,000 in profit per telehandler sale to Osentoski and $12,000 in profit per 
telehandler sale to others."
640,20," Manitou NA accepts the proposition that, in certain circumstances, a business owner can testify and establish lost profits with 
respect to the business, but only where there is a proper foundation and an adequate sales history. "
641,21," On cross-examination, Mr. McCormick testified that, as to OmniQuip, he was only personally aware of two lost sales to 
OmniQuip dealers and that there were no McCormick business documents showing lost sales to OmniQuip dealers."
641,22," Mr. McCormick testified that the average telehandler sold for $60,000. "
642,23," We note that Manitou NA did provide McCormick with information regarding the number of telehandlers that Manitou NA 
shipped to the state of Michigan for each of the years spanning 2000 through 2009 and the total dollar amount [*40]  of those 
sales. McCormick, however, did not utilize this information at trial. In seeking to quash the subpoena, Manitou NA did indicate 
that if its computer system were mined or explored, the information on territorial sales could probably be pieced together, but 
there were no existing or prepared reports as characterized by McCormick in its subpoena. McCormick did not pursue the 
matter. "
643,24," Moreover, the trial court ultimately allowed the jury to consider the business loss identified in the 2008 tax return in assessing 
damages, and, except for a discovery-sanction argument, Manitou NA has not challenged that decision on appeal, nor does it 
argue that the 2008 tax return was irrelevant and thus should not have been admitted into evidence. We do agree with Manitou 
NA that the business loss reflected in the 2008 tax return did not represent lost profits, but, despite the mischaracterization at 
times by McCormick's counsel, the loss was nonetheless a proper measure of MARA damages. "
644,25," With respect to Manitou NA's argument that the trial court should have excluded McCormick's evidence on damages as a 
discovery sanction, given its last minute change in its approach to damages, including discarding [*47]  the employment of its 
expert and his damage computations, the argument was not preserved below and we need not address it. Booth Newspapers, 
Inc v Univ of Mich Bd of Regents, 444 Mich 211, 234; 507 NW2d 422 (1993) (""Issues raised for the first time on appeal are not 
ordinarily subject to review.""). Moreover, on examination of the record and contemplation of the pertinent factors, exclusion of 
the evidence as a discovery sanction would not have been justified. Dean v Tucker, 182 Mich App 27, 32-33; 451 NW2d 571 
(1990). That said, our ruling should not be viewed as approving of McCormick's actions. Additionally, with regard to the damages 
related to McCormick's MFUEA claim and Manitou NA's assertion that the jury improperly awarded gross lost profits instead of 
net lost profits, the issue has been rendered moot in light of our ruling on the MFUEA damages. Further, this issue was also 
unpreserved below. "
646,1, Plaintiffs named Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center as a defendant but have since renamed this defendant. 
647,2," Skull base surgery, with its minimally invasive and endoscopic approaches, typically results in a third to a quarter of the 
complication rates of traditional neurosurgery. SAC ¶ 23. "
651,3," While the Court assumes that Plaintiffs can prove the facts that they have alleged, it does not assume that Plaintiffs can prove 
facts or theories that they have not alleged. See Jack Russell Terrier Network of N. Ca. v. Am. Kennel Club, Inc., 407 F.3d 1027, 
1035 (9th Cir. 2005)."
651,4," Plaintiffs make no effort to define the relevant market with the specificity required even at this stage of litigation. See Tanaka v. 
Univ. of S. California, 252 F.3d 1059, 1063 (9th Cir. 2001)."
651,5," Plaintiffs alleged that many medical institutions have denied Shahinian's applications for privileges since the closure of the 
Division and some institutions where he previously held privileges have also revoked his privileges. Shahinian has not alleged 
that he holds no privileges in the Los Angeles area, much less in the surrounding states or elsewhere within the geographical 
scope of the relevant market."
651,6," Plaintiffs have not alleged facts that demonstrate Defendants are a participant in the same market. Plaintiffs have only alleged 
that Defendants were negotiating with two neurosurgical practices to provide services at LRRMC, and one of those potential 
partnerships was with a group that performed ""minimally invasive skull surgeries."" SAC ¶¶ 38, 66. Even assuming that if 
Defendants eventually contracted with these providers to provide a service within the relevant market, Plaintiffs do not allege 
that Defendants actually retained either of these practices. See generally SAC. Thus it is far from clear that LRRMC was actually 
in the relevant market. "
652,7," The Court also finds that Plaintiffs' § 1 theory does not make economic sense. See, e.g., Universal Grading Serv. v. eBay, Inc., 
No. C-09-2755 RMW, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2325, 2012 WL 70644, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 9, 2012). Plaintiffs' theory appears to 
revolve around LRRMC's parent company's ability to implement identical programs across their facilities in twenty states. See 
SAC ¶¶ 66; Dkt. 41, 6. Plaintiffs offer no rationale as to why ""restricting"" Shahinian's ability to practice at LRRMC would plausibly 
allow Defendants to increase profits in a manner that they could not have done with Shahinian in place at LRRMC. If Defendants 
had designs to create copycat Divisions in other locations throughout the United States, it would have been far easier for 
Defendants to retain Shahinian at LRRMC. At LRRMC, Defendants could have used Shahinian's expertise in this rapidly 
developing technique. Instead, by suspending his privileges and dissolving the Division, it appears more likely that Defendants 
created a potential competitor."
652,8," It is appropriate to dismiss a pending anti-SLAPP motion as moot when a court dismisses state law claims under § 1367(c). 
See, e.g., Sikhs for Justice ""SFJ"", Inc. v. Facebook, Inc., 144 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 2015 WL 7075696, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 13, 
2015); Gingery v. City of Glendale, No. CV 14-1291 PA (AJWX), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107598, 2014 WL 10987395, at *6 (C.D. 
Cal. Aug. 4, 2014). "
655,1," For clarity, the defendants will be referred to collectively as ""DePuy."" "
657,2," The 65 II A contract further states that the general controls of the FD&C Act controlling medical devices ""are the baseline 
requirements that apply to all medical devices necessary for marketing, proper labeling and monitoring [ ] performance once the 
device is on the market."" (SAC ¶ 119). "
658,3," The Court will consider two sets of DePuy marketing materials along with the facts as alleged in the SAC. First, it will consider 
Exhibit C attached to DePuy's motion to dismiss: the 2011 ""Pinnacle Hip Solutions Compatibility Guide,"" a marketing document 
that DePuy provided to health-care providers. Second, the Court will consider Exhibit D attached to DePuy's motion to dismiss: 
the 2008 ""Design Rationale"" for Pinnacle products. On motions to dismiss, courts can properly take into account (1) documents 
the authenticity of which are not disputed by the parties; (2) documents that are official public records; (3) documents central to 
plaintiffs' claim; or (4) documents sufficiently referred to in [**16]  the complaint. Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. "
659,1993," ); see also Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 879 n.3 (1st Cir. 1991) (considering securities-offering 
documents submitted by defendants with motion to dismiss for claim of securities fraud); Fudge v. Penthouse Int'l, Ltd., 840 F.2d 
1012, 1014-15 (1st Cir. 1988) (considering allegedly libelous article submitted by defendants with motion to dismiss). Here, the SAC refers to DePuy's ""marketing materials"" and other documents that it provided to health-care providers numerous 
times. (See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 9, 165, 183, 232, 252, 419). Moreover, the documents were publicly-distributed marketing materials. 
Accordingly, Exhibits C and D are documents whose authenticity is not disputed, are central to the relators' claims, and are 
sufficiently referred to in the SAC."
659,4," DePuy manufactured liners and heads at a specified ""nominal"" size. (SAC ¶ 182). Along with a nominal size, each component 
was [**18]  assigned an upper and lower tolerance, representing the ""permissible diametrical clearance measurements of the 
manufactured component."" (SAC ¶ 182). The acceptable range of diameter measurements for each component is plus or minus 
10 microns (0.010 millimeters) from the nominal size; accordingly, ""the complete range of acceptable deviation [for a device] is 
20 microns for each component."" (SAC ¶ 182). "
661,5," Also in 2005, DePuy's director of regulatory affairs wrote an e-mail to DePuy's global vice president of clinical research, 
indicating that the regulatory submission ""stretch[ed] the 510(k) idea to its limits"" and further elaborated, ""I can see how the FDA 
looked at it. They want clinical data for metal-on-metal, and we changed the material, the [**28]  size and 'diametrical clearance,' 
then tested a device that is different than the subject of the 510(k)."" (SAC ¶ 288). "
666,6," The case was initially assigned to Judge O'Toole, then was reassigned to this judge on August 10, 2012, then was reassigned 
to Judge Talwani on June 26, 2014, and finally reassigned back to this judge on October 8, 2014. "
668,7," ""We recognize that . . . the 'presentment' requirement applies only to . . . subsection (a)(1)(A) claims and not . . . subsection 
(a)(1)(B) or subsection (a)(1)(C) claims. However, Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies with full force [**48]  to all three 
subsections [of the FCA]."" Ge, 737 F.3d at 124-25 n.5. "
674,8," It is also noteworthy that the allegations with regard to that order are based on mere ""information and belief."" (SAC ¶¶ 414-24)."
674,9," If the rule were otherwise, virtually any claim of misrepresentation or a product defect involving medical devices, 
pharmaceuticals, or other medical products could be brought as a qui tam action. Government health-care programs such as 
Medicare and Medicaid represent a huge portion of health-care expenditures in the United States. As a matter of logic, any 
scheme that causes unreasonable or unnecessary purchases of a product or service will almost certainly result in the 
submission of some false claim, by someone, somewhere, to the federal government. Rule 9(b), however, requires something 
more than conclusory allegations that false claims must have resulted from the misconduct. See Ge, 737 F.3d at 124 (stating 
that the court ""reject[s] [the] approach"" sought by the relator, which was ""a per se rule that if sufficient allegations of misconduct 
are made, it necessarily follows that false claims and/or material false information were filed"")."
674,10," DePuy also contends that the SAC fails to allege that DePuy made any false statements in submitting or causing third-parties 
to submit false claims that were ""material"" to the government's decision to reimburse the claim. In most cases, materiality issues 
are not appropriate for resolution on the pleadings because the element, as defined by the First Circuit, is highly dependent on 
the facts. See, e.g., Loughren, 613 F.3d at 308 (noting that ""materiality in the FCA context involves a factual determination of the "
675,," weight that the decisionmaker would have given particular information""). Because the Court has resolved the present motion on 
the narrower issue of Rule 9(b)'s pleading requirements——along with the fact that Escobar would need to be resolved by the 
Supreme Court—— the Court will not address DePuy's second argument."
675,11," Although the First Circuit has ""eschewed distinctions"" used by other circuits in describing types of FCA claims, as discussed 
below, it appears that the court in Escobar applied a theory of implied certification. 780 F.3d at 512. "
678,12," For these purposes, the District of Columbia will be considered a ""state."""
678,13," California is the only state among the alleged false claims in paragraphs 479 through 490 where the SAC alleges an order of a 
Pinnacle MoM device. (See SAC ¶¶ 479-90). "
679,14," The relators made similar requests in their sur-reply brief and post-hearing supplemental filing. (Docket Nos. 166, 179). The 
relators also contend that leave to amend should be granted because DePuy did not move to dismiss the SAC with prejudice. 
But DePuy explicitly did so, as noted on the first page of its motion to dismiss, filed on June 29, 2015. (Docket No. 145) 
(""Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6), Defendants . . . respectfully move to dismiss the relators' 
second [**86]  amended complaint with prejudice.""). "
683,1," Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without 
a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. Accordingly, the hearing set for February 8, 2016 at 1:30 p.m. is hereby 
vacated and off calendar. "
685,2," Nor has G.U.E. alleged a vertical refusal to deal. On the contrary, G.U.E. clearly pleads PAC's eagerness to enter into a 30% 
Agreement with G.U.E. PAC is not refusing to deal with G.U.E.; it is simply insisting that it deal with G.U.E. and its competitors 
on equal terms. That is not an antitrust violation. "
700,*," IMP's other claims of anticompetitive conduct by LN fall in tandem with its tying allegations since all are based on the same 
misconceptions. Likewise, plaintiff's state antitrust law claims echo its allegations under the Sherman Act and thus also fail. 
Finally, plaintiff's remaining state-law claims fail for the reasons outlined by the district court. "
705,1," The parties have filed a total of 16 motion in limine. Two of those motions have been already decided. See ECF Nos. 224 & 
229."
705,2," Similarly, Plaintiffs will be excluded from introducing any evidence concerning government raids on Dow or Dow's alleged 
involvement in any other price-fixing conspiracies. Plaintiffs have not shown that such evidence is needed to bolster Stephanie 
Barbour's credibility, and the prejudicial effect would substantially outweigh any probative value. "
708,3," Plaintiffs have consented to withdrawing certain portions of Ms. Barbour's testimony. See Pls. Opp. at 5 n. 5, ECF No 157. 
Notwithstanding the Court's decision, Plaintiffs will be held to that representation. "
709,4," Plaintiffs have also indicated that Dr. Marx may refer to her conversations with Bayer's counsel when explaining why she 
attributes the variances detected by her models to the existence of a conspiracy. However, the Court has also reserved on 
whether Dr. Marx may attribute the variances to any particular cause. See ECF No. 229. "
718,1," SAC ¶ 17 (quoting Scott Van Pelt, Scott's ""One Big Thing"", ESPN Radio, http://espn.go.com/espnradio/play?id=12409670 ). "
719,2," The Court grants the Tour's request for judicial notice of Exhibits A-R. HN1[
] ""The Court may take judicial notice of 
documents which are referenced in but not appended to the pleadings, and whose authenticity no party disputes."" Northstar Fin. 
Advisors, Inc. v. Schwab Invs., 781 F. Supp. 2d 926, 942 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (citing Branch v. Tunnell, 14 F.3d 449, 454 (9th Cir. 
1994), overruled on other grounds by Galbraith v. Cty. of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2002)). The complaint references 
these documents — form caddie registration agreements, caddie application forms, and player handbooks and regulations — 
and the caddies have stipulated that they do not contest the authenticity [**7]  of these documents. See Dkt. No. 78, at 2. The 
caddies' motion to strike, Dkt. No. 82, is accordingly DENIED. "
720,3," HN4[
] A concession like this is appropriately considered on a motion to dismiss. [**11]  See Scognamillo v. Credit Suisse First Bos. LLC, No. C03-2061 TEH, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20221, 2005 WL 2045807, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2005); see also 
Brown v. Philip Morris Inc., 250 F.3d 789, 795, 797 (3d Cir. 2001); cf. Soto-Negron v. Taber Partners I, 339 F.3d 35, 38 (1st Cir. 
2003) (quoting Chongris v. Bd. of Appeals, 811 F.2d 36, 37 (1st Cir.1987)). "
721,4," The complaint expressly references exhibits attached to Edmondson's declaration, and impliedly incorporates the substance of 
Edmondson's declaration itself. HN7[
] ""[A] court may consider documents which are not physically attached to the complaint 
but 'whose contents are alleged in [the] complaint and whose authenticity no party questions.'"" Van Winkle v. Allstate Ins. Co., 
290 F. Supp. 2d 1158, 1162 (C.D. Cal. 2003) (quoting eCash Techs., Inc. v. Guagliardo, 127 F. Supp.2d 1069, 1074 (C.D. Cal. 
2000) (second alteration original)). Because the plaintiffs offered Edmondson's declaration themselves and the defendant does 
not dispute its authenticity, the Court will consider the declaration in ruling on the motion to dismiss. See Appling v. Wachovia 
Mortg., FSB, 745 F. Supp. 2d 961, 968 (N.D. Cal. 2010). "
723,5," The Court assumes, for the sake of argument and for purposes of this motion to dismiss only, that fans of pro golf are uniquely 
attractive to certain advertisers in a way that fans of other sports (such as tennis) are not. Cf. NCAA v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of 
Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 111, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984). "
727,1," The record shows the court granted summary adjudication in favor of defendants on plaintiffs' causes of action for intentional 
and negligent interference with existing economic relationships. The court also separately granted without leave to amend 
defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings on plaintiffs' cause of action for negligent interference with prospective 
economic relationships. Neither ruling is at issue in this appeal. At trial, plaintiffs had two remaining causes of action against 
defendants: IIPEA and unfair competition (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.; hereafter UCL or Act). "
733,2," We note Insurance Code section 750 prohibits offering any ""rebate, refund, commission, or other consideration . . . as 
compensation or inducement"" in connection with the ""processing, presenting, or negotiating claims, including claims under 
policies of insurance."" (Italics added.) This statute has no application to the case at bar, which does not involve an insurance 
claim."
733,3," Insurance Code former section 751 provided: ""An insurer, or an insurance agent, broker, or solicitor, personally or otherwise, 
shall not offer or pay, directly or indirectly, as an inducement to enter into an insurance contract, any valuable consideration 
which is not clearly specified, promised or provided for in the policy, or application for the insurance, and any such consideration 
not appearing in the policy is an unlawful rebate."" "
735,4," Insurance Code section 780 provides: ""An insurer or officer or agent thereof, or an insurance broker or solicitor shall not cause 
or permit to be issued, circulated or used, any statement that is known, or should have been known, to be a misrepresentation of 
the following: [¶] (a) The terms of a policy issued by the insurer or sought to be negotiated by the person making or permitting 
the misrepresentation. [¶] (b) The benefits or privileges promised thereunder. [¶] (c) The future dividends payable thereunder."""
735,5," Section 781 of the Insurance Code provides: ""(a) A person shall not make any statement that is known, or should have been 
known, to be a misrepresentation (1) to any other person for the purpose of inducing, or tending [*33]  to induce, such other 
person either to take out a policy of insurance, or to refuse to accept a policy issued upon an application therefor and instead 
take out any policy in another insurer, or (2) to a policyholder in any insurer for the purpose of inducing or tending to induce him 
or her to lapse, forfeit or surrender his or her insurance therein. [¶] (b) A person shall not make any representation or 
comparison of insurers or policies to an insured which is misleading, for the purpose of inducing or tending to induce him or her 
to lapse, forfeit, change or surrender his or her insurance, whether on a temporary or permanent plan."""
735,6," Insurance Code section 790.03 defines ""unfair methods of competition and unfair and deceptive acts or practices"" to include: 
""(a) Making, issuing, circulating, or causing to be made, issued or circulated, any estimate, illustration, circular, or statement 
misrepresenting the terms of any policy issued or to be issued or the benefits or advantages promised thereby or the dividends 
or share of the surplus to be received thereon, or making any false or misleading statement as to the dividends or share of 
surplus previously paid on similar policies, or making any misleading representation [*34]  or any misrepresentation as to the 
financial condition of any insurer, or as to the legal reserve system upon which any life insurer operates, or using any name or 
title of any policy or class of policies misrepresenting the true nature thereof, or making any misrepresentation to any "
736,," policyholder insured in any company for the purpose of inducing or tending to induce the policyholder to lapse, forfeit, or

736,7," We note that in connection with the UCL claim, the special verdict also did not require the jury to specify which of the ""three 
varieties"" of unfair competition defendants' conduct violated (see Cel-Tech, supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 180), as the special verdict 
merely asked whether defendants committed ""an unfair, fraudulent or unlawful business practice."" (Italics added.) "
737,8," Such misrepresentations included among others Shahri's statement during [*39]  the August 2007 UITD board meeting that the 
returned premiums already given to UITD were a ""gift"" for UITD's 30th anniversary; his statement both before and during that 
same meeting that UITD was entitled to a 5 percent renewal credit when in fact UITD was not entitled to such a credit; his 
statement that SGT's taxi cab units were operated and/or garaged in certain locations, when in fact those units were actually 
operated and/or garaged in a different location that subsequently required an upward adjustment of SGT's premiums; and his 
statement that SGT was not required to pay a premium on 75 of its ""spare"" cabs, which were operated when a ""regular"" cab was 
out of commission, which turned out not to be correct."
737,9," We note the jury was instructed it could find intentional misrepresentation based on defendants' conduct directed at UITD, SGT 
and/or Mercury. We note none of these entities were a party to the lawsuit, and it is not altogether clear that plaintiffs had 
""standing"" to assert a misrepresentation claim involving conduct not directed at them. California Civil Jury Instruction (CACI) No. 
1900, the standard jury instruction for intentional misrepresentation, teaches that the misrepresentations [*40]  must have been 
directed to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff must have relied on such misrepresentations. (See CACI No. 1900, which provides in 
part that defendant represented to plaintiff a fact that was true that turned out to be false; that defendant intended plaintiff to rely 
on the representation and plaintiff did so rely; and that plaintiff's reliance on the representation was reasonable.) In light of our 
decision in this case, we decline to reach the standing issue or address any other issues in connection with the intentional 
misrepresentation jury instructions, including the (confusing) instruction regarding ""reliance."" "
738,10," In any event, we note the jury awarded plaintiffs ""$0.00"" for out-of-pocket expenses on their UCL claim. We also note that 
plaintiffs were not entitled to an award of damages or punitive damages even if successful on this claim. (See Clark v. Superior 
Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 605, 610, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 876, 235 P.3d 171 [noting ""damages, including punitive damages and 
increased or enhanced damages"" are not recoverable for a violation of the UCL].)"
738,11," In light of our decision, we need not reach defendants' other contentions on appeal. "
762,1," An amended complaint supersedes previously filed complaints. Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1262 (9th Cir. 1992); Hal 
Roach Studios v. Richard Feiner & Co., 896 F.2d 1542, 1546 (9th Cir. 1990). Accordingly, Plaintiff's February 4, 2016 First 
Amended Complaint supersedes the January 21, 2016 ""First Amended Complaint,"" and the Court will treat the February 4, 2016 
document as the operative pleading. "

778,3," Other definitions, however, indicate that consent ""decrees"" are not limited to equitable relief. ""Decree"" is also defined as ""[a] 
court's final judgment"" and ""[a]ny court order."" Decree, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Moreover, a ""civil-penalty order"" 
is defined as ""[a] judicial decree imposing some type of punishment for violating a noncriminal statute."" Civil-penalty Order, 
Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). "
779,4," The language of the ""prima facie evidence"" provision also shows that Congress understood that orders concluding ""criminal 
proceedings,"" including orders to pay [**21]  ""criminal fines,"" 15 U.S.C. § 1, were understood to constitute ""consent judgments or 
decrees."" See also 10 A.L.R. Fed. 328 (1972) (""Although the phrase 'consent judgments or decrees' [in § 16(a)] does not 
normally describe criminal convictions, the lower federal courts are agreed that a judgment of conviction entered on a plea of 
nolo contendere in a federal antitrust prosecution is a consent decree within the meaning of the proviso . . . ."" (internal footnote 
omitted)). "
783,5," In addition to the unpublished entries of judgment by district courts discussed supra, the Government has periodically stated its 
position in Federal Register notices regarding mixed consent judgments that seek both equitable relief and civil penalties. See, 
e.g., 44 Fed. Reg. 41,579, 41,583 (July 17, 1979) (""[W]e do not believe that under the A.P.P.A. [**39]  the penalty aspect of this 
case is open to public objection.""). The Government also explained its view that the Tunney Act is inapplicable to HSR Act 
settlements for civil penalties in a footnote in the Federal Register in conjunction with its first HSR Act penalty case in 1984. 49 
Fed. Reg. at 36,455 n.1; see also Dkt. 3 at 17-18. "
786,1," In his complaint, plaintiff references the Clayton Act codified at 15 U.S.C. §§ 12 et seq. as modified by the Robinson-Patman 
Act. Given what follows, [*2]  the court need not get into the intricacies of federal antitrust law. "
788,2," Even if plaintiff had sought relief other than money damages, Director Bertsch would likely be entitled to Parker immunity for 
the reasons stated. Also, while Parker immunity does not automatically extend to municipalities or political subdivisions of the 
States since they are not themselves sovereign, ""substate governmental entities do receive immunity from antitrust scrutiny 
when they 'act pursuant to state policy to displace competition with regulation or monopoly public service.'"" F.T.C. v. Phoebe 
Putney Health System, Inc.,     U.S.    , 133 S.Ct. 1003, 1010-11, 185 L. Ed. 2d 43 (2013) (""Phoebe Putney"") (quoting Columbia 
v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 370, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1991)). Finally, in certain 
circumstances, private parties who carry out state functions are entitled to the benefit of Parker immunity. Id. at 1010. A two-part test is employed to determine whether anticompetitive conduct of nonsovereign actors should be deemed state action 
and, for that reason, shielded from federal antitrust laws. First, the State must have [*8]  articulated a clear policy to allow the 
anticompetitive conduct. Second, the State must provide active supervision of the anticompetitive conduct. Dental Examiners, 
135 S.Ct. at 1111-12. An exception is made for local governmental entities, however, which only have to satisfy the first part of 
the test. Phoebe Putney, 133 S.Ct. at 1011. In order to meet the ""clear articulation"" test, it is not necessary that a state 
legislature expressly state in a statute or its legislative history that it intends for the delegated action to have anticompetitive 
effect. Rather, it is sufficient if the anticompetitive effect was a foreseeable result of what was authorized. Id. In North Dakota, the State Legislature has (1) made the incarceration of inmates at the county level a public function through its 
requirement that counties either provide county jails or contract with other governmental entities for housing inmates, and (2) 
required that county sheriffs operate the jails, with the sheriff being an elected official whose office is provided for both under 
state statutory law and the North Dakota Constitution. See N.D. Const. Art. VII, § 11; N.D.C.C. §§ 11-10-20, 11-15-03, & 12-
44.1-02. Further, the State Legislature has enacted N.D.C.C. ch 12-44.1, which regulates the operation of correctional facilities, 
including county jails. [*9]  Among other things, ch. 12-44.1: (1) requires each facility to develop and periodically update a 
manual for operating the facility; (2) governs the treatment of inmates and proscribes inmate rights; (3) grants the NDDOCR the 
authority to promulgate minimum standards for the construction and operation of correctional facilities; and (4) requires the 
NDDOCR to annually conduct an inspection of each facility with respect to health and safety, fire and life safety, security, 
rehabilitation programs, recreation, treatment of inmates, and personnel training. Finally, the NDDOCR has promulgated detailed 
jail rules and standards that even more closely regulate jails and their operations. See www.nd.gov/docr/county/docs/NORTH 
DAKOTA CORRECTIONAL FACILITY RULES 2014(2).pdf (last accessed February 9, 2016). Given all of this, the North Dakota Legislature clearly has made incarceration of inmates a governmental function, i.e., something 
that will generally be done by governmental entities and not the private sector, with the effects of that policy upon competition 
being clearly foreseeable. Further, the State's policy of government-operated correctional facilities clearly encompasses the 
ordinary incidents [*10]  of incarcerating inmates including, for example, providing food, clothing, routine medical care, and 
recreational opportunities - all things that are subject to explicit regulation by the State and for which the State does not require 
be contracted out to the private sector. Finally, there is no reason why the same would not be true for a jail's operation of a 
commissary, which is a minor aspect of any county jail's operation, if it decides to offer one, and serves only inmates - a market 
with respect to which the State has generally eliminated competition. The net result of all of this is that the ""clear articulation"" 
requirement appears to be satisfied thereby entitling the county defendants to Parker immunity. As for Turnkey, the ""clear articulation"" part of the two-part test is likely satisfied for the reasons already expressed and the 
second part of the two-part test (the ""active supervision requirement"") is likely satisfied by the fact that Turnkey is subject to the 
direct control of the Ward County Sheriff, who, in turn, is subject to removal from office by the Governor under N.D.C.C. § 44-11-
01 for acts of misconduct, malfeasance, or neglect of duties and ultimately by the voters in the next election [*11]  if they are 
dissatisfied with his or her performance. Also, Turnkey's ability to operate is subject to the indirect control of the State in two 
respects. First, although the NDDOCR has chosen not to directly regulate jail commissaries as of this point, it undoubtedly has 
the legislative authority to do so if it deemed it necessary to carry out its responsibilities under N.D.C.C. ch.12-44.1. Second, the 
operation of jail commissaries are more generally subject to the statutory provisions governing the treatment of inmates and 
inmates rights set forth in N.D.C.C. ch. 12-44.1 (e.g., the right of inmates to equal treat) as well as NDDOCR review generally of 
inmate treatment. Hence, Turnkey is also likely entitled to Parker immunity. Not surprisingly, whether based upon a similar analysis or more general reasoning, a number of courts have concluded that 
Parker immunity should extend to the operation of commissaries by state or local governmental entities. See, e.g., Wheeler v. "
789,," Beard, No. 03-4826, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9778, 2005 WL 1217191, at ** 2-7 (E.D. Pa. May 19, 2005); Dehoney v. S.C.Dept. of

[published in full-text format at 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 34980] (4th Cir. 1995) (South Carolina Department of Corrections entitled 
to Parker immunity as a state agency from an antitrust claim over the operation of a prison canteen); Guyer v. Frame, No. 85-
3808, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12505, 1985 WL 4984, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Dec. 20, 1985) (rejecting claim of antitrust violation [*12]  
based on alleged excessive commissary charges brought against a county prison)."
789,3," The State is also correct that there is Eleventh Amendment immunity for the claim of alleged constitutional violation being 
brought against defendant Bertsch. Under Eighth Circuit precedent, this court is required to assume that public officials are being 
sued in their official capacities unless there is a clear expression to the contrary. See, e.g., Remington v. Hoopes, 611 Fed. 
App'x 883, 884-85 (8th Cir. 2015) (""[W]hen a plaintiff's complaint is silent or otherwise ambiguous about the capacity in which the 
plaintiff is suing the defendant, our precedent requires us to presume that the plaintiff brings suit against the defendants in only 
their official capacities.""); Johnson v. Outboard Marine Corp., 172 F.3d 531, 535 (8th Cir. 1999). The net result of this is that 
plaintiff has no claim against defendant Bertsch for alleged violation of his equal protection rights. This is because any suit 
against Bertsch in her official capacity is a suit against the State, which has Eleventh Amendment immunity from any claim for 
damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation [*14]  of federal civil rights. See, e.g., Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-69, 
105 S. Ct. 3099, 87 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985); Reynolds v. Dormire, 636 F.3d 976, 981 (8th Cir.2011) (state officials sued in official 
capacity possess Eleventh Amendment immunity from damage claims). "

792,2," The rating agencies originally named as defendants also included Moody's Corporation, Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and 
Fitch Inc., Fitch Ratings, Ltd., and Fitch Group, Inc. Only [*3]  the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., now known as McGraw Hill 
Financial, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, are parties to the appeal."
792,3," The bond insurers named as defendants originally consisted of Ambac Assurance Corporation, Ambac Financial Group, Inc., 
MBIA Inc., MBIA Insurance Corporation, MBIA Insurance Corporation of Illinois, ACA Insurance Corp., Financial Guarantee 
Insurance Company (FGIC), Financial Security Assurance Inc., Assured Guaranty Corp., and Syncora Guarantee, Inc. Ambac 
Financial Group, Inc., ACA Insurance Corp., FGIC, and Syncora. were dismissed for various reasons and are no longer parties 
to the coordinated proceeding."
792,4, All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure section unless otherwise noted. 
800,5," Bond insurers also argued in their briefs that the UCL claims should be dismissed because under this statute there is no form 
of relief to which the plaintiffs can possibly be entitled. The UCL ""provides only limited remedies: restitution and injunctive relief."" 
(Shersher v. Superior Court (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 1491, 1497, 65 Cal. Rptr. 3d 634.) Because the disputed practice is no 
longer in use, injunctive relief is not available. As to restitution, ""'in the UCL context . . . restitution means the return of money to 
those persons from whom it was taken or who had an ownership interest in it.'"" (Ibid; Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17203 [""The court 
may make such orders or judgments, . . . as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest [*34]  any money . . . which 
may have been acquired by means of such unfair competition.""].) Direct payment from plaintiff to defendant is not necessary to 
state a claim under the UCL. (Shersher, supra, at p. 1497; Troyk v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2009) 171 Cal.App.4th 1305, 1340, 90 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 589.) In cases where there is no direct payment, a plaintiff must show that the defendant benefitted from the 
actions that resulted in an economic loss to plaintiff. (Shersher, supra, at pp. 1499-1500 [finding that defendant benefitted from 
plaintiff's purchase of its products from third party dealers despite the fact that payment was not made directly from plaintiff to 
defendant.]; Troyk, supra, at pp. 1339-1342 [defendants subject to claim of restitution for service charges paid by consumers to 
a third party because defendants received a benefit from the payment of such charges and because defendants and the third 
party acted as a single enterprise].) Here, plaintiffs presented evidence that bond insurers acquired significant financial benefits 
from their participation in the alleged conspiracy."
800,6," The trial court recognized two alternative definitions of ""unfair"" that may be applicable in this action and found that nonprofit 
plaintiffs had presented a probability of prevailing under each standard. (See West v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 214 
Cal.App.4th 780, 806, 154 Cal. Rptr. 3d 285 [""Several definitions of 'unfair' under the UCL have been formulated. They are: [¶] 1. 
'An act or practice is unfair if the consumer injury is substantial, is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or 
to competition, and is not an injury the consumers themselves could reasonably have avoided.' [Citation.] [¶] 2. '""[A]n 'unfair' 
business practice occurs when that practice 'offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral, 
unethical, [*37]  oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers.' [Citation.]"" [Citation.]' [Citation.] [¶] 3. An 
unfair business practice means '""the public policy which is a predicate to the action must be 'tethered' to specific constitutional, 
statutory or regulatory provisions.""'""].) Defendants assert that the Cel-Tech standard is the only standard applicable in this 
action. Because we agree with the trial court's conclusion under that standard, we need not consider whether other standards 
apply or whether nonprofit plaintiffs' showing satisfied other standards as well. "
817,1," The Direct Purchaser Actions were comprised of those who purchased wallboard directly from the manufacturers; the Indirect 
Purchaser Actions were comprised of those who purchased wallboard through a retailer, contractor, or other intermediary, and 
whose claims are based on state laws."
817,2," At least one case has been consolidated with this MDL but is not at issue today because it was filed as an individual action as 
opposed to a class action. Ashton Woods Holdings LLC v. USG Corp., 15-1712, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160733 (E.D. Pa.) (also 
known as ""Home Builders Action""). The cases at issue today are only those that were filed as class actions. "
819,3," L&W Supply Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of USG Corporation, was not named as a defendant, but was included in 
the settlement agreement. "
820,4," American also submitted the declaration of Timothy Gleason (Attorney, Will & Emery LLP), but this declaration was related to 
the discovery process rather than the merits of the case."
820,5," In his declaration, Mr. Powers detailed that, because of the economic downturn in the early 2000s, American's price for 
wallboard dropped from $165 per thousand square feet in 2006 to $91 per thousand square feet in 2011, a 45% decrease. Ex. 
48 ¶ 20; accord Ex. 50 ¶ 14."
820,6," National also submitted the declaration of John Corsi (VP of Manufacturing, Operations, and Engineering, National), but this 
declaration goes to the operational status of National's plants and the production capacity of those plants, rather than to whether 
National entered into an agreement. Ex. 30. "
821,7," During the class period, National's pricing decisions were made by ""discuss[ing[ the issue and reach[ing] a consensus within a 
group of decision-makers consisting of [Mr. Weisbruch] and Messrs. Withrock [Dir. Demand Management], Kelly [Dir. Dealer 
Sales], Crutchfield [**22]  [Dir. Dealer Sales], and Wood [Dir. Nat'l Accounts]."" Ex. 210 ¶ 3. After a decision was reached with 
this group, the decision would be run by Tom Nelson (CEO, National), who had ""ultimate authority over [National]'s pricing 
actions and during this period routinely approved of the recommendations of the sales leadership team."" Ex. 210 ¶ 4."
821,8," PABCO submitted additional declarations, but these declarations are related to issues other than whether Defendants reached 
an agreement (e.g., plant operation during the relevant time period). [**24] "
822,9," There are six exceptions, all of which were written by employees of CertainTeed's parent corporation. Exs. 37, 39, 43, 74, 76, 
77. These declarations do not indicate that the individuals were aware of an agreement; they simply fail to state lack of 
awareness while the other declarations state as much prominently."
822,10," Mr. Donaldson retired from Certain Teed on March 9, 2012, so his declaration does not address the 2013 price [**27]  
increase. Certain Teed Ex. 1 ¶ 9. "
823,11," The Court recognizes that much of the evidence in this case is consistent with both Plaintiffs' and Defendants' version of 
events. That fact alone does not entitle Defendants to summary judgment. Rather, Defendants are entitled to summary judgment 
only if the evidence is equally consistent with Plaintiffs' and Defendants' narratives. Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1231. "
824,12," The Third Circuit has indicated that there may be some instances in which evidence of the first two factors would do more than 
show an interdependent market (e.g., unilateral exchanges of confidential price information). In re Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 361 
n.12 "
826,13," Notably, prior to the initiation of the private suits against the flat glass manufacturers, two executives of one of the industry's 
manufacturers were indicted on unrelated criminal [**39]  charges. In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litigation, 385 F.3d 350, 354 (3d Cir. 
2004). Related to that proceeding, they claimed their employer (Libbey-Owens-Ford, ""LOF"") ""had conspired with its competitors 
to fix the price of the glass products it sold."" Id. LOF then submitted an admission to the Department of Justice admitting to as 
much, but not specifically naming its co-conspirators. Id. Although the Flat Glass court considered LOF's proffer to the 
Department of Justice, it noted that the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs was sufficient to warrant reversal of summary 
judgment regardless of LOF's proffer. Id at 363 n.14. "
827,14," The Chocolate court dedicated most of its traditional conspiracy evidence analysis to the plaintiffs' evidence of a Canadian 
conspiracy that mirrored the conspiracy alleged by the plaintiffs. Id. at 403. Because Plaintiffs here have not submitted any 
comparable evidence, the Court does not discuss that analysis. "
828,15," Georgia-Pacific was never a party to the Direct or Indirect Purchaser Actions, and [**44]  USG and TIN have settled."
828,16," The parties disagree slightly about the precise percentage. The Court has indicated a range to capture the positions of both 
parties."
828,17," Georgia-Pacific acquired the assets of TIN in July 2013. These numbers reflect market shares at the time of the events giving 
rise to this case, which predated the acquisition."
828,18," Gypsum Specialty Dealers serve the commercial construction and new residential construction industries and sell wallboard to 
builders, contractors, and sub-contractors."
828,19, Independent building material dealers [**45]  and lumber yards sell other building materials in addition to wallboard.
828,20, Lumber yard buy-groups are collections of lumber yards that attempt to leverage their combined buying power.
828,21, Two-step distributors purchase wallboard and other construction materials and sell those products to lumber yards. 
829,22," Plaintiffs object to the use of Defendants' evidence that stems from before 2010 because the Court limited the discovery 
period to 2010-2013. The Court acknowledges Plaintiffs' objection but the facts merely provide background information."
829,23," Plaintiffs dispute that USG's customers abused job quotes, but they do not provide evidence to create a fact dispute about 
whether the other manufacturers were impacted by job quote abuses."
829,24," Plaintiffs submit evidence that Defendants had a presence at the following trade shows and customer-sponsored events: 
Association of the Wall and Ceiling Industry's (""AWCI"") Interior Exterior Commercial Construction (""INTEX"") Expo in April 2011 
and 2012 and AWCI's Industry Executives' Conference & Committee Week in September 2011 and 2012 (PSOF ¶¶ 447-51); 
Global Gypsum Conference in October 2011 (PSOF ¶ 463); the Annual Meeting of AMAROK (a group of gypsum specialty 
dealers), held in April 2011 and 2012; the semi-annual meetings of the Drake Group (association of gypsum special dealers), "

475-77); the semi-annual shows of LMC (collective buying group) held in March 2011 and March 2012 (PSOF ¶¶ 478-
80). [**49]"
830,25," Plaintiffs submit evidence that Defendants had a presence at Gypsum Association events in March 2011, June 2011, October 
2011, March 2012, July 2012, and October 2012. PSOF ¶¶ 452-62. "
831,26," The lower federal courts uniformly interpreted this statement as requiring a hearsay proponent in the co-conspirator context to 
present independent evidence of the conspiracy, without any reference to the hearsay statement itself. See, e.g., United States 
v. Rodrigues, 491 F.2d 663, 666 (3d Cir. 1974) (""In order to be properly admitted under the co-conspirator exception to the 
hearsay rule, there must be independent evidence linking the declarant to the defendant."")."
831,27," As indicated by the citation, In re Japanese Electronic Litigation is the Third Circuit opinion that was reversed by Matsushita 
Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986), a case that this Court has 
already discussed in the section on legal analysis in oligopoly cases."
831,28," The judge was Edward R. Becker, who later became Chief Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. "
834,29," The Court notes National's objection to the admissibility of Ex. 1515 under the hearsay exceptions due to the memorandum 
containing the subjective impressions of the analyst. The Court disagrees. See Big Apple BMW, 974 F.2d at 1372-74; United 
States v. SKW Metals & Alloys, Inc., 195 F.3d 83, 88-89 (2d Cir. 1999)."
834,30," The excerpts from Mr. Braverman's testimony that are presented here do not specifically identify the dealers. But, in light of 
other evidence presented in the case, the Third Circuit concluded that that the identity of the dealers implicated by Mr. Mitchell's 
statement was sufficiently clear."
834,31," The BMW distributor also made an additional argument relevant to the exclusion of this evidence. Because the BMW leasing 
agent categorically denied ever making the statements, the BMW distributor attempted to exclude (1) Mr. Braverman's 
recollection of the conversation with the BMW leasing agent and (2) the dealers' underlying communications with the BMW 
leasing agent. The Third Circuit rejected this argument, noting that the admissibility of co-conspirator statements under Rule 
801(d)(2)(E) ""is premised upon our adversarial system rather than in reliance upon indicia of reliability or trustworthiness,"" and 
it [**64]  is ""the factfinder [who] must decide which of the diametrically opposed witnesses is truthful."" Id. "

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83409, 2009 WL 2920851 at *2 (D. Del. Sept. 14, 2009) (admitting, with conditions, co-conspirator statements); 
Consol. Credit Agency v. Equifax, Inc., No. 3 - 1229, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31061, 2004 WL 5644363, at *13 n.19 (C.D. Cal. 
Aug. 5, 2004) (stating ""on a motion for summary judgment the Court may conditionally consider hearsay evidence, subject to a 
subsequent determination as to whether plaintiffs can prove the existence of the conspiracy as well as the participation of the 
declarant in the conspiracy.""). "
837,33," The Court will occasionally reference paragraphs from Plaintiffs' Supplemental Statement of Facts (""PSOF"") or Defendants' 
Statement of Facts (""DSOF""), rather than citing to the underlying exhibits. The Court is not relying on the statement of facts as 
evidence; it is using the reference merely as shorthand to refer to the exhibits listed in the statement of facts' paragraphs. "
859,34," ""It is argued that a preponderance of the evidence test usurps the function of the jury to determine whether a conspiracy 
exists. This has surface appeal until it is remembered that what is involved here is a ruling on the admission or exclusion of 
particular evidence, and on this question only. As with all such judicial decisions on admissibility, the effect upon the outcome 
may be profound, [**126]  but this comes from the ruling itself and not from the manner in which the law requires the trial judge 
to make it."" James R. Snyder Co. v. Associated Contractors of Am., Detroit Chapter, Inc., 677 F.2d 1111, 1117 (6th Cir. 1982). "
862,35," Defendants object to Plaintiffs' interpretation on Dr. Barry Harris's testimony, arguing that in this context Dr. Harris was 
explaining [**137]  the types of actions that Certain Teed undertook in making its announcement. The Court rejects this reading. 
Although Dr. Harris was discussing the steps Certain Teed took, Dr. Harris also agreed that there were ""important business 
reasons"" for a company to take steps such as those taken by CertainTeed and that he would expect a company to take similar 
measures prior to making a decision to eliminate job quotes, dramatically increase prices, and shift to calendar-year pricing."
862,36," Plaintiffs argue that ""to the extent USG varied its price increase amounts, such variation is attributable to existing differences 
in prices prior to January 1, 2012."" Pls. Resp. DSOF ¶ 655. "
863,37," The letter was misdated as October 3, 2012. Ex. 1299."
863,38," Plaintiffs attempt to make much of the fact that Defendants used similar language in their letters to customers in fall 2011. But 
it is undisputed that Defendants received copies of the other manufacturers' letters through [**141]  legitimate means after each "
864,," manufacturer made its announcements public (e.g., the announcement was forwarded from costumers to manufacturers). Thus, 
the Court does not consider the similarity of the language used in the manufacturer's letters probative. See Elevator Antitrust 
Litig., 502 F.3d 47, 51 (2d Cir. 2007) (declining to find an inference of conspiracy from the defendants' similar contract language 
because ""[s]imilar contract language can reflect the copying of documents that may not be secret""). "
865,39," Defendants make a hearsay objection to Ex. 167. The Court rejects this objection because the document is being used to 
show notice and is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. "
866,40," Consistent with Third Circuit precedent, the Court is not considering Plaintiffs' evidence of suspicious intercorporate and 
internal communications among manufacturers' low-level employees. See In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., 385 F.3d 350, 368 (3d 
Cir. 2004) (HN22[
] ""[P]rice discussion among low level sales people has little probative weight.""); In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 125 (3d Cir. 1999) (""Evidence of sporadic exchanges of shop talk among field sales representatives who 
lack pricing authority is insufficient to survive summary judgment.""). "
867,41," Defendants have attempted to provide the basis for Mr. Metcalf's statement after the deposition. But the fact remains that Mr. 
Metcalf was unable to explain the basis at the deposition, even after preparing for four days. Pls. Response Br. at 26 n.47; Ex. 
1124 (Metcalf dep.) at 140:19-143:11."
867,42," Although Mr. Metcalf writes his email with the conditional ""may,"" the Court finds that a jury could consider this email more than 
mere industry rumor in light of the senior leadership position of the author of the email and the timing of the email in relation to 
the Las Vegas trade meeting. See In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 135 (3d Cir.1999) (""[The] desultory collection of 
information 'on the street' by sales representatives is far removed from a concerted reciprocal exchange of important pricing and 
marketing information by the officers of major companies, particularly an exchange pursuant to an agreement."")."
867,43," Defendants have not raised any evidentiary objections to these emails, even though all of them came up in Plaintiff's 
Statement of Facts, in Defendants' reply briefing, and/or at the November 23 hearing. See PSOF ¶ 26 and 198, Joint Reply at 2, 
21, and 32, and Hearing Tr. at 25-26, 29-31 (counsel for Certainteed), and 128-29 (all discussing Ex. 1165); PSOF 210 
(discussing Ex. 1482); Joint Reply at 31 n.14, 70 (discussing Ex. 2098). "
868,44," Mr. Powers and Mr. Duval also had other calls in 2011, including May 17, 2011 (19 minutes), July 13, 2011 (18 minutes), and 
August 18, 2011 (31 minutes). Defs. Resp. to PSOF ¶ 28 (a)."
868,45, Ex. 1515. 
869,46," The Third Circuit has explained that the single use of a term synonymous with agreement ""in a highly competitive business 
environment and in the face of continuing fierce competition is as consistent with independent behavior as it is with price-fixing."" 
In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 127 (3d Cir. 1999). But the facts of Baby Food are distinguishable from the facts in 
this case. Most significantly, here, unlike Baby Food, the speaker who used the word ""agreements"" was a member of the senior 
leadership at National, not a low-level employee."
869,47," The Court has previously described Thompson Research Group in greater detail. In re Domestic Drywall Antitrust Litigation, 
300 F.R. D. 234 (E. D. Pa. May 15, 2014)."
869,48," The Court notes that both Ms. Thompson and Mr. Miling have testified under oath (and Mr. Shmois has similarly declared) that 
they were not aware of any unlawful agreement and they never promised to convey information in support of one. DSOF ¶¶ 
1183-1185. Those denials, however, are not dispositive on the issue of whether Defendants used Thompson and Longbow as 
unwitting conduits to transmit information to themselves."
869,49," ""A 'facilitating practice' is an activity that makes it easier for parties to coordinate pricing or their behavior in an anticompetitive 
way. It increases the likelihood of a consequence offensive to antitrust policy."" Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, 
Fundamentals of Antitrust Law § 14.05(B)(1) [**160]  (Wolters Kluwer Law & Business, 4th ed. 2015 supp.). ""[T]he label 
'facilitating practice' is only an invitation to further analysis, not a license for automatic condemnation."" Id. And the labeling of a 
practice as a facilitating practice is not a permanent one, but rather, it is made on a case-by-case basis. Id. "
871,50, Neither party cited this case.
871,51," One older case, not cited by either party, rejected allegations that the defendant car manufacturers used a large national 
leasing and car management company, a trade association, and an individual dealer as conduits to exchange ""mutual 
assurances that each would eliminate or substantially reduce fleet price concessions if the other did. United States v. General 
Motors Corp., No. 38219, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6569, 1974 WL 926, at *11-14, *18 ¶¶ 67-88, 118 (E. D. Mich. Sept. 26, 1974). 
The opinion does not, however, go into detail on precisely why the theory failed. "
872,52," Defendants also cite Mayor and City Council of Balt., Md. v. Citigroup, Inc., 709 F.3d 129 (2d Cir 2013), a case that turns the 
conduit theory on its head by suggesting the use of conduits undercuts evidence of a direct agreement between defendants. The 
Court is unpersuaded by the reasoning in this non-binding case and declines to address it."
872,53," Although there is no proof of receipt by another Defendant, in December 2012, a line from notes on a call that Longbow made 
with Mr. Weisbruch wound up appearing in a Longbow report. Ex. 2167. (AMA report); Ex. 1706 (call notes); Ex. 1674 (""taking 
an increase. I think it's as simple as that. They're going to take one.""). And in April 2012, after Mr. Weisbruch called Longbow 
(Ex. 2167 ; Ex. 1122 at 172:25-177:8), Mr. Shmois prepared an email for ""external use"" with the subject ""USG Follow Up with 
Industry Insider."" The first line explains, ""We just got off the phone with an SVP (number three in the organization) of a large 
wallboard manufacturer to get his take on the USG results."" Ex. 1600."
872,54," The sender of Ex. 2133 is redacted, but Plaintiffs have indicated their belief that the sender was Craig Weisbruch (VP of Sales 
and Marketing, National). Pls. Resp. to SOF ¶ 774 (misciting the exhibit number). The actual sender is irrelevant, however, 
because the Longbow report attributes the quotes from this email to a ""manufacturer."" Ex. 1342."
872,55," The October 11 report and September 21 email both state: ""I think this is the beginning of the manufacturers telling the market 
that we have to have a 'fair' price for our goods that allows us to make a profit and stay in business. Because the economic 
outlook for housing continues to be quite dark, and may be for some time to come, we have to find some way to get into the 
black I don't know what the end result will be, but see it as a constructive attempt to bring [**169]  some sanity to pricing."" Ex. 
1342 (report); Ex. 1277 (Sept. 21 email). The October 11 report and October 10 email both state: ""This is potential game changing event and yet it is occurring in a very 
depressed market. It's normal for the distributors to be skeptical and scared. It's an opportunity for them to get a little needed 
margin but they are fearful . . . I expect a lot of pleading and lying over the next few months as the job policy and price increase 
amount becomes more clear. Keep in mind, we are moving to a new paradigm where the distributor is taking ALL the 
responsibility for the quote he is making. Previously he had the luxury of having the manufacturer absorbing all the downside 
risk. . . . So the situation is still unclear, and if you're a distributor quoting longer term work it's difficult to know what to do. As 
usual they are all watching what L&W is doing as signal to what USGs real intention is."" Ex. 1342 (report); Ex. 2133 (Oct. 10 
email). "
873,56," Compare Ex. 1515 (notes from Sept. 2011 meeting with National); [**170]  with Ex. 1346 (10/2/2011 Thompson flashnote, 
Lafarge copy)"
873,57," Compare Ex. 1515 (June 2012 meeting with National Gypsum) (""2013 price increases? A: verbal agreements[]for a large price 
increase in 2013. EXP is already out for guidance for 25%-30%""); with Ex. 1260 (USG copy of July Thompson report stating 
""TRG industry contacts are also telling us that manufacturers are discussing a sizable 2013 price increase to distributors (25%-
30%), and we expect the industry will go on allocation by October. [. . .] Going forward, we remain acutely focused on ensuring 
that there aren't any cracks in the job quote elimination efforts.""); compare also Ex. 1499 (Ms. Thompson asks Mr. Weisbruch in 
an email, ""Do you think the industry will follow EXP's lead?"" Weisbruch responds, ""I'd be surprised if they didn't. As I've told you 
for the last six months or so, I feel like my competitors have legitimately tried to get the price up.""); with Ex. 1259 (""TRG Opinion. 
Elimination of job quotes/price protection would be a positive for the wallboard industry, in our opinion. For this to work, however, 
all wallboard manufacturers would need to fall in line, and initial checks suggest this could be possible."")."
873,58, The price increase discussed in this quote refers to an increase prior to the one announced in September 2011.
873,59," Longbow meant ""just"" literally. See Ex. 2030 (email from PABCO source to Miling at 11:03 a. m. on October 12, 2011); Ex. 
1278 (11:07 email from Miling to Weisbruch regarding what Miling ""just heard from your counterpart at PABCO""); Ex. 1122 
(Miling dep.) at 100:3-103:1. "
874,60," Portions of this document, including the identification of some of the referenced manufacturers, were redacted until shortly 
before the oral argument. Longbow, which had initially requested the redaction, withdrew the request. However, because of the 
redaction, there was not deposition testimony of Mr. DeMay or Mr. Milling about the identities mentioned in the memo, because it 
was still redacted as of the date of deposition."
874,61," Both documents say: ""It remains to be seen what Certain Teed does in the short and [medium]-term with their new North 
Carolina plant, and subsequently how [while Lafarge said ""National,"" Longbow changed its language to ""competing 
manufacturers""] will respond. When firing up a plant you need to run it full on for three days a week, which equates to about 5M 
board feet each week. Clearly, you can only stockpile so much and this may indeed displace some of the other plants in the 
Carolinas (National) and Virginia (USG). How CertainTeed acts - that is, will they cut the price - remains to be seen . . . we can 
adjust to that - it won't kill the increase. [. . .] These are all known issues that we are prepared for and have contingency plans 
set in place."" "
875,62," Compare Ex. 1280; with Ex. 2081 p. 7-8 (""Those who are down substantially are the ones who are supplying Lowes, as they 
are now trying to play catchup with Home Depot, who went to stocking Lightweight wallboard almost exclusively. What LOW has 
done is implemented a 2 week like review for all of its stores in patches . . . . When the industry releases volumes mid-month, I 
would expect to see industry volumes down in the mid to high single-digits."")."
875,63," Many of National's interactions with Longbow via Mr. Weisbruch have been detailed above, as have several of Lafarge's. As to 
PABCO, see e. g., Ex. 1257. As to CertainTeed, see e.g., Ex. 1858. As to American, see e.g., Ex. 831. "
879,64," ""The concept of 'action against self interest' is ambiguous . . . . [R]efusing to raise or lower prices unless rivals do the same 
could be against a firm's self-interest but nevertheless could spring from independent [**190]  behavior."" In re Baby Food 
Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 122 (3d Cir. 1999)."
879,65," The Court believes that HN28[
] evidence of a defendant declining to pursue another manufacturer's customer could be 
viewed as inconsistent with a competitive market. But, [**191]  evidence that a defendant refused to adjust its list price in order 
to secure a new customer would not be so probative. See Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets, Inc. v. Darling-Delaware Co., Inc., 998 
F.2d 1224, 1244 (3d Cir. 1993) (""Areeda warns courts not to consider a failure to cut prices or an initiation of a price rise as an 
action against self-interest because it also reflects the interdependence of the industry.""). Plaintiffs ask the Court to make 
inferences that Defendants refused to compete with each other for customers, but most of the evidence they offer reflects 
Defendants refusing merely to adjust their list price to secure a new customer. See, e.g., Ex. 1553 (USG refusing to accept a job 
because it violated the pricing policy they established in September 2011); Ex. 1563 (Lafarge declining to pursue a customer 
because they did ""not want to be labeled as a price cutter""). The one exception is that Plaintiffs have submitted one document 
from which a jury could conclude that National declined to offer a customer National's list price because the customer had 
previously been Georgia-Pacific's customer. See Ex. 1558 (""Now would be a very bad time to solicit somebody else's long term 
customer.""). "
880,66," Mr. Kelly continued on to explain: ""But this was a time and we felt an opportunity for us to get rid of a burdensome job-quoting 
process and we felt it was worth taking the risk."" Ex. 1116 (Kelly dep.) at 182:24-183:2."
880,67," It is a well-known antitrust principle that any concerted restrictions of output are per se illegal. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. 
Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U.S. 85, 99, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984)."
880,68," Ex. 1580 (USG); Ex. 1581 (Eagle/American); Ex. 1505 (Lafarge); see also Ex. 1589 (Longbow report indicating that National, 
American, USG, PABCO, CertainTeed, and Lafarge had gone on allocation)."
880,69," Ex. 1709 (PABCO); Ex. 1711 (USG); Ex. 1712 (TIN); Ex. 2203 (Certain Teed); Defs. Resp. PSOF ¶ 440 (National); but see 
Ex. 1118 (PABCO's Kohl dep.) at 220:2-3 (""We had a plan in place that was never — never stuck to. We emptied our 
warehouses again in 2012."") "
881,70," The Court does not consider the traditional conspiracy evidence involving TIN or USG because those manufacturers have 
settled."
881,71," These statements are not admissible against Certain Teed because CertainTeed did not make any of the statements and the 
co-conspirator exception to the rule against hearsay doesn't apply as [**199]  to CertainTeed, unlike the other Defendants, 
because the Court concluded that Plaintiffs failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that Certain Teed was a member 
of the conspiracy. "
887,1," The exact nature of Hunter's business was unclear in the Complaint; however, in her motion to amend, Hunter clarifies that she 
is ""an insurance agent who helps consumers obtain liability insurance for their dogs."" ECF No. 39, at 5. "
888,2," Hunter's opposition to Robertson's motion to dismiss, ECF No. 38, and her opposition to Holsinger's motion to dismiss, ECF 
No. 39, are largely identical in their recitation of new facts. For simplicity, the Court will cite to ECF No. 39 for all material 
identically presented in both motions."
888,3," Hunter does not say who the other parties in the suit were, only that she was one of the defendants. ECF No. 39, at 9."
888,4," Though this is a legal conclusion and need not be taken as true by the Court, Hunter's reasoning on this point is important to 
understanding her perspective and subsequent claims."
888,5," Hunter ""once lived in Virginia,"" ECF No. 39, at 13, and as of January 2015 still owned rental property in Chesterfield County, id. 
at 16. Her complaint does not provide her current residence, instead stating she ""is a citizen of the United States of America and 
not a resident of Virginia, during all times relevant,"" Compl. ¶ 21, though she also states elsewhere that her state of residence is 
Massachusetts, ECF No. 39, at 33, and she mailed her Complaint from an address in California, ECF No. 2-1."
888,6," Through a request under the North Carolina Freedom of Information Act, Hunter received emails between the North Carolina 
Department of Insurance (""NCDI"") and the VBI. ECF No. 39, at 14-15. A September 11, 2014, email from an NCDI employee 
suggests to a VBI employee that the VBI take action against Hunter in an [*10]  attempt to ""corral"" her. Id. "
889,7," Hunter states that the ""record in the [VBI] administrative hearing proves that the [VBI] sought to revoke Hunter's license so that 
it could cause each of Hunter's non-resident state insurance licenses to be terminated."" ECF No. 39, at 22."
889,8," The additional detail comes largely from emails between Robertson and Hunter and documents procured under the Virginia 
Freedom of Information Act (""VFOIA"") from the Staunton Police Department. See ECF No. 39, at 31 (describing the VFOIA 
request). "
892,9," Hunter argues that her motions to amend should be considered motions to supplement. ECF No. 60, at 6-9. Although most of 
the events alleged in her filings are not new, some occurred after she filed the Complaint. The standards for evaluating a motion 
to amend under Rule 15(a) and a motion to supplement under Rule 15(d), however, are nearly identical. See Walker v. United 
Parcel Serv., 240 F.3d 1268, 1278 (10th Cir. 2001)."
892,10," The definition also includes a long list of statutes whose violation counts as racketeering activity, none of which Hunter alleges 
or her pleadings implicate. "
894,11," The Court's conclusion is grounded in principles of federalism: ""To be sure, state law 'authorizes' only agency decisions that are substantively and procedurally correct. Errors of fact, law, 
or judgment by the agency are not 'authorized.' Erroneous acts or decisions are subject to reversal by superior tribunals 
because unauthorized. If the antitrust court demands unqualified 'authority' in this sense, it inevitably becomes the standard 
reviewer not only of federal agency activity but also of state and local activity whenever it is alleged that the governmental 
body, though possessing the power to engage in the challenged conduct, has actually exercised its power in a manner not 
authorized by state law."" . . . "
895,," We agree with that assessment, and believe that in [*30]  order to prevent Parker from undermining the very interests of 
federalism it is designed to protect, it is necessary to adopt a concept of authority broader than what is applied to determine 
the legality of the municipality's action under state law. Columbia,, 499 U.S. at 371-72 (quoting P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 212.3b (Supp. 1989))."
895,12," Besides Holsinger's immunity, Hunter's antitrust counts have otherwise fatal substantive flaws. Hunter cannot demonstrate, as 
required by 15 U.S.C. § 15, that Holsinger's alleged antitrust violations caused an injury to her business or property. The VBI 
revoked Hunter's license before she dealt with Robertson, rendering their business relationship invalid and foreclosing [*33]  her 
potential for future Virginia insurance sales. See Section III.G, infra. Concerning 15 U.S.C. § 1, Hunter does not demonstrate 
concerted action between Holsinger and any other party as necessary to state a claim for conspiracy, see Section III.E, infra, 
and with regard to 15 U.S.C. § 2, Hunter does not allege that Holsinger or anyone she interacted with is a participant in the "
896,," insurance market, much less one who holds monopoly power. See Estate Constr. Co. v. Miller & Smith Holding Co., 14 F.3d 
213, 220 (4th Cir. 1994) (elements of conspiracy in restraint of trade); Cavalier Tel., LLC. v. Verizon Virginia, Inc., 330 F.3d 176, 
183 (4th Cir. 2003) (elements of monopolization)."
896,13," Hunter states at various times in her pleadings that Virginia Code §§ 3.2-6540(F) and 38.2-2128 are unconstitutional, but she 
does not bring an explicit constitutional claim or provide sufficient argument for the Court to infer one. See Compl. ¶ 1, 11-13; 
ECF No. 39, at 2-3, 23. "
898,14," In one of her reply briefs in support of her motion to amend, Hunter objects to Robertson's ""conversion"" of her claim for 
""tortious interference,"" Compl. ¶ 79, into a claim for tortious interference with a business expectancy. ECF No. 60, at 15. She 
argues that her complaint ""sets forth 'tortious interference' which can be liberally construed,"" and Robertson is therefore adding 
unnecessary elements. Id. As with her RICO allegations, Hunter requests the Court to liberally construe the law rather than her 
pleadings. There is no cause of action in Virginia for tortious interference except for that which relates to a business expectancy. 
The Court cannot find otherwise, regardless of Hunter's pro se status. "
899,15," While addressing the tortious interference claim, Hunter states that ""Robertson breached her contract with [*44]  Hunter when 
she disputed her credit card transaction with Hunter on fraudulent grounds."" ECF No. 60, at 17. Hunter does not actually bring a 
breach of contract claim, and the Court need not infer one. Hunter's failure to disclose that she was not licensed in Virginia would 
be grounds for fraudulent inducement, and, as Hunter alleged, Robertson clearly terminated any agreement between them."
899,16," The Complaint does not specify whether Hunter is bringing a common law or statutory conspiracy claim. See Compl. ¶ 83. 
Hunter's proposed amendment provides a very brief argument in support of statutory conspiracy, but does so in a section titled 
""Count XIV — Common Law Conspiracy and Statutory Conspiracy . . . ."" See ECF No. 38, at 33-34; ECF No. 39, at 35-36. In the "
900,," interest of deciding any potentially valid claim on the merits, Rankin, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10749, 2015 WL 412850, at *1, the 
Court will consider both forms. "
904,1," The breach of contract claim is being brought solely on behalf of Plaintiffs Carrera, Hershey, Morrison, and Diaz individually. 
(ECF No. 115 at p. 49.)"
904,2, Plaintiffs do not seek certification of their tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.
904,3," Having read and considered the moving papers, and good cause failing to appear, the Court DENIES the ex parte motions 
regarding supplemental authority. The Court will disregard any new argument contained in the motions. To the extent the cases 
are relevant, the Court will locate them in its own research. "
914,4," The Court takes judicial notice of prior filings in the Diaz Action and the Carrera Action. (See ECF No. 128-1 at Exhs. A-P, U-
W.) See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689-90 (9th Cir. 2001). "
916,5," The breach of contract claim is being brought solely on behalf of Plaintiffs Carrera, Hershey, Morrison, and Diaz individually. 
(ECF No. 115 at p. 49.) "
917,6," Plaintiffs seek to certify a nationwide class. However, if the Court finds application of California law to a nationwide class to be 
inappropriate, Plaintiffs seek to certify a California class. (Mot. at p. 2, n. 2.) "
920,7," Although Defendant argues a nationwide class is inappropriate with respect to all of its claims, it has failed to meet its burden 
with respect to its remaining claims."
920,8," See Diaz Action, at ECF No. 163 (Ninth Circuit Opinion) at 18. "
922,9," During the class period, from approximately March 2003 to June 2011, First American issued approximately 1,320 different 
versions of its contract, which varied from state-to-state and year-to-year, and contained different types of coverage. (Miles Decl. 
at ¶ 8, Exhs. C, D.) "
923,10," Notably, in the real estate channel, which comprises approximately 50% of all sales, the plans are more often purchased by 
the home seller or real estate agent. (See Hand Decl. at ¶ 25.) "
924,11," The fraudulent business prong of the UCL is distinct from common law fraud, both in its elements and its remedies. In re 
Tobacco II Cases, 46 Cal. 4th at 312. ""Unlike common-law fraud claims that focus on the victim's reliance or damages, the UCL 
focuses on the perpetrator's behavior: 'to state a claim under the UCL or the [FAL] . . . it is necessary only to show that members 
of the public are likely to be deceived."" Berger, 741 F.3d at 1068 (citing In re Tobacco II Cases, 46 Cal. 4th at 312). ""Actual 
falsehood, the perpetrator's knowledge of falsity, and perhaps most importantly, the victim's reliance on the false statements — 
each of which are elements of common-law fraud claims — are not required to show a violation of California's UCL."" Id. (citing In

960,1," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides: HN1[
] Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, [**6]  in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or 
engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on 
conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any person, $1,000,000, or 
by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."
960,15, U.S.C. § 1. 
961,2, This 180-day exclusivity period can be forfeited as provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act. 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(D). 
962,3," Before Actavis was decided, the circuits were split between the ""scope of the patent test,"" see In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride 
Antitrust Litig., 544 F.3d 1323, 1332-36 (Fed. Cir. 2008), abrogated by Actavis, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343; In re 
Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 466 F.3d 187, 212-13 (2d Cir. 2006), abrogated by Actavis, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343, 
and the ""quick look"" test, under which reverse payments were considered ""prima facie evidence of an unreasonable restraint on 
trade,"" In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., 686 F.3d 197, 218 (3d Cir. 2012), vacated, Upsher Smith Labs., Inc. v. La. Wholesale Drug 
Co., Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2849, 186 L. Ed. 2d 904 (2013)."
962,4," The Court noted that it did not intend to disturb commonplace settlement forms. Whereas in a traditional settlement ""a party 
with a claim (or counterclaim) for damages receives a sum equal to or less than the value of its claim,"" in a reverse payment 
settlement, ""a party with no claim for damages (something that is usually true [**13]  of a paragraph IV litigation defendant) 
walks away with money simply so it will stay away from the patentee's market."" Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2233. "
963,5," Actavis acquired Warner in October 2013. In addition, Watson acquired Actavis in October 2012. Press Release, Watson 
Completes Actavis Acquisition, Allergan (Oct. 31, 2012). To avoid confusion with the Supreme Court case of the same name, we 
refer [**15]  to the defendants as Warner and Watson, respectively."
963,6," In response, Watson challenged the validity and enforceability of the '394 Patent based, in part, on the inconsistent studies 
regarding Loestrin 24's ineffectiveness in combatting intermenstrual bleeding. Those arguments need not be repeated here, as 
""it is normally not necessary to litigate patent validity to answer the antitrust question."" Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2236. "
964,7," Watson had otherwise forfeited its entitlement to a 180-day exclusivity period under the Hatch-Waxman Act because it had not 
obtained tentative FDA approval to market its generic Loestrin 24 within thirty months of submitting its ANDA."
964,8, Only the EPPs allege that the acceleration clause constitutes a reverse payment under Actavis.
964,9," The EPPs, but not the DPPs, list Lupin as a defendant."
964,10," The DPPs also allege that, six months after the announcement of the Warner-Lupin agreement, in April 2011, Mylan 
Pharmaceuticals (""Mylan"") sent Warner a notice containing a Paragraph IV certification announcing that it had filed an ANDA to 
market a generic Loestrin 24. In June 2011, Warner sued Mylan for infringement of the '394 Patent. In July 2013, before a bench 
trial was scheduled to begin, Warner entered a settlement and license agreement with Mylan and the case was dismissed. "
965,," Under the agreement, Mylan agreed to drop its challenge to the '394 Patent and delay entry of its generic Loestrin 24 until July 
22, 2014, again, the month that the '394 Patent was scheduled to expire. The DPPs do not detail the specific provisions of the 
agreement, nor do they allege that the Mylan agreement gives rise to independent antitrust claims."
965,11," In addition, the defendants provided independent grounds for dismissing the state antitrust and unjust enrichment claims, none 
of which are relevant here. "
968,12," There is some dispute as to how the five considerations should factor into antitrust litigation going forward. Whereas the 
district court construed the five considerations as ""guid[ing] the inquiry as to whether a settlement payment satisfies the rule of 
reason,"" In re Loestrin, 45 F. Supp. 3d at 190, the DPPs contend that these considerations were proffered only as justifications 
for why subjecting reverse payments to antitrust scrutiny outweigh the public policy in favor of settlements. We agree with the 
DPPs that the five considerations should not overhaul the rule of reason, nor should they create a new five-part framework in 
antitrust cases. HN11[
] We note, however, that there is overlap between the five considerations and the preexisting elements of the rule of 
reason. For example, the First Circuit's rule of reason analysis queries, among other things, whether the ""agreement involved 
the exercise of power in a relevant economic market."" Stop & Shop Supermarket Co., 373 F.3d at 61. In that same vein, Actavis 
explains how to evaluate the market power question: ""the size of the payment from a branded drug manufacturer to a 
prospective generic is itself a strong indicator of [**32]  power."" Actavis, 133 S. Ct. at 2236 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Similarly, the First Circuit rule of reason includes as an element the anticompetitive consequences of the alleged agreement, and 
the first of the five considerations articulated by the Supreme Court explains that a reverse payment may have significant 
anticompetitive effects where it ""amounts to a purchase by the patentee of the exclusive right to sell its product."" Id. at 2234. "
980,1," At the hearing, Graphic referenced  (""Bard I""). In Bard I, the Eighth Circuit did analyze a discount bundling theory wherein the 
Court seemed to, at least implicitly, endorse a discount bundling test requiring a below cost pricing component after attributing 
the entire discount on all products within a package to the competitive product. See Bard I, 616 F.3d at 893. However, Bard I 
was vacated shortly after its publication and decided on alternative grounds while making no reference to the discount bundling 
theory. See Southeast Missouri Hosp. v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 642 F.3d 608 (8th Cir. 2011) (""Bard II""). Due to the Eighth Circuit's Bard 
II decision, this Court will place no precedential value on Bard I in determining how the Eighth Circuit may, in the future, evaluate 
a discount bundling antitrust claim. "
985,2," Graphic also challenges the viability of Inline's bundled discount and sham litigation theories for vagueness and lack of 
sufficient supporting facts. For example, Graphic highlights that the Complaint does not identify the actual products contained in 
the bundled discounts, the prices of those bundles, or the specific lawsuits and contents of litigation threats. The Complaint is 
not particularly detailed, but it does state enough facts to raise plausible claims for relief on its face. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 
570. The Complaint goes beyond threadbare recitations of the elements of the claims asserted here—it asserts that Graphic 
bundled susceptor and paperboard packaging and that Graphic made sham litigation threats based on expired or inapplicable 
patents. Indeed, HN16[
] Rule 8 ""does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned, the- defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me-accusation."" Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. At 1949  [**31] (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Inline has 
satisfied this pleading standard. "
987,3," Graphic additionally argues that Inline lacks standing to assert antitrust claims based on threats and litigation directed at third-
party manufacturers. See Disenos Artisticos E. Industriales, S.A. v. Work, 676 F. Supp. 1254, 1286 (E.D.N.Y. 1987) (stating that 
the defendant ""has no standing to challenge allegedly coercive lawsuits brought against other parties""). The Complaint generally 
refers to sham litigation activities against ""competitors"" and ""smaller rivals."" Compl. ¶¶ 30, 31. The Court will resolve this 
ambiguity in Inline's favor and interpret such statements to be referring to Inline. "
990,4," In a footnote to its opposition brief, Inline states that while the design for the Smart Ones pizza packaging would have become 
public once Heinz started utilizing it commercially, Graphic saved ""valuable time"" in developing a competing design by not 
waiting until the design became public. Additionally, the footnote states that Graphic's misappropriation caused Inline to 
""abandon an existing patent application for the design."" Mem. Opp'n Mot. Dismiss at 9, n.4. In its reply memorandum, Graphic 
responds that these facts are fatal to Inline's claim because once information is disclosed in the patent application process, it 
becomes public and therefore can no longer be classified as a trade secret. Reply Supp. Mot. Dismiss at 9 (citing B.E. Meyers & 
Co., Inc. v. United States, 47 Fed. Cl. 375, 378-79 (Fed. Cl. 2000)). Although the existence of a patent application for the Smart 
Ones design may eventually be relevant in determining the existence of a trade secret, none of these facts are in the Complaint. 
On a motion to dismiss the Court is limited to the facts as asserted in the Complaint. The Court therefore will not consider these 
arguments at this time. [**47] "
992,1," On June 4, 2014, the Clerk of Court for the Northern District of California entered a Transfer Order from the United States 
Judicial Panel on Multi District Litigation, transferring this case to the Eastern District of New York. (MDL Transfer Order, Docket 
Entry No. 61.)"
992,2," On December 18, 2014, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, with the consent of the Court, ordered that 
the case be reassigned from Judge John Gleeson to the undersigned. (Order Reassigning Litigation, Docket Entry No. 88.) "
995,3," In support of their argument that cardholders directly pay interchange fees, Plaintiffs file a declaration and exhibits in support of 
their motion. (Decl. of Joseph M. Alioto [**11] , Docket Entry No. 92; see also Pls. Reply 1, Docket Entry No. 103 (arguing that 
the ""dispositive charts"" in the exhibits ""showed that the cardholder paid the money, which included the interchange fee"" and that 
the ""charts also showed, in support of the plausibility of the allegations in [P]laintiffs' complaint, that the cardholder paid the 
issuing bank, which kept the interchange fee and passed on the remainder to the acquiring bank, which kept its fee and in turn 
passed on the remainder to the merchant"").) The Court declines to consider these documents as they were not attached to the 
Complaint and were not otherwise before the Court when it decided Defendants' motion to dismiss, and, therefore, these 
documents are not properly before the Court on Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. See Drapkin v. Mafco Consol. Group, 
Inc., 818 F. Supp. 2d 678, 695 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (explaining that a moving party seeking reconsideration may ""not advance new 
facts, issues or arguments not previously presented to the Court"" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Moreover, 
Local Civil Rule 6.3 specifies that on a motion for reconsideration ""[n]o affidavits shall be filed by any party unless directed by the 
Court."" Local Civil Rule 6.3."
995,4," Plaintiffs selectively quote the Second Circuit's explanation in United States v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 344 F.3d 229 (2d Cir. 2003) 
that, ""in the market for general purpose [credit cards], the issuers are the sellers, and the cardholders are the buyers"" to 
inaccurately plead that this phrase [**14]  demonstrates that ""the Second Circuit expressly held that Cardholders are 'direct 
purchasers' for antitrust purposes."" (Compl. ¶ 50 (quoting Visa U.S.A., 344 F.3d at 239).) The Visa U.S.A decision contains no 
such holding. The standing of cardholders to bring antitrust claims, as direct or indirect purchasers, was not at issue in Visa 
U.S.A. In the phrase cited by Plaintiffs, the Second Circuit was explaining its determination that the district court had correctly 
found that the payment card networks ""compete with one another in a market for 'network services.'"" Visa U.S.A., 344 F.3d at 
239. In doing so, the Second Circuit described that consumers are ""buyers"" of payment cards, not payers of interchange fees, 
and did so to provide an explanatory contrast. Id. (emphasis in original). "
997,5," The local controversy and home state exceptions have distinct requirements, but both are similarly tailored to address claims 
involving in-state harms. Plaintiffs have not argued either of these exceptions, and it is clear that this is not a state or local issue, 
thus the exceptions are not applicable. "
998,6," Plaintiffs also allege that the anti-competitive conspiracy causes ""increased retail prices for goods and services paid by 
[c]ardholders."" (Compl. ¶ 101(h)). However, in response to Defendants' motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs expressly [**24]  state that 
they plead an injury that is ""not . . . damages from the inflated price of goods and services purchased from merchants."" (Pls. 
Opp'n to Defs. MTD (""Pls. MTD Opp'n) 13, Docket Entry No. 52). Plaintiffs also state that construing the Complaint to allege 
price inflation ""is a distortion of the allegations"" because the Complaint ""does not allege that Plaintiffs' damages are based on 
inflated costs to merchant which the merchants passed on the Plaintiffs by charging higher prices for goods and services."" (Id. at 
14.) "
1000,7," Plaintiffs argue, for the first time in seeking reconsideration, that the application of the AGC factors to claims under the 
Cartwright Act is precluded by the California Supreme Court's decision in Clayworth. (Pl. Opp'n to Defs. Cross Mot. for 
Reconsideration (""Pls. Cross Mot. Opp'n""), 3-4, Docket Entry No. 104.) Plaintiffs argue that in Clayworth, the California Supreme 
Court ""departed"" from AGC's ""principles in interpreting the Cartwright Act."" (Id. at 3.) Because Plaintiffs did not rely on this 
authority in their initial motion, they cannot do so on reconsideration. Lichtenberg, 28 F. App'x at 75 (explaining that a Court on 
reconsideration considers only overlooked decisions ""that were put before the Court on the underlying [**30]  motion""). In any 
event, the issue addressed by the California Supreme Court in Clayworth is not before this Court. The issue in Clayworth 
involved the assertion of the so-called ""pass-through defense"" by alleged antitrust conspirators, who asserted that claims 
brought by manufacturers were barred because the manufacturers conceded that they had passed the cost of the direct antitrust 
injury on to their customers. Clayworth, 49 Cal. 4th at 774. In deciding the case, the California Supreme Court did not address 
antitrust standing or the sufficiency of an antitrust injury under the Cartwright Act. Id. (noting that AGC and Vinci, as cases that 
dealt with antitrust causation, have ""nothing to say on the general topic that concerns us: when (as here) causation has been 
properly alleged, how are antitrust damages to be measured?"" (first citing AGC, 459 U.S. at 535; and then citing Vinci, 43 Cal. 
Rptr. 2d at 338)). "
1016,1," The plaintiffs are Arial Services, Inc., D.F.M. Industries, Inc., American Steel Erectors, Inc., Bedford Ironworks, Inc., and Ajax 
Construction, Inc. As plaintiffs D.F.M. Industries and Ajax Construction are most heavily involved in the foundational facts, we 
refer to them throughout as ""DFM"" and ""Ajax"" for ease. "
1022,2," We reject a number of both parties' subsidiary challenges. First, we reject Local 7's evidentiary challenges to the record. Local 
7 first takes issue with Morel's brief testimony about union workers storming the construction site at 85 New Market Street in July 
2003, as irrelevant and highly prejudicial. [**27]  See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). We see no abuse of discretion where the July 2003 
event was close in time to the Archstone Apartments project and provided context for the hostilities between the union and Ajax 
during the relevant time period. Moreover, the event was explored briefly on redirect, perhaps in response to a possible "
1023,," misimpression left by defense counsel's cross-examination of Morel regarding an unsuccessful NLRB charge against the union. 
The issue of unfair prejudice is largely left to the district court, and we see no abuse of discretion given that union intent was a 
highly contested issue at trial. Local 7's generic challenges to evidence of labor disputes, including primary lawful picketing and secondary labor activity, 
likewise fail. Despite the court's pretrial ruling allowing some measure of ""background"" evidence, Local 7 points to no trial 
objection in which it challenged testimony as out of bounds. Additionally, the jury received instructions on the difference between 
legal primary and illegal secondary union conduct, and Local 7 gives us no reason to conclude that the jury was inattentive to the 
careful line drawing it was called upon to do. See Connolly v. Roden, 752 F.3d 505, 515 n.14 (1st Cir. 2014). Next, we reject the plaintiffs' allegations [**28]  that the district court improperly foreclosed evidence at the LMRA trial of eleven 
other construction sites and that the district court abused its discretion in excluding four witnesses. The district court properly 
excluded information regarding the additional eleven job sites based on insufficient evidence that Local 7 engaged in threats, 
restraints, or coercion on any of these sites. The district court also properly exercised its discretion to exclude four witnesses that 
it deemed to be inadequately disclosed by the plaintiffs. The witnesses were not included in the plaintiffs' Rule 26 statement and 
were only referred to on a handful of occasions within a voluminous record. Although the plaintiffs contend that an amended 
Rule 26 statement is not necessary when additional information has ""otherwise been made known to the other parties during the 
discovery process,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A), HN6[
] the ""mere mention of a name in a deposition or interrogatory is 
insufficient to satisfy Rule 26(a)(1)(A)(i),"" especially where, as here, the case involves an expansive record and a multitude of 
individuals, see, e.g., Lujan v. Cabana Mgmt., Inc., 284 F.R.D. 50, 72 (E.D.N.Y. 2012). "
1027,3," To the extent the plaintiffs fault the district court for declining to engage in a free-ranging review of the defendant's behavior 
and conjure coherent claims into existence on the plaintiffs' behalf, we certainly find no error. "
1029,4," The plaintiffs continue to allege that the wage-based agreement among and between the signatory erectors and Local 7 cannot 
be sheltered from antitrust scrutiny because it involved taking deductions from laborer wages and providing contractor subsidies 
on public projects in violation of the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. §§ 3141-3148. See ASE I, 536 F.3d at 74; see id. n.5 (providing 
contours of Davis-Bacon Act). In ASE I, we recognized that ""the MRP may very well violate the Davis-Bacon Act"" to the extent it 
draws deductions from public projects or offers subsidies to contractors to win public projects. Id. at 81. We also recognized, 
however, that the plaintiffs themselves had not pursued, and likely could not pursue, a cause of action under the Davis-
Bacon [**50]  Act. Id. We left it to the plaintiffs on remand to flesh out their theory. In the final analysis, we do not believe that the 
plaintiffs have successfully landed their ""acrobatic attempt to shoehorn a possible Davis-Bacon violation into their antitrust 
claims."" Id. ""The Davis—Bacon Act was originally enacted in 1931 as a 'minimum wage law designed for the benefit of construction workers' 
which 'protects . . . employees from substandard earnings by fixing a floor under wages on Government projects.'"" Int'l Bhd. of 
Elec. Workers, Local 357, AFL-CIO v. Brock, 68 F.3d 1194, 1199 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting United States v. Binghamton Constr. 
Co., 347 U.S. 171, 177-178, 74 S. Ct. 438, 98 L. Ed. 594 (1954)). ""When Congress enacted the Davis-Bacon Act, it intended to 
remove labor as [a] competitive element."" In the Matter of: Bldg. & Constr. Trades Unions Job Targeting Programs, WAB Case 
No. 90-02, 1991 DOL Wage App. Bd. LEXIS 34, 1991 WL 494718, at *1 (June 13, 1991). When an otherwise-lawful MRP is utilized on such public projects, however, the funds deducted from the Davis-Bacon projects 
are used ""as subsidies on private sector projects,"" and the prevailing wage surveys might thereby become ""distorted to the 
extent the subsidy was distributed to [a] contractor on a private sector project."" 1991 DOL Wage App. Bd. LEXIS 34, [WL] at *6. 
""Over time, the government would pay more on Davis-Bacon . . . projects than the actual area wage rate, a result clearly outside 
the public interest and definitely not contemplated by the Congress which enacted Davis-Bacon."" Id. Although the recycling [**51]  of wages through fixed-wage public projects and competitive private projects via the MRP may 
ultimately have an anticompetitive effect, this outcome is partially a result of the Davis-Bacon Act's anticompetitive prevailing 
wage mechanism. In other words, the plaintiffs' frontal assault on the MRP seems to necessarily entail a collateral, predicate 
attack on the Davis-Bacon Act itself. Thus, while we agree that Congress presumably did not intend to permit such deductions under the Davis-Bacon Act, we find it 
equally unlikely that Congress intended the Sherman Act to provide the remedy that the plaintiffs request. See ASE I, 536 F.3d 
at 81 (noting that ""Reich and its progeny do not appear to stand for the proposition that a Davis-Bacon violation exposes an 
otherwise exempt job targeting program to antitrust liability""). Allowing particular deductions or subsidies that violate Davis-
Bacon to eviscerate the categorical protections provided against Sherman Act liability would radically alter the careful balance 
struck between labor rights and antitrust liability. That is not to say that a theory of liability more tailored to the specific offending characteristics or applications of the MRP might 
not allow for [**52]  antitrust scrutiny. Rather, it is simply to say that the plaintiffs' broadside attack on the nonstatutory exemption 
fails. The plaintiffs have attempted to pin antitrust liability on the MRP as a whole, but we think the tail fails to find the donkey. "
1030,5," The court assumed for purposes of summary judgment that spending for steel erection in the agreed-upon market exceeded 
$200 million each year since 1999, and the plaintiffs agree with this calculation. "
1031,6," As we discuss above, there may perhaps be reason to believe that a more narrowly tailored challenge to applications of the 
MRP could survive summary judgment, but the plaintiffs cannot render all contracts stemming from the MRP wholly unlawful 
under antitrust law merely by showing that the MRP sometimes functioned unlawfully under unrelated laws. As such, the 
plaintiffs cannot transform a vertical agreement entered into between a union signatory and a fabricator on the basis of price into 
an unlawful ""exclusionary"" agreement simply by pointing to a secondary JTF agreement between Local 7 and that union 
signatory. "
1032,7," It is true that Gavin of fabricator FAMM Steel testified that her company had agreed on numerous occasions to replace a 
nonunion erector with a union signatory at the behest of the general contractor or owner (and through union pressure), including 
about ""half a dozen Stop & Shops."" However, she is the only fabricator witness who testified to an apparent company 
pattern [**61]  of subcontract breaches targeting nonunion erectors. Also, the plaintiffs offered no evidence that Gavin's 
company accepted higher priced contracts with union signatories beyond the Cardi's Furniture project. On this record, we should 
not leap to a conclusion that one fabricator's potential business torts or contract breaches are indicative of antitrust liability. See 
Stop & Shop, 373 F.3d at 69. This is particularly true in view of the fact that DFM, Ajax, and other willing open-shop erectors 
continued to participate in the fiercely competitive structural steel erection market. Cf. Sterling Merch., 656 F.3d at 124 (holding 
that exclusive agreements were not proven to have impaired competition where, inter alia, distributors historically competed for 
the agreements with retailers, plaintiff succeeded in winning over one of defendant's largest customers, other avenues of 
distribution remained available, and new competitors entered the market). "
1033,8," Insofar as the plaintiffs point to Dr. Kenneth Clarkson's expert report and argue that the MRP resulted in millions of dollars in 
harm due to ""gross lost profits"" by the plaintiffs, this continues to both presume the MRP is wholly unlawful and confuse harm to 
competition with harm to competitors. More importantly, Local 7 successfully moved to preclude him from testifying at the LMRA 
trial, and the plaintiffs failed to reanimate and adequately support these arguments in their post-trial briefing."
1033,9," As with the LMRA claims, the plaintiffs gain no traction by faulting the district court for excluding evidence on the eleven other 
construction projects. The court rendered these rulings in relation to the LMRA trial, and the jury's verdict has withstood Local 7's 
appellate attack. The plaintiffs do not adequately tie their evidentiary challenges to their antitrust appeal, and we will not craft a 
connection for them. Moreover, while they had the opportunity post-trial to readdress evidentiary boundaries for the antitrust 
litigation, the plaintiffs' 2011 summary judgment pleadings nearly exclusively relied on the trial evidence. Accordingly, we have 
no need to address the merits of their arguments. "
1038,1," The meaning of ""court decision"" has been refined by the courts over time. At the time of the Schering-Upsher and Schering-ESI 
settlements, the FDA applied the interpretation that a court decision on validity or non-infringement had been rendered either 
when the Federal Circuit affirmed a district court decision, or when the time for filing an appeal [*15]  had lapsed. In Mylan 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30, 41-42 (D.D.C. 2000), the court held that ""decision of a court"" meant ""all 
court decisions, whether subsequently vacated, settled, appealed or otherwise mooted,"" and that the 180-day exclusivity period 
began on the date a district court rendered a decision of patent invalidity, non-infringement, or unenforceability. The FDA 
acknowledged that it would follow this approach prospectively in its March 2000 Guidance to Industry on this topic. "
1039,2," The facts pertinent to the current motions are drawn primarily from the parties' pleadings and respective statements filed 
pursuant to Local Rule 56.1."
1039,3," The details of this patent and its prosecution are described in the Special Master's 2009 Report and Recommendation in this 
case. In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., No. 1-1652, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126249, 2009 WL 508869, at *4-5 (D.N.J. Feb. 6, 2009). "
1040,4," As a part of the Schering-Upsher settlement, in addition to the Niacor license Upsher granted Schering licenses to its 
products [*20]  KLOR CON© 8, KLOR CON© 10, KLOR CON© M20, PREVALITE©, and pentoxifylline. (Docket Entry 843, Ex. 
1.)"
1040,5," Schering paid Upsher $28 million upon approval of the settlement by Schering's Board of Directors, $20 million on the first 
anniversary of the approval of the settlement, and $12 million on the second anniversary of the approval of the settlement. The 
settlement included payment schedules for milestones and royalties related to Schering's sales of Niacor, but Schering did not 
pursue the production and marketing of Niacor so these payments were never made. (Docket Entry 843, Ex. 1.)"
1040,6," The parties dispute the admissibility and relevance of comments made by Judge Rueter and Judge DuBois during the 
mediation process. (Defs.' SUF ESI ¶¶ 5, 11-19; Pls.' SDF ESI ¶¶ 5, 11-19.) "
1041,7," As noted above, ESI was a division of AHP, engaged in the manufacture, research, and sale of generic drugs. AHP became 
Wyeth in 2002. (First [*23]  Am. Class Action Compl. ¶ 5.)"
1041,8, The details of the rule-of-reason approach are reviewed in Section III. 
1043,9," The Third Circuit also affirmed the district court's certification [*31]  of the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff class. In re K-Dur Antitrust 
Litig., 686 F.3d at 224. "
1046,10," The questions of burdens and elements in a rule-of-reason analysis of reverse payment settlements have been addressed by 
two district courts prior to this Opinion: the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 
88 F. Supp. 3d 402 (E.D. Pa. 2015); and the District of Massachusetts in In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litigation, 42 F. "
1047,," Supp. 3d 231 (D. Mass. 2014). The California Supreme Court has also addressed the burdens required in examining a reverse 
payment settlement case under the rule of reason in In re Cipro Cases I & II, 61 Cal. 4th 116, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632, 348 P.3d 
845 (Cal. 2015). "
1048,11," In re Cipro Cases I & II focuses on the application of Actavis [*47]  to the Cartwright Act, California's state antitrust law. The 
Cartwright Act and the Sherman Act are not perfectly analogous, but both statutes have implied exceptions that ""validate 
reasonable restraints of trade"" under the rule of reason. In re Cipro Cases I & II, 348 P.3d at 855 (citing Standard Oil Co. v. 
United States, 221 U.S. 1, 31 S. Ct. 502, 55 L. Ed. 619 (1911); People v. Bldg. Maint. Contractors' Ass'n, Inc., 41 Cal. 2d 719, 
264 P.2d 31 (Cal. 1953))."
1048,12," Plaintiffs filed a motion to strike Sections I and II of Defendants' reply memorandum in support of the motion for summary 
judgment on all claims related to the Schering-ESI settlement, asserting that Defendants raised subjects in their reply brief that 
had not been raised in the moving papers for the motion for summary judgment [Docket Entry 848]. In particular, Plaintiffs 
objected to arguments related to the existence of a single conspiracy, and whether Plaintiffs could prove that Upsher's entry onto 
the market was delayed. Following oral argument on this motion on July 22, 2015 [Docket Entry 859], the Court permitted 
Plaintiffs and Defendants to submit sur-replies on the issues of whether Plaintiffs could prove a three-way conspiracy between 
Schering, Upsher, and ESI, and whether Plaintiffs could prove that entry of Upsher's generic K-Dur product was delayed by the 
alleged single conspiracy [Docket Entries 856, 858]. [*48]  Considering that both parties have had the opportunity to address 
these arguments, the Court will deny Plaintiffs' motion to strike as moot, and will consider all briefing to decide these summary 
judgment motions. "
1050,13," This figure represented the net present value of the expected revenue stream for Niacor over the product's expected lifetime, 
after subtracting the royalties Schering would pay to Upsher. (Defs' SUF Upsher ¶ 44.) "
1051,14," Furthermore, the sales forecast for Niaspan in the United States may not have been analogous to the sales forecast for Niacor 
in Europe, given Niaspan's likely position as first mover on the market. (Pls.' SDF [*60]  Upsher ¶ 123.) Europe also may not 
have been as receptive to niacin products as the United States was at the time, given that European doctors had access to 
fibrate products with the same characteristics as niacin, while American doctors did not since these drugs had not been 
approved for marketing in the United States. (Pls.' SDF Upsher ¶ 124.) "
1053,15," The Third Circuit has noted that the term ""concerted action"" is generally used as shorthand to refer to any activity meeting the 
""contract, combination or conspiracy"" element for Section 1 liability. In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d at 117 n.3. "
1055,16," Plaintiffs offer two theories as to how ESI participated in the overall conspiracy: either ESI formed a conspiracy with Schering 
and Upsher, presumably at the time of the Schering-ESI agreement; or ESI joined the Schering-Upsher conspiracy already in 
existence at the time of the Schering-ESI agreement. It is established Third Circuit law that a party who did not participate in the 
formation of a conspiracy ""may nevertheless join belatedly and become responsible for the actions that antedated his arrival 
should he knowingly 'co-operate in the common effort to obtain the unlawful results.'"" United States v. Vasquez-Uribe, 426 F. 
App'x 131, 135 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Lester, 282 F.2d 750, 753 (3d Cir. 1960)). How ESI allegedly entered the 
single conspiracy is not outcome determinative on these facts. The Court finds that the issues of interdependence and overlap 
are the key issues in this analysis, and the analysis provided herein would apply in either scenario. "
1056,17," When Schering and ESI entered into their settlement on January 23, 1998, the FDA actively enforced a Final Rule 
implementing patent and marketing exclusivity provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act known as the ""successful defense 
requirement."" 21 C.F.R. § 314.107(c)(1); Abbreviated New Drug Applications, 59 Fed. Reg. 50338, 50367 (Oct. 3, 1994). Under 
this requirement, a first-filer ANDA applicant using a Paragraph IV certification was not entitled to receive the statutory 180-
day [*78]  exclusivity period unless it had successfully defended a patent infringement suit. Id. Litigants challenged these 
requirements, and the District of the District of Columbia ruled in Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Young, 723 F. Supp. 1523 (D.D.C. 
1989), vacated as moot, 43 F.3d 712, 310 U.S. App. D.C. 61 (D.C. Cir. 1989), and Mova Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala, 
955 F. Supp. 128 (D.D.C. 1997), that the 180-day marketing exclusivity period should be granted to the first ANDA applicant 
who files a Paragraph IV certification for a specific generic drug, whether or not the applicant is sued subsequently for patent 
infringement. Conversely, the Eastern District of North Carolina ordered the FDA to enforce the successful defense requirement 
in its decision in Granutec, Inc. v. Shalala, No. 5:97-cv-485, 1997 WL 1403894 (E.D.N.C. July 3, 1997). In response to these 
decisions, the FDA published a policy clarification on November 28, 1997 that reiterated its intent to continue its enforcement of 
the successful defense requirement, at least until appeals in the 1997 cases had been completed. FDA, Policy on 180-Day 
Marketing Exclusivity for Drugs Marketed Under Abbreviated New Drug Applications; Clarification (Nov. 28, 1997). Following the 
decisions from Courts of Appeal in Mova Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Shalala, 140 F.3d 1060, 329 U.S. App. D.C. 341 (D.C. Cir. 
1998) and Granutec, Inc. v. Shalala, 139 F.3d 889 (4th Cir. 1998) (unpublished opinion) that both overturned the successful 
defense requirement, the FDA expressed its intent to no longer enforce the requirement [*79]  as of June 1998. HHS Center for 
Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Guidance for Industry: 180-Day Generic Drug Exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxman 
Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (June 1998)."
1056,18," As noted above, a first-filer ANDA applicant may receive 180 days of exclusivity upon the earlier of the first commercial 
marketing of the first-filer's generic drug under its ANDA, or a court decision of patent invalidity or non-infringement, which "
1057,," ""triggers"" the start of the exclusivity period. A court decision triggering the exclusivity period need not involve the first-filing ANDA 
applicant, however. A subsequent ANDA filer may obtain a ruling of invalidity or non-infringement, and that ruling triggers the 
first-filer ANDA applicant's exclusivity period. Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co. (3M) v. Barr Labs., Inc., 139 F. Supp. 2d 1109 (D. Minn. 
2001), aff'd, 289 F.3d 775 (Fed. Cir. 2002)."
1057,19," The Court notes that two recent district court decisions have examined whether a single conspiracy existed with a brand-name 
pharmaceutical company who entered into basically the same settlement agreement, including a reverse payment, with several 
generic companies. King Drug Co. of Florence v. Cephalon, Inc., No. 06-1797, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84818, 2014 WL 2813312 
(E.D. Pa. June 23, 2014); In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 42 F. Supp. 3d 231 (D. Mass. 2014). In the settlement 
agreements, each generic company agreed to enter the market on the same date, with a contingent launch provision. The court 
in King Drug Co. granted summary judgment on the issue of a single conspiracy between the brand-name and generic 
manufacturers. No. 06-1797, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84818, 2014 WL 2813312, at *14 (E.D. Pa. June 23, 2014). Conversely, the 
court in In re Nexium denied summary judgment on the issue of a single conspiracy. 42 F. Supp. 3d at 258. Both courts 
compared their fact pattern to two hub-and-spoke conspiracy cases in which the hub made the same agreement with a series of 
spokes: Interstate Circuit, 306 U.S. at 215-16, and Toys ""R"" Us, Inc. v. FTC, 221 F.3d 928, 930, 935-36 (7th Cir. 2000). These 
cases relied on findings of interdependence and the presence [*83]  of ""plus factors,"" predominantly an assessment of each 
spoke's economic interest, to establish that the parties tacitly cooperated. See Interstate Circuit, 306 U.S. at 222; Toys ""R"" Us, 
221 F.3d at 936. In re Nexium, King Drug Co., Interstate Circuit, and Toys ""R"" Us are all distinguishable from the instant case, 
because all of the alleged spokes in those cases made the same vertical agreement with their respective hub, at or around the 
same time. But the Schering-Upsher and Schering-ESI settlements differ in their material terms. Schering's settlement with 
Upsher set a different generic entry date from the Schering-ESI settlement, and the generic companies did not receive the same "
1058,," consideration for their agreements. (Docket Entry 843, Ex. 1; Docket Entry 843-52.) Unlike in the cases referenced above, the 
parties in this case did not settle in a near-contemporaneous fashion: Schering settled with Upsher in June 1997, while Schering 
settled with ESI in January 1998. (Id.)"
1058,20," See, e.g., In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., No. 1-1652, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126249, 2009 WL 508869, at *24 (D.N.J. Feb. 6, 
2009) (noting that the agreements in this case did not manipulate the 180-day exclusivity period to create a ""bottleneck"" blocking 
the entry of other generic companies onto the market, as Upsher could have transferred or relinquished its exclusivity right, and 
furthermore that because the successful defense requirement existed when Schering and Upsher settled, ""Upsher arguably was 
not entitled to the exclusivity period.""); see also In re Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., 277 F. Supp. 2d 121 (E.D.N.Y. 2003), 
aff'd, 466 F.3d 187 (2d Cir. 2006) (as amended), abrogated by FTC v. Actavis, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013). 
In 1985, generic manufacturer Barr filed the first ANDA with a Paragraph IV notice for tamoxifen, a treatment for breast cancer. 
277 F. Supp. 2d at 124-25. Brand-name manufacturer Zeneca and Barr settled the ensuing patent litigation in 1993. Id. 
Subsequently, several other generic manufacturers filed ANDAs for tamoxifen in 1994 and 1996. Id. at 126-27. While the suits 
related to these subsequent ANDAs were pending in district court, the FDA stopped enforcing the successful defense 
requirement. 466 F.3d at 195. The Second Circuit noted that the successful defense requirement [*86]  ""would have excluded 
Barr from benefitting from the exclusivity period,"" given that it settled with Zeneca. Id. In June 1998, after the FDA removed the 
successful defense requirement, Barr attempted to block final FDA approval of other generic versions of tamoxifen by asserting 
its rights to the 180-day exclusivity period. Id. "
1076,1," Goodwill is a protected property interest and harm to goodwill is a cognizable injury. See Soranno's Gasco, Inc. v. Morgan, 874 
F.2d 1310, 1316 (9th Cir. 1989). "
1078,2," Section 1111 requires that ""a registrant of a mark registered in the Patent and Trademark Office . . . give notice that his mark is 
registered by ... the letter R enclosed within a circle"" prior to bringing any ""suit for infringement."" [**22]  15 U.S.C. § 1111. 
However, ""section 1111 is not a defense to infringement, but a limitation on remedies."" mophie, Inc. v. Shah, No. SA CV 13-
01321-DMG(JEMx), 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 185196, 2014 WL 10988347, at *22 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 12, 2014) (citing United States v. 
Sung, 51 F.3d 92, 94 (7th Cir. 1995)). "
1079,3," Fiber Research argues this test does not apply, relying on a footnote in Cel-Tech, which states this test does not apply to 
""actions by consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair competition law such as ""fraudulent"" or 
""unlawful"" business practices or ""unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising."" Cel-Tech, 20 Cal. 4th at 187, n. 12. The 
Court disagrees. This is not an action by a consumer and the Court is not applying this test to the other prongs of the UCL. "
1083,1," National Bankruptcy Services, LLC, (""NBS"") was named as a defendant but is a nominal party to this lawsuit. NBS replaced 
Cal-Western Reconveyance Corporation as the trustee in the deed of trust encumbering the party at issue. Plaintiff fails to state 
any facts that materially tie NBS to any alleged wrongdoing. (ECF No. 1, p. 6.)"
1083,2," The Court GRANTS Defendant's Request for Judicial Notice to the extent that the Court uses the documents adduced in this 
Order. (ECF No. 10.) "
1085,3," Plaintiff provides documentation for a fourth loan modification application filed in October 2015, but did not provide 
documentation for her third loan modification application. (ECF No. 11, Ex. A, pp. 14-64.) "
1091,1," Isenberg added the ""Educators Liability Insurance Fund"" as a Doe defendant, but the record gives no indication that this entity 
ever answered or participated in proceedings below. UTLA's trial brief suggested that there is [*5]  no such entity."
1091,2," The allegations vary somewhat in the different versions of the complaint filed. We focus on only the third amended complaint, 
which was operative at the time of the dismissal. "
1092,3," Isenberg also asserted a cause of action for professional negligence against Trygstad and partner Richard Schwab. Isenberg 
alleged that when he was involved in the disciplinary process with LAUSD, UTLA referred him to Trygstad, which did not 
adequately represent him. According to the complaint, Trygstad and Schwab did not disclose relevant conflicts of interest and 
failed to assert certain affirmative defenses. Isenberg dismissed this cause of action about three months before the parties were 
scheduled to go to trial. "
1093,4," Government Code section 3543, subdivision (a) provides that public school employees may form [*9]  and join unions, and that 
those unions may be exclusive representatives of the employees in employment relations with the employer. Subdivision (b) of 
section 3543 discusses grievance procedures. Government Code section 3543.6, subdivision (b) says it is unlawful for a union 
to ""[i]mpose or threaten to impose reprisals on employees, to discriminate or threaten to discriminate against employees, or 
otherwise to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees because of their exercise of rights guaranteed by this chapter."" "
1094,5," Respondents make a passing argument that [*15]  this case also involves the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act (Gov. Code, § 3500 et 
seq.; the MMBA), specifically Government Code section 3502, which states that employees ""shall have the right to represent 
themselves individually in their employment relations with the public agency."" Isenberg's allegations do not touch on whether 
UTLA members have a right to represent themselves in employment relations, and therefore this statute is not relevant. "
1109,1," The factual summary below, except where otherwise noted, derives from the Complaint and the documents cited or relied upon 
for the facts pleaded therein, which the Court accepts as true for the purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss. See Spool v. 
World Child Int'l Adoption Agency, 520 F.3d 178, 180 (2d Cir. 2008) ; see also Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 
152 (2d Cir. 2002) . Except where specifically quoted, no further citation will be made to the Complaint or the documents referred 
to in it. As discussed infra, documents drawn upon by the Court include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 
Assessing Civil Penalties against Barclays (the ""FERC Order""), which is referenced [**3]  in and integral to the Complaint. See 
Chambers, 282 F.3d 152-53; Int'l Audiotext Network, Inc. v. American Tel, and Tel. Co., 62 F.3d 69, 71-72 (2d Cir. 1995)."
1109,2," Electricity contracts are traded for both peak and off-peak products. Peak electricity includes power provided Monday through 
Saturday between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., excluding holidays."
1109,3," The four Western United States trading hubs that used the Daily Index Prices for peak or non-peak power are known as Mid-
Columbia, located in Washington; Palo Verde, located in Arizona; South Path 15, located in southern California; and North Path 
15, located in northern [**4]  California. "
1110,4," The FERC Report alleges that Barclays lost money on daily trading at an average of $117,404 per month."
1110,5," The four West Power Desk traders -- Scott Connelly, Daniel Brin, Karen Levine and Ryan Smith -- are named in the Complaint 
but are not defendants in this action. The traders' deposition testimony, emails, and instant messages were evidence in the 
FERC investigation, FERC Report, and FERC Order, and are thereby incorporated into the Complaint. "
1111,6," ""Product days"" denote trading of a specific contract related to a specific trading hub for a specific calendar day. ""Product 
months"" refer to the same information for a specific calendar month. "
1122,7," Under such an analysis, it would appear that California might have the most significant contacts as the state in which plaintiffs 
reside and suffered losses. However, there is no cause of action in California for unjust enrichment. See Grund v. Delaware 
Charter Guarantee & Trust Co., 788 F. Supp. 2d 226, 251 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (citing Levine v. Blue Shield of California, 189 Cal. 
App. 4th 1117, 1138, 117 Cal. Rptr. 3d 262 (Cal. Ct. App. 2010)). "
1133,1," Defendants argue that it was undisputed that Philips never attended a Crystal Meeting. See Dkt. # 689 at 30. That is true, but 
Defendants' expert admitted that physical presence was not necessary to be part of a conspiracy. See Trial Tr. Oct. 15, 2014 
[Dennis Carlton Test.] 2399:16-2400:9. Furthermore, the MDL Court itself held that parties could be conspirators even without 
attending the Crystal Meetings. See In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., No. 12-CV-4114 SI, 2013 WL 3387652, at *1 
(N.D. Cal. July 8, 2013)."
1133,2," This exchange itself provides evidence that Philips could have exchanged price and production information regarding [*21]  
TFT-LCD panels for the same time period as Epson produced such panels. Although Defendants point out testimony that Epson 
did not produce such panels in fall 2004 (see Dkt. # 696 at 22 (citing Trial Tr. Oct. 8, 2014 [Takato Imai Test.] 1942:3-19, 1943:1-
12)), this email reflects Philips' information for winter 2004-2005 and spring 2005. "
1136,1," From the ""We Just Disagree"" song, released on the Let It Flow album (Columbia Records). "
1137,2," Procaps used this amount because Local Rule 62.1(a) provides that a supersedeas bond shall be in the amount of 110% of the 
judgment (but that the Court may ""direct otherwise""). 110% of the costs award would be $190,828.88."
1137,3," Procaps did not submit any evidence of its own to support its claim of being a multi-million-dollar [*7]  company. Instead, it 
referred to Patheon's initial fees motion, which contained a section entitled ""Procaps Can Pay a Fee Award."" [ECF No. 1030]. 
The specifics of that section were filed under seal. The Undersigned has access to the unredacted, under-seal motion. [ECF No. 
1028]. The motion was accompanied by an exhibit which summarized Procaps' financial results and revealed its market value as 
of December 2012. Because the financial details were filed under seal, the Undersigned cannot discuss the specifics here. 
However, the Undersigned notes that the information fully supports Procaps' contention, assuming that its current financial 
condition has not dramatically changed from December 2012."
1137,4," Staying execution without a bond is rare. Advanced Estimating Sys., Inc. v. Riney, 171 F.R.D. 327, 328 (S.D. Fla. 1997) 
(defendants ""must post a full security supersedeas bond under normal conditions and courts ""should only allow lesser bonds on 
extraordinary occasions""). A bond secures the rights of the non-appealing party. United States v. O'Callaghan, 805 F. Supp. 2d "
1138,1321," , 1324 (M.D. Fla. 2011) (a bond ""compensates [the prevailing party] for delay in the entry of final judgment""). The appealing 
party must ""objectively demonstrate"" the stay is appropriate. Poplar Grove Planting & Ref. Co., Inc. v. Bache Halsey Stuart, Inc., 
600 F.2d 1189, 1191 (5th Cir. 1979) (explaining that full a full security supersedeas bond is the ""usual requirement""); United 
States v. Dornbrock, No. 06-61669—CIV, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51331, 2008 WL 2894829, at *1 (S.D. Fla. 2008). Parties seeking a stay without bond must present an alternative form of security or at least present a specific ""financially secure 
plan"" to pay a judgment after the appeal. Riney, 171 F.R.D. at 328 (citing Poplar Grove, 600 F.2d at 1191). ""Even if a judgment 
debtor presents sufficient reason to depart from the requirement of a full bond, Poplar Grove strongly suggests that the judgment 
debtor must provide substitute security that 'furnish[es] equal protection to the judgment creditor.'"" O'Callaghan, 805 F. Supp. 2d 
at 1325 (quoting Poplar Grove, 600 F.2d at 1191). "
1139,5," See generally, the song ""Disagreement,"" by Chumbawamba (""but now we both agree that we disagree""). 
(http://www.metrolyrics.com/disagreement-lyrics-chumbawamba.htl , last visited March 11, 2016)."
1139,1," Interest accrues from the date of the original Order of Final Judgment [ECF No. 1021] entered on October 29, 2015. See 
BankAtlantic v. Blythe Eastman Paine Webber, Inc., 12 F.3d 1045, 1052 (11th Cir. 1994) (""When a district court taxes costs 
against a losing party, the award of costs bears interest from the date of the original judgment.""). "
1143,*," Other decisions hold that American Pipe tolling is irrelevant and that it is more appropriate to analyze the severed Tinoco 
suits [*12]  under Rule 15(c)(1)(B). See, e.g., Ballard v. Ill. Bell Tel. Co., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 143163, 2015 WL 6407574, at *3 
& n.1 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 21, 2015). Both Balmes and Illinois Bell agree that American Pipe tolling is the correct framework for "
1144,," analyzing this suit, so the court need not address Rule 15(c)(1)(B) here. For the undersigned's analysis of the Rule 15(c)(1)(B) 
issue, see Scott v. Ill. Bell Tel. Co., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30905, 2016 WL 910507 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 10, 2016). "
1158,1, Subsequent consolidated complaints have been filed generally alleging the same conspiracy.
1158,2," ""SMF"" refers to the parties' chart of facts, including undisputed material facts, as reflected in Docket Number 957-1. Unless 
otherwise noted, the references to the material facts include the underlying evidence referenced by either party in support of the 
fact. "
1167,1," Simon has filed two motions to strike certain exhibits and factual assertions. [DE 156, 159]. Having reviewed each of the 
respective filings, the Court has determined that none of the exhibits or facts that are subject to the motions are necessary to the 
resolution of the motions for summary judgment. Accordingly, both motions to strike are denied as moot. "
1171,2," There are other methods, too, such as using differential pricing, e.g., Collins Inkjet Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 781 F.3d 264, 
270-73 (6th Cir. 2015), or adopting policies or designing a product such that the tied product is the only viable economic option 
to use in concert with the tying product, e.g., Smith v. eBay Corp., No. C 10-03825, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1211, 2012 WL 
27718, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 5, 2012), though those are not at issue here. See also Herbert Hovenkamp, Federal Antitrust Policy: 
The Law of Competition and its Practice § 10.4, p. 550 (5th ed. 2016) (""Clearly, if a seller freely permits the buyer to take or 
decline a second product there is not tie. The buyer must somehow be forced, or coerced, [*20]  into accepting the tied product. 
This coercion could result from (1) an absolute refusal to sell the tying product without the tied product; (2) a discount, rebate or 
other financial incentive given to buyers who also take the tied product; (3) technological design that makes it impossible to sell 
the tying product without the tied product.""). "
1175,3," For what it's worth, Taylor has arguably been narrowed by the Seventh Circuit, e.g., [*36]  Limestone Dev. Corp. v. Village of 
Lemont, Ill., 520 F.3d 797, 800-802 (7th Cir. 2008); CSC Holdings, Inc. v. Redisi, 309 F.3d 988, 992-93 (7th Cir. 2002), and has 
been criticized by other district courts in this circuit to the extent that at least one district court has refused to follow it even in the 
copyright context, finding itself ""powerfully convinced"" that the Seventh Circuit would reverse Taylor once given the chance, 
Leventhal v. Schenberg, 917 F. Supp. 2d 837, 845-46 (N.D. Ill. 2013). See also Champion Labs., Inc. v. Cent. Ill. Mfg. Co., No. 
14 C 9754, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4641, 2016 WL 164364, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 14, 2016) (describing the limitations and criticisms 
of Taylor, but nonetheless following its holding in a copyright case). "
1178,4," Other stores at Heritage Square whose co-tenancy provisions were not met opened anyway, possibly for that reason. "
1180,5," In fact, the same state court denied Simon's motion to dismiss Gumwood's state antitrust claims as untimely. [DE 151-2, -3]."
1180,6," She contends that the proper method is actually to calculate the amount of reduced rent that Heritage Square collected as a 
result of the loss of Ann Taylor as a tenant. After subtracting certain costs and expenses, she arrives at a net difference of 
$28,739 in loss to Gumwood based on Ann Taylor's absence. "
1181,7," States also take various approaches as to whether plaintiffs' recoveries should be reduced where they are able to negotiate 
discounts on expenses incurred as a result of the injury in question. Those cases seem inapplicable here, though, where both 
the loan and its non-recourse [*59]  terms were in effect prior to the injury. "
1183,1," At 6:30 p.m. on March 18, 2016, Tribune filed an Ex Parte Application [*2]  to File a Sur-Reply. (Dkt. No. 17.) The Court 
GRANTS that application. However, the court has reviewed Tribune's sur-reply and it does not change the analysis herein. "
1190,1," Cigna's state law claims against SurgCenter and Westminster are brought under Maryland law, as both are Maryland limited 
liability companies operating in Maryland, while its state law claims against the remaining ASCs are brought under Colorado law, 
as they are all Colorado entities. (ECF No. [**4]  17 ¶¶ 16-21, 218, 225, 233, 240, 248, 254.) Each of Cigna's state law claims 
asserts that the ASCs' conduct gives rise to a claim under both Maryland and Colorado law. (Id. ¶¶ 218, 225, 233, 240, 248, 
254.)"
1190,2," Cigna also brought additional counterclaims under ERISA, Colorado Criminal Code § 18-4-405, RICO, and COCCA, as well as 
state law claims alleging fraud and negligent misrepresentation, all of which were previously dismissed. (ECF No. 80.) "
1192,3," The Colorado Antitrust Act is the state law analogue to the Sherman Act. See Colo. Rev. Stat. § 6-4-119 (""the courts shall use 
as a guide interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable federal antitrust [**12]  laws""). Because federal antitrust 
law principles apply to both the federal and state antitrust claims, the Court will analyze both claims together. See Four Corners 
Nephrology Assocs., P.C. v. Mercy Med. Ctr. of Durango, 582 F.3d 1216, 1220 n.1 (10th Cir. 2009). "
1194,4," While there is no requirement that a competitor be eliminated to establish an antitrust injury, the ASCs' citation to Full Draw 
Products is inapposite where no such elimination has occurred. (See ECF No. 116 at 46 (quoting Full Draw Prods., 182 F.3d at 
755 (""The mere fact that the number of competitors after the boycott matches the number before . . . does not cure the 
anticompetitive effect of the boycott, which is the elimination of a competitor by means other than 'the economic freedom of 
participants in the relevant market.'"")).) The cited passage from Full Draw [**18]  Products explained that an antitrust injury 
occurred when a competitor was eliminated, even though from a consumer's perspective, it had only one choice in the market 
both before and after the challenged boycott—not, as the ASCs appear to suggest, that the fact of a competitor's survival after a 
boycott has no impact on the antitrust injury analysis."
1194,5," Cigna originally sought declaratory relief under Counterclaim I as well, but that request was dismissed in a prior order. (ECF 
No. 80 at 8.) "
1195,6," Ultimately, McClenahan found that § 10-3-1116(2) did not require de novo review under the facts of that case, because the 
relevant events giving rise to McClenahan's claims occurred before the effective date of the Colorado statute and the statute 
could not be applied retroactively under Colorado law. Because the facts in this case occurred well after August 2008, no issue 
of retroactivity is raised by the facts of the instant case. "
1196,7," The same would be true for any plans at issue here that are not subject to ERISA, but as the parties have not enumerated the 
specific plans, the Court cannot determine at this stage whether any such plans exist. "
1197,8," These dates are listed in the Affidavit of Mary Ellen Cisar. (ECF No. 104.) They vary by facility as well as by which claims 
submission system was used. (Id.) "
1211,1," HN1[
] Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits any ""contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations."" 15 U.S.C. § 1."
1211,2," A merger was not possible because one of the hospitals, Catholic Health Initiatives, Inc., was prohibited from joining a non-
Catholic entity."
1211,3," In 2009, after struggling financially for three years, which plaintiff claims resulted from defendants' illegal boycott, plaintiff sold a 
49% ownership interest to Kettering Health Network, a major competitor of defendant Premier Health Partners in the Dayton 
market. The sale allowed plaintiff to gain access to Kettering's managed-care contracts with local insurance companies and 
thereby increase its patient volume. "
1212,4," The corporate defendants, in addition to Premier Health Partners, are Atrium Health System, Catholic Health Initiatives, 
MedAmerica Health Systems Corporation, Samaritan Health Partners, and UVMC."
1212,5," Our dissenting colleague does not agree that this statement from Justice Brandeis in American Needle is relevant because it 
discusses facts relating to defendants' [**8]  intent, history and coercive behavior. The objection is strange because Justice 
Brandeis's admonition is quoted at length in a case where the issue was whether the defendant was a single entity. Surely if the 
Supreme Court had thought that Justice Brandeis's factors concerning conduct and intent were irrelevant, it would not have said 
they were relevant and directed lower courts to consider them. We understand that, at least on paper, the joint venture 
agreement, written by defendants themselves, aims to legitimate the cartel. But further factual determination is required to 
resolve whether the neutral words of the agreement belie the true aim of defendants' association. We are tasked with looking at 
the evidence before us, which includes evidence of defendants' unveiled threats to plaintiff and the words of defendants' 
employees and agents concerning their views on the nature of the relationship among defendants. See Freeman v. San Diego 
Ass'n of Realtors, 322 F.3d 1133, 1150 (9th Cir. 2003) (""Defendants sabotage their theory by their own admissions. . . . Rarely 
do antitrust defendants serve up their own heads on so shiny a silver platter.""). Our colleague's refusal to consider anything "
1213,," other than the joint venture agreement is tantamount to repealing Section 1 [**9]  of the Sherman Act by allowing the cartel 
members themselves to write up the only facts to be considered. "
1217,6," The Rule states in relevant part: (d) Statements That Are Not Hearsay. A statement that meets the following conditions is not hearsay: . . . HN14[
] (2) An Opposing Party's Statement. The statement is offered against an opposing party and: (A) was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity; (B) is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true; (C) was made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject; (D) was made by the party's agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed; or (E) was made by the party's coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy "
1219,1," Citing the rule of reason seems all the more misplaced here, where plaintiff alleges that defendants' conduct constitutes a per 
se violation of § 1, not [**30]  a violation under the ""flexible Rule of Reason."" Am. Needle, 560 U.S. at 203. "
1222,2," Additionally, defendants' counsel represented at oral argument that Premier sets prices for all hospital services performed by 
physician-employees, ensuring that each hospital charges the same price for the same service. [**40] "
1227,1, GameFly provides video games on disc.
1227,2," HN4[
] A statutory price cap, indexed to inflation, is meant to assure that the Postal Service does not abuse a dominant 
position, see U.S. Postal Serv. v. Postal Regulatory Comm'n, 785 F.3d 740, 744, 415 U.S. App. D.C. 141 (D.C. Cir. 2015). This "
1228,," is not unlike rate regulation for other state-granted monopolies. The language of 39 U.S.C. § 3642 has been consistently taken 
to reflect basic antitrust concerns with market power. "
1229,3," In other words, not arbitrary and capricious, see Gundersen Lutheran Med. Ctr., Inc. v. Sebelius, 666 F.3d 1335, 1337, 399 
U.S. App. D.C. 68 (D.C. Cir. 2011); Blumenthal v. FERC, 613 F.3d 1142, 1146-47, 392 U.S. App. D.C. 175 (D.C. Cir. 2010)."
1229,4," Court precedent, and antitrust doctrine generally, recognize that market power may be exercised upstream, even where there 
is a competitive market downstream. See Coal Exporters Association v. United States, 745 F.2d 76, 84-85, 240 U.S. App. D.C. 
256 (D.C. Cir. 1984); 2B AREEDA ET. AL., ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 564 (4th ed. 2014). This effect is recognized in several other antitrust 
inquiries that involve market power, see Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., Inc., 549 U.S. 312, 127 S. 
Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2007) (finding buyer power in upstream market for inputs, despite lack of seller power in national 
downstream market for outputs); Mandeville Island Farms v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219, 68 S. Ct. 996, 92 L. Ed. 
1328 (1948) (finding market power upstream, despite lack of power downstream); EINER ELHAUGE, UNITED STATES ANTITRUST LAW AND ECONOMICS, 172, 263 (2d ed. 2011); HERBERT [***12]  HOVENKAMP, FEDERAL ANTITRUST POLICY, § 8.10 (4th ed. 2011). "
1245,1," LIBOR I is on appeal to the Second Circuit, which held oral argument on November 13, 2015. See In re: LIBOR-Based 
Financial Instruments Antitrust Litig., No. 13-3565 (Docket No. 567) (2d Cir. Nov. 13, 2015). "
1248,2," The Supreme Court's decisions in ARCO and Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477 (1977), 97 S. Ct. 690, 
50 L. Ed. 2d 701 — the principal authorities upon which the LIBOR I Court relied, see 935 F. Supp. 2d at 689-92, and upon 
which Defendants rely (although not as heavily) here (Defs.' Br. [**36]  26) — do not call for a different conclusion. As the FX 
Court explained, those cases ""were brought by competitors against their rivals, not by consumers alleging the per se wrong of 
horizontal price-fixing against colluding competitors."" 74 F. Supp. 3d at 598. The cases thus stand for the uncontroversial 
proposition that a competitor cannot use the antitrust laws to recover lost profits as a result of being confronted with an increase 
in competition. They do not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff fails to show antitrust injury if it ""could have suffered the same 
harm under normal circumstances of free competition."" LIBOR I, 935 F. Supp. 2d at 689; see In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., 
332 F.3d 896, 912 (6th Cir. 2003) (rejecting an argument that where a ""defendant could have in theory caused the same injury 
without engaging in an antitrust violation, the plaintiff has not suffered an 'antitrust injury,' even if in fact it was the antitrust 
violation that caused the actual injury in a particular case""); see also, e.g., Irvin Indus., Inc. v. Goodyear Aerospace Corp., 974 
F.2d 241, 245-46 (2d Cir. 1992) (""The possibility that [the defendant] might have submitted a lawful bid, and, if so, the same 
damage might have resulted, cannot in and of itself negate causation as a matter of law.""). "
1249,3," Applying New York choice-of-law rules, see Follman v. World Fin. Network Nat'l Bank, 721 F. Supp. 2d 158, 161 (E.D.N.Y. 
2010), Plaintiffs' state-law claims may be governed by the law of New York, Alaska, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, or Michigan (the 
last four of which are where Plaintiffs are domiciled (see AC ¶¶ 23-27)). The parties do not brief choice of law; instead, they 
appear to agree (if not explicitly, see Defs.' Br. 34 n.39, then implicitly), that the Court need not reach choice-of-law questions at 
this stage because the results would be the same under any applicable law. See Fin. One Pub. Co. Ltd. v. Lehman Bros. Special 
Fin., Inc., 414 F.3d 325, 331 (2d Cir. 2005) HN15[
] (""[W]here the court has determined that the result would be the same 
under either jurisdiction's law, it need not decide which to apply."" (emphasis omitted)). In light of that, the Court leaves choice of 
law to another day. "
1250,4," A plaintiff must also prove ""adequate performance by the plaintiff."" Fischer & Mandell, LLP, 632 F.3d at 799. That element is 
not at issue here. "
1251,5," The Court would reach that conclusion regardless of what state's law is to be applied. The law of every relevant state either 
does not recognize breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing as a separate cause of action, see Casper v. 
Combustion Eng'g, Inc., No. CV 97-0570516S, 1998 Conn. Super. LEXIS 1883, 1998 WL 389215, at *8 (Conn. Super. Ct. June 
23, 1998) (""Notwithstanding that our Supreme Court has recognized the covenant of good faith and fair dealing as a rule of 
contract construction, the covenant is widely misused and pled as a separate cause of action which generally does nothing more 
than restate a breach of contract claim.""); McCann v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 873 F. Supp. 2d 823, 848 (E.D. Mich. 2012) (""Michigan 
law does not recognize a cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing."" (internal quotation 
marks omitted)); King of Prussia Equip. Corp. v. Power Curbers, Inc., 158 F. Supp. 2d 463, 466-67 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (concluding 
that ""the courts of Pennsylvania would not entertain [plaintiff's] good faith and fair dealing claim as a separate cause of action"" 
where based on the same allegations as a breach of contract claim), or appears to recognize it as an independent cause of 
action only in limited circumstances not present [**48]  here, see Reed v. Mun. of Anchorage., 782 P.2d 1155, 1158 (Ala. 1989) 
(explaining that the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing creates an enforceable cause of action in the context of 
employment contracts)."
1251,6," The state of Alaska law on this question is less clear, but it appears that Alaska also allows separate claims for unjust 
enrichment and breach of contract to be brought in the alternative. See Reeves v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., 56 P.3d 660, 
664 (Alaska 2002) (reviewing a special jury verdict involving alternative claims of express contract and unjust enrichment claims 
without suggesting the claims cannot be pursued in the alternative). "
1257,1," According to Defendants, DirecTV, Inc. ""no longer exists,"" as it ""merged into DIRECTV, LLC, with DIRECTV, LLC as the 
surviving entity."" (Lippincott, Dkt. No. 1 at 2 n.1.)"
1257,2," On August 27, 2015, Movant Ninth Inning Inc. dba The Mucky Duck requested that the JPML centralize related actions alleging 
violations concerning the exclusive distribution of the NFL's Sunday Ticket product, ""as well as any tag-along [*4]  actions or 
other cases such as may be subsequently filed asserting related or similar claims."" (JPML MDL, Dkt. No. 1.) "
1275,1," The Court is aware that Plaintiff's Opposed Motion for Leave to File First Amended Complaint and Add Additional Parties (Doc. 
75) remains pending. However, the Court defers a ruling on that motion at this time. Should Plaintiff wish to update Exhibit 1 to 
this motion, Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint (Doc. 75-1), in light of the Court's rulings herein, it is advised to do so. "
1278,2," HN5[
] ""The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress [*12]  relating to patents, plant variety protection, copyrights and trademarks."" 28 U.S.C. § 1338."
1278,3," The Court can easily dispose of this argument. Count IV of Plaintiff's complaint is a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets 
under the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (""TUTSA""). (See Doc. 1 at ¶¶ 52-59.) It is well established that a misappropriation of 
trade secrets claim under TUTSA is not preempted by the Copyright Act because it contains an ""extra element"" of breach of 
confidentiality or improper methods, which is not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights of copyright. Beardmore v. Jacobson, 
4:13-CV-361, 131 F. Supp. 3d 656, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123365, 2015 WL 5530398, at *11 (S.D. Tex. Sept. 18, 2015); M-I 
LLC v. Stelly, 733 F. Supp. 2d 759, 786 (S.D. Tex. 2010); GlobeRanger Corp. v. Software AG USA, Inc., 3:11-CV-0403-B, 2015 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76059, 2015 WL 3648577, at *4-5 (N.D. Tex. June 11, 2015). This stands in stark contrast to trade secret 
claims under TUTSA's predecessor, the Texas Theft Liability Act (""TTLA""), which courts in this district uniformly held was 
preempted by copyright law. Beardmore, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123365, 2015 WL 5530398, at *10 (citing Spear Mktg., Inc. v. 
BancorpSouth Bank, 791 F.3d 586, 598 (5th Cir. 2015)) (""The Fifth Circuit has held theft of trade secrets under § 31.05 as 
applied to software is preempted by the Copyright Act.""). Accordingly, GSSI cannot rely on preemption of Count IV for subject 
matter jurisdiction of their declaratory judgment claims of copyright non-infringement. "
1280,4," It is important to note that BHL alleges the software was created using misappropriated trade secrets, [*19]  not that the 
software is infringing a copyright that BHL owns."
1280,5," Moreover, as mentioned in the previous section, based on the pleadings it is questionable whether Plaintiff could bring a 
copyright claim against Defendants in the first place."
1280,6," I.e., there was a valid, registered copyright, it can be compared to the software that GSSI has developed for purposes of 
copyright infringement analysis, it was copied, etc. "
1281,7," Section 2 provides: ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other 
person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be 
deemed guilty of a felony . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 2. "
1282,8," Although GSSI is not explicit in calling the litigation a ""sham,"" since there are no other allegations of ""predatory or exclusionary 
conduct,"" the Court treats GSSI's counterclaim, for the purpose of this analysis, as resting on the sham litigation doctrine."
1282,9," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine was established in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 
U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961), and United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L.

1283,10," More particularly, BHL argues that GSSI's failure to present facts that indicate BHL's conduct in filing the lawsuit would be 
actionable under a recognized tort dooms both tortious interference claims. (Doc. 27 at 25.) "
1284,11," ""The GSSI Counter-Plaintiffs had a reasonable probability of entering into a business relationship with a third party. BHL 
asserted its wanton, specious, baseless and malicious claims against the GSSI Counter-Plaintiffs with the intent of harming their 
[""GSSI's""] business and the market for their geosteering services and the GSSI Software . . . . The GSSI Counter-Plaintiffs have 
been harmed, resulting in actual damages and the loss of prospective contracts."" (Doc. 37 at 21.) "
1286,12," See infra, Section III.A.d.v."
1286,13," At that time, the essential elements of tortious interference with existing contract under Texas law were the same as they are 
now: intentional act, contract existence, proximate cause, and damages. In re Burzynski, 989 F.2d at 738. Although In re 
Burzynski dealt with a tortious interference with existing contract claim, the Court believes the proximate-cause analysis is 
equally applicable to a tortious interference with prospective relationship claim. "
1287,14," The full text of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(g) reads: Any person who suffers damage or loss by reason of a violation of this section may maintain a civil action against the 
violator to obtain compensatory damages and injunctive relief [*40]  or other equitable relief. A civil action for a violation of 
this section may be brought only if the conduct involves 1 of the factors set forth in subclauses4 (I), (II), (III), (IV), or (V) of 
subsection (c)(4)(A)(i). Damages for a violation involving only conduct described in subsection (c)(4)(A)(i)(I) are limited to 
economic damages. No action may be brought under this subsection unless such action is begun within 2 years of the date 
of the act complained of or the date of the discovery of the damage. No action may be brought under this subsection for the 
negligent design or manufacture of computer hardware, computer software, or firmware."

title 15, or contained in a file of a consumer reporting agency on a consumer, as such terms are defined in the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.); (B) information from any department or agency of the United States; or (C)

authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the 
object of the fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer and the value of such use is not more 
than $5,000 in any 1-year period [*42]  . . . shall be punished as provided in subsection (c) of this section."

843 (allegation that plaintiff's access was in violation of ""Confidentiality Agreement, Certification, and Defendants' Software 
Policy and Code of Ethics"" was sufficient to state unauthorized access or exceeding authorized access under CFAA); Meats by

LEXIS 7388, 2009 WL 255862, at *11 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 3, 2009) (finding that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on their CFAA 
claim because defendants ""had signed no confidentiality agreement with Bridal Expo or any other agreement restricting their 
access to the files they had been working with at their jobs at Bridal Expo"" and, therefore, did not act in excess of their 
authorization). "
1292,19," As Judge Kozinski noted in Nosal, a case on which Defendants heavily rely, the Fifth Circuit has not yet been faced with an 
opportunity to differentiate between the licensee and third-party in defining the parameters of exceeding or lacking authorization: We remain unpersuaded by the decisions of our sister circuits that interpret the CFAA broadly to cover violations of 
corporate computer use restrictions or violations of a duty of loyalty. See United States v. Rodriguez, 628 F.3d 1258 (11th 
Cir. 2010); United States v. John, 597 F.3d 263 (5th Cir. 2010); Int'l Airport Ctrs., LLC v. Citrin, 440 F.3d 418 (7th Cir. 
2006). These courts looked only at the culpable behavior of the defendants before them, and failed to consider the effect on 
millions of ordinary citizens caused by the statute's unitary [*58]  definition of ""exceeds authorized access."" They therefore 
failed to apply the long-standing principle that we must construe ambiguous criminal statutes narrowly so as to avoid 
""making criminal law in Congress's stead."" United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 514, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 
(2008). We therefore respectfully decline to follow our sister circuits and urge them to reconsider instead. Nosal, 676 F.3d at 862-63. "
1294,20," Since we are only dealing with Title II of the ECPA, i.e., the SCA, the Court uses the terms ECPA and SCA interchangeably."
1294,21," See, e.g., Garcia, 702 F.3d at 792-93 (noting that courts agree that a home computer is not protected by the SCA and finding 
that defendant's argument that her cell phone was a facility under the statute was unsupported by legislative history or other 
courts' decisions); Cousineau v. Microsoft Corp., 6 F. Supp. 3d 1167, 1174-75 (W.D. Wash. 2014) (discussing similar cases and "
1295,," concluding that mobile device is not ""facility"" under SCA); In re iPhone Application Litigation, 844 F. Supp. 2d 1040, 1057-58 
(N.D. Cal. 2012) (analyzing a number of cases and concluding that those that have concluded an individual's computer, laptop,

1296,22," Statoil also argues that Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim is preempted by the Copyright Act. (Doc. 28 at 22-23.) Because the 
Court agrees with Statoil's primary argument, the Court need not address this secondary [*73]  attack. "
1299,23," The Court agrees with BHL because Spear Marketing deals with the TTLA rather than the TUTSA, and as explained in [*80]  
supra note 3, the two statutes dictate a different result in the copyright preemption analysis. "
1305,1," The Court also heard argument in McCoy v. Nestle USA, Inc., No. 15-cv-4451, which involves different parties but substantially 
similar claims and arguments. A separate order has been published concurrently in that [**3]  case."
1305,2," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c)."
1305,3, Dana's allegations are taken as true in the context of a motion to dismiss.
1305,4," Certain Hershey products, sold under the brand names Bliss, Dagoba, and Scharffen Berger, are certified by the Rainforest 
Alliance (a nongovernmental organization) as using ethically produced cocoa and are not at issue in this [**5]  case. Compl. ¶ 
49. "
1306,5," Four other cases based on nondisclosure of supply chain labor violations, brought by plaintiffs who also share counsel with 
Dana, have been dismissed for failure to state a claim in the Central District of California. Wirth v. Mars Inc., No. SA CV 15-
1470-DOC (KESx), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14552, 2016 WL 471234 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 5, 2016); Barber v. Nestlé USA, Inc., 154 F. 
Supp. 3d 954, 2015 WL 9309553 (C.D. Cal. 2015); De Rosa v. Tri-Union Seafoods, LLC, No. CV 15-7540-CJC (AGRx), 2016 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5497, 2016 WL 524059 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 15, 2016) (summarily dismissing for the reasons stated in Barber); 
Hughes v. Big Heart Pet Brands, No. CV 15-8007-CJC (AGRx), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5508, 2016 WL 524057 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 
15, 2016) (same). Those cases, all of which concern seafood (or pet food that includes seafood products) rather than chocolate, 
were decided at least in part based on the safe harbor doctrine, which Hodsdon, McCoy, and this Order decline to reach. The 
four Central District cases are presently pending on appeal before the Ninth Circuit. "
1310,6," HN7[
] The CLRA allows a consumer who has suffered ""any damage"" to sue, and ""any plaintiff who has standing under the 
UCL's and FAL's 'lost money or property' requirement will, a fortiori, have suffered 'any damage' for purposes of establishing 
CLRA standing."" Hinojos, 718 F.3d at 1107-08."
1310,7," Hershey also cites a number of district court cases finding that plaintiff purchasers did not have standing merely because 
products were defective as to other purchasers. Mot. at 23 & n.21 (citing In re McNeil Consumer Healthcare, Mktg. & Sales 
Practices Litig., No. MDL 2190, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76800, 2011 WL 2802854 (E.D. Pa. July 15, 2011); Meaunrit v. The 
Pinnacle Foods Grp., LLC, No. C 09-04555 CW, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43858, 2010 WL 1838715 (N.D. Cal. May 5, 2010); 
Myers-Armstrong v. Actavis Totowa, LLC, No. C 08-04741 WHA, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38112, 2009 WL 1082026, (N.D. Cal. "

2009 WL 1515597 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 16, 2009)). To the extent those cases are consistent with the more recent Ninth Circuit 
decisions in Hinojos and Mazza, all of them—like Birdsong—involved at most an unrealized risk of future harm, and are not 
analogous to the case at hand where Dana alleges that failure to disclose ethical practices in the supply chain affected her 
willingness to purchase and pay for the products."
1311,8," Similarly, to use some of the examples given in those cases, it would be a bizarre result if sellers advertising food as halal or 
kosher, diamonds as conflict-free, or products as union-made could knowingly mix compliant and non-compliant products 
with [**24]  impunity so long as there was no way for a buyer to trace the specific item he or she purchased back to the source. 
The Eighth Circuit has nevertheless adopted that rule. See Wallace v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 747 F.3d 1025, 1030-31 (8th Cir. 
2014) (holding that customers lacked Article III standing to bring a claim based on allegedly false advertising of a product as 
using 100% kosher beef, where the plaintiffs could not show that the specific products they purchased contained non-kosher 
beef). This Court respectfully disagrees with that result. In this Court's view, if a customer has paid a premium for an assurance 
that a product meets certain standards, and the assurance turns out to be meaningless, the premium that the customer has paid 
is an actual, personal, particularized injury that is cognizable under Article III. See Hinojos, 718 F.3d at 1104. "

1312,11," Wilson also acknowledges cases recognizing a broader duty of disclosure in the sale of services, rather than products. Wilson, 
668 F.3d at 1143 (citing, e.g., In re Mediscan Research, Ltd., 940 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1991)). The chocolate products at issue in 
the present case are products, not services. "
1314,12," While Dana does not argue in the context of the ""unfair"" prong that either the CLRA or the FAL constitutes such a policy, her 
arguments that those statutes compel the disclosure she seeks could perhaps be transposed to this claim. For the reasons 
discussed above and below in the context of Dana's CLRA and FAL claims, the Court holds that neither statute represents a 
policy requiring the disclosure of labor abuses in a supply chain on product labels. "
1316,13," Moreover, even if the FAL allowed claims based on omissions, Dana has not established any duty to disclose the information 
at issue, as discussed above in the context of her CLRA claim. "
1317,14, Appeals of all of these cases are currently pending before the Ninth Circuit. 
1322,1," The Court also heard argument in Dana v. The Hershey Company, No. 15-cv-4453, which involves different parties but 
substantially similar claims and arguments. A separate order has been published concurrently in that case. "
1323,2," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §

factual allegations. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009); Bell Atl. Corp. v. 
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007). Where necessary to the Court's decision, any 
allegations not accepted as true will be specifically discussed below; where not necessary to the decision, however, the Court 
will not separate legal conclusions from factual allegations. "
1339,2," The reference is to the DCIs specified in Section 4 of the Moratorium: landfills, junkyards, and sand and gravel extraction 
activity requiring blasting. "
1344,3, The Court cites this and other unpublished opinions for their persuasive value. See 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A). 
1351,1, Plaintiffs did not object to this aspect of the Recommendation. (See Doc. # 256 at 1 n.1.)
1351,2," Judge Tafoya also ordered that certain motions to strike relating to the motions to dismiss — specifically, Defendant Cultural 
Care, Inc.'s Motion to Strike Material in Plaintiffs' Consolidated Opposition to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss (Doc. # 206) and 
Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion to Strike Certain Exhibits Submitted by the Defendants"" (Doc. # 221) — were denied as moot. The 
parties did not object to this ruling. (See Doc. ## 247, 248, 256.) "
1352,3," Under the DOS' au pair program, young, foreign nationals (between the age of 18 and 26), with some secondary school 
education and English proficiency, are permitted to obtain a so-called ""J-1"" visa and stay in United States for one or two years. 
Au pairs live with an American host family, for whom they provide live-in child care services for 45 hours per week (as well as, in 
some cases, housekeeping and cooking). In exchange for these services, they are provided with, among other things, (1) a 
weekly stipend (which the Plaintiffs allege violates the FLSA's minimum wage and overtime regulations); and (2) up to $500 in 
an ""education credit"" to cover tuition [**7]  (per year). (Doc. # 101, ¶¶ 44, 99, 108.)"
1352,4," The J-1 visa au pair program is one of several official J-1 visa ""cultural exchange"" programs overseen and administered by the 
DOS. (Doc. # 101, ¶ 43.)"
1352,5," Sponsors generate revenue at least in part from ""placement"" or ""program"" fees paid by host families in order to participate in 
the au pair program. For example, Au Pair in America's website indicates that it charges a host family an annual $8,245 
""Program Fee"" plus a $400 ""Match Fee."" (Doc. # 101, ¶ 99.) "
1353,6," Plaintiffs' assertion that Monsanto simply does not apply to this stage of the dispute is easily verifiable with a simple Westlaw or 
LexisNexis search. Thus, the Court is puzzled as to why this argument appeared yet again in Defendants' Objection to the 
Magistrate Judge's Recommendation."
1353,7," In White v. R.M. Packer Co., the First Circuit Court of Appeals provided the following helpful explanation of the difference 
between a tacit agreement, which is prohibited under the Sherman Act, and parallel conduct (otherwise known as ""conscious 
parallelism""), which is not: Conscious parallelism is a phenomenon of oligopolistic markets in which firms ""might in effect share monopoly power, 
setting their prices at a profit-maximizing, supracompetitive level by recognizing their shared economic interests and their 
interdependence with respect to price and output decisions."" Each producer may independently decide that it can maximize 
its profits by matching one or more other producers' price, on the hope that the market will be able to maintain high prices if 
the producers do not undercut one another. A tacit agreement—one in which only the conspirators' actions, and not any express communications, indicate the 
existence of an agreement—is distinguished from mere conscious parallelism by ""uniform behavior among 
competitors, [**13]  preceded by conversations implying that later uniformity might prove desirable or accompanied by other 
conduct that in context suggests that each competitor failed to make an independent decision."""
1353,635," F.3d 571, 575-76 (1st Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). "
1355,8," Defendants also assert that the Directors' statements are analogous to the statements made by the former CEO of Qwest in 
Twombly, to the effect that encroaching on another defendant's territory ""[m]ight be a good way to turn a quick dollar but that 
doesn't make it right."" 550 U.S. at 568 n. 13. However, Twombly's pleading standard offers little guidance as to the necessary 
level of specificity in the pleading of an explicit agreement, and in any case, this citation is in no way supportive of Defendants' 
argument. Although Defendants assert that the Supreme Court held in Twombly that ""a comment by the chief executive of one of 
the seven defendant entities [was] insufficient to adequately plead a plausible conspiracy"" (Doc. # 238 at 11), in fact, the 
Supreme Court noted that the district court (correctly) did not consider the CEO's statements because ""[t]his was only part of 
what he reportedly said,"" and after it took ""notice of the full contents of the published articles referenced in the complaint, from 
which the truncated quotations were drawn,"" the full context effectively neutralized the statements. See 550 U.S. at 568 n. 13. "
1356,9," This is because a plaintiff must withstand a relatively higher burden to survive a defendant's summary judgment motion than a 
motion to dismiss, especially in the antitrust context, which limits the range of permissible inferences [**23]  from ambiguous 
evidence. Specifically, ""a plaintiff seeking damages for a violation of [Section] 1 must present evidence 'that tends to exclude the 
possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently. . . . [I]n other words, [a plaintiff] must show that the inference of 
conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action or collusive action that could not have 
harmed [plaintiff]."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 
(1986); accord Abraham v. Intermountain Health Care Inc., 461 F.3d 1249, 1262 (10th Cir. 2006)."
1356,10," In Champagne Metals, the Tenth Circuit specifically reserved what it called the ""more difficult question"" of whether, on 
summary judgment, ""when direct evidence has been introduced, we must still evaluate the economic rationality of the alleged 
conspiracy when considering the accompanying circumstantial evidence."" 458 F.3d at 1085. "
1357,11," In stating this conclusion, the Court emphasizes that it is not finding that Plaintiffs have, in fact, presented sufficient evidence 
to withstand summary [**27]  judgment (nor could it do so at this juncture); for example, for whatever reason, Plaintiffs may 
ultimately fail to uncover evidence in discovery to shore up their allegations of a direct agreement, in which case the summary 
judgment calculus could shift significantly."
1357,12," Specifically, Judge Tafoya found that ""[t]he Amended Complaint alleges a mixture of 'parallel behaviors, details of industry 
structure, and industry practices, that facilitate collusion.'"" (Doc. # 240 at 13) (quoting In re Text Messaging Litig., 630 F.3d 622, 
627 (7th Cir. 2010))."
1357,13," With regard to this allegation, Defendants assert that Magistrate Judge Tafoya's Recommendation ""disregard[ed] the 
admission that over a third of the Defendant sponsors advertised stipends above $195.75"" for so-called non-standard au pairs 
(i.e., au pairs with additional training and education in child care), asserting that this amounts to the Court ""ignor[ing] 
inconvenient evidence."" (Doc. # 247 at 3-4.) To the contrary, Magistrate Judge Tafoya's Recommendation addressed this 
evidence, and she specifically explained that she considered this argument to be ""disingenuous"" because Plaintiffs, and those 
they seek to represent in a class action, are ""standard"" au pairs, and ""[t]he only instance in which Defendants advertise a higher 
compensation [**28]  rate is for non-standard positions. . . . [T]herefore, the only issues relevant to the current inquiry[] pertain to 
Defendants' practices with regard to standard au pairs."" (Doc. # 220 at 14.) "
1358,14," Item number nine in Judge Tafoya's list was Plaintiffs' allegation that three of the Sponsors expressly admitted that they had 
agreed to keep au pair wages at $195.75 per week. (Doc. # 240 at 12.)"
1358,15," This test ""includes inquiries into whether the alleged employer has the power to hire and fire employees, supervises and 
controls employee work schedules or conditions of employment, determines the rate and method of payment, and maintains 
employment records."" Baker v. Flint Eng'g & Constr. Co., 137 F.3d 1436, 1439 (10th Cir. 1998) (citing Watson v. Graves, 909 
F.2d 1549, 1553 (5th Cir.1990)). In applying the economic realities test, courts consider the following factors: ""(1) the degree of 
control exerted by the alleged employer over the worker; (2) the worker's opportunity for profit or loss; (3) the worker's 
investment in the business; (4) the permanence of the working relationship; (5) the degree of skill required to perform the work; 
and (6) the extent to which the work is an integral part of the alleged employer's business."" Baker, 137 F.3d at 1440. "
1359,16," Indeed, Defendant Go Au Pair's contract with its au pairs sets out an au pair's daily employment responsibilities, including 
""daily maintenance of the children, including meal preparation, doing the children's laundry, transporting the children to various 
activities, [**32]  assisting with homework, playing, teaching and caring for the children. [] Minor housekeeping, including but not 
limited to, washing the children's dishes, tidying up the children's rooms and making their beds, vacuuming and dusting the 
children's rooms and cleaning their bathrooms. [] pick up after the children in any room in which they have played."" (Doc. # 101 
at 66-67.)"
1359,17," Defendant Cultural Care's employment contract provides that the au pair must agree that Cultural Care (not the host family) 
will terminate the au pair if it determines that her emotional or physical state makes her unsuitable for providing childcare, if she 
gets married or pregnant, engages in behavior Cultural Care determines to be unsuitable, or Cultural Care deems her 
performance unsatisfactory ""for whatever reason."" (Doc. # 101 at 63.)"
1359,18," As Magistrate Judge Tafoya noted, ""Defendants do not request dismissal of Plaintiffs' FLSA claims based upon Defendants' 
failure to pay them [**34]  for the one-week mandatory training, nor Plaintiffs' claims that room and board is unlawfully deducted 
from their weekly stipends during vacations."" (Doc. # 240 at 16, n. 7.) "
1361,19," Defendants' arguments that the terms of the so-called ""DOS formula"" are ""irreconcilable"" with the FLSA are also unavailing. 
(Doc. # 187 at 3.) Specifically, the Sponsors note that the FLSA has no cap on weekly hours, but that au pairs are only permitted 
to work 45 hours a week; this presents no conflict whatsoever, and simply indicates that the au pair regulations are more 
restrictive in terms of work hours than the FLSA - not that the FLSA does not apply. They also cite a 1997 Opinion Letter 
issued by the DOL, in which it stated that it did not have the authority to lower the amount of the stipend if an au pair works 
fewer than 45 hours. Again, this says nothing about whether the au pair stipend must conform with the FLSA generally, because 
paying an au pair for 45 hours of week when that au pair actually worked fewer hours would result in a higher wage."
1361,20," 29 C.F.R. § 531.30 provides that ""The reasonable cost of board, lodging, or other facilities may be considered as part of the 
wage paid an employee only where customarily 'furnished' to the employee. Not only must the employee receive the benefits 
of the facility for which he is charged, but it is essential that his [or her] acceptance of the facility be voluntary and 
uncoerced."" (Emphasis added). "
1362,21," Home Care Ass'n of Am. v. Weil, 799 F.3d 1084 (D.C. Cir. 2015)."
1362,22," To the extent that the Sponsors are presenting ""new"" arguments before the Court in their Objection, ""issues raised for the first 
time in objections to the magistrate judge's recommendation are deemed [**45]  waived."" Marshall v. Chater, 75 F.3d 1421, 
1426 (10th Cir. 1996). "
1364,23," The Sponsors did not object to Judge Tafoya's recommendations regarding the applicability of the state wage laws of 
Pennsylvania or California. (See Doc. # 47.)"
1364,24," The Sponsors note that Judge Tafoya improperly referenced Plaintiffs' assertion, made in their Response to Defendants' 
Motion to Dismiss, that Defendant InterExchange's website informed au pairs that they can make ""almost [**51]  $10,000 per 
year,"" in considering whether Plaintiffs pled their fraud allegations with sufficient particularity, as this allegation did not appear in 
Plaintiff's Complaint. (Doc. # 247 at 14 n. 5.) The Court reviewed the Complaint and determined that this allegation was not, in 
fact, included (see Doc. # 101); as such, the Court did not consider that particular assertion here."
1364,25," Of course, Plaintiffs also allege that the Sponsors should have ensured the host families did, in fact, pay more than $195.75 
per week, because they allege that the au pairs were entitled to additional wages under the FLSA and/or state wage law. "
1369,1," The complaint does not specify whether those gains occurred within the Shreveport area or whether Willis-Knighton enjoyed 
those gains in all markets it serves. Willis-Knighton also operates a hospital in Arkansas. Record Document, p. 9."
1369,2," Filings subsequent to the complaint, however, have shed additional light on some of these acquisitions. One of the exhibits filed 
in conjunction with the Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction indicates that Willis-Knighton ""purchased"" Bossier Medical 
Center for $3.7 million in 2012. Record Document 24-30. In its briefing supporting its motion to dismiss Vantage, Willis-Knighton 
alleges that ""Doctor's Hospital was forced into bankruptcy by in [sic] creditors in 2007, and eventually closed its doors in 
February 2010 . . . ."" Record Document 97, p. 7-8 n. 1 (citation omitted) (citing In re Shreveport Doctors Hospital 2003 Ltd., Case 
No. 07-BK-10415 (W.D. La.)). "
1370,3," Vantage argues that a more customary rate would be 50% of charges that are set by Medicare's Diagnostic Related Group 
system, not by the hospital. Record Document 1, p. 16. Plaintiffs also assert that ""Willis-Knighton's reimbursement rates are from 
50% to several hundred percent higher than those at UH-Shreveport."" Id. at 14."
1370,4," The complaint also initially alleged that Willis-Knighton was planning an outright takeover of University Hospital. [**12]  Record 
Document 1, p. 23-30. But Plaintiffs later abandoned this theory. Record Document 83, p. 2. "
1372,5," Vantage has alleged attempted monopolization, another cause of action under section 2 of the Sherman Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 
2 (2012); Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 456, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993); Record Document 1, 
pp. 73-75. Vantage's attempted monopolization claim is indistinguishable from Vantage's monopolization claim for the purposes 
of evaluating Willis-Knighton's dismissal arguments. Because anticompetitive conduct is still an element of an attempted 
monopolization claim, Spectrum Sports, 506 U.S. at 456, the viability of both Vantage's monopolization and attempted 
monopolization claims turns in equal measure on whether Vantage can show anticompetive conduct. Moreover, Willis-Knighton's 
remaining two dismissal arguments—lack of antitrust injury and lack of Twombly specificity—also equally affect Vantage's 
monopolization [**20]  and attempted monopolization claims. The Court therefore need not separately address Vantage's 
attempted monopolization claim for a large part of this ruling."
1372,6," Courts also label anticompetitive conduct exclusionary conduct, predatory conduct, and improper conduct. See Taylor Pub. Co. 
v. Jostens, Inc., 216 F.3d 465, 475 n.2 (5th Cir. 2000) (""We use the terms 'predatory' and 'exclusionary' interchangeably . . . .""); 
Berkey Photo, Inc. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 298 (2d Cir. 1979) (""improper"" conduct). Some authorities, however, 
view the term ""exclusionary"" as too narrow. See 3 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 701b (3d ed. 2008) 
(""Although we often say that § 2 requires an 'exclusionary' act, our real meaning is that § 2 requires one or more forbidden 
anticompetitive acts. Not all anticompetitive acts are exclusionary.""). "
1373,7," See Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 605 n.32, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985) 
(""[E]xclusionary comprehends at the most behavior that not only (1) tends to impair the opportunities of rivals, but also (2) either 
does not further competition on the merits or does so in an unnecessarily restrictive way."") (quoting 3 Phillip E. Areeda & Donald 
F. Turner, Antitrust Law 78 (1978)); United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 
(1966) (The monopolist must have ""acquired or maintained that power wilfully, as distinguished from the power having arisen 
and continued by growth produced by the development of a superior product, business [**21]  acumen, or historic accident.""); 3 
Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 651a (3d ed. 2008) (""We define monopolistic conduct as acts that: (1) are reasonably 
capable of creating, enlarging or prolonging monopoly power by impairing the opportunities of rivals; and (2) that either (2a) do 
no benefit consumers at all, or (2b) are unnecessary for the particular consumer benefits claimed for them, or (2c) produce 
harms disproportionate to any resulting benefits."")"
1373,8," See also United States v. Aluminum Co., 148 F.2d 416, 430 (2d. Cir. 1945) (Hand, J.) (""The successful competitor, having 
been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins."")."
1373,9," Notably, Vantage does not contend that Willis-Knighton's ""effective refusal to deal"" with it constituted anticompetitive conduct. A 
refusal to deal may qualify as anticompetitive [**22]  conduct, but only under limited circumstances. See Aspen Skiing, 472 U.S. 
585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467; Trinko, 540 U.S. 398, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823. Instead, Vantage alleges that 
Willis-Knighton's refusal to deal with it represents its injury. Record Document 89, p. 25."
1373,10," The separate analysis of these three groups of conduct is not impermissible ""compartmentalizing"" of allegedly anticompetitive 
conduct. See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 698, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962). 
As Vantage has alleged elsewhere Continental Ore and Associated Radio Services Co. v. Page Airways, Inc. hold that courts 
should determine anticompetitive conduct by measuring the cumulative effect of the defendant's allegedly anticompetitve 
conduct, rather than evaluating each instance of allegedly illegal conduct in isolation. See Continental Ore, 370 U.S. at 698; 
Assoc. Radio Serv. Co. v. Page Airways, Inc, 624 F.2d 1342, 1356 (5th Cir. 1980). This instruction, however, is limited to the 
analysis of conduct that although in theory may constitute anticompetitive conduct, in fact has such a de minimis effect on 
competition that it should not be actionable. See Assoc. Radio, 624 F.2d at 1353-56 (""We agree . . . that a de minimis rule 
should be applied by our courts, but we believe that [there were] enough instances of exclusionary behavior on the part of 
defendants to constitute far more than de minimis violations of section 2.""). The Court may therefore separately address whether 
Willis-Knighton's acquisitions, non-competes, [**23]  or referrals theoretically could give rise to anticompetitive conduct before 
cumulatively determining the effect of these actions. "
1374,11," See also id. at 523 (""Generally, a finding of exclusionary conduct requires some sign that the monopolist engaged in behavior 
that—examined without reference to its effects on competitors—is economically irrational."")."
1374,12," Although the court stated that this determination would be upset if there were evidence that airports' decision making [**26]  
had been coopted or coerced, id. at 526 (""Bribery and threats are not competition on the merits.""), the court found that Stearns 
had failed to introduce any such evidence. Id. "
1375,13," Vantage also asserts that Electronic Data Systems v. Computer Associates, 802 F. Supp. 1463 (N.D. Tex. 1992), and Brown 
Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 82 S. Ct. 1502, 8 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1962), support its contention that acquisitions alone 
constitute anticompetive conduct under section 2. Record Document 89, p. 20. No such holding is found in either case. In 
Electronic Data Systems, the defendant moved to dismiss the plaintiff's section 2 claim not because it did not allege 
anticompetive conduct, but because it did not allege monopoly power. See id. at 1466-67. The question of whether the 
defendant's acquisitions gave rise to anticompetitive conduct was therefore not before the court. In Brown Shoe, the Court, in 
evaluating whether a horizontal and vertical merger violated section 7 of the Clayton Act, stated, ""If the share of the market 
foreclosed is so large that it approaches monopoly proportions, the Clayton Act will, of course, have been violated; but the 
arrangement will also have run afoul of the Sherman Act."" 370 U.S. at 328. This statement does not support Vantage's position 
because it was not the holding of the Court and, even if it were, its import is substantially diminished by the fact that it was made 
before Grinnell, which was the first Supreme Court case requiring anticompetitive [**29]  conduct as an element of a section 2 
violation. "
1376,14," The Court notes that while a filing subsequent to the complaint indicates [**32]  that Willis-Knighton ""purchased"" Bossier 
Medical Center for $3.7 million in 2012, Record Document 24-30, that filing was not an exhibit attached to the complaint and 
therefore the Court may not consider it in a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss."
1376,15," Courts no longer consider intrabrand restrictions on competition enforced by the parent company [**34]  to be anticompetitive. 
See Copperweld Corp. v. Indep. Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 752-53, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984). "
1378,16," The other cases on which Willis-Knighton relies to support its affirmative defense argument, Port Dock, 507 F.3d at 124-25, 
and Morris Commc'ns Corp. v. PGA Tour, Inc., 364 F.3d 1288 (11th Cir. 2004), are misplaced. See Record Document 97, pp. 3-
4. In Port Dock, the Second Circuit held that a section 2 monopolization claim alleging a vertical acquisition accompanied by a 
refusal to deal should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) because it failed to allege anticompetitive conduct. 507 F.3d at 124-26. 
The court noted that a vertical acquisition standing alone does not qualify as anticompetitive [**40]  conduct, id. at 124 (citing 
Belfiore v. N.Y. Times Co., 826 F.2d 177, 181 (2d Cir. 1987)), and that a refusal to deal generally does not qualify as 
anticompetitive conduct unless there is an absence of a valid business purposes, id. (citing Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen 
Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 608, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985)). The court further noted that in the Second 
Circuit, ""when a monopolist has acquired its monopoly at one level of a product market, its vertical expansion into another level 
of the same product market will ordinarily be for . . . a prototypical valid business purpose."" Id. (citing G.K.A. Beverage Corp. v. 
Honickman, 55 F.3d 762 (2d Cir. 1995). Vantage's monopolization claims and the monopolization claim dismissed in Port Dock 
are easily distinguishable. Unlike the relevant challenged acquisition in Port Dock, the acquisitions that Vanta challenges were 
horizontal, not vertical. See id. at 119; Record Document 5-6, 10, 17. Thus, the relevant holdings from Port Dock, that vertical 
acquisitions are not anticompetitive under section 2 and are usually done for a rational business purpose, have no bearing on 
Willis-Knighton's acquisitions. In Morris Communications, a publisher sued the Professional Golf Association for monopolizing the publication of real-time golf 
scores. Id. at 1290-93. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed summary judgment dismissal of the publisher's claim, holding that the 
defendant had demonstrated, [**41]  as a defense, that its conduct had a nonpretextual, valid business justification. Id. at 1297-
98. Because the court in Morris Commc'ns affirmed dismissal of the publisher's monopolization claim on summary judgment, 
rather than under Rule 12(b)(6), Morris Commc'ns does not support Willis-Knighton's argument that it is entitled to prevail on its 
affirmative defense of a nonpretextual, procompetitive justification for its allegedly illegal acquisitions. See id. at 1292. "
1379,17," While not dispositive of market power, market share often serves as an imperfect proxy for market power. See Domed 
Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 489-90 (5th Cir. 1984) (citing United States v. Aluminum Co. of Am., 148 
F.2d 416, 424 (2d Cir. 1945) (Hand, J.)). "
1380,18," Jebaco also alleged it was injured because the defendants deprived it of an opportunity to compete for the casino bid. Id. The 
court dismissed this claim as failing to allege antitrust injury, albeit for reasons not relevant to Vantage's claims. See id. at 321."
1380,19," The court also reasoned that there was no antitrust injury because the termination of the lease was the product of 
""downstream"" allegedly anticompetitive conduct. Id. at 320. The court found that courts generally do not recognize antitrust injury 
for the termination of a contract or lease that is caused by ""downstream"" anticompetitive conduct, i.e., conduct by entities that 
are closer to the consumer in the stream of commerce than the plaintiff. See id. (citing 2 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust 
Law, 350(f-g), at 422-23 (2d ed. 2000) (""When a downstream firm merely substitutes one supplier for another, there is certainly 
injury-in-fact to the terminated supplier, but there is rarely antitrust injury."")). Applying this rule to Jebaco's claims, the court 
reasoned that Jebaco had not suffered antitrust injury because it alleged that its lease (assignment) [**50]  was terminated as a 
result of anticompetitive acts by casinos operators, which are farther ""downstream"" in the market for gambling than Jebaco as 
lessor. Id. "
1382,20," The court also found ""tentative evidence"" that these adverse effects would actually occur. Id. at 1357. "
1385,21," The elements of Vantage's monopolization claim based [**69]  on Willis-Knighton's past conduct are (1) Willis-Knighton 
possessed market power in the relevant market and (2) Willis-Knighton engaged in anticompetitive conduct. See Stearns, 170 
F.3d at 522. The elements of Vantage's attempted monopolization claim based on Willis-Knighton's past conduct are (1) Willis-
Knighton engaged in anticompetitive conduct, (2) with a specific intent to monopolize, while (3) there was a dangerous 
probability of Willis-Knighton achieving monopoly power in a relevant market. See Spectrum Sports v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 
456, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1993). With respect to the anticompetitive conduct element, where the defendant is 
alleged to have engaged in a pattern of illegal conduct, courts assess whether a section 2 claim demonstrates anticompetitive 
conduct by measuring the cumulative effect of the defendant's allegedly illegal conduct, rather than evaluating each instance of 
allegedly illegal conduct in isolation. See Assoc. Radio, 624 F.2d at 1356 (""[N]o one of the instances of improper conduct, 
standing alone, would lead to section 2 liability. Taken together, however, they show a pattern of exclusionary behavior sufficient 
to support the jury's verdict.""). "
1388,1," During oral argument, the Court invited both sides to submit letters regarding certain studies cited by plaintiff in the Amended 
Complaint. See Transcript of Proceedings dated March 9, 2016 (""Tr.""), 24:12-16. These letters, respectively dated March 11, 
2016 (""PI. Letter"") and March 15, 2016 (""Def. Letter""), will be docketed along with this Opinion."
1388,2," The Court uses ""drivers"" and sometimes ""Uber drivers"" instead of Uber's term ""driver-partners"" for the sake of simplicity, but 
this usage is not meant to imply any employment relationship between Uber and these drivers, which defendant firmly denies. "
1390,3," Defendant Kalanick contends that Uber's Driver Terms ""do provide that driver-partners [**11]  have the discretion to charge 
less than the suggested price determined by Uber's pricing algorithm."" Reply Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant 
Travis Kalanick's Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. 34 (""Def. Reply Br."") at 2 n.1, citing Declaration of Michael Colman, Dkt. 29, Exhibit 2 
(""Driver Terms"") ¶ 4.1 (""Customer shall always have the right to: (i) charge a fare that is less than the pre-arranged fare . . .""). 
""Customer"" here refers to ""an independent company in the business of providing transportation services,"" that is, Uber's driver-
partners. See Driver Terms; Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant Travis Kalanick's Motion to Dismiss (""Pl. Opp. Br."") 
at 4. Plaintiff points out, however, that the Driver Terms also require drivers to agree that ""the Fare provided under the Fare 
Calculation is the only payment Customer will receive in connection with the provision of Transportation Services,"" Driver Terms 
¶ 4.1, and that more importantly, ""there is no mechanism by which drivers can charge anything but the Appdictated fare."" 
Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant Travis Kalanick's Motion to Dismiss (""Pl. Opp. Br.""), Dkt. 33, at 4. For the 
purposes of evaluating defendant's [**12]  motion to dismiss, the Court will assume that drivers have no practical mechanism by 
which to depart from the fares set by Uber's algorithm. Defendant acknowledges that any discretion drivers may have to charge 
a lower fare ""is not material to this motion,"" Def. Reply Br. at 2 n.l, and oral argument proceeded on the assumption that Uber 
sets mandatory prices for drivers to charge. See Transcript of Oral Argument dated March 9, 2016 at 4:12-16. "
1392,4," Though defendant's counsel argued at oral argument that if these events were ""an antitrust violation, Mr. Kalanick would be a 
victim and not a participant in the conspiracy,"" since he allegedly initially opposed the higher rates, Tr. 37:8-9, the fact remains 
that, if plaintiff's allegations are taken as true, Mr. Kalanick agreed to a fare raise that set higher fares for all Uber drivers in the 
relevant groups. "
1393,5," Leegin's statement that ""[t]o the extent a vertical agreement setting minimum resale prices is entered upon to facilitate either 
type of cartel, it, too, would need to be held unlawful under the rule of reason,"" 551 U.S. at 893, thus does not clearly apply to 
the instant case, since Uber is setting no minimum resale prices. Moreover, Leegin did not purport to overrule Interstate Circuit, 
which, for the reasons described supra, permits a finding of a conspiracy among competitors in circumstances such as those of 
the instant case. See Interstate Circuit, 306 U.S. at 226-27."
1393,6," Indeed, defendant himself referred in the briefing to ""a vertical price arrangement like that described in the Amended 
Complaint."" Def. Br. at 17. [**23]  But see Def. Reply Br. at 8 (""The Amended Complaint . . . does not allege a vertical restraint in 
violation of the antitrust laws.""). "
1394,7," In plaintiff's letter submitted after oral argument, plaintiff further described the ""independent studies"" quoted anonymously in 
Amended Complaint ¶ 110 that supposedly support these assertions. See Pl. Letter."
1394,8," Defendant argues that plaintiff is equitably estopped from avoiding the class action waiver in the user agreement that plaintiff 
made with Uber. See Def. Br. at 21; Colman Declaration, Dkt. 29, Exhibit 1 (User Agreement), at 8-9. The relevant provision of 
the User Agreement reads: Dispute Resolution: You and Company agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this 
Agreement . . . will be settled by binding arbitration . . . You acknowledge and agree that you and Company are each 
waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class User in any purported [**28]  class action or 
representative proceeding. "
1395,," User Agreement at 8-9. Although plaintiff has sued Mr. Kalanick personally and not Uber, defendant claims that plaintiff's claims 
against Mr. Kalanick are ""intimately founded in and intertwined with"" the underlying agreement with Uber. See Def. Br. at 23, 
quoting Kramer v. Toyota Motor Corp., 705 F.3d 1122, 1128 (9th Cir. 2013). The Court finds, however, that since defendant is 
not seeking to compel arbitration, and plaintiff is not seeking to enforce the User Agreement against defendant, plaintiff is not 
equitably estopped from pursuing a class action suit against Mr. Kalanick, nor has plaintiff waived the right to proceed through 
this mechanism. "
1398,1," While Defendants entitle their motion ""Motion to Dismiss... Pursuant to Rules 9(a) and 12(b)(6),"" Defendants' arguments 
implicate Rule 9(b), not 9(a). Further, Plaintiffs' Complaint does not include a claim for fraud or fraudulent concealment. Plaintiffs 
raise the issue of fraudulent concealment as a negation to the statute of limitations defense and in regards to the discovery rule. 
Therefore, Rule 9 is inapplicable. Accordingly, [**6]  the Court declines to consider Defendants' arguments arising under Rule 
9(b). "
1400,2," Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1(d) [**14] , the Court declines to consider Defendants' standing argument— unsupported by citations 
to relevant legal authority. "
1404,1, This description is a paraphrase of the parties' Stipulated Fact No. 20 (Doc. 251-1 at 5). 
1405,2, The parties recite these facts in Stipulated Fact No. 27 (Doc. 251-1 at 6).
1405,3," [*12] O&M and Cardinal do not dispute Suture Express' Statement of Fact No. 34: ""For purposes of this case, the relevant 
markets are appropriately limited to distribution of Med-Surg products to acute care customers (i.e., hospitals)."" Doc. 269 at 21 "
1406,," (Suture Express' Memo. in Support of Partial Summary Judgment); Doc. 304 at 2 (stating that Suture Express' Statement of Fact 
No. 34 is not disputed for purposes of summary judgment). O&M and Cardinal assert in their summary judgment motion that the relevant market is for distribution services, rather than the 
physical items themselves. Doc. 266 at 6; Doc. 303 at 6 (sealed corrected version). Suture Express disputes this statement of 
fact, arguing that the relevant market is for the distribution of physical items because meg-surg distributors provide the actual 
products in addition to distribution-related services. Doc. 280 at 7. The Court views this statement of fact in the light most 
favorable to Suture Express, as it must when it considers defendants' motion for summary judgment. The Court therefore 
concludes that the relevant market is the distribution of med-surg products. Moreover, O&M and Cardinal fail to dispute that 
characterization of [*13]  the relevant market in their response to Suture Express' motion for partial summary judgment. "
1407,4," O&M did not produce cost data sufficient for Professor Elhauge to perform a similar calculation for its markups. So, Professor 
Elhauge relied on Cardinal's cost data to perform the analysis for O&M. "
1408,5," See Doc. 262-1 at 148 (Elhauge report at ¶ 154) (explaining that Professor Elhauge used this formula because it is ""a 
prominent economic test"" used to determine if a bundled discount has the same economic effect as tying (citing X Areeda, 
Elhauge, & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1758b (1996))."
1408,6, The sealed version of this Memorandum and Order (Doc. 310) identifies this customer specifically. 
1409,7," The sealed version of this Memorandum and Order (Doc. 310) identifies this membership association specifically and the 
specific hospitals who are members of this association as described the following paragraphs."
1409,8," The sealed version of this Memorandum and Order (Doc. 310) specifically identifies this hospital and the six additional 
hospitals described in the following six paragraphs. "
1410,9, Suture Express also offers similar services. 
1411,10, The sealed version of this Memorandum and Order (Doc. 310) identifies this hospital specifically. 
1413,11," The sealed version of this Memorandum and Order contains specific data for defendants' profit margins described in the 
above paragraph. Defendant O&M argued, persuasively, that revealing of this specific data could place it at a competitive 
disadvantage in the marketplace. The Court thus expresses this data in broader terms in the Amended Memorandum and Order. 
If that data should become relevant to issues in later proceedings, the sealed version of this Memorandum and Order recites this 
data specifically. "
1414,12, The sealed version of this Memorandum and Order (Doc. 310) identifies this hospital specifically. 
1419,13," Because O&M did not produce cost data sufficient for Professor Elhauge to perform a similar calculation for its markups, he 
used Cardinal's cost data to perform the analysis for O&M. "
1424,14, Suture Express does not allege that defendants' overall price is below its costs. 
1425,15," The sealed version of this Memorandum and Order contains specific data for defendants' profit margins described in the 
above paragraph. See supra n.11. "
1428,16," It is undisputed that vendor funding generally is paid as a percentage of the underlying product cost. Thus, the more 
expensive the product, the more vendor funding it generates. "
1429,17," 504 U.S. 451, 485, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). "
1432,18," And, for the same reasons explained above when discussing the Sherman Act claim, the Court denies Suture Express' 
summary judgment motion on its Clayton Act claim."
1432,19," The Kansas legislature enacted ""substantial changes"" to the KRTA after the Kansas Supreme Court's opinion in O'Brien. 
Smith v. Phillip Morris Cos., 50 Kan. App. 2d 535, 335 P.3d 644, 652 (Kan. Ct. App. 2014). The amendments to the KRTA went 
into effect on April 18, 2013, but generally do not apply retroactively to cases already pending at the amendments' effective date. 
Id. (citing K.S.A. § 50-164 (Supp. 2013)) (further citation omitted). Because this case was filed before the 2013 effective date of 
the KRTA amendments, the current version of the KRTA does not apply to this case."
1432,20," O'Brien, 277 P.3d at 1075 (citing Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 489, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 L. Ed. 2d 
701 (1977)). "
1433,21," Also, the summary judgment record contains no admissible evidence of reduced output. Rival national and regional 
competitors are growing the distribution market. Even Suture Express' expert calculates that industry-wide revenue figures for 
med-surg distribution had increased, not decreased, during the relevant period. See supra Part III.A.2. "
1437,1," The five towing companies that contracted with Authorized City Towing are Allied Gardens Towing, Inc.; C & D Towing 
Specialists, Inc.; Starrue, Inc.; Nancar, Inc.; and San Diego Police Towing Operators. ACT's opening brief omits Nancar, [*4]  
Inc., from its list of towing subcontractors."
1437,2, All subsequent statutory references are to the Civil Code unless otherwise specified.
1437,3," Subsequent references to AutoReturn include AutoReturn's executive officers, John Wicker and John Pendleton, who are 
identified as cross-defendants in DTS's second amended cross-complaint. Subsequent references to Orion include DeLatte. "
1438,4," AutoReturn and the City also filed a motion for sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7 against both ACT and 
DTS based on their having brought [*6]  a frivolous motion to disqualify AutoReturn and the City's counsel. The court granted the 
motion and awarded sanctions jointly against ACT and DTS and their respective counsel in the amount of $13,925. Neither ACT 
nor DTS appeal the award of sanctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 128.7. "
1440,5, ACT does not challenge the disposition of any of its causes [*15]  of action as to the City or DTS.
1440,6," A minute order denying DTS leave to file a third amended cross-complaint notes that a previous judge assigned to the case 
ruled, in sustaining a demurrer, that ""DTS's claims for common law misappropriation, interference with contract and contractual "
1441,," relations, and undue business practices were superseded by DTS's claim for Misappropriation of Trade Secrets (Civil Code 
section 3426 et seq.), as all of these claims were premised on a common nucleus of fact relating to alleged misuse of DTS's 
software."" "
1443,7," In its opposition to Orion's summary judgment motion, DTS explained that ""XML is a 'markup language' designed to present 
materials in a way that both machines and humans can read and understand. [Citation.] An XML schema is one type of 
document written in XML language."""
1443,8," The record does not contain a complete copy of the declaration that Abramson prepared in opposition to Orion's summary 
judgment motion. The copy in the record begins on page seven and portions of the declaration are redacted. In DTS's sealed 
appendix, the declaration that Abramson prepared in opposition to AutoReturn [*26]  and the City's motion for summary 
judgment appears twice, presumably through inadvertence. However, portions of Abramson's declaration in opposition to Orion's 
motion not otherwise in the record are quoted in Orion's written objections to DTS's evidence. "
1445,9," Although DTS identified its ""reasons code"" database as one its trade secrets, Abramson stated in his declaration that the 
reason code script and DTS's database were not identical. As noted, Abramson stated that ""the similarities overwhelm the 
differences—thereby suggesting that Defend[an]ts' inappropriate use of DTS's systems and software extended into the specific 
components claimed as trade secrets."" The trial court correctly sustained Orion's objection to Abramson's ""suggestion"" of trade 
secret misappropriation on the grounds it lacked foundation and was speculative. "
1447,10," In its second amended trade secret statement under Code of Civil Procedure section 2019.210, DTS [*43]  stated the 
following under the heading, ""Flow of control trade secrets:"" ""The static information in the [specified trade secret] databases is 
valuable in and of itself, but of greater value in any automated system is the way in which that information is used. The data in 
each of the databases . . . also controls both the functioning of the program and the flow of information. Each new data entry 
triggers different parts of each database and directs both the program and its users to do different things. The database can "
1448,," direct the program to ask the users for additional information, transmit information to a third party, or direct the users to take 
specific courses of action outside the confines of the program. Because each combination of instances can trigger a different set 
of directions, the number of different direction sets is enormous. DTS contends that each possible combination is a trade secret 
that has been misappropriated by Cross-Defendants and is at issue in this litigation. Each instruction set which translates a 
combination of inputs into a concrete course of action represents a use of the underlying data and is therefore a trade secret 
distinct from the trade secret claimed [*44]  in the static databases. [¶] . . . In the present case, DTS alleges the Cross-
Defendants misappropriated both the static data and the dynamic flow of control or instruction sets."" "
1450,11," Although the court awarded attorney fees and costs to AutoReturn and the City jointly, DTS's challenge on appeal to that 
award addresses only the propriety of the award as to AutoReturn. "
1452,12," Later during oral argument, DTS's counsel again equated objective bad faith with objective speciousness, stating: ""Your 
Honor, for purposes of ruling on this motion, the issue with regard to objective bad faith is whether there is any evidence that 
supports the filing of this [trade secret] [*58]  claim."""
1452,13," Bailey told Fitzgerald that DTS and ACT would be willing to dismiss Orion from the litigation if DeLatte provided a 
predeposition interview with Bailey and if Orion provided an informal production of its documents. Orion agreed to those terms, 
but was unwilling to produce documents and disclose information that would violate a confidentiality agreement between Orion 
and AutoReturn. However, Orion agreed to produce documents that would potentially violate the confidentiality agreement if 
DTS would subpoena them. Rather than subpoena the documents, DTS proposed that Orion assign to DTS claims it might have 
against AutoReturn so that Orion and DTS would be in privity and could therefore share AutoReturn's confidential information. 
DTS also suggested that Orion did not have to comply with its confidentiality agreement because AutoReturn had breached the 
agreement by not disclosing the present litigation to Orion. "
1453,14," Evidence Code section 1152, subdivision (a), provides: ""Evidence that a person has, in compromise or from humanitarian 
motives, furnished or offered or promised to furnish money or any other thing, act, or service to another who has sustained or 
will sustain or claims that he or she has sustained or will sustain loss or damage, as well as any conduct or statements made in 
negotiation thereof, is inadmissible to prove his or her liability for the loss or damage or any part of it."""
1453,15," Evidence Code section 1154 provides: ""Evidence that a person has accepted or offered or promised to accept a sum of 
money or any other thing, act, or service in satisfaction of a claim, as well as any conduct or statements made in negotiation 
thereof, [*64]  is inadmissible to prove the invalidity of the claim or any part of it."" "
1455,16," AutoReturn contends it was a prevailing party in its licensing agreements with DTS because, in AutoReturn's words, ""DTS's 
trade-secret [*70]  claim against AutoReturn was (and still is) premised largely on these 'two agreements that required 
AutoReturn to keep DTS's software confidential.'"" "
1456,17," AutoReturn did not ask the court to strike Estes's declaration on the ground it contradicted his deposition testimony; its request 
to strike the declaration was based solely on alleged discovery abuse regarding his deposition. "
1457,18," Under the D'Amico rule, ""'""[w]here . . . there is a clear and unequivocal admission by the plaintiff, himself, in his deposition""' 
and the plaintiff contradicts that admission in a subsequent [*79]  declaration, '""we are forced to conclude there is no substantial 
evidence of the existence of a triable issue of fact.""'"" (Ahn, supra, 223 Cal.App.4th at p. 144, quoting D'Amico, supra, 11 Cal.3d 
at p. 21, first italics added by Ahn.) "
1458,19," The parties' dispute regarding the alleged joint venture is focused entirely on whether there was a [*84]  joint venture 
agreement; there is no argument that to the extent there was such an agreement, AutoReturn did not breach it. "
1460,20," The causes of action for common law misappropriation, interference with contractual relations, and unfair competition in DTS's 
proposed third amended cross-complaint were against Orion and DeLatte only."
1460,21," Although DTS's motion for leave to file a third amended cross-complaint did not seek to add a cause of action against Orion, 
Orion opposed the motion by arguing that Judge Nevitt's dismissal of the contract interference cause of action against the City 
established that its [*89]  contract interference cause of action against Orion was futile. In reply papers and at oral argument, 
DTS pointed out that Orion had not challenged the eighth cause of action and it had not been dismissed. DTS argued that its 
contract interference claim against Orion was based on different facts than the dismissed contract interference claim against the 
City, and was not superseded by its cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets. The court at oral argument stated, ""I 
think Judge Nevitt did adjudicate this issue. I think he did dismiss these counts. And I think they are the same. And you are 
asking me to second-guess a colleague, and I'm just not going to do that. I don't have the authority to do that."" DTS's counsel 
responded, ""Okay. I will concede that today. That's fine, but we still have the issue of the breach of fiduciary duty claim [against 
AutoReturn]."""
1460,22," It its reply brief, DTS takes the position that the court's incorrect view that its contract interference claim against Orion had 
been dismissed operated as a dismissal of that claim. DTS argues that it ""could not defend against a motion seeking judgment 
on an interference claim that had been ruled dismissed already."" We do not view the court's erroneous statement that a prior 
judge had dismissed DTS's eighth cause of action against [*91]  Orion as constituting a dismissal of that cause of action. DTS 
could have opposed Orion's request for summary adjudication of the eighth cause of action on the merits and argued that the 
court misunderstood or misconstrued the effect of the prior dismissal of DTS's 10th cause of action on status of the eighth cause 
of action. "
1463,23," In In re Tobacco II Cases (2009) 46 Cal.4th 298, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 559, 207 P.3d 20, the California Supreme Court held that to 
comply with UCL's standing requirements after 2004 amendments to the UCL by Proposition 64, a class representative in a 
consumer class action alleging misrepresentation under the fraudulent prong of the UCL ""must demonstrate actual reliance on 
the allegedly deceptive or misleading statements, in accordance with well-settled principles regarding the element of reliance in 
ordinary fraud actions"" (In re Tobacco II Cases, at p. 306.) The Supreme Court further held, however, that the ""standing 
requirements are applicable only to the class representatives, and not all absent class members."" (Ibid.)"
1463,24," ACT voluntarily dismissed its 18th cause of action for misappropriation of trade secrets without prejudice the same day it filed 
its opposition to AutoReturn's motion for summary judgment. Despite the dismissal, the court granted AutoReturn's motion for 
summary adjudication as to the 18th cause of action. "
1464,25," AutoReturn contends that ACT waived the right to argue on appeal that its seventh cause of action falls under the fraudulent 
prong of the UCL because ACT did not make that argument in opposition to AutoReturn's motion for summary judgment We 
disagree. In its seventh cause of action, ACT alleged that AutoReturn engaged in fraudulent business practices, and specifically 
alleged that AutoReturn ""falsely represented to the City that AutoReturn was authorized to utilize LETS and TMS systems in 
AutoReturn's [*106]  prospective performance of the [towing contract] in the event said contract was awarded to AutoReturn."" 
The seventh cause of action further alleges that AutoReturn falsely represented to the City that ""ACT has no rights of exclusivity 
which would bar an award of the [contract] to AutoReturn."" In its opposition to AutoReturn's summary judgment motion, ACT 
argued that the City awarded the contract to AutoReturn ""based upon AutoReturn's false representation that it would use the 
LETS and TMS products to automate tow dispatching for the City. Having used LETS/TMS to bait the City, once AutoReturn 
was awarded the . . . contract, it then switched to other allegedly non-infringing computer software to avoid ACT's preliminary 
injunction of its infringement of ACT's exclusive license rights in LETS/TMS."" In arguing that it had standing to bring a UCL claim 
because it lost money as a result of AutoReturn's infringement of its exclusive license, ACT contended that AutoReturn's 
interference with ACT's rights in LETS/TMS arose when AutoReturn ""falsely represented"" to the City that AutoReturn was able 
and intended to use LETS/TMS in the performance of the contract. This argument in ACT's opposition [*107]  to AutoReturn's 
motion for summary judgment, along with the allegations in ACT's seventh cause of action, sufficiently preserve ACT's right to 
argue on appeal that its seventh cause of action is viable under the fraudulent prong of the UCL. "
1466,26," The court also cited Mary Morgan, Inc. v. Melzark (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 765, 57 Cal. Rptr. 2d 4, in which the Court of Appeal 
decided the plaintiff could not voluntarily dismiss the action without prejudice after the court announced an adverse tentative 
summary judgment ruling and the summary judgment hearing had commenced and been continued to permit the plaintiff to 
produce additional opposition evidence (id. at pp. 768-769), and Hartbrodt v. Burke (1996) 42 Cal. App. 4th 168, 49 Cal. Rptr. 2d 
562, in which the Court of Appeal held that a plaintiff could not avoid dismissal of an action as a discovery sanction by voluntarily 
dismissing [*114]  the action without prejudice because that ""tactic would simply defeat the trial court's power to enforce its 
discovery orders."" (Id. at pp. 175-176.) These cases are distinguishable. ACT voluntarily dismissed its 18th cause of action 
before the trial court issued a tentative ruling on AutoReturn motion for summary judgment and the dismissal did not implicate 
the court's power to enforce discovery orders through a terminating sanction. "
1468,27," The only reason it may not violate the letter of that provision is that AutoReturn was not yet engaged in towing related services 
in San Diego County when DTS helped it with its bid. In any event, regardless of whether DTS actually breached that provision, 
a trier of fact could reasonably view AutoReturn's [*123]  working with DTS to prepare a bid based on its proposed use 
LETS/TMS as a disruption of DTS's contractual relationship with ACT. "
1469,28," Through inadvertence or clerical error, the summary judgment order referred to ACT's 10th cause of action for ""Imposition of 
Constructive Trust"" and 11th cause of action for ""Equitable Lien"" as ACT's eighth and ninth causes of action, respectively, 
stating: ""ACT's counts 8 and 9 alleging a constructive trust or equitable lien fail as a matter of law as each is a remedy and not a 
cause[] of action."" "
1470,29," Although AutoReturn's notice of motion for attorney fees identifies the moving parties as both AutoReturn and the City, their 
argument heading regarding fees under section 3426.4 states that ACT and DTS ""must compensate AutoReturn for attorney 
fees spent in response to trade secret claims brought in bad faith under . . . [section] 3426.4."" (Capitalization omitted.) 
AutoReturn and the City's briefs in this appeal argue only that the court erred in not awarding attorney fees under section 3426.4 
to AutoReturn against ACT. We view this challenge to the court's denial of fees against ACT to be limited to the denial as to 
AutoReturn only, and not as to the City. "
1471,30," In the trial court, AutoReturn sought expert fees for Cohen's services in the amount of $36,050. "

the architectural paint stewardship program described in Section 48703."" Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 48701(h). "
1477,2," Although the Complaint [*6]  does not identify Plaintiff's unfair competition claim as one made under California's Unfair 
Competition Law (""UCL""), California Business and Professions Code section 17200, the parties appear to be in agreement that 
the UCL is the statute that forms the basis this claim. "
1478,3," Stericycle explicitly notes that provision does ""not apply to Stericycle."" Stericycle Joinder at 1-2."
1478,4," Antitrust law differentiates between vertical and horizontal price [*11]  restraints. ""Restraints imposed by agreement between 
competitors have traditionally been denominated as horizontal restraints, and those imposed by agreement between firms at 
different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 
108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988) (footnote omitted). With limited exceptions, horizontal agreements are per se unlawful, 
whereas vertical restraints are unlawful only if an assessment of market effects, known as the ""rule of reason"" analysis, reveals 
they unreasonably restrain trade. See Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 886, 907, 127 S. Ct. 
2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (citations omitted); see also McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 n.3 (9th Cir. 1988)

practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.'"" Id. (quoting Leegin Creative Leather 
Prods, 551 U.S. at 885). ""Second, antitrust plaintiffs can allege that a restraint is illegal per se because it is 'so plainly 
anticompetitive that no elaborate study of the industry is needed to establish their illegality.'"" Id. (quoting National Soc. of 
Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 692, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1978)). "
1480,6," Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b)(2), PaintCare requests the Court take judicial notice of various documents, 
including Exhibits C and E, which are PaintCare's Annual Reports from 2013 and 2014 respectively. Dkt. No. 26-1. Plaintiff did 
not object to PaintCare's request for judicial notice and even relied on these two Annual Reports in its Opposition. See Opp'n at 
3. The Court has reviewed Exhibits C and E and agrees with PaintCare that it may properly take judicial notice of them as 
information available in the public record and obtained from government websites. See MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Weisman, 803 
F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir. 1986) (""On a motion to dismiss, we may take judicial notice of matters of public record outside the 
pleadings."" (citation omitted)); see also Preciado v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65835, 2013 WL 1899929, 
at *3 (N.D. Cal. May 7, 2013) (taking judicial notice of information available on official government websites). The Court does not 
rely on the other exhibits for which PaintCare requested judicial notice and as such will not take judicial notice of them at this 
time. "
1489,1," The ""critical date"" refers to 35 U.S.C. § 102's on-sale bar. See Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. v. Sunbeam Prods., Inc., 726 F.3d 
1370, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 2013)."
1489,2," In fact, the allegations explain the ""the who, what, when, where, and how"" of the inequitable conduct. See Exergen, 575 F.3d at 
1329-30; see also Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1106 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Cooper v. Pickett, 137 F.3d 616, 
627 (9th Cir. 1997)). Defendant [*7]  names the specific actors involved in the alleged inequitable conduct (see Prop. Countercl. 
¶ 17), identifies which claims the withheld references are relevant to (see Prop. Countercl. ¶¶ 22-24, 28-29, 36, 40-42) and 
where the references to material information can be found (see Prop. Countercl. ¶¶ 19-21, 26, 32, 35). Moreover, the allegations 
""identify the particular claim limitations, or combination of claim limitations, that are supposedly absent from the information of 
record."" See Exergen, 575 F.3d at 1329. "
1490,3," The ""Norco Report"" is a more elegant name for a report describing FTIS tool and software used on March 3-7, 2003 to prepare 
a report on an examination of a refinery in Norco, Louisiana. See Prop. Countercl. ¶ 20."
1490,4," It is not entirely clear whether Plaintiff contests Defendant's definition of the relevant market. See Dkt. # 120 at 9. Although ""the 
validity of the 'relevant market' is typically a factual element rather than a legal element,"" a complaint may still be dismissed for 
alleging a facially unsustainable definition for the relevant market. Newcal Indus., 513 F.3d at 1045. As Plaintiff rightly notes, 
Defendant makes little effort to define the relevant market in its allegations. See Dkt. # 120 at 9; Prop. Countercl. ¶¶ 52, 60. But 
Plaintiff also does not present any reason the Court should find this market facially unsustainable. At this juncture, although the 
relevant market could be better defined (and may yet raise further issues), it is not so insufficient as to deny leave to amend. "

1495,7," 740 ILCS 10/11 expressly directs Illinois courts to look to federal law for guidance where the wording of the IAA is ""identical or 
similar to that of a federal antitrust law."" See discussion on page 9, infra. "
1496,8," Defendants seem to argue in their Reply brief against granting summary judgment in favor of the State on the entire case. Df. 
Reply at 20-21. The cross-motion by the State presently before the Court requests only partial summary judgment on the issue 
of whether section 5(14) of the IAA is applicable to the claims alleged if proven; it does not ask for summary judgment that they 
in fact have been proven, and the Court makes no finding at this time on the latter question."
1496,9," The Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment that is currently before the Court was filed prior to the Court's ruling on 
whether the Commerce Clause barred any of the State's claims against Defendants. "
1499,10," The distinction, for the federal courts, ""affects how disputed facts are handled, and it determines when a party may raise the 
point,"" since ""subject-matter jurisdiction must be secured at all times, regardless of whether the parties raise the issue, and no 
matter how much has been invested in a case."" Minn-Chem, Inc. v. Agrium Inc., 683 F.3d 845, 852-53 (7th Cir. 2012) (internal 
quotations omitted). "
1507,11," Defendants argue that Judge Illston's reasoning was incorrect, and that the domestic effects exception would not be rendered 
inoperative next to the exclusion of import commerce from FTAIA, even if it were held not to cover more than the first sale of a 
price-inflated product. Df. Reply at 29-30. Defendants argue it would still reach harm to exports, price-tying between foreign and 
domestic products, and monopolization harming domestic commerce. Df. Reply at 30. However, Defendants' reference to other 
types of conduct potentially addressed by FTAIA is a red herring. FTAIA does not address any specific underlying antitrust 
conduct that is embedded in other substantive antitrust statutes. FTAIA speaks to the nature of the effect (i.e., ""direct, 
substantial, reasonably foreseeable"") of the alleged conduct. TFT-LCD, 822 F. Supp. 2d at 963; Lotes Co., Ltd., 753 F.3d at 411. 
Defendants' attempt to address FTAIA with particular types of antitrust conduct thus fails where only the effects of that conduct 
are at issue. "
1508,12," Defendants also insist that the State must segregate claims based on the FIAIA exception from claims based on import 
commerce in accordance with the SRAM case, else ""all of their damage claims fail."" Df. Reply at 4; SRAM, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 141968, *48. Even assuming arguendo that SRAM would command such result, the court in SRAM allowed all of the 
claims in that case to proceed to trial, where sufficient evidence supporting each type of claim would be presented. SRAM, 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141968, *48. The SRAM determination thus does not support dismissal of such claims as a matter of law at this 
procedural juncture. "
1509,13," As the Second Circuit explained in Lotes, directness depends on ""many factors, including the structure of the market and the 
nature of the commercial relationships at each link in the causal chain."" Lotes Company, Ltd. v. Hon Hai Precision Industry 
Company, Ltd. 753 F.3d 395, 413 (2d Cir. 2014). "
1552,1," The Court previously filed this order provisionally under seal on April 19, 2016. ECF No. 4582. No party has filed a motion to 
seal any part of that order. Accordingly, pursuant to ECF No. 4477 ¶ 5, the Court now files the motion on the public docket. "

1558,2," A ""bellwether"" case is a test case. ""Bellwether"" trials should produce representative verdicts and settlements. The parties can 
use these verdicts and settlements to gauge the strength of the common MDL claims to determine if a global resolution of the 
MDL is possible. See FEDERAL JUDICIAL CENTER, MANUAL FOR COMPLEX LITIGATION, FOURTH EDITION 360 (2004); DUKE LAW CENTER FOR JUDICIAL STUDIES, MDL STANDARDS AND BEST PRACTICES 16-21 (2014). "
1559,3," See 71 Fed. Reg. 77314, 77321 (Dec. 26, 2006)(""FDA noted that there are limitations to interpreting the AERS data. Dosing 
information may be unreliable. Acetaminophen products are generally taken on an as-needed basis, so the actual dose ingested 
can be difficult to ascertain. There is no certainty that all of the adult cases included in this analysis were unintentional. Stigma 
may be associated with reporting suicide, so cases may be reported as unintentional when they were intentional overdoses. In 
addition, spontaneous reporting systems cannot provide certainty that acetaminophen was the cause of any of the reported 
adverse event. Furthermore, incidence rates cannot be determined, because the numerator or denominator descriptors for the 
entire population are not available. Overall, spontaneous reports may be subject to significant underreporting."")."
1559,4," The plaintiff also argues that the AERs could be considered party admissions. I will need to see the context and content of the 
AERs in order to make a ruling on this point."
1559,5," The 2002 Advisory Committee reviewed AERs to determine what risk of injury recommended dosing posed. See FDA Safety 
Analysis Power Point, Sept. 19, 2002 (Doc. No. 96, Ex. 7); FDA Memorandum Aug. 15, 2002 (Doc. No. 95, Ex. 17). The 
Acetaminophen Working Group of the FDA relied on AERs in making its recommendation to reduce the single caplet strength 
from 500 mg to 325 mg. See CDER Working Group Executive Summary and Recommendations, Feb. 26, 2008 (Doc. No. 96, 
Ex. 1). Other Committees Groups of the FDA use AERs as data for understanding further regulatory needs. See

1562,8, Daubert motions filed by the parties on this issue are still pending.
1562,9," To support their motion, the defendants cite cases where courts found that claims were impliedly preempted under Buckman. 
See, e.g., Farina v. Nokia Inc., 625 F.3d 97, 123 (3d Cir. 2010); In re Fosamax (Alendronate Sodium) Prods. Liab. Litig. (No. II),

2600220, at *11 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 11, 2005). These cases are not helpful. Whether the plaintiff's claims were preempted was an 
issue discussed in the defendants' motion for summary judgment. At issue here is whether the evidence related to the 
defendants' interactions with the FDA is admissible for purposes other than establishing liability or breach of duty. That is a 
different inquiry than whether the plaintiff's claims are preempted. "
1563,10," See also In re Vioxx Products Liab. Litig., MDL No. 1657, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47827, 132005 WL 3164254, at *1 (E.D. La.

Medtronic's efforts to manipulate the regulatory process in order to prove their negligence and strict liability claims, but they may 
not bring an independent claim for relief based on fraud-on-the-FDA."")."
1563,11," The plaintiff argues that this evidence also may be relevant if the defendants ""open the door"" and claim they are absolved from 
liability by complying with FDA regulations. These sorts of arguments will likely be precluded under Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 
555, 129 S. Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (2008). The defendants also cannot argue that the use of Extra Strength Tylenol in all 
circumstances was fully ""approved"" by the FDA because no Final Monograph has ever been issued. However, if the defendants 
offer such an affirmative defense, and I find it is permissible, evidence of their non-compliance with FDA regulations will be 
relevant to rebutting their defense."
1563,12," See In re Yasmin & Yaz (Drospirenone) Mktg., Sales Practices & PMF Products Liab. Litig., 3:09-CV-10012-DRH, 2011 U.S.

U.S. 555 129 S.Ct. 1187, 173 L. Ed. 2d 51 (2009) is a far better guidepost for this Court and for this litigation. Bayer's knowledge 
and notice of the adverse effects of the subject drugs are of paramount relevance in this litigation. It will ultimately be an 
intertwined decision of the jury on the issue of proper warning whether Bayer complied with the FDAs [sic] policies. But, it is 
clear that the FDA is, for all practical purposes, wholly dependent upon the honesty of the pharmaceutical proponent of a drug 
when engaged in the approval process. In a case such as this, the jury must be fully informed of any information withheld from 
the FDA that could have effected decisions regarding the label.""); Globetti v. Sandoz Pharm. Corp., No. CV98-TMP-2649-S,

the warning or the truth of information represented to or concealed from plaintiff or her physician. FRE 403 may [**21]  dictate 
that some such evidence be excluded to avoid confusing the jury about the exact nature of plaintiff's claims. Defendant remains

1566,25," The defendants argue that the information presented at these meetings still [**29]  has to be ""substantially similar"" to the 
injuries presented in this case. It is clear that the purpose of these meetings was to address the very concern at issue in this 
case—what risk was there to consumers of liver injury from taking Extra Strength Tylenol for therapeutic reasons. These 
meetings were on point with the issues presented in this case. This argument is not helpful."
1566,26," I made a previous ruling in this regard during the deposition of Ashley McEvoy. The parties could not agree about whether the 
evidence of employee compensation was relevant. They contacted me during the deposition to decide the issue. I ruled that the 
financial stake or interest in the corporation was relevant to bias. I confirmed this ruling in an Order dated February 26, 2014. 
See 13-md-2436, Doc. No. 123. While this Order pertained to the ability of the MDL plaintiffs to discover evidence related to 
employee compensation, the parameters set out in that Order offer good guidance on what types of employee compensation

at trial. My ruling on Motion in Limine #5 is meant to be narrow."
1568,30," The plaintiff's response centers on the expert report of Dr. Marvin Goldberg, the plaintiff's marketing expert. Whether these

1571,48," The plaintiff argues that these are ""prior bad acts"" which can show ""proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, 
knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake."" See Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). If the plaintiff had a manufacturing defect claim, this 
argument would have merit. However, I do not see this act as being similar enough to count as ""prior bad acts"" under Rule 404. The plaintiff also claims this evidence is relevant to the punitive damages claim, because it reflects ""a pattern and practice of 
evading federal marketing regulations and federal obligations."" I disagree. Again, the Consent Decree and Plea Agreement 
involved manufacturing defect issues. This is not a manufacturing defect case. "
1572,49," The plaintiff also argues that this evidence may be considered party admissions, which would not be hearsay. See Fed. R. 
Evid. 801(d). This also may be a reason the evidence would not be considered hearsay. Context, again, is important to 
determine this. [**48]"
1572,50," I do not consider a 2011 Consent Decree (i.e., settlement) or 2015 Plea Agreement with the federal government to be included 
in this evidence. Arguments about the admissibility of that evidence were raised in MIL 7 and are addressed in my ruling on that 
motion."
1572,51," Specifically, the defendants would like to exclude: • Post-injury changes to the labeling for over-the-counter Extra Strength Tylenol® labeling (e.g., McNeil's voluntary 
reduction of the listed maximum daily dose on its OTC acetaminophen products that was made in conjunction with FDA 
input-namely a reduction from 4,000 mg to 3,000 mg in a 24 hour period); • Post-injury changes to prescription acetaminophen labeling (see, 76 Fed. Reg. 2691 (Jan. 14, 2011)); • Post-injury FDA statements/pronouncements or regulations concerning prescription acetaminophen (see, e.g., FDA safety 
communications regarding limiting prescription acetaminophen products to 325 mg per dosage, and recommendations to 
health care professionals to stop dispensing prescription combination drug products with more than 325 mg of "
1573,," acetaminophen, http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/informationbydrugclass/ucm165107.htm ; and notice of public hearing 
on Over-The-Counter Drug Monograph System -Past Present, and Future, 79 Fed. Reg. 10168 (Feb. 24, 2014)); • Post-injury MedWatch 3 500 forms, including that of Ms. Hayes, or other adverse event reports; and • The notice of proposed rulemaking for acetaminophen [**51]  currently on the unified agenda with a projected completion 
date of December 2015 (79 Fed. Reg. 76718-01 (Dec. 22, 2014)). This is not an exhaustive list, however, of the types of evidence that might be covered by this motion."
1573,52," The plaintiff offers another example: evidence that the defendants neglected to follow up on adverse events after the 
decedent's death. This information will likely not be relevant. Punitive damages cannot be imposed on the defendants for 
conduct that occurred after the injury asserted. I note this example but decline to rule definitely on it until trial."
1573,53," See, e.g., Kenny v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp., 581 F.2d 351, 356 (3d Cir.1978)(""As a general rule, evidence of 
remedial measures taken after the event is not admissible to prove culpable conduct. Fed.R.Evid. 407. The reason for the 
exclusion is to encourage post-accident repairs or safety precautions [**53]  in the interest of public safety. See Saltzburg & 
Redden, Federal Rules of Evidence Manual 162 (2d ed. 1977). But when the defendant opens up the issue by claiming that all 
reasonable care was being exercised at the time, then the plaintiff may attack that contention by showing later repairs which are 
inconsistent with it. See 2 J. Weinstein & N. Berger, Weinstein's Evidence PP 407(03), (04) (1977)."")."
1573,54," The plaintiff also argues that the subsequent remedial measures were not voluntary and are, therefore, not covered by Rule 
407. In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of combination drugs containing acetaminophen, sold globally under trade 
names such as Tylenol and Panadol, to limit acetaminophen doses to no more than 325 mg in each tablet or capsule by January 
14, 2014. For this reason, the plaintiff argues, the changes were not voluntary. The majority of Circuits agree that a subsequent 
remedial measure is not ""voluntary"" if it is not done by the defendants. See Steele, Texas Emp. Ins. Ass'n, Intervenor v. 
Wiedemann Mach. Co., 280 F.2d 380, 382 (3d Cir. 1960)(holding the rule excluding evidence of repairs made after an accident 
is not applicable where the person who made the repairs is not a party to the suit); TLT—Babcock, Inc. v. Emerson Elec. Co., 33 
F.3d 397, 400 (4th Cir.1994)(""In the case at bar, the remedial measures were not taken by defendant [**54]  Emerson but rather 
were initiated by a third party, the Maryland Transit Authority. Under our reading of Rule 407, we conclude that the district court 
correctly admitted the disputed evidence.""); Lolie v. Ohio Brass Co., 502 F.2d 741, 744 (7th Cir. 1974)(Rule 407 has no 
applicability ""when the evidence is offered against a party...which did not make the changes.""); O'Dell v. Hercules, Inc., 904 F.2d 
1194, 1204 (8th Cir. 1990)(""An exception to Rule 407 is recognized for evidence of remedial action mandated by superior 
governmental authority or undertaken by a third party because the policy goal of encouraging remediation would not necessarily "
1574,," be furthered by exclusion of such evidence.""); In re Aircrash in Bali, Indonesia, 871 F.2d 812, 817 (9th Cir. 1989)(per 
curiam)(""The purpose of Rule 407 is not implicated in cases involving subsequent measures in which the defendant did not 
voluntarily participate.""); Mehojah v. Drummond, 56 F.3d 1213, 1215 (10th Cir.1995)(""'[R]ule 407 only applies to a defendant's 
voluntary actions;' it does not apply to subsequent remedial measures by non-defendants."" (citation omitted)(emphasis in 
original)); Millennium Partners, L.P. v. Colmar Storage, LLC, 494 F.3d 1293, 1302 (11th Cir. 2007)(""Rule 407 does not apply to a 
remedial measure that was taken without the voluntary participation of the defendant.""). The more specific question presented here is whether a subsequent remedial measure is ""voluntary"" if it was undertaken at the 
request or authority of a regulatory agency, like the FDA. Several Circuits have held that a [**55]  subsequent remedial change 
made at the bequest on a ""superior authority"" is not ""voluntary"" and, therefore, is not to be covered by Rule 407. See O'Dell v. 
Hercules, Inc., 904 F.2d 1194, 1204 (8th Cir. 1990)(""An exception to Rule 407 is recognized for evidence of remedial action 
mandated by superior governmental authority or undertaken by a third party because the policy goal of encouraging remediation 
would not necessarily be furthered by exclusion of such evidence.""); Herndon v. Seven Bar Flying Service, Inc., 716 F.2d 1322, 
1331 (10th Cir. 1983)(""Where a superior authority requires a tort feasor to make post-accident repairs, the policy of encouraging 
voluntary repairs which underlies Rule 407 has no force—a tort feasor cannot be discouraged from voluntarily making repairs if 
he must make repairs in any case."" (emphasis in original)); Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., 573 F.2d 1332, 1343 (5th Cir. 
1978)(""Invoking this policy [of Rule 407] to justify exclusion here is particularly inappropriate since the estimate was prepared not 
out of a sense of social responsibility but because the remedial measure was to be required in any event by a superior authority, 
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.""); In re Aircrash in Bali, Indonesia, 871 F.2d 812, 817 (9th Cir. 1989)(per 
curiam)(""Where the defendant has not voluntarily participated in the subsequent measure at issue, the admission of that 
measure into evidence does not 'punish' the defendant for his efforts to remedy his [**56]  safety problems. In this case, Pan 
Am's management, although to be commended for its cooperation, nonetheless was legally obligated to cooperate with the 
FAA's investigation. See 14 C.F.R. § 13.3. Thus, the admission of the Hudson report did not penalize Pan Am for its voluntary 
participation in safety measures.""). See generally Annot., Subsequent Remedial Measures, 158 A.L.R. Fed. 609 at § 5[a] (1999). The Third Circuit has not ruled on this issue. See Stecyk v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., No. CIV. A. 94-CV-1818, 1998 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 16772, 1998 WL 744087, at *12 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 23, 1998)(""There is a conflict within the federal courts regarding the 
court's authority to admit certain government-ordered remedial measures under the 'superior authority' exception to Fed.R.Evid. 
407 cited by plaintiffs. See generally, E. Lee Reichert, Note, The Superior Authority Exception"" to Federal Rule of Evidence 407: 
the Remedial Measure Required to Clarify a Confused State of Evidence, 1991 U. Ill. L. Rev. 843 (1991). In O'Dell v. Hercules, 
904 F.2d 1194 (8th Cir. 1990), the Eighth Circuit became the first to explicitly adopt an exception to Rule 407 for evidence of 
remedial action mandated by a superior authority. Conversely, the Fourth Circuit explicitly rejected a superior authority exception 
to Rule 407 in Werner v. Upjohn, 628 F.2d 848 (4th Cir.1980), cert denied, 449 U.S. 1080, 101 S. Ct. 862, 66 L. Ed. 2d 804 
(1981). To date, the Third Circuit has not ruled on whether to recognize a superior authority exception to Rule 407.""). There is not enough evidence before [**57]  the court to determine even if the possibly admissible subsequent remedial 
measure was ""voluntary"" or whether it was done at the behest of the FDA. For this reason, I will decline to make a ruling based 
on this ""theory"" of admissibility. When the plaintiff seeks to admit evidence of a post-death label change, the parties can then 
address the issue of whether Rule 407 applies based on the ""voluntariness"" of the subsequent change."
1574,55," See, e.g., Whitehead v. St. Joe Lead Co., Inc., 729 F.2d 238, 247 n. 6 (3d Cir. 1984)(subsequent remedial measure of label 
change admissible under Rule to show the feasibility of providing warnings); Siegle v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 1990 U.S. Dist.

Inc., 519 F.2d 1352, 1354 (8th Cir. 1975)(""Evidence of such changes are, however, admissible for some purposes such as 
demonstration [**58]  of knowledge of dangerous properties prior to the accident or the availability of better design or the

part of the res gestae."") and id. at 88 (acknowledging that proof of ownership is an additional exception to the rule)."
1575,56," The defendants support this argument with Horn v. Thoratec Corp., 376 F.3d 163, 178 (3d Cir. 2004). Horn did quote part of 
the FDA's amicus brief stating: ""[I]t is inappropriate for a jury to second-guess FDA's scientific judgment on such a matter that is 
within FDA's particular expertise."" The FDA has not offered any opinion on the outcome of this motion or case. That case also 
involved a medical device and different regulations than this one. Horn discussed whether preemption was appropriate, not 
whether evidence was admissible. I have already ruled that the plaintiff's claims are not preempted by Buckman. For these 
reasons, Horn is not helpful. I also note that the FDA itself has questioned the efficacy of the monograph process. See FDA Is Seeking Ideas for a ""New and

1576,57," The doctrine also includes a ""sham exception"" which provides that ""activity 'ostensibly directed toward influencing 
governmental action' does not qualify for Noerr immunity if it 'is a mere sham to cover...an attempt to interfere directly with the 
business relationships of a competitor.'"" Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 134 S.Ct. 1749, 1757, 188 L. Ed. 
2d 816 (2014)(citation omitted). Since the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does not apply here, I see no reason to consider argument 
about whether the sham exception applies to prevent immunity."
1576,58," See, e.g., We, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, 174 F.3d 322, 327 (3d Cir. 1999)(""Thus, the purpose of Noerr—Pennington as 
applied in areas outside the antitrust field is the protection of the right to petition. Immunity from liability is necessary so as not to

1075, 1084 (5th Cir. 1998)(""Although the Noerr—Pennington doctrine initially arose in the antitrust field, other circuits have 
expanded it to protect first amendment petitioning of the government from claims brought under federal and state laws, including 
section 1983 and common-law tortious interference with contractual relations. [**64]  See, e.g., Evers v. County of Custer, 745 
F.2d 1196, 1204 (9th Cir. 1984); Gorman Towers, Inc. v. Bogoslavsky, 626 F.2d 607, 614 (8th Cir.1980), and cases cited 
therein. We find it easy to agree that the same rationale under antitrust law that supports WAX's petitions to the City also 
serves to protect WAX from the tort claim. There is simply no reason that a common-law tort doctrine can any more permissibly 
abridge or chill the constitutional right of petition than can a statutory claim such as antitrust."")."
1576,59," The Third Circuit in In re Asbestos School Litigation, 46 F.3d 1284 (3d Cir. 1994), relied on NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware 
Co., 458 U.S. 886, 913-15, 102 S. Ct. 3409, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1215 (1982), in making its decision. However, the court's focus was 
more on a violation of Pfizer's First Amendment right to associate with a lobbying organization than it was Pfizer's right to petition 
the government. Id. at 1289-94. See also id. at 1294 (""In sum, then, the district court's decision was clearly wrong. Worse, it has 
implications that broadly threaten First Amendment rights. The district court's holding suggests that Pfizer-based solely on its 
limited and (as far as the record reflects) innocent association with the SBA-could be held liable, as the plaintiffs have urged, for 
all of the allegedly tortious acts committed by all of the defendants, whether before or after the SBA was formed. The 
implications of such a holding are far-reaching. Joining organizations that participate in public debate, making contributions to 
them, [**65]  and attending their meetings are activities that enjoy substantial First Amendment protection....But the district 
court's holding, if generally accepted, would make these activities unjustifiably risky and would undoubtedly have an 
unwarranted inhibiting effect upon them."" (citations omitted)). While the lobbying organization's communications with Congress 
would be protected, the Court noted that misleading communications by the lobbying organization to plaintiffs and potential 
members of the class may not be protected and could be evidence of fraudulent concealment. See id. at 1290 and 1290, n. 4. "

decisions focused on whether New Jersey was an appropriate forum, not whether foreign labels would be admissible evidence. I 
do not find these cases to be helpful. They also cite to Meridia Prods. Liab. Litig. v. Abbott Labs., 447 F.3d 861 (6th Cir. 2006). In Meridia, the Sixth Circuit reviewed 
whether the district court's grant of summary judgment was appropriate. Id. at 863. The court considered whether a foreign label 
with different instructions created a ""triable issue of fact,"" not whether admission [**68]  of a foreign label was permissible. See 
id. at 867. This case is not helpful. The other cases offered by the defendants to support their relevance argument are also not on point or are not persuasive. See 
Hurt v. Coyne Cylinder Co., 956 F.2d 1319, 1327 (6th Cir. 1991)(discussing the use of foreign labels in the context of whether a

serious side effects in advertising)."
1579,66," The parties also discuss the relevant regulatory standards for over-the-counter drug marketing, as enforced by the Federal

1579,69," To support this point, the defendants point to other cases which have excluded marketing evidence: Zundel v. Johnson & 
Johnson, No. MID-L-6854-05, Hrg. Tr., at 60-62 (N.J. Super. Ct., Middlesex Cty. Jan. 13, 2009)(Doc. No. 76, Ex. E); In re 
Norplant Contraceptive Prods. Liab. Litig., 165 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir. 1999); and Appleby v. Glaxo Wellcome, Inc., 2005 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 32875, 2005 WL 3440440, at *4 n. 5 (D. N.J. Dec. 13, 2005). These cases are not helpful. In Zundel, the judge excluded marketing evidence because it was not relevant to the plaintiff's failure-to-warn claim. See No. 
MID-L-6854-05, Hrg. Tr., at 60-62 (N.J. Super. Ct., Middlesex Cty. Jan. 13, 2009)(Doc. No. 76, Ex. E). However, it is not clear 
from that decision whether the plaintiff also had asserted a punitive damages claim. In this case, the marketing evidence may be 
relevant to state [**74]  of mind, which is especially important to the plaintiff's punitive damages claim. For this reason, I cannot 
say that Zundel is helpful. In re Norplant Contraceptive Prods. Liab. Litig., 165 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir. 1999), was an appeal of a summary judgment 
decision. The Fifth Circuit briefly discussed the appellant's argument that evidence of ""aggressive"" marketing should negate 
adequate warnings. The court found that this argument was ""critically weakened by the absence of any evidence on the record 
that any of the five plaintiffs actually saw, let alone relied, on any marketing materials issued to them by [the defendant]."" Id. The 
court went on to explain that even if there was evidence of the plaintiff relying on marketing, the learned-intermediary doctrine 
would make summary judgment appropriate. Id. Norplant, unlike this case, involved a prescription drug. Given Norplant's 
procedural and factual differences, it is distinguishable and not persuasive. "
1580,," Appleby v. Glaxo Wellcome, Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32875, 2005 WL 3440440 (D. N.J. Dec. 13, 2005), also involved a 
prescription drug. In discussing whether a direct marketing exception of the learned intermediary doctrine existed, the court 
found that liability premised on this theory could not stand because the plaintiff had not presented evidence she was affected by 
marketing. 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32875, [WL] at *4-5. This case is distinguishable. [**75]"
1580,70," To support this theory, the defendants cite decisions in Wolfe v. McNeil-PPC, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47710, 2011 WL 
1673805, at *8-9 (E.D. Pa. May 4, 2011), and Lyles v. McNeil-PPC, Inc., No. ATL-L-8655-11 (N.J. Super. Ct.). These decisions 
are not helpful. Both of those decisions discussed whether the expert testimony of Dr. Marvin Goldberg, the plaintiff's marketing 
expert, should be excluded under Daubert. The defendants filed a separate Daubert motion to exclude Dr. Goldberg's testimony. 
The plaintiff also makes arguments in this motion in limine about the admissibility of Dr. Goldberg's testimony. The extent to 
which Dr. Goldberg's testimony is admissible has been addressed in my decision on his Daubert motion. See Doc. No. 315 (Mar. 
2, 2016)."

consuming public that consumption of beer on the order of eight to twelve cans of beer per week can be a part of the 'good life' 
and is properly associated with healthy, robust activities, this conclusion would be an important consideration for the jury in 
determining whether an express warning was necessary to make Old Milwaukee beer safe for its intended purpose. Cf. Baldino

and create a false controversy as to whether smoking caused lung [**80]  cancer and other diseases, and evidence that

told Mr. Hickox that the mask would disperse energy and protect against concussion, and that the mask was the best and safest 
technology. Mr. Hickox also testified that he believed that companies like Wilson tested new products and did not sell them 
unless they were safe to use. Jurors could consider such testimony [**81]  in combination with their own reasonable inferences

drug industry to do so. He must, therefore, also be given such information by the manufacturer as will permit him to self-
prescribe with a minimum of risk."")."
1582,76," See id. at 322-23 (""It was clearly for the jury to determine whether in fact that danger is, in Restatement verbiage, as 'generally 
known and understood' among lay consumers as it apparently is in medical and pharmaceutical circles. In our [**83]  view, the 
duty of the manufacturer explicitly to warn consumers of the specific risks of over-the-counter drug use derives from the basic 
marketing predicate of the over-the-counter drug industry, namely, that nonprescription drugs are purchased by consumers for 
the purpose of self-medication typically without any intended or actual intervention by a physician. The consuming public may 
well appreciate that an inherent risk of self-medication is delay or failure in obtaining professional attention for an ailment 
requiring more than simple symptomatic relief. But it has also been led to believe that while the over-the-counter product may 
not prove ultimately helpful, neither will it harm if taken as directed. Indeed, a jury would be justified in concluding that the 
advertising and mass marketing techniques involved in selling aspirin to the consumer are calculated to assure the public of its 
essential innocuousness and inherent safety. It is indeed this actual and intended direct relationship between the manufacturer 
and the consumer of over-the-counter drugs, in contradistinction to the interposition between them of the physician where 
prescription drugs are involved, which accounts [**84]  for what has become a well-recognized dichotomy in respect of the 
required recipient of the manufacturer's warning, namely, that while it is the consumer who is entitled to the warning in respect of 
nonprescription drugs, only the prescribing physician need be warned as to the risks involved in a prescription drug.""). "

1584,79," The plaintiff also plans to have their experts use these documents in forming opinions about post-marketing reporting and

rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject."" Fed. R. Evid. 703. Whether the press release or public

1585,81," See also Ex parte Hsu, 707 So.2d 223, 225 (Ala. 1997)(""Accordingly, we turn to long-standing Alabama law on the issue of 
admissibility of evidence of a defendant's wealth. Under that law, 'evidence of a defendant's wealth is [**94]  highly prejudicial 
and, therefore, inadmissible [during trial].' Southern Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Whitman, 358 So.2d 1025, 1026 (Ala. 1978), citing

defendant's wealth is considered relevant and admissible in a post-verdict hearing on alleged excessiveness of a punitive 
damages award, held before the trial judge pursuant to the procedure this Court adopted in Hammond v. City of Gadsden, 
supra.""). This rule of exclusion has been considered substantive and not procedural by other federal courts. See Wilson v. Gillis Adver. 
Co., 145 F.R.D. 578, 580 (N.D. Ala. 1993)(""Although an argument can be made that this is simply an Alabama rule of evidence, "
1586,," and is thus procedural rather than substantive, it is so fundamental to the resolution of the issue of punitive damages under the 
Alabama law theories as to be effectively substantive and as a practical matter binding on a federal trial court when it tries an 
Alabama tort claim seeking punitive damages.""); Carr v. City of Florence, 729 F. Supp. 783, 786 (N.D. Ala. 1990)(applying 
wealth exclusionary rule), aff'd, 934 F.2d 1264 (11th Cir. 1991). The Alabama Supreme Court has indicated that arguments about what awards may be sufficient to punish the defendants are 
not proper, but such improper comments may not cause reversible errors if a curative instruction is offered. See Daniel 
Construction Co. V. Pierce, 270 Ala. 522, 120 So.2d 381, 386-387 (Ala. 1960)(discussing whether attorney arguing ""if the jury 
brings out a verdict less than $50,000 it wouldn't [**95]  be any more than a mosquito bite to this defendant"" was reversible 
error; finding it was improper but cured by jury instruction); Blount Bros. Construction Co. v. Rose, 274 Ala. 429, 149 So.2d 821, 
831-833 (1963)(explaining that argument ""Why, a $25,000 verdict against Blount Brothers would not be a slap on the leg to

1984)(plaintiff's counsel's argument in closing statement regarding size and contents of defendant deceased's estate held to be 
improper/highly prejudicial and warranted remand for new trial and reversal)."
1586,82," The plaintiff also argues that financial wealth information may be admissible if the defendants ""open the door"" to such 
evidence. There is caselaw in Alabama supporting this point. See Mutual Sav. Life Ins. Co. v. Smith, 765 So. 2d 652, 655-56 
(Ala. Civ. App. 1998)(""The rule under discussion does not operate to exclude evidence of wealth or poverty if such is relevant to 
some issue, other than damages, properly in the case. One way for such an issue to be properly in a case is for one's opponent 
to have opened the door by commenting upon or asking questions concerning a party's financial standing. Whenever one 
addresses a particular subject, even if impermissibly so, this then permits the opponent to rebut such evidence under the 
doctrine of 'curative admissibility.' [**96]  Some writers and courts have referred to this as 'retaliatory admissibility.'"")(quoting 1 
Charles W. Gamble, McElroy's Alabama Evidence, § 189.05(1)(5th ed. 1996)); City of Gulf Shores v. Harbert Int'l, 608 So. 2d

defendant's, is inadmissible generally....However, we also recognize that an opposing party may inquire into the other party's 
wealth on cross-examination or in rebuttal if the other party 'opens the door.'"")(citations omitted). However, the parties are 
expected to abide by Alabama's rule of precluding evidence of a party's wealth because unintentional admission of such 
evidence could result in a mistrial."
1586,83," The defendants are also precluded from implying that their net worth is the reason the plaintiff has brought suit against them. 
See Baptist Med. Ctr. Montclair v. Whitfield, 950 So. 2d 1121, 1128 (Ala. 2006)(finding arguments by defense counsel that 
plaintiff dismissed individual doctor so that she could ""focus on recovering from BMC, a corporation, which had more money than

Co., Inc., 289 Ala. 443, 446-49, 268 So. 2d 725 (1972)(finding that defense counsel's argument ""It's a great thing, folks, to be a

reversal). "
1587,84," See Southern Life and Health Ins. Co. v. Smith, 518 So.2d 77, 80-82 (Ala. 1987)(finding that argument ""'A corporation, [**99]

1957)(finding plaintiff's counsel's comment ""We have also dismissed as to Mr. Ritchie. We don't want to penalize Mr. Ritchie. We

1587,86," I note, as the plaintiff has, that Johnson & Johnson remains a named defendant in this case. No summary judgment motion or 
other motion has been filed asserting the theory stated above. If the defendants disagree with my ruling on this point, they may 
file a motion for reconsideration. "
1590,1," All of the named parties in this action are members of the ATA. (TAC ¶¶ 8, 21.) "
1592,2," Defendant ICM objects to the declarations of Ted P. Tatos and Charles Lenhoff in support of Plaintiff's Opposition. (See Dkt. 
No. 63.) The declarations purportedly establish ""that the percentage of co-packaged shows between Uber Agencies is 
enormously out of proportion [*11]  with the statistical likelihood of such co-packaging based on the number of agencies in the 
market."" (Pl.'s ICM Opp'n at 24; Pl.'s UTA Opp'n at 23-24.) In ruling on a motion to dismiss, a court may not look beyond the 
pleadings except in limited circumstances, none of which apply here. See United States v. Corinthian Colls., 655 F.3d 984, 998-
99 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the Court considers these declarations in determining only whether to grant 
leave to amend. See Acinelli v. Torres, No. ED CV 13-1371-AB (PLA), 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92759, 2015 WL 4380772, at *2 
n.3 (C.D. Cal. July 16, 2015) (citing Orion Tire Corp. v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 268 F.3d 1133, 1137-38 (9th Cir. 2001)). "
1595,3," Defendant UTA claims to have contacted Plaintiff regarding the ""facial inaccuracies"" of this data, (UTA Mot. at 3 n.1), and 
Plaintiff concedes the existence of ""two minor errors,"" (Pl.'s UTA Opp'n at 13 n.5). Even assuming the exhibits were entirely 
accurate, the data still conflicts with Plaintiff's allegation that Defendants conspired to entirely exclude non-Big 4 Agencies from 
co-packaging with them. "
1596,4," In its TAC, Plaintiff adds a quote from an alleged 2014 email sent by the chairman of Sony Pictures. (See TAC ¶ 18 (""They 
[Uber Agencies] are demanding and getting fees now on these from the financiers (they call it a 'packaging fee') and are keeping 
as many emerging high[-]end filmmaker projects off the market until they have full control."") (emphasis omitted); RJN, Ex. B.) 
The email, however, is irrelevant to this matter, as it concerns a motion picture investment rather than a scripted television series 
package. (See ICM Mot. at 15, 15 n.6; RJN, Exs. B, C.) "
1597,5," Given that Plaintiff again fails to satisfy these two elements, the Court need not discuss the remaining two elements of Plaintiff's 
§ 1 Sherman Act claim. "
1598,6," Because ""[t]he analysis under California's antitrust law mirror the [*29]  analysis under federal law,"" County of Tuolumne v. 
Sonora Cmty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16700 et seq.), Plaintiff's new 
allegation that Defendants violated the Cartwright Act does not alter the Court's conclusion, (see TAC ¶ 83)."
1598,7," Plaintiff explains that Clients #1 and #2 are directors and members of the DGA. (TAC ¶¶ 91, 96.)"
1598,8," As discussed below, the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to (1) sufficiently allege that Client #1's contract was not at will and (2) 
defeat the competitor's privilege. Thus, the Court need not address Defendant UTA's additional argument that Plaintiff fails to 
adequately allege knowledge or causation with respect to the Client #1 agreement. (See UTA Mot. at 24-25.) "
1599,9," Although Plaintiff alleges that its agreement with Client #2 ""commenced on . . . February 10, 2009"" and had an ""initial term of 
years, with a 2-year renewal term, followed by 1-year [*32]  terms,"" (see TAC ¶ 95), Plaintiff fails to allege whether the initial two-
year agreement was ever renewed, thereby continuing the term contract. Further, the alleged acts of interference appear to have 
occurred shortly before Client #2 gave notice of termination of June 26, 2014, (see TAC ¶ 97), after the initial two-year term had 
expired. Thus, without any allegation as to whether the initial two-year agreement was renewed, Plaintiff fails to sufficiently plead 
that, at the time of the alleged interference, the agreement with Client #2 was for a specified term. "
1610,1," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c)."
1610,2," The Dang Patents include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,835,897; 6,370,511; 7,620,560; 7,725,333; 7,774,216; 7,979,290; 8,121,869;

] As to both claim preclusion [*21]  and issue preclusion, ""the law is well settled that the pendency of an appeal has no 
affect [sic] on the finality or binding effect of a trial court's holding."" SSIH Equip. S.A. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 718 F.2d 365, 
370 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (citing Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, 191 U.S. 499, 24 S. Ct. 154, 48 L. Ed. 276 (1903); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller 
& E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4433 (1981)); see also, e.g., Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. v. Mylan Pharms., Inc., 
170 F.3d 1373, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Cygnus Telecoms. Tech., LLC v. Am. Int'l Telephonics, LLC, 569 F. Supp. 2d 1035, 1038 
(N.D. Cal. 2008). The Court applies the same rule to the pending post-trial motions in Cave I and holds that the judgment in that 
case is sufficiently final for the purposes of either preclusion doctrine. "
1616,9," USM Corp. v. SPS Techs., Inc., 102 F.R.D. 167, 169-70 (N.D. Ill. 1984). "
1617,10," OptumInsight has cited no authority for the proposition that the determination of compulsory counterclaims is a matter of 
uniform Federal Circuit law, nor any decision in which the Federal Circuit actually decided the significance of the Supreme 
Court's Mercoid decision. OptumInsight suggests that the Ninth Circuit's approach in Hydranautics creates a special [*27]  rule 
for patent cases, which would then bring the issue within the Federal Circuit's realm of authority. That approach would not 
change the outcome. If the question is one of Federal Circuit law, the Federal Circuit has not set forth a clear rule, and the Court 
finds the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of Mercoid persuasive absent more recent Supreme Court precedent altering the rule set 
forth in that case. The Court acknowledges, however, that there is a split of authority on the issue. See Def.'s Supp'l Br. at 13-14 
(collecting cases from outside the Ninth Circuit holding that antitrust claims are or can be compulsory counterclaims in 
infringement actions). "
1618,11," OptumInsight attempts to distinguish the trademark law at issue in the Restatement example from the patent law at issue here, 
but does not address Zip Dee or Hill-Rom, both of which involved patent claims. See Def.'s Supp'l Br. at 15. Moreover, the 
distinctions OptumInsight identifies between [*30]  the two areas of law have no bearing on whether the non-invalidity of a patent 
is essential to a judgment of non-infringement."
1618,12," OptumInsight seeks to reserve its right to raise an issue preclusion defense if the non-infringement verdict in Cave I is altered 
as a result of post-judgment motions or an appeal. Def.'s Supp'l Br. at 16. The Court expresses no opinion on the potential effect 
of such a contingency at this time. "
1619,13," CCGroup's sham litigation argument is based solely on the validity and enforceability of Optumlnsight's patents. CCGroup 
does not argue that, if the patents are valid and enforceable, OptumInsight could not make a good faith argument that CCGroup 
infringed the '079 patent. "
1620,14," The Federal Circuit previously held that ""inequitable conduct is a broader, more inclusive concept than the common law fraud 
needed to support a Walker Process counterclaim."" Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1069 (Fed. 
Cir. 1998). Since then, the Federal Circuit has narrowed if not closed the gap between basic inequitable [*37]  conduct and 
Walker Process fraud, by setting forth a stringent pleading standard for inequitable conduct in Exergen and a stringent standard 
for success on the merits in Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 649 F.3d 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (en banc). Both parties 
appear to agree that Exergen and Therasense govern CCGroup's Walker Process claim. See Mot. at 16-17; Opp'n at 9-11. For 
the purpose of this Order, the Court assumes without deciding that Exergen and Therasense have effectively harmonized the 
standards for Walker Process fraud and other assertions of inequitable conduct. See Cornucopia Prods., LLC v. Dyson, Inc., 881 
F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1099 n.4 (D. Ariz. 2012) (""Therasense, however, raised inequitable conduct to match the standard for Walker "
1621,," Process claims based on omission.""); but see Nalco Co. v. Turner Designs, Inc., No. 13-CV-02727 NC, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
21362, 2014 WL 645365, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 19, 2014) (acknowledging that the Therasense inequitable conduct standard is 
""arguably"" identical to Walker Process fraud, but nevertheless maintaining a formal distinction between the two)."
1621,15," CCGroup suggests that it is excused from the requirement to plead specific patent claims and limitations because the false 
affidavits were allegedly per se material to the uSPTO's decision. Opp'n at 12-13. The case it cites for that proposition does not 
state such a rule, and in fact discusses the individual patent claim specifically cited in the pleading at issue. See Spectrum 
Pharms., Inc., v. Sandoz Inc., No. 2:12-CV-00111-GMN, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140783, 2013 WL 5492667, at *3 (D. Nev. Sept. 
30, 2013) (""Specifically, Defendant alleges that the prosecuting attorney routinely certified to the USPTO that the claim that 
ultimately issued as claim 13 was a dependent claim . . . .""). Absent authority to the contrary, the Court follows the requirements 
set by the Federal Circuit in Exergen, even where CCGroup asserts per se materiality. "
1624,16," OptumInsight also argues for the first time in its Reply that Zenith only recognized Lanham Act liability for two categories of 
misrepresentations related to patents: ""(1) that a specific party infringes specific patents, and (2) that a specific party cannot 
manufacture a noninfringing product."" Reply at 18. Although those were the two types of statements specifically considered in 
Zenith, there is no indication that the holding was limited to only those categories, and OptumInsight does not identify any 
authority endorsing that narrow reading of the case. The Court concludes that Zenith does not restrict Lanham Act claims based 
on misrepresentation of patents except to require a showing of bad faith. "
1629,1," The identity of Ford Racing and its relationship to Ford is unclear from the Complaint. Plaintiff begins mentioning Ford Racing 
without an introduction in Paragraph 17 of the Complaint and mentions it throughout. "
1631,2," SHR cites to one Southern District of Florida case holding that Noerr-Pennington does not apply outside of antitrust law. Slip-
N-Slide Records, Inc. v. TVT Records, LLC, No. 05-21113-Civ-TORRES, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9014, 2007 WL 473273, at *6 
(S.D. Fla. Feb. 8, 2007). However, that decision does not discuss the circuit court decisions in the area. The Court finds the 
above-cited circuit court decisions to be more persuasive. "
1644,1," Defendants include: iSqFt, Inc., Construction Market Data Group, LLC (""CMD""), Construction Data Corporation, LLC (""CDC""), 
and BidClerk, Inc. (collectively ""Defendants""). iSqFt is a software-as-a-service company that licenses access to its construction 
software and databases to general contractors, subcontractors, manufacturers, and suppliers in the North American commercial 
construction industry. iSqFt acquired BidClerk in October 2014, CDC in April 2015, and CMD in August 2015. (Doc. 28 at ¶¶ 45-
46)."
1644,2," Also pending before the Court is a motion to dismiss (Doc. 26) that was filed before Plaintiff Dodge Data amended its 
complaint. (Doc. 28). The amended complaint rendered the motion to dismiss (Doc. 26) moot. Computerease Software, Inc. v. 
Hemisphere Corp., No. 06cv247, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64753, at *1 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 19, 2007) (""Since the amended complaint 
replaces the original complaint, the motion to dismiss the original complaint is moot.""). Accordingly, the first motion to dismiss 
(Doc. 26) is DENIED as MOOT. "
1645,3," The parties request oral argument. (Doc. 29 at 1 and Doc. 32 at 1). The Court finds that the pleadings are clear on their face, 
and that oral argument and/or an evidentiary hearing is not necessary. See Whitescarver v. Sabin Robbins Paper Co., Case No.

once again attempts to divide the practices into discrete, distinct activities, each of which prior courts may have found to be

taken together, they show a pattern of exclusionary behavior sufficient to support the jury verdict."" Conwood Co. v. U.S. Tobacco 
Co., No. 5:98-cv-108-R, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12761, at *11 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 10, 2000). "

flexibility to apply a cost-based test other than average variable cost"")."
1649,11," iSqFt/CMD complains that Dodge Data has only set forth one example of a post-merger predatory price charged by 
iSqFt/CMM. Defendants, however, do not explain what the significance of [**17]  the merger date is (or if it has in fact occurred). 
Even if the predatory pricing ceased entirely after the complaint was filed, that would not change Defendants' liability for any acts 
that they have allegedly already committed. "
1650,12," If iSqFt/CMD were interested in maximizing profits, there was no reason to resort to prices that were so drastically below that 
which Dodge Data was offering. Therefore, Dodge Data offers sufficient facts to allege that iSqFt/CMD's pricing strategy was 
more concerned with eliminating Dodge Data's revenue and driving it from the relevant market than it was with its own short-
term profitability."
1650,13," HN21[
] ""Specific intent"" for an attempted monopolization claim may be inferred from the existence of anticompetitive acts. 
See, e.g.., Arthur S. Langenderfer, Inc., 917 F.2d at 1432."

examination of ""barriers to entry."" White & White, Inc. v. Am. Hosp. Supply Corp., 723 F.2d 495, 507 (6th Cir. 1983). "
1651,15," Defendants argue that there is some possibility that if their predatory pricing scheme continues that they, instead of Dodge 
Data, will exit the market. However, Defendants fail to cite any case law where a court dismissed an attempt to monopolize claim 
because the plaintiff attempted to survive that scheme."
1651,16," Defendants argue that a 50% market share is insufficient to support an attempted monopoly claim. However, HN25[
] there 
are dozens of cases stating that market shares of 50% are ""generally"" sufficient to support such a claim, and much lower market 
shares may support such a claim when there are strong barriers to entry. See, e.g., Smith Wholesale Co. v. Philip Morris USA, 
Inc., No. 2:03cv221, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18078 (E.D. Tenn. Aug. 16, 2005), aff'd, 219 F. App'x 398 (6th Cir. 2007) (Philip 
Morris' market share of 49-56% was sufficient to establish market power for an attempted monopolization claim). "
1652,17," Defendants argue that a few years ago several smaller competitors began to emerge. ""None of these competitors, however, 
was successful in obtaining more than a de minimis share of the relevant market for Nationwide CPI."" (Doc. 28 at ¶ 41). "

(N.D. Ohio May 12, 2008) (holding that ""the question of likelihood of confusion is best resolved after discovery on summary 
judgment"")."
1653,19," Defendants argue that the dollar sign [**29]  used on CDC's website cannot be confused with Dodge Data's ""S"" or the 
advertisement that it is inviting customers to ""Advertise with Construction Data"" Corporation (CDC), not in the Sweets catalog. 
(Doc. 28 at ¶ 77). "

Prods., Inv. v. Bobrick Washroom Equip., Inc., 401 F.3d 123, 132 (3d Cir. 2005), at minimum, a plaintiff must show that such 
statements induced or were likely to induce reasonable reliance by consumers, see, e.g., National Asso. of Pharmaceutical

Eisai's brief, in passing, provides only a handful of examples of hospitals that decided not to switch to Fragmin after their 
representatives attended meetings presented by Sanofi or its consultants. [**26]  But, even if these examples were enough to

1682,3," In a separate order, the court is today granting defendants' motion to strike [*11]  paragraph 79 of the complaint, which had 
alleged the secret meetings. Thus, the court treats paragraph 79 as deleted. "
1683,4," The plaintiffs in Standard were actually third-party plaintiffs, the complaints third-party [*16]  complaints, and defendants third-
party defendants. However, this court refers to them as plaintiffs, complaints, and defendants for ease of discussion. "
1684,5," The Hinds court observed that the case law regarding the third prong is ""not entirely consistent"": The third prong has been characterized as requiring a showing that the plaintiff's ignorance of the claim ""was not the result 
of lack of diligence,"" Hendrickson Bros., 840 F.2d at 1083. It has also been characterized as a requirement that a plaintiff 
show ""due diligence in pursuing discovery of the claim,"" National Group, 420 F.Supp.2d at 265; see also Merrill Lynch, 154 
F.3d at 60."
1684,620," F. Supp. 2d at 522. Finding the first formulation ""problematic"" because it ""allows the allegations required to satisfy the first 
prong of fraudulent concealment to also satisfy the third prong"" and ""is difficult to characterize . . . as pleading with particularity,"" 
the Hinds [*18]  court noted that it agreed with other courts that in this context, ""[g]eneral assertions of ignorance and due 
diligence without more specific explanation . . . will not satisfy the[ ] pleading requirements."" Id. (alterations in original). Thus, 
""[d]ue diligence is not adequately pled if plaintiffs 'did not allege in the [complaint] that they exercised due diligence' or if they 
'make no allegation of any specific inquiries of [defendants], [or] detail when such inquiries were made, to whom, regarding what, 
and with what response.'"" Id. (quoting Merrill Lynch, 154 F.3d at 60) (alterations in original)."
1684,6," Plaintiffs' attorney described their investigation in some detail at oral argument. See Tr. at 37-41. [*19]  However, that is 
irrelevant if not pled in the complaint."
1684,7," At oral argument, plaintiffs also claimed that the alleged price-fixing constitutes a ""continuing violation,"" and that that saves the 
entire class period from the statute of limitations. Tr. at 51. It is far from clear that the ""continuing violation"" theory would save the 
entire class period. See Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp., 521 U.S. 179, 189-90, 117 S. Ct. 1984, 138 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1997) (""Antitrust 
law provides [*20]  that, in the case of a 'continuing violation,' say, a price—fixing conspiracy that brings about a series of 
unlawfully high priced sales over a period of years, 'each overt act that is part of the violation and that injures the plaintiff,' e.g., 
each sale to the plaintiff, 'starts the statutory period running again, regardless of the plaintiff's knowledge of the alleged illegality 
at much earlier times.' But the commission of a separate new overt act generally does not permit the plaintiff to recover for the 
injury caused by old overt acts outside the limitations period."") (quoting 2 P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 338b, p. 
145 (rev. ed.1995)) (citations omitted); Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 502 n. 15, 88 S. Ct. "

F. Supp. 2d at 519. In any event, this issue was not addressed in the pleadings or the briefs. Therefore, the court will not 
consider it."
1685,8," This argument was not raised at oral argument, so it appears S.B. Collins has backed away from it. To the extent S.B. Collins 
still relies on that argument, the court addresses it here for clarification. "
1686,9," ""Hence, when allegations of parallel conduct are set out in order to make a[n [*24]  antitrust] claim, they must be placed in a 
context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement, not merely parallel conduct that could just as well be independent 
action."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557."
1686,10," There is also considerable disagreement as to whether Twombly [*25]  actually imposed a heightened pleading standard, or 
merely clarified the already existing standard under Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). See 
Colby, 184 Vt. 1, 2008 VT 20, ¶ 5 n.1, 955 A.2d 1082; id. ¶ 19 n.3 (Burgess, J., dissenting); Wright & Miller, 5 Fed. Prac. & Proc. 
Civ. §§ 1202, 1216 (3d ed.). It is not clear that the decision in Twombly would actually change the result in any pre-Twombly 
antitrust decisions involving motions to dismiss. "
1687,11," As argued by plaintiffs, a literal reading of Heritage might suggest that an allegation of parallel pricing alone could be enough 
to survive a motion to dismiss. See Pls.' Opp'n at 2, 13-15; Heritage, 137 Vt. at 427-28 (""Parallel business behavior, although not 
itself illegal, is admissible circumstantial evidence from which the fact finder may infer agreement. . . . [U]niformity of price may 
be and has been considered some evidence tending to establish an illegal agreement.""). However, given the citation in Heritage 
of federal law to the contrary, as well as the practical result of allowing any complaint alleging mere parallel business pricing to 
proceed to discovery, such a literal interpretation cannot possibly be what the Supreme [*30]  Court intended."
1687,12," The statute refers to the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 45, which prohibits ""[u]nfair methods of competition . . . 
and unfair or deceptive acts or practices,"" and not the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1, which prohibits ""[e]very contract, 
combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade."" See Elkins v. Microsoft Corp., 174 Vt. 328, 335-37, 817 A.2d 9 (2002). 
However, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that any violation of the Sherman Act also violates the FTC Act. California Dental 
Ass'n v. Fed. Trade Comm'n, 526 U.S. 756, 762, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999) (""The FTC Act's prohibition of unfair 
competition and deceptive acts or practices, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(1), overlaps the scope of § 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, 
aimed at prohibiting restraint of trade . . . .""); Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 454, 106 S. Ct. 
2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) (""standard of 'unfairness' under the FTC Act . . . encompass[es] . . . practices that violate the 
Sherman Act and the other antitrust laws""); Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Cement Inst., 333 U.S. 683, 689-95, 68 S. Ct. 793, 92 L. Ed. 
1010, 44 F.T.C. 1460 (1948). "
1688,13," The First Circuit has defined an ""oligopolistic market"" as follows: ""An oligopoly market is one in which a few relatively large sellers account for the bulk of the output."" 2B Areeda, 
Hovenkamp, & Solow, Antitrust Law ¶ 404a, at 9 (3d ed. 2007). By contrast to a competitive market, in which no single 
producer has the power to affect the market price, in an oligopolistic market each of the major sellers can affect the market 
price by changing its output. By contrast to a monopolized market, ""no one firm can unilaterally determine market price by 
varying its output"" because rivals are large enough to affect the market price by doing the same. Id. at 10. As a result, ""the 
distinctive characteristic of oligopoly is recognized interdependence among [*32]  the leading firms: the profit-maximizing 
choice of price and output for one depends on the choices made by others."" Id. White v. R.M. Packer Co., 635 F.3d 571, 576 n.4 (1st Cir. 2011); see also E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. F.T.C., 729 F.2d 
128, 139 (2d Cir. 1984) (""The mere existence of an oligopolistic market structure in which a small group of manufacturers 
engage in consciously parallel pricing of an identical product does not violate the antitrust laws."")."
1688,14," Even under pre-Twombly antitrust law, an allegation of parallel conduct alone has never been enough to defeat a motion to 
dismiss. The Twombly dissent acknowledges this. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 580 n.6 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (""For example, 
had the amended complaint in this case alleged only parallel conduct, it would not have made the required 'showing.' Similarly, 
had the pleadings contained only an allegation of agreement, without specifying the nature or object of that agreement, they 
would have been susceptible to the charge that they did not provide sufficient notice that the defendants may answer 
intelligently. Omissions of that sort instance the type of 'bareness' with which the Federal Rules are concerned."") (citation 
omitted) (emphasis in original). There is no reason to suppose the Vermont Supreme Court would find a mere allegation of 
parallel conduct sufficient. "
1689,15," ""In a competitive industry, for example, a firm would cut its price with the hope of increasing its market share if its competitors 
were setting prices above marginal costs. Put differently, in analyzing this factor a court looks to 'evidence that the market 
behaved in a noncompetitive manner.'"" Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 361 (quoting High Fructose Corn Syrup, 295 F.3d at 655)."
1689,16," Courts and commentators have organized and described ""plus factors"" in numerous ways. For example, one commentator has 
outlined the ""chief"" plus factors as follows: • Actions contrary to each defendant's self-interest unless pursued as part of a collective plan. • Phenomena that can be explained rationally only as the result of concerted action. • Evidence that the defendants created the opportunity for regular communication. • Industry performance data, such as extraordinary profits, that suggest successful coordination. • The absence of a plausible, legitimate business rationale for suspicious conduct (such as certain communications with 
rivals) or the presentation of contrived rationales for certain conduct. W. Kovacic, et. al., Plus Factors and Agreement in Antitrust Law, 110 Mich. L. Rev. 393, 405-06 (2011). Another commentator 
has written that the plus factor ""most often considered"" by courts in determining whether parallel behavior is the result of an 
agreement is the ""business-justifications test."" M. Vaska, Conscious Parallelism and Price Fixing: Defining the Boundary, 52 U. 
Chi. L. Rev. 508, 509 (1985). Under that test, ""a price-fixing agreement may be [*37]  inferred from parallel conduct if firms 
cannot show legitimate independent business reasons for engaging in such practices."" Id. See also In re Travel Agent Comm'n 
Antitrust Litig., 583 F.3d 896, 907 (6th Cir. 2009) (""We concluded the following 'plus factors' were important when evaluating 
circumstantial evidence of concerted action: '(1) whether the defendants' actions, if taken independently, would be contrary to 
their economic self-interest; (2) whether defendants have been uniform in their actions; (3) whether defendants have exchanged 
or have had the opportunity to exchange information relative to the alleged conspiracy; and (4) whether defendants have a 
common motive to conspire. Ordinarily, an affirmative answer to the first of these factors will consistently tend to exclude the 
likelihood of independent conduct.'"") (quoting Re/Max Int'l, Inc. v. Realty One, Inc., 173 F.3d 995, 1009 (6th Cir. 1999)); E.I. du 
Pont de Nemours & Co. v. F.T.C., 729 F.2d 128, 140 n.10 (2d Cir. 1984) (""The 'plus factor' may be conduct that is contrary to the "
1690,," defendants' independent self-interest, the presence or absence of a strong motive on a defendants' part to enter an alleged 
conspiracy, or the artificial standardization of products . . . ."") (internal citations omitted)."
1690,17," Champlain Oil also points out that defendants are only four of the six major gas wholesalers in the class area. The complaint 
does not explain why the other two wholesalers did not take market share by pricing at allegedly competitive levels. This, 
Champlain Oil contends, demonstrates that higher prices are more likely explained by conscious parallelism [*41]  rather than a 
conspiracy to fix prices. However, this fact does not necessarily negate an inference of a price-fixing agreement. It is entirely "
1691,," possible that the two non-party wholesalers and/or those stations they supply independently imitated defendants' allegedly fixed 
prices. In any event, as the court has already stated, the fact of a concentrated market does not by itself suggest a price-fixing 
conspiracy."
1691,18," Defendants argue that plaintiffs have not alleged that Rutland is an appropriate comparable market. Though plaintiffs' attorney 
stated [*42]  at oral argument that both the class area and Rutland County are oligopolistic markets and insisted that plaintiffs 
had made that specific allegation in their complaint, see Transcript at 38:4-19, the complaint does not contain such a specific 
allegation. The closest the complaint comes to alleging that Rutland is a comparable market is in Paragraph 64 (""Profit margins 
realized by Defendants in the Class Area exceeded the margins realized by comparable gas stations outside of the Class Area 
within comparative markets in the State of Vermont and throughout the United States.""), Paragraph 68 (""There is little 
justification for the price differential for gasoline between the Class Area and the City of Rutland. Major costs . . . vary little or not 
at all. To the extent some costs in Rutland are lower . . ., those difference cannot explain the price differential.) and in Paragraph 
70 (""There is no competitive market explanation for the magnitude and substantial duration of the retail price differentials 
between Chittenden and Rutland during periods of declining costs.""). However, this does not doom plaintiffs' complaint. There is 
a clear implication in the complaint of an apples-to-apples [*43]  comparison. Moreover, the complaint alleges that the class area 
has higher prices than not only Rutland, but other areas of Vermont, the Northeast, and the country."
1691,19," With regard to parallel pricing behavior, defendants argue that the FTC document relied upon by plaintiffs in their complaint 
undercuts their allegations. Specifically, R.L. Vallee argues that the FTC data does not show excessive pricing or profit-taking, 
but instead shows that prices were within the predicted range for all but a few weeks. See Ex. A to R.L.'s Vallee's Reply. Indeed, 
the FTC data purportedly shows that from the period between January 2010 and June 2012, gas prices in Burlington, Vermont 
were within the ""expected range"" except for the last four weeks. See id. However, this is not the only allegation of parallel pricing 
behavior offered by plaintiffs. They allege unreasonably high retail prices, wholesale prices, and profits throughout the class 
period. Presumably, they will offer evidence supporting those allegations during discovery. The FTC chart covers only part of the 
class period. Furthermore, it is unclear from the chart exactly how the FTC determined the ""expected range."" The FTC chart 
does not meaningfully [*44]  undermine plaintiffs' allegations."
1691,20," As Judge Posner further explained, ""[t]his is anomalous behavior because falling costs increase a seller's profit margin at the 
existing price, motivating him, in the absence of agreement, to reduce his price slightly in order to take business from his 
competitors, and certainly not to increase his price."" [*45]  Text Messaging, 630 F.3d at 628. "
1692,21," R.L. Vallee argues that whether the legislative testimony is admissible as evidence of intent to conceal a conspiracy depends 
upon some initial pleading of facts to show the testimony's falsity, which it claims plaintiffs have not done. See R.L. Vallee's 
Reply at 18. However, plaintiffs have pled that, for [*49]  various reasons, defendants' testimony does not provide an explanation 
for the high gas prices, which was the purpose of the legislative hearings. See Compl. ¶¶ 80-87. Additionally, plaintiffs' pleading 
of excessive profits undermines defendants' statement that they were losing money. Id. ¶ 63. The court deems that sufficient. "
1693,22," The court emphasizes that it is not placing a burden on defendants to produce an explanation for parallel pricing at the 
pleading stage. Rather, the court merely recognizes, as other courts have, that the existence or absence of an obvious 
alternative explanation for the parallelism that suggests independent conduct rather than an illegal agreement is an important 
factor. See In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 322-23 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567) 
(""allegations of conspiracy are deficient if there are 'obvious alternative explanation[s]' for the facts alleged""); In re Travel Agent 
Comm'n Antitrust Litig. (""Tam Travel""), 583 F.3d 896, 908-09 (6th Cir. 2009) (airlines' historical failures at independently cutting 
commission rates without prior agreements with other airlines did not suggest collusion, because defendants offered a 
""reasonable, alternative explanation"": each airline could have reasonably calculated that a successful commission cut would 
yield greater net revenue); LaFlamme v. Societe Air France, 702 F. Supp. 2d 136, 151-52 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (""rapidly rising jet fuel 
prices"" provided an obvious independent explanation for the alleged parallel [*51]  behavior); In re Graphics Processing Units 
Antitrust Litigation, 527 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1022 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (allegations of parallel conduct were equally consistent with 
conspiracy and lawful conduct where certain characteristic of chip industry provided ""independent innocent explanation"" for 
conduct); Cf. Interstate Circuit v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 224, 59 S. Ct. 467, 83 L. Ed. 610 (1939) (defendant's letter 
provided evidence of conspiracy, particularly because defendants could offer no alternative reason for parallel pricing demands). "
1694,23," Plaintiffs allege one other example involving a new filling station in Plainfield, outside of the class area. Id. ¶ 53. Because it is 
outside of the class area, it has no relevance to an alleged price-fixing conspiracy inside the class area. "
1695,24," The complaint provided: Providence combined and/or conspired with the Miller & Smith defendants, Gordon V. Smith, Calloway, Conner, Jack B. 
Conner Associates, Inc. and others to restrain trade unreasonably in the real estate development business in the 
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area by combining and/or conspiring to deprive the Pattersons of The Property, cause The 
Property to be sold in foreclosure at a price that would leave the Pattersons with no assets, and otherwise to drive them 
and Estate Construction out of the real [*57]  estate development business in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. The 
combination and/or conspiracy produced adverse, anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic 
market. The objects and conduct of the combination and/or conspiracy were illegal. Estate Constr., 14 F.3d at 221 n.15."
1695,25, The relevant paragraphs of the complaint in Lombard's provide:
1695,10," . Upon information and belief, PRINCE, together with PRINCE dealers and others at this time unknown to LOMBARD'S, 
conspired to maintain the resale prices of the ""Prince Precision Graphite,"" [*58]  the ""Prince J/R Pro"" and the ""Prince 
Magnesium Pro"" tennis racquets and terminate price-cutters. In furtherance of that conspiracy, and in response to dealer 
complaints, PRINCE has prevented LOMBARD'S from making wholesale and mail order sales of the three (3) new tennis 
racquets by refusing to fill LOMBARD'S purchase orders for these new tennis racquets."
1695,11," . Upon information and belief, PRINCE, together and with PRINCE dealers and others at this time unknown to 
LOMBARD'S, have attempted, and are now attempting, to prevent LOMBARD'S from making wholesale and mail order 
sales of the ""Prince Precision Graphite,"" the ""Prince J/R Pro"" and the ""Prince Magnesium Pro"" tennis racquets not to 
achieve any legitimate business objectives, but for the sole purpose of unlawfully preventing LOMBARD'S from engaging in 
intrabrand price competition with other dealers in those same tennis racquets. Lombard's, 753 F.2d at 975. "
1696,26," As one treatise notes, Twombly cannot mean ""that the plaintiff must disprove all nonconspiratorial explanations for the 
defendants' conduct,"" even at the summary judgment stage. P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Fundamentals of Antitrust Law §
