4,1," The class definition in plaintiffs' motion indicates the class period is October 10, 2010, through December 31, 2014. As 
defendants point out, Business and Professions Code section 25600.3, which took effect on January 1, 2015, now prohibits the 
use of coupons for beer. Plaintiffs do not appear to contend defendants have provided coupons to, or reimbursed retailers for, 
coupons after that date. "
5,2, All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated. 
9,3," Plaintiffs' class definition includes retail business establishments in Fresno and Madera Counties that plaintiffs refer to generally 
as convenience stores. "
13,4," We note that only one of the seven declarations cited by the trial court in support of these statements was the declaration of a 
named plaintiff. The others were declarations of putative class members. "
15,5," ""Case law imposes fiduciary duties on the trial courts, class counsel, and class representatives, who must ensure the action 
proceeds in the class members' best interest."" (Hernandez v. Restoration Hardware, Inc. (2018) 4 Cal.5th 260, 266, 228 Cal. 
Rptr. 3d 106, 409 P.3d 281.) "
30,1," Plaintiff appears to argue that Circuit City was wrongly decided, and the Supreme Court improperly restricted the residual 
clause of Section 1 in Circuit City. Dkt. No. 44 at 13-14. HN8[
] This Court, however, is bound by the decisions of the Supreme 
Court. See Hoeffner v. D'Amato, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98903, 2022 WL 1912942, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. June 2, 2022). "
32,2," A case presently before the Second Circuit raises this issue and is scheduled for argument on February 6, 2023. Aleksanian v. 
Uber Technologies Inc., 22-98 (2d Cir.)."
32,3," For purposes of this motion, neither side argues that there is a material difference between a Lyft driver and an Uber driver."
32,4," Because the Court concludes that Uber drivers are not transportation workers engaged in interstate commerce under Section 
1, the Court does not address Uber's argument that Plaintiff may not rely on the exclusionary clause in Section 1 of the FAA 
because the 2020 PAA is not a ""contract of employment,"" but instead a licensing agreement. Dkt. No. 22-1 at 16. The Court, 
however, is skeptical of this argument as the Supreme Court has defined the term ""contracts of employment"" broadly. See New 
Prime Inc., 139 S. Ct. at 541 (""Congress used the term 'contracts of employment' in a broad sense to capture any contract for 
the performance of work by workers."" (quoting 9 U.S.C. ยง 1)). Moreover, Uber fails to identify any court that has agreed with this 
argument. The Court previously rejected Uber's argument that the Section 1 exemption does not apply because Plaintiff transports people, 
not goods, in its August 11, 2021 Opinion and Order. Dkt. No. 30 at 3 (""The Section 1 exemption is not limited to classes of 
workers who transport goods in interstate commerce, but also extends to the transportation of passengers as well as physical 
goods."" (cleaned up)). "
33,5," This Court declines to address a ""challenging side question that no court seems to have grappled with to date"" as to whether 
the relevant class for purposes of considering the exemption under the FAA is Uber drivers nationwide or rideshare drivers. 
Osvatics, 535 F. Supp. 3d at 16 n.8. Neither of the parties argue in favor of the latter definition of the class or argue that there is 
a meaningful difference among rideshare companies that would impact the analysis if the Court were to adopt the latter definition 
of the class for purposes of the Section 1 exemption. Thus, the Court declines to resolve this issue. "
39,6," Because the Court finds that Plaintiff must arbitrate his dispute under the FAA, the Court does not address Defendant's 
alternate argument that he is compelled to arbitrate his claims under New York law. Dkt. No. 43 at 9. "
41,1," Th Ninth Circuit has noted that a court may take judicial notice of its own records. United States v. Author Servs., 804 F.2d 
1520, 1523 (9th Cir. 1986). However, other courts have found that they may consider filings in their own docket of this case 
without the necessity of taking judicial notice. Jones v. County of San Bernardino, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141961, *6 (C.D. Cal. 
May 12, 2022); Harris v. County of Sacramento, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133935, *7 n.3 (E.D. Cal. Aug. 7, 2018). Through both 
branches of authority, the Court will consider the Vehicle's sales contract. "
42,2," The California Supreme Court has granted review in Rodriguez, but has ordered that Rodriguez may be cited as persuasive 
authority. See Rodriguez v. FCA US, LLC, 295 Cal. Rptr. 3d 351, 512 P.3d 654 (2022). "
45,3," MBU argues that Barboza is not entitled to equitable relief under the UCL. Because the Court finds that no plausible UCL 
claims are stated, the Court will not address Barboza's claims for equitable relief at this time. "
