23,1," Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant falsely represented to the Superior Court that UF EVA was a protected trade secret 
when, in reality, it knew that one of its manufacturers had been publicly displaying and marketing UF EVA overseas. Plaintiff 
raised these concerns before the Superior Court in July 2010, and the court flatly rejected them, stating that Plaintiff was simply 
attempting ""to relitigate before this court that which this court has already decided"" and ""to mount yet another legal attack on the 
court's findings and rulings."" (Dkt. No. 17, Ex. M)."
23,2," The email advises a customer not to consider a product ""made with STR's stolen IP"" and immediately thereafter cautions the 
customer that ""I can only say that we have good cause to believe that Jim and his new company, JPS, misappropriated our "
24,," technology, as we have not yet proven that in a courtroom."" (Dkt. No. 26, Ex. E.) This statement cannot form the basis for a 
claim under the Lanham Act. "
28,1," The Complaint erroneously refers to ""§ 1985(c)"" as opposed to ""§ 1985(3)."" Compl. at 25. Plaintiff acknowledges this obvious 
error in her opposition brief. Pl.'s Opp'n at 7. "
30,2," Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides, in relevant part, that, ""Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any 
combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony...."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
31,3," Plaintiff does not dispute her failure to allege state action, but contends that under Scott, state action is not required to state a 
claim under § 1985(3). Pl.'s Opp'n at 10-11. This is a misinterpretation of Scott, which holds that state action may be required 
depending on the nature of the underlying right being asserted. See Scott, 463 U.S. at 833. "
33,4," The entirely speculative nature of her defamation claim is underscored by Plaintiff in her opposition, wherein  [*29] she argues 
as follow: ""Provided that Registrar Defendant BENDER did not take it upon himself to invent the grades Plaintiff received in 
those courses after Winter quarter, or to change them unilaterally, it is possible or even likely that Defendants GEISSBERGER, 
LABARRE, and GIUSTI published to [Bender] that Plaintiff either failed or did not take those courses."" Pl.'s Opp'n at 18. "
34,5," In  [*35] their moving papers, Defendants argued that a claim for the negligent provision of educational services is not 
actionable under California law. In her opposition, Plaintiff responded that such rule applied only to public, not private, 
educational institutions, Defendants fail to respond to this purported distinction in their reply, and instead, propose that Plaintiff 
amend her complaint to direct her negligence claim against the University only. It thus appears that Defendants have abandoned 
the argument presented in their moving papers. "
46,1," Abbott's comparison of the price of daily doses of Norvir and Kaletra and ""average daily boosted doses"" of other PIs, such as 
Reyataz, Lexiva and Prezista,  [**7] is misleading. See Calamari Decl. ¶ 44 and tbl.1. What is relevant is the cost of therapies 
based on Reyataz, Lexiva and Prezista, not these drugs' individual prices. For instance, in December, 2003, Abbott compares 
the price of Reyataz, which was $22.08, to the price of Kaletra, which was $18.78. This comparison suggests that a Reyataz-
based therapy cost eighteen percent more than one based on Kaletra. However, the price of Reyataz does not include the price 
of Norvir, which Abbott acknowledges is required to be taken if Reyataz serves as a boosted PI. With Norvir's price included, the 
cost of a Reyataz-based therapy, which required only 100 milligrams of Norvir, jumps to $30.65, or sixty-three percent above the 
cost to take Kaletra. The increase in the price of a Lexiva-based therapy, which required 200 milligrams of Norvir, was all the 
more substantial. "
48,2," HN12[
] Courts have used the terms ""monopoly power"" and ""market power"" interchangeably. See, e.g., Cost Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Wash. Natural Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 950 n.15 (9th Cir. 1996). However, monopoly power is best understood to be the 
substantial degree of market power necessary to support liability under Section 2. See Eastman Kodak Co., 504 U.S. at 481 
(""Monopoly power under § 2 requires, of course, something greater than market power under § 1.""); Cal. ex rel. Brown v. 
Safeway, Inc., 615 F.3d 1171, 1187 n.6 (9th Cir. 2010); see also 3B P. Areeda, H. Hovenkamp & J. Solow, Antitrust Law ¶ 801, 
at 382 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter, Areeda & Hovenkamp). In this Order,  [**17] the Court uses the term ""monopoly power"" to 
refer to substantial market power. "
49,3," Plaintiffs nevertheless continue to argue that evidence of restricted output is not required because raising prices necessarily 
depresses sales. This is incorrect. Take for example a market in which demand outstrips supply. In such a hypothetical market, 
a firm could raise prices — up to a certain point — without necessarily causing a commensurate reduction in sales. In re ATM 
Fee Antitrust Litigation, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61160, 2010 WL 2557519 (N.D. Cal.), is both factually and procedurally 
distinguishable. There, the plaintiffs alleged that several banks and an ATM network exercised monopoly power in the ""ATM 
Networks"" market by charging supracompetitive ATM fees over two decades. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61160, [WL] at *9-*10. They 
did not expressly plead restricted output. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61160, [WL] at *10. The court stated that this did not warrant 
dismissal of their complaint, finding that ""because price and output are inversely correlated, the fact that Star, the market leader, 
 [**20] has charged supracompetitive interchange fees for two decades implies that marketwide output . . . has been lower than 
it would have been had Star charged a competitive interchange fee."" Id. Plaintiffs do not allege that Abbott priced Kaletra above 
a competitive level for an extended period of time, a factor the ATM Fee court emphasized in its ruling. Furthermore, to oppose a 
summary judgment motion, Plaintiffs are required to proffer evidence supporting a reasonable inference of restricted output. "
51,4," The variation arises from whether ritonavir, as provided in Norvir or as a component of Kaletra, should be considered as part of 
Abbott's share of the boosted market. Direct Purchasers' expert, Dr. Singer, includes ritanovir in his calculation, whereas GSK's 
expert, Dr. Noll, does not. If ritanovir is included, Abbott's market share was seventy-five percent in Q3 2007; if it is excluded, 
Abbott's share is below fifty percent. "
52,5," Abbott does not contend that, to seek liability under the ""monopoly leveraging plus"" and Conwood theories, Direct Purchasers 
must amend their complaints. "
55,6," Even if a unilateral change in a cooperative venture is required, Plaintiffs provide evidence of such a change. Abbott does not 
dispute that, prior to the Norvir price hike, it participated in co-marketing agreements with its competitors and followed a practice 
of increasing Norvir's price based on the rate of inflation. Thus, a jury could view Abbott as having unilaterally changed the 
nature of its cooperative ventures with its competitors. "
56,7," In its original opposition, GSK claimed that Abbott's publication of misleading price comparisons is analogous to the false 
information in Conwood. However, in its supplemental opposition, GSK clarified that its Conwood theory is based solely on the 
announcement and timing of the Norvir price increase. "
58,8," The parties' agreement, which has been filed under seal, contains a choice-of-law provision that designates New York law as 
controlling. Calamari Decl., Ex. 23 ¶ 11.4. "
60,9," Abbott does not appear to contest that GSK could recover monies it paid under the terms of the Norvir license. Abbott appears 
to seek only summary adjudication that GSK cannot recover the other, more substantial, form of consideration. "
61,10," The parties do not dispute that Abbott would face liability under the UDTPA for monopolization and attempted monopolization 
if and only if GSK prevailed on its Section 2 claim. See generally S.B. 843, 1996 Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (N.C. 1996) 
(indicating that § 75-2.1 was intended to ensure UDTPA is consistent with federal antitrust laws). "
69,1," Inexplicably, the dissent also states that plaintiff asserts that by concentrating claims-handling responsibility in Equitas, 
""competition in the [non-life retrocessional reinsurance] market [was affected] on a prospective basis"" (emphasis added). In fact, 
however, plaintiff asserts that an essential attribute of the alleged scheme is that on a prospective basis the syndicates would 
compete in that market just as they historically had, freely and without restraint. "
70,2," Because plaintiff apparently has been in runoff at all relevant times since Equitas was established, its claims under pre-1993 
business arguably would have been subjected to the same unfavorable treatment even if Equitas had not been established. Its 
retrocessionaires, after all, would not have been motivated by competitive considerations to accord it the favorable treatment 
they accorded to retrocedents  [***14] who were or might be purchasing coverage on an ongoing basis. Equitas does not make 
this causality argument, however, and it could not in any event be resolved on the pleadings. "
71,3," As plaintiff also argues, HN5[
] market power need not be pleaded where actual adverse effects on competition are alleged 
(see FTC v Indiana Fed. of Dentists, 476 US 447, 460-461, 106 S Ct 2009, 90 L Ed 2d 445 [1986] [""Since the purpose of … 
inquiries into market definition and market power is to determine whether an arrangement has the potential for genuine adverse 
effects on competition, proof of actual detrimental effects … can obviate the need for an inquiry into market power, which is but a 
surrogate for detrimental effects"" (internal quotation marks omitted)]). Accordingly, plaintiff also argues that a ""naked agreement 
among the Names to coordinate claims handling of pre-1993 claims so as to reduce payment on those claims, followed by 
coordinated unreasonable claims handling[,] [is] subject to 'quick look' condemnation."" Given the conclusion that the allegations 
of market power  [***17] are sufficient, we need not address plaintiff's argument that it has adequately pleaded an unreasonable 
restraint of trade independent of the existence of market power. Nor need we address the dispute arising from that argument 
over whether ""quick look"" analysis is precluded by Texaco, Inc. v Dagher (547 U.S. 1, 126 S Ct 1276, 164 L Ed 2d 1 [2006])."
71,4," In the typical case, that is surely the appropriate definition of market power. As the unreasonable restraint alleged in this case 
has nothing to do with concerted action raising the price for purchasers, it is not obvious that whether an antitrust violation can 
be established should depend on whether the Names could do what they did not try to do, significantly raise the price above the 
competitive level without losing all their business. The parties appear to agree, however, that to the extent plaintiff relies on 
market power, it must show market power in this sense. Presumably, such a showing would tend to satisfy the requirement 
under the rule of reason test of ""an actual adverse effect on competition as a whole in the relevant market"" (Capital Imaging 
Assoc., P.C. v Mohawk Val. Med. Assoc., Inc., 996 F2d 537 [2d Cir 1993], cert denied 510 US 947, 114 S Ct 388, 126 L Ed 2d 
337 [1993] [emphasis omitted]). At one point in its brief, however, Equitas suggests that the appropriate market power 
 [***20] show-ing in this case ""would be the ability to drive down payments to reinsurers below the payments that would prevail in 
a competitive market"" (internal quotation marks omitted). Of course, that is precisely what plaintiff alleges that Equitas was able 
to do with respect to pre-1993 business. "
74,1," The Donnelly Act, or ""Little Sherman Act,"" should generally be construed in light of federal precedent and given a different 
interpretation only where state policy, differences in the statutory language or the legislative history justify such a result (see 
Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v Abrams, 71 NY2d 327, 335, 520 NE2d 535, 525 NYS2d 816 [1988] [citations omitted]). "
75,2," The allegations found wanting in these cases are virtually indistinguishable from the allegations in the amended complaint. For 
example, in Intel, the plaintiff alleged that ""[i]n maintaining its monopoly by unlawfully denying rivals a competitive opportunity to achieve minimum levels of efficient 
scale, Intel must necessarily exclude them from the product market worldwide. As the domestic U.S. market is but an 
integral part of the world market, successful monopolization of the U.S. market is dependent on world market exclusion, lest 
foreign sales vitalize a rival's U.S. competitive potential."" (452 F Supp 2d at 560.) The court rejected these allegations, reasoning ""[plaintiff] places great weight on its allegations that it is an American company 
engaged in a world-wide market; however, such allegations do not create jurisdiction without substantial, direct effects on the 
domestic market."" (Id. at 561.) "
78,1," Pollard also claims that Oberthur prosecuted patent applications for the invention that is the subject of the '991 patent, with the 
Canadian and European Patent Offices. Scientific Games opposed these applications on the basis of McMurry's opinion that the 
invention is obvious and unpatentable. These allegations are not in the Complaint and are not considered in deciding the Motion 
to Dismiss."
78,2," Plaintiff has named Scientific Games International, Inc., Scientific Games Corp., and Oberthur Gaming Technologies, Inc. as 
Defendants in this case. The Complaint generally asserts an antitrust claim against all of the Defendants without specifically 
identifying the conduct in which each Defendant has engaged. While this pleading strategy presents its own pleading issues, for 
the purposes of this Order the Court generally will refer to the Defendants collectively as ""Scientific Games"" unless the Court 
refers to specific conduct asserting a specific Defendant in which case that Defendant will be identified."
78,3," The rights are not indentified. Pollard does not allege whether any or all of such ""certain rights"" were transferred to any other 
company, including Defendant Scientific Games Corporation. "
79,4, Pollard uses this term as a defined term for secure instant-win scratch-off lottery tickets.
79,5," The Supreme Court explicitly rejected its earlier formulation for the Rule 12(b)(6) pleading standard: ""'[T]he accepted rule [is] 
that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no 
set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.'"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555 (quoting Conley v. Gibson, 355 
U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). The Court decided that ""this famous observation has earned its retirement."" 
Id. at 563. "
80,6," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires the Plaintiff to state ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the 
pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). In Twombly, the Supreme Court recognized the liberal minimal standards 
imposed by Federal Rule 8(a)(2) but also acknowledged that ""[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above 
the speculative level . . . ."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. "
81,7," Pollard alleges that Federal Circuit authority controls here. The Federal Circuit is, of course, obligated to apply Eleventh Circuit 
precedent in evaluating antitrust claims alleged in our circuit. Loctite Corp. v. Ultraseal Ltd., 781 F.2d 861, 875 (Fed. Cir. 1985). "
82,8," The only lottery Pollard alleges has engaged in a contract with this royalty payment term is the New York lottery. Pollard 
conclusorily alleges that it ""believes that other lottery customers also have been required to pay such a fee to Scientific Games."""
82,9," Pollard alleges that by ""mid-2002, if not sooner, Scientific Games concluded, believed and/or knew that the '991 patent was 
invalid."" Pollard does not allege the '991 patent was fraudulently obtained and does not allege the patent was unenforceable, 
invalid or wrongfully asserted by any person prior to mid-2002. Rather, Pollard claims that at a point in mid-2002 Scientific 
Games reached a conclusion, or formed a belief or otherwise knew about the validity of the '991 patent and thus committed an 
antitrust violation in asserting the patent in negotiations with the New York and certain other unidentified state lotteries, even if a 
court later decided that Scientific Games conclusion, belief or knowledge was wrong. "
83,10," The Court observes that the Valley Drug court also stated: ""[w]e note further that some lower courts have extended Walker 
Process to permit antitrust claims against patentees for the anticompetitive effects of infringement lawsuits when the antitrust 
claimant proves that the patentee knew that the patent was invalid, Handgards, 601 F.2d at 994-96, or knew that the patent was 
not infringed, Loctite Corp. v. Ultraseal Ltd., 781 F.2d 861, 876-77 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (case history omitted). To the extent that the 
appellees have demonstrated nothing more than subsequent invalidity, we hold that this alone is insufficient to render the 
patent's potential exclusionary effects irrelevant to the antitrust analysis."" 344 F.3d at 1309. To the extent our circuit court might 
consider a cause of action for bad faith assertion of a patent to demand a license, this observation in Valley Drug does not 
support a cause of action in the present circumstances, where the patent, if assessed at all, is asserted against someone other 
than the plaintiff."
83,11," Pollard cites our circuit's opinion in Schering-Plough Corp. v. FTC, 402 F.3d 1056 (11th Cir. 2005) to support its bad faith 
assertion of an invalid patent license demand theory. In Schering-Pough the Eleventh Circuit stated that a patent ""does not give 
the patentee any exemption from the provisions of the Sherman Act beyond the limits of the patent monopoly."" (citing United 
States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 196-97, 83 S. Ct. 1773, 10 L. Ed. 2d 823, 1963 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 547 (1963)). Our 
circuit noted further: ""If the challenged activity simply serves as a device to circumvent antitrust law, then that activity is 
susceptible to an antitrust suit."" Schering-Plough, 402 F.3d at 1067 (citing Asahi Glass Co., v. Pentech Pharms., Inc., 289 F. 
Supp. 2d 986, 991 (N.D. Ill. 2003) (Posner, J.)). The Schering-Pough court noted an example offered by Judge Posner in Asahi 
v. Pentech regarding activity that transcends the confines of the patent and should be subject to antitrust law: Suppose a seller obtains a patent that it knows is almost certainly invalid (that is, almost certain not to survive a judicial 
challenge), sues its competitors, and settles the suit by licensing them to use its patent in exchange for their agreeing not to 
sell the patented product for less than the price specified in the license. In such a case, the patent, the suit, and the 
settlement would be devices-masks-for fixing prices, in violation of antitrust law. Id. (quoting Asahi, 289 F. Supp. 2d at 991). Even the hypothetical noted by Judge Posner is consistent with the Walker Process 
requirement that assertion of a patent may run afoul of the antitrust laws when action to enforce an invalid patent occurs and is "
84,," the foundational basis for the later demand for a license. A licensing fee to practice an invalid patent that is not tied to litigation or 
a threat of litigation is not enough to implicate the prohibitions of Section 2 the Sherman Act."
84,12," Jacobs [*21]  states our circuit's position regarding the sufficiency of relevant product and geographic markets to meet 
pleading requirements of Twombly in an antitrust case. Although Jacobs was a Section 1 case, its market allegation discussion 
applies also to cases brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fl., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc's, 
Inc., 376 F.3d 1065, 1074 (11th Cir. 2004)."
84,13," The Court notes that all but seven states in the United States have lotteries, many, if not most, of which offer scratch-off 
games. ""Lotteries in the United States,"" (Jan 3, 2011),Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lotteries_in_the_United_States 
Pollard has noted only six states in which it alleged unlawful conduct, constituting only about 14% of the states that have 
lotteries. If Pollard contends these six states constitute some sort of relevant submarket, the scant information alleged is hardly 
enough to meet the pleading requirement of Twombly. Jacobs, 626 F.3d 1327, 2010 WL 4880864 at *5. The Court also notes 
that Pollard does not respond, in its opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, to Defendants' claim that the Complaint fails 
adequately to allege relevant product or geographic markets. "
85,14," The Complaint does not ever define which of the Defendants' are included when it uses the names ""Scientific Games"" in the 
Complaint."
85,15," Pollard submitted a declaration indicating that Defendants hold 76% of the relevant market, Pollard holds 21% and GTECH 
holds 3%. Defendants object to the consideration of these facts because they were not alleged in the Complaint. The Court's 
evaluation in this matter is limited to the allegations in the Complaint."
85,16," The Court will allow Plaintiff to file an Amended Complaint. The Court allows only amendments to Pollard's antitrust claim. If 
an amendment is filed, Pollard shall also file a red-lined copy of the Amended Complaint so that the Court and Defendants' can 
readily identify the amendment offered. "
86,17," Pollard does not allege specific facts regarding any other state, including the six unidentified states mentioned in the 
Complaint, or the conduct of any other lottery as it impacts Pollard."
86,18," The parties spend a significant portion of their briefs discussing the implications of several purported licensing agreements 
between Pollard and Scientific Games regarding the '991 patent. However, because Pollard's complaint makes no reference to 
these agreements, the Court does not consider them in deciding Scientific Games' Motion to Dismiss. MedImmune, 549 U.S. at 
121; Brooks v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 116 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 1997) (""[T]he analysis of a 12(b)(6) motion is limited 
primarily to the face of the complaint and attachments thereto."")."
86,19," The facts in this case are similar to Arris Group, Inc. v. British Telecommunications, PLC, 694 F. Supp. 2d 1330 (N.D. Ga. 
2010). Plaintiff Arris, a supplier of telecommunications equipment, provided equipment to its customer Cable One. Id. at 1331. 
Defendant British Telecommunications (""BT"") contacted Cable One claiming Cable One had infringed certain of BT's patents 
and wanted Cable One to enter into a license agreement to license its patented technology. Id. BT did not allege that plaintiff 
Arris had infringed its patent. Id. at 1331-32. "
87,," Arris filed a declaratory judgment action against BT seeking a declaration that Arris had not and does not infringe BT's patents 
and a declaration that BT's patents were invalid. Id. at 1332. BT moved to dismiss on the grounds that the court did not have 
subject matter over the declaratory judgment. Id. The court held that there was no legal relationship between Arris and BT, that 
BT had not alleged infringement against Arris, and thus there was no dispute over which the court had subject matter jurisdiction 
in a declaratory judgment action. Id.; see Fujitsu Ltd. v. Nanya Tech. Corp., No. C 06613 CW, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63830, 
2008 WL 3539503 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2008) (finding no jurisdiction over declaratory judgment action brought by manufacturer 
against patentee where manufacturer had sold devices to a customer and patentee had filed infringement action against 
customer but not against manufacturer)."
87,20," Arrowhead, of little relevance here, was decided under the Federal Circuit's ""reasonable apprehension"" of suit standard that 
was overruled by the Supreme Court in MedImmune. SanDisk Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 480 F.3d 1372, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 
2007)."
87,21," That a declaration by this Court that the '991 patent is invalid may not impact the New York state lottery's agreement to pay 
Pollard for its products illustrates that a declaratory judgment action is not appropriate where there is no dispute between a 
plaintiff and a patentee. "
91,1," Adobe's original claimed named only Kornrumpf as a Defendant. However, in November, 2010, Adobe filed an amended 
complaint naming Hoops as a Defendant, along with a stipulation deeming the amended complaint to be filed on June 24, 2010. 
(Docket No. 33.) "
92,2," In the stipulation noted above, the parties deemed Hoops and Kornrumpf's amended answer to be filed on September 3, 2010. 
(Docket No. 33.)"
92,3," For brevity, the Court hereinafter collectively refers to Hoops's counterclaims against Adobe and claims against third-party 
Defendant SIIA as ""claims."" "
93,4," However,  [**8] courts have entertained declaratory relief claims for copyright misuse in cases where a copyright holder has not 
asserted claims of copyright infringement. See, e.g., Practice Mgmt., 121 F.3d at 520-21; Open Source Yoga Unity v. 
Choudhury, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10440, 2005 WL 756558 (N.D. Cal.). Such cases are distinguishable because, here, Adobe 
has sued for copyright infringement. "
97,1,"  The Panel has not attempted to identify all marketing practices in which either party might engage that could potentially 
violate the antitrust laws, such as non-price predatory conduct. The proposed Order confines itself to settling standards for 
 [*3] determining if unlawful bundling or tying has occurred. "
99,2,"  The panel has not been asked to address what are sometimes termed ""loyalty"" or ""market share"" discounts and does not 
do so in the proposed Order. "
104,1," Warner-Lambert does not oppose the Court's consideration of Dr. French's merits report, (9/13/10 Hearing Tr. 34), and, in light 
of the Third Circuit's directives in In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305 (3d Cir. 2008), the Court has determined 
that it is appropriate to consider the report at this stage, only as it related to the certification of a class."
104,2," The  [*4] facts and allegations underlying this consolidated action were discussed extensively in this Court's Opinion dated 
August 27, 2009 denying Warner-Lambert's motion to dismiss. In re Neurontin Antitrust Litig., No. 02-1390, 2009 U.S. Dist. "
105,," LEXIS 77475 (D.N.J. Aug. 27, 2009). The Court presumes familiarity with that Opinion, as well as with the abbreviations and 
acronyms used therein."
105,3," Warner-Lambert Company LLC, formerly Warner-Lambert Company, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. on or 
about June 19, 2000."
105,4," After briefing on their Motion for Class Certification was complete, Plaintiffs requested the right to amend the class definition 
proposed therein. [Docket #301]. Specifically, Plaintiffs proposed that the starting date for the class period be revised from July 
16, 2000 to December 11, 2002, and the ending date be revised from September 25, 2009 to August 31, 2008, so to conform to 
the record evidence as it developed after briefing was complete. Warner-Lambert does not oppose this request. [9/13/10 
Hearing Tr. 24.] Because ""Plaintiffs are entitled  [*7] to define the class period as broadly as their evidence supports,"" In re 
Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 240 F.R.D. 163, 177 (E.D. Pa. 2007), rev'd on other grounds, 552 F.3d 305 (3d Cir. 2008), for 
purposes of this Motion, the Court will consider Plaintiffs' amended class definition. See also 7 NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 
22:76 (4th ed.) (""Courts have either redefined the classes themselves or permitted the plaintiffs to redefine the classes."")."
105,5," By Order dated March 14, 2003 [Docket #27], this Court appointed interim Liaison Counsel, Co-Lead Counsel, and an 
Executive Committee (""Interim Class Counsel""). Plaintiffs are seeking to have these same firms, in the same leadership 
structure, appointed as Class Counsel under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g). Plaintiffs also seek the appointment of 
Berger & Montague, P.C. as additional Class Counsel. "
107,6," Notably, courts in analogous cases - similarly alleging that a drug manufacturer engaged in anticompetitive conduct to prevent 
generic drugs from entering the market - certified classes similar in size and composition to the one proposed here. See In re 
Buspirone Patent & Antitrust Litig., 210 F.R.D. 43, 57 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (certifying class of approximately 100 direct purchasers in 
delayed generic entry case); In re Nifedipine Antitrust Litig., 246 F.R.D. 365, 368-69 (D.D.C. 2007) (certifying class of 
approximately 85 direct purchasers in delayed generic entry case); In re K-Dur Antitrust Litig., No. 01-1652, 2008 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 118396, 2008 WL 2699390, at *4 (D.N.J. Apr. 14, 2008) (certifying class of approximately 45 direct purchasers in delayed 
generic entry case); Meijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Co. III, 246 F.R.D. 293, 300 (D.D.C. 2007) (certifying class of 
approximately 30 direct purchasers in delayed generic entry case). Warner-Lambert has argued that the decisions in these similar delayed generic entry cases have limited precedential value, as 
they precede the Third Circuit's decision in Hydrogen Peroxide. The Court has conducted  [*12] a thorough, independent 
analysis of the facts and holdings of these analogous cases. While many recite standards that Hydrogen Peroxide has since 
clarified, the courts nonetheless conducted the ""rigorous analysis"" of the proofs that Hydrogen Peroxide demands. In this way, 
these cases remain persuasive authority, and the Court has considered them as such."
107,7," This conclusion is consistent with the findings of other courts in analogous delayed generic entry cases. See Meijer, 246 F.R.D. 
at 300 (""[Plaintiffs'] claims raise numerous common issues of fact and law, including . . . whether Defendants' activities have 
substantially affected interstate commerce . . . whether, and to what extent, Defendants' conduct caused direct purchasers to 
pay more for Ovcon 35 Products than they would have absent Defendants' conduct; and . . . the appropriate measure of 
damages.""); In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 218 F.R.D. 337, 342 (D. Mass. 2003) (""The factual questions common to the class 
members' claims include whether SmithKline engaged in the alleged anticompetitive conduct and whether and to what extent 
this conduct resulted in overcharges. . . . The legal questions common to the class members' clams include whether 
SmithKline's conduct violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.""); Buspirone, 210 F.R.D. at 57 (""There are also numerous common 
questions of fact and law at issue among the members of the proposed class concerning whether BMS engaged in the 
anticompetitive conduct alleged, the scope of this  [*15] conduct, and whether this conduct resulted in any overcharges in the 
market for buspirone.""). "
108,8," This determination is consistent with courts' findings in analogous delayed generic entry cases. See Buspirone, 210 F.R.D. at 
57 (finding that  [*17] the typicality requirment was satisfied, where plaintiff ""alleges that it was injured in the same general way 
and by the same general course of conduct that allegedly injured other members of the class.""); Meijer, 246 F.R.D. at 300 
(""Each plaintiff made some purchases of [the drug] during the class period,"" thus, ""the Court concludes that Plaintiffs claims 
arise from the same course of events that led to, and rely on the same legal arguments as, the claims of absent class 
members.""); Nifedipine, 246 F.R.D. at 369 (finding the typicality requirement satisfied where ""[e]ach potential class member's 
claim arises from the same alleged conspiracy...""); Relafen, 218 F.R.D. at 343 (finding the typicality requirement satisfied where 
plaintiff bases claims on the same ""core pattern of alleged anti-competitive conduct"" giving rise to all class members' claims."")."
108,9," Additionally, the Named Plaintiffs - Louisiana Wholesale and Meijer - have been found to be adequate class representatives in 
multiple prior analogous delayed entry cases.  [*19] See, Ovcon, 246 F.R.D. at 302-05 (finding Meijer and Louisiana Wholesale "
109,," are adequate class representatives); In re Tricor Antitrust Litig., 252 F.R.D. 213, 226-27 (D. Del. 2008) (same); Relafen, 218 
F.R.D. at 343 (same); Nifedipine, 246 F.R.D. at 369 (finding Meijer adequate); Wellbutrin, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36719, 2008

adequate); Buspirone, 210 F.R.D. at 57-58 (same); Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 305-06 (same)."
109,10," In light of Interim Class Counsel's experience in these types of cases and capable prosecution of this action to date, and there 
being no opposition to their request for appointment as counsel, the Court will appoint the same firms, in the same leadership 
structure, as Class Counsel under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g). The Court will also appoint Berger & Montague, P.C. 
as additional Class Counsel. "
110,11," As set forth in their Trial Plan, Plaintiffs' common evidence of Warner-Lambert's monopoly power will consist of, inter alia, 
Warner-Lambert's pricing records for Neurontin; the pricing records of Warner-Lambert's generic subsidiary for generic 
gabapentin; pricing data from generic competitors; academic studies regarding the market effects of generic competition; 
government studies regarding the same; and facts regarding what happened to prices and sales after the generic gabapentin 
entered the market. Plaintiffs will also rely on the expert testimony of Dr. Keith Leffler, who will testify that Warner-Lambert 
possessed market power in a well-defined relevant market consisting of Neurontin and its generic equivalents. "
111,12," Warner-Lambert makes much of the fact that the price of Neurontin increased after the entry of generic gabapentin to the 
market. However, as Plaintiffs argue, this fact is irrelevant to Plaintiffs' theory of injury: the overcharge pursued by Plaintiffs is the 
difference in price between Neurontin and the generics that dominated the market soon after generic entry, not the difference 
between the prices of Neurontin pre- and post-generic entry. In other words, Plaintiffs' overcharge analysis does not depend on 
a finding that brand prices decreased after generic entry. Accord Meijer, 246 F.R.D. at 310 (""the effect of generic entry on the 
price of [the brand] appears to be irrelevant to Plaintiffs' ability to demonstrate proof of impact through common evidence"")."
111,13," For example, government research shows that generic equivalents are initially priced between 20 and 30% lower than their 
branded counterparts, and that the generic price falls substantially as additional generic competitors enter. Pls. Proposed 
Findings of Fact B(1)(a) (citing French Aff.  [*30] 27 (collecting sources)) [Docket #348]."
111,14," For example, John Marion, Pfizer's Neurontin World Wide Team Leader, stated in a Declaration that the price of gabapentin 
subsequent to generic entry would be ""significantly reduced over time . . . and that the price would continue to decrease with the 
entry of each new generic manufacturer."" Pls. Proposed Findings of Fact B(1)(c) (citing Decl. of John Marino) [Docket #348]."
111,15," For example, in October 2004, generic gabapentin sold, on average, at a 37% discount off of the price of Neurontin 300 mg 
capsules. By December 2008, the generic 300 mg capsule price had fallen to a 95% discount off of Neurontin's pre-generic entry 
price. Pls. Proposed Findings of Fact B(1)(d) (citing French Aff. 45) [Docket No. 348]."
111,16," See, e.g., Relafen, 218 F.R.D. at 343 (finding predominance requirement met where direct purchasers relied on ""governmental 
and academic studies, projections and analyses described in [defendant's] and its competitors' internal documents, and price 
and sales data for Relafen and its generic equivalents""); Wellbutrin, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36719, 2008 WL 1946848, at *8 
(approving Dr. French's use of literature examining impact of generic entry into pharmaceutical  [*31] market and analysis of "
112,," public data collected on dispensation and purchases of prescription drugs to prove common impact); Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 
308 (approving the use of academic studies, defendants' internal sales documents, and marketplace sales data, to prove 
common impact); Nifedipine, 246 F.R.D. at 370 (noting that plaintiffs' expert explained that common impact could be proved by 
studies of generic entry on the pharmaceutical industry, evidence obtained from defendants, and publicly available sales data, 
and concluding that ""plaintiffs have offered a sufficient colorable method of proving class-wide impact with common evidence as 
to the issue of causation""); Tricor, 252 F.R.D. at 229 (same); Meijer, 246 F.R.D. at 308 (same); K-Dur, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
118396, 2008 WL 2669390, at *15 (same)."
112,17," For example, government and academic research shows that, due to institutional features of the pharmaceutical marketplace 
— including state generic substitution laws and third-party payor requirements — when less expensive generic equivalents are 
sold, they are rapidly substituted for their branded counterparts. Pls. Proposed  [*33] Findings of Fact B(2)(b)-(c) (citing French 
Aff. 27 (collecting sources)) [Docket #348]."
112,18," For example, one of Warner-Lambert's documents notes that the generic would ""make an immediate and substantial incursion 
into Warner-Lambert's exclusive market share."" Pl. Proposed Findings of Fact B(2)(d) (citing Marino Decl. 17) [Docket #348]."
112,19," For example, by December 2004, branded Neurontin sales accounted for only 20% of the total sales for gabapentin 300 mg 
capsules, while generic gabapentin accounted for 80%. By December 2008, branded Neurontin sales accounted for only 2% of 
300 mg sales by volume. Pl. Proposed Findings of Fact B(2)(e) (citing French Aff. 44) [Docket #348]."
112,20, Pl. Proposed Findings of Fact B(3)(a)-(b) (citing French Reb. 12 and Hughes Report 33) [Docket #348].
112,21, See cases cited supra note 16. 
113,22," This revision of the Class Definition follows analogous precedent. See K-Dur, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118396, 2008 WL 
2699390, at *1, *18 (""excluded are persons or entities who have neither purchased generic versions of [the branded product], 
nor obtained increased discounts on [the branded product], after the introduction of generic versions""); Meijer, 246 F.R.D. at 310 
n.17 (""if the evidence ultimately suggests that a putative class member has neither purchased a generic version of [the drug] nor 
received a discount on [the] branded [product] since the entry of [the] generic [product], the Court can accommodate by 
amending the class  [*36] definition to exclude such putative class members""); see also Wellbutrin, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
36719, at *41-43 (referring to court's ability to remove any possible uninjured class members who did not buy generic prior to 
trial)."
113,23," The parties dispute whether Plaintiffs must, at this stage, show that their adduced common proof will demonstrate injury to 
""every"" Class Member. Plaintiffs highlight cases indicating that common proof of ""widespread injury"" to the Class is sufficient. 
See, e.g., Meijer, 246 F.R.D. at 309-10 (""courts have routinely observed that the inability to show injury to a few does not defeat 
class certification where the plaintiffs can show widespread injury to the class""); K-Dur, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118396, 2008 WL 
2699390, at *18 (same); Cardizem, 200 F.R.D. at 307 (""Plaintiffs are not required to show that fact of injury actually exists for 
each class member""); see also Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co., 571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2009) (""a class will often include 
persons who have not been injured by the defendant's conduct. . . . Such a possibility or indeed inevitability does not preclude 
class certification."") Warner-Lambert argues that Hydrogen Peroxide changed this legal landscape, and  [*37] requires Plaintiffs 
to show that impact can be established for every class member through common proof. The Court notes, however, that the 
passage from Hydrogen Peroxide that Warner-Lambert cites for this proposition relates to Plaintiffs' burden at the merits stage of 
the litigation: ""to prevail on the merits, every class member must prove at least some antitrust impact resulting from the alleged 
violation."" 552 F.3d at 311 (emphasis added). Regardless, the definitional change proposed by Plaintiffs obviates the need to 
resolve this question. See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 96, 88 S. Ct. 1942, 20 L. Ed. 2d 947 (1968) (courts should not decide 
questions that have been mooted by subsequent developments)."
113,24," Any arguments regarding the variable rates at which Class Members substituted generic gabapentin for Neurontin relate to the 
quantum of injury, rather than the fact of injury, and therefore do not defeat predominance with respect to the impact element. 
See Zenith Radio Corp., 395 U.S. at 114 n.9 (the ""burden of proving the fact of damage ... is satisfied by its proof of some 
damage flowing from the unlawful conspiracy; inquiry beyond this minimum point goes only to the amount and not the fact of 
damages""). Likewise, Warner-Lambert's argument that Dr. French's damages model must account for Warner-Lambert's alleged  [*39] off-
labeling marketing conduct also goes to quantum of damages, not fact of damages. This argument relates to the volume of 
purchases on which the Class could properly claim to have paid overcharges, not to whether the Class in fact suffered injury. It 
therefore does not defeat predominance with respect to the impact element of Plaintiffs' claim. "
115,25," In any event, Dr. French has proposed  [*44] reasonable methods for accounting for generic bypass and off-label marketing."
115,26," Warner-Lambert suggests that a proper damages model would ""pair"" each Class Member's purchases of Neurontin with its 
purchases of generic gabapentin, resulting in an individual damages determination. "
116,27," This finding of superiority is consistent with the findings of other courts in analogous delayed generic entry cases. See In re 
Nifedipine, 246 F.R.D. at 371-72; Meijer, 246 F.R.D. at 313; Relafen, 218 F.R.D. at 346; Wellbutrin, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
36719, 2008 WL 1946848, at *9-10. "
125,1," The dispute resolution clause in the original 1999 agreement differed  [*5] only in that part (c) read as follows: ""This Agreement 
shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon, United States of America [without regard 
for its conflict of law provisions]."" (July Foster Decl. Ex. 9 at 20, ¶ 24, Ex. 10 at 8, ¶ 13(h).) "
128,2," A request for clarification is only appropriate for ""correction"" or ""interpretation"" of the award. (Sept. Foster Decl. Ex. 36 at 16; 
ICC Rules, Art. 29.) ""Correction"" is limited to ""clerical, computation or typographical error,"" and ""interpretation"" involves 
resolution of ambiguities  [*16] or uncertainties in the intended meaning of the award. (Sept. Chen Decl. Ex. 3 at 6.) "
129,3, The parties agree that venue is proper under 9 U.S.C. § 204. 
131,4," It is unclear whether a public policy defense is available under Chapter I of the FAA in light of Hall Street Assocs., L.L.C. v. 
Mattel, Inc., in which the Supreme Court determined that § 10(a) lists the exclusive grounds for vacating an arbitration award. 
552 U.S. 576, 584, 128 S. Ct. 1396, 170 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2008). Compare Comedy Club, 553 F.3d at 1290 (concluding that 
manifest disregard ground for vacatur survived Hall Street Assocs. because it is ""shorthand"" for § 10(a)(4)) with Frazier v. 
CitiFinancial Corp., 604 F.3d 1313, 1323-24 (11th Cir. 2010)(finding judicially created bases for vacatur, including public policy, 
were no longer available defenses after Hall Street Assocs.). Again, resolution of this issue is not critical to this decision because 
Bradken has failed to meet its burden under either the Convention or the FAA. "
135,5," The court also rejects Bradken's contention that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded U.S. antitrust law when he awarded 
attorney fees according to Article 31 of the ICC — ""the parties' choice of dispute resolution procedure."" (Bradken's Memo. in 
Support, p. 14.) Bradken has not identified any law which prohibits an award of attorney fees where such an award is expressly 
anticipated by the parties' arbitration agreement negotiated at arms' length. In the absence of a well-defined, explicit governing 
law prohibiting such an award, the court cannot find that the arbitrator erred. "
139,6," Bradken requests that the court separate fees incurred by ESCO solely in defense of Bradken's antitrust claims from those 
relating to the remaining issues in the arbitration. In light of the court's recommendation that the award be confirmed, and its 
conclusion that Bradken waived the issue of segregation, this issue is moot. "
150,1," The Court notes the Amended Complaint does not reference any basis in law on which a claim for unjust enrichment might 
proceed. The Indirect Purchasers do not link their claim to the law of any particular state. "
171,1," ""We have extended the 'incorporation  [*10] by reference' doctrine to situations in which the plaintiff's claim depends on the 
contents of a document, the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss, and the parties do not dispute the 
authenticity of the document, even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the complaint."" 
Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Parrino, 146 F.3d at 706). "
175,2," The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agrees with the Ninth Circuit that  [*24] 15 U.S.C. § 1635(b) does not compel a creditor to 
remove a mortgage lien in the absence of the debtor's tender of loan proceeds: Congress did not intend to require a lender to relinquish its security interest when it is now known that the borrowers did not 
intend and were not prepared to tender restitution of the funds expended by the lender in discharging the prior obligations 
of the borrowers. Powers v. Sims & Levin, 542 F.2d 1216, 1221 (4th Cir. 1976). "
182,3," F.R.Civ.P. 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to state law causes of action: HN51[
] ""[W]hile a federal court will examine state law to  [*48] determine whether the elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of action, the Rule 9(b) "
183,," requirement that the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity is a federally imposed rule."" Vess v. Ciba-Geigy 
Corp. USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1995)(italics in original))."
183,4," HN52[
] ""In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of 
conduct as the basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be 'grounded in fraud' or to 'sound in fraud,' and the pleading of 
that claim as a whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)."" Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103-1104. "
195,1," Supply conditions were expected to tighten again in 2009 with the retirement of old generation units and growth in demand. 
(CIS at 4.) "
197,2," On rare occasions, the Department of Justice has sought disgorgement of profits in contempt actions for violation of a consent 
decree. (See, e.g., Proposed Settlement Agreement & Order filed Nov. 26, 2007, United States v. Cal Dive Int'l, Inc., et ano., 05 
Civ. 2041, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7929 (D.D.C), ECF No. 31.)"
197,3," Some courts have recognized  [**13] limitations on Grupo Mexicano's scope. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Rahman v. 
Oncology Assocs., 198 F.3d 489, 496 (4th Cir. 1999) (Grupo Mexicano's holding limited to actions at law because it did not 
involve ""a situation in which equitable remedies were claimed""); see also In re Focus Media Inc., 387 F.3d 1077, 1085 (9th Cir. 
2004) (""Grupo Mexicano does not prohibit a preliminary injunction in this case. [Plaintiff] has pleaded a cause of action for 
fraudulent conveyance, and ... for constructive trust, which is equitable in nature.""); Quantum Corporate Funding, Ltd. v. Assist 
You Home Health Care Servs. of Va., 144 F. Supp. 2d 241, 250 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (""[C]ourts since Grupo Mexicano have found 
that where plaintiffs seek both equitable and legal relief. . ., a court retains its equitable power to freeze assets.""). However, 
Cavanagh is silent on these limitations and appears to accept Grupo Mexicano's applicability to any exercise of a federal court's 
equity powers. This Court need not examine this issue further because an analysis under traditional equity and antitrust 
principles is required."
197,4," To the extent that disgorgement of wrongly obtained assets due to securities fraud differs  [**14] from the relief sought here—
i.e., disgorgement of revenues earned under a lawful agreement executed for the purpose of restraining trade—Cavanagh's 
analysis is broad and applies with equal force in the antitrust context. "
199,5," Carson is also distinguishable because the plaintiff sought disgorgement of funds earned long in the past, more than eight 
years prior to the filing of the action. 52 F.3d at 1182. "
203,1," Astellas filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on November 19, 2010,  [*3] which has yet to be decided by the 
Court. (Doc. # 16). "
208,1," The complaint alleges that plaintiff entered a contract with ""German Motors Collision Center,"" and attaches a Customer 
Agreement between plaintiff and ""German Motors Corporation, also referred to as BMW of San Francisco."" The briefs 
concerning the pending motions attach other contracts, some of which refer to ""German Motors Corporation dba BMW of San 
Francisco."" The briefs sometimes refer to German Motors as a ""body shop"" and sometimes as a ""BMW dealership."" Although 
not clear, it appears that ""German Motors Collision Center"" is a department or adjunct of BMW of San Francisco; neither its 
precise legal  [*3] status nor its relationship to BMW of San Francisco is specified. "
216,1," With slight stylistic changes, we adopt the magistrate judge's background facts. To avoid needless repetition we have omitted 
citations to the record. "
218,2," Magistrate Carlson filed the instant report and recommendation on November 8, 2011. On November 26, plaintiffs filed both a 
motion for extension of time to file objections and the objections themselves. (Doc. 98). On November 29, 2010, Defendants 
McNelis and McNelis Law Offices filed a motion to strike the objections as untimely. (Doc. 101). Defendants Hludzik and the 
Hludzik Law Office also objected to granting an extension of time. (Doc. 99). All of these motions will be denied as moot because 
the plaintiffs filed timely objections. The report and recommendation was filed on November 8, 2010, and electronically served 
on all parties on that date. (Doc. 97). HN1[
] Objections to a report and recommendation are due fourteen days after it is served. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2). Fourteen days from November 8, 2010 is November 22,  [*8] 2010. This computation includes 
weekends and legal holidays as required under the Federal Rules. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(1). Where service is made by 
electronic means, three days are added onto the computation. See FED. R. CIV. P. 6(d) & 5(b)(2)(E). If that third day falls on a 
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the deadline moves to the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 6(c). Here, three days from November 22, 2010 is November 25, 2010, which was a legal holiday, Thanksgiving Day. 
See Fed. R. Civ. P. (6)(a). Therefore, the deadline moves to November 26, 2010, the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or 
legal holiday. Thus, the deadline for filing objections was November 26, 2010. Plaintiffs filed their objections on November 26, 
2010. Therefore, the objections were timely filed. "
219,3," The doctrine's name is derived from the seminal Supreme Court cases that explain the doctrine. Eastern R.R. Presidents 
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) (""Noerr""), and United Mine Workers 
v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965) (""Pennington""). "
221,4," While we need not address them fully, we also agree with the magistrate judge's conclusions that plaintiffs' state constitutional 
claims fail because the Pennsylvania constitution does not provide for a cause of action for damages. See Jones v. City of 
Philadelphia, 890 A.2d 1188, 1215-16 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2006). Likewise, no private cause of action for damages exists under 
Pennsylvania's racketeering RICO statute. D'Iorio v. Adonizio, 554 F. Supp. 222, 232 (M.D. Pa. 1982). "
224,1," Plaintiff claims she understood notaries to have a higher level of professional authority in real estate, as is customary in 
Mexico."
224,2," Plaintiff claims, among other things, that her income was falsified, in that ""the loan originator named a fictitious business as the 
Plaintiff's employer ... [and] gave untrue income amounts."" Doc. # 30 at ¶ 12."
224,3," Defendant's request for judicial notice, Doc. # 36-5, contains documents that are capable of ready determination by resort to 
sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned and, thus, are proper for judicial notice. See Fed.R.Evid. 201(b). 
Therefore, this Court GRANTS defendant's request for judicial notice of the referenced documents. "
226,4," Defendant moved to dismiss plaintiff's RESPA claims on the grounds that plaintiff has failed to allege defendant received any 
kickbacks, this argument will not be addressed because plaintiff did not allege this in her complaint."
226,5," Because this court dismissed plaintiff's TILA and RESPA claims on these grounds defendant's timeliness argument will not be 
addressed. "
238,1," More than 230 years ago, the noted Scottish pioneering political economist, Adam Smith observed: People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a 
conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by 
any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. ADAM SMITH, THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, (1776). "
239,2," As will be discussed in greater detail in this opinion, VandeBrake's  [**4] greed went so far as to double-cross one of his co-
conspirators, Siouxland Concrete Co. (""Siouxland""). VandeBrake underbid a project that VandeBrake and Siouxland had 
previously agreed would be awarded to Siouxland."
239,3," VandeBrake acknowledged during questioning by the court that he had read in trade journals he received about the 
prosecutions of others in his industry for antitrust violations. "
240,4," Ready-mix concrete is a product whose ingredients are cement, aggregate (sand and gravel), water, and, at times, other 
additives. Ready-mix concrete is used in various types of construction projects, including buildings and roads. Ready-mix 
concrete is generally produced in a concrete plant and then transported to a construction site by a cement-mixer truck."

F.3d 803, 805 (8th Cir. 2005), I, nevertheless, did so in the interests of justice and  [**11] fairness. "
241,6, Lake and Konz both testified pursuant to orders of the court granting them testimonial immunity. 
242,7," Siouxland's report to the Justice Department was made pursuant to the Antitrust Division's Leniency Program. The Antitrust 
Division's Leniency Program permits a company or individual to avoid criminal charges for antitrust violations provided the 
reporting company or individual is the first member of a conspiracy to report the criminal activity and meet other requirements of 
the program. See http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/criminal/leniency.htm (last visited January 9, 2011)."
242,8," These two projects were not awarded as agreed between VandeBrake and CW-2. Although Siouxland was designated to win 
the Sioux City water treatment plant project, VandeBrake double-crossed CW-2 by reneging on their agreement and having 
GCC submit a bid which undercut Siouxland's bid by approximately $1 per cubic yard. Similarly, while GCC was designated to 
win the Dordt College project, the project was rebid later in 2009, so the rigged bids in April 2009 were not used for awarding the 
project. "
243,9," The low number of projects awarded to GCC based on the rigged bids resulted from a majority of the rigged bids being 
allocated to Siouxland, that GCC lost some bids even when it had the agreed-upon low price, and that some projects were 
cancelled. "
244,10," For the purposes of the § 2R1.1 guideline, ""the volume of commerce attributable to an individual participant in a conspiracy is 
the volume of commerce done by him or his principal in goods or services that were affected by the violation."" U.S.S.G. § 2R1.1."
244,11," This calculation is based on the following volume of commerce attributable to VandeBrake for each of the three counts: Count One: $ 591,000.00 Count Two: $ 95,000.00 Count Three: $4,980,348.61 Total: $5,666,348.61"
244,12," After the merger, Stewart shared ownership with Norlyn VandeBrake, Steven VandeBrake's father, Dennis Rode and Brian 
Bosshart. Stewart and Norlyn VandeBrake each owns one third of the company while Rode and Bosshart each owns a one-sixth 
share of the company. "
245,13," Although the court cannot determine, on the evidence before it, who initiated the conspiracy between Stewart and 
VandeBrake, the fact that VandeBrake was responsible for initiating the other two charged conspiracies has not gone unnoticed. 
This circumstance alone makes it entirely plausible that VandeBrake was the party responsible for starting the conspiracy 
between him and Stewart. After all, VandeBrake had already taken the initiative to commence antitrust conspiracies with two 
other competitors of GCC in northwest Iowa. Having done so twice already, VandeBrake would possess even more motivation to 
go to the next step and commence a conspiracy with Stewart  [**25] since, by doing so, VandeBrake would have effectively 
created his own concrete cartel in northwest Iowa. "
247,14," Portable concrete plants are portable  [**33] ready-mix plants that large contractors bring to a work site to supply concrete 
needed for a project. In saying that he was ""bidding against portable plants,"" Stewart was attempting to bid low enough for one 
of two things to occur: if a general contractor owned a portable plant, the contractor would opt to not bring its portable plant to 
the work site but instead use concrete supplied by Great Lakes, or, if a general contractor did not have a portable plant, to be 
able to use Great Lakes's concrete price to bid competitively for the project against those contractors who had their own portable 
plant."
247,15, Special Agent Moeller testified in pertinent part: Q. How many projects did Mr. Stewart admit that he had rigged in his initial interview with you? A. Eight to ten to twelve was the quote. 
248,," Q. And was East Okoboji Beach one of the projects he mentioned in response to that question? A. Yes. Q. And what did you say he said about that project? A. He said he had spoken to Steve VandeBrake about that  [**35] job and that it went to CTI. Q. Now, did he speak again on August 16, 2010, in that interview about that project? A. Yes, he did. Q. And what did he tell you at that time? A. He said that Steve VandeBrake had called him and stated not to worry about GCC on the job and that GCC was not a 
factor in this job. Q. Did he say anything about giving Steve a price? A. He stated that there — he could not recall any further conversation. Q. On page 1 and 2 of that August 16 interview, do you see anything about whether — A. Well, VandeBrake — Steve also asked him where he was going to be at on it, and he said that he did not receive a price 
from Steve. Sentencing Tr., Vol. 2 at 128-29."
248,16," The court notes that, unlike Stewart's September 8, 2010, statement, which was taken down by a court reporter and 
transcribed, Stewart's initial statement on November 18, 2009, was not recorded. As a result, the court cannot ascertain with any 
certainty the context of Stewart's statement which Special Moeller took to be an admission. Significantly, no similar ""admission"" 
appears in Stewart's September 8, 2010, statement. "
249,17," There is a conflict  [**39] in the evidence as to the fixed price for concrete DeLoss was given by Great Lakes. Stewart testified 
that DeLoss had a set price with Great Lakes to purchase Spencer paving mix for $98 per cubic yard. Sentencing Tr., Vol. 1 at 
73. DeLoss, however, avers in his affidavit that his fixed price was $100 per cubic yard for Spencer paving mix. Defendant's Ex. 
18 at ¶¶ 4,6. ""Spencer paving mix"" is a special concrete mix required by the City of Spencer, Iowa."
249,18," Specifically, DeLoss avers, in pertinent part, that:"
249,6," . I did not request or receive a bid from Great Lakes Concrete or Spencer Ready Mix on either of [sic] this project, but 
relied on my guaranteed and agreed upon price of $100.00 per yard in placing my bids on this project. I am not sure when I 
received the $100.00 price, but it was not in the form of a bid. I am just uncertain as to the date when my annual price for 
this type of concrete was agreed upon per cubic yard. Defendant's Ex. 18 at ¶ 6. "
250,19," While Stewart claims that Great Lakes's 2009 price list did not come out until April of 2009, its 2009 price list clearly states that 
it became ""effective"" on ""January 1, 2009."" See Gov't Ex. E. Yet, Great Lakes's 2008 price list shows an ""effective"" date of 
March 1, 2008. Stewart's testimony does not explain this anomaly."
250,20," Stewart's testimony on this point was as follows: Q. Now, what's your explanation for how it came about that the prices that Great Lakes has on its price sheet and the prices 
that GCC has on its price sheet are identical? A. Their prices have been out since January. Mine didn't come out till April, and the word on the street — I'm from a small 
farming community — was the prices had gone up accordingly to that, in that vicinity. Q. So is it your testimony now that you took their publicly available prices into account when you came up with your price 
sheet? A. I never saw their sheets, but people that I know — it's a small community — who told me that they were up there in the 
upper $90 range. "
251,," Q. Now, in your prior interview in September 2010, you were asked the same question, and I believe your answer was you 
 [**46] — your recollection or your belief was that Mr. Steve VandeBrake was the one who copied your price sheet. Do 
remember that? A. Yes, I remember that. Q. Is that answer still true, or do you wish to take back that answer? A. No, their prices came out way before ours, and I did know about them. Q. So you take back your prior statement that Mr. Steve VandeBrake must have copied your price sheet and that's why 
they're the same? A. Yes. Sentencing Tr., Vol. 1 at 134-35."
251,21," GCC maintained a separate price list for its Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, facility. See Gov't Ex. D. GCC's 2009 prices for its 3000, 
3500, and 4000 pound concrete mixes at its Sergeant Bluff operation were $8 to $10 less than at its other concrete operations. 
Notably, Great Lakes has no concrete operation which competes with GCC's Sergeant Bluff facility. "
252,22," The court has attributed to Stewart the volume of commerce resulting from all standard-mix concrete sales of Great 
 [**50] Lakes in its relevant area. The court rejects Stewart's argument that the court should include only undiscounted standard-
mix concrete sales. This is because the final price for all of Great Lakes's standard-mix concrete sales began with the sheet 
price of the concrete since the sheet price formed the baseline from which all discounted prices were determined. Thus, even 
though many Great Lakes's customers were accorded discounts in their purchases of Great Lakes's standard-mix concrete, the 
discounted price was always calculated by subtracting the customer's particular discount from Great Lakes's 2009 sheet price 
for the standard-mix concrete. Thus, each Great Lakes's sale of standard-mix concrete was ""affected"" by the price-fixing of 
Great Lakes's 2009 price sheets. See United States v. SKW Metals & Alloys, 195 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir. 1999) (""While a price-
fixing conspiracy is operating and has any influence on sales, it is reasonable to conclude that all sales made by defendants 
during that period are ""affected"" by the conspiracy.""). "
253,23," VandeBrake does have three pending charges for ""Operating While Intoxicated,"" ""Operating Without Headlights,"" and ""Drive 
Left of Center."" These charges are all from January 30, 2010. "
254,24," Although Stewart indicated that he was arrested in 1977 and 1983  [**58] for driving while intoxicated, records for these 
arrests are no longer available and the disposition of these offenses are unknown."
254,25," As the court mentioned at the sentencing hearing, the court is giving Stewart's plea agreement virtually no weight. "
255,26," If the court finds that the prosecution breached the plea agreement, the undersigned will have no choice but recusal pursuant 
to Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262-63, 92 S. Ct. 495, 30 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1971), as construed by the Eighth Circuit 
Court of Appeals in United States v. McCray, 849 F.2d 304, 305-06 (8th Cir. 1988), leaving Stewart's sentencing to another 
judge in this district. See United States v. Mosley, 505 F.3d 804, 809-12 (8th Cir. 2007); United States v. Thompson, 403 F.3d 
1037, 1041 (8th Cir. 2005);  [**61] United States v. DeWitt, 366 F.3d 667, 671 (8th Cir. 2004); United States v. Van Horn, 976 
F.2d 1180, 1183-84 (8th Cir. 1992); Brunelle v. United States, 864 F.2d 64, 65 (8th Cir. 1988)."
255,27, Paragraph 12 of the plea agreement states: DEFENDANT'S COOPERATION
255,12," . The defendant will cooperate fully and truthfully  [**63] with the United States in the prosecution of this case, the 
conduct of the current federal investigation of violations of federal antitrust and related criminal laws involving the 
manufacture or sale of ready-mix concrete in the state of Iowa, any other federal investigation resulting therefrom, and any 
litigation or other proceedings arising or resulting from any such investigation to which the United States is a party (""Federal 
Proceeding""). The ongoing, full, and truthful cooperation of the defendant shall include, but not be limited to: "
256,," (a) producing all non-privileged documents, including claimed personal documents, and other materials, wherever 
located, in the possession, custody, or control of the defendant, requested by attorneys and agents of the United 
States. (b) making himself available for interviews in the Northern District of Iowa, not at the expense of the United States, 
upon the request of attorneys and agents of the United States; (c) responding fully and truthfully to all inquiries of the United States in connection with any Federal Proceeding, 
without falsely implicating any person or intentionally withholding any information, subject to the penalties of making 
false  [**64] statements (18 U.S.C. § 1001) and obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503, et seq.); (d) otherwise voluntarily providing the United States with any non-privileged material or information, not requested in 
(a)-(c) of this paragraph, that he may have that is related to any Federal Proceeding; and (e) when called upon to do so by the United States in connection with any Federal Proceeding, testifying in grand jury, 
trial, and other judicial proceedings, fully, truthfully, and under oath, subject to the penalties of perjury (18 U.S.C. § 
1621), making false statements or declarations in grand jury or court proceedings (18 U.S.C. § 1623), contempt (18 
U.S.C. §§ 401-402), and obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503 et seq.). Stewart Plea Agreement at ¶ 12 (docket no. 11 in CR10-4028-MWB). "
259,28," Pursuant to Stewart's plea agreement with the prosecution, the prosecution agreed not to seek this enhancement. The court, 
however, is not bound by the terms of the parties' plea agreement. "
260,29," Nonetheless, the court recognizes that it would be well within its discretion to deny both Stewart and VandeBrake reductions 
for acceptance of responsibility. VandeBrake was not entirely forthcoming in his testimony and Stewart denied participating in a 
price-fixing scheme with VandeBrake regarding their 2009 price sheets, contrary to the admissions made by VandeBrake and 
Lake. An objection the court has resolved against Stewart. Nonetheless, the court concludes that Stewart's overall candor is 
sufficient to entitle him to a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility."
260,30," As the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained: HN12[
] ""'Departure'  [**79] is a term of art under the Guidelines and refers only to non-Guidelines sentences imposed 
under the framework set out in the Guidelines."" Irizarry v. United States, 553 U.S. 708, 128 S. Ct. 2198, 2202, 171 L. Ed. 2d 
28 (2008). A variance, on the other hand, is a ""non-Guidelines sentence[ ] based on the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 
3553(a)."" United States v. Solis-Bermudez, 501 F.3d 882, 884 (8th Cir. 2007). Mireles, 617 F.3d at 1012 n.2; see Lozoya, 623 F.3d at 626 (noting that, ""[a]s opposed to a 'departure,' a 'variance' refers to a 
'non-Guidelines sentence' based on the factors enumerated in section 3553(a).""); United States v. Solis-Bermudez, 501 F.3d 
882, 884 (8th Cir. 2007) (explaining that departures are provided for in Chapter Five and Section 4A1.3 of the Guidelines). "
261,31," The plea agreement provides in pertinent part: The parties agree that there exists no aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken 
into consideration by the U.S. Sentencing Commission in formulating the Sentencing Guidelines justifying a departure 
pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0. The parties agree not to seek or support any sentence outside of the Guidelines range nor 
 [**83] any Guidelines adjustment for any reason that is not set forth in this Plea Agreement. The parties further agree that 
the recommended sentence set forth in this Plea Agreement is reasonable. Plea Agreement, docket no. 11 in CR10-4028-MWB, at ¶ 8. "
262,32," There is an intra-circuit split in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals over whether bad faith on the part of the prosecution 
constitutes an additional basis for compelling a motion for downward departure based on substantial assistance. See Davis, 583 
F.3d at 1098 (recognizing ""'intra-circuit split'"") (quoting Perez, 526 F.3d at 1138). "
263,33," Even if the court construed Stewart's argument to be also based on 5K2.11's second ground, his conviction and sentence 
address the very harm Congress sought to prevent in the Sherman Act. Thus, a downward departure based on 5K2.11's second 
ground is not warranted. "
265,34," Even if economic pressures on  [**98] a trade or business was a viable basis for a downward departure under 5K2.12, the 
court concludes there is some obligation on Stewart to demonstrate that he had no reasonable alternative to committing his 
criminal acts here. See United States v. Lopez-Garcia, 316 F.3d 967, 973 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding that defendant was not entitled 
to § 5K2.12 downward departure where she failed to tell border agents she was in danger and instead continued to smuggle 
aliens into the United States). Here, instead of engaging in the charged Sherman Act violations, Stewart could have availed 
himself of the Justice Department's Leniency Program and informed law enforcement personnel about VandeBrake's activities in 
the ready-mix concrete industry. "
266,35," The court notes that in 2009 Stewart was in Florida during all of January and February. See Gov't Ex. C. at 112. Thus, at least 
in the slower winter months, Stewart's daily presence at Great Lakes is not required. "
267,36," To the extent that Stewart is also seeking a sentencing variance on the basis of the impact of his absence on Great Lakes's 
business and employees, the court finds that a variance is unwarranted. "
269,37," Indeed, this point is exemplified by a recent story in the New York Times which reported on the arrest of Sven Koppler for 
illegally importing tarantulas, including rare Mexican red-kneed tarantulas (Brachypelma smithi) which are protected under the 
Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species. See Rebecca Cathcart, German Charged with Shipping Tarantulas, 
NEW 
YORK 
TIMES, 
Dec. 
4, 
2010, 
at 
A14, 
available 
at http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/us/04spiderman.html?scp=1&sq=tarantulas&st =cse. The article states that Koppler is 
charged with ""one count of illegally importing wildlife into the United States, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in 
federal prison and a $250,000 fine."" Id. Koppler is alleged to have smuggled tarantulas into the United States by ""bundl[ing] 
them in multicolored straws or plastic containers and sen[ding]  [**114] them in boxes though the United States Postal Service."" 
Id. Why would one do this? The article reports that tarantulas can fetch up to $1,000 each and that ""[t]arantulas, especially 
endangered ones, are 'highly sought after by collectors,'. . .because they 'make good pets,' and can live up to 30 years."" Id. The 
court's own research revealed that on December 1, 2010, Koppler was, in fact, charged in a single count criminal complaint filed 
in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, with importing wildlife contrary to law, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 545. See United States v. Koppler, 2:10-marijuana-02902M (Dec. 1, 2010). The maximum penalty for violating § 545 is 
20 years imprisonment. Thus, the possible maximum penalty for smuggling tarantulas into the United States is twice the penalty 
provided for under the Sherman Act."
269,38," Enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, § 921(a)(20(A) creates an exception that allows gun possession despite a 
prior conviction for an antitrust or business regulatory crime. The section provides as follows. (20) The term ""crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year"" does not include— (A) any Federal or State  [**115] offenses pertaining to antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, restraints of trade, or 
other similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices, or . . . . What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the 
proceedings were held. Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or 
has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such pardon, 
expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive 
firearms."
269,18," U.S.C. § 921(a)(20)(A). Because federal antitrust violations were misdemeanors at the time of the Gun Control Act of 1968's 
passage, it is unclear what the impetus was for this section's inclusion in the bill. After a careful and exhaustive search, the 
court's review of the legislative history of the Gun Control Act of 1968 failed to disclose either the sponsor of this language or the 
reason for its inclusion. Equally mysterious is the reason why this provision remained unchanged after Congress made Sherman 
Act antitrust  [**116] violations felonies in 1974. There are hundreds of other crimes, both economic and nonviolent, the 
conviction of which results in the loss of the privilege to possess firearms. "
270,39," The court notes that relevant conduct is narrower than Pinkerton liability. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, comment. (n.1); see Spotted Elk, 
548 F.3d at n.11 (recognizing that ""the November 1992 amendment clarified that relevant conduct was narrower than Pinkerton 
liability.""). "
272,40," A basic concept of economics is that unit production costs are substantially affected by changes in production volume. While 
some costs do not fluctuate with changes in production volume, others do. Therefore, because some costs are fixed, there is an 
inverse relationship between production volume and unit production costs. As the volume of production increases, the unit costs 
of production typically decrease. Thus, the lowest unit cost of production should be achieved at the maximum attainable capacity 
of a manufacturing operation."
272,41," This  [**127] is best exemplified by the following extensive exchange between the court and VandeBrake during his testimony 
at the sentencing hearing: THE COURT: I'm sorry, Mr. VandeBrake. What was your motivation for initially engaging in the antitrust conspiracy in 
2006? THE WITNESS: In 2006? THE COURT: Right. That's when the first — that's when the indictment alleges the earliest conspiracy. "
273,," THE WITNESS: You know, we had — we had merged, and we had a plant in Sioux Center, and that was, you know, close 
to Rock Valley, and we wanted, you know, just wanted to get a — you know, get a decent price for our concrete. THE COURT: Well, why doesn't the market place determine a decent price for concrete? Why doesn't the free market 
determine that? THE WITNESS: Well, they really do. THE COURT: So you really wanted more than a decent price. You wanted to make more money than what the marketplace 
would allow you to make. THE WITNESS: No — yeah —well — THE COURT: No? No? THE WITNESS: Well, yeah, I wanted a fair price for my product. THE COURT: Well, the marketplace doesn't establish a fair price? THE WITNESS: I don't — you know, I didn't think that it was as fair as it should be. THE COURT: You mean it wasn't as profitable  [**128] as you wanted it to be. THE WITNESS: That's correct. THE COURT: Did you take any business at the various schools you attended? THE WITNESS: Yeah. THE COURT: Doesn't the free market always determine a fair price? THE WITNESS: Yes. THE COURT: But you weren't satisfied with that, were you? THE WITNESS: You know, honestly I — I — you know, there's a lot of expenses, and — and —, you know, we were down 
lower, way low. THE COURT: Well, you had — you personally had a high net worth, didn't you, back in 2006? THE WITNESS: A high net worth? THE COURT: Yeah. What do you think your net worth was in 2006? THE WITNESS: I don't know. I really don't know. THE COURT: You don't know? THE WITNESS: Two million? THE COURT: Okay. Do you realize that that places you in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of all working people in the United 
States? Do you realize that? THE WITNESS: I do now. THE COURT: Okay. So back in 2006 you have a net worth of two million dollars. So your net worth has increased — isn't it 
ten million now? THE WITNESS: Something like that, yes. THE COURT: So you increased your net worth from two million to ten million in four years, and you haven't worked for the 
last year plus? Is that your testimony? THE  [**129] WITNESS: No. I mean, I — THE COURT: Well, your net worth is — when you filled this out which was several months ago, it was $10,233,000. THE WITNESS: Well, that's — yeah, that's what it was. THE COURT: So it was increased from two million to ten million plus in less than four years. "
274,," [*1007] THE WITNESS: I covered a big territory, though. I — you know, it wasn't just — I didn't make that money, and, you know, 
that net worth came from the sale of my company. I didn't — THE COURT: Yeah. So I guess part of what you were doing back in 2006 was to try and increase the value of your 
company so you could sell it by violating the federal antitrust laws. THE WITNESS: No. THE COURT: No. That wasn't your motivation. THE WITNESS: No. THE COURT: No. It was just to get a fair price. THE WITNESS: Yeah. THE COURT: Okay. THE WITNESS: Yeah. THE COURT: It wasn't greed. THE WITNESS: No. THE COURT: It wasn't greed. THE WITNESS: Well, you know, I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to make money. THE COURT: Well, you told me before 
you weren't a liar. So was it greed or wasn't it greed? What's difficult about that question? Were you being greedy trying to 
violate the antitrust laws or not? THE WITNESS: You know, I think — I'm not  [**130] — if I were to tell you that I didn't want to make more money and that I 
wasn't going to make more money, I'd be lying. But, you know, we have equipment. We have employees. We have health 
insurance and, you know — THE COURT: So that justifies violating the federal antitrust laws? THE WITNESS: No, it doesn't. THE COURT: Well, under your theory every company has overhead. Can you name me a single company that doesn't 
have some overhead? THE WITNESS: No, sir. THE COURT: So, under your theory every company in the United States would be entitled to violate the federal antitrust 
laws to make more money and get a, quote, fair price. THE WITNESS: No, sir. THE COURT: Well, then explain it to me. THE WITNESS: I was wrong. THE COURT: Well, it's only wrong because you got caught, and you only got caught because the government has a 
leniency program. You'd still be violating the antitrust laws today if you hadn't gotten caught in my opinion, wouldn't you? 
Why would you have stopped? You didn't stop after you sold the company. Explain that one to me. Why didn't you stop 
after you sold the company? THE WITNESS: You know, I can't explain that to you. THE COURT: You didn't think I was going to ask you that? THE  [**131] WITNESS: Yeah, I did. THE COURT: And you have no explanation whatsoever? THE WITNESS: No. I just, you know. . . "
275,," THE COURT: You just violated federal law for the hell of it? THE WITNESS: No. THE COURT: Well, then why'd you do it? THE WITNESS: Well, I — trying to get along. THE COURT: Trying to get along. THE WITNESS: With the comp — yeah, I'm just, you know, trying to, you know. . . THE COURT: A $10 price increase is trying to get along with the competition? That's your definition of trying to get along? THE WITNESS: I — I — you know, I just tried to — I tried to get a decent price. I tried to get — THE COURT: A decent price. You tried to get an illegal price. And you're telling me an illegal antitrust fixing price is what it 
takes to get a decent price in your industry? THE WITNESS: I don't have — THE COURT: Pardon me? THE WITNESS: I don't have much to say about that. You know, I — THE COURT: Well, do you think you were greedy? THE WITNESS: I — no. THE COURT: No. No. You weren't greedy. THE WITNESS: Competitive but . . . THE COURT: Competitive. THE WITNESS: Yeah. Well, you know, I — THE COURT: Competitive? THE WITNESS: You know, I — THE COURT: It's the antithesis — it's the opposite of being competitive. THE  [**132] WITNESS: Yeah. THE COURT: To fix prices, isn't it? THE WITNESS: Yes. THE COURT: So how can you tell me you were competitive? You were a cheater. You were a thief. That's not being 
competitive. Is it? Is that your [*1008] definition of competitive? Is that what they teach you in church? Is that your definition of competitive? THE WITNESS: No, sir. THE COURT: Well, then what did you mean when you say you were being competitive? THE WITNESS: It was a poor choice of words I guess. I'm not — I wasn't being competative. THE COURT: You were stealing other people's money. THE WITNESS: Well ? THE COURT: You don't think you were stealing. THE WITNESS: No, I think they got a great product for a good price. They got a fantastic product. THE COURT: So I'm just trying to understand, Mr. VandeBrake, what you're saying. You justify three separate criminal 
conspiracies to violate the Sherman Act because you were selling a great product for a good price. "

277,42," In the early 1970's 8 percent of price-fixing convictions resulted in a jail term and, even then, the average term of incarceration 
was only 44 days. See Gregory J. Werden, Sanctioning Cartel Activity: Let the Punishment Fit the Crime, Eur. Competition J. 
(publication forthcoming), http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/articles/240611.htm (last visited January 13, 2011) (discussing early 
prison sentences under the Sherman Act). The United States Justice Department reports on its web site that by 2010, both of "
278,," those figures had increased dramatically over the proceeding four decades. In 2010, 78 percent of defendants convicted of 
Sherman Act violations received sentences that included a period of incarceration and the average period of incarceration was 
30 months. See http://www.justice.gov/atr/public/criminal/264101.html (last visited January 13, 2011). "
279,43," The court notes that HN32[
] 18 U.S.C. § 3572(a) and U.S.S.G § 5E1.2(d) list slightly different factors. To the extent they conflict, the court has followed the factors listed in § 3572(a) since statutes prevail over conflicting  [**145] Guidelines. See 
United States v. Butler, 207 F.3d 839, 850 (6th Cir. 2000) (""When the Commission's interpretation, as embodied in a guideline, 
does not square with clear Congressional intent, courts will not apply that guideline.""). "
280,44," ""'Total punishment' means 'the precise sentence determined by  [**148] the sentencing judge from within the appropriate 
guidelines range.'"" Lone Fight, 625 F.3d at 525 (quoting United States v. Ervasti, 201 F.3d 1029, 1045-46 (8th Cir. 2000); see 
Rutherford, 599 F.3d at 820 (quoting Ervasti, 201 F.3d at 1045-46). "
291,1," The court will summarize only the most significant allegations because the complaint fills nearly eighty pages. One of the side 
effects  [**8] of the Supreme Court's decision in Twombly is that antitrust complaints have grown in volume as plaintiffs attempt 
to provide enough factual detail to survive a motion to dismiss. Herbert Hovenkamp, The Pleading Problem in Antitrust Cases 
and Beyond, 95 Iowa L. Rev. Bulletin 55, 56-57 (2010) (""Twombly's approach leads to a great deal of confusion and—in antitrust 
at least—has produced prolix complaints sometimes running to more than one-hundred pages.""). However, it is important to 
recognize that Twombly does not call for detailed factual allegations. It only requires enough facts to show that an alleged 
conspiracy is plausible. 550 U.S. at 555. "
292,2," At the time, the plant was owned by a company called Centeon. Today, it is owned by CSL Behring. (CAC ¶ 62.)"
292,3," At the time, the plant was owned by Alpha Therapeutic Corporation, and it is now owned by Baxter. (CAC ¶ 62.) "
293,4," An FTC press release from the time of the lawsuit stated that plasma therapies markets ""are already exhibiting troubling signs 
of coordinated behavior."" And, according to plaintiffs' complaint, ""The FTC has recognized that some of the language from the 
files of CSL and Baxter would cause them 'embarrassment' and 'could expose [CSL] to possible treble damages actions.'"" (Id. ¶¶ 
205, 210.) "
294,5," In a perfectly competitive market with many sellers, the fact that one competitor reduces its price will have only a tiny effect on 
the profits of the other competitors because each seller controls only a fraction of the supply. The other competitors will not be 
forced to change their own pricing in response. In a concentrated market, however, each  [**19] firm controls a significant share 
of the supply, and a price cut by one firm could significantly cut into the market share of other competitors. The other firms in the 
industry will have a strong incentive to match any price cut. Thus the firms in the concentrated market are said to be 
interdependent. Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law 56 (2d ed. 2001). "
295,6," The court follows the parties' lead in focusing on whether plaintiffs have adequately pled circumstantial evidence of a 
conspiracy. The plaintiffs suggest that the complaint also contains allegations of direct communications between defendants, "
296,," which distinguishes the allegations from those in Twombly, which alleged conspiracy only in a conclusory manner. (Pls.' Resp. to 
Defs.' Mot. at 15 n.16.) But the argument appears only in a footnote and is not well developed."
296,7," Similarly, in Twombly, the Court noted that an inference of conspiracy could be drawn from allegations of ""complex and 
historically unprecedented changes in pricing structure made at the very same time by multiple competitors, and made for no 
other discernable reason."" 550 U.S. at 556 n.4. The Court cited to an influential treatise which terms this type of behavior 
""incredible simultaneous parallelism."" 6 Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 1425c (3d ed. 2010). The 
paradigmatic example of simultaneous parallelism given by the treatise is of two firms making identical secret bids on some non-
standardized product. Without previous coordination, such a coincidence would seem to be totally improbable. Id. at 185. The 
Seventh Circuit recently affirmed another decision from this judicial district denying a motion to dismiss where it was alleged that 
""[t]he change in the industry's pricing structure was so rapid . . . that it could not have been accomplished without agreement on 
the details of the new structure, the timing of its adoption, and the  [**27] specific uniform price increase that would ensue on its 
adoption."" Text Messaging, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 26299, 2010 WL 5367383, at *5."
296,8," The conduct by Baxter and CSL would be described as ""sequential parallelism"" because each firm would have had time to 
observe and evaluate its competitor's actions before making its own production decisions. 6 Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 1425d, at 
188. "
297,9," In his treatise on antitrust law, Judge Richard Posner lays out a number of factors on which enforcers of the law should focus 
in seeking out industries  [**32] where collusion is likely to occur. Among others, he lists the following factors which are relevant 
in this case: (1) a market concentrated on the selling side and unconcentrated on the buying side, (2) inelastic demand at the 
competitive price, (3) entry into the market takes a long time, (4) standardized product, and (5) high ratio of fixed to variable 
costs. Posner, supra, at 69-79. "
298,10," The Twombly Court expressed its concern that antitrust discovery could be expensive and that plaintiffs who put forth 
implausible allegations should not be permitted to abuse the system. 550 U.S. at 546. But the Supreme Court has also 
recognized that Congress drafted the antitrust laws with the express purpose of encouraging private enforcement. Reiter v. 
Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 344, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979). If private plaintiffs, who do not have access to 
inside information, are to pursue violations of the law, the pleading standard must take into account the fact that a complaint will 
ordinarily be limited to allegations pieced together from publicly available data. "
308,1," The Blockbuster court recognized that a proposed amendment to explicitly exempt an action brought by an attorney general 
from the reach of Section 1332(d) was defeated in the Senate. See 151 Cong. Rec. S1157-02, at S1157-58 (2005). However, "
309,," the court rejected the defendant's argument that this defeat meant that parens patriae actions should be considered class 
actions under Section 1332(d), because the underlying debate revealed that a number of senators believed the amendment to 
be unnecessary. See Blockbuster, 384 F. Supp. 2d at 753 (quoting Senator Grassley's statement during the debate: ""State 
attorneys general have authority under the laws of every State to bring enforcement actions to protect their citizens. Sometimes 
these laws are parens patriae cases, similar to class actions in the sense that the State attorney general represents the people 
of that State. In other instances, their actions are brought directly on behalf of that particular State. But they are not class 
actions; rather, they are very unique  [*31] attorney general lawsuits authorized under State constitutions or under statutes. One 
reason this amendment is not necessary is because our bill will not affect those lawsuits."" See also id. (additional similar 
statements by Senators Grassley, Hatch, Cornyn and Specter)). Based upon the silence in CAFA regarding parens patriae actions, as well as CAFA's legislative history, several courts have held 
that ""CAFA does not apply to [state enforcement] actions."" Connecticut v. Moody's Corp., 664 F. Supp. 2d 196, 202 (D. Conn. 
2009) (granting a motion to remand by the State of Connecticut); Harvey v. Blockbuster, Inc., 384 F. Supp. 2d 749, 752-54 
(D.N.J. 2005) (surveying CAFA's legislative history and concluding that it was not Congress' intent to encroach upon States' 
authority to bring parens patriae actions). This Court finds it unnecessary to determine whether, as a categorical matter, CAFA 
does not apply to parens patriae actions. Instead, as set forth in this order, the Court finds that here the States are the real 
parties in interest, and neither CAFA's minimal diversity nor ""class action"" or ""mass action"" prongs is met here."
309,2," California added parens patriae authority to the Cartwright Act following enactment of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
Improvements Act (the ""HSR"" Act), 15 U.S.C. § 15c. The HSR Act ""was designed to enhance the effectiveness of antitrust 
enforcement on behalf of small consumers."" Illinois v. Abbott & Assocs., 460 U.S. 557, 573 n.29, 103 S. Ct. 1356, 75 L. Ed. 2d 
281 (1983). In enacting the HSR Act, ""Congress focused on the difficulty of achieving class certification of consumer actions 
under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the complexity of measuring and distributing damages in such cases."" 
Id. ""To remedy these problems, the 1976 statute permits State attorneys general the right to institute parens patriae suits [under 
the Sherman Act] on behalf of State residents[,] . . . exempts such suits from the class action requirements of Rule 23, . . . and 
allows damages in these suits to be computed through aggregation techniques, . . ."" Id. (citing HSR Act)."
309,3," In addition, California states that it inadvertently omitted a claim for civil penalties from the complaint, and that California will 
seek to amend the complaint to add a claim for civil penalties.  [*35] Those penalties, $2,500 for each violation (Cal. Bus. & Prof. "
310,," Code § 17206), would inure to the State. Defendants correctly argue that the Court's review is limited to the complaint as it stood 
at the time of removal."
310,4," This section provides, in relevant part, ""Every corporation which violates RCW 19.86.030 or 19.86.040 shall pay a civil penalty 
of not more than five hundred thousand dollars."" Wash Rev. Code § 19.86.140."
310,5," If the Court could consider the civil penalties that California intends to seek, this fact would further support the finding that 
California is the real party in interest, as the civil penalties sought would be substantial. "
319,1," 15 U.S.C. § 1 criminalizes anticompetitive agreements and specifies criminal penalties, and 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) provides a 
private right of action with treble damages for any violation of the antitrust laws."
319,2," Section 2 of the Sherman Act does reach independent behavior, but only where a person ""shall monopolize, or attempt to 
monopolize,"" a market. 15 U.S.C. § 2. That section is not invoked here."
319,3," Conscious parallelism has also been called ""tacit collusion"" or ""oligopolistic price coordination."" See Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown 
& Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993).  [**5] Defendants' assertion that ""[a] 
merely tacit agreement is not an antitrust violation"" conflates the concepts of ""tacit collusion,"" referring to bare conscious 
parallelism, and ""tacit agreement,"" which can be reached under § 1, and which plaintiffs allege is in play in this case. See Bell 
Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 553, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (distinguishing mere conscious parallelism 
from ""an agreement, tacit or express"") (quoting Theatre Enters., Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., 346 U.S. 537, 540, 74 S. 
Ct. 257, 98 L. Ed. 273 (1954) (internal quotation mark omitted))."
319,4," ""An oligopoly market is one in which a few relatively large sellers account for the bulk of the output."" 2B Areeda, Hovenkamp, & 
Solow, Antitrust Law ¶ 404a, at 9 (3d ed. 2007). By contrast to a competitive market, in which no single producer has the power 
to affect the market price, in an oligopolistic market each of the major sellers can affect the market price by changing its output. 
By contrast to a monopolized market, ""no one firm can unilaterally determine market price by varying its output"" because rivals 
are large enough to affect the market price by doing the same. Id. at 10. As a result, ""the distinctive characteristic of oligopoly is 
recognized  [**6] interdependence among the leading firms: the profit-maximizing choice of price and output for one depends on 
the choices made by others."" Id. "
320,5," In Euromodas, Inc. v. Zanella, Ltd., 368 F.3d 11, 17 & n.5 (1st Cir. 2004), we applied these rules to vertical conspiracies and

horizontal conspiracies as well. "

Act's minimal diversity requirements. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(d), 1453."
322,8," Plaintiffs argue that the district court's use, at one point in the opinion, of the word ""exclude"" without the modifying phrase 
""tends to"" shows that the court required them to produce direct evidence of conspiracy, rather than only circumstantial evidence 
tending to exclude the possibility of independent action. It is clear from the court's opinion that it did not require any particular 
category of evidence. "
325,9," The witnesses observed that Ahern seemed offended by the idea that such a discount would be a necessary condition to

327,10," HN14[

energy failure, war, national or local emergency, or other extraordinary circumstances. 940 Mass. Code Regs. 3.01."
327,11," Whether this is the proper duration of any market emergency that occurred is not before us. We only note that the rapid 
decline in defendants' costs beginning in mid-September may indicate that any market emergency was no longer in place. See 
940 Mass. Code Regs. 3.01 (defining ""market emergency"")."
327,12," On appeal, plaintiffs ask the court to certify the question of the interpretation of the price-gouging regulation to the 
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. See Mass. S.J.C. R. 1:03 § 1; see also The Real Estate Bar Assoc. for Mass., Inc. v. 
Nat'l Real Estate Info. Servs., 608 F.3d 110, 118-19 (1st Cir. 2010). Plaintiffs conceded at oral argument that they did not ask the 
district court to certify the question. In any event, particularly because plaintiffs' case fails even  [**37] under the interpretation 
they put forth, we exercise our discretion to decide the question ourselves, declining to certify it. See Boston Gas Co. v. Century 
Indem. Co., 529 F.3d 8, 13-15 (1st Cir. 2008). "
328,13," HN15[

762 N.E.2d 303, 309 (Mass. 2002) (emphasis added); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A § 2. Even where it is appropriate to consider 
them, however, the FTC's interpretations are ""ordinarily instructive rather than conclusive."" In re TJX Cos. Retail Sec. Breach 
Litig., 564 F.3d 489, 497 (1st Cir. 2009). Here, we note that the FTC's petroleum pricing investigation was conducted under a 
specific mandate from Congress outside the FTCA that included the definition of price-gouging that the FTC was to use, see 
Federal Trade Commission, Investigation of Gasoline Price Manipulation and Post-Katrina Gasoline Price Increases iii (2006).

missing, we imputed the value from the most recent recorded value. The parties' citations for prices and gross margins vary

standing to bring Walker Process claims. Bourns, Inc. v. Raychem Corp., 331 F.3d 704, 711-12 (9th Cir. 2003). However,

] Antitrust standing is distinct from Article III constitutional standing. Antitrust standing examines the connection 
between the asserted wrongdoing and the claimed injury to limit the class of potential plaintiffs to those who are in the best 
position to vindicate the antitrust infraction. See In re Circuit Breaker Litig., 984 F. Supp. 1267, 1273 (C.D. Cal. 1997). ""A plaintiff

L. Ed. 2d 253 (2003), the Ninth Circuit explained that an exception applies when ""there is no realistic possibility that the direct 
purchaser will sue its supplier over the antitrust violation."" This Court addressed the argument that ""Silgan will not sue"" in its 
prior order, and dismissed this argument for failure to allege Silgan was controlled by any defendant. (See Doc. 224, Order, p. 
12-13.) As was fatal in the prior motion, plaintiff again fails to allege that Silgan is controlled by UPI or any other defendant. No 
allegations in the SAC allege the requisite control by defendants. Whether plaintiff believes Silgan will sue for antitrust claims, or 
will not sue, is not determinative for pleading standards. Accordingly, plaintiff does not fall within this exception. "
361,6," Plaintiff alleges that until 2006, U.S.Steel competed with UPI in Tin Mill Products in the Western United States. Its prices were 
competitive with UPI because U.S.Steel had 2 forms of price reduction. U.S. Steel offered competitive pricing by ""quarter-inch 
width surplus"" which excludes from the price, the cost of certain material lost in the process of making Tin Mill Products. The 
other means of price competition was through ""freight equalization"" which removed the price disadvantage resulting from 
transportation costs incurred from transporting Tin Mill  [**36] Products to the Western United States. (Doc. 235, SAC ¶8.) "
363,7," Plaintiff alleged a market allocation agreement which resulted from the formation of UPI. (Doc. 216, FAC ¶123.) "
364,8," Plaintiff cites Standard Iron Works v. ArcelorMittal, 639 F. Supp. 2d 877 (N.D. Ill. 2009). In Standard Iron, the court denied a 
motion to dismiss finding that plaintiffs, direct purchasers of steel, adequately alleged that the domestic steel market is 
concentrated in the hands of a relatively few producers, and that defendants' coordinated production cuts further exacerbated a 
steel supply shortage, thus squeezing the market and inflating the prevailing market price for steel. The court found that 
plaintiffs, although alleging no specific evidence for a conspiracy, adequately distinguished defendants' acts from that of parallel

383,61," See King Mem. at 5-6; King's Reply at 6-8. Though Defendants moved to dismiss on grounds that SigmaPharm has not adequately pleaded harm to competition, they did 
so largely in the context of the standing inquiry. See King Mem. at 15 (Sigmapharm cannot prove its injury was caused by the 
agreement where the generic had not been approved and King held a valid patent); King Reply at 10 (citing Warfield Phila. L.P.

2009)  [**22] in which antitrust injury was evaluated). But SigmaPharm has pleaded a per se violation, see FAC at ¶ 98 (naked, 
horizontal restraint of trade), for which the harm to the marketplace is ordinarily presumed. See Pace Elecs., Inc. v. Canon 
Computer Sys., Inc., 213 F.3d 118, 123 (3d Cir. 2000). And Defendants did not argue in either their moving brief or their reply 
that the rule of reason test, applied by some courts evaluating pay-for-delay patent infringement settlements applies here, or that 
Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded that the alleged agreement exceeded the scope of the relevant patents, as some courts 
have required under that test. See King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc., v. Cepahlon, Inc., 702 F. Supp. 2d 514, 524-28 (E.D. Pa. "

and the Complaint does not allege a pay-for-delay settlement, the Court declines to reach that issue. See Schering-Plough Corp. 
v. F.T.C., 402 F.3d 1056, 1066 n.14 (11th Cir. 2005) (noting a ""critical difference"" between agreements that resolve litigation, to 
which rule-of-reason applies, and those that do not permit a generic company to market its product before patent expiration and 
which prolong rather than resolve a patent infringement action, for which a per se rule may be appropriate) (citing In re

(stating that the Sherman Act ""does not restrict the long recognized right of [a] trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely 
private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.""). Moreover, even if a

397,1," The claim for trademark infringement arises because Adobe alleges that Norwood used images similar or identical to Adobe's 
trademarks to confuse consumers and to promote their products. Compl., at ¶ 16. "
399,2," Norwood also names ""Does 1-10"" in her complaint, defining them as ""principals, supervisory employees, employees, agents, or 
associates of Adobe and/or SIIA."" As such, the doe defendants could not be named as conspirators with Adobe or SIIA. Id. at ¶ 
4."
399,3," At the hearing, Adobe argued that a state-law unfair competition claim predicated on copyright misuse would be preempted by 
the federal Copyright Act, but did not brief this matter. Norwood did not articulate such  [*11] a basis for her unfair competition 
claim and the Court will address preemption, if necessary, when Norwood submits her amended counterclaims."
399,4, The request for judicial notice filed by Adobe and SIIA is DENIED as moot. 
400,5," Norwood attempts to supplement her claim by offering a declaration that was filed with her opposition. Adobe argues that this 
declaration should not be considered because it is outside the scope of the initial pleading. However, the declaration only offers 
conclusory allegations of the legitimacy of Norwood's purchase, without giving further detail as to whether title was transferred. 
See Norwood Decl., ¶¶ 2-3. Norwood's allegation that ""[t]he third party distributor has provided written assurance that the copies

403,1," Plaintiffs' amended complaint was filed on March 18, 2010. Defendant SESAC filed its motion to dismiss on May 17, 2010. 
Plaintiffs filed an opposition brief on June 28, 2010, and SESAC filed a reply on July 19, 2010. Oral argument was held on 
January 24, 2011."
403,2," The facts below are drawn from the amended complaint. For purposes of reviewing this motion to dismiss, all nonconclusory 
allegations are accepted as true. See S. Cherry St., LLC v. Hennessee Grp. LLC, 573 F.3d 98, 100 (2d Cir. 2009). "
404,3," As a result, the licensing of music performance rights for these programs is not at issue in this case."
404,4," The remainder of third-party programming consists of movies, sports, religious programming, and infomercials. Am. Compl. at ¶ 
5."
404,5, We note that the complaint contains no numerical comparison of prices. 
405,6, Plaintiffs never actually identify what percentage of all copyrighted musical compositions are in the SESAC repertory.
405,7," These include composers who have compositions that are either (i) ""embedded in  [*10] established syndicated and unlicensed 
network programming to which [p]laintiffs have made substantial and irreversible commitments,"" (ii) incorporated in plaintiffs' 
locally produced programs, or (iii) included in commercials. Syndicated programs containing SESAC songs include Seinfeld, 
Two & A Half Men, Will & Grace, Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, Entertainment Tonight, Dr. Oz, Dr. Phil, and The Ellen 
DeGeneres Show. Id. at ¶ 30. "
407,8," SESAC does not dispute that the relevant geographic market is the United States and its territories. Thus, we limit our analysis 
to the relevant product market. "
408,9," Similarly, in Maris Distributing Co. v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 302 F.3d 1207, 1209-10 (11th Cir. 2002), a beer distributor 
(plaintiff) entered into a contract  [*20] with Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (defendant), voluntarily relinquishing the distributor's ability to 
be owned, in whole or in part, by the public. See also United Farmers Agents Ass'n, Inc. v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, 89 F.3d 233 
(5th Cir. 1996) (insurance agents (plaintiffs) entered into contracts with insurer (defendant), voluntarily providing the insurer with 
authority to require the agents to purchase a certain computer from the insurer, or to use another agent's computer purchased 
from the insurer). "
409,10," Furthermore, we note that the industry practice of music being ""in the can"" (i.e., irrevocably embedded) when television 
stations acquire programs from producers was established prior to earlier (post-consent decree) challenges to both the ASCAP 
and BMI licenses. See, e.g., National Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v. Broadcast Music, Inc. (""NCTA""), 772 F.Supp. 614, 620-21 
(D.D.C. 1991) (""[W]hen the syndicated program is sold or licensed to the cable program services, the music is 'in the can,' i.e. 
indelibly part of the program. That means that cable program services do not play any role in the selection of or negotiation over 
the bundle of music rights . . . concerning syndicated programming."") Even though television stations were contractually 
prohibited from removing embedded music, the NCTA court still considered —after a trial — whether other methods of obtaining 
performance rights were available. See, e.g., id. at 634 (""In sum, cable program services do have realistically available 
alternatives to the BMI  [*27] blanket license and, therefore, the latter does not constitute a restraint of trade within the meaning 
of § 1 of the Sherman Act.""). The court found that source licensing, direct licensing, and per-program licensing were all 
realistically available alternatives to the BMI blanket license. "
411,11," SESAC's other arguments concerning the relevant market do not affect our conclusion. First, SESAC's argument that the 
market definition must be based on a consideration of whether products are interchangeable for consumers in general (e.g. radio 
stations and other users of performance rights), and not just plaintiffs (Def. Mem. at 23), is belied by the long history of 
challenges brought by television networks to the ASCAP-and BMI licenses (a history upon which SESAC relies), as well as the 
antitrust principle that ""a core group of particularly dedicated distinct customers paying distinct prices may constitute a 
recognizable submarket, whether they are dedicated because they need a complete cluster of products, because their particular 
circumstances dictate  [*32] that a product is the only realistic choice, or because they find a particular product uniquely 
attractive."" FTC v. Whole Foods Market, Inc., 548 F.3d 1028, 1039, 383 U.S. App. D.C. 341 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (internal 
quotation marks and citations omitted). Second, the market for performance rights to SESAC songs is not a market defined by a 
single ""brand"" in the traditional sense of the term. The product (or ""brand"") of the SESAC blanket license is not the product that 
defines the alleged market. In any event, a relevant market can, in some circumstances, be defined by a single product or brand. 
See Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 477-82; Newcal Indus., 513 F.3d at 1048. "
412,12," Plaintiffs argue that SESAC ""brings no new marketplace efficiencies"" because ASCAP and BMI already exist to  [*36] offer a 
product that individual composers could not offer on their own. See Pl. Mem. at 6, n.4. While it is obviously true that ASCAP and 
BMI already exist (and can provides individual copyright holders with the benefits of membership), it does not follow that SESAC 
should simply cease to exist, or that SESAC does not provide its Rightsholders with the same benefits that ASCAP and BMI 
provide."
412,13," In addition, we note that plaintiffs have not suggested that they do not have to plead a relevant product market in order to 
establish a § 1 violation. See generally Part II.B, supra. In antitrust cases governed by a per se analysis, ""it is  [*37] well settled 
that plaintiff is excused from defining the relevant product market."" In re European Rail Pass Antitrust Litig., 166 F.Supp.2d 836, 
844 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)."
412,14," See e.g., Def. Mem. at 2, n.1, 12 (citing Buffalo Broadcasting's rejection of local stations' claim that the blanket license 
precluded direct licensing because plaintiffs failed to produce evidence that stations actually offered money to composers for the 
performing rights to their music); id. (citing Buffalo Broadcasting's rejection of claim that source licensing was not an alternative 
because plaintiffs had made no significant attempt to acquire source licensing); id. at 11, n.8 (citing the NCTA court's finding that 
there was competition among composers to have their works included in broadcast programming); id. at 12 (citing the NCTA 
court's rejection of plaintiffs' claim that there was a lack of competition among composers). "
413,15," It strikes this Court — based on the history of litigation in this industry, the parties' briefs, and the oral argument — that, purely 
as a practical matter, the core of the dispute between the parties could be resolved with relatively minor adjustments. The fact 
that plaintiffs did not bring an antitrust action against SESAC for decades, and that this lawsuit was only filed after changes to "
414,," SESAC's per-program license, speaks to the possibility of an acceptable licensing framework (and one that would likely not raise 
antitrust issues)."
414,16," Relying on Judge Winter's concurring opinion in Buffalo Broadcasting, SESAC also argues that ""separate bilateral agreements 
between SESAC and its members, as alleged by Plaintiffs, cannot restrain trade."" Def. Mem. at 13. In Buffalo Broadcasting, 
Judge Winter stated that ""so long as composers or producers  [*45] have no horizontal agreement among themselves to refrain 
from source or direct licensing and there is no other artificial barrier, such as a statute, to their use, a non-exclusive blanket 
license cannot restrain competition."" 744 F.2d at 934 (Winter, J., concurring). As Magistrate Judge Dolinger noted in an opinion 
concerning ASCAP's blanket license fee, ""it appears that the other members of the panel were not prepared to adhere to that 
conclusion."" See American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers v. Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc., 912 F.2d 563, 
584 n.24 (2d. Cir. 1990)(attaching Magistrate Judge Dolinger's opinion in the appendix). Rather, the Second Circuit in Buffalo 
Broadcasting stated that ""the context in which the blanket license is challenged can have a significant bearing on the outcome."" 
744 F.2d at 933."

435,3," Plaintiffs' trade libel claim is now based entirely on eBay's emails. Despite this fact, plaintiffs oppose eBay's motion with respect 
to trade libel and tortious interference claims in their Opposition to PNG's motion to dismiss, allowing them to file a 35 page 
opposition to eBay's motion, despite this court's two prior orders requiring that they comply with the local rules regarding the 
length of their opposition.  [*28] Given plaintiffs' failure to comply with the local rules, the court ignores this portion of the plaintiffs 
PNG Opposition regarding eBay's Motion (PNG Opp. at 15-25). But even if the court were to consider these arguments, they are 
insufficient to overcome the defendants motion to dismiss. "
436,4," See Exh. D attached to TAC. The subject line of the email reads ""eBay Listing Removed: Counterfeit Currency and Stamps."" 
The email also states that the listing was removed ""because it violated the eBay Currency and Stamps policy. We notified

457,1," Share penetration targets are different from volume targets. A share penetration target is based solely on the percentage of the 
OEM's trucks that incorporate defendant's transmissions. (D.I. 231 at 862:18-863:2) So, for example, 92% of Freightliner's 
 [**4] trucks needed to incorporate defendants' transmissions in order to meet its penetration goal. If Freightliner built only one 
truck in a given year and it incorporated defendant's transmission, Freightliner would still meet its 92% share penetration target."
457,2," A data book is a term of art in the trucking industry. It represents the truck broken down into its core components, and provides 
the customer with a list of options when building the truck. (D.I. 229 at 320:1-16) For example, in the ""seats"" section of the data 
book, the customer may have a choice between Sears brand seats or Bostrom brand seats. (Id.) The same applies for other 
components such as engines and transmissions. (Id.)"
457,3, Many of the LTAs included additional benefits such as dedicated engineering support. 
459,4," For example, HN8[
] the Supreme Court recently held that minimum resale price maintenance was not per se illegal because 
it can create competition in the form of retailer services. Leegin Creative Leather Prods., 551 U.S. at 903-905. Minimum resale "
460,," price maintenance involves a manufacturer dictating the price retail sellers can charge. While this may lead to higher prices, it (in 
theory) also can lead to increased customer service. As the Supreme Court reasoned: Absent vertical price restraints, the retail services that enhance  [**13] interbrand competition might be underprovided. This 
is because discounting retailers can free ride on retailers who furnish services and then capture some of the increased 
demand those services generate. Consumers might learn, for example, about the benefits of a manufacturer's product from 
a retailer that invests in fine showrooms, offers product demonstrations, or hires and trains knowledgeable employees. Or 
consumers might decide to buy the product because they see it in a retail establishment that has a reputation for selling 
high-quality merchandise. If the consumer can then buy the product from a retailer that discounts because it has not spent 
capital providing services or developing a quality reputation, the high-service retailer will lose sales to the discounter, 
forcing it to cut back its services to a level lower than consumers would otherwise prefer. Minimum resale price 
maintenance alleviates the problem because it prevents the discounter from undercutting the service provider. With price 
competition decreased, the manufacturer's retailers compete among themselves over services. Id. at 890-91 (internal citations omitted). "
461,5," For example, Mr. Lutz, a ZF employee, told the jury his ""understanding"" that Volvo/Mack was ""scared to give business to us 
because they fear they will be penalized by [defendant] on the products which we cannot give them and they would still have to 
purchase from [defendant]."" (D.I. 232 at 999:7-1000:14) Mr. Martello, president of ZFM, opined that the OEMs were ""afraid"" 
defendant would ""give them a much higher price on the products that we could not protect[.]"" (D.I. 233 at 1180:9-1181:14, 
1189:14-19) Mr. Kline, Vice President of Meritor's  [**19] truck division, told the jury that OEM customers purportedly ""explained"" 
to him that ""there were very, very restrictive agreements in place."" (D.I. 230 at 490:12-22) "
462,6," The testimony of Mr. Kline was also admitted over a hearsay objection, and not an improper opinion objection. (D.I. 230 at

462,7," The court notes that ""not an expert"" is all but synonymous with ""improper lay opinion."""

Although foreign companies may have entered the market had defendant introduced a small but significant and non-transitory

477,1," Kolon counterclaimed under Section 16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26, ""to prevent and restrain violations of Section 2 of 
the Sherman Act."" [J.A. 554] "
479,2," The complaint in Tampa Electric raised claims under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1  [**10] and the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 
12. The Supreme Court's analysis addressed only the Clayton Act claims and then stated that, because the conduct at issue did 
not run afoul of the Clayton Act, it also was not forbidden by the Sherman Act. Tampa Electric, 365 U.S. at 335. HN11[
] 
Tampa Electric's relevant geographic market framework is applied routinely in Sherman Act cases. See, e.g., Consul, 805 F.2d 
at 495; RCM Supply, 686 F.2d at 1076-77; Am. Football League v. Nat'l Football League, 323 F.2d 124, 129 (4th Cir. 1963). "
480,3," While Todd focused on relevant product market definition, HN15[
] the Supreme Court has recognized that ""[t]he criteria to be 
used in determining the appropriate geographic market are essentially similar to those used to determine the relevant product 
market."" Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 336."
480,4," Paragraph 24 of the Counterclaim states: The relevant geographic market is worldwide supply of para-aramid fiber to commercial purchasers in the United States. 
The geographic market includes foreign supply practicably available to U.S. commercial purchasers, but the extent and 
nature of that supply is not known and will have the be determined on a  [**16] factual record. Competition for U.S. 
commercial para-aramid buyers occurs in the United States where the buyers are located. Many U.S. buyers require 
particular qualification analysis and tests for their specific commercial uses. And prices in the United States are distinct from "
481,," other nations. There are only five global producers of para-aramid fiber. DuPont is the only domestic producer. Teijin is the 
only other supplier to U.S. commercial customers, but the amount of its supply and shipments to the United States for 
commercial use are not known. Its capacity to divert production for supply to United States commercial customers also is 
not known. Accordingly, the extend of its production that should be included in the market definition and market share 
calculations must be left for factual determination. Kolon is the only other manufacturer that supplies commercial customers 
in the United States, and its sales to date are de minimis. Kamenskvolokno and Yenta Spandex do not supply commercial 
customers or otherwise ship para-aramid fiber into the United States. [J.A. 561]"
481,5," At other points in its opinion, the district court also refers to the necessity of including in the relevant geographic market those 
places where sellers ""operate"" and ""produce."" [J.A. 739-741]"
481,6," The district court's use of the word ""evidence"" in this context underscores the district court's failure to adhere to the strict 
standards of what may be considered—the Counterclaim—and who benefits  [**19] from the inferences drawn therefrom—the 
non-movant—on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. This problem is addressed in some detail below."
481,7," While we otherwise would hesitate to give such extensive treatment to a law review article, we do so here because the district 
court heavily relied on this one in granting DuPont's motion to dismiss. "
482,8," Moreover, the Landes and Posner article has been the target of considerable criticism for its failure to take into account 
commercial realities in international trade cases. See, e.g., Robert Pitofsky, New Definitions of Relevant Market and the Assault

Harv. L. Rev. 1817, 1835-48 (1982). Its critics warned that Landes's and Posner's ""logic is applicable in only the rarest of cases,"" 
Kaplow, supra, at 1836, and ""may lead to faulty estimates of market power."" Brennan, supra, at 1849. For example, Landes and 
Posner indicated  [**22] that their logic ""holds only if the foreign and domestic products are perfectly identical."" Landes & 
Posner, supra, at 965. But ""[m]ost products do vary somewhat across brands, at least as perceived by consumers. Ordinarily, 
antitrust analysis treats substantially similar products as though they were identical, because any error thereby introduced is 
insignificant. But with Landes and Posner's rule for geographical market definition, the resulting error is overwhelming, because 
even modest imports dictate the inclusion of all foreign production."" Kaplow, supra, at 1836 (footnote omitted). Further, Landes 
and Posner were criticized for failing to account for, among other things, foreign suppliers' difficulties in diverting potential 
alternative supplies, transportation and tariff costs, and other barriers to importation. See, e.g., Brennan, supra at 1849-50. "

487,12," While Kolon did not allege a specific percentage of market foreclosure in its Counterclaim, it would be problematic to reject its 
Counterclaim, with its extensive factual allegations, solely on that basis at the prediscovery, motion-to-dismiss stage, when 
Kolon likely has insufficient information to calculate a precise number. In contrast, Microsoft, 253 F.3d 34, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 
330, and Tampa Electric, 365 U.S. 320, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580, in which foreclosure percentages were determined, were 
decided after a bench trial and on summary judgment, respectively. "
493,1," The Bandag method of retreading tires is also known as the pre-cure, or cold-bonding method. The most prevalent alternative 
retread method is the mold cure method. "
494,2," Both Bandag-brand curing envelopes and DuraCure curing envelopes are available through the Q-Fund. The Court assumes 
that Bandag has a financial incentive in the sale of DuraCure curing envelopes, and for the rest of the opinion, refers to both 
brands as simply Bandag curing envelopes."
494,3, The total price per pound of pre-cured tread rubber after the price increase was $2.40.
494,4," This is the only market definition under which Bandag might conceivably exercise monopoly power. Shamrock claims that the 
relevant geographic market for all counts is the United States. Bandag has not disputed defining the relevant geographic market 
as such, therefore the Court accepts Shamrock's proposed geographic market definition. "
495,5," Shamrock never claimed that it suffered a decline in its sales of ""accessories,"" and it never provided any facts sufficient to 
establish an antitrust injury with regard to accessories. Thus, the Court finds that Shamrock does not have standing to bring a 
claim relating to Bandag's sale of accessories, and that it is necessary to limit the definition of the tying product to curing 
envelopes. "
496,6," In its complaint, Shamrock alleges that millions of dollars of the tied products are affected. Bandag does not dispute this claim, 
thus the Court accepts that Shamrock has satisfied the third element of the per se tying claim test."
496,7," See Data Gen. Corp. V. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 36 F.3d 1147, 1180 (1st Cir. 1994), abrogated on other grounds by 
Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2010); Amerinet, Inc. v. Xerox Corp., 972 F.2d 1483, 1500 
(8th Cir. 1992). Courts have also inferred the existence of a tying arrangement where the circumstances surrounding a 
transaction, for all practical purposes, force a buyer  [**14] into purchasing the tied product. See Tic-X-Press, Inc. v. Omni 
Promotions Co., 815 F.2d 1407, 1418 (11th Cir. 1987); Tire Sales Corp. v. Cities Service Oil Co., 637 F.2d 467, 474 (7th Cir. 
1980); Bogosian v. Gulf Oil, Co., 561 F.2d 434, 452 (3rd Cir. 1977), abrogated on other grounds by Bell Atlantic Corp. v. 
Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); Heatransfer Corp. v. Volkswagen, A.G., 553 F.2d 964, 977 
(5th Cir. 1977); Advance Bus. Sys. v. SCM Corp., 415 F.2d 55, 64 (4th Cir. 1969). "
497,8," Absent significant economic power over a relevant market, Shamrock could have a claim only under a Rule of Reason 
analysis."
497,9," The evidence that retread tires and new tires were roughly equal in cost could change this analysis. No one has suggested that 
this is true. "
498,10," Formerly, courts allowed plaintiffs to establish a presumption of market power by showing that a defendant had a competitive 
advantage due to the uniqueness of the tying product or due to legal barriers, such as a trademark, copyright, or patent. 
However, The Supreme Court's decision in Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 
(2006), rejects the legitimacy of such a presumption, particularly as it pertains to patents. Ill. Tool Works, 547 U.S. at 45. "
500,11," See Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F.2d 704, 725 (7th Cir. 1979) (Court affirmed district court's invalidation of

Refrigeration Corp., 463 F.2d 1002, 1016 (5th Cir. 1972) (Where franchisor required, by way of contractual agreement, that 
franchisees purchase parts manufactured by the franchisor,  [**27] Court found that jury should have been instructed that the 
requirement is a per se tying arrangement); Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43, 51-52 (9th Cir. 1971) (Court affirmed 
district court's invalidation of requirement in franchise agreement that franchisees purchase certain equipment and packaging

Domino's possessed market power, plaintiffs might have a valid tying claim in spite of the fact that Domino's established the 
tying arrangement by way of its franchise agreement); Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 712-13 
(11th Cir. 1984) (franchisor required that its franchisees purchase equipment and vending services from approved suppliers, and 
Court held that if plaintiffs could establish that the only approved suppliers were those with whom the franchisor had a financial 
relationship, they could prove the existence of an illegal tying arrangement); Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp., v. Diversified 
Packaging Corp., 549 F.2d 368, 372 (5th Cir. 1977) (Court affirmed district court's decision in favor of franchisor, but in doing 
 [**28] so, said, ""we find that franchisors must walk a narrow path when including in their franchise agreements clauses requiring 
franchisees to buy supplies from approved sources""). "
504,*," Hon. Charles N. Clevert, Jr., Chief Judge of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, is sitting by designation. "
505,1," For much of the opinion, we cite to one part of the Illinois statutes, specifically 65 ILCS 5/11-19-1, et seq. Further references 
will cite to each part with the Act as § 1 and so forth. "
506,2," Plaintiffs  [**10] have not alleged in the complaint, or argued here or below, that the municipalities have made contracts for the 
removal of waste that is exempted under § 2 and thus beyond the municipalities' power to contract. And our opinion in no way 
speaks to such contracts. "
507,3," The precise interplay between the Act and the statutes governing the Environmental Protection  [**12] Agency and its authority 
over municipalities is beyond the questions presented here, and nothing in our opinion should be read to express an opinion on 
it. The issue has not been briefed. "
536,1," These allegations also set this case apart from this Court's previous order in Motorola, Inc. v. Au Optronics Corp., et al., 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65037, 2010 WL 2610641 (N.D. Cal. June 28, 2010). Whereas the plaintiff in Motorola alleged only ""that 
defendants engaged in a 'global conspiracy' that impacted 'global prices' and that Motorola's foreign affiliates 'suffered injury as 
a result of defendants' antitrust violations,"" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65037, [WL] at *7, Dell alleges that a domestically negotiated 
contract set the framework for the global pricing of all of Dell's TFT-LCD Product purchases from defendants worldwide."
536,2," The allegations in plaintiff's complaint must be accepted as true for these purposes. See Miranda v. Reno, 238 F.3d at 1157, 
n.1. "
537,3," Because the Court finds that it has jurisdiction over Dell's antitrust causes of action under the FTAIA, it need not reach 
defendants' argument based on the Supremacy Clause that the Court does not have jurisdiction over Dell's state antitrust 
causes of action."
537,4," Neither party disputes the enforceability of the choice-of-law provisions, and the Court therefore assumes without deciding that 
each of the clauses is enforceable. "
541,1," To the extent any information filed under seal is discussed in this Opinion, that information is hereby unsealed in light of the 
strong presumption of public access."
541,2," Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Texas settled with these manufacturers prior to the consummation of the MSA."
541,3," The NPM Adjustment only comes into play if: (1) an economic consulting firm determines that disadvantages experienced as a 
result of the MSA were a ""significant factor contributing to the Market Share Loss"" (MSA § IX(d)(1)(C)); and (2) the Settling State 
receiving MSA payments has not passed or enforced an Escrow Statute. (MSA § IX(d)(2)). ""An arbitrator has found that 
disadvantages in the MSA were a significant factor in the increase in NPM Market Share for the years 2003-2005, but to date no 
State has been found to lack a qualifying statute or to have failed to have diligently enforced its qualifying statute."" (Gruber Rep. 
¶ 4). "
543,4," Judge Hellerstein attributed the decline in total NPM market share from 2003 to 2007 to the fact that General Tobacco, a large 
NPM, joined the MSA as an SPM in July of 2004. Freedom Holdings, Inc. v. Cuomo, 592 F. Supp. 2d 684, 691 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 
2009). "
544,5," As of August 2009, it appears that Grand River cigarettes are no longer sold off-reservation in Georgia. (Decl. of Steve Williams 
at ¶ 11). "
546,6," The Court notes that there are serious conceptual issues with Dr. Eisenstadt's ""shedding"" market share theory. First, it 
assumes that OPMs shed market share to NPMs but not to SPMs, an outcome that is simply not in the power of the OPMs to 
control. Additionally, it ignores the fact that increased competition from NPMs alone is not enough to trigger the NPM 
Adjustment. No matter how much market share OPMs lose to NPMs, the NPM Adjustment will not apply in a Settling State that 
has passed and diligently enforced an Escrow Statute, nor will it apply without a finding that the disadvantages of the MSA were 
a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share. Thus, the MSA itself may derail  [**24] Dr. Eisenstadt's incentive 
theory if OPMs are never able to recoup lost profits with the NPM Adjustment. However, these concerns stem from Dr. 
Eisenstadt's conclusions, not his methodology, and therefore are not grounds for exclusion. "
548,7, The Court assumes that Plaintiff has Article III standing. The States have not suggested otherwise. 
551,8," Therefore, the Court need not decide the parties' countless disputes about which expert used the correct methodology to 
calculate MSA-related costs, which expert contradicted himself, and so on. As Dr. Eisenstadt's OPM market share ""shedding"" 
theory has no bearing on any anticompetitive aspect of the Escrow Statutes, it is irrelevant to Plaintiff's opposition to summary 
judgment on the Sherman Act preemption claim. "
553,9," Based on that opinion, this Court reinstated Grand River's Sherman Act claim. See Grand River, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35614, 
2004 WL 1594869, at *2-3. "
559,10, There is no evidence that Grand River or its distributors has ever sold any Grand River cigarettes in Missouri. 
579,1," Plaintiffs provided the names of seventeen assignors in their opposition to the motion to dismiss; this sampling of assignors 
reveals the names of several named parties in the MDL. "
581,2," On March 4, 2011, the Court granted plaintiff AT&T Mobility's motion to certify under 28 U.S.C. § 1292 this Court's November 
12, 2010 order dismissing in part plaintiffs' second amended complaint. Docket No. 2522. The question certified for interlocutory 
review is whether AT&T can allege California Cartwright Act claims based on purchases that occurred outside of California."
581,3," If the assigned claims were made pursuant to contracts with choice-of-law provisions, a different analysis may be appropriate. "
586,1," The Oregon Antitrust Act consists of ORS sections 646.705 through 646.836 and addresses a broad range of behavior. The 
Illinois Brick repealer statute, a subsection of the Oregon Antitrust Act, was drafted to permit both direct and indirect purchasers 
to bring suit under Oregon's antitrust laws. ORS §§ 646.775, 646.780. The parties refer to the two as independent bases for 
Oregon's claims; however, Oregon failed in both its complaint and opposition to be consistent or accurate in its references to 
Oregon antitrust statutes. Oregon acknowledges this deficiency and asks for leave to amend. "
587,2," ORS Section 646.775 ""expressly permits the Oregon AG to bring a civil action to secure 'equitable relief.'"" Pl. Opp. at 14-15. "
589,3," In its opposition, Oregon mentions this statute in a footnote but failed to mention it in its complaint. The statute that is 
mentioned in the complaint, ORS § 646.770, states that ""[a]ny person including the state or any municipal corporation or political 
subdivision threatened with injury in its business or property by a violation of ORS 646.725 or 646.730 may prosecute a suit for 
equitable relief . . . ."" "
590,4," If Oregon is able to locate authority in support of its contention that it may bring a parens patriae claim on behalf of indirect 
purchasers for conduct occurring before January 1, 2002, it may allege such claims, with citation to such authority, in the 
amended complaint. "
604,1," In making this determination, the Court departs from the ruling in Sun II that, although the act of negotiating an inflated global 
price might be a ""domestic effect"" of the conspiracy, such effect cannot proximately  [**37] cause the payment of higher prices 
abroad. Sun II, 534 F. Supp. 2d at 1115. Based on the allegations in the SAC, Motorola has alleged facts that would establish 
that the domestically negotiated price was identical for purchases both inside and outside the United States. This is sufficient to 
establish the necessary proximate link between the domestic effects of the conspiracy and Motorola's foreign injury. "
605,2," Because the Court finds that it has jurisdiction over Motorola's antitrust causes of action under the FTAIA, it need not reach 
defendants' argument based on the Supremacy Clause that the Court does not have jurisdiction over Motorola's state law 
causes of action. "
610,1," The extent to which claims are asserted directly by the individual plaintiff, Aby George, who is alleged to be the 
""owner/operator"" of Skyline Travel, is unclear. The Court uses the collective term ""Plaintiffs"" here, as it is used frequently in the 
Amended Complaint."
610,2, Both parties rely on New York law. 
620,1," Excluded from each Rule 23(b)  [*10] class are: (1) all persons or entities that make a timely election to be excluded from the 
proposed Class; (2) Sirius XM and its legal representatives, officers, directors, assignees and successors; (3) governmental 
entities; and (4) the judges to whom this case is assigned and any immediate family members thereof."
620,2, Plaintiffs move to certify the Injunctive Relief Class under Fed. R Civ. P. 23(b)(2). 
621,3," Plaintiffs move to certify the Federal Antitrust Damage Class under Fed. R Civ. P. 23(b)(3) for federal antitrust violations of 
Section 7 of the Clayton Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act."
621,4, Plaintiffs move to certify the Breach of Contract Class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).
621,5, Plaintiffs move to certify the Consumer Protection Class under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). 
623,6," Defendant's  [*17] make no challenge to the qualification, experience and ability of the attorneys here. "
626,7," Although this argument may be deemed moot if the relevant product market is limited to SDARS because Defendant is the only 
provider of SDARS in any U.S. location, the definition of the relevant product market remains in debate at the present time and 
the ""district court is not permitted to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of plaintiff's case at the class certification stage."" 
Heerwagen, 435 F.3d at 231. Thus, this Court must still determine at this stage whether issues of class-wide proof with respect 
to the relevant geographic market are likely to predominate. "
627,8," Plaintiffs move in the alternative to certify subclasses for each of the 16 states for which plaintiffs  [*32] assert a consumer 
protection claim."
627,9," In addition, although many states require ""that the deceptive act relate[] to a material fact,"" Randels v. Best Real Estate, Inc., 
243 Ill. App. 3d 801, 805, 612 N.E.2d 984, 184 Ill. Dec. 108 (2d Dist. 1993), the standards of materiality are not entirely 
consistent among the states."
627,10," Plaintiff's alternative request to certify classes based on individual laws would likely alleviate this particular concern as each 
statute raises the same issues of law for all claims brought under that statute. "
628,11," In stating this proposition, Hoxworth cited to Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. U. S., 406 U.S. 128, 92 S. Ct. 1456, 31 L. Ed. 2d 
741, (1972). In that case the U.S. Supreme Court states, ""[u]nder the circumstances of this case, involving primarily a failure to 
disclose, positive proof of reliance is not a prerequisite to recovery. All that is necessary is that the facts withheld be material in 
the sense that a reasonable investor might have considered them important in the making of this decision."" Id. at 153-54 (citation 
omitted)."
628,12," Stated another way, following the chain of cases that gave rise to the rule relied on in Markocki, this Court cannot  [*39] say 
that a reasonable subscriber of satellite radio might consider Defendant's explanation for its price increases listed on its website 
to be important in the decision of whether or not to maintain a subscription. "
643,1," Due to the confidential nature of information in this litigation and consistent with the Stipulated Interim Protective Order (Doc. 
No. 16), the Court will refer to such information as X, Y, or Z, as necessary, in these Findings of Fact. "
685,2," Arch Coal is distinguishable in numerous other ways: inter alia, the transaction at issue involved coal reserves that, once 
depleted, could never be replenished, making the financial decline of the acquired company irreversible; and the transaction did 
not result in a decrease in the number of competitors in the market."
685,3," Defendant relies on United States v. Long Island Jewish Med. Ctr., 983 F. Supp. 121 (E.D.N.Y. 1997) to argue that this Court 
may accept price increases because they are purportedly not ""supracompetitive."" However, the court in Long Island Jewish 
Medical Center did not condone price increases; rather, it concluded that prices would not increase at all as a result of the 
merger. Id. at 145  [*160] (""In sum, the evidence in this case indicates that, in the event the merger is consummated, it is unlikely 
that there will be a price increase.""). "
692,1," Familiarity with this Court's prior Memoranda and Orders and the opinions of the Court of Appeals is presumed. See In re 
Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litig., 264 F.R.D. 100 (S.D.N.Y. 2010); In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litig., 263 
F.R.D. 110 (S.D.N.Y. 2009); Ross v. Am. Express Co., 547 F.3d 137 (2d Cir. 2008); Ross v. Am. Express Co., 478 F.3d 96 (2d 
Cir. 2007); Ross v. Am. Express Co., No. 04 Civ. 5723, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67358, 2006 WL 2707393 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 
2006); Ross v. Am. Express Co., No. 04 Civ. 5723, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21084, 2005 WL 2364969 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2005). "
695,2," While Sundheim did not expressly mention  [**15] the TILA, that statute was implemented by Regulation Z. See 12 CFR § 226 
et. seq. "
696,3," Amex also cites a May 9, 1999 Los Angeles Times article stating that Amex was not having second thoughts about 
implementing an FX Fee increase. (Chesler Decl. Ex. B.) Even if this statement could withstand Plaintiffs' hearsay objections 
(see Letter from M. Davidoff to the Court dated Sept. 8, 2010 at 2), its probative value is minimal. Amex's public statements 
committing to the increase do not demonstrate any lack of participation in the conspiracy. "
697,4," While Amex also cites a report by expert Bruce Owen, that report relies on the same testimony by DiSimone. (Grayer Decl. Ex. 
E: Expert Report of Bruce M. Owen dated Feb. 14, 2005 at  [**21] 26.) "
702,5," This document could also be a written summary of what occurred at the May 28 meeting, suggesting that the confirmation of 
the FX Fee increase could have been received after that meeting. In either case, the document supports the inference that Amex 
did not finalize its decision until late May 1999. "
704,6," That there is no direct evidence  [**49] of certain of the Banks' participation in these discussions does not negate an inference 
that a conspiracy existed among them. See In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig., 385 F.3d 350, 363 (3d Cir. 2004)."
704,7," The May 25 Meeting would have required planning in advance during the same months in which in-house counsel for the 
Banks and Greene were discussing disclosure issues. "
708,1," This order addresses the F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss brought by defendants Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (""Ocwen""), 
Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.  [*2] (""MERS""), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (""Freddie Mac""). 
This Court will refer to Ocwen, MERS and Freddie Mac collectively as the ""moving defendants."" Defendant Bank of America, 
N.A., successor in interest to Countrywide Bank, FSB (""Countrywide""), filed its separate F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss 
which this Court addresses in a separate order. "
709,2," The factual recitation is derived generally from Ms. Dooms' operative Verified Complaint (""complaint""), documents attached to 
the complaint, and matters of which this Court may take judicial notice."
709,3," The complaint makes numerous references to ""Defendants."" This Court presumes that such reference is to the moving 
defendants, Countrywide and Cal-Western Reconveyance collectively."
709,4, All documents pertaining to Ms. Dooms' loan and foreclosure proceedings were recorded with the Fresno County Recorder. 
712,5," ""We  [*14] have extended the 'incorporation by reference' doctrine to situations in which the plaintiff's claim depends on the 
contents of a document, the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss, and the parties do not dispute the 
authenticity of the document, even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the complaint."" 
Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing Parrino, 146 F.3d at 706). "
717,6," F.R.Civ.P. 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies  [*31] to state law causes of action: ""[W]hile a federal court will examine state 
law to determine whether the elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of action, the Rule 9(b) requirement 
that the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity is a federally imposed rule."" Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 
317 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1995)(italics in original))."
717,7," ""In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the 
basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be 'grounded in fraud' or to 'sound in fraud,' and the pleading of that claim as a 
whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)."" Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103-1104. "
726,8," Sua sponte dismissal of Ms. Dooms' claims renders moot her request to continue the April 25, 2011 hearing. "
735,1," Because the parties' briefs sufficiently set forth the pertinent issues, the Court in its discretion denies plaintiffs' request for oral 
argument on the motion for review. "
736,2," The Magistrate Judge extended the time for plaintiffs' motion for review from the first Memorandum and Order until after the 
motion to compel had been resolved by the second Memorandum and Order. The Magistrate Judge also granted plaintiffs' 
motion for a stay of the discovery pending the resolution of the present motion for review. "
738,3," The Court does not mean to suggest that plaintiffs were not entitled to pursue these procedural avenues for relief. The fact 
remains, however, that plaintiffs themselves are responsible for much of the delay about which they complain, by filing motions 
that ultimately proved to lack merit. "
739,4," Plaintiffs suggest that defendants improperly broadened  [*42] the scope of this relevance argument from mere solicitation. In 
their motion to compel, however, defendants argued that evidence of plaintiffs' acceptance of price increases would be relevant. "
740,5," Plaintiffs cite to the Court's prior class certification order in this case, in which the Court concluded that ""the common issue of 
concealment will predominate because the key inquiry will focus on the defendants' conduct—that is, what the defendants did—
rather than on the plaintiffs' conduct."" See In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., 237 F.R.D. 440, 452 (D. Kan. 2006) (Lungstrum, J.). In 
finding that individual issues did not predominate, however, the Court did not conclude that there were no individual issues 
regarding fraudulent concealment. Moreover, the present direct actions do not involve a class, and thus any individualized 
defenses would be relevant, including those involving whether any particular plaintiffs in fact were lulled into accepting 
defendants' stated reasons for their price increases."
740,6," Defendants also argue that the discovery is relevant to damages and class certification issues. The Magistrate Judge did not 
address those arguments, and in light of its ruling, the Court declines to address those arguments in the first instance."
740,7," In arguing that relevance should have been considered in the context of the motion for protective order, plaintiffs point to the 
statement in Johnson ex rel. Johnson v. Olathe District Schools, 212 F.R.D. 582 (D. Kan. 2003), that ""[o]nce a party establishes 
relevance and necessity, the district court must balance the need for the information against the claim of injury resulting from 
disclosure."" See id. at 584. That test does not help plaintiffs here, however, as the Magistrate Judge did consider and find 
relevance, and plaintiffs were unable to show any injury from the disclosure. "
741,8," Plaintiffs question whether defendants are entitled to this discovery from all of the direct action plaintiffs or only from foam 
manufacturing plaintiffs,  [*50] although they state that they will seek such clarification first from the Magistrate Judge. Thus, the 
issue is not presently before this Court. "
744,1," The Non-Disclosure Agreement includes a choice of law provision specifying that California law governs. See Compl., Ex. 1, ¶ 
8. "
745,2," TCS also argues that even if there is a non-compete clause in the Non-Disclosure Agreement,  [*10] it would nevertheless be 
unenforceable as contrary to ""California's well-entrenched public policy against[] broad non-compete obligations."" Mot. 9:11-17. 
TCS cites the California Supreme Court's decision in Edwards v. Arthur Andersen LLP for that proposition, but fails to recognize 
the express statutory carve out noted by the Court for ""noncompetition agreements in the sale or dissolution of corporations . . . 
partnerships . . . and limited liability corporations."" See 44 Cal. 4th 937, 945-46, 81 Cal. Rptr. 3d 282, 189 P.3d 285 (Cal. 2008). 
Moreover, the Arthur Anderson decision and the California Code provisions permitting non-compete agreements in the sale of 
corporations, partnerships and limited liability corporations all deal with a selling person or entity's agreement not to compete 
against the purchasing entity. That is not this case. See Opp'n 17:9-10. Here, there is a potential buyer agreeing with a potential 
seller that it would not use the potential seller's confidential information to pursue other business opportunities. "
747,3," The Complaint also bases its negligent misrepresentation claim on the allegation that TCS failed to reveal the fact that it 
intended to ""open discussions"" with SB&V. As negligent misrepresentation requires ""a positive assertion or assertion of fact,"" SC 
Law cannot reframe its failure to disclose allegations as a negligent misrepresentation claim unless it also alleges that TCS had 
a duty to disclose. See Wilson, 15 Cal. App. 4th at 306; Byrum v. Brand, 219 Cal. App. 3d 926, 942, 268 Cal. Rptr. 609 (Cal. Ct. 
App. 1990) (""A representation is an essential element of a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation.""); see  [*20] also Los 
Angeles Unified School Dist. v. Great American Ins. Co., 49 Cal.4th 739, 750 n.5, 112 Cal. Rptr. 3d 230, 234 P.3d 490 (2010) 
(explaining that negligent misrepresentation may include the ""suppression of a fact, by one who is bound to disclose it, or who 
gives information of other facts which are likely to mislead for want of communication of that fact""). "
748,4, SC Law does not contest this point in their Opposition.
748,5," Because the Court dismisses SC Law's CUTSA claims as insufficiently pleaded, it need not reach TCS's argument that SC 
Law's fifth cause of action is actually one for ""inevitable disclosure."" See Mot. 12:9-17. Similarly, the Court need not address the 
pre-emptive effect that a properly alleged CUTSA claim would have on the remainder of SC Law's claims, as argued by TCS."
748,6," SC Law's only real argument in support of its antitrust claims is that its Complaint does more to allege an antitrust violation than 
what the District Court for the Eastern District of California permitted in Axiom Advisers & Consultants, Inc. v. School Innovations 
& Advocacy, Inc., No. CV 05-2395, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11404, 2006 WL 1049997 (E.D. Cal. March 20, 2006). See Opp'n 
22:18-27. In that case, the Court held that an allegation which stated, ""[defendant's] conduct has injured competition and "
749,," consumers and its acts have an anticompetitive effect of harming the competitive process, limiting consumer choice, and 
harming  [*26] consumers"" was sufficient to plead antitrust injury. Axiom Advisers, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11404, 2006 WL 
1049997, at *8. That case was decided before the Supreme Court's decisions in Iqbal and Twombly, and the Court is concerned 
that the case would come out differently now. "
750,7," TCS also argues that SC Law lacks standing to assert a UCL claim because it has not alleged an ""actual injury to date"" under 
state or federal antitrust law. See Opp'n 24:26-25:5. This argument ignores the injury SC Law suffered as a result of TCS's 
alleged breach of contract, which is one basis for the UCL claim. "

761,3," HN3[
] We have stated that ""[w]hen the Commission overrules the ALJ and substitutes its own findings, we should carefully 
scrutinize the Commission's determinations of fact, and therefore its conclusions based upon those facts."" In re Detroit Auto 
Dealers Ass'n, 955 F.2d at 469. The Supreme Court has explained, however, that consideration of the examiner's findings is 
only one of many ""other factors which in sum determine whether evidence is 'substantial,'"" Universal Camera, 340 U.S. at 497; 
thus, a court ""need not limit its reexamination of the case to the effect"" of those findings beyond ""the relevance that they 
reasonably command,"" id. "
763,4," The Commission applied the ""inherently suspect"" or ""quick-look"" analytical framework upheld by the D.C. Circuit in Polygram 
Holding, Inc. v. FTC, 416 F.3d 29, 367 U.S. App. D.C. 367 (D.C. Cir. 2005). In Polygram, the D.C. Circuit held that the 
challenged practices bore a ""close family  [**23] resemblance"" to other practices ""that already stand[] convicted in the court of 
consumer welfare."" Id. at 37. The court found unlawful ""[a]n agreement between joint venturers to restrain price cutting and 
advertising with respect to products not part of the joint venture [which] looks suspiciously like a naked price fixing agreement 
between competitors."" Id."
763,5," In Detroit Auto Dealers, we expressed reservations about applying the ""inherently suspect"" framework to an agreement among 
car dealers to limit showroom hours because the impact on competition was not ""immediately apparent,"" and we examined 
actual and potential adverse effects on competition. In re Detroit Auto Dealers Ass'n, 955 F.2d at 469-70.  [**25] However, ""in 
deference to the Commission, we [did] not . . . hold the analogy [to inherently suspect practices] erroneous."" Id. at 471-72; see 
also Worldwide Basketball, 388 F.3d at 961 (declining to apply quick-look analysis ""where the contours of the market . . . are 
[not] sufficiently well-known or defined to permit the court to ascertain without the aid of extensive market analysis whether the 
challenged practice impairs competition""). We note that Detroit Auto Dealers preceded in time the Supreme Court's decision in 
California Dental and the D.C. Circuit's Polygram decision endorsing the quick-look analysis. "
764,6," Other circuits have permitted an inference of adverse effects based on a showing of market power and anticompetitive 
tendencies. See, e.g., Craftsmen Limousine, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 491 F.3d 380, 388 (8th Cir. 2007)  [**27] (holding that 
plaintiff may prove ""detrimental effects on competition by making an inquiry into market power and market structure designed to 
assess the [restraint]'s actual effect."" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Tops Markets, Inc. v. Quality Markets, Inc., 142 F.3d 
90, 97 (2d Cir. 1998) (""A plaintiff seeking to use market power as a proxy for adverse effect must show market power, plus some 
other ground for believing that the challenged behavior could harm competition in the market, such as the inherent 
anticompetitive nature of the defendant's behavior or the structure of the interbrand market."")."
764,7," See 7 AREEDA ¶ 1511 (Supp. 2010) (""The proof of actual market effects that the ALJ insisted on would certainly be appropriate 
in  [**29] a private Sherman Act proceeding under which proof of private harm were required. . . . But in the presence of market 
power and the absence of a convincing justification the FTC's treatment of highly suspicious restraints is warranted.""). "
767,8," Despite this initial finding of anticompetitive tendencies, the ALJ ultimately credited Realcomp's procompetitive justifications 
and found insufficient the Commission's direct econometric evidence to establish an unreasonable restraint of trade."
767,9," A decline in the share of EA listings would have real implications for consumers who would otherwise purchase those listings. 
Assuming an average home sale price of  [**40] $200,000, and assuming that EA listings save home sellers half of the typical 
6% commission, an EA listing would save an individual home seller, on average, $6,000."
767,10," The Control MSAs were Charlotte, North Carolina; Dayton, Ohio; Denver, Colorado; Memphis, Tennessee; Toledo, Ohio; and 
Wichita, Kansas.  [**41] The Restriction MSAs were Green Bay/Appleton, Wisconsin; Boulder, Colorado; and Williamsburg, 
Virginia."
767,11," The ALJ faulted Dr. Williams for his selection of Control MSAs, noting that Midwestern Rust Belt cities omitted from the study 
were intuitively more similar to Detroit than the chosen MSAs, and therefore were instructive points of comparison. Increasing 
the sample size would have strengthened Dr. Williams's  [**42] findings. However, the ALJ pointed to no evidence that "
768,," comparisons to Rust Belt cities would have yielded different results. Furthermore, the Control MSAs were chosen based on a 
ranking of variables plausibly relevant to choice of home listing contracts (namely, home price change over 1 and 5 years, 
median single-family home price, education levels as measured by percentage of high school and bachelor degrees, median 
income, population size, and population density). The ALJ also theorized that if Dr. Williams had correctly identified factors that determine the share of EA contracts and then had 
chosen MSAs similar to one another, the EA shares of the Control MSAs would be very similar, but instead varied between 
1.24% and 14%. But, as the Commission noted, the values of the economic and demographic variables used as selection 
criteria could vary across MSAs in the control sample, even if related to the use of EA listings, and even if they rendered the 
selected MSAs more similar to Detroit than other cities. That the shares of EA listings in the Control MSAs were different from 
one another does not mean that the MSAs were inappropriate for comparison."
768,12," Given that the difference in absolute  [**43] terms between these shares is less than 1%, the ALJ found the difference 
insignificant. "
769,13," In statistical terms, the MSA-level variables were omitted to avoid the problem of multicollinearity. Regression analysis 
measures the effects of different factors, called independent or explanatory variables, on a particular outcome, called the 
dependent variable. The more that independent variables are correlated with one another—such as when two measures capture 
the same information—the less unique information they will each contribute to the prediction of the dependent variable. When 
predictors become more correlated, the estimate of individual regression coefficients becomes more unreliable and, thus, the 
effects of the individual independent variables become difficult to measure accurately. See JACOB COHEN ET AL., APPLIED 
MULTIPLE REGRESSION/CORRELATION ANALYSIS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES 419-420 (3d ed. 2003). Dr. Eisenstadt himself 
admitted that, while not completely duplicative, the MSA-level and county-level data were highly correlated."
769,14," Realcomp may be correct that the measure of a variable like median household income is to some extent relevant at both the 
 [**47] local and MSA-wide level, and that these measures convey different information relevant to decisions about how a home 
seller will approach the sale. If important independent variables are omitted from the analysis, their effects on the dependent 
variable may be attributed to independent variables that are included, and as a result, the causal relationship between included 
independent variables and the dependent variable may be biased. See id. at 143, 426. But, as discussed supra, including these 
variables introduced significant problems of multicollinearity, and substantial evidence supports the Commission's interpretation 
of Dr. Williams's statistical analysis."
769,15," In this appeal, Realcomp is specifically challenging the Commission's order on the basis of its conclusions  [**48] with respect 
to the website policy. As the ALJ noted, Dr. Williams did not disentangle the effects of the search-function policy, website policy, 
and minimum-services requirement, all of which were at issue when complaint counsel filed the complaint. "
770,16," The Commission's analysis is persuasive on this point, noting that EA listings disadvantage not the cooperating brokers, but 
rather ""the listing broker who signs an EA contract for less compensation than an ERTS contract would have provided, and the 
listing broker who insists upon an ERTS contract and loses a listing as a result. . . . In other words, these two categories of listing 
brokers are not losing money through free-riding; they are losing money through competition."" Pet'r App. Vol. I at 37 (Comm'n 
Op. at 31)."
770,17," The ALJ also noted that the website policy reflects the greater value of ERTS over EA contracts to the MLS because 
cooperating brokers often must deal directly with EA home sellers rather than listing brokers when engaging in EA contracts, 
and, as a result, may be required to provide transactional services that would otherwise be performed by full-service listing 
brokers. We agree with the Commission, however, that Realcomp has failed to carry its burden of demonstrating how meeting 
the preferences of cooperating brokers ultimately benefits consumers, why the price  [**53] for EA listings does not incorporate 
these costs, or how this policy in particular offers efficiency benefits. It is also worth noting that, despite Realcomp's assertions of 
the website policy's necessity, the NAR has ruled that MLSs may no longer exclude EA listings from their IDX feeds. "
778,1," At times, the parties use ""overbuilders"" as shorthand for all land-based programming providers, including both cable and fiber-
optic based companies. The Court uses the term ""Overbuilders"" to refer to telephone companies that provide television 
programming; this is the sense in which the term is most often employed in the plaintiffs' submissions. "
779,2," The previous Amended Complaint used a broader definition of Premium Cable Services than is alleged here, including 
""premium/optional channels"" and ""optional subscription channels,"" such as HBO and Showtime. (Am. Compl. ¶ 44.) "
781,3," Plaintiff relies upon the following allegations: ""In those markets controlled by Time Warner, Time Warner's control over all cable 
television services naturally gives Time Warner control over Premium Cable Services."" (Compl. ¶ 60); ""Time Warner 
 [*25] currently provides cable video programming services and leases cable boxes in communities, or clusters of communities, 
in several states."" (Compl. ¶ 86); ""Because of Time Warner's market power, the Class is forced to pay rental fees for the cable "
782,," box in addition to fees for Premium Cable Services and is deprived of the option to purchase the cable box in a free and open 
market or even directly from Time Warner or its suppliers."" (Compl. ¶ 149.) "
783,4," Nat'l Ass'n of Theatre Owners v. FCC, 420 F.2d 194, 204, 136 U.S. App. D.C. 352 (D.C. Cir. 1969), which involved FCC 
regulatory issues, observed in dictum that ""entertainment is an industry in which antitrust concepts such as product market and 
cross-elasticity of demand are exceptionally difficult to apply . . . ."" "
785,5," According to the Complaint, ""each cable MVPD operates in its own geographically divided local markets."" (Compl. ¶ 79.) With 
the exception of Premium Cable Services, the DBS companies provide programming  [*40] comparable to the programming 
provided by Time Warner and the Overbuilders. (Compl. ¶¶ 69-73.) If Paragraph 60 were construed to imply control over all 
MVPD subscription programming — meaning all programming that is provided by cable companies, Overbuilders and DBS 
companies — it would be making an assertion that is inconsistent with the balance of the Complaint. "
786,6," In their opposition memorandum, the plaintiffs assert that Time Warner ""only charges competitive prices in markets where there 
is a competing MVPD overbuilder, which is known to be less  [*45] than 2% of the areas TWC services and which areas are 
specifically excluded from the Class (Compl. ¶¶ 99, 108, 131) . . . ."" (Opp. Mem. at 14.) The Complaint alleges no such thing, 
and the paragraph citations set forth in the opposition memo do not support the proposition. In the First Amended Complaint of 
April 17, 2009, the plaintiffs explicitly excluded from their proposed class ""those Time Warner customers who receive service at 
an address at which they may receive cable television service from at least one competing cable or fiber optic video service 
provider in addition to Time Warner . . . ."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 27.) The Third Amended Complaint that is subject to the pending 
motion contains no such exclusion in its proposed class definition. (Compl. ¶ 131.) "
787,7," Bodet v. Charter Communications, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87088, 2010 WL 5094214, at *6 (E.D. La. July 26, 2010), 
evaluated market power using a similar framework, but reached the opposite conclusion. Bodet, as here, weighed allegations of 
market power against the plaintiff's successfully pleaded geographic and product markets. Id. It concluded  [*47] that ""the 
plaintiff must show that Charter has sufficient market power in every area in which it operates to coerce consumers for premium 
cable into renting set-top boxes as a condition for receiving the full premium cable product,"" and that, ""[a]lthough the plaintiff may 
have some hurdles to cross"" in ultimately proving market power, its allegations as to market power were sufficient. Id. Bodet 
relied on the assertion that ""relatively few consumers have a second wireline alternative"" to a cable MVPD provider. Id. Here, as 
noted, the Complaint alleges Overbuilder presence in 22 of 53 local markets but, as also noted, its market power allegations do 
not recognize potential competitive differences between them. "
799,1," State of Alaska v. Chevron Chemical Company, 669 F.2d 1299 (9th Cir. 1982), also cited by defendants, does not address the 
sufficiency of the pleadings, but rather whether the State of Alaska had standing to sue. "
800,2," In their reply, defendants assert that to the extent plaintiffs seek restitution under the Clayton Act, that request should also be 
stricken because restitution is unavailable under federal antitrust law for the same reasons that disgorgement is unavailable. 
See In re Multidistrict Vehicle Air Pollution, 538 F.2d 231, 234 (9th Cir. 1976). The complaint does not actually seek restitution 
under federal law. However, the Court agrees that such a request would be barred. See id. Similarly,  [**29] defendants' reply 
argues that restitution is not available under the state antitrust statutes, and that those requests must be stricken because the 
state antitrust statutes must be interpreted in harmony with the Sherman Act. Plaintiffs did not address this issue in their papers. 
If, in the amended complaint, the States wish to seek restitution under the state antitrust statutes, the amended complaint shall 
cite authority showing that such a remedy is available under those statutes. "
801,3," Defendants also argue insofar as the States assert assigned claims under their state antitrust claims, the States must allege 
that the assigned purchases took place within Michigan and Wisconsin. The States respond that this allegation has been made 
in the complaint: ""In the States of Michigan and Wisconsin, state entities bought TFT-LCD products . . . ."" Compl. ¶ 104. 
However, this allegation speaks only to the States' purchases, not the original purchases that give rise to the assigned claims. 
This Court has previously held that in order to invoke the various state antitrust laws at issue, plaintiffs must be able to allege 
that the occurrence or transaction giving rise to the litigation — plaintiffs' purchases of allegedly price-fixed goods — occurred in 
the various states. Consistent with this Court's prior decisions, the Court holds that in order to bring the assigned claims under 
the state antitrust laws, Michigan and Wisconsin must allege that the purchases were made in Michigan and Wisconsin. "
802,4," Arkansas asserts that ""[t]his Court can confidently predict that the Arkansas Supreme Court would hold that the ADTPA 
prohibits price fixing."" However, ""In assessing how a state's highest court would resolve a state law question — absent 
controlling state authority — federal courts look to existing state law without predicting potential changes in that law."" See 
Ticknor v. Choice Hotels Int'l, Inc., 265 F. 3d 931, 939 (9th Cir. 2001)."
802,5," The AUPA consists of Arkansas Code Annotated sections 4-75-201 through 4-75-320. The Illinois Brick repealer statute, a 
subsection of the AUPA, was drafted in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Illinois Brick and was designed to permit both 
direct and indirect purchasers to bring suit under Oregon's antitrust laws. Ark. Code Ann. § 4-75-315; see also 2003 Arkansas 
Laws Act 1172 (H.B. 2720), AR LEGIS 1172 (2003) (explaining that the 2003 amendments to the AUPA were enacted because 
the Arkansas Attorney General was ""unable to adequately protect the consumers . . . for harm they have suffered as indirect 
purchasers.""). "
803,6," Arkansas also argues that the presumption against retroactivity does not apply where a statute's effect is remedial, and that this 
statute is in fact remedial. Because the Court finds that section 4-75-320(c) permits retroactive application of section 4-75-315, it 
does not address Arkansas' argument regarding the statute's remedial nature. "

(2009)."
814,15," See, e.g., City P'ship Co. v. Atlantic Acquisition Ltd. P'ship, 100 F.3d 1041, 1043 (1st Cir. 1996)  [*20] (sufficient discovery and 
bargaining at arm's length creates a presumption in favor of settlement approval); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396 
F.3d 96, 116-17 (2d Cir. 2005) (factors courts consider when examining the fairness, adequacy, and reasonableness of a class

damages; (6) the risks of maintaining the class action through the trial; (7) the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater 
judgment; (8) the range of reasonableness of the settlement fund in light of the best possible recovery; and (9) the range of 
reasonableness of the settlement fund to a possible recovery in light of all the attendant risks of litigation)."
814,16," See In re Compact Disc Minimum Advertised Price Antitrust Litig., 216 F.R.D. 197, 206 (D. Me. 2003) (noting that the First 
Circuit has not adopted a specific test to evaluate class action settlements but that other circuits consider these factors); see 
also Wal-Mart Stores, 396 F.3d at 117 (considering similar factors); 4 ALBA CONTE & HERBERT B. NEWBERG, NEWBERG ON CLASS 
ACTIONS § 11:43, AT 120-21 (4th ed. 2002). THE PRINCIPLES OF AGGREGATE LITIGATION have tried to condense and rationalize 
the caselaw's multitude of factors to the following: (a) Before approving or rejecting any class-wide settlement, a court must conduct a fairness hearing. A court reviewing the 
fairness of a proposed class-action settlement must address, in on-the-record findings and conclusions, whether: (1) the class representatives and class counsel have been and currently are adequately representing the class; (2)  [*22] the relief afforded to the class (taking into account any ancillary agreement that may be part of the settlement) is 
fair and reasonable given the costs, risks, probability of success, and delays of trial and appeal; (3) class members are treated equitably (relative to each other) based on their facts and circumstances and are not 
disadvantaged by the settlement considered as a whole; and (4) the settlement was negotiated at arm's length and was not the product of collusion. "
815,," (b) The court may approve a settlement only if it finds, based on the criteria in subsection (a), that the settlement would be 
fair to the class and to every substantial segment of the class. A negative finding on any of the criteria specified in 
subsections (a)(1)-(a)(4) renders the settlement unfair. A settlement may also be found to be unfair for any other significant reason that 
may arise from the facts and circumstances of the particular case. (c) The burden is on the proponents of a settlement to establish that the settlement is fair and reasonable to the absent 
class members who are to be bound by that settlement. In reviewing a proposed settlement, a court should not apply any 
presumption that the settlement  [*23] is fair and reasonable. (d) A court may approve or disapprove a class settlement but may not of its own accord amend the settlement to add, 
delete, or modify any term. The court may, however, inform the parties that it will not approve a settlement unless the 
parties amend the agreement in a manner specified by the court. This subsection does not limit the court's authority to set 
fair and reasonable attorneys' fees. PRINCIPLES OF AGGREGATE LITIGATION § 3.05 (Judicial Review of The Fairness of A Class Settlement). The First Circuit has said 
that ""[i]f the parties negotiated at arm's length and conducted sufficient discovery, the district court must presume the settlement 
is reasonable."" In re Pharm. Indus. Average Wholesale Price Litig., 588 F.3d 24, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2009) (citing City P'ship Co., 100 
F.3d at 1043). But here I need not rely on that presumption, which commentators have attacked. See PRINCIPLES OF AGGREGATE 
LITIGATION § 3.05(c) and cmt. c (critique of presumption of fairness)."
815,17," Apart from the cash settlements, the plaintiffs obtained important value (at the time) in these defendants' promised cooperation 
in discovery during the ongoing litigation. There is modest marginal value in the settlement's additional requirement that Toyota 
and CADA not engage in any conduct that violates section 1 of the Sherman Act through December 31, 2011."
815,18," I realize that this evaluation uses hindsight, whereas the parties negotiated their settlement with what they knew then. But from 
the outset, this was an uphill case, in light of Illinois Brick and the difficulties of proving antitrust impact in a class action on behalf 
of vehicle purchasers (given the dynamics of the car purchasing market)."

816,22," Some objections are unworthy of lengthy discussion. First, Joseph Jones asserts that although he was not a class 
representative or named class member, he is entitled to a $750 incentive payment because he is ""giving up my right to sue the 
defendant with no absolute guarantee I will receive any payment from the settlement fund."" Letter of Objection (Docket Item 
1135). Mr. Jones was not deposed and, thus, he is not entitled to an incentive payment. Like all other class members, Mr. Jones 
must give up his right to sue the defendant without any guarantee of payment. (Mr. Jones had the opportunity to opt out of the 
settlement and, if he desired, bring his own action against Toyota and CADA.) Second, Kenneth Harris objects generally to the 
limited time period for which monetary recovery is available and the requirement that he must ""'declare under penalty of perjury' 
that the consumer claim form is 'true and correct.'"" Letter of Objection (Docket Item 1139). The time period has been limited by 
earlier substantive decisions that I and the Court of Appeals made  [*27] based on currency exchange rates—this is the law of 
the case. Swearing to the accuracy of the information provided on the claim form is a reasonable requirement to assure the truth 
and reliability of the claims submitted for payment from the common fund. Theodore Frank objects to the settlement in part because of the presence of a clear sailing provision. Notice of Appearance and 
Objection to Proposed Settlement and Proposed Attorneys' Fee Award at 14-15 (Docket Item 1138) (a ""clear sailing"" provision, 
which requires ""aggressive judicial scrutiny""). In Weinberger v. Great N. Nekoosa Corp., 925 F.2d 518, 520 n.1 (1st Cir. 1991), 
the court defined a ""clear sailing"" agreement as ""one where the party paying the fee agrees not to contest the amount to be 
awarded by the fee-setting court so long as the award falls beneath a negotiated ceiling."" In general, such clauses are 
objectionable because they create the likelihood that plaintiffs' counsel, in obtaining defendants' agreement not to challenge a 
fee request under a stated ceiling, will bargain away something of value to the plaintiff class. Mr. Frank's claim that these 
Settlement Agreements contain a ""clear sailing"" provision is factually  [*28] incorrect. The language in the Settlement 
Agreements upon which he relies provides: Litigation Expenses From The Escrow Funds. After (a) the Settlement becomes Final and (b) the Toyota Defendants are 
dismissed from all State Actions, Plaintiffs may, without objection from TMS, but subject to the MDL Court's approval, 
withdraw monies from the Escrow Funds to defray the litigation expenses, including necessary expenses and expert fees, 
of prosecuting claims asserted against the Other Defendants. Except for TMS's payment of the Settlement Fund, no 
Releasee will be liable for any attorneys' fees, costs or expenses of the litigation of the Litigated Actions or of this 
Settlement, including but not limited to those (a) of any of Plaintiffs' experts, counsel, consultants, agents and 
representatives; (b) incurred in giving notice; or (c) incurred in administering the Settlement or distributing the Settlement 
Fund. Toyota Settlement Agreement ¶ 19 (Docket Item 1043-1) (emphasis added); see also CADA Settlement Agreement ¶ 19 
(Docket Item 1043-3). This provision does not prevent Toyota (or CADA in the comparable provision of that Settlement 
Agreement) from objecting to the Plaintiffs' fee request;  [*29] rather it states that after the settlement is finally approved Toyota 
will not object to the Plaintiffs' withdrawal of funds from the settlement escrow account for ongoing litigation expenses. This does 
not constitute a ""clear sailing"" provision and is not improper. In fact, I permitted the plaintiffs to withdraw up to $1.325 million 
from the Toyota and CADA Settlement Funds to pay for the costs associated with the implementation of the notice plan.] Order 
Permitting Advance of Notice Costs from Settlement Funds (Docket Item 1128). (Objector Frank also objects to cy pres and 
attorney fees, topics I address later.) Joey Hutto, Jeanne Finn, Channing Carder, Deborah Colburn, Nancy Carder and Wayne Phillips d/b/a/ American Electric Motor 
Service, object in part because I am asked to award attorney fees before determining the value of benefits actually received by 
the class members, and because claim forms must be submitted before the settlement is finally approved. Objection to 
Proposed Settlement ¶¶ 11-12 (Docket Item 1140). This is a specious argument. It is because the claims have already been 
submitted that I can determine the actual value of benefits the class will receive, and obviously  [*30] any subtraction for attorney 
fees must be made before checks can be distributed to class members. The benefits will be received by all who have filed claims 
(except those who fail to cash the claim check). Moreover, the class members had both notice and a reasonable amount of time 
to file claims. "

language of the statutes to refer to potential injury to a competitor or the competitive structure, while statutes that prohibit locality 
price discrimination (§§ 17040-17042), like section 17043, are directed at the intent of the violation. The Legislature has thus

855,1," As defendants note, courts have held in the civil context that compensation for foreign injury may be barred to the extent that 
the plaintiff cannot establish an exception to the FTAIA. (Motion at 11.) This proposition, though potentially relevant to whether 
the government may seek restitution for injury caused abroad, has no bearing on whether an indictment alleging a combination 
of domestic and foreign conduct that caused injury to domestic purchasers adequately states a criminal violation of the Sherman 
Act. Defendants are, of course, not foreclosed from raising such concerns if and when the Court addresses restitution in this 
matter. "
857,1," Unless otherwise noted, the facts are drawn from the parties' statements of material facts (Docket  [*4] No. 163) and related 
affidavits and exhibits. Although facts are drawn from submissions made by both parties, on a motion for summary judgment, all 
inferences are drawn in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,

857,2," Milad Riyad (no relation to the defendant) purchased the Harding Mall location with the considerable financial assistance of the 
defendant; the two had met while working in food services at the Opryland Hotel. The defendant sold his interest in the Harding 
Mall location to Milad Riyad within a year of the purchase. "
858,3," The plaintiff claims that, despite his testimony to the contrary, the defendant still maintains some interest in the Brentwood 
Kebab Gyros, as indicated by the fact that his cell phone number is listed on the Brentwood Kebab Gyros Facebook page as of 
September 27, 2010. (Docket No. 163 at 38.)"
858,4," In this round of briefing, the plaintiff has moved to strike these affidavits, arguing that the deposition testimony of Milad Riyad 
and Khalil demonstrates that they did not fully understand or review their affidavits before signing them. (Docket No. 164.) 
Consistent with the unpleasantly hostile tone of this litigation, plaintiff's counsel accuses defense counsel of ""bad faith"" and 
fraudulent misrepresentation in preparing and submitting the affidavits. (Id. at 4.) The court has reviewed the defendant's 
response to the motion to strike and defense counsel's affidavit, which describes the challenges of obtaining affidavits of affiants 
with limited English skills. (Docket Nos.  [*9] 165-166.) The court does not believe that there was any bad faith here, particularly 
in light of the fact that the affidavits and deposition testimony are, for the most part, consistent with each other. Moreover, in 
evaluating the evidence provided by Milad Riyad and Khalil, the court relied on the more recent and more in-depth deposition 
testimony as opposed to affidavits submitted in the earlier round of briefing. The plaintiff's motion will be denied. "
862,5," It does not appear that the parties have provided any briefing on the plaintiff's state law trademark dilution claim, and the 
plaintiff appears to have abandoned it. (Docket No 162 at 18.) To be clear, a fundamental element of this claim is that the mark 
at issue has become ""famous,"" and the defendant used the mark after that time. T.C.A. § 47-25-513. While the term ""famous"" 
does not appear to be defined in the Code, under a common sense definition of the term, there is no indication from the record 
that ""KEBAB GYROS"" is a ""famous"" mark in this state, and, therefore, the plaintiff's state law trademark dilution claim is not 
viable. "
866,6," It is, therefore, not necessary to address the defendant's argument that, even if infringement were sufficiently shown, the 
plaintiff would not be entitled to damages. (Docket No. 146 at 17.) In the final  [*38] section of his brief, the defendant requests 
attorney's fees, arguing that this case was litigated for ""an anti-competitive purpose,"" and he points to deposition testimony from 
Mr. Ghanem in which he suggested that he was upset because the defendant and other ""Egyptian"" restaurateurs had ""gang[ed] 
together"" to edge him out of the restaurant industry. (Docket No. 146 at 23.) Therefore, the defendant argues, the court should 
find this to be the ""exceptional [trademark] case"" where attorney's fees are recoverable by the prevailing party. (Id. at 22 citing 
15 U.S.C. § 1117(a)). Alternatively, the defendant seeks attorney's fees under the TCPA, arguing that the action was ""frivolous."" 
(Id. at 24 citing T.C.A. § 47-18-109(e)(2)). Not surprisingly, the plaintiff responds with a lengthy discussion of the bases for the 
lawsuit and a series of accusations of ""reprehensible"" misconduct by the defendant and defense counsel, which have allegedly 
increased costs and delayed the resolution of the litigation. (Docket No. 162 at 19-24.) Given that there is some similarity 
between the marks used by the defendant and those that the plaintiff had taken steps to protect, this action was not frivolous or 
 [*39] ""exceptional"" and, therefore, an award of fees is not appropriate. "
867,7," The closed Sam's Kabab Gyros locations in Gallatin and on Bell Road are still listed as defendants in this case on the docket. 
This case, through two rounds of summary judgment briefing has been a conflict between the plaintiff and Riyad. To the extent 
that the plaintiff maintains any claim against these shuttered restaurants, it is resolved in the defendants' favor by the court's 
analysis herein. "
870,1," The court notes that it may properly consider this inquiry. Whether a prior offense falls within the exclusion is ""a question of law 
for the court rather than one of fact for the jury."" Stanko, 491 F.3d at 412. "
884,1," After the Brady Plaintiffs filed this action, No. 11-CV–639, Carl Eller and other retired professional football players filed a similar 
action also seeking a preliminary injunction. That case was originally docketed as No. 11-CV-648. This Court consolidated the 
two actions. (Doc. No. 55.) As a result, all of the materials originally filed in No. 11-CV-648 are now part of the docket in this 
action (as Doc. Nos. 57-87) and will be cited by this Court accordingly. In addition, when citing the various Memoranda, which 
often include various tables of contents and other prefatory material subject to their own pagination, this Court will cite  [**3] both 
the page number of the document as referenced in CM/ECF, as well as the original page number of the memorandum."
884,2," Some restraints of trade, such as horizontal price-fixing, are so obviously impermissible, that they are deemed ""per se"" 
violations of the Sherman Act. Id. at 618. The rest are analyzed under the ""Rule of Reason,"" by which a court weighs a 
restraint's anti-competitive impact against whatever legitimate business purposes might otherwise justify it. Id. at 620. "
885,3," Judge Heaney dissented, contending, among other things, that although the majority purported to reject an indefinite exemption 
from the antitrust laws, the ""practical effect"" of its decision ""is just that–because the labor exemption will continue until the 
bargaining relationship is terminated either by a NLRB decertification proceeding or by abandonment of bargaining rights by the 
union."" Powell, 930 F.2d 1293, 1303, 1305 (8th Cir. 1993). As neither side would likely file a decertification proceeding, in Judge 
Heaney's view, ""[i]t follows that the end result of the majority opinion is that once a union agrees to a package of player 
restraints, it will be bound to that package forever unless the union forfeits its bargaining rights."" Id. at 1306."
885,4," Unlike the district court's earlier ruling that impasse triggered the application of the Sherman Act, which was reversed by the 
Eighth Circuit, this second ruling regarding the Norris-LaGuardia Act was not reviewed on appeal. "
886,5," The reported decision is captioned in terms of both Powell v. NFL and McNeil v. NFL, but the court denied the NFL's motion to 
consolidate the two cases because, among other reasons, the McNeil case was brought by individual players in 1990 in the 
wake of the Eighth Circuit's decision in Powell and after ""the players had voted to end their union  [**11] status and the NFLPA 
had renounced its collective bargaining rights,"" whereas the Powell case was a class action filed in 1987 that challenged issues 
""entirely absent from McNeil."" 764 F. Supp. at 1359. "
888,6," Finally, the history of litigation between the NFL and the Players concludes, as relevant here, with a case somewhat tangential 
to the present dispute between these parties. The Supreme Court recently ruled, for purposes of the prohibition under Section 1 
of the Sherman Act against combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, that the NFL, that is, the thirty-two individual 
teams, cannot evade Section 1 simply by forming a single corporate entity to develop, license and market their intellectual 
property (apparel with individual team logos, etc.). American Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l Football League,     U.S.    , 130 S. Ct. 2201, 
176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010)."
888,7," The NFL then amended an unfair labor charge that it had filed in February 2011 (alleging that the NFLPA was not bargaining in 
good faith) to add the charge that the NFLPA's disclaimer was invalid. "
890,8," The NLRA (also known as the Wagner Act), is codified as subchapter II of Chapter 7 of Title 29, that is, 29 U.S.C. §§ 151-69. 
(The rest of Chapter 7, exclusive of subchapter II, codifies the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.) The Norris-LaGuardia 
Act is codified as Chapter 6 of Title 29, that is, 29 U.S.C. §§ 101-13."
890,9," The Players contend that the NFL has waived its right to contest the Union's disclaimer. (Doc.  [**28] No. 41, at 13-14 (Mem. at 
8-9).) As noted above, this is not the first time that the Players' Union has disclaimed its status and role as their negotiating 
agent in collective bargaining. When the parties resolved their earlier dispute in 1993, the SSA (and the resulting CBA) into 
which they entered required the Players to reconstitute the NFLPA as a union, and stated that the NFL would not challenge any 
subsequent election to once again ""de-unionize."" The NFL now contests the waiver, arguing that it is inapplicable, but in any 
event, despite its earlier agreement, against public policy. This court need not reach the issue of waiver."
890,10," This Court does not understand the NFL to suggest that this Court should refer (or must defer) to the Board to decide the 
ultimate issue of whether the nonstatutory labor exemption continues to apply here, because the Supreme Court has ruled that "
891,," HN3[
] the issue of any implied antitrust exemption is generally one for the courts and that even in the exceptional case where 
referral to the relevant agency might be warranted, ""[t]he decision in the end . . . is for the courts."" Gordon v. New York Stock 
Exchange, 422 U.S. 659, 686, 95 S. Ct. 2598, 45 L. Ed. 2d 463 (1975)."
891,11," HN4[
] Application of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction usually requires that the court stay, rather than dismiss, the judicial 
proceedings pending an agency's resolution of an issue within its particular specialized expertise. Thus this issue, unlike that 
regarding the Norris-LaGuardia Act, is not truly ""jurisdictional,"" as it does not raise any true bar to a federal court's authority to 
hear a particular dispute as would a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, which of course would require  [**30] dismissal of the 
entire action. ""Despite the name, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction does not involve jurisdictional questions. It is a common law 
doctrine used to coordinate administrative and judicial decisionmaking."" Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians v. Barlow, 846 
F.2d 474, 476 (8th Cir. 1988). Because the doctrine generally requires abstention pending agency resolution of the issue 
entrusted to it, ""[c]ourt jurisdiction is not thereby ousted, but only postponed."" United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 
321, 353, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963)."
891,12," Agency jurisdiction may also be concurrent with that of the courts. 2 Pierce, supra, § 14.2, at 1190 (""Sometimes Congress 
confers concurrent jurisdiction on both an agency and the courts to resolve a class of disputes."")."
891,13," For example, in United States v. Western Pacific Railroad Co., the Supreme Court stated that the issues were ""within the 
exclusive primary jurisdiction"" of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 352 U.S. 59, 63 (1956) (emphasis added). And here, the 
NFL relies on the First Circuit's decision in Newspaper Guild of Salem, Local 105 v. Ottaway Newspapers, Inc., 79 F.3d 1273 
(1st Cir. 1996), to support its argument that a preliminary injunction should not issue where the agency has not yet articulated its 
view. (Doc. No. 34, at 26-27 (Mem. at 18-19).) In Newspaper Guild of Salem, the court, confusing statutory jurisdiction with 
primary jurisdiction, stated that ""[i]t is well settled that the NLRB enjoys primary jurisdiction over disputes involving unfair labor 
practices or representational issues."" 79 F.3d at 1283. Here, however, the NFL's unfair labor practice charge is properly pending 
 [**33] before the Board and the present judicial action involves no such charges or representational issues, which are questions 
within the NLRB's exclusive statutory jurisdiction. Similarly, in Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. Wichita Bd. of Trade, also 
relied upon by the NFL, the Supreme Court addressed two issues regarding judicial review of agency decisions. 412 U.S. 800, 
802, 93 S. Ct. 2367, 37 L. Ed. 2d 350 (1973). Regarding the second issue, ""what sort of error must"" the reviewing court ""find in 
the proceedings of the"" Interstate Commerce Commission ""in order to enjoin a proposed rate increase after a final order by"" that 
agency, the Court cautioned the reviewing court that because an injunction against agency action entails an assessment of the 
merits, the reviewing court should avoid indicating its view of ""national transportation policy, prior to an expression by the "
892,," Commission of its view."" Id. at 821. Here, of course, this Court is not reviewing any agency determination, much less enjoining 
that decision, and the NLRB already has clearly and consistently stated its standard for assessing union disclaimers."
892,14," Because the NFL requests a stay pending the outcome of the Board proceedings, this Court does not understand  [**34] the 
NFL to be contending that this entire action falls within the agency's ""exclusive statutory jurisdiction"" over certain issues and 
disputes, that is, that the Board could somehow consider and rule upon the antitrust and other underlying claims of the Plaintiffs. 
Rather, where primary jurisdiction is invoked, initial decision-making responsibility is allocated between agencies and courts 
where jurisdiction to resolve disputes and issues overlaps. 2 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 14.1, at 1161 
(5 th ed. 2010). And even where a case presents issues within the Board's statutory jurisdiction, ""federal courts on occasion 
have decided [NLRA] questions that emerged as collateral issues in suits brought under other federal statutes."" 2 John E. 
Higgins, Jr., The Developing Labor Law 2221 (5th ed. 2006). "
893,15," The NFL also claims that the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Pro Football, Inc. requires ""this Court to stay plaintiffs' suit 
pending the outcome of"" the Board proceedings the NFL initiated claiming an unfair labor practice by the Union. (Doc. No. 34, at 
25 (Mem. at 17).) But the decision in Brown does not concern primary jurisdiction. Rather, the Supreme Court addressed the 
process  [**39] of collective bargaining between the Union and the League and particularly what legal effect, if any, occurs upon 
an impasse during such negotiations. 518 U.S. 231, 235-50, 116 S. Ct. 2116, 135 L. Ed. 2d 521 (1996). Here, the collective 
bargaining process has ended, and the NFLPA disclaimed its role as the Players' negotiating agent in that process. See infra 
Section II.A.1(d)."
893,16," The NFL's reliance on other Eighth Circuit cases to support its request for a stay is similarly misplaced. In Construction, 
Building Material, Etc. Workers, Local 682 v. Bussen Quarries, Inc., the court faced the question of whether to dismiss an action 
presenting issues within the Board's exclusive statutory jurisdiction. 849 F.2d 1123, 1125 (8th Cir. 1988) (2-1) (affirming 
dismissal for ""lack of subject matter jurisdiction"" where plaintiff ""essentially asks this court to review a representational matter"" 
and Section 9 ""rests jurisdiction in the NLRB to determine questions of representation""). Likewise, in Morello v. Federal Barge 
Lines, Inc., the court held that the district court should have dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where the 
union sought an injunction ordering the employers to negotiate the issue of the status  [**40] of supervisory employees, because 
such an issue presents a question of representation, for which jurisdiction is vested solely with the NLRB under Section 9. 746 
F.2d 1347, 1349-51 (8 th Cir. 1984). Finally, the NFL's reliance on National Labor Relations Board v. Columbia Tribune 
Publishing Co., is unpersuasive as it was a judicial enforcement action–that is, an appeal directly from the NLRB's decision 
exercising its exclusive statutory jurisdiction over Section 8 disputes regarding unfair labor practices. 495 F.2d 1384, 1385 (8 th 
Cir. 1974). Where the NLRB decides what is in fact a genuine unfair labor dispute, an issue within its exclusive statutory 
jurisdiction, it may enforce its order in the appropriate court of appeal. 29 U.S.C. § 160(e). E.g. Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. 
v. NLRB, 535 U.S. 137, 122 S. Ct. 1275, 152 L. Ed. 2d 271 (2002). See generally 2 Higgins, supra, ch. 33. Columbia Tribune 
Publishing was not an action originally filed in district court in which a party claimed that a particular issue should be referred to 
the NLRB. There is no dispute here that the Board has such exclusive jurisdiction over Section 8 actions. This antitrust action, 
though, is not a Section 8 unfair labor practice case."
893,17," Section 9 provides the ""administrative machinery"" to resolve questions concerning representation  [**42] and authorizes the 
Board to certify employee units appropriate for collective bargaining. See generally 1 Higgins, supra, chs. 10 & 11. "
894,18," Although the Complaints also assert state-law claims for breach of contract (and related tort claims) (e.g. Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 137-
55), HN13[
] this Court has supplemental jurisdiction over such claims. 28 U.S.C. § 1367. And this Court does not understand the NFL's ""primary jurisdiction"" argument to contend that  [**44] these state-law claims are somehow preempted. "
895,19," Later, in responding to the Eller Plaintiffs' motion, the NFL appears to recognize that Garmon concerned the NLRB's exclusive 
statutory jurisdiction, not the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. (Doc. No. 75, at 14 (Mem. at 9) (citing Garmon for the proposition 
that the issue ""falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB"" (emphasis in original).) But even so, the NFL does so only to 
claim that the disclaimer presents an unfair labor practice governed by Section 8. (Id. (characterizing disclaimer as 
""gamesmanship"" that violates the Union's obligation to bargain in good faith).)"
895,20," The Supreme Court then explained that it was facing just such a case of the preliminary issue of the Board's jurisdiction. Id. at 
245 (""The case before  [**48] us is such a case.""). But the Supreme Court stated it was not for it ""to decide whether the [Board] 
would have, or should, have, decided these questions in the same manner."" Id. And even in the context of an agency's statutory 
jurisdiction, courts may sometimes decide the issue themselves. 2 Richard J. Pierce Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 14.2, at 
1189 (5th ed. 2010) (""Of course, it would not be appropriate for courts to refer every question concerning the scope of an 
agency's statutory jurisdiction to the agency for initial resolution. If the court concludes that the question can be resolved with 
confidence based solely on judicial analysis of the language and purpose of the statute, the court should resolve the question 
itself."")."
895,21," And even in Garmon itself, where the issue of federal preemption usually dictates greater deference to the federal agency's 
authority than that appropriate under ""primary jurisdiction,"" the Supreme Court ""indicated that if the state court can ascertain the 
actual legal significance of particular conduct under federal law by reference to 'compelling precedent applied to essentially 
undisputed facts,' the court may properly do so and proceed to adjudicate  [**49] the state cause of action."" Sears, Roebuck & 
Co., 436 U.S. at 188 n.13 (quoting Garmon, 359 U.S. at 246)). "
896,22," The Eighth Circuit has since stated that its ""review [of] the issue of primary jurisdiction"" is governed by the de novo standard. 
United States v. Rice, 605 F.3d 473, 475 (8 th Cir. 2010). In Rice, the court cited United States v. Henderson, which stated that 
the court ""appears"" to apply that standard. 416 F.3d 686, 691 (8 th Cir. 2005). Henderson, in turn, cites Access 
Telecommunications v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., which expressly stated that it was applying that standard only because ""both 
parties argue based on the assumption that we review de novo the issue of whether the doctrine of primary jurisdiction 
 [**52] was properly applied by the District Court."" 137 F.3d 605, 608 (8th Cir. 1998). In fact, the court noted that it was not 
""deciding the standard-of-review question, which is best left to be resolved in a case in which it is contested."" Id. Finally, the 
court noted that both parties had cited the same case from the Second Circuit, namely Nat'l Communications Ass'n v. AT&T, 46 
F.3d 220 (2d Cir. 1995). Id. at 608 n.2. Of the eight circuits that had addressed the question as of 2007, the Second Circuit ""is 
apparently the most committed to de novo review."" Aaron J. Lockwood, ""The Primary Jurisdiction Doctrine: Competing 
Standards of Appellate Review,"" 64 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 707, 722 (Spring 2007). Only three circuits seem to apply the de novo 
standard, and ""it appears that none has adequately justified its choice,"" although the Ninth as well as the Eighth Circuits have 
""specifically avoided addressing the standard of review issue."" Id. at 723. The First, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits ""are 
unclear as to the standard they apply."" Id. at 722. The Third, Fourth, Fifth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits review for an abuse of 
discretion."" Id. at 721-22. The author concludes that the issue ""should  [**53] be reviewed only for an abuse of discretion."" Id. at 
709, 749-50. "
897,23," The reason that the NLRB has issued decisions involving disclaimers is that the issue properly comes before the NLRB in 
various contexts within its statutory jurisdiction to resolve unfair labor disputes and to decide representation disputes. E.g., In re 
Pittsburgh Steelers, Case 6-CA-23143, 1991 NLRB GCM LEXIS 63, 1991 WL 144468 (June 26, 1991) (addressing disclaimer 
issue in context of a Section 8(a) unfair labor practice charge). Here, the issue does not arise as part of any action within the 
NLRB's exclusive statutory jurisdiction, but rather only as a defense in an antitrust and breach of contract action properly filed 
 [**57] in this Court. And, of course, Judge Doty of this district assessed and ruled upon an essentially identical disclaimer in a 
prior dispute between these parties. McNeil v. NFL, 764 F. Supp. 1351, 1356 (D. Minn. 1991). See supra Section I (addressing 
history of NFL-Player disputes in greater detail). "
898,24," The NFL also relies on several decisions that do not concern a union's disclaimer of its status as such, but rather address 
withdrawals from multi-employer bargaining. (Doc. No. 34, at 31 (Mem. at 23).) In Detroit Newspaper Publishers Association v. 
NLRB, 372 F.2d 569 (6th Cir. 1967), the sole issue was not a union's disclaimer of any further representation of its members, but 
rather whether ""two labor unions had the right to withdraw unilaterally from [a] multi-employer bargaining unit."" 372 F.2d at 570. 
In other words, the unions were not seeking to dissolve or de-unionize (so as to allow their employees to negotiate individually); 
rather, the unions wanted ""to bargain on a separate and individual basis with each publisher."" Id. Thus, the issue was one under 
Section 9(b) of the Board's authority and ""discretion to determine the appropriate bargaining unit."" Id. at 571. In Retail 
Associates, the  [**59] Board addressed a similar issue, that is, whether the union could withdraw from multi-employer 
bargaining. The union notified the employer association ""that it no longer wished to bargain with the Association as 
representative of the department stores in an association-wide unit, but at the same time indicated a willingness and desire to 
negotiate with the management of each of the stores on an individual basis."" 120 N.L.R.B. 388, 391 (1958). Similarly, Charles D. 
Bonanno Linen Service v. NLRB concerned whether an employer may withdraw from a multi-employer bargaining unit. 454 U.S. 
404, 405, 102 S. Ct. 720, 70 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1982)."
898,25," The General Counsel provided his opinion in response to the request for ""advice"" from the Regional Director of Region 6. The 
General Counsel issued an ""Advice Memorandum"" of the NLRB's General Counsel. The General Counsel responds to a request 
for advice from any of the Regional Directors by issuing his ""'final determination'"" via an Advice Memorandum. National Labor 
Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 142, 95 S. Ct. 1504, 44 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1975)."
898,26," There, as here, ""[t]he NFLPA  [**61] also amended its bylaws to eliminate all references to collective bargaining and has 
sought to restructure itself as a voluntary professional 'trade association.' Pursuant to this goal, the NFLPA filed a labor 
organization 'termination notice' with the Department of Labor, and has also filed forms with the Internal Revenue Service to be 
reclassified for tax purposes as a 'business league' rather than a labor organization. The NFLPA informed management that it 
would no longer represent players who had filed grievances under the expired contract."" 1991 NLRB GCM LEXIS 63, [WL] at *1. 
This is essentially identical to the Union's recent disclaimer here. (Doc. No. 1 (Complaint) ¶¶ 57-61; Doc. No. 91, Exs. B, C & E.) "
899,27," When providing an Advice memorandum to one of the NLRB Regional Directors, the General Counsel's legal position is 
derived from ""prior Board and court decisions and 'prior advice determinations in similar or related cases.'"" National Labor 
Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. at 141."
899,28," Here, the NFL claims the Union is still functioning as such despite ""rebrand[ing]"" itself as a ""trade association."" (Doc. No. 34, at 
30 & n.5 (Mem. at 22 & n.5) (noting Players' statements that, for example, ""we'll be back"").) But the offhand, anecdotal 
comments of individual players are inconclusive. Moreover, it seems beyond dispute that the defining attribute of a union is its 
function as the collective bargaining agent of its members. This Court is unaware of any such activity still occurring here. "
900,29," In  [**68] fact, in light of the Board's clear and consistent position on disclaimers, this court might be obligated to adhere to the 
General Counsel's prior decision regarding a disclaimer of the type at issue here. See Reiter v. Cooper, 507 U.S. 258, 269, 113 
S. Ct. 1213, 122 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1993) (explaining that where an agency has consistently adhered to a particular position that the 
court finds to be at least a reasonable one, the court is bound by that agency ruling under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural 
Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984))."
900,30," Here, the NFL states that it filed a charge on February 14, 2011, objecting to the Union's failure to bargain in good faith, and 
amended the charge after the Union's disclaimer. The NFL thus states that ""[p]roceedings  [**70] before the Board are ongoing."" 
(Doc. No. 34, at 17 (Mem. at 9).) It further contends that ""the Board is now considering [the] very question"" of the Union's 
disclaimer. (Id. at 35 (Mem. at 27).) The Players note, however, that the NLRB proceeding ""may never be initiated."" (Doc. No. 
41, at 19 (Mem. at 14).) Under NLRB procedure, a ULP case is initiated by a private party that files a ""charge,"" after which the 
regional office then investigates and, if in its discretion the charge merits proceeding, issues a ""complaint."" ""Only if a complaint is 
issued will the case be prosecuted and heard by the Board."" Douglas L. Leslie, Labor Law 10 (4th ed. 2000). There is no 
evidence in the record that any Complaint has yet issued. "
901,31," It is clear, however, that the Supreme Court was only deferring any decision on ""whether, or where, within [certain] extreme 
outer boundaries to draw that line."" Id. (emphasis added). The Court noted that others have suggested two such points 
delineating that outer boundary. In particular, it cited the D.C. Circuit's suggestion that the exemption lasts until collapse of the 
collective-bargaining relationship, as evidence by decertification of the union."" Id. (citing 50 F.3d at 1057). It also noted the 
NLRB's suggestion that an ""'extremely long' impasse, accompanied by 'instability' or 'defunctness' of multiemployer unit, might 
justify union withdrawal from group bargaining."" Id. (citing El Cerrito Mill & Lumber Co., 316 N.L.R.B. 1005, 1006-07 (1995)). 
 [**73] And with respect to the question of whether or where within the collective bargaining process it might be appropriate to lift 
the protection provided by the nonstatutory exemption, the Court recognized that the NLRB's views would likely be necessary. 
Id. (""Nor would it be appropriate for us to do so without the detailed views of the Board, to whose 'specialized judgment' 
Congress 'intended to leave' many of the 'inevitable question concerning multiemployer bargaining bound to arise in the 
future.'""). But again, the Court was addressing where, after impasse but within the still-existing collective bargaining framework, 
it might be appropriate to lift the protection of the nonstatutory exemption. Where the parties are still operating under the 
collective bargaining umbrella, the views of the NLRB are, of course, at least relevant, if not essential."
901,32," Although the parties often frame the present dispute in terms of whether the non-statutory labor exemption from the antitrust 
laws has expired, this Court need not, and does not, decide that issue. On these motions for a preliminary injunction, this Court 
does not of course decide the merits of the dispute. Rather, it must only assess whether the movants have shown a ""fair chance 
of success."" Resolution of the merits of Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claims, including the issue of whether the NFL remains exempt 
from such claims, must await later proceedings. "
902,33," This Court, as well as any federal court, often addresses issues of whether statements or actions are ""unequivocal"" (for 
example, when assessing a waiver of rights in a criminal action), whether actions are taken in ""good faith"" (e.g., White v. NFL, 
766 F. Supp. 2d 941, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20759, 2011 WL 706319, *7-*8 (D. Minn. 2011) (addressing contract law)), and 
whether statements are ""inconsistent"" with subsequent actions."
902,34," This Court notes that the legal consequences of many actions are as immediate as they are clear–marriage (""I now pronounce 
you husband and wife.""), divorce, executing a will, signing a contract, and entering a guilty plea all have such legal 
consequences."
902,35," For example, unionized employees have the right to strike as the counterpart to management's right to lockout its unionized 
employees. But once the Players have renounced their Union,  [**78] they could not engage in any meaningful ""strike."" The 
League could simply fire them all for failure to show up for work. Correspondingly, it is similarly difficult to understand how the 
League now purports to be locking out the individual Players. Such vocabulary and tools of labor negotiations do not translate 
well into the well-established body of employment law and antitrust law. But for the labor laws, a strike would be an illegal 
boycott under the antitrust laws and, similarly, a lockout would be an illegal boycott, as well, under the antitrust laws. "
903,36," HN28[
] The Norris-LaGuardia Act, while removing some jurisdiction from the federal courts, does not undermine a court's 
subject-matter jurisdiction entirely as it does not preclude a court from hearing the action, but only from issuing injunctive relief. 
29 §§ 101-104. Generally, under the Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule, subject-matter jurisdiction is determined from the face of the 
complaint, not from any defense. Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 393, 107 S. Ct. 2425, 96 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1987). Here, 
the Complaint plainly discloses federal questions, that is, several claims of antitrust violations under Section 1 of the Sherman 
Act (with pendent jurisdiction over state-law claims), and the union representation issue is raised only as a defense. Thus, the 
jurisdictional question here is only whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act removes the jurisdiction this Court otherwise possesses to 
issue injunctive relief. "
904,37," Moreover, as collecting damages from unions proved difficult, employers turned to the federal courts to obtain injunctions 
against various labor activities. Douglas L. Leslie, Labor Law 3 (4th ed. 2000)."
904,38," The lower courts too have understood Congress's intent and purpose. ""The anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia 
Act were intended to protect workers in the exercise of organized economic power."" In re Crowe & Assocs., Inc., 713 F.2d 211, 
216 (6th Cir. 1983). Those provisions are not designed ""to bolster management's strength against labor."" Int'l Paper Co. v. The 
Inhabitants of the Town of Jay, 672 F. Supp. 29, 33 (D. Maine 1987)  [**86] (finding Act inapplicable in action by paper mill that 
hired temporary replacement workers to enjoin enforcement of ordinances prohibiting hiring of strikebreakers). ""The court is 
unwilling to expand the scope of the Act when such an expansion would thwart Congress' clear intent to aid labor by proscribing "
905,," the use by management of certain bargaining tactics."" Id. (emphasis in original). ""[I]t is clear that the sole purpose of this Act is to 
prevent injunctive relief against labor unions or employees who are members of a labor union."" Keystone Freight Lines, Inc. v. 
Pratt Thomas Truck Line, Inc., 37 F. Supp. 635, 642 (W.D. Okla. 1941). In Local 205, United Electrical, Radio and Machine 
Workers of America v. General Electric Co., however, the court stated that ""[r]egardless of what may be said about the general 
purpose clause, § 102, even though the Norris-LaGuardia Act in fact proved to be and doubtless, was expected to be, of far 
greater use to unions than to employers, I do not believe it was intended to be a one-way street. On the contrary, in the report of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator Norris stated quite the opposite."" 129 F. Supp. 665, 667 (D. Mass. 1955). Although the 
 [**87] court of appeals vacated the district court's judgment, it too noted that ""although the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not a 'one-
way street' . . . it certainly was intended and has application mainly as a protection for union and employee activities. Where its 
terms can be read to include employer conduct, that conduct should also be protected."" 233 F.2 85, 93 (1st Cir. 1956). Note, 
however, that the quoted history on which the court relies states that ""'[i]t will be observed that this section (106), as do most all 
of the other prohibitive sections of the bill, applies both to organizations of labor and organizations of capital. The same rule 
throughout the bill, wherever it is applicable, applies both to employers and employees, and also to organizations of employers 
and employees.'"" 129 F. Supp. at 667 n.2 (quoting legislative history). Section 6, however, unlike Sections 4 and 7, does not 
address prohibitions against injunctions, but rather vicarious liability. 29 U.S.C. § 106 (providing that ""officer[s]"" and ""member[s]"" 
of ""any association or organization,"" and any ""association or organization"" shall not be liable for illegal acts of ""individual officers, 
members, or agents"" absent  [**88] proof of actual participation in, or authorization or ratification of, such illegal acts)."
905,39," The League asserts that ""'Section 4 is a flat prohibition of certain types of injunctive orders.'"" (Id. at 24 n.4 (Mem. at 16 n.4) 
(quoting Chicago Rock Island & Pac. R.R. v. Switchmen's Union of North America, 292 F.2d 61, 62 (2d Cir. 1961)).) The 
Players, however, contend that federal courts may issue injunctive relief ""'even in some of the circumstances covered by section 
4's outright ban.'"" (Doc. No. 41, at 17 n.3 (Mem. at 12 n.3) (quoting Camping Constr. Co. v. District Council of Iron Workers, 915 
F.2d 1333, 1343 (9 th Cir. 1990)).) But in Camping Construction Company, the court was addressing the limited exception 
recognized in Boys Markets, which permits injunctions requiring a party to abide by its agreement to arbitrate, and injunctions 
permissible under the Railway Labor Act. 915 F.2d at 1343-44. Neither exception appears implicated here. Nevertheless, this 
Court need not resolve this dispute."
905,40," Likewise, the other authorities cited by the NFL in support of its reading of the intent of the Norris-LaGuardia Act all concerned 
actions against unions. H.A. Artists & Assocs., Inc. v. Actors' Equity Ass'n, 451 U.S. 704, 710, 101 S. Ct. 2102, 68 L. Ed. 2d 558 
(1981); Marine Cooks & Stewards, AFL v. Panama Steamship Co., 362 U.S. 365, 365-72, 80 S. Ct. 779, 4 L. Ed. 2d 797 (1960) 
(reversing order for injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs against the union); Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River "
906,," and Indiana R.R., 353 U.S. 30, 32, 40, 77 S. Ct. 635, 1 L. Ed. 2d 622 (1957) (explaining that railroad sought  [**91] injunction 
against union's strike)."
906,41," The League also contends that, even if Section 4 does not flatly prohibit the injunction that the Players seek, the Players must 
still meet the requirements of Section 7, which governs the issuance of all remaining injunctions ""in any case involving or arising 
out of a labor dispute."" 29 U.S.C. § 107 (requiring a testimonial hearing and findings that essentially parallel those required to 
establish the basis for any injunction issued under Rule 65). But this issue is moot in light of this Court's conclusion that the Act 
in its entirety does  [**93] not apply here. And as will be discussed below, the Players have met the standards for the issuance of 
a preliminary injunction under Rule 65. See infra Section II.B."
906,42," The NLRA, enacted just three years later, defines ""labor dispute"" in almost identical terms. Id. § 152(9). "
907,43," The League contends that Section 4 applies ""regardless of whether or not plaintiffs are represented by a union."" (Doc. No. 34, 
at 20 (Mem. at 12).) The League cites Section 13(a) in support of its position that the ""Act applies to disputes between 
employers and 'employees or associations of employees.'"" (Id. (emphasis added by the League).) But Section 13(a) provides, in 
relevant part, that HN35[
] ""[a] case shall be held to involve  [**96] or to grow out of a labor dispute . . . whether such dispute is 
(1) between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employees or associations of employees; (2) 
between one or more employers or associations of employers and one or more employers or associations of employers; or (3) 
between one or more employees or associations of employees and one or more employees or associations of employees."" 29 
U.S.C. § 113(a). Section 13(a) thus casts a wide net, but not wide enough to support the League's position. The NFL seizes on 
the term ""employee"" in an attempt to expand the scope of the Act beyond ""labor disputes,"" that is, disputes involving unions. But 
HN36[
] the phrase ""employees or associations of employees"" does not mean ""individual non-union employees or unions."" It is 
better understood to mean that a ""labor dispute"" includes all disputes between an employer and either the union (an ""association 
of employees"") or an individual unionized employee or employees (or between two employers or between two such 
employee(s))."
907,44," The Brady Plaintiffs rely on Boise Cascade Int'l, Inc. v. Northern Minn. Pulpwood Producers Ass'n, 294 F. Supp. 1015 (D. 
Minn. 1968), for the proposition that the Act does not protect a group boycott. (Doc. No. 41, at 16 (Mem. at 11).) Granted, the 
court ruled that it was ""clear that the Norris-LaGuardia Act . . . does not apply to the facts of this case so as to prevent "
908,," preliminary injunctive relief. It would seem that this is not a 'labor dispute' in the traditional sense and thus that [A]ct has no 
application."" 294 F. Supp. at 1024. ""Rather  [**99] what is presented . . . is an apparent violation of the Sherman Act by virtue of 
what appears to be an illegal boycott by what the trier [of] fact ultimately may well find to be a legal organization."" Id. at 1024-25 
(granting injunction in action asserting claims based on Section 1 of the Sherman Act). And as the court explained, the 
defendants that the plaintiff sought to be enjoined were not a union, but only ""an 'ad hoc' unincorporated association and three 
individuals."" Id. at 1017. These ""operators"" (essentially individual loggers who ""enter individual contracts with [the] plaintiff,"" a 
paper mill and wallboard manufacturer) ""have never been organized on any sort of group basis before nor presented any 
concerted or uniform demands to plaintiff."" Id. at 1019. Moreover, even though the individual operators formed some sort of 
informal association, ""[t]he operators have been determined not to be a labor organization, at least within the meaning of the 
National Labor Relations Act."" Id. (emphasis added). But as the court also explained, these ""open market operators meet the 
classic definition of independent contractors,"" and were not employees as ""[t]hey receive no wages, but merely  [**100] a price 
for their product."" Id. at 1018. Thus, the court's conclusion that the Norris-LaGuardia Act did not apply because the case did not 
present a ""labor dispute"" was based on the fact that the dispute was not a controversy over the terms and conditions of 
employment, but a dispute over the sale of commodities, that is, the lumber that the defendant ""operators"" sold to the plaintiff 
paper mill. The court thus cited in support of its ruling Columbia River Packers Ass'n, Inc. v. Hinton, 315 U.S. 143, 62 S. Ct. 520, 
86 L. Ed. 750 (1942), and Los Angeles Meat and Provision Drivers Union, Local 626 v. United States, 371 U.S. 94, 83 S. Ct. 
162, 9 L. Ed. 2d 150 (1962). Each of the cases rejected application of the Norris-LaGuardia Act because the disputes did not 
concern labor, but the sale of goods. Hinton, 315 U.S. at 145 (""That a dispute among businessmen over the terms of a contract 
for the sale of fish is something different from a 'controversy concerning terms or conditions of employment, or concerning the 
association . . . of persons . . . seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment,' [29 U.S.C. § 113], calls for no extended 
discussion.""); see Los Angeles Meat and Provision Drivers Union, 371 U.S. at 102-03 (affirming injunction against 
 [**101] grease peddlers because, as in Hinton, they ""were sellers of commodities, who became 'members' of the union only for 
the purpose of bringing upon power to bear in the successful enforcement of the illegal combination in restraint of the traffic in 
yellow grease"")."
908,45," Conversely, the League contends that both sets of Plaintiffs ""fail to cite a  [**102] single case in which an injunction was 
issued against a lockout."" (Doc. No. 75, at 8 (Mem. at 3).) Putting aside whether this is true, it is difficult to conceive of how or 
why an employer would ""lockout"" its employees when they are not part of a union. If an employer is unwilling to accept the 
demands of non-unionized employees, it can simply terminate and replace them (subject, of course, to whatever contracts might 
apply and the limited prohibitions of employment law such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and Title VII). Moreover, 
the cases relied upon by the NFL do not support its position. The League's reliance on West Gulf Maritime Ass'n v. ILA Deep 
Sea Local 24 is misplaced because there the employer brought the action for injunctive relief seeking to enjoin the union's work 
stoppage (and to compel arbitration as allegedly required by the collective bargaining agreement). 751 F.2d 721, 724 (5 th Cir. 
1985). The Fifth Circuit's statement that the Norris-LaGuardia Act ""forbids courts to enjoin work stoppages 'in any case involving 
or growing out of any labor dispute'"" is accurate but provides no support for the League's effort to extend that prohibition beyond 
the context  [**103] of a labor dispute. Likewise, the case that West Gulf quotes for this proposition also concerned the 
conventional scenario of an injunction sought by an employer against a union and its president. Jacksonville Maritime Ass'n v. 
Int'l Longshoremen's Ass'n, 571 F.2d 319, 321 (5th Cir. 1978). (Finally, the decision in West Gulf ultimately turned on questions 
not at issue here: (1) the Boys Town exception to the Norris-LaGuardia Act, and (2) whether the action should be dismissed, 
transferred or stayed in light of a separate but similar action previously filed in another district.) "
909,46," Nor does the Ninth Circuit's decision in Burlington Northern Santa Fe R. Co. v. Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 174, 
which the League also cites in support of its interpretation of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. There the Ninth Circuit stated that 
""[o]wing to this broad definition, the Supreme Court has found the term 'labor dispute' to capture a wide range of controversies."" 
203 F.3d 703, 709 n.6. True enough, but all of the other cases the Ninth Circuit then cites, as that court's own assessment 
highlights, undermine the League's effort here to extend the Norris-LaGuardia Act's prohibition against injunctions to the 
employment context where the employees have renounced their union. ""Bhd. of Maintenance Way Employees, 481 U.S. at 441-
42 . . . (holding that Norris-LaGuardia prevents injunctions against union picketing of terminals through which employer's trains 
ran); Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, 457 U.S. at 712 . . . (holding that union's refusal to unload goods shipped from the Soviet 
Union in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan  [**105] was a 'labor dispute'); Marine Cooks & Stewards v. Panama 
Steamship Co., 362 U.S. 365, 370, 80 S. Ct. 779, 4 L. Ed. 2d 797 . . . (holding that union dispute with foreign ship over 
substandard wages and working conditions of employees of foreign employer is a Norris-LaGuardia labor dispute); Order of R. 
Telegraphers v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 362 U.S. 330, 335, 80 S. Ct. 761, 4 L. Ed. 2d 774 . . . (holding that a union's demand 
that no existing position be abolished except by agreement between employer and union is a 'labor dispute' under Norris-
LaGuardia); Hutcheson, 312 U.S. at 234-35 . . . (holding that jurisdictional dispute between two unions is a labor dispute); Milk 
Wagon Drivers' Union, 311 U.S. at 103 . . . (finding that a dispute between a union and an employer over the employer's use of 
independent vendors is a labor dispute)."" 203 F.3d at 709 n.6 (emphases added) (parallel citations omitted). And in Burlington 
Northern itself, the Ninth Circuit vacated a preliminary injunction because the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibited a railway from 
obtaining an injunction enjoining a union from picketing. Id. at 705-07."
909,47," The district court had issued a temporary restraining order enjoining defendants from refusing to sell dairy products to the 
plaintiffs. Id. The Seventh Circuit ruled that a federal district court ""is precluded by law from issuing 'any restraining order or 
temporary  [**107] or permanent injunction,' 29 U.S.C. § 101,"" because the court found that ""this is a case involving or growing 
out of a labor dispute within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act."" Id. The court, citing only the general prohibition of Section 
1, did not expressly address whether Section 4(a) of that Act encompassed employer lockouts as well as employee strikes within 
its prohibition of issuing injunctions against ""[c]easing or refusing to perform any work."" 29 U.S.C. § 104(a). But even if the 
Seventh Circuit had expressly considered and ruled that Section 4(a) extends beyond a strike by labor to also include employer 
lockouts, it is clear that in Midtown Milk a ""labor dispute"" plainly existed at the time the plaintiffs sought to enjoin the defendants. 
There the court merely gave the governing statutory language–""involving or growing out of a labor dispute""–the contextually 
broad scope it plainly possesses to include not only the striking union, but also those, such as the plaintiffs, who were ""at the 
least indirectly involved in the labor dispute currently existing between the union"" and Wanzer. 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 8256, 
1970 WL 2761, at *1. Here, however, the labor dispute has ended, the Players having dissolved  [**108] their union as their 
collective bargaining agent. "
910,48," In Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770, the Supreme Court recognized a limited exception to the prohibition 
against injunctive relief in labor disputes where parties to a collective bargaining agreement had agreed  [**109] to arbitrate their 
disputes. 398 U.S. 235, 253-54, 90 S. Ct. 1583, 26 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1970). The Court thus permitted injunctions to enforce that 
agreement by requiring the recalcitrant party to comply with their agreement, provided, of course, that ""issuance of an injunction 
would be warranted under ordinary principles of equity,"" including the requirement of irreparable harm. Id. at 254."
910,49," Recognizing that Section 7 largely reiterates the general standard for injunctive relief under Rule 65, the court found that the 
contract at issue ""does not provide for arbitration and that the principles of equity, namely occurring and continuing breaches, 
irreparable injury, and the balancing of hardships, do not warrant the issuance of an injunction."" 365 F. Supp. at 602."
910,50," The court's holding was confined to granting defendants' motions for summary judgment (or dismissal)  [**111] on the grounds 
that, independent of any labor law exemptions from antitrust law, Plaintiffs could not prove any violation of the antitrust laws. Id. 
at 1305, 1306-07."
910,51," After the parties reached an ""impasse"" in their negotiations, each side resorted to their permissible negotiating tools: the union 
struck all but one of the defendants, and that remaining employer, in conjunction with two others, ""locked out"" their employees. 
Id. at 1304-05. In short, insofar as the facts of Plumbers & Steamfitters are analogous to the relationship between the NFL and 
the Players, the analogy tracks the present dispute only until the factual situation addressed in Brown–that is, only up to the 
point of impasse that occurred within a collective bargaining context, but before the Players disclaimed the Union as their 
bargaining agent. There was no issue in Plumbers & Steamfitters of the union having disbanded in order to permit the individual 
employees the right to negotiate independently–and to do so free of the constraint of the non-statutory labor exemptions from 
the antitrust laws. Recognizing that ""[t]he lawfulness of conduct in the traditional economic struggle between labor and 
management is generally  [**112] measured under the standards of labor law,"" the court thus rejected the plaintiffs attempt ""to 
apply the Sherman Act to conduct that [the] Court determines is within the economic heart of labor-management relations."" Id. at 
1304 (emphasis added). "
911,52," For purposes of the present motion, the Brady Plaintiffs and the Eller Plaintiffs seek essentially the same relief here–a 
preliminary injunction prohibiting the League's ""lockout."" (Doc. Nos. 2, 58, & 60 (characterizing motion as ""consistent"" with that of 
Brady Plaintiffs.) The Eller Plaintiffs, however, are in a somewhat different factual position than the Brady Plaintiffs, who are 
either current or prospective Players. With the exception of Antawan Walker, who was added as a plaintiff in their First Amended 
Complaint, the Eller Plaintiffs are all retired Players. (Doc. No. 73, ¶¶ 13-17.) But as will be seen, this Court need not reach the 
Eller Plaintiffs' motion because  [**115] the Court grants the Brady Plaintiffs' motion, thereby mooting the Eller Plaintiffs' request 
for the same relief. "
912,53," The application of the four-factor analysis must be a ""flexible"" one. Rounds, 530 F.3d at 729 n.3. Thus any ""effort to apply the 
probability language with mathematical precision is misplaced."" Dataphase, 640 F.2d at 113. Thus, courts usually apply a 
""sliding-scale"" approach. See generally 11A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.3 (2d ed. 1995) 
(explaining flexible relationship between success on the merits and irreparable injury). The Supreme Court's recent decision in 
Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. does not undermine the application of this flexible analysis here. In Winter, 
the Court held that the requisite showing of irreparable harm may not be lessened to a mere ""'possibility' of irreparable harm"" 
based upon ""a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits."" 555 U.S. at 20-21, 129 S. Ct. at 375. In other words, while the 
overall analysis of the four relevant factors is generally a flexible one, a likelihood of actual irreparable harm remains essential 
and the movant's burden on that factor may not be diminished  [**118] based on a strong showing of the other three factors. Id. 
at 49-52, 129 S. Ct. at 391-92 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (explaining that because ""[f]lexibility is a hallmark of equity jurisdiction,"" 
the ""Court has never rejected [the sliding-scale] formulation, and I do not believe it does so today""). As was discussed above 
and now here, the Brady Plaintiffs have made a very strong showing of irreparable harm that is not only likely, but presently 
ongoing, and they have more than a negligible chance of prevailing on the merits. "
913,54," As relevant here, the record discloses no genuine issues of material fact in dispute. The irreparable injuries the Players are 
incurring are significant and, in effect, established by previous litigation. The NFL's arguments to the contrary are legally based, 
not factually based. "
914,55," While the term ""Franchise Player"" was a designation under the SSA, Plaintiffs allege that there is no agreement between 
Defendants and Players as to the enforcement of such a term after the expiration of the SSA and CBA. (Complaint ¶ 76.) "
918,56," As the Supreme Court later clarified, HN49[
] the non-statutory, or ""implicit,"" labor exemption is not strictly confined ""to labor-
management agreements."" Brown, 518 U.S. at 243 (emphasis in original) (citing the lower court's opinion). Rather, the 
exemption is based on the collective-bargaining ""process,"" ""not merely on the product of that process–the collective bargaining 
agreement."" Brown, 50 F.3d at 1050. "
919,57," As noted above, although the two motions for a preliminary injunction seek the same relief, the two groups of Plaintiffs are in 
different factual circumstances. Thus with respect to the Eller Plaintiffs, the NFL contends that their motion for a preliminary 
injunction ""suffers from all of the legal deficiencies that undermine the Brady plaintiffs' motion plus one more""–that is, ""the Eller 
plaintiffs do not–and cannot–allege antitrust injury"" and thus lack standing (Doc. No. 75, at 6-7 (Mem. at 1-2).) But in light of the 
fact that this Court grants the Brady Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, it need not reach, at this time, these additional 
issues because an order enjoining the NFL's purported ""lockout"" also inures to the Eller Plaintiffs' benefit and thus moots 
 [**145] their motion. "
931,1," Plaintiffs have asked this Court to certify the questions of state law at issue here to the New Mexico Supreme Court. See 
generally N.M. Stat. Ann. §§ 39-7-1 through 39-7-13 (providing for certification). We deny that motion, in part because Plaintiffs 
never requested certification in the district court until after that court dismissed with prejudice their claims against the Insurer 
Defendants. See Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. O'Hara Reg'l Ctr. for Rehab., 529 F.3d 916, 926 (10th Cir. 2008) (noting that HN1[
] 
""[t]his court generally will not certify questions to a state supreme court when the requesting party seeks certification only after 
having received an adverse decision from the district court""). "
932,2," The New Mexico legislature amended the Title Insurance Act in 2009, after Plaintiffs filed this action. The statutory provisions 
discussed above are those in effect when Plaintiffs filed this suit."
932,3," In 2009, the New Mexico legislature amended the Act to require such hearings only during odd-numbered years. See N.M. Stat 
Ann. § 59A-30-8(A) (2009)."
932,4," For these reasons, Plaintiffs' heavy reliance in their appellate briefs on these provisions in Article 17 of the New Mexico 
Insurance Code is frequently unavailing. So, too, is their reliance on cases decided under the Insurance Code, including Berry v. 
Federal Kemper Life Assurance Co., 2004 NMCA 116, 136 N.M. 454, 99 P.3d 1166 (N.M. Ct. App. 2004) (addressing 
certification of class action seeking damages for life insurers' failure to disclose additional cost for policyholders to pay their "
933,," premiums installments), and Azar v. Prudential Insurance Co., 2003 NMCA 62, 133 N.M. 669, 68 P.3d 909 (N.M. Ct. App. 2003) 
(addressing whether life insurers adequately disclosed to policyholders the additional cost of paying their premiums in 
installments)."
933,5," The Insurer Defendants include: First American Title Insurance Company, Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, Chicago 
Title Insurance Company, Commerce Title Insurance Company, Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company, Lawyers Title 
Insurance Corporation, Old Republic National Title Insurance Company, Stewart Title Guaranty Company, Ticor Title Insurance 
Company, Transnation Title Insurance Company, and United General Title Insurance Company."
933,6," Plaintiffs originally sued Eric Serna in his official capacity as the superintendent of insurance. When another superintendent 
was appointed, the district court granted the State Defendants' motion  [**8] to replace Serna in this case with the new 
superintendent; Plaintiffs do not challenge that substitution on appeal. In light of that order, we have substituted in the caption 
the current New Mexico superintendent of insurance, John Franchini. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d). "
934,7," Five days later, on June 30, 2008, the district court entered the identical judgment a second time. "
935,8," Plaintiffs challenge the superintendent's interpretation of the Title Insurance Act to require that he set one premium rate. We 
agree with the district court that the superintendent's interpretation was reasonable. "
936,9," Plaintiffs argue that Valdez is not relevant here because that case dealt with telephone rates set by the PRC, while this case 
instead deals with insurance rates that are set by the state superintendent of insurance and overseen by the PRC. Plaintiffs 
further argue In New Mexico, telephone companies are subject to a system of regulated monopolies, administered by the PRC, a special 
body created by the Constitution itself, see N.M. Const. art XI, § 2, to protect consumers against natural monopolies like 
electric utilities, gas utilities,  [**19] transportation companies, and telephone companies. By contrast, insurance companies 
are subject to a system of regulated competition, administered by the Insurance Division, which is a purely statutory body 
which has no constitutional authority. (Aplt. Br. at 44.) Although New Mexico courts do not appear to have yet applied the ""filed rate"" doctrine specifically to claims 
brought against insurers, courts in numerous other jurisdictions have applied the ""filed rate"" doctrine to the insurance industry 
generally. See Schermer v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 702 N.W.2d 898, 907 (Minn. Ct. App. 2005) (citing cases; rejecting 
argument that ""competitive and deregulated nature of the private insurance market and the absence of exclusive jurisdiction of 
the"" Minnesota Department of Commerce precluded application of ""filed rate"" doctrine to the insurance industry), aff'd, 721 
N.W.2d 307 (Minn. 2006); Richardson v. Standard Guar. Ins. Co., 371 N.J. Super. 449, 853 A.2d 955, 963-65 (N.J. Super. Ct. 
App. Div. 2004) (agreeing with ""considerable weight of authority from other jurisdictions that have applied the filed rate doctrine 
to ratemaking in the insurance industry,"" citing cases). In light of this authority, HN20[
] we predict  [**20] New Mexico courts 
would apply the ""filed rate"" doctrine to the pervasively regulated matter of title insurance. Plaintiffs have not shown any reason to 
reach a different conclusion. Plaintiffs' reliance on the Insurance Code, and specifically N.M. Stat. § 59A-17-3, to argue that 
""[t]he Insurance Code expressly preserves and promotes competition in insurance"" is misplaced. (Aplt. Br. at 45-47.) The 
Insurance Code specifically provides that HN21[
] ""[n]o provision of the Insurance Code shall apply to . . . title insurers and title insurance agents, as identified in Chapter 59A, Article 30 NMSA 1978, except as stated in that article."" N.M. Stat. Ann. § 59A-1-
15(H) (2004). And, HN22[
] while the Title Insurance Act does incorporate a number of provisions of the Insurance Code, it does not incorporate Article 17 generally nor § 59A-17-3 specifically. See id. § 59A-30-14. "

not address the application of the ""filed rate"" doctrine, as Valdez did. Further, in declining to dismiss the plaintiff's claim of unjust 
enrichment in that context, City of Las Cruces specifically held that the City's claim at issue in that case did not implicate the 
approved rate that the defendant electric company charged its customers, but instead sought to collect a franchise fee the 
electric company had been paying the City of Las Cruces for the right to use the City's streets, alleys, rights-of-way and other 
public grounds to provide electricity to its customers in the City. See 904 F. Supp. at 1244, 1246-47."

Valdez, 54 P.3d at 74-76 (addressing damages claims precluded by ""filed rate"" doctrine separately from claims asserted under 
the New Mexico Antitrust Act), the Antitrust Act also provides for injunctive relief, as well as costs and attorneys' fees. See N.M. 
Stat. § 57-1-3(A).  [**38] The ""filed rate"" doctrine would not necessarily preclude such relief. Therefore, we need to proceed with

942,16," New Mexico courts have indicated that the federal ""state action immunity,"" which ""implicate[s] the relationship between federal 
and state governments,"" is not applicable to cases brought under  [**41] New Mexico's Antitrust Act. City of Sunland Park v. 
Macias, 2003 NMCA 98, 134 N.M. 216, 75 P.3d 816, 823-24 (N.M. Ct. App. 2003). But the New Mexico Antitrust Act similarly 
exempts the State from its coverage. See N.M. Stat. § 57-1-1.2 (excepting the State from the Act's definition of ""person"")."
942,17," Plaintiffs claim that the New Mexico Supreme Court has already rejected the Noerr-Pennington doctrine in DeVaney v. 
Thriftway Marketing Corp., 1998 NMSC 1, 124 N.M. 512, 953 P.2d 277 (N.M. 1997), overruled on other grounds by Durham v. 
Guest, 2009 NMSC 7, 145 N.M. 694, 204 P.3d 19, 24-26 (N.M. 2009), and Fleetwood Retail Corp. of New Mexico v. LeDoux, 
2007 NMSC 47, 142 N.M. 150, 164 P.3d 31, 39-40 (N.M. 2007), and in Summit Properties, Inc. v. Public Service Co. of New 
Mexico, 118 P.3d at 727-28.  [**43] But those cases are inapposite. In Devaney, the New Mexico Supreme Court mentioned the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine, not in the antitrust context, but instead in considering a malicious abuse of process tort claim. See 
953 P.2d at 284 & n.1. In that context, the New Mexico Supreme Court generally noted, without ruling on the subject, that, 
because of the importance of the First Amendment right to petition courts for redress ""and the potential chilling effect of tort 
liability"" on the exercise of that right, some states apply the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to actions for malicious prosecution and 
abuse of process. Id. at 284 n.1. And in Summit Properties, the New Mexico Court of Appeals noted only that the defendant in 
that case had failed to raise adequately a defense under Noerr-Pennington. See 118 P.3d at 727-28. These decisions certainly 
do not suggest that the New Mexico Supreme Court would reject application of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine generally, let 
alone specifically in the antitrust context presented here, nor do they indicate how the New Mexico Supreme Court would apply 
Noerr-Pennington in other contexts. "

943,19," The second reason the Sherman Act does not proscribe private citizens' efforts to influence government action is because 
 [**50] doing so would implicate important First Amendment concerns. See Noerr, 365 U.S. at 137-38. "
945,20," There is a ""sham"" exception to Noerr-Pennington immunity, applicable in ""situations in which persons use the governmental 
process-as opposed to the outcome of that process-as an anticompetitive weapon."" City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 380. But 
Plaintiffs have never invoked that exception in this case. "
946,21," The parties do not rely on either the Tenth Circuit's post-City of Columbia decision in Tal, 453 F.3d 1244, or the pre-City of 
Columbia case of Oberndorf v. City and County of Denver, 900 F.2d 1434 (10th Cir. 1990), abrogated in part by City of 
Columbia, 499 U.S. 365, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1991). Although those cases include some language that might 
support Plaintiffs' contrary arguments here, see Tal, 453 F.3d at 1260; Oberndorf, 900 F.2d at 1440, that language is dicta and 
contrary to the clear ""holding"" in City of Columbia. "
947,22," In a different vein, Plaintiffs also argue, on appeal, that the Insurer Defendants ""acted as an insurance advisory organization or 
rating bureau without being licensed, in violation of the New Mexico Insurance Code."" (Aplt. Br. at 58 (citing several 
 [**63] provisions of Article 17 of the New Mexico Insurance Code).) However, because Plaintiffs did not include such allegations 
in their complaints, we do not address this theory here. "
953,1, The Plaintiffs are evidently parties that opted out of a class action settled in the Southern District of New York. 
954,2, The Court has stayed discovery pending resolution of this motion to dismiss. (Rec. Doc. 44). 
960,3," The Court is aware of the opinion in Home Builders Association of Northwest Louisiana v. Martin, in which the court accepted 
an argument that Cheramie undermines Turbos. No. 09-1679, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129851, 2010 WL 5109987, at *1 (W.D. 
La. Dec. 8, 2010). The Court disagrees with the weight that should be given to the Cheramie opinion. "
961,4," Plaintiffs have not alleged that the open account claim is premised on the purported pre-service verifications, rather than the 
assignment of the patients' rights under the plans. The Court does not address whether an open account claim based on that 
allegation would or would not be preempted. "
967,*," Retired judge of the Minnesota Court of Appeals, serving by appointment pursuant to Minn. Const. art. VI, § 10. "
968,1," North Valley's claims alleging (a) breach of fiduciary duty and (b) usurpation of corporate opportunity were only against Carron. 
The remaining claims of unfair competition and breach of contract were brought against both Carron and Valley Paving. "
973,1," Throughout this case, and without any objection by the defendants, the plaintiff has referred to Compak Corporation 
(""Compak"") — a company that Jimmie Johnson founded — as the ""Buyer"" under the July 1992 Bill of Sale. We conclude, then, 
that Compak and Compak International, Inc. are the same entity. "
975,2," Jimmy Johnson testified that he relied on Ron Bowen's representation that the final agreement contained substantially higher 
royalty percentages and a minimum royalty requirement. Even if we thought that Mr. Johnson's testimony was credible — and 
we do not — it is irrelevant. Before trial TCC expressly stated that it was not pursuing a claim against the defendants based on 
actual fraud, and reaffirmed its choice during its closing argument."
975,3," Whether the terms ""Holding Company"" and ""DuoTech"" refer to DuoTech Holdings — the company that licensed Compak's 
dual-lid patents — is unclear. Carlson testified  [*12] that these were different companies formed to utilize different intellectual 
property to make different products. We have our doubts about Carlson's credibility generally, but his testimony on these matters "
976,," is not implausible and there is no evidence in the record contradicting it. Carlson's correspondence discloses several witnesses 
who may have relevant information, but TCC only called Carlson to testify and did not depose anyone. "
981,4," Defendants devoted a substantial portion of their closing argument to attacking TCC's claim for tortious interference with 
contract. But it was apparent from TCC's closing argument that it was no longer pursing that claim."
981,5," Defendants dismissed this argument as ""new"" during their closing argument. It is true that TCC did not expressly articulate this 
theory in its complaint, which focused primarily on TCC's relationship with Olmarc. (Am. Compl. ¶ 71 (""DuoTech persuaded 
Olmarc to cease manufacturing Cups for TCC, and to instead manufacture Cups for DuoTech exclusively."").) But TCC's tortious 
interference claim, as pled in the complaint, is at least implicitly based on its inability to sell products to its customers. (Id. at ¶ 
103 (""As a direct and proximate result of these defendants' conduct, TCC was injured, suffering lost sales and profits and 
damage to its goodwill during its critical start-up phase."").) "
982,6," The Restatement itself expressly declines to decide who has the burden of proof. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 768 
cmt. a (1979) (""[T]his Section speaks of an interference that is improper or not, rather than of a specific privilege  [*34] because 
there is no consensus that engaging in competition is an affirmative defense to be raised and proved by the defendant or is 
instead simply not improper conduct inconsistent with the American system of free enterprise."")."
982,7, The portions of the district  [*36] court's order that our Court of Appeals reversed are not directly relevant to this case. 
983,8," We will assume for sake of this discussion that it is appropriate to judge Carlson's actions against the standard imposed by the 
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, even though it was far from clear in 2003 that TCC and DuoTech Holdings were parties 
to the same agreement."
983,9," TCC also named Ron Bowen as a defendant in Count IV. Bowen last appeared in this case in March 2006. At that time the 
bankruptcy court vacated the order of default that it had entered against him. When TCC filed its Amended Complaint four years 
later, it served Bowen's former attorney, who had withdrawn as his counsel in March 2004. We have serious doubts about 
whether this was valid service of process. Regardless, TCC  [*40] did not prove Bowen's liability or any damages caused by his 
conduct. TCC's suspicion that Bowen may have disclosed information about TCC's business to Carlson is insufficient. TCC's 
theory of its damages for tortious interference — claiming that it is entitled to an additional 4% royalty on reported sales because 
the defendants ""gave themselves"" an exclusive license — is dubious even as applied to the DuoTech defendants. It is 
nonsensical as applied to Bowen. "
985,10, Defendants have not objected to TCC's standing to pursue a claim that originally belonged to BMJ. 
986,11," During closing arguments neither side addressed the difference between the royalty rates for non-communion cup products, 
so we will not address it here."
986,12," This issue might be less problematic for TCC if there had been some evidence, independent of the July License Agreement, 
that the August License Agreement's royalty rate (3% of ""Gross Income"") was below the market rate for products of this kind. But 
there was none. "
987,13," TCC's argument that there are unpaid royalties associated with the ""open invoices"" that were part of the Communion Source 
sale stands on a different footing, inasmuch as it is not strictly based  [*57] on presumed sales by Communion, LLC. But TCC 
has not demonstrated that royalties were not paid in connection with those invoices. TCC's demonstrative exhibit is conclusory, 
and based in part on an exhibit that was not introduced into evidence. "
988,14," Both Drake and 3com recognize exceptions that would permit a plaintiff to pursue both breach of contract and an equitable 
accounting,  [*60] but those exceptions do not apply here. "
989,15," TCC cited a copyright case to support its argument, Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Fox Amusement Co., Inc., 551 F.Supp. 104 (N.D. 
Ill. 1982). We assume that TCC is relying the portion of the court's opinion addressing the personal liability of two officers for 
copyright infringement committed by the corporate defendant. Id. at 108. This is vicarious rather than contributory infringement, 
and Broadcast Music does not accurately reflect the standard for vicarious trademark infringement. See Hard Rock Cafe 
Licensing Corp. v. Concession Services, Inc., 955 F.2d 1143, 1150 (7th Cir. 1992).  [*65] Even under the standard articulated in 
Broadcast Music, there is not enough evidence concerning Carlson's role at Communion, LLC to hold him vicariously liable for 
its actions. "
994,1," Contemporaneously with its complaint, plaintiff filed motion for temporary restraining order and other equitable relief, seeking 
among other things order requiring defendant to remove from defendant's website certain statements regarding plaintiff. This 
court denied plaintiff's motion by order entered February 9, 2011, but allowed plaintiff's request to expedite discovery and case 
scheduling. "
995,2," Plaintiff cites the Declaratory  [**10] Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, and the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1631, as bases for 
this court's jurisdiction. It also cites the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, ""the implied non-statutory review procedure provided by 
28 U.S.C. § 1331,"" and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq. "
996,3," Even if some kind of interlocutory Leedom review were appropriate, it would have to be performed by the Fourth Circuit, not 
this court, in light of the exclusive jurisdiction given to the courts of appeal by § 45(c). Cf. Va. Dep't of Educ. v. Riley, 23 F.3d 80, 
83-84 (4th Cir. 1994) (""It is well-settled that HN8[
] in rare instances an appellate court may . . . grant[] interlocutory relief 
 [**13] to a party aggrieved by administrative actions when the court would have full appellate jurisdiction following a final agency 
decision.""). "

prohibiting ""all persons and entities from commencing or continuing . . . any judicial, administrative or other action or proceeding 
involving or against"" Japan Airlines. Because this case ""involv[es]"" Japan Airlines, Defendants moved to stay the proceedings in 
accordance with the injunction. See id. The Court did not stay the case, but continued the March 12, 2010 hearing that was then 
scheduled on the various motions to dismiss, and instructed the parties to advise the Court of the Bankruptcy Court's decision as 
to the scope of its injunction when that decision was issued. See dkt. 376. The parties subsequently informed the Court that the 
Bankruptcy Court's stay does not apply to the non-debtor Defendants. See dkt. 379, 381, 382. Japan Airlines has subsequently 
settled with Plaintiffs. See dkt. 436 at 4. Accordingly, there is no reason to stay the case, and, as indicated at the motion hearing, 
this Motion is denied."

Case No. 07-md-01819 CW, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141968, 2010 WL 5477313, at *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 31, 2010), finding that 
direct purchasers of a product subject to a global price-fixing conspiracy had successfully met the second prong of the domestic 
effects exception. The court there held without much discussion that ""as a result of the alleged conspiracy [p]laintiffs were 
overcharged for their purchases in the United States, and the overcharges give rise to their antitrust claims."" Id. The Court is not 
persuaded that this finding is correct."

1020,9," Defendants are free to raise this argument again at the summary judgment phase of the case, if appropriate. "
1021,10, Plaintiffs' allegations are accepted as true for the purposes of this Motion.
1021,11," Moreover, this is the same CAC the Court found plausibly stated a claim of conspiracy as to Continental Airlines in November 
2009. See dkt. 278."
1021,12," ""'A code sharing agreement is an agreement between two or more air carriers whereby the carrier operating a given flight 
allows one or more other carriers to market this flight and issue tickets for it as if they were operating the flight themselves. In 
practice, these other carriers add their own carrier designator code and  [*43] flight number onto that of the operating carrier. "
1022,," Code share partners also agree on how to compensate each other for the seats they sell on one another's flights.'"" CAC ¶ 55 
(quoting European Competition Authorities). Defendants implement these code sharing agreements through various alliance 
partnerships. Id. ¶¶ 57-60."
1022,13," For example, in a July 5, 2006 ""Order to Show Cause"" as to why IATA's antitrust immunity should not be revoked, the DOT 
stated, ""A participating airline will at times urge competing airlines to raise fares in their markets in order to avoid undercutting 
the fares charged in the airline's own principal markets"" and ""IATA members do not believe that their discussions are subject to 
the antitrust law prohibitions normally imposed on pricing discussions between competitors."" Id.  [*47] ¶ 89-91. See also id. ¶¶ 
98-99 (final order by DOT concluding that ""Pricing discussions among competitors of the kind that take place at the IATA tariff 
conferences are inherently anticompetitive.""). "
1023,14," For example, at the November 12, 2002 annual Association of Asia-Pacific Airlines meeting, the CEO of Philippine Airlines 
allegedly stated that ""in order to survive, competition must be replaced by cooperation."" See id. ¶ 74. "
1027,15," Even if the implied preclusion doctrine could be properly applied to actions of foreign states, the Court finds that Defendants 
have not satisfied Credit Suisse's four-part test, which requires (1) that the possible conflict affected practices squarely within an 
area of activity that the  [*62] laws seek to regulate; (2) regulatory authority to supervise the activities in question; (3) evidence 
that the responsible regulatory entities exercise that authority and (4) a resulting risk that the securities and antitrust laws would 
produce conflicting guidance. See Credit Suisse, 551 U.S. at 264. Among other things, Defendants have not demonstrated that 
there is a real risk of conflicting guidance between Japan's system and the U.S. antitrust laws, particularly as the March 14, 1998 
Memorandum of Understanding Between the United States and Japan provides that ""Nothing in this 1998 MOU shall be 
construed to limit the rights of either Party to enforce its domestic competition laws,"" see RFJN (dkt. 307) Ex. 5 at 26 ¶ X.C.2, 
and as foreign carriers may seek and receive antitrust exceptions from the U.S. Department of Transportation pursuant to 49 
U.S.C. § 41308. Mere incompatibility, as opposed to clear repugnancy, is insufficient to trigger implied preclusion. See Churchill 
Downs, Inc. v. Thoroughbred Horsemen's Group, 605 F. Supp. 2d 870, 886 (W.D. Ky. 2009)."
1027,16," But see Northrop Corp. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 705 F.2d 1030, 1048 n.25 (9th Cir. 1983) (""Although 'seemingly 
commercial activity' can trigger act of state concerns . . . purely commercial activity ordinarily does not require judicial 
forbearance under the Act of State doctrine""). However, Clayco Petroleum Corp. v. OPEC, 712 F.2d 404, 408 (9th Cir. 1983), "
1028,," [*66] which held that ""[t]he Ninth Circuit has not definitively ruled on the commercial exception,"" was decided on August 2, 1983, 
several months after Northrop, which was decided on February 28, 1983. Accordingly, it remains unclear whether the Ninth 
Circuit recognizes a commercial activity exception. It is also unclear whether the activity at issue here is ""purely commercial,"" per 
Northrop."
1028,17," Although the Opposition asserts that Thai Airways and VNA have not shown that they were sovereigns, Opp'n at 10, at the 
motion hearing counsel for Plaintiff conceded for the purposes of the motion that the two airlines are sovereigns. See dkt. 446 
(Tr.) at 42:14-17. Plaintiff also conceded that most of the actions complained of occurred in those sovereigns' own territories. Id. 
at 42:18-23."
1028,18," Defendants are free to raise this argument again at the summary judgment phase of the case, if appropriate."
1028,19, See 15 U.S.C. § 15b.
1028,20," Accordingly, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' argument that ""Even if [they] were to prevail on their motion, Plaintiffs' alternative 
grounds — equitable tolling — remain unchallenged and sufficient to toll any applicable statute of limitations. Opp'n (dkt. 334) at 
13 n.2. Despite the wording of the applicable heading (""Accrual of Claim, Equitable Tolling, Equitable Estoppel, and Fraudulent "
1029,," Concealment""), CAC ¶ 295, the Court reads the CAC as seeking equitable tolling only on the basis of fraudulent concealment. 
Fraudulent concealment is an equitable tolling doctrine. See Grimmett v. Brown, 75 F.3d 506, 514 (9th Cir. 1996)."
1029,21," This allegation does not incorporate by reference the CAC's earlier description of this email; fortunately, Defendants, in their 
Motion, identify it as CAC ¶ 233. Mot. at 5. That paragraph identifies a date (May 31, 2005), an author (Hirai Noboru of JAL) and, 
although it does not state who the recipients were, it references Northwest and Continental Airlines. CAC ¶ 233. These kinds of 
details are utterly lacking in the fraudulent concealment section. "
1030,22," See In re Scrap Metal Antitrust Litig., 527 F.3d 517, 537 (6th Cir. 2008) ([f]raudulent concealment . . . may be established 
through the acts of co-conspirators""); Beltz Travel Serv., Inc. v. Int'l Air Transport Ass'n, 620 F.2d 1360, 1367 (9th Cir. 1980) 
 [*76] (""[p]articipation by each conspirator in every detail of the conspiracy is unnecessary"")."
1030,23," Defendants rely on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c)(1)(C)(ii), which requires that when the original pleading was filed, the 
newly named defendant ""knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake 
concerning the proper party's identity."" See id. at 3. Plaintiff make no effort to explain why these Defendants were not named in 
the original pleading and certainly do not claim to have made a mistake about their identities. "
1031,24," The Court does not subscribe to these Defendants' additional argument that Plaintiffs failed to adequately allege due diligence. 
See Mot. at 10. ""The requirement of due diligence is only meaningful . . . when facts exist that would excite the inquiry of a 
reasonable person."" See Conmar, 858 F.2d at 504. Defendants argue that ""[m]uch of the evidence Plaintiffs cite for the alleged 
conspiracy was a matter of public record and easily discoverable."" Mot. at 10. But the evidence Defendants point to — their role 
in various organizations — is not ""much of the evidence"" Plaintiffs rely on in describing the conspiracy, or, standing on its own, 
very powerful evidence. The Court finds that the CAC adequately alleges due diligence. "
1032,25," VNA also argues that many of the CAC's allegations against it are time-barred. VNA asserts that the statute of limitations for 
Sherman Act claims is four years, that the CAC allegations do not relate back, and that therefore the ""claims based on conduct 
prior to August 6, 2005 must be dismissed."" Mot. at 3, n.1. As already discussed as to the joint motion by Philippine Airlines and 
VNA (dkt. 287), the Court agrees, although Plaintiffs will be permitted to amend their allegations of fraudulent concealment, 
which could lead to the tolling of the statute of limitations."
1032,26," This Court does not subscribe to VNA's puzzling theory  [*85] of ""unilateral adjudication"" or its implicit argument that a court 
hearing a dispute brought by private parties is the equivalent of a party to the ATA unilaterally challenging a price. "
1033,27," The cases cited by VNA in its Reply are similarly unpersuasive. Both Virgin Atl. Airways Ltd. v. British Airways PLC, 872 F. 
Supp. 52, 62 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) and Lemnitzer v. Philippine Airlines, 783 F. Supp. 1238, 1245 (N.D. Cal. 1991) involve airlines 
being challenged for taking actions (code-sharing and  [*87] preferring its own citizens) that were permitted under the ATAs. 
That is not the case here."
1033,28," The Court recognizes that this legislation pre-dates the 2003 ATA but notes that Vietnam does not assert that it was granted 
immunity under section 41308 of the statute, and, as Laker Airways held, ""[the ATAs] were all negotiated recently, at a time 
when the countries could be expected to have been familiar with the United States's position regarding enforcement of its 
antitrust laws over foreign corporations operating in the United States."" 731 F.2d at 932. "
1034,29," According to the CAC, Yobiyose Fares are discount fares for sale in the United States for roundtrip travel between the United 
States and Japan; they were designed to allow Japanese nationals living in the United States to bring family members in Japan 
to visit them. Id. ¶ 124. "
1040,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.
1040,1," We need not decide whether overcharge in seller fees is the appropriate measure of antitrust injury in the circumstances of this 
case, and make no comment on the question. "
1047,1," Minnesota Hockey, District 6, District 6 Director Brad Hewitt, and the local associations organized under District 6 are, 
collectively, ""defendants"" in this litigation. "
1049,2," Courts have interpreted the Minnesota antitrust statutes as analogous to federal claims. See, e.g., Howard v. Minn. 
Timberwolves Basketball Ltd. P'ship, 636 N.W.2d 551, 557 (Minn. Ct. App. 2001). As a result, the Court evaluates the motion 
under the federal statute and imputes the logic to the state claims. See Lamminen v. City of Cloquet, 987 F. Supp. 723, 734 (D. 
Minn. 1997) (""Minnesota antitrust law is interpreted consistent with the federal court's construction of the Sherman Act. 
 [**11] As discussed . . . above, there is no evidence which supports a reasonable inference of an unlawful conspiracy to restrain 
trade or to monopolize. Accordingly, Plaintiff's [state] law claim must fail as well."" (citations omitted)). "
1055,3," Since Prior Lake/Savage Hockey Association joined the other defendants  [**32] in the motion to dismiss (see Mem. in Supp. at 
1, Docket No. 43),, the dismissal of all claims against the local associations makes its separate motion for summary judgment 
moot. "
1058,1," The Complaint often fails to distinguish among Defendants as to alleged causes of action. To provide proper notice, any 
Amended Complaint should allege necessary facts against specific Defendants, i.e., it should tie each claim to a Defendant and 
explain how each Defendant is liable. "
1059,2," In the future, Plaintiff should consider amending the Complaint preemptively if it is ""terrible."" In this case, Radford has been 
sitting on his ""terrible"" Complaint for almost  [*6] six months. There is no need to wait for a court order dismissing a Complaint 
before filing an Amended Complaint."
1059,3," Radford simultaneously states that his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim is a ""fully cognizable claim"" and that it is 
""unlikely to prevail as written."" "
1060,4," To determine whether a plaintiff is the proper party to bring an antitrust claim and therefore has ""antitrust standing,"" the court 
must consider the following factors: (1) the nature of the plaintiff's alleged injury; that is, whether it was the type the antitrust laws were intended to forestall; (2) the directness of the injury; (3) the speculative measure of the harm; (4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and (5) the complexity in apportioning damages. See Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of Calif., 190 F.3d 1051, 1054 (9th Cir. 1999); see also Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft 
Foods, Inc., 232 F.3d 979, 987 (9th Cir. 2000). "
1066,5," In Skaggs, the court noted in dicta that ""at least one Hawaii court has addressed unconscionability when raised as a claim 
seeking rescission."" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135724, 2010 WL 5390127, at *3 n.2 (citing Thompson v. AIG Haw. Ins. Co., 111 
Haw. 413, 142 P.3d 277 (2006)). This was not an indication that one could raise an affirmative claim for ""unconscionability."" 
Indeed, in Thompson, the complaint did not assert a separate count for rescission or unconscionability. See Thompson, 111 
Haw. at 417, 142 P.3d at 281 (indicating that the specific counts were for negligence, fraud, breach of duty, and unfair and 
deceptive trade practices under Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-2). In Thompson, the remedy of rescission was  [*33] based on an 
independent claim. Similarly, a remedy for an unconscionable contract may be possible; a stand-alone claim asserting only 
""unconscionability,"" however, is improper. See, e.g., Gaitan, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97117, 2009 WL 3244729, at *13. "
1069,6," While some courts have recognized that a ""debt collector"" may encompass a party that seeks to enforce a security interest 
through foreclosure, see Wilson v. Draper & Goldberg, 443 F.3d 373, 376-77 (4th Cir. 2006); Selby v. Bank of Am., 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 139966, 2010 WL 4347629 (S.D. Cal. Oct. 27, 2010),  [*45] the Complaint alleges that Ocwen is a mortgage 
servicing company and MERS is an assignee of the debt. See Compl. ¶¶ 9, 11. "
1080,*," We further observe that even if section 104(a) of the Act were construed to permit an injunction against an employer lockout, 
there is a serious question whether the district court complied with the procedural requirements of the Act — including to hold a 
hearing in open court with opportunity for cross-examination — before issuing an injunction. See 29 U.S.C. § 107; cf. Mackey, 
543 F.2d at 623. "

1120,3," Section 4 of the Clayton Act provides treble damages to ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason 
of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 15. Section 16 of the Clayton Act provides that ""[a]ny person, firm, 
corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a 
violation of the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
1122,4," The Court notes specifically that the bald assertion that MERS ""did not have the authority to convey SNMC's interest as 
represented"" is woefully insufficient. To the extent that Plaintiffs rely on Paragraphs 77-82 to allege falsity, the Court is not 
persuaded as discussed infra. "
1123,5," In Opposition, Plaintiffs acknowledge this and rely on their allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation and slander of title. 
(Opp'n at 29.) As discussed, however, these claims fail."
1123,6," Although ""[a]ny person"" may bring an action for unfair methods of competition in violation of section 480-2, only consumers, the 
attorney general, or the director of the office of consumer protection may bring an action for unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
in violation of section 480-2. Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-2(d), (e); see also Davis v. Four Seasons Hotel, Ltd., 122 Haw. 423, 228 
P.3d 303, 307 (Haw. 2010). A ""consumer"" is a ""natural person who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, 
purchases, attempts to purchase, or is solicited to purchase goods or services or who commits money, property, or services in a 
personal investment."" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 480-1. "
1124,7," Indeed, it is unclear to this court what Plaintiffs mean by ""true costs and risks"" of the subject loan."
1124,8," Indeed, this seems a particularly preposterous assertion as Plaintiffs received a house in exchange for signing the Note and 
Mortgage."
1124,9," For the reasons discussed supra, the Court is not persuaded that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the falsity of the recording. "
1125,10," Indeed, in their entire Opposition, Plaintiffs make no argument with respect to this Count. "
1126,11, Plaintiffs proffer no argument in opposition with respect to this Count 
1127,12, The Court also notes that this is Plaintiffs second opportunity to amend their complaint. 
1135,1," Mercatus' amended complaint defines ""diagnostic imaging services"" as ""magnetic resonance imaging,  [**5] computerized 
tomography, nuclear medicine, radiography, and ultra-sonography, sold to patients"" and ""comprehensive physician services"" as 
""business services such as billing assistance, clinical services such as on-site diagnostic imaging services, and real estate 
services, such as leasing space to physicians."" We do not address in this appeal the viability of plaintiff's proposed product and 
geographic market definitions. "
1138,2," According to Mercatus, the falsity of the Hospital's claim that Mercatus posed a threat  [**13] to the Hospital can be shown ""by 
simply observing [the Hospital's] actual financial status""—the fact that the Hospital had ""substantial assets including cash, stock, 
land[,] and buildings"" as well as ""substantial extra capital capacity for expansion."" Mercatus also claims that the Hospital's 
internal notes reveal the falsity of the Hospital's claim that it provided $25 million in subsidy and charity to the community. 
Because, as we explain below, the alleged falsity of the Hospital's statements to the Village Board is of no legal significance in 
this case, we express no opinion on whether Mercatus mustered sufficient evidence to prove the falsity of the Hospital's 
predictive statements to the Village Board."
1138,3," The Ninth Circuit has said in dicta that the sham exception can also apply if a party brings a series of lawsuits without regard to 
their merits, even if a few have some merit as a matter of chance. See Kottle, 146 F.3d at 1060. We have not faced that issue. 
See Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 508 U.S. 49, 60 n.5, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 
611 (1993) (""A winning lawsuit is by definition a reasonable effort at petitioning for redress and therefore not a sham.""); 
California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 513, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972) (""One claim, "
1139,," which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may emerge which 
leads the factfinder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused."")."
1139,4," The Supreme Court has not yet explicitly spoken as to ""whether and, if so, to what extent Noerr permits the imposition of 
antitrust liability for a litigant's fraud or other misrepresentations."" Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 61 n.6. 
Nevertheless, both of the sources cited in that footnote—Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3) and Walker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mach. 
& Chem. Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965)—support this formulation of the fraud exception. See id. at 
177 (concluding that proof that a party ""obtained [a] patent by knowingly and willfully misrepresenting facts . . . would be 
sufficient to strip [that party of protection] from the antitrust laws""); id. at 179-80 (Harlan, J., concurring) (agreeing that antitrust 
liability may lie when a ""patent is shown to have been procured by knowing and willful fraud"" and when ""monopolization [is] 
knowingly practiced under the guise of a patent procured by deliberate fraud""); Walsh v. McCain Foods Ltd., 81 F.3d 722, 726 
(7th Cir. 1996)  [**21] (to obtain relief from a judgment under Rule 60(b)(3), moving party must show, among other elements, 
that because of fraud or misrepresentation ""it was prevented from fully and fairly presenting its case at trial""). "
1140,5," In accord with the bulk of the case law using this terminology, we refer to all decision-making driven wholly or primarily by 
policy and political considerations as ""legislative,"" fully cognizant of the fact that many such decisions are made by executive 
branches rather than legislatures. "
1141,6," We reject Mercatus' unsupported contention that a government proceeding is more likely to be adjudicative if a party is 
represented by legal counsel at that proceeding. After all, the presence or absence of counsel at a proceeding tells very little 
about the nature of the proceeding itself—a civil trial remains adjudicative regardless of whether a party appears pro se, and 
decision-making informed by lobbying is no less political merely because the lobby is represented by legal counsel."
1141,7," Mercatus argues that we should give significant weight to whether, in other contexts, the law treats the governmental activity at 
issue as legislative or adjudicative. We believe that such classifications, made for different purposes not connected to the First 
Amendment concerns underlying the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, are unlikely to be useful in applying that doctrine. Under Illinois 
law, for example, a hearing might be characterized as ""legislative"" for purposes of judicial review, see 65 ILCS 5/11-13-25 
(making any decision regarding an application for a special use ""subject to de novo judicial review as a legislative decision, 
regardless of whether the process in relation thereto is considered administrative for other purposes""), at the same time it is 
deemed ""adjudicative"" for the purpose of determining what process is due at that hearing, see People ex rel. Klaeren v. Village 
of Lisle, 202 Ill. 2d 164, 781 N.E.2d 223, 234, 269 Ill. Dec. 426 (Ill. 2002) (deeming hearings concerning special use applications 
""administrative  [**29] or quasi-judicial"" for purposes of determining whether petitioners received due process, not because of 
political considerations but because ""property rights are at stake""). See Our Savior Evangelical Lutheran Church v. Saville, 397 
Ill. App. 3d 1003, 922 N.E.2d 1143, 1162, 337 Ill. Dec. 566 (Ill. App. 2009) (interpreting 65 ILCS 5/11-13-25 to address only ""the "
1142,," mode of direct judicial review over the listed zoning decisions, not the application of due process to any of those . . . decisions"") 
(quotation omitted). "
1143,8," We decline Mercatus' invitation to determine for ourselves whether the village's special use ordinance actually granted the 
Board broad authority to deny development approval. Mercatus had the opportunity to present this argument to the Zoning 
Board of Appeals, 65 ILCS 5/11-13-3(f); 65 ILCS 5/11-13-12, and then to the state courts on administrative review, 65 ILCS 
5/11-13-13, but there is no indication in the record that Mercatus ever did so. Having eschewed that opportunity, Mercatus 
cannot now turn to the antitrust  [**36] laws to avoid the consequences of that decision. The antitrust laws are designed to 
protect competition. They are not a guarantee of good government. See City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc., 499 U.S. 
365, 378, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1991) (noting that the antitrust laws were not created to ""vindicate[ ] . . . principles 
of good government""); Noerr, 365 U.S. at 140 (""Insofar as [the Sherman Act] sets up a code of ethics at all, it is a code that 
condemns trade restraints, not political activity. . . .""). And they certainly are not a license for the federal courts to displace the 
State of Illinois to sit in review of what is entirely a matter of local law. Cf. City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 372 (""'We should not 
lightly assume that [the antitrust law] dictates transformation of state administrative review into a federal antitrust job.'""), quoting 
P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 212.3b, p. 145 (Supp. 1989). If Mercatus can invoke federal antitrust laws by 
claiming that the Village Board had no authority to reject Mercatus' site plan once the Architectural Board had approved it, and 
can thereby obtain a federal forum to review the merits of the Village Board's decision to reject the plan, ""we  [**37] cannot 
imagine what zoning dispute could not be shoehorned into federal court."" Coniston Corp. v. Village of Hoffman Estates, 844 F.2d 
461, 467 (7th Cir. 1988). "
1144,9," Our statement in Premier Electric that, ""if . . . injury occurs no matter how the government responds to the request for aid—then 
we have an antitrust case,"" 814 F.2d at 376, should not be construed to the contrary or as conflicting with Allied Tube or Noerr. 
 [**41] Our statement addressed only those circumstances in which a party imposes an unlawful restraint of trade, such as a 
boycott, as part of a larger attempt to petition the government. See id. (noting that the defendant's petitioning activity was ""an 
unvarnished effort to enforce a private price-fixing agreement""). "
1146,10," Mercatus claims that, ""in [its] substantially weakened state . . . [it] did not have the luxury of more speech,"" but we fail to see 
how it was rendered unable to speak. "
1147,11," Mercatus claims that the Hospital also promised the physician groups ""equity in [the Hospital's] real estate."" Nothing in the 
portions of the record relied on by Mercatus supports this contention. At most, the record indicates that the Hospital was 
considering whether to offer the physician groups such an equity option. "
1148,12," We agree with the Hospital that Mercatus' claim appears somewhat akin to a breed of antitrust violation recognized in the 
Ninth Circuit as ""predatory hiring."" ""Unlawful predatory hiring occurs when talent is acquired not for purposes of using that talent 
but for purposes of denying it to a competitor."" Universal Analytics, Inc. v. MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., 914 F.2d 1256, 1258 (9th 
Cir. 1990) (addressing ""the first reported case of a claimed violation of section 2 as a result of alleged employee raiding or 
predatory hiring""). We have never recognized predatory hiring as a valid theory of antitrust liability and need not do so at this 
time since Mercatus has said it does not assert a predatory hiring claim."
1148,13," In his deposition testimony, Mercatus' CEO implied that the Hospital threatened to make public one physician's ""personal 
conduct issue"" if  [**57] that physician continued to support Mercatus. If true, this would be troubling, but the physician denied 
that the Hospital ever made such a threat. No admissible evidence supports Mercatus' allegation. "
1149,14," It is questionable whether the Hospital even exerted such pressure. During his deposition, a physician with NSM made quite 
clear that he did not feel any pressure from the Hospital, which he said had ""offered another opportunity that I couldn't explore 
while I was under the no-shop"" agreement. "
1152,1," These facts are taken from the Plaintiff's Complaint. See Beck Deloitte & Touche, 144 F.3d 732, 735 (11th Cir. 1998) (""In 
evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint, a court must accept the well pleaded facts as true and resolve them in the light most 
favorable to the plaintiff."")."
1152,2," Milk contains nine essential nutrients and vitamins, including protein, vitamins A, D, and B12, calcium potassium, phosphorus, 
riboflavin, niacin, zinc, and magnesium. Milk is the only drink in the world that contains such a large range of naturally occurring 
nutrients."
1152,3, Milk was delivered in glass bottles until plastic containers were invented in 1964. 
1155,4, McArthur is not alleged to be a party to the exclusive supply agreements.
1155,5, Milk costs more than gasoline in many areas of the United States.
1155,6," The cases relied upon by Dean Foods, Transource Intern., Inc. v. Trinity Indus., Inc., 725 F.2d 274 (5th Cir. 1984) and 
Southern Concrete Co. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 535 F.2d 313 (5th Cir. 1976), are inapplicable to the standing analysis in this case. In 
both cases, the parties were vertical competitors and, as a result, the Fifth Circuit was obligated to employ a ""rule of reason"" 
standing analysis. Under such an analysis, ""standing is limited to purchasers, lessees and competitors of the supplier."" 
Transource Int'l, 725 F.2d at 284. "
1157,7," Dean Foods is not a named defendant in any of the common law counterclaims (Counts VI, VII and VIII). "
1173,1," Plaintiff alleges that all patents, except that for the ""Jersey General"" variety, were obtained by this sort of fraud. Id. at ¶ 27. "
1174,2," This quote is taken directly from Plaintiff's SAC. As noted infra, copies of the patents have been provided by Rutgers to the 
Court; however, no copy of these declarations was provided in connection with Rutgers' motion to dismiss. "
1175,3," In addition, Plaintiff alleges in the SAC that Rutgers made it a condition of the exclusive licenses issued in 2001 that JAFI 
""could not breed its own varieties of asparagus and that JAFI could not market or sell any varieties of asparagus (other than 
Rutgers's varieties) that competed with the Rutgers's varieties without giving Rutgers 9 months prior written notice of intent to do 
so."" Id. at ¶ 57. While the SAC includes these exclusive dealing allegations, at oral argument, Plaintiff clarified that  [**10] it is 
not bringing an exclusive dealing or restraint of trade claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act. It only brings a monopolization claim 
under § 2 of the Sherman Act. "
1176,4," Plaintiff obtained the tissue culture of the parent plants from Rutgers and contracted with a third party to grow the plants and 
cultivate the seeds. Id. at ¶¶ 88-90. JAFI's use of this third party has no relevance to its claims here, thus, additional allegations 
relating to this party are omitted from discussion."
1176,5," The Court may consider the sample license agreement in conjunction with the motion to dismiss because it is integral to 
Plaintiff's complaint. See Lum v. Bank of Am., 361 F.3d 217, 222 n. 3 (3d Cir. 2004); In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 
114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). Furthermore, the parties agreed at oral argument that this license is representative of the 
type of licenses entered into by the parties for other varieties although each license incorporates different dates of expiration and 
some licenses are for the parent plants while others are for the hybrid variety itself. "
1177,6," JAFI could not file the Second Amended Complaint as of right because JAFI did not file it within 21 days of Rutgers' motion to 
dismiss. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B).  [**19] In addition, following its motion to amend, Plaintiff then filed a motion for recusal, 
which the Court denied in a prior opinion. "
1179,7," In some cases, court have analyzed a claim by a licensee seeking to escape payment of future royalties, or disgorgement of 
previously-paid royalties, as a breach of contract claim premised on fraudulent procurement of a patent. See e.g., Transitron 
Electronic Corp. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 649 F.2d 871 (1st Cir. 1981) cited in Phillip E. Areeda, et al., FUNDAMENTALS OF 
ANTITRUST LAW § 701.a n.22. Here, Plaintiff's claim is more properly characterized as a Walker Process claim because it is 
brought under the rubric of antitrust law."
1179,8," ""The Patent Act bars issuance of a patent if the application is filed more than one year after (1) the product was sold or offered 
for sale and (2) the invention is ready for patenting. "" However, ""[a] sale for experimental use negates the on-sale bar."" In re 
Ceccarelli, 401 Fed.Appx. 553, 554 (Fed.Cir. 2010)  [**26] (internal citations omitted). "
1180,9," Some courts state the Walker Process elements as: (1) the patent at issue was procured by knowing or willful fraud on the USPTO; (2) the defendant was aware of the fraud 
when enforcing the patent; (3) there is independent evidence of a clear intent to deceive the examiner; (4) there is 
unambiguous evidence of reliance, i.e., that the patent would not have issued but for the misrepresentation or omission; 
and (5) the necessary additional elements of an underlying violation of the antitrust laws are present. Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innov., Inc., 141 F.3d 1059 (Fed.Cir. 1998); In re Netflix Antitrust Litig., 506 F.Supp.2d 308, 314 
(N.D.Cal. 2007)."
1180,10," One specific example alleged by Plaintiff is a 1995 newspaper article carrying the banner ""Ready to Plant in 1996,"" in which 
article Dr. Stephen Garrison of Rutgers  [**29] was photographed with Sam Walker, one of the owners of JAFI, and the manager 
of Michigan Asparagus Industry Research Farm. Id. at ¶ 38d. The article announced the potential release of a new variety 
whose female parent plant was NJ44P. Id. The patent application for NJ44P was not filed until ten years later, in 2006. Id. at ¶ 
38. "
1181,11," For example, the experimental use exception to the prior sale doctrine includes both legal and factual determinations. As 
explained by the Minton Court, An assessment of the validity of a patent claim in light of an alleged sale  [**33] involves, first, determining whether a sale is 
truly a ""sale"" within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), a question of law based on underlying facts . . . ""[A] patent is 
presumed to be valid, 35 U.S.C. § 282, and this presumption can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence of 
facts to the contrary,"" .... Id. at 1376 (internal citations omitted)."
1181,12," Defendant further argues that Plaintiff's failure to disclose theory is implausible and, accordingly, fails to satisfy Twombly's and 
Iqbal's requirement that a pleading be ""plausible on its face."" See Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). 
In Defendant's view, that the patents disclose the types of prior uses that JAFI contends were omitted, renders Plaintiff's 
allegations that Rutgers intended to deceive the PTO implausible. While the disclosed uses call into question some of plaintiff's 
allegations, other allegations of non-disclosure are not refuted by the patents. "
1182,13," Exergen is not a Walker Process case, but an inequitable conduct case. Id. at 1318. Inequitable conduct is an equitable 
defense to patent infringement that, if proved, bars enforcement of a patent. This judge-made doctrine evolved from a trio of 
Supreme Court cases that applied the doctrine of unclean hands to dismiss patent cases involving egregious misconduct."" 
Therasense v. Becton, Dickinson and Co., 649 F.3d 1276, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 10590, 2011 WL 2028255 at *4 (Fed.Cir., May 
25, 2011). Over time, the doctrine has been expanded to render a patent unenforceable. Id. Walker Process cases, which 
include antitrust elements as well, require ""higher threshold showings of both materiality and intent than are required to show 
inequitable conduct."" Dippin' Dots, 476 F.3d at 1346."
1182,14," Moreover, the Hyland Court emphasized that it did not have a copy of the patent application or the prosecution history before it 
such that it could ""tell whether it is contended that in obtaining the patent Grant . . . made affirmative misstatements to the Patent 
Office about the prior art."" Id. This qualification by the court further distinguishes Hyland from the case here where Defendant 
has provided copies of the patents for the Court to review, which patents make clear that some of the alleged prior uses were 
disclosed in the patent applications. "
1183,15," The court, however, dismissed the claim for failure to adequately allege materiality."
1183,16," While Eli Lilly is an inequitable conduct case, the Court nonetheless finds its analysis instructive here on the question of 
fraudulent intent. "
1184,17," See generally Therasense, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 10590, 2011 WL 2028255 at *11 (describing the materiality requirement of 
inequitable conduct cases as a ""but-for"" causation standard). Defense counsel made the Court aware of this recently-decided 
decision in a short supplemental letter memorandum filed May 26, 2011. However, the Court has not found it necessary to 
consider that supplemental memorandum or any further briefing on the issue and instead relies upon its own reading of the case 
 [**43] in this Opinion."
1184,18," My discussion of Therasense focuses on the majority decision to the exclusion of the partial concurrence and dissenting 
opinions. Eleven judges are represented in the decision, with six joining the majority opinion. "
1185,19," To the contrary, the court remanded the case to the district court to determine if the challenger could satisfy the clarified intent 
and materiality standard set forth in the court's decision. 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 10590, [WL] at *16. "
1186,20," Although some courts first consider antitrust standing before reaching the merits of an antitrust claim, the Supreme Court has 
made clear that the merits may be reached first. See Verizon Commc'ns Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, L.L.P., 540 U.S. 
398, 416 n. 5, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004). Moreover, the antitrust standing doctrine includes prudential elements 
and is, therefore, not coterminous with Article III standing, which standing must be first confirmed before a federal court can 
reach the merits of a dispute. See 2660 Woodley Road Joint Venture v. ITT Sheraton Corp., 369 F.3d 732, 741 n.10 (3d Cir. 
2004). "
1187,21," Although the SAC alleges that JAFI would be a competitor of Rutgers but for Rutgers patents, the court in McCullough 
rejected a similar characterization, noting that ""the balance of [plaintiff's] allegations established [it] only as [broker] who did 
business with competitors and consumers . . . not as competitors or consumers  [**54] themselves."" 382 Fed.Appx. at 229."
1187,22," Section (c) provides: It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise  [**57] engaged in, or the activities of 
which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such 
enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. "
1188,23," The Court is aware of the alternative use of mails allegations made in connection with the state RICO claim. See e.g., SAC, ¶ 
181 (stating that exclusive license agreements were ""negotiated and consummated in writings that were transmitted either by 
mail or electronically.""). However, as explained infra, the state RICO claim fails for lack of standing."
1188,24," Moreover, to the extent Plaintiff's injury allegations are interpreted to be consistent with those alleged in McCullough, 
discussed supra in connection with my antitrust standing analysis, that case confirms that dismissal of Plaintiff's RICO claim is 
appropriate. The court reasoned: The McCulloughs' lack of standing to bring an antitrust action likewise prevents them from pursuing their RICO claims. The 
Supreme Court has extended much of the Associated General analysis for antitrust standing to RICO cases. A plaintiff 
lacks standing to sue under RICO where, as here, he suffers injury that is only indirectly related to a defendant's alleged 
misconduct. Accordingly, even if the McCulloughs had properly alleged the essential elements of a RICO claim, they would 
lack standing  [**60] to sue under RICO for the same reasons they lack standing to sue under the [antitrust laws]."
1188,382, Fed.Appx. at 231 n.7 (internal citations omitted).
1188,25," Because New Jersey does not treat unreported decisions as precedential, any unreported state decision cited in this opinion is 
cited as persuasive authority. The Court, further, acknowledges that New Jersey has ""historically taken a much more liberal 
approach on the issue of standing than have the federal cases."" In re Six Month Extension of N.J.A.C. 5:91-1 et seq., 372 "
1189,," N.J.Super. 61, 86, 855 A.2d 582 (App. Div. 2004) (quoting Crescent Park Tenants Ass'n v. Realty Equities Corp. of N.Y., 58 N.J. 
98, 101, 275 A.2d 433)).  [**61] Nonetheless, HN28[
] New Jersey courts apply federal decisional law in interpreting the RICO 
standing requirement. Interchange State Bank v. Veglia, 286 N.J.Super. 164, 180, 668 A.2d 465 (App. Div. 1995) (discussing 
U.S. Supreme Court precedent)."
1189,26," It is clear that HN33[
] district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under any federal law relating to patents and plant variety protection. 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a). "
1190,27," A consignment exists where an consignor leaves his property with a consignee who is ""substantially engaged in selling the 
goods of others,"" and will work to sell the goods on behalf of the consignor. After selling the goods, the consignee must account 
to the consignor with the proceeds from the sale. See Nasco Equipment Co. v. Mason, 291 N.C. 145, 154, 229 S.E.2d 278, 285 
(1976). While the consignee may or may not receive the specific property of the consignment back, depending on if it is sold, this 
Court has recognized that a consignment creates a bailment between the parties. See Strang v. Hollowell, 97 N.C.App. 316, 387 
S.E.2d 664 (1990); see also, 642 8 C.J.S. Bailments § 11, at 384 (2005) (""The rule that where a person receiving property is not 
bound to return the identical thing received, but may account therefor in money or other property, or thing of value, the 
transaction is a sale, is not applicable to bailments or consignments for sale.... A consignment is a type of bailment where the 
goods are entrusted for sale....""); BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 152 (8th ed.2004) (definition of bailment for sale is ""[a]  [**67] bailment 
in which the bailee agrees to sell the goods on behalf of the bailor; a consignment.""). Thus, where a consignment relationship 
may have existed between plaintiff and defendant, the relationship was also that of a bailment. Moreover, New Jersey law also treats consignments as a type of bailment (bailment for sale). However, New Jersey law 
suggests that such agreements may fall within, and should be interpreted under, the UCC. See Charles Bloom & Co. v. Echo 
Jewelers, 279 N.J.Super. 372, 382, 652 A.2d 1238 (App. Div. 1995) (stating in case involving consignment of diamonds for sale

1190,29," The Court reiterates that any allegation that Rutgers attempted to enforce its patents must include specific facts to support that 
assertion, and not merely conclusory statements. For example, the SAC states in paragraph 196 that ""Rutgers continues to 
assert: (a) that JAFI must pay royalties if JAFI produces seed from plants . . .; (b) that JAFI cannot asexually reproduce such 
plants ...."" This sort of allegation does not contain sufficient factual matter under Twombly because it does not specify how or 
when Rutgers asserted patent-based rights against JAFI. "
1193,1," The record indicates the subject mortgage was recorded on August 11, 2004 and has an effective date of August 2, 2004. See

1196,," (""RICO"") claim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-64. Any attempted assertion of a civil RICO claim is a separate matter from the issues 
addressed in this Order. If Plaintiffs desire to assert a civil RICO theory, they must seek leave to file a further amended 
complaint by motion in compliance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 (along with a proposed further amended complaint). 
Such a motion for leave to file a further amended complaint, if any, should be filed separately from any amended complaint 
allowed in this Order. "
1197,4," By focusing on an illegal agreement, Plaintiffs appear to also be raising a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act, which they have 
not specifically pled. Even if a § 1 claim was pled, it would fail under the facts alleged. Section 1 provides: ""Every contract, 
combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with 
foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. A Sherman Act § 1 violation requires three elements: ""(1) an agreement, conspiracy, or combination among two or more persons 
or distinct business entities; (2) which is intended to harm or unreasonably restrain competition; and (3) which actually causes 
injury to competition,  [*19] beyond the impact on the claimant, within a field of commerce in which the claimant is engaged (i.e., 
'antitrust injury')."" McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., 845 F.2d 802, 811 (9th Cir. 1988) (citations omitted). The second element 
(restraint of trade) involves determining whether anticompetitive effects outweigh procompetitive benefits. See, e.g., California ex 
rel. Brown v. Safeway, Inc., 615 F.3d 1171, 1182-83 (9th Cir. 2010). As with a Sherman Act § 2 claim, Plaintiffs have failed to plead facts ""beyond a speculative level"" establishing an effect on 
competition (restraint of trade) or facts establishing an antitrust injury. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 557, 127 S. 
Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)."
1197,5," In Opposition, Plaintiffs assail the existence of MERS and the ""mortgage securitization industry"" in more detail. Pls.' Opp'n at 6-
8, 11-16. They attempt to add details in response to Moving  [*20] Defendants' attack on the Amended Complaint's allegations. 
They explain that MERS ""cannot be all things to all people in a mortgage transaction at one time, while being nothing at all at "

that ""MERS['] contention that it can maintain a dual personality is both logically and legally impossible."" Id. at 7. Although not clear, Plaintiffs' challenge to the ""dual role"" of MERS appears to be raising a ""split the note"" theory of wrongful 
foreclosure that has been rejected elsewhere. See, e.g., In re. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys. (MERS) Litig., 2011 U.S. Dist.

'497 application is the parent application of the patents at issue here. (Pl.'s Letter, May 23, 2011, ECF No. 92)."
1203,4, This application was a division of the '497 application.
1203,5," This application was a continuation of several patent applications, originating with the '497 application. "
1209,6," Notably, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has recognized that Twombly expressly rejected that a heightened pleading 
standard applies in antitrust cases. W. Penn Allegheny Health Sys., Inc. v. UPMC, 627 F.3d 85, 98 (3d Cir. 2010) (stating that 
""[w]e conclude that it is inappropriate to apply Twombly's plausibility standard with extra bite in antitrust and other complex 
cases""). "
1210,7," In the Third Circuit, analysis of anticompetitive conduct normally involves consideration of the conduct ""as a whole rather than 
considering each aspect in isolation."" LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 162 (3d Cir. 2003) (citing Cont'l Ore Co. v. Union 
Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962)). In a broad sense, anticompetitive conduct 
occurs when an entity ""attempts to exclude rivals on some basis other than efficiency or when it competes on some basis other 
than the merits."" W. Penn, 627 F.3d at 108 (internal citations and quotations marks omitted). The Sherman Act only inhibits 
anticompetitive conduct and not vigorous competition; the act ""directs  [*33] itself not against conduct which is competitive, even 
severely so, but against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself."" Spectrum, 506 U.S. at 458; see also W. 
Penn, 627 F.3d at 109 (listing varieties of anticompetitive conduct). "
1212,8," 3M contends that a letter dated April 28, 1999 demonstrates that a 1997 non-disclosure agreement applied to samples that 
TransWeb sent to Racal in 1996 and 1997. The Court considered these documents because they are attached to the Proposed 
Second Amended Complaint. See Pension Benefit, 998 F.2d at 1196. Despite a review of the documents and the parties' 
arguments, the import of the documents remains unclear and thus the Court must accept TransWeb's factual allegations that the 
1996 and 1997 were public disclosures and not subject to the terms of the subsequently entered 1997 non-disclosure 
agreement."
1212,9," TransWeb's allegations involve more than ""[a] mere failure to cite a reference to the PTO,"" Nobelpharma, 141 F.3d at 1071, but 
rather assert affirmative misrepresentations to the PTO. Affirmative misrepresentations further support  [*42] a finding that they 
are material. See Digital Control, Inc. v. Charles Mach. Works, 437 F.3d 1309, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (stating that ""affirmative 
misrepresentations . . . in contrast to misleading omissions, are more likely to be regarded as material"") (quoting Hoffmann-La 
Roche, Inc. v. Promega Corp., 323 F.3d 1354, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). "
1221,1," The Court also granted Defendants' request for judicial notice on Exhibit A and B, and denied Defendants' request for judicial 
notice on Exhibit C. [Doc. No. 57 at 4-5.] "
1224,2," As stated in Judge Anello's January 11, 2011 order, the Purchase and Sales agreement is not clear as to whether the contact 
created a property interest. Moreover, as the Court denied Defendant's request for judicial notice on Exhibit C, the ""Public 
Report"" issued by the Department of Real Estate regarding the Welk Resort Platinum Program, to resolve the instant property 
dispute at this stage would be improper. See Monaco v. Bear Stearns Residential Mortg. Corp., 554 F. Supp. 2d 1034, 1034 
(C.D. Cal. 2008) "
1225,3," Defendants contend that because ""Plaintiff's fraud and non-disclosure allegations form the sole basis for his claim that 
Defendants' alleged conduct was unlawful and unfair, they too must be dismissed for lacking specificity under Rule 9(b)."" [Doc. 
No. 61 at 9.] Thus, Defendants contend all Plaintiff's  [*19] claims under all three prong of the UCL should be dismissed for 
failure to plead with specificity under Rule 9(b)."
1225,4," Plaintiffs also assert that at this stage, it is ""Defendants that would know the names and particulars of the individuals that 
maintained, repaired and examined the units."" [Doc. No. 62 at 13: 7-8.] "
1226,5," Plaintiff contends that to state a cause of action under the fraudulent prong of the UCL, a Plaintiff need only show that 
""members of the public are likely to be deceived."" The Court disagrees, and finds that the Plaintiff must plead a claim for 
fraudulent behavior under the UCL with particularity as required by Rule 9(b). See Kearns v. Ford Motor Co., 567 F.3d 1120, 
1124-26 (9th Cir. 2009). However, the Plaintiff further contends that even if the UCL claims had to be plead with particularity they 
were pled with the required level of specificity under Rule 9(b). [Doc. No. 62 at 11.]"
1226,6," Rule 9(b) serves three purposes: (1) to provide defendants with adequate notice to allow them to defend the charge and deter 
plaintiffs from the filing of complaints ""as a pretext for the discovery of unknown wrongs""; (2) to protect those whose reputation 
would be harmed as a result of being subject to fraud charges; and (3) to ""prohibit [ ] plaintiff[s] from unilaterally imposing upon 
the court, the parties and society enormous social and economic costs absent some factual basis."" In re Stac Elecs. Sec. Litig., 
89 F.3d 1399, 1405 (9th Cir.1996) (quoting Semegen v. Weidner, 780 F.2d 727, 731 (9th Cir.1985)) (internal quotations omitted, 
brackets in original)."
1226,7," Although Defendants contend Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for fraud with particularity because Plaintiff has not identified 
which timeshare dwellings were affected,  [*26] and which if any Welk Defendants had knowledge of the alleged omissions, the 
Court is unpersuaded, and finds the facts pled by Plaintiff satisfy the purposes of Rule 9(b). [Doc. No. 66 at 6.] "
1227,8," Plaintiff further contends that the Court already evaluated Plaintiff's unlawful UCL claims in its previous order, and only 
dismissed as to the Toxic Mold Protection Act. [Doc. No. 62 at 8.] However, the Court finds this argument unpersuasive, 
because the Defendant only moved to strike reference to the Toxic Mold Act and Judge Anello's order specifically stated that 
""Plaintiff's allegation are sufficient without reference to the Toxic Mold Protection Act because any  [*27] finding of unfairness 
could be tethered to the alleged statutory violations . . . and the California Civil Code sections Defendants did not move to 
strike."" [Doc. No. 57 at 18.]"
1227,9," Plaintiff's claim that Defendants' acts were unlawful under the UCL, as they violated  [*29] Section 1929 of the California Civil 
Code, are moot, as Plaintiff did not move to contest Defendants' motion to strike any reference to Section 1929. "
1228,10," Defendants rest their argument on a sentence in the Judge Anello's pervious order, in which the Court stated that ""at this 
stage whether the interest sold by Defendants was a real property interest in the nature of a lease or a personal property interest 
consisting only of points."" [Doc. No. 57 at 12.] However, as this Court will clarify, Defendants have misconstrued  [*32] the Judge 
Anello's prior order, as Plaintiff is claiming an interest that falls into both categories. "
1233,1," Programmer Defendants include NBC Universal, Inc., Viacom, Inc., The Walt Disney Company, Fox Entertainment Group, Inc., 
and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc."
1233,2," Distributor Defendants include Time Warner Cable Inc., Comcast Corporation, Comcast Cable Communications, LLC, 
CoxCom, Inc., The DIRECTV Group, Inc., EchoStar Satellite L.L.C., and Cablevision Systems Corporation. "
1234,3," Plaintiffs acknowledge three categories  [**3] of distributors, namely, cable providers, satellite providers, and telephone 
companies. Plaintiffs have filed suit only against the cable and satellite providers."
1234,4," Section 15 states in pertinent part: HN1[
] Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person who shall be injured in his business or property by 
reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in 
which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover 
threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The court may award 
under this section, pursuant to a motion by such person  [**5] promptly made, simple interest on actual damages for the 
period beginning on the date of service of such person's pleading setting forth a claim under the antitrust laws and ending 
on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period therein, if the court finds that the award of such interest for such period is 
just in the circumstances."

1234,5," Programmers and Distributors claim that plaintiffs decided to discontinue discovery after preliminary review showed there was 
no evidence to support their claim that the bundling practices foreclosed competitors from the  [**7] upstream market. "
1235,6," The Supreme Court has identified a small number of  [**8] restraints of trade ""that would always or almost always tend to 
restrict competition and decrease output,"" see Bus. Elec. Corp v. Sharp Elec. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 723, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. 
Ed. 2d 808 (1988) (internal quotation omitted), such as horizontal agreements among competitors to fix prices, see Texaco, 547 
U.S. at 5, or to divide markets, see Palmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc., 498 U.S. 46, 49-50, 111 S. Ct. 401, 112 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1990) 
(per curiam). The Court deems these restraints to be per se unlawful. See Bus. Elec., 485 U.S. at 723. These practices are not 
at issue here. "
1236,7," HN6[
] A tying arrangement may constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act if the plaintiff proves ""(1) that the defendant 
tied together the sale of two distinct products or services; (2) that the defendant possesses enough economic power in the tying 
product market to coerce its customers into purchasing the tied product; and (3) that the tying arrangement affects a not 
insubstantial volume of commerce in the tied product market."" Cascade Health Solutions, 515 F.3d at 913 (internal quotation 
omitted). The parties do not allege that the tying practice in this case is a per se antitrust violation. "
1237,8," Thus, there is effectively ""zero foreclosure"" of competitors. Blough v. Holland Realty, Inc., 574 F.3d 1084, 1090-91 (9th Cir. 
2009)."
1237,9," Plaintiffs claim that Theme Promotions, Inc. v. News America Marketing FSI, 546 F.3d 991, 1004 (9th Cir. 2008), supports their 
argument  [**17] that reduced consumer choice and increased prices is sufficient to establish an injury to competition. Plaintiffs 
are mistaken: Theme Promotions held only that such injuries established an antitrust violation, not that they constituted an injury 
to competition. Rather, the defendants' right of first refusal agreements, which had ""foreclosed competition in a substantial share 
of the market,"" caused the injury to competition in that case. Id. at 1001-03. Theme Promotions is therefore inapposite. "
1238,10," Plaintiffs also cite Ross v. Bank of America, N.A. (USA), 524 F.3d 217 (2d Cir. 2008), for the proposition that reduced choice 
and increased prices are adequate to state a Section 1 claim, but that case is inapposite because it involved allegations of 
horizontal collusion, a fact not alleged by the Plaintiffs in this case, and pertained to standing. See id. at 223, 225. "
1244,1," Following the removal of this case, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (""JPML"") entered an order conditionally 
transferring this action to the Northern District of California for inclusion in In re: TFT-LCD (Flat Panel Antitrust Litig., MDL No. 
1827. Plaintiff moved to vacate the conditional transfer order. On February 3, 2011, the JPML entered an order [MDL docket 
entry 165] postponing its decision on Plaintiff's motion  [**4] to vacate until this Court issues its ruling on Plaintiff's motion to 
remand [28]. "
1246,2," In Hood v. F. Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd., the District Court of the District of Columbia noted that it found Allstate to be 
""instructive,"" but ultimately did not decide the same issue, as it deemed the State to be a real party in interest with respect to 
some of the claims asserted and held that the State's presence in the lawsuit defeated diversity. 639 F. Supp. 2d 25, 29-32 
(D.D.C. 2009). "
1247,3," Defendants attempt to distinguish SDS West Corp. on the ground that, unlike here, the defendant in  [**16] that case sought 
removal on traditional diversity rather than CAFA grounds. SDS West Corp., 640 F. Supp. 2d at 1049. In other words, SDS West 
Corp. hinged on the complete diversity requirement, rather than CAFA's minimal diversity requirement. Similarly, Defendants 
seek to distinguish Hunt Int'l on the ground that the court in that case held that there was no traditional diversity when the 
Attorney General was present in the case. Hunt Int'l, 481 F. Supp. at 74. Finally, Defendants state that Lann is inapposite 
because it involved not removal, but a rejection by the court of the defendants' effort to impose discovery obligations on the 
individuals for whom the state sought restitution through the action. Lann, 587 N.E.2d at 523. The Court acknowledges that 
factual peculiarities of all three cases set them apart from the case at bar, but nonetheless finds their enunciation and application 
of the general rules regarding real-party-in-interest questions to be instructive. "
1249,4," Defendants cite State of Calif. v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 474 F.2d 774 (9th Cir. 1973), for the proposition that monetary recovery for a 
subset of residents precludes sovereign interest in the case.  [**24] In Frito-Lay, the court ruled that the State attorney general 
did not have a quasi-sovereign interest in enforcing a federal antitrust law, as the law pertained to a different sovereign. The 
case is thus distinguishable from the one at bar, in which the State seeks to enforce a state statute. Attorneys general have a 
sovereign interest in enforcing their own state laws. Pennsylvania v. Mid-Atlantic Toyota Distribs., Inc., 704 F.2d 125, 131 (4th 
Cir. 1983). Thus, Frito Lay is not persuasive authority on the facts presented here. "
1250,5," Defendants argue that a finding of lack of jurisdiction would contravene Congress's intent in creating CAFA — namely, to 
prevent plaintiffs from ""artificially structuring their suits to avoid federal jurisdiction."" Freeman v. Blue Ridge Paper Prods., Inc., 
551 F.3d 405, 407 (6th Cir. 2008). Yet, Defendants do not contend that Plaintiff fraudulently pleaded claims to avoid federal 
jurisdiction or colluded with private individuals for that purpose. (Indeed, it appears that Plaintiff has in good faith sued in its 
name alone.) Moreover, Defendants do not appear to dispute that the State has a quasi-sovereign interest in the claims for 
injunctive relief and civil penalties under the IAA."
1250,6," Both parties devote a significant number of pages to arguing that CAFA's legislative history supports their respective positions. 
For example, Defendants submit that CAFA's legislative history indicates that the statute was not designed to prevent removal of 
suits brought by states' attorneys general, as Congress rejected an amendment that would explicitly have prevented such 
removal. However, as the Northern District of California recently found in its order remanding Washington and California State 
cases against AU Optronics to state courts, ""the legislative history of CAFA * * * does not clearly demonstrate a congressional 
intent that CAFA should apply to parens patriae actions. See also Harvey v. Blockbuster, Inc., 384 F. Supp. 2d 749, 752-54 
(D.N.J. 2005)  [**29] (surveying CAFA's legislative history and concluding that it was not Congress'[s] intent to encroach upon 
States' authority to bring parens patriae actions)."" In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel Antitrust Litig.), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17793, 2011 
WL 560593, at *3. This Court need not delve into the legislative history to resolve the remand motion. However, the Court notes 
that, in view of the long history of parens patriae actions and the traditional approach to determining the real party in interest in a 
lawsuit, the absence of any express provision in CAFA authorizing removal of parens patriae suits more strongly suggests that 
Congress did not intend CAFA to apply to actions in which the State (through its Attorney General) asserts sovereign or quasi-
sovereign interests in litigation. "
1252,7," HN16[
] CAFA's mass action ""carve-out"" provision states that ""the term 'mass action' shall not include any civil action in which 
(III) all of the claims in the action are asserted on behalf of the general public (and not on behalf of individual claimants or 
members of a purported class) pursuant to a State statute specifically authorizing such action * * *."" 28 U.S.C. § 
1332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III). "

1258,3," In addition to the factual allegations linking this case to this district, the DOJ also notes that this district, as the location of DOJ's 
headquarters, is DOJ's home district. See Pl.'s Mem. at 9. In United States v. Microsemi, a case relied upon by the defendants, 
a district court in the Eastern District of Virginia granted a motion to transfer venue in an antitrust case in part because DOJ had 
failed to file in its home district. See Microsemi, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18700, 2009 WL 577491, at *7 (""DOJ is not located in

1295,6," The district court noted that  [**41] the plaintiffs' complaint alleged that the defendants ""embarked upon a nationwide 
combination and conspiracy, the purpose of which was fix, raise, and maintain and stabilize the price of corrugated sheets in the 
United States,"" that they ""agreed among themselves to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the prices of corrugated sheets in the

Corporation has filed its own Motion to Dismiss, seeking dismissal from this action, which shall be addressed in a separate

1302,9," The Court notes that DP Plaintiffs made a blanket request in the closing paragraph of their Response Brief, asking the Court to 
allow them to file an amended MAC ""[s]hould the Court be inclined to grant any part of Defendants' motion."" They did not, 
however, file a motion to amend or submit a proposed amended complaint — even after Defendants filed their Reply Brief noting 
their failure to do so. Moreover, DP Plaintiffs have not adequately explained, in either their Response Brief or at the May 26, 
2011 hearing, how they could file an amended MAC that would plead fraudulent concealment with the requisite particularity. The 
Court therefore denies DP Plaintiffs' request. "

1309,1," The District Court also granted Amgen's motion to dismiss on the alternative grounds that the Complaint failed to allege a per

1311,3," Another WBCGF drug, Leukine, is sold by Berlex Laboratories. (Compl. ¶ 24). Leukine holds only a ""very small"" share of the

more costly process.""  [**7] (Compl. ¶ 24). In comparison, Amgen's WBCGF drugs are administered by subcutaneous injection.

1313,7," The District Court described Amgen's motion to dismiss as a motion for failure to state a claim and ultimately dismissed the

custody of them, but it does bill the [customer] for the teeth, collect payments from the [customer], and pay Dentsply."" Howard 
Hess, 424 F.3d at 367. "
1318,11," This evidence consists of: (1) a sample 2004 ""Physician Clinic Agreement,"" referring to the ""purchase"" of the drugs by 
""Physician Practice[s];"" (2) a 2008 ""Physician Clinic Agreement"" stating that any conflict between the clinics relating to ""any 
purchaser order or invoice"" was controlled by the clinic's  [**34] Agreement with Amgen; (3) a 2007 letter from Amgen to the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services discussing a proposed rule that included an attachment where Amgen referred to 
patients as ""customers""; (4) a 2007 letter sent by Amgen to class members that address doctors, clinics, and hospitals as 
""valued customer[s],"" and (5) a template contract between Amgen and a sample clinic that refers to ""purchasing opportunities"" 
for eligible members and ""purchases"" by physicians. (Appellant Br. 31-33) (emphases omitted) (internal quotation marks 
omitted). Warren General also draws our attention to statements Amgen made in Ortho Biotech Products, LP., v. Amgen Inc., 
Case No. 05-cv-4850, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85331 (D.N.J.), an antitrust suit Aranesp manufacturer Ortho brought against 
Amgen. These various documents do not give rise to direct purchaser standing. First, there is no allegation that Warren General was a 
party to these agreements or contracts. Moreover, although the contracts show that Amgen permitted physician clinics to 
purchase products either directly from Amgen or from ""Authorized Wholesalers,"" Warren General concedes that all of its 
purchases were through a wholesaler. Therefore, even if we considered  [**35] those agreements, they would not support the 
hospital's position. Second, we question the relevance of Amgen's characterization of its relationship with class members in 
promotional materials or correspondence to an agency in a different context. Even if Amgen considered hospitals and clinics to 
be ""customers,"" that would not negate the fact that Amgen sold its products to hospitals and clinics through an intervening 
customer—the middleman agency. We find for the same reason that Amgen's use of the word ""customer"" or ""purchaser"" in 
describing hospitals and clinics, or its failure to mention AmerisourceBergen in responding to Ortho's complaint in a separate 
lawsuit, does not contradict our conclusion that Warren General is an indirect purchaser. "
1321,12," Warren General has attempted to distinguish cases arising from price-fixing antitrust claims from tying claims, on the ground 
that the direct purchaser rule has less traction in the latter. HN23[
] The direct purchaser rule has its origins in statutory 
construction of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 736-37. Therefore, as the hospital conceded at oral 
argument, it applies here. See also Merican, 713 F.2d at 967 (refusing to limit Illinois Brick to cases of  [**48] horizontal price-
fixing). To the extent that Warren General argues that the harm caused by an illegal tying claim is distinct from the harm caused 
by a price-fixing conspiracy, we find that argument unpersuasive, given the possible injuries in this case. "
1322,13," We take note of Warren General's argument that AmerisourceBergen would not have standing to bring an antitrust 
 [**51] action under Section 4, because it was not injured by Amgen's actions. However, that issue is not before us and the 
existence or non-existence of AmerisourceBergen's injuries was not considered by the District Court, thus there is no record for 
us to review. Therefore, we do not find that only a suit brought by Warren General would enforce the antitrust laws. "

1393,," hospital services. (Doc. 2 ¶¶ 22-23). According to the Complaint, Phoebe North, Inc., is the entity created by PPHS in connection 
with the subject transaction to manage and operate Palmyra under the control of PPHS. (Doc. 2 ¶ 21)."
1393,4," Except where otherwise indicated, for concision and because Defendants make identical arguments in their supporting briefs, 
the instant Order often only cites to one of Defendants' supporting briefs instead of the briefs of all three Defendants. Similarly, 
this Order often only cites to one of Plaintiffs' briefs instead of both."
1393,5," HN1[
] Section 13(b) of the FTCA reads, in pertinent part: Whenever the Commission has reason to believe— (1) that any person, partnership, or corporation is violating, or is about to violate, any provision of law enforced by the 
Federal Trade Commission, and (2) that the enjoining thereof pending the issuance of a complaint by the Commission and until such complaint is dismissed 
by the Commission or set aside by the court on review, or until the order of the Commission made thereon has become 
final, would be in the interest of the public— the Commission . . . may bring suit in a district court of the United States to enjoin any such act or practice. Upon a proper 
showing that, weighing the equities and considering the Commission's likelihood of ultimate success, such action would be 
in the public interest, and after notice to  [**6] the defendant, a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction may 
be granted without bond . . . ."" FTCA § 13(b), 15 U.S.C. § 53(b)."
1393,6," HN2[
] Section 16 of the Clayton Act permits [a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association . . . to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the United States 
having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . . , when and 
under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is 
granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, and upon . . . a showing that the danger of 
irreparable loss or damage is immediate, . . . . Clayton Act § 16, 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
1394,7," The Court's grant of temporary injunctive relief has been extended, pursuant to Defendants' consent, until the Court's issuance 
of a decision on the pending PI Motion."
1394,8," Defendants HCA, Palmyra, and the Authority alternatively move for summary judgment in their Motions to Dismiss. (The 
Phoebe Defendants only move to dismiss and vacate the TRO.) However, the Court construes Defendants HCA's, Palmyra's, 
and the Authority's Motions as motions to dismiss instead of ones for summary judgment because the Court's findings and 
conclusions herein with respect to the state action immunity issue are made without reference to matters outside of the 
pleadings. Harper v. Lawrence County, Ala., 592 F.3d 1227, 1232 (11th Cir. 2010) ( ""A judge need not convert a motion to 
dismiss into a motion for summary judgment as long as he or she does not consider matters outside the pleadings.""). And to the "
1395,," degree the Court has referred to matters beyond the pleadings that are attached to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss-for example, 
the Asset Purchase Agreement, Management Agreement, and documents concerning  [**12] the negotiations for the 
transaction-the Court is permitted to do so because these matters are (1) central to the complaint and (2) undisputed. See Horne 
v. Potter, 392 F. App'x 800, 802 (11th Cir. 2010) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 201)). For this reason, Defendants' Motion to Strike (Doc. 
73) Plaintiff FTC's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Doc. 64) is DENIED, for the decision herein does not reference or 
rely on the FTC's or Defendants' Rule 56 Statements. For this reason, the Court also OVERRULES the Authority's objection to the exhibits that Plaintiffs moved to admit into evidence 
at the close of the June 13, 2011 hearing on Defendants' Motions to Dismiss and Plaintiffs' PI Motion. The Authority contends 
that these exhibits are irrelevant to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss because they do not deal with the state action defense; 
rather, the Authority assets, they deal with Plaintiffs' application for a preliminary injunction. The Court finds, however, that these 
documents are relevant to the state action defense in that they provide context for the Court's assessment of the transaction, 
specifically whether Defendants' actions qualify for state action. Furthermore, all of the documents  [**13] on Plaintiffs' Exhibit 
List on which the Court's analysis relies are referenced in the Complaint, which is the only focus of a Court's ruling on a motion 
to dismiss. Finally, many of the most relevant documents to which the Authority objects—and all of the documents relied on by 
the Court—were previously filed by Plaintiffs as well as Defendants—for example, the 1990 Lease—or were provided to 
Defendants."
1395,9," Defendants also move to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, seemingly asserting 
that because the state action doctrine immunizes Defendants from antitrust laws, the Court lacks federal subject matter 
jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs' Complaint. Defendants' Motions to Dismiss, however, are more appropriately grounded in 12(b)(6), 
instead of in Rule 12(b)(1), as they require the Court to review the sufficiency of the pleadings. As such, the Court's review of 
Plaintiffs' Complaint is governed by Rule 12(b)(6) standards "
1396,10," Section 7 also applies to stock or share capital acquisitions. See 15 U.S.C. § 18. Many nonprofit entities like Phoebe Putney 
and Palmyra, however, have no stock or share capital to acquire. This part of section 7 is therefore inapplicable to many 
acquisitions of nonprofit enterprises such as the one at issue here. FTC v. Univ. Health, Inc., 938 F.2d 1206, 1214 n.14 (11th 
Cir. 1991) (finding inapplicable stock-acquisition clause of section 7 to acquisition of nonprofit hospital). "
1398,11," On November 10, 2010, Baudino, acting as special counsel to PPHS, also detailed this proposition in a six-page letter to HCA, 
which explained that the Authority would ""lease Palmyra to a non-profit entity controlled by PPHS . . . [on] substantially the same 
terms as the Authority's existing lease of [PPMH]."" Ex. PX207-02. "
1399,12," Phoebe Putney as well as the Authority and HCA/Palmyra, who join Phoebe Putney in this argument, assert a number of other 
grounds for this proposition, including the Court's lack of jurisdiction over non-profit entities. (See Docs. 45, 46). However, the 
Court does not address those arguments given its discussion of the application of the relevant state action tests to each 
Defendant. See infra Part I.c.ii. The Court also must note that non-profit entities are subject to section 7 and thus, FTC 
jurisdiction. See Univ. Health, Inc., 938 F.2d at 1215, 1216 (explaining congressional intent for FTC's expansive and vigorous 
enforcement of section 7 of Clayton Act, regardless of distinction between  [**31] type of corporation); see also supra note 10. "
1400,13," Plaintiffs also state that Defendants do not apply the correct standard of review for summary judgment because Plaintiffs fail to 
raise undisputed material facts. However, as previously noted, the Court does not resolve Defendants' Motions to Dismiss as 
ones for summary judgment but as ones to dismiss. See supra note 8. Thus, the Court does not need to apply the standards 
applicable at the summary judgment stage and thus, declines to consider Plaintiffs' allegations and Defendants' arguments 
within the context of summary judgment."
1400,14," For purposes of deciding the application of state action immunity to Defendants, the Court combines its assessment of the 
immunity of Phoebe Putney with that of HCA/Palmyra for reasons explained below. See infra note 21 and accompanying text. "
1401,15," Cine 42nd Street explained the conflict between these principles and a competitive free market that are raised by a state's 
attempt to anticompetitively regulate its own domestic economy under the shield of state action immunity. Principles of 
federalism and state sovereignty, embedded in the United States' federalist system, hold that states are sovereign powers and 
are entitled to act independently, even where such leads to anticompetitive economic activity. The tenet surrounding the free 
market, however, is that the U.S. economy is grounded on the free enterprise system and that anticompetitive economic activity 
is prohibited by antitrust law. Cine 42nd Street 790 F.2d 1032, 1035 (2d Cir. 1986). "
1402,16," HN11[
] O.C.G.A. § 31-7-75(4) and (6), respectively, authorize a hospital authority to acquire by lease, purchase, or otherwise, and to sell to others or lease to others for any number of years not to exceed forty, any land, buildings, structures, or 
facilities constituting any part of an existing or future project, O.C.G.A. § 31-7-75(4), (6), (7), which includes ""the acquisition, 
construction, and equipping of hospitals, health care facilities, . . . and other public health facilities . . . under the supervision and 
control of any hospital authority or leased by the hospital authority for operation by others to promote the public health needs of 
the community . . . ,"" O.C.G.A. § 31-7-71(4) (emphases added). Section 31-7-75(7) also authorizes a hospital authority to lease 
for any number of years not to exceed forty for the operation of any project by another, provided that authority determines that 
lease will promote public  [**42] health needs of community by making additional facilities available or reducing healthcare costs, 
and that authority retains sufficient control over any project so leased so as to ensure that lessee will not in any event receive 
more than reasonable rate of return on its investment in the project. Id. § 31-7-75(7). "
1404,17," Noerr-Pennington has recognized a ""sham"" exception to this rule: where a private party's petitioning of a governmental entity 
is not a genuine attempt to procure favorable government action but is instead an attempt to directly interfere with the business 
relationships of a competitor through improper means, for example, of delay and expense, federal antitrust  [**49] laws apply. 
See City of Columbia, 499 U.S. at 380, 381 (explaining as example where delay is sought to be achieved by lobbying process 
itself and not by governmental action that lobbying seeks). Here, however, Plaintiffs have not alleged that this exception applies, 
and for reasons explained in Part I.c.ii, see supra pp. 31-39, the Court does not find that the facts warrant the application of this 
exception. "
1405,18," What raises the close but difficult question for the Court to decide in this case is the identification of the exact Defendants that 
Plaintiffs can actually enjoin under the Clayton Act and the FTCA. The difficulty arises based on the factual distinctions between 
the structure of the alleged transaction in this case and the acquisitions at issue in Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit state 
action immunity precedent. Lee County and Askew, for example, primarily concern a party's challenge to a political subdivision's 
(or state actor's) ""acquisition"" of the competitor of the entity already owned and operated by the political subdivision. Plaintiffs, 
however, do not solely challenge the Authority's acquisition of the competitor (Palmyra) of the hospital which it already owns 
(PPMH). Rather, the crux of the challenged action is the Authority's intended assignment of its control and operation of the 
acquired hospital, Palmyra, to the parent company of the acquired hospital's only current  [**53] competitor, PPHS, so as to 
circumvent the antitrust laws. In light of this distinction, the Parties rightfully dispute whether the challenged acquisition is being 
directed by the Authority or the private Phoebe Putney and HCA/Palmyra Defendants or both. Accordingly, the Court assesses 
both the challenged conduct of the Authority as a political subdivision as well as the conduct of Phoebe Putney and 
HCA/Palmyra as private entities under the appropriate state action immunity tests, which vary based on the nature of the party 
which seeks its protection. "
1407,19," By inference, therefore, the public may benefit from anticompetitive acquisitions authorized under Georgia Hospital Authorities 
Law. In this light, state action that results in public good and state action that results in anticompetitive effects are not absolutely 
mutually exclusive if such actions are taken pursuant to the aforementioned hospital authorities powers."
1407,20," Although the Georgia legislation does not explicitly authorize the anticompetitive acquisition and operation of multiple hospitals 
in a single county, as did the Alabama legislation in Askew, controlling precedent has confirmed that the enabling legislation 
need not be explicit. See supra pp. 22-23. "
1409,21," The Court's analysis solely centers on the immunity of Phoebe Putney, as Plaintiffs claim that Phoebe Putney, not 
HCA/Palmyra, directed, engaged in, and  [**68] brought about the anticompetitive conduct. Phoebe Putney, along with the 
Authority, is therefore the primary alleged violator of the FTCA and Clayton Act. (See generally Doc. 2). Moreover, any finding as 
to the application of immunity to Phoebe Putney would necessarily extend to HCA/Palmyra, as the transaction cannot proceed 
without HCA/Palmyra's sale of Palmyra to the Authority. "
1410,22," As a corollary to this power of the Authority, the Authority also bears the ultimate risk of loss with respect to Palmyra's 
operations as well as the ultimate liability incurred by the Authority as a result of Phoebe Putney's performance of its duties 
under the Management Agreement. Ex. PX009 §§ 4.01, 4.02."
1410,23," For this reason, and for reasons stated in note 8, see supra, the Authority's and HCA's and Palmyra's Alternative Motions for 
Summary Judgment (Docs. 45, 46) are DENIED. "
1413,1," Plaintiffs' counsel appears to have filed nearly the same Complaint in Franco v. Federal National Mortgage Association, Civ. 
No. 10-00735 DAE-KSC. Another judge from this district rejected that Complaint on the same day that this judge dismissed the 
Radford complaint. See Franco, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51795, 2011 WL 1842970 (D. Haw. May 13, 2011). "

1420,7," In addition, the Court dismissed Plaintiff's state law claims, because the Court found that they lacked ""sufficient allegations of

1422,9," Although Plaintiff does not plead this theory in her Second Amended Complaint, but raises it in her Opposition, the Court 
addresses it to demonstrate that even if the Court were to give Plaintiff leave to amend, yet again, these factual allegations 
would be insufficient to state  [*18] an antitrust claim against Defendant."
1422,10," Here, dismissal with prejudice is proper because, unlike the Direct Purchaser Action, which involves purchasers of iPods and 
the contention that various iterations of iTunes have changed the internal workings of the iPod, thereby affecting  [*20] those 
purchasers, this Indirect Purchaser Action only involves purchasers of music downloaded from the iTMS. Thus, even if Plaintiff "
1423,," were to be granted leave, yet again, to amend her Complaint, she would not be able to state a claim under the same theory of 
anticompetitive conduct presented in the Direct Purchaser Action. "

REALTORS, Livingston Association of REALTORS, Metropolitan Consolidated Association of REALTORS, North Oakland 
County Board of REALTORS, and Western Wayne Oakland  [*4] County Association of REALTORS. "
1430,2," The state court's analysis is more on point than Freeman v. San Diego Ass'n of Realtors, 322 F.3d 1133 (9th Cir. 2003) 
(Kozinski, J.). In that case, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the price set by Sandicor for the support fee to be charged by each 
individual realtor board was pure price fixing, as opposed to an agreement to set a price for the service as a whole. This was 
true because each realtor board had different costs to provide MLS support services  [*26] to its members, and the agreement 
they reached prohibited them from charging different prices. That sort of direct competition between brokers is not present in this 
case. "

1461,1," One shareholder, Layne Downs, was subsequently dismissed."
1461,2," Because this is an appeal from multiple entries of summary judgment, we consider ""the facts and all reasonable inferences 
drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party."" Orvis v. Johnson, 2008 UT 2, ¶ 6, 177 P.3d 600 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). In this case, the nonmoving parties are Big Ditch and the Shareholders."
1461,3," According to the City, between 1888 and 1984, the City entered into thirty-two such ""exchange agreements"" with area 
agricultural water users. "
1462,4," The named shareholders included James Garside; Ryan Litke; Layne Downs; and J L.C., a Utah limited liability company. The 
City contends that the named shareholders are all affiliated individuals who recently acquired a majority stake in Big Ditch stock 
for purely speculative purposes. This assertion is based on the City's allegation that none of these shareholders owns land 
within the Big Ditch irrigation system. Rather, according to the City's complaint, these shareholders acquired stock with the 
intention of asserting claims to, and marketing for a profit, the water rights subject to the 1905 Agreement. In addition to the four named shareholder defendants, the City also named as defendants ""John Does 1 through 10."" The City 
asserted that these unnamed individuals are ""individuals or entities that own no land that has historically been irrigated by the 
Big Ditch system and that have purchased stock in Big Ditch for the purpose of speculating in the value of the stock and the 
water rights they believe to be  [***7] represented by that stock."" The City stated that it would seek leave to amend its complaint 
to identify the John Does when their identities were discovered. It never sought such leave, and no additional shareholders were 
ever added as defendants."
1462,5," The City's complaint also asserted a claim for slander of title. This claim was dismissed by the district court. The City did not 
appeal this dismissal and therefore this claim is not before us."
1462,6," Big Ditch and the Shareholders also alleged breach of the Agreement, tortious interference with prospective business 
relationships, slander of title, forfeiture, and violation of the Utah Unfair Trade Practices Act. The parties stipulated to dismissal 
of the Unfair Trade Practices Act claim. Big Ditch has not appealed the dismissal of the other claims. "
1464,7," Big Ditch also claims that the district court erred when it denied Big Ditch's motion to reconsider whether title had been 
conveyed to the City, and the Shareholders contend that the district court improperly denied their motion for a stay pending 
discovery. Because neither of these issues was argued in the briefs, we decline to address them. See W. Jordan City v. 
Goodman, 2006 UT 27, ¶ 29, 135 P.3d 874; Valcarce v. Fitzgerald, 961 P.2d 305, 313 (Utah 1998). Moreover, because we 
conclude as a matter of law that the district court correctly held that Big Ditch conveyed to the City title to its original water rights, 
we need not address whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider that ruling. "
1467,8," Big Ditch also argues that disputes of material fact preclude summary judgment in favor of the City. We disagree. We construe 
the Agreement as a matter of law and find that any factual disputes are immaterial."
1467,9," Because we conclude that the Agreement vested title to the water rights in the City, we need not consider Big Ditch's argument 
that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Big Ditch's motion to reconsider title."
1467,10, These rulings have not been appealed and therefore are not before us. 
1469,11," Black's Law Dictionary HN13[

a seller to supply all the goods or services that a buyer needs during a specified period."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 348 (8th ed. 
2004). "
1470,12," Because there have been no substantive changes to the relevant statutes that would affect this opinion, we cite to the current 
versions, unless otherwise indicated. "
1471,13," We hold only that Big Ditch may file change applications with the State Engineer. We express no opinion as to whether the 
applications should be approved."
1471,14," The legislature has since amended this provision. The amended  [***40] provision exempts from the antitrust act ""the activities 
of a political subdivision to the extent authorized or directed by state law, consistent with the state action doctrine of federal 
antitrust law."" UTAH CODE ANN § 76-10-915(1)(f) (Supp. 2010). "
1472,15," The Shareholders argue that before the court issued its ruling on the City's motion to dismiss, they had voluntarily dismissed 
their antitrust counterclaim by removing it from the amended counterclaim and that the district court could not dismiss a claim 
that was no longer being asserted. In the alternative, the Shareholders argue that the original counterclaim was sufficiently 
meritorious to survive dismissal. Like the Shareholders, Big Ditch argues that the district court improperly considered the original 
counterclaim rather than the amended counterclaim. In addition, Big Ditch argues that its amended counterclaim stated a claim 
on which relief could be granted. Finally, Big Ditch argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied Big Ditch's 
motion to file a second amended antitrust counterclaim some four months after the antitrust claim was dismissed. We need not 
reach these arguments because we hold that the City's actions vis-à-vis the Big Cottonwood Creek water market are exempt 
from the Utah Antitrust Act. "
