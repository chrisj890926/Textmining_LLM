28,1," The Court provided this Memorandum Opinion to the parties in final form on October 31, 2011, but public release was delayed 
to ensure that no confidential business information that had been submitted under  [**2] seal was released. Based on input from 
the parties, confidential business information has been redacted from the opinion, with such redactions reflected by the insertion 
of the text ""{redacted}."" In some instances, redacted confidential business information has been replaced by more general 
language that reflects the same underlying concepts without revealing the confidential business information. Such substitutions 
are indicated by braces surrounding the substituted text. "
30,2," In this opinion, the Court will use the abbreviations ""GX"", ""GTX"", ""DX"", and ""DTX"" to refer to the government's exhibits, the 
government's trial exhibits, the defendants' exhibits, and the defendants' trial exhibits, respectively. ""TT"" refers to trial testimony. 
""PFF"" refers the plaintiff's proposed findings of fact. ""DFF"" refers to the defendants' proposed findings of fact."
30,3," The denomination of different years in the tax industry can be somewhat confusing. Tax returns are typically due in the month 
of April following the relevant tax year. Thus, each ""tax season"" refers to the period when returns for the prior ""tax year"" are 
generally completed. For example, ""tax season 2010"" refers to returns filed primarily  [**7] in early 2010, corresponding to 
income earned in ""tax year 2009."" "
32,4," The business model of offering free products and then soliciting customers to purchase additional, related features or services 
is sometimes referred to as ""freemium."" See GX 130 (""H&R Block Strategic Planning Working Session, April 16 &17, 2010"") at 
103 (""'Freemium' is a known market dynamic that has arisen in multiple product categories and will continue to grow.""). "
34,5," Two current Supreme Court justices, in their prior capacities as judges on the Court  [**23] of Appeals, participated in the D.C. 
Circuit's ruling in Baker Hughes. Then-Judge Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion and then-Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined in 
it."
34,6," In their closing argument, the defendants chided the government for citing Clayton Act Section 7 cases brought by the Federal 
Trade Commission for the relevant standard to apply in this case rather than citing to United States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 908 
F.2d 981, 982-83, 285 U.S. App. D.C. 222 (D.C. Cir. 1990), a case brought by the DOJ. Since this Circuit's FTC precedents 
themselves rely heavily on the analytical approach set forth in Baker Hughes, the defendants' distinction on this point is 
ultimately of little import. See FTC v. H.J. Heinz Co., 246 F.3d 708, 715, 345 U.S. App. D.C. 364 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (""In United 
States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 908 F.2d 981, 982-83, 285 U.S. App. D.C. 222 (D.C.Cir.1990), we explained the analytical 
approach by which the government establishes a section 7 violation.""). While a lesser showing is required to obtain preliminary 
relief in an FTC preliminary injunction case, as opposed to a full merits trial like this case, the Court must apply the Baker 
Hughes analytical framework in either type of Section 7 case. "
35,7," HN5[
] ""A relevant market has two components: (1) the relevant product market and (2) the relevant geographic market. . . . 
The 'relevant geographic market' identifies the geographic area in which the defendants compete in marketing their products or 
services."" FTC v. CCC Holdings, Inc., 605 F. Supp. 2d 26, 37 (D.D.C. 2009). The parties have stipulated that the relevant 
geographic market in this case is worldwide. Joint Pre-Hearing Statement ¶ IX, C, 12. DDIY products are provided online and 
can be used by any individual worldwide – either within the United States or abroad – who needs to prepare  [**25] and file a 
U.S. tax return. The products at issue in this case are not used for preparation of foreign tax returns. See Pl.'s Mot. For Prelim. 
Inj. at 29-30. The Court accepts the parties' stipulation as to the relevant geographic market. "
36,8," Courts  [**28] have sometimes referred to such markets-within-markets as ""submarkets."" See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325; 
Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1037-38 (Brown, J.). Other courts and commentators have criticized this ""submarket"" terminology 
as unduly confusing, however. See 5C PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 533, at 251 (3d ed. 2007) 
(""Courts sometimes describe the closest substitutes as a 'submarket' within a larger 'market' of less-close substitutes. Although 
degrees of constraint do in fact vary, the 'market' for antitrust purposes is the one relevant to the particular legal issue at hand."") 
(internal citations omitted); Geneva Pharms. Tech. Corp. v. Barr Labs, Inc., 386 F.3d 485, 496 (2d Cir. 2004) (""The term 
'submarket' is somewhat of a misnomer, since the 'submarket' analysis simply clarifies whether two products are in fact 
'reasonable' substitutes and are therefore part of the same market."")."
36,9," The D.C. Circuit's decision in Whole Foods lacked a majority opinion. See Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1061 n.8 (Kavanaugh, J., 
dissenting). Judges Brown and Tatel filed separate opinions concurring in the judgment to reverse the District Court and Judge 
Kavanaugh, in dissent, would  [**29] have affirmed. See id. at 1032 (Brown, J.); id. at 1041 (Tatel, J.); id. at 1051 n.1 
(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). Thus, in referring to the opinions in Whole Foods, the Court will indicate the name of the Judge 
whose opinion is cited."
36,10," The Merger Guidelines are not binding upon this Court, but courts in antitrust cases often look to them as persuasive authority. 
See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1081-82. "
38,11," The defendants' primary argument for inclusion of both assisted and pen-and-paper in the relevant market is based upon their 
economic expert's analysis of data derived from two consumer surveys commissioned by the defendants. The Court will analyze 
the arguments of the defendants' expert economist separately below. "
39,12," See GX 128 (HRB ""TS10 Market Dynamics"" presentation) at 38 {redacted}; see also id. {redacted}; GX 293 (Intuit Dep.) at 
21:9-14 (""The average price of a tax store is in the range of $200.""); Bennett, TT, 9/6/11 p.m., at 100 (estimating $150 range for 
assisted returns offered at Jackson Hewitt and HRB offices at Wal-Mart locations). "
40,13," By ""net-net,"" Mr. Bennett meant that while there is customer switching between the DDIY and assisted businesses, the total 
share of customers in each has been relatively stable over the past few years, such that Mr. Bennett could conclude that the two 
business lines ""do not steal customers back and forth net."" Bennett, TT, 9/6/11 a.m., at 108. "
42,14," The plaintiff presented expert testimony on market definition from Frederick R. Warren-Boulton, an economist at MiCRA, an 
economics consulting and research firm. GX 121 (Warren-Boulton Rep.) at 1. Dr. Warren-Boulton holds a B.A. from Yale 
University, a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University, and formerly served as the chief economist for the Antitrust Division 
of the U.S. Department of Justice. Id. Dr. Warren-Boulton has previously served as an expert witness in other antitrust cases, 
including cases challenging the possible anticompetitive effects of a merger or acquisition. Id. (noting involvement in FTC v. 
Staples, Inc., 970 F. Supp. 1066, 1074 (D.D.C. 1997)). The defendants presented expert testimony from Christine Siegwarth Meyer, an economist at National  [**55] Economic 
Research Associates, Inc., an economics consulting and research firm. DX 17 (Meyer Rep.) at 1. Dr. Meyer holds a B.A. from 
the United States Military Academy at West Point, a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and 
has taught economics at the university level. Id. Dr. Meyer has not previously provided expert testimony regarding the possible 
anticompetitive effects of a merger or acquisition. Meyer, TT, 9/13/11 a.m., at 39. "
43,15," Switching, as discussed further below, refers to the switching of consumers between different products for any reason. The 
IRS categorizes tax returns into one of three complexity  [**59] categories: Simple, Intermediate, and Complex. Accordingly, the 
IRS data only reflects complexity changes that are sufficient to result in assignment to a different one of the three categories. "
44,16," One limitation in the IRS data set is that if a taxpayer uses a DDIY product to prepare the return, but then prints and mails the 
return instead of e-filing it, the IRS does not attribute the filing to the DDIY provider and instead lists it in a generic ""v-coded"" pool 
of returns. At the hearing, the defendants' criticized the IRS switching data set as problematic on these grounds, suggesting that 
up to 30 million returns may be ""v-coded."" See Warren-Boulton, TT 9/20/11 a.m., at 21-22. As Dr. Warren-Boulton fully 
addressed in his expert report, however, a ""conservative method for dealing with this issue is to drop all v-coded returns from the 
analysis,"" which would still leave well over 100 million returns in the IRS data set. Id.; GX 121 (Warren-Boulton Rep.) at 47. The 
defendants did not identify any reason the v-coded data would be likely to skew the data set. Thus, even if the v-coded data is 
disregarded, the IRS data set remains extensive and reliable. It is also worth noting that the IRS data  [**63] does not distinguish 
between the DDIY providers' various products, so only firm-level switching rates are available. GX 121 (Warren-Boulton Rep.) at 
47 "
45,17," The formula for critical loss is L = X/(X + M), where L is the critical loss, X is the percentage price increase, and M is the 
hypothetical monopolist's gross margin. Assuming a  [**64] 50 percent margin, which Dr. Warren-Boulton claims is a 
conservative estimate for firms in the DDIY market, then the critical loss for a 10 percent SSNIP is 16.7 percent. 16.7 percent is 
the result of applying 10 percent and 50 percent in the formula X/(X+M): .167 = .1/(.1+.5)."
45,18, These are the last two years for which this data was available.
45,19," The defendants also referred obliquely in cross examination to an academic debate surrounding the proper way to perform 
critical loss analysis. Warren-Boulton, TT, 9/9/11 p.m., at 23. Dr. Warren-Boulton  [**67] acknowledged his awareness of the 
existence of this debate and the defendants' counsel did not pursue the topic further. Id. The Court has no basis for disputing Dr. 
Warren-Boulton's application of critical loss analysis based merely on the existence of unspecified academic critiques. The Court 
notes thatHN15[
]  the critical loss analysis is specifically endorsed by the Merger Guidelines as a method for implementing the 
SSNIP test, see Merger Guidelines § 4.1.3, and has been accepted by courts as a standard methodology. See FTC v. CCC 
Holdings Inc., 605 F. Supp. 2d 26, 40 n.16 (D.D.C. 2009) (""Critical loss analysis is a standard tool used by economists to study 
potentially relevant markets.""). The court in CCC Holdings ultimately did not rely on the expert's application of critical loss "
46,," analysis due to what the court deemed a ""gap"" or oversight in the expert's reasoning, but the court nonetheless adopted the 
same relevant product market that the critical loss analysis had validated. See id. at 40-41."
46,20," Dr. Warren-Boulton's merger simulation is addressed further below in the Court's discussion of unilateral effects in Section 
III.B.2.c. "
48,21," The Best  [**75] of Both product, as the name implies, actually combines aspects of DDIY and assisted. It enables a return 
completed on HRB's DDIY product to be reviewed by a tax professional. See DX 17 (Meyer Rep.) at 13 n.44. Thus, it is hardly 
surprising that this ""hybrid"" product, which features such exhaustive service, is priced more expensively than a typical DDIY 
product. "
49,22," Dr. Meyer testified at the hearing that these anomalies are not reflected in the underlying simulator Excel data, but rather 
appear only in the printouts of simulator data contained in the internal HRB Powerpoint. In addition, Dr. Meyer explained that she 
redid her calculations excluding the anomalous data and came up with the same conclusions. See Meyer, TT, 9/12/11 p.m., at 
45-47. Dr. Meyer never identified the source or cause of the anomalies, however. Id. at 49."
49,23," Prior to the hearing in this case, the government filed a motion in limine to exclude this survey from evidence and to limit Dr. 
Meyer's opinion to the extent it relied on the survey. See ECF No. 60. The government argued that the survey's wording and 
methodology made it inherently unreliable and therefore inadmissible. While the Court noted that the government had identified 
 [**82] a number of defects in the methodology and wording of the survey, the Court concluded that these defects did not 
undermine the survey and the expert's reliance on it so overwhelmingly as to render the survey inadmissible, especially in a 
bench trial. See Memorandum Opinion and Order on Motion in Limine, September 6, 2011, ECF No. 84."
49,24," The response options varied among four different categories of filers, which are discussed further below. For example, the list 
of options presented to filers who completed a free federal tax return and no state return were: ""I would prepare myself without 
help,"" ""TurboTax Free Edition,"" ""H&R Block at Home Free Edition,"" ""Free TaxUSA Free Edition,"" ""Complete Tax Free Basic,"" "
50,," ""An Accountant,"" ""I would use a product on FFA [i.e., Free File Alliance],"" ""TaxSlayer Free Edition,"" ""Jackson Hewitt Free Basic,"" 
""Tax$imple Free Basic,"" and ""Other."" GX604 at 2."
50,25," Dr. Dhar did not testify in person at the hearing, but provided an expert report and affidavit. "
51,26," Of course, the Court remains cognizant that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof in demonstrating the relevant market."
51,27," For example, Dr. Meyer's description of the pricing simulator survey as one in which the ""pricing of the various options 
changed across scenarios"" was inaccurate insofar as several of the most significant products  [**88] for the purposes of Dr. 
Meyer's analysis did not have any prices associated with them at all. See discussion supra. "
53,28," New entrants to the market would not only face all of the barriers to expansion already faced by the existing small firms 
offering DDIY products, they would also have to develop their own products, including a software platform and a sufficient level 
of tax expertise. For entry to be considered timely, it typically must occur within approximately two years post-merger. See 
Commentary on the Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2006) at 45-46 (discussing prior Merger Guidelines § 3.2, which specified 
that timely entry should occur within two years). It is unlikely that an entirely new entrant to the market could compete 
meaningfully with the established DDIY firms within that time frame. "
54,29," The defendants  [**102] attempt to reframe this disparity by noting that their calculation of TaxSlayer's projected tax season 
2015 marketing budget would slightly surpass the amount of TaxACT's actual 2011 marketing budget. Defs.' Post-Trial Mem. at 
23. Setting aside the validity of the defendants' aggressive projections of TaxSlayer's 2015 budget, a proper comparison would 
have to be founded upon a comparable projection of TaxACT's 2015 budget—not TaxACT's actual 2011 numbers, for which the 
relevant comparison is TaxSlayer's 2011 numbers. "
56,30," The government also cites an informal analysis written by Adam Newkirk, an analyst for HRB's DDIY business. Mr. Newkirk's 
analysis hypothesized that one possible reason for HRB to acquire TaxACT was that HRB and Intuit would jointly control a large 
DDIY market share post-merger and would ""both obviously have great incentive to keep this channel profitable,"" while other 
potential purchasers of TaxACT ""could decide to cut prices even further . . . ."" See Newkirk, TT, 9/7/11 a.m., at 100; GX 18. The 
Court finds that the government overemphasized the importance and relevance of Mr. Newkirk's analysis.  [**109] The hearing 
testimony showed that Mr. Newkirk is a data analyst who had no decision-making role or authority in relation to the merger and 
that his discussion about the rationales for the merger was informal speculation. See Newkirk, TT, 9/7/11 p.m., at 42-44. Even 
so, this reasoning – independently reached by Intuit – is essentially a précis of the government's coordinated effects concern. "
59,31, The first criterion in this analysis is satisfied because it is undisputed that DDIY products are differentiated.
59,32," Before the hearing, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence relating to this guarantee. ECF No. 44. Following 
oral argument at the pre-hearing conference, the plaintiff withdrew this motion. See Minute Entry dated September 2, 2011. "
60,33," In the defendants' submissions to the Antitrust Division of the DOJ prior to this litigation, the defendants appeared to 
emphasize this ""value"" and ""premium"" distinction as the basis for their definition of the relevant market. See GX 135 at 14-15; 
GX 629 at 18-30. As a result, the government accuses the defendants of having ""tacked back and forth"" regarding their 
proposed relevant market definition. Pl.'s Post-Trial Mem. at 1-2. While the Court agrees that the import of the hearing testimony 
about value and premium products was not always clear, the defendants' counsel clarified during closing arguments that the 
""only real relevance"" of the premium versus value distinction was to show that HRB and TaxACT are not closest the competitors 
for the purposes  [**124] of unilateral effects analysis. Defs.' Closing Argument, TT, 10/3/2011 a.m., at 93-94."
60,34," The relevance of the diversion estimates provided by the expert economists to the unilateral effects analysis is discussed 
more fully below. "
61,35," ""As a matter of applied economics, evaluation of unilateral effects does not require a market definition in the traditional sense 
at all."" Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 913a, at 66. This is so because unilateral effects analysis focuses on measuring a firm's market 
power directly by ""estimating the change in residual demand facing the post-merger firm. 'Residual demand' refers to the 
demand for a firm's goods after the output of all other competing firms has been taken into account."" Id. at 63. If market power 
itself can be directly measured or estimated reliably, then in theory market definition is superfluous, at least as a matter of 
economics, because ""[i]dentifying a market and computing market shares provide an indirect means for measuring market 
power."" Id. ¶ 532a at 242-43; see also id. ¶ 521c. The 2010 revisions to the Merger Guidelines also appear to reflect this 
understanding. See Merger Guidelines § 4 (""The Agencies' analysis need not start with market definition. Some of the analytical 
tools used by  [**129] the Agencies to assess competitive effects do not rely on market definition, although evaluation of 
competitive alternatives available to customers is always necessary at some point in the analysis.""). As a legal matter, however, 
a market definition may be required by Section 7 of the Clayton Act. See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 324 (""[D]etermination of the 
relevant market is a necessary predicate to a finding of a violation of the Clayton Act because the threatened monopoly must be 
one which will substantially lessen competition 'within the area of effective competition.' Substantiality can be determined only in 
terms of the market affected. The 'area of effective competition' must be determined by reference to a product market (the 'line of 
commerce') and a geographic market (the 'section of the country')."") (internal citation omitted); see also Heinz, 246 F.3d at 719 
n.17 (""Courts interpret 'line of commerce' [in the language of the Clayton Act] as synonymous with the relevant product 
market.""). The Court is not aware of any modern Section 7 case in which the court dispensed with the requirement to define a 
relevant product market, although Judge Brown's opinion in Whole Foods may be  [**130] read to endorse this possibility in 
accordance with the evolving understandings in economics. See Whole Foods, 548 F.3d at 1036 (Brown, J.) (stating that the 
Baker Hughes analytical framework, which ""rests on defining a market and showing undue concentration in that market,"" ""does 
not exhaust the possible ways to prove a § 7 violation on the merits"")."
61,36," The Commentary on the Merger Guidelines, for its part, explains that while ""[a]s an empirical matter, the unilateral effects 
challenges made by the Agencies nearly always have involved combined shares greater than 35%,"" ""the Agencies may 
challenge mergers when the combined share falls below 35% if the analysis of the mergers' particular unilateral competitive 
effects indicates that they would be likely substantially to lessen competition."" Commentary on the Horizontal Merger Guidelines 
(2006) at 26. ""Combined shares less than 35% may be sufficiently high to produce a substantial unilateral anticompetitive effect 
if the products are differentiated and the merging products are especially close substitutes . . . ."" Id. "
62,37," Dr. Warren-Boulton declined to rely on the defendants' proposed diversion data, derived from their consumer surveys, for the 
reasons already discussed supra in Section III.A.3. "
63,38," As a basis for this conclusion that switching data overstates diversion and for his choice to discount the DDIY-to-assisted 
switching rate by half, Dr. Warren-Boulton relies upon HRB documents that suggest that more than half of switching from DDIY 
to assisted occurs for reasons unrelated to price, such as a change in tax complexity. GX 121 (Warren-Boulton Rep.) at 46 
n.128 (citing GX 635, GX 126). He also relies on IRS data showing that customers switching from DDIY to assisted were twice 
as likely to have a complexity increase as taxpayers who stayed within DDIY. Id. at 47."
63,39," As discussed in Section III.B.2.d below, the Court finds most of defendants' claimed efficiencies  [**137] are not merger-
specific or unverifiable."
63,40," The defendants suggest that Dr. Warren-Boulton's reliance on market share as an estimate of diversion ratios is somewhat 
circular in that his market shares derive from his market definition, which, in turn, relied on his use of switching data as a proxy "
64,," for diversion ratios. DX 17 (Meyer Rep.) at 76. As discussed above, however, the Court's finding that DDIY is the correct 
relevant product market is not dependent on Dr. Warren-Boulton's analysis. "
65,41," ""Cognizable efficiencies"" are a subset of ""synergies."" ""Synergies"" refer more generally to any business performance benefits 
that result from the merger of two companies. See Zmijewski, TT, 9/19/11 a.m., at 99."
65,42," Originally, the defendants claimed 11 efficiencies, including an efficiency related to {redacted}. This task is ""really not an 
efficiency"" but ""an additional cost,"" Dunn, TT, 9/8/11 p.m. (sealed) at 7, and defendants do not reference it in their proposed 
findings of fact. DFF ¶ 291. "
66,43," Dr. Zmijewski is a professor of accounting and deputy dean at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a 
founder and principal of Navigant Economics, a consulting firm. GX 664 (Zmijewski Rep.) at 5. He holds a Ph.D. in accounting.

67,44," In addition, the defendants have not addressed how much of the claimed efficiencies would be passed through to consumers. 
See Staples, 970 F. Supp. at 1090 (analyzing projected pass-through rate for claimed efficiencies). "
70,1," In considering Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, the Court  [**3] considers the facts alleged in Plaintiffs' Complaint to be true. See

84,1," This statute provides: HN1[

85,2," HN2[
] Rule 24(c) of the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a motion to intervene ""be accompanied by a pleading 
setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought."" Because no such proposed pleading was filed in this matter, 
the court could have dismissed the motion for failure to comply with the rule, but it did not. Neither the State nor MaineHealth 
raised this deficiency to the court in their memoranda in opposition to intervention, however, and the court's decision to address 
the motion on its merits did not constitute obvious error. See Kondaur Capital Corp. v. Hankins, 2011 ME 82, ¶ 15, 25 A.3d 960 
(stating that HN3[
] unpreserved errors will be reviewed only for any ""seriously prejudicial error tending to produce a manifest

substantial percentage of airline bookings is a relevant geographic market, including the United States, the United Kingdom, 
Belgium, and Switzerland."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 120.) But in its response to Travelport's motion to dismiss, following a jurisdictional 
challenge from Travelport, American states that ""the [amended complaint]'s allegations with respect to [Traveport]'s market 
share and conduct in certain foreign markets are not intended to demonstrate that [Travelport] has unlawfully monopolized those 
markets."" (Pl.'s Resp. to Travelport's Mot. to Dismiss 16 (doc. 107).) Instead, says American, ""the [amended complaint] alleges 
that Travelport used its monopoly power in those markets in order to quash [American]'s attempt to introduce competition to 
[Travelport]'s GDSs in the United States."" (Id. at 16-17.) Thus, American's response clarifies that the geographical scope of its 
alleged product market and submarkets is limited to the United States. "

observed that it ""has preferred to resolve antitrust claims on a case-by-case basis, focusing on the particular facts disclosed by 
the record."" Id. at 467 (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, rather than label the Travelport and Sabre 
submarkets ""single-brand markets"" and dismissing them on the basis of that label, the Court is of the opinion that it must look to 
the commercial realities of the airline industry, as depicted in American's complaint."
102,6," The Court notes that the instant case is distinguishable from PSKS, Inc. v. Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc., 615 F.3d 
412 (5th Cir. 2010), in which the Fifth Circuit affirmed a district court's rejection of the proffered market consisting of defendant's 
single brand of products. In that case, the Fifth Circuit noted that single-brand markets are appropriate only in ""rare 
circumstances"" and, indeed, even seemed to suggest that such circumstances were ""limited to situations in which consumers 
are 'locked in' to a specific brand by the nature of the product."" Leegin, 615 F.3d at 418. But the court's decision to reject the 
proffered single-brand market in that case was based on its finding that the plaintiff had failed to plead that there was a 
""structural barrier to the interchangeability of [the defendant's] products with goods produced by competing manufacturers."" Id. 
The court did not reach its decision merely because a single-brand market was involved. Id. Here, American has alleged the 
existence of structural barriers to the interchangeability of the GDSes's respective services, as well as a number of other facts 
showing that GDSes are not substitutes for one another. Thus, Leegin is distinguishable. The instant case is also distinguishable 
from United Farmers Agents Association v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, 89 F.3d 233 (5th Cir. 1996), another case in which the 
Fifth Circuit rejected a proffered single-brand market. In that case, the Fifth Circuit found that the plaintiffs--insurance agents--
had not alleged the existence of ""a superior or unique insurance product that allow[ed] [defendant Farmers Insurance] to charge 
consumers more for policies or pay agents less for selling them."" Farmers, 89 F.3d at 236. The Farmers court also found that the 
plaintiffs had ""shown no evidence that new Farmers agents would face significant information or switching costs."" Id. The court 
therefore concluded that the plaintiffs ""ha[d] failed to give [it] any reason to view the market for electronic access to Farmers 
policy information as the relevant market."" Id. In the instant case, by contrast, American has pleaded facts showing that the 
GDSes have unique power that enables them to charge airlines high booking fees. American has also alleged that the GDSes' 
power is maintained in part because of the significant switching costs that travel agents face. Thus, Farmers is distinguishable 
from the instant case. "
103,7," Travelport contends that American's claims are based on the ""content parity"" provision of the PFA, which was executed in 
2006, and are barred by the Sherman Act's four-year statute of limitations. 15 U.S.C.A. § 15b. In response, American insists that 
its claims based on the PFA are preserved by the continuing-violation theory and that, even if they are not, American can use 
those allegations as proof that Travelport is liable for monopolization during the limitations period. In the Court's view, the 
applicable statute of limitations does not bar American's PFA-related allegations. American's monopolization claims are not 
based heavily on the PFA; rather American simply points to the PFA as an example of what it considers a larger continuing effort 
by Travelport to exclude competition in the Travelport submarket. Therefore, although ultimately American will only be able to 
recover damages incurred as a result of acts committed during the limitations period, American may rely on its PFA-related 
allegations to establish that Travelport is liable for monopolization. See Imperial Point Colonnades Condo., Inc. v. Mangurian, 
549 F.2d 1029, 1034-35 (5th Cir. 1977). "
104,8," Sabre and Travelport also point out that they have no duty to assist competitors. They contend that any refusal on their part to 
deal with third party providers such as Farelogix is not offensive to the antitrust laws. But the sum of American's allegations is 
not that Sabre and Travelport have declined to assist competitors; it is that they have taken actions intended to destroy 
competition in the Market and the relevant submarkets. For example, American alleges that Sabre terminated its developer 
agreement with Farelogix after Farelogix worked with American on developing AA Direct Connect. According to American, 
Sabre's actions were intended to stifle innovation and competition in the airline flight-booking industry. "
105,9," Although Copperweld birthed this rule in the context of a section 1 claim, the rule covers section 2 conspiracy cases as well. 
See Stewart Glass & Mirror, Inc. v. U.S.A. Glas, Inc., 17 F. Supp. 2d 649, 657 (E.D. Tex. 1998). The parties appear to agree on 
this."
105,10," Admittedly, it is difficult to discern from American's amended complaint the precise timing of Orbitz's ownership changes. But 
the Court must draw all reasonable inferences in American's favor. See Kaiser Aluminum, 677 F.2d at 1050. "
106,11," In its response brief, American purports to explain ""why GDSs and their travel agency subscribers, including Orbitz, share a 
common economic interest in preserving the GDSs' [alleged] monopoly positions."" (American's Resp. to Orbitz's Mot. to Dismiss 
8.) But American also alleges that Orbitz's agreements with [Travelport] were not in fact rational or part of a competitive business 
strategy."" (Id. at 10.) These two statements, in the Court's view, seem to contradict one another. It is unclear to the Court how 
Orbitz's contracts can accurately reflect a shared economic interest with Travelport and, at the same time, lack any rational 
justification or connection to Orbitz's business strategy. Thus, even assuming American had adequately alleged an industry-wide 
conspiracy, the Court is not persuaded that the motive behind such a conspiracy is evident from the amended complaint."
106,12," American contends that, for purposes of its conspiracy claims, the Court should aggregate the effects of Travelport's 
agreements with Orbitz and the effects of Travelport's agreements with other travel-agent subscribers. This argument, however, "
107,," presumes that American has properly pleaded a conspiracy among Travelport, Orbitz, and its other travel-agent subscribers. 
And as previously noted, American has not adequately alleged such a conspiracy. Moreover, even assuming American had sufficiently pleaded the existence of several discrete vertical conspiracies, the effects of 
each agreement would have to be considered individually, not in the aggregate. ""Indeed, to hold otherwise would be to suggest 
that the distinction between a single conspiracy and multiple conspiracies involving a common defendant is one without a 
difference."" Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 210 (4th Cir. 2002)."
107,13," Section 1 states, ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or 
commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1."
107,14," ""Once a plaintiff establishes that a conspiracy occurred, whether it violates § 1 is determined by the application of either the 
per se rule or the rule of reason."" Golden Bridge, 547 F.3d at 271 (citing Spectators' Commc'n Network, Inc. v. Colonial Country 
Club, 253 F.3d 215, 222-23 (5th Cir. 2001)). Should ""the court determine[] that the defendant's conduct 'would always or almost 
always tend to restrict competition and decrease output,' the restraint is per se illegal and no further inquiry occurs."" Golden 
Bridge, 547 F.3d at 271 (citing Leegin Creative Leather Prods. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 886, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 
623 (2007)). But ""if the conduct is not deemed per se unreasonable, the plaintiff will also have to prove that the conduct 
unreasonably restrains trade in light of actual market forces under the rule of reason."" Golden Bridge, 547 F.3d at 271 (citing 
Leegin, 551 U.S. at 886). Most cases will require analysis under the rule of reason. See N. Tex. Specialty Physicians v. F.T.C., 
528 F.3d 346, 360 (5th Cir. 2008) (noting that the Supreme Court ""has analyzed most restraints under the so-called rule of 
reason"" (footnote omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted)). American does not allege that the defendants' activities are per se illegal under section 1. Moreover, American's complaint 
pleads only vertical agreements, which are analyzed under the rule of reason. See Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. 
PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 907, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007). "
108,15," Sabre also contends that American cannot challenge its own contracts because American is equally responsible for any 
antitrust violation that occurs as a result of its contracts. In Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corporation, 392 U.S. 
134, 140, 88 S. Ct. 1981, 20 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1968), overruled on other grounds by Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 777, the Supreme 
Court held that the doctrine of in pari delicto is not a defense to an antitrust action. The Court, however, left open the question of 
whether a plaintiff could be barred from recovering against a defendant on the basis of the plaintiff's ""truly complete involvement 
and participation in a monopolistic scheme."" Perma, 392 U.S. at 140. The first amended complaint, which the Court must take as true, does not paint the picture of American as a coparticipant in the 
alleged industry-wide conspiracy. Thus, for purposes of this motion, American lacks any ""truly complete involvement [or] 
participation in a monopolistic scheme,"" and Sabre cannot avail itself of the defense of in pari delicto. Id. The implication of 
American's lack of involvement in a Sabre-related conspiracy, however, is that American cannot rely on its own contracts with 
Sabre to establish a section 1 violation because Sabre cannot be unilaterally liable under section 1. See Metro Ford, 145 F.3d at 
325 (""Independent action is not proscribed [by section 1]."")."
108,16," As it did with its section 2 conspiracy-to-monopolize claims, American contends that, for purposes of its section 1 claims, the 
Court should aggregate the effects of Travelport's agreements with Orbitz and the effects of Travelport's agreements with other 
travel-agent subscribers. As previously noted, this argument fails because American has not adequately pleaded a conspiracy 
among Travelport, Orbitz, and its other travel-agent subscribers and because the effects of each alleged vertical agreement 
between Travelport and each of its subscribers must be considered individually, not in the aggregate. See supra note 12."
108,17," For example, American alleges that ""[b]oth Sabre and Travelport enter into long term contracts with travel agents, typically 
three years but sometimes longer. Most of these contracts include some type of provision that either requires or provides 
financial incentives for the travel agents to use one GDS exclusively, or nearly exclusively."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 63.) In addition, 
elsewhere American alleges that ""[s]ome agreements between the GDSs and their subscribers contain an express provision that 
requires the travel agent to use one GDS exclusively, either for all its bookings or for bookings at particular locations or for 
particular corporate customers."" (Id. ¶ 65.) "
109,18," To illustrate, consider a scenario in which ""Travel Agency A"" has a market share of 3% and ""Travel Agency B"" has a market 
share of 45%. A conspiracy involving Sabre and Travel Agency A would not foreclose a substantial share of the market, whereas 
a conspiracy between Sabre and Travel Agency B likely would."
109,19," The Court notes that American's failure to identify Sabre's coconspirators and to point to a specific agreement involving Sabre 
not only means that American has failed to plead foreclosure of a substantial share of the market (element two), it also means 
that American has failed to adequately allege a conspiracy involving Sabre in the first place (element one). The Court did not 
address this in its discussion of element one (i.e., the existence of a conspiracy), however, because Sabre did not raise it. 
Morever, in evaluating whether substantial foreclosure has occurred, the Court cannot aggregate the effects of Sabre's 
agreements with its travel agents for the reasons set forth in footnote 12. See supra note 12."
109,20," To state a claim ""for tortious interference with an existing contract, a plaintiff must demonstrate '(1) the existence of a contract 
subject to interference, (2) the act of interference was willful and intentional, (3) such intentional act was a proximate cause of 
plaintiff's damage and (4) actual damage or loss occurred.'"" Stewart, 200 F.3d at 316 (quoting Johnson v. Hosp. Corp. of Am., 
95 F.3d 383, 394 (5th Cir. 1996)). Similarly, to state a claim for tortious interference with prospective contract or business 
relationships, a plaintiff must allege facts showing: (1) a reasonable probability that the parties would have entered into a contractual relationship, (2) an intentional and 
malicious act by the defendant that prevented the relationship from [*39]  occurring, with the purpose of harming the 
plaintiff, (3) the defendant lacked privilege or justification to do the act, and (4) actual harm or damage resulted from the 
defendant's interference. "

175,7," Relying on Justice Brennan's concurrence, at least one lower Court has denied application of the Capper-Volstead exemption 
to integrated producers. In United States v. Hinote, 823 F. Supp. 1350 (S.D. Miss 1993)  [**24] the district court reasoned that 
applying Capper-Volstead to integrated producers would allow large agribusinesses organized to market and sell agricultural 
products to exempt themselves from the antitrust laws by simply purchasing or leasing some interest in a farming operation, no 
matter how de minimis the interest. Id. at 1359. The court concluded that such a result would undermine Congress' express 
purpose in enacting the Capper-Volstead Act. Id."
175,8," As an additional ground for denying the motion to dismiss, the Court notes that the Capper-Volstead exemption is an 
affirmative defense. Alexander v. National Farmers Organization, 687 F.2d 1173, 1184 (8th Cir. 1982)(the Capper Volstead 
exemption ""is an affirmative defense. . . .""). See also Fairdale Farms, Inc. v. Yankee Milk, Inc., 635 F.2d 1037, 1039 (2nd Cir. 
1980) (referring to Capper-Volstead exemption as an affirmative defense); Northern California Supermarkets, Inc. v. Central 
California, 413 F. Supp. 984, 987 (D.C. Cal. 1976) (referencing the Capper-Volstead as an affirmative defense). In general, the 
merits of an affirmative defense cannot be properly addressed through Rule 12(b)(6), but should be resolved at trial or on 
summary judgment. See In re Southeastern Milk Antitrust Litigation, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44541, 2008 WL 2368212 (E.D. 
Tenn. 2008). "
176,9," Federal agencies have also recognized that production limitations are 9 not permitted under Capper-Volstead. To the degree 
there is ambiguity in the statute on this issue, agencies with jurisdiction over the statue are typically entitled to Chevron 
deference, and their decisions would be persuasive. National Cable & Telecomms. Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 
967, 980, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 162 L. Ed. 2d 820 (2005). The DOJ and the FTC, the prime agencies responsible for enforcing 
federal antitrust laws, suggest a narrow interpretation of Capper-Volstead. The FTC's position seems clear from its statements in 
California Lettuce as explained below. As for the DOJ, it has expressed its position in its report to the task group on antitrust 
immunities. The DOJ explained that there is ""evidence that Congress was concerned about the right or ability of cooperatives to 
restrict the supply of agricultural commodities."" A Report of the U.S. Department of Justice to the Task Group on Antitrust 
Immunities, p. 68 (1977), Dkt. 111-14, Ex. M. The DOJ went on to state that ""[i]t is not surprising that Congress did not 
specifically grant to the cooperatives the power to restrict supply . . . ."" Id. The DOJ concluded  [**29] that ""it would not be the act 
of a rational legislature to give the cooperatives the power to deal with overproduction, a factor which had been demonstrated 
was not a cause of the crisis it was addressing."" Id. at 68-69. The USDA's position has also been consistent with that of DOJ and FTC and in opposition to a view that production curtailments 
are allowed under Capper-Volstead. The USDA has issued reports and guidelines to farmers indicating that ""it is not legal for 
cooperatives to control members' production. The basic role of cooperatives is to market the available supply in the most 
effective manner possible, not to limit production."" Farmer Cooperatives in the United States, Cooperative Information Report 1

below. "
184,15," During oral argument, Pleasant Valley's counsel asserted that Pleasant Valley is a packing shed only, and that it does not

arguments made in the parties' summary judgment briefing related to the statutory interpretation issue here."
212,13," Defendant asserts in a footnote of its reply supporting its motion to dismiss that because Plaintiffs' union agreed that the Hotel 
could keep seven percent of the banquet service charges, there is an authorization in writing that ""dooms [Plaintiffs'] claim."" 
Def.'s Reply at 3 n.1. As discussed earlier, the Court cannot consider the CBA in deciding this Motion to Dismiss. The Court 
declines to convert the Motion to Dismiss to a motion for summary judgment (which would have required notice of the Court's 
intention and an opportunity for the parties to supplement the record). In any event, the Court has previously rejected this 
argument in Wadsworth. ""[I]f under state law a waiver of rights is permissible, 'the  [**47] CBA must include clear and 
unmistakable language waiving the covered employee's state right for a court to even consider whether it could be given effect.'""

Order 1, the butterfat percentage  [**29] of milk, the volume produced per farmer, and Class I utilization rates. At the time of his 
Initial Declaration, Dr. Rausser's model did ""not take into account the potential effect of patronage refunds [which] represent 
annual credits that cooperatives provide to their members as a means of distributing the cooperative's profits."" (Doc. 206-1 at ¶ 
242). Dr. Rausser conceded that ""[w]hether these 'refunds' can be deemed an additional payment for milk (and thus a potential 
offset against damages) depends upon the specifics of the program."" Id."
273,13," DFA and DMS contend that Plaintiffs and Dr. Rausser misunderstands GNEMMA and that the only premium that GNEMMA as 
a whole sets is the premium to charge customers for rbST-free raw milk. They contend that GNEMMA does not set ""over order"" 
premiums across Order 1. (Doc. 281-8 at 12.) "
275,14," At the parties' request, the class certification hearing was postponed twice."
275,15," See Doc. 332-2 at 3 (""In his latest report, Dr. Kalt purports to be responding to 'new' analyses appearing four weeks earlier in 
 [**36] my rebuttal declaration. This characterization is incorrect. Each and every one of the analyses in my rebuttal was a direct 
response to a critique advanced by Dr. Kalt in his initial report, and the large majority of them were devoted to correcting Dr. 
Kalt's own analyses and demonstrating that those analyses (once corrected) do not support his conclusions.""). "
276,16," The court does not regard this observation as a conclusive determination of the merits of Plaintiffs' causation and damages 
theory. See Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177, 94 S. Ct. 2140, 40 L. Ed. 2d 732 (1974)."
276,17," The court acknowledges that Plaintiffs need not prove their entire case to the court in order to obtain class certification, 
however, they must show that ""whatever underlying facts are relevant to a particular Rule 23 requirement have been 
established[.]"" IPO, 471 F.3d at 41. "
277,18," DFA and DMS more specifically describe the issue as follows: Moreover, the very economic theory of Plaintiffs' case precludes any claim of commonality. Plaintiffs insist that the 
suppression of farmers' prices resulted in supra-competitive  [**45] profits for conspiring milk processors—by paying less 
for raw milk, processors were able to increase their margins and profits. But there are thousands of putative class 
members—e.g., the farmers who belong to the Agri-Mark coop in Vermont, and to the Upstate/Niagara coop in New York—
whose cooperatives own their own milk processing plants, such that whatever profits those plants generate are returned to 
the coops' dairy farmer members. Depending on the extent to which their coops are vertically integrated into owning plants, 
these farmers would have benefited from the price suppression alleged by Plaintiffs (e.g., if their coops are net buyers of 
raw milk), or broken even (e.g., if their coops simply processed the milk produced by their farmers). Only by examining 
these farmers' individual circumstances can the impact of alleged antitrust violations, if any, be determined. (Doc. 281-8 at 8). "
280,19," Plaintiffs assert that the facts before the court are no different than those considered by the court when it certified a settlement 
class for the purposes  [**56] of the Dean Settlement. However, no member of the Dean Settlement Class could be said to 
occupy the status of both plaintiff and quasi-defendant. Here, individual dairy farmers including dairy farmer members of DMS 
would be pursuing relief against dairy farmer-owned DMS."
280,20," With regard to the Dean Settlement, only a few dairy farmers opposed Dean's proposal to pay $30 million in order to settle all 
claims against it in this lawsuit."
280,21," As Plaintiffs point out, on remand in Pickett, the District Court certified a narrower class than that proposed by the plaintiffs to 
address the conflict. Pickett v. IBP, Inc., 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22453, 2001 WL 34886460 at, *10-11 (M.D. Ala. Dec. 26, 2001). 
A similar result is warranted here."
280,22," As the court in Southeastern Milk found, Plaintiffs'  [**58] challenges to DFA's full supply agreements pose a clear conflict 
because ""injunctive relief preventing DFA and other Defendants from entering into full supply agreements is something at the 
very heart of plaintiffs' claims,"" and yet some DFA farmers claim ""[t]he DFA supply agreements at issue in this case have 
guaranteed farmers a stable, secure and needed market for their raw milk, something especially essential to staying in business, 
especially for farmers in surplus areas and small farmers."" Se. Milk, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83196, 2011 WL 3205798, at *3-4. "
281,23," The court in Southeastern Milk properly framed (and answered) the dispositive question as follows: Is there proof that the interests of the nominal plaintiffs are in conflict with, or antagonistic to, the interests of the DFA 
members of the class? In other words, are DFA members of the class entitled to class representatives who share their 
interests when making decisions about whether to invalidate business practices and seek a money judgment from the 
cooperative? On the current state of the record, the Court concludes that the answer to both question is ""yes."" Se. Milk, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83196, 2011 WL 3205798, at * 7. "

286,1," An authority may not, however, ""operate or construct any project for profit.""  [**4] O.C.G.A. § 31-7-77. "
287,2," Each authority's exercise of these powers, however, is generally limited to its own city or county, or, under limited 
circumstances, only slightly beyond those boundaries. The statute defines an authority's ""[a]rea of operation"" as ""the area within 
the city or county activating an authority,"" as well as ""any other city or county in which the authority wishes to operate, provided 
the governing authorities and the board of any hospital authorities of such city and county request or approve such operation."" 
Id. § 31-7-71(1). And the statute's definition  [**5] of ""project"" suggests that an operation qualifies as a project only if it falls within 
the city or county in which the authority is located, within the authority's area of operation, or within a city or county whose 
governing bodies and hospital authority have approved the project. See id. § 31-7-71(5). An authority in a low-population county, 
however, may locate a project in a county contiguous to its area of operation. Id. § 31-7-89.1(d). The statute also sometimes 
allows projects as far as 12 miles from the city or county in which an authority is located. Id. § 31-7-72(f)."
287,3," The facts set out in subpart B are as reflected in the complaint in this case and are not materially disputed. In reciting the 
provisions of the Hospital Authorities Law we took judicial notice of such provisions."
287,4," The Authority's contractual arrangement with PPMH and PPHS provides that, upon the termination or expiration of the lease to 
PPMH, both PPMH and PPHS are to be dissolved and their assets are to revert to the Authority."
287,5," HCA, Inc. is a for-profit corporation that operates hospitals in twenty states."
287,6, The geographic market for Memorial and Palmyra consists of Dougherty and five surrounding counties.
287,7," PPHS would provide $195 million, and the Authority would use such funds to purchase Palmyra's assets. If the plan were not 
carried to fruition, PPHS would pay HCA, Inc. a fee of $35 million."
287,8," The plan called for the cancellation of PPMH's Memorial lease and the execution of an instrument under which the Authority 
would lease both Memorial  [**8] and Palmyra to PPHS or a PPHS subsidiary for a term of 40 years. Prior to the execution of 
this lease, the Authority would contract with a newly organized PPHS subsidiary, Phoebe North, Inc., to operate Palmyra. "
288,9," HN4[
] Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act allows courts to grant a preliminary injunction against defendants in an action brought by the Commission provided there is a ""proper showing that, weighing the equities and considering the 
Commission's likelihood of ultimate success, [granting the injunction] would be in the public interest."" 15 U.S.C. § 53(b). "
289,10," We held in Crosby v. Hospital Authority of Valdosta and Lowndes County, 93 F.3d 1515 (11th Cir. 1996), that a hospital 
authority created by the Georgia Hospital Authorities Law, O.C.G.A. § 31-7-70 et seq., was, for purposes of state-action 
immunity, a political subdivision of the state. 93 F.3d at 1525."
289,11," For purposes of our state-action analysis, we consider all the anticipated stages of the plan approved by the Authority—the 
purchase of Palmyra's assets, as well as their temporary management by, and subsequent lease to, PPHS or a PPHS 
subsidiary—as parts of a single ""acquisition"" under the Clayton Act."
289,12," The Commission would have us approach the state-action issue differently. It argues that this case involves no ""genuine state 
action"" at all. Appellant's Br. 24. According to the Commission, the challenged plan is, in substance, a transfer of control of a 
hospital  [**15] from one private party to another—a transfer engineered by a private party and only rubber-stamped by a 
governmental entity. In the absence of genuine state action, the Commission insists, we can dispose of the immunity issue 
without even reaching the question whether the state authorized the transaction and clearly articulated a policy to displace 
competition. The Supreme Court's decision in City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 
2d 382 (1991), forbids us to accept the Commission's argument. HN8[
] We may not ""look behind"" governmental actions for 
""'perceived conspiracies to restrain trade.'"" Id. at 379, 111 S. Ct. at 1353 (quoting Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. 558, 580, 104 S. 
Ct. 1989, 2001, 80 L. Ed. 2d 590 (1984)). We may not ""deconstruct[] . . . the governmental process"" or ""prob[e] . . . the official 
'intent'"" to determine whether the government's decision-making process has been usurped by private parties. Id. at 377, 111 S. 
Ct. at 1352. We therefore must reject the Commission's argument that because the plan at issue was formulated by PPHS and 
HCA, Inc. and presented by PPHS to the Authority, the plan's execution would constitute  [**16] only private action. "
291,13," The Commission's argument that no such policy has been articulated also emphasizes that the Authority's acquisition of 
Palmyra was engineered by PPHS, with the Authority approving the transaction after little or no deliberation, and that it leaves 
PPHS in control of Palmyra. We reject the suggestion that such private influence, or such private benefit, somehow makes the 
transaction and its anticompetitive effects unforeseeable. This argument is no more than another manifestation of the 
Commission's insistence that we disregard City of Columbia's injunction against ""deconstruction of the governmental process 
and probing of the official 'intent.'"" 499 U.S. at 377, 111 S. Ct. at 1352. See supra note 12. "

unfair development conditions [on] the Steel Point project."" "
315,," ""53. From May of 1999 through January of 2000, while the plaintiff was attempting in good faith to complete the transaction, 
[certain of the defendants] were engaged in a conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce to deprive the plaintiff of its rights."" ""56. Unaware  [***23] of the fact that the mayor [Ganim] . . . had entered into a corrupt agreement to block and [to] interfere with

317,12," This does not mean that there can be no remedy for the plaintiff's injuries. Indeed, the plaintiff brought a separate action

See Bridgeport Harbour Place I, LLC v. Ganim, 131 Conn. App. 99, 104, 30 A.3d 703 (2011). The jury rendered a verdict in favor

plaintiff punitive damages, attorney's fees and costs in accordance with the jury's findings on the CUTPA claim. Id., 113. The 
Appellate Court recently affirmed the judgment in that case. Id., 178. Federal authorities also successfully prosecuted several of

HN6[
] In a tying case, the plaintiff must allege the defendant company used market power in the tying product to gain 
 [***10] market power in the tied product. See Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 464 & n.9. Here, however, the Commission indicated 
in its Resolution it is investigating only the acquisition or maintenance of a monopoly in the condom market; that is the only 
product market in which the FTC has alleged Church & Dwight has market power, and the Commission has not identified any 
potentially tied product. "
325,*," The Commission also suggested at oral argument that the Company is required to produce information on products other than 
condoms even if that information is not directly relevant to its investigation because the Commission requested unredacted 
versions of documents containing at least some relevant information. We need not, however, reach the question whether the 
Commission's anti-redaction policy is permissible because we conclude the subpoena and CID at issue here are directed 
entirely toward information reasonably relevant to the Commission's investigation. "
330,1," In the appellate briefs, the parties treat these three companies as a single entity; thus, for simplicity, the appellants are

above the water line."" "
331,3," MYD  [**7] also sued for violations of California and Maryland antitrust laws. Because those laws are, in relevant part, 
substantially similar to the Florida antitrust law and to the equivalent § 1 of the federal Sherman Act the analysis in terms of 
stating a cause of action in a Florida civil court, is the same under any of the three states' laws. See 15 U.S.C. § 1 HN4[
] (""Every contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce . . . is declared to be illegal.""); § 542.18, Fla.

Prof'l. Code §§ 16720, 16726 (West 2009); Md. Code Ann., Com. Law § 11-204(a) (West 2009) (""A person may not . . . [b]y 
contract, combination, or conspiracy with one or more other persons, unreasonably restrain trade or commerce . . . .""). "
332,4," In Twombly, the United States Supreme Court addressed the question of what ""a plaintiff must plead in order to state a claim 
under § 1 of the Sherman Act."" 550 U.S. at 554-55. The Court concluded that HN8[
] to state such a claim, the ""[f]actual 
allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the 
complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)."" Id. at 555 (citations and footnote omitted). The Court further explained that the 
complaint must contain ""enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made"" and ""allegations 
plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with) agreement."" Id. at 556-57. The Court then looked to case law and commentary 
involving other stages  [**10] of antitrust trials (such as summary judgments and directed verdicts) to determine if the alleged 
conduct in that case (parallel conduct by competing companies) was sufficient. While we are not bound by the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we have 
been instructed by our legislature to give ""due consideration and great weight . . . to the interpretations of the federal courts"" in 
interpreting Florida's antitrust statutes. See § 542.32, Fla. Stat. Furthermore, we note that we have looked to federal cases in the 
past to guide us in analyzing the sufficiency of Florida antitrust complaints. See, e.g., Okeelanta Power Ltd. P'ship v. Fla. Power 
& Light Co., 766 So. 2d 264, 267 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000). As such, we believe that Florida courts should look to Twombly in 
determining whether an agreement in violation of the Florida Antitrust law can be reasonably inferred from the alleged facts. "
333,5," In Parts Depot, we explained the distinction between vertical and horizontal restraints: HN10[
] ""Vertical"" restraints upon competition are those imposed by persons or firms on a different level of the distribution 
system than the level of the persons or firms receiving the impact of the restraints, e.g., resale price fixing may involve a 
manufacturer dictating the price at which a dealer sells a product. On the other hand, ""horizontal"" restraints are those imposed within the same distribution level, e.g., by some dealers 
refusing to sell to other dealers. Horizontal restraints also encompass the situation where dealers conspire to induce the 
manufacturer to refuse to deal with a particular dealer."

372,1," Defendants filed their Notice of Removal on the docket of the U.S. District Court of Kansas, Civil Action No. 11-2063 at Docket 
No. 1. On that docket, Plaintiffs filed their Motion to Remand at Docket No. 21, and Defendants responded in opposition. 
Defendants jointly filed a response at Docket No. 68 (hereinafter, ""Defs.' Resp.""), and Defendant Sparboe Farms, Inc. responded 
separately at Docket No. 66 (hereinafter, ""Sparboe Resp.""). Plaintiffs filed their  [**5] reply at Docket No. 75 (hereinafter, ""Pls.' 
Reply""). "
373,," Upon the transfer of the case to this district, this Court granted leave for the parties to file supplemental briefing as to Third 
Circuit law; those supplemental briefs are filed on this Court's docket, Action No. 08-md-2002 at Docket Nos. 529 and 530 
(hereinafter, respectively, ""Pls.' Suppl."" and ""Defs.' Suppl.""). All Defendants joined the Defendants' supplemental memorandum. 
See Defs.' Suppl. at 9 n.5. Plaintiffs also filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority with this Court at Docket No. 540. "
374,2," Additionally, a ""state claim may be removed to federal court... when Congress expressly so provides, such as in the Price-
Anderson Act...."" Beneficial Nat. Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 8, 123 S. Ct. 2058, 156 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2003). That Act ""contains an 
unusual pre-emption provision, 42 U.S.C. § 2014(hh), that not only gives federal courts jurisdiction over tort actions arising out of 
nuclear accidents but also expressly provides for removal of such actions brought in state court even when they assert only 
state-law claims."" Id. at 6 (citation omitted). Another such example is the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, the removal provision for which, 15 U.S.C. § 
78bb(f)(2), is ""jurisdictional"" and ""creates an express exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule, conferring federal removal 
jurisdiction over a unique class of state law claims."" Rowinski v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc., 398 F.3d 294, 297-298 (3d Cir. 
2005) (footnote and citation omitted)."
374,3," As the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized, generally, ""there is a very limited area in which a federal court in a case 
removed from a state court is authorized to recharacterize what purports to be a state law claim as a claim arising under a 
federal statute."" R.R. Labor Execs. Ass'n v. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie R.R. Co., 858 F.2d 936, 942 (3d Cir. 1988). "
375,4," One federal district court also observed recently that: In discussing the Kansas restraint of trade act, Kansas Supreme Court noted that no hard and fast rule could be laid down, 
but that the question is never whether there is a restraint of trade, but whether the restraint is reasonable  [**13] and 
whether or not the restraint contravenes the public welfare. Because the restraint of trade act concerns itself with the public 
welfare, it was designed to protect the competitive process, not competitors. Ablulimir v. U-Haul Co. of Kansas, Inc., No. 11-4014-EFM, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75191, 2011 WL 2731774, at *6 (D. Kan. June 
13, 2011)."
375,5," Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute that their Complaint is premised upon factual allegations that form the cause of actions at 
issue in the multidistrict litigation."
375,6," There is some authority that may further diminish the Defendants' interstate commerce argument in one respect. See In re 
Wyoming Tight Sands Antitrust Cases, No. 85-2349, 1990 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12165, 1990 WL 136788, at *4 (D. Kan. Aug. 2, 
1990) (rejecting an argument that ""Kansas antitrust laws regulate activities solely in intrastate and opposed to interstate 
commerce"" because ""K.S.A. 50-112 clearly makes unlawful 'all arrangements ... which tend to prevent full and free competition 
in the importation, transportation or sale of articles imported into this state"" and by ""its clear language, the statute clearly 
contemplates enforcement in the interstate context,"" and because the cases raised by the movant ""demonstrate that when a 
challenged course of conduct has implicated both inter-and intrastate commerce, the courts have applied Kansas antitrust 
statutes""). "
376,7," In exercising their ""plaintiff's choice"" by only pursuing a KRTA claim in their Complaint, Plaintiffs may have accounted for the 
advantages and disadvantages of pursuing remedies under the KRTA in lieu of the Sherman Act. See, e.g., Kenton C. Granger, 
A Glimpse at a Plaintiff's Remedies Under Kansas'  [**17] Antitrust Laws, 8 Washburn L.J. 1, 10-13 (describing some of the 
possible advantages of bringing a KRTA suit as compared to a federal antitrust suit, and vice versa)."
376,8," In the pending multidistrict litigation, Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement with Sparboe, as well as a 
settlement agreement with another group of Defendants. Plaintiffs have represented to the Court that ""Plaintiffs opted-out of 
th[ose] direct purchaser settlements on or before November 16, 2010, and filed their lawsuit in Kansas state court."" Pls.' Mot. at 
4, ¶ 12, see also id. at 3-4, ¶¶ 9-11."
376,9," The Court does not address in this decision whether the Capper-Volstead Act or the other statutes create a recognized defense 
to the KRTA. However, the Court observes that Defendants, in recounting the development of the Capper-Volstead Act in light of 
the history of ""prosecutions of [agricultural] cooperatives under state antitrust laws,"" quote the Supreme Court for the contention 
that ""[s]ome state courts had sustained antitrust charges against agricultural cooperatives, and as a result eventually all the 
States passed Acts  [**20] authorizing their existence."" Defs.' Resp. at 14-15 (emphasis added) (quoting Md. & Va. Milk 
Producers Ass'n v. United States, 362 U.S. 458, 464, 80 S. Ct. 847, 4 L. Ed. 2d 880 (1960)). Seemingly, the Cooperative 
Marketing Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 17-1601 to 17-1636, which provides, ""[n]o association, contract, method or act which [under 
Kansas law qualifies as, or is conduct attributed to, an agricultural cooperative association] shall be deemed a conspiracy or 
combination in restraint of trade or as creating an illegal monopoly,"" id. § 17-1634, may qualify as one such state statute. See 
Kan. Wheat Growers' Ass'n v. Charlet, 118 Kan. 765, 236 P. 657, 658 (Kan. 1925) (commenting that the Kansas Supreme Court 
had ""held the statute [the Cooperative Marketing Act] to be valid, and held the [defendant] association is not an unreasonable 
combination in restraint of trade, or an organization for fostering unlawful monopoly""). It follows that the Cooperative Marketing 
Act might provide an alternative explanation for why Plaintiffs alleged facts that could be construed as anticipating an 
""agricultural cooperative""-type defense. See, e.g., Compl. ¶ 106 (""These activities fall outside the legitimate objectives of any 
agricultural cooperative."");  [**21] id. ¶ 108 (""UEP members are large corporate competitors rather than small farmers banding 
together to cut out the corporate middlemen who would otherwise market their eggs. UEP members do not associate to 
collectively process, handle and market their products, and UEP does not provide those services. UEP does not wash, candle, 
grade, break, pasteurize, package, store, transport, or distribute its members' eggs. UEP does not negotiate contracts for sale 
for its members.""). "
377,10," Contrary to the Defendants' contention otherwise, they have not demonstrated that the Plaintiffs' KRTA claim is like the state 
law quiet title claim in Grable & Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Manufacturing, 545 U.S. 308, 125 S. Ct. 2363, 
162 L. Ed. 2d 257. In Grable, the Supreme Court upheld the removal of a state quiet title claim because it was premised on the 
grounds that a sale of real property was invalid because the service of an IRS seizure notice was inadequate under a federal 
statute. Id. at 310-11. The issue involving notice under the federal statute was thus ""an essential element of [the] quiet title 
claim."" Id. at 315. Here, the purported federal issue of an agricultural cooperative's immunity might arise as an affirmative 
 [**22] defense to the Plaintiff's KRTA claim, but not as an element of the cause of action."
377,11," ""Very few statutes have a complete preemption effect."" Wright & Miller, supra § 3566. Examples of statutes that have been 
found to completely preempt state law include the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, and the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974. See El Paso Natural Gas Co. v. Neztsosie, 526 U.S. 473, 484 n.6, 119 S. Ct. 1430, 143 L. Ed. 2d 
635 (1999)."
377,12," In this way, complete preemption could be understood to serve as the recalibration of a non-existent state claim into the 
federal claim that it actually is: ""An effort to invoke nonexistent state law is no different from a spelling error. A complaint reciting 
that a firm with a large share of the market for some product is violating 'the anti-rust laws' could not be dismissed on the 
observation that there is no federal prohibition of iron oxide. A court would treat the document as one under anti-trust law from 
the outset."" Bartholet v. Reishauer A.G., 953 F.2d 1073, 1075 (7th Cir. 1992). "
379,13," Although the Defendants occasionally invoke the Sherman Act in their arguments as to complete preemption, they are explicit 
in stating that they ""do not contend that federal antitrust law preempts all state antitrust law."" Defs.' Resp. at 19."
379,14," Some examples of the Defendants' legal authority from case law and commentators includes: Christine Varney, The Capper-
Volstead Act, Agricultural Cooperatives, and Antitrust Immunity, The Antitrust Source, at 1 (Dec. 2010) (quoted by Defendants 
for the contention that the ""Capper-Volstead Act represented the culmination of a long struggle by farmers to guarantee their 
right to organize cooperatives"" and that the ""passage of the Sherman Act and many state antitrust laws"" led to ""widespread 
concern ... that these laws would be used against agricultural cooperatives""), and Bell v. Fur Breeders Agricultural Cooperative, 
348 F. 3d 1224, 1232-33 (10th Cir. 2003) (cited by Defendants for the proposition that federal courts ""have determined that 
agricultural cooperatives, like corporations, do not have the plurality of actors necessary for a Section 1 conspiracy"")."
379,15," This conflation is not unique to Defendants. See, e.g., Sullivan v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 424 F.3d 267, 273 n.7 (2d Cir. 2005) 
(""Some commentators seem to equate the defense of field preemption, which defeats a plaintiff's state-law claim because 
federal law 'occupies the field' within which the state-law claim falls, with the doctrine of complete preemption, which creates 
federal subject-matter jurisdiction over preempted state-law claims .... But no Supreme Court case has ever held the two forms 
of preemption to be equivalent.  [**32] It is true that the defense of field preemption and the doctrine of complete preemption 
both rest on the breadth, in some crude sense, of a federal statute's preemptive force. The two types of preemption are, 
however, better considered distinct."" (citations omitted))."
379,16," Although remand is appropriate at this time, the Court recognizes that this case might join the pending multidistrict litigation at 
another time. Such an occasion might develop, for instance, pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (""CAFA""). By way of 
example, this Court's jurisdiction might arise under CAFA given the potential interplay between the possible (albeit, rather novel) 
formation of a class of defendants, see, e.g., Kan. Stat. Ann. § 60-223; S. Ute Indian Tribe v. Amoco Prod. Co., 2 F.3d 1023, 
1030 (10th Cir. 1993) (describing a district court's certification of a defendant class upon a defendant's motion); CAFA's broad 
jurisdictional grant for state class actions, including those with a proposed class, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d); and the federal removal 
statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1446(b) (""If the case stated by the initial pleading is not removable, a notice of removal may be filed within 
thirty days after receipt by  [**33] the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of an amended pleading, motion, order 
or other paper from which it may first be ascertained that the case is one which is or has become removable, except that a case 
may not be removed on the basis of jurisdiction conferred by section 1332 of this title more than 1 year after commencement of 
the action.""). "
394,*," Honorable Donetta W. Ambrose, United States District Court Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania, sitting by 
designation."
394,1," The Settlement involved five individual class actions pending in federal court and two other class suits pending in state court. 
The individual federal suits presently before us are: Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., Index No. 04-cv-02819 (D.N.J.); Null v. DB 
Investments, Inc., Madison Co. No. 05-L-209 (Madison County, Ill. Cir. Ct., removed to S.D. Ill.); Leider v. Ralfe, No. 01-CV-3137 
(S.D.N.Y.); Anco Industrial Diamond Corp. v. DB Investments, Inc., No. 01-cv-04463 (D.N.J.); and British Diamond Import Co. v. 
Central Holdings Ltd., No. 04-cv-04098 (D.N.J.). The two other class actions pending in state court pertinent to the Settlement 
and this set of appeals are: Hopkins v. De Beers Centenary A.G., San Francisco County No. CGC-04-432954 (Cal. Super. Ct.), 
and Cornwell v. DB Investments, Inc., Maricopa Co.  [**6] No. CV2005-2968 (Ariz. Super. Ct.)."
394,2," Because the Panel found the certification of the class to be flawed, it did not reach the Rule 23 fairness objections to the 
settlement, distribution plan, and fee award, or the District Court's resolution of these objections. See Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 142 
n.6. Because we now conclude that the District Court's certification of the proposed settlement was appropriate, we will also 
address these issues. "
395,3," The vacated Panel Opinion describes the history, progression to power, and eventual market dominance of De Beers and its 
related entities in greater detail. See Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 138-39. For the sake of brevity, we provide a summary."
395,4," Sightholders are selected by De Beers's subsidiary Diamond Trading Company (""DTC"") based upon specific criteria, ""including 
their financial standing and reliability, their market position, their distribution ability, their marketing ability, and their compliance 
with Diamond Trading Company Diamond Best Practice Principles."" (App'x 1438.) In 2006, DTC had ninety-three sightholders, 
nine of which had head offices in the United States and seventy-six of which had sales offices in the country. (Id.) Sightholders 
sell both rough and polished diamonds, as well as diamond jewelry. (Id.) By way of example, the retailer Tiffany & Co. is a 
majority-owner of the South African sightholder Rand Precision Cut Diamonds, which sells polished diamonds and manufactures 
jewelry for sale in Tiffany stores. (Id. 1438-39.)"
395,5," The process by which De Beers sold its rough diamonds entailed a ""diamond  [**9] pipeline,"" which began with the sale of 
rough diamonds and ended with the purchase of retail diamond jewelry by consumers. The participants in the diamond pipeline 
included rough stone wholesalers, cutters and polishers of rough diamonds, finished stone wholesalers, diamond jewelry 
manufacturers and wholesalers, and retailers."
395,6," The theories of recovery in the individual cases are as follows: Anco Industrial was filed on behalf of all direct purchasers of 
rough diamonds pursuant to Clayton Act §§ 4 and 16, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15 and 26, to prevent and restrain violations of §§ 1 and 2 of 
the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-2. British Diamond was filed on behalf of direct purchasers of polished diamonds pursuant to 
Clayton Act §§ 4 and 16, 15 U.S.C. §§ 15 and 26, to prevent and restrain violations of §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. 
§§ 1-2. Cornwell was filed on behalf of all purchasers of diamonds in Arizona pursuant to Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 44-1402 for 
monopolization of the market for diamonds, and under § 44-1403 for establishment, maintenance or use of monopoly. Hopkins 
was filed on behalf of California residents who purchased diamonds in California  [**11] pursuant to Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 
16720, et seq., alleging engagement in a continuing unlawful restraint of trade; pursuant to § 17200, et seq., for violation of the 
unfair competition law; and under California common law for monopolization and attempted monopolization. Leider was filed on 
behalf of consumers who purchased diamonds or diamond jewelry pursuant to the Wilson Tariff Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 8-11; under § 
16 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 26, for injunctive relief in connection with §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, and for damages for 
violations of § 2 of the Sherman Act; pursuant to federal and New York state common law for damages and injunctive relief; "
396,," under N.Y. Gen. Bus. §§ 349-350; and under New York's Donnelly Act and the antitrust laws of fifteen other states and the 
District of Columbia. Null was filed on behalf of all purchasers of De Beers diamonds pursuant to 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 505/1, et 
seq., and § 510/2, alleging unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and, in the alternative, 
pursuant to the consumer fraud and deceptive practice laws of the various states where purchases of diamonds were made. 
Sullivan was filed on behalf  [**12] of a class of all persons and businesses in the United States who purchased polished 
diamonds indirectly from De Beers pursuant to §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act for injunctive relief, and pursuant to state antitrust 
and deceptive practices acts for monetary relief."
396,7," The Leider plaintiffs subsequently reached agreement with the parties to the Indirect Purchaser Settlement to resolve that 
matter in accordance with the terms of the Settlement. "
397,8," The Indirect Purchaser Consumer Subclass is estimated to contain between 67 and 117 million  [**19] members, while the 
Indirect Purchaser Reseller Subclass contains an estimated 38,152 members. The Direct Purchaser Class is estimated to 
contain approximately 130 members. (App'x 275 n.1.) "
398,9," The Special Master advised that distribution  [**20] of the Direct Purchaser Settlement Fund be conducted on a pro rata basis 
and that each Direct Class member receive the Net Settlement amount multiplied by the quotient of the Adjusted Purchases of 
the claimant divided by the aggregate Adjusted Purchases of all approved direct purchaser claims. The Adjusted Purchases of a 
claimant would be calculated by multiplying the amount paid for Rough Diamonds by 1.22 (the average Rough to Polished 
Matrix factor), and adding the total amount paid for Polished Diamonds. (App'x 1533-34.)"
398,10," The Special Master recommended that the Indirect Purchaser Consumer Subclass receive a pro rata share of the Indirect 
Purchaser Settlement Fund, calculated by multiplying the Net Consumer settlement fund amount by the quotient of a consumer's 
total recognized diamond claim divided by the total recognized diamond claims of all consumers. (App'x 1547.) In contrast, a 
Reseller Subclass member's claim would be calculated in a three step process: (1) all of the claimant's diamond purchases are 
converted to the common metric of polished wholesale value and adjusted to reflect the number of years each Reseller operated 
during the class period; (2) claims are weighted  [**21] by applying the absorption weighting factor derived from a fixed effects 
regression analysis for each type of diamond purchase; and (3) the claimant's pro rata share of the Reseller Subclass settlement 
fund is the ratio of the claimant's ""absorption adjusted purchases"" to the sum of all claimants' ""absorption adjusted purchases."" 
(Id. 1575.)"
398,11," The Special Master's report noted that Indirect Purchaser Consumer claims aggregating less than $165 for mixed stone 
jewelry or products, and less than $95 for diamond only jewelry or products, would be considered de minimis. (App'x 1547-48.)"
398,12," Additionally, the Special Master recommended a four-part notification program — entailing direct notice, publication notice, 
""earned media outreach"" in the form of press releases and news reporting, and electronic notice — finding that it provided notice 
""in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposed settlement."" (App'x 1518-27 (quoting Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 23(e)).) The District Court adopted this recommendation and method of notification in its October 1, 2007 Order."
398,13," The District Court rejected the Special Master's recommendation of adding a percentage of the interest earned on the total 
settlement fund to the total attorneys' fees."
398,14," Four objectors were members of the Indirect Purchaser Reseller Subclass and thirty-three objectors belonged to the Indirect 
Purchaser Consumer Subclass. (App'x 272.) "
399,15," A related objection was filed on grounds that the equal allocation of the Indirect Purchaser Settlement Fund without 
consideration of a claimant's state of controlling law was improper since some states purportedly prohibited recovery by indirect 
purchasers. These objectors asserted that class members from states permitting indirect purchaser recovery should be entitled 
to greater monetary compensation. "
400,16," As the Panel Opinion noted, the parties did not explain, nor did the record reveal, any reason for the disparity in the time 
periods covered by the Settlement between the Indirect and Direct Purchaser classes. See Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 143 n.8. We do 
not consider this difference pertinent to the appeals. "
401,17," Based on its assessment, the Panel found that at least twenty-five states and the District of Columbia possess Illinois Brick 
repealer statutes or have judicially extended antitrust standing to indirect purchasers. "
402,18," As mentioned above, because the Panel concluded that certification was inappropriate, it did not reach the Special Master's 
recommendations or the objections to the distribution plan and fee award. Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 142 n.6. In light of our finding 
that class certification is appropriate, we assess these objections for the first time. "
403,19," The objectors also challenge the District Court's purported failure to identify the state law claims that should receive class 
treatment under the existing certification order, as we discuss below. "
404,20," As mentioned, certain states have enacted statutes known as ""Illinois Brick repealers,"" which extend antitrust standing to 
indirect purchasers and consumers. See supra n. 17. "
405,21," Contrary to the objectors' and the Panel's view that Warfarin's analysis is inapplicable because the plaintiffs in that case 
purportedly shared a common claim under the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act, our holding in Warfarin did not address the 
Delaware statute in analyzing predominance. 391 F.3d at 528-29. Indeed, Warfarin did not consider whether every class 
member even possessed a claim under Delaware law, nor did it undertake a choice-of-law  [**47] analysis to determine whether 
all members in the nationwide class could assert a claim under the Delaware statute. Rather, we simply concluded that any 
claims arising under the varying state laws and the Delaware statute could be proved with common evidence, thereby supporting 
a finding of predominance. Id."
405,22," A comparable approach is evidenced in our decision in Prudential, where we affirmed the district court's finding of 
predominance based upon the central issue in the case — a common nationwide scheme of deceptive conduct by the defendant 
to defraud millions of customers. 148 F.3d at 315. Similarly, in Linerboard, we noted that the ""critical inquiry will be whether 
defendants successfully concealed the existence of the alleged conspiracy,"" and ""the fact of concealment [ ] is the polestar in an 
analysis of fraudulent concealment."" 305 F.3d at 163 (emphasis in original). Because it was the defendant's conduct that 
demanded attention, we found that ""allegations of proof are all common to the defendants, not the plaintiffs."" Id. "
406,23," No one seriously disputes that De Beers's alleged conduct, if true, was anticompetitive and violated  [**51] state antitrust laws. 
Our disagreement with the dissent arises solely out of the question whether certain class members' potential inability to satisfy 
some states' statutory standing requirements should have precluded the District Court from certifying the settlement class in this 
case."
406,24," As we noted in Insurance Brokerage, we do not presume here ""that common issues necessarily predominate in every antitrust 
case."" 579 F.3d at 267 n.26 (citing Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 321-22). Here, we merely conclude that the District Court 
was free to determine that common issues of law or fact stemming from De Beers's conduct in this instance satisfied the 
predominance requirement. "
407,25," Other courts have similarly declined to examine the controlling substantive law pertinent to asserted claims at the class 
certification stage. See, e.g., Schumacher v. Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc., 2004 DSD 5, 221 F.R.D. 605, 612 (D.S.D. 2004) (""Where 
federal claims and common law claims are predicated on  [**55] the same factual allegations and proof will be essentially the 
same, 'even if the law of different states might ultimately govern the common law claims — an issue that need not and is not 
decided at this juncture — certification of the class for the whole action is appropriate.'"") (quoting Walsh v. Chittenden Corp., 798 
F. Supp. 1043, 1055 (D. Vt. 1992)) (alteration omitted). "
408,26," We do not reach this conclusion so as to allow district courts to ""shirk"" the requirements of Rule 23 when certifying the class, 
as the dissent suggests. (Dissenting Op. at 21 n.13.) We do not ignore the differences in state law, but rather find, based on our 
precedent, that those differences do not defeat predominance."
408,27," In conducting the analysis in Warfarin, we expressly distinguished the Seventh Circuit's decision in In re Bridgestone/Firestone 
Inc., 288 F.3d 1012 (7th Cir. 2002), in which certification of a nationwide class arising under the tort laws of all fifty states was 
sought for purposes of litigation, rather than settlement. 391 F.3d at 529. "
409,28," We are aware that there may still be circumstances, as we and other Courts of Appeals have noted, where ""'[i]n a multi-state 
class action, variations in state law may swamp any common issues and defeat predominance.'"" Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 
1241, 1261 (11th Cir. 2004) (quoting Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 741 (5th Cir. 1996)). But these decisions are 
inapplicable here, as the certification  [**63] orders at issue pertained to litigation classes and were preoccupied with the 
attendant manageability aspects of certification. More explicitly, the courts expressed unease that if ""more than a few of the laws 
of the fifty states differ, the district judge would face an impossible task of instructing a jury on the relevant law,"" and noted ""the 
difficulties in trying the [ ] claims on a class basis."" Id. (citation & quotations omitted). Unlike those situations ""where the 
certification inquiry [is] set against the backdrop of an impending trial,"" Ins. Broker., 579 F.3d at 269, the settlement context here 
does not present equivalent concerns."
409,29," Unsurprisingly, we are not alone in recognizing the ""key"" distinction between certification for settlement purposes versus 
litigation, and ""courts are more inclined to find the predominance test met [in the settlement context], even when there are 
differences in applicable state laws."" Ersler v. Toshiba Am., Inc., No. CV-07-2304, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14374, 2009 WL 
454354, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2009) (citing In re Grand Theft Auto Video Game Consumer Litig., 251 F.R.D. 139, 158 
(S.D.N.Y. 2008)); see, e.g., In re Mexico Money Transfer Litig., 267 F.3d 743, 746-47 (7th Cir. 2001)  [**64] (noting that while 
certification of litigation classes arising under varying consumer fraud statutes is often inappropriate, the same is not true for 
settlement classes where ""no one need draw fine lines among state-law theories of relief""); In re Inter-Op Hip Prosthesis Liability 
Litig., 204 F.R.D 330, 347 (N.D. Ohio 2001) (""[W]hen taking the proposed settlement [ ] into consideration for purposes of 
determining class certification, individual issues which are normally present in . . . litigation become irrelevant, allowing the 
common issues to predominate."") (citation & quotations omitted)."
409,30," Although we will not here speculate as to the type of ""situations where variations in state laws are so significant so as to defeat 
commonality and predominance even in a settlement class certification,"" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 530, we are confident that the 
several common questions of law or fact arising from a ""single central issue"" — namely, De Beers's alleged anticompetitive 
conduct and the resulting injury caused to each class member — predominate over any issues concerning individual class 
members, Prudential, 148 F.3d at 314 (citation & quotations omitted)."
409,31," As noted, the Panel conducted an extensive review of relevant state statutes and reached the conclusion that ""indirect 
purchasers do not have a right to recover in all states, and, therefore, no question of law or fact regarding their legal rights is 
uniform throughout the class."" Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 149. "
410,32," The Panel echoed the objectors' position, concluding after examining the laws of fifty states that many jurisdictions 
""categorically foreclosed"" a legal right to recover on the merits to indirect purchasers. Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 151 n.14."
410,33," The  [**70] marginal role played by the question of ""validity"" of claims in class settlement certification situations is further 
evidenced by considering our subsequent Prudential decision. See In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practice Litig., 261 
F.3d 355, 366 (3d Cir. 2001) (""Prudential II""). There, we released all state-law claims — including unnamed claims — ""arising 
from the same nucleus of operative facts as the claims"" actually considered by the Court without adjudicating the validity of "
411,," those other allegations. Id. We observed that ""a judgment pursuant to a class settlement can bar later claims based on the 
allegations underlying the claims in the settled class action"" even where the ""precluded claim was not presented, and could not 
have been presented, in the class action itself."" Id. (citations omitted). We reasoned that while our ""power to release those 
claims as part of a judgment"" may ""seem anomalous,"" ""we have endorsed the rule because it 'serves the important policy 
interest of judicial economy by permitting parties to enter into comprehensive settlements that 'prevent relitigation of settled 
questions at the core of a class action.'"" Id. (quoting TBK Partners, Ltd. v. Western Union Corp., 675 F.2d 456, 460 (2d Cir. 
1982)).  [**71] As such, the unidentified prospective claims could be included in the settlement without adjudication of their 
validity since they arose from the identical fraudulent scheme perpetrated by the defendant."
411,34," The objectors' associated argument that the predominance inquiry presupposes that every putative class members possesses 
at least a single valid cause of action  [**72] likewise misses the point. While Rule 23 may presuppose that every class member 
does actually allege a predominantly common claim against a defendant, Rule 23 does not mandate that each of these claims 
must be shown capable of prevailing on the merits at the certification stage."
411,35," To further clarify, we use the term ""statutory standing"" to refer to the possession of a viable claim or right to relief, not to a 
jurisdictional requirement. See generally Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 
210 (1998) (""It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not 
implicate subject-matter jurisdiction,"" and ""jurisdiction is not defeated by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a 
cause  [**74] of action"") (citations and alterations omitted). "
412,36," The Panel analyzed the antitrust claims separately from the consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims, seemingly 
concluding that plaintiffs could only prevail if each putative class member alleged either a ""uniform"" antitrust cause of action, a 
""uniform"" consumer protection cause of action, or a ""uniform"" unjust enrichment claim. Sullivan, 613 F.3d 146, 150. We will not 
read into Rule 23 this heightened threshold requirement that plaintiffs must allege an identical cause of action, when all that is 
required is that common issues of law or fact predominate over questions particular to individual class members."
412,37," The dissent describes this requirement in varied ways: under their view, class members who, ""according to the plain terms of 
controlling law have no claim at all"" (Dissenting Op. at 16 n. 11), have ""no legal claim"" (Id. at 1), have ""no cause of action,"" (Id. at 
4), have a claim ""clearly lacking a colorable basis"" (Id. at 15), or have a claim ""nonexistent as a matter of substantive law"" (Id. at 
13), are barred from partaking in this class action settlement. The problem with this requirement, however, is that in order to 
separate class members possessing an ""existent"" legal claim from those possessing a ""nonexistent"" one, district courts would 
have to perform a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry into each class member's claim."
412,38," At the same time,  [**78] it is by no means clear that the dissent's proposed analysis could be cabined to only consider the 
differing statutory standing requirements in the process of evaluating the validity of claims. As discussed supra, statutory 
standing for indirect purchasers is treated as but one element of a cause of action, rather than a jurisdictional requirement, as 
the dissent mistakenly suggests. If a district court were required to evaluate the statutory standing element to assess a claim's 
viability, logic and consistency suggest that the court should also consider other aspects of a claim for Rule 12(b)(6) and other 
deficiencies. This approach would delay proceedings in the trial court, as it would require the parties to engage in ill-timed, 
protracted merits litigation at the class certification stage. "
413,39," Application of the proposed inquiry to the instant matter demonstrates the likely obstacles the District Court would encounter 
under this approach. The objectors present Ohio's statutory regime as emblematic of the impropriety of the type of class 
settlement certification at issue here. Citing the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in Johnson v. Microsoft Corp., 106 Ohio St. 3d 
278, 2005 Ohio 4985, 834 N.E.2d 791 (Ohio 2005), they urge that Ohio law prohibits all indirect purchaser claims asserting 
violations of Ohio antitrust law, common law claims for unjust enrichment where a purchaser cannot establish that he conferred 
a benefit upon a defendant, and claims alleging violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act predicated upon 
monopolistic pricing practices. (Quinn Br. at 60-61.) As a result, they insist that, ""[d]irectly contrary to the district court's 
[certification], an Ohio class member does not have a valid claim under Ohio law."" (Id. at 61.) The objectors contend that a 
similar problem exists for other Illinois Brick states. This inference is flawed for several reasons. First, the objectors fail to engage in the type of choice-of-law  [**82] exercise 
necessitated by their proposed approach — the evaluation of whether an Ohio class member is asserting a claim pursuant to 
Ohio law or pursuant to the law of a repealer state or a state affording an alternative basis for recovery. Undoubtedly, this 
analysis would present significant hurdles and potentially alter the presumed outcome. Second, although Johnson provides that 
an indirect purchaser lacking an antitrust claim under Illinois Brick cannot circumvent this limitation by relying upon the Ohio 
consumer protection statute, the Ohio Supreme Court did not, nor could it, preclude consumer protection claims predicated on 
fraud or deception. As the plaintiffs point out, the claims settled here include allegations of fraud and deception separate from 
the antitrust allegations, suggesting that some avenue of recovery arising from the same defendant conduct remains available to 
indirect purchasers even in Ohio. (See Pls.' Br. in Response to Quinn's Response to Class Counsel's Mot. for Leave to File 
Record Excerpts 13-14.) Finally, if the court is to evaluate the viability of plaintiffs' statutory standing element under Ohio law at 
the class certification stage, the objectors presented  [**83] no sensible reason why the court should not likewise inspect the 
viability of every other aspect of an antitrust, consumer protection, or unjust enrichment claim, such as statutes of limitation, 
conditions precedent to suit, and the like. We do not doubt that such an exhaustive analysis would produce absurd results and 
cause undue delay in our trial courts. "
414,40," Of course, some global settlements may nevertheless be rejected for failing to meet the requirements of Rule 23. In Ortiz v. 
Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999), the Supreme Court rejected a global settlement in a 
mandatory class action based on a limited fund theory under Rule 23(b)(1)(B). There, the plaintiffs seeking class certification 
failed to demonstrate that the fund available to pay claims was limited beyond the fund amount agreed to by the parties. There, 
the requirements of Rule 23(b)(1)(B) were not met; here, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are met. "
415,41," The Panel agreed with this characterization, holding that ""the order contravenes the Rules Enabling Act"" because it ""extends 
antitrust remedies that, in many instances, have no root in state substantive law."" Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 149. The  [**90] Panel 
rejected the argument that De Beers's willingness to stipulate to liability obviated this concern, noting that a court was obligated 
even in the settlement context to ensure that all of Rule 23's requirements were met and could not ""effectively grant[ ] relief to 
individuals to whom De Beers had no antitrust liability."" Id. The dissent repeats this argument. "
416,42," The Panel agreed with this argument, noting that certain states' ""categorical refus[al] to allow indirect purchasers to bring a 
price-fixing claim"" was ""not trivial"" and represented ""fundamental policy differences among the several states."" Sullivan, 613 
F.3d at 152, 148. The Panel concluded that these state interests were in effect ""subordinated to De Beers's desire to resolve all 
indirect purchaser claims simultaneously"" and ""in a quest to clear the queue in court."" Id. at 152 (citation & quotations omitted)."
416,43," The dissent concludes that approving class certification here endorses the enlargement of substantive rights because had 
some class members brought these claims individually in state court, they would ""be immediately shown the exit."" (Dissenting 
Op. at 30.) This is incorrect, for the state court would not automatically dismiss them without a motion from De Beers. More 
significantly, nothing would prevent De Beers from settling those claims in lieu of moving to  [**93] dismiss them, and doing so in 
that scenario would not be an enlargement of substantive rights. In responding to this point, the dissent equates an objection to class certification with a motion to dismiss, but such treatment 
demonstrates the very flaw in its position. Class certification and motions to dismiss involve two distinct (and different) 
standards, and the former does not permit as extensive an inquiry into the merits as the latter does. (See Dissenting Op. at 30 
n.21.)"
416,44," The dissent decries this position, contending that including Indirect Purchasers in the class who could not, on an individual 
basis, state a claim for recovery impermissibly modifies the rights of those Indirect Purchasers who could recover individually. In 
so asserting, the dissent assumes that the size of the settlement fund would be the same if the Indirect Purchasers who cannot 
recover individually were excluded from the class. Surely this cannot be the case, for the settlement amount to which De Beers 
has agreed must be based in large part on the number of potential class members and on securing global peace. Had those 
Indirect Purchasers who could not recover individually been excluded, we seriously doubt  [**94] that the Indirect Purchaser 
settlement fund would still be $272.5 million."
416,45," Other Courts of Appeals have recognized a similar functional focus in the Supreme Court's decision. See, e.g., Freedom from 
Religion Found., Inc. v. Chao, 433 F.3d 989, 991 (7th Cir. 2006) (""An example of the prudential limitations on standing is the 
judge-made 'indirect purchaser' doctrine of antitrust law,"" which is premised on minimizing complicated litigation), rev'd on other 
grounds, Hein v. Freedom from Religion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 127 S. Ct. 2553, 168 L. Ed. 2d 424 (2007); County of 
Oakland v. City of Detroit, 866 F.2d 839, 852 (6th Cir. 1989) (""The question of whether a plaintiff has standing to sue under 
the antitrust laws depends largely on prudential considerations.""). "
417,46," States  [**96] on both sides of the indirect purchaser restriction have likewise appreciated the pragmatic origins of and 
purposes served by Illinois Brick. See, e.g., Lorix v. Crompton Corp., 736 N.W.2d 619, 624 (Minn. 2007) (noting that antitrust 
standing ""has prudential limits based on remoteness of injury and complexity of proof); Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 646 N.W.2d 
440, 449 (Iowa 2002) (""[T]he Illinois Brick court was wholly concerned with the complexity of litigation and the possibility of 
multiple liability.""); Abbott Labs, Inc. v. Segura, 907 S.W.2d 503, 506-07 (Tex. 1995) (discussing the prudential policy concerns 
underlying Illinois Brick). "
418,47," We find additional support for our conclusion from the First Circuit's recent ruling in In re Pharmaceutical Industry Average 
Wholesale Price Litigation, 588 F.3d 24 (1st Cir. 2009).  [**101] There, the Court remarked that ""Rule 23(c)(1)(B) was added . . . 
to help appellate courts reviewing an order better understand the district court's decision,"" and to allow ""appellate courts, 
attorneys, and parties [to] proceed with more information and mutual understanding."" Id. at 40 (citing Wachtel, 453 F.3d at 186-
87). As a result, the Court upheld a district court's certification order that ""plainly defined the class and the class claims, issues, 
and defenses in sufficient detail,"" ""devoted many pages to the class's factual allegations against the defendant,"" ""carefully 
analyzed the proposed class's suitability for certification, again explaining the issues common to the class,"" and also ""discussed 
the state consumer protection statutes underlying the class's claims, noting differences among them."" Id. Likewise here, the 
District Court clearly defined the class, listed six common claims and issues, devoted significant discussion to the factual 
allegations, analyzed the class's suitability for certification by explaining the predominantly common issues, and noted the 
differences among the various statutes implicated in the claims. As succinctly stated by our fellow Court of Appeals, 
 [**102] ""[t]hat is enough."" Id. at 41."
418,48," 15 U.S.C. § 26 reads in pertinent part: HN20[
] Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of 
the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust law . 
. . when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or 
damage is granted by courts of equity."
418,49," After evaluating the mentioned expert reports, the Panel agreed with the objectors that plaintiffs no longer faced ""a significant 
threat of future antitrust harm in the absence of the injunction,"" and, therefore, lacked antitrust standing under § 16 of the 
Clayton Act. Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 157-58. "
419,50," Section 16 provides in pertinent part: HN22[
] Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of 
the United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, 
. . . when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss 
or damage is granted by courts of equity."
419,15, U.S.C. § 26.
419,51," Unsurprisingly, a paucity of case law addresses the issue of whether parties to a lawsuit may consent to the issuance of an 
injunction that is agreeable to all parties without a court's asking whether the prerequisites of Rule 23(b)(2) have been satisfied. 
This dearth of precedent is to be expected since it would be highly illogical for a defendant to dispute an injunction to which it in 
fact agreed, and for a plaintiff beneficiary to object to an injunction entered for its benefit. Curiously, the latter situation is 
presented here."
419,52," ""This rule applies when the putative class seeks injunctive or declaratory relief, and 'does not extend to cases in which 
 [**108] the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to money damages,'"" as with a certification pursuant to "
420,," Rule 23(b)(3). Beck v. Maximus, Inc., 457 F.3d 291, 301 (3d Cir. 2006) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) advisory committee's 
note)."
420,53," The objectors urge, based on the damages methodology expert reports, that De Beers's market share fell to approximately 
46% in 2006, and, therefore, posed little continuing threat of future antitrust harm. (Quinn Br. 19.) Although the experts 
mentioned that De Beers lost its dominant  [**110] share of an increasingly competitive market, the experts never opined — as 
the objectors contend — that plaintiffs face no significant threat of future antitrust harm. Were we to conduct our own 
independent analysis, we might draw a very different conclusion as to De Beers's asserted ability to inflict future harm: we might 
decide that De Beers's ongoing leadership position — considering its purported 46% market share in the diamond market — 
afforded it ample opportunity to influence diamond prices, posing an ongoing and significant threat of antitrust injury. See 
generally United States v. Continental Can Co., 378 U.S. 441, 459, 84 S. Ct. 1738, 12 L. Ed. 2d 953 (1964) (discussing 
defendant's ""dominant position"" based upon a 43%-46% market share in a highly concentrated industry). The objectors place far 
too much stock in De Beers's purported market share, ignoring one of the basic tenets in assessing market power: ""Obviously no 
magic inheres in numbers; the relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor is 
placed."" Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 612, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953). Curiously, the objectors and the Panel also rejected the plaintiffs' contention that the  [**111] injunction entered by the District 
Court in 2006 — an injunction directly tailored to fostering competition — played any role in the increasingly competitive market. 
Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 157. The Panel opined that although the mid-2006 competitive increases ""roughly coincided with the 
District Court's issuance of the injunction,"" this coincidence did not support the reasonable deduction that the injunction ""played 
a meaningful role in producing those competitive gains."" Id. at 157-58. An equally logical inference would be that increased 
competition approximating the issuance of the injunction evidenced the efficacy of the relief. That said, we will abstain from 
extrapolating broad legal conclusions of market competitiveness from data narrowly focused on damages methodology. "
422,54," We have separately observed that ""an initial presumption of fairness"" may apply when reviewing a proposed settlement where: 
""(1) the settlement negotiations occurred at arm's length; (2) there was sufficient discovery; (3) the proponents of the settlement 
are experienced in similar litigation; and (4) only a small fraction of the class objected."" Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 535 (quoting In re 
Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 232 (3d Cir. 2001) (""Cendant""). The District Court  [**116] did not consider or rely upon this 
presumption in assessing fairness. Because we find no error in the Court's thorough analysis, we will likewise disregard this 
presumption."
422,55," The Court noted that, as of March 31, 2008, it had received 433,891 claims forms from all classes — nine from members of 
the Direct Purchaser Class and 433,882 from the Indirect Purchaser Class, with 431,380 from the Consumer Subclass and 
2,502 from the Reseller Subclass. (App'x 291.) The Court also stated that five requests for exclusion had been received from the 
Direct Purchaser Class and 139 from the Indirect Purchaser Class (66 from the Reseller Subclass and 69 from the Consumer 
Subclass). (Id.) The Court received no objections from any direct purchasers and also noted that notice was provided to the 
United States Attorney General and the Attorney Generals of all fifty states, with none seeking to participate in the proceedings. 
(Id. 290-291, 1449-1450.) "
424,56," The objectors aver that drawing a distinction between settlement and litigation classes ""would create two standards for class 
certification"" although  [**123] ""the federal rules do not provide for such a difference."" (Bagolie Br. at 25.) This argument patently 
disregards our clear and consistent precedent on the subject. While the standards for class certification are the same for both 
settlement and litigation classes, certification in the former context need not consider ""whether the case, if tried, would present 
intractable management problems, for the proposal is that there be no trial."" Comm. Bank II, 622 F.3d at 291 (citing Amchem, 
521 U.S. at 620). This added risk is of utmost significance in determining whether a settlement would best serve the interests of 
the class. "
425,57," Peculiarly, the objectors at once argue ""that treble damages could be considered in assessing"" fairness while also presuming 
without cause that a fairness inquiry ""necessarily involves consideration of treble damages."" (Bagolie Br. 38-39 (emphasis 
added).) "
426,58," We agree with our fellow Court of Appeals that, HN39[
] in reaching a private consensual settlement, the ""parties, counsel, 
mediators, and district judges naturally arrive  [**131] at a reasonable range for settlement by considering the likelihood of a 
plaintiffs' or defense verdict, the potential recovery, and the chances of obtaining it, discounted to present value."" Rodriguez, 563 
F.3d at 965. Our principal role in this engagement ""is to protect the unnamed members of the class."" Ehrheart, 609 F.3d at 593. 
As such, we must remain cognizant that our ""'intrusion upon what is otherwise a private consensual agreement negotiated 
between the parties to a lawsuit must be limited to the extent necessary to reach a reasoned judgment that the agreement is not 
the product of fraud or overreaching by, or collusion between, the negotiating parties.'"" Rodriguez, 563 F.3d at 965 (quoting 
Hanlon v. Chrysler Corp., 150 F.3d 1011, 1027 (9th Cir. 1998)); see also GM Truck, 55 F.3d at 805 (same). No assertion of 
collusion, fraud, or overreaching is advanced or evidenced in the settlement at issue here."
426,59," The objectors also allege legal error in the District Court's estimate of the ""best possible recovery"" for the Indirect Purchaser 
Class by reference to the class as a whole, rather than by making separate findings as to estimated damages for the Consumer 
and Reseller subclasses.  [**132] (Bagolie Br. at 27.) This argument falls short. The Special Master — whose findings were 
accepted by the District Court — thoroughly considered several expert reports and econometric models submitted by various 
counsel discussing the proper share of damages within the Indirect Purchaser class. The Special Master established an 
appropriate distribution of the Indirect Purchaser fund based upon estimated damages to both the Consumer and Reseller 
subclasses, and the objectors have not demonstrated the inaccuracy of this analysis. (See App'x 1473-1508.) "
428,60," The objectors' related argument that the de minimis provision will deprive 57 million consumers of monetary recovery even if 
they file a claim is equally weak. (Giddings/Petrus Br. 9.) This contention unfairly presumes that every single putative class 
member will timely submit claims forms, rendering every member's pro rata recovery below $10. By contrast, the evidence 
accepted by the Special Master demonstrated that ""consumer claim filing rates rarely exceed seven percent, even with the most 
extensive notice campaigns."" (App'x 1550 (citation & quotations omitted).) In the absence of any credible evidence subjecting 
the objectors' position, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in adopting the distribution plan. "

] The Gunter factors are as follows: (1) the size of the fund created and the number of persons benefitted; (2) the presence or absence of substantial objections

attorneys involved; (4) the complexity and duration of the litigation; (5) the risk of nonpayment; (6) the amount of time 
devoted to the case by plaintiffs' counsel; and (7) the awards in similar cases."
429,223, F.3d at 195 n.1. 
430,63," The Prudential factors are: (8) the value of benefits attributable to the efforts of class counsel relative to the efforts of other groups, such as 
government agencies conducting investigations, (9) the percentage fee that would have been negotiated had the case been 
subject to a private contingent fee arrangement at the time counsel was retained, and (10)  [**148] any innovative terms of 
settlement. Diet Drugs, 582 F.3d at 541 (citing Prudential, 148 F.3d at 338-40)."
430,64," The objectors' further contention that the size of the percentage fee award should decrease in light of the large size of the 
overall settlement, (Quinn Br. at 66), is premised on several of our opinions in which we stated that ""the percentage of a 
recovery devoted to attorneys' fees should decrease as the size of the overall settlement or recovery increases."" Cendant, 264 "
431,," F.3d at 284 n.55  [**151] (citations & quotations omitted). We so ruled because ""in many instances the increase in recovery is 
merely a factor of the size of the class and has no direct relationship to the efforts of counsel."" Id. In particular, we have vacated 
large fee awards ""'when much of the settlement apparently resulted from the work of state regulators and a multi-state insurance 
task force.'"" Rite Aid, 396 F.3d at 303 (quoting Prudential, 148 F.3d at 338-342). But ""there is no rule that a district court must 
apply a declining percentage reduction in every settlement involving a sizable fund,"" and we have approved large settlements 
where ""class counsel's efforts played a significant role in augmenting and obtaining an immense fund."" Id. Ultimately, ""the fact-
intensive Prudential/Gunter analysis"" must trump all other considerations. Id. Here, plaintiffs' counsel prosecuted this matter through settlement with no certainty as to their ability to enforce any judgment 
against De Beers. The District Court's fact-intensive Gunter analysis found that plaintiffs' counsel deftly and efficiently handled 
this complex matter and played a significant role in the outcome. Accordingly, we disagree that the size of the  [**152] overall 
settlement bears no relationship to the efforts of counsel and will defer to the District Court's considered judgment. "
432,65," We also reject the sole objection pertaining to the District Court's decision to grant incentive awards to class representatives.

discussed the role played by the several class representatives and the risks taken by these parties in prosecuting this matter.

433,4," For a litigation class, the key decision is whether or not to certify the class. Once a class is certified, the dynamics of the case 
change dramatically. For many plaintiffs, denial of certification may sound the death knell of the action because the claims are 
too small to be prosecuted individually. For many defendants, class certification  [**162] may create hydraulic pressure to settle, 
even for claims defendants deem non-meritorious. For these reasons, the Supreme Court adopted Federal Rule of Civil 
Procedure 23(f) to permit a discretionary interlocutory appeal from the grant or denial of class certification. "
434,5," Trial courts can certify subclasses in situations where divergent interests implicate fair allocation—a situation not presented 
here, as all indirect class members have aligned interests. Certifying subclasses may be proper ""[w]here a class is found to 
include subclasses  [**166] divergent in interest."" In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig, 579 F.3d at 271 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 
23(c) advisory committee note). Even the conflicts in Amchem were amenable to resolution through sub-classes. See Ortiz, 527 
U.S. at 856 (explaining that Amchem requires ""a class divided between holders of present and future claims"" to be ""divi[ded] into 
homogeneous subclasses . . . with separate representation to eliminate conflicting interests of counsel""). Objector Quinn, in her 
answer to the petition for rehearing, states that subclasses would adequately address the Illinois Brick-based disparities in this 
case; she does not argue that it would be categorically improper to afford class treatment to indirect purchasers governed by 
Illinois Brick. See Quinn Answer at 11. The District Court here examined whether indirect purchasers' interests diverged 
depending on the law applied to their claims, and found such differences to be irrelevant in the context of this settlement. I find 
no abuse of discretion in such a conclusion. "
435,6," Objectors also claim that variance on state claims (based on consumer protection and unjust enrichment laws) defeats 
predominance as well."
435,7," The purported ""overbreadth"" of the putative class at issue here is qualitatively different from the Supreme Court's concerns in 
Amchem. Under Amchem the significance of variations in state laws is properly assessed in terms of the interests of absent 
class members. The proposed Amchem settlement,  [**170] extinguishing claims for different injuries with different onsets 
incurred at different times due to conduct of different defendants, undercompensated exposure-only claims and those with 
mesothelioma. Here, objectors contend some class members do not have a valid cause of action, but these class members with 
non-repealer state law claims have lost nothing through inclusion in the class. Objectors speculate inclusion of non-repealer 
state law claims necessarily diminishes the settlement accrued to class members whom they contend have undisputedly valid 
claims. But they provided no support for their assertion. In Amchem the objectors provided evidence of intraclass conflicts 
detrimental to class members. For example, 15% of the proposed Amchem settlement's mesothelioma claims arose in 
California, where the average recovery for a mesothelioma claim was more than double their maximum recovery in the 
settlement. Amchem, 521 U.S. at 610 n.14. The objectors have not shown that plaintiffs suffering identical economic injuries due to a single course of conduct on the part of 
the defendant have conflicting interests solely because some class members may have stronger claims depending upon 
variation  [**171] in state law. Objectors assume that the non-repealer state claims have zero settlement value and that 
defendants would contribute the same amount to the common settlement fund regardless of how many claims the settlement 
may extinguish. But the settlement of the considerable bulk of claims against the defendants for a prior course of conduct may "
436,," be of substantially greater value to defendants than a settlement of only the strongest claims against them. And, unlike in 
Amchem, objectors have not shown the inclusion of more claims was achieved by grossly underpaying some class members."
436,8," Rule 23(e) is especially relevant in this context because  [**173] it governs the settlement, dismissal, or compromise of a class 
action. It requires court approval of any agreement, and establishes five procedural requirements that must be satisfied: (1) The court must direct notice in a reasonable manner to all class members who would be bound by the proposal. (2) If the proposal would bind class members, the court may approve it only after a hearing and on finding that it is fair, 
reasonable, and adequate. (3) The parties seeking approval must file a statement identifying any agreement made in connection with the proposal. (4) If the class action was previously certified under Rule 23(b)(3), the court may refuse to approve a settlement unless it 
affords a new opportunity to request exclusion to individual class members who had an earlier opportunity to request 
exclusion but did not do so. (5) Any class member may object to the proposal if it requires court approval under this subdivision (e); the objection may 
be withdrawn only with the court's approval. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e). "
437,9," Facing liability for alleged misconduct, a defendant may desire global settlement for several possible reasons: (1) redressing 
plaintiffs' injuries; (2) the possibility of liability; (3) the direct costs of defending suits, often in multiple fora; (4) the risk of 
financially unmanageable jury verdicts which may threaten bankruptcy; (5) the effects of pending or impending mass litigation on 
its stock price or access to capital markets; (6) the stigma of brand-damaging litigation; and (7) maintaining financial stability."
437,10," In Prudential II, we affirmed the grant of an injunction enjoining a state-court action brought by policyholders who were 
members of the Prudential class to the extent the state-law claims were based on or related to claims released in the class 
action. We agreed with the district court that allowing the policyholders to prosecute their civil actions in state court ""would allow 
an end run around the Class settlement by affording them (and other class members who might later attempt the same strategy) 
an opportunity for relitigation of the released claims."" 261 F.3d at 367 (internal quotation marks omitted). We noted that the 
position urged by the policyholders ""would seriously undermine the possibility for settling any large, multi district class action. 
Defendants in such suits would always be concerned that a settlement of the federal class action would leave them exposed to 
countless  [**177] suits in state court despite settlement of the federal claims. . . . [S]uch state suits could number in the 
millions."" Id. It is for this reason that releases of all claims—whether state or federal—have been held valid, ""provided they are 
based on the same factual predicate."" Prudential, 148 F.3d at 326 n.82. So long as a sufficient factual predicate exists, a release 
can even bar later claims which could not have been brought in the court rendering the settlement judgment. Matsushita Elec.

437,11," The final draft of the American Law Institute's Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation points out the current lack of judicial 
oversight over non-class aggregate settlement. § 3.15 cmt. a (2010). It notes that, unlike class settlements, ""[n]on-class 
aggregate settlements are governed primarily by ethical rules and are rarely subject to court review or approval for fairness"" and 
so advocates ""a fresh look . . . at how non-class aggregate settlements should be regulated."" Id. In particular, it proposes a rule 
to provide each plaintiff  [**179] a nonwaivable right to challenge in court a settlement that is allegedly ""not procedurally and 
substantively fair and reasonable."" § 3.18(a). The ALI Principles analogizes these proposed requirements to those applied to 
class settlements. § 3.17 cmt. e. "
438,1," More precisely, we are dealing here with a set of class actions, since the settlement involves the resolution of several cases, as 
the Majority opinion notes. For ease of reference, however, I will often refer to these matters in the singular."
438,2," The Majority is oddly persistent in this confusion. Despite the clear language in the panel opinion and repeated assurance in 
this dissent that class members need not all share a ""uniform cause of action"" to satisfy the requirements of Rule 23, the 
Majority continues to say by implication and assertion that the panel opinion suggested that all members of the class must assert 
a ""uniform"" cause of action or ""identical ... issues or claims."" See Slip Op. at 46 (""We have never required the presentation of 
identical or uniform issues or claims as a prerequisite to certification of a class.""); id. at 48 (""Nothing in our case law or the 
language of Rule 23 commands that everyone in a class must allege precisely identical or 'uniform' causes of action ... and 
statutory variations do not defeat predominance in the presence of other exceedingly common issues."" (internal citations 
omitted)); id. at 60 n.36 (""The Panel ... seemingly conclude[ed] that plaintiffs could only prevail if each putative class member 
alleged  [**183] either a 'uniform' antitrust cause of action, a 'uniform' consumer protection cause of action, or a 'uniform' unjust 
enrichment claim.""). "
439,3," Both before the panel and the en banc court, objector Susan M. Quinn has taken the lead on the issues of commonality and 
predominance, and my references to the arguments of the objectors come from her briefs."
439,4," Although the parties do not particularly press the issue in their briefs, an argument can be made that the proposed class might 
also fail to meet the requirements of Rule 23(a)(4), which provides that a court may certify a class only if ""the representative 
parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). By proposing a class that consists of 
individuals who have no cause of action under state or federal law, the class representatives have diluted the recovery for those 
who actually have claims. Moreover, the class representatives also unnecessarily incur the cost of giving notice under Rule 23 to 
individuals who have no right to relief, as well as the cost of compensating class counsel for undertaking unnecessary tasks 
associated with such notice. Cf. In the Matter of Aqua Dots Prods. Liability Litig., 654 F.3d 748, 2011 WL 3629723, at *3 (7th Cir. 
2011) (""A representative who proposes that high transaction  [**187] costs (notice and attorneys' fees) be incurred at the class 
members' expense to obtain a refund that is already on offer is not adequately protecting the class members' interests."" (citing 
Thorogood v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 627 F.3d 289, 293-94 (7th Cir. 2010))). Those costs reduce the total amount of recovery 
available to the appropriate members of the proposed class (i.e., individuals who may assert an antitrust claim under federal or 
state law). In other words, a class representative who unnecessarily increases the cost of litigating a class action by including 
improper plaintiffs in the class definition is at risk of being found to not ""adequately protect the interests of the class."" Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23(a)(4). "
440,5," If one were actually to accept a test that looked solely at the behavior of the alleged wrongdoer, it would make no difference 
who was in the class. Thus, in this case, it would be appropriate to certify a class consisting of everyone on earth, regardless of 
diamond purchases, since the supposedly common questions would stay the same."
440,6," While trying to distance itself from the consequences of its own ruling today, the Majority asserts that the ""[indirect purchaser] 
class members ... possess a legally cognizable injury acknowledged in hornbook law, as their injuries are real, and stem not 
from simply feeling 'wronged,' as the dissent suggests ..., but from De Beers's alleged anticompetitive  [**191] conduct, conduct 
which antitrust laws forbid."" (Slip Op. at 44-45.) If only my colleagues in the Majority actually applied that assertion, this dissent 
would be unnecessary, since the assertion concedes that (1) recovery should be preconditioned on the existence of an injury 
that is legally cognizable, and (2) whether an injury is legally cognizable depends on the operative substantive law. "
441,7," Similarly, if predominance means anything, it must mean that the resolution of something will actually affect somehow the 
claims of all class members. The claims might vary among the class members, but, at a minimum, some legal right to recover 
has to be held by everyone in the class."
441,8," A colorable claim is one that at least ""appear[s] to be true, valid, or right."" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 301(9th ed. 2009). Requiring 
a district court to consider whether a claim appears to be valid before certifying class, when the court is expressly apprised of 
good reasons to doubt the same, does not transform the Rule 23 inquiry into one under Rule 12(b)(6), as I discuss infra."
441,9," To the extent that the quoted statement, read in isolation, might suggest a rule that all class members had to share an antitrust 
claim, the context of the statement — coming after a discussion of other types of statutory or common law claims that might give 
rise to common questions — makes it clear that the panel was requiring only that all class members' right to recover arise from 
the same harm or injury — something unambiguously required under Supreme Court precedent. See, e.g., Dukes, 131 S.Ct. at 
2551 (""Commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate  [**195] that the class members have suffered the same injury."" 
(internal quotation marks omitted))."
441,10," The following passage in the American Law Institute's Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation articulates this basic 
principle: The legal and factual issues involved in any individual civil claim are a function of applicable substantive law. ... Factual 
issues concern disputes about whether the evidence at trial demonstrates, under the applicable standard of proof, the 
existence of a given element. ... A factual issue may rise to the level of a common issue if ... a common body of evidence to 
be presented on behalf of multiple claimants at trial is capable of proving the existence of a material fact as to all such 
claimants. ALI, Principles of Law: Aggregate Litigation § 2.01(b)(2010). Thus, the treatise supports the proposition that in order to satisfy 
Rule 23(b)(3)'s commonality requirement, there must be some ""material"" issue. Materiality is a ""function of applicable 
substantive law."" See id; In re Lemington Home for the Aged, 659 F.3d 282, 290 (3d Cir. 2011) (""A material fact is '[a] fact[] that 
might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'"" (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 
S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986))). By necessary implication, if certain  [**197] members of the proposed class cannot assert 
a claim under either federal or state law, then there can be no common questions of law or fact that are ""material."" "
442,11," There are at least two other problems with the Majority's assertion that ""[t]o adopt the position of the dissent and the objectors 
is to introduce a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry as to every claim in the class before a class may be certified."" (Slip Op. at 59.) First, it 
ducks the difficulty at the center of this case, which is not and never has been about merely dubious claims. Claims that are of 
doubtful quality still have, as the adjective indicates, some doubt about them, which means they still retain at least some 
superficial possibility of being valid. Such claims, because they cling to that possibility, will typically not need to cause a district 
judge any agita in addressing the certification of a class for settlement purposes. The central problem in this case, however, 
goes beyond factual disputes or debatable points of law. The problem here is that there are class members who, according to 
the plain terms of controlling law, have no claim at all, not even a dubious one. We are not rightfully at liberty to ignore that, nor 
was the District Court. The second problem with the Majority's parade-of-horribles rhetoric in response to the suggestion "
443,," [**201] that class members should actually have claims (see Slip Op. at 60-66) is that objectors have always been entitled to 
raise a legal challenge to claims being included in a class, even a settlement class. Cf. Hydrogen Peroxide, 552 F.3d at 320 (""[A] 
district court exercising proper discretion in deciding whether to certify a class will ... make findings that each Rule 23 
requirement is met or not met, having considered all relevant evidence and arguments presented by the parties.""). In other 
words, district courts have always been required to ensure that the requisites of Rule 23 have been met, and that includes an 
obligation to address the non-frivolous arguments and objections that are put to them. A court does not need to assess sua 
sponte every potential problem, nor need it engage in ""an intensive cataloguing of each class member's claim"" (Slip Op. at 62), 
but it must give objections their due."
443,12," The Majority's recoiling at the individualized assessment of claims also reflects a failure to appreciate that some such 
assessment does typically take place at some point during the settlement process. The parties share a common interest in 
ensuring that individuals falling outside the class do not share the benefits of the settlement. For that reason, a class member 
here must submit a proof of claim demonstrating his or her purchase of a diamond within the relevant time period. As is often the 
case, parties to an antitrust settlement want to ensure that individuals seeking a share of the settlement actually bought a 
product with an allegedly inflated price, demonstrating their membership in the class. See Warfarin Sodium II, 391 F.3d at 525. 
Some  [**203] settlements create elaborate systems for evaluating not only the validity but the severity of each class member's 
injury. See In re Prudential Sales Co. Am. Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 295-96 (3d Cir. 1998). These proofs 
of claim are rarely evaluated by the court. ""Although the court has general supervisory powers over settlements, it usually does 
not handle the actual administration. As a rule, the administration is delegated either to a special master or to the plaintiff's 
counsel or a committee of counsel."" 4 Alba Conte & Herbert Newberg, Newberg on Class Actions § 11:33 at 68-69 (4th ed. 
2002). It is universally recognized that the special master, committee, or other body created to administer the settlement 
agreement is responsible for evaluating the validity of claims and calculating the individualized recovery of a particular class 
member. See David F. Herr, Manual for Complex Litigation § 21.661 (4th ed. 2011) (""The administrator or special master may be 
charged with reviewing the claims and deciding whether to allow claims that are late, deficient in documentation, or questionable 
for other reasons.""). "
444,13," For a more detailed discussion of which states preclude claims entirely, see Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 147-48 & n.10-11, 150-51. 
According to the Majority, the panel opinion ""undertook a wide-ranging fact-finding review of state antitrust statutes ... ."" (Slip Op. 
at 29.) That description is puzzling, however, because there was no fact-finding involved. The review of state law was just that: a 
review of law. The panel opinion took the very ordinary approach of examining the laws on which the plaintiffs purported to base 
their claims, including state antitrust laws. The opinion also stated: We are certainly not saying that nuanced differences among state laws will prevent the certification of a class, nor are we 
suggesting that a state-by-state cataloguing of differences in state law is necessary every time a multi-jurisdiction class is 
certified. We are saying that the difference between having an antitrust claim under state law and having none is no mere 
nuance and cannot be solved by any reconfiguration of the nationwide class short of changing it from a nationwide class to 
one or more classes that exclude those who  [**207] have no claim. Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 148 n.12. Both the Majority and the Concurring Opinions claim that it is wrong for us to pay attention to the 
differences in state law because, as the Concurrence puts it, ""trial courts would be obligated at the settlement class certification 
stage to decide which state's law would govern ... ."" (Concurrence Slip Op. at 9.) It bears repeating, then, that nothing said by 
the panel opinion or in this dissent would entail the cataloguing of differences in state law in the mine run of cases. However, 
when, as in this case, an objection has been raised pointing out that there is a body of claims that are undeniably impermissible 
under the law of the state which governs them, we are not free to shirk the responsibility of separating those unfounded claims 
from the class."
444,14," It is not clear, to begin with, that the Majority's ""statutory standing"" label accurately describes the substantive law of the several 
states denying a claim to indirect purchasers. That aside, and although a dismissal for lack of statutory standing may be viewed 
as akin to a dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), see Baldwin v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 636 F.3d 69, 
73 (3d Cir. 2011) (noting that ""[a] dismissal for lack of statutory standing is effectively the same as a dismissal for failure to state 
a claim""), compelling authority teaches that the absence of statutory standing can also implicate the court's power to adjudicate 
a dispute under Article III, see Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 
210 (1998) (""Dismissal for lack of subject-matter  [**210] jurisdiction because of the adequacy of the federal claim is proper ... 
when the claim is so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of 
merit as not to involve a federal controversy."" (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have suggested this ourselves, see 
Malaysia Int'l Shipping Corp. v. Sinochem Int'l Co. Ltd., 436 F.3d 349, 359 (3d Cir. 2006) (stating that ""non-Article III jurisdictional 
issues like statutory standing"" fit within a category of cases somewhere between cases that have ""jurisdictional issues that 
cannot be bypassed because Article III of our Constitution requires that they be addressed"" and cases ""with merits-related 
issues, which cannot be reached without first verifying jurisdiction"" (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)), rev'd on 
other grounds, 549 U.S. 422, 127 S. Ct. 1184, 167 L. Ed. 2d 15 (2007), and other circuits have held the same, see Crawford v. 
Lamantia, 34 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1994) (statutory standing under ERISA) (""[W]e note that the basis for '[s]tanding, since it goes 
to the very power of the court to act, must exist at all stages of the proceeding, and not merely when the action is initiated or 
during an  [**211] initial appeal.'""); Alexander v. Anheuser Busch Co., 990 F.2d 536, 538 (10th Cir. 1993) (statutory standing 
under ERISA) (""In reviewing Alexander's ERISA claims, we raise, sua sponte, the question whether he has standing to bring 
such claims. The issue of standing is jurisdictional in nature.""); Sommers Drug Stores Co. Employee Profit Sharing Trust v. "
445,," Corrigan, 883 F.2d 345, 349 (5th Cir. 1989) (statutory standing under ERISA) (""We have recognized, however, that standing is 
essential to the exercise of jurisdiction, and that lack of standing can be raised at any time by a party or by the court.""); cf. 
Mainstreet Org. of Realtors v. Calumet City, 505 F.3d 742, 747 (7th Cir. 2007) (Posner, J.) (describing lack of statutory standing 
under Illinois Brick as ""not jurisdictional, at least in the conventional sense[,]"" but nonetheless ""belong[ing] to an intermediate 
class of cases in which a court can notice an error and reverse on the basis of it even though no party has noticed it"")."
445,15," Whether a party has standing under Article III is a distinct inquiry from whether the party may assert a cause of action under 
state or federal law. In Bond v. United States, 131 S. Ct. 2355, 2362, 180 L. Ed. 2d 269 (2011),  [**212] the Supreme Court 
made clear that a party may have standing under Article III, but fail to assert a cause of action under state law. See id. at 2362 
(""Still, the question whether a plaintiff states a claim for relief 'goes to the merits' in the typical case, not the justiciability of a 
dispute, and conflation of the two concepts can cause confusion."" (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). However, 
even assuming indirect purchasers have standing under Article III, they have no claim under federal law and many of them lack 
standing to assert any claim under relevant state law. Because the proposed class includes such individuals, it cannot satisfy 
Rule 23(b)(3)'s commonality requirement."
445,16," Again, assuming that ""statutory standing"" is the appropriate description of the principle under state law. See supra n. 13. "
446,17," The Majority uses Ohio's CPA as an example and does not discuss whether fraud claims were brought under the CPAs of 
other states following Illinois Brick. Nonetheless, the pleading deficiency is the same for allegations involving the laws of other 
states. The Sullivan and Null complaints are the only complaints to invoke the CPAs of the states following Illinois Brick and, as 
discussed above, neither of those complaints allege fraud; they merely pin the ""fraud"" label on the price-fixing behavior at issue. 
Consequently, there is no claim for fraud under the laws of any state adhering to Illinois Brick."
446,18," Those questions are: (a) Whether [D]efendants combined or conspired with others to fix, raise, stabilize and maintain the prices of polished 
diamonds; (b) Whether [D]efendants monopolized or combined or conspired with others to monopolize the supply of polished 
diamonds; (c)  [**216] Whether [D]efendants' conduct caused the prices of polished diamonds to be maintained at higher levels than 
would exist in a competitive market; (d) Whether [P]laintiffs and the Class[es] are entitled to injunctive relief; and (e) Whether [D]efendants' conduct caused injury to the business or property of [P]laintiffs and the other [Class and] 
Subclass Members and, if so, the appropriate class-wide measure of damages. (App. at 276.)"
446,19," In its effort to diminish the significance of the state laws denying a cause of action to indirect purchasers, the Majority likens 
those laws to pre-suit notice requirements or other issues of form that may vary from state to state. (Slip Op. at 65.) But we are 
not talking here about the niceties of notice. In a class action invoking the laws of multiple jurisdictions, there will often be 
variations in the law pertaining to how a particular claim is to be presented. Those variations may at times be framed as 
prerequisites to the bringing of a cause of action or restrictions on the manner in which the action is brought. Were the 
aggregated claims to be brought individually, those prerequisites would in all likelihood be met on a claim-by-claim basis, but, 
since the claims are aggregated, those prerequisites are appropriately bypassed. They amount to nothing more than variations 
in form, not in kind, and neither the panel opinion in this case nor the objectors nor this dissent have advocated the elevation of 
form over substance. Differences in form are not at issue here; it  [**218] is the very existence of any cause of action at all that is 
at stake. The distinction is crucial."
446,20," I am not suggesting that no class of indirect purchasers could have been certified here. On the contrary, as the panel opinion 
noted, It may be that the antitrust and consumer protection statutes in a more limited number of states are sufficiently similar that 
common issues of law or fact would predominate with respect to plaintiffs in those jurisdictions. However, it was improper "
447,," for the District Court to certify a nationwide class of plaintiffs based on state law when many states withhold antitrust 
standing from indirect purchasers and where the variability in consumer protection and unjust enrichment law in a context 
like this is extreme. Sullivan, 613 F.3d at 153-54."
447,21," The Majority tries to deny this, saying that a state court would only dismiss the invalid claim upon a motion by the defendant. 
(Slip Op. at 71 n.43.) But the procedural mechanism that prompts application of substantive law is irrelevant. Whether or not a 
motion brings to light a claim's fatal flaw, the flaw is there. To continue with the Ohio law example, there is clearly no colorable 
claim for an indirect purchaser, and that is true whether or not a defendant chooses to file a motion to dismiss. Ohio law does not 
depend on the whim of De Beers or any other defendant. It is telling that the Majority's rejoinder on this point is, in effect, ""yes, 
the claimant could be tossed out of state court, but only if there were a motion."" That seems a concession that the differing 
results that now obtain in this Circuit and in Ohio state courts reflect an expansion of substantive rights. As to the ""there must be 
a motion"" comment, irrelevant and of questionable accuracy though it may be, it prompts re-emphasis of this fact: there was a 
motion in this case, in the form of the objections to the nationwide  [**222] settlement of the indirect purchaser class. Thus, the 
legal problem was squarely before the District Court, as it is now before us. It does not matter that the motion came from 
someone other than De Beers. The issue has been raised and cannot be dodged by saying no one brought it up. Nor can it be 
avoided by saying that De Beers could have settled an individual suit in Ohio. We are obviously not dealing with the settlement 
of a dispute between private parties in Ohio state court; we are dealing with a class action settlement binding on absent parties 
and sanctioned by a federal court purporting to apply Ohio law."
447,22," Herein lies a fundamental flaw in the Concurring Opinion as well, which takes the view that ""[u]nder Amchem the significance 
of variations in state law is properly assessed in terms of the interests of absent class members[,]"" and that here class members 
from states adhering to Illinois Brick ""have lost nothing through inclusion in the class."" (Concurrence Slip Op. at 10 n.7.) Very "
448,," true. The problem here is not that some absent class members who deserve compensation are left out by the settlement. The 
problem is that some class members who deserve nothing are included in  [**223] the settlement and hence are diluting the 
recovery of those who are entitled to make claims. That harm is real, and the cause of it, the overbreadth of the class, is akin to 
the problem in Amchem. See Amchem, 521 U.S. at 620 (""But other specifications of [Rule 23] — those designed to protect 
absentees by blocking unwarranted or overbroad class definitions — demand undiluted, even heightened, attention in the 
settlement context."")."
448,23," The Majority cites Warfarin Sodium II in an effort to justify its decision today, but we were careful to say in that case that ""there 
may be situations where variations in state law are so significant so as to defeat commonality and predominance even in a 
settlement class."" 391 F.3d at 529. That observation seems obvious and unassailable, and we are presented here with exactly 
that kind of situation. If we cannot bring ourselves to say plainly that the certification here was improper, one is forced to wonder 
what limit is left on the reach of Rule 23."
448,24," The Majority also writes that, in Prudential, ""we agreed with the district court that 'approval of a settlement under Rule 23 
merely recognizes the parties' voluntary compromise  [**226] of their rights and does not itself affect their substantive state law 
rights,"" and, therefore, held that ""the proposed settlement could not violate the Rules Enabling Act."" (Slip Op. at 70 (quoting 
Prudential, 148 F.3d at 324).) However, we also held in Prudential that the proposed settlement was not contrary to the cited 
state law, and, therefore, the Rules Enabling Act could not possibly have been implicated. Prudential, 148 F.3d at 324 & n.77. "
449,25," The Concurring Opinion's assertion that the settlement of a class action is merely ""a contract between the parties"" 
(Concurrence Slip Op.  [**230] at 12) misses this point, though the opinion adds a reference to Rule 23 (id. at 12-13 n.8). The 
states have an interest in not having their laws strained beyond recognition or ignored entirely. A class action settlement, 
whether it involves a settlement or a litigation class, is not simply a private contract. If it were, it would not need court approval, 
and federal courts called upon to supervise class actions, including resulting settlements, are obligated to see that Rule 23 does 
not become a tool for modifying state law. "

the entry of the stay order. The stay precludes anything in this opinion from affecting MCLM at this time. "
475,2," The parties cite the five-factor test articulated in California courts. See Lucido v. Super. Ct. of Mendocino Cnty., 51 Cal. 3d 335, 
272 Cal. Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223, 1225 (Cal. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 920, 111 S. Ct. 2021, 114 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1991). 
Because the  [*15] tests are substantively the same in all respects relevant here, the different articulations do not change the 
outcome. "
478,3," Defendants assert that plaintiffs' section 207 claim is time-barred under 47 U.S.C. § 415(b). Having found that plaintiffs failed to 
state a claim under section 207, the Court need not address this issue in depth. The Third Circuit has spoken on the issue, 
holding that ""when a defendant's conduct is part of a continuing practice, an action is timely so long as the last act evidencing 
the continuing practice falls within the limitations period."" Brenner v. Local 514, United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners of Am., 927 
F.2d 1283, 1295 (3d Cir. 1991). Here, plaintiffs' claim is that the defendants' unjust and unreasonable practice is the continuing 
disregard of Commission regulations and orders, and the continued warehousing of AMTS licenses. Because these are ongoing 
activities, the statute of limitations has not yet started to run. "
501,1," Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, as recently amended, requires only that parties support their factual statements by citation to materials in

501,2," The Court rejects Purolite's further argument that the proposed declaration is not sufficient for purposes of compliance with the 
local rule. "
502,3," The Court rejects Purolite's argument that Layne waived this defense of the statute of limitations by raising it for the first time in 
the Pretrial Order. Whether or not the defense was raised before, it has been included without objection in the Pretrial Order, 
and thus the defense is properly in the case. Purolite has not moved to amend the Pretrial Order to strike that defense. 
Moreover, it appears  [**16] that any such motion to amend would not succeed, as Layne notes that Purolite did not plead this 
specific counterclaim regarding the specifications until the Pretrial Order was prepared. The Court also rejects Layne's argument that this claim is barred by laches, waiver, or estoppel. Layne improperly raised this 
argument for the first time in its reply brief. See, e.g., U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Bunge N. Am., Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59737, 
2008 WL 3077074, at *9 n.7 (D. Kan. Aug. 4, 2008) (court will not consider issues raised for first time in reply brief) (citing 
Minshall v. McGraw Hill Broadcasting Co., 323 F.3d 1273, 1288 (10th Cir. 2003)). Moreover, Layne failed to analyze the 
elements of any of those doctrines, and thus has failed to establish those affirmative defenses as a matter of law. "
504,4," Because the parties have agreed that Delaware law governs all claims for breach of the Agreement, pursuant to a choice-of-
law provision therein, the Court has also applied Delaware law for purposes of resolving the parties' summary judgment motions. 
The parties have not addressed the scope of that choice-of-law provision, however, or whether the law of the place of 
performance could govern issues not relating to the interpretation of the Agreement. See, e.g., Layne Christensen Co. v. Zurich 
Canada, 30 Kan. App. 2d 128, 142, 38 P.3d 757 (2002) (noting difficulty is deciding whether to apply law of place of contracting 
or place of performance). Thus, the Court does not comment on which state's law will be applied at trial. "
505,5," In support of its claim for nominal damages, Purolite cites an unpublished opinion, Ivize of Milwaukee, LLC v. Compex 
Litigation Support, LLC, 2009 Del. Ch. LEXIS 55, 2009 WL 1111179 (Del. Ch. Apr. 27, 2009) (unpub. op.). In Ivize, the court 
stated that ""the breach of a contractual obligation often warrants an award of nominal damages."" See 2009 Del. Ch. LEXIS 55, 
[WL] at *12 (citing Palmer v. Moffat, 2004 Del. Super. LEXIS 51, 2004 WL 397051, at *4 (Del. Super. Feb. 27, 2004) (unpub. 
op.)). In Palmer, however, an unpublished district court opinion on which the Ivize court relied, the court noted that ""[e]ven where 
nominal damages are possible, a trial is not always warranted,"" and it refused to allow such a claim in that case because 
 [**29] no loss was shown by the plaintiff and a trial on liability would have been a futile exercise. See Palmer, 2004 Del. Super. 
LEXIS 51, 2004 WL 397051, at *4-5 (citing 22 Am. Jur. 2d, Damages § 9, p.39). Similarly here, no purpose would be served by 
allowing this claim for nominal damages to proceed to trial (there is no claim for injunctive relief, for example), and Purolite has 
not cited any authority that would require the trial of such a claim for nominal damages for breach of contract. Moreover, the fact 
that Purolite cannot assert an affirmative claim for this breach does not preclude Purolite's assertion of the breach as an 
affirmative defense to Layne's own claim for breach of the Agreement. "
506,6," Because of this ruling, the Court need not address the merits of this claim, including the meaning of ""pursue"" and whether 
Layne did pursue Resin Tech as a matter of law."
506,7," As noted above, the consequential damage limitation in the Agreement did not apply to breaches of Section 11 of the 
Agreement. "
507,8," Under Delaware law, which the parties agree applies here, resulting damage from the breach is an element of a claim for 
breach of contract. See H-M Wexford LLC v. Encorp, Inc., 832 A.2d 129, 140 (Del. Ch. 2003); see also Paul v. Deloitte & 
Touche, LLP, 974 A.2d 140 (Del. 2009) (affirming summary judgment based on failure to show damage from alleged breach of 
contract). "
508,9," Purolite also cites testimony by a SolmeteX executive that because of the definition of  [**36] ""Media"", SolmeteX was in a 
better situation than he initially anticipated, and because of that ""loophole"", SolmeteX could have another company make the 
product with a non-Purolite bead. Of course, if a contract is unambiguous, such parol evidence is not admissible to alter or add a 
term to the contract or even to create an ambiguity, see Capital Mgmt. Co. v. Brown, 813 A.2d 1094, 1097 (Del. 2002), and the 
Court concludes that there is no ambiguity here."
508,10," Because of this ruling, the Court does not address the parties' arguments concerning the interpretation of ""sales activities"" and 
whether the alleged acts fell within the scope of that term."
508,11," In addition, a claim for breach of the implied covenant does not fall within any of the exceptions in Section 9.4 of the 
Agreement; therefore, this claim, by which Purolite seeks damages for lost sales, would also be barred by that section's 
prohibition against the recovery of lost profits and other consequential damages. "
511,12," At one point in the opinion,  [**47] the Barton court mistakenly referred to Section 50-118, but it referred at other places to the 
defendant's argument under Section 50-112, and it quoted and considered the latter statute. See Barton, 167 Kan. 754, 208 
P.2d 590. "
512,13," After these rulings by the Court, the only remaining counterclaim is Purolite's claim for breach of contract, in the amount of 
$53,802.11, based on SolmeteX's alleged failure to pay for product sold to it by Purolite in 2009. (See Pretrial Order ¶ 5.b.) "
513,14," In light of the parties' briefs relating to Purolite's counterclaims, the Court rejects Purolite's argument that Layne improperly 
failed to negate this defense in its initial brief on this motion. "
514,15, The Court again declines to address the merits of this assertion of breach. See supra note 4.
514,16," In light of these rulings, the Court need not address Layne's argument that Purolite elected not to repudiate the Agreement 
after the alleged prior breaches."
514,17," The cases cited by Layne on this issue are inapposite. In two of the cases, the courts noted that Rule 408 permits the use of 
statements in settlement negotiations for purposes other than those prohibited in the rule, such as to show an admission of fact. 
See Vulcan Hart Corp. v. NLRB, 718 F.2d 269, 277 (8th Cir. 1983); Urico v. Parnell Oil Co., 708 F.2d 852, 854 (1st Cir. 1983). In 
this case, however, Layne seeks to use the evidence to establish the amount of its claim—a use expressly prohibited by the rule. 
The other two cases cited by Layne were not decided by reference to Rule 408, and thus they are unhelpful. See Cooper v. 
Brown, 126 F.2d 874, 878 (3d Cir. 1942); Nebraska Drillers, Inc. v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co. of N.Y., 123 F. Supp. 678, 682 (D. 
Colo. 1954). "
516,18," Given the plain language of Section 11.2 making this provision applicable after the Agreement is otherwise no longer in force, 
the Court rejects Purolite's argument that Layne was required to argue in its initial brief that the provision survived termination."
516,19," Purolite argues that Layne must establish that the restraint on competition is reasonable by clear and convincing evidence, 
based on Delaware caselaw stating that a party seeking specific performance of a non-competition provision must meet that 
evidentiary standard. See, e.g., American Homepatient, Inc. v. Collier, 2006 Del. Ch. LEXIS 79, 2006 WL 1134170, at *2 (Del. 
Ch. Apr. 19, 2006) (unpub. op.). The applicability of that standard to this case is not clear, however, in light of the fact that the 
provision here is not like the typical employment or sale-of-business non-compete analyzed by the Delaware courts, as 
discussed below. Nevertheless, the Court concludes that the result here would be the same whether or not that standard is 
applied, as the evidence showing the reasonableness of the provision is clear and convincing in this case. "
517,20," The Tenth Circuit stated that, although MAI Basic involved a contract dispute in New Mexico, its rationale was equally 
applicable in the case before it under Colorado law. See Harvey Barnett, Inc., 338 F.3d at 1134 n.12. "
519,21," Layne did not move for summary judgment on its claim for damages for breach of this provision of Section 11.2; therefore, the 
amount of damages suffered by Layne for this breach (which has been established as a matter of law) remains an issue for trial. "
520,22," Moreover, Layne has not asserted a claim under the SolmeteX NDA in the Pretrial Order. "
522,23," Purolite does not make any separate arguments concerning dependent Claims 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13. Instead, Purolite argues 
only that plaintiffs' inability to show infringement of independent Claim 1 also dooms their claims for infringement of those 
dependent claims. "
523,24," The Court rejects Purolite's argument that there is no evidence of iron within the halo between the bead's shell and core 
sections. Dr. Stack's graph of his iron measurements for each of the two beads shows a concentration above zero for the halo 
point, and, indeed, plaintiffs have argued that the concentration at the shell was more than 40 times that in the halo, which 
calculation presumes some measurable amount at  [**92] the halo. Dr. Stack's deposition testimony that the halo ""effectively"" 
has no iron does not controvert his own measurements showing at least some amount of iron there. "
525,25," Based on an agreed construction, the Court construed the term ""salt of a metal"" to mean ""the compound formed when the 
hydrogen of an acid is replaced by a metal, such as a solution of a ferrous salt, such as ferrous sulphate, ferrous ammonium 
sulfate, ferrous chloride, or ferrous acetate."" These examples from the Court's construction are the same examples of the 
""oxidizable salt of a metal"" that is reacted in solution, from the specification excerpt that Dr. SenGupta discussed in his 
deposition. Clearly, then, the Court construed only the term ""salt of a metal"" from Claim 1, and did not construe the term ""salt of 
said metal"" found later in Claim 1. "
526,26," Plaintiffs argue that Purolite nonetheless may not use invalidity as a defense to plaintiffs' claim for royalties. Because that 
claim is not at issue in these motions, the Court does not address that argument. "
527,27," Dr. Stack also conceded that he had used the terms ""compound"" and ""salt"" imprecisely in articles to refer to substances that 
carry a net charge. "
528,28," Because Purolite has not preserved a defense under 35 U.S.C. § 112 ¶ 2, see supra Part V.B.2, the Court does not address 
Purolite's argument that Claim 1 is invalid pursuant to that paragraph's requirement that the specification claim the subject 
matter that the applicant ""regards as his invention."" "
529,29," Dr. Stack's analysis of specific language in the specification and discovery from Dr. SenGupta related and is relevant only to 
his opinion on compliance with the enablement requirement. "
532,30," If a prior art reference was not before the PTO, there would, of course, be no deference, see Tokai, 632 F.3d at 1367; the 
clear-and-convincing evidence  [**127] standard still applies, however, although it may be easier to meet that standard with 
respect to a reference not before the PTO, see Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 131 S. Ct. 2238, 2251, 180 L. Ed. 2d 131 
(2011). "
533,31," Although Purolite points out that the title was changed by the PTO examiner, the application contained a similar title. "
534,32," The  [**133] Court also rejects plaintiffs' argument based on Purolite's request for a construction by the Court of the word 
""ligand"". The Court does not consider Purolite, by such request, to have admitted or to be estopped from disputing that the 
preamble should be deemed a claim limitation in Claim 15. "
535,33," Because of this construction, the Court need not construe the term ""molecules"" or determine whether that term excludes ions, 
as suggested by plaintiffs' expert, or whether it does include ions under its ordinary defintion."
535,34," With respect to the fifth MIEX reference, the Singer and Bilyk article, the Court concludes that a question of fact remains 
whether the article, which refers only to iron oxide ""integrated into the resin structure,"" satisfies the ""dispersed throughout"" 
limitation; thus, that reference does not support a finding of invalidity as a matter of law."
535,35," The Court rejects plaintiffs' argument that the MIEX product was not ""in public use or on sale in this country"" early enough for 
consideration as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). Orica's representative testified that the product was in public use before the 
relevant date, and plaintiffs' citation to evidence that the first sale was later does not controvert that testimony. Moreover, the 
representative was not required to have personal knowledge of that fact because the deposition was conducted pursuant to Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6). See, e.g., Payless Shoesource Worldwide, Inc. v. Target Corp., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28878, 2008 WL 
973118, at *9 (D. Kan. Apr. 8, 2008) (Rule 30(b)(6) deponent's discharge of his duty does not require personal knowledge)."
535,36," Remaining issues of fact, particularly with respect to the ""dispersed throughout"" limitation, preclude reliance on the other five 
prior art references cited by Purolite for purposes of summary judgment on this defense. "
542,1," Plaintiffs exclude the following people from their definition of the class: Plaintiffs' counsel; Defendant's employees; government 
 [*15] agencies; this Court and the immediate family members and staff of the Court. Originally, Plaintiffs also excluded 
addresses where the consumer receives multi-channel video programming distribution (""MVPD"") service from at least one other 
cable MVPD. However, Plaintiffs no longer exclude this category of people and offer to file another amended complaint to reflect 
this change. Because Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification is herein denied, this request is moot."
542,2," For example, Cox customers can subscribe to various Paks based on their particular interests, like the Sports & Information 
Pak and the Movie Pak. (Def.'s Br., Dkt. No. 181, at 11 & n.26 (describing the different channels available in the Sports and 
Information Pak depending on the region).) "
544,3," The named representatives include the following people: David Abdullah; Bobby Bowick; Elizabeth and John Brady; Sharon 
Coughlin; Jessica Diket; Bradley Gelder; Trevor Haynes; Michael Helmstetter, Jr.; Henry Holmes; Barksdale Hortenstine; Ernest 
Johnson; Sandra Prezgay; Danielle Smith; and Ron Strobo. "
545,4," ""In a class action brought under Rule 23(b)(3), the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2) is subsumed under, or 
superseded by, the more stringent Rule 23(b)(3) requirement that questions common to the class predominate over other 
questions."" Lienhart v. Dryvit Sys., Inc., 255 F.3d 138, 146 n.4 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 
U.S. 591, 609, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Rule 23(b)(3) predominance 
requirement is ""far more demanding"" than Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement. Amchem Prods., 521 U.S. at 623."
545,5," In 2003, Rule 23 was amended so that the determination of whether class counsel would fairly and adequately represent the 
class occurs  [*27] after the class has been certified. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g). "
547,6," Plaintiffs also include the channels available through basic cable as an inframarginal feature, or a feature that you must 
subscribe to in order to subscribe to premium cable. (Hr'g Tr. 31, 112 (stating that subscribers to only basic cable would not be 
included in the class).)"
547,7," At the class certification hearing, Dr. Burtis testified that she did not intend to concede that premium cable and set-top boxes 
were separate products. (Hr'g Tr. 158.) This clarification does not influence the Court's decision for present purposes that 
common evidence could establish whether these products are separate. "
548,8," Dr. Singer relies on a method called revealed preferences to reach his conclusion that customers rent a set-top box to gain 
access to its interactive features and not its other features, such as the clock and outlet jacks, due to the low replacement costs 
of those features. (Pls.' Br., Dkt. No. 209, at 13-14, Ex. 8, at 33-35; Hr'g Tr. 103 (""That [Ms. Coughlin] was willing to incur an 
additional $3.25 per month to get into the interactive realm  [*36] is—reveals that she values the option to make use of those 
features. Whether she ever made use of the features in actuality is a different method[ that] . . . is not very relevant to my 
analysis."").) Defendant's expert disagrees with this conclusion and argues that the only way to determine which features the 
customer preferred is by conducting individual evaluations. (Def.'s Br., Dkt. No 247, at 4-5, Ex. 2, at 4-5.)"
548,9," Defendant cites Ungar for the proposition that ""[e]stablishing that buyers purchase products A and B from the seller does not 
establish that the seller ties the sale of product A to the purchase of product B. It merely establishes that buyers purchase 
products A and B from the seller."" Ungar, 531 F.2d at 1225. While that may be true, here, Plaintiffs proffer common evidence 
that Cox allegedly provides a degraded product A when customers did not also purchase product B, which is a different 
scenario."
548,10," Chase Parkway Garage, Inc. v. Subaru of New England, Inc., 94 F.R.D. 330, 331-32 (D. Mass. 1982) (agreeing with the Third 
Circuit's analysis in Bogosian v. Gulf Oil Corp., 561 F.2d 434 (3d Cir. 1977), ""that proof of coercion on an individual basis was 
not required where a seller expressly conditioned the sale of one product upon the purchase of another""); Ungar, 531 F.2d at 
1222, 1226 & n.17 (""With regard to the doctrine of individual coercion we believe it is open to us to reject it, as the district court 
did, or to accept it. Having in mind the particular factual complex before us, we choose the latter course. . . . Where, as here, 
plaintiff franchisees place no reliance on express contractual tie-ins, each, individually, must prove that his purchases were 
coerced as an element of establishing a prima facie case of illegal tying."")."
548,11," While Cox also stated that its customers were free to rent a CableCard or obtain another set-top box, it explicitly stated that 
customers who chose this path would be unable to access certain  [*40] interactive programming. (Def.'s Br., Dkt. No. 181 Exs. 
25 & 26.) "
549,12," Dr. Singer concludes that DBS providers are not true competitors of premium cable because ""DBS often has weaker two-way 
service than other forms of MVPD."" (Dkt. No. 160, Ex. 13 at 77.)"
549,13," Over-the-top providers do not have their own infrastructure. Rather, these services ride over the top of another entity's 
infrastructure, such as a broadband or high-speed Internet infrastructure. (Hr'g Tr. 60.) "
551,14," In their First Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs state that ""[t]he relevant geographic market is the area in which Cox provides 
Premium Cable. . . . Those areas are certain communities in: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, 
Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Virginia."" (Amend. Compl., Dkt. No. 17, at 
20.)"
551,15," Defendant claims that Plaintiffs have not raised individual markets as possible geographic markets. (Def.'s Br., Dkt. No. 181, at 
36.) While Plaintiffs have stated that they seek certification based on numerous geographic subclasses, they have not supported 
this request with appropriate discussion. (Amend. Compl. Dkt. No. 17, at 21 (""In the alternative, each of the local areas in which 
Cox operates is a relevant geographic market.""). In Plaintiffs' Motion to Certify the Class, they note that they ""believe  [*48] that 
one class that covers Cox's footprint is both the proper class to be certified and the most convenient. However, should the Court 
certify numerous classes that correspond to each of Cox's local markets, Plaintiffs respectfully request the opportunity to add 
class representatives who reside in those markets in which Plaintiffs have not yet named a class representative."" (Pls.' Br., Dkt. 
No. 160, at 31 n.9.) While Plaintiffs have stated in passing that the appropriate geographic market could be regional markets, 
they have not fleshed out this argument in the briefs sufficiently to establish that Rule 23 is satisfied as to each region, and the 
Court will not now undertake that responsibility itself. This, however, does not determine whether class actions would be 
appropriate at the regional market level. For present purposes, the Court only determines the market fully briefed: the national 
market."
551,16," In Heerwagen, the Second Circuit upheld the district court's finding that a putative class of concert ticket buyers should not be 
certified because the defendant lacked ""the power to control prices and exclude competition nationally."" Id. at 224-25, 229 (""In 
light of the substantial non-common issues regarding market power, and because we review the district court's factual 
determination as to the bounds of the relevant geographic market for clear error, it was not error for the district court to conclude 
that individualized questions would predominate."" (citations omitted)). Specifically, the Second Circuit upheld the district court's 
conclusion that the defendant's national conduct—namely, nationally coordinating concert tours—was not enough to establish 
that common issues would predominate under Rule 23(b)(3) when the relevant geographic market for concert tickets was local. 
Id. at 229."
551,17," Cox's own upper management admits  [*51] to having pricing power in its investor documents. Pat Esser, President of Cox, 
stated in a 2006 overview that ""[w]e believe we have Pricing Power[;] We have record low churn rates[;] . . . We have majority 
share in video and HSI."" (Pls.' Hr'g Ex. H.) "
552,18," Cox's national headquarters selected the manufacturer of the set-top box, the features of the set-top box, and determined the 
range of rates charged for the set-top box, with final approval over lease rates. (Pls.' Br., Dkt. No. 160 Ex. 42 at 11-12; Hr'g Tr.

(July 21, 2006) (""In the past, the Commission has concluded that the relevant geographic market for MVPD services is local 
because consumers make decisions based on the MVPD choices available to them at their residences and are unlikely to 
change residences to avoid a small but significant increase in the price of MVPD service. In order to simplify the analysis, the 
Commission has aggregated consumers that face the same choice in MVPD products into larger relevant geographic markets. 
We find it appropriate to continue  [*54] this approach here. Because the major MVPD competitors in most areas are the local 
cable operator and the two DBS providers, and consistent with the Commission's approach in prior license transfer proceedings, 
we find that the franchise area of the local cable operator is the relevant geographic market for purposes of this analysis."")

services directly to that consumer's home. . . . A consumer cannot purchase video programming distribution services from a

Consequently, although the set of video programming distributors able to offer service to individual consumers' residences 
generally is the same within each local community, that set differs from one local community to another and can even vary within 
a local community. The markets for video programming distribution therefore are local.""). See also In re Set-Top Cable

555,26," Dr. Singer previously applied the GRS Test in a § 2 monopoly case involving the sale of antiviral drugs. Meijer, Inc. v. Abbott 
Labs., No. C 07-5985 CW, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78219, 2008 WL 4065839, at *1, (N.D. Cal. Aug. 27, 2008). In granting the 
class certification motion, the court determined that ""Plaintiffs intend[ed] to prove the fact of injury to  [*66] the class by evidence 
that [was] predominately generalized. In addition, Dr. Singer's conclusion that class members paid more, not the same or less, 
for at least some purchases of Norvir and Kaletra following Abbott's price increases, [was] eminently plausible."" Id. at *9. 
Whether the court relied upon Dr. Singer's application of the GRS Test specifically is not known, since the court does not 
explicitly reference the GRS Test and Dr. Singer proffered other elements to determine proof of impact. (Hr'g Tr. 284 (""Q. So did 
your expert report in the Norvir case contain any other proof of impact other than the GRS test? A. There might have been other 
elements to it . . . ."").) "
556,27," At the class certification hearing on redirect, Plaintiffs' expert attempted to minimize the impact of this by stating that ""in the 
worst-case scenario, at most [he] could envision two implementations of the GRS test,"" one for markets with telcos and another 
for markets without telcos. (Hr'g Tr. 278.) Plaintiffs' insistence that such variations can be glossed over for present purposes is 
unpersuasive given that the determination of telcos' impact on cable  [*68] pricing must be made regionally. As support for his 
conclusion that telcos do not impact cable pricing, Dr. Singer cites a 2011 FCC report. (Id.) FCC reports, however, calculate 
impact with pricing data provided by cable operators at rate card prices, not limited term prices, which vary regionally and 
temporally. (Hr'g Tr. 291-92.) Accordingly, determining the impact of telcos on cable pricing would require regional analysis."
556,28," Defendant asserts that Plaintiffs' claims are barred, in whole or in part, because the complained-of conduct is regulated by the 
FCC. Crumley v. Time Warner Cable, 556 F.3d 879 (8th Cir. 2009); see Coll v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 642 F.3d 876, 890 (10th 
Cir. 2011) (""'[T]he focus for determining whether the filed rate doctrine applies is the impact the court's decision will have on 
agency procedures and rate determinations.' The dispositive question, then, is whether, if plaintiffs succeed on their damages 
claims, the court's determination will impact the agency's rate determinations. If so, the 'filed rate' doctrine will bar the claim."" 
(quoting H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., 954 F.2d 485, 489 (8th Cir. 1992))). Pursuant to FCC Form 1205, set-top box prices are 
regulated in communities where ""cable systems . . . are not subject to such  [*70] effective competition."" 47 U.S.C. § 543(b)(3); 
47 C.F.R. §§ 76.905(a), 76.910, 76.933. Plaintiffs contend that this defense is not applicable because the complained-of conduct is tying, not overcharging on set-top box 
rentals. (Pls.' Br., Dkt. No. 209, at 38-39.) But Defendant raises this defense regarding Plaintiffs' alleged antitrust impact. (Def.'s 
Br., Dkt. No. 181, at 49.) And Plaintiffs admit that if valid, determination of whether class members lived in regulated or 
nonregulated areas, or if any class member moved between the two during the relevant time period, would need to be made. 
(Pls.' Br., Dkt. No. 209, at 41 (""In the unlikely event that a class member moved to an unregulated area during the class period, 
then damages would be allowed only for the time that he or she leased a STB in an unregulated area. The only information 
relevant to this determination is the geographic location of the class members."").) But this inquiry could not be done with 
evidence common to the class, individual determinations of who lived where during the relevant time period would be required."

568,1," On September 28, 2011, this Court entered an Order substituting Bankrate, Inc., a Delaware Corporation, as successor-in-
interest to Bankrate, Inc., a Florida Corporation. (D.E. 282). "
569,2," As defined by BanxCorp, the Bank Rate Website market ""is the market for fee-based aggregated bank rate table listings with 
interactive functionalities on the Internet. It  [*5] is often referred to as the 'Internet-based consumer banking marketplace,' or, 
simply, bank rate websites (""Bank Rate Websites""). The relevant geographic market for Bank Rate Websites is the whole of the 
United States."" (4AC ¶¶ 35-36). These websites provide services and products similar to those offered by Bankrate, as 
described above. See Part I.A."
569,3," Throughout this Opinion, the Court refers to ""predatory pricing"" or ""predatory price-fixing."" ""This term has been used chiefly in 
cases in which a single firm, having a dominant share of the relevant market, cuts its prices in order to force competitors out of 
the market, or perhaps  [*6] to deter potential entrants from coming in."" Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 
475 U.S. 574, 585 n.8, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (citation omitted). HN1[
] ""In such cases, 'predatory pricing' 
means pricing below some appropriate measure of cost."" Id. (citation omitted)."
569,4," In this action and a related action, BanxCorp v. LendingTree LLC, No. 10-2467, BanxCorp alleged that in 2007, Bankrate 
""entered into an anticompetitive agreement with LendingTree, a competitor with a dominant position  [*7] in the mortgage lead 
generation and aggregation ('Mortgage Lead Aggregation') market. Defendant and Lending Tree combined, conspired to form a 
cartel, and agreed to divide and allocate revenues, Internet traffic and clicks, customers, accounts, and products in the savings 
sub-market for Bank Rate Websites, in exchange for revenues, Internet traffic and clicks in the Mortgage Lead Aggregation 
market."" (4AC ¶ 27). "
570,5," Bankrate's only reference to the New Jersey antitrust claims is the following: ""Bankrate respectfully seeks an Order, pursuant to 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), dismissing . . . the Fifth Claim for Relief (the New Jersey Antitrust Act) consistent with Counts One 
through Three."" (Def. Moving Br. at 1). Bankrate never revisits the New Jersey claims in its moving papers, and does not provide 
any guidance on whether analysis under the New Jersey statutes would be the same as under the federal statutes. In light of the 
foregoing, the Court will not address the sufficiency of the pleading as to the New Jersey claims. "
573,6," Alternatively, Bankrate also argues—for the first time in its reply brief—that BanxCorp changed its theory from unilateral 
predatory pricing-fixing in the 3AC to a predatory price-fixing conspiracy in the 4AC. (See Def. Reply Br. at 5). Because Bankrate 
raises this argument on reply, the Court declines to address it here. See Dana Transp., Inc. v. Ableco Fin., LLC, No. 04-2781, 
2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18086, at *16 (D.N.J. Aug. 17, 2005) (HN6[
] ""The purpose of the reply brief is to respond to the 
opposition brief or explain a position that the respondent  [*20] has refuted."") (citations omitted)."
573,7," The Court also notes that on April 5, 2011, Judge Arleo granted BanxCorp's motion to amend the 3AC. That order did not limit 
BanxCorp's ability to modify the claims in its 3AC or bring new claims. (See Order Granting Motion for Leave to File an Amended 
Complaint, D.E. 209). "
575,8," The Supreme Court has explained the rule of reason as follows: HN15[
] The rule of reason is the accepted standard for testing whether a practice restrains trade in violation of § 1. Under this rule, the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be 
prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition. Appropriate factors to take into account include specific 
information about the relevant business and the restraint's history, nature, and effect. Whether the businesses involved 
have market power is a further, significant consideration. In its design and function the rule distinguishes between restraints 
with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the 
consumer's best interest. Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 885-86, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (citations 
and internal quotations omitted). "
576,9," Although it briefly mentions rule of reason analysis in the alternative in the 4AC, BanxCorp argues exclusively under the per se 
rule  [*35] in its opposition brief. (See Pl. Opp. Br. at 1, 10-14) (4AC ¶ 281) (""Defendant's horizontal market allocation and 
predatory price-fixing conduct constitutes a per se violation of the Sherman Act, since the restraints are presumptively "
577,," anticompetitive due to their predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect, and limited potential for procompetitive benefit. In 
the alternative, these claims would require an analysis under the quick look approach, or at a minimum, under the rule of 
reason.""). This is a risky strategy. In re Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 319 n. 16 (acknowledging that plaintiff permanently 
abandoned its rule of reason analysis argument where it pled rule of reason in its first amended complaint but argued exclusively 
for per se analysis in the second amended complaint and moving papers). "
582,10," Based on this Court's review of the moving papers, Bankrate does not appear to be challenging the definition of the relevant 
market. Therefore, the Court accepts BanxCorp's definition of the relevant market for purposes of deciding this motion. "
584,11, See Part III.C.1 above. 
586,12," Defendant's attacks on the predatory pricing and exclusionary conduct theories are dealt with throughout this opinion and are 
not addressed here. "
591,1," In briefing on the motions to dismiss, Plaintiff moved for leave to file a sur-reply in further opposition to the motions, attaching 
 [*3] the sur-reply brief. Plaintiff's attachment of the brief was improper and Plaintiff is cautioned that, going forward, it is to obtain 
this Court's permission before filing any supplemental briefing. As such, this Court has not considered the improperly filed sur-
reply brief. The Court previously exercised its discretion to deny the motion to file the sur-reply brief. See Docket No. 48; Fenza's 
Auto, Inc. v. Montagnaro's Inc., No. 10-3336, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29696, 2011 WL 1098993, at *4 (D.N.J. Mar. 21, 
2011)(""[T]he court has broad discretion to consider supplemental briefing as appropriate and fair."")."
591,2, The allegations contained in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint are accepted as true for purposes of the motion to dismiss. 
592,3," In 2007, the Virtua Defendants, who previously lacked a Certificate of Need to perform any of the procedures at issue, were 
authorized to perform a limited number of procedures on an emergency basis."
592,4," Plaintiff submitted an email discussing a ""leakage report"" in an exhibit attached to its opposition to the motions to dismiss. 
Because the exhibit, and Plaintiff's other attachments submitted in opposition to the motion to dismiss, are consistent with the 
facts plead in the Amended Complaint, this Court may exercise its discretion to consider them without converting the motions to 
dismiss into motions for summary judgment. Help at Home, Inc. v. Medical Capital, L.L.C., 260 F.3d 748, 752-53 (7th Cir. 
2001)(""A plaintiff need not put all of the essential  [*8] facts in the complaint; he may add them by affidavit or brief in order to 
defeat a motion to dismiss if the facts are consistent with the allegations of the complaint.""(quotation and citation omitted); 
Kulwicki v. Dawson, 969 F.2d 1454, 1462 (3d Cir. 1992)(""A trial judge has the discretion to consider evidence outside the 
complaint in ruling on motions to dismiss.""). "
593,5," The Amended Complaint's pleads a Section 2 claim with respect to both the Elective and Emergency Procedures markets. 
However, in Plaintiff's motion to dismiss opposition briefing, Plaintiff solely addressed the Emergency Procedures market and, at 
oral argument, Plaintiff confirmed that its Section 2 claim was limited to the Emergency Procedures market. "
595,6," The Penn Defendants contend that the alleged coercive conduct amounts to no more than ""garden-variety business torts"" that 
do not rise to the level of antitrust claims. That some of the conduct allegedly employed by Defendants in furtherance of the 
alleged antitrust conspiracy was also tortious is immaterial to the viability of Plaintiff's antitrust claims. Tortious and 
anticompetitive conduct  [*18] are not mutually exclusive."
595,7," See also Petruzzi's IGA Supermarkets v. Darling-Delaware Co., 998 F.2d 1224, 1243 (3d Cir. 1993)(""However, we have made 
it clear that the defendants need not share the same motive. Rather, all that is required is they each have a motive to conspire.""); 
Acme Markets, Inc. v. Wharton Hardware and Supply Corp., 890 F. Supp. 1230, 1239 (D.N.J. 1995)(holding  [*21] that alleged 
co-conspirators may have ""independent motivations"" so long as they ""acted in concert to restrain competition through their "
596,," common objective of enforcing the restrictive covenant.""); In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., No. 08-md-02002, 821 F. 
Supp. 2d 709, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109641, 2011 WL 4465355, at *7 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 26, 2011(holding that even reluctant co-
conspirators may be held liable and that ""the issue is whether the pleading delineates to some sufficiently specific degree that a 
defendant purposefully joined and participated in the conspiracy."")."
596,8," Defendants argue that, in order to demonstrate competitive harm, Plaintiff  [*22] was required, and failed, to demonstrate that 
the alleged exclusionary conduct resulted in a significant market foreclosure. But market foreclosure analysis, like market power 
analysis, is merely a surrogate for a demonstration of actual anticompetitive effect. Jonathan M. Jacobson, Exclusive Dealing, 
""Foreclosure,"" And Consumer Harm, 70 ANTITRUST L.J. 311, 362 (2002). As Jonathan Jacobson, former member of the 
Congressional Antitrust Modernization Commission, persuasively writes: But just as foreclosure is no more a magic wand for plaintiffs, neither does the absence of ""substantial foreclosure"" provide 
a defense for firms whose exclusive dealing practices in fact threaten significant harm. The foreclosure concept was 
developed as a useful proxy for analyzing harm to competition. If ""substantial foreclosure"" was shown, the courts presumed 
that the competitive process had been damaged and the restraint was condemned accordingly. As the sophistication of 
antitrust analysis has increased, however, the foreclosure proxy has been found inadequate. A large amount of percentage 
foreclosure, without more, proves nothing, but the absence of percentage foreclosure is equally unilluminating.  [*23] In all 
cases, the relevant question is instead whether there has been an adverse effect on price, output, quality, choice, or 
innovation in the market as a whole. Id. As described below, Plaintiff has adequately alleged actual anticompetitive effect, obviating any need for a demonstration of 
market foreclosure."
596,9," Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot demonstrate anticompetitive effects because Plaintiff cannot show reduced output. 
However, reduced output is just one method of demonstrating anticompetitive harm. New York Medscan LLC v. New York 
University School of Medicine, 430 F. Supp. 2d 140, 146 (S.D.N.Y. 2006)(""A plaintiff asserts harm to competition by alleging 
adverse effects on the price, quality, or output of the relevant good or service."")(emphasis added); Angelico, 184 F.3d at 276 (3d 
Cir. 1999)(same). "
597,10," See Burns v. Lavender Hill Herb Farm, Inc., No. Civ.A 01-7019, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7559, 2005 WL 1006321, at *3 
(E.D.Pa. Apr. 28, 2005)(rejecting conclusory  [*26] allegations of higher prices); Process Controls Int'l, Inc. v. Emerson Process 
Mgmt., No: 4:10CV645, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9405, 2011 WL 403121, at *4 (E.D.Mo. Feb. 1, 2011)(same)."
597,11," At oral argument, the Virtua Defendants contended that there are two time-based components to ensuring proper medical care 
for these procedures: the transport time to the hospital and the time, once at the hospital, before a patient receives the proper 
treatment. They argued that the Amended Complaint alleges only that the transport time is shorter for transfer to Deborah and, 
without allegations as to wait time at Deborah, does not plausibly establish that transfer to Penn subject patients to unnecessary 
medical risks. This is an overly technical reading of the Amended Complaint. Plaintiff has, particularly in light of the historic 
practice of transferring patients to it, plausibly alleged that there are no medical issues that prevent transport to it from Virtua. It 
is a fair inference from these allegations, and the allegations that Defendants' practice subjects patients to unnecessary medical 
risk, that there is no issue with hospital waiting time at Deborah that would negate its transportation time advantage."
597,12," The Court ordered supplemental briefing on this issue. Defendants' authority submitted in response is inapposite. In Schuylkill 
Energy Resources v. Pa. Power & Light Co., 113 F.3d 405 (3d Cir. 1997), the Court rejected an energy supplier's contention that 
a utility company's failure to purchase energy from it resulted in a higher rates to consumers on two grounds. Id. at 414-15. First, 
the court found that the utility's rates were determined by regulators, not the marketplace, and therefore any complaints were 
properly directed to regulatory authorities. Id. Defendants have not identified any corresponding authority here that would make "
598,," antitrust review inappropriate Second, the plaintiff there was found to be only a supplier to the utility, not its competitor, so could 
not participate in the market for consumers. Id. at 415. Plaintiff here, in contrast, is in direct competition  [*30] with Defendants. 
In In re Canadian Imp. Antitrust Litig., 470 F.3d 785 (8th Cir. 2006), the court found that prescription drug purchasers failed to 
allege anti-competitive conduct where they alleged that drug companies acted to prevent the importation of cheaper brand name 
drugs from Canada. Id. at 791 There, unlike here, the inability to access a cheaper alternative was caused, at the start, by 
government regulations, not the Defendants' exclusionary conduct. Id. at 791-92. The plaintiffs there could not allege, as Plaintiff 
can here, ""that prior to the alleged anti-competitive conduct of the defendants"" consumers had access to the cheaper alternative. 
Id. at 792."
598,13," See Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 223, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 
(1993)(holding, in the predatory pricing context, that ""[l]ow prices benefit consumer regardless of how those prices are 
set"")(quotation and citation omitted). "
599,14," At oral argument, Plaintiff articulated its belief that it was, in fact, obligated to demonstrate a dangerous probability of 
successful monopolization. While the Court does not adopt this standard because it believes that standard is incorrect, the 
differing standards are immaterial here. The same facts, discussed below, that demonstrate the implausibility of Defendants 
having the intent to successfully monopolize,  [*34] would also render implausible Plaintiff's claim that Defendants had a 
dangerous probability of success. "
603,1, Plaintiffs do not rely on any other legal theory to argue that the statute of limitations should be tolled.
603,2," Any harm that accrues after the tolling of the statute of limitations periods but that is associated with an overt act that occurred 
prior to the limitations period is not remediable. However, ""each separate cause of action that so accrues [during the statute of 
limitations period] entitles a plaintiff to recover not only those damages which he has suffered at the date of accrual, but also 
those which he will suffer in the future from the particular invasion, including what he has suffered during and will predictably 
suffer after trial."" Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338-39, 91 S. Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971). "
606,3," Plaintiffs assert tying claims under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Courts have permitted plaintiffs to proceed on tying 
claims under Section 2 ""at least where there is monopolization or attempted monopolization,"" as is alleged in this case. See 
Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1190, 1195 n.2 (N.D. Cal. 2008). "
607,4," Plaintiffs define the relevant market for the monopolization claims as the ""market for online payment systems for use in online 
auctions."" (FAC ¶ 72.)"
607,5," Neither Plaintiffs nor Defendants have addressed the factors identified in Brown Shoe relevant to a submarket. See 370 U.S. at 
325 (""The boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public 
recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar  [*23] characteristics and uses, unique 
production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and specialized vendors.""). Because this 
issue is not adequately briefed, Defendants may renew this argument in connection with a motion for summary judgment 
summary judgment. "
608,6," Defendants rely, in part, on Kypta v. McDonald's Corp., 671 F.2d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 1982) in support of their argument that 
Plaintiffs' allegations of injury are not sufficient. However, the court in Kypta addressed whether the plaintiffs had proved antitrust 
injury on a motion for summary judgment, rather than a motion to dismiss."
608,7," The relevant market includes both a product market and a geographic market. See Newcal Indus. v. Ikon Office Solution, 513 
F.3d 1038, 1045 n.4 (9th Cir. 2008).  [*27] Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts to define the 
relevant geographic market. "
609,8," Some courts have found that it is unclear whether California law recognizes a claim for ""unjust enrichment""  [*29] as a separate 
claim and have chosen to allow a claim for unjust enrichment. See, e.g., Nordberg v. Trilegiant Corp., 445 F. Supp. 2d 1082, 
1100 (N.D. Cal. 2006). However, this Court believes the better course is to allow Plaintiffs to pursue recovery for unjust 
enrichment under other theories of liability. "
612,1," For the sake of simplicity, our opinion refers to Visa U.S.A. and its affiliated parties collectively as Visa. Nonetheless, we have 
retained the Second Circuit's references to Visa U.S.A. in the portions of its opinion quoted here. "
613,2," The rules described in the quoted text, precluding members of the Visa and MasterCard  [*7] networks from issuing cards 
affiliated with other networks, are those referred to in this opinion as the exclusion policies. "
617,3," Except where it is necessary to distinguish among objectors Attridge, Selvaggio, Metzger, and Salveson, we will refer to them 
collectively as appellants. In this court, Selvaggio and Metzger have filed joint appellants' briefs, and Attridge and Salveson have 
each filed their own appellant's briefs. "
620,4," As the Second Circuit recently pointed out in reversing an order approving a class action settlement, the fact that some class 
representatives have the same claims as those belonging to the objecting plaintiff class does not necessarily mean that the 
representatives will fairly and adequately represent the interest of all class members. (Literary Works in Elec. Databases 
Copyright Litig. (2d Cir. 2011) 654 F.3d 242, 251-255.) The court reasoned that when a class action covering more than one 
type of claim is settled, the ""named plaintiffs . . . [are] obligated to advance the collective interests of the class, rather than those 
of the subset of class members whose claims mirror[] their own."" (Id. at p. 252.) Thus, the court held that even where ""class 
members can and do hold claims in [multiple] categories"" (id. at p. 251), subclasses for each type of claim should be created, in 
order to ensure adequate representation in the settlement negotiations of those class members who hold only one type of claim. 
(Id. at pp. 251-257.) "
621,5," Respondents argue that it was proper for the release to include the Attridge claims, and they do not contend that those claims 
fall outside its intended scope. At oral argument in this court, counsel for Visa confirmed Visa's position that the release includes 
the Attridge claims."
621,6," On June 10, 2011, class counsel requested that this court take judicial notice of four class action settlements approved by other 
courts, in cases not substantively related to this one,  [*36] after the judgment was entered in the trial court in the present case. 
Class counsel has not established that any of these other settlements implicate the issue that appellants raise here, i.e., that the 
settlements included a release of claims asserted in a different, concurrently pending case, and were approved over the 
objections of persons representing putative class members in that other case. For that reason, the request for judicial notice is 
denied, on the ground of lack of relevance. "
623,7," Because we are reversing the judgment approving the settlement, this case will proceed to trial unless the parties agree to 
revise the settlement agreement and resubmit it for court approval. Thus, we need not address appellants'  [*44] other 
challenges to the fairness of the existing settlement agreement. To the extent appellants may have similar objections to the 
terms of any future settlement agreement that are similar to the ones raised here and not addressed in this opinion, they remain 
free to assert those objections in the course of the proceedings for court approval. "
653,1," Claim 1 is brought on behalf of Class 1 (coin grading companies not authorized under the Certification Policy), Class 2 
(companies and individuals who purchased coins graded by one of eBay's five authorized graders), and Class 3 (coin sellers 
who are in possession of coin inventories graded by companies other than one of the five authorized under the Certification 
Policy). "
654,2," The court takes notice of the Certification Policy, which was attached as an exhibit to a declaration accompanying the motion to 
dismiss, under the incorporation by reference doctrine. See United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003) (""Even if 
a document is not attached to a complaint, it may be incorporated by reference into a complaint if the plaintiff refers extensively 
to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff's claim.""). "
655,3," Plaintiffs attempt to exaggerate the impact of eBay's conduct by alleging that the ""broad based"" rare coin index demonstrated a 
""sharp increase"" in rare coin prices around the time the Certification Policy was adopted. FAC ¶ 171. However, plaintiffs do not 
allege, nor does the court believe they could show, that any increase in the price of rare coins is the result of the Certification 
Policy rather than other factors. See Bhan v. NME Hospitals, Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1413 (9th Cir. 1991) (noting that the plaintiff 
must show ""the restraint has actually produced significant anti-competitive effects"")."
655,4," Claim 2 is brought on behalf of Class 1 (coin grading companies not authorized under the eBay Policy), Class 2 (companies 
and individuals who purchased coins graded by eBay's five authorized graders), and Class 3 (coin sellers who are in possession 
of coin inventories graded by companies other than the five authorized under the eBay Policy). "
656,5," Plaintiffs' Section 2 claims are brought on behalf of Class 5 (all companies and individuals who have bought and/or sold coins 
on eBay and have paid higher commissions to eBay as a result of the Certification Policy). "
657,6," Claims 5, 6 and 7 are brought on behalf of Class 1 (coin grading companies not authorized under the Certification Policy), 
Class 2 (companies and individuals who purchased coins graded by one of eBay's five authorized graders), Class 3 (coin sellers 
who are in possession of coin inventories graded by companies other than one of the five authorized under the Certification 
Policy), and Class 4 (; (4) companies and individuals who attempted to list coins as ""certified"" which had been graded by non-
authorized grading services and whose listings were removed by eBay for violating the Certification Policy). "
658,7," Claim 8 is brought on behalf of Class 1 (coin grading companies not authorized under the Certification Policy). Claim 9 is 
brought on behalf of Class 3 (coin sellers who are in possession of coin inventories graded by companies other than one of the 
five authorized under the Certification Policy), and Class 4 (companies and individuals who attempted to list coins as ""certified"" 
which had been graded by non-authorized grading services and whose listings were removed by eBay for violating the 
Certification Policy). "

666,4," Unless otherwise noted, all further statutory ""section"" references will be to the California Labor Code. "
669,5," F.R.Civ.P. 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to state law causes of action: ""[W]hile a federal court will examine state law to 
determine whether the elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of action, the Rule 9(b) requirement that 
the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity is a federally imposed rule."" Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. USA, 317 
F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1995)(italics in original))."
669,6," ""In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the 
basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be 'grounded in fraud' or to 'sound in fraud,' and the pleading of that claim as a 
whole must satisfy the particularity  [*21] requirement of Rule 9(b)."" Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103-1104. "
670,7," The complaint purports to allege a claim under Tameny v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 27 Cal.3d 167, 172, 164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 842, 
610 P.2d 1330 (1980) (""an employer's traditional authority to discharge an at-will employee may be limited by statute . . . or by 
considerations of public policy""). There can be no right to terminate for an unlawful reason or purpose that contravenes 
fundamental public policy. Silo v. CHW Med. Found., 27 Cal. 4th 1097, 1104, 119 Cal. Rptr. 2d 698, 703, 45 P.3d 1162 (2002). 
""It is settled that an employer's discharge of an employee in violation of a fundamental public policy embodied in a constitutional

689,2," At trial, Marco Antonio Sanchez described the Sanchez family business as a medium-size media company in Mexico. In late 
1977, the Sanchez family acquired EC, known at that time as Caballero Con Le Mejor de Playboy. Marco's father, Javier

689,3," The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals recently granted petition  [**11] in In re McQuarrie, without oral argument, on the 
following issue: Did the court of appeals violate McQuarrie's federal and state constitutional right to confrontation and cross-
examination by upholding the trial court's exclusion, pursuant to Texas Rule of Evidence 606(b), of juror testimony and affidavits 
offered for purposes of his motion for new trial on the ground that a juror conveyed to other jurors harmful information obtained 
from her internet research during an overnight break in deliberations? No. PD-0803-11, 2011 Tex. Crim. App. LEXIS 1517, at *1 
(Tex. Crim. App. Nov. 16, 2011). "
692,4," Although EC and GSI title their second issue a ""factually insufficient and/or against the overwhelming weight of the evidence"" 
issue, factual sufficiency is not raised in the body of their brief. Rather, the substance of this issue is based only on legal 
sufficiency principles, and we will review the second issue accordingly. Compare HN11[
] Tex. R. App. P. 47.1 (""The court of appeals must hand down a written opinion that is as brief as practicable but that addresses every issue raised and necessary to 
final disposition of the appeal.""), and Martinez v. El Paso County, 218 S.W.3d 841, 844 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2007, pet. dism'd) 
(""When reviewing a civil matter, an appellate court has no discretion to consider an issue not raised in the appellant's brief.""), 
with Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(f) (""The statement of an issue or point will be treated as covering every subsidiary  [**21] question that 
is fairly included.""), and Hagberg v. City of Pasadena, 224 S.W.3d 477, 480 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.) 
(providing that even though a specific point may not be recited within a statement of issues presented, that point is not waived if 
raised within the body of the brief). Nonetheless, to the extent the second issue could be construed as a challenge to the factual 
sufficiency of the evidence, under the proper standard of review we would further conclude that the adverse findings were not 
against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. See Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001) 
(per curiam). "
693,5," Hugh Hefner sent a December 9, 1996 memo to Christie Hefner, among others, reiterating that he did not want a second 
language version competing with Playboy in the United States and explaining that ""[w]ith the acquisition of the Mexican Playboy 
by a U.S. firm, it is important to make clear that the editorial focus and distribution of this Spanish language version of  [**23] the 
magazine remain essentially Mexican."" In his February 4, 1997 memo to Henry Marks, after setting out that he had no problem 
with a direct Spanish translation if they owned the magazine, Heftner continued, ""But I have already rejected the idea of a 
separate Spanish language edition of PLAYBOY in the U.S. as being too confusing. And I am even more opposed to allowing 
some outside company [to] own and distribute a Spanish edition (Mexican or other) here in the U.S."" Finally, Hefner's February 
7, 1997 memo sent to Christie Hefner expressed the following: ""I think it is naive to assume that distributing 100,000 copies of a 
Mexican edition of PLAYBOY in the United States won't have some impact on the newsstand sales of the U.S. edition when our 
own single copy sales are often no more than 500,000."" "
695,6," Fernando Peramo, EC and GSI's editor-in-chief  [**30] for the Mexican Playboy magazine, described the media kit as a 
""presentation of what we send advertisers."""
695,7," As part of Question 1A, the failure-to-comply question, the trial court included the following instruction: The [c]ourt instructs you the License Agreement includes an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing. This ensures parties 
do not take advantage in a way that could not have been contemplated at the time the contract was drafted or do anything 
that would destroy the other party's right to receive the benefit of the contract. Accordingly, a party with absolute discretion 
under a contract  [**33] must exercise such discretion in a manner consistent with the reasonable expectations of the other 
party. Whenever the cooperation of one party is necessary for the other party's performance, there is an implied condition 
that such cooperation will be given. "
696,8," The trial court applied Illinois law to the License Agreement based on a choice-of-law provision contained in that agreement. 
The trial court also ruled that a duty of good faith and fair dealing existed under Illinois law. Because PEI contends that the trial 
court improperly imposed a duty of good faith in this case, for the purposes of this analysis we will only assume, without 
deciding, that such a duty exists under Illinois  [**35] law. "
698,9," Section 15.05(a) of the Texas Free Enterprise and Antitrust Act ""adopted the language of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act."" 
Red Wing Shoe Co., Inc. v. Shearer's Inc., 769 S.W.2d 339, 343 (Tex. App—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ). "
699,10," PEI also asserts that there are other bases to deny recovery on this antitrust claim, including (1) EC and GSI do not have 
standing; (2) they failed to establish the relevant product and geographic market; and (3) they failed to establish any injury to 
their business in Texas. Because of the disposition of this issue, however, we need not address PEI's remaining responsive 
assertions. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1. "
700,11," Question 15 asked whether EC and/or GSI failed to comply with the License Agreement, and Question 18 asked whether EC 
and/or GSI failed to comply with the Renegotiated Payment Plan Agreement. To each question, the jury answered ""Yes"" for EC 
and ""Yes"" for GSI. "
701,12," Question 16 asked if EC and/or GSI's failure to comply with the License Agreement was excused, and Question 19 asked if 
EC and/or GSI's failure to comply with the Renegotiated Payment  [**53] Plan Agreement was excused. To each question, the 
jury answered ""No"" for EC and ""No"" for GSI. "
712,1," Excluded from the proposed class were ""those who solely paid fixed amount co-pays, uninsureds who did not pay their bill, 
Medicaid and Traditional Medicare patients, governmental entities, [Northshore itself], other providers of healthcare services, 
and the present and former parents, predecessors, subsidiaries, and affiliates of [Northshore] and other providers of healthcare 
services."" "
713,2," The district court did not consider whether plaintiffs had satisfied Rule 23(b)(3)'s additional requirement that ""a class action 
 [**11] is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy."" Evanston Northwestern 
Healthcare, 268 F.R.D. at 87 n.32. "
714,3," Northshore argues that plaintiffs moved to strike only Noether's initial report, not her later testimony and supplemental report, 
thereby waiving any argument to exclude those materials. We disagree. Plaintiffs moved to strike Noether's expert report and 
also explicitly requested that ""her opinion . . . be stricken as a whole,"" App. 1261, in part because Noether lacked expertise 
regarding antitrust issues affecting ""consumers of healthcare plans."" App. 1264. Plaintiffs renewed that objection at the start of 
the hearing on class certification, Dkt. 418 at 5, and objected when Noether offered new information during that hearing in 
response to Dranove' rebuttal report, id. at 67-68, 94-95. The district court repeatedly put off dealing with the substance of these 
objections. Id. at 5, 69, 95. Plaintiffs' objections gave the district court and defendant ample opportunity to address the issues. 
Where the district court repeatedly put off dealing with the issues, plaintiffs  [**15] did not need to renew their unsuccessful 
objection every time the same witness attempted to provide additional information."
714,4," We issued American Honda one day after the district court here issued its initial decision denying class certification. The 
redacted version of the district court's decision available to the public was released some time later, after our decision in 
American Honda. "
715,5," Rule 23(b)(3) also conditions class certification on whether the class action device is superior to other available methods for 
fairly and efficiently resolving the dispute in question. We need not consider whether plaintiffs have shown superiority in this 
case, as this issue was neither considered by the district court nor raised by either party on appeal. There are so many common 
issues of law and fact relating to the issue of Northshore's liability, however, that the superiority requirement  [**23] likely poses 
no serious obstacle to class certification here. See Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 1241, 1269 (11th Cir. 2004) (finding 
superiority under Rule 23(b)(3) and noting that ""the more common issues predominate over individual issues, the more desirable 
a class action lawsuit will be as a vehicle for adjudicating the plaintiffs' claims""). And this case, at least on its face, implicates "
716,," none of the specific concerns that we have previously said will prevent a finding of superiority. See, e.g., Harper v. Sheriff of 
Cook County, 581 F.3d 511, 516 (7th Cir. 2009) (finding no superiority where plaintiff's challenge to defendant's allegedly illegal 
jail management practices ""can be satisfied in an individual suit without the management issues of a class action""); Andrews v. 
Chevy Chase Bank, 545 F.3d 570, 577 (7th Cir. 2008) (finding no superiority where class action seeking rescission of home 
mortgages would require a ""multitude"" of ""individual rescission procedures""). "
718,6," The published opinion refers to ""Payor A"" because much of the relevant pricing and contractual evidence was subject to a 
protective order."
718,7," The district court and Noether appear to have believed that escalator clauses — increasing contract prices during a long-term 
contract — can never reflect the exercise of market power because they take effect long after contract negotiations have 
concluded. This is not correct. The fact that an escalator clause may be triggered months or even years after contract 
negotiations occurred does not necessarily mean that the escalator clause was  [**33] immune from one contracting party's 
exercise of market power. Like the initial prices set in the contracts, the terms of the escalator clauses — the services to which 
those clauses would apply, the frequency of any price increases, and the magnitude of those price increases — were the 
products of the negotiations between the parties to those contracts. A firm may use market power to ensure that those 
negotiations result in an initial contract price higher than it might have otherwise been able to obtain. We see no general reason 
such a firm could not also use that market power to obtain escalator clauses more generous than would have been possible 
otherwise. "
721,8," The categories of inpatient services  [**45] were general inpatient care, intensive care, vaginal delivery, C-section, boarder 
baby, psychiatric/substance abuse care, telemetry/PCU, and skilled nursing."
721,9," The two categories of outpatient services that stayed the same were ambulatory surgery and ""other outpatient services,"" which 
included emergency room services. The third category was cardiac catheterization."
721,10," The district court expressed serious doubt that all nominally non-uniform price increases were actually uniform price increases 
that only appeared non-uniform because of behind-the-scenes restructuring. Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, 268 F.R.D. at 
86 n.31. Because such uniformity was as unnecessary under Rule 23(b)(3) as it was to Dranove's DID analysis, our analysis 
remains the same regardless of whether the district court's doubts were well-founded. It appears that the difference of opinion on 
this point may have stemmed from an ambiguity in how the experts and the parties were using the term ""restructure"" to deal with 
some non-uniformity in nominal prices. "
722,11," The ALJ observed during the FTC proceedings that this was likely because Blue Cross ""had a very strong bargaining position 
against [Northshore]"" and had ""power to limit [Northshore's] price increases,"" and did not ""undermine the conclusion that 
[Northshore] gained market power through the merger. In re Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Corp., 2005 FTC LEXIS 146, 
2005 WL 2845790, at *138 (F.T.C. 2005). On review, the FTC declined to address this ""sticky and unsettled issue[ ]"" because 
""the record demonstrates that the merger likely gave [Northshore] sufficient market power to increase the average price that it 
charged to all [insurers]."" 2007 FTC LEXIS 210, 2007 WL 2286195, at *52. We express no opinion on this matter, which, for the 
same reasons we explain below, is an issue beyond the scope of class certification."
722,12," Northshore's reasons for making this latter argument are evident but misguided: the third parties to whom those costs were 
passed on by members of plaintiffs' proposed class lack federal antitrust standing  [**49] under the ""indirect purchaser"" rule. See 
Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). But under Illinois Brick, HN16[
] the ability of 
a direct purchaser to pass on higher costs to others does not undermine its ability to sue under the Clayton Act. BCS Services, 
Inc. v. Heartwood 88, LLC, 637 F.3d 750, 756 (7th Cir. 2011) (""antitrust violators are not allowed to offset against their liability 
the amount of loss that the direct purchasers . . . who are allowed to sue, were able to pass on""). "
723,13," This discussion may prove wholly academic. Blue Cross has indicated that it does not wish to participate in any class action 
against Northshore, App. 723, so if a class is certified, it will opt out as is its right under Rule 23(b)(3). In light of Dranove's 
analysis indicating that Blue Cross and its policyholders suffered losses of $110 million as a result of the merger, however, Blue 
Cross probably would be within its rights if it chose to rethink its position."
723,14," Northshore failed to appreciate this distinction, which is why it erroneously included all of these individuals in a single 
argument concerning overbreadth. "
724,15," HN24[
] In circumstances such as these, involving minor overbreadth problems that do not call into question the validity of 
the class as a whole, the better course is not to deny class certification entirely but to amend the class definition as needed to 
correct for the overbreadth. Cf. Washington v. Walker, 734 F.2d 1237, 1240 (7th Cir. 1984) (noting  [**59] that district court 
conditioned grant of certification on plaintiff's redefinition of class). The district court is free to address this issue as it sees fit 
after remand. "
735,1," The six individual plaintiffs, none of whom wish to join, pay dues or be required to support the political activities of the local 
electrical workers union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, are Jose L. Gonzalez, Jose  [***8] G. Maldonado, 
Dan Czyzewski, Bradley Wheaton, Craig Busca and Sean Smith."
735,2, The two Hartford schools are Capital Preparatory Magnet School and Annie Fisher Magnet School.
735,3," The city imposed the specifications and enforced the PLA requirement against ECI in rejecting its low bids. Morganti Group, 
Inc., and Downes Construction Company, LLC, served as the city's construction managers on the projects. "
736,," We refer to the city, Morganti Group, Inc., Downes Construction Company, LLC, and Custom Electric, Inc., collectively as the 
nonstate defendants."
736,4," We refer to the department and McQuillan collectively as the state defendants. Dicin Electric Company also was named as a defendant. The plaintiffs, however, subsequently withdrew their claims against 
Dicin Electric Company."
736,5, The state provided 90 percent of the financing for the school construction projects.
736,6," The federal preemption claim is raised by the nonstate defendants. The sovereign immunity claim is raised by the state 
defendants."
736,7," See Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 176 (describing PLA in that case as prehire 
agreement signed by construction manager, local unions and contractors for purpose of enhancing timely completion of project 
without interruption or delay through establishment of framework for labor-management cooperation and stability, with terms 
remaining in full force and effect throughout project, contractors agreeing to abide by collective bargaining agreements of trade 
unions, including making contributions to employee benefit trust funds and recognizing trade unions as sole collective bargaining 
 [***10] representatives of employees working on project, and unions agreeing not to engage in any strike, slowdown or other 
disruption of work, but not requiring all project workers to be members of union); cf. New York State Chapter, Inc., Associated 
General Contractors of America v. New York State Thruway Authority, 88 N.Y.2d 56, 65, 666 N.E.2d 185, 643 N.Y.S.2d 480 
(1996) (""[A] PLA is a prebid contract between a construction project owner and a labor union [or unions] establishing the union 
as the collective bargaining representative for all persons who will perform work on the project. The PLA provides that only 
contractors and subcontractors who sign a prenegotiated agreement with the union can perform project work. A PLA thus 
generally requires all bidders on the project to hire workers through the union hiring halls; follow specified dispute resolution 
procedures; comply with union wage, benefit, seniority, apprenticeship and other rules; and contribute to the union benefit funds. 
In return for a project owner's promise to insist in its specifications that all successful bidders agree to be covered by a PLA, the 
union promises labor peace through the life of the contract . . . ."" [Citation  [***11] omitted.])."
736,8," The challenged PLAs in the present case, which are described in detail in paragraphs twenty-eight through thirty-six of the 
plaintiffs' second amended complaint, required that the successful bidder on each project ""draw all of its field labor through 
referrals from a designated trade union, or that its [nonunion] employees must first join a designated trade union, as a 
prerequisite to executing a contract and performing the subject work."" The PLAs also required, inter alia, that the successful 
bidder (1) abide by the ""'Project Work Rules for the Greater Hartford-New Britain Building and Construction Trade Council and 
its affiliated [u]nions and the [c]ity of Hartford, Hartford Public Schools Construction, Renovations and Additions Program' dated 
[April 14, 2004],"" (2) ensure that all of its field employees working on each project remain members in good standing of the 
relevant union during the term of the applicable PLA, (3) agree to participate in a ""Labor Management Cooperative Committee"" 
and ""submit to and comply with all rulings promulgated by [that committee and by] the PLA's Joint Administrative Council,"" (4) 
pay wages and fringe benefits to all workers on the project  [***12] in accordance with the prevailing union scale, (5) recognize 
the building trades council and its affiliated local unions as the sole and exclusive bargaining representatives for building trades "
737,," mechanics and laborers employed on the projects and covered by their respective PLAs, (6) pay any person referred by the 
union whom it rejected for work on the project, as was its right, for ""'reporting time'"" even though the rejected person had 
performed no work on the project, and (7) deduct union dues from each field employee's pay and send it to the union on a 
monthly basis."
737,9," The trial court described the requested relief as follows: ""In particular, [the plaintiffs sought] (1) [a declaration] that the 
imposition of mandatory PLAs, by or on behalf of the city, on projects approved and funded by the state defendants is illegal and 
improper insofar as  [***13] PLAs restrict the performance of work on the projects, in whole or in part, to union member 
employees, union-referred employees, union contractors or PLA signatory contractors, (2) a [declaration] that the imposition of a 
mandatory PLA, by or on behalf of a public owner, that restricts the performance of work to union member employees, union-
referred employees, union contractors or PLA signatory contractors for any municipal school construction project that is funded, 
in whole or in part, with state funds, [under] . . . § 10-287, is illegal, (3) [a declaration] that ECI's bids on the two projects were the 
lowest qualified responsible bids, and thus that the city's rejection of those bids, based upon ECI's refusal to agree to PLAs, was 
illegal and improper, (4) writs of mandamus ordering the city to award and execute contracts for the electrical work on each of 
the two projects to ECI, (5) an injunction ordering the city and its construction managers not to execute any contract to perform 
electrical work on either of the two projects with any other contractor than ECI, (6) an injunction ordering the state defendants 
not to provide any funds in furtherance of the work on the two projects  [***14] by any other electrical contractor than ECI, (7) a 
writ of mandamus ordering the state defendants to withhold funds in furtherance of the work on the two projects by any electrical 
contractor other than ECI, and (8) a writ of mandamus ordering the state defendants to withhold any funds in furtherance of work 
performed on any school construction project that is funded, in whole or in part, with state funds, [pursuant to] . . . § 10-287, for 
which a mandatory PLA of the type . . . at issue has been imposed. In addition to the foregoing, the plaintiffs [sought] the 
following types of monetary relief: (1) from the . . . city, damages under General Statutes § 35-34 for ECI's lost profits and bid 
preparation costs on the two projects and for the individual plaintiffs' lost wages and benefits, plus treble damages, reasonable 
attorney's fees and costs under . . . § 35-35, and (2) from all but the state defendants, such other monetary relief as is allowable 
by law, including but not limited to lost profits, bid preparation costs, reasonable attorney's fees and costs."""
737,10," These included the motion to dismiss, dated March 27, 2009, filed by the city, Downes Construction Company, LLC, and 
Morganti Group, Inc., the motion to dismiss, dated March 27, 2009, filed by Dicin Electric Company and Custom Electric, Inc., 
and the motion to dismiss, dated April 17, 2009, filed by the department before McQuillan was joined as a  [***16] defendant on 
June 15, 2009. Two separate stipulations of facts, one entered into by the city and the plaintiffs and another entered into by the 
department and the plaintiffs also were filed with the United States District Court on February 27, 2009, in connection with this

740,14," We note that one of the plaintiffs in Associated Builders & Contractors was ECI. See Connecticut Associated Builders & 
Contractors v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 171. "
742,15," The trial court concluded, on the basis of Associated Builders & Contractors, that (1) ""a differential cost impact on union and 
nonunion contractors . . . affords the latter no basis for challenging [a PLA] requirement"" and, therefore, ""an unsuccessful bidder 
. . . lacks standing to complain of it . . . in a court of law,"" (2) ""the ultimate issue to be decided on any proper bid challenge is 
whether the public authority gave fair and evenhanded consideration to each bidder instead of treating different bidders 
differently,"" (3) the common-law principle denying  [***33] standing to disappointed bidders remains intact unless abrogated by a 
statute that expressly confers standing, (4) Connecticut's competitive bidding statutes on their face do not identify overall project 
cost for special protection, (5) the prequalification statute, § 4a-100, which was enacted subsequent to Associated Builders & 
Contractors, does not ""occup[y] the field"" or preempt public officials from exercising their discretion and imposing other, or 
different, bid specifications, such as PLAs, as a precondition for the award of contracts on public works projects, and neither do 
any other related statutes; see General Statutes §§ 4b-91, 4b-92 and 10-287; and (6) there was no evidence that the use of 
PLAs for the projects in the present case was the result of fraud, corruption or favoritism."
742,16," ""[D]ictum is an observation or remark made by a judge in pronouncing an opinion upon a cause, concerning some rule, 
principle, or application of law, or the solution of a question suggested by the case at bar, but not necessarily involved in the 
case or essential to its determination . . . . Statements and comments in an opinion concerning some rule of law or legal 
proposition not necessarily involved nor essential to determination of the case . . . are obiter dicta, and lack the force of an 
adjudication."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Courchesne, 296 Conn. 622, 738 n.79, 998 A.2d 1 (2010). Justice  [***36] Harper's assertion, in his concurrence and dissent, that the court's analysis under the second part of the test did 
not constitute dictum disregards our well established precedent and flies in the face of the court's own reasoning. The court 
made absolutely clear that it did not regard both parts of the test as threshold jurisdictional requirements when it referred to the 
first part of the test as its ""foundational element""; Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 
186; and further explained that, even if that part of the test had been satisfied, the association ""still"" could not prevail under the 
second part of the test. Id., 187. Moreover, to the extent Justice Harper cites twelve other cases as ""weighty authority"" for the 
proposition that the two parts of the test serve as independent grounds to support a judgment on standing, all but one are 
unpersuasive because they are from other jurisdictions, and the remaining Connecticut case lacks the dispositive language in 
Associated Builders & Contractors describing the first part of the test that was applied in that case as a threshold requirement. "
743,17," The trial court in the present case heard argument by counsel but took no testimony on all challenges the parties had claimed 
for a hearing on July 3, 2009. The parties also agreed that all documents and materials filed by either side could be considered 
parts of the evidentiary record on which to decide the issues presented on the pending motions. This included documentation 
the parties previously had filed in federal court, including their briefs, stipulations of fact and supporting and supplemental 
affidavits. Although the parties raise no issues pertaining to the hearing in this case, we note that such a hearing is not typically required or 
held when the court is considering a motion to dismiss. As we explained in Conboy v. State, 292 Conn. 642, 974 A.2d 669 
(2009), HN9[
] trial courts addressing motions to dismiss  [***40] for lack of subject matter jurisdiction apply different rules and 
procedures depending on the state of the record at the time the motion is filed: ""When a trial court decides a jurisdictional 
question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss on the basis of the complaint alone, it must consider the allegations of the 
complaint in their most favorable light. . . . In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, 
including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. . . . ""In contrast, if the complaint is supplemented by undisputed facts established by affidavits submitted in support of the motion to 
dismiss . . . other types of undisputed evidence . . . and/or public records of which judicial notice may be taken . . . the trial court, 
in determining the jurisdictional issue, may consider these supplementary undisputed facts and need not conclusively presume 
the validity of the allegations of the complaint. . . . HN10[
] If affidavits and/or other evidence submitted in support of a 
defendant's motion to dismiss conclusively establish that jurisdiction is lacking, and the plaintiff fails to undermine  [***41] this 
conclusion with counteraffidavits . . . or other evidence, the trial court may dismiss the action without further proceedings. . . . If, 
however, the defendant submits either no proof to rebut the plaintiffs jurisdictional allegations . . . or only evidence that fails to 
call those allegations into question . . . the plaintiff need not supply counteraffidavits or other evidence to support the complaint . 
. . but may rest on the jurisdictional allegations therein. . . . ""Finally, HN11[
] [when] a jurisdictional determination is dependent on the resolution of a critical factual dispute, it cannot be 
decided on a motion to dismiss in the absence of an evidentiary hearing to establish jurisdictional facts. . . . Likewise, if the 
question of jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits of the case, a court cannot resolve the jurisdictional question without a 
hearing to evaluate those merits. . . . An evidentiary hearing is necessary because a court cannot make a critical factual 
[jurisdictional] finding based on memoranda and documents submitted by the parties."" (Citations omitted; internal quotation 
marks omitted.) Id., 651-54. To the extent this court stated in Associated Builders &  [***42] Contractors that ""the trial court was required to conduct an 
evidentiary hearing to decide whether the plaintiffs had established a colorable claim that the [PLA] requirement had undermined 
the integrity or objective of the competitive bidding process""; (emphasis added) Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors 
v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 182; or declared in the companion case of Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. 
Anson, 251 Conn. 202, 740 A.2d 804 (1999), that ""the evidentiary showing for standing . . . was [the association's] burden to 
make""; id., 214; we now clarify that, HN12[
] in most cases involving competitive bidding on public contracts, the allegations 
alone should provide a sufficient factual basis for deciding the jurisdictional issue of whether the plaintiff made a colorable claim 
of injury. Because the parties in the present case agreed, however, that the trial court could consider the materials and 
documents they had filed in federal court, all future references to the record in this case include that documentation as well as 
the facts alleged in the complaint. "

746,19," We nonetheless agree with Associated Builders & Contractors that HN15[
] ""cost alone"" may not always be ""the 
determinative factor"" in awarding a public construction contract. Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. Hartford, 
supra, 251 Conn. 187-88."
746,20," Justice Harper asserts that ""[t]he majority's approach to cost appears to conflate two distinct levels of cost consideration,"" 
specifically, project costs associated with items such as the building's location and size, construction materials, remediation 
activities and time to completion, and the cost of the  [***54] project as determined by the winning bid in the competitive bidding 
process. Footnote 4 of the concurring and dissenting opinion. Thus, Justice Harper essentially contends that, because the PLA 
requirement is a bid specification, it cannot be challenged under the competitive bidding statutes or Connecticut precedent as 
effectuating fraud, corruption, favoritism or acts undermining the objective or integrity of the bidding process. See id. Justice 
Harper, however, ignores our holding in Unisys Corp. v. Dept. of Labor, 220 Conn. 689, 694-95, 600 A.2d 1019 (1991), that 
HN16[
] ""a plaintiff who ha[s] not submitted a proposal on a public project ha[s] standing to challenge a specification contained 
in the bid documents if that specification preclude[s] the plaintiff's participation in a manner that impair[s] the fairness of the 
bidding process."" (Emphasis added.) Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 180. 
Likewise, Justice Harper ignores the fact that Associated Builders & Contractors, which cited Unisys Corp. with approval; see id.; 
did not reject the association's claim because it was an improper challenge to the bidding specifications but because the 
association  [***55] had failed to make a ""colorable factual showing,"" through allegations or other evidence, that ""limiting the 
number of potential bidders violates not only the integrity of competitive bidding but also injures the general public by driving up 
the cost of government funded projects."" Id., 187. To the extent Justice Harper suggests otherwise, we emphasize that 
Associated Builders & Contractors did not preclude any future claim that a bid specification with substantial cost effects on a "
747,," large group of potential bidders violates the competitive bidding statutes, which were enacted for the public benefit ""to secure the 
best product at the lowest price""; Spiniello Construction Co. v. Manchester, 189 Conn. 539, 543, 456 A.2d 1199 (1983); and the 
decision in Associated Builders & Contractors is not dispositive of ECI's claim that the PLA bid specification affects the fairness 
and integrity of the bidding process by imposing additional costs solely on bidders who are not union members."
747,21," The court stated, with respect to this issue: ""The plaintiffs argue that the trial court's analysis of standing was improper 
because it reached the merits of the plaintiffs' claims in evaluating whether the [defendant's] decision to use a [PLA] was a 
proper exercise of its discretion. We disagree. ""The plaintiffs observe . . . that standing concerns . . . the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the 
complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in 
question and does not involve an inquiry into the merits of the claim. According to the plaintiffs, whether adoption of the [PLA] 
requirement was within the [defendant's] discretion was a question separate and apart from the question of their standing to 
challenge  [***59] the [defendant's] action. ""The general rule of standing cited by the plaintiffs is not contested. As the trial court noted, however, that rule is not inconsistent 
with the particular standard applicable to disappointed and would-be bidders: By requiring [the association] to produce evidence 
that the bidding process was undermined by fraud, corruption or favoritism, the court is simply forcing the party challenging the 
competitive bidding process to make a colorable claim of injury that it is within the zone of interests protected by the competitive 
bidding laws . . . . Although the plaintiffs were not required to prove the merits of their claim, they did have the lesser burden of 
establishing a colorable claim. See Maloney v. Pac, [183 Conn. 313, 321, 439 A.2d 349 (1981)]. . . . The trial court's 
determination that the decision to adhere to a [PLA] was within the [defendant's] discretion and the bounds of the competitive 
bidding statutes, therefore, did not exceed the limits of our case law."" (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation 
marks omitted.) Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 181-82."
747,22," In Anson, the court summarized the  [***60] trial court's reasoning in granting the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' 
claim that the PLA requirement in the bid specifications infringed on the plaintiffs' rights of free speech and association as 
follows: ""The [trial] court . . . stated that inclusion of a [PLA] requirement in the project specifications was justified by the 
legitimate public interest in completion of a public works project within time and financial constraints. The nonstrike clause 
contained in [PLAs] would further that interest. The [defendant's] decision to use a [PLA] was not based on any improper motive. 
The court determined that [t]he state has a legitimate interest in completing a public works project within time and financial 
constraints. Evidence showed that the commissioner decided to use the [PLA] on this project based on knowledge of the use of 
[PLAs] by other public entities. The plaintiffs did not present any evidence that the [PLA] was a means to exclude nonunion 
contractors or amounted to such an exclusion. The purpose of the competitive bidding statutes is not to aid the contractors by 
making it economically feasible for all to bid . . . but to promote the public interest in the efficient  [***61] completion of public 
works projects. . . . The state's interest in its own finances when undertaking public works projects takes precedence over the 
finances or business methods of individual contractors. . . . The [defendant's] decision to try a [PLA] on this project was a 
legitimate exercise of his discretion to find a way to achieve the state's goal while remaining within the bounds of the competitive 
bidding statutes. . . . ""It is impossible to reconcile these findings with any conclusion other than that the association failed to establish that the use of a 
[PLA], under the circumstances of [the] case, constituted an infringement of the constitutional rights of its members. The 
constitution is not violated simply because a public agency adopts a legitimate public policy that runs counter to the philosophical 
views or business practices espoused by the membership of the association. The association did not make the evidentiary 
showing for standing that was its burden to make."" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Connecticut Associated "
748,," Builders & Contractors v. Anson, supra, 251 Conn. 213-14. We reiterate that the court's reference to an evidentiary showing 
must be  [***62] understood in light of our analysis in Conboy. See footnote 17 of this opinion."
748,23," ECI alleged, inter alia, that (1) it was a nonunion electrical contractor with extensive experience in public construction projects, 
(2) bid packages for the two school construction projects were put out for competitive bidding by the city pursuant to the 
competitive bidding laws for the purpose of determining the lowest, responsible, qualified bidder and entering into a contract for 
the required work with the successful bidder, (3) ECI's bid was the lowest, responsible, qualified bid for each project, (4) the 
state is providing 90 percent of the funding for both projects, (5) state law provides that ""[a]ll orders and contracts for school 
building construction receiving state assistance . . . shall be awarded to the lowest responsible qualified bidder . . . after a public 
invitation to bid""; General Statutes § 10-287 (b) (1); and that ""the words 'lowest responsible and qualified bidder' shall mean the 
bidder who is prequalified pursuant to section 4a-100, and  [***64] whose bid is the lowest of those bidders possessing the skill, 
ability and integrity necessary to faithful performance of the work based on objective criteria considering past performance and 
information""; General Statutes § 4b-92; (6) ECI is prequalified under the applicable statutory provisions to bid and perform the 
work on both projects, (7) ECI fully meets the statutory definition of ""lowest responsible and qualified bidder,"" (8) none of the 
statutory requirements that define lowest responsible qualified bidder and none of the other public bidding statutes suggest that 
a bidder must execute a PLA and must agree to draw all of its field labor through referrals from a designated trade union, or that 
its nonunion employees must first join a designated trade union as a prerequisite to execution of a contract and performance of 
the subject work, (9) based on the foregoing statutory requirements and regulations adopted thereto, it was illegal and beyond 
the city's authority to impose as a mandatory condition for the award of the two bid packages that the successful bidder execute 
a PLA and agree to draw all of its field labor through referrals from a designated trade union, or that  [***65] its nonunion 
employees must first join a designated trade union before execution of a contract and performance of the subject work could 
commence, (10) the city stated in the bid documents for both projects that all bidders would have to comply with a PLA requiring "
749,," the successful bidder, among other things, to draw all of its field labor through referrals from a designated trade union, or that its 
nonunion employees must first join a designated trade union as a prerequisite to execution of a contract and performance of the 
subject work, (11) there is no provision in the PLAs that an employee of ECI who wants to join the designated trade union solely 
for the purpose of working on the project would be granted membership, would be assigned to work on the project by the 
designated trade union at the request of the ECI employee, would be allowed to work on other non-PLA projects while a member 
of the union for the purpose of working on the project, would have any right to be reimbursed or enjoy the benefit of contributions 
made on his behalf to the union pension funds or to withhold funds or to be reimbursed for contributions designated for the 
union's political or social activities with  [***66] which the employee disagreed, (12) ECI, as a nonunion contractor, would incur 
significant and duplicative costs, as described in detail in the complaint, for providing the labor necessary to construct the 
projects under the required PLAs, which would severely impair ECI's ability successfully to perform the work on the projects and 
would place ECI at a severe competitive disadvantage relative to the union contractors bidding for the work, (13) in light of these 
issues, ECI requested a waiver of the PLA requirement for purposes of the subject bid on the electrical work for the projects but 
received no response, (14) ECI thereafter submitted its lowest responsible qualified bid with a second request for a waiver of the 
PLA requirement and a statement that it would not perform the work pursuant to the PLA requirement in the bid documents, (15) 
ECI subsequently was informed at a meeting with city officials and representatives that they intended to reject ECI's bids on the 
basis of ECI's refusal to agree to the PLA requirement, (16) ECI received no further written communication from the city in this 
regard, (17) on the basis of all information available to ECI, its bids for the projects  [***67] were rejected due to its refusal to 
agree to the mandatory PLA requirement, and the contract for electrical work was awarded to and a contract executed with a 
union contractor that was the third lowest bidder, (18) the city's actions and stated intent to bar any contractor from projects if it 
does not agree to a PLA constitute blatant favoritism for union contractors and union workers, which provides union contractors 
and construction trade unions with an unfair and illegal competitive advantage over nonunion contractors and nonunion 
construction workers, (19) as demonstrated by ECI's significantly lower bid, as well as by other objective data, the imposition of 
PLAs in the context of public school construction diminishes competition and increases the cost of construction by 10 to 20 
percent, (20) nonunion construction contractors and workers comprise over 80 percent of the construction industry in 
Connecticut, and the imposition of PLAs severely discourages and often eliminates their bidding on those contracts, thus 
decreasing competition, (21) the imposition of mandatory PLAs undermines the object and integrity of the public competitive 
bidding process and exhibits patent favoritism  [***68] to the trade unions and union contractors, to the unfair and severe 
disadvantage of nonunion contractors such as ECI and its nonunion employees in this action, and (22) ECI would have been the 
successful bidder on both projects if it had not been for the mandatory PLA requirement, and because a significant amount of 
ECI's work is in public construction in Connecticut, the PLA requirement will severely and irreparably harm ECI's ongoing 
business operations as well as the employment opportunities of its individual employees, and will harm ECI's reputation and 
future ability to obtain work by causing future employers to raise questions about ECI's inability to obtain past work involving PLA 
requirements."

School of Industrial and Labor Relations, Cornell University, ""Project Labor Agreements in New York State: In the Public

regard as significant errors in Fred B. Kotler's critique of the methodology used in the Beacon Hill Institute studies."
750,27," The plaintiffs claimed in count one of their complaint, in which they alleged a violation of the competitive bidding statutes, that 
the PLA requirement imposed conditions that they would not otherwise have included in their bids unrelated to  [***73] a bidder's 
status as the lowest qualified bidder and that the PLA requirement was arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the 
competitive bidding statutes because the city (1) did not consider or analyze any data as to the effect of PLAs on the projects, 
including cost, timeliness or efficiency, (2) did not consider or analyze the effect of PLAs on competition for work on the projects, 
on nonunion workers and their right not to become members of a union, on nonunion workers' health insurance coverage and 
pension benefits, on safety, and on public policy objectives relating to employment opportunities for minorities, women and the 
economically disadvantaged, and (3) had no reason to believe the projects would be subject to delays because of strikes or 
labor unrest or that PLAs would ensure more timely completion of the projects or would relate in any way to the provisions or 
purposes of the competitive bidding requirements. The plaintiffs also alleged in count one that the city, by requiring bidders to 
agree to the terms of a PLA, was exceeding the scope of its authority under the applicable bidding statutes, favored union over 
nonunion contractors and subcontractors and, by failing  [***74] to inform bidders of the terms of the PLA, had made it 
impossible for a bidder to prepare a responsive bid. The plaintiffs thus alleged that the foregoing conduct caused them 
irreparable harm as potential bidders, interested parties, citizens and taxpayers."
750,28," We do not consider ECI's claim that the trial court failed to discuss the criteria that a court should employ in determining the 
validity of a PLA bid specification for a publicly funded construction project because that claim would involve consideration of the 
merits, rather than the issue of the plaintiffs' standing. For the same reason, we do not consider the plaintiffs' claim that the trial 
court improperly concluded that the PLA requirement imposed by the city for the school construction projects did not violate the 
provisions of the applicable competitive bidding laws. "
751,29," Justice Harper contends that the majority expands the court's subject matter jurisdiction by ""depart[ing] from the narrowly 
circumscribed doctrine of standing established by our past cases dealing with [the competitive bidding] statutes,"" particularly this 
court's holding in Associated Builders & Contractors, and ""disregards . . . the lawmaking authority of  [***75] the legislature."" 
Citing Spiniello Construction Co. v. Manchester, supra, 189 Conn. 545, Ardmare Construction Co. v. Freedman, 191 Conn. 497, 
499, 505, 467 A.2d 674 (1983), and Unisys Corp. v. Dept. of Labor, supra, 220 Conn. 696, Justice Harper specifically contends 
that the second part of the standing test, namely, that ""the alleged illegalities amounted to fraud, corruption, favoritism or acts 
undermining the objective and integrity of the competitive bidding process""; Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. 
Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 181; is satisfied only when a plaintiff makes ""a colorable claim that the bidding process-from the 
development of project specifications and bidding rules to the application of these to bidders-was tainted by procedural 
impropriety."" We disagree. Although it is true that the alleged violations in Spiniello and Ardmare, respectively, involved irregular 
bids because of an oral rule addendum communicated to only one bidder and an improper signature on a bidding form, both of 
which flaws may be characterized as strictly procedural in nature; see Ardmare Construction Co. v. Freedman, supra, 499-500; 
Spiniello Construction Co. v. Manchester, supra, 544-45;  [***76] the alleged violation in Unisys Corp. was that the single source 
bid specifications favored a particular vendor. Unisys Corp. v. Dept. of Labor, supra, 691. Although the plaintiff in Unisys Corp. 
also alleged favoritism on the ground that the bid specifications had been prepared with the assistance of the vendor in question; 
see id.; the court ultimately held that the plaintiff would have standing if it could show that the restrictions imposed by the single 
source specifications alone precluded it from participating in a manner that impaired the fairness of the bidding process; see id., 
695; see also Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 180; and that the plaintiff was 
entitled to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the specifications had caused such an impairment. Unisys Corp. v. Dept. 
of Labor, supra, 695, 698. The court did not qualify its holding by adding that the plaintiff also would be required to show that the 
drafting of the specifications had been tainted by procedural impropriety. Thereafter, the court in Associated Builders & 
Contractors determined under the second part of the standing test that the plaintiffs in that case had  [***77] ""failed to make even 
a colorable factual showing"" in support of their claim that the use of a PLA illegally had resulted in the absence of a level playing 
field for union and nonunion contractors and subcontractors interested in participating in a government building project. 
Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 187. The court did not conclude, as Justice Harper 
suggests, that the inclusion of a PLA bid specification never can be challenged on the ground that it favors union over nonunion 
bidders unless accompanied by a drafting impropriety, but only that the plaintiffs had failed to assert a colorable claim of injury in 
that case, which accounts for the court's repeated references to deficiencies in the record as the reason for its decision. Id., 187 
n.12, 188-89. Accordingly, Associated Builders & Contractors cannot dictate the result here, as Justice Harper contends, 
because the record in the present case, unlike the record in Associated Builders & Contractors, is sufficient to support the 
conclusion that ECI had standing."

a federal forum, there are no such claims in this case, as I understand it. . . . ""Section 301 [provides that] . . . 'state law is preempted insofar as resolution of the state law claim requires the interpretation of a 
collective bargaining agreement.' . . . Section 301 preemption does not apply for at least two reasons. ""First, I do not believe that interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement or other labor agreement is required in this case. 
Referral to that agreement, reference to it, reading it, understanding what it says is required. It is not required that the judge 
hearing this case interpret . . . a labor agreement. ""Moreover, § 301 preemption  [***93] occurs in a case where parties to a collective bargaining agreement disagree about their 
rights or obligations under that agreement, and that is simply not what we have in this case. We don't have a union or union 
member suing an employer or vice versa. Rather, we have a disappointed bidder suing a number of parties and claiming that the 
obligation in the bid documents to use union labor is unlawful. That simply is not the type of claim that § 301 reaches."" "

759,45," General Statutes § 10-287 provides in relevant part: HN34[
] ""(b) (1) All orders and contracts for school building construction 
receiving state assistance under this chapter, except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, shall be awarded to the 
lowest responsible qualified bidder only after a public invitation to bid . . . . ""(2) All orders and contracts for architectural or construction management services shall be awarded from a pool of not more 
than the four most responsible qualified proposers after a public selection process. Such process shall, at a minimum, involve 
requests for qualifications, followed by requests for proposals, including fees, from the proposers  [***111] meeting the 
qualifications criteria of the request for qualifications process. . . . Following the qualification process, the awarding authority 
shall evaluate the proposals to determine the four most responsible qualified proposers using those criteria previously listed in 
the requests for qualifications and requests for proposals for selecting architectural or construction management services 
specific to the project or school district. Such evaluation criteria shall include due consideration of the proposer's pricing for the 
project, experience with work of similar size and scope as required for the order or contract, organizational and team structure 
for the order or contract, past performance data, including, but not limited to, adherence to project schedules and project 
budgets and the number of change orders for projects, the approach to the work required for the contract and documented 
contract oversight capabilities, and may include criteria specific to the project. Final selection by the awarding authority is limited 
to the pool of the four most responsible qualified proposers and shall include consideration of all criteria included within the 
request for proposals. As used  [***112] in this subdivision, 'most responsible qualified proposer' means the proposer who is 
qualified by the awarding authority when considering price and the factors necessary for faithful performance of the work based 
on the criteria and scope of work included in the request for proposals. ""(c) If the commissioner determines that a building project has not met the approved conditions of the original application, the 
State Board of Education may withhold subsequent state grant payments for said project until appropriate action, as determined 
by the commissioner, is taken to cause the building project to be in compliance with the approved conditions or may require 
repayment of all state grant payments for said project when such appropriate action is not undertaken within a reasonable time. ""(d) Each town or regional school district shall submit a final grant application to the Department of Education within one year 
from the date of completion and acceptance of the building project by the town or regional school district. If a town or regional 
school district fails to submit a final grant application within said period of time, the commissioner may withhold ten per cent of 
the state reimbursement  [***113] for such project."" "
760,," The plaintiffs also refer to the state defendants' authority pursuant to General Statutes § 49-41, which requires that contractors 
provide to the state or municipality performance bonds for contracts to construct, modify or repair public buildings and public 
works. "
761,1, See footnote 1 of the majority opinion for a listing of the individual plaintiffs named in this case.
761,2, See footnotes 3 and 4 of the majority opinion for a complete listing of the defendants in this case. 
762,3," In the present case, there is evidence in the record supporting the legitimacy of this decision. The record reflects that project 
labor agreements had yielded successful results in other projects in the state. Moreover, regardless of whether conditions are 
such that this particular project labor agreement will yield the same result, it cannot be said that the objective of the defendant 
city of Hartford in requiring this project labor agreement is antithetical to the purpose of the competitive bidding statutes. "
763,4," The majority's approach to cost appears to conflate two distinct levels of cost consideration: first, the specifications of a 
project—a building's location, its size, the specific construction materials, the time to completion, permissible levels of noise or 
pollution, etc.—dictate in broad terms what a project will cost. After those specifications are set, the competitive bidding process 
allows a public entity to find the contractor who will satisfactorily perform the prespecified project at the lowest price. Section 4a-
100 plays a role in determining who may participate in this second level bidding process, but it is wholly unrelated to the initial 
development of project specifications at the first level. ECI here seeks to challenge not the process of submitting bids but the 
legitimacy of a mandated specification of the project itself, namely, that contractors abide by a project labor agreement. ECI 
expressly refused to comply with this specification, and consequently it was by definition not the lowest  [***127] bidder on the 
project specified by the defendants. ECI's claim in the present case essentially asks us to nullify that specification in order to 
render its low bid compliant on the ground that the specification increases the project's cost. Not only is this claim unrelated to § 
4a-100, but the court in Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors already has spoken directly to this issue: ""[W]e know of 
no requirement in the competitive bidding statutes that propels cost considerations to the top of the list of appropriate 
considerations for public contract specifications. If cost alone were the determinative factor of appropriate bid criteria, 
disappointed bidders or nonbidders would have virtually unlimited opportunities to litigate project specifications on the ground of 
alternate designs, materials, safety requirements and so on."" (Emphasis added.) Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors 
v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 187-88. The potentially absurd results invited by the majority's undifferentiated emphasis on cost may be illustrated by considering a 
hypothetical challenge under the competitive bidding statutes to a public project based on material, rather than labor, costs. 
 [***128] Suppose a public entity solicits bids to construct a building with a slate roof, rather than an asphalt shingled roof. The 
decision to specify the roofing materials is made on the basis of desired longevity, aesthetic preference, or arbitrary whim. Slate 
is much more difficult to work with than asphalt, and only a subset of contractors possess the skill and access to materials 
needed to work with slate efficiently. Other contractors, who out of habit, aesthetic preference, or chance do not typically work 
with slate, are therefore, as ECI here complains, placed at a significant competitive disadvantage because of the specified 
material input. Under the logic of the majority opinion, if a ""non-slate"" contractor were to submit a low bid, conditional on being 
allowed to construct the roof from asphalt, and the bid were rejected, the disappointed noncompliant bidder would have standing 
to bring an action based on a claimed violation of competitive bidding laws by asserting that requiring slate roofs would decrease 
competition and increase the costs to the public. This is plainly nonsensical and inconsistent with the limited grounds of standing 
permitted under existing Connecticut legislation.  [***129] There might be reason to doubt the wisdom of insisting on a slate roof, "
764,," particularly if the decision is the product of arbitrary whim, and there may be cause for questioning the mandated use of arguably 
more expensive union labor. But under the present constitutional division of power, in the absence of a colorable claim of 
procedural corruption, these are judgments to be made by the legislature, not by this court."
764,5," For this reason, I am not swayed by the majority's citation to Statewide Grievance Committee v. Rozbicki, 211 Conn. 232, 558 
A.2d 986 (1989). In the present case, both prongs of the test in Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors speak equally to 
subject matter jurisdiction, whereas Rozbicki refers to a discussion of the merits following a finding that jurisdiction was lacking."

under the pleadings and proof may be determined, even though either one would dispose of the entire case upon its merits, and 
neither holding is a dictum, so long as it is properly raised, considered, and determined.""); QOS Networks, Ltd. v. Warburg,

alternative holding"")."
765,8," Even while dismissing the reasoning of Connecticut Associated Builders & Contractors as mere dicta, the majority invokes that 
case  [***135] to justify its holding in the present case: ""One need only examine the reasons why the court in Connecticut 
Associated Builders & Contractors concluded that the [named plaintiff] did not have standing to understand why ECI in the 
present case does."" (Emphasis in original.) While the majority's assertion nicely demonstrates that it really is possible to have 
one's cake and eat it too, the argument suffers from a fundamental logical flaw: simply because one set of reasons leads to a 
particular result, it does not follow that the absence of this reasoning compels a different result. Indeed, it is only by ignoring all 
past precedent that the majority is able to suggest that the specific reasoning articulated in Connecticut Associated Builders & 
Contractors represents the only basis on which standing is properly denied. "
766,9," This court's decision in Spiniello Construction Co. appears to have been influenced by the adoption of an ""injury in fact"" basis 
for standing in the federal courts following the enactment of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq., 
which in turn was applied to claims challenging federal bidding statutes. Our decision cited several federal court decisions in 
support of our conclusion. See, e.g., Scanwell Laboratories, Inc. v. Shaffer, 424 F.2d 859, 865, 137 U.S. App. D.C. 371 (D.C. 
Cir. 1970) (explaining in case addressing  [***140] public bidding statute, ""[t]he law of standing was greatly modified by the 
passage of the Administrative Procedure Act""); id., 872 (""the Administrative Procedure Act applies to all situations in which a 
party who is in fact aggrieved seeks review, regardless of a lack of legal right or specific statutory language""). This court has 
long recognized, however, that ""[t]he Connecticut counterpart to [the relevant provision of the Administrative Procedure Act] . . . 
is much more limited in scope."" Ardmare Construction Co. v. Freedman, supra, 191 Conn. 503. The narrower language of our 
own Uniform Administrative Procedure Act; General Statutes § 4-166 et seq.; plainly does not confer on courts the authority to 
adopt an ""injury in fact"" standing analysis, and we have not adopted a similarly expansive standard for standing to bring claims 
under any other statutory scheme."
766,10," This court has held that as a matter of formal authority, where ""subject matter jurisdiction is created by statute . . . we have no 
power to enlarge or circumscribe it."" Ambroise v. William Raveis Real Estate, Inc., 226 Conn. 757, 763, 628 A.2d 1303 (1993);

767,11," The majority, in footnote 17 of its opinion, notes that evidentiary hearings are atypical in motions to dismiss and expresses 
some doubt regarding whether a hearing was appropriate here. While I agree with the majority's general statement of law, this 
court has stated with respect to competitive bidding statutes: ""Although the plaintiffs were not required to prove the merits of their 
claim, they did have the lesser burden of establishing a colorable claim. . . . Under the test for standing set forth in Unisys Corp., 
Ardmare Construction Co. and Spiniello Construction Co., the trial court was required to conduct an evidentiary hearing to 
decide whether the plaintiffs had established a colorable claim that the project  [***144] labor agreement requirement had 
undermined the integrity or objectives of the competitive bidding process."" (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Connecticut 
Associated Builders & Contractors v. Hartford, supra, 251 Conn. 182."
767,12," General Statutes § 35-35, for example, provides in relevant part that ""any person . . . injured in its business or property by any 
violation of the provisions of this chapter shall recover treble damages . . . ."" (Emphasis added.) "
768,13," In its complaint, ECI does allege that ""[u]nlike its union contractor competitors, ECI never participated in the collective 
bargaining agreements and negotiations that resulted in . . . the [project labor agreement] . . . ."" It is unclear, however, what 
significance this allegation has for purposes of the antitrust claim. As the majority notes, ECI ""[does] not challenge the legality of 
the [project labor agreement] or the process by which it was negotiated, but, rather, the fact that it was included in the mandatory 
bid specifications with which all prospective bidders, union and nonunion alike, were required to comply."" "
770,1," The factual recitation is derived generally from plaintiffs' Complaint for Damages (""complaint""), the target of defendants' 
challenges. "
771,2," Defendants seek F.R.Civ.P. 12(f) relief as to the complaint's punitive damages and attorney fees claims. However, defendants'

971 (9th Cir. 2010) (""We therefore hold that Rule 12(f) does not authorize district courts to strike claims for damages on the 
ground that such claims are precluded as a matter of law."") As such, this Court will address defendants' challenges and plaintiffs' 
claims under F.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) standards. "
774,3," F.R.Civ.P. 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to state law causes of action: ""[W]hile a federal court will examine state law to 
determine whether the elements of fraud have been pled sufficiently to state a cause of action, the Rule 9(b) requirement that 
the circumstances of the fraud must be stated with particularity  [**16] is a federally imposed rule."" Vess v. Ciba-Geigy Corp. 
USA, 317 F.3d 1097, 1103 (9th Cir. 2003) (quoting Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 443 (1st Cir. 1995)(italics in original))."
774,4," ""In some cases, the plaintiff may allege a unified course of fraudulent conduct and rely entirely on that course of conduct as the 
basis of a claim. In that event, the claim is said to be 'grounded in fraud' or to 'sound in fraud,' and the pleading of that claim as a 
whole must satisfy the particularity requirement of Rule 9(b)."" Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103-1104. "

Section II of the Sherman Act, and deny attorney fees incurred on St. John's affirmative defense of immunity under the Health 
Care Quality Improvement Act, on plaintiff's state law claims for Tortious Interference with Contract, and the Oklahoma Antitrust

law, and based on that review, has reconsidered some aspects of the recommendation."
792,3," On August 27, 2009, Judge Frizzell announced from the bench his decision on St. John's Motion for Summary Judgment and

793,6," Dr. Allred talked with several St. John physicians regarding the two subject surgeries performed by Dr. Cohlmia. He spoke to a 
thoracic surgeon who disagreed with Dr. Cohlmia's decision to operate. The thoracic surgeon said he would not have operated 
on a patient with cancer in the lung that had spread to the mediastinum and had positive lymph notes. Dr. Allred spoke to Dr. Jay 
Lohrey, an oncologist, who treated one of the patients post-surgically. Dr. Lohrey felt that Dr. Cohlmia committed error and that 
his patient had been unnecessarily harmed. A pulmonologist who had reviewed the charts opined that Dr. Cohlmia's pre-surgical 
work-up was insufficient. [Dkt. # 364 at 3]."
793,7," At the hearing on St. John's motion for summary judgement, a ""pre-surgical workup"" was explained as diagnostic testing and 
consulting with other specialists to identify the type of cancerous tumor, the stage of the tumor, and  [**9] the best method of 
treatment. [Dkt. # 451 at 12-14]"
793,8," According to St. John's bylaws, Dr. Allred had the authority to summarily suspend any member of the medical staff whenever 
necessary to ""protect the life of any patient(s) or reduce the substantial likelihood of immediate injury or damage to the health or 
safety of any patient."" [Dkt. # 364 at 2]. The letter included the following information: (1) a detailed description of the two cases 
and the reasons they felt the surgeries were inappropriate; (2) a statement that, based on the advice of members of the medical 
staff, Dr. Cohlmia's conduct posed an imminent threat of harm to patients; (3) a statement that Dr. Cohlmia had the right to 
request a hearing to address the summary suspension within 30 days and an identification of the person to whom he should 
direct the request; and (4) a statement that a hearing would be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by one of the Medical 
Staff Entities. [Dkt. # 364 at 4]."
793,9," Dr. Cohlmia and St. John were represented by their respective attorneys. Fourteen physicians testified and were cross

proceeding was recorded. [Dkt. # 451 at 56]. "
794,10," At the initial attorney fees hearings, Dr. Cohlmia's counsel claimed settlement with co-defendants in this case was evidence 
that the claims against St. John were reasonable. The undersigned disagrees. Settlement of a case with a co-defendant has no 
bearing on the merits of St. John's claim for fees. The facts relevant to St. John are not necessarily the same  [**12] facts 
relevant to other defendants. Unlike the defendants who settled, judgment on the merits was entered in favor of St. John and 
against plaintiffs. Moreover, cases, even those with no merit, settle for many reasons, including a desire to minimize legal fees 
and expenses. The motivations of St. John's co-defendants and the reasons any of the them entered into a settlement with 
plaintiff have no bearing on this proceeding."

798,25," Specifically, Judge Frizzell said, ""The evidence of ulterior motive in Brown was direct."" In Brown, it was clear that an economic 
competitor had instigated the review and made false misstatements to the National Practitioner Databank, that the doctor was 
negligent, that the competitor was the principal witness against the plaintiff, and that there was ""overwhelming proof of conjuring 
up evidence against the doctor."" In contrast, Judge Frizzell found the evidence of ulterior motive to be merely ""inferential."" [Dkt. # 
451 at 121]. "
799,26," For authority that St. John's market share was not sufficient to confer market power, Judge Frizzell cited and relied on 
Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 464 U.S. 808, 104 S. Ct. 58, 78 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1983)."
799,27," HCQIA, which is designed to protect entities such as St. John from millions of dollars in damages arising out of a properly 
conducted peer review process, is also designed to protect such entities from needlessly  [**35] paying smaller amounts to 
defend itself against unreasonable, unfounded, or frivolous claims. "
800,28," St. John's professional peer  [**38] review process preceded the professional peer review process conducted by Hillcrest 
Medical Center. "
802,29," This argument fails at the attorney fee stage of the proceeding, because plaintiff is essentially attempting to relitigate the issue 
of immunity which was resolved by Judge Frizzell."
802,30," Judge Frizzell made the following statement immediately prior to announcing his decision granting judgment to St. John: ""First, 
I'd like to say that the advocacy on both sides here has been just extraordinarily good and I appreciate it very much from all of 
you."" [Dkt. # 529, Ex. C]. "
803,31," Except as set forth below, the undersigned finds that the hourly rates charged by St. John's counsel, including paralegals, was 
reasonable."
803,32," There is, however, no requirement for the court to identify each hour reasonably expended by each timekeeper, nor is there 
any requirement that the court announce what hours are permitted for each legal task. See Case v. Unified School District No. 
233, 157 F.3d 1243 (10th Cir. 1998). "
817,1," Legend Ingredients Group, Inc., was also added as a defendant, but the claims against this defendant were voluntarily 
withdrawn on June 20, 2008, allegedly because this defendant began ""providing cooperation to Plaintiffs."""
817,2," Defendants have other reasons for arguing that MHL is inadequate; since I find this ground to be dispositive on the issue of 
MHL's adequacy, however, I will not address defendants' other arguments. "
821,3," As noted in my decision granting summary judgment on behalf of JSPCA, JSPCA's former chief executive officer failed to 
preserve documents and e-mails relevant to this case. However, this possible spoliation did not prevent plaintiffs from seeking 
other evidence of Jiangsu's domination of JSPCA. "
825,4," Defendants do not identify this argument as addressing any particular subsection of Rule 23(a). Although the argument seems 
to call Ranis's adequacy into question, the Second Circuit has held that such attacks on the putative class representative should 
be addressed under the typicality prong because an ignorant representative may give ""misleading and contradictory testimony 
with regard to basic issues in the case that might make their claims subject to unique defenses."" Baffa, 222 F.3d at 61.  [**41] I 
would note, however, that the Second Circuit has addressed this issue under the adequacy prong in the past, and despite this 
technical change the analysis remains the same. See Maywalt v. Parker & Parsley Petrol. Co., 67 F.3d 1072, 1077-78 (2d Cir. 
1995)."
825,5," Defendants also argue that Ranis's decision to dismiss Northeast advanced Ranis's interests at the expense of other class 
members who may not have signed arbitration clauses with Northeast. This argument is puzzling, as defendants fail to explain 
how the absent class members' interests would be served by moving this case to an arbitration panel in a country that has 
expressly condoned the defendants' agreements to fix the price  [**44] of vitamin C. "
833,6," I do not think that allowing class members to opt out of the Injunction Class would solve this problem. Like the Seventh Circuit, I 
find it ""unacceptable"" to require an indirect purchaser to ""elect between joining an ongoing class suit and thereby forfeiting his 
right to seek individual damages, on the one hand, and removing himself from the class (and hence risking exclusion from any 
equitable relief granted) in order to preserve the possibility of bringing a subsequent damage action, on the other."" Crowder, 687 
F.2d at 1009. "
838,1," The other defendants in Case No. 11-4407 are alleged assignees of patents in suit: Latrosse Technologies, LLC (patent '165), 
Roldan Block NY, LLC (patent '736), Intellectual Ventures Funding, LLC (patent '061), TR Technologies Foundation (patent 
'331), LLC, Taichi Holdings, LLC (patent '350), Noregin Assets N.V., LLC (patent '497), and Detelle Relay KG, LLC (patent '251). 
Plaintiff alleges that these entities are holding companies and that their activities are directed by IV and/or IV Management. FAC, 
¶ 24."
838,2," As the Court is faced with a motion challenging its jurisdiction, the Court is allowed to review material outside of the complaints 
at issue. McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558 (9th Cir. 1988). The Court recognizes that the parties have filed much of the 
information regarding their business negotiations under seal. However, the Court does not find that the parties have met the 
good cause standard required for continued sealing to the extent the Court relies on and cites that information in this publicly 
filed order. "
841,3," The Court has reviewed  [*16] the case cited in defendants' statement of recent decision, Streck, Inc. v. Research & Diagnostic 
Sys., 665 F.3d 1269, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 458 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 10, 2012), but finds that case inapposite. In Streck, the issue 
before the Court was whether the district court had declaratory relief jurisdiction over defendants' cross-claims for invalidity with 
respect to all claims for all of the patents in dispute, where the plaintiff was asserting only some claims against defendants' 
products. The Federal Circuit affirmed the district court's holding that jurisdiction existed against only the asserted claims, and 
reiterated that the standard for declaratory relief jurisdiction, under MedImmune, is that a party seeking declaratory judgment has 
the burden of establishing jurisdiction under the totality of circumstances test. "
843,4," IV again argues that declaratory judgment jurisdiction for invalidity claims is lacking because there is no jurisdiction over the 
non-infringement claims. As above, that argument is rejected. IV also re-raises its argument that Xilinx's non-infringement claims 
are impermissibly broad in seeking a judgment that ""all"" Xilinx products do not infringe. As above, the Court rejects that 
argument and finds that Xilinx's FAC adequately specifies the products and families of products, so that IV can defend this case. "
844,5," Also,  [*26] as IV points out, in Xilinx's original complaint in the 11-0671 action, Xilinx itself alleged that IV Management had not 
shown it had the right to ""bring an action"" to enforce any of the patents at issue in this case. See, e.g., 11-0671 Docket No. 1, ¶ 
38 ('251 patent). It is hard to see how Xilinx was misled by these representations when it apparently knew that IV and/or IV 
Management were not assignees at least by the time Xilinx filed suit in February 2011. Moreover, the current assignee of a 
patent

847,1," For the purposes of a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true. Justice v. Town 
of Cicero, 577 F.3d 768, 771 (7th Cir. 2009). "
850,2," On August 30, 2011 McCoy filed an amended complaint naming Gamesa and Streator-Cayuga Ridge Wind Power, LLC as 
additional defendants. "
851,3," Outland maintains that it need not provide greater factual support for its claims because a motion to dismiss must only be 
granted ""if it is impossible for the plaintiff to prevail under any set of facts that could be proven consistent with the allegations."" 
(Pl.'s Resp. at 2) (quoting Jackson v. United States Steel Corp., No. 05-CV-486DRH, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16233, 2006 WL 
897903 at *2 (S.D. Ill. Apr. 3, 2006)). Outland misstates the prevailing law. As discussed above, the current legal standard for 
testing the sufficiency of a complaint is set forth in Twombly and its progeny and requires that a complaint plead sufficient facts 
that raise the right to relief above the speculative level. 550 U.S. at 555."
851,4," Count  [*18] IX alleges that Iberdrola violated Section 15.50 of the Texas Antitrust Act. Section 15.50 deals with covenants not 
to compete, and Outland has not pled any such cause of action in its complaint. Presumably, Outland intended to allege a 
violation of Section 15.05, which prohibits conspiracies in restrain of trade and mirrors the language of the Sherman Act. "
852,5," Courts routinely evaluate antitrust claims under the Minnesota Antitrust Act of 1971 and the Texas Antitrust Act by applying 
federal antitrust law. Therefore, Outland's state and federal antitrust claims rise and fall together. See Howard v. Minn. 
Timberwolves Basketball Ltd. P'ship, 636 N.W.2d 551, 557 (Minn. Ct. App. 2001); Marlin v. Robertson, 307 S.W.3d 418, 422 n.2 
(Tex Ct. App. 2009). "
857,1," The parties' requests for oral argument are denied. The issues have been fully briefed and oral argument will not aid the 
Court's decision. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b); Partridge v. Reich, 141 F.3d 920, 926 (9th Cir. 1998). "
864,2," Defendants elsewhere identify Open Market as one of the aggregators with whom Verizon did business. See Doc. 220, ¶ 27."
864,3," Verizon has not responded to Defendants' fraud arguments. Because the Court may dismiss a claim  [*37] under Rule 12(b)(6) 
only if it is satisfied that the claim is legally unsound, it has considered Defendants' arguments in light of the allegations in the 
FAC. "
867,4," The Motricity letter that JAWA refers  [*48] to as Exhibit 1 is not attached to the TAC as JAWA indicates, but it is attached to 
JAWA's motion for leave to amend counterclaims. See Doc. 169-1 at 82-85. "
880,1," Rugby was subsequently sold to defendant Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Watson"") (collectively, with Barr and HMR, ""generic 
defendants""). "
881,2," HN3[
] There is no statute or rule that supercedes a district court's Rule 54(d)(1) discretion to award or deny costs to a plaintiff who has failed to prevail in an antitrust action. See White & White, Inc. v. American Hosp. Supply Corp., 786 F.2d 728, 
731 (6th Cir. 1986). The Clayton Act provides that a party injured by an antitrust violation ""shall recover . . . the cost of suit."" 15 
U.S.C. § 15(a). It does not alter a court's discretion to award or deny costs to a plaintiff who has failed to prove a violation. "
884,1, Statutory references are to the Health and Safety Code unless otherwise indicated.
884,2," COBRA is an acronym for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, which mandates that certain 
employees and their dependents be offered the option of paying premiums to continue medical coverage for a limited period 
after the termination of coverage under a group health plan. (See 29 U.S.C. §§ 1161-1167; 42 U.S.C. §§ 300bb-1 to 300bb-8.) "
885,3," California insurance companies and health care service plans are subject to two distinct regulatory schemes. Health care 
service plans such as Blue Shield are governed by the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Knox-Keene Act) 
(see § 1340 et seq.) and fall under the regulatory  [*6] authority of the Department of Managed Health Care. (See Nieto v. Blue 
Shield of Cal. Life & Health Ins. Co. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 60, 84-85, 103 Cal. Rptr. 3d 906.) Other health care issuers, 
including traditional indemnity health care insurers, are subject to provisions of the Insurance Code and fall under the regulatory 
authority of the Department of Insurance. (Blue Cross of California, Inc. v. Superior Court (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 1237, 1243, 
102 Cal. Rptr. 3d 615; Viola v. California Dept. of Managed Health Care (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 299, 309, fn. 3, 34 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
626.) California's HIPAA-based legislation governs both health insurers and health care service plans. (Compare §§ 1366.35, 
1399.805, 1399.811 [health care service plans] with Ins. Code, §§ 10785, 10900-10902.6 [health benefit plans governed by Ins. 
Code].) "
886,4," In late 2009 the Department of Managed Health Care adopted a policy interpreting sections 1399.805 and 1399.811's ""average 
premium paid"" language to require application of a formula that uses ""weights"" based upon the ""MRMIP population base of an 
entire region . . . rather than the population of a single age band . . . within that region."" Lample alleges the new policy was 
adopted without complying with California's Administrative Procedures Act (Gov. Code, § 11340.5) and has separately petitioned 
for a writ  [*10] of mandate to compel the Department to rescind the 2009 policy, alleging it is invalid. (L.A. Sup. Ct. Case No. 
BC445662.)"
886,5," Although not specifically alleged in Lample's complaint, it is reasonable to infer that the more expensive plan will have fewer 
subscribers. "
888,6," The  [*18] definition of ""unfair"" within the meaning of the UCL is discussed in part 4 below."
888,7," Although Lample did not argue in the trial court that she had stated a viable cause of action under the ""unfair"" prong of the 
UCL, we requested letter briefing from the parties on the question whether the complaint states, or can be amended to state, a 
cause of action for an unfair business practice under Business and Professions Code section 17200. (See generally Aubry v. Tri-
City Hospital Dist., supra, 2 Cal.4th at p. 967 [order sustaining demurrer without leave to amend is improper if complaint states, 
or can be amended to state, cause of action under any possible legal theory].) "
891,8," At oral argument Blue Shield insisted the demurrer was properly sustained because it would violate due process to impose civil 
liability based on an agency interpretation of which it had no notice. Blue Shield's purported lack of notice of the Department of 
Managed Health Care's interpretation of the governing statutes was not the basis for the court's order, nor would it have been 
proper for the court to make such a determination on demurrer. A due process violation is not apparent from the face of the 
complaint; and any analysis of that issue,  [*31] which rests on the facts and circumstances surrounding the Department of 
Managed Health Care's adoption of the interpretation asserted by Lample, cannot properly be made from the limited evidentiary 
presentation offered in support of Blue Shield's demurrer. "
892,9," Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c), permits judicial notice of ""[o]fficial acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial 
departments of the United States and of any state of the United States."""
892,10," Even if the document itself may be subject to judicial notice, judicial notice of the truth of the matters stated in the document is 
improper.  [*33] (See Mangini v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1057, 1063, 31 Cal. Rptr. 2d 358, 875 P.2d 73 
[""[w]hile courts may notice official acts and public records, 'we do not take judicial notice of the truth of all matters stated 
therein'""], overruled on another ground in In re Tobacco Cases II (2007) 41 Cal.4th 1257, 1262, 1276, 63 Cal. Rptr. 3d 418, 163 
P.3d 106.)"
892,11," Asked at oral argument about the basis for Blue Shield's contention its rates had been expressly approved by the Department 
of Managed Health Care, counsel referred only to a July 27, 2010 letter written by an assistant deputy director of the 
Department's office of legal services to a dissatisfied insured, which states, ""Regulators acknowledge that the statute was open 
to varying interpretations, and that either a 'straight average' or a 'weighted average' would be permissible absent further 
clarification."" Even were this letter properly subject to judicial notice as part of the legislative history of AB 718—a questionable 
assumption (see, e.g., Quintano v. Mercury Casualty Co. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1049, 1062, fn. 5, 48 Cal. Rptr. 2d 1, 906 P.2d 
1057)—and apart from the hearsay problem discussed above, the author's invocation of the opinion of undefined ""regulators"" 
without any further supporting detail or citation cannot, on demurrer, be construed as approval of Blue Shield's allegedly unlawful 
pricing practices."
892,12," MacKay v. Superior Court (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1427, 1435, 115 Cal. Rptr. 3d 893, on which Blue Shield relies, is 
inapposite. MacKay held that the Department of Insurance's approval of a rate premium immunized the insurer from a civil action 
challenging the use of that premium.  [*36] Citing Insurance Code sections 1860.1 and 1860.2, the Court of Appeal held the 
Insurance Commissioner has exclusive jurisdiction over issues related to ratemaking; insurance rates could only be challenged 
under statutes and regulations pertaining to the Insurance Code; and approval of rates by the Department of Insurance means 
the rate has the ""imprimatur"" of the Department of Insurance and may not be challenged in a civil action, under the UCL or "
893,," otherwise. (MacKay, at pp. 1442-1444.) Unlike the Department of Insurance, the Department of Managed Health Care is not 
vested with the authority to determine rates (see § 1367 [""[n]othing in this section shall be construed to permit the director to 
establish the rates charged subscribers and enrollees for contractual health care services""]); and, as we have explained, nothing 
in the Knox-Keene Act enforcement provisions or any other statute prohibits a private individual from bringing his or her own 
UCL action for Knox-Keene Act violations (Blue Cross, supra, 180 Cal.App.4th at p. 1251)."
893,13," A simple example illustrates the difference as we understand it. If two providers offer HIPAA PPO plans to eligible individuals 
in a particular rating cell—one at $100/month; the other at $150/month—the average monthly rate charged by the providers is 
$125 regardless of the number of subscribers to each plan. If there are 90 subscribers to the $100 plan and 10 subscribers to 
the $150 plan, however, the average monthly premium paid by a subscriber, using a weighted mean, is $105. "
895,14," Blue Shield argues for the first time on appeal the court should exercise its discretion and dismiss this UCL case under the 
judicial abstention doctrine. (See Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 496, 104 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
545 [""[a]s a general matter, a trial court may abstain from adjudicating a suit that seeks equitable remedies if 'granting the 
requested relief would require a trial court to assume the functions of an administrative agency or to interfere with the functions 
of an administrative agency'""]; Klein v. Chevron USA, supra, 202 Cal. App. 4th 1342 [same].) Lample argues Blue Shield has 
forfeited the argument by failing to raise it in the trial court. (Sea & Sage Audubon Society, Inc. v. Planning Com. (1983) 34 
Cal.3d 412, 417, 194 Cal. Rptr. 357, 668 P.2d 664 [""'issues not raised in trial court cannot be raised for first time on appeal'""]; In 
re Marriage of Eben-King & King (2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 92, 117, 95 Cal. Rptr. 2d 113 [same].) In light of our reversal of the 
judgment and remand to the trial court, Blue Shield will have the opportunity to raise, and the trial court  [*47] will be able to 
consider, that claim in the first instance. (See Arce, at p. 482 [decision whether to dismiss case under doctrine of judicial 
abstention is matter within trial court's discretion].) "
896,15," Lample also alleged Blue Shield materially misrepresented to the Department of Managed Health Care that it was in 
compliance with sections 1399.805 and 1399.811. Because the alleged misrepresentation was made to the Department, not to 
Lample, and she does not allege she relied on it, that allegation cannot support her fraud claim. "
900,1," Although Plaintiffs motion and memorandum each recite that it was supported by a ""verified Second Amended Complaint,"" the 
complaints  [**3] filed in this matter were not, in fact, ""verified."" "
901,2," The federal antitrust laws allow injunctive relief for private parties, including preliminary injunctive relief Clayton Act, § 16, 15 
U.S.C. § 26 (""Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief.. . against 
threatened loss or damages by a violation of the antitrust laws .. . when and under the same conditions and principles as 
injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules 
governing such proceedings, and upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an injunction improvidently granted 
and a showing that the danger of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a preliminary injunction may issue.""). "
902,3," ""Bench work"" is minilab repair work performed off-site from a service customer's location."
902,4," It is unclear from the pleadings whether RIMG alleges that ""bench work"" and ""photo call center"" services are part of the defined 
market for FUJI-brand minilab repair service or whether they are separate relevant markets or sub-markets. "
903,5," In the present case, the court is appropriately sensitive to the loss of any jobs by RIMG's employees in Oregon, but an 
inappropriately granted preliminary injunction may wrongfully cause a comparable loss of jobs to FUJI's employees in another 
state in this nationwide market. Under constitutional law principles derived from the ""dormant commerce clause"" doctrine, a court 
should not prefer the jobs of employees in one  [**14] state over the jobs of employees in another state. See generally Erwin 
Chemerinsky, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 430-461 (4th ed. 2011). "
904,6," To the extent that they are separate markets and RIMG is attempting to allege a theory of ""monopoly leveraging,"" that is not a 
valid antitrust theory in the Ninth Circuit. See John Doe I v. Abbott Laboratories, 571 F.3d 930, 934 (9th Cir. 2009). "
905,7," The court will wait for another day to evaluate the question of whether call center service is a ""product that less diversified 
competitors are trying to sell separately,"" given that both RIMG and FUJI appear to be selling both repair services and call center 
services to the same customer. Thus, if RIMG offers both services in a bundle, under what circumstances, if any, should the 
antitrust laws, under PeaceHealth, restrict FUJI from doing so? There may be a good answer to that question, but that analysis 
is for another day."
905,8," Mr. Pagano, however, did not explain in his declaration whether he was referring to ""average variable costs"" or to some other 
measure of cost. "
906,9," In light of the court's ruling, there is no need to discuss the details of any security that would have been required had a 
preliminary injunction been ordered. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). "
911,1," The Customer Agreement is attached as Ex. 3 to the Affidavit of Tricia Lancaster, Docket No. 15."
911,2, The letter may found at Docket No. 22.
911,3," The parties dispute whether the New Jersey or the New York consumer protection statute is applicable to the plaintiffs' claims, 
but neither party asks the Court to decide that issue here. "
913,4," On February 1, 2012, the Second Circuit, after sua sponte considering the effect of Concepcion on its American Express 
decisions, reaffirmed the holdings of those cases. See In re Am. Express Merchants' Litig., No. 06-1871-cv, 2012 U.S. App. 
LEXIS 1871 (2d Cir. Feb. 1, 2012) (""Am. Express III""). American Express III does not alter the analysis of this Memorandum 
Opinion and Order."
913,5," In light of Concepcion, there is some reason to question the applicability of this framework to claims,  [**12] like plaintiffs', that 
are based on state, rather than federal, law because Concepcion itself ""involved the vindication of state, not federal, rights."" 
Raniere v. Citigroup, Inc., 827 F. Supp. 2d 294, 310, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135393, 2011 WL 5881926, at * 13 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). 
Accordingly, it is possible to read Concepcion ""broadly to acquiesce to the enforcement of an arbitral agreement that as a 
practical matter would prevent the vindication of state rights in the name of furthering the strong federal policy favoring 
arbitration."" Id. (dicta). However, because, as discussed below, the question of the availability of ""general injunctive relief"" must 
be left to the arbitrators in the first instance, the Court need not address the question here. "
914,6," It seems rather odd that plaintiffs, as the party seeking to compel arbitration, argue that their claim falls outside the scope of the 
arbitration agreement. One ordinarily would expect that the party opposing arbitration would argue that the dispute falls outside 
the arbitration agreement. The plaintiffs, however, appear to make the following argument: A claim for general injunctive relief 
falls outside the scope of the arbitration agreement because the agreement only permits the arbitrator to award relief in favor of 
an individual, and general injunctive relief does not qualify as such. The arbitration agreement, however, also requires 
 [**17] that all claims between the parties be submitted to arbitration. Therefore, the arbitration agreement purports to require an 
individual to waive any claims for general injunctive relief he or she might have. The applicable consumer-protection statute, 
however, provides an individual with the right to seek general injunctive relief. Accordingly, the argument continues, because an 
individual cannot be compelled to waive his or her statutory rights through an arbitration agreement, the provision limiting the 
scope of relief an arbitrator may award is unenforceable. Plaintiffs then presumably would argue that the offending provision is 
severable and that the remainder of the arbitration agreement should be enforced. "
915,7," Indeed, ATTM's arbitration agreement provided, ""All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, expect that issues relating to the 
scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide."" Smith, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125367, 2011 WL 
5924460, at *3. "
917,8," While a prior arbitration may serve under certain circumstances as a basis to foreclose later proceedings, see Boguslavsky v. 
Kaplan, 159 F.3d 715, 720 (2d Cir. 1998) (""[C]ollateral estoppel can be predicated on arbitration proceedings""), the absent 
Verizon customers, as non-parties to an individual arbitration, are unlikely to be precluded by the plaintiffs' arbitration from later 
asserting their own claims against Verizon. See Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 326 n.5, 99 S. Ct. 645, 58 L. Ed. 
2d 552 (1979)  [**28] (""Under the doctrine of res judicata, a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the 
same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action."" (emphasis added)); see also Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 
892, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2008) (""A person who was not a party to a suit generally has not had a 'full and fair 
opportunity to litigate' the claims and issues settled in that suit.""). It is true that in certain circumstances a nonparty to a prior suit 
may be precluded from litigating issues decided in the prior suit where the nonparty was ""'adequately represented by someone 
with the same interests'"" who was a party, Taylor, 553 U.S. at 894 (quoting Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793, 798, 
116 S. Ct. 1761, 135 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1996)), but even if that were the case here with respect to plaintiffs' claim for ""general 
injunctive relief,"" the complaint suggests that Verizon still would prospectively lower the price for the absent customers upon their 
request, even if plaintiffs' claim for ""general injunctive relief"" failed. "
918,9," The arbitration agreement in Kristian provided, ""IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS HAVE ANY 
LIABILITY FOR PUNITIVE, TREBLE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES."" 
Kristian, 446 F.3d at 44."
918,10," The court found that the damages waiver did not render the arbitration agreement unenforceable because of a ""savings 
clause"" that provided in substance, ""If the law does not permit waiver of a remedy, a plaintiff will still have that remedy, the 
[arbitration agreement's] liability limitation notwithstanding."" Kristian, 446 F.3d at 48."
918,11," The question of who should decide the enforceability of a class waiver—which the Second Circuit has held to be a question for 
the court, see Am. Express II, 634 F.3d at 191;  [**35] accord Kristian, 446 F.3d at 55—is not the same. Questions of arbitrability 
are those ""'challeng[ing] specifically the validity of the agreement to arbitrate.'"" Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson, 130 S. Ct. 
2772, 2778, 177 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2010) (quoting Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, 546 U.S. 440, 444, 126 S. Ct. 1204, 
163 L. Ed. 2d 1038 (2006)). And an arbitration agreement may be invalid if some term or terms in it renders the arbitral forum "
919,," inadequate by preventing a plaintiff from effectively vindicating his or her statutory rights. See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler 
Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 637, 105 S. Ct. 3346, 87 L. Ed. 2d 444 (1985). Here, plaintiffs contest the validity of the 
arbitration agreement's remedial limitation on the ground that it renders the arbitral forum inadequate by preventing plaintiffs 
from obtaining a specific statutory right (i.e. ""general injunctive relief""). Implicit in this argument is the notion that HN8[
] the 
arbitral forum is inadequate only if the conflict between the statutory right and the arbitration agreement is clear. If the conflict is 
ambiguous (whether because of contractual or legal ambiguity with respect to the specific statutory right, see Kristian, 446 F.3d 
at 46 n.15, 50), the alleged inadequacy of the  [**36] arbitral forum (and thus the alleged invalidity of the arbitration agreement) 
is speculative, and the strong federal policy favoring arbitration requires that the arbitrator resolve the ambiguity in the first 
instance. That is the crux of PacifiCare. By contrast, a class action/arbitration ban, if clear, implicates the adequacy of the arbitral forum (and thus the validity of the 
arbitration agreement) from the outset because it affects the manner in which a plaintiff may pursue his or her statutory rights in 
the first instance. As such, the adequacy of the arbitral forum (and thus the validity of the arbitration agreement) is implicated 
whenever there is a question of whether an inability to pursue statutory claims as a class amounts to an inability to pursue 
statutory claims at all. See Kristian, 446 F.3d at 54-55. This is a question for the court because, if left to the arbitrators in the first 
instance, it may never be addressed if indeed the class waiver effectively prevents the plaintiff from arbitrating at all. "
920,12," The language of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act is similarly unclear on the issue. With respect to remedies available, the 
statute states that a court must award treble damages and attorneys' fees, and may award ""any other appropriate legal or 
equitable relief."" N.J. Stat. Ann. § 56:8-19. There is little in the statutory language to determine whether ""appropriate"" equitable 
relief for an individual may include relief on behalf of absent parties. "
921,13," Section 350-e contains a private right of action materially identical to the private right of action in section 349(h). Section 350-e 
provides, ""Any person who has been injured by reason of any violation of section three hundred fifty or three hundred fifty-a of 
this article may bring an action in his or her own name to enjoin such unlawful act or practice."" N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 350-e. "
922,14," Such a waiver is necessary to allow a class action under section 349(h) because N.Y. C.P.L.R. section 901(b), which sets out 
the prerequisites for a class action suit, prohibits a plaintiff from bringing a class action ""to recover a penalty or minimum 
measure of recovery created or imposed by statute,"" unless the statute ""specifically authorizes the recovery thereof in a class 
action."" Because section 349(h) does not specifically authorize class actions and because under New York law treble damages 
are considered a penalty, see Leider, 387 F. Supp. 2d at 288, the waiver allows plaintiffs to comply with C.P.L.R. section 901(b). "
923,15," The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has rejected reading Gilmer essentially as an endorsement that class action 
waivers are not a ground for refusing to enforce an arbitration agreement when the plaintiff contends that the waiver interferes 
with his vindication of statutory rights. See Am Express II, 634 F.3d at 194-96. But this disfavored reading of Gilmer is not 
squarely implicated in this Court's suggestion that the attorney general's ability to seek relief that plaintiffs cannot is at least 
relevant in assessing whether New York law would permit plaintiffs to waive the right to seek that relief in the first instance."
923,16," In that regard, the consumer-protection statutes at issue here are somewhat different from statutes like California's Private 
Attorneys General Act (PAGA), ""the purpose of which 'is not to recover damages or restitution, but to create a means of 
""deputizing"" citizens as private attorneys general to enforce the Labor Code.'"" Nelson v. AT&T Mobility, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 92290, 2011 WL 3651153, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 18, 2011)  [**52] (quoting Brown v. Ralphs Grocery Co., 197 Cal. App. 
4th 489, 128 Cal. Rptr. 3d 854, 2011 WL 2685959, at *6 (Cal. Ct. App. 2011)). PAGA permits ""representative"" actions (which 
need not meet class action requirements), in which an individual sues on behalf of himself and other similarly situated 
employees seeking civil penalties against the employer for violations of the California Labor Code. Urbino v. Orkin Servs. of 
Calif., Inc.,     F. Supp. 2d    ,    , 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114746, 2011 WL 4595249, at *3-4 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 5, 2011). ""Under 
PAGA, of the civil penalties recovered by the aggrieved employees, 75 percent is allotted to the Labor and Workforce 
Development Agency ('LWDA') while 25 percent goes to the aggrieved employees."" 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114746, [WL] at *3. 
Accordingly, a waiver of the ability to proceed collectively under a statute like PAGA would seem more disruptive to the 
underlying public purpose of the statute than would a waiver of the right to obtain injunctive relief on behalf of others pursuant to 
a statute like New York General Business Law section 349(h) or the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, whose underlying 
purpose is both to provide relief to aggrieved individual consumers, as well as to provide a mechanism to stop consumer fraud. 
 [**53] It bears noting that in light of Concepcion, a number of federal district courts in California have enforced arbitration 
agreements with class and representative action waivers even though those waivers would prevent an individual from asserting 
representative PAGA claims. See Grabowski v. Robinson, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1159, 1180, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105680, 2011 
WL 4353998, at *19-20 (S.D. Cal. 2011); Quevedo v. Macy's, Inc., 798 F. Supp. 2d 1122, 2011 WL 3135052, at *17 (C.D. Cal. 
2011) (""[T]he Court concludes that Quevedo's PAGA claim is arbitrable, and that the arbitration agreement's provision barring 
him from bringing that claim on behalf of other employees is enforceable.""). But see Urbino, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 114746, 2011 
WL 4595249, at *11 (""Because the PAGA arbitration waiver in the Agreement is unconscionable, and the waiver taints the 
entirety of the Agreement with illegality, the Court deems the Agreement unenforceable.""). "

938,5," In Compucredit Corp. v. Greenwood, 132 S.Ct. 665, 181 L. Ed. 2d 586, 2012 WL 43517 (2012), the Supreme Court addressed 
whether the Credit Repair Organizations Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1679, et seq., precluded enforcement of an arbitration agreement. The 
Court concluded that because the Act is silent on whether claims brought under the Act can be arbitrated, the FAA requires that 
the arbitration agreement be enforced according to its terms. 181 L. Ed. 2d 586, Id. at *4 -* 6. To support its analysis, the Court 
cited to a number of statutes that ""restrict[] the use of arbitration. Id. Plaintiffs here do not allege that the Sherman Act expressly 
precludes arbitration or that it  [**24] expressly provides a right to bring collective or class actions, but instead argue that 
enforcement of the class arbitration waiver would effectively deprive them of their ability to vindicate their statutory rights. As aptly noted by Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in Compucredit, the majority's opinion does not ""hold that Congress must 
speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to preclude arbitration of statutory claims."" 181 L. Ed. 2d 586, Id. at *8. Indeed, 
HN8[
] the Supreme Court has ""on numerous occasions . . . held that proof of Congress' intent may also be discovered in the 
history or purpose of the statute in question."" 181 L. Ed. 2d 586, Id. at *8. Although the Sherman Act does not provide plaintiffs 
with an express right to bring their claims as a class in court, forcing plaintiffs to bring their claims individually here would make it 
impossible to enforce their rights under the Sherman Act and thus conflict with congressional purposes manifested in the 
provision of a private right of action in the statute. "
940,6," The  [**30] Amex plaintiffs do not proffer the argument rejected in Gilmer — namely, that the class action waiver in the Card

the instant appeal is more nuanced: whether the mandatory class action waiver in the Card Acceptance Agreement is 
enforceable even if the plaintiffs are able to demonstrate that the practical effect of enforcement of the waiver would be to 
preclude their bringing Sherman Act claims against Amex in either an individual or collective capacity."" Amex II, 634 F.3d at 196. "
948,1," As directed in the Court's Instructions to Parties and Counsel [49], on July 25, 2011, Plaintiffs emailed the Court a letter 
explaining the matters in dispute. Both Delta and AirTran responded via email letters. The letters (without exhibits) were filed on 
February 3, 2012 [294-301]. The Court notes that although the parties have stamped every document associated with this case 
""Confidential,"" there is nothing truly confidential about the contents of counsel's letters to the Court."
948,2," For more details about Plaintiffs'  [**6] claims, see In re Delta/AirTran Baggage Fee Antitrust Litigation, 733 F. Supp. 2d 1348 
(N.D. Ga. 2010). "
949,3," As discussed in the February 22 order on Plaintiffs' motion for spoliation sanctions, if Delta had imposed a litigation hold the 
day it received the DOJ's bag fee CID (February 2, 2009), the oldest back-up tape in its possession would have been from 
November 2008. See In re Delta/AirTran Baggage Fee Antitrust Litigation, 770 F. Supp. 2d 1299, 1306 (N.D. Ga. 2011). "
952,4," Delta's IT group is called the ""Computer Security and Investigative Response Team,"" or ""CSIRT."" It is housed in a separate 
building from Delta's counsel, approximately one mile away."
952,5," Apparently, that's really what it's called."
952,6," IBM delivered these tapes to CSIRT pursuant to a preservation instruction from Delta's law department in connection with the 
slots-swap investigation. "
953,7," Prior to the close of discovery on December 15, 2010, Delta had produced to Plaintiffs approximately 103,000 pages of 
documents. "
954,8," AirTran made a similar statement in its August 2 letter to the Court. It stated that ""[n]one of the newly produced documents 
[Plaintiffs] attach to their submission establishes, directly or indirectly, any communication between AirTran and Delta. Nor do 
they show any interaction at all between AirTran and Delta."" AirTran contends that the documents upon which Plaintiffs rely 
show that Delta, acting independently, was aware of (1) what other airlines had done, and (2) AirTran's public statements, and 
that those were among the many factors Delta considered after its merger with Northwest. Thus, AirTran asserts that these 
parallel actions by Delta are completely lawful. "
955,9," Plaintiffs state that they received 60,000 pages of documents and Delta contends that only 10,000 documents were produced. 
It is unclear whether the 10,000 documents produced by Delta are the same documents as the 60,000 pages Plaintiffs contend 
they received. "
956,10, Plaintiffs' discovery issues with AirTran are discussed at the end of this order.
956,11," Delta and AirTran object to the supplemental class certification brief. This, too, is addressed at the end of the order. "
957,12," These representations can be found on (1) pages 16, 24 and 27 of Delta's brief in response to Plaintiffs' spoliation motion 
[210]; (2) pages 2 and 4 of Delta's surreply brief to Plaintiffs' spoliation motion [272]; (3) pages 57, 58 and 66 of the November 8, 
2010 status conference transcript [200]; and pages 41, 42, 48, 61, 63, 64 and 66 of the spoliation motion hearing transcript 
[264]. "
960,13," As made clear throughout this Order, issues with document production have hounded Delta from the beginning of this litigation 
and since it received the DOJ's bag-fee CID. Nevertheless, Delta repeatedly represented to the Court and Plaintiffs that it had 
produced ""a full and complete record."" Time has proved those representations to be woefully inaccurate. "
961,14," Delta relies on R.W. International Corp. v. Welch Foods, Inc., 937 F.2d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1991), for the proposition that a district 
court's scheduling order is not a discovery order for purposes of subsection (b)(2). While the First Circuit did reject the 
defendants' argument that the general scheduling order qualified as an order providing for or permitting discovery, its decision 
was strongly influenced by the fact that the district court dismissed the case pursuant to subsection (b)(2). The sanction of 
dismissal is considered an extremely harsh sanction, and it is not one that Plaintiffs seek in this case. Consequently, the Court 
finds R.W. International inapposite. "
962,15," Review of Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f) and supporting case law suggests that Rule 16(f) is a more appropriate vehicle for seeking 
sanctions where a party has violated a scheduling order. See Guimaraes, 366 F. App'x at 54 (""Under Rule 16(f), a court may 
impose sanctions if a party or its attorney violates a scheduling order or other pretrial order, including a discovery order.""). 
However, the Court will not address Rule 16(f) sanctions, even though it could sua sponte, since  [**55] that subsection permits 
sanctions substantially similar to those permitted by Rule 37(c), which the Court finds applicable below. See Brooks, 837 F.2d at 
961 (stating that Rule 16(f) authorizes district court on motion or sua sponte to impose sanctions for failure to comply with 
scheduling or pretrial order). "
965,16," To be clear, the Court is awarding expenses and fees for (1) this motion, (2) the portion of the discovery period that must now 
be extended, and (3) Plaintiffs' motion for spoliation sanctions. "
966,17," As for Plaintiffs' ""pressing,"" on May 12, 2011 Plaintiffs asked, ""Has AirTran produced to Plaintiffs all of its correspondence with 
the DOJ?"" "
967,18," Nothing in Plaintiffs' document request or in this statement limits Plaintiffs' document request to correspondence with AirTran's 
in-house counsel. Thus, AirTran's contention in its August 23 letter that it ""had no obligation to produce to Plaintiffs its outside 
counsel's correspondence to the DOJ"" is without merit. "
969,19," The current letters before the Court do not indicate whether Delta or AirTran has specifically asked for Plaintiffs' 
communications with the DOJ, and only AirTran discusses the fact that Plaintiffs allegedly have not produced their own 
communications with the DOJ. Thus, neither side has addressed whether the rules permit or require Plaintiffs to produce these 
communications. "
976,1," A summary of the disputed discovery requests is attached as an exhibit to the declaration of Defendants' counsel, Mr. Jeffrey 
C. Bank (Dkt. 210 Ex. 1). The Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs dispute the accuracy of this summary and filed their own summary of 
the disputed discovery requests (Dkt. 220 Ex. 2 at 4-7). "

894 (10th Cir. 2011) (emphasis in original) (quoting City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Adver., Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 379-80, 111 S.

of Saab AB, audited financial documents of Saab Barracuda AB obtained from the Swedish government, and publicly available 
data about SBLLC's sales to CECOM, the United States Marine Corps, and other governmental entities. See Amended Compl., 
¶¶ 86-88. "
990,3," A court can only decide a Rule 12(b)(6) motion on the basis of the pleadings; if the court considers matters outside the 
pleadings, the court must convert the motion into one for summary judgment under Rule 56. See Kostrzewa v. City of Troy, 247 
F.3d 633, 643-44 (6th Cir. 2001); Weiner v. Klais & Co., 108 F.3d 86, 88 (6th Cir. 1997). Although the parties have attached 
some matters outside the pleadings, the parties both argue the matter solely as one relating to the sufficiency of plaintiff's 
amended complaint, not to the existence or lack thereof of any genuine issues of material fact. Thus, in the analysis which 
follows I consider only the allegations of the complaint under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, and do not consider the 
 [*15] documents submitted by the parties. Accordingly, the Court need not consider defendants' motion as one for summary 
judgment under Rule 56. See Hayden v. County of Nassau, 180 F.3d 42, 54 (2d Cir. 1999) (""Where . . . the court simply refers to 
supplementary material [in its recitation of the factual background of the case], but does not rely on them or use them as a basis 
for its decision, the 12(b)(6) motion is not converted into a motion for summary judgment.""); cf. Little Gem Life Servs., LLC v. 
Orphan Medical, Inc., 537 F.3d 913, 916 (8th Cir. 2008). "
992,4," At the outset, I note that GMA is wrong in suggesting that it need only allege that SBLLC ""had 'a reasonable expectation of 
recovery in the form of later monopoly profits, more than the losses suffered' to defeat the motion."" Pl.'s Br. in Supp. of Resp., at 
11 (quoting Spirit Airlines v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 431 F.3d 917, 948 (6th Cir. 2005)). The Sixth Circuit's quotation, however, 
is merely in its general description of the prerequisites for a predatory pricing claim, which may be brought either under the 
Robinson-Patman Act (alleging primary line price discrimination) or under § 2 of the Sherman Act (alleging monopolization or 
 [*24] attempted monopolization). The former is governed by the ""reasonable possibility"" standard, while the latter is governed 
by the ""dangerous probability standard,"" a point the Court made clear in Brooke Group and reiterated in subsequent cases. See 
Pacific Bell, 555 U.S. at 451; Weyerhaeuser Co., 549 U.S. at 319; Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 222 (quotations omitted) (""There 
are, to be sure, differences between the two statutes. For example, we interpret § 2 of the Sherman Act to condemn predatory 
pricing when it poses a dangerous probability of actual monopolization, whereas the Robinson-Patman Act requires only that 
there be a reasonable possibility of substantial injury to competition before its protections are triggered.""); id. at 224 (""The 
second prerequisite to holding a competitor liable under the antitrust laws for charging low prices is a demonstration that the 
competitor had a reasonable prospect, or, under § 2 of the Sherman Act, a dangerous probability, of recouping its investment in "
993,," below-cost prices.""). Because plaintiff brings its predatory pricing claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act, the claim must meet the 
""dangerous probability"" test. "
994,5," The fact that SBLLC raised its prices in subsequent bids is not sufficient to show recoupment or a dangerous probability of 
recoupment in the absence of any allegations that the increased price was supracompetitive. See Brooke Group, 509 U.S. at 
237 (""[A] price increase does not in itself permit a rational inference of . . . supracompetitive pricing.""). "
995,6," GMA argues that the court may not rely on this post-predation evidence, relying on the Fifth Circuit's statement in a prior case 
that in evaluating whether an attempt to monopolize had a dangerous probability of success the court may ""not rely on hindsight 
but [must] examine the probability of success at the time the acts occur."" United States v. American Airlines, Inc., 743 F.2d 1114, 
1118 (5th Cir. 1984). American Airlines and the Fifth Circuit's subsequent decision in Taylor Publ'g are not difficult to harmonize. 
American Airlines merely states the unremarkable proposition that a dangerous probability of success is measured as of the time 
of the predatory practice, and thus the fact that the scheme was unsuccessful alone does not defeat an attempted 
monopolization claim. Taylor Publ'g, however, recognizes that such evidence may be relevant, considered with other factors, to 
show that there was no dangerous probability of success at the time the predatory scheme  [*34] occurred. Cf. Brooke Group, 
509 U.S. at 233-38 (as part of inquiry into whether there was a reasonable possibility of recoupment, examining whether the 
conduct alleged ""in fact produced supracompetitive prices.""). In other words, evidence that SBLLC was not in fact able to charge 
a supracompetitive price does not by itself mean that there was not a dangerous probability that it would be able to do so at the 
time of the predatory pricing, but it does have the ""tendency to make the existence of"" that dangerous probability ""less probable 
than it would be without the evidence."" Fed. R. Evid. 401."
995,7," The parties devote significant attention to SBLLC's market share and barriers to entry in the ULCANS market. Although these 
factors are generally important in predatory pricing cases because they bear on the defendant's ability to secure a monopoly and 
thus charge a supracompetitive price, given the unique circumstances of this market the Court need not consider these factors. 
For the reasons explained above, even if SBLLC's market share and the barriers to entry in the market created a dangerous 
probability that SBLLC would achieve a monopoly, the fact that the market consisted of a single, monopsony buyer with "
996,," significant bargaining power as well as regulatory control over the market would make it unable to exercise monopoly power and 
recoup its investment in below-cost prices through the charging of supracompetitive prices. "
997,8," A number of cases also note that the parties stipulated to the governing law and assume that the stipulation is controlling, 
without discussing the matter in detail. See, e.g., National Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Emhart Corp., 11 F.3d 1524, 1528-29 (10th Cir. 
1993); Wagenheim v. Natural Science Indus., Ltd., No. 1:04CV0239, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73363, 2006 WL 2794790, at *3

1005,2," This Court denies Defendants' application to strike certain portions of Plaintiffs' Statement Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1(b). 
In resolving these motions, the Court does not consider Defendants' Joint Reply to Plaintiffs' 56.1(b) Response."
1005,3," In the interest of brevity, this Court does not summarize every piece of evidence offered by Plaintiffs. This Court has considered 
all of Plaintiffs' submissions. "
1019,1," To the extent that Adobe also relies on Brantley v. NBC Universal, Inc., 649 F.3d 1078, 2011 WL 2163961, at *5 (9th Cir. 
2011), this decision was withdrawn on October 31, 2011, and has no precedential value. "
1028,1," Plaintiff stated in its Reply Brief: ""Plaintiff no longer desires to pursue claims against Vistar Corporation and accordingly 
believes that its claims under Section 1 may be subject to dismissal."" (Doc. 51, p. 7). However, Plaintiff  [*3] has not formally 
dismissed Defendant Vistar Corporation from this action, nor has Vistar Corporation moved separately to dismiss Plaintiff's 
claims against it. Accordingly, for purposes of deciding Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or for Judgment on the Pleadings, Vistar 
Corporation shall be considered a Defendant in this lawsuit. "
1029,2," Plaintiff and Defendant GMCR were represented by counsel at this hearing, and both parties had the opportunity to present 
witnesses, introduce evidence, engage in oral argument, and fully brief the issues prior to the hearing. "
1030,3," Further, the claim is invalid on the merits pursuant to the Court's reasoning in Section ""E"" below, since Plaintiff lacks monopoly 
power and is not a monopolist. "
1031,4," The Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C.A. § 15, states that any person who is injured in his person or property through a violation of the 
antitrust laws is entitled to damages. "
1032,5," Plaintiff in its Response to the instant Motion asserts for the first time: ""since the filing of this action, additional facts have come 
to light, and Plaintiff believes that Defendants are liable to the Plaintiff for violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act because of 
the Defendants' illegal tying of the sale of Keurig brewers to the sale of K-cups."" (Doc. 51, p. 7). This new tying claim does not 
appear in the Amended Complaint and therefore will not be considered. "
1039,1," While TGR's motion states that it seeks dismissal of Count 6, TGR presents no arguments regarding that claim. TGR's reply 
clarifies that Count 6 is not in issue on TGR's present motion."
1039,2," TGR argues as an alternative ground for dismissal of Counts 1, 2, and 3 the lack of allegation by Timas and Ward that they 
paid a franchise fee. TGR contends that the reference by Timas and Ward to a monthly fee to access ""back room information"" "
1040,," cannot be read as going to any franchise fee. A franchise fee is ""any fee or charge that a franchisee . . . is required to pay or 
agrees to pay for the right . . . to continue a business under a franchise agreement."" Haw. Rev. Stat. § 482E-2. TGR notes that a 
fee for information is not included in the nonexclusive statutory list of fees that qualify as franchise fees. This argument by TGR 
may be better suited to a summary judgment motion than to a motion to dismiss. In any event, as the court dismisses Counts 1, 
2, and 3 or other grounds, it need not address this alternate ground. "
1055,1," 100% pass-through signifies that an intermediary charges its customers for the entire amount  [*31] of an increase in its costs. 
Pass-through rates may be higher than 100%. For example, if a retailer were always to set the price of a product at twice the 
price it purchased the product for, any increase in the price paid by the retailer would be doubled when the retailer sets its price, 
resulting in a 200% pass-through rate. "
1059,2," Indeed, it is unclear the extent to which Dr. Netz relies on the model for this purpose, given that it does not appear in the 
section of her expert report that addresses common impact to direct purchasers. See Netz Report at 28-87."
1059,3," As a corollary argument, defendants argue that Dr. Netz's methodology ""sweep[s] in an unacceptable number of uninjured 
plaintiffs."" Motion at 7 (quoting Graphics Processing, 253 F.R.D. at 504). They claim that: ""Even assuming that by 'vast majority 
of the time' Dr. Netz meant 99% of the time, and assuming, conservatively, 50 million members of the classes here, that leaves 
500,000 class members potentially eligible to collect treble damages although they suffered no injury whatsoever. If Dr. Netz 
meant '95% of the time,' that would amount to 2.5 million uninjured members of the class."" Id. Setting aside the implications of this argument — that class treatment is inappropriate because the injury in this case was too 
widespread — the Court declines to exclude Dr. Netz's opinion based upon one passing sentence in her deposition. Dr. Netz 
has opined that all class members were affected by the conspiracy. Netz Report at 87 (""I conclude that the higher prices borne 
by direct purchasers were passed on to class members . . .""). Defendants  [*49] may explore her deposition testimony on cross 
examination. "
1063,1," This court takes judicial notice of the documents filed with this Court as matters of public record. See Fed. R. Evid. 201; Lee v. 
City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688-689 (9th Cir. 2001). "
1066,2," Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) permits a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted 
to be filed before an answer. See Scott v. Kuhlmann, 746 F.2d 1377, 1378 (9th Cir. 1984). "
1067,3," If events were ""actually litigated"" in the prior suit, ""then the res judicata bar would have to expand to encompass those events 
and others that might have been litigated with them."" See L.A. Branch NAACP v. L.A. Unified School Dist., 750 F.2d 731, 740 
(9th Cir. 1984).  [*17] However, res judicata does not require the claim to have been actually litigated in the prior suit. See 
Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, 681 F.2d 1199, 1201 (9th Cir. 1982). Indeed, res judicata prevents ""an imaginative lawyer"" 
from relitigating old facts by ""attaching a different legal label."" Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional 
Planning Agency, 322 F.3d 1064, 1079 (9th Cir. 2003)."
1067,4," On April 4, 2011, this Court rendered a final judgment on the merits in the prior case 04-9049. See Order (04-9049 Dkt. 10704). 
Mattel's appeal of that decision does not impact the present analysis because ""a final judgment retains all of its res judicata 
consequences pending decision of the appeal."" See Tripati v. Henman, 857 F.2d 1366, 1367 (9th Cir. 1988)."
1067,5," Any dispute would indeed be unfounded given that Eckert is a senior employee of Mattel—a named party in MGA's prior 
litigation—and Eckert's conduct was the subject of MGA's prior claims. See  [*18] Adams v. Cal. Dep't of Health Servs., 487 
F.3d 684, 691 (9th Cir. 2007) (employees were parties in privity with corporation where corporation was prior suit's defendant 
and liability was premised on employee wrongdoing); Single Chip Sys. Corp. v. Intermec IP Corp., 495 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1064 
(S.D. Cal. 2007) (finding privity ""even if the named parties differ""). "
1068,6," This court takes judicial notice of the documents filed with this Court as matters of public record. See Fed. R. Evid. 201; Lee v. 
City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688-689 (9th Cir. 2001).  [*22] Defendants identified these documents in a useful chart in 
their briefing of the previous motion to dismiss. See Mot. to Dismiss Complaint (Dkt. 11) at 9-10; Reply (Dkt. 20) at 3, n.1."
1068,7," Instead, MGA argues that its antitrust claim arising from this litigation conduct was not ripe. The Court addresses this argument 
later in this Order. "
1069,8," MGA's Opposition does not identify these three instances of conduct as a basis to deny Defendants motion, nor does it discuss 
the cases or arguments made by Defendants in their Motion regarding this post-pleading conduct. Instead, a substantial part of 
MGA's Opposition simply copies verbatim the cases and arguments MGA listed in its FAC, neither of which addresses the 
relevant issue of what conduct constitutes a new acts  [*25] giving rise to a new antitrust injury. "
1071,9," As the Court has already explained, the three allegations of conduct occurring after MGA's pleadings on August 16, 2010, do 
not constitute new acts giving rise to a new antitrust injury. Thus, if these allegations are the ""continuing"" conduct to which the 
FAC refers, these allegations are not enough to prevent dismissal. "
1073,10," The term ""transaction"" in Rule 13(a) includes ""a series of occurrences."" Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., 417 U.S. 467, 469 
n.1, 94 S.Ct. 2504, 2506 n.1, 41 L. Ed. 2d 243 (U.S. 1974). "
1074,11," Regarding this exception, MGA's Opposition advances the same arguments that this Court found unconvincing when it 
previously dismissed the Original Complaint. "
1075,12," Although MGA does not argue that its current antitrust claim survives Rule 13(a) based on the three allegations of Defendants' 
litigation conduct after August 16, 2010, the same analysis this Court applied in this Order's res judicata discussion would lead to 
the conclusion that this conduct was not a new act creating a new antitrust injury. "
1077,13," Other Circuits have bemoaned how Mercoid ""effectively created an exception"" to the definition of a compulsory counterclaim 
""without acknowledging or explaining the exception."" Critical-Vac Filtration Corp. v. Minuteman Intern., Inc., 233 F.3d 697, 702 
(2d Cir. 2000). "
1085,1," Manufacturer Defendants are comprised of two groups of tobacco companies: three companies who were parties to the original 
Master Settlement  [**4] Agreement contested in this suit and thirteen companies who joined the settlement within ninety days of 
its execution. These companies include Lorillard Tobacco Co.; Philip Morris USA, Inc.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.; 
Commonwealth Brands, Inc.; Imperial Tobacco Limited/ITL; Japan Tobacco International USA, Inc.; King Maker Marketing, Inc.; 
Lane Limited; Liggett Group, LLC; Lignum-2, Inc.; P.T. Djarum; Premier Manufacturing, Inc.; Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co.; 
Sherman's 1400 Broadway N.Y.C., Inc.; Top Tobacco, LP; and Vector Tobacco, Inc."
1085,2," The Attorneys General represent forty-six states, four United States territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the 
District of Columbia. Jack Conway, the lead named defendant, is the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Kentucky."
1085,3," The agreement was originally executed by eight state Attorneys General. Other states joined the MSA by initiating similar 
litigation against the tobacco companies in their states' courts and subsequently moving the courts to approve their agreed-upon 
entry into the MSA and dismiss their claims with prejudice. "
1087,4," Although the court did not address the merits of the Sherman Act claims, it did note that, with respect to the LMFN waiver 
claim, ""it is not actually clear that the wrong alleged even falls within the scope of the Sherman Act."" VIBO Corp., 594 F. Supp. 
2d at 775 n.13. Because we agree that Manufacturer Defendants are immune from Plaintiff's antitrust claims, we similarly 
decline to address the merits of these claims. "
1088,5," Plaintiff also argues that the LMFN clause essentially granted veto power to the PMs in determining whether Plaintiff and 
Attorneys General Defendants could effectuate the AAA and that the PMs persuaded or coerced the Attorneys General to reject 
the AAA. We find no such power founded in the LMFN clause or the MSA, in general. Moreover, Plaintiff admitted that 
Manufacturer Defendants have ""invoked"" their LMFN rights on prior occasions, but that Attorneys General Defendants ignored 
the Manufacturer Defendants' petitioning  [**18] in those instances. Plaintiff thus partially recognizes that only Attorneys General 
Defendants hold the decision-making power. "
1090,6," When the district court ruled on the parties' motions, it was uncertain whether Plaintiff had also raised a Sherman Act violation 
claim against Attorneys General Defendants. The court found that, to the extent a claim was brought against the states, the 
states were immunized. During appellate argument, however, Plaintiff's counsel clarified that it had not brought antitrust claims 
against Attorneys General Defendants. Our analysis of the state-action doctrine as applied to Manufacturer Defendants requires 
that we consider whether the states are entitled to state-action immunity, but we do so only to adjudicate the antitrust claims 
against Manufacturer Defendants. "
1092,7," Plaintiff also claims that MSA Section XV only waives First Amendment claims because the original litigation preceding the 
MSA involved advertising restrictions. This claim is utterly without merit, as the waiver language clearly  [**30] provides for ""any 
and all claims that the provisions of this Agreement violate the state or federal constitutions"" and does not signal that it applies 
only to First Amendment claims. MSA Section XV (emphasis added). HN15[
] We look only to the plain language of the 
agreement to determine the parties' intent. Abney, 215 S.W.3d at 703."
1092,8," Our reading of the waiver provision does not require that we interpret the phrase ""act or refrain from acting"" within Section XV. 
However, we note that the district court's interpretation of ""requirements that Plaintiff act or refrain from acting"" to mean ""any 
provision that affects Plaintiff's performance"" appears  [**33] too broad based on a reading of the provision's plain language. "
1093,9," These allegations also form the basis of Plaintiff's fraudulent inducement claim, analyzed infra. "
1094,10," We note that the MSA would have permitted  [**37] the jurisdiction of the Franklin Circuit Court of the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky on Plaintiff's fraud claim. MSA Section VII permits jurisdiction of the ""Court"" over disputes, and Section II(p) defines 
""Court"" as the court in each settling state where the consent decree was presented for approval. In this case, Kentucky's 
consent decree was entered by the Franklin Circuit Court on December 21, 1998. Kentucky's consent to jurisdiction in the 
Franklin Circuit Court obviously does not extend to the federal district court in Kentucky. "
1096,1, This Court dismissed Defendant's state law claims in a previous order. 
1106,1," Dr. Guinn refers to his claim as one for tortious interference with ""contract"" but alleges facts that support a claim that 
Defendants interfered with his business relationships. Additionally, in his Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' Second 
Motion to Dismiss he argues that Defendants interfered with his business relationships. Thus, the Court, as did Defendants, 
accepts the claim as one for interference with business relationships."
1106,2," In Dr.Guinn's Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants' First Motion to Dismiss, he sets out a now defunct standard, i.e., this 
Court may dismiss a ""complaint 'only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved 
consistent with the allegations.'"" (Doc. 63 at 17) (quoting Nilvar, M.D. v. Mercy Health System Western Ohio, 142 F. Supp. 2d 
859, 867 (S.D. Ohio 2000)). That language is taken from Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 
(1957), which stated that a complaint ""should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that 
the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support  [*9] of his claim which would entitle him to relief."" Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 
45-46, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). As the Sixth Circuit has explained, however, that the Supreme Court has disavowed 
that language: In [Twombly], the Court disavowed the oft-quoted Rule 12(b)(6) standard of Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S. Ct. 
99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957) (recognizing ""the accepted rule that a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a 
claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle "
1107,," him to relief""), characterizing that rule as one ""best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading 
standard."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 563. Ass'n of Cleveland Fire Fighters v. City of Cleveland, Ohio, 502 F.3d 545, 548 (6th Cir. 2007). The Court notes that, although Dr. 
Guinn set forth the incorrect standard, he does not improperly rely on that standard, and instead correctly argues that he has 
stated plausible claims for relief."
1107,3," ""HN7[
] Harm to the antitrust plaintiff is sufficient to satisfy the constitutional standing requirement of injury in fact, but the 
court must make a further determination whether the plaintiff is a proper party to bring a private antitrust action."" Assoc. Gen. "
1108,," Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 535, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983); 
 [*13] see also Bodie-Rickett & Assocs. v. Mars, Inc., 957 F.2d 287 (6th Cir. 1982) (setting forth the factors to be balanced in 
such an analysis). In their motion, however, Defendants do not dispute that Dr. Guinn has sufficiently alleged that he is the 
proper party to bring this action. "
1111,4," The United States Supreme Court held in Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 510, 122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 
(2002),  [*27] the HN13[
] prima facie case ""is an evidentiary standard, not a pleading requirement."" The Court reviews the prima facie case standard in the Rule 12(b)(6) context to determine whether a plaintiff has given the defendant fair notice of his 
or her claim and the grounds upon which it rests—not to determine if the standard is met. "
1117,1," In the November 21 order, the Court set out in detail the case's factual background and the parties' claims and defenses. The 
Court will not repeat them here."
1117,2," The defendants in this case are (1) Travelport Limited and Travelport, LP (collectively, ""Travelport""); (2) Sabre Inc., Sabre 
Holdings Corporation, and Sabre Travel International Limited (collectively, ""Sabre""); and Orbitz Worldwide, LLC (""Orbitz""). For 
the sake of brevity and clarity, in the text of this order, the Court will use the shorthand names of the defendants without first 
setting out their full names. "
1119,3," To be clear, in all other respects, the Court's dismissal of count four with prejudice remains undisturbed. "
1122,1," A planogram is ""essentially a diagram showing where specific products are to be positioned in the space allotted by a retail 
store for a particular category of products."" Second Amended Counterclaim (""SAC""), Docket No. 68, ¶ 6. The Court will refer to 
C&D's planogram rebate program as its POG program. "
1123,2," FMDx refers to all retailers in the FDM channel except Wal-Mart, while FDM refers to the entire channel including Wal-Mart. 
There is not as much data available on Wal-Mart's sales as for other retailers because Wal-Mart does not report to certain data-
gathering companies. "
1124,3," A ""facing"" refers to one column of product seen on a retail shelf. For example, if a customer looks at a shelf and sees five 
boxes of a product sitting side by side, those are five ""facings."" Sometimes, a popular product may be ""double faced"" so that two 
columns are dedicated to the same product, thus ensuring twice the amount of in-store stock available for purchase."
1124,4, C&D considers the left-hand side of a planogram to be the premium space. Mayer does not dispute this assessment. 
1125,5," It is undisputed that Wal-Mart has no POG contract with C&D. See Baseman Report at 12-13. However, Mayer's expert opines 
that Wal-Mart may be a de facto participant, based on certain internal C&D documents indicating that Wal-Mart dedicates a 
certain percentage of space to C&D. Id. However, C&D employees state unequivocally that Wal-Mart does not commit to the 
POG program, and C&D's charts do not list Wal-Mart as receiving a POG rebate. See Wright Report Attachment 11B. Instead, 
C&D lists Wal-Mart as receiving a 2.1% cash promotion and 21.1% promotional discount off of gross invoice. Id. This is similar to 
the lump-sum discounts allotted to other non-POG retailers, like Costco. Id. Mayer's expert also notes that C&D has sometimes 
negotiated discounts with Wal-Mart on the basis that Wal-Mart will add new C&D SKUs without subtracting others. Baseman 
Report at 14. Such negotiations are more akin to the promotional tools described above and employed by all manufacturers. In 
addition, none of Mayer's anecdotal evidence regarding its and other  [**14] small manufacturers' dealings with Wal-Mart 
indicates that a shelf-space agreement with C&D was responsible for their difficulty getting a Wal-Mart deal. See, e.g., [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT] Decl. ¶¶ 106-07 ( [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] condom brand pitched Wal-Mart but was 
turned down because it was not a national brand); Mayer Depo. at 62-64 (Mayer pitched Wal-Mart but was turned down because 
it was not a national brand). The Court concludes Mayer has failed to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Wal-Mart has a 
POG contract — the record evidence establishes it does not. "
1128,6," Indeed, Mayer's counterclaim lists C&D's performance within the c-store chain and its exclusive contract with 7-Eleven as part 
of its antitrust claims, though it now seeks to exclude c-stores from the market entirely. See SAC ¶ 11."
1128,7," This, of course, also begs the question whether consumers could avoid a price increase in the c-store channel by purchasing 
their products in the food, drug, or mass channels. "
1131,8," See Mayer Depo. at 166 (stating that c-stores' ""pricing structure is such that we don't choose to compete."")."
1131,9," Although the Rebel Oil court conducts this analysis in the context of a § 2 attempted monopolization claim, it explicitly adopts 
the same analysis with respect to a § 1 claim. Rebel Oil, 51 F.3d at 1444 (""[F]or the same reasons that we stated in our analysis 
of Rebel's claim under Sherman Act § 2, Rebel's evidence is insufficient for a jury reasonably to conclude that ARCO possesses 
market power, or is dangerously close to obtaining it, under § 1.""). "
1134,10," Flexibility in defining market powers seems particularly warranted in light of the fact, discussed below, that monopoly power — 
which is narrower than market power — may in some instances be inferred from dominant market share. The Court must 
examine the economic realities of the particular  [**54] situation. "
1135,11," In Reynolds, the court rejected such a theory on the basis that other entities besides defendants had successfully competed 
for the same merchandising space, and some had also obtained space in excess of their market share. Id. Reynolds also 
considered the fact that many firms made concessions to retailers in order to secure their desired merchandising agreements as 
evidence that weighed against a finding of market power. Id. at 382. "
1137,12," C&D argues separately that the Ninth Circuit created a safe harbor for short duration contracts such as its planogram 
agreements. See Reply at 18 (citing Omega, 127 F.3d at 1163 (""[T]he short duration and easy terminability of these agreements 
negate substantially their potential to foreclose competition.""). However, while Omega, like Allied, highlighted short duration as 
an element in favor of a challenged contract, it does not appear to create any safe harbor as a matter of law for such contracts."
1137,13," Indeed, given Allied's and Omega's focus on potential alternative channels of distribution, the Court's focus on existing 
alternatives within retail stores is  [**65] conservative. For example, CVS's buyer indicated that internet sales, on which the 
parties do not substantially focus, are a potential alternative channel that may be uniquely suited to small rivals attempting to 
gain a foothold in the market. See Martineau Depo. at 82 (indicating that she sometimes puts a new item on CVS.com to monitor 
its sales before deciding whether to carry it in the store); id. at 91-92 (indicating that a new condom product had received 
placement on CVS.com to evaluate its potential in-store sales). "
1138,14," For example, one could offer a 7% rebate on purchases above a certain level, rather than a 7% rebate on all purchases back 
to the first dollar once a retailer reaches a certain level. "
1139,15," In 2009, the lowest available tier was 70% of shelf space. "
1140,16," Meijer has a special contract to keep its 55% planogram participation, which is apparently not offered to other retailers."
1140,17, SKU refers to a stock-keeping unit.
1140,18," Moreover, C&D points out that in the case of Target, the reason for the aberration was its acceptance of a two brand strategy 
promoted by Durex, an event unconnected to the POG program. "
1141,19," Indeed, C&D supports its claim that Mayer's high prices are at least partially responsible for its limited success by offering 
evidence that its 2004  [**81] ""buy-one-get-one-free promotion at Longs quadrupled Mayer's sales. Wright Report at 132. In 
contrast, the record is replete with internal Mayer documents bemoaning the fact that buyers complain about high prices. See, 
e.g., Mayer Depo. at 174, C&D Exs. 44-51, 54-56. "
1143,20," Mr. Baseman seems to acknowledge the speculative nature of his foreclosure calculation, as he describes the foreclosure rate 
in terms of the percentage of retailers that were ""likely incentivized"" by the POG. Yet all discounts offered by competitors ""likely 
incentivize"" buyers to buy more of the discounted product. That is the point of discounts. The question is not whether the POG 
""likely incentivized"" retailers to choose C&D products, but whether it foreclosed competition. "
1144,21," Indeed, the court even voiced concern that the ""exclusive"" contracts still did not foreclose competition because 
 [**91] ""Retailers generally carry manufacturers' products in these stores even though they do not have merchandising contracts 
in these stores. Furthermore, Plaintiffs are free to negotiate merchandising contracts with these stores."" Id. at 390 n. 20."
1144,22," 22% of C&D's sales derive from the c-store channel. Wright Report at 51. 28% of its sales derive from Wal-Mart. Wright 
Report Attachment 2. 1% of its sales derive from Sam's Club. Id. This leaves 49% of C&D revenues which derive from all other 
retailers, which the Court will label FDMx for simplicity's sake even though it also includes a small portion from dollar stores and 
club stores. Of those revenues in the FDMx channel, 90% of C&D's FDMx revenues derive from POG retailers. Thus, 
approximately 44.1% of C&D revenues (90 X 49) derive from POG participants. 44.1% (POG sales) + 22% (c-store sales) = 
66.1% of C&D revenues that derive from some form of exclusive or semi-exclusive agreement."
1144,23," 72% is the highest average shelf share, reflecting data from 2009. It is thus a high water mark for the POG program."
1144,24," 60% is again a high water mark, as Mr. Wright calculates C&D's c-store market share at 50-60%."
1144,25, 44.1% × 72% = 31.8%. 22% × 60% = 13.2%. 31.8% + 13.2% = 45%.
1144,26," 92% of FDMx sales are from POG retailers (Baseman Report Table 2) × 56.1% of condom market is FDMx retailers = 51.6% 
of the condom market that is POG retailers."

1144,28," This final method uses the  [**94] data for revenue share to determine what percentage of the condom market is occupied by 
POG retailers and c-stores. Yet another alternative method would be to use the percentage of unit sales to calculate each 
segment's market share. These percentages are different because each channel uses somewhat different pricing (e.g., 
drugstores charge higher retail prices, so they have a greater revenue share than unit share in the condom market). Using unit 
share would arguably yield a more accurate rate for purposes of this case because it would calculate the total percentage of 
condom units sold that are attributable to the POG or c-stores. Under this method, 45% of the condom market is occupied by 
POG retailers. See Wright Report Attachment 1 (49% of unit sales are from FDMx retailers); Baseman Report Table 1 (92% of 
FDMx retailers are POG retailers). Since C&D contracts for an average shelf share of 72% in POG retailers, the foreclosure rate 
due to the POG would be 32.4%. In the c-store channel, c-stores account for 14.9% of condom unit sales. Wright Report "
1145,," Attachment 1. Since C&D has an average 60% share of the c-store channel, the foreclosure rate due to the c-store contracts 
would be  [**95] 8.9%. Thus, the total foreclosure rate using this method would be 41.3%, lower than any of the above-
calculated rates. "
1152,29," In its summary judgment papers, Mayer offered neither evidence nor argument to rebut C&D's contention that it labels its 
condoms ""Made in Japan"" because they are, in fact, made in Japan. Accordingly, the Court finds that Mayer has abandoned any 
claim against C&D based on the designation of certain condoms as ""Made in Japan."" "
1158,1," Because this case is presently before the Court on motions to dismiss, the Court sets forth the facts taking as true all well-
pleaded allegations in the Second Amended Complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. See 
Morales-Tanon v. P.R. Elec. Power Auth., 524 F.3d 15, 17 (1st Cir. 2008). "

1163,3," Shirokov argues that the Court may also consider materials outside of the Complaint in connection with the defendants' motion 
to dismiss on the basis of subject-matter jurisdiction (standing). (Docket No. 66 at 9-10). However, none of the challenged 
materials have any relevance to the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction. As such, the Court does not consider them for that 
purpose. In addition, the Court finds that none of the exceptions regarding the prohibition against considering materials outside 
the Complaint in connection with a Rule 12(b)(6)  [*20] motion apply to the challenged materials. See Nollet, 83 F. Supp. 2d at 
208. "
1164,4," Shirokov also asserts claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (""CFAA""), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1030, et seq. (Count 4). 
However, the CFAA does not authorize nationwide service of process. Id.; see US Bioservices Corp. v. Lugo, No. 08-2342-JWL, 
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85862, 2008 WL 4747473, at *1 (D. Kan. Oct. 23, 2008). "

1169,6," Although the Court finds that GuardaLey is not subject to personal jurisdiction in this Court, the Court also addresses 
GuardaLey's motion to dismiss based on the merits of Shirokov's claims should the District Judge disagree with this Court's 
conclusion regarding personal jurisdiction. "
1171,7," At oral argument, the parties confirmed that Shirokov has not been named or otherwise identified as a defendant in the Achte 
Lawsuit, which was  [*50] filed almost two years ago."
1171,8," In determining whether a plaintiff has standing, a court is required to look at the facts as they existed at the time when the 
lawsuit was filed. Keene Corp. v. United States, 508 U.S. 200, 207, 113 S. Ct. 2035, 124 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1993); Lujan, 504 U.S. 
at 571 n. 4. "
1173,9," It is not clear whether Massachusetts law applies to Shirokov's claims. Other than the fact that Shirokov is a Massachusetts 
resident and presumably received the Letter in Massachusetts, the conduct of which he complains did not occur here. Shirokov's 
claims involve alleged conduct by Virginia lawyers in connection with the Achte Lawsuit pending in the United States District 
Court for the District of Columbia. Although the plaintiff has briefly referenced this issue (see Docket No. 32 at 14, n. 13), neither 
he nor any of the defendants have engaged in a choice of law analysis. Normally, the first step in applying choice of law "
1174,," principles is to ascertain whether the choice will affect the outcome; in other words, whether there is an actual conflict of laws. 
See Williams v. Astra USA, Inc., 68 F. Supp. 2d 29, 36 (D. Mass. 1999). None of the parties have raised the substantive law of 
any jurisdiction other than Massachusetts. Given that the parties  [*62] did not raise a conflict-of-laws issue, it is deemed that 
none exists. Id.; see also Doricent v. Am. Airlines, Inc., No. 91-12084Y, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15143, 1993 WL 437670, at *8 
(D. Mass. Oct. 19, 1993)."
1174,10," The Massachusetts Appeals Court's statement in Doe, supra, that the litigation privilege applies even if a communication is in 
bad faith applies only in cases where the litigation is already underway. See Meltzer, 193 F. Supp. 2d at 379-80. In Doe, the 
Appeals Court was dealing with a particular scenario in which the allegedly offending letter was written by an attorney for the 
defendants  [*63] in reply to a letter from plaintiff demanding relief and threatening litigation if relief was not forthcoming. 41 
Mass. App. Ct. at 141. What the Appeals Court seems to have been saying is that in such situations, the reply is not subject to 
the test of whether the defendant was contemplating litigation in good faith and that litigation was under serious consideration. 
Rather, the test which is applies is the test applicable during the course of litigation, i.e., whether the communication was 
pertinent to the proceedings, or, in that case, pertinent to the demand which was made. Id."
1174,11," Even if the privilege applied, there remains an issue as to whether the privilege would bar anything more than Shirokov's state 
law causes of action. The Dunlap Defendants argue that all claims are barred. They further argue that the principle that a state 
privilege cannot bar a federal cause of action is limited to Fair Debt Collection Practices (""FDCPA"") claims. See Docket No. 71 at 
3. However, a number of cases undercut the Dunlap Defendants' arguments and refuse to apply state privileges to federal "
1175,," claims besides FDCPA claims. See, e.g., Steffes v. Stepan Co., 144 F.3d 1070, 1074 (7th Cir. 1998) (citations omitted) (""A state 
absolute litigation privilege purporting to confer immunity from suit cannot defeat a federal cause of action""); Kimes v. Stone, 84 
F.3d 1121, 1127 (9th Cir. 1996) (holding that the California absolute litigation privilege does not immunize attorneys from liability 
under 42 U.S.C. § 1983); Conditioned Ocular Enhancement, Inc. v. Bonaventura, 458 F. Supp. 2d 704, 708 (N.D. Ill. 2006) 
(Illinois litigation privilege cannot confer immunity against Lanham Act claims). "
1176,12," Shirokov cites these cases, along with ResDev, LLC v. Lot Builders Ass'n, Inc., No. 6:04-cv-1374, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
19099, at *10-12 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 10, 2005) for the proposition  [*70] that although ""attorneys' fees in prosecuting a CFAA action 
do not count toward the $5,000 statutory threshold . . . attorneys' fees incurred responding to the CFAA violation do."" (Docket 
No. 32 at 32 n. 54) (emphasis in original). These cases do not support Shirokov's argument. On the contrary, they all emphasize 
that a loss under the CFAA must be related to the computer itself."
1176,13," Because the Court finds that Shirokov has failed to plead enough facts to support a loss or damage under the CFAA, it is not 
necessary to address whether the conduct alleged constitutes access without authorization or exceeding authorization under the 
CFAA. "
1177,14," In addition, although the Dunlap Defendants moved to dismiss the entire Complaint on the basis of standing, the Noerr-
Pennington Doctrine, and the litigation privilege, the Dunlap Defendants did not move to dismiss the fraud and fraudulent 
omissions/nondisclosure claims (Counts 1 and 2) on the basis that they fail to state a claim. "
1178,15," In his opposition to GuardaLey's motion to dismiss, Shirokov requests leave to amend the Complaint ""as needed"" to 
incorporate recent information that he alleges provides sufficient basis for GuardaLey's liability ""if this court  [*79] deems it 
necessary."" (Docket No. 56 at 24). The Court notes that Shirokov has twice amended his Complaint in this action, and that he 
could have amended it as of right within 21 days of GuardaLey's filing of its motion to dismiss. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). In 
any event, there is no present motion to amend the Complaint and all that is before this Court are certain specified motions."
1178,16," Although Achte states in its motion that all claims related to misrepresentations and omissions, including Counts 1 and 2 of the 
Complaint fail to state a claim, it provides no basis for the dismissal of the fraudulent misrepresentation claims. (Docket No. 48 at 
21). It simply states that it ""adopts and incorporates herein the additional grounds for dismissal of the misrepresentation and 
omission claims that are presented in Part III(G) of DGW's Memorandum of Law (Document No. 29 at pp. 24-26)."" Id. However, 
DGW and the Dunlap Defendants did not move to dismiss Counts 1 and 2 on the basis that they fail to state a claim. At oral 
argument, counsel for the Dunlap Defendants suggested that they did not move to dismiss Counts 1 and 2 because of the 
twenty-page limit on legal briefs. However, the District Court granted them  [*81] leave to file a brief in support of their motion to 
dismiss of thirty-five pages. (Docket No. 25). Under the circumstances, thirty-five pages was more than sufficient to set forth any 
arguments in support of their motion to dismiss, including any arguments regarding Counts 1 and 2. In the alternative, the 
Dunlap Defendants could have asked the District Court for a longer page limit. "
1179,17," Although Shirokov alleges that all of the defendants ""made knowingly false statements in court concerning the copyright, the 
remedies available to Achte, and/or the basis for Achte's claims of jurisdiction over members of the Class, including Shirokov"" 
(Complaint at ¶ 386), this is no more than a formulaic recitation of the elements of the cause of action in Count 13. Despite very 
detailed factual allegations  [*83] in the rest of the Complaint with respect to the other defendants, Shirokov did not allege 
anywhere in the Complaint what false statements were made by GuardaLey. Again, other than the allegation that GuardaLey 
tracked the IP addresses of alleged infringers and provided that information to the other defendants, Shirokov has not made any 
factual allegations supporting GuardaLey's involvement in the alleged copyright scheme. See Iqbal, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 
(""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.""). "
1180,18," Although Shirokov argues that the attorneys' fees incurred in this action are an injury sufficient to confer Article III standing (an 
argument that this Court rejected), he does not argue that attorneys' fees in this action are sufficient to satisfy the RICO injury 
requirement. In any event, such an argument would also be wrong. See, e.g., Walter v. Palisades Collection, LLC, 480 F. Supp. 
2d 797, 805 (E.D. Pa. 2007)  [*90] (citation omitted) (""It would be illogical to allow a plaintiff to have RICO standing based on 
damages incurred by the plaintiff in paying his attorney to file the RICO action. RICO's injury requirement would be a nullity if 
paying an attorney to initiate the RICO action itself sufficed as damage."")."
1180,19," Shirokov cites this case as supporting his argument that the legal fees he spent in investigating the defendants' claims are 
sufficient to satisfy the RICO injury requirement. (Docket No. 32 at 34; Docket No. 77 at 13). In Lemelson, the Court found that 
the costs incurred in investigating and defending vexatious litigation constitute a sufficient RICO injury to survive a motion to 
dismiss. 874 F.Supp. at 433. However, that case is distinguishable. First, the parties were competitors and the expenditure of 
attorneys' fees by the victim was an intended consequence of the alleged racketeering scheme. Id. at 432-33. Here, the "
1181,," expenditure of attorneys' fees is not an intended consequence, but a byproduct, of the defendants' alleged scheme: the intended 
consequence was the payment of settlements to the defendants. (Complaint at ¶¶ 324-325). There are no allegations that the 
object of the defendants'  [*91] action was the expenditure of legal fees. The object of the alleged scheme was the payment of 
settlement amounts. Second, that case was decided prior to Iqbal under the more lenient Rule 12(b)(6) standard of Conley v. 
Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 78 S. Ct. 99, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80 (1957). Id. at 433 (""I hold that the costs incurred in investigating and defending 
that litigation are a sufficient RICO injury to satisfy the indulgent pleading requirements of Rule 12(b)(6)."")."
1181,20," Although the Letter encourages class members to obtain legal representation, the object of the scheme was not the incursion 
of legal fees by class members. (Complaint, ¶¶ 324-25; Ex. N to Complaint)."
1181,21," Although this Court has found that Shirokov has alleged an injury sufficient to confer him standing under Article III of the 
Constitution (see Section III(B)(2) above) and an injury sufficient to state a Chapter 93A claim (see Section III(B)(14) below), the 
RICO statute sets forth additional requirements for a showing of injury. See DeMauro v. DeMauro, 115 F.3d 94, 96 (1st Cir. 
1997) (""There is plainly a case or controversy under Article III; but the statutory precondition of injury to business or property 
must also be met.""); In re Neurontin Mktg. and Sales Practices Litig., 677 F. Supp. 2d 479, 497 (D. Mass. 2010)  [*92] (""A 
showing of injury is generally necessary for the purposes of Article III standing . . ., but the RICO statute sets forth additional 
requirements for a showing of injury.""). "
1182,22," In that case, the plaintiff obtained an ex parte attachment order against the debtor's property in attempts to garnish assets of 
the debtor in the hands of a third party. 779 F.2d at 896. The plaintiff alleged that its rights to enforce the judgment against the 
debtor were lost because the garnishee falsely denied holding any of the debtor's property. Id. As a result, when the plaintiff 
moved to confirm the attachment, the district court denied the motion. The plaintiff then filed an action against the defendant 
claiming that defendant's failure to reveal debtor's property in its hands was a damaging lie constituting fraud on the court and 
causing it damage. Id. The Second Circuit reversed the district court's order dismissing the action and remanded the case for an 
evidentiary hearing to examine whether the defendant's garnishee statement was fraudulent. Id. at 901. If so, the district court 
was free to enter a judgment in the amount plaintiff would have obtained if the defendant had filed an accurate statement. 
 [*95] Id."
1182,23," Although that case states that fraud on the court may be an independent cause of action, this Court declines to follow it. "
1183,24," In addition, the Court notes that Shirokov seeks a declaration of invalidity based on copyright misuse, which is not available to 
him under such a claim. Amaretto Ranch Breedables, LLC, 790 F. Supp. 2d at 1033. "
1185,25," Shirokov's claim in this respect is wrong, particularly because he is the only named plaintiff. At this stage of the litigation, the 
District Court must dismiss his claims if he has not stated a cause of action on his own right. See Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 
  672F.3d 64, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 4024 , 2012 WL 612793, at * 3 (1st Cir. 2012) (citation omitted) (""Because no class was 
certified below, we evaluate only whether the plaintiff herself has constitutional and statutory standing to pursue the action."");

nature of the matter, for the purposes  [*105] of assessing the pending motion to dismiss, 'the potential claims of putative class 
members other than the named plaintiff are simply not before the court.'"") (citations omitted); Simonet v. Smithkline Beecham 
Corp., 506 F. Supp. 2d 77, 81 (D.P.R. 2007) (""A named plaintiff who cannot establish her own case may not seek relief on behalf 
of other class members."") (citations omitted); Evans v. Taco Bell Corp., No. 04CV103JD, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20997, 2005 WL 
2333841, at * 4 (D.N.H. Sept. 23, 2005) (""To be sure, [plaintiff] has filed the case as a putative class action ... But unless and 
until the court certifies such a class, the potential claims of putative class members other than the named plaintiff are simply not 
before the court."") (citations omitted). "
1186,26," The statute defines trade and commerce as: . . . the advertising, the offering for sale, rent or lease, the sale, rent, lease or distribution of any services and  [*111] any 
property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, any security . . . and any contract of sale of a commodity for future 
delivery, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value wherever situate, and shall include any trade or commerce 
directly or indirectly affecting the people of this commonwealth. M.G.L. c. 93A, § 1(b)."
1186,27," Shirokov argues that not all defendants are attorneys and therefore may not avail themselves of this argument. (Docket No. 32 
at 33, 43). "
1193,1," Plaintiff claims that Defendant failed to furnish him with information about the servicing of the Loan pursuant to the Real Estate 
Settlement and Procedures Act (""RESPA""), 12 U.S.C. § 2605(e). However, Plaintiff was never a party to the Loan and 
Defendant owed him no duty under RESPA. Therefore, Plaintiff cannot allege a relationship that would support a claim for an 
accounting in this way. "
1202,*," The Honorable Thomas L. Ludington, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation. "
1203,1," As this case was pending, Carrier reached a settlement agreement with both of the Mueller entities. Thus, in accordance with 
Sixth Circuit Rule 33(b) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b), Mueller Industries, Inc. and Mueller Europe LTD 
have been dismissed from this appeal. Carrier Corp. v. Outokumpu Oyj, Nos. 07-6052, 07-6114 (6th Cir. Nov. 15, 2011) 
(unpublished orders). Cases Nos. 07-6115 and 07-6116 have also been dismissed. (6th Cir. Nov. 10, 2011) (unpublished order)."
1203,2," On appeal, Carrier has limited its claims to purchases made within the United States. Carrier Br. 1 at 23 n.2. "
1204,3," Outokumpu also argues that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the alleged conspiracy did not have a 
""direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect"" on United States commerce as is required under the Foreign Trade 
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1992 (""FTAIA""). 15 U.S.C. § 6a. HN1[
] The FTAIA, however, specifically exempts from its reach "
1205,," ""import commerce"" with foreign entities. Id. According to F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 162, 124 
S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226 (2004), the FTAIA ""initially lays down a general rule placing all  [**12] (non-import) activity 
involving foreign commerce outside the Sherman Act's reach"" and then selectively brings some categories of that excluded 
conduct back within the Sherman Act's strictures. See also IB Phillip Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 272i4, at 
307-08 (3d ed. 2006). Areeda and Hovenkamp, in turn, have indicated that ""[f]oreign import commerce involves transactions in 
which the seller is located abroad while the buyer is domestic and the goods flow into the United States."" Id. at 290. Carrier's claim here is limited to its domestic purchases, and thus, does not involve the type of foreign commerce that would be 
implicated by the FTAIA. As a result, even if the FTAIA does present a jurisdictional limitation—a question that we do not decide 
here—it does not apply to this case. Cf. Dee-K Enters., Inc. v. Heveafil Sdn. Bhd., 299 F.3d 281, 287 (4th Cir. 2002) (concluding, 
in a case involving mainly foreign producers selling rubber thread in the United States and elsewhere, that the FTAIA did not 
apply ""[b]ecause this case involves importation of foreign-made goods, . . . conduct Congress expressly exempted from FTAIA 
coverage as 'involving . . . import trade or import  [**13] commerce . . . with foreign nations'"" (third and fourth alterations in 
original)), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 969, 123 S. Ct. 2638, 156 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2003)."
1205,4," We note that there is some confusion whether the Sherman Act's requirements in fact speak to subject-matter jurisdiction. The 
genesis of this confusion arises from the Supreme Court's description of the extraterritorial scope of the Sherman Act in Hartford 
Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 796 n.22, 113 S. Ct. 2891, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1993), as relating to ""jurisdiction."" At the 
time, Justice Scalia's dissent disputed that characterization and sought to clarify that the term did not refer to the court's subject-
matter jurisdiction and instead referenced the prerequisites for stating a claim on the merits. See id. at 813 (Scalia, J. 
dissenting); cf. Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law § 401 cmt. c  [**16] (1987) (indicating that the term ""subject matter 
jurisdiction"" may be used both in the context of Congress's power to prescribe legislation and in the context of a court's 
""jurisdiction to adjudicate""). Although Hartford did not squarely address the issue, many lower courts nonetheless continue to 
treat the Sherman Act's extraterritorial limitations as jurisdictional rather than as elements of a federal antitrust claim. See, e.g., 
Empagran S.A. v. F. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Ltd., 417 F.3d 1267, 1268-69, 368 U.S. App. D.C. 18 (D.C. Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 
546 U.S. 1092, 126 S. Ct. 1043, 163 L. Ed. 2d 857 (2006); United States v. LSL Biotechnologies, 379 F.3d 672, 677-79 (9th Cir. 
2004); United Phosphorus, Ltd. v. Angus Chem. Co., 322 F.3d 942, 948 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1003, 124 S. Ct. 533, 
157 L. Ed. 2d 408 (2003). Recent Supreme Court decisions, however, raise significant questions about the wisdom of that 
approach. "
1206,," After Hartford, the Supreme Court has been much more wary of labeling statutory requirements as ""jurisdictional."" Seeking to 
create a ""readily administrable bright line,"" the Court has since set out the general rule that ""when Congress does not rank a 
statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional  [**17] in character."" 
Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 516, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006); see also Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. 
Muchnick, 130 S. Ct. 1237, 1244, 176 L. Ed. 2d 18 (2010). Moreover, in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 130 S. Ct. 
2869, 2877, 177 L. Ed. 2d 535 (2010), the Court determined that questions concerning the extraterritorial application of § 10(b) 
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which has language that somewhat mirrors that in the Sherman Act, were not 
jurisdictional. These decisions have thus questioned the precedential value of the types of ""drive-by jurisdictional rulings,"" 
Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 511 (internal quotation marks omitted), seen in cases like Hartford. Cf. generally Howard M. Wasserman, 
Colloquy Essay, The Demise of ""Drive-By Jurisdictional Rulings,"" 105 NW. U. L.REV. 947 (2011). Nonetheless, because the 
parties have not addressed this issue directly, and because our decision does not hinge on further elucidation of the meaning of 
""jurisdiction"" in this context, we will save the resolution of this issue for another day. "
1207,5," The Defendants further argue that, in any event, the EC decision provides no ""positive"" support for a finding of a U.S. 
conspiracy. Outokumpu Br. 4 at 10. But Carrier need not provide any additional support for its assertions. Carrier has directly 
alleged that the Defendants engaged in an unlawful U.S.- focused market-allocation scheme; it need not offer any additional 
evidentiary support at the pleading stage. "
1208,6," The Defendants maintain that the district court was permitted to take judicial notice of the EC decisions. They also argue that 
judicial notice is a permissible basis for considering a letter submitted by EC Director Kirtikumar Mehta, which reiterated that the 
scope of the EC industrial-tubes decision was ""limited to the European territory."" J.A. at 0919 (Mehta Letter at 1). But here again, 
judicial notice would be appropriate only to prove the fact that the decisions  [**25] and the letter existed, not the truth of the 
matters stated therein. Scotty's Contracting & Stone, Inc. v. United States, 326 F.3d 785, 790 n.1 (6th Cir. 2003) (HN6[
] 
""[J]udicial notice of a fact is generally only appropriate when there is no dispute regarding the fact.""). "
1210,7," Outokumpu again reiterates its argument that Carrier's allegations are inconsistent with the findings in the EC decision. 
Specifically, Outokumpu points to statements limiting the Cuproclima cartel to European customers. As discussed above, this is 
unsurprising given that the scope of the  [**36] EC's decision was limited to Europe and therefore did not implicate Outokumpu's 
U.S. entities. Thus, as stated in Section II.A.1, our review is not constrained by the EC's decision to refrain from considering the 
existence of agreements beyond the European markets. "
1211,8," Although Carrier does not always specify whether Outokumpu engaged in the relevant concealment, this is irrelevant because 
HN17[
] ""[f]raudulent concealment . . . may be established through the acts  [**40] of co-conspirators."" In re Scrap Metal Antitrust Litig., 527 F.3d 517, 538 (6th Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1152, 129 S. Ct. 1673, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1037 (2009). "
1212,9," Outokumpu argues that the panel's decision in Gumbus v. United Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union, Nos. 93-5113, 93-
5235, 1995 U.S. App. LEXIS 523, 1995 WL 5935 (6th Cir. Jan. 6, 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 811, 116 S. Ct. 61, 133 L. Ed. 
2d 24 (1995), is to the contrary. We are not bound by Gumbus, however, as it is an unpublished decision. Moreover, our 
previous cases—including Campbell v. Upjohn Co., 676 F.2d 1122 (6th Cir. 1982), which Gumbus cites in support of the 
proposition that inquiry to company officials is insufficient to constitute due diligence—have not suggested that reliance on "
1213,," company assurances as a matter of law always falls short of demonstrating the requisite due diligence. Campbell instead utilizes 
a more fact-based approach to the question whether reliance on oral assurances was a reasonable investigation under the 
circumstances. Although we determined that such reliance was not reasonable in that case given that the plaintiff already knew 
that he had substantial cause to mistrust the words and intentions of the officers on whose assurances he claimed to rely, id. at 
1128, that conclusion does not compel recognition of a per se rule barring the use of direct inquiries to a company as  [**45] a 
reasonable means of investigation. "
1215,10," In the related American Copper case, the district court also determined that it had personal jurisdiction over OTO and OCP. 
No. 04-2771-DV (W.D. Tenn. June 1, 2006) (unpublished opinion). "
1223,1," Sleep Better does not appear to argue that Select Comfort employed improper means by sending a cease-and-desist letter. In 
fact, Sleep Better contends that had Overstock.com merely learned about its possible infringement by reading about this 
publicly-filed lawsuit between Select Comfort and Sleep Better, and as a result of obtaining that information chosen to remove 
Sleep Better's products from its website, then that, too, would have been unjustified interference by Select Comfort with the 
Sleep Better-Overstock.com contract. Thus, according to Sleep Better, any action performed by Select Comfort, no matter how 
remote or how lawful, that resulted in the Overstock.com's decision to remove Sleep Better's beds from its website would 
constitute tortious interference. "
1225,2," The dissent explained that in California Motor Transport Co., 404 U.S. 508, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642, the Supreme Court 
extended Noerr-Pennington immunity to the petitioning of courts. Cardtoons, 208 F.3d at 894. In doing so, ""the Court relied 
primarily on the constitutional underpinnings of the doctrine,"" not the statutory basis in antitrust law. Id. at 894-95. "
1226,3," 35 U.S.C. § 287 provides that when the patented item is not marked as patented, ""no damages shall be recovered by the 
patentee in any action for infringement, except on proof that the infringer was notified of the infringement and continued to 
infringe thereafter, in which even damages may be recovered only for infringement occurring after such notice."" "
1227,4," Because of the Court's rulings on justification and application of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, the Court declines to address 
Select Comfort's anti-SLAPP arguments. "
1233,1, All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise indicated.
1233,2," Asahi's third amended complaint alleged three causes of action against CoTherix for violation of California's Cartwright Act, 
false advertising law (§ 17500 et seq.), and unfair competition law (§ 17200 et seq.). On December 21, 2009, Judge Carol L. 
Mittlesteadt granted summary adjudication of the Cartwright Act claim as to CoTherix. On March 4, 2010, Asahi voluntarily 
dismissed its false advertising claim. On May 21, 2010, Judge Marie S. Weiner granted summary adjudication of the unfair 
competition law claim. A final judgment was accordingly entered by Judge Weiner in favor of CoTherix on July 8, 2010."
1233,3, Rho-kinase is a protein contributing to constriction in the smooth muscle in arterial blood vessels (vasoconstriction).
1233,4," Fasudil was originally formulated in 1984 for intravenous use in treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (a type of stroke), and received regulatory approval in Japan for this use. Asahi asserts that Fasudil also has 
additional potential uses beyond PAH treatment, including treatment of stable angina, arteriosclerosis, and other diseases or 
conditions in which Rho-kinase may be involved. "
1234,5," Also named as defendants were Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc., Actelion U.S. Holding 
Company, and Actelion officers Jean-Paul Clozel, Martine Clozel, and Simon Buckingham. They are not parties to this appeal."
1234,6," Asahi's Cartwright Act claims against the other individual and corporate defendants were subsequently, and separately, 
summarily adjudicated in their favor."
1234,7," Asahi acknowledges that its Cartwright Act claims constituted the predicate unlawful conduct on which its unfair practices 
claims were based. "
1235,8," Asahi voluntarily dismissed its false advertising claim on March 4, 2010."
1235,9," Section 16720 provides in relevant part: “A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or more persons for any of the 
following purposes: [¶] (a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce. [¶] … [¶] (c) To prevent competition in 
manufacturing, making, transportation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.” Section 16726 provides: 
“Except as provided in this chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.” "
1236,10," The Attorney General also alleged that the merger violated the Unfair Practices Act (§ 17000 et seq.). (Texaco, supra, 46 
Cal.3d at pp. 1150–1151.)"
1236,11," Since Texaco was decided, there have been three unsuccessful legislative attempts to provide a private damage cause of 
action for unilateral monopolization. (Cal. Antitrust & Unfair Competition, supra, § 6.01[B], pp. 187–188 [discussing Assem. Bill 
No. 671 (1989–1990 Reg. Sess.); Sen. Bill No. 1814 (2001–2002 Reg. Sess.); Sen. Bill No. 1274 (2005–2006 Reg. Sess.)].) 
Senate Bill No. 1274 was described as “an attempt to ‘harmonize California antitrust law with § 2 of the federal Sherman Act’ 
because California antitrust statutes ‘lack an analogous provision specifically prohibiting monopolization or attempted 
monopolization.’” (Cal. Antitrust & Unfair Competition, supra, § 6.01[B], p. 188, fn. omitted.) "
1237,12," The court held that the Unfair Practices Act was likewise inapplicable. (Texaco, supra, 46 Cal.3d at p. 1170.) This holding has 
been superseded by statute. (See Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 570 [71 Cal. Rptr. 2d 
731, 950 P.2d 1086].) "
1238,13," As we discuss post, HN7[
] judicial interpretation of the Sherman Act, while often helpful, is not dispositive  [***19] on 
Cartwright Act issues. (Texaco, supra, 46 Cal.3d at p. 1164.)"
1238,14," Section 13.10 of the Licensing Agreement otherwise provides for mandatory and binding commercial arbitration of contractual 
disputes between the parties. Some exhibits submitted in relation to the motion for summary adjudication appear to be excerpts 
from testimony submitted in International Chamber of Commerce arbitration proceedings arising from this dispute. The outcome 
of that proceeding is not directly relevant to the issues before us. "
1239,15," “Under both California and federal law, agreements fixing or tampering with prices are illegal per se.” (Oakland-Alameda 
County Builders' Exchange v. F. P. Lathrop Constr. Co. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 354, 363 [93 Cal. Rptr. 602, 482 P.2d 226]; see 
Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods, Inc., supra, 232 F.3d at p. 986.) “ ‘California and federal antitrust law under the two acts 
generally distinguish between conduct that is per se unlawful and conduct that is evaluated under the rule of reason. The law 
conclusively presumes manifestly anticompetitive restraints of trade to be unreasonable and unlawful, and evaluates other 
restraints under the rule of reason. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Fisherman's Wharf Bay Cruise Corp. v. Superior Court, supra, 114 
Cal.App.4th at pp. 334–335.) "
1240,16," One of the contested instructions advised the jury “Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits only those unreasonable restraints 
of trade which are affected by a contract, combination or conspiracy between separate entities. The economic substance of the 
relationship  [***30] between two entities determines whether they are ‘separate’ for purposes of a section 1 conspiracy. Where 
the entities possess an inherent unity of economic interest and purpose, they are not separate entities capable of conspiring. 
Thus, if you find that NWA, Inc., Northwest, and [Mainline] lacked independent economic consciousness after they had decided 
to merge and before the merger was completed, they were not capable of conspiring together at that time.” (NWA, supra, 991 
F.2d at p. 1397.) "
1241,17," Professor Areeda suggests that the question of economic integration should not be left to “a vaguely instructed jury” and 
“[j]udges, not juries, should define the purposes of the antitrust statutes and choose the conception that properly implements 
those purposes.” (Areeda, Comment, Intraenterprise Conspiracy in Decline (1983) 97 Harv. L.Rev. 451, 469–470, fns. omitted.)"
1241,18," CoTherix notes that both Actelion U.S. Holding Company and CoTherix filed preacquisition notifications of the proposed 
merger with  [***34] the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission as required by the federal Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (Pub.L. No. 94-435 (Sept. 30, 1976) 90 Stat. 1383), and that neither agency 
challenged the acquisition as anticompetitive. Since Asahi specifically disclaims any challenge to the validity of the merger, the 
effect of such a filing is not directly relevant to the issue before us. "
1242,19," At oral argument, Asahi's counsel contended that there was a conspiracy, during the period between the Acquisition 
Agreement and closing of the merger, to delay the approval process for Fasudil, and that Asahi suffered consequential damages 
during that period. Asahi neither pled nor argued such a claim in the trial court and presented no such argument in its briefing 
here. "

1245,3, Plaintiff waived a jury trial at the Pre-Trial Conference. (Docket No.  [*5] 297).
1245,4," On the first day of trial, Sixto Díaz-Saldaña (president and owner of Díaz Aviation) informed the court he was going to continue 
legally representing plaintiff Díaz Aviation during the trial and he was also going to testify on behalf of plaintiff. Defendants 
renewed their objection to Mr. Díaz-Saldaña acting as counsel and as a witness. After hearing the arguments and having 
advised plaintiff it should have retained counsel, attorney Díaz-Saldaña was allowed to represent and testify on behalf of plaintiff."
1245,5," The testimonial evidence presented  [*6] by plaintiff is undisputed and all witnesses were in essence consistent in their 
testimonies, thus reducing credibility determinations by the undersigned to a bare minimum. "

1278,4," There is no disagreement amongst the parties that both the United States and France are contracting states under the Hague

taking discovery. ""Upon receipt of a Letter of Request, which must provide specific information regarding the lawsuit and

1281,6," In support of its argument that the French Blocking Statute is enforced, ETSI refers to In re Advocat ""Christopher X,"" Cour de

which the French Supreme Court upheld the conviction and €10,000 fine against an attorney found to have violated the French 
Blocking Statute. (ETSI Mem. Law Support Mot. Protective Order at 7 n.13.) The facts in this case significantly differ from the 
facts in Christopher X. This case involves a Court Order for jurisdictional discovery, and does not involve allegations of false 
statements as found in Christopher X. Also, numerous courts have discounted the fear of criminal prosecution in light of the 
ruling in Christopher X as a basis for permitting French litigants to invoke the  [*20] Hague Evidence Convention. See In re Air 
Cargo, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 30598, 2010 WL 1189341, at *3; In re Global Power, 418 B.R. at 849; Strauss, 249 F.R.D. at 450. "

1285,6," According to Del Monte, the federal indirect purchasers sought interlocutory review of the denial of their motion for class 
certification, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, rule 23(f), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit denied their petition."
1285,7," In their complaint, plaintiffs propose a class defined as: ""All persons and entities who currently reside in California and who, at 
any time prior to May 6, 2003, purchased a pineapple with the 'Gold' designation indirectly from Defendants (the 'Class')."" 
Excluded from the proposed class were ""Defendants, their parents, subsidiaries and affiliates."" In their motion for class 
certification, the class period was modified to run ""from April 1, 2000, through and including the date of trial, or until the 
anticompetitive effects of the conduct alleged herein have subsided, whichever is earlier (the 'Class Period')."" In its order 
denying class certification, the trial court stated that plaintiffs propose a class defined as: ""'All persons and entities who resided 
in California during the period April 1, 2000, through April 1, 2009 (the 'Class Period') and who during the Class Period 
purchased a pineapple with a 'Gold' designation indirectly from Defendants for their own use and not for resale.'"""
1285,8," Since this appeal was perfected, the United States Court  [*9] of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the federal direct 
purchasers' class action in a summary order on the merits. (American Banana Co. v. J. Bonafede Co. (2d Cir., 2010) 407 Fed. 
Appx. 520, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 23022.) The federal circuit court held that direct purchasers' claims failed because, assuming 
Del Monte possessed monopoly power in a market limited to the Fresh Del Monte Gold™ pineapple, there was no showing that 
Del Monte's conduct had the requisite anticompetitive effect of delaying its competitors' entry into the market. (Id. at pp. *2, 4-5.) "
1286,9," ""Before 2004, any person could assert representative claims under the unfair competition law to obtain restitution or injunctive 
relief against unfair or unlawful business practices. Such claims did not have to be brought as a class action, and plaintiff had 
standing to sue even without having personally suffered any injury. [Citations.]"" (Arias, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 977.) However, in 
2004, ""the electorate passed Proposition 64, an initiative measure,"" which amended Business and Professions Code 17203 ""to 
provide that a private plaintiff may bring a representative action under this law only if the plaintiff has 'suffered injury in fact and 
has lost money or property as a result of such unfair competition' and 'complies with Section 382 of the Code of Civil Procedure . 
. . .' [Fn. omitted.]"" (Arias, supra, 46 Cal.4th at pp. 977.) ""Notably absent from the ballot materials [for Proposition  [*12] 64] is 
any indication that the purpose of the initiative was to alter the way in which class actions operate in the context of the UCL. 
Indeed other than the requirement that the representative plaintiff comply with Code of Civil Procedure section 382, the ballot 
materials contain no reference whatsoever to class actions, nor is there any indication that Proposition 64 was intended in any 
way to alter the rules surrounding class action certification."" (In re Tobacco II Cases, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 318.) "
1287,10," At this point in the order, the trial court cited to portions of the deposition testimony of plaintiffs' expert Melissa Kantor."
1287,11," At this point in the order, the trial court cited to  [*17] portions of the federal district court decision in In re Fresh Del Monte 
Pineapples Antitrust Litigation, supra, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18388, at pp. *26-30, 36-42."
1287,12," At this point in the order, the trial court cited to the declaration of plaintiffs' expert Gary L. French, PhD., and supporting tables 
attached to the declaration, that showed that consumers bought pineapples infrequently, and the alleged overcharges paid by 
direct purchasers ranged from $0.00 to $0.40 per pound."
1287,13," In concluding that the federal plaintiffs' ""proposed 'formal claims procedure' [was] also not a reliable method of distributing 
damages"" to a class of indirect purchasers (consumers) of Fresh Del Monte Gold™ pineapples, the federal district court found: 
""(i) Plaintiffs have not established what percentage of the Indirect Purchaser Class is likely to receive notice of the claims 
process [citations]; (ii) given the relatively small claims involved in terms of monetary value (and the proposed payment of claims 
in coupons), only a small percentage of Class Members would likely file claims [citations]; (iii) many filed claims are not likely to 
be accurate or verifiable [citations]; and (iv) the cost of notice and claims administration (which Plaintiffs failed to estimate) might "
1288,," overwhelm any relatively minimal benefit to the Class [citations]."" (In re Fresh Del Monte Pineapples Antitrust Litigation, supra, 
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18388, at pp. *40-41.)"
1288,14," Code of Civil Procedure section 384 reads, in pertinent part: ""(a) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to 
ensure that the unpaid residuals in class action litigation are distributed, to the extent possible, in a manner designed either to 
further the purposes of the underlying causes of action, or to promote justice for all Californians."""
1288,15," The Cartwright Act (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 16700 et. seq.) is our state  [*24] law that governs certain forms of antitrust conduct. 
As the trial court noted in its order: ""Because no Cartwright Act claim is presented, but only a [Business and Professions Code 
section] 17200 claim based upon [a] violation of the Sherman Act, an important question not addressed on this motion is "
1289,," whether the federal doctrine precluding actions by indirect purchasers for violation of the Sherman Act is part of [p]laintiffs' claim 
in this case. [Citation.] That issue would be a common one and the Court has not addressed it in ruling on this motion."""
1289,16," See footnote 8, ante. "
1291,17," Plaintiffs' expert conceded that he did not devise a retail level model or propose an empirical methodology for measuring pass-
through rates for indirect purchasers of Fresh Del Monte Gold™ pineapples because such methodologies could not be 
implemented without reasonably good and representative data, which was not made available to him. "
1297,1," According to Plaintiffs, in anticipation of ""a return and continued lease with MSU, Hightower spent over $70,000.00 in 
renovating a modular unit for a temporary location at MSU's request."""
1297,2, It is undisputed that other companies also submitted proposals to MSU.
1297,3," The parties appear to have met in either February or March of 2007 to discuss Subway's potential return to Colvard Union. This 
meeting appears to have taken place before the execution of the management services contract between MSU and Defendant. "
1298,4," According to Plaintiffs, one of the reasons for this disagreement surrounded the fact that Hightower would allegedly not be able 
to use the new debit system, known as ""Flex Dollars."" The Court discusses  [*6] this in more detail infra. "
1299,5," In 1998, the Mississippi Supreme Court held that the Liston case was ""instructive as it pertains to the element of intent."" Par 
Indus., 708 So. 2d at 48. "
1300,6," Bill Broyles learned of Subway's amendment to the leasing agreement in January 2007, shortly before MSU's February 2007 
meeting with Aramark."
1300,7," This tort is ""closely intertwined"" with an action for tortious interference with contract. See McBride, 949 So. 2d at 56; MBF 
Corp., 663 So. 2d at 599 (""The tort of interference with business relations is closely aligned with that of interference with  [*17] a 
contract.""). While, by definition, the two torts may be distinguishable from one other depending on the tortious acts employed, in 
order to prove tortious interference with business relations, the plaintiff has to show the same type of elements as those needed 
to prove a tortious interference with contract claim. See MBF Corp., 663 So. 2d at 599. Thus, this Court finds the MBF 
Corporation case instructive in terms of demonstrating the type of acts that would be considered unlawful and beyond the realm 
of legitimate competition. "
1303,8," In fact, if portions of Plaintiffs' brief were read in isolation, it would initially appear that the lawsuit is actually against MSU - not 
Aramark. For example, Plaintiffs assert that ""MSU was willing to grant an exclusive contract to Aramark, despite MSU's 
preexisting lease with Hightower because it [i.e., MSU] expected to make about $12,000,000.00 over ten years from Aramark."" 
(Emphasis added). This statement confers no malicious intent on Aramark."
1303,9," Stated more simply,  [*27] it does not automatically flow from MSU's alleged breach of its agreement with Hightower that the 
company to now obtain a contract with MSU caused, or otherwise induced, that alleged breach. Proof of tortious interference or 
some type of unlawful inducement still must be shown. See Morrison v. Miss. Enter. For Tech., Inc., 798 So. 2d 567, 575 (Miss. 
Ct. App. 2001) (""Tortious interference is based on intermeddling - a tort occurs if without sufficient reason, one person 
intentionally interferes with another's contract even if the interference is by giving information that is completely accurate, when 
the purpose was to cause interference and injury results."") (emphasis added). "
1304,10," Plaintiffs' brief also states, ""According to the evidentiary materials, Aramark specified that Hightower, if he were to continue his 
lease on campus, could not utilize  [*30] this new debit system."" Plaintiffs further state, ""the evidentiary materials have 
established that Aramark would allow an exception to its exclusive food contract with MSU only if Hightower were excluded from 
using the debit system (Flex Dollars). . . ."" The Court is unsure as to what evidentiary materials Plaintiffs refer to. In fact, Plaintiffs fail to even cite to a portion of the record 
to support such assertions. See Williams v. Valenti, 432 F. App'x 298, 303 (5th Cir. 2011) (noting that the district court is ""not 
required to search the record in support of evidence supporting a party's opposition to summary judgment""). As Defendant 
notes, Plaintiffs appear to be misconstruing the record evidence in an attempt to create the (mis)impression that Aramark 
mandated Subway's exclusion from the debit program. Plaintiffs do this by wrongfully imputing statements by MSU officials, 
specifically Bill Broyles, to Defendant Aramark. Specifically, it was Bill Broyles of MSU, not Aramark, that stated, ""We told him 
[Hightower] . . . that he could not accept the Flex Dollars for meal purchases."" Dep. of Broyles at 23. Further, as noted above, 
Broyles also testified as follows: Q: Did y'all discuss  [*31] with Aramark the possibility of allowing Mr. Hightower to accept the Flex Dollars? A: No. We discussed with Aramark the possibility of Mr. Hightower coming back on campus. Q: Okay. Did you ever bring up to Mr. Nelson [of Aramark] the possibility of Subway being allowed to accept the Flex 
Dollars and how that could work? A: No, I didn't. Q: Okay. Why didn't you? A: Didn't think about it. Dep. of Broyles. at 39 - 42. "
1309,1," The 1995 Agreement contained a clause which permitted C-E to terminate the Agreement if CARBO entered the calcined clay 
market. "
1311,2," Because the court finds Paragraph 5 neither ""essential"" nor ""necessary"" to the Supply Agreement, the court need not decide 
which is the precise formulation of the standard under antitrust law. Compare American Needle, Inc. v. NFL, 560 U.S. 183, 130 
S. Ct. 2201, 2216-17, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010) (using ""essential"") with Broadcast Music, Inc. v. CBS, 441 U.S. 1, 23, 99 S. Ct. 
1551, 60 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1979) (using ""necessary"") and National Bancard Corp. v. VISA, U.S.A., Inc., 779 F.2d 592, 601 (11th Cir.

1314,3," The court is puzzled by Defendant's argument that Plaintiff's requested injunction would violate Defendant's First Amendment 
right to petition any court. Plaintiff filed an action for declaratory judgment and a motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendant 
has fully participated in litigating before the court and raised counterclaims of breach of contract, disgorgement, and unjust 
enrichment. The fact that the court has determined that Plaintiff has a substantial likelihood of demonstrating that Paragraph 5 is 
invalid does not mean that Defendant did not have an opportunity to petition the court as to its views of Paragraph 5. "

1339,1," The Court notes that Plaintiff is a repeat litigator in this District and in many others. Plaintiff has been denied in forma pauperis 
status in accordance with the ""three strikes"" rule, and was recently barred from commencing litigation in this District without the 
prior approval of the Chief Judge. See Bridgeforth v. U.S. Navy Recruitment Office, Civ. No. 1:11-CV-431, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

 [**2] IPSAC ¶¶ 19-44, 107-08, 505."

1389,3," This inventory does not include the claims that Plaintiffs withdrew at oral argument. At that time, Plaintiffs withdrew all of their

1389,4," The Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' Second Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint is 
filed at Docket No. 332. Plaintiffs responded to the Motion (Doc.  [**3] No. 355), and Defendants filed a reply brief (Doc. No. 
385). The parties submitted several supplemental materials to the Court. At oral argument all counsel ably presented on the 
Motion, and the transcript of the argument is in the record at Docket No. 597. "
1390,5, The Court is separately addressing the Defendants' other pending motions to dismiss relating to the IPSAC.
1390,6," Except when distinctions are necessary for clarity, the general use of the term ""eggs"" and ""egg"" in this Opinion will be 
consistent with the IPSAC's definition, i.e., ""eggs"" is inclusive of ""shell eggs"" and ""egg products."""
1390,7," The members of these proposed classes, individuals and entities, are defined by their state of residency with respect to each of 
the 22 state jurisdictions at issue and who ""indirectly purchased shell eggs and/or egg products produced from shell eggs 
produced from Defendants' or their co-conspirators' caged birds during the Class Period."" Id. ¶¶ 108. "
1391,8," The Court's jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs' state law claims is predicated on the diversity of the parties and supplemental 
jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332, 1367. HN1[
] In such circumstances the Court is ""required to apply the substantive law of 
the state whose law governs the action.""  [**11] Spence v. ESAB Group, Inc., 623 F.3d 212, 217 (3d Cir. 2010) (citing Erie R.R. 
Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938)). Yet many of the parties' arguments concerning the Motion at bar ""put in mind of the concept of 'general' common law that 
prevailed in the era of Swift v. Tyson. The assumption is that the common law of the 50 states and the District of Columbia . . . is "
1392,," basically uniform and can be abstracted in a single [encapsulation of 'law']."" Matter of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc., 51 F.3d 1293, 
1300 (7th Cir. 1995). Tempting as that potential shortcut might be in the face of such a significant task as presented by the 
Motion at hand, the Court simply cannot accept such notions. The purpose of the Erie doctrine and ""the intent of that decision was to insure that . . . the outcome of the litigation in the federal 
court should be substantially the same, so far as legal rules determine the outcome of a litigation, as it would be if tried in a State 
court."" Guaranty Trust Co. of New York v. York, 326 U.S. 99, 109, 65 S. Ct. 1464, 89 L. Ed. 2079 (1945). Accordingly, the Court 
adheres to Erie's guidance in evaluating the Defendants' Motion and exhorts the parties to do likewise as this litigation proceeds. "
1394,9," Although it appears that Rule 9(b) is generous in permitting a generalized pleading in this regard, one treatise has noted that 
this sentence  [**20] ""suggests that the [Rule's] draftsmen felt a need to qualify the first sentence to insure that it was not 
interpreted to require a party pleading fraud or mistake to allege the specific circumstances of fraudulent intent, knowledge of the 
falsity of a statement, or mistaken belief in its truth."" 5A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 
1301."
1394,10," Before proceeding further on this Motion, the Court is compelled to comment upon the parties' approach to articulating and 
supporting their arguments. In many respects, the parties' respective work is indeed impressive. However, at other times, the 
parties' work product contained deficiencies ranging from a dearth of meaningful (indeed, sometimes even unreliable) citation to 
legal authority, erroneous characterizations of the opposing parties' arguments (or worse, ignoring those arguments or failing to 
comprehend and directly address their substance),and complete omission of legal analysis. In some respects this has led to 
additional challenges for the Court to try to evaluate the efficacy of the arguments. Certainly that effort has been made more time 
consuming as a result—albeit, there  [**21] was never quite a need to resort to soliciting all of the queen's horses and all of the 
queen's men to piece the parties' arguments together. Such advocacy is, fortunately, uncharacteristic of the fine professionals 
who have, to date, appeared in this case. At times, the press of business can make consistently high level performance extremely difficult. The Court urges the litigators 
involved in this case to rededicate themselves to presenting their clients' positions in the most compelling light appropriate 
whenever possible and to have the well-earned and deserved confidence to forego arguments put forth merely for arguments' 
sake. "
1395,11," Because the singular issue at bar is the named Plaintiffs' individual Article III standing to bring the antitrust claims under the 
laws of Iowa, Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota, the issue presented does not arise as a result of, or invoke, issues 
relating to class certification or implicate the standing of proposed class members. Certainly,  [**25] sometimes the factors and 
facts considered during a class certification inquiry overlap with Article III standing, but nonetheless Article III standing is 
analytically and conceptually distinct from those other matters. See generally Wright & Miller, supra, §1785.1 (HN9[
] ""[B]oth 
standing and mootness also frequently appear as threshold requirements for the maintenance of federal class actions and must 
be considered in addition to the requirements of Rule 23 when deciding whether a particular action may be certified. It is 
important when considering the applicability of these two doctrines to class actions to keep in mind that these concepts serve 
both constitutional and prudential concerns: they ensure that a justiciable or live issue is presented, thereby satisfying the Article 
III requirement that federal courts only entertain cases or controversies, and they seek to ascertain whether the person asserting 
the claim is sufficiently interested so that full litigation of the issues involved can be assumed. Notably, this latter concern also is 
addressed through the Rule 23 requirements that the class representative be a member of the class, and be an adequate 
representative for the class.""  [**26] (footnotes omitted)). There is long-standing precedent to the effect that HN10[
] when a ""class action"" is introduced into the standing equation, the 
requirement that a named plaintiff must have standing to bring it is unaltered. Insofar that a case ""may be a class action . . . adds 
nothing to the question of standing, for even named plaintiffs who represent a class 'must allege and show that they personally 
have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which 
they purport to represent.'"" Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 357, 116 S. Ct. 2174, 135 L. Ed. 2d 606 (1996) (quoting Simon v. 
Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 40, n. 20, 96 S. Ct. 1917, 48 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1976)). Simply put, ""one cannot 
acquire individual standing by virtue of bringing a class action."" See 1 A. Conte & H. Newberg, Class Actions § 2:5 (4th ed. 
2002). Accordingly, there is no reason to defer consideration of the particular Article III standing issue raised by Defendants until class 
certification. The succinct conclusion in In re Flonase Antitrust Litig., 692 F. Supp. 2d 524, 534 (E.D. Pa. 2010), is also 
applicable here: ""Named plaintiffs must have case or controversy standing; the potential standing problem  [**27] in this case is 
not created by class certification. Therefore class certification is not logically antecedent to the standing problem."" Other courts 
similarly have held that HN11[
] when the issue presented in a motion to dismiss concerns solely whether the named plaintiffs 
have standing to assert class action claims, the named plaintiffs' standing is a threshold issue, and there is no reason to defer 
the named plaintiffs' standing determination until class certification. See, e.g., In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 260 F.R.D. 143, 
153-55 (E.D. Pa. 2009); Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health & Welfare Plan v. GlaxoSmithKline, PLC, 263 F.R.D. 205, 211 
(E.D. Pa. 2009) (hereinafter ""SMW""); In re Magnesium Oxide Antitrust Litig., No. 10-5943, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121373, 2011 
WL 5008090, at *10 (D.N.J. 2011); In re Packaged Ice Antitrust Litig., 779 F. Supp. 2d 642, 656 (E.D. Mich. 2011). This Court agrees with the legal analysis articulated in Flonase and those other courts' decisions as to these issues involving 
named plaintiffs' standing, and determines that the rationale advanced by those courts is applicable to this case. In short, the 
Court concludes that it is not required to defer an Article III standing inquiry  [**28] as to the named Plaintiffs. "
1396,12," Generally, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals considers motions to dismiss for lack of standing as Rule 12(b)(1) motions. See 
Ballentine v. United States, 486 F.3d 806, 810, 48 V.I. 1059 (3d Cir. 2007). Defendants here have classified their motion as 
one to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Plaintiffs agree with this  [**29] standard of review. The Court is 
willing to accept the categorization of the instant challenge as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, recognizing that it could also be evaluated 
as a Rule 12(b)(1) claim. The difference between Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) does not change the analysis or the outcome. 
See Baldwin v. Univ. of Pittsburgh Med. Ctr., 636 F.3d 69, 73 (3d. Cir. 2011) (noting that HN13[
] ""[a] dismissal for lack of 
statutory standing is effectively the same as a dismissal for failure to state a claim""). "
1397,13," Accord Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., 667 F.3d 273, 307 (3d Cir. Dec. 20, 2011) (en banc) (observing that HN19[
] 
""statutory standing"" can be understood as ""simply another element of proof for an antitrust claim, rather than a predicate for 
asserting a claim in the first place"" (quotations omitted)). "
1398,14," Cf. 2 Moore et al., Federal Practice § 12.30 (3d ed. 2011) (HN24[
] ""Whether a statutory provision that establishes a 
threshold for relief is jurisdictional or goes to the merits determines whether a failure to comply with the provision is grounds for 
dismissal (at any time in the litigation) under Rule 12(b)(1), or whether a failure to meet the threshold is merely a basis for 
summary judgment or for dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), matters that are subject to very different 
procedural rules and limits. Under the ""bright line"" rule of Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., [federal] statutory threshold requirements 
 [**39] should not be treated as jurisdictional unless Congress has clearly stated that they are."")."
1398,15," See, e.g., IPSAC ¶ 8 (""Plaintiffs . . . have been forced to pay supra-competitive prices for shell eggs and egg products and, 
thus, as a result of Defendants' illegal actions, have suffered antitrust injury.""); id. ¶ 18 (""[E]ach Plaintiff purchased shell eggs 
and/or egg products in the state in which they reside or conduct business and suffered an economic injury as a result of 
Defendants' illegal conduct described in this Complaint.""); id. ¶¶ 359, 411, 476, 490 (""As a direct and proximate result of 
Defendants' unlawful and anticompetitive practices, including combinations and contracts to restrain trade and monopolize the 
relevant markets, Plaintiff[s] . . . have been injured in their business and/or property in that they paid supra-competitive, 
artificially inflated prices for shell eggs and egg products.""). "
1399,16," Furthermore, such relief is afforded in private enforcement actions brought under the four statutes. See Iowa Code § 553.12 ("". 
. . may bring suit to . . . 2. Recover actual damages . . .""); Miss. Code Ann. § 75-21-9 ("" . . . may recover all damages of every 
kind sustained by him or it . . .""); N.D. Cent. Code § 51-08.1-08 ("". . . may bring an action for . . . damages sustained . . .""); S.D. 
Codified Laws § 37-1-14.3 ("". . . may bring an action for . . . damages sustained . . ."")."
1399,17," To the extent that named Plaintiffs seek the redress of injunctive relief in relation  [**42] to any of their federal or state claims, 
it is less clear from the IPSAC's allegations whether those Plaintiffs have Article III standing for such relief. HN26[
] Article III 
standing is to be considered in light of the specific allegations and the relief sought, which with respect to injunctive relief 
requires consideration of whether a plaintiff is ""likely to suffer future injury."" Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102; see also Penn. Prison Soc. 
v. Cortes, 508 F.3d 156, 165- 68 (3d Cir. 2007) (discussing case law concerning injury-in-fact and likelihood of facing personal 
injury); Clark v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 736 F. Supp. 2d 902, 924-35 (D.N.J. 2010) (dismissing for lack of Article III standing 
the portion of a California Unfair Competition Law claim seeking injunctive relief because plaintiff had cancelled her health 
insurance policy and thus ""no longer face[d] a threat of continued harm with regard to [Defendant's] disclosures about the . . . 
policy""). The IPSAC does not explicitly allege facts that named Plaintiffs face the prospect of future injury, and the IPSAC only 
alleges that the named Plaintiffs suffered past harm. See, e.g., IPSAC ¶ 19 (""This Plaintiff indirectly purchased shell eggs 
 [**43] and/or egg products during the Class Period and was injured as a result of Defendants' illegal conduct."" (emphasis 
added)). Thus, if Plaintiffs seek leave to amend the IPSAC, clarifying amendments may be appropriate with respect to Article III 
standing for injunctive relief."
1399,18," Not only the federal courts embrace the plain meaning rule of statutory construction, but so, too, do the appellate courts of the 
states here concerned. See Murphy v. Millennium Radio Group, LLC., 650 F.3d 295, 302 (3d Cir. 2011) (HN27[
] ""'Because it 
is presumed that Congress expresses its intent through the ordinary meaning of its language, every exercise of statutory 
interpretation begins with an examination of the plain language of the statute. . . . When the statute's language is plain, the sole "

N.W.2d 675, 681 (S.D. 2005)). "
1401,19," As to the South Dakota antitrust law, some federal courts have determined that in order to allege that a plaintiff is entitled to 
bring suit thereunder, it must be alleged that either a part of the conspiracy or the conspiracy's  [**49] restraint of trade occurred 
within South Dakota. See In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust Litig., 350 F. Supp. 2d 160, 172 (D. Me. 2004) 
(""The statutory language is ambiguous as to whether it is a part of the conspiracy or a part of the trade or commerce that must 
be within the state. Nevertheless, it is logical to assume that the state intended its antitrust coverage to be as broad as possible. 
Therefore, I conclude that the plaintiffs need only allege that a part of the trade or commerce occurred within South Dakota.""); In 
re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., 602 F. Supp. 2d 538, 581 (M.D. Pa. 2009) (""[A] plaintiff must allege only that 
defendant's conduct produced anticompetitive effects within South Dakota""); In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig., 496 
F. Supp. 2d 404, 414 (D. Del. 2007) (following other courts' determinations that ""allegations that part of the trade or commerce 
occurred within South Dakota were sufficient to bring the related conspiracy into the reach of South Dakota law""); In re Dynamic 
Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litig., 516 F. Supp. 2d 1072, 1098 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (agreeing ""that South Dakota's 
antitrust statute should  [**50] be read to cover unlawful anticompetitive conduct, as long as any part of it 'is within [South 
Dakota]'—i.e., as long as any part of it takes place or has an effect within the state"")."
1401,20," For purposes of this analysis, the Court need not decide at this time whether the Mississippi  [**51] statute is ambiguous or 
whether its plain meaning applies. (This is true for all four state antitrust statutes at issue for that matter). However, one 
Mississippi court has noted that one statutory provision sets forth the legislative intent of the antitrust statute, which may have 
some bearing on the construction of the statute: Even if the [antitrust] statute was ambiguous, which it clearly is not [with respect to the Attorney General's enforcement of 
the law], the legislative intent of the act is clearly to 'suppress' all trust and monopolies. Miss. Code Ann. § 75-21-39 (1972). 
The Mississippi Code states ""[the Mississippi Antitrust Act] shall be liberally construed in all courts to the end that trusts and 
combines may be suppressed, and the benefits arising from competition in business preserved to the people of this state."" Hood ex rel. State v. BASF Corp., No. 56863, 2006 WL 308378, at *4 (Miss. Ch. Jan. 17, 2006) (unpublished). "
1402,21," In light of this analysis, the Court is not proceeding to further consider prudential standing concerns at this time. The Court 
concludes such analysis is also not required at present because Defendants have only challenged the named Plaintiffs' Article III 
constitutional standing. Furthermore, HN33[
] there is no requirement that prudential standing issues must always be resolved 
before the merits—and certainly not, as in this case, when the parties have not framed prudential standing issues explicitly or 
suitably for the Court's consideration. See Bowers v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 346 F.3d 402, 416 (3d Cir. 2003) 
(recognizing that although the Supreme Court in Steel Co. ""specifically indicated that 'Article III jurisdiction is always an 
antecedent question'"" that decision ""should not be understood as requiring courts to answer all questions of 'jurisdiction,' 
 [**55] broadly understood, before addressing the existence of the cause of action sued upon."" (footnote omitted) (citing Steel 
Co., 523 U.S. at 97 n.2)); Jordon v. AG of the United States, 424 F.3d 320, 325 n.8 (3d Cir. 2005) (recognizing same); St. 
Matthew's Slovak Roman Catholic Congregation v. Most Reverend, 106 F. App'x 761, 766 n.5 (3d Cir. 2004) (unpublished) 
(recognizing same)."
1402,22," Defendants have characterized this argument as a ""standing"" issue by claiming that ""Plaintiffs have no standing to sue for 
damages arising before May 1, 2006."" Defs.' Mot. at 9. Based on the Court's prior discussion of Article III constitutional standing, 
""statutory standing,"" and ""antitrust standing,"" the Court refrains from using the term ""standing"" in the context of this issue to 
avoid possible confusion about the precise legal issue at bar. "
1403,23," To the extent that the defense may have obliquely raised the issue in connection with its Motion, the Court does not address 
whether the Plaintiffs' claims arising from conduct that occurred prior to May 1, 2006 may be dismissed. The Defendants' briefing 
and oral argument did not present or frame this question in a sufficient fashion that would allow the Court to address it. Similarly, 
 [**58] Plaintiffs have articulated only that they oppose the Defendants on this score. Defendants cite but a single legal authority in connection with this issue, In re Aftermarket Filters Antitrust Litigation, No. 08-cv-
04883, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104114, 2009 WL 3754041 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 5, 2009). However, that case only addressed the 
question of whether ""any claim for relief prior to the effective date of [the Utah] statute[] must be dismissed"" and not the separate 
and distinct question of whether dismissal of claims arising from conduct occurring before May 1, 2006 was warranted. Mem. of 
Law in Support of Defs.' Joint Mot. to Dismiss the Consolidated Indirect Purchaser Comp., at 17, Aftermarket Filters, No. 08-cv-
04883 (Doc. No. 196) (N.D. Ill. Feb. 2, 2009) (emphasis added). Because this issue is largely undefined, particularly in light of 
the defense's failure to proffer any other supporting legal authority or analysis, the Court declines to undertake the burden of 
deciding this issue in its present posture."
1403,24," To determine whether it might be appropriate to raise this or a similar issue again following the Plaintiffs' agreement to amend 
the definition of ""egg products""  [**61] and whether a Rule 12(b)(6) motion might be the appropriate means to do so, the 
Defendants should refer to the Court's prior decision on a motion in which most of the same Defendants here raised similar 
issues directed to the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs' pleading in this multidistrict litigation. See Oct. 14, 2011 Mem. and Order, 2011 "
1404,," WL 4945864 (denying without prejudice the motion to dismiss a distinct antitrust claim as to egg products in the direct purchaser 
class action plaintiffs' Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint)."
1404,25," HN37[
] Once a plaintiff has satisfied the injury requirement under Section 17203 of the UCL, ""[s]uch injuries satisfy the plain meaning of section 17204's 'lost money or property' requirement, qualify as injury in fact, and would permit a plaintiff to seek an 
injunction against the offending business practice even in the absence of any basis for restitution."" Kwikset, 246 P.3d at 895. "
1405,26," Even Defendants argue that insofar that the IPSAC alleges that the logo for the Animal Care Certified program was 
misleading, ""these allegations do not form the basis of Plaintiffs' consumer fraud claims"" and that ""Plaintiffs' causes of action 
make it exceedingly clear that Plaintiffs are seeking damages resulting only from the allegedly 'artificially high' egg prices and 
are concerned with Defendants' conduct only as it relates to the alleged reduction in the supply of eggs."" Defs.' Mot. at 39-40. "
1406,27," The Court notes that Defendants have not sought dismissal of the California unjust enrichment claim on the basis of failure to 
adequately plead the ""conferral of a benefit,"" although, as discussed infra, the defense does challenge certain of the unjust 
enrichment claims on that and other grounds."
1406,28," The Court reads the reference to Arizona in the last sentence of the referenced pleading paragraph to be a typographical 
error, given that these allegations are essentially cookie-cutter as to each state unjust enrichment claim: "
1407,," The Defendants were able to achieve their increased revenues and profits from their sales of  [**73] eggs to California 
indirect purchasers because the demand for eggs by indirect purchasers is relatively price inelastic, as Defendants 
understood. Thus, the ability of Defendants to profit from their sales of eggs to indirect purchasers in California was 
connected to and due to the increased prices paid for Defendants eggs by indirect purchasers in [California]. Id."
1407,29," Marbry explicitly addressed a defense argument on a motion to dismiss an indirect purchaser class action on a theory of a 
price-fixing conspiracy among distributors of compact discs (""CDs""), which contended that the DCCPPA ""protects against 
deceptive trade practices, not unfair competition. Since plaintiff has not alleged any misrepresentation that deceived her, 
 [**76] the consumer protection count, defendants say, must be dismissed."" Marbry, 129 Daily Wash. L. Rptr. at 2067. The Court 
disagreed, noting, inter alia, that the ""CPPA's list of unlawful trade practices is not exclusive and includes trade practices made 
illegal by later-enacted statutes. . . . If selling CDs is a trade practice, price fixing CDs, just as plainly, is an improper trade 
practice under the CPPA for which a consumer has the right to bring a lawsuit . . . ."" Id. "
1408,30," Plaintiffs have brought a District of Columbia antitrust claim (see IPSAC ¶¶ 336-39) which they argue is the basis for their 
DCCPPA claim. See Pls.' Resp. at 5 (""[T]he CPPA claims in this case . . . are based on violation of another D.C. law (its 
antitrust law) . . . .""). Defendants do not argue that Plaintiffs have failed to state a D.C. antitrust claim, except with respect to 
injuries relating to certain egg products."
1408,31," The two cases upon which Defendants rely for this position are inapposite. Neither of those cases, In re Flash Memory 
Antitrust Litigation, 643 F. Supp. 2d 1133 (N.D. Cal. 2009) and In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litigation, 527 F. Supp. 
2d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2007), addressed the question of whether a violation of the D.C. antitrust law is an unlawful trade practice 
under the DCCPPA. For example, in Flash Memory, that court determined that the antitrust price-fixing theory at issue could be brought under the 
DCCPPA because the Act ""proscribes the imposition of prices that are 'unconscionably high,' i.e., prices that are 'unreasonably 
favorable' to the seller, where 'the buyer did not have a meaningful choice of alternatives under the circumstances.'"" Id. at 1157-
58. In reaching this  [**79] conclusion, the court relied on a District of Columbia Court of Appeals case that addressed D.C. Code 
§ 28-3904(r), a DCCPPA provision that prohibits ""mak[ing] or enforc[ing] unconscionable terms or provisions of sales or leases."" 
Id. at 1158 (citing Ford v. Chartone, Inc., 908 A.2d 72 (D.C. 2006)). Because the court's attention was directed to those issues, 
Flash Memory did not speak to whether a violation of the D.C. antitrust law is an unlawful trade practice, which is what Plaintiffs 
argue here and, as discussed above, does not require alleging unconscionable conduct. Moreover, to the extent that Defendants, by citing D.C. Code § 28-3904(r), contend that Plaintiffs have brought a DCCPPA claim 
pursuant to that provision, see Pls.' Reply at 16, they are in error. Plaintiffs confirmed at oral argument that their DCCPPA claim 
rests on the Defendants' alleged violation of the D.C. Antitrust Act and not subdivision (r). See Tr. at 95:22-96:2; 96:17-21. "
1409,32," Although Defendants generally argue that ""consumer fraud causes of action require Plaintiffs to plead more than simply the 
elements of an antitrust violation,"" Defs.' Reply at 8, they have not provided any authority that this is true under Florida law in 
circumstances where an alleged antitrust violation is the purported unfair method of competition."
1409,33," Additionally, for the same reasons the Court already discussed in relation to the consumer protections claims of California and 
the District of Columbia, the Plaintiffs' factual allegations that give rise to their antitrust and consumer protection claims under 
Florida law do not sound in fraud so as to require the application of Rule 9 under Third Circuit case law. "
1411,34," The Court need not determine or even address whether the pleading satisfies Rule 9(b) at this time. However, the Court 
recognizes that Plaintiffs did not raise any objection to the Defendants' claim that Rule 9 pleading standards apply to the KCPA 
claim. "
1412,35," The court summarized the plaintiff's complaint as follows: The plaintiff alleges that,  [**92] beginning in January, 1990, the defendants conspired among themselves to restrain free 
trade of vitamin products by suppressing and eliminating competition. The conspiracy consisted of formal and informal 
collusion by the defendants to: (1) fix, increase, and maintain prices for vitamin products; (2) coordinate price increases 
among themselves for the sale of vitamin products; (3) allocate among themselves the volume of sales and market shares 
of vitamin products; (4) allocate among themselves all or part of certain contracts to supply vitamin products to various 
customers; and (5) refrain from submitting bids, or submit collusive, noncompetitive, and rigged bids. The effect of the 
defendants' alleged conduct was to restrict competition in the sale of vitamin products in Massachusetts and to force 
consumers to pay prices for such products that were artificially inflated. Id. at 306-07."
1412,36," Furthermore,  [**94] because the factual allegations of the contours of the alleged conspiracy and the ""collective efforts,"" as 
discussed above in relation to the other state antitrust claims, do not sound in fraud, heightened pleading under Rule 9(b) is not 
required. "
1413,37," What Defendants appear to discount in Hernandez is that court's recognition that the value received for a good or service must 
be evaluated by considering the specific factual circumstances of the good or service and its purchase. This includes 
considering factors specific to the production side of that good or service, including, inter alia, the provider's costs, industry 
regulation, general industry practices, actions of the providers' competitors, and a providers' business plan and marketing 
strategy. See Hernandez, 128 P.3d at 498 (discussing how, at summary judgment, a defendant bank's proffered affidavit 
attesting to these factors in relation to the service at issue, a bank's overdraft fees, ""meets the requirements of a prima facie 
showing that there is no gross disparity between the value received by Plaintiff and the fee he paid for that value""). Additionally, 
LensCrafters, Inc. v. Kehoe, No. 28,145, 2010 N.M. App. Unpub. LEXIS 426, 2010 WL 4924992, at *8 (N.M. Ct. App. Oct. 15, 
2010),  [**98] writ. cert. granted, 150 N.M. 560, 263 P.3d 902 (N.M. 2011), suggests that facts concerning the nature of the 
specific good or service at issue might also require evaluation. See id. (determining that, to the extent that the NMUPA might 
apply to a lease of equipment, as a subpart of a lease for office space, to withstand summary judgment, a plaintiff would need to 
present ""evidence to evaluate the equipment portion of the sublease agreement or any apportionment of the overall lease to the 
equipment"" in order to determine whether a provision allowing for a $12,000 per year increase in rent ""was a gross disparity in 
value between what [plaintiff] was paying in rent and what he received under the equipment portion of the agreement""). These 
cases, then, suggest that a variety of factors may be appropriately considered in determining whether gross disparity between 
value received and price paid exists. "
1414,38," Because the allegations that give rise to the NMUPA claim are based upon the second definition of ""unconscionable trade 
practice"" and those allegations do not sound in fraud, consideration of Rule 9(b) is not required here for reasons previously 
discussed supra in relation to other state antitrust claims."
1414,39," Although Defendants contend that the NMUPA requires Plaintiffs to plead ""something more than merely alleging that the price 
of a product was unfairly high,"" the case cited by Defendants in support of this position does not appear to have reached that 
conclusion based upon consideration of New Mexico law. See In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., 527 F. Supp. 2d 
1011, 1029-30 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (citing the consumer protection laws of Arkansas and the District of Columbia for the proposition 
that ""pleading unconscionability requires something more than merely alleging that the price of a product was unfairly high""). "
1415,40," In light of the Court's determination that Plaintiffs may proceed with their NMUPA claim at this time, the Court does not 
determine whether Plaintiffs have also stated such a claim pursuant to the first definition of an ""unconscionable  [**103] trade 
practice."" "
1416,41," Given the Court's decision, the Court need not address at this time whether Rule 9(b) applies here. "
1417,42," The legal authority is opaque as to whether a violation of North Carolina antitrust constitutes a Section 75-1.1 claim. See Allen, 
supra, § 27.01 (recognizing that ""some courts and commentators have viewed the Chapter 75 antitrust prohibitions to be 
coincidentally illegal under § 75-1.1, [and] at least one court has regarded part of former N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-5 to be outside the 
scope of § 75.1-1"" (footnote omitted))."
1417,43," There is no unequivocal law in North Carolina that bars consumers from bringing a UDTPA claim based upon an ""unfair 
method of competition."" See John F. Graybeal, Unfair Trade Practices, Antitrust and Consumer Welfare in North Carolina, 80 "
1418,," N.C. L. Rev. 1927, 1991-98 (2002) (discussing North Carolina law concerning whether consumers, as opposed to competitors, 
may pursue an unfair method of competition claim under the UDTPA). Defendants have raised no arguments for dismissal on 
this basis."
1418,44," The Court determines that the antitrust conspiracy alleged does not sound in fraud for the reasons already discussed supra in 
relation to other state claims. Thus, Rule 9(b) does not apply to this claim."
1418,45," Considering a summary judgment motion, one court recently concluded thatHN65[
]  ""the plaintiff's failure to comply with the mandatory prerequisite set forth in Section 46A-6-106(b) bar[red] her from bringing a claim."" Stanley v. Huntington Nat. Bank, 
No. 1:11CV54, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9448, 2012 WL 254135, at *7 (N.D. W.Va. Jan. 27, 2012). "
1419,46," Because the Court is dismissing for lack of pre-suit notification allegations, the Court does not address Defendants' arguments 
for dismissal on the basis of Rules 8 and 9(b). "
1420,47," See also 1 Witkin Summary Cal. Law Contracts § 1013 (HN68[
] ""The right to restitution or quasi-contractual recovery is 
based upon unjust enrichment. Where a person obtains a benefit that he or she may not justly retain, the person is unjustly 
enriched. The quasi-contract,  [**122] or contract 'implied in law,' is an obligation (not a true contract . . .) created by the law 
without regard to the intention of the parties, and is designed to restore the aggrieved party to his or her former position by return 
of the thing or its equivalent in money.""); see generally Douglas L. Johnson & Neville L. Johnson, What Happened To Unjust 
Enrichment In California? The Deterioration of Equity in the California Courts, 44 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 277 (2010) (advancing the 
thesis that an independent cause of action for unjust enrichment exists under California law). "
1421,48," See 66 Am. Jur. 2d Restitution and Implied Contracts § 28 (recognizing that an adequate remedy at law can be a defense to 
unjust enrichment); 3 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies §12.8(2) at 204 (2d ed. 1993) (recognizing that the adequacy test need 
not be a part of the prima facie case and can be ""one factor to be considered in deciding whether relief is warranted"")."
1421,49," This latter proposition is illustrated by the Restatement (Third) of Restitution (2011). Section 4(2) of the Restatement provides 
that HN70[
] the unavailability of an adequate remedy at  [**125] law is not a consideration in an unjust enrichment claim: ""A 
claimant otherwise entitled to a remedy for unjust enrichment, including a remedy originating in equity, need not demonstrate the 
inadequacy of available remedies at law."" Id. § 4(2). As the comment to Section 4(2) explains: ""Although some remedies in 
restitution are indeed equitable in origin, there is no requirement that a claimant who seeks any of the remedies described in this 
Restatement must first demonstrate the inadequacy of a remedy at law. An argument to the contrary should appear antiquated 
today, but § 4(2) is included to remove any doubt."" See also 1 George E. Palmer, Law of Restitution § 1.6 at 34 (1978) 
(""Although an occasional decision suggests that restitution will be denied when alternative remedies are considered adequate, 
innumerable cases demonstrate that this is incorrect."" (footnote omitted)). Moreover, the Restatement does not include 
""adequate remedy at law"" among the possible defenses to unjust enrichment. See id. §§ 62-70. "
1422,50," The Court reaches this conclusion based upon the following assessment of the laws of the nine states. Florida HN73[
] Plaintiffs need not plead the unavailability of remedy provided by law to state a claim for unjust enrichment under 
Florida law. The Supreme Court of Florida has acknowledged that the ""elements of an unjust enrichment claim are 'a benefit 
conferred upon a defendant by the plaintiff, the defendant's appreciation of the benefit, and the defendant's acceptance and 
retention of the benefit under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying the value thereof.'"" Florida 
Power Corp. v. City of Winter Park, 887 So. 2d 1237, 1241 n.4 (Fla. 2004).  [**129] (citing Ruck Bros. Brick, Inc. v. Kellogg & 
Kimsey, Inc., 668 So. 2d 205, 207 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1995)). Lower courts in Florida have held that to ""state a claim for unjust 
enrichment, a plaintiff must plead the following elements: 1) the plaintiff has conferred a benefit on the defendant; 2) the 
defendant has knowledge of the benefit; 3) the defendant has accepted or retained the benefit conferred; and 4) the 
circumstances are such that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without paying fair value for it."" Golden 
v. Woodward, 15 So.3d 664, 670 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2009); see also Henry M. Butler, Inc. v. Trizec Properties, Inc., 524 So. 
2d 710, 711-12 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1988) (articulating same). Massachusetts HN74[
] The unavailability of an adequate remedy at law is not within the parameters of the prima facie claim for unjust 
enrichment as articulated by Massachusetts courts: [T]he sine qua non of unjust enrichment is that the defendant has been unjustly enriched. ""Even where a person has received a benefit from another, he is liable to pay therefor only if the circumstances are such 
that, as between the two persons, it is unjust for him to retain it."" . . .  [**130] . The term is not descriptive of conduct which, standing alone, would justify an action for recovery. Unjust 
enrichment is an essentially equitable doctrine requiring proof of some misconduct, fault or culpable action on the part of 
the defendant as ""wrongdoer"" which renders his retention of a benefit at the expense of another contrary to equity and good 
conscience. DeSanctis v. Labell's Airport Parking Inc., 1991 Mass. App. Div. 37, 40 (Mass. App. Ct. 1991) (citation omitted). ""Unjust 
enrichment, as a basis for restitution, requires more than benefit. The benefit must be unjust, a quality that turns on the 
reasonable expectations of the parties."" Community Builders, Inc. v. Indian Motocycle Assocs., Inc., 44 Mass. App. Ct. 537, 692 
N.E.2d 964, 979 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998). The First Circuit Court of Appeals articulated the elements for unjust enrichment under 
Massachusetts law, which are in accord with the aforementioned standards: ""To recover for unjust enrichment under 
Massachusetts law, [plaintiff] must show that (1) [defendant] knowingly received a benefit (2) at his expense (3) under 
circumstances that would make retention of that benefit unjust."" Frappier v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 645 F.3d 51, 58 (1st 
Cir. 2011)  [**131] (citing Mass. Eye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 552 F.3d 47, 57 (1st Cir. 2009))). Minnesota HN75[
] The prima facie elements of an unjust enrichment claim, as articulated by the Supreme Court of Minnesota, do not 
include the absence of an adequate remedy at law. That court has held: To establish an unjust enrichment claim, the claimant must show that the defendant has knowingly received or obtained 
something of value for which the defendant ""in equity and good conscience"" should pay. Klass v. Twin City Fed. Sav. and "
1423,," Loan Ass'n, 291 Minn. 68, 190 N.W.2d 493, 494-95 (1971). ""[U]njust enrichment claims do not lie simply because one party 
benefits from the efforts or obligations of others, but instead it must be shown that a party was unjustly enriched in the 
sense that the term 'unjustly' could mean illegally or unlawfully."" First Nat'l Bank v. Ramier, 311 N.W.2d 502 (Minn. 1981). ServiceMaster of St. Cloud v. GAB Business Services, Inc., 544 N.W.2d 302, 306 (Minn. 1996). Nevada HN76[
] Under Nevada law, the unavailability of an adequate remedy at law is not a part of the prima facie case for unjust 
enrichment. According to the Supreme Court of Nevada: ""Unjust enrichment is the unjust retention of a benefit  [**132] to the loss of another, or the retention of money or property of 
another against the fundamental principles of justice or equity and good conscience."" Nevada Industrial Dev. v. Benedetti, 
103 Nev. 360, 363 n.2, 741 P.2d 802, (1987). This court has observed that the essential elements of unjust enrichment ""are 
a benefit conferred on the defendant by the plaintiff, appreciation by the defendant of such benefit, and acceptance and 
retention by the defendant of such benefit."" Unionamerica Mtg. v. McDonald, 97 Nev. 210, 212, 626 P.2d 1272 (1981). Topaz Mut. Co., Inc. v. Marsh, 108 Nev. 845, 839 P.2d 606, 613 (Nev. 1992). New Mexico HN77[
] The unavailability of an adequate remedy at law is not counted among the elements of an unjust enrichment claim 
under New Mexico law. ""To prevail on a claim for unjust enrichment, 'one must show that: (1) another has been knowingly 
benefitted at one's expense (2) in a manner such that allowance of the other to retain the benefit would be unjust.'"" City of Rio 
Rancho v. Amrep Southwest Inc., 2011 NMSC 37, 150 N.M. 428, 260 P.3d 414, 428-429 (N.M. 2011) (citing Ontiveros Insulation 
Co. v. Sanchez, 2000 NMCA 51, 129 N.M. 200, 3 P.3d 695 (N.M. Ct. App. 2000)). Furthermore, in New Mexico, ""[t]here is no requirement that the creation of a statutory remedy at law for  [**133] a particular type 
of claim will automatically supplant an equitable remedy that addresses the same claim. [Any] major departure from the long 
tradition of equity practice should not be lightly implied."" Starko, Inc. v. Presbyterian Health Plan, Inc., Nos. 27,992, 29,016, 2012 
NMCA 53, 276 P.3d 252, 2011 N.M. App. LEXIS 136, 2011 WL 6429048 (N.M. Ct. App. Dec. 15, 2011) (quoting Sims v. Sims, 
1996 NMSC 78, 122 N.M. 618, 930 P.2d 153 (N.M. 1996)). ""Likewise, . . . 'unjust enrichment constitutes an independent basis 
for recovery in a civil-law action, analytically and historically distinct from the other two principal grounds for such liability, 
contract and tort.'"" Id. (quoting Hydro Conduit Corp. v. Kemble, 110 N.M. 173, 793 P.2d 855, 860 (N.M. 1990)). North Carolina HN78[
] As to unjust enrichment under North Carolina law, the pleading of an absence of an adequate remedy at law is not 
necessary to state a claim. The Supreme Court of North Carolina has observed: In order to establish a claim for unjust enrichment, a party must have conferred a benefit on the other party. The benefit 
must not have been conferred officiously, that is it must not be conferred by an interference in the affairs of the other party 
in a manner that is not justified in the circumstances. The benefit must not be  [**134] gratuitous and it must be 
measurable. . . . [T]he defendant must have consciously accepted the benefit. Booe v. Shadrick, 322 N.C. 567, 369 S.E.2d 554, 556 (N.C. 1988); see also Progressive American Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. 
Auto. Ins. Co., 184 N.C. App. 688, 647 S.E.2d 111, 116 (N.C. Ct. App. 2007) (quoting same). South Dakota HN79[
] The prima facie claim for unjust enrichment under South Dakota law does not necessarily involve addressing an 
adequate remedy at law. ""In order to establish unjust enrichment, three elements must be proven: (1) a benefit was received; (2) "
1424,," the recipient was cognizant of that benefit; and (3) the retention of the benefit without reimbursement would unjustly enrich the 
recipient."" Mack v. Mack, 2000 SD 92, 613 N.W.2d 64, 69 (S.D. 2000); see also Hofeldt v. Mehling, 2003 SD 25, 658 N.W.2d 
783, 788 (S.D. 2003) (same). Utah HN80[
] Proof of an absence of an adequate remedy at law is not required to state a prima facie claim for unjust enrichment in 
Utah. The Supreme Court of Utah has held: In order to prevail on a claim for unjust enrichment, three elements must be met. See Berrett v. Stevens, 690 P.2d 553, 557 
(Utah 1984). First, there must be a benefit conferred on one person by another. See id. Second, the conferee must 
appreciate  [**135] or have knowledge of the benefit. See id. Finally, there must be ""the acceptance or retention by the 
conferee of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the conferee to retain the benefit without 
payment of its value."" Id. The plaintiff must prove all three elements to sustain a claim of unjust enrichment. Desert Miriah, Inc. v. B & L Auto, Inc., 2000 UT 83, 12 P.3d 580, 582-83 (Utah 2000). Vermont HN81[
] To establish a prima facie claim for unjust enrichment under Vermont law, Plaintiffs are not obliged to show the 
unavailability of an adequate remedy at law. ""[T]he elements of unjust enrichment [are]: whether '(1) a benefit was conferred on 
defendant; (2) defendant accepted the benefit; and (3) defendant retained the benefit under such circumstances that it would be 
inequitable for defendant not to compensate plaintiff for its value.'"" Reed v. Zurn, 187 Vt. 613, 992 A.2d 1061, 1066 (Vt. 2010) 
(quoting Center v. Mad River Corp., 151 Vt. 408, 561 A.2d 90, 93 (Vt. 1989))."
1424,51," In Arizona, the prima facie claim for unjust enrichment includes the element of the absence of an adequate remedy at law. ""In 
Arizona, five elements must be proved to make a case of unjust enrichment: (1) an enrichment; (2) an impoverishment; (3) a 
connection between the enrichment and the impoverishment; (4) absence of justification for the enrichment and the 
impoverishment and (5) an absence of a remedy provided by law."" See Community Guardian Bank v. Hamlin, 182 Ariz. 627, 898 
P.2d 1005, 1008 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1995) (citing Sierra Vista v. Cochise Enters., 144 Ariz. 375, 697 P.2d 1125, 1131 (Ariz. Ct. App. 
1984)) (emphasis added); accord State v. Arizona Pension Planning, 154 Ariz. 56, 739 P.2d 1373, 1376 (Ariz. 1987)."
1424,52," Defendants contend that the standard for ""determining whether a remedy is 'adequate"" is ""the 'availability' of a remedy not the 
'likelihood of its success.'"" Defs.' Mot. at 50 (quoting Tudor Development Group, Inc. v. U.S. Fidelity & Guar. Co., 968 F.2d 357, 
364 (3d Cir. 1992)). However, in proposing this legal standard, which appears to be an articulation of Pennsylvania  [**137] law, 
Defendants identify no legal authority that demonstrates that this standard is recognized under the law of Arizona. In the 
absence of legal authority, the Court cannot conclude that the Defendants' proposed standard for ""adequate remedy at law"" is 
the standard applied in Arizona. Certainly, the Court has insufficient basis to presume that the highest court in that state would 
embrace such a requirement. "
1426,53," It does not appear that Plaintiffs must plead facts that demonstrate the futility  [**144] of other types of remedies against the 
egg resellers because the IPSAC does not allege any facts that might suggest such alternative means of relief for the Plaintiffs' 
losses, such as, by way of example, an unjust enrichment claim against the resellers. Cf. Chocolate, 749 F. Supp. 2d at 242 
(determining that at the motion to dismiss stage the consumer ""plaintiffs simply lack a cognizable remedy against the direct 
purchasers"" (emphasis added)). However, whether Plaintiffs will be able to successfully demonstrate on the merits the futility of 
exhausting all remedies against egg resellers (assuming that they were in privity of contract with Plaintiffs for purposes of 
Tennessee law) is an open question. "
1427,54," Defendants originally presented this argument in a far broader context, claiming generally that the Court should dismiss the 
""Plaintiffs' tag-along unjust enrichment claims in states where Plaintiffs' lack standing to bring their primary claims or where the 
primary claim fail[s] as a matter of law. Thus, for the same reasons that each of Plaintiffs[']  [**146] statutory claims fail, their 
unjust enrichment claims should be dismissed as well."" Defs.' Mot. at 43. Defendants did not identify the specific unjust 
enrichment claims that they were seeking to dismiss. Following the Plaintiffs' response brief, Defendants limited their argument 
to a charge that ""Plaintiffs are attempting . . . an 'end run' around the Illinois Brick prohibitions of . . . Utah. . . . As such, Plaintiffs 
may not bring an unjust enrichment claim under . . . Utah law for conduct that occurred prior to May 1, 2006."" Defs.' Reply at 23. "
1428,55," To the extent that Defendants rely on Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 171 F.3d at 936-
37, such reliance is misplaced. In Steamfitters, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, addressing Pennsylvania law, distinguished 
unjust enrichment claims based upon tort from unjust enrichment claims based upon breach of contract.  [**151] The Court of 
Appeals determined that when an unjust enrichment claim is based upon a tort, its causation analysis is essentially the same as 
the tort. The court had earlier determined that the plaintiff's tort claim failed because causation was too remote. And in applying 
that same causation analysis to the unjust enrichment claim, the court determined that, like the tort claim, the unjust enrichment 
claim could be dismissed for remoteness. The court was thus treating the analyses under the two claims as if they were the 
same. As a result, the court held, ""We can find no justification for permitting plaintiffs to proceed on their unjust enrichment claim once 
we have determined that the District Court properly dismissed the traditional tort claims because of the remoteness of plaintiffs' 
injuries from defendants' wrongdoing."" Id. at 937. Consequently, this statement cannot be read, as Defendants appear to 
believe, to stand for the proposition that dismissal of the tort claim in itself was the reason why the unjust enrichment claim was 
dismissed. Rather, the court dismissed both claims based on the same underlying rationale. "
1429,56," This Court earlier observed in this Opinion that there is legal authority that has determined that indirect purchasers cannot not 
recover for damages accruing prior to the May 1, 2006 effective date of the amendment to the Utah Antitrust Act. However, the 
Court granted the Defendants' motion insofar that Plaintiffs did not dispute this authority and did not raise any objections 
 [**155] to Defendants' arguments. The Court's decision thus did not address or identify the specific operative law invoked by 
Defendants in support of their argument and whether such law constituted an affirmative adoption of Illinois Brick as a policy 
prior to May 1, 2006."
1429,57," This category of factors might include, inter alia, consideration of the Plaintiffs' theory of their Utah unjust enrichment claim—
whether the claim is ""parasitic"" or ""freestanding""—and the factual allegations pled in support of the claim. See New Motor 
Vehicles, 350 F. Supp. 2d at 209 (discussing how indirect purchasers could have brought their unjust enrichment claim under 
either theory); D.R. Ward, 470 F. Supp. 2d at 506  [**156] (recognizing that ""equitable remedies for unjust enrichment claims are 
often awarded when state statutory claims prove unsuccessful"" (citing In re Cardizem Antitrust Litig., 105 F. Supp. 2d 618, 669 
(E.D. Mich. 2000))."
1429,58," Of course, Defendants may renew this argument—insofar that Defendants choose to further and appropriately develop the 
argument—at another stage in this litigation. "
1430,59," The Defendants have presented these issues in such a way that the Court is not being asked to address any questions 
involving whether for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged facts that plausibly suggest the ""conferral of a 
benefit"" element, as defined by each of the jurisdictions' law. "
1431,60," However, to the extent that Plaintiffs also argue that the IPSAC has factual allegations from which it can be inferred that the 
eggs purchased originated with the Defendants, this approach is unsuccessful. The Plaintiffs' characterizations of the IPSAC are 
inconsistent with the actual allegations. In defining the various state class members, the IPSAC alleges as to each class that ""[a]ll individuals and entities residing in 
[Name of State] that indirectly purchased shell eggs and/or egg products produced from shell eggs produced  [**164] from 
Defendants' or their co-conspirators' caged birds."" IPSAC ¶ 108. However, as Defendants correctly argue, there are no factual 
allegations as to the origin of the eggs purchased by the named individual Plaintiffs. See IPSAC ¶¶ 19-44 (""This Plaintiff 
indirectly purchased shell eggs and/or egg products during the Class Period and was injured as a result of Defendants' illegal 
conduct.""). The claims brought by the named individual Plaintiffs are the focus of this motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs argue that ""the policies at issue - the conspiracy—are the official policies of a membership organization[] representing 
'more than 95% of [the] nation's laying hens' and essentially all the largest producers."" Pls.' Resp. at 41 (citing IPSAC ¶¶ 47-51). 
By highlighting this allegation, Plaintiffs attempt to imply that 95% of laying hens in the egg industry were subject to the alleged 
conspiracy, and as such, when Plaintiffs made any egg purchase, they more than likely were purchasing from the Defendants. 
However, the factual allegation cited describes UEP alone and not the named Defendants as a group, so the allegation can only 
stand for what it says: UEP as an organization represents 95% of domestic  [**165] laying hens (by representing 198 producer 
members, IPSAC ¶ 136). While UEP as an organization might represent that percentage of laying hens, that does not necessarily mean that 95% of laying 
hens were covered by the alleged conspiracy. As alleged, UEP was not an egg producer itself. See also id. ¶ 283 (""UEP has 
declared that it did not sell eggs to consumers.""); id. ¶ 284 (""UEP does not 'market' its members' products.""). And given the 
alleged operation of the conspiracy, it would be incumbent upon producers to effectuate the eight ""coordinated actions,"" and 
thus adopt and institute UEP's policies. If follows that the hens that UEP ""represents,"" are not hens controlled by UEP, and thus 
would not reflect the number of hens actually producing ""conspiracy eggs."" See also id. ¶ 162 (""As of May 6, 2002, 123 
companies with ownership of 167 million hens filed for ""Application of Certification"" and agreed to implement the guidelines "
1432,," including increasing space allowance on 100% of their facilities. As of July 1, 2002, it was 137 companies, representing 188 
million layers.""). Regardless, to the extent that Plaintiffs are attempting to intimate that the IPSAC alleges that the Defendants' laying 
 [**166] hens collectively produced 95% (or an otherwise high percentage) of the egg market (including egg products as 
currently defined by the IPSAC) and thus that the Plaintiffs' alleged egg purchases were originally produced by Defendants, this 
is unproductive. There are no allegations that directly or inferentially support such a claim."
1432,61," This is not to say that at another stage of the litigation that similar arguments—arguments further developed in relation to 
jurisdiction-specific law—might or might not prevail."
1432,62," Defendants appear to argue that by definition only direct purchasers, and not indirect purchasers, can meet this ""direct benefit"" 
requirement. "
1434,63," Defendants do not address the Plaintiffs' argument on this point of Kansas law, suggesting that Defendants have abandoned 
this argument. "
1436,64," See id. at 923 (recognizing that a remedy for unjust enrichment is an equitable lien); see generally Restatement (First) of 
Restitution § 4 (""In situations in which a person is entitled to restitution, he is entitled, in an appropriate case, to one or more of 
the following remedies: . . . (d) a decree by a court of equity that a lien upon the subject matter or its proceeds be established, 
enforced, discharged, or reduced.""); Restatement (Third) of Restitution & Unjust Enrichment § 56 (""An equitable lien secures the 
obligation of the defendant to pay the claimant the amount of the defendant's unjust enrichment as separately determined."")."
1436,65," One of those cases cited, Concrete Products Co. v. Salt Lake County, 734 P.2d 910 (Utah 1987),  [**184] is entirely 
inapposite because its facts are based upon the finding that the defendant received no benefit whatsoever. See id. at 912 
(recognizing that as a result of the plaintiffs' supply of concrete for curbs and gutters for a development in the county, the 
defendant, the County, would not receive a benefit because the ""County will raise no revenue from the curbs and gutters, nor will 
it acquire a building with intrinsic value. Instead, it will incur the expenses of cleaning and maintaining curbs and gutters with no 
resale value or intrinsic economic worth.""). "
1439,66," The Defendants' contention that these two cases support their position is contradicted by the Defendants' original position that 
these jurisdictions ""have not ruled on whether a plaintiff must directly confer a benefit upon defendant."" Defs.' Mot. at 46."
1439,1," To wit, the Court dismisses the Utah Antitrust Act claim with respect to alleged damages occurring prior to May 1, 2006 
contained in Count XXII. The Court dismisses without prejudice: (1) the federal and state antitrust claims with respect to alleged injuries relating to 
purchases of manufactured products incorporating  [**194] processed eggs contained in Counts I, II, III, IV, VI, VII, X, XI, XII, 
XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XX, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, and XXV; (2) the Kansas Consumer Protection Act claim contained in 
Count VII; (3) the General Business Law § 349 of the New York Consumer Protection Statute claim contained in Count XVI; (4) "
1440,," the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act claim contained in Count XXIV; and (5) the North Dakota unjust 
enrichment claim contained in Count XVIII. Additionally, pursuant to the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs' withdrawal of certain claims at oral argument, the following claims are 
dismissed: (1) all claims brought under Maine law contained in Count VIII; (2) all claims brought under Puerto Rico law contained 
in Count XIX; (3) the claim brought under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 445.901, et seq. contained in Count X; (4) the claim 
brought under S.D. Codified Laws Ann. §37-24, et seq. contained in Count XX; and (5) the claim brought under Wis. Stat. §§ 
100.18, et seq. contained in Count XXV. Insofar that the Court grants in part the Motion without prejudice, Plaintiffs may seek leave to amend their complaint upon the 
appropriate motion, or stipulation, provided that  [**195] they do so promptly. "
1448,1," Several of the plaintiffs are unincorporated associations and labor organizations within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 152(5). 
HN1[
] Section 152(5) defines a labor organization as: ""any organization of any kind, or any agency or employee representation committee or plan, in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing 
with employers concerning grievances, labor disputes,  [*9] wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, or conditions of work."" "
1450,2," Initially, count two was brought on behalf of all plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have conceded that only M.R.S. has standing to pursue the 
claims alleged in count two. Doc. # 23 at 25. Accordingly, count two is dismissed with respect to all plaintiffs except M.R.S. "
1453,3," Defendant has not claimed that the challenged agreements fall within the statutory exemption. In any event, the agreements 
would not fall under the statutory exemption because the agreements concern union and non-labor party conduct. See Local 
210, 844 F.2d at 79. "
1456,4," Note that the Council of Carpenters did not move to dismiss the claims by the employer association plaintiffs on standing 
grounds."
1456,5," With respect to the 360 State Street and St. Francis projects, the complaint states that the plaintiffs were not prevented from 
bidding on those projects because the contractors did not acquiesce to pressure from Carpenters. "
1468,1," Following lengthy negotiations overseen by a court-appointed special master, Professor Eric Green, three of the eight 
Defendant hospitals — St. John Health, Oakwood Healthcare Inc, and Bon Secours Cottage Health Services — agreed to settle 
the claims  [**5] against them, and these settlements were embodied in final orders and judgments entered by the Court on 
September 8, 2010. More recently, following the August 11, 2011 hearing on the five remaining Defendants' summary judgment 
motions, the Court appointed the Honorable Layn R. Phillips as special master to conduct further settlement negotiations. To 
date, this latest round of extensive and complex negotiations has yielded tentative settlements between Plaintiffs and two more 
Defendant hospitals, Mount Clemens General Hospital, Inc. and William Beaumont Hospital. Because these latter settlements 
have not yet been finalized or formally submitted to the Court for approval, the Court will continue to include Mount Clemens and 
Beaumont among the group of five remaining Defendant hospitals referenced in the balance of this opinion."
1468,2," In addition to joining in the motion brought by the other Defendant hospitals, Defendant Mount Clemens General Hospital 
separately moved for summary judgment on the ground that the wages paid to its largely unionized RN workforce have been 
determined solely through a lawful collective bargaining process, and have not been affected by any alleged conspiracy to 
 [**6] fix RN compensation or any sharing of wage-related information with other local hospitals. In light of the tentative 
settlement reached between Plaintiffs and Mount Clemens, the Court denies this separate motion without prejudice, and will 
revisit this motion only in the event that this settlement is not finalized."
1468,3," Because of the considerable overlap in the arguments advanced in the summary judgment motions filed by the Detroit Medical 
Center and the four other Defendant hospitals, Plaintiffs have filed a single, consolidated response in opposition to these two 
motions."
1468,4," Plaintiffs' pending motion for class certification defines the class somewhat more narrowly, but this broader characterization 
suffices for present purposes. In addition, the Court  [**8] notes that the December 2002 commencement of the class period "
1469,," presumably reflects the four-year statute of limitations for federal antitrust claims, see 15 U.S.C. § 15b, with this suit having been 
filed in December of 2006. Finally, because two of the Defendant hospitals, Beaumont and Trinity, were not added as parties 
until June of 2007, the limitation period for the claims against these Defendants presumably extends back only to June of 2003, 
rather than December of 2002."
1469,5," As Plaintiffs note, the human resources manager for Defendant Mount Clemens, Paula Mutch, testified at her deposition that 
""[i]t was practice in Mount Clemens to participate  [**11] in third-party surveys, so the hospital did not participate in direct 
surveys,"" and she further clarified that ""direct"" meant ""hospital-to-hospital"" surveys. (Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. MM, Mutch Dep. at 
40.) This testimony, however, is contradicted by the evidence showing that Mount Clements did, in fact, participate in at least 
two of the surveys conducted by Mr. Dabrowski of Beaumont Hospital. (See Plaintiffs' Response, Exs. 12C, 12D.) Although 
Defendants complain that Plaintiffs have ""misquote[d]"" this testimony and taken it ""out of context,"" (Defendants' Reply Br. at 7 
n.7), the Court fails to see how Ms. Mutch's testimony can be squared with the record on this point."
1469,6," The parties draw a distinction in their briefs between ""aggregated"" compensation data —in which the information from a 
number of sources is combined and reported collectively — and ""disaggregated"" data — in which the information received from 
each source is kept and reported separately, albeit sometimes with a generic name (e.g., ""Hospital A"") substituted for the true 
source of the data. As discussed below, this distinction between ""aggregated"" and ""disaggregated"" data has significance under a 
statement issued by  [**12] the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission in August of 1996, which sets forth 
the antitrust enforcement policies of these federal agencies with regard to certain forms of joint activity in the health care 
industry. See U.S. Dep't of Justice & Federal Trade Comm'n, Statements of Antitrust Enforcement Policy in Health Care (1996) 
(""DOJ/FTC Guidelines"") (attached as Ex. 32 to Defendant DMC's Motion for Summary Judgment). "
1470,7," As noted, Beaumont's direct hospital-to-hospital surveys ceased in October of 2003, when a Beaumont management official 
issued a memo stating that the hospital would thereafter rely on twice-yearly surveys conducted by a third party, Sullivan, Cotter 
& Associates. (See Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. 11.) This memo further urged hospital officials to ""[a]ttempt to use published salary 
survey information if at all possible,"" and stated that ""[a]d hoc survey requests should be limited to positions that are critical or 
where there is a recruiting and/or retention issue."" (Id.) "
1471,8," Defendants again complain that Plaintiffs have presented this quote in a misleading light, given that Wiseman was responding 
to an e-mail from an employee at a Trinity hospital in Grand Rapids (and not a Detroit-area hospital) referencing a past practice 
of calling competing hospitals for salary information and asking whether this was ""still permissible."" (Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. 
35.) Yet, while Wiseman's comment may have  [**18] been prompted by an inquiry from a Grand Rapids employee, her 
response — prefaced as it was by the words ""I know"" —presumably was based upon her personal knowledge of what she 
referred to as a past practice of ""many informal calls"" and ""pretty freely shared"" information. (Id.) Before moving to Trinity's 
corporate compensation department, Wiseman was employed from 1997 to 2003 as a compensation analyst and compensation 
specialist at Trinity's St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor. (See Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. DDD, Wiseman Dep. at 12-13.) In 
that position, she likely would have been familiar with St. Joseph Mercy-Ann Arbor's participation in the April and July 2003 wage 
surveys conducted by Beaumont, (see Plaintiffs' Response, Exs. 12C, 12D), and she testified that she provided compensation-
related information to her counterparts at other hospitals on at least a ""sporadic basis"" while employed at St. Joseph Mercy, 
(Wiseman Dep. at 121). Thus, there is an evidentiary basis for Wiseman's claim of personal knowledge as to a past practice of 
informal contacts and freely shared information. In addition, the record certainly includes examples of Trinity's contacts with 
other Detroit-area  [**19] hospitals to exchange wage-related information, (see, e.g., Plaintiffs' Response, Exs. 7, 17, 31), and 
Wiseman's statement could well have been informed by these instances of information sharing. Regardless, then, of Wiseman's 
somewhat ambiguous deposition testimony as to her awareness of the exchange of salary information between Trinity and other 
hospitals, (see Defendants' Reply, Ex. SSS, Wiseman Dep. at 101-02), her above-quoted statement need not be read as limited 
to Grand Rapids hospitals or based on something other than her own knowledge and experience as a compensation 
professional at Trinity."
1471,9," In addition, all eight Defendant hospitals participated in a 2006 salary survey conducted by MOCA. (See Plaintiffs' Response, 
Ex. 72.) "
1472,10," Beyond the matters actually discussed at the roundtable meetings, these gatherings provided an opportunity for employees 
who handled compensation-related issues at their respective Detroit-area hospitals to meet their counterparts at other local 
institutions. Following one of these meetings in late 2005, Eileen Vernor of DMC circulated to her co-workers a list of ""health 
care compensation contacts"" who had attended the meeting, stating that ""[t]hese may or may not be familiar names but could be 
useful as you market pric[e] jobs or benchmark compensation practices."" (Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. 10E.) Vernor further opined 
that ""[o]pportunities to meet [these individuals] face-to-face are always valuable in reinforcing these contacts and establishing 
relationships,"" with these ""compensation colleagues"" having proved ""to be very generous in sharing information."" (Id.) Thus, she 
urged her co-workers to attend the forthcoming January 2006 roundtable meeting hosted by DMC. "
1473,11," As Plaintiffs point out, this was the earliest date for which documents were produced during discovery in this case. (See 
8/29/2007 Order at 4 (ordering the production of documents dating back to January 1, 2001).)"
1473,12," Notably, in a document prepared by St. John's wage and salary division, a report of the results of a July 2002 third-party 
survey — with disaggregated, unmasked hospital-by-hospital RN wage data for most of the Defendant hospitals in this case — 
is immediately preceded by a description of the DOJ/FTC Guidelines, including the recommendation that only aggregated salary 
data should be disclosed. (See Plaintiffs' Response,  [**29] Ex. 46C.) "
1474,13," As Plaintiffs note, the results of this survey reflect that one participant did, in fact, report data effective April of 2002, making it 
evident to St. John that this data had been supplied by DMC."
1474,14," Again, Plaintiffs note that Ms. Budd evidently complied with this request and provided updated survey data to St. John in 
March of 2004. (See Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. 46G.) "
1475,15," Although this survey of the record focuses on the five remaining Defendants, this should not be construed as suggesting that 
the conduct of the three settling Defendant hospitals is wholly irrelevant to the proper disposition of Plaintiffs' claims against the 
remaining Defendants. Rather, the activities of each alleged co-conspirator in the claimed antitrust conspiracy may properly be 
considered in resolving Plaintiffs' claims, even if a particular co-conspirator is no longer (or has never been) a party to the case. 
Accordingly, while the compensation practices of the  [**37] settling Defendants have been omitted from the present review, 
some of these practices are mentioned later in this opinion as pertinent to the Court's analysis of the parties' arguments in 
support of or opposition to Defendants' motions. "
1476,16," As Plaintiffs observe, another member of the compensation team had reminded Ms. Vernor about the antitrust guidelines just 
a few months earlier. Specifically, upon receiving Vernor's January 2006 e-mail (quoted earlier) in which she advised the team of 
some ""health care compensation contacts"" and characterized these colleagues as ""very generous in sharing information,"" 
(Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. 10E), team member Cynthia Cracium responded that ""[a] few years ago, many of our former contacts 
made the decision to work through 3rd party agencies due to the anti-trust laws, and we lost some valuable contacts,"" and she 
further stated that ""[i]t's still very awkward asking for information directly from other hospitals due to the legal issues that could 
arise."" (Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. 158.)"
1476,17," When asked at his deposition whether he thought it was appropriate for DMC's human resources personnel to communicate 
with other hospitals about the pay packages offered by their respective institutions, Mr. Duggan responded that ""I never gave 
 [**42] [it] any thought one way or the other."" (Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. O, Duggan Dep. at 57.) "
1477,18," DMC complains in its reply brief that Plaintiffs have misrepresented Mr. Duggan's testimony  [**43] on this point. In testimony 
immediately preceding the above-quoted passage, Mr. Duggan noted that the 2 percent merit increase for 2006 was only one of 
the pay increases for which nurses could be eligible — for example, nurses could receive additional increases by moving to a 
higher step in DMC's ""Promoting Excellence"" program, (see DMC's Motion, Ex. 4, Krueger Decl. at ¶¶ 28, 33) — and he 
explained that he ""look[ed] at all of the nurses' increases in a year together"" in making compensation decisions. (DMC's Motion, 
Ex. 10, Duggan Dep. at 52.) In DMC's view, then, Mr. Duggan had ""rejected the premise"" of the subsequent question by 
Plaintiffs' counsel that elicited his above-quoted testimony. (See DMC's Reply Br. at 14.)"
1477,19," As Defendants point out in their reply brief, the information obtained on this latter occasion evidently led the compensation 
department to  [**46] recommend a greater wage increase than it had recommended in an earlier draft of its Competitive Pay 
Analysis. (See Defendants' Reply, Ex. JJJ, Parkinson-Tripp Dep. at 192-94.)"
1477,20," Although the cited testimony of Henry Ford employee Amy Lumetta appears to make reference to a memo that has been held 
to be protected by the attorney/client privilege, (see 2/24/2009 Order), the Court nonetheless may consider Ms. Lumetta's 
testimony as to the actions taken by Henry Ford's compensation department following the dissemination of this memo. "
1478,21," Beyond these examples of direct contacts, Plaintiffs point more generally to a March 2002 report generated by Henry Ford's 
""Market-Based Compensation Recalibration Team."" (Plaintiffs' Response, Ex. 108.) As Plaintiffs observe, this report referenced 
such measures as ""[f]requent audit of competitor pay rates and practices,"" ""[a]ggressive collection of market compensation 
information from informal sources,"" and ""[c]onstant monitoring of compensation competitiveness"" by ""keep[ing] in touch with 
other Compensation representatives from the various hospitals throughout the year as to future plans and any changes to 
current pay practices."" (Id.) In a supplemental  [**47] affidavit, however, Mr. Riney states that he was a co-leader of this team, 
and he asserts (i) that the March 2002 report included only ""draft recommendations,"" (ii) that ""Henry Ford did not take any action 
with regard to any specific recommendations"" in the report, (iii) that the report ""does not reflect compensation setting practices, 
processes, or philosophy at Henry Ford,"" and (iv) that ""no department at Henry Ford, including the Compensation Department, 
ever implemented any of the [report's] recommendations."" (Defendants' Reply, Ex. HHH, Riney Suppl. Decl. at ¶¶ 5-6.) "
1479,22," Consequently, on those occasions when Mount Clemens employees responded to inquiries from other hospitals or third-party 
surveys regarding the hospital's wage rates for RNs or plans for future increases, such information was readily obtainable from 
the current CBA, which was widely available to all members of the Mount Clemens RN union."
1479,23," While Defendants claim that this information was gathered outside the class period, in 2001, the passage of Ms. Stacey's 
deposition cited in support of this contention is silent as to the date of this document."
1479,24," As Plaintiffs note, at around the time Beaumont began to use Sullivan Cotter to conduct wage surveys, this outside firm sent 
Beaumont a September 2003 letter stating that ""[a]s a result of the Justice Department guidelines regarding survey data 
exchanges, you would like to 'outsource' the collection of competitive pay data from key healthcare organizations."" (Plaintiffs' 
Response, Ex. 202.) "
1480,25," In July of 2007, after the commencement of this suit, Trinity sold its interest in Trinity-Macomb to Defendant Henry Ford, and 
this hospital is now part of Henry Ford Macomb Hospital. "
1481,26," Shortly after Ms. Murphy became her supervisor, however, Ms. Barcome was directed not to contact other hospitals to obtain 
compensation-related information. (See Barcome Dep. at 97-98.)"
1481,27," As noted earlier, two of these Defendants, Mount Clemens General Hospital and William Beaumont Hospital, recently reached 
tentative settlement agreements  [**61] with Plaintiffs, but these settlements have not yet been finalized."
1481,28," Rule 56 has recently been revised in various respects, but the language quoted here (and immediately below) reflects the 
Rule as it read when Defendants filed their motions. Under the current Rule, the bulk of the quoted language from subsection (c) 
has been moved to subsection (a), but the recent amendments do not appear to have altered the overarching standards for 
resolving a summary judgment motion. "
1484,29," Defendants' effort to explain away the InterVest  [**72] decision is unpersuasive. In Defendants' view, while the court in that 
case used separate headings in its opinion entitled ""Conspiracy on the Basis of Circumstantial Evidence"" and ""Conspiracy on 
the Basis of Consciously Parallel Behavior,"" InterVest, 340 F.3d at 163, 165, this does not necessarily mean that the court 
viewed these as ""distinct ways"" of proving a § 1 agreement. (Defendants' Reply Br. at 20.) Yet, at the very beginning of the 
second of these two sections of its opinion, the court expressly stated that ""[w]ithout any evidence of communication between 
the [defendants] or other reasonable inferences of concerted action,"" the plaintiff was obligated to proceed through a showing of 
conscious parallelism. InterVest, 340 F.3d at 165. The import of this language seems fairly clear — namely, that a showing of 
conscious parallelism is only one of the available avenues of proving a § 1 conspiracy by circumstantial means. Here, of course, 
there is substantial evidence of communications among the Defendant hospitals, which InterVest identifies as an alternative 
method for raising an inference of concerted action. "
1485,30," In light of this conclusion, the Court need not address Plaintiffs' contention that they have, in fact, presented evidence of 
parallel conduct. "
1487,31," The parties do dispute, however, whether there is a shortage of hospital nurses in the Detroit area. (Compare  [**84] Plaintiffs' 
Response Br. at 63-65 (citing evidence in support of the proposition that ""during the class period, there was a shortage of 
bedside nurses in Detroit"") with Defendants' Reply Br. at 25 (asserting that Plaintiffs' claim of a nurse shortage rests solely upon 
the ""discredited utilization analysis"" of its expert).) The Court finds it unnecessary to weigh in on this subject, in light of its 
disposition of Plaintiffs' per se § 1 claim on grounds independent from this question."
1487,32," As Plaintiffs observe, this scenario appears to be more hypothetical than real. In particular, the record fails to disclose any 
instance in which a Defendant hospital used wage data gathered from its competitors as part of an explicit attempt to ""outbid"" 
other hospitals for RNs. Such conduct, of course, would lend considerable support to the claim that Defendants' information 
exchanges served a pro-competitive purpose. By the same token, the absence of such conduct tends to suggest that the 
Defendant hospitals were acting inconsistently with their own interests by failing to exploit an advantage provided through their 
knowledge of their competitors' rates of RN compensation. "
1488,33," Plaintiffs  [**86] observe that during the class period, none of the Defendant hospitals has deviated from the market percentile 
targets disclosed in this survey."
1488,34," As Plaintiffs observe, given the time and effort involved in responding to some of the more detailed surveys, (see Plaintiffs' 
Response Br. at 12-13 n.16 (citing evidence of the time spent by employees of the Defendant hospitals to complete surveys), it 
is highly doubtful that a lower-level employee would have undertaken this task unless directed to do so, and it is also doubtful 
that a hospital's senior management would look the other way or remain ignorant as its compensation staff engaged in this task. "
1489,35," The Court returns below to a more detailed assessment of the evidence produced by Plaintiffs that purports to establish the 
impact of the Defendant hospitals' information exchanges on their wage-setting decisions. "
1490,36," In addition, Mount Clemens operated on an altogether different schedule, seeking survey data in advance of its union 
negotiations approximately every three years. "
1491,37," If one compares the underlying total hourly wage rates paid by the Defendant hospitals, rather than the annual rates of 
change, the rates for 2006 range from $30.64 (for one of the Henry Ford hospitals) to $38.66 (for one of the Oakwood facilities). 
(See id., App. G at 16.)"
1491,38," Again, looking at the underlying mean base wages paid by the Defendant hospitals, the hourly rates for 2006 range from 
$27.80 (at one of the Henry Ford facilities) to $35.00 (at one of the Oakwood locations). (See id., App. G at 48.) "
1492,39," As noted by Plaintiffs,  [**106] the courts sometimes refer to these considerations as ""plus factors"" which, when considered 
along with evidence of parallel conduct, can give rise to an inference of conspiracy sufficient to withstand summary judgment. 
See, e.g., Wallace, 55 F.3d at 1168. "
1495,40," In light of the Court's decision to grant summary judgment in Defendants' favor on Plaintiffs' per se claim, it is not necessary to 
address any additional challenges  [**118] to this claim. Nonetheless, because Defendants' present challenge as to the element 
of causation applies equally to Plaintiffs' per se and ""rule of reason"" claims, and because (as will be seen) the analysis is 
precisely the same as to either of these theories of recovery, the discussion that follows need not be strictly confined to Plaintiffs' 
""rule of reason"" claim. "
1496,41," This theory of antitrust injury, in turn, rests upon a ""benchmark"" analysis performed by Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Ashenfelter, who 
has computed a true ""competitive""  [**122] wage for RNs by reference to the fees paid by the Defendant hospitals for agency 
nurses. As a separate basis for an award of summary judgment in their favor, Defendants challenge Dr. Ashenfelter's agency fee 
benchmark analysis on a number of grounds. The Court, however, views this subject as more amenable to resolution in the 
context of Defendants' separate motion to exclude the expert testimony of Dr. Ashenfelter, which raises the same arguments 
(among others). Accordingly, the Court declines to address Defendants' challenges to Dr. Ashenfelter's expert analysis in the 
present opinion, but instead will address these matters (as necessary) in a later ruling. "
1498,42," In light of these and other examples cited by Plaintiffs, the Court fails to see how Defendants can tenably claim that Plaintiffs 
have not ""present[ed] any evidence . . . that wages would have been higher in the absence of the information exchanges 
challenged in their brief."" (Defendants' Reply Br. at 45.)"
1498,43," Plaintiffs, of course, have submitted a graph prepared by their own expert, Dr. Ashenfelter, that purports to show greater 
uniformity in Defendants' wage-setting decisions and resulting wage rates over the class period. This ""battle of the experts"" must 
be left for the trier of fact to resolve. "
1500,44," Again, Defendants argue separately that this benchmark analysis is subject to exclusion, but the Court leaves this argument 
for another day."
1500,45," To be sure, and as discussed above, the Court recognizes that Plaintiffs face difficulties of proof in showing that Defendants' 
exchanges of wage data actually did have an anticompetitive effect on RN wages, and that this effect was brought about by 
unlawful aspects of these exchanges. As explained, this evidentiary obstacle arises from the difficulty of isolating the impact of 
the unlawful, versus the lawful, aspects of these information exchanges. Yet, the detailed market analysis sought by Defendants 
would not aid Plaintiffs (or the trier of fact) in resolving this difficulty, but instead would address a different question ? namely, 
whether Defendants' exchanges of information perhaps might not raise concerns of anticompetitive effect because, for example, 
any tendency of these exchanges to depress RN wages would be offset or overcome by the ability of RNs to pursue 
employment in a non-hospital setting. As indicated below, the Court is satisfied that the more abbreviated market analysis 
 [**139] offered by Plaintiffs sufficiently addresses this question. "
1504,1,"  A more detailed factual and procedural history is set forth in this Court's October 22, 2007 Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion

1510,3,"  From 2000 to 2006, the Top 100 artists accounted for 95% of ticket revenue in Los Angeles and 94% of ticket revenue in 
Denver. (Dkt. 485-2, Expert Report of Janusz A. Ordover, Ph.D. (""Ordover Expert Report""), ¶ 167)."
1510,4,"  From 2001 to 2006, Defendants' share of the top 25 acts in Denver was 63%, compared with a 48% share of the rest of the 
market; Defendants' share of the top 25 acts in Los Angeles was 71%, compared with a 37% share of the rest of the 
market. (Ordover Expert Report, ¶ 169). "
1511,5," Dr. Phillips performed two versions of the ""Before-and-After"" analysis, one using a ""convergence"" model to predict future ticket 
prices, and one  [**29] using a ""linear trend model"" to predict future ticket prices. (See Phillips Expert Report, at ¶¶ 267-73). Both 
analyses are flawed for the reasons set forth below."
1511,6,"  See Phillips Rebuttal Report, at 39 (revised damages calculations)."
1511,7,"  ""A 'corrective disclosure' is a disclosure that reveals the fraud [allegedly perpetrated by defendants on a public company], 
or at least some aspect of the fraud, to the market."" In re Remec Inc., 702 F. Supp. 2d at 1266-67. "
1512,8,"  In his Rebuttal Report, Dr. Phillips incorporates the Consumer Price Index (""CPI"") into his analysis. This minor modification 
does not affect the Court's reasoning. "
1514,9,"  Presumably, this data includes SFX, whom Defendants acquired in 2000."
1514,10,"  Source: Phillips Rebuttal Report, Appendix 1: Revised Exhibit 5 (Denver Market), Revised Exhibit 7 (Los Angeles Market). "
1518,11,"  Dr. Phillips has, of course, performed a number of quantitative analyses, several of which are discussed earlier in this 
Order. Notably, however, none of these analyses address the fundamental question of what products should be included in 
the relevant market. Instead, they primarily relate to the calculation of Defendants' market share (presuming the product 
market is defined as Dr. Phillips proposes) and damages. (See generally Phillips Expert Report, Exhs. 1-10; cf. id. at ¶¶ 50-
62 (defining the relevant product market without reference to quantitative economic analysis)). During his deposition, Dr. Phillips conceded, ""I didn't look at any particular cross-price elasticity analyses. I looked at the 
qualitative evidence in defining the market,"" but went on to state ""I did look at the prices of Clear Channel and their sales 
and tracked their prices and sales as part of my definition of the market."" (Phillips Depo., at 373:8-13). In support, Dr. 
Phillips cited Exhibits 1 and 2 of his Expert Report. (Id. at 376:14-15). These Exhibits are not, however, analyses of what 
products should be included in the relevant product market. Instead, they appear to be precisely  [**51] what they are 
entitled, namely, analyses of ""[Denver/Los Angeles] Rock Concert Ticket Prices and Sales, Clear Channel Market Shares 
and Damage Calculations."" When analyzing and defining the relevant product market in his Expert and Rebuttal Reports, 
Dr. Phillips does not rely on either of these Exhibits. (See Expert Report, at ¶¶ 50-62; Rebuttal Report, at 1-3; 7-9). As one 
would expect, Dr. Phillips instead relies on these Exhibits to support his opinions regarding Defendants' market share, 
monopoly power, and damages calculations. Accordingly, Dr. Phillips' unsupported statements at his deposition, indicating that Exhibits 1 and 2 support his proposed 
product market definition, do not transform his admittedly qualitative evaluation of the relevant product market into a 
quantitative analysis. See Kumho, 526 U.S. at 157 (""[N]othing in either Daubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a 
district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert.""). "
1519,12,"  See Horizontal Merger Guidelines, at 9 (""Specifically, the test requires that a hypothetical profit-maximizing firm, not subject 
to price regulation, that was the only present and future seller of those products (""hypothetical monopolist"") likely would 
impose at least a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price ('SSNIP') on at least one product in the market, 
including  [**55] at least one product sold by one of the merging firms.""). "
1521,13,"  For purposes of this analysis, the Court accepts Dr. Phillips' conclusion that there is industry/public recognition of the 
purported market for ""live rock music concerts"" (i.e., the first Brown Shoe practical indicium is satisfied). Nevertheless, the 
Court notes that the industry materials upon which  [**62] Dr. Phillips purports to rely in reaching this conclusion are far 
from consistent. For example, the website www.allmusic.com, upon which Dr. Phillips relied in order to classify various artists by music 
genre, (see Phillips Depo., at 140-41), does not identify ""rock"" as a stand-alone music category, but instead lists an 
umbrella category for ""pop"" and ""rock"" combined (i.e., ""pop/rock""). The website further identifies a number of different sub-
genres of ""pop/rock"" music. (See http://www.allmusic.com/explore/genre/pop-rock-d20). Similarly, Dr. Phillips cites a June 8, 2009 USA Music Preferences report for the proposition that ""there is a well-defined 
market for the promotion of rock concerts"" and ""rock music appeals to very different audiences than [do other types of 
music.]""). (See Phillips Rebuttal Report, at 7 & n.17 (citing David McLaughlin, USA Music Preferences, Appendix 1: Music 
Preferences in the U.S. 1982-2002 (June 8, 2009), available at http://www.scribd.com/doc/16203729/Usa-Music- "
1522,," Preferences)). This Report, however, does not analyze ""rock"" as a stand-alone category. Instead, it divides ""rock"" into two 
categories — ""Classic Rock/Oldies"" and ""Rock/Heavy Metal"" — each of which  [**63] the Report analyzes independently. To reiterate, the Court does not cite these inconsistent industry definitions of various music genres in an attempt to refute 
Dr. Phillips' conclusion that there is industry/public recognition of the purported market for ""live rock music concerts."" 
Instead, the Court notes these inconsistencies because they underscore the importance of performing a thorough analysis 
of the practical indicia identified in Brown Shoe, which (as discussed below) Dr. Phillips failed to do. See generally Grason, 
571 F. Supp. at 1521 (determination of the relevant product market requires a ""detailed examination"" of the relevant 
materials). In other words, the Court could envision a scenario in which the evidence supporting a single Brown Shoe 
indicium was so overwhelming that it (at least arguably) would obviate the need for meaningful analysis of the remaining 
indicia. This is not such a case. "
1523,14,"  See also  [**67] Phillips Expert Report, at ¶ 76 (discussing various radio stations ""that often play high percentages of rock 
music""). "
1524,15,"  The Report similarly states: ""A survey conducted for the National Endowment for the Arts by the U.S. Census Bureau found 
that, for example, 'Country audiences have a distinct demographic profile, and they tend not to cross over into other types 
of music.'"" (Id.; see also Phillips Rebuttal Report, at 7 & n.17)."
1524,16,"  In his Rebuttal Report, Dr. Phillips purports to bolster his analysis based on discussions with his students regarding their 
music listening patterns. (See Phillips Rebuttal Report, at 8). The definition of the relevant product market cannnot, 
however, properly be based on such ""limited anecdotal evidence."" Metro Indus. v. Sammi Corp., 82 F.3d 839, 848 (9th Cir. 
1996) (quoting Vollrath Co. v. Sammi Corp., 9 F.3d 1455, 1462 (9th Cir. 1993)). "
1525,17,"  As discussed above, to the extent that Dr. Phillips addressed the remaining six Brown Shoe factors, he did so primarily by 
 [**73] reference to product markets (i.e., the market for all live music concerts, or ""rock/pop"" music concerts) other than 
what he contends is the relevant product market in this case (i.e., live rock music concerts). Thus, to the extent that this 
mismatched analysis is relevant to Dr. Phillips' proposed product market definition, it undermines his ultimate conclusion. "
1527,18,"  Under certain circumstances, it would be appropriate for an  [**78] economist to rely on work performed by a music analyst 
as a basis for further economic analysis. Here, however, Dr. Phillips does not purport to rely on work done by Dan Condon 
(or any other music analyst). Instead, he categorized artists — i.e., performed the work of a ""music analyst"" — himself."
1527,19,"  When asked, ""What evidence can you point to supporting your market definition that a member of the jury couldn't do on 
their own?"" Dr. Phillips responded, ""Well, if a member of a jury had a Ph.D. in economics and wanted to immerse 
themselves in this case for nine or ten years, they'd have a go at it, they'd have a possibility of reaching the same opinions I 
did."" (Phillips Depo., at 128:14-21). With respect to the specific task of categorizing artists as ""rock"" versus non-""rock"", 
however, Plaintiffs do not argue that a Ph.D. in economics is required (or that Dr. Phillips' background in any way qualifies 
him to make this determination on his own)."
1527,20,"  From the record before the Court, there  [**81] does not appear to be any ""definitive"" industry resource that categorizes 
artists in this manner. "
1528,21,"  In contrast, Dr. Phillips relied on the assistance of a music expert when performing his market analysis in the NIPP 
litigation, which is discussed further below. (See Phillips Depo., at 143:4-144:21)."
1528,22,"  Dr. Phillips also contends that Defendants' internal classifications of certain artists support his conclusions. These internal 
classifications, however, are similarly ambiguous. (See, e.g., Phillips Depo., at 162:13-63:3 (arguing that Defendants' 
classification of Madonna as ""rock/pop"" supports his categorization of Madonna as ""rock"" instead of ""pop"")). "
1529,23,"  While the NIPP court declined to rule on the admissibility of Dr. Phillips' opinion on damages, its brief discussion of this 
issue in connection with defendants' motion for summary judgment supports this Court's analysis of Dr. Phillips' damages 
calculations (discussed above): To the extent that NIPP argues that Clear Channel's prices are above industry average based on a comparison 
between average ticket prices charged in a given year by Clear Channel versus average ticket prices charged by other 
promoters, Clear Channel is correct that NIPP's failure to consider the  [**86] different costs born by Clear Channel is 
fatal to NIPP's argument. If Clear Channel promotes all of the most expensive, top artists, Clear Channel's ticket prices 
will be higher than tickets sold by other promoters, and this price difference does not indicate monopolistic pricing or 
conduct. NIPP, 311 F. Supp. 2d at 1100-01."
1529,24,"  In connection with his Expert Report submitted in this case, Dr. Phillips lists ""NIPP"" as the source for his classification of 
certain music artists. (See Yen Decl., Exh. 17). Presumably, the music expert in NIPP assisted Dr. Phillips in classifying 
these artists. Given the relatively small number of artists for which Dr. Phillips lists ""NIPP"" as the source, however, his prior 
use of a music expert in NIPP does not materially affect the Court's analysis in this case. "
1530,25,"  Nor has the Court located any such analysis in the voluminous record. See generally Carmen, 237 F.3d at 1029 (""A lawyer 
drafting an opposition to a summary judgment motion may easily show a judge, in the opposition, the evidence that the 
lawyer wants the judge to read. It is absurdly difficult for a judge to perform a search, unassisted by counsel, through the 
entire record, to look for such evidence.""). "
1535,1," The Court recognizes the difficulty of proving inequitable conduct by the clear and convincing evidence standard after 
Therasense. Even though the court concludes that SmartDrive satisfies the pleading standard in Delano Farms, DriveCam may 
bring a motion for summary judgment on the inequitable conduct issue at an appropriate time. "
1551,1," The Court assumes the allegations in the complaint to be true for the purposes of this motion. See Cahill v. Liberty Mut. Ins. 
Co., 80 F.3d 336, 338 (9th Cir. 1996)  [**4] (HN2[
] on motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court assumes the facts alleged in the complaint are true). "
1552,2," Ms. North's mother, Helen Woo, was a co-signer on the note, but was not a party to the mortgage contract. "
1553,3," Under a ""captive reinsurance arrangement,"" according to Plaintiffs, the provider of the FPI policy agrees to reinsure the FPI 
policy with a subsidiary, or ""captive reinsurer,"" of the referring servicer. FAC, at ¶ 67. In exchange for receiving a portion of the 
borrowers' premiums, the subsidiary is supposed to assume a portion of the insurer's risk of loss. Id. Defendants purportedly 
agreed to take on this risk under an ""excess of loss"" captive reinsurance arrangement. Id. at ¶ 102. Plaintiffs, however, allege 
that the excess of loss arrangement ""does not necessarily result in any actual 'losses'  [**13] being shifted to the reinsurer."" Id. 
at ¶ 99. Plaintiffs explain why this is so as follows: [I]n an excess of loss reinsurance arrangement, the reinsurer is liable only for a specified corridor or ""band"" of loss, with the 
losses below and above the band being covered by the force-placed insurance provider. In other words, the reinsurer is 
liable only for claims, or a percentage thereof, above a particular point, commonly known as an attachment or entry point, 
and subject to a ceiling, commonly known as a detachment or exit point. Under this structure, then, the reinsurer's liability 
begins, if ever, only when the force-placed insurance provider's incurred losses and expenses reach the attachment point 
and ends when such losses reach the detachment point. The likelihood of the reinsurer experiencing any real losses under this arrangement depends not only on the amount of 
losses paid by the force-placed insurer (i.e. whether the amount of claims paid by the insurer ever reaches the band where 
the reinsurer's responsibility to pay claims attaches) but also on whether the reinsurance agreement between the reinsurer 
and the force-placed insurance provider exposes the reinsurer to any real  [**14] possibility that it may be required to 
contribute its own money when called upon by the force-placed insurance provider to pay for its share of losses. Id. at ¶¶ 100-101. "
1563,4," Plaintiffs appear to suggest that this Court should collaterally review the adequacy of notice to the class because the notice 
fails to explicitly reveal the full scope of the Release. The Court, however, finds that the ""Releasees"" definition was disclosed to 
the class well before final approval of the settlement. Although it is true that the notice itself did not explicitly reveal that other 
parties besides ASIC would be released as a result of the settlement, the notice did state that, in addition to releasing ASIC, 
staying in the class means that all of the Court's orders concerning the Class will apply to you and legally bind you, including the Release 
described in detail in the Stipulation of Settlement. This Release provision describes exactly the legal  [**51] claims you 
give up if this settlement is approved and you do not exclude yourself. RJN, Ex. 3 (Wahl Notice of Class Action Settlement), ¶ 13 (emphasis added). The notice also informs members of the class that 
the Stipulation of Settlement includes more details and that a copy may be obtained by downloading it from the Internet or 
writing to class counsel. Id. at ¶ 25. Additionally, Plaintiffs give no indication that they were not otherwise apprised of the Wahl 
litigation or knew of the Releasees definition prior to final approval of the settlement; indeed, many of the changes in Plaintiffs' 
FAC, filed while final approval of the settlement was pending, suggest that Plaintiffs were attempting to salvage their case in light 
of the settlement's effects. Therefore, even if the adequacy of notice was subject to collateral review, the Court concludes that, at 
a minimum, these Plaintiffs were provided ""an adequate basis for informed decision-making"" since they knew, through the 
Stipulation of Settlement or otherwise, that Defendants were included as Releasees. See McCubbrey v. Boise Cascade Home & 
Land Corp., 71 F.R.D. 62, 68 (N.D. Cal. 1976) (Pekham, J.) (finding that plaintiffs bringing  [**52] parallel litigation were not 
adequately informed of settlement's terms only where plaintiffs received insufficient informal and formal notice). "
1565,5," To the extent Defendants argue that the claims in this case and in Wahl overlap with respect to allegations of a scheme 
between Defendants and FPI providors, the Court finds that the Wahl plaintiff's claims were not based on such allegations. The 
Wahl plaintiff did allege a scheme between ASIC and mortgage lenders, similar to the scheme alleged here. See Wahl, Dckt. 
No. 14, Plaintiff's First Amended  [**57] Complaint, ¶ 14. But that allegation in the Wahl complaint consists of a mere paragraph 
and is not the factual predicate for any of the Wahl plaintiff's claims. "
1567,6," Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs' FPI policies do not constitute a ""settlement service"" under RESPA, the Court need not 
decide whether any of Plaintiffs' claims are barred by the statute of limitations. "
1568,7," Defendants' reliance on Lass v. Bank of Am., N.A., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89519, 2011 WL 3567280 (D. Mass. Aug. 10, 2011) 
is misplaced. In Lass, the court held that the plaintiff's mortgage contract authorized the lender to increase the amount of flood 
insurance required beyond the amount required at the time the mortgage was executed. 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 89519, [WL] at 
*3. Because that aspect of Plaintiffs' mortgage contracts are not at issue in this case, the Court finds Lass unhelpful in evaluating 
Plaintiffs' claim. "
1574,8," Defendants cite to no authority for their argument that Plaintiff must plead an actual violation of a statute in order to satisfy the 
""unlawful practice"" requirement. Indeed, the statute itself, quoted above, explicitly defines the term, and a violation of a statute is 
clearly not a prerequisite to a finding of an ""unlawful practice."" "
1583,1," The R&R plan was also submitted for comment to various US government agencies, among them the New York State 
Department of Insurance, which registered no objection."
1583,2," In 2009, Equitas, with the approval of the British High Court undertook finally to relieve the Names of their obligations under the 
retrocessional treaties at issue (see Matter of Names at Lloyd's for the 1992 & Prior Years of Account, Represented by Equitas 
Ltd., [2009] EWHC 1595 [Ch], 2009 WL 1949482 [July 7, 2009])."
1583,3," Under section 9.2 (a) of the RROC, Equitas was authorized ""to adjust, handle, agree, settle, pay, compromise or repudiate any 
Claim, return premium, reinsurance premium or any other insurance or reinsurance liability on behalf of the Syndicate or Closed 
Year Syndicate."""
1583,4," This amendment, as the parties  [****13] then understood, would be essential to the action's survival, since there was no 
factually plausible contention that the Lloyd's marketplace was the relevant market in assessing whether Equitas's claims 
handling practices had an anticompetitive effect upon the retrocessional non-life insurance market. "
1584,5," The relevant allegations are contained in paragraph 36 of the complaint: ""36. In 1993, in 1996, at the time this action was commenced, and currently, the Lloyd's syndicates collective1y had market 
power in the worldwide market for retrocessional coverage. ""(a) In 1993, in 1996, at the time this action was commenced, and currently, the Lloyd's marketplace was the single most 
significant seller of most forms of non-life retrocessional coverage to reinsurers worldwide. ""(b) In 1993, in 1996, at the time this action was commenced, and currently, the Lloyd's marketplace provides the 
benchmark for prices, terms, and conditions for most forms of non-life retrocessional coverage. ""(c) In 1993, in 1996, at the time this action was commenced, and currently, any reinsurer, and any  [****15] reinsurance 
broker, wishing to purchase retrocessional coverage would have to at least consider approaching Lloyd's for quotes and 
would have to take into account the terms and conditions offered by various Lloyd's syndicates in determining what to 
purchase, and on what terms. ""(d) For many lines of retrocessional business, and in many years, competition within the Lloyd's marketplace is more 
significant to prospective purchasers of retrocessional coverage than is competition between Lloyd's as a whole and other 
sellers, because Lloyd's is expected to, and does, set the lead in establishing coverage."""
1584,6," Although there are Appellate Division decisions recognizing this basic requirement of a Donnelly Act claim (see e.g. Creative 
Trading Co. v Larkin-Pluznick-Larkin, Inc., 136 AD2d 461, 462, 523 NYS2d 102 [1st Dept 1988]), there do not appear to be any 
cases from our Court. It does not seem, however, that there would be much room for doubt as to the requirement. It is logically 
necessary to a coherent allegation of a trade restraint and has been recognized by federal courts in assessing the adequacy of 
pleadings alleging violations under the Sherman Act (15 USC § 1 et seq.; see e.g. Newcal Indus. v Ikon Office Solution, 513 F3d 
1038, 1045 [9th Cir 2008] cert denied 557 US 903, 129 S Ct 2788, 174 L Ed 2d 290 [2009]), after which the Donnelly Act is 
modeled  [****17] (see State of New York v Mobil Oil Corp., 38 NY2d 460, 463, 344 NE2d 357, 381 NYS2d 426 [1976]). "
1585,7," The Donnelly Act claim and the pendent claim for injunctive relief were all that remained of the complaint following the motion 
court's earlier dismissal of plaintiff's tortious interference claim. "
1586,8," Although, as noted (see supra at 729), the second amended complaint, while alleging a worldwide product market, retained its 
claim of a distinct submarket confined to Lloyd's, the latter is not a legally viable allegation. HN3[
] Product markets are defined 
for antitrust purposes by applying the rule of ""reasonable interchangeability"" (see Todd v Exxon Corp., 275 F3d 191, 201 [2d Cir 
2001]) and, particularly in light of the second amended complaint's allegation that the relevant market is global, i.e., that the 
subject Lloyd's product is interchangeable with retrocessional reinsurance products available worldwide, there is no plausible 
explanation for the persisting submarket allegation (see id. at 200). Global, accordingly, appears to have abandoned its 
submarket claim."
1586,9," There is no contention in this case of a per se violation; whether any restraint on trade for which defendants are shown to have 
been responsible was unreasonable is a bona fide issue in this litigation. There is no dispute that the purported conspiracy arose 
 [****23] as a response to the impending ruin of the Lloyd's marketplace, an event that defendants contend would have 
significantly reduced competition in the world market for retrocessional non-life coverage. "
1587,10," There is no contention that the reinsurance product purchased by plaintiff at the Lloyd's marketplace  [****29] was an import. 
Nor are there allegations that the alleged conspiracy was directed at any defined import market in this country (see Animal 
Science Prods., Inc. v China Minmetals Corp., 654 F3d 462, 471 n 11 [3d Cir 2011]). "
1594,1," Although there is a pending class certification motion, no class has been  [*5] certified in this case. "
1596,2," Plaintiffs acknowledge the holding of the Kentucky Speedway case, as they must. They claim, however, that the Sixth Circuit 
""did not explicitly consider the question of whether market definition is a necessary element of a conspiracy-to-monopolize 
claim."" The record here establishes,  [*13] however, that plaintiffs in the Kentucky Speedway case expressly argued in their brief 
that their conspiracy to monopolize claim did not require proof of a relevant market, a position the Sixth Circuit rejected."
1596,3," Defendants also cite Michigan Division-Monument Bldrs. of America v. Mich. Cemetery Ass'n., 524 F.3d 726 (6th Cir. 2008) as 
a Sixth Circuit case affirming dismissal of a claim of conspiracy to monopolize for failure to establish a relevant geographic "
1597,," market. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that it is not entirely clear that the case involved such claim. It is clear, however, that the 
complaint alleged a ""conspiracy to restrain trade and/or  [*14] to monopolize"" in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act but the Sixth 
Circuit does not further expand upon the matter. "
1598,4," The Dean-Suiza merger closed in December 2001. The instant lawsuit was filed in August,  [*18] 2007. Plaintiffs have

limitations period of 15 U.S.C. § 15b."

1598,6," As a result of the Court's ruling with respect to Professor Cotterill's expert opinions and the absence of any genuine issue of 
fact related to antitrust injury, the Court will not consider the other argument made by defendants, that is, that the prices Food "

found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him 
sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. The court may award under this section, pursuant to a 
motion by such person promptly made, simple interest on actual damages for the period beginning on the date of service of 
such person's pleading setting forth a claim under the antitrust laws and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter

L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988) (internal  [**8] quotation marks omitted) (quoting Nw. Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pac. Stationery & 
Printing Co., 472 U.S. 284, 289-90, 105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985)), such as horizontal agreements among 
competitors to fix prices, see Texaco, 547 U.S. at 5, or to divide markets, see Palmer v. BRG of Ga., Inc., 498 U.S. 46, 49-50, 
111 S. Ct. 401, 112 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1990) (per curiam). The Court deems these restraints to be per se unlawful. See Bus. Elecs., 
485 U.S. at 723. These practices are not at issue here."

] In the case of ""tying"" claims, a per se rule is applied in some circumstances. A tying arrangement will constitute a per 
se violation of the Sherman Act if the plaintiff proves ""(1) that the defendant tied together the sale of two distinct products or 
services; (2) that the defendant possesses enough economic power in the tying product market to coerce its customers into 
purchasing the tied product; and (3) that the tying arrangement affects a not insubstantial volume of commerce in the tied 
product market."" Cascade Health Solutions v. PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 913 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting Paladin Assocs., Inc. 
v. Mont. Power Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1159 (9th Cir. 2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The parties have disclaimed any 
contention that  [**9] the tying practices in this case are per se antitrust violations. "
1661,8," We assume for purposes of this opinion, without deciding, that high-demand and low-demand channels are actually separate 
products, and do not address the question whether it is more apt to view each Programmer's block of channels as a single 
product, which would preclude any argument that there was an illegal tying arrangement."
1661,9," Thus, there is effectively ""zero foreclosure"" of competitors. Blough, 574 F.3d at 1090-91."
1661,10," A rule to the contrary could cast doubt on whether musicians would be free to sell their hit singles only as a part of a full 
album, or writers to sell a collection of short stories. Indeed, such a rule would call into question whether Programmers and 
Distributors could sell cable channels at all, since such channels are themselves packages of separate television programs. "
1662,11," Plaintiffs claim that Theme Promotions, Inc. v. News America Marketing FSI, 546 F.3d 991, 1004 (9th Cir. 2008), supports 
their argument that reduced consumer choice and increased prices are sufficient to establish an injury to competition. Plaintiffs 
are mistaken: Theme Promotions held only that such injuries, when they are the result of an anticompetitive practice, constitute 
antitrust injury, not that any practice causing such harms was anticompetitive. Rather, the injury to competition in Theme 
Promotions was that plaintiff 's right-of-first-refusal agreements had ""foreclosed competition in a substantial share of [the] 
market."" Id. at 1001-03. The case is inapposite. "
1663,12," Indeed, because Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that the restraints at issue in this case were imposed by Programmers, not 
Distributors, Leegin suggests that any competitive threat is diminished. 551 U.S. at 898 (""If . . . a manufacturer adopted the 
policy independent of retailer pressure, the restraint is less likely to promote anticompetitive conduct.""). "
