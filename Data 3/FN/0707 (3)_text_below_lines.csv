22,2," The first amended complaint was filed after the parties met and conferred to discuss Southern SARMs's contemplated motion 
to strike and demurrer to the original complaint. "
23,3," Southern SARMs also filed a separate motion to strike those portions of the first amended complaint seeking restitution, 
including disgorgement of profits, and injunctive relief. Presenting the same arguments as contained in its demurrer, Southern 
SARMs argued those allegations constituted ""irrelevant, false or improper matter inserted in any pleading"" within the meaning of 
Code of Civil Procedure section 436."
23,4," The record on appeal does not contain a reporter's transcript of the joint hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction and 
demurrer."
23,5," In light of its order sustaining Southern SARMs's demurrer, the court deemed the motion to strike moot. "
26,6," ""Disgorgement as a remedy is broader than restitution or restoration of what the plaintiff lost. [Citations.] There are two types of 
disgorgement: restitutionary disgorgement, which focuses on the plaintiff's loss, and nonrestitutionary disgorgement, which 
focuses on the defendant's unjust enrichment. [Citation.] 'Typically, the defendant's benefit and the plaintiff's loss are the same, 
and restitution requires the defendant to restore the plaintiff to his or her original position.' [Citation.] However, '[m]any instances 
of ""liability based on unjust enrichment . . . do not involve the restoration of anything the claimant previously possessed . . . 
includ[ing] cases involving the disgorgement of profits . . . wrongfully obtained . . . ."" [Citation.] ""[T]he public policy of this state 
does not permit one to 'take advantage of his own wrong''' regardless of whether the other party suffers actual damage. 
[Citation.] Where ""a benefit has been received by the defendant but the plaintiff has not suffered a corresponding loss or, in 
some cases, any loss, but nevertheless the enrichment of the defendant would be unjust . . . the defendant may be under a duty 
to give to the plaintiff the amount by which [the defendant] has been enriched.""'"" (American Master Lease LLC v. Idanta 
Partners, Ltd. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1451, 1482, 171 Cal. Rptr. 3d 548.) "
28,7," Southern SARMs also argues the question whether sales of Ostarine or other products containing selective androgen receptor 
modulators should be banned raises issues that must be answered in the first instance by the FDA, including ""[w]hether Ostarine 
is a 'drug,' 'new drug,' 'a prescription drug,' or a 'dietary supplement' proscribed or regulated by the FDA."" Thus, it contends, 
Nutrition Distribution's request for injunctive relief is precluded by the primary jurisdiction doctrine. (See, e.g., Farmers Ins. 
Exchange v. Superior Court (1992) 2 Cal.4th 377, 390, 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 487, 826 P.2d 730 [primary jurisdiction ""'applies where a 
claim is originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of 
issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a 
case the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views'""; italics omitted].) In response, quoting extensively from Nutrition Distribution, LLC v. Custom Nutraceuticals LLC (D.Ariz. 2016) 194 F.Supp.3d 
952, in which the defendants were alleged to have violated the federal Lanham Act by engaging in false advertising of Ostarine, 
Nutrition Distribution insists the trial court can decide whether Ostarine is as safe as Southern SARMs claims without expressing 
an opinion on any technical or policy questions committed to the FDA. (See Custom Nutraceuticals, at p. 956 [the court does not 
""require FDA's expertise to determine whether it is false and misleading to market a product to competitive athletes while 
neglecting to mention that it has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. It is not clear 
that this question even implicates the FDA's regulatory scheme . . .""].) In light of our holding that the requested injunctive relief is impermissibly overbroad, we need not address the primary jurisdiction 
issue."
28,8," In an appropriate situation a court may enter an injunction requiring corrective advertising to make up for past misleading 
statements. (See, e.g., Consumers Union of U.S., Inc. v. Alta-Dena Certified Dairy (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 963, 972-974, 6 Cal. 
Rptr. 2d 193 [upholding court order requiring defendant to place a warning on its product, which it continued to sell, to correct a 
misperception created by prior false advertising].) No analogous circumstance is present in the case at bar. "
44,1," Unlike expert witnesses appointed under Rule 706, technical advisors are appointed under the court's inherent authority, and 
they do not testify at trial (and are not deposed or subject to cross examination). Joe S. Cecil & Thomas E. Willging, Court-
Appointed Experts in Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 527, 531 (Fed. Judicial Ctr. 1994). Accordingly, Professor de 
Figueiredo did not provide his independent opinion on the issues, but instead helped me understand the parties' experts' 
methodology, any assumptions underlying the experts' opinions, and how the methodology applies to the facts of this case. 
Thus, the purpose of the technical expert was to assist me in understanding the economic issues in this litigation and to enhance 
my ability to make an informed ruling on the pending motion. In this regard, Professor de Figueiredo's assistance was invaluable."
44,2," The parties fully briefed the motion. ECF Nos. 657 (sealed opening brief), 668 (redacted opening brief), 662 (redacted 
opposition), 664 (sealed opposition), 669 (sealed reply), 671 (redacted reply). A hearing is not necessary. See Loc. R. 105.6. Also pending are motions to seal the opening brief and opposition. ECF Nos. 658, 665. I have considered the motions and other 
filings in this case, included redacted versions of the sealed documents, and in the interest of protecting confidential, proprietary, 
trade secret, and/or commercially sensitive information, I will grant the motions to seal. Intellectual Ventures also has filed objections to the Joint Record Exhibits, ECF No. 674 (redacted), 675 (sealed), as well as a 
motion to seal its objections, ECF No. 676. Its motion to seal is granted for the same reasons that the summary judgment 
briefings are sealed. However, the objections are overruled. And, although I relied on the sealed briefings for this Memorandum 
Opinion, its contents do not justify sealing it, because the public's interest in a public ruling outweighs the parties' interest in 
sealing information related to this case. "

47,7," According to Professor Scott Morton, IV has approximately 40,000 patents, 7,725 of which are financial services patents. Scott 
Morton Report ¶¶ 96 n.59, 170 n.136. Professor Gilbert asserts that ""the portfolio that Intellectual Ventures initially offered to 
license to Capital One includes a much larger number of patents. Capital One's complaint characterizes Intellectual Ventures' 
offer as covering 35,000 patents."" Gilbert Report ¶ 40 (citing Third-Party Compl. ¶ 40)."

https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-08192010 (discussing SSNIP). "
49,9," It is ironic that, to support its argument that it had a good faith basis to bring patent infringement claims against Capital One in 
this case, IV designated nine Ph.D.s who would support its infringement analysis. See ECF Nos. 616 (paperless order "
50,," acknowledging receipt of expert reports, on file in chambers), 619 (letter order addressing quantity of expert reports), 621 
(correspondence from IV explaining purpose of multiple experts). If, a fortiori, it takes an assortment of Ph.D.s just to support the 
bringing of a patent infringement suit with respect to only four patents, imagine the scope of the analysis Capital One would have 
to conduct (and cost it would have to incur) in order to determine whether the technologies it had acquired before IV approached 
it with its licensing demands infringed the thousands of patents in IV's portfolio (assuming the information needed to do so was 
fully available to it, and not concealed as Capital One contends). "
56,10," Other circuits do not take this approach. E.g., In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig. Indirect Purchaser Class, 868 F.3d 132, 148 
(3d Cir. 2017) (applying two-part test from PREI without considering California Motor's standard), judgment entered sub nom. In 
re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 868 F.3d 132, 2017 WL 3529114 (3d Cir. 2017); Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells

S. Ct. 2161, 76 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1983), in labor context). "
57,11," This is not to say that the lawsuits IV has filed against Capital One could not evolve into a series if IV continues to litigate its 
patents against Capital One. "
58,12," The Eastern District of Virginia observed that ""[c]entral to Capital One's theory of monopolization [was] that IV ha[d] engaged 
in or threaten[ed] to engage in 'sham litigation' to enforce a patent portfolio whose patents are, in fact, either unenforceable or so 
weak that, absent IV's 'hold-up,' they have limited commercial value."" Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Fin. Corp., No. 
13-740 AJT, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177836, 2013 WL 6682981, at *7 (E.D. Va. Dec. 18, 2013) [**72] . But, it rejected that theory 
because Capital One failed to ""allege any specific litigation history to support that claim or identify any particular patents IV ha[d] 
attempted or threatened to enforce that have expired, been cancelled or adjudicated to be invalid."" Id. The court also found that 
""IV and Capital One do not compete in any relevant market, so it cannot be said that IV's object is to use th[at] or any other 
litigation to interfere with the business relationships of a competitor."" Id. Thus, it concluded that ""Capital One ha[d] not alleged 
facts or circumstances that would plausibly place th[at] litigation within any recognized exception to the Noerr—Pennington 
doctrine, which protects private parties from antitrust liability based on even unsuccessful litigation attempts to enforce laws with 
potential anti-competitive effects."" Id. "
59,13," Judge Trenga granted summary judgment in Capital One's favor on April 16, 2014, before the Supreme Court decided Alice 
on June 19, 2014. See Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Fin. Corp., No. 13-CV-740 AJT, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53001,

F.3d 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2015). "
63,14," As for the summary judgment ruling precluding trial by jury, because the issues had been decided by the judge at a bench 
trial, the Fourth Circuit observed that ""an equitable determination can have collateral-estoppel effect in a subsequent legal action 
and . . . this estoppel does not violate the Seventh Amendment."" Ritter, 814 F.2d at 990-91 (quoting Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. 
at 335). "
64,15," The Microsoft Court stated that, if the judgment went up on appeal, the court in which issue preclusion is raised ""must take 
care to limit is application to facts that were necessary to the judgment actually affirmed by the [appellate court]."" Microsoft, 355 
F.3d at 328. Here, Capital One appealed the dismissal of its claims in the Virginia litigation but then abandoned the appeal. See 
IV Mem. 1; Mot. to Dismiss Cross-Appeal, Ex. 11, Jt. Rec. 349-55 (stating that the question it posed for the Federal Circuit, 
""whether Capital One's antitrust counterclaims, as pleaded before discovery, alleged enough facts about the relevant market and 
Intellectual Venture's [sic] . . . conduct to state a claim,"" was ""effectively irrelevant because the District of Maryland . . . allowed 
Capital One to file new antitrust counterclaims against IV based on a more developed pleading,"" and if the Federal Circuit ruled 
in Capital One's favor, it ""would move to transfer and consolidate these claims with the ongoing litigation in Maryland, and that 
consolidation would not meaningfully expand the relief that Capital One seeks in that litigation""). "
68,1," Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of a prior order granting partial summary judgment as to the patent claims advanced in this 
action is addressed in a separate order. Dkt. 362. Etap's motion for review of Judge Mumm's July 31, 2007 discovery order is 
also addressed in a separate order. Dkt. 363. "
80,2," This is a different relevant market than the one that was alleged in the FAC. The FAC alleged that the Schneider—Etap 
Agreement had unlawfully restrained competition in the ""HR Data Center Market,"" which it defined as ""the market for the sale of 
Power Grid Design and Management Products and related services for the operation of Power Grids for use in Data Centers 
which require high levels of reliability."" FAC ¶ 43. "
84,3," Plaintiff contends that allegations of coercion are not required to state a claim under Section 1. It argues that because 
Defendants realized ""substantial financial gains"" from their horizontal agreements with each other, this ""negate[s] any need to 
allege coercion or that the illegal agreement was not easily terminable."" This characterization of the agreements as horizontal is 
not persuasive. ""Restraints imposed by agreement between competitors have traditionally been denominated horizontal 
restraints, and those imposed by agreement between firms at different levels of distribution as vertical restraints."" Business 
Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 730, 108 S. Ct. 1515, 99 L. Ed. 2d 808 (1988). The SAC alleges that 
the OSI—Etap Agreement is ""not a vertical agreement"" but instead an agreement between ""two sellers of Grid D and M 
Products into the NUPIC Markets."" Id. ¶ 79. This allegation is inconsistent with other allegations in the SAC, including that 
Plaintiff was a ""supplier of Grid D and M Products [to OSI] before the implementation of the ETAP OSI agreement."" Id. ¶ 92. 
Similarly, the SAC alleges that the Schneider—Etap Agreement is ""not a vertical agreement,"" but instead an agreement 
""between two sellers of components in a bundle offered to EMS Platform customers, where one of the two suppliers controls the 
contents of the bundle and has substantial market power."" Id. ¶ 184. This allegation is inconsistent with other allegations in the 
SAC, including that ""component suppliers are wholly reliant upon platform suppliers [in the EMS Platform Market]"" and 
""restricting or limiting the inclusion in or availability to the [EMS] platform forecloses competitive suppliers of individual 
components."" Id. ¶ 129. "
90,1," For purposes of deciding the Motion, the Court accepts the allegations of the Complaint as true and draws all permissible 
inferences in AAPS's favor. See, e.g., Active Disposal, Inc. v. City of Darien, 635 F.3d 883, 886 (7th Cir. 2011). "
93,2," AAPS's allegations regarding health insurers fare no better. According to AAPS, ABMS has worked ""to induce health insurers 
to 'use Board Certification by an ABMS Member Board as an essential tool to assess physician credentials within a given 
medical specialty.'"" (Compl. ¶ 16, Dkt. No. 1.) AAPS has not pleaded facts plausibly suggesting that ABMS has authority over 
any insurance companies sufficient to cause a restraint of trade. "
94,3," J.E.'s exclusion from one particular hospital does not constitute an antitrust injury. BCB Anesthesia Care, Ltd. v. Passavant 
Mem'l Area Hosp. Ass'n, 36 F.3d 664, 669 (7th Cir. 1994) (""A staffing decision does not itself constitute an antitrust injury."")."
94,4," Because the Court finds that AAPS has failed to state a claim for restraint of trade in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 
it need not address ABMS's argument that AAPS has failed to plead sufficient facts to establish a conspiracy. "
95,5," The Complaint invokes the Court's supplemental jurisdiction as to AAPS's claim for negligent misrepresentation. (Compl. ¶ 7, 
Dkt. No. 1.) As this case was transferred to the Northern District of Illinois for improper venue pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a), 
the choice of law rules of Illinois apply. Koutsoubos v. Casanave, 816 F. Supp. 472, 474-75 (N.D. Ill. 1993) (""[W]here an action 
was improperly filed in the transferor court, the transferee court should apply its own state's choice of law rules rather than those 
of the transferor's state."") In this case, however, the parties have not raised a conflict of laws issue, and the Court will apply 
Illinois law to the substantive aspects of AAPS's negligent misrepresentation claim. McCoy v. Iberdrola Renewables, Inc., 760 
F.3d 674, 684 (7th Cir.) reh'g denied, 769 F.3d 535 (7th Cir. 2014) (""When no party raises the choice of law issue, the federal 
court may simply apply the forum state's substantive law."")."
95,6," Because the Court finds that AAPS has failed to allege that ABMS made a false statement of material fact, it need not address 
AAPS's argument that ABMS has failed to allege reasonable reliance. "
100,1," Although the Sixth Circuit has not addressed whether a motion to amend is a dispositive or non-dispositive motion, most of the 
district courts in the Sixth Circuit, including this court, consider an order on a motion to amend to be non-dispositive. See, e.g., 
Gentry v. Tenn. Bd. of Judicial Conduct, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83215, 2017 WL 2362494, at *1 (M.D. Tenn. May 31, 2017) 
(""Courts have uniformly held that motions to amend complaints are non-dispositive matters that may be determined by the 
magistrate judge and reviewed under the clearly erroneous or contrary to law standard of review ..."") (citations omitted); Chinn v. 
Jenkins, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48258, 2017 WL 1177610 (S.D. Ohio March 31, 2017) (order denying motion to amend is not 
dispositive); Young v. Jackson, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120528, 2014 WL 4272768, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 29, 2014) (""A denial of "
101,," a motion to amend is a nondispositive order.""); Hira v. New York Life Ins. Co., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70861, 2014 WL 2177799, 
at **1-2 (E.D. Tenn. May 23, 2014) (magistrate judge's order on motion to amend was appropriate and within his authority 
because motion to amend is non-dispositive); United States v. Hunter, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155203, 2013 WL 5280251, at *1 
(S.D. Ohio Oct. 29, 2013) (stating that a magistrate judge's orders denying petitioner's motions to amend a petition pursuant to 
28 U.S.C. § 2255 were non-dispositive)."
101,2," The factual background involved in this matter is discussed in detail in the undersigned's previous Report and 
Recommendation (DE 114) and the subsequent memorandum of the Chief District Judge (DE 134). This memorandum and 
order therefore discusses only those facts necessary to address the pending motion."
101,3," Plaintiff filed a motion to file the amended complaint under seal, which was denied. See DE 152."
101,4," Plaintiff identifies these 31 jurisdictions as the following: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, the District of Columbia, 
Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, 
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, 
Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. DE 141 at 8, n.5. "
103,5," This approach is also the most conceptually and intellectually consistent with the view that motions to amend are non-
dispositive proceedings."
103,6," Plaintiff does not assert that DC 37 is subject to general personal jurisdiction in the instant matter, as such an exercise involves 
a court's ability ""to hear any and all claims against [foreign (sister-state or foreign-country) corporations] when their affiliations 
with the State are so 'continuous and systematic' as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.'"" Goodyear, 564 U.S. 
at 919, 131 S. Ct. 2846 (internal citation omitted)."
103,7," Counsel for Defendants suggested during oral arguments that pendent personal jurisdiction should not apply in the instant case 
because neither the Supreme Court nor the Sixth Circuit has formally adopted the use of such jurisdiction. This contention is 
unpersuasive in light of the use of pendent personal jurisdictions in numerous other courts in this circuit, as well as recognition of 
this principle by the Sixth Circuit. See, e.g., Beautytuft, Inc. v. Factory Ins. Ass'n, 431 F.2d 1122, 1128 (6th Cir. 1970) (affirming 
the district court's exercise of pendent personal jurisdiction); Capitol Specialty Ins. Corp. v. Splash Dogs, LLC, 801 F. Supp. 2d "
104,657," , 668 (S.D. Ohio 2011) (""The Court has little difficulty applying this concept here.""); Bennett v. Steiner-Liff Iron & Metal Co., 
714 F. Supp. 895, 897 (M.D. Tenn. 1989) (noting that pendent jurisdiction ""is a matter for the discretion of the court"")."
104,8," Defendants also note that most of the state law claims proffered in the amended complaint are similarly subject to four-year 
statutes of limitation. DE 148 at 22-23, n.9."
104,9," Amphastar's role in the current case is discussed in detail in previous opinions from both the undersigned and the Chief District 
Judge. See DE 114, 134. "
105,10, This position was advanced by Defendants during oral arguments. 
106,11," An order directing that Plaintiff's notice of additional allegations (DE 159) be unsealed is entered separately. See also DE 158 
and DE 162. The Court has considered Defendants' response to the supplemental allegations, and for the reasons herein, does 
not find that the arguments made by Defendants compel denial of the motion to amend."
106,12," The Court further notes that the tolling argument based on fraudulent concealment may be academic to the extent that it is 
simply an alternative to Plaintiff's contention that the amended complaint is not untimely because of alleged ongoing antitrust 
violations, a contention with which the Court concurs as discussed herein."
106,13, Plaintiff also notes that the district court in Packaged Ice II failed to consider the Fallick decision in its opinion. DE 153 at 16.
106,14," As discussed supra, the futility analysis is the equivalent of a Rule 12(b)(6) analysis. See Rose, 203 F.3d at 421 (6th Cir. 
2000) (""[A] proposed amendment is futile only if it could not withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.""). "
107,15," Defendants also argue (see DE 163) that Plaintiff is definitionally excluded from its own proposed new class (see DE 159) 
because the class excludes persons who transacted in generic enoxaparin or Lovenox® for purposes of resale, and the motion 
to amend must therefore be denied as futile. First, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that there is a reasonable construction of this 
class definition (see DE 166); namely, that Plaintiff is not excluded from the class, but can only claim damages for transactions 
where Plaintiff dispenses to patients at its own cost, which was previously alleged by Plaintiff (see DE 143 at ¶ 11). The Court 
further concurs that this is a semantics issue at best; nevertheless, to address Defendants' strained interpretation of the class 
definition, the Court will permit insertion of the word ""only"" in Plaintiff's class exclusion, as proposed by Plaintiff. See DE 166 at 
2, n.1. Finally, for all of the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that Defendants' arguments about the propriety of the class do 
not compel a finding of futility for purposes of a motion to amend. "
108,16," Notably, counsel for the plaintiffs failed to even appear for oral arguments on the motion for leave to amend the complaint. 
Pierre, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6471, 2006 WL 407553, at *1. "
110,17," Although the Court previously entered an order (DE 139) allowing Defendants thirty days from entry of any order granting the 
motion to amend to file an answer or other response, that order did not necessarily contemplate that further modification of the 
amended complaint might be directed. Additionally, given that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure generally compute time in 
increments of seven (7) days, the time for Defendants to respond is amended to allow for a 28-day (rather than a 30-day) 
response. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(3). "
113,1," At the time of the preliminary injunction hearing, the administrative hearing was scheduled to begin on November 28, 2017, 
within the five-month period provided by 16 C.F.R. § 3.11(b)(4). The administrative law judge has since granted an extension to 
January 17, 2018."
113,2," Because some of the testimony concerned sensitive and confidential business information of the defendants and of third 
parties, portions of the hearing were not open to the public. For the same reason, certain of the exhibits have been sealed and 
are not available to the public. Portions of this decision have been redacted to preserve that confidentiality. "

143,2," The PUC has approved the renegotiated contract, and construction of the facility is ongoing, although the final settlement with 
the Hawaiian Electric Defendants is awaiting disposition of a related state-court appeal of the PUC-approval. See ECF No. 122. "
144,3," The island of Kauai is served by Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, which is an entity not related to any of the Defendants. "
145,4," HEP provides a listing from Hawaii state court records of ""28 different legal actions against Hu Honua during this time period, 
including one that resulted in Hu Honua losing control of the facility until it paid a stipulated judgment."" ECF No. 95-1, Mem. at 8-
9 (citing Egesdal Decl., Ex. D, ECF No. 95-6). Although the court has not reviewed the substance of these actions, the court 
takes judicial notice of the existence and number of state court actions. Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001). 
And, according to the FAC, ""Hu Honua's disputes with its former construction contractor and the labor union jurisdiction dispute 
caused an irretrievable loss of time . . . [such that] Hu Honua realized that it would not be able to achieve two milestone[] dates 
set forth in the PPA[.]"" FAC ¶ 58."
145,5," The Merger Agreement required approval by the PUC. But after several months of hearings, the PUC rejected the Merger 
Agreement on July 15, 2016. See, e.g., Kathryn Mykleseth, PUC Rejects NextEra's Purchase of Hawaiian Electric, Honolulu 
Star-Advertiser, July 15, 2016 (available at http://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/07/15/business/businessbreaking/puc-rejects-
nexteras-purchase-of-hawaiian-electric/(last visited Dec. 15, 2017)."
145,6," On May 4, 2017, the PUC rejected HELCO and HECO's application to approve the purchase of HEP's facility. See Egesdal 
Decl., Ex. B., ECF No. 95-4 (In re Hawaiian Electric Co. (Hawaii P.U.C. May 4, 2017) (Decision and Order No. 34536, 2017 
Haw. PUC LEXIS 236)). The court takes judicial notice of publicly-available decisions of the PUC. See, e.g., Bartolotti v. Maui 
Mem'l Med. Ctr., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98121, 2015 WL 4545818, at *3 (D. Haw. July 28, 2015) (""The court may 'take judicial 
notice of 'matters of public record[,]' 'as long as the facts noticed are not 'subject to reasonable dispute.'"") (quoting Intri—Plex 
Techs., Inc. v. Crest Grp., Inc., 499 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2007)); id. (""'Matters of public record that may be judicially noticed 
include records and reports of administrative bodies,' and documents filed with courts, 'both within and without the federal 
judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to the matters at issue.'"") (quoting Barron v. Reich, 13 F.3d 1370, 
1377 (9th Cir. 1994) & United States v. Borneo, Inc., 971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir. 1992)). "
146,7," Paragraph 5.01(a) of the Merger Agreement also provides that such consent ""shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned 
or delayed."" ECF No. 73-3 at 5, Merger Agreement at 38. And Paragraph 5.01(c) reads in part: No Control of [HEI's] Business. [NextEra] acknowledges and agrees that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement is intended 
to give [NextEra], directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of [HEI] or an [HEI] Subsidiary [*11]  prior 
to the Effective Time and . . . prior to the Effective Time, [HEI] shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and [HEI's] Subsidiaries' respective operations. ECF No. 73-3 at 10, Merger Agreement at 43."
146,8," HEP challenges the FAC's allegation that it ""vigorously opposed"" Hu Honua's application, pointing to a public document (a 
2012 ""Statement of Position"" before the Hawaii PUC) stating in part: ""HEP does not take a position as to the prudence of 
approving the power purchase agreement. . . . Rather, HEP's position is that if the Commission does approve the Hu Honua 
PPA, it should not do so without requiring that HELCO adequate[ly] consider and plan to deal with the excess generating 
capacity that the Hu Honua asset would add[.]"" Egesdal Decl. Ex. D at 2, ECF No. 95-3 at 3. "
147,9," Given the pending settlement between Hu Honua and the Hawaiian Electric Defendants, the court is likewise deferring ruling 
on the joinders by Hawaiian Electric Defendants. For administrative purposes, as discussed at the November 6, 2017 hearing, 
the joinders are DENIED as MOOT without prejudice. ECF No. 127. "
149,10," As set forth previously, the Hawaiian Electric Defendants did not file a motion to dismiss (having instead filed joinders in 
NextEra's and HEP's Motions). Again — because the court has held any motions by the Hawaiian Electric Defendants in 
abeyance pending the settlement between Hu Honua and the Hawaiian Electric Defendants — this Order focuses on the FAC's 
allegations against NextEra and HEP. That is, the court is not specifically ruling on whether any claims (antitrust or otherwise) 
are stated (or not) as to the Hawaiian Electric Defendants. "
151,11," Furthermore, as analyzed in detail when the court considers Count Two to follow in discussion section B.2.a, the FAC's 
allegations that NextEra totally controlled HELCO's decisions after the Merger Agreement lack plausibility and thus cannot form 
the basis of NextEra's specific intent to monopolize. "
152,12," The court is not suggesting that, just because Hu Honua's facility was a qualifying facility under PURPA, the antitrust laws can 
never apply. See 16 U.S.C. § 2603(1) (""Nothing in this Act or in any amendment made by this Act affects — (1) the applicability 
of the antitrust laws to any electric utility[.]""). Rather, ""while PURPA was not intended to protect utilities from the reach of the 
antitrust laws, neither was it meant to create antitrust liability where none existed previously. In short, PURPA was designed to 
be antitrust-neutral."" Kamine/Besicorp Allegany L.P., 908 F. Supp. at 1204. And, in this instance, ""[h]owever consonant with 
PURPA's aims it may be to shield a [qualifying facility] like [plaintiff's] from price competition, that end is not something that the 
antitrust laws were designed to protect."" Id. at 1205."
152,13," Nevertheless, the FAC's allegations of antitrust injury rely in significant part on harm to retail consumers. Specifically, the FAC 
alleges that: HELCO's anticompetitive acts have caused substantial economic injury to Hu Honua and have also injured competition in 
the relevant markets by, inter alia, foreclosing, lessening, and eliminating potential competition and depriving consumers 
from securing lower rates paid for power. FAC ¶ 151 (emphasis added). The aforesaid conduct of HELCO has produced antitrust injury to Hu Honua, competition, and consumers, and unless 
enjoined by this Court, will continue to produce at least the following anticompetitive, exclusionary and injurious effects 
upon competition in interstate commerce: (a) competition for the wholesale generation of power on the Island of Hawaii has been substantially and unreasonably 
restricted, lessened, foreclosed, and eliminated, and consumers will be forced to pay supra-competitive prices for power as 
a result; FAC ¶ 152 (emphasis added). "
155,14," NextEra explains that these types of material-change provisions (which prevent a company from making significant changes to 
material contracts during the pendency of a merger) are standard terms which protect the parties' legitimate interests in a pre-
merger context. See NextEra Mot. at 16-17, ECF No. 73-1. "
157,15," Given that Count Two fails as to HEP for lack of antitrust injury and lack of a plausible conspiracy theory, the court need not 
reach HEP's alternative argument that its acts are shielded from antitrust scrutiny by the Noerr-Pennington or State Action 
Doctrines."
157,16," It is unlikely that the chapter 480 antitrust claims could otherwise survive. See HRS § 480-3 (""This chapter shall be construed 
in accordance with judicial interpretations of similar federal antitrust statutes[.]""); Int'l Healthcare Mgmt. v. Haw. Coalition for 
Health, 332 F.3d 600, 609 (9th Cir. 2003) (""[Plaintiff's] state antitrust claims fail for the same reasons as their federal claims 
because Hawaii antitrust statutes are interpreted 'in accordance with judicial interpretations of similar federal antitrust statutes.'"") 
(quoting HRS § 480-3). Nevertheless, the court has not fully analyzed the state-law allegations to determine whether the FAC 
states a claim under chapter 480. "
165,1," Sanofi alleges that Mylan blocked Auvi-Q® from all third-party payor formularies. But on at least some formularies, Mylan 
allowed other EAI drug devices to remain, just not Auvi-Q®. "
169,2," The parties do not cite, and the court has not found, any Tenth Circuit case law addressing when the price-cost test applies to 
an exclusive dealing claim based on a discount or rebate program. Our court has held that ""an MDL transferee court applies the 
law of the circuit in which it sits."" In re Syngenta AG MIR 162 Corn Litig., No. 14-md-2591-JWL, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135658, 
2016 WL 5481997, at *1 n.1 (D. Kan. Sept. 29, 2016) (first citing Murphy v. FDIC, 208 F.3d 959, 965-66 (11th Cir. 2000) (citing 
cases from the D.C., Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits); then citing Murray Energy Corp. v. United States DOD (In re United 
States DOD), 817 F.3d 261, 272 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing Murphy and following the other circuits)). And, although the transferor 
court's law is not binding precedent, it ""merits close consideration"" by the transferee court. In re Korean Air Lines Disaster, 829 
F.2d 1171, 1176, 265 U.S. App. D.C. 39 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The court thus closely considers the law of the Third Circuit (where the 
Sanofi case originated) when deciding this Motion to Dismiss. "
170,3," Mylan contends that Sanofi has taken positions that are inconsistent with the ones it asserted in Eisai—a case where Sanofi 
was accused of violating the antitrust laws through its own use of loyalty-discount contracts. But, Eisai involved different facts 
and a different procedural posture than the ones presented here. Thus, Sanofi's arguments in Eisai are of no moment to the 
motion to dismiss in this case. "
171,4," Although Tampa Electric involved a Clayton Act claim, courts also apply its analysis to exclusive dealing claims asserted under 
the Sherman Act. See ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 327 n.26 (""In substance, the Tampa Electric standard for Clayton Act Section 3 
claims differs very marginally, if at all, from the fact-intensive rule-of-reason analysis that applies to this case under Section 1 of 
the Sherman Act.""); see also Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 335 (""We need not discuss the respondents' further contention that the 
contract also violates § 1 and § 2 of the Sherman Act, for if it does not fall within the broader prescriptions of § 3 of the Clayton 
Act it follows that it is not forbidden by those of the former."")."
171,5," See, e.g., United States v. Microsoft, Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 60, 70, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (affirming district 
court's decision holding that Microsoft's exclusive dealing contracts violated § 2 of the Sherman Act where the government 
alleged ""that Microsoft attempted to monopolize the browser market and unlawfully tied its browser to its operating system so as 
to foreclose competition in the browser market""); UniStrip Techs., LLC v. LifeScan, Inc., 153 F. Supp. 3d 728, 740-41 (E.D. Pa. 
2015) (denying motion to dismiss where plaintiff alleged that defendant ""engaged in exclusive dealing, in violation of several 
antitrust laws, and that this exclusive dealing consists of bundling schemes by which rebates are offered on the condition that 
multiple products from [defendant] are purchased""); Suture Express, Inc. v. Cardinal Health 200, LLC, 963 F. Supp. 2d 1212, 
1217, 1227-29 (D. Kan. 2013) (denying motion to dismiss plaintiff's exclusive dealing claim based on contracts ""which unlawfully 
tied the sale of sutures and endo products to the sale of other products in the med-surg basket"")."
171,6," See, e.g., McWane, Inc. v. FTC, 783 F.3d 814, 819, 834-38 (11th Cir. 2015) (finding a dominant producer of domestic pipe 
fittings engaged in unlawful exclusive dealing arrangements when it threatened to take away rebates and cut off supply for 12 
weeks unless customers purchased all domestic pipe fittings exclusively from the producer); ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 
F.3d 254, 277, 289 (3d Cir. 2012) (concluding that sufficient evidence existed for a jury to find that defendant engaged in 
unlawful exclusive dealing when its contracts conditioned rebates, as well as continued product supply, on the customer's 
purchase of a specific percentage of defendant's product). "
172,7," See, e.g., E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc., 637 F.3d 435, 452-53 (4th Cir. 2011) (reversing a district court's 
dismissal of a Sherman Act § 2 claim because plaintiff sufficiently alleged that defendant's use of multi-year exclusive contracts 
constituted anticompetitive conduct and foreclosed competition in the market); Dial Corp. v. News Corp., 165 F. Supp. 3d 25, 31-
32 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (denying summary judgment against plaintiffs' exclusive dealing claim because ""the length of the exclusive 
contracts and their staggered terms may also foreclose competition"" and the evidence showed that defendant ""intentionally 
staggered the end dates of key contracts to prevent competitors from acquiring a 'critical mass' of retail distribution""). "
179,8," Mylan asserts that Sanofi's cited cases differ from the facts alleged here because, in those cases, defendants prevented the 
product from reaching the market. The Sanofi Complaint alleges similar conduct. Although the Complaint never alleges that 
Mylan prevented Sanofi from soliciting third-party payors to purchase Auvi-Q®, the Complaint alleges that Mylan's exclusive 
dealing arrangements denied consumers access to Auvi-Q® because Mylan required third-party payors to exclude Auvi-Q® from 
the drug formularies, thus blocking Auvi-Q® from reaching a significant portion of the market. These allegations suffice to allege 
harm to competition. See Visa U.S.A., 344 F.3d at 241 (""By excluding Amex and Discover [the third and fifth largest issuers of 
payment cards in the United States] from the market for outside card issuers, [defendants] effectively deny consumers access to 
products that could be offered only by a network in partnership with individual banks"" and thus the district court did not err in 
""finding that competition has been harmed by the defendants' exclusionary rules.""). "
187,1," IQ claims that antitrust standing by virtue of being a competitor of defendants and having suffered an antitrust injury. As a 
threshold matter, because IQ has not adequately alleged that it suffered an antitrust injury, this argument fails. However, even if 
IQ had alleged an antitrust injury, the case law does not stand for the proposition that antitrust standing follows antitrust injury as 
a matter of course. ""[T]he Second Circuit has made clear [that] the notion that competitors have antitrust standing is 
'oversimplified.'"" IBM v. Platform Solutions, Inc., 658 F. Supp. 2d 603, 610 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). Indeed, ""a private antitrust plaintiff's "
188,," status as a competitor is not dispositive."" Dentsply Int'l Inc. v. Dental Brands for Less, LLC, No. 15 CIV. 8775, 2016 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 149139, 2016 WL 6310777, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 27, 2016) (internal quotations omitted). Courts in the Second Circuit ""can 
ascertain antitrust injury only by identifying the anticipated anticompetitive effect of the specific practice at issue and comparing it 
to the actual injury the plaintiff alleges."" Port Dock, 507 F.3d at 122. "
192,2," See Treppel v. Biovail Corp., No. 03 CIV. 3002, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20714, 2004 WL 2339759, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 
2004), on reconsideration, No. 03CIV3002, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2737, 2005 WL 427538 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2005) 
(""Consequently, New Jersey's jurisprudence [regarding civil conspiracy] is not sufficiently developed to create a conflict with the 
law of another jurisdiction.""). "
197,1," Unlike the Sherman Act, the federal anti-trust statute, which requires evidence of a conspiracy, the Oklahoma Antitrust Reform 
Act prohibits unilateral acts that unreasonably restrain trade. See Champagne Metals v. Ken-Mac Metals, Inc., 458 F.3d 1073, 
1091 (10th Cir. 2006) (explaining distinction)."
197,2," The Oklahoma Supreme Court looked to the interpretation of federal anti-trust statutes to determine what constitutes an 
unreasonable restraint of trade under 79 O.S. § 203. See Fine Airport Parking, Inc., 71 P.3d at 10; Beville v. Curry, 2001 OK 1, 
39 P.3d 754, 759 (Okla. 2001) (""The provisions of this state's antitrust statutes are similar to federal legislation, and 
interpretation of federal antitrust legislation provides assistance in interpreting the provisions of the Oklahoma statutes.""). "
198,3," Although H&P argues that either the per se analysis or quick look analysis applies, [Doc. #68, p. 8], H&P's briefing conflates the 
two analyses. [Doc. #68, pp. 8-12]. However, because the court concludes that the Anti-Solicitation Provision is not a ""naked"" 
restraint, the quick look analysis is inapplicable. See Buccaneer Energy (USA), Inc., 846 F.3d at 1311 (indicating that a ""quick 
look"" analysis was appropriate ""where the conduct at issue amounts to a 'naked' and effective restraint on price or output that 
carries 'obvious' anticompetitive consequence"")."
198,4," Rather, courts that have considered no-hire agreements entered into upon the sale of a business have applied the rule of 
reason. See, e.g., Eichorn v. AT&T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 143-44 (3d Cir. 2001) (collecting cases)."
198,5," H&P also cites Philip Areeda and Herbert Hovenkamp's Antitrust Law for the proposition that ""agreements 'among employers 
that they will not compete against each other for the services of a particular employee or prospective employee . . . are generally 
unlawful per se""). See [Doc. #68, p. 8 (citing Philip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 2013b (2013)]. However, "
199,," the cited proposition relates to reserve clauses in professional sports contracts, a scenario clearly not implicated in the present 
matter. Thus, the court is not persuaded by H&P's citation to Areeda."
199,6," Because the court concludes that the Non-Solicitation Provision is ancillary to the broader License Agreement, the court is not 
persuaded by H&P's reference to the United States Justice Department's Antitrust Guidance for Human Resources 
Professionals. See [Doc. #68, p. 9]. "
200,7," In opposition to the motion to dismiss, H&P alleges that the motion is premature and urges the court to decline to dismiss 
counts 3 and 4 because Schlumberger's motion to dismiss is premised on disputed facts which will require determination only if 
Schlumberger prevails on counts 1 and 2. See [Doc. #68, pp. 6-7 (citing Topps Chewing Gum, Inc. v. Fleer Corp., 799 F.2d 851 
(2d Cir. 1985)]. However, the court concludes that the Amended Complaint does not allege a plausible claim for declaratory 
relief as to violation of 79 O.S. § 203(A), as pled, regardless of Schlumberger's interpretation of the Non-Solicitation Provision. "
201,8," H&P argues that a full rule of reason analysis is not required by Oklahoma law. See [Doc. #68, pp. 14-16]. The court is not 
persuaded. As recognized in Bayley, the Oklahoma Supreme Court expressly adopted the rule of reason with regard to § 217. 
H&P does not cite to, nor has the court identified, any subsequent decision by that court renouncing the rule of reason. Rather, 
H&P cites to the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision in Howard v. Nitro-Lift Techs., L.L.C., in which the court voided a contract 
provision as a matter of law without performing a complete rule of reason analysis. See [Doc. #68, p. 14 (citing Howard v. Nitro-
Lift Techs., L.L.C., 2011 OK 98, 273 P.3d 20 (Okla. 2012), vacated on other grounds, Nitro-Lift Techs., L.L.C. v. Howard, 568 
U.S. 17, 133 S. Ct. 500, 184 L. Ed. 2d 328 (2012))]. In Howard, the court did conclude that a contractual provision was void as a 
matter of law based on application of § 219A. However, Howard does not compel this court to conclude that the Oklahoma 
Supreme Court has renounced the rule of reason. Although not binding on this court, the court is persuaded by the analysis of 
the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals in Inergy Propane, which reasoned: Clearly, section 219A is intended to create a third statutory exception to the general prohibition against contracts in restraint 
of trade set forth in section 217. That does not, however, require abandonment of the rule of reason analysis required by 
previously established case law. Section 219A was not enacted in a vacuum. Nor does the language of the statute 
evidence any legislative intent to supplant the existing and extensive case law interpreting section 217. Those cases and 
the analytical approach developed therein provide the context within which to resolve the issues not specifically addressed 
by the language of section 219A. What the statute does eliminate is the need for part of the rule of reason analysis. In 
section 219A the Legislature has determined that the pro-competitive benefits of an agreement between an employer and 
an employee preventing the employee from ""directly solicit[ing] the sale of goods, services or a [*18]  combination of goods 
and services from the established customers of the former employer"" after termination of the employment outweigh the anti-
competitive effects of that agreement. Beyond that, the Legislature left the parties free to negotiate the terms of post-
employment restraints within the constraints of established legal principles. Inergy Propane, LLC, 219 P.3d at 557 (alterations in original). Thus, Howard is properly construed as a determination that the 
pro-competitive benefits of the provision in that case did not outweigh the anti-competitive effects by operation of statute, 
rendering the remainder of the rule of reason analysis moot."
201,9," Because the court concludes that neither count 3 nor count 4 states a viable claim for relief for the reasons discussed herein, 
the court does not reach Schlumberger's argument regarding whether H&P sufficiently alleged ""antitrust injury."" "
205,1," Defendants are Nongshim Co., Ltd., Nongshim America, Inc. (collectively Nongshim), Ottogi Co, Ltd., and Ottogi America, Inc. 
(collectively Ottogi). The Nongshim and Ottogi entities separately move for summary judgment. Dkt. Nos. 540-4, 544-5. "
207,2," Another Samyang employee testified that he didn't ask for ""specific"" information as to exact dates and levels of price increases, 
but more generally asked and ""about general period or degree of increase."" Yu Decl., Ex. 36, Jong-Moon Yui Examination 
Report at 9-11.(Dkt. No. 547-40) "
209,3," Nongshim objects to consideration of the media reports as conveyed in the Ottogi memo and the separate news articles as 
inadmissible hearsay. Those objections will be addressed below. "
210,4," The evidence submitted by Ottogi that flour prices increased from 2006 through 2008 is, therefore, relevant but not by itself 
determinative. See Supplemental Decl. from Kyung Ho Yoo ¶¶ 3-5 (Dkt. No. 585-4). As noted in ruling on the motions for class 
certification, plaintiffs' experts show that in the same time frame the delta between costs and profits almost tripled. Ottogi points 
to no evidence that would demonstrate that all of the allegedly collusive price increases were in fact due solely to the increases 
in the price of flour during the relevant time frame. "
211,5," Plaintiffs also point out that their injunctive relief claim under the Sherman Act is not subject to a statute of limitations defense, 
because ""there is no statute of limitations for injunctive relief claims under section 16."" Oliver v. SD-3C LLC, 751 F.3d 1081, 
1085 (9th Cir. 2014). Oppo. 13-14. However, the only stated basis for plaintiffs' injunctive relief claim is that because Nongshim 
and Ottogi are still oligarchs, they still have the power to fix prices. That may be. But, given that plaintiffs admit the conspiracy 
ended in 2010 and there is no evidence that these oligarchs conspired after 2010 or are likely to conspire together in the future, 
plaintiffs' injunctive relief claim is questionable."
211,6," In Animation I, 87 F. Supp. 3d at 1217, the parties did not dispute ""that resolution of Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim would also 
resolve Plaintiffs' Cartwright Act claim."" Therefore, Judge  Koh applied the accrual rule and rejected the discovery rule on both 
sets of claims; she did not separately analyze the Cartwright Act claims."
211,7," Plaintiffs argue that the discovery rule applies to claims under Massachusetts and New York law, while fraudulent concealment 
applies under Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, and New York law. Oppo. 16. "
212,8," As discussed below, according to plaintiffs' theory, in late 2000 or early 2001 the initial agreement was formed at this 
Representatives' Meeting. That agreement was confirmed at the March 2001 RTOA meeting."
212,9," The ""old price support system"" was how long the Ramen companies would continue to sell either products labelled with the 
""old"" price, after the new prices increases were announced, or in some instances sold new, newly labelled products at the old 
prices so as to minimize disruption to the market. Declaration of Bangwan Ku [Dkt. No. 545] ¶ 9. "
214,10," According the plaintiffs' theory, this ""Representatives' Meeting"" meeting took place in late 2000 or early 2001, and the 
representatives' agreement was solidified at the March 2001 RTOA meeting."
214,11," Objections to the Kim testimony based on speculation and lacking in personal knowledge are OVERULED. Objections based 
on hearsay, as discussed in more detail below, are OVERRULED. "
215,12," Defendants point to a portion of Ahn's deposition testimony where Ahn supposedly admitted to never having heard of the 
""Representatives Meeting"" until preparing for the KFTC leniency petition. The testimony is: ""Q: Is it true that you had never 
known about the alleged representative meeting that supposedly occurred at the end of 2000 or early 2001 until you heard about 
it from someone else while preparing one of your statements to the KFTC? A: Yes. That is correct. And that's how I testified 
earlier."" Yu Decl., Ex. 18, Ahn Depo. Tr. at 45:21-46:6. But Ahn goes onto explain that ""representative meeting"" was also 
referred to as the ""presidents meeting."" Ahn thereafter testified he attended the March 28, 2001 RTOA meeting. It appears Ahn 
thought some other meeting was meant by the ""representatives meeting."" The testimony plaintiffs rely on from Ahn is with 
respect to the March 28, 2001 RTOA meeting. That Ahn allegedly signed over his voting rights for the March 28, 2001 RTOA 
meeting to a subordinate, Changwoon Kim, was significant to the KFTC in discrediting Ahn's testimony. That issue is not directly 
addressed by plaintiffs, but again merely presents a dispute of fact."
215,13," Plaintiffs object to Ottogi's reliance on this testimony as hearsay, and move to exclude the Choi Examination Statement 
because Choi was not disclosed by Ottogi as a witness. See infra. "
216,14," In his Witness Examination, Jong Moon Yui confirmed that he asked his competitors about price information, such as about 
when prices might be increased and about ""the general period or degree of increase,"" but not about specific prices. Id. at 10-11."
216,15," Jong Moon Yui could not clearly recall about the use of an external hard drive to save information received from competitors. 
Id. at 17. He also recalled that there was a plan to buy an external hard drive to back up data in case of computer malfunctions 
and ""I remember that the work materials for the entire department were backed up along with the data for the person in charge 
of market research. We didn't just back up the data only specially for market research. I remember that materials for 
advertisement, BM, and more were all backed up."" Id. at 17. But, he also admitted that he does not know who controlled or 
managed the external hard drive. Id. at 50-51. "
217,16," Nongshim argues that all that plaintiffs have established is what they admit; that the companies' representatives would readily 
find out competitors' planned price increases before the public became aware of them but after they were announced to 
distributors (who often sold more than one company's products) by contacting those distributors. See, e.g., Nongshim MSJ at 24 
n.28, 25 n.30; Nongshim Reply at 10-11. But plaintiffs have at least some evidence that price and price support information that 
was not public even to distributors was exchanged amongst the conspirators."
217,17," Ottogi says that Samyang's witnesses confirmed that Ottogi was not involved in this exchange of information. Ottogi Reply 11. 
However, Samyang's Jong Moon Yui testified that he spoke with a specific Ottogi employee ""occasionally"" and that they 
exchanged a ""few emails."" Yu Decl., Ex. 36 at 12, 63 (admitted exchange information with Ottogi, just not as frequently as with 
Nongshim and Yakult). Yui also confirmed that he exchanged price information with Ottogi, although he could not say whether it 
was otherwise ""undisclosed"" at the relevant time, and that emails from Ottogi were sent to the marketone@hanmail.com account 
managed by Yui. Id. at 16, 20-21, 70. See also Yu Ex. 37, Kyung Joo Kim Witness Examination at 4 (""I was responsible for 
mutual and close exchange of information with competitors such as Nongshim, Paldo, and Ottogi, even including most sensitive 
pieces of information such as competitors' price increases, new product launching, sales strategies, organizational and 
personnel changes, and various market trends, and so on.""); see also id. at 5-6 (rejecting the idea that specific price increase 
information was exchanged, but rather more general information was exchanged)."
217,18," Similarly, Ottogi relies on testimony from Ottogi's own witnesses who were high enough up in the structure that they were 
responsible for setting prices and point out that these employees all denied exchanging confidential or otherwise sensitive 
information with competitors. Ottogi Reply 11. For example, Bangwan Ku testified that from what he was able to learn, he did not 
know about meetings or emails between Ottogi and Nongshim or Samyang employees because ""[b]ased upon what I was able 
to find out, I haven't seen anything like that with my own eyes."" Yu Decl., Ex. 3 at 138:17 — 140:8. The people he asked at 
Ottogi confirmed that there was ""there was no contact made with any of the competition."" Id. at 144; Ex. 4 at 19:17-20. Similarly, 
Young Hyun Doh testified that he was ""not aware of Ottogi Korea ever having possession, during the timeframe of 2000 to 2010, 
of nonpublic information regarding pricing plans of your competitors."" Yu Decl., Ex. 5 at 84:21 — 85:3. Dae Gyo Suh testified 
that he did not believe that anyone on Ottogi's marketing team would have communicated with competitors about pricing and 
production, in part because he instructed them not to do so. Yu Decl., Ex. 6 at 85:7 — 86:9, 90:10-14, 128:6-14. These 
assertions, however, appear to be undermined by documents produced by Ottogi that were prepared for the higher-up decision 
makers and produced by the departments of these lower-level employees that allegedly contain non-public information about 
Ottogi's competitors. Although some of the Ottogi witnesses who were questioned about these documents denied having seen 
them, there are material disputes of fact. "
218,19," This January 2004 memo is one of the memos that plaintiffs contend Ottogi intentionally edited and removed the information 
about its competitors before the memo was produced to the KFTC. "
219,20," As discussed below, the significance of the different types of metadata associated with documents found in the SHD is a point 
of dispute between the experts."
219,21," Defendants' computer forensic expert argues that none of the SHD emails are ""authentic"" emails because none of them were 
natively produced. See infra. As discussed below, given the other information provided about the creation and storage of 
""emails"" on the SHD (through screen shots, compilations, etc.), this goes to their weight but not their admissibility."
219,22," This SHD document's metadata shows that it was created by Nongshim with a ""last author"" who was a Yakult employee. "
220,23," Plaintiffs note that many of the Nongshim Korea (""NSK"") documents produced from this time frame mirror ones found on the 
SHD. Oppo. 29."
220,24," Ottogi in Reply does not discuss the February 29, 2008 date that plaintiffs contend Ottogi sent its non-public price information 
to Samyang, but instead argues over the date (and method) of the delivery of information from Nongshim to Ottogi. Ottogi Reply. 
at 8-9."
220,25," As acknowledged before, defendants contend that plaintiffs' experts unreasonably removed certain overhead costs that, in 
their view and as discussed extensively on the class certification motion, should be included and if included result in slim to 
negative profit margins for defendants during the conspiracy."
220,26," Ottogi attributes this increased market share and overtaking Samyang to Ottogi's improvement of taste in its Jin Ramen 
product and the development of a new higher priced premium product. Declaration of Bangwan Ku [Dkt. No. 545] ¶ 15."
220,27," The evidence in this case is markedly unlike that in In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litigation, 801 F.3d 383, 397 (3rd 
Cir. 2015), where the plaintiffs relied primarily on economic analysis and failed to offer testimony or documentary evidence to "
221,," undermine the notion that in an oligopolistic market, prices will tend to move in tandem resulting in supra-competitive prices that 
are not the product of an anticompetitive agreement. Here, plaintiffs do not rely alone on evidence of ""conscious parallelism"" to 
create a reasonable inference of a conspiracy; there is some direct evidence and additional corroborating evidence (but subject 
to dueling interpretations of significance and reliability) sufficient for plaintiffs to survive summary judgment on an issue of a 
conspiracy in Korea. Id. at 398."
221,28," Defendants rely on ""public statements"" from the KFTC that the alleged conspiracy did not involve products for the United 
States. Ottogi MSJ at 20, citing Dkt. No. 85-1 (a KFTC request for clarification to a news article); Dkt. No. 95-2 (communication "
222,," from KFTC to law firm clarifying that ""the export item (ramen) was not the target of price-fixing""). However, these statements by 
the KFTC do not bind my determination or resolution of that issue."
222,29," As discussed below, defendants object to and move to exclude the Declaration and testimony of Haggard."
222,30," As one specific example, Haggard points out that Jun (or Joon) Park simultaneously acted as Chairman of the Board and 
President of NSA and as NSK's overseas sales team. Haggard Decl. ¶ 52."
222,31," Following the hearing on these motions, Nongshim submitted a request to file an ""appendix"" of supplemental citations 
regarding lack of causation and impact in the United States. Dkt. No. 599. That appendix did not simply include supplemental 
citations, but also excerpts of expert testimony and Nongshim's characterization of the competing testimony. Id. Not surprisingly, 
plaintiffs then filed their response to Nongshim and their own supplemental memorandum re causation, supported by a 
supplemental declaration. Dkt. Nos. 602, 603. Ottogi and Nongshim then filed briefs opposing plaintiffs' filings, but also 
addressing (really readdressing) the evidence and arguments made by plaintiffs. Dkt. Nos. 605, 606. The parties' attempts to 
submit further evidence and briefing on these issues - after having been provided excess pages to make their arguments initially 
- contravenes this District's Local Rules. Nonetheless, because all parties have now had the opportunity to respond to each 
other, the motions to supplement are GRANTED and I will consider the evidence and arguments raised therein. Dkt. Nos. 599, 
602. "
223,32," Plaintiffs will, presumably, argue that Ottogi intentionally kept the U.S. price low during this period to help it ""break into"" the 
U.S. market. Plaintiffs also rely on their expert, Mangum, who ascribed the lag in part to the initial focus of at least Nongshim on 
the Korean conspiracy which, following that success, was then exported to the U.S. and other markets. Mangum Decl. [Dkt. No. 
363-6] ¶ 98."
223,33," Ottogi's witnesses testified that the export price was determined based on procurement price only plus export factors (margin, 
exchange rate) and was not set with respect to the domestic price. Yu Decl., Ex. 10, Deposition Tr. Min Hwan Choi [Dkt. No. 
547-12] 10:9 - 11:17:17."
223,34," Bangwan Ku is currently Ottogi's Deputy Senior Sales Manager for Ottogi Korea. From 2000 through 2015, he was an 
associate in the Sales Planning Office, which set prices for products produced for the Korean domestic market. Bangwan Ku 
Decl. ¶¶ 1, 2. "
224,35," Plaintiffs also rely on documents showing that after Ottogi Korea decreased its prices in 2010 based on directions from the 
KFTC, the Overseas Sales Team informed Ottogi America of that, and Ottogi America reduced its prices accordingly just nine 
days later. Cho Decl., Exs. 84, 87, 88."
224,36," Plaintiffs identify one instance of an NSK employee emailing a ""dispatched"" NSK employee on assignment at NSA an NSK 
""weekly report,"" detailing information about Samyang, Ottogi, and Yakult's market share. Cho Decl., Ex. 49 (NSK emails). 
Plaintiffs also argue that because NSA destroyed their copy of the Factbook (that had been available from NSA's website but 
was taken down after the inception of the litigation), there is an inference that other documents showing NSA's role in the 
conspiracy were likewise destroyed. Oppo. 51. This ""evidence"" is mere speculation and not sufficient to show that NSA played a 
direct role in the conspiracy emanating from Korea. "
225,37," Nongshim argues that these documents discuss export pricing to areas other than the United States, because products for the 
United States had to be ""localized"" to comply, for example, with FDA requirements. See, e.g., Nongshim Reply [Dkt. No. 607-1]. 
But that is not clear from the face of the documents or the limited testimony regarding the documents and simply demonstrates 
there are disputes of material fact."
225,38," Plaintiffs rely on two ""Approval Request"" forms and attached documents from 2003 and 2008 which they contend contradict 
Young Lee's position that NSA independently set prices without any input from NSK. Plaintiffs point out that those requests, 
proposing changes to ""transfer"" pricing between NSK and NSA, include attachments regarding NSK export and factory prices, 
as well as NSA's market supply prices. Cho Decl. Exs. 69, 73. The forms required sign offs by both NSA and NSK executives. 
One of the signatories, Joon Park, was the director and President of NSA at the same time he was a director and President of 
the International Business Division of NSK. Cho Decl., Ex. 95; Pls. Oppo. 50. The signoffs, according to plaintiffs, further 
contradict Lee's statements, and add support to Haggard's conclusions that NSA did not operate independently of NSK given the 
shared control. Haggard Decl. ¶¶ 16-21, 72."
225,39," Plaintiffs contend that even if I grant defendants' motions as to NSA and Ottogi America based on insufficient evidence of NSA 
and Ottogi America's participation in the conspiracy, the DPPs would still have standing to assert their Sherman Act damages 
claims — presumably against NSK and Ottogi Korea — because of the ""control exception."" See, e.g., Costco Wholesale Corp. v. 
AU Optronics Corp., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 180580, 2015 WL 11529919, at *1 (W.D. Wash., June 4, 2015) (standing to seek 
damages for purchases whose prices were inflated by conspiracy, even if not purchased from a conspirator as long as the seller 
was ""controlled"" by a conspirator). Given that I have found a question of fact as to the subsidiaries' participation in the 
conspiracy, I need not address it now."
225,40," Nongshim argues the exact amount of damages at issue does not need to be resolved; those sales can simply be excluded 
from the case. Nongshim MSJ at 18 n.25. "
226,41," See Mangum Decl. ¶ 131 (""That is, if NSK increases the price of cup Shin Ramyun, but NSA does not similarly begin selling 
bag Shin Ramyun at higher prices, the relative value proposition between these two products is muddled, which weakens the 
company's ability to price discriminate and attract different types of purchasers."")."
226,42," Plaintiffs also rely on an email from NSK to NSA that in light of ""domestic"" price increases there will increases in export 
products. Pls. Oppo. at 53; Cho Decl., Ex. 75. Yet Ex. 75 is characterized first by plaintiffs as a document explaining that 
Korean-export prices will be set off of ""'domestic' (i.e., Korean)"" increased prices. Then plaintiffs attempt to redefine ""domestic"" 
as used in that document to mean U.S. manufactured product. Compare Pls. Oppo. at 40 with id. at 53. Plaintiffs cannot rely on 
the same document for two different propositions."
226,43," Perhaps intentionally, plaintiffs do not separately identify the documentary evidence supporting their argument that NSA set 
the prices for U.S.-produced products with reference to NSK prices or under NSK control, and instead cite evidence generally for 
that proposition and the separate proposition that NSK influenced the price of the products NSA sold that were exported from 
Korea. "
227,44," Plaintiffs, somewhat relatedly, oppose any grant of judgment as to NSA because NSA did not own the U.S. factory until 2009. 
They assert the factory was initially owned by a separate NSK subsidiary (Nongshim Foods, Inc.) and NSA didn't own any 
portion of the factory until Nongshim Foods and NSA merged in 2009. Cho Decl., Ex. 100, Deposition Transcript of Young Hoon 
Lee at 47:20-48:13. It is unclear how this cuts in favor or against plaintiffs. However, NSA remains in this case given the 
evidence, discussed above, that NSA played some role in passing on NSK-influenced conspiracy-inflated prices. "
228,45," In their Response to Plaintiffs' Sur-Reply, the Nongshim defendants argue that there was sufficient benchmark Samyang data 
for plaintiffs' experts to consider and cite a particular spreadsheet that was reviewed by Cox. Dkt. No. 607-1 at 10. However, 
there is no explanation in Cox's declaration or in Appendix C itself to substantiate that argument."
228,46," Plaintiffs point out only that their experts found correlations between the Korean defendants' domestic prices and their 
subsidiaries' U.S. prices."
228,47," ""[T]here is statistical evidence of the collusive agreement resulting in higher prices in each of the six subperiods, controlling for 
demand and cost factors that might be changing over time. In summary, econometric tests of price fixing conduct using 
Defendants' sales data indicate that the collusive agreement caused higher prices across all (or most) product groups."" Id."
228,48," At class certification I recognized that the sufficiency of the experts' measures to control for raw material cost increases and 
the plaintiffs' experts' assumptions about the delays (and time periods used to show correlation) were contested by defendants' 
experts. Those disputes, however, should be presented to the jury and resolved at trial. "
229,49," As plaintiffs note, this case is closer to (albeit still significantly different from) the one presented in In re Cathode Ray Tube 
(CRT) Antitrust Litig., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 189474, 2016 WL 6246736, at *1 (N.D. Cal., Oct. 26, 2016). There, the market 
linkage was based on allegations and corroborating evidence that a conspiracy to fix prices on ""smaller-sized"" cathode ray tubes 
impacted the prices charged by conspirators on ""larger-sized"" CRTs. This ""price ladder"" theory of recovery was allowed to 
proceed. "
232,50," Defendants reiterate (to preserve) and make additional objections to the declarations of plaintiffs' experts Dr. Russell Mangum 
III and Danial A. Ackerberg, that were submitted by plaintiffs in support of their motions for class certification. Ottogi Evid. Obj. 
[Dkt. No. 585-5] 3-6. In my prior Order, I addressed defendants' apposite and timely raised objections to these experts' 
declarations. See generally Class Certification Order [Dkt. No. 501]. I will not reconsider the same objections, or new objections 
that should have been raised before, in conjunction with the motions for summary judgment. Defendants' objections to plaintiffs' 
experts are OVERRULED. Similarly, defendants object to plaintiffs' reliance on evidence they submitted in conjunction with 
plaintiffs' motions for sanctions. Ottogi Evid. Obj. 6-7. The fact that these materials were not resubmitted in connection with the 
motions for summary judgment is not a problem and defendants' objections to those materials on this basis is OVERRULED. Defendants also make repeated objections to documentary and declaration evidence as lacking in personal knowledge, 
incomplete, and unreliable. Those objections are OVERRULED. Holes in the documentary or declaration evidence can be 
exposed and challenged at trial. "
233,51," Of course, defendants have different reads on the import or significance of the non-Samyang evidence of conspiracy plaintiffs 
rely on. See Nongshim Evid. Objs. at 7-10"
233,52," Vaughn's declaration and explanations as to document creation information undermine Nongshim's argument that because 
the documents at issue may have been ""saved"" to the Samyang HD in 2009, they were not ""created"" at or near the time of the 
conspiratorial events and, therefore, cannot fall within the business records hearsay exception. Plaintiffs' testimony from Jeong 
Eun Park and Jong Moon Yui explain how (and why) the records were kept in the form in which they were kept as part of a 
regularly conducted business practice by Samyang. "
234,53," Authenticity objections regarding specific SHD documents that plaintiff intend to rely on at trial that have unique characteristics 
that raise questions about their authenticity may be challenged pretrial after the parties have identified their proposed exhibits. "
236,54," Ottogi argues that Ham and Kang were identified in deposition testimony by other witnesses, but the three instances Ottogi 
relies on simply identified Ham as a relative of a deponent (ECF 437-7 at 54:9-17), mention Kang and Ham in passing as 
executives involved in approving price increases (Yu Decl., Ex. B), and identified that another deponent confirmed that Kang had 
no knowledge of a meeting in 2000 - 2001. Yu Decl., Ex. C. "
237,55," The hearsay objection is not well-taken to the extent of Choi's recollection that prices were not discussed at the 2001 RTOA 
meeting because the Witness Examination Protocol of Choi is sworn and given under penalty of perjury. See, e.g., Gulf USA 
Corp. v. Federal Ins. Co., 259 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir. 2001) (finding that ""sworn deposition testimony"" from another matter 
may be used on summary judgment as an affidavit pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c))."
237,56," In Reply, plaintiffs note another new Ottogi witness that was not disclosed but is relied upon by Ottogi in its Reply; Kyung Ho 
Yoo [Dkt. No. 585-4]. Plaintiffs' Mot. Exclude Reply at 4 n.2. Because plaintiffs do not present the same evidentiary showing as 
to Yoo that they did with respect to Ham, Kang and Choi, I will not strike evidence from Yoo at this time, but plaintiffs may raise 
this issue again in a motion in limine prior to trial. "
244,1, Plaintiffs note that Taxi Rules vary among municipalities but do not identify any specific differences. 
247,2, The plaintiffs do not distinguish between the legal standard for their common law and statutory claims. 
249,3," The definitions of ""taxicab"" and ""livery vehicle"" were not changed by the January, 2015, revision. "
252,4," In its proposed reply memorandum Uber proffers an unconvincing distinction. It contrasts the magistrate judge's analysis of the 
plaintiffs' Lanham Act claim with the unfair competition claim before this Court but it fails to distinguish the unfair competition 
claim in the earlier case with the unfair competition claim here. "
253,5, Neither party contends that the legal standard varies for the state law claim. 
257,1," This Amended Order is identical to this Court's prior Order, ECF No. 43, except that it has been amended to correct a 
scrivener's error to reflect that Count I is dismissed without prejudice. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(a) (""The court may correct a clerical 
mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission whenever one is found in a judgment, order, or other part of the record. 
The court may do so on motion or on its own, with or without notice.""). "
258,2," The parties apparently agree that NFRMC is the only private hospital in Gainesville, Florida. But Plaintiff's deposition testimony 
includes some discussion of another hospital in Gainesville that also provides infectious disease services but isn't affiliated with 
Shands or the VA. See ECF No. 41-10 at 241. The existence of a second private hospital at which Plaintiff could have obtained 
privileges to kick start her private practice would probably be fatal to her federal antitrust claim. See Pierson v. Orlando Reg'l 
Healthcare Sys., Inc., 619 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1277 (M.D. Fla. 2009) (no antitrust injury when Plaintiff was not prevented from 
practicing medicine at other private hospitals in the vicinity). This Court is left wondering why Defendants fail to make the 
argument. "
265,1," In Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint and in their Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiffs Wyoming Beverages and 
Birrell Bottling bring claims under the name ""Admiral Beverages."" Admiral Beverages is not a party to this lawsuit. Plaintiffs 
clarify that they collectively refer to Wyoming Beverages and Birrell Bottling as ""Admiral Beverage,"" while the term ""Plaintiffs"" 
refers to Wyoming Beverages, Birrell Bottling, and Torrington Beverage. (Doc. 21 at 2; Doc. 33 at 2). "
269,2," Core-Mark moves to dismiss Birrell Bottling's claims under Wyoming law. Core-Mark stated it ""will assume that Wyoming law 
applies to Plaintiffs' tortious interference claims solely for the purposes of this motion, but reserves the right to challenge 
Plaintiffs' choice of Wyoming law at a later time."" (Doc. 25 at 9 n. 5 [Memo. in supp. mot. to dismiss]). While the Court has 
applied Utah law to Birrell's claims, it appears the same result would occur under either application of the law. "
280,1," The Background is a summary of the allegations in the First Amended Complaint. All well-pleaded facts are accepted as true 
for purposes of the instant motion. "
283,2," The ""unfair"" business practice claim is also based upon the alleged failure to disclose that Defendants could terminate, 
suspend, cancel or otherwise not provide Web services without notice and continue to charge for services. FAC at ¶65. The 
allegation is insufficient to state a claim for the reasons discussed in the context of Plaintiffs' UCL fraud claim and FAL claim. "
284,3," The complaint does not include a ""Count V."" "
289,1," Plaintiff's argument that further consideration be given to purchasers in exchange for their consent not to export Defendants' 
vehicles is meritless. The simple fact is that either a purchaser agrees not to export his vehicle within twelve months of purchase 
or he leaves the dealership without a vehicle. Clearly, a purchaser's consent to the Agreement is a condition of sale regardless 
of whether the financial terms are agreed to before consent is given. "
297,1," Defendants submit evidentiary objections to the declarations of Dan Montrenes and Dr. Charles J. Cicchetti, Ph.D. The evidentiary objections to Montrenes' declaration are sustained (Nos. 1-9). Montrenes states his qualifications as to his ability 
to opine on the general practices of credit card processing companies and his experience in the field, from which he bases his 
opinions as to how to ascertain class members. However, he shows no knowledge as to Defendants' payment processing 
systems or what data they maintain (See Dec. Para. 7). His opinions are thus irrelevant and speculative. The evidentiary objections to Dr. Cicchetti's declaration are sustained as to Nos. 1, 3 and 8 as they constitute inadmissible legal 
conclusions. No. 2 is overruled as his statement is based on his economic opinion of whether the 3% surcharge is a harm to 
Defendants' consumers. Nos. 4-7 regarding his methodology for calculating damages are overruled as the objections are not 
proper evidentiary objections but are disagreements on the merits of the opinion. "
300,2," Insofar as the Court can ascertain, Plaintiff did not obtain any discovery from Defendants as to the type of records they or their 
card processers maintain. "
302,3," The unrefuted evidence is that Animal, Son of a Gun, Trois Mec, Petit Trois, John & Vinny's, and Sweet Rose Creamery did not 
impose the surcharge. (See Dec. of Josh Loeb, Vincent Dotolo, Jon Shook.) "
311,1," As this is a motion to dismiss, this Court must accept all of the allegations made in Plaintiffs' operative complaint to be true. 
Giambrone v. Meritplan Ins. Co., 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29128, 2017 WL 2303980, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 28, 2017) (citation 
omitted), adopted by, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80062, 2017 WL 2303507 (E.D.N.Y. May 24, 2017). "
313,2," Defendants contend that this is not the appropriate remedy for Plaintiffs' alleged harms, which Defendants believe is more 
appropriately defined as a claim for the misappropriation of Plaintiffs' right of publicity under New York Civil Rights Law § 51. See 
Mem. ISO at 14. HN4[
] The protection against misappropriation of the right of publicity is indeed meaningfully distinct from the right against trademark infringement. See Barbara A. Solomon, Can the Lanham Act Protect Tiger Woods? An Analysis of 
Whether the Lanham Act Is A Proper Substitute for A Federal Right of Publicity, 94 Trademark Rep. 1202, 1206-07 (2004). 
Whereas trademarks seek to simultaneously protect consumers from deceptive practices and trademark owners from the 
plundering of their brand's goodwill, the right of publicity only protects the right to control the commercial use of identity. Id. This 
is a meaningful distinction. Because the Lanham Act is in part a consumer protection statute, a plaintiff must prove a likelihood of 
consumer confusion, whereas in a right of publicity claim the plaintiff need only prove misappropriation. Id. Defendants are correct that the true gravamen of Plaintiffs' claim is infringement on their right of publicity. See, e.g., Am. Compl. 
¶ 23 (""Defendants' misappropriation occurred without the Plaintiff's knowledge, consent or authorization, at no point did any 
Plaintiff ever receive any remuneration for Defendants' improper and illegal use of their Images.""). But that observation has no 
legal traction. The cause of action for false endorsement under the Lanham Act is well-accepted in this and other circuits. See 
Jackson v. Odenat, 9 F. Supp. 3d 342, 355 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (collecting cases). Plaintiffs' alleged harms, therefore, fall squarely 
within the protections of the Lanham Act. See Doe v. Friendfinder Network, Inc., 540 F. Supp. 2d 288, 306 (D.N.H. 2008) 
(denying motion to dismiss claims under § 43(a) for the unauthorized use of plaintiff's identity on adult dating website because 
the use ""falls directly"" within [the Lanham Act's] language""). "
314,3," The parties dispute whether the question is consumer confusion or celebrity status. Compare Mem. ISO at 5-8 with Opp. at 7-
10. But those two questions are obverse; HN8[
] the use of a person's persona cannot cause confusion unless the public 
recognizes the plaintiff to some degree. See Rubio, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169147, 2014 WL 6769150, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 12, 
2014). Thus, there is no bright line level of ""celebrity"" necessary to sustain a claim for false endorsement; rather, all that is 
necessary is that the plaintiff's ""identity carries some 'level of consumer recognition.'"" Id. (quoting Bondar, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
175873, at *27). "
316,4," Even if the holding in Pirone were broader, there are innumerable ways of distinguishing that case. Some courts have 
distinguished it on the grounds that the case dealt with an infringement claim brought under Section 32(1), not 43(a), as is the 
case here. See Jackson, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 355 (""[Pirone] reject[s] a celebrity's persona as a trademark for purposes of section 
32(1), not section 43(a).""). Others have distinguished it on the grounds that the calendar in Pirone featured many baseball 
players, not just Ruth. Bruce Lee Enters., LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 31155, at *61-62 (""However, Pirone is distinguishable 
from this case: while Babe Ruth's likeness appeared as one of many photographs of baseball players, AVELA's t-shirts feature 
only an image of Bruce Lee.""). Still others have noted that Pirone had the unique posture of affirming a grant of summary 
judgment after the realm of admissible evidence was fixed, rather than the more lenient standard in a motion to dismiss. See 
A.V.E.L.A., Inc. v. Estate of Marilyn Monroe, LLC, 131 F. Supp. 3d 196, 209 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (denying motion to dismiss false 
endorsement claim for infringing uses of Marilyn Monroe's image on merchandise in part because ""as noted, Pirone occurred at

318,8," Plaintiffs attempt to evade this question by arguing that they have not brought an ordinary trademark dispute but rather a claim 
for false endorsement. Opp at 12. Even if that were a legally meaningful distinction, the simple fact is that the only consumer-
oriented harm they allege is consumer confusion. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 92-93. "
320,9," McKinney's no longer includes Mr. Given's commentary in its published compilations. The most recent edition to include his 
commentary was the 2004 edition. See Richard. A Givens, Practice Commentary, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law. § 349 (McKinney 2004)."
320,10," Indeed, each of the cases relied upon by Defendants in their motion papers appear to stem from the uncritical acceptance of 
Givens' position. For example, they rely on RCA Trademark Mgmt. S.A.S. v. VOXX Int'l Corp., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111823, at 
*10 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 24, 2015). That case cites Gucci Am., Inc. v. Duty Free Apparel, Ltd., 277 F. Supp. 2d 269, 273-74 (S.D.N.Y.

320,11," A non-consumer is a party who was not the direct victim of the deceptive conduct but nevertheless suffered harms that the 
deceptive conduct caused. For example, in Fischer, the plaintiff was the inventor and producer of a honey harvesting aid for 
beekeepers who brought an action against a mailorder business that sold a knock-off version of the product. 2015 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 4395, at *3. The beekeepers who purchased the knockoff were the victims of the deceptive conduct while the plaintiff was 
an affected non-consumer. Under the majority's rule, a non-consumer like the plaintiff in Fischer must allege that the direct victims of the deception suffered 
or were likely to suffer harms more significant than mere confusion. Id. at *35. Plaintiffs who were the target market for the 
deception, however, need not allege that the deception posed any risk to health, safety, or a significant public interest. See, e.g., 
Koch v. Greenberg, 626 F. App'x 335, 340 (2d Cir. 2015) (""[G]iven that the defendant provided wine to be sold at auction to 
other consumers similarly situated to [plaintiff], the consumer-oriented conduct requirement has been met.""). "
321,12," The Governor's Bill Jacket is an authoritative public record that collects documents that bear on the legislative history of New 
York's laws. See Spiro v. Healthport Techs., LLC, 73 F. Supp. 3d 259, 264 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). It consists of ""material gathered 
by the Governor's Counsel to assist the Governor in deciding whether to sign a bill passed by the legislature."" City of N.Y. v. A-1 
Jewelry & Pawn, Inc., 501 F. Supp. 2d 369, 412 (E.D.N.Y. 2007). The Bill Jacket for Section 349 contains a report and study 
from the Committee on New York State Antitrust Law of the Antitrust Law Section of the New York State Bar Association 
because that committee drafted the law that was introduced in the legislature. See Letter from Seymour D. Lewis to Nelson A. 
Rockefeller (Feb. 10, 1970), reprinted in L. 1970, ch. 43 at 10-11. "
322,13," The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws has since removed the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices 
Act from its proposed legislation, but Mr. Dole's article includes the act in full as proposed in 1967. See 51 Minn. L.Rev. at 1015-
16."
322,14," As an initial matter, it is unclear that importing the FTCA's public interest requirement into Section 349 is appropriate. The 
FTCA may limit the FTC's enforcement authority to actions that are ""in the interest of the public,"" 15 U.S.C. 45(b), but Section 
349 imposes no such limitation on the Attorney General or on private parties. See NYGBL § 349(b), (h). Analogizing to the FTCA 
cases therefore appears to be inappropriate, as the choice to omit that requirement in a statute modeled after the FTCA 
suggests an intentional choice to omit that barrier. Accord Sovern, 52 Ohio St. L.J. at 460 (""[T]he states which borrowed the 
wording of the FTC Act did not copy the public interest requirement . . . . [therefore the] rather clear implication is that the 
limitation does not apply to actions under the state statutes, at least not in the way it has been construed by the courts and the 
FTC.""). "
325,15," Although Defendants do not specifically aim their arguments at Plaintiffs' Lanham Act or Section 349 claims, they only cite to 
decisions pertaining to the Lanham Act. See Mem. ISO at 13-14. Thus, Defendants have not raised an argument about Plaintiffs' 
Section 349 claim against the individual defendant that may be granted by this Court. See Tylena M. v. Heartshare Human 
Servs., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10398, 2004 WL 1252945, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 7, 2004) (denying motion because the moving 
party failed to cite any legal authority in support of its application). "
326,16," There appears to be some dispute over whether the combined award of actual, treble, and punitive damages may exceed 
$1,000. See Bueno v. LR Credit 18, LLC, 269 F. Supp. 3d 16, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 145388, at *4-6 (E.D.N.Y. Sep. 7, 2017). 
Neither party, however, has raised or briefed this issue, so this Court will not consider the question. Nevertheless, the issue may 
not amount to much, as at least one court in this district has said that ""federal courts within the Second Circuit, as well as state 
courts, have"" decided that punitive damages may exceed $1,000. Id. (citing Cohen v. Narragansett Bay Ins. Co., 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 134092 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2014)). "
338,1," Multiple circuit courts have also recently interpreted the Amara decision as clarifying that a Section 502(a)(3) claim is not 
automatically undermined by the presence of a Section 502(a)(1)(B) claim. See N.Y. State Psychiatric Ass'n, Inc. v. 
UnitedHealth Group, 798 F.3d 125, 134 (2d Cir. 2015) (""[I]t is not clear at the motion-to-dismiss stage of the litigation that 
monetary benefits under § 502(a)(1)(B) alone will provide him a sufficient remedy. In other words, it is too early to tell if his 
claims under § 502(a)(3) are in effect repackaged claims under § 502(a)(1)(B).""); Silva v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 762 F.3d 711, 727 
(8th Cir. 2014) (holding, in light of Amara, that ""Varity only bars duplicate recovery and does not address pleading alternate 
theories of liability""); Moyle v. Liberty Mut. Ret. Ben. Plan, 823 F.3d 948, 961 (9th Cir. 2016), as amended on denial of reh'g and 
reh'g en banc (Aug. 18, 2016) (interpreting Amara as allowing the pursuit of simultaneous claims under both Section 
502(a)(1)(B) and Section 502(a)(3), so long as there is ultimately no double recovery prohibited by Varity). "
342,2," The undersigned notes, however, that the Fifth Circuit has recognized that the language of Section 541.054 tracks the 
language of the ""boycott, coercion, or intimidation"" exemption contained in the McCarran—Ferguson Act, and has held that the 
two laws ""should be interpreted in harmony."" Sanger Ins. Agency, 802 F.3d at 749. The McCarran-Ferguson Act is a reverse 
preemption clause, aimed at restoring the primacy of the states in regulating insurance by providing that general federal laws not 
directed at insurance do not invalidate or supersede state law governing insurance. 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b); Sanger, 802 F.3d at 
741. The Act contains an exemption for federal antitrust law, which remains applicable to any ""act of boycott, coercion, or 
intimidation."" 15 U.S.C. § 1013(b). A boycott for purposes of the McCarran—Ferguson Act exemption occurs where, in order to coerce a target into certain terms on 
one transaction, parties refuse to engage in other unrelated transactions with the target. See Hartford Fire Ins. v. California, 509 
U.S. 764, 803-04, 113 S. Ct. 2891, 125 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1993). It is not a boycott within the meaning of the exemption where the 
challenged conduct is not concerted activity, i.e., it is only undertaken by individual actors. Sanger Ins. Agency, 802 F.3d at 746 
(citing St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 555, 98 S. Ct. 2923, 57 L. Ed. 2d 932 (1978)). Although the parties 
have not addressed this case law in their brief, it appears Victory's claim may be barred because it does not involve an allegation 
that Aetna acted in concert with another entity. "
351,1," This Order amends and supersedes the court's December 19, 2017 Order regarding NextEra's and HEP's Motions to Dismiss 
to add minor changes as reflected in the court's concurrently-filed Order (1) Granting In Limited Part Plaintiff Hu Honua 
Bioenergy, LLC's First Amended Motion for Reconsideration or Clarification, ECF No.133; and (2) Amending December 19, 2017 
Order."
351,2," The court sometimes refers to HELCO, HECO, and HEI collectively as the ""Hawaiian Electric Defendants."" "
352,3," The PUC has approved the renegotiated contract, and construction of the facility is ongoing, although the final settlement with 
the Hawaiian Electric Defendants is awaiting disposition of a related state-court appeal of the PUC-approval. See ECF No. 122."
352,4," The island of Kauai is served by Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, which is an entity not related to any of the Defendants. "
353,5," HEP provides a listing from Hawaii state court records of ""28 different legal actions against Hu Honua during this time period, 
including one that resulted in Hu Honua losing control of the facility until it paid a stipulated judgment."" ECF No. 95-1, Mem. at 8-
9 (citing Egesdal Decl., Ex. D, ECF No. 95-6). Although the court has not reviewed the substance of these actions, the court 
takes judicial notice of the existence and number of state court actions. Lee v. City of L.A., 250 F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001). 
And, according to the FAC, ""Hu Honua's disputes with its former construction contractor and the labor union jurisdiction dispute 
caused an irretrievable loss of time . . . [such that] Hu Honua realized that it would not be able to achieve two milestone[] dates 
set forth in the PPA[.]"" FAC ¶ 58."
353,6," The Merger Agreement required approval by the PUC. But after several months of hearings, the PUC rejected the Merger 
Agreement on July 15, 2016. See, e.g., Kathryn Mykleseth, PUC Rejects NextEra's Purchase of Hawaiian Electric, Honolulu 
Star-Advertiser, July 15, 2016 (available at http://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/07/15/business/business-breaking/puc-rejects-
nexteras-purchase-of-hawaiian-electric/(last visited Dec. 15, 2017)."
353,7," On May 4, 2017, the PUC rejected HELCO and HECO's application to approve the purchase of HEP's facility. See Egesdal 
Decl., Ex. B., ECF No. 95-4 (In re Hawaiian Electric Co. (Hawaii P.U.C. May 4, 2017) (Decision and Order No. 34536), 2017 
Haw. PUC LEXIS 236). The court takes judicial notice of publicly-available decisions of the PUC. See, e.g., Bartolotti v. Maui 
Mem'l Med. Ctr., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 98121, 2015 WL 4545818, at *3 (D. Haw. July 28, 2015) (HN1[
] ""The court may 'take "
354,," judicial notice of 'matters of public record[,]' 'as long as the facts noticed are not 'subject to reasonable dispute.'"") (quoting Intri—
Plex Techs., Inc. v. Crest Grp., Inc., 499 F.3d 1048, 1052 (9th Cir. 2007)); id. (""'Matters of public record that may be judicially 
noticed include records and reports of administrative bodies,' and documents filed with courts, 'both within and without the 
federal judicial system, if those proceedings have a direct relation to the matters at issue.'"") (quoting Barron v. Reich, 13 F.3d 
1370, 1377 (9th Cir. 1994) & United States v. Borneo, Inc., 971 F.2d 244, 248 (9th Cir. 1992))."
354,8," Paragraph 5.01(a) of the Merger Agreement also provides that such consent ""shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned 
or delayed."" ECF No. 73-3 at 5, Merger Agreement at 38. And Paragraph 5.01(c) reads in part: No Control of [HEI's] Business. [NextEra] acknowledges and agrees that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement is intended 
to give [NextEra], directly or indirectly, the right to control or [*11]  direct the operations of [HEI] or an [HEI] Subsidiary prior 
to the Effective Time and . . . prior to the Effective Time, [HEI] shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of 
this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and [HEI's] Subsidiaries' respective operations. ECF No. 73-3 at 10, Merger Agreement at 43."
354,9," HEP challenges the FAC's allegation that it ""vigorously opposed"" Hu Honua's application, pointing to a public document (a 
2012 ""Statement of Position"" before the Hawaii PUC) stating in part: ""HEP does not take a position as to the prudence of 
approving the power purchase agreement. . . . Rather, HEP's position is that if the Commission does approve the Hu Honua 
PPA, it should not do so without requiring that HELCO adequate[ly] consider and plan to deal with the excess generating 
capacity that the Hu Honua asset would add[.]"" Egesdal Decl. Ex. D at 2, ECF No. 95-3 at 3. "
355,10," Given the pending settlement between Hu Honua and the Hawaiian Electric Defendants, the court is likewise deferring ruling 
on the joinders by Hawaiian Electric Defendants. For administrative purposes, as discussed at the November 6, 2017 hearing, 
the joinders are DENIED as MOOT without prejudice. ECF No. 127. "
357,11," As set forth previously, the Hawaiian Electric Defendants did not file a motion to dismiss (having instead filed joinders in 
NextEra's and HEP's Motions). Again — because the court has held any motions by the Hawaiian Electric Defendants in 
abeyance pending the settlement between Hu Honua and the Hawaiian Electric Defendants — this Order focuses on the FAC's 
allegations against NextEra and HEP. That is, the court is not specifically ruling on whether any claims (antitrust or otherwise) 
are stated (or not) as to the Hawaiian Electric Defendants. "
358,12," To be clear, this dismissal is only as to monopolization or attempted monopolization claims against NextEra; the court is not 
reaching to any extent whether such claims are, or could be, properly stated against any other Defendant. "
359,13," Furthermore, as analyzed in detail when the court considers Count Two to follow in discussion section B.2.a, the FAC's 
allegations that NextEra totally controlled HELCO's decisions after the Merger Agreement lack plausibility and thus cannot form 
the basis of NextEra's specific intent to monopolize. "
360,14," The court is not suggesting that, just because Hu Honua's facility was a qualifying facility under PURPA, the antitrust laws can 
never apply. See 16 U.S.C. § 2603(1) (""Nothing in this Act or in any amendment made by this Act affects — (1) the applicability 
of the antitrust laws to any electric utility[.]""). Rather, HN11[
] ""while PURPA was not intended to protect utilities from the reach of the antitrust laws, neither was it meant to create antitrust liability where none existed previously. In short, PURPA was 
designed to be antitrust-neutral."" Kamine/Besicorp Allegany L.P., 908 F. Supp. at 1204. And, in this instance, ""[h]owever 
consonant with PURPA's aims it may be to shield a [qualifying facility] like [plaintiff's] from price competition, that end is not 
something that the antitrust laws were designed to protect."" Id. at 1205."
360,15," Nevertheless, the FAC's allegations of antitrust injury rely in significant part on harm to retail consumers. Specifically, the FAC 
alleges that: HELCO's anticompetitive acts have caused substantial economic injury to Hu Honua and have also injured competition in 
the relevant markets by, inter alia, foreclosing, lessening, and eliminating potential competition and depriving consumers 
from securing lower rates paid for power. FAC ¶ 151 (emphasis added). The aforesaid conduct of HELCO has produced antitrust injury to Hu Honua, competition, and consumers, and unless 
enjoined by this Court, will continue to produce at least the following anticompetitive, exclusionary and injurious effects 
upon competition in interstate commerce: (a) competition for the wholesale generation of power on the Island of Hawaii has been substantially and unreasonably 
restricted, lessened, foreclosed, and eliminated, and consumers will be forced to pay supra-competitive prices for power as 
a result; FAC ¶ 152 (emphasis added). "
363,16," NextEra explains that these types of material-change provisions (which prevent a company from making significant changes to 
material contracts during the pendency of a merger) are standard terms which protect the parties' legitimate interests in a pre-
merger context. See NextEra Mot. at 16-17, ECF No. 73-1. "
365,17," Given that Count Two fails as to HEP for lack of antitrust injury and lack of a plausible conspiracy theory, the court need not 
reach HEP's alternative argument that its acts are shielded from antitrust scrutiny by the Noerr-Pennington or State Action 
Doctrines."
365,18," It is unlikely that the chapter 480 antitrust claims could otherwise survive. See HRS § 480-3 (""This chapter shall be construed 
in accordance with judicial interpretations of similar federal antitrust statutes[.]""); Int'l Healthcare Mgmt. v. Haw. Coalition for 
Health, 332 F.3d 600, 609 (9th Cir. 2003) (""[Plaintiff's] state antitrust claims fail for the same reasons as their federal claims 
because Hawaii antitrust statutes are interpreted 'in accordance with judicial interpretations of similar federal antitrust statutes.'"") 
(quoting HRS § 480-3). Nevertheless, the court has not fully analyzed the state-law allegations to determine whether the FAC 
states a claim under chapter 480. "
368,1," The named plaintiffs originally included John R. Bloyer, Jr. and Adrianne L. Bloyer. They have voluntarily dismissed their 
individual claims. (Doc. 120). "
370,2," Conceivably, an owner of an unredeemed property could claim that it would have redeemed it at the ""reasonable and 
appropriate"" penalty rate, but that the inflated rate caused them to forego the option. However, that is neither the claim before 
the Court, nor one that would be appropriate for class treatment as it would be speculative and would require extensive 
individual inquiries. "
372,3," Kevin Dvorak testified in his deposition that his wife handles the financial matters in the household, that he was not significantly 
involved with the current matter and had no personal knowledge of any of the allegations in the Complaint other than the fact "
373,," that he owned the properties, and that they were sold for delinquent taxes and eventually redeemed. (Docs. 271-5 at 3 and 278-
6 at 4-5)."
373,4," Brosh, a competing tax auction buyer, steered Kathleen Dvorak to attorney Don Weber, who in turn referred her to Plaintiffs' 
Counsel's law firm. (Id. at 6-7). "
374,5," Subsequent to filing their Motion for Class Certification, Plaintiffs disclosed Dr. Carl Peters as an expert. Dr. Peters appears to 
have conducted some statistical analyses regarding the overall results of the 2006 and 2007 tax year auctions and how they 
compare with other years and other counties. (Peters Expert Report, Doc. 255-1). While Dr. Peters posits an overall potential 
damage figure, he offers no figures or methodology which would enable a finder of fact to determine whether any given parcel 
had been impacted by the alleged anticompetitive behavior. "
377,1," Antitrust standing is distinct from Article III standing. As the court noted when it dismissed plaintiff's First Amended Complaint, 
plaintiff also does not appear to have Article III standing because it has not allegedly suffered an actual or imminent injury in fact, 
and this alone would be enough to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. See Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 
409, 133 S. Ct. 1138, 185 L. Ed. 2d 264 (2013); Maya v. Centex Corp., 658 F.3d 1060, 1067 (9th Cir. 2011) (injury in fact must 
be ""actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical""); cf. Brotech Corp. v. White Eagle Int'l Techs. Grp., Inc., No. Civ.A.03-
232, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11552, 2004 WL 1427136, at *6 (E.D. Pa. June 21, 2004) (antitrust injury was too speculative where 
there were insufficient allegations regarding how far plaintiff had gone in seeking ""FDA approval, when such approval may be 
anticipated, or whether it will be prepared to enter the product to market"" upon FDA approval). "
378,2," Plaintiff again attempts to argue, using the same reasoning the court previously rejected, that there is no independently 
wrongful act requirement in this case. However, the court remains unpersuaded by plaintiff's argument and again holds that 
independent wrongfulness is a required element. "
380,3," In its Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, plaintiff makes a weak argument that § 2.13 also violates New York Law. (Id. at 28-
19.) However, plaintiff previously disavowed reliance on New York law in its Complaint (SAC ¶ 60) and thus cannot now attempt 
to rely on it. "

402,1," Plaintiffs refer to GolTV and Global Sports collectively as GolTV in the Amended Complaint (see Am. Compl. ¶ 111), and 
throughout their Opposition (see generally [*8]  Opp'n). The Court refers to GolTV and Global Sports as Plaintiffs unless it is 
necessary to refer to them separately."
402,2," Unless otherwise necessary, the Court refers to the Fox parties collectively as ""Fox"" or the ""Fox Defendants."" "
407,3," Monopsonization is an offense involving the control or monopoly of a market, which exists where an individual or organization 
is the only supplier of a particular good or commodity. See In re Beef Indus. Antitrust Litig., 600 F.2d 1148, 1154 n.3 (5th Cir. 
1979). "
408,4," All Defendants join the present Motion with the exception of Eugenio Figueredo, who has not appeared in the case. (See Mot. 
12 n.1)."
408,5," The Court uses the pagination generated by the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system, which appears as a header 
on all court filings. "
416,6," The Court does not consider the information contained in the Affidavit of Fatima Lorena González Toppi [ECF No. 204], filed in 
response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction and cited in Plaintiffs' Opposition Memorandum. (See Opp'n 
43). "
420,7," Arguments focused on whether the television rights were already under contract at the precise moment Plaintiffs brought each 
proposal to Conmebol and whether Conmebol would have revoked those contracts had it not been for the fraudulent acts of 
Defendants are factual disputes the Court will not address. See supra Part III.A.1."
420,8," The Court does not consider extraneous facts referenced in Plaintiffs' Opposition stating T&T reacted to Plaintiffs' 2012 offer to 
Conmebol by paying an additional $200,000 per year to two Conmebol directors and that Defendants' actions were aimed at 
preventing Plaintiffs from being awarded the Club Tournament television rights. (See Opp'n 85-86). "
421,9, Defendants join and adopt Burzaco's argument Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred. (See Mot. 84 n.27; see also Reply 52 n.30).
421,10," The offer to Conmebol to purchase television rights for 2011 to 2014 was presented through a series of meetings, the first of 
which occurred on March 3, 2010. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 111-12). The Amended Complaint is not specific as to when Conmebol 
rejected Plaintiffs' offer, stating only that ""Conmebol did not accept [Plaintiffs'] offer."" (Id. ¶ 114 (alteration added)). "
422,11," Napout additionally adopts and joins Defendants' arguments for dismissal of Counts One through Five, Eight, Nine and Eleven 
of the Amended Complaint. (See Mot. 84 n.28; see also Reply 55 n.32). "
427,1," Although H&M cites Mastrovincenzo in support of its arguments regarding expressive conduct and the Rogers test (discussed 
below), Mastrovincenzo applied neither the expressive conduct doctrine nor Rogers. See Mastrovincenzo v. Caly of New York. 
435 F.3d 78, 91 n.9 (2d Cir. 2006). "
428,2," H&M also argues that Plaintiffs' trademark infringement claims fail because H&M's use of ""classixx"" is merely ornamental and 
has no source-identifying purpose. The cases on which H&M relies establish establish only that, if H&M's use of ""classixx"" is "
429,," purely ornamental, H&M could not register ""classixx"" as a trademark. See In Re Astro-Gods Inc., 223 U.S.P.Q. 621 (T.T.A.B. 
Aug. 10, 19S4) (stating that an ornamental mark is protectable only if it also serves a source-indicating function, such as if ""it 
names the secondary source of the goods or if, at the time of its first use as ornamentation, it was already a recognized 
trademark of applicant for services or other goods.""). How H&M uses the mark has no bearing on whether Plaintiffs have a 
protectable interest in their own trademark. Nor does it establish as a matter of law that no likelihood of confusion could result 
from selling a sweater bearing only the word ""classixx."" The Court turns instead to the Sleek-craft factors to determine whether 
Plaintiffs adequately allege a likelihood of confusion. "
433,1," The information in this section is taken in large part from Plaintiffs' First Amended Verified Complaint (the ""Complaint""). "
434,2," The Court appreciates that whether and to what extent OTU was successful in securing financing for the sale of the Facility is a 
central issue in this litigation and disputed by the parties. The Court uses ""secured"" here because Plaintiffs allege they were able 
to secure adequate financing for the transaction and for purposes of a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept all well-pleaded 
allegations as true. Bonney v. Stephens Mem. Hosp., 2011 ME 46, ¶ 16, 17 A.3d 123."
434,3," The MFGR Defendants challenge whether they are bound by the terms of this letter. (Def's Reply Mot. Dismiss at 1 n. 1.) See 
note 2 supra. "
435,4," As the MFGR Defendants point out in their motion, specific performance is an equitable remedy, not a cause of action. (Mot. 
Dismiss at 3 n. 2.) The Court therefore treats Count II as a prayer for relief for MFGR's breach of the 4/28/16 Agreement plead in 
Count I. "
436,5," Plaintiffs attached a copy of the 4/28/16 Agreement to the Complaint as Exhibit D, and it is central to OTU's breach of contract 
claim. The Court thus may consider the document without converting the MFGR Defendants' motion to one for summary 
judgment. Moody v. State Liquor & Lottery Comm'n, 2004 ME 20, ¶ 10, 843 A.2d 43."
436,6," Because the Court rules that OTU has alleged sufficient facts to establish standing to enforce the signed 4/28/16 Agreement, 
the Court declines to consider whether the doctrine of part performance would otherwise operate to except the purported 
agreement to sell the Facility from the requirements of 33 M.R.S.A. § 51(4). The Court further expresses no opinion on whether 
the 4/28/16 Agreement is binding on any party, an argument that MFGR reserved but did not raise in its motion to dismiss. See 
note 3 of this Order supra. "
437,7," Plaintiffs attached a copy of the Advisory Agreement to the Complaint as Exhibit A, and it is central to OTU's breach of contract 
claim. The Court thus may consider the document without converting the MFGR Defendants' motion to one for summary 
judgment. Moody v. State Liquor & Lottery Comm'n, 2004 ME 20, ¶ 10, 843 A.2d 43. "
440,8," Plaintiffs are not entitled to the injunctive relief they seek under this count. That remedy is available only to the Attorney 
General. State v. MaineHealth, 2011 ME 115, ¶ 8, 31 A.3d 911. "
441,9," Notwithstanding the issues of standing and ripeness on which the Court decides to dismiss Count VII, Plaintiffs have not 
alleged how this transaction would result in an antitrust violation in any event. In essence, Plaintiffs allege that CVG's acquisition 
of the Facility would give CVG an advantage over its competitors by substantially lessening competition. That alone is 
insufficient to allege an antitrust violation. Tri-State Rubbish, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt., Inc., 875 F. Supp. 8, 13 (D. Me. 1994) 
(""[G]aining an advantage over your competitors is not, in itself, a violation of antitrust laws."")."
441,10," Because the Court rules that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim against any defendant for violating Maine's antitrust statute, 
the issue of whether Firestone or Deschenes could be individually liable for the alleged violation is moot. The OTH Defendants 
also argued grounds for dismissal that were unique to them. This argument is also moot, for the same reason. "
442,11, OTU's operating agreement was not attached to the Complaint and is not currently before the Court. 
449,1," The record reveals a discrepancy in whether 89 or 87 documents were to be produced. In an October 28, 2016, order, the 
Attorney General was directed to produce 89 documents."
449,2," Although not a party to the FOIA action brought by Steel against the Attorney General, the denial of St. Mary's motion to 
intervene is appealable to this Court, which enabled St. Mary's to file ""protective notices of appeal."" See Stern v. Chemtall Inc., 
217 W.Va. 329, 617 S.E.2d 876 (2005) (granting appeal from denial of motion to intervene); Louis J. Palmer, Jr., and The Hon. 
Robin Jean Davis, Litigation Handbook on West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 24, § 24[2][e] (5th ed. 2017) (""An order 
denying intervention is final and immediately appealable.""). See also Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: 
Civil 3d, § 1923 (2007) (Denial of intervention should be regarded as an appealable final order.). Steel's motion to dismiss St. 
Mary's appeals was denied by this Court in April 2017. "
450,3," W.Va. Code, 47-18-22 [1978], of the Antitrust Act, states: In the administration of this article, the attorney general may accept an assurance of voluntary compliance with respect to 
any method, act or practice deemed to be a violation of this article from any person who has engaged or was about to 
engage in such method, act or practice. Such assurance may include a stipulation for voluntary payment [***7]  by the 
alleged violator of damages sustained by any person or public body. Any such assurance shall be in writing and be filed 
with the circuit court in which the alleged violator resides, has his principal place of business, or is doing business. Such 
assurance of voluntary compliance shall not be considered an admission of violation for any purpose. Matters thus closed 
may at any time be reopened by the attorney general for further proceedings in the public interest. (emphasis added) "
451,4," Steel described the documents the Attorney General considered subject to disclosure as largely consisting of previously 
available public records, news articles, and e-mails exchanging press releases and news stories."
451,5," The action was styled Steel of West Virginia, Inc., Plaintiff v. Patrick Morrisey, Attorney General, State of West Virginia, Acting 
in his Official Capacity, Defendant, Civil Action No. 15-C-2214 (Kan. Co. 2015)."
451,6," A Vaughn Index was described in Farley v. Worley, 215 W.Va. 412, 599 S.E.2d 835 (2004), as follows: HN2[
] When a public body asserts that certain documents or portions of documents in its possession are exempt from disclosure under any of the exemptions contained in W.Va. Code, 29B-1-4 (2002 Repl.Vol.) (2003 Supp.), the public body 
must produce a Vaughn index named for Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820, 157 U.S. App. D.C. 340 (D.C. Cir. 1973), cert. 
denied, 415 U.S. 977, 94 S. Ct. 1564, 39 L. Ed. 2d 873 (1974). The Vaughn index must provide a relatively detailed 
justification as to why each document is exempt, specifically identifying the reason(s) why an exemption under W.Va. Code, 
29B-1-4 is relevant and correlating the claimed exemption with the particular part of the withheld document to which the 
claimed exemption applies. The Vaughn index need not be so detailed that it compromises the privilege claimed. The public "
452,," body must also submit an affidavit, indicating why disclosure of the documents would be harmful and why such documents 
should be exempt. Syllabus point 6, in part. Accord syllabus point 8, Hurlbert v. Matkovich, 233 W.Va. 583, 760 S.E.2d 152 (2014)."
452,7," See W.Va. Code, 16-2D-1 [2016], et seq. (establishing a certificate of need process in relation to the offering or development of 
health services). The proceeding concerning the proposed merger was styled In re: Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., CON File # 
14-2-10375-A."
452,8," Steel filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this Court to compel the Health Care Authority to issue a subpoena duces tecum 
to St. Mary's for documents concerning the bidding process which resulted in the proposed merger. The Authority maintained 
that the documents were irrelevant to the certificate of need proceeding. This Court refused Steel's petition for a writ of 
mandamus in December 2015. See State ex rel. Steel of West Virginia, Inc., v. West Virginia Health Care Authority and Cabell 
Huntington Hospital, Inc., Supreme Court No. 15-1163 (2015). The documents concerning the bidding process are among the 
documents in question in Steel's FOIA action now before us."
452,9," See [***12]  Steel of West Virginia, Inc., v. West Virginia Health Care Authority and Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., Supreme 
Court No. 17-0406, 2017 W.V. Cir. LEXIS 5 . "
453,10," The comparable federal statute to the nondisclosure provisions of W.Va. Code, 47-18-7(d) [1978], is subsection (h) of 15 
U.S.C. § 18a. [2000] concerning ""premerger notification."" Subsection (h) states in part: "
454,," Any information or documentary material filed with the Assistant Attorney General or the Federal Trade Commission 
pursuant to this section shall be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of Title 5 [regarding public information], and no 
such information or documentary material may be made public, except as may be relevant to any administrative or judicial 
action or proceeding. With regard to the disclosure of information to the public, this Court has recognized ""the close relationship between the federal 
and West Virginia FOIA."" Farley v. Worley, 215 W.Va. at 420, 599 S.E.2d at 843."
454,11," In syllabus point 5 of Hechler v. Casey, 175 W.Va. 434, 333 S.E.2d 799 (1985), we recognized that ""[a]n agreement as to 
confidentiality between the public body and the supplier of the information may not override the Freedom of Information Act, 
W.Va. Code, 29B-1-1 et seq."" However, our holding in these consolidated appeals is not based on the November 25, 2014, 
confidentiality agreement. Rather, our holding is based on the Attorney General's statutory investigative exemption incorporated 
in the Freedom of Information Act through W.Va. Code, 29B-1-4(a)(5)."
454,12," See Farley v. Worley, 215 W.Va. at 419-25, 599 S.E.2d at 842-48 (2004) (decided under the 1977 version of the statute but 
making clear that a public body cannot simply refuse a FOIA request without specific justification.). "
455,13," To be clear, HN9[
] the Antitrust Act's investigative exemption, incorporated in the Freedom of Information Act through W.Va. Code, 29B-1-4(a)(5) [2015], is to be distinguished from the investigation-related FOIA exemption set forth in W.Va. Code, 29B-1-
4(a)(4) [2015], which exempts: ""Records of law-enforcement agencies that deal with the detection and investigation of crime and 
the internal records and notations of such law-enforcement agencies which are maintained for internal use in matters relating to 
law enforcement."" See, e.g., Ogden Newspapers, Inc. v. City of Williamstown, 192 W.Va. 648, 453 S.E.2d 631 (1994) 
(discussing subsection (4) in the context of a police incident report). Subsection (4) is not relevant to the current matter. "
456,14," As a result of this holding, this Court need not address the additional exemption raised by the Attorney General under W.Va. 
Code, 29B-1-4(a)(8) [2015], of the Freedom of Information Act which provides for the nondisclosure of ""internal memoranda or 
letters received or prepared by any public body."" We note, however, that the Attorney General's conclusion that the merger was 
in the best interests of the State of West Virginia was not effectively made until the amended Assurance of Voluntary 
Compliance was filed on November 4, 2015, after the Attorney General received the documents in question."
456,15," The Attorney General's transgression was providing the FTC with a portion of the sealed Vaughn Index without first requesting 
authorization or leave from the circuit court in the form of a motion or otherwise. See, e.g., W.Va. R. Civ. P. 26(c) (providing that 
a deposition sealed under a protective order ""be opened only by order of the court""). The affidavit of the Senior Deputy Attorney 
General states that the providing of the portion of the Index was in compliance with W.Va. Code, 47-18-14 [1978], which 
authorizes cooperation between the Attorney General and the federal government in the enforcement of antitrust laws. 
According to the affidavit, there was no intent to violate the order placing the Vaughn Index under seal. However, the Senior 
Deputy Attorney General also set forth an apology in the affidavit, in the event the circuit court were to take a different view of 
the disclosure. "
457,16," Later amendments to W.Va. Code, 16-29B-26 [2016] and W.Va. Code, 16-29B-28 [2016], are not applicable herein. "
460,1," Dr. Seaman's expert defines ""faculty"" to include employees who have an academic appointment at the Duke or UNC Schools 
of Medicine. Doc. 94 at ¶ 14. There was some question about whether physicians without an academic appointment should be 
included in the faculty category. The plaintiff is not sure whether the no-hire agreement was applied to physicians without an 
academic appointment, Doc. 187 at 83-84, and these physicians were included in Dr. Seaman's non-faculty analysis. See id. at 
6-7. For these reasons, the Court considers physicians that do not have an academic appointment at the Duke or UNC Schools 
of Medicine to be non-faculty."
460,2," In her complaint, Dr. Seaman alleges that the no-hire agreement extended to ""skilled medical labor, including medical facility 
faculty,"" see Doc. 109 at ¶ 1; however, in her class certification briefing and supporting expert reports she only alleges that the 
no-hire agreement restricted recruitment of faculty. See, e.g., Doc. 93 at 12-20. At the hearing, Dr. Seaman's counsel confirmed 
it had no direct evidence of an agreement as to non-faculty and admitted the only circumstantial evidence was the evidence 
about the agreement as to faculty. Doc. 187 at 23-24. The Court will evaluate the facts for purposes of class certification under 
the more limited allegations provided in Dr. Seaman's class certification briefing. "
461,3," The Court has approved a class settlement between Dr. Seaman, class plaintiffs, and the following defendants: Dr. William 
Roper, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and the University of 
North Carolina Health Care System. Doc. 185. Final judgment has been entered on claims between these parties as well. Doc. 
186. The settlement class has a different class definition from the proposed class at issue in the pending motion. See Doc. 81 at 
1-2; Doc. 108 at 2-3 (defining settlement class)."
461,4," The Court omits internal citations and quotation marks from all cited cases in this opinion, unless otherwise noted. See United 
States v. Marshall, 872 F.3d 213, 217 n. 6 (4th Cir. 2017). "
462,5," The findings stated in this Order apply only to the motion for class certification. See Gariety, 368 F.3d at 366 (noting that if the 
jury or factfinder's ""finding on any fact differs from a finding made in connection with class action certification, the ultimate 
factfinder's finding on the merits will govern the judgment."")."
462,6," Of course, if no reasonable juror could believe the class-wide evidence, Dr. Seaman would lack common proof. Tyson Foods, 
136 S. Ct at 1049 (comparing class certification standards to standards for summary judgment and directed verdict). That does 
not appear to be the case on the current record, and any arguments that Dr. Seaman's evidence fails to prove some elements of 
her claim can be addressed at summary judgment or at trial. Id. at 1047. "
463,7," The UNC School of Medicine is located approximately 12 and 30 miles from the Duke University Hospital and Duke Raleigh 
Hospital, respectively. Doc. 94 at ¶ 16. According to the plaintiff's expert, these facilities are located within the same ""commuting 
zone."" Id. at ¶ 17. "
466,8," The Court notes that this appears to be a bald allegation at this stage. The documentary evidence cited in support, Doc. 93 at 
24 n. 58, does not provide any indication or confirmation that faculty seek compensation increases for non-faculty during lateral 
moves. "
467,9," In their briefing, neither Dr. Seaman nor Duke addressed how class-wide damages, if established, would be allocated to 
individual class members. The Court has considered this issue and does not anticipate that allocation to individual faculty 
members would create individual issues that predominate over other faculty damages issues, as it appears. That is because Dr. 
Seaman's theories of impact and her class-wide damages calculations would support a formulaic class-wide approach to 
distribution of the aggregate class-wide damages using the common employment data. See In re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust 
Litig., No. RDB-10-0318, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 62394, 2013 WL 1855980, at *16 (D. Md. May 1, 2013) (noting that at class 
certification ""th[e] Court ... recognized [class-wide] options for determining individual damages"" following an aggregate damages 
award); Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 12:2 (5th ed., Dec. 2017 Update)."
467,10," For example, Duke asserts that individualized proof will be required to show that the agreement actually restrained the 
movement of each particular faculty member and that each faculty member was embedded in the area such that the agreement 
affected them. Doc. 127 at 20-21, 26-27; see also Doc. 187 at 77-78. The fact that there may be some evidence about individual 
situations does not defeat predominance because the plaintiff's theory does not require her to prove that the movement of every 
faculty member was restrained or that every faculty member was embedded in the area. Evidence that this was or was not the 
case for individuals may well be relevant to support or rebut the assumptions underlying the plaintiff's theories. But this is in 
effect common evidence, and individual questions will not require resolution. "
468,11," Non-faculty class members may pursue a separate class action and obtain the corresponding economies of time, effort, and 
expense, and uniformity of decision. See Amchem, 521 U.S. at 615."
468,12," Since the Court has concluded that a non-faculty class is not manageable, the Court need not address the Rule 23(a) 
requirements as to it. "
469,13," For example, the agreement may have suppressed an individual's compensation under Dr. Seaman's theories of class-wide 
liability, but the agreement also may have impacted and damaged an individual who missed out on increased compensation 
associated with a lateral move or lateral move offer. The class-wide and individual theories of impact and damages are not 
mutually exclusive, but only the class-wide theories are being asserted in this case. "
480,1," In light of this ruling, the Court need not consider the sufficiency of Plaintiff's definition of the relevant product or geographic 
markets. "

494,1," CMI came into existence following the merger of Masonite and Premdor in 2002. After the Department of Justice (""DOJ"") filed 
suit to block the merger, the parties entered into a consent decree allowing the merger on the condition that Masonite divest its 
Towanda plant, which CMI subsequently purchased."
494,2," JELD-WEN argues that the Court should not consider this fact and others referenced in this section because Steves presented 
them in narrative format, in violation of Local Rule 56(B). See Integrated Direct Mktg., LLC v. May, 129 F. Supp. 3d 336, 344-46 
(E.D. Va. 2015) (refusing to consider new facts presented in narrative format in oppositions to motions for summary judgment 
because oppositions did not specifically state which undisputed material facts in motions were disputed). But Steves' opposition, 
besides stating narrative facts, specifically disputes or agrees to all of JELD-WEN's purportedly undisputed material facts. 
Moreover, JELD-WEN included an appendix to its reply disputing the narrative facts in Steves' opposition. Therefore, unlike in 
Integrated Direct Marketing, it is fairly easy to discern which facts are disputed and which are not. "
497,3," JELD-WEN disputes these facts solely on the basis that they are inadmissible at trial because they reflect confidential 
settlement communications. See Fed. R. Evid. 408(a)(2). But even if this evidence concerns a ""disputed claim"" within the scope 
of Rule 408, Steves may offer this evidence at trial for purposes other than ""prov[ing] or disprov[ing] the validity or amount"" of 
that claim, or impeaching one of JELD-WEN's witnesses. Id. 408(a). The Court already recognized as much in denying JELD-
WEN's related motion in limine. ECF No. 779. Thus, it is not true that this evidence ""cannot be presented in a form that would be 
admissible in evidence,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) (2), so the Court can consider those facts here."
497,4," On October 2, 2017, the Court dismissed Count Six as moot after Steves notified the Court that it would not persist with that 
claim. ECF No. 409. All other claims remain here. "
500,5," As Steves notes, both Robinson and GPU discussed impact at the class certification stage, so evidence of a higher price that 
every class member would have had to pay would be the only way to satisfy the commonality and predominance requirements 
under Rule 23. See Robinson, 387 F.3d at 422; GPU, 253 F.R.D. at 507. Therefore, these cases do not necessarily indicate that 
an individual plaintiff must demonstrate a precise competitive benchmark to show impact, as causation could be shown through 
other individualized proof of harm. "
501,6," This evidence can therefore show antitrust impact even without considering the cost reductions allowed by JELD-WEN's 
acquisition of CMI's Towanda plant because JELD-WEN still would have owned the legacy plants in the absence of the merger."
501,7," Steves seeks these damages only under Count One because it concedes that JELD-WEN's September 2014 notice of 
termination of the Supply Agreement did not breach the contract."
501,8," JELD-WEN does not assert that Steves lacks standing to seek future lost profits damages. However, the elements of Article III 
standing provide helpful context for JELD-WEN's ripeness argument; indeed, JELD-WEN referenced those elements when 
introducing the ripeness challenge in its supplemental brief. "
503,9," To preserve the viability of this potential claim, JELD-WEN reiterates its earlier representation to the Court that—should Steves 
actually go out of business in 2021—JELD-WEN will not seek dismissal of a Section 4 damages claim on the basis that the claim 
accrued earlier and is barred by the statute of limitations. Nor, says JELD-WEN, will it assert any time-related defense."
503,10," JELD-WEN's counsel claimed at the Final Pretrial Conference that its notice of termination could not be considered an 
antitrust injury because the parties had so stipulated. However, JELD-WEN provided no evidence of that stipulation, and Steves' 
counsel indicated that the stipulation likely reflected that JELD-WEN's notice could not give rise to contractual liability—which 
Steves has agreed is not the case."
503,11," It may well be true that Steves could suffer some other future antitrust injury from the CMI Acquisition that the parties have not 
identified, and that the act causing that injury could be of the type that implicates the continuing violations doctrine. However, the 
Court cannot resolve that hypothetical issue here."
503,12," The only cases that JELD-WEN cites as purportedly establishing this principle involved challenges to rules or standards that 
were either completed and being enforced, and thus ripe for review, or were in ""early stages of development,"" and thereby 
unripe. See Volvo N. Am. Corp. v. Men's Int'l Prof'l Tennis Council, 857 F.2d 55, 64-65 (2d Cir. 1988); Plant Oil Powered Diesel 
Fuel Sys., Inc. v. ExxonMobil Corp., 801 F. Supp. 2d 1163, 1183-84 (D.N.M. 2011). The harms that Steves suffered because of 
the CMI Acquisition are not as easily separable in a temporal or causal sense. As a result, it is uncertain whether the rationale of 
those cases would hold for Steves' injuries. "
505,13," Steves argues that its filing suit within the Clayton Act's four-year statute of limitations for damages actions is relevant to this 
factor. It cites a recent Supreme Court case, Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1962, 188 L. Ed. 2d 979 (2014), 
as holding that laches cannot be applied when a plaintiff has filed suit within the limitations period imposed by a statute. Id. at 
1977. Even if that holding applies to Clayton Act claims, the four-year statute of limitations applies to Section 4 damages claims, 
not Section 16 divestiture claims. See 15 U.S.C. § 15(b)."
505,14," Although JELD-WEN may be right that the consummation of the merger is sufficient prejudice to implicate laches, the cost of 
any divestiture order is still relevant to the Court's balancing of the equities. See Ginsburg, 623 F.3d at 1235-36. "
516,1," Motorola did not argue that SLC's alleged breach of its FRAND obligations constituted patent misuse per se. Compare (Dkt. 
No. 73 at 6), with (Dkt. No. 73 at 16). Therefore, the Court does not apply the per se standard here. "
517,2," To the extent Motorola's arguments as to the alleged FRAND violations also depend on a showing of market power in a clearly 
defined market, the Court declines to address this question because Motorola failed to establish that SLC's conduct harmed 
competition. [FF54]. "
518,3," Although U.S. Philips and Princo did not involve identical facts, the act of seeking worldwide licenses is sufficiently analogous 
to seeking a package license like the one at issue in U.S. Philips. 424 F.3d at 1182 (""Potential licensees who sought to license 
patents to the technology for manufacturing CD-Rs or CD-RWs were not allowed to license those patents individually . . . .""). "
519,4," Because SLC's conduct is not patent misuse per se or under the rule of reason, the Court finds it unnecessary to address 
whether Motorola appropriately defined a relevant market or established that SLC has market power in such a market. "
533,1," Prior to filing, GM and Bosch requested leave to submit briefs of 80 (and 60, respectively) pages in support of their motions to 
dismiss. ECF Nos. 35, 39. In response, the Court directed the Defendants to submit an outline of their anticipated briefs and 
suggested that judicial efficiency might be served by waiting to advance state-specific challenges to Plaintiffs' claims in a motion 
filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c). ECF No. 36. Defendants were amenable to the latter suggestion and, 
accordingly, the Court granted the parties leave to submit briefs of 50 pages (and reply briefs of 15 pages). ECF No. 42."
533,2," Those states are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas."
533,3," This purported achievement would be particularly noteworthy because diesel engines ""have an inherent trade-off between 
power, fuel efficiency, and emissions: the greater the power and fuel efficiency, the dirtier and more harmful the emissions."" Id. 
at 46."
533,4," In the consolidated amended complaint, Plaintiffs summarize, in detail, the testing they conducted on a 2013 Silverado 2500. 
Id. at 70-92. "
534,5," Plaintiffs analogize these alleged devices to those which Volkswagen has recently pleaded guilty to including in their diesel 
vehicles and which other vehicle manufacturers have been accused of utilizing. See id. at 2."
534,6," The SCR converts oxides of nitrogen (a harmful pollutant produced by diesel engines) into nitrogen gas and water ""by means 
of a reduction reaction."" Id. at 50. The DPF traps and stores particulate matter (soot). Id. at 51. The DPF is ""cleaned through a 
process known as regeneration."" Id. ""Passive regeneration"" is a ""continuously occurring process"" which occurs whenever ""the 
exhaust gas temperature is high enough to burn the particulate matter trapped by the filter."" Id. ""Active regeneration occurs only 
when the engine senses that the DPF needs to be cleaned as the DPF is approaching maximum capacity and generating too 
much exhaust backpressure."" Id. In that scenario, ""fuel is injected into the exhaust stream via the HCI to increase the exhaust 
gas temperature so that the particulate matter can be burned off at carbon's non-catalytic oxidation temperature."" Id. Because 
fuel is being used for a purpose other than propulsion, ""[a]ctive regeneration dramatically reduces fuel economy."" Id. "
538,7," This decision is puzzling because Bosch appears to admit in their briefing that Plaintiffs' ""overpayment"" theory is sufficient to 
establish standing to sue GM. Bosch focuses its argument on the assertion that any such overpayment is not attributable to 
Bosch's actions. See Bosch. Mot. Dismiss at 12, ECF No. 44 (""But Plaintiffs do not have standing to sue Bosch LLC - rather than 
GM - unless their injury ""fairly can be traced"" to the actions of Bosch LLC. . . . Any overpayment based on artificially inflated 
market price cannot fairly be traced to the actions of Bosch LLC, which is not alleged to have advertised directly to consumers or 
have had any control over the price of the Subject Vehicles.""). Nevertheless, because the Court has an independent obligation 
to confirm its own jurisdiction, Plaintiffs' standing to sue GM will be briefly addressed. "
540,8," Bosch also argues that Plaintiffs' overpayment theory should be interpreted as essentially a ""benefit-of-the-bargain"" argument 
and suggests that such a theory is insufficient to establish standing because Bosch was not a party to any vehicle-purchase 
contracts with consumers. But a consumer can establish a concrete injury by alleging that he or she ""received a product that 
failed to work for its intended purpose or was worth objectively less than what one could reasonably expect,"" regardless of 
whether the purchase was made pursuant to a contract. Koronthaly v. L'Oreal USA, Inc., 374 F. App'x 257, 259 (3d Cir. 2010). "
541,9, Plaintiffs have expressly disclaimed any claims premised on affirmative misrepresentation (discussed below). 
544,10," In further support of the contention that GM has publically disclosed the existence of AECDs which are present in the subject 
vehicles, GM points to a publically available document which purports to show that GM provided ""AECD Descriptions"" to the 
EPA. See GM Reply Br. at 5 & Ex. 5, ECF No. 57. Information from outside the pleadings cannot be considered at the pleading 
stage, with several limited exceptions. Tackett v. M & G Polymers, USA, L.L.C., 561 F.3d 478, 487 (6th Cir. 2009). To the extent 
the identified document is a public record, courts may typically only take judicial notice of such records to recognize ""the fact of 
the documents' existence, and not for the truth of the matters asserted therein."" Passa v. City of Columbus, 123 F. App'x 694, 
697 (6th Cir. 2005). And even if this exhibit was considered now, it would not change the Court's analysis. The document 
suggests that AECD descriptions were provided to the EPA, but does not include those descriptions. In other words, the 
document does not appear to provide any evidence that the AECDs were themselves publically disclosed. Plaintiffs' claims are 
focused on allegedly inadequate disclosures to the public; confidential disclosures to the EPA are irrelevant. The relevance of the document purportedly submitted to the EPA is the primary subject of the parties' motions for leave to file 
surreplies. See ECF No. 58, 60. Because the document cannot be considered for the purpose it was submitted and would not 
change the Court's analysis even if reviewed, those motions will be denied as moot. "
545,11," There are a number of potential theories which Plaintiffs could have conceivably advanced and which would have been 
squarely preempted. For example, if Plaintiffs were seeking damages based solely on Defendants' alleged violations of the CAA, 
their suit would be preempted. Likewise, if Plaintiffs' claims were ""predicated on deceit against the EPA during new-vehicle 
certification,"" their claims would be preempted. In re Volkswagen ""Clean Diesel"" Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prod. Liab. Litig., 264 
F. Supp. 3d 1040, 1054 (N.D. Cal. 2017)."
545,12," The consolidated amended complaint also discusses the EPA's definition of a defeat device, but that definition is alleged in 
connection with allegations regarding the EPA's conclusion that Volkswagen's diesel vehicles violated the CAA. Id. at 6. In their 
briefing, Defendants repeatedly contend that allegations regarding the conduct of other diesel vehicle manufacturers is 
irrelevant, and so Defendants cannot reasonably point to these allegations when arguing that Plaintiffs' claims should be 
preempted."
545,13," And even this allegation is focused on consumer expectations about compliance, not the compliance itself. See In re 
Volkswagen ""Clean Diesel"" Litigation, 94 Va. Cir. 189, 2016 WL 5347198 at *6 (Va.Cir.Ct. 2016) (""[A]lthough emissions 
compliance or lack thereof may be further proof of deceit, it is the deceit about compliance, rather than the need to enforce 
compliance, that is the gravamen of Plaintiffs' claims.""). Admittedly, proving this allegation appears to require proof that EPA "
546,," regulations have been violated. To the extent that it is true, a claim premised on solely that allegation would likely be preempted. 
But Plaintiffs advance numerous other theories of consumer harm which are not preempted."
546,14," Notwithstanding this fact, Plaintiffs (and the Court) frequently use the term ""defeat device"" as a short hand for the manner in 
which EDC17 allegedly uses several features to bypass or derate emissions reduction technologies in certain circumstances. 
That term has entered the common parlance, and so the fact that the EPA has also provided a legal definition for the term 
""defeat device"" does not mean that every use of the term ""defeat device"" necessarily involves a reference to that regulatory 
definition."
546,15," In other words, proof that Defendants concealed material information from the EPA will almost certainly provide the factual 
predicate to sustain Plaintiffs' state law claims, but the inverse is not necessarily true. "
548,16," GM's argument regarding implied preemption might have merit if ""Plaintiffs' claims could be construed as alleging that AEDC 
disclosures to the government should have been made public,"" but as explained above Plaintiffs' claims are premised on 
Defendants' nondisclosures to consumers, not the EPA. GM. Mot. Dismiss at 27. "
549,17," Bosch also argues that the state law claims brought against it should be dismissed because they are preempted. In so 
arguing, Bosch also attempts to argue that all of Plaintiffs' claims against them are expressly premised on Bosch's alleged efforts 
to evade United States emission requirements. But Plaintiffs are not advancing state law claims of that nature. To the extent 
Bosch argues that Plaintiffs have not stated any state law claims against them because they have not plausibly pleaded a 
connection between Bosch's conduct and the fraudulent concealment, that argument is best left for the (presumptive) motions by 
Defendants for judgment on the pleadings. "
551,18," The Clayton Act included a civil-action provision which permitted private parties to sue for injuries arising out of antitrust law 
violations. The Supreme Court has ""repeatedly observed . . . that Congress modeled § 1964(c) on the civil-action provision of 
the federal antitrust law."" Holmes v. Sec. Inv'r Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 267, 112 S. Ct. 1311, 117 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1992). "
554,19," Thus, even though the alleged RICO injury is sufficient to create standing, the nature of the alleged injury might prevent class 
certification. "
556,20," And Chief Justice Robert's opinion (joined by three justices) took care to reject the argument advanced by three dissenting 
justices that ""RICO's proximate cause requirement [should] turn on foreseeability, rather than on the existence of a sufficiently 
'direct relationship' between the fraud and the harm."" Id. at 12."
556,21," This is not the say, however, that Plaintiffs may advance a § 1962(c) RICO claim against Bosch without identifying specific 
predicate acts committed by Bosch. See Kerrigan v. ViSalus, Inc., 112 F. Supp. 3d 580, 605 (E.D. Mich. 2015) (collecting cases 
and distinguishing between § 1962(d) conspiracy claims and § 1962(c) substantive claims). That subtly different analysis will be 
conducted below, while determining whether Plaintiffs have alleged a prima facie RICO claim. As explained in that section, 
Plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Bosch committed predicate acts of mail and wire fraud even though Plaintiffs have not 
specifically alleged that Bosch personally used the mail or wire to further the fraudulent scheme. "
557,22," Bosch's arguments conflate the distinction between (1) the requirement that Plaintiffs allege a causal link between their injury 
and the predicate acts and (2) the elements of mail and wire fraud. As discussed below, a party can be guilty of mail fraud even 
if they did not personally use the mail. The fact that GM, not Bosch, is the party who used the mail and wire to make 
representations to regulators and consumers is thus not determinative. See United States v. Stapleton, 293 F.3d 1111, 1117 "
558,," (9th Cir. 2002) (""Because an essential element of these offenses is a fraudulent scheme, mail and wire fraud are treated like 
conspiracy in several respects."") (internal citations omitted). "
559,23," The Defendants do not attempt to argue that the relationship which Plaintiffs allege existed between them was too short to 
give rise to a RICO association-in-fact. And Defendants decline to make that argument for good reason: Plaintiffs allege that 
Defendants' enterprise spanned years."
559,24," Plaintiffs allege that Bosch and GM conspired together. The additional allegation that Bosch also conspired in similar manner 
with Volkswagen is largely irrelevant. It is, at the very least, consistent with Plaintiffs' theory. Bosch's apparent belief that the 
alleged existence of a similar but separate agreement affirmatively establishes that no such agreement existed between Bosch 
and GM is unexplained. The Plaintiffs' well-pleaded allegations must be construed in their favor and accepted as true at this 
stage. "
561,25," The nature of the common purpose distinguishes this case from others, like Shaw v. Nissan N. Am., Inc., where the alleged 
purpose was to continue selling vehicles that (might have) contained defects. 220 F. Supp. 3d 1046, 1054 (C.D. Cal. 2016). The 
common purpose here was to create, market, and sell a component and consequently an engine which was inherently 
deceptive."
561,26," The fact that two distinct companies (Bosch and GM) associated together for a common purpose is important. That fact 
distinguishes the present case from several which Defendants cite. See Ignition Switch Litig., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92499, 
2016 WL 3920353, at *12 (no enterprise because the only alleged members were GM and its agents); In re Toyota Motor Corp. 
Unintended Acceleration Mktg., Sales Practices, & Prod. Liab. Litig., 826 F. Supp. 2d 1180, 1185 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (no RICO 
enterprise because all defendants were subsidiaries of Toyota). It is axiomatic that a company cannot form a RICO enterprise 
with itself. But, of course, several companies can easily form a RICO enterprise. See United States v. Huber, 603 F.2d 387, 394 
(2d Cir. 1979). See also In re ClassicStar Mare Lease Litig., 727 F.3d at 493. "
562,27," The Sixth Circuit has ""interpreted the mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes as having essentially the same elements, except for 
the use of the mails versus the wires."" Kennedy, 714 F.3d at 958. "
564,28," As the Kerrigan Court explained, when the RICO claim is premised on a concealment theory of fraud, the plaintiffs do not need 
to meet the Rule 9(b) heightened pleading standard when identifying the mailings. Rather, Plaintiffs need only ""provide a 
detailed description of the fraudulent scheme and a clear explanation of each Defendant's alleged role in it."" 112 F. Supp. 3d at 
607. Plaintiffs have done so here. "
566,29," Bosch also argues that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the predicate act requirement by alleging that Bosch ""aided and abetted"" GM in 
violating the mail and wire fraud statutes. As explained above, this argument conflates several legal requirements. Plaintiffs must 
allege that Bosch engaged in two predicate acts under the RICO statute. The alleged predicate acts, mail and wire fraud, can be 
committed without actually using the mail or wire. A charge of mail or wire fraud, then, bears a certain resemblance to 
conspiracy law. As explained above, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Bosch committed predicate acts of mail and wire fraud. 
Thus, Plaintiffs' RICO theory does not rely upon ""aiding or abetting"" liability. "

576,4," We focus on the status quo rather than the ""mandatory"" and ""prohibitory"" terminology because ""in borderline cases injunctive 
provisions containing essentially the same command can be phrased either in mandatory or prohibitory terms."" Int'l Union,

appear to be prohibitory . . . [but] 'Continue working,' would be mandatory.""); Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1025 (2d 
Cir. 1985), overruled on other grounds by O'Lone v. Estate of Shabaze, 482 U.S. 342, 107 S. Ct. 2400, 96 L. Ed. 2d 282 (1987) 
(""In many instances, this distinction is more semantic[] than substantive."")."
576,5," The ""status quo"" in preliminary-injunction parlance is really a ""status quo ante."" See Holt v. Cont'l Grp., Inc., 708 F.2d 87, 90 
(2d Cir. 1983) (referring to reinstatement of benefits as ""restoration of the status quo ante""); accord O Centro Espirita 
Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 973, 1013 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (per curiam) (""requir[ing] a party who 
has recently disturbed the status quo to reverse its actions . . . restores, rather than disturbs, the status quo ante, and is thus not 
an exception"" to the ordinary standard for preliminary injunctions). This special ""ante"" formulation of the status quo in the realm 
of equities shuts out defendants seeking shelter under a current ""status quo"" precipitated by their wrongdoing. "
577,6," Some of our sister circuits have explicitly incorporated this principle into their formulations of the status quo. See, e.g., SCFC 
ILC, Inc. v. Visa USA, Inc., 936 F.2d 1096, 1100 (10th Cir. 1991), overruled on other grounds by O Centro Espirita, 389 F.3d at 
975 (""The status quo . . . is defined by the reality of the existing status and relationships between the parties."") (emphasis 
omitted); Stemple v. Bd. of Ed. of Prince George's Cty., 623 F.2d 893, 898 (4th Cir. 1980) (""[C]ourts . . . will frame any equitable 
relief to preserve the last uncontested status between the parties.""); Wash. Capitols Basketball Club, Inc. v. Barry, 419 F.2d 472, 
475 (9th Cir. 1969) (""maintain[ing] the status quo between the litigants"") (citing Hamilton Watch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., 206 
F.2d 738 (2d Cir. 1953))."
577,7," The case might be different if USSF designated NASL a Division II league and revoked that designation mid-season. There, the 
status quo between the parties arguably would be NASL's Division II designation for that season, in which case we would 
evaluate NASL's challenge to USSF's revocation under the ordinary standard for a preliminary injunction."
577,8," NASL contends that, as an alternative to a showing of a clear or substantial likelihood of success, it can satisfy the higher 
standard by showing that failure to issue the injunction would result in extreme or very serious damage. It relies on our earlier 
statement ""that a mandatory injunction should issue 'only upon a clear showing that the moving party is entitled to the relief 
requested, or where extreme or very serious damage will result from a denial of preliminary relief.'"" Tom Doherty, 60 F.3d at 34 
(quoting Abdul Wali, 754 F.2d at 1025). Irreparable harm, however, is ""indistinguishable"" from extreme damage. Jacobson & 
Co., Inc. v. Armstrong Cork Co., 548 F.2d 438, 441 n.3 (2d Cir. 1977). Therefore, as we have previously noted, the extreme-
damage language in our jurisprudence remains ""merely a reaffirmation of the traditional reluctance to issue mandatory 
injunctions . . . ."" Id."
577,9," The District Court found that NASL had established irreparable harm and that the injunction would not harm the public interest. 
NASL, No. 17-CV-05495, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 183202, 2017 WL 5125771, at *8-9, *21. USSF does not focus on a failure by 
NASL in either area. Thus, we start and finish with the lower court's determination that NASL had not demonstrated its clear 
likelihood of success on the merits."
577,10," Because ""[t]he question whether an arrangement is a contract, combination, or conspiracy is different from and antecedent to 
the question whether it unreasonably restrains trade,"" Am. Needle, 560 U.S. at 186, we first examine, pursuant to NASL's 
allegations, whether USSF, MLS, USL, and SUM conspired within the meaning of § 1 of the Sherman Act. Although we 
ultimately assume the existence of a conspiracy, we address this antecedent question to clarify the framework the lower court 
must use on remand. "
579,11," How NASL is challenging the Standards is unclear. See A-135 (the District Court, with NASL's later agreement, summarized 
NASL's position as: ""You're saying standards are okay, Division I, Division II is okay; the manner in which [USSF] set[s] the 
requirements for each is wrong""); see also A-137 (NASL stating ""I'm challenging the requirements here . . . that a standard 
setting body should set [the minimum-team requirement] . . . [challenging] [t]hat particular rule""). There is room for disagreement 
as to whether NASL's reference to the Standards, as ""effectuat[ing] the USSF's anticompetitive conspiracy,"" wages war on the 
Standards or just fires shots at their role in the larger alleged conspiracy. Compl. ¶ 122. See Summit Health, Ltd. v. Pinhas, 500 
U.S. 322, 339-40, 111 S. Ct. 1842, 114 L. Ed. 2d 366 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (describing an alleged agreement to boycott 
as ""not the totality of the conspiracy, but merely the means used to enforce it""). Compare Wilk v. Am. Med. Ass'n, 895 F.2d 352, 
374 n.9 (7th Cir. 1990) (saying plaintiffs did not directly challenge standards alleged to ""perpetuate[] the boycott""), with 
Robertson v. Sea Pines Real Estate Cos., Inc., 679 F.3d 278, 283, 288, 289 (4th Cir. 2012) (finding direct evidence of 
conspiracy where defendants used joint venture as an ""instrumentality"" and ""conduit,"" saying that ""board members conspired in 
the form of [their] rules, the very passage of which establishes that the defendants convened and came to an agreement""). "
580,12," The parties did not, and do not, dispute the rule of reason's applicability."

beyond NASL's own exclusion from Division II)."
580,14," The District Court defined the market as proposed by NASL, and the parties do not contest this definition. In light of that 
consensus, we regard the relevant market to be the same. "

636,3," Prior to the 2007 amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(c)(4) encompassed the current version of Rule 
23(c)(4) as Rule 23(c)(4)(A) and the current version of Rule 23(c)(5) as Rule 23(c)(4)(B). In its entirety, the pre-2007 version of 
Rule 23(c)(4) read as follows: ""When appropriate (A) an action may be brought or maintained as a class action with respect to 
particular issues, or (B) a class may be divided into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class, and the provisions of this 
rule shall then be construed and applied accordingly."" 5 Moore's Federal Practice § 23App.07[1] (3d ed. 2017)."
636,4," We accordingly do not read Robidoux's statement that a court ""should not dismiss the action simply because the complaint 
seeks to define the class too broadly,"" 987 F.2d at 937, to require that a court explore every avenue in order to certify a class in 
some form in each case. See Lundquist, 993 F.2d at 15 (""[T]he district court's refusal to shoulder what, in the final analysis, is 
plaintiff's burden cannot be regarded in this case as an abuse of discretion.""). "
638,5," ""While the gatekeeping function requires the district court to ascertain the reliability of [an expert's] methodology, it does not 
necessarily require that a separate hearing be held in order to do so."" Williams, 506 F.3d at 161. Because the parties' Daubert 
motions have been extensively briefed and the record is well-developed, we conclude that the ""formality of a separate hearing 
[is] not required."" Id.; see also In re U.S. Foodservice Inc. Pricing Litig., 729 F.3d 108, 130 (2d Cir. 2013) (""[E]ven though the 
district court did not conduct a Daubert hearing, it considered the admissibility of the expert testimony on the papers.""). "
639,6," Further, as Tourre recognized, factual narrative offered by an expert is not ""traceable to a reliable methodology"" and therefore 
""fails to fulfill Daubert's most basic requirements"" in a second way. 950 F. Supp. 2d at 675 (citing In re Rezulin, 309 F. Supp. 2d 
at 551). "
640,7," We note that expert opinion is additionally subject to the requirements of Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and ""may 
be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or 
misleading the jury."" Nimely, 414 F.3d at 397 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 403). Accordingly, some courts have subjected expert 
opinion offered at, or prior to, the class certification to the strictures of Rule 403. See, e.g., Scott v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., 
315 F.R.D. 33, 44, 47 (S.D.N.Y. 2016); In re Air Cargo Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig., No. 06 md-1175 (JG)(VVP), 2014 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 180914, 2014 WL 7882100 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 2014). However, we decline to apply Rule 403 to expert testimony offered at this stage. Rule 403's concerns regarding unfair prejudice 
and misleading the jury have less force in the class certification context, where the Court serves as the trier of fact. Cf. Nimely, 
414 F.3d at 397 (identifying ""the uniquely important role that Rule 403 has to play in a district court's scrutiny of expert testimony, 
given the unique weight such evidence may have in a jury's deliberations"" (emphasis added)). "
641,8," We have previously broken the class period into several ""Periods"" to facilitate our discussion of statutes of limitations, inquiry

the period between August 9, 2007 and May 28, 2008. ""Period 2"" refers to the period between May 29, 2008 and April 14, 2009. 
""Period 3"" refers to the period between April 15, 2009 and the end of the class period. See LIBOR IV, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
147561 at *277-78, 2015 WL 6243526, at *115-16. We use ""Suppression Period"" to refer to Periods 1, 2, and 3. "
642,9," The dates in subparts A and B of the proposed class definition therefore do not track exactly the Periods we have previously 
specified. We follow Exchange plaintiffs' proposed definition where applicable."
642,10," Though no longer a defendant following our personal-jurisdiction rulings in LIBOR IV and LIBOR VI, HSBC has also settled 
with the Exchange plaintiffs (Letter from Christopher Lovell & David Kovel to the Court, Oct. 11, 2017, ECF No. 2307), and we 
similarly deferred preliminary approval of that settlement. "
643,11," UBS also submitted two expert reports from Dr. Janusz Ordover: (1) an initial report dated April 21, 2017 (Decl. of Jefferson 
Bell ex. 1, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2008); and (2) a sur-rebuttal report dated June 30, 2017 (Decl. of Jefferson Bell ex. 2, June 
30, 2017, ECF No. 2008). Exchange plaintiffs did not seek to exclude any portion of Dr. Ordover's reports. UBS also did not file 
any Daubert motions."
643,12," Dr. Seyhun is the Jerome B. and Eilene M. York Professor of Business Administration and a Professor of Finance at the 
University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. He holds a Ph.D. and M.S. from the University of Rochester and a B.S. from 
Northwestern University, and has written a number of published papers on various finance and securities topics. (Seyhun Initial 
Report app. B.)"
643,13," ""Specifically, the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method of linear regression solves for a [line of best fit] that minimizes the sum 
of the squared residuals."" Reed Constr. Data Inc. v. McGraw-Hill Cos., 49 F. Supp. 3d 385, 397 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). Each 
""residual"" is the difference between the actual observed value of the dependent variable and the value of the dependent variable 
estimated using the line of best fit. "
644,14," Dr. Seyhun also uses Federal Reserve Eurodollar Rate (FRED) as the reference rate in part of his analysis. (Seyhun Initial 
Report 9191 59-69, tbl.2.1.) However, his subsequent calculations do not rely on but-for LIBOR calculated using the FRED rate."
644,15," The ICAP-Ask rate is a data series, published alongside the ICAP-Bid rate, by ICAP Capital Markets LLC. In response to 
subpoenas issued in this case, ICAP explained that this rate is ""meant to provide general 'market color' regarding the range of 
offer rates by top tier banks on unsecured liabilities in the overnight wholesale money market"" and was ""formed from pricing 
indications and other market information, including but not limited to the range of offers that ICAP's brokers observe in the 
market."" (Decl. of Jamie Heine ex. 41, July 1, 2017, ECF No. 2031.) The parties dispute whether the ICAP-Ask rate in fact 
represents ask (or offer) rates, and ICAP explained that it ""interpreted the range that it quoted as a high and a low for the 
expected range for trades done by upper tier banks,"" which ""Bloomberg's methodology converted . . . to a bid and an offer."" 
(Decl. of Jamie Heine ex. 41, July 1, 2017, ECF No. 2031.) In referring to this rate as the ""ICAP-Ask rate,"" we do not suggest 
that the data series in fact corresponds to ask (or offer) rates rather than bid rates or some other indicator."
644,16," Dr. Seyhun suggests that these methods apply only during the Suppression Period and not Period 0, but presents data for 
both periods. (Seyhun Initial Report ¶¶ 91-102, figs.1E1-1F17.)"
644,17," ""[A] credit default swap allows an investor to buy . . . in essence an insurance policy, to protect him against the probability of 
default by requiring the seller of protection to pay the investor the par value if there is a default before the bond matures. A credit 
default swap spread [is] the price the seller of protection charges, capturing 'the spread between a risk-free bond and . . . a risky 
bond.'"" In re Enron Corp. Sec. Derivative & ""ERISA"" Litig., 529 F. Supp. 2d 644, 764 (S.D. Tex. 2006)."
644,18," A logarithm (or log) is the mathematical inverse of exponentiation: if x taken to the yth power equals z, the log base x of z 
equals y. To take a specific example: 10 to the third power equals 1000, and the log base 10 of 1000 equals 3. The natural 
logarithm is one specific logarithm in which the base is the mathematical constant e, which is equal to approximately 2.7183. 
Because Dr. Seyhun has specified this regression using the natural log of LIBOR submissions and the natural log of CDS 
spreads, the results may be interpreted in percentage terms. "
645,19," Generally, the nth ""lagged"" value of explanatory variable refers to that variable's value n time periods prior. In Dr. Seyhun's 
models, which are daily, the third lag of an explanatory variable, for example, would refer to that variable's value three days 
earlier."
645,20," The text of Dr. Seyhun's report indicates that his clean period is ""January 1, 2004 to August 7, 2007 and May 18, 2010-Dec. 
31, 2013."" (Seyhun Rebuttal Report ¶ 497.) However, in a footnote, he states that ""[t]he end of my estimation period is 
December 31, 2012,"" acknowledging Dr. Hubbard's observation that ICAP-Ask remains constant for an eight-month period in 
2013. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report ¶ 497 n.301.) We accordingly assume that the clean period for this regression ended in 2012 as 
Dr. Seyhun states in a footnote rather than in 2013 as Dr. Seyhun states in the text of his report. "
646,21," For example, if an expert presented two models, one of which found upward manipulation on days amounting to 49% of the 
class period and the other of which found downward manipulation on exactly the same days, we would have serious doubts as 
to the reliability of those models even though the sum of the percentages -- 49% plus 49% -- is less than 100%."
646,22," That is, where one model finds positive artificiality and another model finds negative artificiality. "
647,23," We also question whether a single methodology, if applied inconsistently by an expert, could be properly termed a 
""methodology"" at all, let alone a reliable one."
647,24," Rabobank's 57% figure is calculated as 700 days with identified artificiality in 2000 through 2004, divided by 1225 trading days 
in that period. In the 251 trading days in 2013, the first ICAP-Ask based model identifies 31 days with artificiality; 50% is 
calculated as the sum of 700 and 31 divided by the sum of 1225 and 251. (Hubbard Initial Report ex. 9.1.)"
647,25," Rabobank's 39% figure is calculated as 284 days with identified artificiality in 2000 through 2002, divided by 732 trading days 
in that period. Because the second ICAP-Ask-based model does not identify any artificiality in 2013, 29% is calculated as 284 
divided by the sum of 732 and 251, the total number of trading days in the entire clean period. (Hubbard Initial Report ex. 9.2.)"
647,26," Even assuming the Rebuttal Period 0 model identifies no artificiality whatsoever in the second part of its clean period, Period 0 
accounts for 58% of trading days in the Rebuttal Period 0 model's aggregate clean period. "
648,27," Similarly, in describing Dr. Seyhun's analyses, Dr. Netz explains that ""Dr. Seyhun proposed to model the relationship between 
LIBOR and a benchmark interest rate during a time period that was not subject to manipulation."" (Netz Rebuttal Report 5 
(emphasis added).)"
648,28," This reliance would be especially troubling in light of Exchange plaintiffs' contentions, and Mr. Beevers's opinions, that many 
instances of trader-based manipulation would have occurred verbally and are not documented. (Beevers Initial Report ¶¶ 118-
24.) "
650,29," Of the remaining 15 instances, Dr. Netz finds that 10 involved downward manipulation and five instances in which the LIBOR 
submission was unchanged. "
651,30," For a description of OLS regressions, see supra note 13."
651,31," To the extent that Exchange plaintiffs suggest that a regression's high coefficient of determination, which is commonly referred 
to as ""R-squared"" and measures the percentage of variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the selected 
explanatory variables, necessarily implies that regression's reliability and admissibility, (Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 15 & n.17), we 
disagree. A regression may be unreliable, and therefore excludable, despite having a high R-squared, for being misspecified 
(including by failing to account for significant explanatory variables), among other reasons. "
652,32," In his initial report, Dr. Seyhun also makes a data processing error in assembling his EDF price series involving ""rollover"" 
dates, as Dr. Culp documents. (Culp Initial Report app. D ¶¶ 388-400.) Dr. Seyhun's rebuttal report acknowledges and corrects 
this error. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report ¶¶ 184-87.)"
652,33," Dr. Seyhun's initial report bears no indication that he uses the shifted (next-day) 3-month LIBOR series rather than a 
contemporaneous series for the analyses contained in that report. However, in response to Dr. Culp's and Dr. Ordover's 
identification of the issue, Dr. Seyhun acknowledges in his rebuttal report that he did so, and explicitly indicates whether each 
model presented in his rebuttal report uses contemporaneous or next-day LIBOR. (Seyhun Rebuttal Report ¶¶ 84, 86.)"
652,34, These criteria each offer a method of determining how many lags of a given variable to use in a regression.
652,35," Rabobank also criticizes Dr. Seyhun for having conducted these regressions using data from the full class period, January 1, 
2005 to May 17, 2010, rather than from only Period 0. (Rabobank Seyhun Mem. 20.) This argument is not necessarily 
persuasive, as Dr. Seyhun's opinions regarding the relationship between changes in LIBOR and changes in EDF prices apply 
equally to changes in LIBOR caused by trader-based manipulation in Period 0 and changes in LIBOR caused by persistent 
suppression in the later part of the Class Period. Dr. Culp finds meaningfully different results when Dr. Seyhun's analyses are "
653,," conducted separately only over Period 0 and not the Suppression Period (Culp Initial Report ¶ 216, tbl.6), which lends support 
for the theory that macroeconomic factors -- which differed substantially between Period 0 and the Suppression Period -- heavily 
influence the ""impact factors"" that Dr. Seyhun calculates. We are similarly skeptical of Rabobank's arguments relying on inconsistency between Dr. Seyhun's findings and Dr. Culp's 
findings, as any such inconsistency would not call into question the reliability of Dr. Seyhun's methodologies. (Rabobank Seyhun 
Mem. 17-18; Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 17-19.)"
653,36, The parties do not dispute that an EDF contract settles at the price of 100 minus LIBOR on the settlement date.
653,37," Dr. Seyhun suggests at one point that panel banks may have engaged in insider trading (Seyhun Rebuttal Report ¶¶ 133, 
137), but Exchange plaintiffs do not rely on this argument in their opposition to Rabobank's motion. "
655,38," Dr. Netz is a founder and partner of ApplEcon, an economics consulting firm, and was formerly a professor of economics at 
Purdue University. She holds a Ph.D. and M.A. in economics from the University of Michigan and a B.A. in economics from the 
University of California, Berkeley, has written a number of papers on antitrust economics, and has served as an expert witness 
in numerous antitrust cases. (Netz Initial Report app. A.) "
656,39," Additionally, even if the trader communications interpreted by Dr. Netz required expert knowledge, we would question whether 
Dr. Netz's expertise in antitrust economics extends so far as to include terminology used by EDF traders. "
657,40," To the extent that Dr. Netz's ""evidence exists"" opinions address the admissibility of evidence, those opinions are inadmissible 
for yet another reason: opining on a legal question, the resolution of which is left to the Court. See Foreman, 950 F. Supp. 2d at 
975; see also Fed. R. Evid. 104(a). "
658,41," Dr. Netz's median-replacement methodology maximizes the frequency with which Rabobank's submission impacts but-for 
LIBOR, though not the magnitude of that impact. A but-for LIBOR submission by Rabobank equal to the median of actual 
submissions ensures that the but-for submission will fall within the interquartile range and therefore will not be excluded by the 
trimming methodology."
658,42," Additionally, as we have already held, the various documents that Dr. Netz purports to interpret are understandable on their 
face and do not require particular expertise to interpret. It naturally follows that her resulting opinions should not be excluded 
based on a lack of qualifications (though they may be inadmissible for other reasons). "
659,43," Further, the documents bear little indication that the traders were referring to EDFs as opposed to other futures contracts or 
other LIBOR-based instruments, and Dr. Netz appears to assume so without justifying that assumption. Additionally, Dr. Netz's 
final example, regarding LIBOR manipulation on a settlement date, does not establish that traders believed changes in LIBOR 
caused changes in EDF prices generally. The proposition that the settlement price of an EDF is dependent on the settlement 
date's published LIBOR is uncontroverted. (E.g., Culp Initial Report ¶ 92)."
659,44," Her further opinion that the impact of alleged LIBOR manipulation on EDF prices was ""frequent and common"" is additionally 
unsupported; it is unclear how she reaches that opinion based on the probabilities stated in her initial report. (Netz Rebuttal 
Report 20.) If on a given day the impact of manipulation on published LIBOR is less than half the minimum price increment, the 
probability that that manipulation impacted EDF prices would be less than 50% under Dr. Netz's formula and she would therefore 
be unable to conclude that the manipulation more likely than not impacted EDF prices."

660,46," Under the CEA, ""a plaintiff has standing to bring a commodities manipulation action only if he has suffered 'actual damages' as 
a result of defendant's manipulation."" LIBOR II, 962 F. Supp. 2d at 620 (quoting 7 U.S.C. § 25(a)(1)). Establishing ""actual 
damages"" requires some notion of netting. See id. "
661,47," Specifically, Mr. Beevers has worked at various financial institutions for more than 20 years, including as a trader and in 
certain risk management positions. (Beevers Initial Report app. A.) More recently, as counsel informed us at oral argument, Mr. 
Beevers was appointed by the Governor of Bank of England to the working group studying replacements for LIBOR. (Hr'g Tr. 
16:24-17:3.) "
662,48," Mr. Beevers's specific criticism of ""nonsensical"" date information in certain records is also not supported by the example he 
identifies at paragraphs 52 and 53 of his initial report. He asserts that ""the maturity date is nonsensical insofar as the maturity 
date is before the trade date,"" but the identified maturity date of September 22, 2015 is obviously well after the trade date of 
June 10, 2005. (Beevers Initial Report ¶¶ 52-53.) "
663,49," Our skepticism is confirmed by the amorphousness of the correlation analysis proposed by Mr. Beevers, which we address 
fully below."
663,50," Again, Mr. Beevers's opinions regarding the ""necessity"" of trader-level records in establishing trader-based manipulation 
directly conflict with those of Dr. Seyhun, who opines that TBM can be identified using various methodologies, none of which rely 
on the trader-level records sought by Mr. Beevers. "
664,51," Mr. Beevers's reports leave ambiguous whether this second criterion identifies one submission or both submissions as 
anomalous. At oral argument, counsel clarified that whether one submission is considered anomalous or both submissions are 
""depends on the circumstances and requires a little bit more facts."" (Hr'g Tr. 16:18-19.) This response is hardly illuminating, 
though as we explain below, the ambiguity left in Mr. Beevers's opinion here does not affect our conclusion as to its admissibility. "
665,52, This statistic is calculated by differencing the figures presented in Exhibit 29 of the Hubbard Rebuttal Report.
665,53," Mr. Beevers's criteria apparently also identify high rates of anomalous submissions in 2015 and 2016, periods in which 
Exchange plaintiffs have not alleged, and cannot credibly allege, manipulation. (Hubbard Rebuttal Report ¶ 58 n.120.)"
665,54," Mr. Beevers's and Dr. Seyhun's methodologies also frequently yield directionally inconsistent results. Dr. Seyhun's models 
identify artificiality in the opposite direction from artificiality identified by Mr. Beevers's methodology on 23% to 43% of the days in 
Period 0 on which Mr. Beevers identifies anomalous 3-month LIBOR submissions by Rabobank. (Hubbard Rebuttal Report ¶ 63, 
tbl.3, ex. 30.) "
666,55," Additionally, we would question whether opinions based on the interpretation of trader communications are products of Mr. 
Beevers's expertise. Contrary to Exchange plaintiffs' suggestion that the interpretation of the communications between traders in 
question involves ""parsing through the technical jargon and terminology"" found in those communications and ""requires 
experience and familiarity with the practices and customs of dealing rooms,"" (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 16), Dr. Netz -- did not 
claim any such experience -- was able to undertake a similar exercise interpreting trader communications (Netz Initial Report 13, 
18, 20). Indeed, Exchange plaintiffs identify no instances in which the communications that Mr. Beevers canvasses for indicia of 
trader-based manipulation contains ""technical jargon and terminology"" obscuring their meaning; their attempt to recast a reading 
comprehension exercise as something more is unavailing. "
667,56," ""In conducting a formal significance test, researchers start from the hypothesis they are seeking to disprove, called the 'null 
hypothesis' or 'null.' They then ask: Assuming the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of observing data that conflict 
with the null hypothesis to at least as great an extent as do the data actually observed? . . . If the answer falls below a 
predetermined significance threshold (often 5%), then the null hypothesis is sufficiently inconsistent with the data that it is 
deemed 'rejected,' and the result is deemed 'statistically significant.'"" Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Rauch, 244 F. Supp. 3d 66, 
89-90 (D.D.C. 2017) (citations omitted). "
668,57," In one instance, Mr. Beevers refers to the ""median"" value (Beevers Initial Report ¶ 93), though he more often refers to the 
second reference rate as the ""mode"" or the ""modal value"" (Beevers Initial Report ¶¶ 95, 98, 99, tbl.2). Assuming that Mr. 
Beevers did in fact use the mode as his second reference rate, Mr. Beevers does not explain his methodology when two 
different submissions were equally frequent on a given day."
668,58," Mr. Beevers does not specify how many simulations are incorporated into the results presented in his report beyond ""many 
thousands."" (Beevers Initial Report ¶ 94.) "
669,59," We reject out of hand Exchange plaintiffs' suggestion that a model or statistical technique that is accepted and reliable in one 
context should be considered reliable and admissible in all contexts. (Exch. Pls.' Beevers Opp'n 21.)"
669,60," Based on a year having approximately 252 trading days, 666 days corresponds roughly to the 2.64-year length of Period 0. "
670,61," Mr. Beevers's opinion here, that many instances of trader-based manipulation would not be reflected in a written record 
because they involved in-person requests, significantly undermines Dr. Seyhun's reliance on documentary evidence of trader-
based manipulation in his Rebuttal Period 0 Model. (E.g., Seyhun Initial Report ¶ 89; Exch. Pls.' Seyhun Opp'n 12-13, 17-18.) "
671,62," Mr. Miller is a vice president of A.B. Data has participated in the administration of numerous class-action settlements. (Miller 
Decl. ¶¶ 1, 3.) "
672,63," Indeed, as counsel conceded at oral argument, Exchange plaintiffs have served 89 subpoenas on various FCMs, and have 
received no data in response. (Hr'g Tr. 9:22-25; 11:14-24.)"
672,64," Mr. Miller's declaration refers to ""settlement"" several times. (Miller Decl. ¶¶ 5, 9, 19.) We are, of course, considering whether a 
litigation class should be certified."
672,65, Mr. Miller also lacks personal knowledge as to the existence and retention of these trading records.
672,66," Additionally, following Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase's settlements with Exchange plaintiffs, no live antitrust claims 
remain in this action. Though Mr. Miller offers this opinion divorced from context, it appears to be offered to support Atlantic 
Trading's standing to assert antitrust claims corresponding to subpart A of the class definition. Because no antitrust claims 
remain, this opinion has likely been rendered irrelevant. "
673,67," Specifically, Exchange plaintiffs seek to exclude the following paragraphs of Dr. Culp's reports: paragraphs 16 through 37, 40, 
92 through 111, 187 through 222, 271 through 278, 349, and 352 through 364 of the Culp Initial Report and paragraphs 5, 6, 8 
through 12, 20 through 22, 25 through 28, and 51 through 56 of the Culp Rebuttal Report. (Exch. Pls.' Culp Mem. 1.)"
673,68," Dr. Culp serves as an adjunct professor at both the Swiss Finance Institute and the University of Bern and holds a Ph.D. in 
financial economics from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and a B.A. in economics from the Johns Hopkins 
University. He has also conducted extensive research and written numerous papers on various finance topics. (Culp Initial 
Report app. F.)"
673,69," The first four of these critiques can also be rejected at the threshold as critiques going to the weight of Dr. Culp's opinions 
rather than their admissibility. These critiques do not seriously challenge Dr. Culp's theoretical reasoning or empirical 
methodology; they at most offer competing evidence to be weighed in the Rule 23 analysis."
673,70," John W. Labuszewski, Understanding Eurodollar Futures, CME Group Inc. (2013). "
674,71," For any two times in the future, t1 and t2, the implied forward rate formula calculates the spot rate expected at time t1 covering 
the time period between time t1 and time t2. Taking three months and six months as an example, the three-month spot rate 
expected in three months may be derived from the currently observed three-month rate spot and currently observed six-month 
spot rate."
674,72," While Dr. Seyhun offers the overlap theory in his rebuttal report (Seyhun Rebuttal Report ¶¶ 38-50), he never reduces the 
overlap theory into the weighted-average formula offered by Exchange plaintiffs in their challenge to Dr. Culp. "
675,73," Further, these documents are susceptible to interpretation at best. For example, the third communication appears to reference 
EDF trading based on expectations of LIBOR in advance of its publication. This interpretation would be consistent with 
Rabobank's argument -- and Dr. Seyhun, Dr. Netz, and Exchange plaintiffs' concessions -- that EDF prices incorporate 
significant macroeconomic information that is also incorporated into LIBOR, as that information guides ""expectations"" of LIBOR. "
676,74," The analysis of changes in EDF prices surrounding the publication of LIBOR is presented at paragraphs 116 through 169 of 
the Culp Initial Report and the analysis of the relationship between LIBOR-derived implied forward rates and EDF-implied rates 
is presented at paragraphs 45 through 51 of the Culp Rebuttal Report. Exchange plaintiffs do not include these paragraphs in 
the list of sections they seek to exclude. (Exch. Pls.' Culp Mem. 1.)"
676,75," Exchange plaintiffs also contend that these analyses are ""ultimately irrelevant."" (Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 10.) This suggestion is 
baffling, given that Exchange plaintiffs' experts -- and Exchange plaintiffs themselves -- expound extensively on the significance 
of implied forward rates and arbitrage in establishing a causal relationship between LIBOR and EDF prices. (Seyhun Initial 
Report ¶¶ 108-09; Netz Initial Report 32-33; Netz Rebuttal Report 15-16; Exch. Pls.' Culp Mem. 7-9; Exch. Pls.' Culp Reply 3-4.)"
676,76," Dr. Culp relies on Dr. Hubbard's calculations that Rabobank's alleged manipulation of LIBOR had a maximum impact of 0.125 
basis points. (Culp Initial Report ¶¶ 221-22; Hubbard Initial Report ¶ 216.) "
677,77," Exchange plaintiffs seek the exclusion of paragraphs 17(b), 32 through 34, 164, 171, and 174 through 185 of the Hubbard 
Initial Report and Appendix D of that report. (Exch. Pls.' Hubbard Mem. 1.)"
677,78," Dr. Hubbard serves as Dean and Russell L. Carson Professor of Economics and Finance at the Columbia Graduate School of 
Business and on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Panel of Economic Advisors. Dr. Hubbard holds a Ph.D. and an A.M. 
in Economics from Harvard University, and has written extensively on various topics in finance and economics. (Hubbard Initial 
Report app. A.)"
677,79," For the same reasons, Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on paragraph 174 of the Hubbard Initial Report, where Dr. Hubbard opines 
that ""most of"" the data deficiencies identified by Mr. Beevers are not actually deficiencies, is unavailing. (Hubbard Initial Report ¶ 
174.)"
677,80," Broadly speaking, ""folder mapping"" refers to the ability to identify the individual trader responsible for specific trading positions 
and transactions. "
678,81," This conclusion is consistent with our prior holding that Dr. Netz is qualified to opine on the relationship between LIBOR and 
EDF prices based on her training and experience in economics and econometrics, her lack of specific experience with EDFs and 
EDF trading notwithstanding."
678,82," Dr. Hubbard identifies specifically the documents located at Bates ranges RABO_METZLER_ 0188130-0189842, 0189843-
0190724, and 0190725-0193254. (Hubbard Initial Report app. C.) "
679,83," Dr. Willig is a Professor Emeritus of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, having served as a professor from 
July 1978 through June 2016. He holds a Ph.D. in Economics and an M.S. in Operations Research from Stanford University, 
and an A.B. in Mathematics from Harvard University, and his written extensively on topics in economics and finance. (Willig 
Initial Report app. 1.)"
679,84," Exchange plaintiffs do not specify that they challenge only certain parts of Dr. Willig's reports, but also offer no argument as to 
Dr. Willig's opinions that are not dependent on his analysis of transaction data. "
681,85," Exchange plaintiffs did not initially disclose these changes, which we discovered after we directed the filing of a redline 
comparing the proposed fourth amended complaint and the corrected fourth amended complaint. (Letter from Christopher Lovell 
& David Kovel to the Court, Dec. 13, 2017, ECF No. 2370.) Even setting aside the question of whether the scope of Exchange 
plaintiffs' leave to amend extends to changes like these, see Apr. 20, 2017 Order, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118230 at *113-114, 
ECF No. 1859 (granting ""plaintiffs leave to supplement their complaint in [a] single regard,"" ""the issue of speculative damages in 
the context of the efficient enforcer analysis""), they have only removed some of the ""borrowing costs"" allegations in the operative 
complaint. (e.g., Corrected 4AC ¶ 13 (""By acting together and in concert to knowingly understate their true borrowing costs, 
Defendants caused LIBOR to be set at artificial levels."")). "
683,86," Exchange plaintiffs rely on the July 10, 2017 version of the webpage and UBS relies on the July 20, 2017 version, but the two 
versions are identical. (Isquith Willig Decl. ex. 8; Mishkin Willig Decl. ex. 8.)"
683,87," Prior to this revision, the LIBOR question read: ""At what rate do you think interbank term deposits will be offered by one prime 
bank to another prime bank [in a] reasonable market size today at 11.00 am?"""
683,88, These two earlier versions appear to be identical.
683,89, This statement also bolsters our earlier conclusion that the text of the LIBOR question is ambiguous. 
684,90," Given that we find unpersuasive Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on this JPMorgan Chase document, we also reject the notion 
that JPMorgan Chase should be ""estopped"" from offering Dr. Willig's opinions. (Exch. Pls.' Willig Mot. 10.) This questionable 
conception of ""estoppel"" has no basis in law, but if we were to apply it, we would conclude that certain named plaintiffs' 
testimony that LIBOR is based on actual transaction rates would preclude Exchange plaintiffs from offering many of the 
arguments supporting their challenge to Dr. Willig's opinions. For example, Atlantic Trading's 30(b)(6) representative testified, in 
response to the question ""when a LIBOR submitter is making their decision about what to submit, could they consider their 
actual borrowing costs that day,"" that he ""would think that's the sole thing they're basing it on."" (Mishkin Willig Decl. ex. 3.)"
684,91," Indeed, the paper makes clear that the relationship between actual transaction rates and offered rates is a function of the bid-
ask spread. (Kuo, Skeie & Vickery at 7.) The existence of such a relationship, which suggests that the difference between actual 
transaction rates and offered rates can be controlled for, bolsters Dr. Willig's analysis. "
685,92," Exchange plaintiffs additionally argue that Dr. Willig's selection of the 95th percentile is unsupported and speculative. This 
assumption is not troubling given that this analysis is conservative compared to Dr. Willig's primary analysis based on weighted-
average transaction rates; the line must be drawn somewhere. "
687,93," Subpart B.3 is, therefore, wholly redundant of the prefatory language."
687,94," Contrary to Exchange plaintiffs' contention (Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 7), the Second Circuit in In re Petrobras considered the 
certification of classes whose definitions included the criteria ""and were damaged thereby,"" 862 F.3d at 259 (emphasis added), 
not ""and were harmed thereby."" "
688,95," Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on the Seventh Circuit's decision in Kohen v. Pacific Investment Management Co. (""Kohen II""), 
571 F.3d 672 (7th Cir. 2009), [**262]  is not persuasive. Though Kohen II held that ""as long as one member of a certified class 
has a plausible claim to have suffered damages, the requirement of standing is satisfied"" in the Seventh Circuit, id. at 676, and 
accepted the probability that ""a class will often include persons who have not been injured by the defendant's conduct,"" id. at 
677, the Second Circuit takes a different approach in requiring at least some analysis of absent class members' Article III 
standing, see Denney, 443 F.3d at 264-65. See generally In re Deepwater Horizon, 739 F.3d 790, 800-02 (5th Cir. 2014) 
(comparing the Seventh Circuit's approach to Article III standing in Kohen II and the Second Circuit's approach in Denney). 
Kohen II and Denney may ultimately yield the same result, cf. id. at 802-04 (reaching the same result applying both tests), but 
we are nonetheless bound to apply Denney. "
689,96," Further, even if we were to assess the named plaintiffs' Article III standing based only on allegations, any evidentiary 
deficiencies would likely present typicality and adequacy of representation issues at the Rule 23 stage. See In re IPO, 471 F.3d 
at 41-42."
689,97, We revisit these issues in our analysis of typicality. 
690,98," For this reason, Denney and Kohen II are likely to produce the same substantive result in most cases. Provided there is at 
least one named plaintiff providing sufficient evidence of its personal Article III standing, additional named plaintiffs failing to 
meet the (higher) evidentiary threshold would simply be considered absent class members subject to the (lower) pleading 
standard. As Waller v. Hewlett-Packard Co. observed in the context of the Ninth Circuit's intra-circuit Denney/Kohen II split: 
""Stearns [the Ninth Circuit's application of Kohen II] says absent class members don't need standing and Mazza [the Ninth 
Circuit's application of Denney] says they do, but Mazza . . . seems to set a rather low bar for standing anyway."" 295 F.R.D. 472, 
476 (S.D. Cal. 2013) (citing Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581 (9th Cir. 2012); Stearns v. Ticketmaster Corp., 655 
F.3d 1013 (9th Cir. 2011)). "
691,99," We are unpersuaded by Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on In re Amaranth Natural Gas Litigation, 269 F.R.D. 366, 371 n.9 
(S.D.N.Y. 2010), for the proposition that class certification (including a finding of typicality) is proper even when named plaintiffs 
""may have received a net benefit as a result of the alleged manipulation."" (Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 9.) Amaranth cited Kohen v. 
Pacific Investment Management Co. (""Kohen I""), for this proposition, but Kohen I referenced net benefit to absent class 
members swept into an allegedly overbroad class definition, not to named plaintiffs. See Kohen I, 244 F.R.D. 469, 475 (N.D. Ill. 
2007). "
692,100," Rabobank frames these arguments as challenges to the named plaintiffs' standing, but we conclude they are equally 
applicable to typicality."
692,101," At oral argument, Rabobank questioned whether the data presented in Exchange plaintiffs' January 16, 2018 submission are 
accurate, asserting that several of the critical assumptions underlying those calculations were not disclosed. (Hr'g Tr. 72:22-
74:24.) Though we have previously emphasized the importance of making clear the bases for any calculation of trading positions 
and question why Exchange plaintiffs did not proffer evidence establishing the named plaintiffs' standing after we struck Dr. 
Seyhun's August 2017 declaration, see Jan. 9, 2018 Order, ECF No. 2400; Sept. 7, 2017 Order, ECF No. 2255, we nonetheless 
afford Exchange plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt and accept the data presented in the January 16, 2018 Elrod declaration. 
Absent the information contained in that declaration, Exchange plaintiffs would have scant evidence supporting the typicality of 
their claims or the adequacy of their representation. Exchange plaintiffs' representations that they engaged in extensive trading 
throughout the class period (e.g., Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 10-11), absent some supporting evidence, are simply insufficient. "
693,102," In light of this prior representation regarding the legal capacity of Metzler's constituent funds, counsel's reference to the 
assignment of certain claims to Metzler as fund manager is somewhat puzzling. "
694,103," The class standing analysis is distinct from the analysis of typicality under Rule 23(a)(3), see NECA, 693 F.3d at 158 n.9, but 
the second prong of NECA's class standing test -- whether the challenged conduct ""implicates the same set of concerns as the 
conduct alleged to have caused injury to other members of the putative class,"" RBPA, 775 F.3d at 161, parallels typicality's 
requirements that ""each class member's claim arises from the same course of events,"" In re Flag Telecom, 574 F.3d at 35 
(quoting Robidoux, 987 F.2d at 936), and that disputed issues ""occupy essentially the same degree of centrality to the named 
plaintiff's claim as to that of other members of the proposed class,"" Mazzei, 829 F.3d at 272 (quoting Caridad, 191 F.3d at 293). 
See generally 1 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 2:6 (5th ed.) (Westlaw 2017) (considering the overlap 
between class standing requirements and Rule 23(a)). Of course, class standing may be established based on allegations alone, 
see RBPA, 775 F.3d at 161, but typicality must be established based on evidence presented at class certification and a 
preponderance of that evidence, see Bombardier, 546 F.3d at 202."
694,104," And though we exclude this portion of Mr. Beevers's opinions, we observe that the argument that Rabobank pursued a 
""unitary course of conduct"" is difficult to reconcile with Mr. Beevers's opinion that competing trading desks within a single 
financial institution are akin to ""warring factions."" (Beevers Initial Report ¶ 68.) "
695,105," We accordingly find Exchange plaintiffs' reliance on In re Natural Gas Commodities Litigation, 231 F.R.D. 171 (S.D.N.Y. 
2005), which relied on Sumitomo Copper to certify a class of both ""purchasers and sellers"" alleging manipulation in both 
directions, unpersuasive. See In re Nat. Gas, 231 F.R.D. at 182-83 (citing In re Sumitomo Copper, 182 F.R.D. at 92)."
695,106," These conflicts are between named plaintiffs, but we fully expect that similar conflicts would arise between named plaintiffs 
and absent class members. "
696,107," Rather, analyzing vicarious liability will likely introduce further individual questions, such as the agent's scope of employment, 
which are likely to differ from trader to trader and from bank to bank."
696,108," We note that the parties agree as to the days on which Rabobank's LIBOR submission could have affected published LIBOR, 
though the fact of agreement does not figure into the predominance analysis. Cf. In re Nassau Cty, 461 F.3d at 227 (""[A] 
concession does not eliminate a common issue from the predominance calculus.""). "
697,109," Our conclusion that intent is an individual question implies that Rabobank's asserted personal jurisdiction defense similarly 
poses an individualized question. See LIBOR V, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149629, 2015 WL 6696407, at *19-20 (discussing the 
significance of intent in assessing personal jurisdiction)."
697,110," We also reject Exchange plaintiffs' assertion that ""[t]o the extent Rabobank challenges the models as insufficient, its defense 
applies to the Class as a whole."" (Exch. Pls.' TBM Reply 16). Dr. Seyhun's models form part of Exchange plaintiffs' affirmative 
case, and they must carry the burden of establishing a classwide methodologies to calculate but-for LIBOR submissions and 
but-for published LIBOR. Rabobank's assertion that Dr. Seyhun's models are flawed is therefore not an affirmative defense, but 
a failure in Exchange plaintiffs' prima facie case. Indeed, taken to its natural conclusion, Exchange plaintiffs' argument would 
return us to the days when ""an expert's report will sustain a plaintiff's burden so long as it is not 'fatally flawed,'"" a notion the 
Second Circuit disavowed in In re IPO. See 471 F.3d at 40. "
698,111," We would also find more compelling Dr. Culp's extensive findings that changes in LIBOR do not cause determinable changes 
in EDF prices."
698,112, Dr. Netz offers the same formula. (Netz Initial Report 38.) 
699,113," Exchange plaintiffs' contentions to the contrary are simply incorrect. Neither Apex Oil Co. v. DiMauro, 744 F. Supp. 53 
(S.D.N.Y. 1990), nor Minpeco, 676 F. Supp. 486, were class actions, and In re Lidoderm Antitrust Litigation, No. 14-md-2521-
WHO, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24097, 2017 WL 679367, at *17-18 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 21, 2017), held at most that the selection of 
but-for price and the final damages calculation are reserved for the trier of fact. Here, we consider how to interpret as a matter of 
law the ""actual damages"" language found in the text of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. § 25(a), see also In re Vivendi Universal, 284 F.R.D. 
at 159 (noting, in the securities fraud context, that ""this Court has considerable discretion in determining how best to calculate 
compensable losses""), and whether that interpretation introduces individualized questions into the predominance analysis."
699,114," We reserve judgment here as to whether more extensive forms of netting, such as cross-instrument netting (across different 
types of LIBOR-based instruments), will be necessary."
699,115," To the extent Exchange plaintiffs claim that damages should be defined to include the time-value of money in their margin 
accounts (Netz Initial Report 46-47), doing so would introduce additional individualized questions as to each class member's 
margin requirements and cost of capital. "
701,116," Of course, based on the class standing requirements that we have previously set forth, some showing that at least one 
named plaintiff held a net trading position adversely impacted by trader-based manipulation would be required before the class 
definition could be so modified. "
702,117," For this reason, we would also reject any suggestion that issue certification under Rule 23(c)(4) would be appropriate in this 
case: issue certification ""would not materially advance the litigation because it would not dispose of [these] larger issues."" 
McLaughlin, 522 F.3d at 234."
702,118," Mr. Beevers also opines that there are ""potentially likely"" thousands of instances of trader-based manipulation. (Beevers 
Initial Report ¶ 117.) "
703,119," Subpart C.1 is therefore redundant of the class definition's prefatory language, which refers to any individual that transacted 
in EDFs during the Class Period. Because CEA claims based on trades in Period 1 and Period 2 are untimely, see LIBOR IV, 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, at *109, 2015 WL 6243526, at *116-17 (citing LIBOR III, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 471-77), subpart C.1 
and the prefatory language capture the same set of putative class members once the CEA statute of limitations is considered."
703,120," This class definition continues to satisfy Article III standing requirements, given the relaxed definition of Article III ""injury-in-
fact"" established by the Second Circuit in Denney. See 443 F.3d at 263-64. "
704,121," Though no antitrust claims remain in this action, this question is similar to the question of whether a conspiracy to suppress 
LIBOR existed, and ""allegations of the existence of a price-fixing conspiracy"" are often ""susceptible to common proof."" Cordes & 
Co., 502 F.3d at 105."
704,122," Additionally, 303030 Trading appeared to have no produced no records corresponding to trades in Period 3. (Ordover Initial 
Report ¶ 137, tbl.22.)"
704,123," Based on Dr. Ordover's analysis, we would reach a similar conclusion regarding named plaintiffs FTC Futures Fund PCC and 
FTC Futures Fund SICAV if all FTC Futures Fund entities were properly considered together. (Ordover Initial Report ¶¶ 132-34, 
tbl.21.) However, the two FTC Futures Fund named plaintiffs appear to be separate legal entities -- one incorporated in Gibraltar 
and one incorporated in Luxembourg (Corrected 4AC ¶¶ 26-27) -- and we cannot discern whether either or both actually 
benefitted from LIBOR suppression. "
705,124," We again subsume our consideration of the first element, panel banks' ability to influence market prices, into the third and 
fourth elements, the existence of and panel banks' causation of artificial prices. "
706,125," Further, even if LIBOR suppression were motivated by financial incentives like trading profits, intent to manipulate EDF prices 
would still need to be distinguished from intent to manipulate prices of other LIBOR-based instruments not at issue in this action."
706,126," In asserting that they have met these requirements, Exchange plaintiffs criticize Dr. Willig's opinions and assert, mystifyingly, 
that ""Defendant-friendly interpretations of emails or documents is inappropriate on the class motion as well as on summary 
judgment,"" citing cases in the summary judgment and directed verdict context. (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. Reply 4 & n.4.) In so 
contending, they have apparently forgotten that we are tasked with ""assess[ing] all of the relevant evidence admitted at the class 
certification stage"" and ""resolv[ing] factual disputes relevant to each Rule 23 requirement."" In re IPO, 471 F.3d at 41-42. Indeed, 
this objection is particularly difficult to understand in light of Exchange plaintiffs' subsequent argument that we should disregard 
Dr. Willig's opinions regarding the extent of suppression because they ""[c]ontradict independent evidence."" (Exch. Pls.' Suppr. 
Reply 7.) "
707,127," By ""inconsistent,"" we mean in a direction inconsistent with Exchange plaintiffs' theory. Under their theory, a decrease in 
LIBOR should cause an increase in EDF prices, since EDF contracts ultimately settle at a price of 100 minus 3-month LIBOR 
published on the settlement date. We find, relying on Dr. Ordover's analysis, that changes in LIBOR are often observed together 
with corresponding changes in EDF prices in the same direction, which is inconsistent with Exchange plaintiffs' theory. "
709,128," Issue certification under Rule 23(c)(4) is also inappropriate, as it ""would not materially advance the litigation because it would 
not dispose of larger issues"" remaining in the action. McLaughlin, 522 F.3d at 234."
709,129," The operative complaint lists the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico and Directors Financial Group as named 
plaintiffs. (SAC ¶¶ 22-23.) We previously dismissed the Government Development Bank's claims for being untimely under 
Puerto Rico law, LIBOR V, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149629, at *76, 2015 WL 6694607, at *12-13, and Directors Financial Group 
withdrew its claims, (Stipulation of Dismissal with Prejudice, Feb. 2, 2017, ECF No. 1758). "
710,130," Though we dismissed HSBC as a defendant in this action, HSBC has also settled with Berkshire. (Letter from Jeremy 
Lieberman to the Court, Jan. 16, 2018, ECF No. 2403.)"
710,131," Berkshire does not challenge the admissibility of Mr. Kelley's report (Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 1, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 
2025) or Dr. Ordover's report (Decl. of Paul Mishkin ex. 2, June 30, 2017, ECF No. 2025). We refer to these reports, which are 
both dated April 3, 2017, as the Kelley Report and the Ordover Report, respectively."
710,132," Dr. Webb is the Martin J. Pastel, Jr. Research Professor at the University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce and is the 
Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Futures Markets. He holds a Ph.D. and M.B.A. in Finance from the University of Chicago 
Graduate School of Business and has written extensively on various economic and finance subjects. (Webb Initial Report app. 
A.)"
710,133," For a description of the ICAP-Ask rate, see supra note 15. "
711,134," Dr. Webb explains that the R-squared of his Bloomberg CMPL regression is 99.99% over the period from January 1, 2004 to 
July 31, 2007, and his but-for LIBOR regression is presumably based on such a clean period. (Webb Initial Report ¶ 49 n.17.) R-
squared refers to the coefficient of determination, which measures the amount of variation in the dependent variable that can be 
explained by variation in the explanatory variables. See supra note 31."
711,135," Perhaps acknowledging this shortcoming of Dr. Webb's opinion, Berkshire belatedly suggests that we should revisit this 
analysis in LIBOR V. For the reasons we explain fully below, we decline this invitation. "
712,136," It also bears repeating that the acceptance of regressions as a statistical method generally does not imply that all regressions 
will be admissible under Daubert. Questions remain in each case as to whether the regression takes reliable data as inputs, see 
Fed. R. Evid. 702(b), whether the regression is properly specified, see, e.g., Bickerstaff, 196 F.3d at 449-50, and whether the 
expert properly interprets the regression to support any conclusions ultimately reached, see, e.g., Amorgianos, 303 F.3d at 267."
712,137," The interest rate associated with a floating rate loan consists of two components: the benchmark rate and a spread above or 
below that benchmark. For example, a floating rate loan might have an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points. The 
benchmark rate is 3-month LIBOR, and the spread is +50 basis points. "
713,138," Of course, the ""upstream"" aspects of Dr. Webb's analysis were not challenged by Lender defendants and remain admissible, 
our misgivings about certain aspects of that analysis notwithstanding."
713,139," Berkshire does not challenge Dr. Willig's qualifications. We conclude here, as we do in the Exchange-based action, that Dr. 
Willig is well qualified to offer the opinions presented in his report. See supra note 83. "
715,140," Berkshire's references to the bid-ask spread are accordingly unavailing. The bid-ask (or bid-offer) spread -- as its name 
suggests -- refers to bids and asks (or offers) themselves as opposed to bid-initiated transactions and offer-initiated transactions. "
716,141," At oral argument, counsel for Berkshire rejected the characterization of the $22 million as ""debt"" and referred to the 
instrument in question instead as a ""security"" and a ""securitization."" (Hr'g Tr. 61:5-6; 62:9.) We are unsure what exactly counsel 
meant (as debt would still be a ""security""), but counsel did not appear to dispute that the instrument in question resulted in 
Berkshire's receipt of funds in exchange for payments by Berkshire at an interest rate based on LIBOR. "
718,142," If Pomerantz were to seek attorneys' fees equal to 30% of the recovery produced by these settlements (the maximum it may 
seek), its fee award would be $8.1 million and Mordchai Krausz's share would be $1.22 million. We, of course, reserve judgment 
on the propriety of these settlements and any attendant application for attorneys' fees that might be made. "
719,143," At oral argument, counsel for Berkshire suggested that we have jurisdiction to preclude Mordchai Krausz from receiving any 
attorneys' fees that are ultimately awarded to Pomerantz. (Hr'g Tr. 29:7-10.) We are skeptical that our jurisdiction extends to 
what is ultimately a private contractual agreement between class counsel and an attorney who still has not entered a notice of 
appearance in this case. But even if our jurisdiction does so extend, such a post hoc remedy would be no more effective than 
post-settlement fairness review in curing a first-order adequacy problem. "
720,144," Additionally, to the extent Berkshire relies on In re Cardizem to suggest that review of settlements for fairness under Rule 
23(e)(2) may stand in for adequacy of representation under Rule 23(a)(4), we have rejected that contention."
720,145, We consider the issue of variations in state substantive law below.
720,146," The parties do not address Berkshire's second claim, conspiracy to commit fraud. We accordingly do not consider that claim 
separately in analyzing predominance. "
721,147," Berkshire's arguments relying solely on Moore accordingly conflate the issues of misrepresentation and reliance. Moore 
contrasted fraud claims based on uniform misrepresentations with fraud claims based on individualized misrepresentations and 
reasoned that the former were ""appropriate subjects for class certification because the standardized misrepresentations may be 
established by generalized proof."" 306 F.3d at 1253. That is, Moore addresses whether misrepresentation is a common 
question, not reliance. In light of McLaughlin, Moore cannot be read to suggest that all putative classes asserting fraud claims 
based on uniform misrepresentations must be certified. "
722,148," Further, we note that contrary to Berkshire's suggestion that a class member would not ""have purchased LIBOR-based loans 
without relying on LIBOR"" (Berkshire Class Reply 21), Dr. Webb opines that ""the prices for floating rate loans/bonds are not 
affected"" by LIBOR. (Webb Rebuttal Report ¶ 139.) "
723,149," To the extent the Second Circuit held in Schwab that an assessment of whether a plaintiff relied on the BBA's assurances 
regarding the accuracy of LIBOR is necessary to the statute of limitations inquiry, this additional consideration would confirm that 
statute-of-limitations issues are individual in nature. "
724,150," Mitigation presents an additional individualized damages issue, though Lender defendants present mitigation as an 
affirmative defense. In New York, ""a party who claims to have suffered damage by the tort of another is bound 'to use 
reasonable and proper efforts to make the damage as small as practicable,' and if an injured party allows the damages to be 
unnecessarily enhanced, the incurred loss justly falls upon him."" Williams v. Bright, 230 A.D.2d 548, 550, 658 N.Y.S.2d 910 (1st 
Dep't 1997) (quoting Blate v. Third Ave. R.R. Co., 44 A.D. 163, 167, 60 N.Y.S. 732 (1st Dep't 1899)). This assessment of what 
mitigation would have been ""reasonable and proper"" is almost necessarily individualized, since it depends on what ""practicable"" 
options were available to each lender in order to minimize its damages. Berkshire may very well be correct that in many 
instances, a lender would not have been required to mitigate its damages (Berkshire Class Reply 25 n.20), but its argument 
does not challenge the notion that an assessment of what is reasonable and proper will be plaintiff-specific."
724,151," Berkshire did not move for reconsideration of LIBOR V, and none of the authorities on which they rely in advocating for 
reconsideration represent intervening changes in law. We are thoroughly disinclined to reconsider LIBOR V given this delay, but 
even if we were inclined to reconsider, we would be unpersuaded that cases addressing fraud damages resulting from the 
purchase and sale of securities under federal law have bearing on the issuance of loans under New York law. See BDO 
Seidman, 222 F.3d at 73 (""[C]ommon-law fraud claims require a different analysis than those brought under the federal 
securities regulation scheme.""). Indeed, we read the Second Circuit's Schwab opinion to be in considerable tension with 
Berkshire's argument, reliant on federal securities law, that its damages should be calculated only as the difference between 
interest payments received based on actual LIBOR and interest payments received based on but-for LIBOR. See Schwab, 2018 
U.S. App. LEXIS 4519, 2018 WL 1022541, at *15 (""[T]o the extent [a plaintiff] seeks to impose liability for false LIBOR 
submissions that affected the amount of money it received on instruments it had already purchased, its claims fail. . . . 
Defendants' LIBOR submissions, possibly occurring months after [the plaintiff] purchased a particular security, bore no relation 
to that original purchase."" (emphasis omitted)). "
725,152," We also find Berkshire's reliance on Randall, 478 U.S. 647, 106 S. Ct. 3143, 92 L. Ed. 2d 525, unpersuasive for the reasons 
we have previously expressed. See supra section III.3.5.4."
725,153," Dr. Webb opines that the necessary data may be ""extracted in a systematic and comprehensive manner"" because lenders 
tend to be ""regulated financial institutions or institutional entities with appropriate bookkeeping and trade capture systems."" 
(Webb Rebuttal Report § 120.) Dr. Webb cites nothing in support of this opinion and we give it correspondingly little weight. "
727,154," Berkshire's extensive reliance on state trial court decisions also does little to reassure us of the accuracy of its state-law 
appendices, particularly when states' highest courts or intermediate appellate courts have addressed the questions at issue. Cf. 
Levin v. Tiber Holding Corp., 277 F.3d 243, 253 (2d Cir. 2002) (""[T]his Court, sitting in diversity, must follow the holdings of [a 
state's highest court] and must reject inconsistent rulings from its lower courts.""); County of Westchester v. Comm'r of 
Transp., 9 F.3d 242, 245 (2d Cir. 1993) (""[T]he highest court of a state has the final word on the meaning of state law."" (internal 
quotation marks omitted))."
727,155," Berkshire does not reference a particular holding, but we presume this statement refers either to our holding in LIBOR IV that 
""exchange-based plaintiffs were on constructive notice of news articles relating to LIBOR by May 29, 2008"" under federal law, 
LIBOR IV, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, at *431, 2015 WL 6243526, at *133 (emphasis added), or to our holding in LIBOR V 
that ""we consider [a now-dismissed Lender plaintiff] to have been on inquiry notice by May 29, 2008"" under Puerto Rico law, 
LIBOR V, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149629, at *77, 2015 WL 6696407, at *12."
727,156," Lender defendants also suggest that the extent to which states recognize class-action tolling, and the extent to which states 
recognize cross-jurisdictional tolling in particular, introduces another degree of variation under the broad umbrella of statutes of 
limitations. (Lender Defs.' Class Opp'n 27.) Because we are to apply state class-action tolling law when analyzing claims 
asserted under state law, see Casey v. Merck & Co., 653 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir. 2011), we engaged in an extensive analysis of 
cross-jurisdictional tolling in LIBOR IV, see 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 147561, at *444-45, 2015 WL 6243526, at *138-47. But cross-
jurisdictional tolling is not implicated in this context: the operative question is whether the filing of this putative class action in this "
728,," district would, under the law of the 56 jurisdictions, toll the applicable statute of limitations for each absent class member in a suit 
in this district. Therefore, class-action tolling is implicated only to the extent a state does not recognize class-action tolling at all."
728,157," Lender defendants additionally suggest that the substantive law of mitigation also differs across states, though they do not 
identify any specific conflicts. (Lender Defs.' Class Opp'n 24.) Berkshire does not respond to this contention, but suggests 
instead that mitigation is irrelevant. (Berkshire Class Reply 25 n.20.) We reject the notion that mitigation is irrelevant to the 
damages analysis and conclude that to the extent state laws in fact differ on the issue of mitigation, such variation would 
introduce a further layer of complexity into the state-by-state damages analysis."
728,158," In analyzing variations in state law, we have generally set aside the question of whether ""[d]ifferent legal standards are 
masquerading behind similar legal labels."" 18 Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 4417 (3d ed.) (Westlaw 
2017). As the Supreme Court has recognized in analyzing preclusion, courts in different jurisdictions may apply identically 
worded provisions differently, see Smith v. Bayer Corp., 564 U.S. 299, 309, 131 S. Ct. 2368, 180 L. Ed. 2d 341 (2011), and 
these differences would amplify the variations we have already identified. While this concern is somewhat alleviated in this 
context because state substantive law need not be exactly identical to permit grouping, the likelihood remains that different 
states will interpret terms that are identical or similar terms in sufficiently different ways such that grouping would be improper. "
730,159," Though it does not affect our resolution of the motions, the parties are reminded that this Court's individual rules of practice 
and Local Civil Rule 11.1(b)(3) specify the formatting to be applied to motions papers, including memoranda of law: ""all text must 
be double-spaced, except for headings, text in footnotes, or block quotations, which may be single-spaced."" Double-spaced 
means double-spaced. Not 1.9x spaced, not 1.8x spaced, and certainly not approximately 1.75x spaced as Berkshire's papers 
are."
730,160," This limitation derives from two sources: first, our holding in LIBOR III that OTC plaintiffs lack Article III standing to assert 
claims against panel banks with which they did not transact, see LIBOR III, 27 F. Supp. 3d at 482 (""[OTC] plaintiffs' [state law] 
claims against non-counterparty banks do not meet the threshold Article III standing requirements."" (citing NECA, 693 F.3d at 
159)); see also NECA, 693 F.3d at 159 (""[T]o establish Article III standing in a class action . . . for every named defendant there 
must be at least one named plaintiff who can assert a claim directly against that defendant."" (omission in original) (quoting 
Merck-Medco, 504 F.3d at 241)); and second, our holdings in LIBOR VI that a plaintiff who did not transact with a panel bank is "
731,," not an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws against that panel bank and therefore lacks antitrust standing to assert antitrust 
claims against that panel bank, see LIBOR VI, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 175929, at *52-53, 2016 WL 7378980, at *16."
731,161, No amended complaint incorporating Bucks County's claims against RBC has yet been filed.
731,162," When we allowed Bucks County's substitution, we cautioned that the withdrawal of SEIU presented ""a unique situation which 
required a departure from the Court's schedule in the interest of justice"" and expressly reserved judgment on whether Bucks 
County is an adequate representative with typical claims. Sept. 8, 2017 Order, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155700, at *99, 2017 WL 
4174925, at *1. We initially dismissed Credit Suisse without prejudice, reasoning that ""OTC plaintiffs may move to add a named 
plaintiff that transacted with Credit Suisse."" Sept. 29, 2017 Order, at *slip op. at *1. But in the intervening six months, OTC 
plaintiffs have not moved to add a named plaintiff that transacted with Credit Suisse. Thus, no named plaintiff has Article III 
standing to sue Credit Suisse, and any attempt to add such a plaintiff (or a plaintiff who transacted with any panel bank not 
currently a defendant) at this juncture of the action would be untimely and unduly prejudicial as a matter of law. Cf. Block v. First 
Blood Assocs., 988 F.2d 344, 350 (2d Cir. 1993) (""In determining what constitutes 'prejudice,' we consider whether the assertion 
of the new claim would: (i) require the opponent to expend significant additional resources to conduct discovery and prepare for 
trial; [or] (ii) significantly delay the resolution of the dispute.""). We therefore again dismiss Credit Suisse as a defendant, but with 
prejudice this time."
731,163," We held fairness hearings on both of these settlements, (Oct. 23, 2017 Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 2344 (Barclays); Jan. 23, 2018 Hr'g 
Tr., ECF No. 2427 (Citi)), and deferred consideration of final approval until our resolution of these class certification motions."
731,164," Though no longer a defendant following our personal jurisdiction rulings in LIBOR III and LIBOR VI, HSBC has also settled 
with the OTC plaintiffs. (Feb. 23, 2018 Motion, ECF No. 2442.) "
732,165," OTC defendants do not challenge Dr. Stiglitz's qualifications. We agree that he is qualified to offer the opinions presented in 
his report."
732,166," We also note, as a threshold matter, the limited relevance of Dr. Stiglitz's opinions at the class certification stage. The vast 
majority of Dr. Stiglitz's opinions consider whether the defendants could have engaged, and did engage, in collusion, with his 
opinions that the evidence necessary to prove such collusion is common and class-wide seemingly appended as an 
afterthought. As OTC plaintiffs themselves have reminded us, class certification is not an appropriate time for a full-on inquiry 
into the merits to the extent they do not overlap with Rule 23. See, e.g., In re IPO, 471 F.3d at 41-42. Nonetheless, because Dr. 
Stiglitz does opine that evidence of collusion will be common to all class members (e.g., Stiglitz Report ¶ 61), his report 
maintains some minimal relevance such that its wholesale exclusion is not warranted."
732,167," This conclusion is consistent with our holdings in the Exchange-based action, where we held that Exchange plaintiffs' experts 
Dr. Netz and Mr. Beevers may not offer opinions interpreting trader communications and other documents readily 
understandable by the trier of fact. See supra section III.1.2.1; section III.1.3.2.2. "
734,168," OTC defendants also do not contest the issue of ascertainability. Ascertainability ""requires only that a class be defined using 
objective criteria that establish a membership with definite boundaries."" In re Petrobras, 862 F.3d at 264. By setting forth specific 
transactions into which putative class members must have entered, the class definition satisfies this requirement. "
735,169," The whereas clause in question recited, in full: ""AND WHEREAS [RBC] and [Bucks County] entered into a transaction on 14 
Apr 2005 (the 'Transaction') effective 18 Apr 2005 having a Notional Amount of USD 63,120,000.00 and a Termination date of 
01 Jun 2019 such Transaction being evidenced by a Confirmation (as described in the Agreement) dated as of 14 Apr 2005."" 
(Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. D.) "
736,170," Additionally, OTC plaintiffs' argument here runs directly counter to their suggestion that their unjust-enrichment claims are 
subject to the choice-of-law provisions in the ISDA Master Agreement. Presumably, to the extent an extracontractual unjust 
enrichment claim is controlled by a contract's choice-of-law provision, it is similarly controlled by a release extinguishing claims 
arising under the same contract."
736,171," Again, we need not have so concluded in order to find that Bucks County's claims are not typical of the class's claims. See, 
e.g., In re Digital Music, 321 F.R.D. at 97-98 (""[T]he defendant need not show at the certification stage that [a] unique defense 
will prevail."" (second alteration in original) (quoting Lapin, 254 F.R.D. at 179))."
736,172," Additionally, the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement provides that the parties submit to the ""exclusive jurisdiction of the 
Courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United States District Court located in the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania"" as to ""any suit, action or proceedings relating to this Agreement."" (Poronsky Bucks County Decl. ex. B at 29.) This 
forum-selection clause would also appear to present an additional unique defense. "
737,173," RBC also correctly points out that it has never had an opportunity to assert its defenses against Bucks County. (Letter from 
Brian Poronsky to the Court, Jan. 12, 2018, ECF No. 2402.) "
740,174," Accordingly, we would reject any suggestion that the proposed class presents Article III standing issues by encompassing 
class members that were, on net, not injured by LIBOR suppression."
740,175," We previously dismissed named plaintiff Highlander Realty for lack of standing. LIBOR V, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149629, at 
*108, 2015 WL 6696407, at *22-24. At the time of that decision, no antitrust claims remained pending against any defendant as 
a result of our decision in LIBOR I; our dismissal of Highlander ""for lack of standing"" necessarily refers to Highlander's Article III 
standing. Accordingly, OTC plaintiffs' suggestion that we ""did not rule that Highlander lacked Article III standing or even address 
the issue,"" (OTC Pls.' Class Reply 15-16), is incorrect. OTC plaintiffs further suggest that this holding is ""directly contrary to 
Denney's holding that an injury offset does not negate standing"" (OTC Pls.' Class Reply 16), but this suggestion ignores the fact 
that Highlander never pleaded any injury at all: it alleged at the outset that it engaged in a single transaction under which it not 
only borrowed money from a panel bank affiliate (such that it paid interest at a LIBOR-based rate) but also eliminated any 
exposure to LIBOR through an interest-rate swap. (Highlander Compl. ¶¶ 6-7, No. 13 Civ. 2343, ECF No. 1.) Because 
Highlander failed to plead any exposure to LIBOR, it failed to plead any injury that could have been caused by LIBOR 
manipulation. "

747,185," OTC plaintiffs' reply brief, which rattled off in a footnote a series of possible modifications to the class definition (OTC Pls.'

the lessee attaches the transmitting and receiving electronic equipment that processes and passes the communications signals 
over the optical fibers. Typically, as is the case here, the lessor builds a network consisting of a large number of fibers and then

the fibers, the exclusive right to use a subset of those fibers to the lessee for the entire anticipated useful life of the fibers."

property at issue . . . is a gas pipeline system and the rights-of-way required for its placement"" constituted covenants running 
with the land including the right to transportation fees—because the traveling of natural gas along the length of the pipeline was 
for the use of the real property—and the right to consent to the assignment of the pipeline—because the rights impact the

806,1," Graphic additionally contends that the Court should deny the present Motion to Amend to Plead Punitive Damages because 
""Inline fails to present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of tortious interference with contract or prospective 
economic advantage . . . ."" (Mem. in Opp., [Docket No. 506], 2). However, ""when deciding whether punitive damages are 
available, courts do not need to examine the merits of the underlying claims or determine whether they were properly pleaded. 
Those questions are best considered in the context of dispositive motions."" See, Coy v. No Limits Education, No. 15-cv-93 
(BRT), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193954, 2016 WL 7888047, *2 (D. Minn. April 1, 2016). Therefore, the Court does not further 
address Graphic's arguments which are based upon a challenge to the sufficiency of the merits of the underlying claims in this 
case. "
810,2," Inline cites Doe YZ v. Shattuck-St. Mary's School, 214 F. Supp. 3d 763 (D. Minn. 2016), for the contradictory proposition that 
""because 'a corporation is charged with constructive knowledge of all material facts of which its officer or agent acquires 
knowledge while acting in the course of employment within the scope of his or her authority,' knowledge on the part of those with "
811,," managerial capacity will be imputed to the corporation."" (Mem. in Supp., [Docket No. 381], 6). However, Doe YZ went on to point 
out the statutory language in Minn. Stat. § 549.20, subd. 2(c), set forth above—which controls on questions of punitive damages 
under that statute—and it ultimately held that although the knowledge of employees who are not ""managerial employees vested 
with authority to make policy and planning level decisions . . . is imputable to [the principal] for negligence purposes, it is not 
imputable to [the principal] for assessing punitive liability."" 214 F. Supp. 3d at 792-93. Therefore, contrary to Inline's assertion, 
the general principles of principal/agent liability do not expand the definitions set forth in Minn. Stat. § 549.20, subd. 2. Inline also 
argues that it ""need not show managerial capacity for vicarious liability under § 549.20, subd. 2, but nevertheless does so 
herein."" (Mem. in Supp., [Docket No. 381], 6). In support, Inline cites  [*17] Nunn v. Noodles & Co., No. 9-cv-1286 (JNE/JJK), 
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 91544, 2010 WL 3170763, *8 n.1 (D. Minn. Aug. 6, 2010), which stated in dicta that the determination 
whether Plaintiff satisfied the required elements for vicarious liability for punitive damages was not required at the the pleading 
stage when plaintiff sought to amend her complaint to plead punitive damages. Rather, Nunn held that such a determination was 
more properly made in a summary judgment motion or at trial. Id. Nunn concluded, however that there was prima facie evidence 
that supported a finding of vicarious liability for punitive damages under Minn. Stat. § 549.20, subd. 2. Id. The portion of Nunn 
relied on by Inline is dicta and is not binding on this Court in any event, especially in light of the much more recent ruling in Doe 
YZ, which addressed the sufficiency of evidence to support vicarious liability on punitive damages in the context of a motion to 
amend the complaint such as the one presently before the Court. See, 214 F. Supp. 3d at 791-93. "
814,3," The section of this Order which sets forth the Court's analysis of the merits of the Motion to Amend to Plead Punitive Damages 
presently before the Court also includes, at times, Inline's citations to the expert reports when necessary to set forth alleged facts 
which are required to understand Inline's arguments. For example, as ""evidence"" of the relationship between the various patent "
815,," applications and issued patents involved in the present litigation, Inline cites only to a portion of the expert report that 
summarizes the evidence from the record which was available to the author of that expert report; Inline does not indicate to the 
Court where in the submissions currently before it that same information is to be found; if at all. (See, Mem. in Supp., [Docket 
No. 381], 33 citing Kroll Dec., Exh. 81, [Docket No. 463], 19-62; Exh. 82, [Docket No. 464], 12-21). However, because those 
patent applications and issued patents are referenced as well in evidence which is properly before the Court in the context of the 
present Motion to Amend to Plead Punitive Damages, the Court has considered the facts alleged therein, not for their value in 
determining whether Inline has made a prima facie showing of entitlement to punitive damages, but merely as necessary to 
understand the facts underlying the present litigation. "
817,4," Inline refers to this as the ""Joint Development Agreement,"" or the ""JDA."" (See, Mem. in Supp., [Docket No. 381], 29). "
819,5," See, fn. 4, supra. "
821,6," Inline merely cites generally to Expert Kowalchyk's explanation and summary of the process by which ""Graphic applied for 
multiple patents from 2005 to 2013 that incorporate and claim the three major categories of concepts and ideas Brower and 
others at Nestle provided under Projects Quantum and Roxanne and the JDA."" (Mem. in Supp., [Docket No. 381], 33, citing 
generally to ""Exh. 81, ¶¶ 37-99; Exh. 82, ¶¶ 27-61). Similarly, Inline cites only to its Expert Report and Rebuttal Report as the 
support for the following paragraph: Someone at Graphic . . . created invention disclosures on the Hot Pocket designs that incorporate the drawings made 
pursuant to Brower's instructions and claim Brower's contributions. Someone also revised the disclosures after Brower's 
September 30, 2005, email, so that one of the disclosures specifically referenced the new Drawing 51616G. But Fitzwater 
is the only person identified as the inventor in all of the disclosures. Fitzwater signed the disclosures and submitted them for 
patenting. (Mem. in Supp., [Docket No. 381], 32-33). Inline also cites only to the Expert Report and Rebuttal Report for the following 
assertions: (1) ""Graphic applied for an entire family of patents (the ""Invalid Patents"") that were all premised on Nestlé's 
contributions""; (2) ""Although the Invalid Patents claim concepts provided by Brower, on behalf of Nestle, none of the applications 
or patents list him or anyone else at Nestle as an inventor""; (3) ""But because Brower and others came up with the patentable 
concepts, the law required that they receive attribution. Since the patents do not list them as at least co-inventors and instead 
incorrectly list Fitzwater as the sole inventor, the patents are invalid."" (See, Mem. in Supp., [Docket No. 381], 33). Because it is 
improper to consider an expert's characterization of facts or conclusory statements as evidence relevant to a plaintiff's burden to 
show a prima facie case for punitive damages in order to succeed on a motion to amend a complaint to add punitive damages, 
the Court, as already explained above, does not consider this as evidence. In light of its ability to consider the record as a whole, 
however, the Court may consider as general background that Inline intends to argue that the patents which Graphic asserted in 
its conversations with Nestle and in its patent litigation against Inline are invalid because Fitzwater is allegedly listed as the only 
inventor when Inline asserts that this is untrue."
821,7," On May 25, 2007, Biddle authored an email regarding a patent (unrelated to the patents currently at issue in this litigation) on 
which a third-party was claiming he should be listed as an inventor. (Kroll Dec., Exh. 108, [Docket No. 489], 2-3). In that email, 
Biddle states that he reviewed a patent application ""as well as the development documents that have been forwarded to me by 
the listed inventors and I have had several conversations with GPI [Graphic] personnel that were involved in the development of 
the product."" (Id.). The email continues on to communicate Biddle's thoughts on the validity of the third-party's claim to 
inventorship. (Id.). Inline cites this singular example in support of its broad assertion that ""Biddle historically investigated 
inventorship issues relating to collaborative work between Graphic and other partners that involved less substantive concepts."" 
(See, Mem. in Supp., [Docket No. 381], 37). "
822,8," The deposition excerpt provided by Inline does not provide context as to what, exactly, Biddle or Inline were referring to that 
Biddle could have performed due diligence in regard to. (See, Kroll Dec., Exh. 33, [Docket No. 415], 21). "
823,9," In their respective Memoranda in support of and in opposition to the present Motion to Amend to Plead Punitive Damages, both 
Inline and Graphic argue the ultimate merits of the underlying claims in this suit. Graphic does so extensively, as it argues that 
Inline ""fails to establish a prima facie case of tortious interference with contractual relationship,"" that ""Inline has failed to present 
a prima facie case . . . that Graphic's assertion of its patent rights was wrongful or unlawful,"" and that ""Inline does not offer 
evidence of any specific intent to deceive the [United States Patent and Trademark Office."" (Mem. in Opp., [Docket No. 506], 14, 
22, 39). None of this is relevant to the present Motion to Amend to Plead Punitive Damages. See, Coy v. No Limits Education, 
No. 15-cv-93 (BRT), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 193954, 2016 WL 7888047, *2 (D. Minn. April 1, 2016) (""[W]hen deciding whether 
punitive damages are available, courts do not need to examine the merits of the underlying claims or determine whether they 
were properly pleaded. Those questions are best considered in the context of dispositive motions.""). Therefore, the arguments of 
both parties which go to the merits of the underlying claims are not addressed in this Order. "

Thereafter the first filers withdrew their request for lead plaintiff/counsel designation, and Mr. Fuller and his lawyers were 
ultimately designated as lead plaintiff and counsel. See ECF No. 24 (granting George James Fuller's unopposed Motion for

plaintiff Fuller obviously could not have factored that decision into the allegations of his securities law complaint. In any event, "
850,," that case does not change my analysis of plaintiff's complaint. He must do more than piggyback on allegations in the antitrust 
case if he wishes to prosecute a securities suit. This is not to say that a compliant complaint could not be drafted when more 
facts become known. "

express written agreements. As already discussed by the Court, whether MHC's causes of action may be maintained through de 
facto agreements and whether MHC adequately pleaded such agreements are two separate questions. The Court relies on 
LePage in deciding only the former question. "

(citation omitted). In light of Complainant's representations to the Commission on review that it would not plead or prove antitrust 
injury, the IA ultimately took the position that no remand was necessary. See, e.g., Transcript of Oral Argument (as corrected on

892,6," President Carter disapproved the Commission's issuance of remedial orders on policy grounds. See Steel Pipe, 43 Fed. Reg. 
17789 (Apr. 26, 1978). "
893,7," Counsel for both Complainant and Respondents described the legislative history for section 337 on this issue as ""sparse."" Tr. 
at 48 (Mr. Glass), 130 (Ms. Aranoff); see also Office of Unfair Import Investigations' Jan. 17, 2017 Br. at 11 (EDIS Doc. No. 
601084) (noting that legislative history ""does not shed much light"" on the issue)."
893,8," The Commission has considered section 337 in the context of antitrust allegations. The Commission has issued opinions in 
several cases. See, e.g., Watches, Watch Movements, and Watch Parts, Inv. No. 337-19, TC Pub. 177 (June 1966); Tractor 
Parts, Inv. No. 337-22, TC Pub. 443 (June 1971); Electronic Audio and Related Equipment, Inv. No. 337-TA-7, USITC Pub. 768 
(Apr. 1976); Chicory Root-Crude and Prepared, Inv. No. 337-TA-27, 1977 WL 52340 (Mar. 30, 1977); Steel Pipe, 1978 ITC 
LEXIS 63, 1978 WL 50692 (Feb. 22, 1978); Certain Airtight Cast-Iron Stoves, Inv. No. 337-TA-69, USITC Pub. 1126, 1981 ITC 
LEXIS 228 (Jan. 1981); Certain Electrically Resistive Monocomponent Toner, Inv. No. 337-TA-253, USITC Pub. 2069, 1988 ITC 
LEXIS 14 (Mar. 1988). The Commission has also declined to review (thereby adopting) ALJ decisions. See, e.g., Certain Rare-
Earth Magnets and Magnetic Materials and Articles Containing Same, Inv. No. 337-TA-413, USITC Pub. 3307, 2000 ITC LEXIS 
490 (May 2000). At least three investigations were terminated pursuant to a consent order or settlement agreements between 
the parties. Angolan Robusta Coffee, Inv. No. 337-TA-16, 41 Fed. Reg. 13418 (Mar. 30, 1976); Color Television Receiving Sets, 
Inv. No. 337-TA-23, 42 Fed. Reg. 39492 (Aug. 4, 1977); Certain Precision Resistor Chips, Inv. No. 337-TA-63, 45 Fed. Reg. 
16360 (Mar. 13, 1980). A finding of violation on an antitrust claim was made in one investigation and the recommended remedy 
was rejected by the President. Steel Pipe, Inv. No. 337-TA-29, 43 Fed. Reg. 17789 (Apr. 26, 1978). A violation finding was made 
in a second case but was rescinded upon reconsideration. Tractor Paris, Inv. No. 337-22, 36 Fed. Reg. 15077 (Aug. 12, 1971). "
894,9," 19 U.S.C. § 1337(a)(1)(B) expressly identifies the importation of ""articles that . . . infringe"" a valid U.S. patent as an unlawful 
act. This provision was added to section 337 in 1988. Prior to 1988, patent infringement was addressed under the general 
""[u]nfair methods of competition [or] unfair acts"" language of the statute. "
895,10," The only other Commission investigation in which antitrust injury doctrine was addressed was Certain Electrically Resistive 
Monocomponent Toner, Inv. No. 337-TA-253, USITC Pub. 2069, 1988 ITC LEXIS 14 (Mar. 1988). In that case, the Commission 
found no section 337 violation based on an antitrust claim. Writing separately, two Commissioners suggested the doctrine's 
applicability under section 337 but did not decide whether the requirement was met on the record presented. See id., Additional 
Views of Vice Chairman Anne E. Brunsdale and Commissioner Ronald A. Cass at 16, 1988 ITC LEXIS 14 at *48 (""A second 
concern [with the final ID] is the possible absence of the sort of antitrust injury necessary to support an action under the antitrust 
laws.""). The Commission views did not address this point -- for, against, or otherwise -- under the circumstances. Complainant contends that the Commission implicitly decided that antitrust injury does not apply to section 337 when it found a 
violation of section 337 in the 1978 Steel Pipe investigation without mentioning antitrust injury. U.S. Steel's Jan. 17, 2017 Br. at 
15 (EDIS Doc. No. 601088). This reading of the Steel Pipe decision strikes us as unreasonable. The Commission did not 
address antitrust injury in Steel Pipe, and there is no indication that the issue was even raised, which is not surprising given that 
the doctrine was still developing. The Supreme Court's Brunswick decision was handed down before Steel Pipe but Brunswick 
itself did not decide whether antitrust injury applied in district court to claims for injunctive relief (as opposed to damages actions) 
or to other substantive theories of antitrust violation. Brunswick Corp. v Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 
L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977). Subsequent decisions confirmed its importance to damages claims irrespective of the theory of liability. 
See, e.g., J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 101 S. Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981) (Robinson-
Patman Act); Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982) (Sherman Act); 
Associated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 
2d 723 (1983) (Sherman Act). However, the Court did not address until nine years later whether the antitrust injury requirement 
applied in a district court action seeking injunctive relief. Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 109-10, 107 S. Ct. 
484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986). ARCO in 1990 subsequently held that the antitrust injury requirement applied to per se violations 
of the Sherman Act. ARCO, 495 U.S. at 341-45. We are unpersuaded that the Commission's 1978 Steel Pipe decision, by not 
addressing antitrust injury, ruled on the issue before us. "
896,11," A private plaintiff can seek an injunction under section 16 of the Clayton Act ""against threatened loss or damage by a violation 
of the antitrust laws."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. Antitrust injury is required in a private action seeking injunctive relief under section 16 of 
the Clayton Act. See Cargill, 479 U.S. at 116-18. "
897,12," The Supreme Court also noted that ""[t]he need for . . . showing [antitrust injury] is at least as great"" in the context of per se 
violations. ARCO, 495 U.S. at 344. The Supreme Court explained that ""insofar as the per se rule permits the prohibition of 
efficient practices in the name of simplicity, the need for the antitrust injury requirement is underscored."" Id. "
898,13," On review, Complainant argues that under subsection (iii), ""U.S. Steel must prove that the unfair act threatens to restrain or 
actually restrains U.S. Steel's trade or commerce."" U.S. Steel's Jan. 17, 2017 Br. at 24 (EDIS Doc. No. 601088). In other words, 
U.S. Steel reads the restraint of trade and commerce in the United States to refer to the restraint of U.S. Steel's trade or 
commerce. But the plain language of subsection (iii) does not support this interpretation. It says nothing about injury either to a 
domestic industry or to a specific domestic company. The language of subsection (iii), which echoes that of the Sherman Act, 
further conveys an intention to protect competition and not simply competitors. See Steel Pipe, 1978 ITC LEXIS 63, 1978 WL 
50692, *17. More generally, we note the arguments in the parties' briefs and oral presentations on whether investigations based on the 
Sherman Act must be brought under subsection (iii), rather than subsections (i) or (ii), of section 337(a)(1)(A). Because we 
ground our decision in the meaning of ""unfair methods of competition and unfair acts"" in section 337(a)(1)(A), rather than the 
subsections thereof, we find it unnecessary to reach this question and therefore express no opinion on it."
898,14, We do not here address the standards that would apply in a self-initiated investigation.
898,15," We note that under Rule 210.50 (b)(1) the Commission may order the presiding ALJ to take evidence with respect to the 
public interest factors during the violation phase of a 337 investigation. See 19 C.F.R. § 210.50(b)(1). When the Commission has 
ordered the presiding ALJ to take evidence with respect to the public interest factors, the ALJ must issue a recommended 
determination containing findings of fact concerning the public interest. See 19 C.F.R. § 210.42(a)(1)(ii)(C). "
899,16," See Act of July 2, 1890, ch. 647, § 7, 26 Stat. 210 (repealed 1955). "
900,17," U.S. Steel's claim that is has been harmed by a conspiracy to fix prices and control output and export volumes in violation of 
the Sherman Act is tied to underpricing by Chinese-produced carbon and alloy steel and to the impact it has had on U.S. Steel's 
trade, production, and financial performance. Amended Complaint ¶¶ 71-99, 223-241. The relevant antitrust injury U.S. Steel 
would need to allege and show is predatory pricing, as described above. See, e.g., Brooke, 509 U.S. at 222-26; ARCO, 495 U.S. 
337-41; Energy Conversion Devices Liquidation Trust v. Trina Solar Ltd., 833 F.3d 680, 688-91 (6th Cir. 2016). U.S. Steel does 
not appear to contest this point, and in any event, represents that it will not amend its complaint to plead or prove antitrust injury. 
See, e.g., Tr. at 42, 68-69 (Mr. Glass); U.S. Steel Feb. 1, 2017 Resp. Br. at 21. We do not opine on the form of antitrust injury 
that might be required if other types of claims are asserted under the antitrust laws."
900,18," Consistent with the recent Commission Opinion relating to Complainant's false designation of origin claim, ""we agree with the 
ID that the Commission's decision to institute an investigation does not preclude an ALJ from reexamining the sufficiency of a 
complaint,"" but ""we do not adopt the ID's discussion of the ALJ's authority under the APA in the context of Commission Rules 
210.21(a) and 210.18."" See Certain Carbon and Alloy Steel Products, Inv. No. 337-TA-1002, Comm'n Op. at 7 (Mar. 6, 2017) 
(citations omitted). "
902,1," Specifically, the ID found that ""[a]ntitrust injury requires that the plaintiff be 'adversely affected by an anticompetitive aspect of 
the defendant's conduct,"" and that the context of pricing practices challenged by rivals as depressing their profits, 'only predatory 
pricing has the requisite anticompetitive effect.'"" Id. at 20-21 (citing Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 339, 
110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (""ARCO"") (emphasis in original)). ""To prove predatory pricing."" the ID continued, ""a 
plaintiff must show that (1) the defendant's prices are below its costs and (2) there is a 'dangerous probability' that the 
defendants will 'recoup' their investment in 'below-cost prices' once they have succeeded in forcing competitors from the 
market."" Id. at 22 (citing Brooke Group, Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 222-25, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 
L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993)). "
904,2," As discussed in Tianrui, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals later held in In re Amtorg that the use and sale of a product 
made by a patented process did not constitute infringement of a process patent because section 337 did not enlarge the 
substantive scope of U.S. patent law. Tianrui, 661 F.3d at 1333-34 (citing In re Amtorg Trading Corp., 75 F.2d 826, 22 C.C.P.A. 
558, T.D. 47583 (C.C.P.A. 1935)). The Amtorg decision had the effect of reversing Frischer, Orion, and Northern Pigment only 
with respect to infringement of the process patents involved therein. However, the Tianrui Court noted that ""[t]o the extent 
Amtorg construed the scope of the Commission's jurisdiction over unfair methods of competition, Congress has subsequently 
rejected that construction in response to criticism by the Tariff Commission. . . . Amtorg thus has no effect on the scope of the 
Commission's authority to regulate trade secret misappropriation relating to the production of goods imported into this country.""

906,3," USTR, 2018 Trade Policy Agenda and 2017 Annual Report of the President of the United States on the Trade Agreements 
Program, at 4 (March 2018)."
906,4," U.S. Steel explained at the hearing that in this state sponsored industry, where ""costs can be zero,"" it is difficult if not 
impossible for ""an American company to prove that they are pricing below zero and it may be negative"" and therefore no 
member of the U.S. steel industry, the United Steelworkers, or consumers could have standing to challenge these unfair 
practices. Oral Arg. Tr. at 241-43."
906,5," To be sure, Section 337 expressly provides for the Commission's consideration of public interest concerns, including the public 
health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United States economy, production of like or directly competitive articles in the 
United States and U.S. consumers, after a violation is found in the context of the Commission's determination of an appropriate 
remedy to prevent further unfair acts in connection with subject imports. 19 U.S.C. § 1337(d), (f), (g). However, the statutory 
scheme shows that these public interest considerations do not play a role in the determination of the elements of ""unfair 
methods of competition and unfair acts"" underlying a violation of Section 337(a)(1)(A). Moreover, the statutory framework 
provides that policy considerations relating to Commission action in Section 337 investigations are within the province of the 
President. 19 U.S.C. § 1337(j)(2). "
907,6," The definition of ""antitrust laws"" appears in 15 U.S.C. § 12(a), and does not include Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended. "
908,7," The ID notes that the alleged horizontal price-fixing among competitors is per se illegal under section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
See ID at 26 (""For the purpose of deciding this motion, I assume that the Socony-Vacuum per se rule is in effect and that the 
conduct alleged in the complaint constitutes an unreasonable restraint of trade that would be actionable under section 337 if "
909,," U.S. Steel could demonstrate standing.""); see also Socony-Vacuum, 310 U.S. at 223 (""Under the Sherman Act a combination 
formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in 
interstate or foreign commerce is illegal per se."")."
909,8," Respondents have likewise failed to cite any Commission precedent construing the scope of ""unfair methods of competition 
and unfair acts"" of Section 337(a)(1)(A) to mandate engrafting the injury language of Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act onto 
this statutory term as a matter of law. In their opening brief on review of the ID, Respondents mention only one Commission 
decision that was issued after the Supreme Court's decisions in Brunswick and Cargill in which the Court construed the injury 
language of Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act. See, e.g., Respondent's Opening Br. on Review of Order 38 Terminating 
Complainant's Antitrust Claim, at 21-23 (Jan. 17, 2016) (""Resp. Opening Br."") (noting the Commission's only decision post-
Cargill is Electrically Resistive Monocomponent Toner, 0088 WL 1572171, where the Commission ""resolved the investigation in 
the respondents' favor without addressing antitrust injury"" and two Commissioners provided additional views in which they raise 
a concern that the ID did not address the issue of antitrust injury). The Views of the Commission in the Toner investigation, 
however, did not address this point. In their reply submission, Respondents note that ""[i]n the context of an affirmative defense, 
one ALJ has recognized that a party must demonstrate antitrust injury to prove a violation of the Sherman Act."" Respondents' 
Response on Review of Order 38 Terminating Complainant's Antitrust Claim, at 9 n.1 (Feb. 1, 2017) (Resp. Reply Br."") (citing 
Certain Rare-Earth Magnets and Magnetic Materials and Articles Containing the Same, Inv. No. 337-TA-413, Final ID, 
1999 ITC LEXIS 342, 1999 WL 961281, at *67, 69 (Sept. 8, 1999) (""Certain Rare Earth Magnets"")). The record of the Magnets 
case, however, shows that the ALJ misunderstood the respondents' equitable defense. At closing argument, in response to the 
ALJ's questions, counsel for the NEOCO respondents tried to clear up the AU's misconception of their affirmative defense 
stating that ""this is not a case in which NEOCO has affirmatively asserted, either privately, through an Attorney General or the 
Department of Justice, that they have suffered an antitrust injury such that they would be entitled to prevail under the antitrust 
laws. This is the context of antitrust and patent misuse being asserted as an affirmative defense, which, as a principle of equity, 
should prohibit this court from enforcing the rights of the Complainants."" Closing Arg. Tr. at 2183 (July 27, 1999) (EDIS Doc. No. 
49537). The NEOCO Respondents' attempt to clarify their equitable defense was not successful, inasmuch as the ALT 
mistakenly treated it as an antitrust counterclaim, finding that NEOCO had not established a Section 1 Sherman Act violation 
(see Certain Rare-Earth Magnets, 1999 ITC LEXIS 342, 1999 WL 961281, at *69), contrary to the mandatory removal "
910,," provision applicable to counterclaims under 19 U.S.C. § 1337(c). No party petitioned for review of these errors, and the 
Commission did not address them in its notice of non-review. See Comm'n Notice (Oct. 25, 1999)."
910,9," The Lexmark Court clarified that ""[they] have on occasion referred to this inquiry as 'statutory standing' and treated it as 
effectively jurisdictional."" Lexmark, 134 S. Ct. at 1387 n.4 (citations omitted). But while ""[the statutory standing] label is an 
improvement over the language of 'prudential standing,' since it correctly places the focus on the statute . . . it, too, is misleading, 
since 'the absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction. . . . '"" Id. 
(citations omitted)."
910,10," Because antitrust injury standing is a separate requirement that is distinct from the substantive ""unfair methods of competition 
and unfair acts"" itself, neither Tianrui nor Young Engineers would mandate reading ""antitrust injury"" into the substantive violation 
under section 337(a)(1)(A) as the ID finds. "
911,11," ""'Standing to sue is a doctrine rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or controversy' required by Article III. [T]he 
irreducible constitutional minimum of standing' consists of 'three elements.' An appellant 'must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, 
(2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the [appellee], (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial 
decision.'"" Phigenix, Inc. v. Immunogen Inc., 845 F.3d 1168, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct.

911,12," Antitrust injury and antitrust standing are closely related but not identical. ""[A]ntitrust injury [is] a 'necessary, but not always 
sufficient,' component of antitrust standing."" CBC Cos., Inc. v. Equifax, Inc., 561 F.3d 569, 571 (6th Cir. 2009) (quoting Cargill,

injury is a necessary but insufficient condition of antitrust standing."") (citation omitted)."
911,13," On appeal before a federal court, however, a party seeking review of an agency's final action must always supply the requisite 
proof of the ""injury-in-fact"" to establish standing, but other requirements of standing, including immediacy and redressability, may 
be relaxed. See Phigenix, 845 F.3d at 1171, 1172 n.2."
911,14," No party has argued, nor does the ID hold, that U.S. Steel's antitrust claim under Section 337(a)(1)(A) must be brought under 
Section 4 or 16 of the Clayton Act. See, e.g., Oral Arg. Tr. at 47-48 (noting that Clayton Act does not apply to U.S. Steel's 
complaint); Id. at 119 (agreeing that U.S. Steel's substantive claim that the antitrust laws have been violated is a Sherman Act 
claim, not Section 4 or 16 of the Clayton Act). Nor has any party argued that there is any textual basis in Sherman Act Section 1 
for requiring antitrust injury. See, e.g., Oral Arg. Tr. at 47 (noting that no party has made any argument that there is a textual 
basis in Section 1 of the Sherman Act for antitrust injury)."
911,15," Respondents acknowledge important distinctions regarding the treatment of imports in Section 337 investigations compared to 
district court actions that pertain to a Sherman Act antitrust claim. Namely, Section 337 ""creates a different potential remedy"" "
912,," and in district court ""you would have to get personal jurisdiction over the parties, as well, which may not be possible"" whereas in 
the ITC there is in rem jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction is not required. While these would not ""create a new sort of cause of 
action in a new substantive area of law, ... what it does do is create a different way of getting at a violation that might be more 
attractive in certain circumstances than going into district court."" Oral Arg. Tr. at 166. A further distinction, as noted at the oral 
argument, is that a government attorney from the USITC Office of Unfair Import Investigations participates in the investigation as 
a neutral third party to assist the AU and the Commission to fully develop the record, including serving discovery, filing motions, 
appearing at trial, questioning witnesses, and filing briefs before the AU and the Commission. Id. at 194."
912,16," I find unpersuasive respondents' policy argument that antitrust injury required by Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act should 
be adopted for the same reasons that in patent-based investigations, the Commission, as a policy matter, looks to fedeial law 
regarding patent standing to determine patent ownership required by Commission Rule 210.12(a)(7). Resp. Opening Br. at 9 
(citing Certain Catalyst Components and Catalysts for the Polymerization of Olefins, Inv. No. 337-TA-307, Views of the 
Commission, 1990 WL 710614, at *15) (June 7, 1990) (""Catalyst Components""). In Catalyst Components, the Commission noted 
that its Rules of Practice and Procedure require that every intellectual property complaint must show that at least one 
complainant is the owner or exclusive licensee of the subject property and determined that there was no reason for the 
Commission to interpret this rule in a way contrary to judicial precedent governing patent ownership. See 1990 WL 710614, at 
*14. The Federal Circuit has approved the Commission's practice of reading federal patent standing requirements into this rule. 
See SiRF Tech., Inc. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n, 601 F.3d 1319, 1326 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Respondents, however, fail to cite any 
Commission procedural rule governing complaint requirements for Sherman Act Section 1 antitrust claims that would require the 
Commission to read into such rule the antitrust injury requirement of the Clayton Act Sections 4 and 16. See Resp. Opening Br. 
at 9-10. Moreover, respondents have failed to cite any unfair act investigations in which the Commission was required to, or 
chose to, adopt the same standing requirements as in federal district courts, apart from the Commission's interpretation of its 
own procedural rule in the patent context. See Resp. Opening Br. at 9-10; Oral Arg. Tr. at 117-18. "
914,1," Defendants Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (""DMAS"") and Dr. Tonya Parris-Wilkins, DDS (""Parris-Wilkins"")

914,3," Defendant Dentaquest is the successor of Doral Dental USA, LLC, which is the party with whom Plaintiff originally entered into 
an agreement. Defendant Dentaquest is not a party to the motions presently before the Court. "
915,4," Plaintiff's asserted cause of action in the fifth count of the Complaint indicates that Plaintiff's contract with Defendant 
Dentaquest was ""terminable at will."" (Compl. 31.) "
920,5," As evidence of the communication amongst the Defendants with regard to Plaintiff's termination, Plaintiff attaches Exhibit T. 
(""Ex. T,"" ECF No. 1-23.) This exhibit shows that Defendant Dickinson was in an email thread in which he was informed of 
Plaintiff's impending termination; however, the thread does not show him advising, encouraging, agreeing or otherwise ordering "
921,," that the termination occur. Additionally, another email in the thread from a DMAS official reveals that Plaintiff was terminated due 
to concern that Plaintiff presented a ""liability given his staffing situation, [and] 17 complaints in 5 years."" (Ex. T at 5.) In 
accordance with the exhibit-prevails rule, it is likely that this statement can be relied on for its truth to the detriment of any 
contrary allegations in the Complaint. See Goines, 822 F.3d at 166-67. That said, given the clear deficiencies of Plaintiff's 
Sherman Act claims, the Court need not rely on this statement in its analysis. "
925,1," Federal law generally does not permit defendants to raise the ""pass on"" defense. Hanover Shoe v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 
392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968)."
925,2," This caveat was required because the parties did not brief the law of the numerous states at issue in the case. In re Niaspan

government entities other than cities, towns or municipalities with self-funded drug plans."" Doc. No. 46, ¶ 148. The VA is thus not 
an absent member of the putative EPP class. Defendants also dispute whether UMPC is a member of the putative EPP class, 
but the Court concludes that it is not necessary to reach that issue at this time. "
946,5," Because The Regents was dismissed from this action, the motion is no longer pending."
946,6," In his reply, Defendant states Plaintiff does not address the state action doctrine argument and offers no reply to Plaintiff's 
arguments. "
952,1, This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1337 and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.
952,2," The Second Amended Complaint states the Berardi Defendants own Berardi Productions, a video production company. Berardi 
Productions has an exclusive agreement to produce television and online advertisements for National Express's Xhose product. "
953,3," The Second Amended Complaint further alleges that, on August 3, 2012, the Patent Office issued an Office Action with regard 
to the applications for what eventually issued as the '941 and '942 patents. The Second Amended Complaint pleads: The Office Actions demonstrate[d] that the patent examiner (1) rejected a subset of pending claims as anticipated by the 
'527 patent, (2) rejected various subsets of pending claims as obvious in light of the '527 patent, and (3) rejected various 
subsets of pending claims as obvious in light of a combination of the '527 patent and other references. "
955,4," In Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to File Reply, Plaintiffs request the Court ignore Defendants' supplemental briefing, arguing that it 
""amounts to re-argument of the issues already briefed and decided"" and ""is improper in the absence of a Motion for 
Reconsideration."" The Court notes that the supplemental briefing contains arguments that might have been more appropriate for 
a motion for reconsideration, considering that the Court determined in its February 7, 2018 Opinion the personal jurisdiction 
issue and was merely asking for briefing on how to proceed. However, given that the arguments do not change this Court's 
analysis, and given the unique question this Court presented the parties with for supplemental briefing, the Court finds it proper 
to address Defendants' concerns here. Plaintiffs also ask for the opportunity to oppose Defendants' supplemental briefing if the Court chooses to consider it. Given that 
the Court is not persuaded by Defendants' briefing, the Court denies that request."
955,5," Local Civil Rule 11.2 requires, in pertinent part, as follows: ""The initial pleading . . . in any case in this Court . . . shall be 
accompanied by a certification . . . as to whether the matter in controversy is the subject of any other action pending in any court 
. . . and, if so, the certification . . . shall identify each such action . . . ."" "
956,6," The Court similarly considered whether the Southern District of Florida's implicit conclusion that venue was proper in the 
District of New Jersey was clear error. The Court found sufficient allegations in the Second Amended Complaint regarding 
""events or omissions giving rise to the claim"" occurring in New Jersey that it could not conclude the Southern District of Florida's 
implicit decision that venue was proper constituted clear error. The Court focused on the conspiracy to monopolize count, as that is what allows this case to proceed in federal court. The Court 
thus considered the nature of the dispute to be a conspiracy to monopolize or an attempt to monopolize. As noted above, at 
least one lawsuit was brought by Mr. Berardi in the State of New Jersey, which is part of Plaintiffs' monopolization claim. While 
there were other significant events occurring in the State of Florida as well, the Court found there were enough contacts in New "
957,," Jersey that prevented this Court from concluding that it was clear error to determine venue was proper in the District of New 
Jersey. This Court stands by that ruling."
957,7," The parties in their briefing largely apply Third Circuit law in addressing antitrust standing and conspiracy and attempt to 
monopolize. "
959,8," This Court questions whether the relevant product market pleaded in the Second Amended Complaint is defined too narrowly. 
""The test for a relevant market is not commodities reasonably interchangeable by a particular plaintiff, but 'commodities 
reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes.'"" Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 438 (quoting E.I. Du Pont de 
Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. at 395). ""A court making a relevant market determination looks not to the contractual restraints 
assumed by a particular plaintiff when determining whether a product is interchangeable, but to the uses to which the product is 
put by consumers in general."" Id. (""Interchangeability implies that one product is roughly equivalent to another for the use to 
which it is put; while there may be some degree of preference for the one over the other, either would work effectively. A person 
needing transportation to work could accordingly buy a Ford or a Chevrolet automobile, or could elect to ride a horse or bicycle, 
assuming those options were feasible."" (quoting Allen-Myland, Inc, 33 F.3d at 206)). ""The key test for determining whether one 
product is a substitute for another is whether there is a cross-elasticity of demand between them: in other words, whether the 
demand for the second good would respond to changes in the price of the first."" Allen-Myland, 33 F.3d at 206. Plaintiffs' have not 
pleaded or explained why a regular, non-expandable hose, is not included in the relevant product market. "
961,9," Other courts have found similarly. In [Handgards, Inc. v. Ethicon, Inc., 601 F.2d 986 (9th Cir. 1979)] and [Novo Nordisk of N. Am., Inc. v. Genentech, Inc., 885 
F. Supp. 522 (S.D.N.Y. 1995)], the courts held that the enforcement of a patent obtained by fraud may constitute a violation 
of the Sherman Act, provided the other elements of a claim [**30]  are established. This Court reads these cases as conferring antitrust standing upon those who sufficiently plead an antitrust injury based 
upon the prosecution of a fraudulently obtained patent. Amgen, Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., 480 F. Supp. 2d 462, 469 (D. Mass. 2007) (citations omitted)."
961,10," Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint also highlights information disseminated into the marketplace which allegedly ""evinces 
the anticompetitive nature of the fraudulently obtained patents,"" which the Court finds circumstantial evidence of intent. "
962,11," As stated above, the Court applies Federal Circuit law to the fraud prong and Third Circuit law to the monopolization prong. "
964,12," Alternatively, Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint brings a claim for attempt to monopolize, which this Court also addresses 
below. "
965,13," The Southern District of Florida found the initial complaint did not allege a plausible conspiracy claim ""because Plaintiffs have 
not alleged sufficient facts showing an 'anticompetitive effect' in the relevant market."" The court found only ""conclusory 
allegation[s] that competition ha[d] been harmed."" However, this decision was reached by a court in the Eleventh Circuit, which 
applies the following test: (1) an agreement to restrain trade, (2) deliberately entered into with the specific intent of achieving a 
monopoly rather than a legitimate business purpose, (3) which could have had an anticompetitive effect, and (4) the commission 
of at least one overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. As stated above, the Court applies its own Circuit's interpretation of the 
governing law. The Southern District of Florida did, however, find ""Plaintiffs ha[d] sufficiently alleged an agreement to conspire, overt acts, and 
Defendants' intent,"" as this Court finds here. "
966,14," The Southern District of Florida found Plaintiffs did not allege harm to competition sufficiently: ""Here, Plaintiffs allege harm to 
themselves by having to defend against allegedly baseless infringement suits, but there are no factual allegations addressing 
how this conduct has harmed competition in the market or could lead to monopolization of the market."" The Court further found 
Plaintiffs ""failed to allege sufficient facts to demonstrate a dangerous probability that Defendants might have succeeded in their 
attempt to achieve monopoly power."" "
967,15," Alternatively, Plaintiffs request that the Court dismiss the cause of action without prejudice, arguing that ""[t]he causes of action 
listed necessarily involve secrecy and intent to deceive, and therefore finding specific facts of such causes of action has proven 
difficult."""
967,16," This Court's conclusions differed from the Southern District of Florida's in many respects due to the different law being applied. 
While the parties are expected to apply and understand how Third Circuit law applies to these facts, the unique procedural 
posture of this case could have left Plaintiffs unaware of the importance of re-pleading certain elements of their claims such that 
allowing leave to amend is appropriate."
967,17," In the event Plaintiffs refile their amended complaint with their state law claims and a similar motion to dismiss is filed, the 
parties are directed to brief the issues of Florida law's treatment of a breach of contract claim concerning an oral contract and 
whether, under Florida law, an implicit representation based on a party's actions is sufficient for common law fraud, as opposed 
to an explicit statement. Additionally, the Court notes there is a split of authority as to whether a Walker Process claim is a compulsory counterclaim 
which must be pled in a patent infringement suit. See Critical-Vac Filtration Corp. v. Minuteman Int'l Inc., 233 F.3d 697 (2d Cir. 
2000) (compulsory counterclaim); FilmTec Corp. v. Hydranautics, 67 F.3d 931 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (compulsory counterclaim); Med. 
Mut. of Ohio, Inc. v. Braintree Labs., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 74996 (D. Del. July 12, 2011) (compulsory counterclaim); Am. 
Packaging Corp. v. Golden Valley Microwave Foods, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5918 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 28, 1995) (compulsory 
counterclaim) aff'd without opinion by 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 12061 (3d Cir. 1996). But see Tank Insulation Int'l, Inc. v. 
Insultherm, Inc., 104 F.3d 83 (5th Cir. 1997) (permissive counterclaim); Hydranautics v. FilmTec Corp., 70 F.3d 533 (9th Cir. 
1995) (permissive counterclaim). The Court need not resolve the split but observes that if, consistent with the rulings of other 
districts within this Circuit, the Court were to hold that the Walker Process claim is a compulsory counterclaim, such holding 
would further support dismissal of the claim. If the complaint is amended, the parties are further directed to brief this issue in any 
motions to dismiss that might follow. "
970,1," Pacific Seafood, engaged in seafood processing, sales, and distribution, consists of more than 55 entities owned by defendants 
Frank Dulcich and Dulcich, Inc. First Am. Comp (or ""FAC""). ¶ 19."
970,2," In resolving the pending motions, I assume the truth of all factual allegations in the complaint and FAC. "
971,3," One could read the FAC as portraying Carroll as perhaps having more experience in the design and construction of seafood 
processing plants as opposed to experience actually operating such plants. For the purpose of this opinion, I assume Carroll has 
extensive experience actually operating seafood processing plants."
971,4," The FAC is silent as to any experience Backus has in operating seafood processing plants. One assumes Backus' role was to 
secure financing. However, as discussed below, there are no allegations Backus secured any financing for either the partnership 
or Innovation Marine. "
972,5," Plaintiffs originally alleged the two transactions were separate conspiracies, each involving Pacific Seafood. In the FAC, 
plaintiffs allege each transaction is one part of a single conspiracy between all three defendants to transfer all available seafood 
processing facilities of Trident and Cal-Shell to Pacific Seafood. FAC ¶ 31. "
973,6," As discussed below, plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief under Section 16. "
975,7," ""While [landlords] have standing to challenge illegal restraints in their licensing or renting market, they generally lack standing 
to challenge restraints in other markets, including that served by their licensees or tenants."" Phillip E. Areeda, Herbert 
Hovenkamp, et al., Anitrust Law, Vol. IIA, ¶ 351a (4th ed. 2013). "
976,8," Because Front Street seeks only injunctive relief, I need not examine other antitrust standing factors such as the speculative 
nature of the harm, the risk of duplicative recovery, or the complexity in apportioning damages. That said, the specific remedy of 
divestiture in favor of each relative plaintiff (while excluding any other potential bidders) at a price admittedly below market value 
would seemingly violate the main goal of antitrust laws, i.e., increased competition. "
978,9," Even a ""proposal"" from Mr. Carroll would fall well short of the affirmative steps necessary to provide antitrust standing to a 
potential competitor. See Bubar, 752 F.3d at 453 (discussing multimillion dollar proposals management group made, followed by 
counter proposals from A & B, stood ""in contrast"" to other situations involving ""firm offers."")."
978,10," Plaintiffs do not object to the Court taking judicial notice of public documents related to Innovation Marine held by the 
Corporation Division of the Oregon Secretary of State. Fed. R. Evid. § 201(d); Lee v. County of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689 
(9th Cir. 2001)."
978,11," Innovation Marine argues that even if the fact that it did not exist at the time of the sale bars its claim, amending the complaint 
and naming the prospective partnership would cure this problem. Ordinarily, shareholders lack standing to bring a claim for an 
injury suffered by the corporation. Bubar, 752 F.2d at 450-51. The same holds true for prospective shareholders of a prospective 
corporation. Id. at 451. Because the rule could potentially be relaxed if ""a person had all the resources to enter a market and 
intended to form a solely-owned corporation rather than an individual enterprise,"" for the purpose of this opinion I assume 
plaintiffs could amend the complaint naming the partnership. Id. Although I assume the partnership could potentially proceed as "
979,," plaintiffs, I do not overlook the perhaps insurmountable hurdles the partnership would face going forward. See Solinger v. A & M 
Records, 718 F.2d 298, 299 (9th Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (Denying antitrust standing in failure to deal case brought by 
prospective shareholder in prospective company because, ""The conveniences and immunities that arise from doing business 
through corporate entities carry with them the costs of having these corporate entities seek their remedies in court for injuries to 
their business or property interests. A shareholder of a corporation injured by antitrust violations has no standing to sue in his or 
her own name, and a fortiori, a prospective shareholder ordinarily would have no standing.""). Because neither the partnership 
nor Innovation Marine took substantial steps to enter the market, neither party has standing."
979,12," At oral argument, Innovation Marine stated that if granted leave to file an amended complaint, it would include allegations 
regarding steps taken to secure financing. But Innovation Marine included no such allegations in the proposed FAC, filed in 
response to defendants' arguments that it lacked standing as a prospective participant. The time to include such allegations was 
in the FAC. Second, even assuming Innovation Marine secured financing, the allegations reveal it never engaged in serious 
discussions to purchase the assets. "

992,6," Areeda and Hovenkamp explain that in an attempt case, when ""the defendant is not yet a monopolist,"" market prices are more 
competitive. ¶ 807g. On the other hand, ""[i]n a monopolization case the defendant is already a dominant firm and the market 
already presumably exhibits monopoly prices that have not been effectively disciplined by new entry."" Id. Thus, easy entry into 
the market is indicative that the market lacks barriers to entry that may otherwise protect a dominant firm's monopoly power. Id."
992,7," Because antitrust standing is prudential, we are not bound to address it first, because it ""does not affect the subject matter

992,8," HN13[
] The test for antitrust standing is: ""(1) the causal connection between the antitrust violation and the harm to the 
plaintiff and the intent by the defendant to cause that harm, with neither factor alone conferring standing; (2) whether the 
plaintiff's alleged injury is of the type for which the antitrust laws were intended to provide redress; (3) the directness of the injury, 
which addresses the concerns that liberal application of standing principles might produce speculative claims; (4) the existence "
993,," of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust violations; and (5) the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment 
of damages."" Ethypharm, 707 F.3d at 232-33 (quoting In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 1144, 1165-66 (3d 
Cir. 1993))."
993,9," Appellants allege the potential detriment to consumers in the event that medallion taxicabs are driven out of the market, 
entirely. See, e.g., SAC ¶ 62. Yet they fail to aver any facts suggesting that this is an imminent, realistic possibility."
993,10," See also Areeda & Hovenkamp, ¶ 337 HN16[

recovery for losses resulting from competition, even though [in Brunswick] such competition was actually caused by conduct 
violating the antitrust laws.""). "

997,1," Defendant Jennifer Maier filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, but the automatic 
stay has been terminated and modified to allow this case to ""proceed in all respects to completion."" (See Doc. No. 346-1). 
Therefore, the Court can proceed on all motions and matters against all Defendants. (See Doc. Nos. 346, 348). "
999,2," This case does not involve the application of Alabama law. Therefore, this Court is not bound by any holding in Mobil. "
1000,3," See, e.g., Cromwell Towers Redevelopment Co. v. City of Yonkers, 41 N.Y.2d 1, 359 N.E.2d 333, 337, 390 N.Y.S.2d 822 (N.Y. 
1976) (""In construing the contract . . ., due consideration must be given to the purpose of the parties in making the contract[.]""); 
Roberts v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 893 F.2d 21, 24 (2d Cir. 1989) (""[C]ourts look to the acts and circumstances surrounding 
execution of the ambiguous term to ascertain the parties' intent.""); Sea Lion Oil Trading & Transp., Inc. v. Statoil Mktg. & Trading 
(US) Inc., 728 F. Supp. 2d 531, 535 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (""[W]hen considering a sale of goods contract under the U.C.C., the 
determination of a contract's meaning is not made in a vacuum. Rather, it is done in conjunction with evidence about course of 
dealing, usage of trade, and the parties' course of performance so long as that extrinsic evidence does not contradict the 
contract's language.""). "
1001,4," Defendant Maier for the first time argues that New York's economic loss doctrine applies. (Doc. No. 323-1 at 3). This argument 
has been waived by failing to preserve it in her Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) motion. Maier did not raise it in her Rule 50(a) motion or by 
joining in WDS and Ewert's Rule 50(a) motion. Liberally considering the record, the Court has assumed for purposes of this 
Order that Maier joined in WDS and Ewert's Rule 50(a) motion. "
1002,5," Defendants WDS and Ewert argue that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive because Plaintiffs were not required 
to prove, and did not produce evidence of, any damages other than the overcharges. (Doc. No. 322-1 at 14). However, as 
explained above, the economic loss rule does not bar Plaintiffs' tort claims, and Defendants have cited no case law to support 
their proposition."
1002,6," Defendants WDS and Ewert did not preserve this arguments, except to the extent they argue there was a lack of reasonable 
reliance. Therefore, WDS and Ewert's broad objection is waived."
1002,7," The jury found Plaintiffs' claims for fraud were not barred by the statute of limitation. (Doc. No. 314). Consistent with the North 
Carolina patterned instructions, the jury was asked ""Did the Plaintiffs file this action within three years after discovery of the facts 
constituting the fraud?"" and was instructed as to discovery and reasonable diligence to discover. (Doc. No. 314). Defendant 
Maier mistakenly overlooks that the cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins running upon discovery by 
Plaintiffs—not the occurrence of the facts constituting the fraud, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 1-52(9); Vail v. Vail, 233 N.C. 109, 63 S.E.2d 
202, 207 (N.C. 1951). (Doc. No. 351 at 4). Therefore, despite Defendant Maier's attempt, whether Maier committed a continuing 
wrong is moot. (Docs. No. 323-1 at 7; Doc. No. 347 at 9). The jury concluded Plaintiffs' claim of fraud resulting in damages of 
$35,177,269 was timely. "
1003,8," During trial, Plaintiffs' expert testified that the net overcharges occurring from February 1, 2012 through April 30, 2016 equaled 
$35,177,269. Plaintiffs sought this amount in damages for all claims."
1003,9," Defendant Maier, in a footnote, additionally moves for a reduction of damages from $35,177,259 to $191,076 under Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 59(e), asserting again that the only conduct within the applicable statute of limitations that can form the basis of a claim 
against her occurred in 2016. (Doc. No. 323-1 at 24 n. 12). A Rule 59(e) motion seeking to ""to relitigate old matters, or to raise 
arguments or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment"" is not proper. Exxon Shipping Co., 
554 U.S. at 485 n.5; see also Pac. Ins. Co., 148 F.3d at 403. A court may only grant a motion under Rule 59(e) to alter or amend "
1004,," a judgment if it finds ""that there has been an intervening change of controlling law, that new evidence has become available, or 
that there is a need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice."" Robinson v. Wix Filtration Corp. LLC, 599 F.3d 403, 
411 (4th Cir. 2010). Here, Defendant Maier is rearguing old matters and has not explained any reason justifying granting a Rule 
59(e) motion. As found by the jury, the statute of limitations also does not limit Plaintiffs' damages against Maier. Maier's motion 
pursuant to Rule 59(e) is denied."
1004,10," Defendant Maier makes the same arguments for the claim of unfair and deceptive trade practices. (Doc. No. 323-1 at 7). She 
also argues there is no evidence she participated in a conspiracy. (Doc. No. 323-1 at 8). These arguments fail for the same 
reasons they fail for fraud. "
1005,11," Defendants WDS and Ewert also admitted that certain payments of the Purchase Orders were made to a bank account 
located in North Carolina. (Doc. No. 182 at ¶ 238)."
1005,12," Although the Fourth Circuit has recognized the applicability of the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine in the antirust context, 
Greenville Publishing Co., Inc. v. Daily Reflector, Inc., 496 F.2d 391, 399 (4th Cir.1974), and section 1985 civil rights context, 
Buschi v. Kirven, 775 F.2d 1240, 1252-53 (4th Cir.1985), these claims are not before the Court in this case. The one case cited 
by Maier that addresses and applies the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine in the context of RICO is not binding on this Court, 
Walters v. McMahen, 795 F. Supp. 2d 350, 358-59 (D. Md. 2011), and on appeal to the Fourth Circuit, the court expressly stated 
""[b]ecause we conclude that the plaintiffs have failed to plead adequately a cause of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), we need 
not address the separate issue whether the intracorporate immunity doctrine bars their cause of action[,]"" Walters v. McMahen, 
684 F.3d 435, 445 n.11 (4th Cir. 2012). The Fourth Circuit case, Detrick v. Panalpina, Inc., 108 F.3d 529, 544 (4th Cir. 1997), 
cited by Maier also involves counterclaims for conspiracy under Virginia law, not North Carolina law. "
1006,13," Walters, 684 F.3d at 440 (holding failure to plead plausible violation of either predicate act fatal to section 1962(c) claim, which 
rendered plaintiffs' claims under section 1962(d) for conspiracy to violate section 1962(c) insufficient); Tal v. Hogan, 453 F.3d 
1244, 1249-50, 1252, 1270 (10th Cir. 2006) (""Because Appellants have failed to allege a sufficient claim under subsections (b) 
or (c), their subsection (d) conspiracy claim fails as a matter of law.""); Lightning Lube v. Witco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1191 (3d Cir. 
1983) (same). "
1007,14," Defendant Maier also alleges that asking the jury ""Do you find any of the following Defendants liable to Plaintiffs under the 
Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices Act?"" was an error because the jury does not determine whether the act was unfair or 
deceptive. (Doc. No. 323-1 at 24). As reflected in the record, the jury instructions did not ask the jury whether the acts were 
unfair or deceptive. These terms were not defined. Rather, the jury was asked to address the factual questions of in or affecting 
commerce and causation, which are necessary elements for an Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act claim, and answer in 
the affirmative to the question if they so found. Further, Maier never objected to the phrasing of the question. In fact, Defendants 
agreed in the proposed instructions submitted to the Court to the listing of Plaintiffs' first claim or count as a violation of the 
Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act and proposed verdict questions that used the terminology ""unfair or deceptive act."""
1007,15," Cargill moved to amend its complaint to add CMS after Defendants Ewert and WDS sought to amend their answer to allege 
that Cargill was not the real party in interest and did not have standing to sue for any transactions involving Cargill Meat 
Solutions. (See Doc. No. 37-1; 39-1; 49). Cargill argued joinder proper under Fed. R. Civ. P. 20, which permits the joinder of a 
party if ""they assert any right to relief jointly, severally, . . . and any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the 
action."" The Court agreed and granted the motion to amend and join CMS. (Doc. No. 55). As Plaintiffs seek relief jointly and 
severally, as permitted under Rule 20, the Court did not err as to the instructions and verdict form. See generally, Fenton v. 
Freedman, 748 F.2d 1358, 1359-1361 (9th Cir. 1984) (affirming judgment in favor of co-plaintiffs Shaindy Fenton and Shaindy 
Fenton, Inc. where acts of co-plaintiffs were ""so intertwined . . . that the claims could have been filed jointly"" and the court joined 
Shaindy Fenton, Inc. after defendants sought to dismiss the case because ""Shaindy Fenton was not the real party in interest 
since the evidence showed all transactions sued upon were entered into between Shaindy Fenton, Inc. and [defendants]""). "
1008,16," Maier also stated, without elaboration or citation, that ""the admission of certain testimony as to Maier was also improper and 
prejudicial, such as the non-parties that invoked the Fifth Amendment . . . ."" (Doc. No. 323-1 at 24). From this mere listing of this "
1009,," alleged error, Maier has not shown an acceptable reason for the grant of a new trial. Cline, 144 F.3d at 301. Further, the Court 
concludes herein the errors alleged by Defendant WDS and Ewert are not errors. Therefore, the Court denies Maier's request for 
a new trial."
1009,17," As pointed out by Plaintiffs, the instruction allowing a negative inference was limited to the witnesses themselves, Nguyen and 
Milacki. (Doc. No. 340 at 24). "
1011,18," In Defendant Maier's response to Plaintiffs' request for prejudgment interest, request for attorneys' fees and memorandum of 
law on the UDTPA, Maier contends all of these requests should be denied for the reasons stated by Defendants Ewert and WDS 
and because: ""(1) the requests are not governed by North Carolina law; (2) Maier did not make an unwarranted refusal to settle; 
(3) Maier was the prevailing party on the three of the four RICO claims asserted against her; (4) all of the attorneys' fees incurred 
by Plaintiffs were not in connection with claims against Maier; (5) 'Losses' as defined by the WDS-Cargill Agreements, including 
attorneys' fees, are not recoverable; and (6) any recovery by Plaintiffs would be less than what is sought because an award of 
damages against Maier, if any, must be reduced."" (Doc. No. 354 at 1-2). Arguments one, five, and six have already been 
rejected by the Court in this Order and in its previous oral rulings. Therefore, the Court only addresses arguments two, three, 
and four."
1011,19," Defendants WDS and Ewert object to the ""[t]rebling of the jury's award of $35,177,269.00 under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-16"" 
because ""(1) North Carolina's Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1 et seq. ('UDPTA') does not 
apply because neither Plaintiff presented evidence that it suffered any harm in North Carolina; (2) the UDPTA claim is barred by 
the economic loss doctrine and Plaintiffs only sought contract-based damages; (3) neither Plaintiff presented sufficient evidence 
to support the fraud-based claims; (4) the jury should not have been permitted to consider the RICO claim; (5) the damages 
assessed by the jury are erroneous, against the weight of the evidence, and a product of jury confusion; (6) the commercial 
bribery finding does not support the jury's award; and (7) the finding of falsification of records does not support the jury's award."" 
(Doc. No. 342). Arguments one through five were raised by Defendants WDS and Ewert in their Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) and 59 
motion, which have previously been addressed and rejected in this Order. Defendants' sixth and seventh argument do not 
address the matter before the Court, whether the conduct found by the jury is unfair or deceptive. Defendants have not 
preserved this argument. Therefore, it is denied. "
1012,20," Defendants WDS and Ewert appear to argue that Plaintiffs' failure ""to present evidence of the value of the alleged commercial 
bribes"" and ""represent[ation] that they would not seek such damages"" distinguishes this case from Kewaunee. However, in 
reaching their conclusion, the court in Kewaunee relied on ""[t]he jury f[inding] that the defendant paid Pegram in exchange for 
Pegram's cooperation or assistance in arranging sales and for refusing to entertain quotes or bids from other potential 
corrugated cardboard suppliers."" 503 S.E.2d at 420. Given this finding, the court noted that commercial bribery is a crime under 
N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-353. Id. The court then held ""a violation of G.S. 14-353 should also be considered a violation of G.S. 75-1.1 
as an unfair and deceptive trade practice."" Id. Section 14-353 does not require a showing of damage or injury nor allows such a 
recovery. Instead, section 14-353 requires a showing consistent with the jury's finding in Kewaunee and the instructions given to 
the jury in this case. Thus, the Court finds no merit in Defendants WDS and Ewert's argument. The jury's finding of commercial 
bribery ""satisf[ies] the first element"" for a claim of unfair and deceptive trade practices. Kewaunee, 503 S.E.2d at 420."
1012,21," Some case law suggests this determination is a question for the Court. Compare Sara Lee Corp., 519 S.E.2d at 311 (deciding 
whether acts were ""in or affecting commerce""), with United Lab., Inc. v. Kuykendall, 437 S.E.2d 374, 376 (N.C. 1993) (jury 
determined whether conduct was in or affecting commerce), and Kewaunee Sci. Corp., 503 S.E.2d at 420 (jury determined 
whether conduct was in or affecting commerce). Therefore, to the extent necessary, the Court clarifies that the conduct found by 
the jury was in or affecting commerce as defined under N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1. ""'Commerce' includes all business activities, 
however denominated,"" N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1.1(b), which has been recognized by the North Carolina Supreme Court to apply "
1013,," to buyers and sellers in a commercial context. See Bhatti, 400 S.E.2d at 444 (citation omitted); see also Sara Lee Corp., 519 
S.E.2d at 311-12. The findings by the jury, which the Court has concluded constitute an unfair and deceptive practice, all 
occurred in the context of the selling by Defendants to Plaintiffs in a commercial context. Accordingly, the Court affirms the jury's 
finding. "
1014,22," Defendants reassert their argument that Chapter 75 does not apply because Plaintiffs did not present evidence that it suffered 
harm in North Carolina. The Court has already rejected this argument. "
1016,23," Defendant Maier's objection to the attorneys' fees and request for apportionment is overruled. (See Doc. No. 354). The record 
and jury's findings reflect the inextricably intertwined nature of all the claims among all Defendants, whom the jury found to be 
co-conspirators. (See Doc. No. 360 at 3-5). "
1017,24," Plaintiffs sought in the alternative an order to show cause why sanction should not be imposed on Defendants. However, 
Plaintiffs, and all Defendants, agreed after trial that a hearing on this pending motion was not necessary. Further, as the relief 
requested is moot, the request for a show cause hearing addressing the requested relief is also moot."
1017,25," If their request for relief is no longer moot, Plaintiffs may re-new their motion for relief."
1017,26," As agreed by all the parties, the Court informed the jury that the Court will use the jury's verdict to determine the judgment and 
will not allow a double recovery. "

m. The parties dispute whether the EpiPen was misclassified."
1021,2," On consent of both parties, the Court takes judicial notice of Mylan's August 31, 2017, press release finalizing the terms of the 
settlement. (See Dkt. Nos. 53-55.)"
1021,3," Additionally, on consent of the parties, the Court takes judicial notice of (1) the fact that a press release was issued by the 
Attorney General of Connecticut, on behalf of 46 state attorneys general, announcing their intention to file an amended 
complaint against Mylan and other drug companies in an antitrust suit, and (2) the fact that the proposed amended complaint in 
that suit was filed. (Dkt. Nos. 61-1 & 61-2; see also Dkt. Nos. 61 & 63.) "
1022,4," For a complete list of each allegedly misleading statement, see Appendix A to this Opinion and Order. "
1024,5," Because the question of underlying illegality overlaps with—and in many ways is overtaken by—the separate requirement of 
scienter, the Court considers these questions together."
1024,6, Mylan also offered an explanation of income in its August 2015 quarterly earnings call. (Compl. ¶ 274.) 
1028,7," Indeed, Plaintiffs appear to abandon this claim in their opposition brief. (See Dkt. No. 49 at 7 (listing four categories of 
misleading statements relating to EpiPen, none of which included statements regarding complexity).) "
1032,8," Because the terms of the settlement agreement are confidential, the Complaint alleges that it ""likely contained"" a pay-for-delay 
provision. (Compl. ¶ 97.)"
1032,9," The Complaint also alleges that the exclusive dealing arrangements violate Section 3 of the Clayton Act, but Plaintiffs have 
waived this claim by failing to respond to Defendants' contrary arguments in their motion-to-dismiss briefing. (See Dkt. No. 46 at 
9; Dkt. No. 49 at 10 n.8.) Regardless, the Court concludes that the Complaint does not adequately allege a violation of Section 3 
because it fails to allege that ""the competition foreclosed by the contract[s] . . . constitute[s] a substantial share of the relevant 
market."" Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 328, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961). "
1033,10," Even if such allegations could be teased out of the Complaint, the Court is constrained from doing so because a claim for 
securities fraud must allege with particularity ""the reason or reasons why [each] statement is misleading."" 15 U.S.C. § 78u-
4(b)(1). "
1034,11," The parties dispute whether, in securities fraud actions premised on a failure to disclose underlying criminal conduct, the 
underlying conduct is subject to heightened pleading standards or plausibility pleading analysis. The Court need not decide this 
issue because it concludes that Plaintiffs have satisfied either standard. "
1035,12," For the same reasons, the Complaint also fails to sufficiently plead corporate scienter. See Wyche v. Advanced Drainage 
Sys., Inc., No. 15 Civ. 5955, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34656, 2017 WL 971805, at *15 n.9 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2017), aff'd, 710 Fed. 
Appx. 471, 2017 WL 4570663 (2d Cir., 2017) (concluding that allegations of the actions of ""unnamed employees"" did not give 
rise to corporate scienter because, ""though there is no specific seniority formula for scienter, these employees are clearly not 
identified with the requisite particularity that would permit the Court to infer that their seniority is sufficient""). "
1036,13," The Court notes that it is possible that Plaintiffs' Israeli law claim could fall within the Court's original diversity jurisdiction. It 
appears that at least one defendant, Mylan Inc., is a citizen of New York because its principal place of business is located in this 
state. (Compl. ¶ 27.) But because the Complaint does not allege the citizenship of the plaintiffs or the individual Defendants, the 
Court cannot determine whether complete or minimal diversity exists. See 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), (d). Because ""jurisdiction must 
be shown affirmatively, and that showing is not made by drawing from the pleadings inferences favorable to the party asserting 
it,"" Shipping Fin. Servs. Corp. v. Drakos, 140 F.3d 129, 131 (2d Cir. 1998), the Court presumes that the only possible basis for 
jurisdiction over the Israeli claim is supplemental jurisdiction, as alleged in the Complaint. (See Compl. ¶ 22.) Furthermore, the 
Court notes that although it does not reach Defendants' motion to dismiss under the doctrine of forum non conveniens, several 
of the factors compelling the Court to decline supplemental jurisdiction would also weigh in favor of a dismissal on those 
alternative grounds. "
1037,14," ""While many of the cases refer to supplemental jurisdiction over 'state claims,' Section 1367 applies to 'all other claims' and 
therefore the same analysis would also apply to foreign law claims."" Roman y Gordillo, S.C. v. The Bank of New York Mellon 
Corp., No. 12 Civ. 212, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135664, 2015 WL 5786460, at *21 n.29 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2015)."
1037,15," By letter dated March 18, 2018, Plaintiffs' counsel in the Israeli class actions represented to the Court that they ""intend to stay"" 
those actions. (Dkt. No. 68 at 2.) However, even if the Israeli courts grant such a stay, the remaining § 1367(c) considerations 
still counsel in favor of declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' Israeli law claims. "
1051,1, The Court will rule by separate order on the pending motions to seal and to exclude proposed expert testimony.
1051,2," In the exercise of discretion, the Court denies Defendants' Motion for Supplemental Briefing and Plaintiffs' Motion to File 
Supplemental Evidence for the Summary Judgment Record. See Civil Local Rule 7-3(d). The Court does not, at this time, rule 
on whether Plaintiffs' proposed supplemental evidence will be admissible at trial. "
1053,3," The Jenkins Plaintiffs raise one separate issue in a footnote to Plaintiffs' opposition to Defendants' cross-motion for summary 
judgment. They request that if the Court grants Defendants' summary judgment motion in the consolidated action, the Court not 
apply the ruling to the Jenkins action, but instead remand it back to the District of New Jersey, where the decisions of the Ninth 
Circuit and this Court in O'Bannon would not control under the doctrine of stare decisis. At the hearing on the motion, the 
Jenkins Plaintiffs clarified that they do not seek remand if the Court grants summary judgment only in part. See Jan. 16, 2018 Tr. 
at 50. Because the Court grants summary judgment in part and denies it in part, the Jenkins Plaintiffs' request for remand prior 
to summary judgment is moot. "
1055,4," The parties have not briefed whether there are any class members in this case who were not class members in O'Bannon 
because their NIL have not been, and will not be, included in game footage or in videogames after the conclusion of the athlete's 
participation in intercollegiate athletics. See O'Bannon, 7 F. Supp. 3d at 965 (quoting class definition). "
1056,5," The SAF is a fund that the NCAA provides to member schools to distribute to student-athletes for a variety of uses, some of 
which are in addition to full cost-of-attendance financial aid. See NCAA (Lennon) Depo. at 152:19-153:19; Pls. Ex. 24 at 
NCAAGIA03316052 (reporting on SAF uses). "
1057,6," Defendants' expert Dr. Kenneth G. Elzinga posits that the market should be viewed more broadly as a multi-sided one for the 
educational services of colleges and universities, but Defendants, having taken the position that O'Bannon is controlling, do not 
rely on this theory. "
1059,7," Except to the extent that they are included in the interrogatory response, Defendants do not request that the Court reconsider 
the procompetitive justifications of increased output and competitive balance rejected in O'Bannon. See 7 F. Supp. 3d at 978-79, 
981-82. The O'Bannon defendants did not substantively defend the rejected procompetitive justifications on appeal, 802 F.3d at 
1072, and Defendants here do not proffer any evidence to support them. "
1061,8," Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' proposed less restrictive alternative of conference autonomy is inconsistent with Plaintiffs' 
challenge to conference-specific rules. See Pls. MSJ, App'x A (listing challenged rules). However, Plaintiffs challenge only the 
portions of the conference rules that require compliance with challenged NCAA rules. See Pls. Reply, App'x A (listing challenged 
language of each rule). "
1066,1," The named plaintiffs originally included John R. Bloyer, Jr. and Adrianne L. Bloyer. They have voluntarily dismissed their 
individual claims. (Doc. 120)."
1066,2," Many of the motions refer to and purport to join each other. For purposes of simplicity and clarity, the Court will address the 
generally-applicable grounds for summary judgment as a group, as well as those well-pled grounds which pertain to specific 
defendants and Counts. "
1069,3," Kevin Dvorak testified in his deposition that his wife handles the financial matters in the household, that he was not significantly 
involved with the current matter and had no personal knowledge of any of the allegations in the Complaint other than the fact 
that he owned the properties, and that they were sold for delinquent taxes and eventually redeemed. (Docs. 271-5 at 3 and 278-
6 at 4-5). As such, it is Kathleen Dvorak's testimony that is pertinent to the statute of limitations issue. "
1072,4," Defendants point to the fact that other buyers did win tax certificates at the 2007 and 2008 tax year auctions, including 50 that 
Brosh won in the 2007 tax year auction, and assert that ""if the named Defendants had monopoly power, this could not and would 
not have occurred."" (Doc. 268 at 9). However, the exclusion need not be total in order to qualify as improper monopolistic 
conduct—courts routinely entertain monopoly claims where the market share is less than 100 percent, as discussed above. "

1093,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3. 
1103,1," Going forward, this opinion uses the term ""Digicel"" to refer to the common enterprise, and ""Digicel USA"" and ""Digicel Haiti"" 
when necessary or appropriate to refer to the distinct corporate bodies."
1103,2," The question of antitrust standing, and the requirement that an antitrust plaintiff participate in the same market as the 
defendant, is an outgrowth of the requirement that the plaintiff experienced antitrust injury. The remaining elements of antitrust 
injury are discussed later in this opinion. "
1106,3," To the extent that UPM alleges that Digicel charges $0.23 per minute just for the transportation function—it is not clear from 
UPM's complaint what services UPM alleges the $0.23 to include—that allegation appears to be based on Digicel's allegations in 
its own complaint. Digicel alleges, however, that the $0.23 per minute fee is a flat fee charged to wholesalers that is considered 
to include the cost of the transportation function that Digicel provides, in addition to the fee for terminating a call on Digicel's 
network. Neither Digicel nor UPM allege what amount Digicel Haiti pays to Digicel USA for performing the transportation 
function."
1106,4," Seen this way, the market for pure international transportation services may resemble a two-sided market. A two-sided platform 
is one that acts as an intermediary that ""caters to two or more distinct 'sides' of users that derive value from interacting with one 
another; but the firm's service will not attract one side unless there are participating users on the other."" Erik Hovenkamp, 
Antitrust Policy for Two-Sided Markets (February 9, 2018), available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3121481. A firm that 
offers only the international transportation function of international telecommunications requires the participation of two sets of 
customers: wholesalers with a need to get their calls to a different country, and local service providers who charge the 
wholesalers to terminate that call in the local country. A new area of antitrust law appears to be emerging for two-sided 
markets. This new area, however, does not appear to be applicable here because Digicel is not a two-sided platform. It performs 
its transportation function in-house, for purposes of antitrust law. Because it offers both transportation and termination, it needs 
only one set of customers—the wholesalers. That UPM appears to offer a two-sided platform, while Digicel offers a single-sided 
platform reinforces the inference that UPM and Digicel do not compete in the same market. "
1108,5," UPM's allegations resemble a claim brought under the essential facilities doctrine. See MCI Communications Corp. v. American 
Tel. & Tel. Co., 708 F.2d 1081, 1132-33 (7th Cir. 1983) (finding antitrust liability where the following elements exist: ""(1) control 
of the essential facility by a monopolist; (2) a competitor's inability practically or reasonably to duplicate the essential facility; (3) 
the denial of the use of the facility to a competitor; and (4) the feasibility of providing the facility""). During oral argument, 
however, counsel for UPM expressly stated that UPM is not pleading its case under the essential facilities doctrine. ECF 150 at 
31. The Court thus does not analyze UPM's claims of anticompetitive activity under the essential facilities doctrine. "
1113,1," Defendants address their single entity defense within their ""omnibus"" Brief in Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary 
Judgment on Plaintiffs' Section 1, Per Se, and Quick Look Claims. (Doc. # 1353-1 at 28-32)."
1113,2," As will be explained more fully below, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield trademarks play a central role in the business strategy 
employed by the Defendants in this case. For example, defending the strength of the Blue Marks is ostensibly the justification for 
many of the alleged restraints challenged by Plaintiffs."
1113,3," Due to (1) the volume of exhibits filed in support of the parties' respective motions for partial summary judgment, and (2) the 
parties' inability to cite to CM/ECF page numbers because of the volume of sealed exhibits in this case, in some instances, the 
court has relied on the parties' respective responses to an opponent's asserted undisputed facts in compiling the relevant 
undisputed facts referenced in this opinion. That is, where appropriate, if a party has not disputed an asserted undisputed fact, 
the court has relied on that failure to dispute the asserted undisputed fact as establishing that fact as undisputed for purposes of 
the instant motions. "
1115,4," The February 20, 1987 Draft of the White Paper on the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assembly of Plans recognized that 
unlicensed and unauthorized use of trademarks can result in abandonment. (Doc. # 1352-227 at 55-56)."
1115,5," There was not a Plan in every state at this time. (Docs. # 1429-11 at 4-5; 1429-14). For example, there were no Plans in 
Alaska, Nevada, and Vermont. (Id.). "
1117,6," In a letter dated January 16, 2001, Thomas Hartnett, President and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Western New York, 
acknowledged that there had been overlapping service areas for sixty (60) years. (Doc. # 1436-77 at 4). In fact, he expressed 
the opinion that the Blue brands ""are strengthened in overlapping service areas where two Plans are able to compete freely"" and 
they ""have done so for many years."" (Id.)."
1117,7," Whereas Highmark has apparently espoused the idea of a single Blue Plan in Pennsylvania, Capital BlueCross's President and 
CEO has indicated he has seen an ""increase in Blue business overall"" in its own overlapping service area. (Doc. # 1436-63 at 
2). "
1120,8," The Local Best Efforts Rule applies only to health revenue ""attributable to health care plans and related services and hospital 
services . . . offered within the designated Service Area."" (Doc. # 1350-10 at 4). "
1121,9," Unlike the Blue Plans, who are dedicated to their local markets, the national insurers have demonstrated a willingness to pull 
out of markets and leave populations uninsured. (Doc. # 1353-102 at 56). "
1125,10," Notably, one of the alleged conspirators in Palmer, BRG of Georgia, had never sold bar review courses outside of Georgia 
and had no apparent intent to do so. 12 Philip R. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law § 2030b at 220 n. 7 (3d ed. 
2012). "
1127,11," In Abraham & Veneklasen Joint Venture, the Fifth Circuit acknowledged that a functional approach is appropriate under 
American Needle. Abraham & Veneklasen Joint Venture, 776 F.3d at 328. But, the ""key"" inquiry underlying even a functional 
analysis remains the same: are independent centers of decisionmaking being removed from the market? Id. (citing Am. Needle, 
560 U.S. at 195)."
1127,12," Perhaps it may be more precise to say that this activity is what happened on the Blue Cross side. The parties have not drawn 
the court's attention to Rule 56 evidence that indicates what occurred with Blue Shield License Agreements prior to the 1991 
License Agreements which were developed after the Assembly of Plans. (Docs. # 1349-8 at 31-32; 1353-48). And, on the Blue 
Cross side, four Plans (Connecticut, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Rockford, Illinois) retained the right to their state law trademark 
rights in their Blue Cross License Agreements. (Docs. # 1353-11 at 8; 1353-101). Moreover, it is not entirely clear on the present record that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield bodies who applied for the respective 
federal trademarks had the authority to do so at the time the applications were submitted. Both entities represented that they 
made those applications with permission from the original users, and there is documentary evidence supporting the idea that 
permission from other concurrent users was given. But the parties have not drawn the court's attention to documents 
establishing actual assignments of the individual rights to those entities. "
1128,13," Provider Plaintiffs describe one facet of the alleged anticompetitive conspiracy as an agreement concerning healthcare 
financing services because the agreement allegedly concerns fully insured plans and Administrative Service Only (""ASO"") plans. 
(Doc. # 1083 at ¶ 340). In contrast, Subscriber Plaintiffs indicate that ASO plans are not available substitutes for all Subscribers 
because they are not viable options unless the Subscriber (or his/her group plan) can afford to self-insure. (Doc. # 1082 at ¶ 
553). "
1130,14," Indeed, the Association sent its executives to states with separate Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance Plans to confer with 
their executives about the Long-Term Business Strategy. (Doc. # 1352-164 at 86-87). And, Association employees ""may have 
served as mediators"" that resolved issues arising during the mergers. (Id.). The Association's representative testified that its 
employees assisted in Plan mergers before the Long-Term Business Plan went into effect. (Id. at 87). "
1132,15," Defendants' reliance on American Needle and NCAA is also unavailing with regard to the ESAs at issue here. Both American 
Needle and NCAA recognized that rule of reason analysis was appropriate in those cases because they concerned sports 
leagues, in which collaboration between competitors is essential to creating any product at all. American Needle, 560 U.S. at 
202-03; NCAA, 468 U.S. at 101-02. The very existence of the national health insurers against whom the Blue Plans compete 
shows that collusion between competitors is not essential to the sale of health insurance. "
1134,16," While Plaintiffs have not pressed the issue in this set of motions, the court notes the existence of the Local Best Efforts rule 
but does not address whether it is part of the aggregation of trade restraints addressed in this opinion, including the ESAs and 
the National Best Efforts rule. The court reserves that question of whether the Local Best Efforts rule is a per se Sherman Act 
violation in isolation."
1134,17," At oral argument, the court noted that the BlueCard program consists of two sets of agreements: (1) agreements between 
Providers and their in-state Blue Plans to enter the Blue provider network for health care services at a particular price; and (2) 
agreements between the Blue Plans, through the Association, which establish the rules and procedures for BlueCard and set a 
fixed price for Provider services based on the rate negotiated by an in-state Blue Plan. Provider Plaintiffs agreed that they are 
challenging the latter category of agreements, not the former. To be sure, if they had challenged the former category of 
agreements between providers and Blue Plans, those agreements clearly would not constitute ""price fixing"" for purposes of the 
Sherman Act. See Levine, 72 F.3d at 1548 (holding that a buyer network does not engage in price fixing prohibited by the 
Sherman Act if it agrees on a maximum price it is willing to pay for a product and sellers decide whether to accept that price). "
1135,18," Providers have maintained throughout these actions that it is not feasible for Alabama Providers to forgo entering the 
BlueCard Provider network due to the Blues' overwhelming market share in Alabama. (See, e.g., Doc. # 1613 at 34-35). "
1136,19," In North Jackson Pharmacy, the court also noted a judicial hesitancy to interfere with cooperative arrangements in the health 
care industry and this concern served as its final rationale for applying the rule of reason to the Sherman Act claims against the 
pharmacy benefits manager. 385 F. Supp. 2d at 750 (quoting Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 749 F.2d 922, 931 (1st Cir. 
1984) (Breyer, J.)). Several Eleventh Circuit opinions have expressed a similar reluctance to apply per se antitrust standards to 
restrictive practices performed in the health care industry. See All Care Nursing, 135 F.3d at 748 (declining to apply the per se 
group boycott rule against a preferred provider network because a recognized history of anticompetitive effect did not exist ""for 
health-care preferred-provider programs""); Levine, 72 F.3d at 1550-51 (declining to apply the per se group boycott rule to 
multiprovider networks, in part because the Department of Justice had determined that it lacked sufficient experience with such 
networks to provide a formal policy regarding them). But, in Maricopa County, the Supreme Court expressly rejected the 
argument that the per se price fixing rule should not be applied to the price list at issue because of the judiciary's lack of 
experience with the health care industry. 457 U.S. at 349-51. Likewise, the Court rejected the assertion ""that the per se rule must 
be rejustified for every industry that has not been subject to significant antitrust litigation."" Id. at 351. In accordance with 
Maricopa County, this court does not believe that any quirks unique to the health care industry, standing alone, justify application 
of the rule of reason to the alleged price fixing agreements challenged in Provider Plaintiffs' claims regarding BlueCard."
1136,20," Again, it is noteworthy that Subscriber Plaintiffs do not challenge BlueCard as an antitrust violation. This may prove significant. 
Recently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the application of the Sherman Act to two-sided platforms that unite 
distinct yet interrelated groups of customers. Ohio v. American Express Co., 138 S. Ct. 974, 200 L. Ed. 2d 217 (S. Ct. argued 
2018). The American Express case concerns the credit card market, not the health insurance market. The Second Circuit held -- 
based in part on the parties' agreement -- that the Section 1 Sherman Act claims in  [**79] American Express are to be analyzed 
under the rule of reason. United States v. Am. Express Co., 838 F.3d 179, 195-96 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. granted sub. nom, Ohio "
1137,," v. Am. Express Co., 138 S. Ct. 355, 199 L. Ed. 2d 261 (2017). The court does not address here whether any market at issue in 
this case can be characterized as a two-sided market, nor does the court discuss whether that characterization would affect a 
determination of whether to apply a per se or rule of reason standard. But it will be worth seeing what the Supreme Court has to 
say in its American Express decision."
1137,21," The court also may need to consider plausible procompetitive benefits of the type of boycott alleged in this action before 
determining whether the group boycott is subject to per se review. See Levine, 72 F.3d at 1550-51 (declining to apply a per se 
boycott standard to a multiprovider network because the Department of Justice had decided that it lacked sufficient experience 
with such entities to promulgate a formal antitrust policy); Diaz v. Farley, 215 F.3d 1175, 1183-84 (10th Cir. 2000) (discussing 
the possible procompetitive benefits of an alleged boycott against anesthesiologists at a particular hospital and the need for 
caution in antitrust analysis of professional health care). "
1138,22," During that same meeting, the Board of Directors endorsed a monetary sanctions program for violations of the Licensing 
Agreements. (Doc. # 1433-5 at 33-35)."
1138,23," In light of the parties' sparse briefing on the uncoupling rules, the court need not decide -- and does not decide -- whether the 
uncoupling rules are part of the aggregate of restraints of trade connected to the Blues' ESAs. Cf. Sealy, 388 U.S. at 354-56. "
1142,1," Regardless, any claim based upon the NOD would be barred by the statute of limitations and would have expired in December 
2015, three years after the NOD's issuance. In his amended complaint, Plaintiff has still not pled facts sufficient to toll the 
applicable statute of limitations period based upon the discovery rule. "
1144,2," The Court notes that Defendant MTC Financial Inc, dba Trustee Corps (""MTC Financial""), has not appeared in this matter. 
Therefore, the Court ISSUES this Order to Show Cause why MTC Financial should not be dismissed for Plaintiff's failure to 
prosecute the matter against them by no later than April 27, 2018. "
1150,1," Because this matter is before the Court on a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept as true the allegations set forth in the 
FAC. See Hosp. Bldg. Co. v. Trs. Of Rex Hosp., 425 U.S. 738, 740, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976). "
1151,2," The Court hereinafter refers to the price tags attached to items for sale at Defendants' stores as the ""Like Style tags."""
1151,3," Plaintiff expressly excludes any Fossil Outlet Products sold at Fossil Outlet Stores that advertised a price that was a prevailing 
market retail price within three months preceding. See id. ¶ 28. "
1152,4, The parties acknowledge that Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard applies to Plaintiff's claims. 
1155,5," Defendants urge the Court to ""follow its decisions in Oxina and Alaei rather than Branca[.]"" Doc. No. 11-1 at 7 n.1. Both cases, 
however, are inapposite. In Oxina v. Lands' End, Inc., this Court found that the plaintiff lacked standing to bring claims on behalf 
of all purchasers of the defendant's apparel because the purported misrepresentation—""Made in USA""—was listed on the 
defendant's website and the Court could not distinguish which items the ""Made in USA"" statement was mistakenly applied to and 
where each item of apparel also had its own unique physical tag that affected the Court's assessment of the statement on the 
website. No. 14-CV-2577-MMA-NLS, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94847, 2015 WL 4272058, at *6 (S.D. Cal. June 19, 2015). Thus, 
unlike this case, the purported misrepresentations as well as the products themselves varied from item to item. Moreover, in 
Alaei v. Kraft Heinz Food Co., a case where the composition of the product, in addition to the product's advertising, was at issue, 
the Court found that based upon the plaintiff's allegations, it could not ""determine whether the unpurchased products are 
sufficiently similar to Heinz 57 Sauce to confer standing upon Plaintiff[.]"" No. 15-CV-2961-MMA-DHB, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
63914, at *8 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 22, 2016). Here, however, Plaintiff's exhibits demonstrate that Fossil Outlet Stores utilized the same 
allegedly deceptive labeling practice across numerous products—not just the product Plaintiff purchased. See FAC, Exhs. A-E. "
1158,6," Defendants argue that Plaintiff ""ignores"" the Ninth Circuit's recent and ""significant decision"" in Sperling v. DSWC, Inc. (""DSW""), 
699 Fed. Appx. 654 (9th Cir. 2017), and instead focuses on the Ninth Circuit's 2017 Rubenstein decision, ""which was decided 
before Sperling and runs contrary"" to In re GlenFed, Inc., Sec. Litig., 42 F.3d 1541 (9th Cir. 1994) (en banc) and its progeny. 
Doc. No. 14 at 4. The Court disagrees. Defendants fail to note that DSW, unlike Rubenstein, is a non-exclusive product case. 
See Sperling,     F. Supp.    , 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61770, 2018 WL 1214736, at *6-7 (noting that Rubenstein is an exclusive 
product case, while DSW is a non-exclusive product case). Thus, because this is an exclusive product case, Plaintiff's reliance 
on Rubenstein is appropriate. "
1168,1," The ""AZDA convention"" is officially called the Western Regional Dental Convention. "
1169,2," Two of the manufacturers Edens contacted, Sybron Axis and Ivoclar Vivadent, would later pressure Arnold, another distributor, 
to stop supplying products to SourceOne. "
1170,3," As explained further below, acts taken ""against apparent individual economic self-interest"" are those that would have 
contravened a defendant's individual self-interest in the absence of collusion. "
1171,4," Neither Benco nor Patterson have attended a TDA or AZDA convention since, at least through the 2017 conventions. "
1174,5," In a cursory paragraph in its opposition brief, SourceOne alleges that ""[a] jury could also reasonably find that Defendants' 
agreement was part of a pre-existing conspiracy to boycott dentists forming group purchasing arrangements."" But as defendants 
correctly point out, the four pieces of evidence SourceOne cites to support this argument (three email chains and a text message 
thread) are all inter-firm communications by Schein employees. None of them involve defendants. If SourceOne's Sherman Act 
claim were based solely on this theory of a pre-existing conspiracy about group-purchasing arrangements, it would fail as a 
matter of law. "
1175,6," For this reason, defendants' argument that SourceOne has not produced any evidence that the challenged conduct had an 
actual adverse effect on competition as a whole is misplaced. "
1176,7," In their reply briefs, defendants argue only that SourceOne's rule-of-reason claim fails as a matter of law and that SourceOne 
has not produced enough evidence to satisfy its initial burden. Defendants did not argue that they could satisfy their burden at 
the second step, nor did they point to any evidence that their information-sharing had procompetitive effects. "

1193,2," Louisiana Revised Statutes 51:1404 provides, in pertinent part: A. The Louisiana Attorney General's Office, Public Protection Division, Consumer Protection Section shall have the 
following powers and duties: (1)(a) To investigate, conduct studies and research, to conduct public or private hearings into commercial and trade 
practices in the distribution, financing and furnishing of goods and services to or for the use of consumers. (b) In the furtherance of the above, the attorney general shall notify said seller, distributor, packer, or manufacturer who

1194,3," Moreover, at oral argument, AstraZeneca posited that the remedies available to the State under LSA R.S. 51:1407B cannot be 
sought unless the State pursues injunctive relief in accordance with LSA-R.S. 51:1407A. Having not been briefed, we do not 
address this issue at this time. See Uniform Rules — Courts of Appeal, Rule 1-3 (""The Courts of Appeal will review only issues 
which were submitted to the trial court and which are contained in specifications or assignments of error, unless the interest of 
justice clearly requires otherwise.""). "
1195,4," Although the facts are distinguishable, we note that a similar argument was addressed in State v. Classic Soft Trim, Inc., 95-
804 (La.App. 5 Cir. 10/20/95), 663 So.2d 835, writ denied, 95-2604 (La. 1/26/96) 666 So.2d 669, wherein an action was 
commenced by the State, through the Attorney General, on behalf of several private parties for violations of LUTPA and the 
Monopolies Act. The Fifth Circuit noted that under both acts, the Legislature has determined that actions for violations of these 
laws may be brought by the Attorney General. Id. at 835. The defendants in Classic Soft Trim had filed an exception in the trial 
court urging a lack of procedural capacity on the part of the State to be a party to the action. The trial court maintained the 
exception, but the Fifth Circuit reversed, noting that LUTPA and the Monopolies Act (the two acts at issue here) give the 
Attorney General, on behalf of the State, procedural capacity to bring suits alleging violations of those Acts. Id. at 836. Although 
the defendants argued that the State's action was a ""disguised private action"" and that the real parties in interest were the 
intervenors, the Fifth Circuit held that the State had procedural capacity to proceed, noting: Here, the legislature has enacted certain regulations concerning commerce in this state and has empowered the Attorney 
General to enforce those laws both criminally and civilly, and to seek redress against violators on behalf of both the state 
and private parties. It is not alleged that these enactments are beyond the sovereign power of the state to control 
commerce within its borders, or that they violate any rights of the defendants which are protected by either the state or the 
federal constitutions. Absent such allegations, the statutes must be presumed valid and must be given effect by the courts 
of the state. Id. at 837. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit reinstated the State as a proper party to the action, allowing it to proceed with its claims 
under LUTPA and the Monopolies Act."

do not have standing under Louisiana state law. The Louisiana Supreme Court, however, denied certification of the state law 
question of whether Louisiana antitrust law grants standing to indirect purchasers of consumer products. Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia have judicially or legislatively ""repealed"" Illinois Brick and provided standing (or 
a right of action) to indirect purchasers under antitrust or consumer protection statutes. Newberg on Class Actions, § 20:12 
Indirect purchaser standing under state antitrust laws (5th Edition). To guard against the concern first raised in Illinois 
Brick, many of these states require courts to ensure the defendants are not subject to multiple liability. Six other states have 
passed partial Illinois Brick repealer statutes. While these states do not permit indirect purchaser suits, they authorize the state 
attorney general to recover if the state itself is injured as an indirect purchaser or to recover on behalf of an indirect purchaser as 
parens patriae. Id. In contrast, thirteen states follow Illinois Brick by either completely barring indirect purchaser suits or by 
providing standing under limited circumstances. Many do so because their antitrust laws are interpreted to be harmonious with 
federal antitrust law. Id. Five states have not addressed the issue. Id."

1855, 155 L. Ed. 2d 889 (2003), the Supreme Court agreed with the First Circuit's conclusion that a statute did not violate the 
extraterritoriality doctrine because ""unlike price control or price affirmation statutes, '[the program] does not regulate the price of 
any out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect,'"" ante at 10 (emphasis added) (quoting Walsh, 
538 U.S. at 669 (quoting Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d 66, 81-82 (1st Cir. 2001))). But if a statute 
does not regulate the price in any out-of-state transaction, it certainly does not regulate prices in out-of-state ""commerce,"" a term 
which the Supreme Court has defined more broadly. Accordingly, Walsh did not consider, much less decide, the relevant issue 
in the instant case—whether a State may regulate an out-of-state ""transaction,"" if that transaction is a component of 
""commerce,"" part of which occurs in the State. "
1269,3," The majority opinion also relies on the Supreme Court's decision in Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 102 S. Ct. 2629, 73 L.

1279,3," Huawei points out that it has not sought preliminary injunctive relief attempting to halt any of the seven remaining actions 
brought by Samsung in China, which seek injunctive relief against Huawei based on its alleged infringement of Samsung's 
SEPs. Opp'n at 8. "
1280,4," As part of this claim, ""Samsung seeks an order enjoining Huawei from pursuing injunctive relief for infringement of patents, 
including those asserted here and in the parallel Chinese actions, that Huawei contends are essential to ETSI and 3GPP 
standards."" Am. Counterclaims ¶ 322."
1280,5," Huawei indicates that it filed the Chinese actions ""simultaneously,"" and that those actions reflect a different date due to the time 
difference between here and China. And it highlights Samsung's acknowledgement that the actions were ""simultaneous[ly]"" filed. 
See Samsung's Answer and Am. Counterclaims ¶ 340 (""Yet simultaneous with its filing of this action, Huawei filed eight actions 
against Samsung in China based on Huawei's declared essential patents, seeking only injunctions as relief for Samsung's 
alleged infringement... .""); id. ¶ 543 (""Around the same time as Huawei filed its Complaint here, Huawei initiated several patent 
infringement actions in China, seeking to enjoin Samsung from making, using, selling, or importing products that practice 3GPP 
standards."")."
1280,6, Huawei has also initiated a rate-setting and royalty payment suit in China. Wang Decl. ¶ 2; Xie Decl. ¶ 22.
1280,7," The parties filed a total of 42 infringement actions in China, one corresponding to each patent, both SEP and non-SEP. Wang 
Decl. ¶ 5. In parallel with those proceeding, all 42 patents underwent invalidation procedures at the Patent Reexamination Board

suits remain between the parties—12 involving Huawei's SEPs and 7 involving Samsung's SEPs. Id. ¶ 8."
1280,8," The Shenzhen court ordered a further continuation of the trial on Samsung's two SEPs, and presumably heard that additional 
evidence on February 27-28, 2018. Wang Decl. ¶ 9. The parties are awaiting decisions in those two suits. Id."
1280,9," Huawei noted that Samsung submitted only the order in case number 840, but actually seeks to enjoin orders issued in both 
case numbers 840 and 816. Wang Decl. ¶ 12 n.1. It indicated that ""[t]he FRAND issues contemplated, evidence and expert

1281,10," As previously mentioned, Samsung references one order from the court, but it actually seeks to enjoin Huawei from enforcing 
two orders issued by the Shenzhen court on January 11, 2018. See supra note 9. "
1282,11," ""RAND"" and ""FRAND"" are ""legally equivalent abbreviations."" Microsoft II, 696 F.3d at 877 n.2."

1284,13," It emphasized that it was not deciding whether the district court's determinations were ""proper"" because those issues were not 
before it on this interlocutory appeal. Microsoft II, 696 F.3d at 884."
1284,14," Huawei also argues that the Shenzhen Order should give rise to collateral estoppel effect when final. Opp'n at 15 (citing Walia

court's finding as a matter of comity."")). I need not address that argument at this time."
1285,15," Huawei notes that Samsung has not ""articulate[d] any likelihood of success on those [antitrust and contractual FRAND] claims 
that could result in final relief enjoining Huawei from obtaining an injunction elsewhere."" Opp'n at 17 n.15 (citing Mot. at 12-17). It 
is true that ""a ballpark, tentative assessment of the merits of the contract dispute is intrinsically bound up with the threshold anti-
suit injunction inquiry... ."" Microsoft II, 696 F.3d at 884. But that does not mean that Samsung must establish a likelihood of 
success on its claims. To the contrary, that inquiry is replaced, in part, by the question of whether this contract action will dispose 
of the Chinese patent actions. See id. Assuming I can decide the breach of contract claims, see discussion infra, this action will 
dispose of those actions in either one of two scenarios—if Huawei's breach of contract claim is unsuccessful, or if Samsung's 
breach of contract claim is successful. One way or the other, this action will resolve the propriety of injunctive relief for the 
parties' declared SEPs."
1285,16," In an added wrinkle, it was necessary to limit this case to a manageable scope. See Civil Pretrial Order (Dkt. No. 208). So I 
will not even be deciding those ""prerequisite"" issues for the parties' entire portfolios of U.S. SEPs. Assuming without deciding 
that I have the authority to set FRAND rates, accepting Samsung's reasoning that each patent must first be evaluated would 
render me unable to decide a FRAND rate based on all of the parties' U.S. SEPs. "
1286,17," In fact, Samsung attacks Huawei's characterization that the Shenzhen court truly considered FRAND issues. See Reply at 2 
(""[The Shenzhen proceedings] focused only on allegations of Samsung's purported 'bad faith' negotiation positions without 
evaluating the size of or justification for Huawei's proposed rates. [citation] Nowhere does the Shenzhen court address whether 
Huawei's original 1.5% rate or variations thereon is FRAND or justified in any objective way.""); id. at 7 (""But the Chinese court 
did not determine the appropriate terms of a worldwide FRAND license—it only made nebulous findings of conduct in the context 
of the Chinese patents that it declared 'complied with FRAND principles' and then granted the injunction.""). "
1287,18," Even though the Shenzhen court evaluated the parties' licensing negotiations, it was not presented with breach of contract 
claims."
1287,19," Huawei phrases the timing as ""simultaneously"" because China is a day ahead of the United States. E.g., Opp'n at 20. "
1289,20," As previously noted, Huawei insists that the actions were filed ""simultaneously."" "
1301,1," This Court notes that, as articulated by the District Court in U.S. ex rel. Griffith v. Conn, 15 U.S.C. § 78u-6 (""Securities 
whistleblower incentives and protection"") also contains language similar to that included in § 3731(b)(2) that, like 28 U.S.C. § 
2416(c), applies only to the government. 117 F.Supp.3d 961 (E.D.Ky. 2015). "

1307,5," This clarification does not exist in the 2007 regulations; however, this does not change the analysis in this paragraph. "
1308,6, See § 1400.109 (2007).
1308,7," The 2007 regulation reads slightly differently but is substantively the same: ""All or any part of the payment otherwise due a 
person on all farms in which the person has an interest may be withheld or be required to be refunded if the person adopts or 
participates in adopting a scheme or device designed to evade this part or that has the effect of evading this part."" "
1323,1," The Court would find that Quality's declaration of non-monetary status, dated November 15, 2017, was filed too close in time to 
the November 20, 2017 removal of this action. NOR; NOR, Ex. B (declaration of non-monetary status), Docket No. 1-1. Most 
courts have held that for a party to receive nominal party status through the filing of a declaration of non-monetary status, 
pursuant to California Civil Code 2924l, removal must occur after the 15-day statutory period has expired without objection. See 
Melamed v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., No. LA CV-15-04314-JAK, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138482, 2015 WL 5923533, at *4

monetary status does not transmute nominal status to Quality."
1323,2," In one case granting a motion to remand, the court noted that Plaintiff challenged Quality's role as trustee, but that case also 
included substantive claims against Quality. See O'Rourke v. Litton Loan Servicing LP, No. EDCV 11-00450-VAP(DTBx), 2011 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 163808, 2011 WL 13225138, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 2011) (holding that ""Plaintiff's allegations against Quality "
1324,," in the FAC include potentially substantive claims and, more critically, challenge Quality's role as the named Trustee. . . . [i]t is 
unclear whether Quality is a nominal defendant in this action."")."
1324,3," Both the Complaint and the FAC make a number of factual allegations involving Quality. FAC ¶¶ 5, 73, 74, 75, 76, 83, 85-86, 
104, 129; Compl. ¶¶ 5, 71-74, 81, 83-84, 102, 127, 183. In one of those factual allegations, Plaintiff challenges Quality's 
authority to act on behalf of the other defendants and questions whether Quality ""validly substituted in as successor Trustee of 
Plaintiff's DOT."" FAC ¶ 86; Compl. ¶ 84. Nonetheless, none of these factual allegations form the basis of a cause of action in 
either the Complaint or the FAC. See generally Compl.; see also FAC. "
1333,1," Neptun does not contest Defendants' assertion that this is a rule-of-reason case, as it is, given the allegedly vertical agreement. 
Accord Leegin, 551 U.S. at 886-88. "
1334,2," In a footnote, Neptun notes that other courts have ""rejected"" the ""single contract theory."" Whatever that means, this Court 
follows the Seventh Circuit, and its holding that, absent allegations that ""a single purchaser represented the entire market for a 
commodity,"" a market definition of one purchaser is ""so narrow"" as to ""discourage [rather] than to protect competition, the ward 
of the antitrust laws."" Havoco, 626 F.2d at 559 & n. 6. "
1335,3," Neptun's attempt to render Havoco ineffective by limiting its applicability to cases in which there is a single losing party is 
unavailing. Havoco's reasoning did not hinge on the fact that there was one injured plaintiff; as later courts have recognized, 
Havoco applies all the same when there are multiple unsuccessful bidders. See, e.g., Triad Isotopes, 104 F. Supp. 3d at 925 
(Havoco foreclosed antitrust claim alleging that ""Defendants have reduced competition in the Chicago-area market by preventing 
legitimate low-cost bidders such as Plaintiff from competing equally"" for a contract) (emphasis added)."
1335,4," Because the points addressed are dispositive, the Court does not address Defendants' other arguments. See Expert Masonry, 
440 F.3d at 345 (questions of immunities should be considered only after determining whether an antitrust claim has been 
adequately asserted); see also, e.g., Alarm Detection Sys., Inc. v. Orland Fire Prot. Dist., 194 F. Supp. 3d 706, 727 n. 8 (N.D. Ill.

1368,1," It appears that Zoove now does business as ""StarStar Mobile."" For the sake of simplicity, the Court will refer to the

the Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss. See Reese v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th Cir. 2011). "
1372,4," In setting forth its reasoning for this ruling, the Court has touched on only those portions of the TAC necessary to dispose of the 
grounds for dismissal argued in the motion: that Sumotext's allegations are equally consistent with unilateral business decisions 
by Zoove and that Sumotext has failed to allege each defendant's role in the conspiracy with adequate particularity. The Court 
need not, and does not, address every issue raised in the parties' briefing, for example, whether Sumotext's group boycott 
theory properly is evaluated as per se unlawful or under the rule of reason. "
1386,1," This factual discussion, as well as the facts noted throughout this opinion, are taken from the parties' statements of undisputed

94:8-9, SDF Ex. 5, ECF No. 206-5 (explaining Thundermist is key source of prospective patients for area hospitals)). 
Thundermist provides care to many people who are poor and historically uninsured or underinsured. Few of Thundermist's 
patients are commercially insured. (See, e.g., SDF Ex. 128, ECF No. 160-29; see also Thundermist Health Center, About Us,,

1387,3," Cerberus Capital Management, LP owns a majority and controlling interest in Steward. (SDF ¶ 9.)"
1387,4," At its inception in 2010, Steward owned six hospitals in Massachusetts; by 2012, it owned eleven hospitals. (SDF ¶ 11.)"
1387,5," Steward's risk-based-contract model also contemplates that Steward would compete to an extent with health insurers ""for the 
same premium dollars and Steward performs some functions traditionally performed by insurers."" (SDF ¶ 16.)"
1387,6, Steward's acquisition of Caritas was finalized in November 2010. (SDF ¶ 13.) 
1388,7," The conditions with respect to Thundermist and SNERCC, however, were later omitted from the May 2011 APA and the first 
seven amendments to the APA. (SDF ¶ 82.)"
1388,8," Such provisions were eventually included in the agreed-upon quality program between Blue Cross and Prime, which eventually 
acquired Landmark. (SDF ¶ 100.) Additionally, ""Blue Cross made changes in its quality program for Prime that it had refused to 
make for Steward, including measuring certain quality metrics against Landmark's past performance and not against national 
averages."" (Id. ¶ 101.)"
1388,9," This ire was best reflected in a letter sent to Steward by the Attorney General. (SDF Ex. 207, ECF No. 204-10.) This letter was 
met with a fiery and pointed response from Dr. de la Torre, Steward's CEO, summarizing what Steward viewed as Blue Cross's 
bad faith tactics and the Attorney General's bias and intimidating behavior. (Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Facts (""SUF"") Ex. 
102, ECF No. 169-33.) "
1390,10," Although Blue Cross had from time to time filed paperwork to initiate the material-modification process during lagging 
negotiations with other hospitals, this move was unprecedented: ""at no time before the Landmark situation had it ever sent out 
letters to subscribers and doctors alerting them that any other hospital was about to be out of network."" (SAUF ¶ 175.) ""Nor had 
Blue Cross ever before stopped payments to a hospital that was still officially 'in network' and instead directed payments to the 
subscribers, leaving to the hospital the difficult burden of collecting the monies due from the patients themselves."" (Id. ¶ 176.) "
1391,11," With forty-four hospitals and 43,500 employees, in fourteen states, Prime has substantial experience in the business of 
reviving distressed hospitals. (SDF ¶ 120.) "
1392,12," To the extent that Steward asserts claims under the Rhode Island Antitrust Act, as opposed to the Sherman Act, this Court, 
like the parties, analyzes the claims together, here and throughout this Opinion (including Steward's conspiracy claims). See R.I. 
Gen. Laws § 6-36-2(b); Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of R.I., 239 F. Supp. 2d 180, 186-87 (D.R.I. 
2003) (HN3[
] ""The provisions of the Rhode Island Antitrust Act mirror those of §§ 1-2 of the Sherman Act . . . and are construed in the same manner as the federal statutes.""). For similar reasons, the Court likewise does not separate out Steward's 
monopsonization and attempted monopsonization claims from Steward's monopolization and attempted monopolization claims. 
See Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., 549 U.S. 312, 320-22, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 
(2007) (HN4[
] ""The kinship between monopoly and monopsony suggests that similar legal standards should apply to claims of 
monopolization and to claims of monopsonization."")."
1392,13," Indeed, one recent law review article recounts various descriptions for the standard to discern exclusionary conduct in a 
manner that this Court can appreciate. See Katharine Kemp, A Unifying Standard for Monopolization: ""Objective Anticompetitive 
Purpose"", 39 Hous. J. Int'l L. 113, 115 (2017) (""The standards applicable to the second element, exclusionary conduct, have 
been variously described as 'vacuous,' 'uncertain,' 'elusive,' 'unclear,' 'unsettled,' 'oxymoronic,' 'in substantial disarray,' 'in dire 
need of correction,' and plagued by 'serious definitional inadequacies.'"" (citations omitted))."
1392,14," Blue Cross's monopoly power - which is ""typically proven by defining a relevant market and showing that the defendant has a 
dominant share of that market"" - has been assumed by the parties for purposes of this motion. Díaz Aviation Corp. v. Airport "
1393,," Aviation Servs., 716 F.3d 256, 265 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing Coastal Fuels of P.R., Inc. v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 
196-97 (1st Cir. 1996))."
1393,15," The Supreme Court in Verizon Commc'ns Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 408, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 
L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004) quoted this passage from United States v. Colgate & Co. but left out the key qualifying language, ""In the 
absence of any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly[.]"" 250 U.S. 300, 307, 39 S. Ct. 465, 63 L. Ed. 992, 1919 Dec. Comm'r 
Pat. 460 (1919). Although this omission perhaps reflects the Supreme Court's narrowing of Section 2 liability in Trinko, the 
qualifying language in Colgate has never been countermanded and appears to remain the standard. "
1394,16," Indeed, at the motion-to-dismiss stage, this Court may well have implied that Steward must meet what the Court described as 
the ""baseline requirements"" of a refusal-to-deal claim: the ""unilateral abandonment of a voluntary course of dealing, forsaking of 
short-term profits, refusal to transact business with the plaintiff even if compensated at rates set by the defendant, and 
concomitant inability to provide a legitimate business rationale . . . ."" Steward I, 997 F. Supp. 2d at 153. After a more careful 
review of the cases, however, the Court is of the view that to require, without exception, each of these factors to make out a 
refusal-to-deal claim (as Blue Cross would have it) is to misconstrue Aspen Skiing and Trinko."
1394,17," A policy reason against requiring the termination of a prior course of dealing is that to do so would be to discourage new, 
mutually beneficial market arrangements, thereby entrenching the status quo. See Olympia Equip. Leasing Co. v. W. Union Tel. 
Co., 797 F.2d 370, 376 (7th Cir. 1986) (Posner, J.) (""[T]he law would be perverse if it made Western Union's encouraging 
gestures the fulcrum of an antitrust violation.""). "
1395,18," Indeed, commentators more-or-less agree that the Supreme Court has chosen not to enunciate an all-encompassing 
framework for refusal-to-deal liability. See, e.g., James A. Keyte, The Ripple Effects of Trinko: How It Is Affecting Section 2 
Analysis, 20 Antitrust 44, 49 (Fall 2005) (""Lower courts . . . have not read Trinko as even attempting to construct a generalized 
predation test or endorsing any particular analysis . . . .""); Robert A. Skitol, Three Years After Verizon v. Trinko: Broad 
Dissatisfaction with the Whole Thrust of Refusal to Deal Law, 6 Antitrust Source 1, 1 (2007) (""Today, after more than three years 
of experience with lower courts' applications of the Court's ruling, Trinko has proven to be among the least satisfactory antitrust 
opinions of the Supreme Court in the past three decades. It has unsettled more than it has settled; made the law less rather than 
more predictable; and exacerbated more than resolved the most contentious controversies in monopolization and attempted 
monopolization cases.""); Edward D. Cavanagh, Trinko: A Kinder, Gentler Approach to Dominant Firms Under the Antitrust 
Laws?, 59 Me. L. Rev. 111, 126 (2007) (""The question of when non-price exclusionary behavior by a monopolist is unlawful is 
complex. The Court in Trinko chose not to articulate a bright-line rule."")."
1395,19," The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals endorsed a similar burden-shifting framework in United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 
34, 58-59, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001). There, recognizing the difficulty in ""stating a general rule between 
exclusionary acts, which reduce social welfare, and anticompetitive acts, which increase it,"" the court laid out a five-step 
framework to decide ""[w]hether any particular act of a monopolist is exclusionary, rather than merely a form of vigorous 
competition."" Id. at 58-59. The Microsoft five-step framework, while not binding, may be useful at trial in framing instructions for 
the jury."
1395,20," Blue Cross's argument rests primarily upon a theory that it did not, as a matter of law, refuse to deal with Steward in violation 
of Section 2. Its legal argument is incorrect for the reasons explained. "
1396,21," As with the factual background presented at the outset of the Opinion, this review of Steward's evidence is not intended to be 
exhaustive. Rather, it simply highlights a sample of Steward's factual presentation, which is sufficient under Rule 56 to raise a 
genuine and material factual dispute requiring a trial."
1396,22," Deposition testimony of Blue Cross employees is enlightening. Blue Cross's CFO Michael Hudson testified: Q. Has it been Blue Cross's experience that when it sends out letters announcing that hospitals are going to be out of 
network after a certain date, that those letters have no impact on usage of the hospital? A. I don't have data that indicate that one way or the other. I would say that the point is, no hospital's ever been out of 
network. . . . But in the time I was there, with no hospital that I was aware of, nor any, you know, significant medical group 
have they ever actually gone nonparticipating. . . . "
1397,," Q. Can you remember any other occasion during your tenure at Blue Cross where, with respect to one of the hospitals in 
Rhode Island, you sent out letters to people saying, On such-and-such a date, Westerly or South County or whoever it 
might be, is going to be out of network? A. Not in the time I worked there. (Dep. of Michael Hudson (""Hudson Dep."") 146:2-16, 148:4-10, SAUF Ex. 9, ECF No. 214-9.) And Shawn Donahue, Blue Cross's Director of Government Relations, had a consistent recollection: Q. So since 2012, has Blue Cross sent out letters to members [**37]  informing them that a hospital will be removed from 
its network? A. . . . I don't recall that I'm aware of any such letters. (Dep. of Shawn Richard Donahue (""Donahue Dep."") at 310:5-9, SAUF Ex. 8, ECF No. 214-8.)"
1397,23," It is of little consequence that Justice Silverstein did not grant the TRO; the important point is that the Special Master 
perceived this move by Blue Cross as a potentially catastrophic economic event."
1397,24," Other evidence the jury may have to consider includes the Attorney General's comment to Steward officials at a negotiation 
session that, Blue Cross ""just do[es]n't want you to do business in this state."" (SDF ¶ 86 (quoting Dep. of Joseph Maher at 
182:21-183:17, SDF Ex. 7, ECF No. 206-7; see also Dep. of Ralph de la Torre at 167:17-23, SDF Ex. 1, ECF No. 206-1 (""The 
message is Blue Cross is going to do anything to keep you out. They literally cut off funds to a hospital that is going bankrupt, 
and the Special Master is powerless to change it. The judge, he's kind of there, kind of not. It's another body shouting a clear 
message that, 'They just don't want you.'""). "
1398,25," The objective of this assessment by Blue Cross was to ""provide recommendations taking into account the relevant 
considerations and how best to strategically proceed."" (SAUF Ex. 71 at 3, ECF No. 214-71.)"
1398,26," And, Steward contends there is more. This loss does not include the pre-material modification costs estimated to be $3 million 
per month, over a period of four to six months. (SAUF ¶ 180; SAUF Ex. 71; Dep. of Mark Waggoner at 184:12-185:3, SAUF Ex. 
11, ECF No. 214-11.). Notably, even Blue Cross's estimate that Steward's proposal would cost $5.4 million is disputed. Steward 
suggests it would have cost $3 million, (see SDF ¶ 97; DSUF Ex. 102, ECF No. 169-33 (de la Torre letter to Attorney General)), 
which, if true, would make this loss even greater. "
1399,27," Steward also offered Blue Cross a lower rate increase for Landmark of 7.4% per year for two years, to be offset by significant 
reductions in Blue Cross's payments to Steward's St. Anne's hospital. (See SDF Ex. 157 at 5, ECF No. 199-12.)"
1399,28," Blue Cross may ultimately be correct that the terms on which it eventually agreed with Prime are relevant for some purpose at 
trial, but the Court need not decide that question on this motion. "
1401,29," The 2012 Rate Approval Conditions provided, Upon written request of an issuer, supported by the hospital's written agreement with the issuer's request, the 
Commissioner may approve exceptions to the index limit for those hospital contracts which the issuer demonstrates, to the 
Commissioner's satisfaction, align significant financial responsibility for the total costs of care for a defined population and 
set of services in manners generally consistent with the alternative Medicare payment mechanisms proposed under the 
Affordable Care Act. Issuers are encouraged to file such requests. (SDF Ex. 43 at 2, ECF No. 206-43.) And former OHIC Commissioner Chris Koller testified: ""[W]e would consider and possibly 
approve exceptions to the index limit and the quality incentives. In other words . . . this was a wide-open area if the hospital and 
the issuer -- the insurer --wanted to do something different."" (Dep. of Chris Koller (""Koller Dep.""), SDF Ex. 26 at 235:16-21, ECF 
No. 206-26.)"
1401,30," One final point: Steward also points to Blue Cross's conduct toward St. Anne's and Morton - two Steward-owned hospitals in 
the area of Massachusetts bordering Rhode Island with which Blue Cross had direct, prior dealings - as evidence of its 
anticompetitive bent toward Steward/Landmark. This too is complicated, but in summary, Blue Cross proposed shifting patients 
who used St. Anne's and Morton to the ""BlueCard"" program, which allowed Blue Cross to pay the reimbursement rates 
negotiated between Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (""BCBSMA"") and Steward, rather than renegotiating new 
contracts with new rates with these hospitals. Blue Cross forecasted that this move would annually save it $3.2 million. But it 
would lose about half of that because the BlueCard Program imposed a hefty administrative fee. (SAUF Ex. 89 at 4; SAUF Ex. 
90.) So Steward offered Blue Cross a better deal: a new direct contract with St. Anne's at the same rates paid by BCBSMA, but 
without the administrative fee. (See SDF ¶ 136.) Steward's proposal offered Blue Cross the added benefit that its Medicare 
Advantage program subscribers could continue to access these hospitals, whereas under the BlueCard program, they could not. "
1402,," (See SAUF Ex. 89; SAUF ¶ 187.) Blue Cross rejected these entreaties as well, arguably forsaking short term profits for the 
purpose of further impeding Steward's effort to break into Rhode Island."
1402,31," Like Steward's refusal-to-deal claim, the Court analyzes Steward's conspiracy counts brought under the Rhode Island Antitrust 
Act together with Steward's conspiracy counts brought under the Sherman Act. (See supra note 13.)"
1402,32," The law of conspiracy, like refusal-to-deal law, is no model of clarity for trial courts trying to make sense of - and apply - its 
standards. See, e.g., 1 John J. Miles Health Care and Antitrust Law § 2A:6 (2018) (""The line between permissible inference 
and impermissible speculation is not clear and never will be.""); William H. Page, Tacit Agreement Under Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act, 81 Antitrust L.J. 593, 594 (2017) (""The outcomes on these motions depend in large part on what the courts think a 
Section 1 agreement is. Even after 125 years of Section 1 litigation, however, the meaning of that fundamental concept remains 
uncertain.""). "
1403,33," Blue Cross is wrong to suggest that the law forbids only outright confessions of anticompetitive animus. See 3B Areeda & 
Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 308. The Seventh Circuit has persuasively addressed this issue: [N]o single piece of the evidence that we're about to summarize is sufficient in itself to prove a price-fixing conspiracy. But 
that is not the question. The question is simply whether this evidence, considered as a whole and in combination with the 
economic evidence, is sufficient to defeat summary judgment. . . . We tried in Troupe v. May Department Stores Co., 20 
F.3d 734, 736-37 (7th Cir. 1994), to straighten out the confusing (and, as it seems to us, largely if not entirely superfluous) 
distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence. The former is evidence tantamount to an acknowledgment of guilt; 
the latter is everything else including ambiguous statements. These are not to be disregarded because of their ambiguity; 
most cases are constructed out of a tissue of such statements and other circumstantial evidence, since an outright 
confession will ordinarily obviate the need for a trial. In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., 295 F.3d 651, 661-62 (7th Cir. 2002)."
1403,34," At the outset, HN17[
] Steward's monopolization and conspiracy claims are not mutually exclusive. The Court rejects Blue 
Cross's suggestion that because Steward argues Blue Cross had unilateral, illicit motives to exclude Steward, it necessarily 
acted ""consistent with its unilateral self-interest"" and thus could not have illegally conspired against Steward. To be clear, 
behavior consistent with unilateral self-interest refers to lawful independent conduct that furthers competition. See In re Flat 
Glass Antitrust Litig., 385 F.3d 350, 360-61 (3d Cir. 2004) (""Evidence that the defendant acted contrary to its interests means "
1404,," evidence of conduct that would be irrational assuming that the defendant operated in a competitive market.""). There is no 
discernable reason why an antitrust plaintiff cannot assert both a unilateral monopolization claim and a conspiracy claim; and 
indeed, the case law supports that these claims can coexist. See, e.g., Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d at 70 (rejecting defendant's 
argument that ""the District Court's holding of no liability under § 1 necessarily precludes holding it liable under § 2.""); United 
States v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 399 F.3d 181, 197 (3d Cir. 2005) (""[A] finding in favor of the defendant under Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act . . . [does] not 'preclude the application of evidence of . . . exclusive dealing to support the [Section] 2 claim.' . . . A 
court's refusal to accept one theory rather than another [does not] undermine[] the claim as a whole . . . [and] the [plaintiff] can 
obtain all the relief to which it is entitled under Section 2 and has chosen to follow that path without reference to Section 1 . . . ."" 
(quoting LePage's, Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 157 n.10 (3d Cir. 2003)))."
1404,35," It appears undisputed that this plan was conceived prior to Steward coming into the picture. This simple fact does not, 
however, defeat the powerful inference gleaned from the evidence that the treat-and-transfer model resurfaced with Steward in 
mind, once it entered the picture. "
1405,36," Although Thundermist is not directly linked to this part of Steward's theory, it does not have to be. See Pinkerton v. United 
States, 328 U.S. 640, 646, 66 S. Ct. 1180, 90 L. Ed. 1489 (1946) (no requirement that each conspirator actively participate in 
each act in furtherance of the conspiracy); United States v. Barker Steel Co., 985 F.2d 1123, 1129-30 (1st Cir. 1993). This 
makes sense, especially in light of the directive that this Court view the evidence in totality rather than isolation. "
1409,37," This is a reference to former State Representative and House Finance Committee Chairman, Steven Costantino, then-
Secretary of Health and Human Services, with significant involvement in the Rhode Island health care and insurance 
marketplace. See Ian Donnis, Steven Costantino Appointed To Head Vermont Insurance Program, Rhode Island Public Radio 
(Feb. 9, 2015), http://ripr.org/post/steven-costantino-appointed-head-vermont-insurance-program . Constantino is now 
commissioner of the Department of Vermont Health Access. See id."
1409,38," For purposes of this motion, the Court need not separately discuss Steward's conspiracy-to-monopolize and conspiracy-to-
monopsonize claims, as the relevant analysis is the same. "
1410,39," Incidentally, the Court rejects Blue Cross's spin on Ocean State Physicians. A close reading of that opinion makes clear that, 
HN20[
] although it may be sufficient, it is not necessary for a plaintiff to lodge a successful antitrust claim in order to prove a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations or interference with prospective contractual relations. Ocean State 
Physicians, 883 F.2d at 1114 (""To be sure, not all business torts are 'exclusionary' under the antitrust laws. In an appropriate 
case, a plaintiff might fail to establish an antitrust violation but still establish that certain torts had been committed."" (citation 
omitted)); see also Kartell v. Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 749 F.2d 922, 933-34 (1st Cir. 1984) (highlighting possibility that Blue 
Shield's conduct - though not an antitrust violation - ""might amount to minor business torts""). "
1413,40," Although, Blue Cross cannot, as a matter of undisputed fact, satisfy that test either. "
1414,41," The Red Team's motto was ""Attack Adapt Advance"" and its logo appears to be a hatchet enclosed within the ""shield"" of Blue 
Cross's emblem. (See, e.g., SAUF Ex. 29 at 2, ECF No. 214-29.)"
1414,42," Blue Cross has its own assignment of meaning to the Red Team documents, which may ultimately persuade the jury. The Red 
Team's September 2012 presentation to Blue Cross's ELT included a disclaimer that, ""Information included in the presentation is 
for illustrative purposes only; names and scenarios do not represent real life situations and parties could be interchanged."" 
(SAUF Ex. 31 at 2.) Despite Blue Cross's proviso, how close the Red Team's analysis tracks in time and substance the reality of 
what Steward was seeking to bring to Rhode Island does more than raise a few eyebrows - it raises a genuine factual dispute 
over the meaning of the Red Team documents to both Blue Cross and this case. Indeed, the Red Team's cast of characters 
included those with major influence in real-life negotiations, including Consultant Maria Montanaro. (See id.) "
1415,43," This section cross-references Steward's previously filed Motion in Limine To Exclude Damages Testimony of Keith Ghezzi and 
Marc Sherman (ECF No. 161). "
1430,1," Dr. Heckman's June 21, 2017 reply report is titled ""Rebuttal Report of Professor James J. Heckman."" To avoid confusion with 
the rebuttal reports submitted on May 16, 2017, however, the Court refers to it as a reply report. "
1433,1," When considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a court assumes the truth of all factual allegations made in the 
complaint. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). The material in this section, then, is

in the text immediately following this footnote. This appears to have been a strategic choice, at least on plaintiff's part. The court 
suggests no impropriety whatsoever—lawyers make comparable strategic decisions all the time. They must, however, live with 
the consequences when the sleeping dog awakens; at least in this court's view, plaintiff has waived the right to mount a post hoc 
challenge to the court's holding as it relates to the extensive body of case law that plaintiff chose not to brief before the court 
issued its decision. "

which the Third Circuit applied the California Motor Transport test in a case involving four underlying legal proceedings."
1450,9," The court in In re Fresh Del Monte Pineapple [*25]  explained its holding this way: Although plaintiffs on this motion target two 
separate lawsuits [as constituting sham litigation], they do not explicitly invoke this alternative [California Motor Transport] test, 
and with good reason, since it does not seem to apply absent a large volume of repeated, consistently baseless litigation. See, 
e.g., Marchon Eyewear, Inc. v. Tura LP, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19628, 2002 WL 31253199, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2002)

1450,10," The court has seen only a single decision, from anywhere in the country, that even remotely lends support to plaintiff's position 
regarding California Motor Transport. See Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Village Supermarkets, Inc., supra. That case provides 
the slenderest of reeds upon which to base its argument, and collapses quickly upon review. In a 2-1 decision, the Hanover 
3201 Realty, LLC majority concluded that the ""sham"" exception to Noerr-Pennington should be analyzed under California Motor 
Transport rather than Professional Real Estate Investors, despite the fact that the underlying petitioning activity involved only 
four legal proceedings (consisting of one lawsuit and three administrative challenges). The majority's entire analysis of the point 
under discussion consists of three sentences: Defendants argue as a threshold matter that the four actions they filed against Hanover Realty are too few to even qualify 
as a pattern or series. We are not convinced. In so concluding, we do not set a minimum number requirement [*27]  for the 
applicability of California Motor or find that four sham petitions will always support the use of California Motor. It is sufficient 
for our purposes that four petitions were filed against Hanover Realty and it alleges that Defendants filed these sham 
proceedings at every opportunity to obstruct Hanover Realty from ""obtaining all necessary government approvals."" "
1451,," Hanover 3201 Realty, supra, 806 F.3d at 181. Suffice it to say that the dissenting opinion is far more persuasive. Id. at 196-201 
(Greenberg, J., dissenting). Among other things, the dissenting judge notes that ""no court of which I am aware has applied 
[California Motor Transport] in circumstances comparable to those here . . ."" Id. at 196."
1451,11," One federal court recently questioned whether California Motor Transport should play any role in the Noerr-Pennington ""sham"" 
exception analysis, in light of Professional Real Estate Investors. See Puerto Rico Telephone Co., Inc. v. San Juan Cable, LLC, 
874 F.3d 767, 771-72 (1st Cir. 2017), petition for cent. docketed, No. 17-1215 (March 1, 2018). In a plurality decision, the 
opinion containing the judgment of the court expresses the view that the holding in Professional Real Estate Investors is 
intended to state a categorical rule for the ""sham"" exception in all Noerr-Pennington cases. ""We find ourselves quite skeptical of 
the notion that a defendant's willingness to file frivolous cases may render it liable for filing a series of only objectively 
reasonable cases . . . Nor is there any pragmatic reason to presume that [Professional Real Estate Investors'] protections for 
nonfrivolous petitioning activity disappear merely because the defendant exercises its right to engage in such activity on multiple 
occasions."" Id. A concurring opinion (which is the controlling opinion on this issue for precedential purposes within the First 
Circuit) agrees that the California Motor Transport ""holistic"" approach is inapplicable on the facts presented, but argues that 
California Motor Transport retains a role to play in the appropriate case, at least in the antitrust context. Id. at 774-77 (Torruella, 
J., concurring). The Puerto Rico Telephone Co. case is noted here solely to show that the relationship between California Motor 
Transport and Professional Real Estate Investors has not yet been resolved with finality at the federal level. In retrospect, it 
appears that the seeds of the disagreement were planted all the way back in Justice Stevens' concurrence in Professional Real 
Estate Investors. See Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 67-76 (Stevens, J., concurring). In this respect, it bears 
mention that notwithstanding his disagreement with ""some of the unnecessarily broad dicta in the Court's opinion,"" Justice 
Stevens's concurring opinion makes it clear that he joined in the Court's ""holding that an objectively reasonable effort to litigate 
cannot be a sham regardless of subjective intent."" Id. at 67. "
1452,12," In light of this point, it is fair to ask why Noerr-Pennington is needed at all in the context of a vexatious litigation case under 
Connecticut law. Noerr-Pennington was developed in the field of antitrust law, to safeguard first amendment ""petition clause"" 
rights in contexts where the underlying liability standard, if given unrestrained application, may threaten those rights. But it would 
appear that the liability standard for vexatious litigation, unlike the liability standard for antitrust violations, already provides that 
same basic protection—a defendant cannot be liable for vexatious litigation unless the underlying litigation activity was 
undertaken without probable cause and with malice. Because the liability standard covers the same basic ground as the 
immunity doctrine, it is not immediately apparent what specific purpose is served by the immunity doctrine in this context. The 
question is not an idle one because the immunity injects an additional layer of complexity into these cases, as the present 
proceedings illustrate. Nor is it enough to say that under Zeller v. Consoli, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine applies to lawsuits for 
common-law vexatious litigation, and this court has no business wondering why. The problem is that a trial court must determine 
at a doctrinal level precisely what (if anything) Noerr-Pennington adds to existing vexatious litigation doctrine in order to 
adjudicate dispositive motions, requests to charge, and countless other matters that require a very particularized understanding 
of the interrelationship between the immunity doctrine and the liability standard. We have clues but no definitive answer 
regarding the precise relationship between the liability standard and the immunity defense. Zeller v. Consoli noted that ""the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine is similar to existing law in Connecticut governing the torts of interference with business relations and 
vexatious litigation,"" 59 Conn.App. at 554 n.5, but did not have occasion to delineate the precise nature of that similarity. One 
other superior court judge has addressed one aspect of this issue, and concluded that the liability standard for vexatious 
litigation does not cover precisely the same ground as the sham exception under Noerr-Pennington. See Diamond 67, LLC v. 
Oatis, No. X03HHD-CV-126030610, 2017 Conn. Super. LEXIS 4487, 2017 WL 5056255, at *20-*22 (Super.Ct., Sept. 18, 2017) 
(Moll, J.). Plaintiff in Diamond 67 argued that a finding in plaintiff's favor on its vexatious litigation claim necessarily defeated any 
Noerr-Pennington defense, on the theory that the doctrinal elements of the tort and the immunity are essentially two sides of the 
same coin. Id., 2017 Conn. Super. LEXIS 4487, 2017 WL at *22. Judge Moll disagreed, stating that the argument ""ignores 
entirely the second prong of the Noerr-Pennington [sham exception], namely, that the vexatious proceedings concealed an 
attempt to interfere directly with the business relationship of a competitor."" This point is correct in that the second prong of the 
""sham"" exception is formulated in specific terms focusing on competitor injury, while the malice element in vexatious litigation 
doctrine is phrased in more general terms, asking if the defendant pursued the underlying proceedings ""for a purpose other than 
that of securing the proper adjudication of the claim on which they are based."" Restatement (Second) Torts §676 (1977); accord 
Connecticut Jury Instructions (Civil), Instruction 3.13-6A. (""A person acts with malice when (he/she) acts primarily for an 
improper purpose—that is, for a purpose other than that of securing the proper adjudication of the claim on which the 
(action/proceeding) is based."") But it seems plausible that the second prong of the sham exception is nothing more than a 
specialized application of the common-law malice standard, for use in the antitrust context—the ""competitor injury"" formulation is 
taken from Professional Real Estate Investors, a Sherman Act case. See 508 U.S. at 60-61. If that is right, then the precise 
""competitor injury"" formulation applicable in the antitrust context is not itself constitutionally compelled, and the common-law 
malice standard can be substituted for it without impairing its function. This returns us to the original question: in a vexatious 
litigation case, what does Noerr-Pennington add that is not already covered by the liability standard itself? The issue has not 
been briefed in the present case, and it does not require resolution here. The beginning of the answer no doubt lies in the fact 
that the liability standard for vexatious litigation and the immunity standard under Noerr-Pennington serve two somewhat 
different functions; the former protects the societal interest in encouraging citizens to seek redress uninhibited by the fear of 
retaliatory litigation, whereas the latter protects first amendment ""right to petition"" values. Whether both of these interests can be 
protected by a single doctrinal safeguard (rather than the double-layered protection of a strict liability standard plus an immunity 
defense) is a question for another day. "
1453,13," The Zeller decision also quotes with approval the following statement of the trial court, which the trial judge made after finding 
that defendants had probable cause to pursue the underlying litigation: ""[Defendants'] motives behind these actions are 
irrelevant to the finding of probable cause."" Id. at 386."
1453,14," It warrants mention that Diamond 67 involved allegations that defendants made misrepresentations of fact to the 
administrative and judicial tribunals hearing the underlying proceedings. 167 Conn.App. at 688-89 (reviewing allegations that 
defendants had told the relevant tribunals, falsely, that the project threatened to pollute a source of public drinking water). The "
1454,," ultimate precedential value of the Noerr-Pennington discussion in Diamond 67 may be clouded due to the fact that the Appellate 
Court does not address whether vexatious litigation claims rooted in allegations of fraud or misrepresentation are subject to a 
specialized version of the ""sham"" exception used in cases involving fraud. See Scott Filmore, Defining the Misrepresentation 
Exception to the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine, 49 U. Kan. L. Rev. 423 (2001) (discussing federal cases ""examining whether 
misrepresentations to the government are protected by the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine or whether such conduct falls into a 
variant of the sham exception known as the 'misrepresentation exception'""); United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 566 F.3d 
1095, 1123, 386 U.S. App. D.C. 49 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (""Defendants' attempt to invoke Noerr-Pennington as protection fails 
because the doctrine does not protect deliberately false or misleading statements""). A similar doctrine, known as the Walker 
Process exception, holds that Noerr-Pennington immunity is unavailable to a party who has made intentional misrepresentations 
to the United States Patent and Trademark Office in the procurement of a patent. See, e.g., S3 Graphics Co. v. ATI Techs. ULC, 
No. CV 11-1298-LPS, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16928, 2014 WL 573358, at *3 (D.Del. Feb. 11, 2014) (explaining rule derived from 
Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S.Ct. 347, 15 L.Ed.2d 247 (1965). The 
""fraud"" exception to Noerr-Pennington, a ""sham"" exception sub-doctrine, is further discussed below at pp. 39-40."
1454,15," More than three months after argument on the pending motion, plaintiff filed a motion for permission to file supplemental 
briefing (as amended, Doc. Entry #205.00, dated March 19, 2018). The supplemental brief contends that plaintiff's opposition to 
summary judgment has been strengthened by the deposition testimony of Nicholas Ahuja taken on March 9, 2018. See Doc. 
Entry #206.00 (brief and exhibits). This court granted plaintiff leave to file its supplemental brief, over objection."
1454,16," See also Professional Real Estate Investors, supra, 508 U.S. at 57. (""We . . . hold that an objectively reasonable effort to 
litigate cannot be sham regardless of subjective intent."") "
1455,17," The Rosenthal article very ably untangles the two strands of the probable cause doctrine using extensive citation to 
Connecticut Supreme Court precedent to illustrate the point. Even the Falls Church decision, which emphasizes the ""purely 
objective"" nature of the probable cause inquiry in Connecticut, acknowledges the critical distinction between the state of 
defendant's knowledge (i.e., the facts he or she knows when making the underlying legal claims), and the defendant's subjective 
intentions or motivations. See 281 Conn. at 99. Only the latter are irrelevant to the probable cause inquiry. Id.; cf. Devenpeck v. 
Alford, 543 U.S. 146, 153, 125 S. Ct. 588, 160 L. Ed. 2d 537 (2004) (""Our cases make clear that an arresting officer's state of 
mind (except for the facts that he knows) is irrelevant to the existence of probable cause"") (citations omitted)."
1455,18," Each of the two aspects of the probable cause inquiry—the requirement of legal tenability and factual tenability—are part of 
the standard formulation of the Connecticut doctrine: ""The legal idea of probable cause is a bona fide belief in the existence of 
the facts essential under the law for the action and such as would warrant a man of ordinary caution, prudence and judgment, 
under the circumstances, in entertaining it."" Wall v. Toomey, 52 Conn. 35, 36 (1884). "
1456,19," Defendants, as the moving parties, bear the burden to demonstrate that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See 
Ramirez v. Health Net of N.E., Inc., 285 Conn. 1, 10-11, 938 A.2d 576 (2008) (""it is the movant who has the burden of showing 
the nonexistence of any issue of fact""). Plaintiff at trial bears the burden of proving that the sham exception applies to the 
petitioning activity at issue. Professional Real Estate Investors, supra, 508 U.S. at 61."
1456,20," The reason for the rule has been explained in various ways. See Armco, Inc. v. S. Rock, Inc., 778 F.2d 1134, 1137 (5th Cir. 
1985) (""[W]ere probable cause left to the jury the rights of defendants might not be sufficiently safeguarded and the bringing of 
complaints would be discouraged . . . [T]he general rule is that suits for malicious prosecution are viewed with disfavor and are 
to be carefully guarded against . . . [M]alicious prosecution cases present situations difficult for the jury to distinguish. There is a 
constant interplay between the original lawsuit and the malicious prosecution suit . . . This difficulty coupled with the reluctance 
of the courts to have potential plaintiffs feel a chilling effect from a possible counter lawsuit sheds some light upon the reason for 
the development of this rule"") (citation omitted). "
1457,21," General Statutes §8-8(n) provides that no settlement of a zoning appeal is effective unless and until a hearing is held and the 
settlement is approved by the court. "
1458,22," Procurement focuses primarily on the allegations in the intervention motion about the potential settlement of the zoning 
dispute by the Board and Procurement, and the potential legal effects of such a settlement. See Pl. Br. at 8-9. "
1459,23," The court need not decide whether plaintiff's ""ignorance"" theory would be sufficient to establish that Ahuja lacked probable 
cause for purposes of satisfying the liability standard for vexatious litigation in Connecticut. The issue here is whether defendant 
is entitled to summary judgment on its Noerr-Pennington defense, and so the only question is whether, on this record, that 
doctrine immunizes defendants as a matter of law."
1459,24," The parties appear to agree that the notice requirements for zoning matters in Stamford are governed by the Charter. See 
Berger MOD 1/4/13, 2013 Conn. Super. LEXIS 49 at *3 (""Unlike most zoning commissions . . . planning and zoning in Stamford 
are governed by 26 Spec. Laws 1228, No. 619, hereinafter referred to as the Stanford Charter (1953, rather than by the General 
Statutes"")."
1459,25," Ahuja also attacked the sufficiency of the notices on the ground that Procurement amended its application shortly before the 
last hearing date, which, according to Ahuja, rendered the prior notices ""misleading"" and obligated the Board to publish a new 
notice reflecting the change. The court has reviewed the parties' respective briefs submitted to the trial court on these subsidiary 
issues, reviewed the key cases, and has read Judge Berger's decision as it relates to these issues. In this court's view, although 
Ahuja's subsidiary legal claims on this point did not prevail, the arguments unquestionably were supported by probable cause as 
a matter of law. "
1460,26," Procurement also argues that Ahuja's notice argument was meritless because she had actual notice of the hearings at issue 
and her son appeared at the hearings on her behalf, thereby waiving any right to claim defective notice. See Pl. Br. at 7-8. Judge 
Berger noted this point in a footnote to his decision, see Berger MOD 1/4/13, 2013 Conn. Super. LEXIS 49 at *3 n.7, but did not 
rest his decision on a finding of waiver. Moreover, ""failure to give newspaper notice [to the general public] is a subject matter 
jurisdictional defect,"" and cannot be waived. Lauer v. Zoning Commission, 220 Conn. 455, 461-62, 600 A.2d 310 (1991). 
Whether or not Procurement's ""actual notice""/waiver argument would ultimately prevail, it certainly does not render Ahuja's 
appeal frivolous. Nothing in Judge Berger's MOD suggests otherwise. "
1461,27," See Ahuja v. Zoning Board et al., No. FST-15-6024272, Return of Record (Entries 41-#106.00-109)."
1461,28," The complaint was not returned to court until January 4, 2015. "
1462,29," No claim is made that Ahuja's procedural default, which resulted from her late return of process to court, itself established a 
lack of probable cause."
1462,30," It is not clear what evidence in 2014 suddenly made the Board majority ""okay"" with a 10% increase in a maximum set just a 
few years before. There may be an answer to this question, of course, but the Board did not identify it, and plaintiff's brief to this 
court does not identify it. "
1464,31," There are limited allegations incorporated in the first six counts regarding what plaintiff labels ""non-petitioning activity,"" see 
below at pp. 53-57, but the court is under the impression that those allegations are intended to establish defendants' motive and 
intentions underlying the petitioning activity. Only the Seventh Count seeks damages allegedly caused by the non-petitioning 
activity. "
1465,32," It also is uncertain whether this particular aspect of defendants' activities caused any harm to Procurement. Neither party has 
briefed the issue, presumably because defendants did not seek summary judgment on that ground. "
1466,33," Whether or not these particular activities were tortious, or otherwise actionable, and whether or not they caused any damages 
to Procurement, are not issues raised in the pending motion for summary judgment, and the court expresses no opinion on 
those questions. "

hire drivers and driver coordinators, is preempted wholly by federal labor law. However, for purposes of this opinion, we discuss the Chamber's labor preemption claims last. The Chamber's NLRA 
preemption claims, in contrast to the Chamber's challenge to the district court's holding regarding state-action immunity, lack 
merit, and do not warrant reversal of the district court's order. As is evident from the Chamber's briefing and presentation at oral 
argument, the Chamber's federal antitrust claims, rather than its federal labor law claims, are the core of its appeal. "
1492,9," The City's argument that the presumption against preemption applies here is misplaced. State-action immunity is a defense to 
preemption. See, e.g., Phoebe Putney, 568 U.S. at 235 (referring to Parker immunity as a ""state-action defense to price-fixing 
claims""). The City did not argue below that the Ordinance does not authorize a per se violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act. 
Accordingly, there is no challenge regarding the issue of whether preemption should or could apply. The only question is 
whether the defense to preemption applies. "
1494,10," We will not separately analyze Revised Code of Washington section 81.72.200, which uses substantially similar language as 
section 46.72.001."
1494,11," The City cites City of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 98 S. Ct. 1123, 55 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1978), for the 
proposition that ""a specific, detailed legislative authorization"" is not required. Id. at 415 (plurality opinion). However, in the same 
decision, the Supreme Court stated that ""an adequate state mandate for anticompetitive activities of cities and other subordinate 
governmental units exists when it is found 'from the authority given a governmental entity to operate in a particular area, that the 
legislature contemplated the kind of action complained of.'"" Id. (emphases added) (quoting City of Lafayette v. La. Power & Light 
Co., 532 F.2d 431, 434 (5th Cir. 1976)). As explained above, the City has not shown that the Washington legislature 
contemplated the kind of anticompetitive restraint established by the Ordinance. "
1495,12," We will not separately analyze Revised Code of Washington section 81.72.210, which uses substantially similar language as 
section 46.72.160. "
1496,13," The City's selective reading of the Supreme Court's decision in N.C. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs v. FTC, 135 S. Ct. 1101, 191 
L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015), does not buttress its position. The Supreme Court observed only that the clear-articulation test, on its own, 
is insufficient to justify state-action immunity: The two requirements set forth in Midcal provide a proper analytical framework to resolve the ultimate question whether an 
anticompetitive policy is indeed the policy of a State. The first requirement—clear [**33]  articulation—rarely will achieve 
that goal by itself, for a policy may satisfy this test yet still be defined at so high a level of generality as to leave open critical 
questions about how and to what extent the market should be regulated. Id. at 1112. In so stating, the Supreme Court made a noncontroversial point: The fact that a state may have clearly articulated a 
policy, and thus satisfied the first Midcal requirement, does not answer key questions about the implementation of the policy—
questions which are addressed by the second Midcal requirement of active state supervision. "
1497,14," Revised Code of Washington sections 46.72.001 and 46.72.160 were enacted in 1996. Revised Code of Washington sections 
81.72.200 and 81.72.210 were enacted in 1984. "
1498,15," The Supreme Court found that ""[t]he second prong of the Midcal test [was] met, for the Government ha[d] conceded that the 
relevant States, through their agencies, actively supervise[d] the conduct of private parties."" S. Motor Carriers, 471 U.S. at 66."
1498,16," ""A regulation is a unilateral restraint when '[n]o further action is necessary by the private parties because the anticompetitive 
nature of [the] restraint is complete upon enactment.'"" Yakima Valley Mem'l Hosp. v. Wash. State Dep't of Health, 654 F.3d 
919, 927 (9th Cir. 2011) (alterations in original) (quoting Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Maleng, 522 F.3d 874, 890 (9th Cir. 
2008)). There, ""no degree of discretion [is] delegated to private actors."" Id. (quoting Costco, 522 F.3d at 890). In contrast, ""[t]he 
'hallmark' of a hybrid restraint is the 'delegation of discretion to private actors.'"" Id. (quoting Costco, 522 F.3d at 898 n.20). ""The 
key distinction is that the regulation leaves a gap in the restraint of trade for private parties to fill at their discretion."" Id. Here, the anticompetitive restraint turns on the discretion of private actors, as the EDR and the driver coordinator agree on set 
prices, which they subsequently submit to the Director for review. We have held a similar anticompetitive restraint was a hybrid 
restraint: Where ""the regulation[] . . . ha[d] the effect of delegating to private parties the discretion to set the posted price to be 
held,"" it was ""an anticompetitive arrangement they could not achieve legally by explicit agreement."" Id. at 930. "
1499,17," The City's citation to Tom Hudson & Associates, Inc. v. City of Chula Vista, 746 F.2d 1370 (9th Cir. 1984), does not persuade 
us otherwise. The case pre-dates Hallie, and the question of whether municipal supervision could satisfy the active-supervision 
requirement was not at issue. See id. at 1374."
1499,18," Because we conclude that the State of Washington, rather than the City, must carry out the active-supervision requirement, 
we do not reach the Chamber's alternative argument that even if municipal supervision could satisfy the active-supervision 
requirement, the supervision is ""insufficiently active."" "
1502,19," Section 14(a) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. § 164(a), contains an express statement of preemption: Nothing herein shall prohibit any individual employed as a supervisor from becoming or remaining a member of a labor 
organization, but no employer subject to this subchapter shall be compelled to deem individuals defined herein as 
supervisors as employees for the purpose of any law, either national or local, relating to collective bargaining. Id. "
1510,1," Plaintiffs' Complaint (DE 1 at Pg ID 1-7, 28-30) attaches a document Plaintiffs title their ""Civil Action Brief."" (DE 1 at Pg ID 8-
27.) The Court entered an Order on March 20, 2018 striking the ""Civil Action Brief"" addendum for the reasons stated on the 
record during the March 15, 2018 hearing, including that the ""brief"" does not conform to the requirements of a pleading and/or 
motion as required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 7 and 8, and E.D. Mich. LR 7.1. (DE 83 at 7.) As the Court further discussed in its March 
20, 2018 Order (DE 83), neither Archie nor Holmes signed the complaint, or any other document filed in this case, and neither 
appeared at the March 15, 2018 status conference and motion hearing, although Plaintiff Ray Smith stated he informed both 
individuals of the hearing and the Court had ordered them to appear, albeit with service problems discussed infra. Plaintiffs Ray 
Smith and Barret Kish are not licensed attorneys and are appearing in pro per, and thus, as discussed more fully infra, neither 
plaintiff can represent Archie, Holmes, or ""Americans for Reform."" "
1511,2," Defendants state that the ""Insurance Defendants"" include: The American Insurance Company, American Automobile Insurance 
Company, The Hanover Insurance Company, Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, American Alternative Insurance 
Corporation, Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company of Michigan, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, Auto-
Owners Insurance Company, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, and USAA Casualty Insurance Company. (DE 45 at 4.) "
1514,3," See also, Evans v. Mercedes Benz Fin. Servs., LLC, No. 11-11450, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 79404, 2011 WL 2936198, at *2 
(E.D. Mich. July 21, 2011) (Cohn, J.) (""Even excusing plaintiff's failure to follow Rules 8(a)(2) and 10(b), a pro se plaintiff must 
comply with basic pleading requirements, including Rule 12(b)(6)."")."
1514,4," Further, there have been significant issues with service on the putative Plaintiffs at the address(es) they have provided. The 
orders, notices, and certificates of service sent to putative Plaintiffs AFR, Archie and Holmes, and even Kish, have been 
repeatedly ""returned as undeliverable."" (See, e.g., DEs 9-12, 22, 49, 50, 52, 54, 55, 59-62, 66, 73.) Smith explained at the status 
conference that the address listed on the docket for putative Plaintiffs AFR, Kish, Archie and Holmes was his ""office address""—
so that all mailing would go through him—but that these Plaintiffs did not reside at that address. (DE 88 at 10-12.) Plaintiffs 
Smith and Kish were then ordered by the Court to file a notice providing the correct: (1) addresses; (2) phone numbers; and (3) 
email addresses for putative Plaintiffs Ferzell Archie and Rush Holmes. (DE 83.) Plaintiff Smith initially filed a document titled 
""motion for change of address,"" seeking to change the address ""for all plaintiffs[,]"" yet again, to one address—19638 Fenelon 
Street, Detroit, MI 48234. (DE 82 (emphasis added).) The Court explained that this ""motion"" does not satisfy the Court's order, 
and Plaintiff Smith subsequently filed a document listing the requested contact information for himself, Kish, and Archie, and only 
a telephone number, but no mailing address, for Holmes. (DE 83 at 7; DE 87.) "
1516,5," The Insurance Defendants and Director McPharlin also discuss a Commerce Clause claim in their motions. (DE 43 at 31; DE 
45 at 9.) However, Plaintiffs' Complaint (DE 1 at Pg ID 1-7, 28-30) does not contain any allegation regarding the Commerce 
Clause. Allegations regarding the Commerce Clause only appeared in Plaintiffs' ""civil action brief"" attached to their complaint, 
which has been stricken. (DE 83 at 7.) "
1518,6," Further, Plaintiffs offer no factual support for the contention raised in their response brief (but not in their complaint) that the 
Insurance Defendants' payment into the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) constitutes state action. The MCCA 
is a nonprofit association of private insurers that, by statute, is required to assess premiums on its member insurers to fund its 
reimbursement obligations and operating expenses for claims which exceed a designated amount. MCL § 500.3104(7)(d). The 
Michigan Supreme Court has recognized that the MCCA is not a state agency, see League Gen. Ins. Co. v. Michigan 
Catastrophic Claims Ass'n, 435 Mich. 338, 458 N.W.2d 632, 638 (Mich. 1990), and Plaintiffs have failed to show how 
Defendants' payment into this fund renders them state actors. "
1523,7," The Insurance Defendants also present compelling arguments that Plaintiffs' antitrust claims are barred by the filed-rate 
doctrine and should be dismissed for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. (DE 45 at 25-29, 32-36.) However, 
because I conclude that Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate they have standing to pursue their claims, their antitrust claims are 
barred by the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and that their complaint fails to state an antitrust claim, the Court need not address these 
additional arguments. "
1538,1," In its opposition, Authenticom cites many facts adduced by the parties at the preliminary-injunction hearing. The Court 
generally finds that those facts do not add anything material to the Complaint, but credits them only to the extent that they are 
relevant and actually consistent with the Complaint's allegations. See Phillips, 714 F.3d at 1020; see also, e.g., Sorrentino v. 
Godinez, No. 12 C 6757, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142962, 2013 WL 5497244, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 3, 2013), aff'd as modified, 777 "
1539,," F.3d 410 (7th Cir. 2015) (not crediting ""new facts"" that were inconsistent with pleadings); Jones v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., No. 11 
C 8326, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51321, 2013 WL 1499001, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Apr. 10, 2013) (not crediting ""new allegations"" that 
formed new bases for proposed relief). The Court also considers the CDK-Reynolds agreements at issue, as they are central to 
the Complaint. See, e.g., Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy Partners, 682 F.3d 687, 690 (7th Cir. 2012). "
1541,2," The Complaint misattributes several quotes to and provisions of the DEA. The Court reviews and credits what the agreement 
actually says, Phillips, 714 F.3d at 1020, as do both parties in their briefs. "
1542,3," There are no allegations (or facts cited) that such access was possible at the time, however, as Reynolds was not engaged in 
integration of other providers' DMSs."
1542,4," CDK makes much of this point (e.g., R. 54 at 8), but does not assert, nor provide judicially noticeable facts showing, what 
portion of CDK's application business these seven applications constituted. "
1543,5," The Complaint is unclear as to whether these agreements were horizontal as well as vertical; that is, it is unclear whether 
Defendants allegedly agreed with one another to have exclusive-dealing and tying arrangements with their respective vendors 
and dealers. Authenticom's opposition brief clarifies that it pursues these theories as vertical in nature. (See R. 59 at 14-15, 26-
34.) "
1544,6," The Court is presently ruling only on the motions to dismiss the as-filed, as-briefed Authenticom Complaint. To the extent later-
filed complaints entail varying allegations and theories, later decisions will account for them. Further, the Court notes that the 
preliminary injunction opinion does not dictate the conclusions of this motion to dismiss ruling, as the Authenticom district court 
indicated. (See Case No. 18-cv-868, R. 209.) "
1546,7," None of this comes close to saying that CDK and Reynolds, respectively, have independent antitrust duties to allow 
Authenticom and other integrators authorization and access. Rather, the question of this case is whether Defendants' refusal to 
grant such authorization and access, and more specifically their attendant blocking, was the result not of a unilateral refusal to 
deal, but of illegal conspiracies and anticompetitive arrangements (like tying or exclusive dealing) recognized by the antitrust 
laws. "
1547,8, Neither party suggests that the quick-look analysis is applicable to any of Authenticom's claims at this stage. 
1548,9," Authenticom also cites Mr. Cottrell's preliminary-injunction testimony, which is consistent with these factual allegations. "
1549,10," Defendants do argue that an alleged ""group boycott"" is a ""factual mismatch"" to this case because they do not deal with 
Authenticom directly and because both Defendants could have unilaterally blocked Authenticom based on their service 
contracts. As Authenticom correctly responds, the first argument misunderstands a group boycott under Klor's, and the second 
fails at this stage because it ignores an inferable reason Defendants would conspire—to prevent unhappy dealers from, for 
example, turning to another DMS provider, as discussed further below. None of this, however, is to say that the per se test will 
ultimately apply to Authenticom's Section 1 conspiracy claim. See, e.g., In re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litig., 856 F. Supp. 
2d 1103, 1122 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (determining that that plaintiff had alleged ""a per se violation of the Sherman Act for purposes of 
surviving a 12(b)(6) motion"" but that the ultimate decision of which test applies ""is more appropriate on a motion for summary 
judgment""). "
1550,11," Indeed, consistent with the Complaint, Authenticom has asserted and submitted evidence that Reynolds's DMS market share 
began to decline after it implemented closed architecture. As the Seventh Circuit recognized during oral argument on the 
preliminary injunction, such a fact makes Defendants' repeated declarations of facial ""implausibility"" dubious."
1550,12," Defendants, correctly, do not argue that Authenticom lacks antitrust injury stemming from this agreement. "
1551,13, Defendants' related Section 2 arguments are addressed further below. 
1552,14," HN16[
] Courts ""routinely rely"" on Section 3 of the Clayton Act cases in assessing exclusive dealing under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Collins v. Associated Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 478 n. 4 (7th Cir. 1988)."
1552,15," Defendants do not contend that the alleged exclusive dealings do not constitute agreements, or that injury is lacking. "
1554,16," Reynolds cites no law for the implied proposition that courts should not examine foreclosure in the aggregate among 
defendants. See, e.g., See Schaefer v. Universal Scaffolding & Equip., LLC, 839 F.3d 599, 607 (7th Cir. 2016) (HN21[
] 
""Perfunctory and undeveloped legal arguments are waived, as are arguments unsupported by legal authority.""). In any event, the 
Court need not address the proposition for the reasons just explained. But see Paddock Publ'ns, Inc. v. Chicago Tribune Co., 
No. 93 C 7493, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13696, 1995 WL 632031, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 25, 1995), aff'd, 103 F.3d 42 (7th Cir. 1996) 
(addressing when aggregation of exclusive deal's anticompetitive effects is appropriate). "
1557,17," Defendants do not challenge whether the alleged aftermarkets are insufficient for failing to exclude reasonable alternatives 
(see R. 54 at 20-23, R. 57 at 29-38)—a question best left for summary judgment anyway. "
1558,18," Authenticom's attempt to walk back that pleading by calling Reynolds's initial blocking as ""tepid"" is unpersuasive. "
1566,1," The SAC also alleges, for the first time, that after it terminated Plaintiff Cable Line, Comcast ""gave Cable Line a 1 year contract; 
this was a complete farce to try to cover up the fraudulent activities, because Comcast never gave Cable Line any work in 
accordance with the contract, nor did Comcast have any intention to give them work."" Id. ¶ 83. This allegation further 
undermines Plaintiffs' contention that their termination was the result of an agreement among all three co-defendants, as 
opposed to an independent decision by Comcast. "
1567,2," The SAC also claims that working conditions for cable installation employees deteriorated after Comcast reduced its number of 
installation subcontractors, but offer no explanation, plausible or otherwise, as to why the working conditions of individual 
workers are relevant to a conspiracy among the Defendants to consolidate the market for cable installation companies. Doc. 71 
¶¶ 99-104, 129. In any event, the allegations of declining working conditions are based upon news articles written in 2016. Id. ¶¶ 
90-96. Plaintiffs, however, were terminated in 2012. Thus, even assuming that employees' working conditions are relevant to the 
alleged antitrust conspiracy, it is unclear how these temporally remote articles would be relevant to the core events at issue. "
1569,3," On the whole, Plaintiffs' brief is heavy in rhetoric and low in substance. In place of legal arguments, the brief is filled with 
hyperbolic rhetorical questions or melodramatic rants. See, [*30]  e.g. Doc. 90 at 35 (asserting that Comcast had a practice of 
lying to government regulators: ""This is Comcast's modus operandi: to run over any company, destroy competition and make 
misrepresentations, believing that it can get away with anything because Comcast has too much money for anyone to be able to 
go against it""); id. at 4 (""Why else would Comcast keep Decisive and Vitel as subcontractors or business partners when they 
were both involved in the illegal activities, unless they had some sort of deal going on?""); id. at 24 (""The Court should look at the 
agreement or conspiracy as an ordinary prudent person using common sense. Who would partner with two dishonest companies 
that stole hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment, manipulated your performance metrics system, and caused you to be 
fined by the SEC or report the fraudulent representations or misrepresentations to shareholders? No rational company would 
partner with companies like this unless there were some sort of illegal agreement.""). At best, these dubious ""arguments"" reveal a deep confusion over the legal basis for Plaintiffs' claims. At worst, they may be a 
ploy to distract from Plaintiffs' inability to shoulder their burdens of pleading antitrust injury and anticompetitive effects under a 
rule of reason analysis. In any event, Plaintiffs' counsel would do well to focus their briefing on substantive legal arguments in 
the future. "
1570,4," Similarly, the SAC also alleges, for the first time, that Comcast had bought up other cable providers ""[i]n the very late 
1990's...into the early 2000's"" and used a restrictive covenant to block a potential sale of Plaintiff ""in the early 2000's."" Doc. 71 
¶¶ 10, 15. However, the fact that Comcast is a large cable provider company does not, by itself, suggest that it had any reason 
to engage in a conspiracy to increase cable installation companies' rates. In any event, the remote events from the early 2000's 
have little bearing on Plaintiffs' termination in 2012. "
1574,1," The Court means no disrespect to the parties by using their first names. This nomenclature is simply a matter of convenience 
due to the overlap in last names. "
1575,2," The Lunardis' settlement was later reviewed and approved by the Commission on May 14, 2015. Id. ¶ 127, Ex. 13. As part of 
the settlement, the Lunardis and Garden City admitted to certain facts and violations, agreed to certain conditions for future 
operations, and paid a fine of almost $2 million. Id., Ex. 11. "
1578,3," Additionally, the third party's $55 million offer was a bona fide offer that triggered Eric's obligation under the Buy/Sell 
Agreement to notify the Lunardis and provide them a right of first refusal, as two arbitrations later confirmed. ECF 18-3, Exs. 1-5. "
1580,4," Torngren also raises Noerr-Pennington as a ground for dismissal. Although the Court need not reach the issue because 
Torngren's conduct was performed as part of his prosecutorial function, the Court notes that the conclusions reached below as 
to the Lunardis and Deborah would apply equally to Torngren. "
1582,5," The FAC also repeats the allegation that Torngren encouraged Roberts to secure Eric's confidential information by illegal 
means. Id. ¶¶ 148, 153-54. Not only does Eric fail to identify any confidential information that was illegally taken from him or 
introduced during the proceeding, but his story is contradicted by the interview transcript attached to his FAC. As noted above, 
Roberts was asked to provide non-proprietary information from a server that Roberts maintained. Id., Ex. 21. "
1584,6," Eric relatedly has not shown ""the existence of an agreement or meeting of the minds"" between Torngren, the Lunardis, and 
Deborah ""to violate constitutional rights."" Crowe v. County of San Diego, 608 F.3d 406, 440 (9th Cir. 2010) (citation omitted)."
1584,7," In his opposition, Eric also suggests that Torngren defied the Commission's decision, which Eric characterizes as ""requiring the 
Lunardis to disburse Plaintiff's income to him as a 50% shareholder in a [sic] 'S' corporation."" ECF 62 at 18. But the cited portion 
of the decision provides only that ""[California Business and Professions Code] [s]ection 19882 controls any denial or revocation 
of license for a shareholder in a corporation. [Peter did] not stand to receive any withheld distributions and [Eric]'s shares would 
be subject to sale; not automatic transfer to remaining shareholders."" FAC, Ex. 18 at 11 n.6. "
1589,1," In his papers, Giraudo made this point only obliquely. See Giraudo Response (dkt. 319) at 17. He pressed it at oral argument 
on May 7, however. While the argument is probably waived, the Court considers it on the merits because doing so does not 
prejudice the government, given the outcome of the analysis. "
1590,2," Giraudo also raises factual objections to the government's treatment of his involvement with alleged co-venturers on particular 
transactions. Those objections are addressed below, along with his other factual objections. See infra Part II.A.1.c."
1590,3," All of the evidence cited in this order comes in the form of summaries of witness interviews prepared by the government. 
Accordingly, all quotations are of the government's summaries, and do not necessarily reflect the witnesses' actual words. "
1591,4, Dkt. 307-10 at 8. 
1592,5," See U.S.S.G. 2R1.1 note 3 (""The loss from price-fixing exceeds the gain because, among other things, injury is inflicted upon 
consumers who are unable or for other reasons do not buy the product at the higher prices.""). "
1593,6," The arguments Giraudo included in his reply to the government's response to his sentencing memorandum regarding specific 
transactions are waived. Giraudo had the evidence on which the government based its calculation for three years, and had the 
specific list of transactions the government considered for three months. The government also filed the list as an attachment to 
its own sentencing memorandum, which Giraudo could have addressed in his response. In any event, even if the Court were to 
exclude all of the transactions that Giraudo lists in his three briefs, the volume of commerce would still be well over $10,000,000. "
1603,1," Plaintiffs Todd Whaley, Miss Sarah LLC, Robert Seitz, and South Bay Wild, Inc., have settled with Defendants. The parties 
have agreed that these Plaintiffs should be dismissed with prejudice. ECF No. 243. "
1604,2, Formerly designated as Rule 56(f) until Rule 56 was amended in 2010. 
1609,3," Rankin and Whaley apparently hold quotas, while Boardman does not. See Defs.' Reply 15. "
1613,1," A federal court may consider a foreign jurisdiction's law under Rule 44.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Both sides 
discuss various Canadian laws in their briefs and neither side objects to the court's consideration of that law. "
1615,2," In antitrust law, a group boycott is ""an agreement to pressure a supplier or customer not to deal with another competitor."" 
Reading Int'l, Inc. v. Oaktree Capital Mgmt. LLC, 317 F. Supp. 2d 301, 318 (S.D.N.Y. 2003). Mountain Crest does not say when 
the alleged boycott started or how long it lasted. "
1616,3," Mountain Crest's second amended complaint is a sprawling 93 pages and includes numerous allegations about what it views 
as unfair practices by BRI and defendants. For example, Mountain Crest alleges that BRI consistently understocks brands of 
beer that defendants do not own. Dkt. 49, ¶¶ 100-02, 113, and 173-75. But both sides have assumed in their briefing that 
Mountain Crest's claims under the Sherman Act are limited to restrictions on selling larger packs of beer and pack-up pricing, so 
the court has made the same assumption. "
1617,4," American Banana Co. v. United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347, 29 S. Ct. 511, 53 L. Ed. 826 (1909), is sometimes described as a case 
in which the Supreme Court applied the act of state doctrine to an antitrust claim. E.g., Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of Am., 
N.T. & S.A., 549 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir. 1976); 1B Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 274b, at 385-86 (4th ed.) (stating that American 
Banana applied act of state doctrine to hold that ""a seizure by a foreign government of the plaintiff's properties could not support 
an antitrust claim against the private party who allegedly induced the government to take the action""). But the Supreme Court 
has rejected that reading. Kirkpatrick, 493 U.S. at 407-08 (""American Banana was not an act of state case.""). "
1618,5," Both sides assume that the act of state doctrine applies the same way to a provincial government as to the national 
government, so the court has made the same assumption. "
1631,1," In its October 2015 ruling, the district court noted the doctor's amended petition did not specify whether he was advancing a 
claim under section 553.4 (Restraint prohibited) or 553.5 (Monopoly prohibited) but clarified it was the latter in his partial 
resistance to LCA's motion to dismiss. "
1632,2," Congress passed the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7, in 1890 to preserve ""free and unfettered competition as the rule of 
trade."" See Molly Ebraheim, Antitrust and Hospital Mergers: Uniqueness and Consistency in Market Definition Analysis, 48 U. 
Tol. L. Rev. 337, 343 (2017). In 1914, Congress passed additional antitrust laws, including the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18, to 
address certain mergers and acquisitions. Id. ""Exclusive dealing arrangements that involve commodities may be challenged 
under either the Sherman Act or the Clayton Act, while those that involve a service or something other than a commodity may be 
challenged only under the Sherman Act."" 54 Am. Jur. 2d Monopolies and Restraints of Trade § 141 (2018) (citing Stop & Shop 
Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 239 F. Supp. 2d 180 (D.R.I. 2003)."
1632,3," Mueller rejected a claim under section 553.4, which provides: ""A contract, combination, or conspiracy between two or more 
persons shall not restrain or monopolize trade or commerce in a relevant market."" Section 553.4 is the counterpart to section 1 
of the Sherman Act. Id. at 567-68. Because section 1 applies to concerted action that restrains trade, federal courts have held 
that it requires two or more defendants. Energy Conversion Devices Liquidation Tr. v. Trina Solar Ltd., 833 F.3d 680, 684 (6th 
Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 1582, 197 L. Ed. 2d 705 (2017)."
1632,4," Because Dr. Nemickas named only LCA in his antitrust action, and was unsuccessful in adding the two Cedar Rapids hospitals 
as defendants, he is unable to pursue a restraint-of-trade claim. See Iowa Code § 553.4 (requiring proof of a ""contract, 
combination, or conspiracy between two or more persons""); see also Energy Conversion Devices Liquidation Tr., 833 F.3d at 
684 (interpreting parallel federal provision to require two or more defendants). And we are skeptical that he could obtain relief 
under his section 553.5 claim—naming LCA as a single monopolist—given his concentration on LCA's exclusive contracts with 
the hospitals. In similar suits, the excluding party, the hospital or surgical center, is consistently named as a defendant. See, 
e.g., Minnesota Ass'n of Nurse Anesthetists v. Unity Hosp., 208 F.3d 655, 657 (8th Cir. 2000); BCB Anesthesia Care, Ltd. v. 
Passavant Mem'l Area Hosp. Ass'n, 36 F.3d 664, 665 (7th Cir. 1994); Balaklaw v. Lovell, 14 F.3d 793, 795 (2d Cir. 1994); Bhan

court's dismissal on the standing question, we need not decide if Dr. Nemickas otherwise states a claim upon which relief can be 
granted. "
1633,5," In Comes, our supreme court declined to follow federal precedent on whether indirect purchasers had standing to sue under 
the Iowa Competition Law. Id. at 445-49. The Comes court did so because: (1) the language of section 553.12 supported indirect 
purchaser standing; (2) uniformity only requires a uniform standard of conduct under state and federal law, not a uniform rule as 
to who may sue; and (3) most federal courts allowed indirect purchasers to sue at the time the Iowa Competition Law was 
enacted in 1976. See id."
1633,6," Iowa Code section 553.2 states: This chapter shall be construed to complement and be harmonized with the applied laws of the United States which have 
the same or similar purpose as this chapter. This construction shall not be made in such a way as to constitute a delegation 
of state authority to the federal government, but shall be made to achieve uniform application of the state and federal laws 
prohibiting restraints of economic activity and monopolistic practices. "
1634,7," Because we conclude the district court properly dismissed the petition on these standing grounds, we need not reach the 
question whether Dr. Nemickas correctly identified the relevant anesthesiology market as the two hospitals in Cedar Rapids. "
1635,8," LCA did not resist addition of the tortious interference claim. The district court addressed the merits of that claim, as does LCA 
on appeal. Accordingly, we reach the merits of this claim later in this opinion."
1635,9," Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 1.444 states: If a party is required or permitted to plead further by an order or ruling, the clerk shall forthwith mail or deliver notice of such 
order or ruling to the attorneys of record. Unless otherwise provided by order or ruling, such party shall file such further 
pleading within ten days after such mailing or delivery; and if such party fails to do so within such time, the party thereby 
elects to stand on the record theretofore made. On such election, the ruling shall be deemed a final adjudication in the trial 
court without further judgment or order; reserving only such issues, if any, which remain undisposed of by such ruling and 
election. "
1640,1," Two Defendants—Arlington Lens Contact Services (AC Lens) and National Vision (NV)—have tentatively settled with the 
Plaintiffs and are not part of the current proceedings. "
1641,2," The court's recitation of facts throughout this order is based on well-pleaded factual allegations in Plaintiffs' complaint, as well 
as reasonable inferences drawn from those facts. The court treats those facts as true for purpose of analyzing the motions under 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)."
1641,3," In November 2016, contact lens purchasers J. Thompson and William Duncanson filed an antitrust complaint on behalf of 
themselves and others similarly situated against 1-800 Contacts, Inc. (1-800) and Vision Direct, Inc. Around the same time, other 
consumers filed similar but independent complaints, either here or in other federal districts. Given the similarity of the claims, the 
cases were transferred and consolidated. On May 31, 2017, the consolidated Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint—the 
Consolidated Amended Complaint (CAC)—against 1-800 and Vision Direct, as well as Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., Walgreen 
Co., Luxottica Retail North America, Inc., AC Lens, and National Vision. "

Supp. 3d 1019 (N.D. Cal. 2015), to support their argument that Plaintiffs' injury is too remote from the advertising practices 
alleged. Those cases are distinguishable because the consumers in those cases were indirect purchasers who did not 
participate in the markets being restrained. See Qualcomm, 603 F. Supp. 2d at 1299 (consumers ""alleged injury at least three 
levels removed from any alleged misconduct by Qualcomm.""); Google, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 1028 (finding alleged injury too remote

1646,11," Defendants fault the Plaintiffs' reliance on the Brown Shoe indicia. ""Unable to provide any factual allegations that support a 
traditional economic analysis, Plaintiffs turn to the Brown Shoe 'practical indicia.' But merely ticking off a handful of Brown Shoe 
factors is meaningless if those factors have no bearing on consumers' likely response to an increase in price."" (Vision Direct 
Reply at 11 (internal citation omitted).) Significantly, the two cases Defendants cite to support their statement are, at a minimum, 
procedurally distinguishable because the courts were reviewing motions for summary judgment. See Reifert v. S. Cent. Wis. 
MLS Corp., 450 F.3d 312, 320 (7th Cir. 2006) (holding that although Brown Shoe indicia were ""important considerations, . . .

1666,6," Agreements within the scope of the Sherman Act may be ""'horizontal,' i.e., 'agreement[s] between competitors at the same 
level of the market structure,' or 'vertical,' i.e., 'combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure, e.g., 
manufacturers and distributors.'"" Anderson News v. Am. Media, 680 F.3d 162, 182 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. 
Topco Assocs., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972)). Thus, an agreement among several general 
contractors, or between labor unions, might impose a ""horizontal"" restraint; but an agreement between a labor union, which 
supplies labor, and a general contractor, which purchases it, could not. In the latter example, the union and the contractor are 
part of a ""vertical chain"" and do not ""compete on the same horizontal plane"" within the market. ASE II, 815 F.3d 43, 61, 62 (1st 
Cir. 2016)."

(Stapleton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That the Ironworkers have nonetheless failed to show any evidence of 
agreement among the employers here is therefore telling. "
1667,8," The fund was intended to ""defray the costs of the Association's bargaining with the Union on behalf of its members and 
administering their collective bargaining agreements."" Premier, 814 F.2d 358, 370 (7th Cir. 1987). "

Mot. Hr'g Tr. (Jan. 24, 2018), Doc. No. 148, at 69. "
1669,10," Moreover, even if membership in an association sufficed, the Carpenters signed CBAs with multiple employers' associations, 
none of which are alleged to have been in horizontal agreements with one another. The amount of the market that would have 
been covered by any one hub-and-spoke agreement with a single employers' association would be too small to amount to a per 
se violation of the Sherman Act. Cf. Premier, 814 F.2d at 371 (holding that per se treatment was appropriate because ""[t]he 
agreement . . . affected 100 [percent] of an economically significant market"")."
1669,11," The Ironworkers argued at the hearing that ""a group exclusive dealing arrangement . . . is an oxymoron because a group 
exclusive dealing arrangement is the definition of a concerted refusal to deal."" Mot. Hr'g Tr. (Jan. 24, 2018), Doc. No. 148, at 23-
24. That reasoning begs the question, however, for it assumes that CBA clauses entail horizontal agreements among the 
employers. I already have determined that the Ironworkers have not supported that assumption with evidence."
1669,12," With respect to the first proposed criterion, a seller also might contract to sell exclusively to one buyer (as when a parts 
supplier agrees to sell only to one automobile manufacturer). "
1670,13," Risibly, the Ironworkers also suggest that the CBA clauses are not exclusive dealing agreements because the general 
contractors and the unions are not in ""a 'business' relationship, but rather, a 'labor' relationship."" Suppl. Mem. Opp'n Mot. Summ. 
J., Doc. No. 116, at 11. That the unions are not for-profit businesses is irrelevant; for purposes of the various entities' location in 
the market, the unions ""supply"" labor and the general contractors ""purchase"" it. Furthermore, if the unions are conceived of as 
""labor"" rather than ""business"" entities, then it is not clear why they should be subject to antitrust scrutiny at all (which was, in 
fact, the Carpenters' argument in contending that the CBA clauses fell within the non-statutory exemption). "
1671,14," Previously, at the outset of the case, I denied the Carpenters' motion to dismiss the union plaintiffs' claims for lack of antitrust 
standing and concluded that the latter had ""stated an injury that is recognized under antitrust law."" 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
37523, 2012 WL 951793, at *14. With the benefit of a fuller record, however, I ""revisit the issue on summary judgment."" See IM 
Partners v. Debit Direct, 394 F. Supp. 2d 503, 521 n.12 (D. Conn. 2005); cf. Dorking Genetics v. United States, 76 F.3d 1261, 
1271 (2d Cir. 1996) (noting that a 12(b)(6) movant ""may . . . ask the district court to revisit [an] issue on summary judgment after 
discovery""). "
1672,15," I held to the contrary in response to the motion to dismiss because the Carpenters had merely argued that the unions' ""harm[s] 
[were] too indirect to support standing."" See 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 37523, 2012 WL 951793, at *14. As discovery has now 
shown, however, the problem is not that the unions' harms are indirect; it is that they are only are only harms to competitors, 
rather than to competition. "
1673,16," In their Answers to Interrogatories, the Carpenters offered ""reduce[d] [ ] labor costs"" due to lower ""[w]age and benefit rates"" as 
one reason that general contractors agreed to the restrictive clauses with the Carpenters. See Deak Rep., Ex. 5 to Carroll Aff., 
Doc. No. 88-5, at 73. As the leading antitrust treatise notes, ""[e]xclusive contracts are often ways of organizing the market to 
encourage more competitive pricing than might otherwise occur,"" such as by ""grouping purchases together into a single contract 
in order to reduce the costs of using the market."" XI Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1811, at 144. "

access to downstream [purchasers],"" the employers. See XI Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp et al., Antitrust Law ¶

1680,1," Docket references here are to 16-MD-2704, insofar as many filings pertinent to the motion to amend have not been filed on the

supporting submissions, as well as letters relating to discovery disputes and to counsel's monthly status calls with the Court, on 
the dockets in both 16-MD-2704 and 16-MC-2704. "
1682,2," The balance of the July 28, 2017 decision involved issues not relevant here. On defendant-specific grounds, the Court 
dismissed plaintiffs' claims against three defendants or groups: a Dealer (HSBC Bank PLC), an inter-dealer broker (ICAP Capital 
Markets LLC), and an entity (TradeWeb Markets LLC) which allegedly first refrained from opening an all-to-all IRS platform and 
later opened such a platform but kept it minimally active. See generally In re IRS, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 483-487. The Court also 
rejected defendants' argument that the Dodd-Frank statute impliedly precluded plaintiffs' § 1 claims, id. at 495-498, and resolved 
challenges to state-law claims, id. at 498-501. "
1684,3," Javelin and Tera have not moved to amend their Second Amended Complaints. The Court hereafter uses ""plaintiffs"" to refer to 
class plaintiffs."
1684,4," The Court had allowed more limited discovery, after July 21, 2010, into the ""Dealers' communications and collaboration in 
connection with operating Tradeweb."" Id. This was to enable plaintiffs to test whether Tradeweb, in which Dealer personnel had 
served as directors or officers, had provided a forum in which Dealers had conspired to further the 2013-2016 conspiracy. Id. at 
6-7. "
1688,5," See CFTC Clearing Rule at 74,323 (IRS clearing requires ""startup and ongoing costs relating to technology and infrastructure,

1689,6," See CFTC Clearing Rule, at 74,324 (stating in December 2012 that, ""[i]n response to . . . concerns about legal documentation 
and operational readiness, the Commission. . . clarified that compliance with the clearing requirement will not be required for any 
swaps until March 11, 2013"")."
1689,7," In contrast to the 2013-2016 allegations, the owner-operators of the two platforms allegedly quashed in earlier years do not join 
in this lawsuit. (CME is a non-party. Tradeweb was sued in the SAC but dismissed; the PTAC would restore the claims against 
it.) The PTAC does not allege that, prior to Dodd-Frank, concrete specifications were ever developed for a CME or Tradeweb all-
to-all trading platform for IRSs. "
1690,8," In a separate bid to avoid Rule of Reason review, the PTAC labels the Tradeweb joint venture a ""naked restraint"" that was the 
product of collusion between the Dealer investors and Tradeweb itself On this basis, it alleges that Tradeweb's decisions after 
Project Fusion to forgo a plan to open an all-to-all IRS platform warrant per se condemnation. PTAC ¶ 277. This label 
notwithstanding, on the facts pled, as under the SAC, Tradeweb was not a horizontal competitor of the Dealers, as ""it was a 
provider of electronic trading platforms, not a market maker."" In re IRS, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 468. The label ""naked restraint,"" 
which antitrust law uses in connection with horizontal competitors, therefore, does not fit. "
1691,9," The Defendants filed the Magellan Agreement under seal pursuant to the protective order governing confidential material 
entered in this case, see Dkt. 300, and this Court's order, Dkt. 351. "
1692,10," As noted above, the PTAC abandons the SAC's express claim of a Tradeweb plan to introduce such a platform in lieu of a 
generalized claim of ""discussions"" of such among its executives. Id. ¶ 223. The PTAC does not allege any plan by Bloomberg 
prior to Dodd-Frank to enter this space. Rather, it alleges that in 2011—a year after Dodd-Frank mandated SEF trading—a 
Bloomberg executive stated that Bloomberg was ""very ready to commence SEF trading."" PTAC ¶ 117. "
1693,11," The above facts preclude the claim (PTAC ¶ 152) that the joint negotiations (id. ¶ 156) with respect to which the Dealers 
collaborated were an illegitimate sham that offered no efficiency enhancements so as to make Rule of Reason review 
unwarranted. That the Dealers had, and coordinated privately with, common Cleary Gottlieb counsel, took common positions in 
the joint negotiations, and sought governance rights in the CME clearinghouse, id. ¶¶ 152-157, 161-167, 183, 186, likewise do 
not signal a sham. Under the circumstances pled, seeking ""governance"" of the platform was understandable given each Dealer's 
interest in control of the new clearinghouse. The Dealers were being asked to take an investment stake in the clearinghouse, 
stood to receive potential returns from the clearing services the clearinghouse offered, and could face financial exposure in the 
event the clearinghouse defaulted. See, e.g., PTAC ¶¶ 98, 100, 106. "
1696,12," The PTAC, finally, alleges that the Magellan Agreement contains a non-disclosure clause which prevented outsiders from 
discovering its secret ""poison pill provision."" PTAC ¶ 199. In fact, as noted, the Agreement does not contain a poison pill 
provision. Depending on the facts, a non-disclosure agreement can serve as an affirmative act of concealment. Compare In re 
Copper Antitrust Litig., 436 F.3d 782, 790-791 (7th Cir. 2006) (nondisclosure agreement supported equitable tolling), with GO 
Comp. v. Microsoft Corp., 508 F.3d 170, 179 (4th Cir. 2007) (finding claim time-barred and rejecting claim that nondisclosure 
agreements kept anti-competitive activities secret). Here, however, the Magellan agreement is facially benign, post-dates the 
alleged plot to terminate an all-to-all IRS trading platform, and governs a separate subject matter: the operation of and financial 
stakes of participants in CME's separate clearing platform. A non-disclosure clause in the agreement, therefore, lends no 
support to plaintiffs' claim of concealment. "
1698,13," This would have been so even if, improbably, all defendants had immediately acceded to the entire PTAC, such that 
negotiations over the scope of document production could have begun shortly after the PTAC's filing on February 21, 2018. A 
more realistic assumption for the start date of any negotiations over post-PTAC document production parameters is the date on 
which the Court realistically could have resolved the parties' dispute as to the viability of the PTAC's 2008-2012 claims. It took 
the Court two months after argument to resolve the motions to dismiss the SAC. As to the PTAC, the Court, on May 10, 2018, 
issued a bottom-line order notifying counsel as to how it had determined to resolve the motion for leave to amend and that a 
decision (this) would follow. Dkt. 386."
1698,14," One discrete dispute—only recently briefed—remains in the process of resolution as to cellphone records of Dealer 
employees, sought by plaintiffs. See Dkt. 384. The Court has also recently received briefing on, and resolved at a hearing, a 
dispute as to discovery plaintiffs have propounded on an inter-dealer broker. See Dkt. 382. "
1699,15," The time spent by the Court resolving the discovery disputes alone—which was substantial—gives the Court insight as to the 
formidable amount of time that counsel for each party expended on the range of discovery matters summarized above."
1699,16," The pre-Dodd-Frank topics as to which the Court substantially or wholly precluded discovery as irrelevant or marginally so 
included CME's Swapstream platform, see Dkt. 322, at 4, Project Fusion, id. at 6, SwapClear's rulebook restrictions, id. at 8-9, 
and the Dealers' activities with respect to OTCDerivNet, SwapClear, and LCH.Clearnet, id. at 12-13. "
1700,17," In a status call with counsel held May 18, 2018, the Court, on consent, extended the substantial completion deadline until June 
29, 2018. "
1703,18," For avoidance of doubt, although the case law identifies counsel's bad faith as a basis to deny a motion for leave to amend, 
the Court has chosen not to reach the issue of whether the conduct in question is properly termed such. The Court's judgment is 
that the finding of gamesmanship, on the facts here, is sufficient to support denial of leave to amend and that no productive 
purpose would be served by inquiring further into bad faith. The Court's discussion of gamesmanship above, therefore, should 
not be taken as reflecting a finding of bad faith with respect to any firm or individual, as the Court has not so found. The Court is 
further deeply respectful of the vigor and top quality of plaintiffs' counsel's overall representation of the putative class in this 
case, and is confident that this episode will prove aberrational. "
1704,19," In light of these findings, and the distinct procedural posture of this case, the cases on which plaintiffs rely are far afield. 
Pasternack v. Shrader, 863 F.3d 162 (2d Cir. 2017), held that ""the denial of leave to amend, based solely on delay and litigation 
expense, was an abuse of discretion."" Id. at 174. Unlike in Pasternack, the Court's findings here of delay and prejudicial 
incurring of expenses are not generalized but are solidly anchored in a detailed record and the Court has also found 
gamesmanship. Further, although in Pasternack ""essentially no discovery had been undertaken,"" here, counsel had engaged in 
more than six months of intensive and expensive negotiations and litigation over discovery (as well as initial rounds of document 
production) which, along with the scheduling order, the amendment would subvert. Also inapposite is Loreley Fin. (Jersey) No. 3 
Ltd. v. Wells Fargo Sec., LLC, 797 F.3d 160 (2d Cir. 2015). The Second Circuit there reversed a denial of leave to amend 
because the district court had put plaintiffs to ""a Hobson's choice: agree to cure deficiencies not yet fully briefed and decided or 
forfeit the opportunity to replead."" Id. at 190. The Circuit held that the district court had abused its discretion under Rule 15 to 
deny leave to amend in finding that a plaintiff had forfeited its right to amend by standing by its allegations after defendant's 
objections were previewed at an informal pre-motion conference. Nothing of the sort happened here: Prior to the PTAC, plaintiffs 
filed three successive complaints, including an SAC filed after defendants filed a proper motion to dismiss an initial amended 
complaint. Although the case management plan set a deadline for motions for leave to amend, Rule 15 did not afford plaintiffs an 
entitlement to file a fourth complaint, let alone one that proposed to more than double the temporal reach of plaintiffs' claims. 
See, e.g., F5 Capital v. Pappas, 856 F.3d 61, 90 (2d Cir. 2017); Lopez v. Ctpartners Exec. Search Inc., 173 F. Supp. 3d 12, 42-
44 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). In any event, the findings here of long delay, undue prejudice, and gamesmanship distinguish Loreley. For 
the same reasons—and also because the amendment here was not based on discovery that yielded new evidence—WPP 
Luxembourg Gamma Three Sarl v. Spot Runner, Inc., 655 F.3d 1039, 1059 (9th Cir. 2011) is of no help to plaintiffs here. Finally, 
the district court decisions on which plaintiffs rely are inapposite. See, e.g., Boiling v. Gold, No. C13-0872JLR, 2015 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 66063, 2015 WL 2406487, at *4-6 (W.D. Wash. May 19, 2015) (addressing only futility of proposed third amended 
complaint, not other considerations); United States v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 66 F.R.D. 223, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 1975) (allowing 
amendment which court found unnecessary given its conclusion that the allegations therein were already embraced by the 
existing complaint); Kissing Camels Surgery Ctr., LLC v. Centura Health Corp., No. 12-CV-3012-WJM-BNB, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 156357, 2014 WL 5599127, at *3 (D. Colo. Nov. 4, 2014) [*96]  (allowing amendment where plaintiffs promptly sought 
leave to amend after dismissal order, amendments were based on information learned in discovery, and no showing of delay, 
undue prejudice, or gamesmanship had been made)."
1704,20," In light of this ruling, there is no factual basis for plaintiffs' proposed restoration of claims against Tradeweb. The Third 
Amended Complaint, as filed, is not to include such claims. "
1711,1," The Reverse Sort Patents involve a sorting process that reverses the order of steps recited in the sorting process described in 
the Freezing Patent. In the Freezing Patent, sperm is first sorted and then frozen, while in the Reverse Sort Patents, the sperm 
is first frozen, then thawed and sorted. "
1712,2," Inguran was previously a party to this suit. After dismissing Trans Ova's antitrust counterclaims, the district court granted 
Inguran's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the remaining claims against Inguran and removed Inguran from the suit. 
See J.A. 55-63. "
1716,3," See generally Trans Ova's Br. in Opp'n to XY's Mot. for Summ. J., XY, LLC v. Trans Ova Genetics, LC, No. 13-CV-876 (D. 
Colo. Aug. 22, 2014), ECF No. 247. Trans Ova's brief alleged only a single injury that resulted from XY's conduct: exclusion from 
the relevant market covered by XY's patents. See id."
1716,4," The district court did not abuse its discretion in disregarding arguments about new and accumulating harm that Trans Ova 
raised for the first time in its motion for reconsideration. See Servants of Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, 1012 (10th Cir. 
2000) (affirming district court's decision to disregard arguments and evidence presented for the first time in a motion for 
reconsideration)."
1716,5," Trans Ova argues that the district court's decision turned on its erroneous interpretation of Trans Ova's expert's testimony. In 
particular, Trans Ova argues that the district court incorrectly read Trans Ova's expert testimony characterizing the antitrust 
damages as overlapping with the contract damages to mean that there was only a single antitrust injury. However, the district 
court expressly stated that it ""did not rely on [Trans Ova's expert's] testimony as evidence that no new injury had been inflicted."" 
J.A. 52. The district court's decision rested on Trans Ova's failure to raise arguments identifying a new and accumulating injury, 
not on any consideration of expert testimony on damages."
1716,6, The parties agree that Colorado contract law applies here. 
1717,7," On remand, the district court should consider the impact, if any, of our affirmance of the Board's decision that held claims 
unpatentable on the damages award and whether a new trial on damages is warranted. "
1718,8," These decisions are non-precedential, but lay out the reasoning for co-pending appellate decisions having a preclusive effect 
on each other. "
1719,9, Trans Ova does not contest that the jury relied on these rates to arrive at its damages award. 
1721,10," To the contrary, the district court stated: ""The evidence at trial showed that the use of sorted semen via XY's technology has 
spread rapidly in recent years, and the success and popularity of XY's methods suggests that a higher rate than that in the 
Agreement may be appropriate."" J.A. 27. "
1723,1," My colleagues rely on this panel's concurrent affirmance of the PTAB's invalidation of the Freezing Patent in a non-mutual 
proceeding, XY, LLC v. ABS Global, Inc., Appeal No. 16-2228. On the standard of ""substantial evidence,"" the PTAB decision is 
supportable. However, on the district court's standard of ""clear and convincing evidence,"" or even applying the standard of 
""preponderant evidence,"" the Freezing Patent retains validity. This discrepancy and the ensuing uncertainty of outcome 
illuminate a major flaw in the America Invents Act. Although it is now confirmed that Congress has authority to authorize the 
PTAB to invalidate issued patents, see Oil States Energy Services, LLC v. Greene's Energy Group, LLC, 138 S. Ct. 1365, 200 L. 
Ed. 2d 671, 2018 WL 1914662 (U.S. 2018), it cannot be inferred that Congress also authorized the PTAB to override the 
judgments of Article III courts."
1723,2," The panel majority proposes that ""[t]here is no indication that either party thought estoppel would not apply."" Maj. Op. at 20. 
However, neither is there any indication that either party thought estoppel would apply—it was never discussed. ""The fallacy of 
the argument consists in assuming the very ground in controversy."" Trs. of Dartmouth Coll. v. Woodward, 17 U.S. 518, 697, 4 L. 
Ed. 629 (1819) (Story, J., concurring). "
