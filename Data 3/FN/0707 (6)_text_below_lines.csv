Separation of Powers Problem, 162 U. Penn. L. Rev. 1373, 1381 (2014). "
24,4," See id. at 1376 (arguing that in the interest of avoiding pressuring defendants to settle before a case or controversy has been 
conclusively established, ""it is critical to resolve disputes over subject matter jurisdiction (both legal and factual) at the very 
outset of litigation."" Waiting to resolve standing until as late as trial is permissible under the Supreme Court's approach to 
standing analyses as set forth in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 
(1992). However, ""[b]y deferring resolution of the standing issue, courts force defendants into a Hobson's choice—either incur 
the expense of litigation or settle the case—without having conclusively established the existence of a valid case or 
controversy."")."
24,5," See Ethypharm S.A. Fr., 707 F.3d at 232 n.17 (quoting Palmyra Park Hosp. Inc. v. Phoebe Putney Mem'l Hosp., 604 F.3d 
1291, 1299 (11th Cir. 2010)) (noting that the Third Circuit is persuaded by the Eleventh Circuit's view that antitrust standing 
requires a plaintiff ""do more than meet the basic 'case or controversy' requirement that would satisfy constitutional standing; "
25,," instead, the party must show that it satisfies a number of prudential considerations aimed at preserving the effective 
enforcement of the antitrust laws.""). "
27,6," See Redish and Joshi, 162 U. Penn. L. Rev. at 1378 (""The Court should instruct lower courts to resolve questions about Article 
III standing as soon as its existence is put into doubt. Specifically, courts should address all factual issues relevant to standing 
by conducting limited discovery and making credibility determinations without inferences in favor of the plaintiff. This proposal 
requires all issues of standing to be raised on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss.""). "
30,1," The Court also concluded that, to the extent Dakota was asserting a claim for money damages against the County, that claim 
was barred by the Local Government Antitrust Act. (Doc. 69 at 3-4.) "
33,2," Specifically, the alleged murky circumstances were that ""early in 1960 the Authority, acting through one of its members, 
contacted [the competitor] and as a result of subsequent meetings the Authority and [the competitor] entered into a conspiracy 
under which the Authority would refuse to allow the plaintiff to remain at Logan . . . and that [the competitor] would then take over 
their operations and become the sole and exclusive fixed base operator at Logan."" Id. at 54-55. "
36,3," Additionally, although the County didn't raise the issue of Parker immunity in its renewed motion for judgment on the pleadings, 
it seems to the Court that the County would have an even stronger claim under Parker than SOCAA. As noted infra, one of 
Plaintiffs' arguments here is that SOCAA doesn't qualify for immunity because it's a non-governmental entity. That argument 
obviously wouldn't apply to the County. "
37,4," The County also seeks judgment on the pleadings because (1) Plaintiffs fail to allege it possessed monopoly power in the 
relevant market, as required for a section 2 claim and (2) Plaintiffs fail to allege a plausible ""antitrust injury,"" as required for both 
a section 1 and section 2 claim. (Doc. 79 at 7-13.) Additionally, the County argues that Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief is 
improper because (1) Plaintiffs have not stated a valid claim under the Sherman Act and (2) the amended complaint doesn't 
identify any ongoing conduct by the County that is causing or threatens to cause future harm. (Id. at 13.) The Court declines to 
reach these arguments because it is ruling in the County's favor on alternative grounds. "

54,1," Nagin was the Mayor of the City of New Orleans from May 2002 to May 2010. In 2013, a federal grand jury returned a 21-count 
indictment against Nagin, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire fraud and bribery; six 
counts of bribery; nine counts of honest-services wire fraud; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering; and four 
counts of filing false tax returns. After trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts of the indictment, except for one count of 
bribery. The district court sentenced Nagin to ten years in prison. See United States v. Nagin, 810 F.3d 348 (5th Cir. 2016)."

63,51," Matsushita built upon Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984) by 
holding that ""antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence."" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 588. 
""The Court's rationale for awarding summary judgment to the defendants in Matsushita, then, turned to a large extent on its 
rejection of a substantive theory of antitrust law—implausible theories of predatory pricing were now disfavored as a matter of 
substantive law."" EDWARD J. BRUNET ET AL., SUMMARY JUDGMENT: FEDERAL LAW AND PRACTICE § 9.5, at p. 423 (2019)."
63,52," The summary judgment standard, as applied in Matsushita, was predicated on substantive antitrust law. As Professor Brunet 
states: Standing on its own, however, apart from the [1986 summary-judgment] trilogy, Matsushita functions best as a model for 
antitrust summary judgment. The Court's discussion on the summary judgment process repeatedly refers to substantive 
antitrust doctrine. For example, the Court's statement that ""antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from 
ambiguous evidence in a § 1 [Sherman Act] case"" was a response to the plaintiffs' contention that all inferences ""must be 
viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the [summary judgment] motion."" Moreover, the Supreme Court 
framed the burden placed on the nonmovant in a specific antitrust factual context. Id. at 425 (citations omitted). Other scholars share a similar characterization of the Matsushita opinion. See, e.g., JAMES WM. MOORE ET AL., 11 Moore's 
Federal Practice § 56.22[2][c] (3d ed. 2018). Specifically, they recognize: The [Supreme] Court found the plaintiff's theory of a long-running predatory pricing scheme implausible because it would 
require defendants to incur substantial losses jointly for years without an intervening opportunity to recoup monopoly profits. The Supreme Court then incorporated the substantive evidentiary standard applicable in [**27]  antitrust cases into its 
analysis, noting that ""antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences from ambiguous evidence in a § 1 [of the 
Sherman Act] case."" Under substantive antitrust law, conduct that is as consistent with permissible competition as with 
illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy. Therefore, to survive a motion for 
summary judgment, the plaintiffs had to present evidence that tended to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators 
acted independently. "
64,," Id. (citations omitted); see Arthur R. Miller, The Pretrial Rush to Judgment: Are the ""Litigation Explosion,"" ""Liability Crisis,"" and 
Efficiency Clichés Eroding Our Day in Court and Jury Trial Commitments?, 78 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 982, 1044-68 (2003) (concluding 
that Matsushita ""seems specific to the antitrust context"")."
64,53," It is telling that River Birch has never thought the instant case has anything to do with Matsushita and that case's point about 
economic rationality. Defendants never raised it. Nagin's and Mouton's history of receiving bribes shows there is nothing 
economically irrational about that conduct."
64,54," The dissent cites a number of cases, see post, at 31 (opinion of OLDHAM, J.), that ""apply Matsushita in non-antitrust cases."" 
That's not surprising, considering that Matsushita is one of the most-cited Supreme Court cases. But in non-antitrust context, 
courts apply Matsushita for its statement of the general Rule 56 standard: ""When the moving party has carried its burden under 
Rule 56(c), its opponent must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts. . . . 
Where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no 'genuine 
issue for trial.'"" Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 586-87 (citations omitted). The cases cited by the dissent show precisely that. The dissent argues that Waste Management, in response to a summary judgment motion, has an affirmative duty to negate 
River Birch's argument that Nagin shuttered the landfill due to political pressure. In taking this position, the dissent refuses to 
accept the reading of Matsushita by courts, scholars and civil procedure treatise authors who recognize that this part of the 
Matsushita holding was governed by substantive antitrust law that required the plaintiff to show a plausible economic motive for 
plaintiff's predatory acts to prevail in that § 1 antitrust case. Application of the dissent's rule, based on an extended reading of 
Matsushita, on RICO and other civil cases would turn summary judgment on its head."

65,59," To the extent the dissent is concerned about chilling First Amendment rights, our decision today does no such thing. We 
recognize that Supreme Court precedent safeguards political speech. See Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 339-40, 130 S. 
Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010). But such protection, afforded by the First Amendment, does not extend to certain illegal 
activities. See, e.g., McCutcheon v. FEC, 572 U.S. 185, 192, 134 S. Ct. 1434, 188 L. Ed. 2d 468 (2014) (noting First Amendment 
does not protect quid pro quo corruption). Under Louisiana law, political donations, like the ones by Defendants, cannot be made 
in disguise and veiled by shell corporations to bypass campaign-contribution limits. The First Amendment is therefore not 
implicated here. Indeed, the dissent's point about the First Amendment is again one River Birch did not think worth making. And 
rightly so. "
68,1," The entirety of defendants' alleged bribes are four publicly reported campaign contributions of $5,000, all made on May 16, 
2006. To put these numbers in perspective, Nagin reported $590,747.00 in contributions for the seven-week period between 
May 1 and June 19, 2006. See Candidate's Report, Report Number 10056, LA. ETHICS ADMIN. PROGRAM, 1-2 (filed June 27, 
2006), http://ethics.la.gov/CampaignFinanceSearch/ShowEForm.aspx?ReportID=10056. The defendants' $20,000 constitutes a 
mere 3% of that seven-week total. And across the 2006 primary and general election, Nagin spent $2,491,147.95. See Brian 
Brox, Elections and Voting in Post-Katrina New Orleans, SOUTHERN STUDIES: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH, 
Fall/Winter 2009, at 8, 15. The defendants' $20,000 is 0.8% of that total. The record does not reveal a reason to think these 
relatively small sums of money loomed larger in Mayor Nagin's calculus than the obvious political implications of reauthorizing 
the landfill. "
69,2," Given that prior-crimes evidence doesn't help with Nagin, it definitely doesn't help with Mouton. Mouton regulated shrimping. 
The only evidence tying him to the landfill is a letter he sent to the EPA regarding a citizen suit. He never met Nagin, never 
worked for him, never talked to him (about the landfill or anything else), and never had any influence over him. Accordingly, 
Waste Management cannot show Mouton was connected in any way to Nagin, much less that he caused Nagin to refuse to 
reauthorize the landfill. Cf. Boyle v. United States, 556 U.S. 938, 947 n.4, 129 S. Ct. 2237, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1265 (2009)

merchant who has been squeezed by the mafiosi in a loan transaction. RICO makes its appearance in everything from divorce 
suits to religious disputes, to suits against one of the national candidates for President, to a major political party, and to just 
about every kind of garden variety of contractual and securities dispute that you could imagine between businessmen, to 
corporate raids, to defenses against corporate raids, to state efforts to collect state sales taxes from local businessmen. If you find it hard to relate that potpourri to organized crime or racketeering, you are not alone. Id. at 371. "

112,196," Sutter cites ProMedica Health System, Inc. v. FTC, 749 F.3d 559 (6th Cir. 2014), to argue that distinguishing between health 
plans versus patients as the relevant consumers is ""an argument about semantics."" Def. MSJ — ECF No. 272 at 16. ProMedica 
does not hold that distinguishing between health plans and patients is ""semantics"" in all contexts. That case involved a merger 
between two of the four hospital systems in Lucas County, Ohio: ProMedica and St. Luke's. Id. at 561. The FTC challenged the 
merger as adversely affecting competition in violation of the Clayton Act. Id. There was no dispute about the relevant geographic 
market. Id. at 565. Instead, the main issue was whether ProMedica had rebutted the presumption that the merger would affect 
competition adversely. Id. at 568 (noting that the merger resulted in a Herfindahl-Hirschman market-concentration index between 
4,391 to 6,854, far above the threshold of 2,500 where a merger is presumed to be anticompetitive), 571-72 (addressing 
ProMedica's arguments that it rebutted the presumption). The Sixth Circuit noted that what was ""more remarkable is what 
ProMedica does not argue. By way of background, the goal of antitrust law is to enhance consumer welfare. . . . But ProMedica 
did not even attempt to argue before the [Federal Trade] Commission, and does not attempt to argue here, that this merger 
would benefit consumers (as opposed to only the merging parties themselves) in any way. To the contrary, St. Luke's CEO 
admitted that a merger with ProMedica might 'harm the community by forcing higher rates on them.'"" Id. at 571 (internal brackets 
omitted). ProMedica argued that the FTC erred in addressing whether the two merging hospitals were substitutes for each other 
from the perspective of patients, rather than health plans. Id. at 572. The Sixth Circuit rejected that argument as ""an argument 
about semantics. [Health plans] assemble networks based primarily upon patients' preferences, not their own; and thus the 
extent to which an MCO regards ProMedica and St. Luke's as close substitutes depends upon the extent to which the [health 
plan]'s members do."" Id. But this statement does not mean that the Sixth Circuit endorsed a view that distinguishing between 
health plans and patients is ""semantics"" in all contexts, such as in the context of a hypothetical-monopolist test (a test the 
ProMedica court never addressed) to define a geographic market for hospitals' selling hospital services to health plans. Even if it 
were, this out-of-circuit pronouncement would not be controlling in light of the Ninth Circuit's more recent, binding opinion in St. 
Luke's on this issue. It may be proper to focus on the response of patients, as opposed to health plans, in other contexts, such as in antitrust cases 
brought by medical providers alleging that they have been shut out of competing for patients. Sutter cites a number of these 
cases. Def. MSJ — ECF No. 272 at 15, 24-25. For example, one of the cases that Sutter cites, Little Rock Cardiology Clinic PA 
v. Baptist Health, 591 F.3d 591 (8th Cir. 2009), involved allegations by cardiologists that a large hospital system and a health 
plan conspired to shut them out from competing to attract patients to their clinic (instead of the hospitals). Id. at 597. In the 
context of the doctors' claims that they were shut out from competing for patients, it made sense to examine from where doctors 
draw their patients. Id. at 599; see Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of R.I., 373 F.3d 57, 67 (1st Cir. 
2004) (""the concern in an ordinary exclusive dealing claim by a shut-out supplier is with the available market for the supplier,"" as 
opposed to the buyer) (emphasis in original). Other cases that Sutter cites are similar. See Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., 423 
F.3d 184, 198 (3d Cir. 2005) (ophthalmologist alleging that hospital attempted to prevent him from competing to obtain or retain 
patients); Surgical Care Ctr. of Hammond, L.C. v. Hosp. Serv. Dist. No. 1, 309 F.3d 836, 838 (5th Cir. 2002) (outpatient surgery 
clinic alleging that large hospital attempted to monopolize the outpatient-surgery market); Minn. Ass'n of Nurse Anesthetists v. 
Unity Hosp., 208 F.3d 655, 658-59 (8th Cir. 2000) (nurse anesthetists alleging that hospitals and doctors conspired to shut them 
out of competing with doctor anesthesiologists); Doctor's Hosp. of Jefferson, Inc. v. Se. Med. All., Inc., 123 F.3d 301, 304 (5th 
Cir. 1997) (hospital alleging that rival hospital and health plan conspired to monopolize the hospital market); Novak v. Somerset 
Hosp., 625 F. App'x 65, 67 (3d Cir. 2015) (surgeon alleging that hospital terminated his privileges to perform surgery on patients 
at the hospital); Brown v. Our Lady of Lourdes Med. Ctr., 767 F. Supp. 618, 620 (D.N.J. 1991) (cardiothoracic surgeon alleging 
that hospital denied him medical-staff privileges). None of those medical-provider shut-out cases addresses the hypothetical-monopolist test. And this is not a medical-provider 
shut-out case. The Ninth Circuit has recognized that competition between medical providers to be included as in-network 
providers in health plans is a separate stage of competition than competition between medical providers to attract patients. St. 
Luke's, 778 F.3d at 784 n.10 (""This 'two-stage model' of health care competition is 'the accepted model.' In the first stage, 
providers compete for inclusion in insurance plans. In the second stage, providers seek to attract patients enrolled in the plans."") 
(citing John J. Miles, 1 Health Care & Antitrust L. § 1:5 (2014); Vistnes, 67 Antitrust L.J. at 674, 681-82); accord Gowrisankaran 
Decl. — ECF No. 272-3 at 14-16 (¶¶ 19-22) (Sutter's expert agreeing these stages of competition are different). With respect to

health plans, as opposed to patients. St. Luke's, 778 F.3d at 784 & n.10; accord Advocate Health, 841 F.3d at 471; Penn State

law is clear that a plaintiff must have expert testimony to support its antitrust markets"")."
114,199," Hr'g Tr. — ECF No. 611 at 137. Sutter points to Hammer v. Clear Channel Communications (In re Live Concert Antitrust 
Litigation), 863 F. Supp. 2d 966 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (cited by Def. MSJ Reply — ECF No. 436 at 17; Hr'g Tr. — ECF No. 611 at 
139), but that case is inapposite. In that case, the plaintiffs relied solely on their expert to provide an evidentiary basis for their 
product (not geographic) market definition. See Live Concert, 863 F. Supp. 2d at 1000 (""Plaintiffs do not argue . . . that there is 
an adequate evidentiary basis in the record, absent [their expert's] testimony, for a jury to find that Plaintiffs have defined an 
economically significant product market.""). The court excluded the plaintiffs' expert, and then granted the defendants partial 
summary judgment because the plaintiffs offered no evidence besides their expert in support of their market definition. Id. But 
that case does not stand for the principle that plaintiffs must always base their market definition on expert testimony if — unlike 
the Live Concert plaintiffs — the plaintiffs also have non-expert evidence that supports their market definition."
114,200," The Ninth Circuit cited expert testimony for the general precept that patients are insensitive to physicians' raising their prices 
because they pay only a small percentage of their physicians' prices out of pocket. St. Luke's, 778 F.3d at 785. In applying the 
hypothetical-monopolist test to determine how health plans would react to a price increase, however, it cited the testimony of 
industry participants, not experts. Id."
114,201," Additionally, even where parties rely on expert opinion to support their market definitions, there is no requirement that the 
expert conduct an econometric analysis, as opposed to basing the expert opinion on other facts. In re Apple iPod iTunes 
Antitrust Litig., No. 05-CV-0037 YGR, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136437, 2014 WL 4809288, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2014) "

employee testimony, and discovery responses, third-party information such as contemporaneous financial analysis and press 
coverage . . ., and his own experience,"" and holding that the defendant's argument that an expert opinion on market definitions 
must be based on an econometric analysis ""lacks legal support"")."
115,202," The court does not suggest that non-expert declarations are sufficient in all instances to raise a genuine dispute of material 
fact regarding geographic market-definitions on a summary-judgment motion. Cf. Morgan, Strand, Wheeler & Biggs, 924 F.2d at 
1490 (defining geographic markets can be a ""highly technical economic question""). But it also is not the case that non-expert 
evidence is per se insufficient to raise a genuine dispute of material fact."

115,204," Hr'g Tr. - ECF No. 622 at 7-8; see Advocate Health, 841 F.3d at 473 (""[T]he hypothetical monopolist test is an iterative 
analysis. The analyst proposes a candidate market, simulates a monopolization of that market, then adjusts the candidate 
market and reruns the simulation as necessary."")."

115,208," Sutter argues that the plaintiffs are starting with initial candidate markets ""that we've now pretty much all agreed were not 
created with antitrust geographic markets in mind[.]"" Id. at 8; see also Def. MSJ - ECF No. 272 at 7-8 (""HSAs were not 
constructed for antitrust purposes or with hospital competition in mind.""). But Sutter has not identified any proposed initial 
candidate markets that were constructed with antitrust geographic markets in mind. Other courts have defined geographic 
markets in terms of cities, counties, etc., which were no more created with antitrust geographic markets in mind than were HSAs. "
116,209," It is worth noting that Sutter is not complaining that that the plaintiffs' Candidate Markets are too broad. An initial candidate 
market might pass the hypothetical-monopolist test despite being too broad. (For example, an initial candidate market of the 
entire United States would pass the hypothetical-monopolist test because if a hypothetical monopolist controlled every hospital 
in the United States and imposed a SSNIP, health plans would respond by paying it instead of buying hospital services only from 
hospitals outside the market (i.e., hospitals in other countries). But this would not exclude the possibility that that candidate 
market is too broad to be a properly defined relevant geographic market.) Instead, Sutter is complaining that the plaintiffs' initial 
candidate markets are too narrow. See Def. MSJ - ECF No. 272 at 22-23 (arguing that geographic markets should be larger than 
HSAs), 26 (""the proffered HSAs are too narrow to constitute relevant geographic markets""). The hypothetical-monopolist test 
accounts for the scenario where initial candidate markets are too narrow: if the candidate market is too narrow and buyers thus 
would turn to alternate sellers outside of the candidate market, broaden the candidate market to include those alternate sellers 
and rerun the test. Advocate Health, 841 F.3d at 468; accord St. Luke's, 778 F.3d at 784. If buyers would not turn to alternate 
sellers outside of the candidate market, that does not mean that the initial candidate market was too narrow. Indeed, it may 
mean the opposite. Sutter cites Little Rock Cardiology, 591 F.3d 591, in which the Eighth Circuit cautioned against plaintiffs delineating arbitrarily 
narrow geographic markets. Def. MSJ Reply - ECF No. 436 at 10-11. As discussed above, Little Rock Cardiology was a 
medical-provider shut-out case, which does not present its issues in the same context as this case. See supra note 196. The 
Little Rock Cardiology court looked to the response of patients (not health plans) and did not address the hypothetical-
monopolist test (which accounts for the scenario where initial candidate markets are too narrow). Sutter also claims that the asserted geographic markets in the Third Circuit's Penn State Hershey case and the Seventh Circuit's 
Advocate Health case spanned eleven and nine HSAs, respectively, to suggest that HSA-based markets are too narrow to be 
relevant geographic markets for antitrust purposes. Def. MSJ - ECF No. 272 at 22. Sutter conspicuously does not address the 
Ninth Circuit's St. Luke's case and does not say whether the geographic market there — the city of Nampa, Idaho — supports its 
theory that geographic markets should be broader than a single HSA. See id."
116,210," As discussed above, the parties agree to exclude Kaiser hospitals for the purposes of this summary-judgment motion. See 
supra note 50. In any event, it is not clear that including Kaiser hospitals would substantially change the outcome. The 
hypothetical-monopolist test requires one to assume that a single firm becomes the only seller in the candidate market and 
imposed a SSNIP, so if the Kaiser hospital were included, the hypothetical-monopolist test would require one to assume that the 
SSNIPimposing hypothetical monopolist controlled the Kaiser hospital, in addition to the Sutter hospital. "
117,211," Because this non-expert evidence raises disputes of material fact with respect to the Candidate Tying Markets, the court does 
not address whether Dr. Chipty's report also raises disputes of material fact. The court denies as moot Sutter's motion to exclude 
Dr. Chipty's opinions regarding the Candidate Tying Markets."

121,235," In his deposition testimony, Dr. Gowrisankaran raised the prospect of whether, in the context of a product market of hospitals 
selling inpatient hospital services to health plans, geographic markets can be defined as a set of sellers in a geographic region 
— i.e., that the market can be defined by listing what hospitals are part of the market and what hospitals are outside of it — 
rather than by trying to draw precise ""metes and bounds"" on a map. Dr. Gowrisankaran testified that the courts in Advocate 
Health defined their geographic market solely by specifying which hospitals were inside the market and which hospitals were 
outside and did not define the precise boundaries of the market. Gowrisankaran Dep. - ECF No. 311-4 at 34-35 (pp. 237-38) 
(under seal) (""[W]hat the courts accepted in this case was not the geographic markets that I've outlined there in the shape files. . 
. . Rather what they accepted is that, or what they stipulated was that the following hospitals are in the geographic market. . . . 
There w[ere] no precise geographic boundaries for which — which residents lived inside the market. There were precise 
boundaries for — there are precise definitions of which hospitals were inside the market.""). As Dr. Gowrisankaran explained, 
""what really needs to happen in an antitrust setting is — is understanding what are the sets of potential competitors and the likely 
set of potential competitors and using that as the basis for a market analysis. A market analysis does not always yield only one 
market definition that is accurate. It might yield a couple of different market definitions that could each be plausible. And what 
these — what these sentences [that relevant markets need not have precise metes and bounds] are pointing out is that what's 
important here is not saying well, we want to have an airtight definition of a market, but rather that it's the process of market 
analysis that identifies likely potential competitors to any firm[.]"" Id. at 14 (p. 110). Taking into account the ""the commercial 
realities of the industry,"" Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 336-37 (internal quotation marks omitted) — including the fact that in a market 
between hospitals and health plans, both the seller and the buyer are stationary and cannot move — Dr. Gowrisankaran's 
testimony raises the question of whether it is sufficient to define the market by listing which sellers are in the market and which 
sellers are out, as opposed to trying to engage in ""metes and bounds"" line-drawing on a map in the spaces between hospitals. 
Cf. St. Luke's, 778 F.3d at 784 (markets, ultimately, are just ""groups of sellers""); Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 530a (""To define a 
market is to identify those producers providing customers of a defendant firm (or firms) with alternative sources for the 
defendant's product or service.""). Under that framework, a geographic market of the Crescent City HSA and Sutter's hypothetical 
two-block radius around the Sutter Coast hospital would be functionally equivalent: each would clearly and concretely define 
which sellers are in the market (Sutter Coast) and which sellers are not (hospitals other than Sutter Coast). The court expresses 
no opinion here on this approach, other than to say that these questions further demonstrate why, at this juncture, Sutter has not 
established that there are no disputes of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. "

127,1," Wi-LAN notes that this allegation is contradicted elsewhere in LG's monopolization counterclaim when LG's alleges that the 
patents-in-suit are not infringed by products having components designed based upon the IEEE 802.16 standard or the 3GPP 
LTE standard. (Doc. No. 56-1 at 4-5 (citing Doc. No. 17, Counterclaims ¶ 285).) But this inconsistent allegation is of no 
consequence because Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 allows parties to plead inconsistent factual allegations in the 
alternative. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2) (""A party may set out 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or 
hypothetically, either in a single count or defense or in separate ones. If a party makes alternative statements, the pleading is

129,2," Wi-LAN also argues that LG has failed to properly plead sham litigation as part of its antitrust conduct allegations in support of 
its monopolization counterclaim. (Doc. No. 56-1 at 6-10.) Because LG's allegations of deceptive conduct before the SSOs are 
sufficient to allege antitrust conduct in support of its monopolization counterclaim, the Court declines to address these additional 
allegations at this time. "
133,3," In addition, the Court notes that it may also consider the '435 patent's prosecution history in ruling on LG's Rule 12(c) motion 
under the ""incorporation by reference doctrine"" because LG's counterclaim allegations extensively reference and rely on the 
prosecution history as the basis for LG's unenforceability counterclaim. See Coto Settlement, 593 F.3d at 1038 (""We have 
extended the doctrine of incorporation by reference to consider documents in situations where the complaint necessarily relies 
upon a document or the contents of the document are alleged in a complaint, the document's authenticity is not in question and 
there are no disputed issues as to the document's relevance.""); United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003)

160,6," Although defendants contend ""the end user pet owner[] is the appropriate customer"" (see Mot. to Dism. at 11:1), the Court, for

161,7," The Court finds it unnecessary to address herein defendants' contention that, contrary to plaintiffs' allegations, ""measured"" and 
""unmeasured"" are not used in connection with ""products,"" but, rather, with ""accounts"" (see Mot. to Dism. at 12-13), i.e., retailers,

prescription"" products) is not consistent with their contention that Frontline Plus, an OTC product, ""contributes significantly to

170,1," ECB and Voss Enterprises assigned portions of their equity in SFI to AV, then owned by ECB and VEI in the same proportions 
as their prior direct ownership of SFI. D.E. 1 at 19 n.1; see D.E.1 at 125. "
172,2," Plaintiffs also rely on Newco's narrow interpretation of forum selection clauses to briefly argue that the forum selection clause is 
merely permissive. D.E. 15 at 4. This is important because the Eleventh Circuit ""enforce[es] only those clauses that 
unambiguously designate the forum in which the parties must enforce their rights under the contract."" Florida Polk County v. 
Prison Health Servs., Inc., 170 F.3d 1081, 1084 n. 8 (11th Cir.1999). ""A mandatory clause designates a specific forum as the 
exclusive forum in which to litigate the dispute. A permissive clause merely consents . . . to jurisdiction in the designated forum 
and does not foreclose litigation in an alternative forum. Cardoso v. Coelho, 596 F. App'x 884, 885-86 (11th Cir. 2015). ""An 
action is only subject to dismissal based on a forum selection clause if the import of the language of the clause as a whole is to 
provide a particular court or courts with ""exclusive jurisdiction,"" although the clause need not include the word ""exclusive."" Wai v. 
Rainbow Holdings, 315 F. Supp. 2d 1261, 1270 (S.D. Fla. 2004). Here, the Court agrees with Defendants that the forum 
selection clause is plainly mandatory because it provides for exclusive jurisdiction in Delaware or Wilmington and provides no 
alternative forum for suit. See D.E. 1 at 102 (Section XIII.5 ""Applicable Law and Attorneys' Fees"") (any action ""shall be brought 
in a court of record of the State of Delaware in and the City of Wilmington or in the United States District Court in such county, 
the Buyer and the Seller consenting to the exclusive jurisdiction thereof."") (emphasis added). In addition, the forum selection 
clauses uses the word ""shall,"" which the Eleventh Circuit has held is an indicator that the clause is mandatory. See Slater v. 
Energy Servs. Grp. Int'l, Inc., 634 F.3d 1326, 1330-31 (11th Cir. 2011) (holding ""that the forum designation in the clause is not 
permissive, but mandatory,"" because the clause stated ""all claims or causes of action relating to or arising from this Agreement 
shall be brought in a court in the City of Richmond, Virginia,"" and ""the use of the term 'shall' is one of requirement."") (emphasis 
added); Walker v. Hallmark Bank & Tr., Ltd., 707 F. Supp. 2d 1322, 1325 n.1 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (concluding forum selection clause 
was mandatory ""based on the use of the terms 'shall' and 'exclusive.'"") (emphasis added); see also Snapper, Inc. v. Redan, 171 
F.3d 1249, 1260-1262 n. 24 (11th Cir.1999) (stating that a selection clause is mandatory when ""it dictates an exclusive forum for 
litigation under the contract"" and finding forum selection clause stating that an action ""may be brought in the courts of the State 
of Georgia or the United States District Court, Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, all as Creditor may elect"" to be 
permissive) (emphasis added). "
173,3," Plaintiffs do not dispute that these claims are subject to the forum selection clause, but argue that these two claims should not 
be transferred to Delaware because ""public interest factors"" justify maintaining this action in this Court. As discussed in more 
detail infra, the public interest factors do not justify maintaining suit in this Court. See infra pp. 11-12. "
193,1," The other approach to determining whether a restraint of trade is ""unreasonable"" is the ""rule of reason."" In re Southeastern Milk 
Antitrust Litigation, 739 F.3d 262, 270 (6th Cir. 2014). ""If the rule of reason is used, plaintiffs must additionally show that the 
restraint produced anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets, while the per se rule is reserved 
for restraints that are so clearly unreasonable that their anticompetitive effects within geographic and product markets are 
inferred."" Id."
193,2," In this opinion, we refer to the four hospitals and the joint operating company collectively as ""Hospital Defendants"" except 
where otherwise noted.  [***4]  comprise a dominant healthcare network in the Dayton area, with more than a 55% share of 
Dayton's inpatient surgical services. "
194,3," While there is some dispute about exactly when these claims were first brought to Hospital Defendants' attention, there does 
not appear to be any dispute that the claims were raised (though the Complaint was not amended to reflect the new claims) in 
MCEP's opposition to Hospital Defendants' initial motion for summary judgment before Judge Black. "
195,4," Judge Black explained that, as a ""Cincinnati duty-stationed Judge,"" he could not preside over a trial in Dayton. "
196,5," If a presumption against summary judgment in antitrust cases is ever appropriate, it is not here. This circuit has applied a 
presumption against summary judgment in antitrust actions only when the case demanded a fact-intensive inquiry under the rule 
of reason into issues of intent and motive. In re Southeastern Milk Antitrust Litig., 739 F.3d 262, 270 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting 
Expert Masonry, Inc. v. Boone Cty., 440 F.3d 336, 341 (6th Cir. 2006)); but see In re ATM Antitrust Litigation, 554 F. Supp. 2d 
1003, 1010 (N. D. Cal. 2008) (opining that ""any presumption against the granting of summary judgment in complex antitrust 
cases has now disappeared"") (citation omitted). Unlike in a rule of reason claim, in a per se claim intent and motive are not 
critical determinations. See Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 1910a (3rd ed. 2011)."
196,6," MCEP cites Jimkoski v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 247 F. App'x 654 (6th Cir. 2007), for the proposition that Judge Rice's 
""law of the case"" decision—specifically his finding that Judge Black committed clear error—should be reviewed de novo. This 
misapplies Jimkoski. Read in context, Jimkoski simply acknowledged that where a motion for reconsideration concerns summary 
judgment, we do not review the district court's decision to grant summary judgment for abuse of discretion. Id. at 659. To do so 
would insulate the district court's merits decision from the proper standard of review—de novo—simply because the motion that 
the district court ruled on was a motion for reconsideration. That concern is not present in this case because we review for abuse 
of discretion the decision to grant a motion for reconsideration (here that means we review the ""law of the case"" decision for 
abuse of discretion). But we still review de novo the merits of the district court's grant of summary judgment. "
199,7," Hospital Defendants, at one point, argue that the correct legal standard for determining whether a restraint is ancillary or naked 
is whether the challenged restraint is ""completely unrelated to the purpose of a lawful joint venture."" But this mischaracterizes 
the ancillary-restraints doctrine. ""The per se rule would collapse if every claim of economies from restricting competition, 
however implausible, could be used to move a horizontal agreement not to compete from the per se rule to the Rule of Reason 
category."" Gen. Leaseways, Inc. v. Nat'l Truck Leasing Ass'n, 744 F.2d 588, 595 (7th Cir. 1984)."
199,8," See MLB Properties, 542 F.3d at 338-39 (Sotomayor, J., concurring); Craftsmen Limo,, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 363 F.3d 761, 
776 (8th Cir. 2004) (""When determining whether to apply the rule of reason analysis to non-price advertising restrictions related 
to product safety, the issue is not whether the restrictions were procompetitive, but whether they could be.""); Paladin Assocs. v. 
Mont. Power Co., 328 F.3d 1145, 1154-55 (9th Cir. 2003) (""When a defendant advances plausible arguments that a practice 
enhances overall efficiency and makes markets more competitive, per se treatment is inappropriate, and the rule of reason 
applies.""); Polk Bros., 776 F.2d at 189. "
200,9," The challenged conduct evaluated in this section is limited to MCEP's claim of illegal concerted action among the Hospital 
Defendants, not the additional ""rim conspiracy"" claims. The reason for this is that we conclude in the next section that Judge 
Rice did not abuse his discretion by ruling that MCEP's effort to plead those claims was untimely. "
201,10," MCEP also argues that Hospital Defendants waived the right to move for summary judgment on this theory of liability because 
they failed to argue before Judge Black that their direct concerted action should be viewed under the rule of reason. Likely, 
MCEP intends to say that Hospital Defendants' forfeited the argument.HN15[
]  ""Whereas forfeiture is the failure to make the 
timely assertion of a right, waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right."" United States v. Olano, 507 
U.S. 725, 733, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993). Under forfeiture doctrine, ""parties are not limited to the precise 
arguments they made below."" Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 534, 112 S. Ct. 1522, 118 L. Ed. 2d 153 (1992). At worst, MCEP 
is claiming that Hospital Defendants are making a ""new argument to support what has been [their] consistent claim."" Lebron v. 
Natl'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 379, 115 S. Ct. 961, 130 L. Ed. 2d 902 (1995). Hospital Defendants did not forfeit the 
right to move for summary judgment on MCEP's claim that Hospital Defendants' direct concerted action is per se illegal because 
Hospital Defendants have consistently argued that MCEP's per se claim does not apply to the challenged conduct. "
202,11," Instead MCEP cites to E. States Retail Lumber Dealers' Assoc. v. United States, 234 U.S. 600, 34 S. Ct. 951, 58 L. Ed. 1490 
(1914), and United States v. Coop. Theatres of Ohio, Inc., 845 F.2d 1367, 1373 (6th Cir. 1988) (per curiam). Neither case 
concerns joint ventures or the ancillary-restraints doctrine. Coop. Theatres of Ohio is inapposite, as it concerns market allocation 
rather than a group boycott. 845 F.2d at 1368."
202,12," ""It must have been obvious from the beginning that the flat ban against such restraints of trade covered more than the 
rationale of the rule required. The rule might prevent desirable transfers of property. The most valuable asset of a business 
might be the good will of the public toward its owner. Should he wish to sell the business the owner could not get a price 
reflecting the asset of good will or the true going concern value of his business unless he could promise the purchaser not to 
return to compete with the business sold."" Robert Bork, Ancillary Restraints & the Sherman Act, 15 ABA Section of Antitrust 
Law Proceedings 211, 213 (1959) (footnote omitted). "
203,13," MCEP's counsel acknowledged this fact in the course of a deposition, asserting: ""I'll represent to you [to the deponent] that 
there was not an allegation of an outer rim in the complaint, but that MCEP contends that the evidence developed through 
discovery establishes the existence of an outer rim, meaning an understanding among two or more payers that each had agreed 
with the defendants not to expand their hospital panel."" "
204,14," MCEP raised two additional claims on appeal—that the district court erred in dismissing Catholic Heath Initiatives and that the 
case should be remanded to Judge Black rather than Judge Rice. Both arguments are mooted because we affirm the district 
court's summary judgment in favor of Hospital Defendants. "
207,1," Because Judge Black construed MCEP's claim as encompassing the rim conspiracy, his conclusion that the per se rule applied 
to MCEP's claim is reasonable. Further, despite the majority's conclusion ""that then-Judge Sotomayor's concurrence in MLB 
Properties"" is ""[p]erhaps most destructive to"" Judge Black's framing of the ancillary-restraints doctrine (Maj. Op. at 13), then-
Judge Sotomayor's concurrence in MLB Properties stated at several points that the restraint must be ""reasonably necessary"" to 
the efficiency-enhancing benefits of the joint venture. See, e.g., 542 F.3d at 338 (explaining that a per se approach may apply to 
joint ventures where ""a particular challenged restraint is not reasonably necessary to achieve any of the efficiency-enhancing 
benefits of a joint venture and serves only as naked restraint against competition""). Thus, the majority's critique of Judge Black's 
formulation of the ancillary-restraints doctrine—requiring the restraint to be necessary to an efficiency-enhancing purpose of the 
joint venture—is not entirely fair given the broader context of his ruling. "
217,1," The Court acknowledges that Inland Service and Inland Florida are intervenors. Given the relationship among each of the 
Inland-affiliated parties, particularly their direct or indirect control by Begley, Davison, and Smith, the Court uses ""Inland"" to 
reference all the relevant Inland-related parties, and identifies the specific party where necessary."
217,2," After Bobcat filed its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in October 2018, it sought and obtained the Court's approval for 
leave to amend its complaint. Bobcat's leave to amend was unopposed by Inland. Bobcat filed its amended complaint (its 
second) in November 2018 [cited hereinafter as ""Second Am. Compl.""]. Bobcat's amended complaint asserts additional facts in 
connection with Inland's alleged breach of contract and misrepresentation. But those additional factual allegations do not affect 
Bobcat's current motion or Inland's opposition thereto. So the Court finds it unnecessary for the parties to further amend their 
respective motion papers. Instead, the Court considers the amended complaint's additional factual allegations and those from 
Inland's amended answer when deciding this motion for partial summary judgment. "

not covered by contract shall be paid by the several public corporations assessed for the cost of the drain."""
274,3," Defendant also argues that, because plaintiff's claims were premised on the resolution and Final Order of Apportionment, the 
claims challenged the propriety of the Final Order of Apportionment and the legality of apportioning the costs to Royal Oak. 
Defendant contends that plaintiff's claims were barred by the limitations period prescribed under MCL 280.483 which governs 
challenges to orders of apportionment. We find no merit to defendant's argument because plaintiff's complaint plainly did not 
challenge the apportionment decision. Further, we decline to review this issue because it is not necessary for the disposition of 
this case. See Fast Air, Inc v Knight, 235 Mich App 541, 549-550; 599 NW2d 489 (1999). "
276,4," See Bond v Public Schools of Ann Arbor, 383 Mich 693; 178 NW2d 484 (1970)."
276,5," Defendant also argues that this action improperly imposed against it a certified class from the earlier settled action despite the 
fact that defendant was not a party to that action. Although defendant raised this issue before the trial court, the trial court did not 
decide the issue. Therefore, the issue was not preserved for review by this Court and we decline to review it. Further, the issue 
is not necessary for the disposition of this case. Fast Air, Inc, 235 Mich App at 549-550. "
280,1," SC Innovations is the assignee of all causes of action of Sidecar Technologies, Inc., a defunct former competitor of Uber. This 
order, like Sidecar's complaint, uses the term ""Sidecar"" to refer to both SC Innovations and Sidecar Technologies."
280,2," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c). "
281,3," Swedlow was ""the primary Quinn Emanuel partner who managed [the] firm's work for Uber."" Swedlow Decl. (dkt. 32-2) ¶ 4; see 
also Quinn Decl. (dkt. 32-1) ¶ 5. According to Uber's in-house attorneys, Swedlow and Quinn Emanuel touted their familiarity 
with ""every nuance of Uber's business."" Ghaussy Decl. (dkt. 30-3) ¶ 19; Allen Reply Decl. (dkt. 33-1) ¶ 7."
281,4," This case was assigned case number 24C14004064 in Maryland Circuit Court for Baltimore City where it was initially filed, and 
case number 1:14-cv-02764-RDB upon removal to the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. "
284,5," Even if California law permitted the use of ethical walls to limit conflicts from being imputed to lawyers working at the same firm 
throughout both representations, which it does not appear to, Quinn Emanuel's establishment of such a wall at the recent outset 
of its representation of Sidecar would not be effective, because no such wall was in place over the years in which it represented 
Uber, and there is no reason to believe that the attorneys who worked on those matters would have had any reason at that time 
to hesitate before sharing information with their colleagues. The scope of Quinn Emanuel's ethical wall is also unclear, with no 
information in the record addressing, for example, any measures put in place to prevent access to documents or efforts to 
determine whether attorneys other than those who ""performed work for Uber"" obtained information before the wall was imposed. 
See, e.g., Glass Decl. ¶ 27 (""The wall has prevented me from having any substantive communication regarding this case or 
Quinn Emanuel's prior work for Uber with anyone at Quinn Emanuel who performed work for Uber.""); cf. Kirk, 183 Cal. App. 4th 
at 810-11 (""The typical elements of an ethical wall are: [1] physical, geographic, and departmental separation of attorneys; [2] 
prohibitions against and sanctions for discussing confidential matters; [3] established rules and procedures preventing access to 
confidential information and files; [4] procedures preventing a disqualified attorney from sharing in the profits from the 
representation; and [5] continuing education in professional responsibility."" (citation omitted)). "
285,6," The nature of such companies' business has been and continues to be widely litigated in, for example, disputes regarding 
drivers' status as employees or independent contractors. The Court need not and does not reach such questions on the present 
motion."
285,7," Conversely, the circumstances of this case might be analogous to a counterfactual version of Foster Poultry where the 
company only sold turkey but had been sued previously by a chicken seller who argued that the two products were part of the 
same market. If that had been the case, the Eastern District likely would have found the first lawsuit, concerning both chicken 
and turkey, to be substantially related to a subsequent lawsuit concerning only turkey. "
286,8," As noted above, Quinn Emanuel presented this argument in an unsuccessful effort to establish diversity jurisdiction by showing 
that certain individual driver defendants were fraudulently joined. The District of Maryland held that Uber had not established 
fraudulent joinder because the plaintiffs had met their very low burden to show ""a 'glimmer of hope' that their price-fixing claim 
[would] succeed."" The Yellow Cab Co. v. Uber Techs., Inc., No. RDB-14-2764, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109417, 2015 WL 
4987653, at *5 (D. Md. Aug. 19, 2015). The court did not contradict Quinn Emanuel's position that the plaintiffs' claims required 
antitrust injury, market power, and a danger of recouping losses through later price increases. See id. "
287,9," Other aspects of Quinn Emanuel's past representations of Uber also raise concern. As one example, it seems likely that the 
revenue information disclosed to Quinn Emanuel in the Boston Cab and Greater Houston cases would be material to the present 
antitrust claims concerning the same geographic markets, and Quinn Emanuel cites no authority adopting its ""conduit"" theory of 
excusing confidential information actually disclosed to counsel so long as the attorneys who received it state that they did not 
""analyze"" such information or provide advice. See Swedlow Decl. ¶¶ 14-15; Ghaussy Decl. ¶ 16. The Court also hesitates to 
allow attorney declarations attesting to only a limited exchange of information ""[t]o the best of [the attorney's] recollection"" to 
trump a former client's declaration that the attorney had access to more extensive information. See Swedlow Decl. ¶¶ 7-13, 15-
17; Ghaussy Decl. ¶¶ 7, 24. Because the Yellow Cab representation satisfies the ""substantial relationship"" test for 
disqualification, however, the Court does not reach these other issues. "
288,10," The various plaintiffs in Yellow Cab are described as providing taxi services ""in the State of Maryland,"" ""in the City [of 
Baltimore],"" and ""in Montgomery County, Maryland."" See Glass Decl. Ex. T ¶¶ 9-40. Portions of Maryland, including Montgomery 
County, are suburbs of Washington, DC, which is one of the geographic markets asserted in Sidecar's present complaint. See 
Compl. ¶ 61. Although, as discussed above, Sidecar disputes other aspects of the relationship between this case and Yellow 
Cab, it does not argue that the geographic markets of the two cases are a relevant difference between them. See Opp'n at 16-

291,1," Jet Edge sued Schembari in the related action Western Air Charter, Inc., v. Schembari, No. 2:17-cv-00420JGB(KSx) (C.D. Cal

Schembari, No. 2:17-cv-00420JGB(KSx) (C.D. Cal 2017) have prepared the Application and relevant declarations pursuant to 
Local Rule 79-5.2.2(b). The Court will analyze the Application under section b of the L.R. 79-5.2.2 but advises the parties to 
either seek a Protective Order in this matter prior to filing a similar application in the future or to apply pursuant to L.R. 79-
5.2.2(a), for Documents Not Designated as Confidential Pursuant to a Protective Order in future cases. "
299,3, The Court also declines Plaintiff's request for jurisdictional discovery as it would be fruitless.
299,4," Defendant Sojitz Jet filed a separate Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim (Dkt. No. 33) that echoes the arguments in

302,7," Although Plaintiff's briefing mentioned a potential action under the UCL's unlawful prong, such an action was absent from the 
FAC. (Opp. at 24.) "
304,8," This inference is particularly reasonable given the events in Schembari, where a jury found Schembari tortiously interfered with 
Jet Edge's contracts based partially on evidence regarding disparaging comments he made to Jet Edge customers. (Schembari 
Dkt. No. 144 at 12.) The Court takes judicial notice of these proceedings. "
309,1," The court refers to both Mallinckrodt plaintiffs, Mallinckrodt plc and Mallinckrodt ARD, Inc. (including its acquisition of Questcor 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), as ""Mallinckrodt"" for purposes of this opinion."
309,2," Since the MTD Order was issued, Acument has voluntarily withdrawn from the case. Therefore, the claims referred to in this 
opinion refer to Rockford's claims only."
309,3," Express Scripts also requests oral argument. The court has determined that it can resolve the disputed issues on the briefs and 
therefore denies that request. See L.R. 78.3 (""Oral argument may be allowed in the court's discretion."")."
309,4," Express Scripts does not specify what Federal Rule of Civil Procedure they move under. However, the court has inherent 
authority to reconsider its own orders entered prior to final judgment. VBR Tours, LLC v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., No. 14-CV-

311,5," While the court found that Express Scripts conspired with Mallinckrodt to ""restrict"" the output of Acthar, the court used the term

322,1," Pursuant to the Joint Status Report Regarding Porky Products, Inc.'s Amended Motion to Quash Subpoenas [ECF No. 1940], 
Porky Products and Koch Defendants have reached a compromise, and the Amended Motion to Quash is withdrawn as to the 
Koch Defendants. "

3d 631 (S.D.N.Y. 2016). "
332,2," The Court expresses its appreciation to the attorneys for all parties who have worked together cooperatively and collegially to 
resolve among themselves the logistics of the discovery in this case. The Court trusts that their successful collaboration will 
continue throughout the discovery in this matter."
332,3," At the Court's direction, the parties have explored ways of generating consistent pseudonyms, which would enable Plaintiffs to 
track customer activity across datasets. Dkts. 390, 391. The available means of doing so appear to be prohibitive in terms of 
time and cost and would not enable Plaintiffs to cross-reference data provided by the Fixing Banks with documents obtained 
from third parties. See Tr. (Apr. 25, 2019 Hearing) at 6-10. "
333,4," Plaintiffs mischaracterize a case in which, purportedly, a court in the Second Circuit ""[found] no conflict with the French Bank 
Secrecy Statute."" See Pl. Opp. at 5. In Strauss v. Credit Lyonnais, S.A., 242 F.R.D. 199 (E.D.N.Y 2007), the district court ruled 
in favor of disclosure but only after concluding that the French bank had ""adequately supported its position that the discovery 
sought is indeed prohibited by foreign law."" 242 F.R.D. at 207 (internal quotations and citation omitted). "
334,," Plaintiffs also cite a line of cases holding that the French duty of secrecy does not apply to cases in which the bank is a party. 
See Alfadda v. Fenn, No. 89-CV-6217, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1092, 1993 WL 33445, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 1993); see also 
Bodner v. Paribas 202 F.R.D. 370, 376 n.6 (E.D.N.Y. 2000). In this Court's view, SG has sufficiently demonstrated that this 
carveout applies only if the customer whose information is at issue is the bank's adversary in the relevant litigation. Parleani 
Decl. ¶ 28. Such a distinction makes imminent sense: a bank customer, to whom the bank owes a duty of confidence, could 
waive that duty in order to litigate a claim against the bank. See Bodner, 202 F.R.D. at 376 n.6 (noting that French bank secrecy 
law does not apply when bank is ""party to the action brought against it by the beneficiaries of the principle of banking secrecy 
rule"" (quoting expert declaration) (emphasis added)). Additionally, a bank, to defend itself against an adversarial customer, could 
in fairness rely on information concerning subject matter that the client has placed at issue, in the same way that an attorney 
may use privileged communications to defend against a malpractice action. In contrast, there is no apparent rationale for a 
broader carveout that would apply to every case in which a bank is a party to litigation, whether as a plaintiff or as a defendant."
334,5," The Singaporean production will likely consist of documents from one Barclays custodian for a period of one year, a slice of 
transaction data for orders placed in Singapore, and incidental communications related thereto. See Dkt. 382 at 1-4. As 
Defendant Barclays has noted, most of its custodians are not based in Asia. Dkt. 382 at 2. Defendant Bank of Nova Scotia 
(BNS) further indicated that its branch in Singapore does not execute trades of precious metals and instead channels precious 
metals orders to its Hong Kong office, which suggests that a relatively small share of its gold-related activity actually originates in 
Singapore. Id. at 2. Additionally, Defendants BNS, SG, and HSBC do not anticipate any document collection efforts in 
Singapore, and SG and HSBC are not able to speak with specificity and certainty as to their Singaporean customers and their 
processes for executing their gold orders. Id. Consequently, the share of documents likely to be impacted by Singaporean law is 
minimal. "
336,6," Plaintiffs argue that the Court should discount French and Singaporean interests because they have not raised an objection to 
production in this case. While it is true that courts do often consider foreign governments' opposition or acquiescence to 
disclosure in particular cases, the lack of an apparent objection from France or Singapore is not especially probative here, 
because nothing in the record indicates that the governments were informed of this litigation (by either party) or otherwise had 
an opportunity to weigh in. See Alfadda, 149 F.R.D. at 34-35 (noting that defendants gave Swiss government opportunity to 
express view on disclosure and that Swiss government declined to take position). "
337,7," Plaintiffs also claim that CII is necessary for purposes of providing class notices under Federal Rule 23(c)(2)(B) of Civil 
Procedure. The Court finds any dispute over notice to be premature. If a class is certified in this case, the parties can work 
together on devising a method to provide notice to potential class members. Similarly, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants may have an unfair advantage in this litigation if Defendants oppose class certification 
on the basis that Plaintiffs cannot show that class members suffered a net loss as a result of Defendants' manipulation of gold 
prices. See Pl. Opp. at 2 n.2. As the parties have described it, this netting issue could arise if a potential class member has 
multiple accounts across different banks, generating gains and losses that may need to be offset to determine the class 
member's actual injury. If and when Defendants make such an argument, the comity analysis would of course change, as 
Plaintiffs' need for non-anonymized transaction data would increase. The Court, however, finds no need to require, at this time, 
disclosure on the basis of a hypothetical response to a potential argument that Defendants have not yet tried to make. "
338,8," As to these targeted requests, the balancing of the comity factors may weigh in Plaintiffs' favor. First, when making such 
requests, Plaintiffs will presumably be able point to specific documents and concrete circumstances that make clear the 
relevance of the particular customer's identity to the case. Additionally, a bank's limited disclosure of information for selected 
accounts is far less likely to result in prosecution or liability than wholesale disclosure of CII. "
351,1," Nearly all of the moving Defendants are teachers' unions. After identifying the specific unions in each case, the Court will 
thereafter collectively refer to the teachers' unions as ""the Union Defendants."""
351,2," Plaintiffs Georgia Babb, John J. Frangiamore Jr., William Happ, Aaron Holbrook, Michelle Pecanic-Lee, David Schmus, and 
Abram van der Fluit opposed (Babb Opp., Doc. 77) and the Union Defendants replied (Babb Reply, Doc. 78)."
351,3," Plaintiffs Scott Wilford, Bonnie Hayhurst, Rebecca Friedrichs, Michael Monge, Harlan Elrich, Jelena Figueroa, and Gene Gray 
opposed (Wilford Opp., Doc. 169) and the Union Defendants replied (Wilford Reply, Doc. 170). "
352,4," Plaintiffs Tina Matthews and Paul Tessaro opposed (Matthews Opp., Doc. 33) and the Union Defendants replied (Matthews 
Reply, Doc. 37)."
352,5," Plaintiffs Lori Bonner, Philip David Glick, Kimberly Jolie, and Michael Martin opposed (Martin State Opp., Doc. 79) and the 
State Defendants replied (Martin State Reply, Doc. 85.)"
352,6," Plaintiffs opposed (Martin Union Opp., Doc. 78) and the Union Defendants replied (Martin Union Reply, Doc. 87)."
352,7," Plaintiff Thomas Few opposed (Few Opp., Doc. 48) and United Teachers Los Angeles replied (Few Reply, Doc. 49.) "
354,8," As noted above, although the Martin Plaintiffs bring an identical claim, they consent to its dismissal pursuant to Knight. (Martin 
Union Opp. at 35.) "

355,10," The Wilford Plaintiffs suggest that their refunds for fees paid prior to Janus for post-Janus pay periods were incorrectly 
calculated. (See Wilford Opp. at 3-4.) The Pan Reply Declaration (Doc. 170-1) appears to answer their questions regarding the 
refund process, and regardless, whether the refunds were properly calculated is ""not properly before the Court."" See Lamberty 
v. Conn. St. Police Union, No. 3:15-CV-378 (VAB), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179805, 2018 WL 5115559, at *9 (D. Conn. Oct. 19, 
2018). "
357,11," HN9[
] Plaintiffs' proposed rule also fails ""because affirmative defenses need not relate to or rebut specific elements of an 
underlying claim."" Cook, 364 F. Supp. 3d at 1191 (citing Jarvis v. Cuomo, 660 F. Appx. 72, 75-76 (2d Cir. 2016)). "
362,12," Plaintiffs also argue, based on Callet v. Alioto, 210 Cal. 65, 290 P. 438 (1930), that Illeto does not apply because it involved 
statutory causes of action instead of common law causes of action, such as those asserted by Plaintiffs here. (See Wilford Opp. "
363,," at 20.) First, while Callet did distinguish between statutory and common law causes of action, the California Supreme Court has 
since rejected this proposition, concluding that there is ""no constitutional basis for distinguishing statutory from common-law 
rights merely because of their origin."" See L.A. Cty. v. Superior Court, 62 Cal.2d 839, 844, 44 Cal. Rptr. 796, 402 P.2d 868 
(1965). Further, Plaintiffs are simply wrong about Illeto, as it upheld a law ""intended to preempt common-law claims, such as 
general tort theories of liability."" 565 F.3d at 1135. "
364,13," The Matthews Plaintiffs' UCL claim is also barred by § 1159's broad language. See § 1159 (applying to ""any claims or actions 
under the law of this state""). Furthermore, even if it were not barred by § 1159, the UCL claim fails because the Union 
Defendants are not a ""business"" and collecting agency fees in compliance with state law is not a ""business act or practice."" See 
That v. Alders Maintenance Ass'n, 206 Cal. App. 4th 1419, 1427, 142 Cal. Rptr. 3d 458 (2012) (holding that homeowners' 
association was not subject to a UCL claim because it ""does not participate as a business in the commercial market, much less 
compete in it""). "
365,14," The Union Defendants also argue that the Martin Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge § 3558 because their respective unions 
already have their contact information pursuant to § 3558. (Martin Union Mem. at 23.) However, the harm that Plaintiffs identify 
is the fact that they were allegedly compelled to share the information, and thus the fact that the unions already have such 
information does not deprive Plaintiffs of standing."
365,15," The Union Defendants rely on the less-stringent exacting scrutiny standard articulated by the Supreme Court in John Doe No. 
1 v. Reed, 561 U.S. 186, 196, 130 S. Ct. 2811, 177 L. Ed. 2d 493 (2010), requiring only a ""substantial relation between the 
disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest."" Although this less-stringent standard is typically 
applied in compelled disclosure cases and has been applied by the Ninth Circuit as recently as last year, see Ams. For 
Prosperity Found v. Becerra, 903 F.3d 1000, 1008 (9th Cir. 2018), Mentele suggested that ""in the context of organized labor,"" 
the more stringent standard applies. See Mentele, 916 F.3d at 790. Here, which version of exacting scrutiny is applied has no 
bearing on the outcome, as the Court concludes that § 3558 withstands the more stringent standard articulated in Mentele."
365,16," See also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 66, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976) (disclosed financial transactions with 
political candidate or party would ""reveal much about a person's activities, associations, and beliefs"") (internal quotation marks 
omitted); John Doe No. 1, 561 U.S.at 194-96 (individual's signature on petition would disclose his views on statute concerning 
gay rights). "
369,17," Just like the Martin Plaintiffs, the plaintiff in Crockett conceded that her claim was foreclosed by Knight. See Crockett, 2019 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42923, 2019 WL 1212082, at *8. "
371,1," The plaintiffs also allege certain facts regarding participation levels in Tier I teams. Those allegations are not directly relevant to 
this motion because, as discussed below, Black Bear hopes to get a charter to organize a Tier II club."
371,2," Importantly, Black Bear does not sponsor these three teams but rather simply provides them its ice rink facilities. "
372,3," Black Bear's citation is not quite correct. It is not by-law 1.2.5 but rather paragraph 1.2.5 of the Association's rules and 
regulations that sets out the relevant additional ice limitation. "
375,4," The Court also notes that Black Bear has apparently not attempted to allege, as the Seventh Circuit has suggested may be 
sufficient, that the additional ice rule imposes an ""additional burden"" unique to particular group of plaintiffs sufficient to satisfy the 
injury-in-fact requirement. See Freedom from Religion Found., 773 F.3d at 825. That said, it is not clear to the Court that such an 
allegation [*18]  would be sufficient to confer standing under that and subsequent cases. See id.; see also Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 
1548 (noting that concreteness is a separate requirement distinct from particularity and that the latter does not satisfy the 
former). "
377,1," Kentucky has a similar antitrust law, KRS 367.175, but Plaintiff asserted only a federal claim. "
386,1," As we must at this stage, we take all of IQ's well-pleaded facts as true. See Gelboim v. Bank of Am. Corp., 823 F.3d 759, 769 
(2d Cir. 2016). "
388,2," The district court dismissed IQ's price-fixing claims because competitors cannot claim injury from supracompetitive prices. See 
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 582-83, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986) (""Nor 
can respondents recover damages for any conspiracy by petitioners to charge higher than competitive prices . . . . Such conduct 
would indeed violate the Sherman Act, but it could not injure respondents: as petitioners' competitors, respondents stand to gain 
from any conspiracy to raise the market prices . . . "" (internal citations omitted)). IQ does not pursue a price-fixing antitrust 
conspiracy claim on appeal. "
389,3," The Defendants maintain that because their anticompetitive behavior is the but-for cause of IQ's agreement with SourceOne, 
any IQ sale made through SourceOne-affiliated websites constitutes an ongoing benefit to IQ. But the cases cited by the 
Defendants deny standing to plaintiffs who experience an ongoing beneficial market condition as a result of the defendants' 
conduct—not a one-time market opportunity. By contrast, the Defendants' ongoing boycotts have the continuing effect of 
restricting the number of sales IQ makes through SourceOne-affiliated websites. "
390,4," IQ argues that the district court erred by applying the ""target area test."" We abandoned that test over thirty years ago in 
Crimpers Promotions Inc. v. Home Box Office, Inc., 724 F.2d 290, 292-93 (2d Cir. 1983). In any event, the district court did not 
apply the ""target area test"" when it found that IQ had not suffered a direct injury under the first efficient-enforcer factor. The 
""target area test"" used to ask whether a plaintiff was within ""that sector of the economy which is endangered by a breakdown of 
competitive conditions in the particular industry."" Id. at 292 (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court did not ask that 
question. It properly asked whether IQ was a ""target"" of the Defendants' unlawful conspiracy in the context of assessing whether 
that injury was sufficiently direct. "
394,5," We express no opinion at this stage as to the district court's finding that the existence of an independent tort of civil conspiracy 
in New Jersey did not raise a question of conflict of laws. IQ has properly pleaded a tortious interference claim from which its 
claim for civil conspiracy (under the law of either jurisdiction) can be derived. "
396,1," We previously terminated Maui Jim's first two motions to dismiss as moot. (Dkt. No. 310.) We did so because, after Maui Jim 
filed these motions, SBG filed a second amended counterclaim. (2d Am. Countercl. (Dkt. No. 259).) It is generally black letter 
law that an ""amended pleading supersedes the original pleading."" Wellness Cmty.-Nat'l v. Wellness House, 70 F.3d 46, 49 (7th 
Cir. 1995) (citing Lubin v. Chi. Title and Trust Co., 260 F.2d 411, 413 (7th Cir. 1958); Nisbet v. Van Tuyl, 224 F.2d 66, 71 (7th 
Cir. 1955); Fry v. UAL Corp., 895 F. Supp. 1018 (N.D. Ill. 1995)). ""Once an amended pleading is interposed, the original pleading 
no longer performs any function in the case."" Id. (quoting 6 C. Wright, A. Miller, & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and 
Procedure § 1476 at 556-57, 559 (1990)). Although Maui Jim refers to its first two motions to dismiss in its latest motion to 
dismiss, (Dkt. No. 278 at 1), it does not expressly renew its prior motions on what had become superseded pleadings. The 
parties now jointly move to reinstate Maui Jim's first two motions, either by vacating our earlier termination of the motions, or by 
treating those motions and the briefing on them as renewed instanter. (Dkt. No. 311 at 4.) The parties argue that SBG's second 
amended counterclaim was filed ""without change"" from its previous version, and that Maui Jim incorporated by reference its 
arguments to dismiss SBG's other counterclaims in its latest motion on the second amended counterclaim. (Id. at 3-4.) Of 
course, the amended and second amended counterclaims are not identical. (Compare Am. Countercl. (Dkt. No. 131) ¶ 9, with 2d 
Am. Countercl. ¶ 8 (stating same information at different paragraph number, with discrepancy continuing throughout the 
remainder of the documents).) While we do not wish to foster ""needlessly duplicative pleadings and make-work for district 
courts"" or for litigants, Scott v. Chuhak & Tecson, P.C., 725 F.3d 772, 782 (7th Cir. 2013), the parties' previous submissions on 
now-superseded claims have required us to hold the various pleadings up to the light to compare their content and ensure 
accurate exposition of the operative allegations and arguments. However, the parties' general argument is well taken that the 
issues remain the same and the briefing adequate to address them. Accordingly, we grant the parties' joint motion to reinstate 
Maui Jim's prior motions to dismiss instanter [**3] , and we consider those motions and arguments in this opinion. "
400,2," The parties' briefs refer to paragraph numberings in SBG's amended counterclaim, which are off by one from the paragraph 
numberings in the second amended counterclaim. (Compare Am. Countercl. (Dkt. No. 131) ¶ 27, with 2d Am. Countercl. ¶ 26 
(identical).) This opinion uses the second amended counterclaim, as the operative pleading, see supra n.1, to reference the 
relevant paragraphs and the parties' arguments pertaining to them."
400,3," The parties' arguments center on four paragraphs in SBG's counterclaims. (See 2d Am. Countercl. ¶¶ 26, 27, 29, 30.) The 
parties agree that paragraphs 26 and 27 of SBG's second amended counterclaim are not defamatory statements, and we thus 
do not consider them in our analysis. (See Mem. at 11; Resp. at 3 (clarifying that these paragraphs are not defamatory 
statements, but provide context in which defamatory statements are made).) "
401,4," Paragraph 28 indicates that the press release is ""[a]ttached hereto as Exhibit A."" (2d Am. Countercl. ¶ 28.) While the full press 
release was attached as an exhibit to SBG's first amended counterclaim, (see Dkt. No. 131-1), it is not attached to SBG's 
second amended counterclaim. Nonetheless, ""pleadings may incorporate earlier pleadings by reference, Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c),"" 
Macklin v. Butler, 553 F.2d 525, 528 (7th Cir. 1977). Accordingly, we consider the full press release attached to SBG's prior 
pleading as incorporated by reference in SBG's second amended counterclaim. "
408,5," Maui Jim has filed two versions of its memorandum of law in support of its motion to dismiss SBG's EU Antitrust Claim, one 
public, the other under seal. (See Dkt. No. 199 (public); Dkt. No. 200 (under seal); see also Dkt. No. 323 (granting filing under 
seal).) The two versions are identical aside from select redactions in the text of the memorandum and three sealed exhibits. This 
opinion refers only to the public version unless otherwise specified. "
410,6," Federal Rule 44.1 states, in relevant part, ""In determining foreign law, the court may consider any relevant material or source, 
including testimony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 
44.1. "
413,7," Two of SBG's affirmative defenses are labeled ""Fourth Defense,"" one for exhaustion and the other for unclean hands. (Answer 
at 31-32.) Maui Jim's motion to strike is directed at SBG's unclean hands defense. (MJ Cal. Mem. at 20.) "
422,1," Illinois Brick held that the direct-purchaser requirement applies to claims for damages. Illinois Brick did not address injunctive 
relief, and we likewise do not address injunctive relief in this case."
422,2," Thirty States and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs, and they argue that C should be able to 
sue A in that hypothetical. They ask us to overrule Illinois Brick to allow such suits. In light of our ruling in favor of the plaintiffs in 
this case, we have no occasion to consider that argument for overruling Illinois Brick. "
427,1," For this reason, it’s hard to make sense of the suggestion that Illinois Brick may not apply to claims for injunctive relief, ante, at 
___, n. 1, 203 L. Ed. 2d, at 809. Under our normal rule of construction, a plaintiff who’s not proximately harmed by a defendant’s 
unlawful conduct has no cause of action to sue the defendant for any type of relief. Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control 
Components, Inc., 572 U. S. 118, 135, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014) (although a plaintiff that “cannot quantify its 
losses with sufficient certainty to recover damages . . . may still be entitled to injunctive relief,” the requirement of proximate 
causation “must be met in every case”). "
428,2," Plaintiffs haven’t argued (and so have forfeited in this Court any argument) that Apple’s imposition of the 99-cent rule was itself 
an antitrust violation that injured consumers by raising the price of apps above competitive levels. They didn’t mention the 99-
cent rule in their complaint in district court or in their briefs to the court of appeals. And, as I’ve noted, they concede that they are 
seeking damages “based solely on” the 30% commission. Brief in Opposition 5."
428,3," The Court denies that allowing both consumers and developers to sue over the same allegedly unlawful commission will “result 
in ‘conflicting claims to a common fund’” as Illinois Brick feared. Ante, at ___, 203 L. Ed. 2d, at 813. But Apple charged only one 
commission on each sale. So even assuming for argument’s sake that the 30% commission was entirely illegal, Apple can only 
be required to pay out in damages, at most, the full amount it received in commissions. To their credit, even plaintiffs have 
conceded as much, acknowledging that because “there is only one 30% markup,” any claim by the developers against Apple 
would necessarily be seeking “a piece of the same 30% pie.” Brief in Opposition 12. It’s a mystery why the Court refuses to 
accept that sensible concession. "
438,1," The SAC alleges that Defendants 321 Henderson and Wentworth maintain their respective principal places of business in the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania, while Defendant Seneca maintains its principal place of business in Maryland. (Id. ¶¶ 34-36). "
439,2," The SAC alleges that Defendant Heretick is a ""citizen"" of the Commonwealth of Virginia. (Id. ¶ 33)."
439,3," The SAC also names Symmetra Life Insurance Company as a Nominal Defendant, however Symmetra was dismissed by 
stipulation on April 8, 2019. (ECF 107). "
440,4," The original Complaint also alleged claims against Defendant Structured Settlement Investments LP (""SSILP""). Plaintiff told the 
Court that he would not pursue claims against that Defendant and dropped the company as a Defendant in the Amended 
Complaint. (ECF 75). "
441,5," Plaintiff also names several insurance companies making payments on the annuities as ""Nominal Defendants."" "
442,6," The SAC also removed a remaining allegation that the Virginia state court judges participated in the alleged fraudulent scheme. 
(Compare Am. Compl. ¶ 150, with SAC ¶ 150). "
445,7," Defendants make much ado of the fact that Plaintiff supposedly ""admitted"" that he was a state-court loser during oral argument 
on the previous motions to dismiss. At that argument, held on August 22, 2018, the Court asked Plaintiff's counsel whether this 
element of the Rooker-Feldman doctrine was met. (See ECF 70, Hrg. Tr., Aug. 22, 2018, at 7:5-9). Plaintiff's counsel replied, ""I 
think it's accurate to say that for the purposes of this case, the plaintiff is a loser in the sense that . . . the injury that he sustained 
would not have been sustained if the court had denied the petition, and the court granted the petition."" (Id. at 7:20-8:1). The 
Court is not persuaded that this response amounted to a concession or waiver of the first Great Western element. "
448,8," Plaintiff is also not claiming that the state-court orders were simply procured by fraud. As noted above, the Third Circuit has yet 
to adopt a fraud exception to the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. Defendants argue that claims contesting state-court judgments on 
the basis that those judgments were allegedly procured by fraud are more appropriately brought in state court. See Johnson, 
551 F.3d at 569 (""If [the plaintiff] believes the state court was wrong [in its legal determination] or that he was induced 
fraudulently to sign away his rights . . . , his remedy is to ask the state circuit court to set aside the agreed order [between the 
parties.]""); Campbell, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 115722, 2017 WL 3142118, at *4 (""[W]hether a state court judgment should be 
subject to collateral attack or review is an issue best left to the state courts."" (citing Fielder v. Credit Acceptance Corp., 188 F.3d 
1031, 1035-36 (8th Cir. 1999))). It appears that there is a vehicle to bring such a claim in Virginia state court. See Va. Code § 
8:01-428 (""This section does not limit the power of the court to entertain at any time an independent action to relieve a party from 
any judgment or proceedings, . . . or to set aside a judgment or decree for fraud upon the court.""). Plaintiff here has alleged a 
complicated, years-long scheme meant to take advantage of annuitants and subvert the review of state-court judges. These 
allegations raise claims wholly separate from an appeal of the state-court orders, and present more for this Court to consider 
than a plain lie or fraud on the state court. "
452,9," Defendant Heretick also contends that Plaintiff cannot allege that he participated in conducting the affairs of an enterprise 
because the SAC simply alleges that he was acting in his professional capacity as an attorney. "
454,10," Plaintiff has now had several years to investigate his claims, and the Court will not readily grant any requests to add new 
defendants as that would only further delay the start of trial."
454,11," Plaintiff also alleges that, because the mail fraud statute was violated, the transferred funds violate 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956 and 
1957 (money laundering). (SAC ¶¶ 163, 194(c)). However, if Defendants did not violate the mail fraud statute, the other two 
provisions cannot be predicate acts. Both provisions require that the underlying funds be criminally obtained and the only 
underlying criminal activity alleged by Plaintiff is mail fraud. Therefore, this Court need only determine whether the predicate acts 
of mail fraud are adequately pled. The SAC references Defendants' use of wire transfers to effectuate their scheme. (SAC ¶¶ 162, 177(c), 194(c)). Because 
Plaintiff does not plead the predicate act of wire fraud, we do not address it here."
454,12," Defendant Heretick also argues that the SAC fails to allege that his own mailings were themselves fraudulent or unlawful. But 
the mail fraud statute does not require that the mailings themselves be fraudulent. Kehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926 
F.2d 1406, 1415 (3d Cir. 1991) (""[C]ompletely 'innocent' mailings can satisfy the mailing element.""). Moreover, ""the use of the 
mails need not be an essential element of the scheme,"" Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 710, 109 S. Ct. 1443, 103 L. 
Ed. 2d 734 (1989), and ""[t]he defendant does not have to send the mailing or wire communication personally."" In re Am Inv'rs 
Life Ins., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64967, 2007 WL 2541216, at *22 (citing Pereira v. United States, 347 U.S. 1, 8-9, 74 S. Ct. 358, 
98 L. Ed. 435 (1954)). "
455,13," Defendant Heretick argues that he is immune from liability because the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which derives from 
antitrust law, protects ""[t]hose who petition government for redress."" Prof'l Real Estate Inv'rs, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 
Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 56, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993); see also Giles v. Phelan, Hallinan & Schmieg, LLP, No. 11-
6239, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 78161, 2013 WL 2444036, at *6-8 (D.N.J. June 4, 2013) (applying the Noerr-Pennington doctrine in 
a RICO context). But Plaintiff's claims are not based solely on Heretick's petitioning activities before the Virginia state court. 
Rather, the SAC alleges that Heretick took part in an ongoing scheme meant to induce annuitants to sell their SSA streams on 
unfavorable terms, strip annuitants of their rights to independent counsel, and fashion transfer petitions in such a way that they 
would be granted despite procedural safeguards. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine therefore does not shield Heretick from 
Plaintiff's claims. "
456,14," Because Plaintiff has failed to allege the existence of a fiduciary duty, it follows that he has failed to allege ""aiding and 
abetting"" the breach of said duty. "
460,1," To the extent that the Court relies on objected-to evidence, it relies only on admissible evidence, and therefore the objections 
are OVERRULED. See Godinez v. Alta-Dena Certified Dairy LLC, No. CV 15-01652 RSWL (SSx), 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
187253, 2016 WL 6915509, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 29, 2016). "
464,2," Because the Court determines that the § 851.8 petition does not qualify as a ""proceeding"" against Plaintiff, it need not address 
Defendant's argument that the § 851.8 petition is inadmissible. See Mot. 9:4-10:15 "
472,1," Plaintiff asserts that the ""sufficient particularity"" pleading standard applies only to claims under the California Uniform Trade 
Secrets Act (""CUTSA""), and not the DTSA. See Opp. at 9. Not so. The majority of courts in this district have held that the same 
standard is applied to both DTSA and CUTSA claims because ""[t]he elements of misappropriation under the DTSA are similar to 
those under the CUTSA."" Alta Devices, 343 F. Supp. 3d at 877; see id. at 880-81 (""Courts have held that the DTSA and the 
CUTSA share the same pleading requirements for the identification of trade secrets.""). But see Physician's Surrogacy, Inc. v. 
German, No. 17CV0718-MMA (WVG), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135325, 2017 WL 3622329, at *9 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 23, 2017). "
474,2," It is true, as Defendants note, that the court in Avago Techs. U.S. Inc. v. Nanoprecision Prod., Inc., No. 16-CV-03737-JCS, 
2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13484, 2017 WL 412524 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 31, 2017) ruled the other way. However, Avago Techs pre-dates 
cases like AllCells and Cave Consulting, and its holding was informed in part by the plaintiff's inability to ""cite[] any authority 
suggesting that the DTSA allows a misappropriation claim to be asserted based on the continued use of information that was 
disclosed prior to the effective date of the statute."" 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13484, [WL] at *9. Since then, cases have consistently 
endorsed just that view. "
478,3," AlterG alleges Defendants induced Woodway to breach its confidentiality agreements with AlterG, but the complaint does not 
indicate that any such breach in confidentiality disrupted Woodway's supply of treadmills to AlterG. "
479,4," The only specific fact AlterG alleges in this regard is that Defendants' misrepresentation that the ""Boost One is suitable for use 
in medical markets or is approved for hospital and clinic use"" is displayed at ""woodway.com."" Compl. ¶ 44. However, as 
Defendants point out, AlterG has alleged no facts to suggest that this statement made on Woodway's website is attributable to 
Defendants. "
493,1," Consistent with the Court's prior orders, see ECF No. 931 at 3 n.2, the Court refers to these standards organizations as SSOs. "
495,2," Exhibits beginning with the letters ""CX"" are exhibits that the FTC introduced at trial. Exhibits beginning with the letters ""QX"" are 
exhibits that Qualcomm introduced at trial. Exhibits beginning with the letters ""JX"" are exhibits that the parties jointly introduced 
at trial. The first four numbers after those letters are the exhibit number. The numbers following the dash are the page number. 
Where the Court cites a page range in an exhibit, the Court uses the word ""to"" to denote that the Court is citing a range (e.g., 
QX2776-042 to -043). Where the Court cites multiple pages in an exhibit that are not within a page range, the Court uses a 
comma to indicate that the Court is citing multiple pages (e.g., QX2776-042, -044)."
495,3," All the Qualcomm witnesses have or had multiple titles and roles during their time at Qualcomm. Where the Court knows a 
witness's title at the time of a document or event, the witness is so identified. Where the Court does not know a witness's 
contemporaneous title, the Court identifies the witness by their current or last title at Qualcomm. "
496,4," Other terms for modem chips are baseband processors, application specific integrated circuits (""ASICs""), and chipsets. See, 
e.g., JX0051-004. For ease of reference, and in accordance with the parties' usage, the Court uses the term ""modem chip."" "
498,5," Project Phoenix was a 2015 Qualcomm analysis of whether to split QTL and QCT, and CalTech was the Project Phoenix code 
name for QCT. Tr. at 96:20-21. "
508,6," To avoid unnecessary redactions, the Court will refer to sealed information once and then not refer to it again unless 
necessary. "
536,7," Where the Court is not aware of a Qualcomm employee's job title, the Court identifies the individual's role solely as 
""Qualcomm."" "
558,8," There are two current or former Qualcomm executives named Sanjay (Sanjay Jha and Sanjay Mehta), ECF No. 1326, and it is 
not clear with which McGregor met. "
589,9," As the Court explained in Section V.E., Nokia followed Qualcomm's lead in licensing at the handset instead of the chipset level 
and thus to protect its licensing revenue supported Qualcomm at summary judgment and testified for Qualcomm at trial. "
632,1," According to RxStrategies, before acquiring Wellpartner, CVS had a ""one-to-one"" policy where one CVS pharmacy location 
would serve as a contract pharmacy to only one covered entity. RxStrategies alleges this policy protected CVS from potential "
633,340," B Program compliance violations. Dkt. 30, p. 17. Today, CVS allows each of its pharmacies to contract with more than one 
covered entity for the 340B Program."
633,2," RxStrategies does allege that ""[i]n 2016, CVS received $32 billion from specialty drugs, or 28% of all specialty drug prescription 
revenues."" Dkt. 30, p. 15. But this fact does not allow the Court to glean CVS's market power in the relevant, 340B contract 
pharmacy market. "
641,1, Bracketed numbers refer to entries on the district court docket.
641,2," This is a simplification. See [1] ¶ 11. Historically, state dental boards delegated to the American Dental Association the power 
to ""(i) determine which fields of dentistry qualify as specialties, and (ii) authorize specialty certifying boards to certify dentists as 
specialists within a given field."" Id. The American Dental Association recognizes nine specialties, but oral implantology (the ""field 
of dentistry dealing with the diafvgnosis, surgical placement, prosthetic reconstruction, and maintenance of dental implants,"" [1] 
¶ 5) is not one of them. [1] ¶ 50. "
642,3," The Academy chartered the American Board of Oral Implantology in 1967, [1] ¶¶ 6, 31, which in turn (along with three other 
professional organizations) formed the American Board of Dental Specialties in 2013. [1] ¶ 55. The Board of Dental Specialties 
then approved one of its creators, the Board of Oral Implantology, as a certifier of dentists in the field of implantology. [1] ¶ 30. "
643,4," They add that the new review procedures ""essentially ensure"" that the American Board of Dental Specialties is able to 
""perpetually protect the [American Board of Oral Implantology's] status as the sole specialty certifying board in oral 
implantology."" [1] ¶ 25. "
644,5," The complaint suggests, but does not quite allege, that in order to receive a certification from the American Board of Oral 
Implantology, dentists also must make payments to the Academy. See [1] ¶¶ 1, 4 (dentists seeking certifications ""generally pay 
membership dues to their specialty certifying board and/or its sponsoring organization (such as the [Academy] or the 
[International Congress of Oral Implantologists])""). Assuming that is true, the Academy might have partially overlapping interests 
with the American Board of Oral Implantology (both the Academy and the American Board of Oral Implantology would receive "
645,," more money if more dentists applied for certifications from the American Board of Oral Implantology). But partial overlap is not 
enough—there must be ""complete unity."" D'Last, 863 F.Supp. at 768."
645,6," The defendants engaged in parallel litigation and lobbying, but the complaint admits that such conduct is exempt under the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See [1] ¶ 76; E. R. R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 
523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); United Mine Workers of Am. v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965)."
645,7," That is, after all, fairly similar to what the International Congress of Oral Implantologists did when it formed the United States 
Board of Oral Implantology to serve as a body that approves certification applications from dentists. "
648,8," The motion to dismiss cites state statutes, federal case law and other administrative rules showing that, in at least five of those 
remaining states, dentists can advertise certifications from the United States Board of Oral Implantology as freely as they can 
advertise certifications by the American Board of Oral Implantology. [34] at 23. "
649,9," The defendants might have limited output in ""the market for certifications issued by specialty certifying boards that were 
approved by the American Board of Dental Specialties."" But that is not the market alleged in the complaint. And again, ""[p]roduct 
markets are not defined in terms of one trademark or another."" Generac Corp., 172 F.3d at 977. See also Kaiser Aluminum & 
Chem. Corp. v. F.T.C., 652 F.2d 1324, 1330 (7th Cir. 1981) (""well-defined submarkets may exist which, in themselves, constitute 
product markets for antitrust purposes,"" but the ""boundaries of such a submarket may be determined by examining such 
practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the submarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar 
characteristics and uses, unique production facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and 
specialized vendors""). "
650,10," The complaint also lists fifty unnamed Doe defendants ""whose identities and roles will be developed through discovery and 
Plaintiffs' independent investigations."" [1] ¶ 38. Normally, ""'John Doe' defendants are not permitted in federal diversity suits"" 
because ""the existence of diversity jurisdiction cannot be determined without knowledge of every defendant's place of 
citizenship."" Howell by Goerdt v. Tribune Entm't Co., 106 F.3d 215, 218 (7th Cir. 1997). But ""[a]n exception applies when the 
John Does are nominal parties—nothing more than placeholders 'in the event that during discovery [the plaintiff] identifie[s] any 
additional defendants he wishe[s] to add to the suit."" Pain Ctr. of SE Indiana LLC v. Origin Healthcare Sols. LLC, 893 F.3d 454, 
459 (7th Cir. 2018) (citing Moore v. Gen. Motors Pension Plans, 91 F.3d 848, 850 (7th Cir. 1996)) (""[t]he 150 John Does are 
mere placeholders, so we can safely ignore them for purposes of diversity jurisdiction""). The Doe defendants in the complaint 
are ""mere placeholders,"" so ""jurisdiction is secure."" Id."
650,11," Other courts have applied this rule to the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. See, e.g., Underground Solutions, 
Inc. v. Palermo, No. 13 C 8407, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132441, 2014 WL 4703925, at *10 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 22, 2014); Purepecha 
Enters. v. El Matador Spices & Dry Chiles, No. 11 C 2569, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120499, 2012 WL 3686776, at *15 (N.D. Ill. 
Aug. 24, 2012); Maui Jim, Inc. v. SmartBuy Guru Enters., No. 1:16 CV 9788, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10093, 2018 WL 509960, at 
*5 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 23, 2018) (""[a]lthough the [U]DTPA does not contain text expressly confining its application to events or 
circumstances arising in Illinois, there is a 'long-standing rule of construction in Illinois which holds that a 'statute is without 
extraterritorial effect unless a clear intent in this respect appears from the express provisions of the statute'""). "
651,12," Plaintiffs attached to their opposition an email that the Academy sent to its members saying it was the ""only organization that 
serves implant dentists."" [40-5] at 2. But even if misleading, the statement is not disparaging to the plaintiffs' goods or services; it 
does not even mention them. See 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 510/2. "
654,1," Having read and considered the papers presented by the parties, the Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without 
a hearing. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 78; Local Rule 7-15. Accordingly, the hearing set for June 3, 2019, at 1:30 p.m. is hereby vacated 
and off calendar."
654,2," Jackson contends that The Estate of Thomas E. Schertz is not a proper party to this action. While The Estate of Thomas E. 
Schertz is listed on the caption page of the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiff does not name it as a party on any of the seven 
causes of action. "
660,1," The Court refers to Plaintiff as ""Larsen"" throughout this Order, as she is functionally the Plaintiff in this action because her 
entities are not registered with the State of Texas and she is the only individual associated with these assumed names. (Pl.'s 
Resp. [#94] at 3.) "
663,2," The Supreme Court explained that ""[i]n limited circumstances, copyright owners may file an infringement suit before 
undertaking registration. If a copyright owner is preparing to distribute a work of a type vulnerable to predistribution 
infringement—notably, a movie or musical composition—the owner may apply for preregistration."" Fourth Estate Pub. Benefit 
Corp., 139 S. Ct. at 888. No party is asserting that this limited circumstance applies here."
663,3," Copyright registrations, once approved, are retroactively effective from the date the application was filed. 17 U.S.C. § 410(d). "
664,4," Larsen explains in her briefing that she submitted an additional application to the Copyright Office on July 28, 2017 but has still 
not received a certificate of registration or a rejection notification regarding this application. (Pl.'s Brief [#95] at 3.) Larsen 
believes the application was closed or suspended due to an unknown administrative error. (Id.)"
664,5," In light of this holding, the Court need not and will not address Defendants' alternative arguments for summary judgment on 
Larsen's copyright claim related to their affirmative defense of a copyright license agreement between the parties governing 
Larsen's work at issue. However, the Court will note that it appears that the agreement attached to Defendants' answer and 
counterclaims, which was signed by Larsen on January 30, 2017, is enforceable. (Copyright License Agreement [#42-1] at 2-4.) 
The agreement grants Want2Scrap ""an exclusive, transferable license to use [Larsen's] work in the course of its business."" (Id.) 
The arguments raised by Larsen to support her contention that the agreement is invalid, such as her argument the agreement is 
invalid because it lacks Parrish's signature, do not appear to be supported by Texas or Indiana law (regardless of which applies)

667,6," Larsen did, however, attach an affidavit to her own motion for partial summary judgment, in which she simply reiterates that 
Parrish repeatedly told Larsen she would prosper from their relationship. (Larsen Decl. [#62-1] at ¶ 5.) "
672,1," Subdivision (d) of Rule 56 ""carries forward without substantial change the provisions of former subdivision (f)."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 
56, Advisory Committee Note to the 2010 Amendments."
672,2," Seattle amended the Ordinance in January 2019 to eliminate the provisions authorizing collective bargaining over the nature 
and amount of payments between drivers and ride referral companies. See Dkt. # 100-1."
672,3," Plaintiffs argue that the labor exemption applies only in the context of an employer-employee relationship, not to independent 
contractors. The exemption uses the phrase ""labor of a human being,"" however, and a recent Supreme Court decision makes 
clear that, at the time the Clayton Act was written, even the narrower term ""employment"" encompassed both master-servant 
relationships and independent contractors. New Prime Inc. v. Oliveira, ___ U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 532, 542-44, 202 L. Ed. 2d 
536 (2019). "
675,1," In their pleadings, the parties refer to the restrictive term as being for ten months, even though certain contracts specify an 
eight-month restrictive term. For the sake of simplicity, the Court will refer to the restrictive term as being for ten months for all 
drivers at issue. Additionally, the parties have produced hundreds of Driver Contracts to the Court, all of which appear to contain 
the same material terms, with the exception of the duration of the restrictive term. The parties have not identified any material 
differences in any of the contracts, and the Court will cite to only one contract as representative of the entire body of contracts. "
676,2," It is unclear whether plaintiff considers a driver to be within the restrictive term of his contract until he has worked for plaintiff for 
ten months, or whether plaintiff considers the restrictive term to have lapsed ten months after the driver signed the contract. 
Defendant asserts that plaintiff operates under the former interpretation. (Doc. 140-1, at 16-17). Although plaintiff ""[d]enie[s]"" 
these assertions (Doc. 159-1, at 40-41), plaintiff does not clearly explain its interpretation of when the restrictive terms lapse. 
(See Doc. 130, at 11 (""Ten months after [plaintiff's] drivers fulfill the period for which they agreed to drive for [plaintiff], these 
previously unqualified drivers are available to [defendant] and other competitors . . .."")). Further, plaintiff asserts that when the 
restrictive terms expire is immaterial to the current issues because, plaintiff urges, ""all of the drivers at issue herein were hired by 
[defendant] within the restrictive term of their respective contract obligations."" (Doc. 159-1, at 41)."
676,3," The Court notes that the Pre-Employment Agreements provide that each trainee will repay plaintiff for the costs of training and 
also contain non-competition provisions. (See, e.g., Doc. 159-9, at 243-44). The parties do not, however, argue their motions for 
summary judgment with respect to these provisions in the Pre-Employment Agreements. The Court's focus will, thus, remain on 
the Driver Contracts."
676,4," Plaintiff has identified 250 drivers as being at issue in this case. (Docs. 140-1, at 33; 159-1, at 79). Plaintiff has provided a 
spreadsheet that identifies each of the drivers at issue. (Doc. 130-7, at 75-79). Although there are 251 individuals listed on the 
spreadsheet, one name appears twice. (See id., at 75). Based on the parties' representations that only 250 drivers are at issue 
here, the Court assumes that the name that appears twice belongs to the same individual. "
682,5," The Court notes that although defendant has not identified any contract that defendant contends was avoided, plaintiff has not 
come forward with conclusive evidence that no contract was avoided. The Court, therefore, cannot conclusively find that 
defendant is unable to prove that any contract was avoided. "
683,6," The Court notes that the Delaware Supreme Court's John Roane decision was issued two years before the Iowa Supreme 
Court's Mutual Loan decision. Thus, the Delaware Supreme Court's decision was available to the Iowa Supreme Court when the 
Iowa Supreme Court decided Mutual Loan. "
684,7," The Iowa Supreme Court has, on one occasion, referenced the Delaware Supreme Court's John Roane decision. See Ehlers v. 
Iowa Warehouse Co., 188 N.W.2d 368, 370 (Iowa 1971) (referring to John Roane, Inc. v. Tweed as Roane, Inc. v. Tweed). It is 
the lower court's John Roane decision, however, that this Court is concerned with."
684,8," The Restatement (Second) of Contracts, Section 8 addresses this very issue. Section 8 reads: ""An unenforceable contract 
is one for the breach of which neither the remedy of damages nor the remedy of specific performance is available, but which is 
recognized in some other way as creating a duty of performance, though there has been no ratification."" Comment a to Section 
8 elaborates: a. Distinction between ""voidable"" and ""unenforceable."" Just as a contract may be voidable by one party or by either party, 
so it may be enforceable by one and not by the other or it may be unenforceable by either. Similarly, one party to an 
unenforceable contract may have a power to make the contract enforceable by all the usual remedies, and both voidable 
and unenforceable contracts may have collateral consequences. Voidable contracts might be defined as one type of 
unenforceable contract. As defined here, however, the term unenforceable contract refers to rules under which the duty of 
performance does not depend solely on the election of one party. In the transactions here classified as unenforceable, 
some legal consequences other than the [*31]  creation of a power of ratification follow without further action by either 
party. "
687,9," As explained above, some contracts are for a term of ten months and others are for a term of eight months. (Compare Doc. 
130-2, at 51, with id., at 57). This difference is immaterial in considering whether the restrictive covenants operate as a lifetime 
ban. Further, the parties do not argue that this difference is material, nor do the parties point to any other differences in the 
restrictive covenants contained in the various contracts at issue."
687,10," The Court notes that the witness did not, himself, make this statement. Rather, defense counsel asked: ""And, in fact, it is the 
position of CRST that if a driver does not either complete his contract term or pay off his contract, he cannot work for another 
motor carrier for the rest of his life?"" (Doc. 140-2, at 16). The witness responded ""Correct."" (Id.). Plaintiff does not take issue with 
this characterization of the testimony, however, and the Court will therefore consider the characterization to be inconsequential. "
688,11," Defendant has not advised whether a ""Contract Notice Letter"" was sent for each driver at issue here. From prior proceedings 
in this case, the Court understands that defendant inquires as to a driver's past employment history with other trucking 
companies before hiring the driver. Mistakes can happen, however, especially when dealing with such a large volume of drivers. 
Defendant does not argue that it was not advised that any of the drivers at issue were ""under contract,"" and the Court will 
therefore assume that defendant received a ""Contract Notice Letter"" for each of the 250 drivers at issue here. "
690,12," As is discussed below, plaintiff's intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim requires plaintiff to show 
that defendant acted with the intent to damage plaintiff. Compiano, 588 N.W.2d at 464. Should the jury find that defendant 
intended to interfere with the contracts, it does not necessarily follow that defendant did so because defendant wanted to 
damage plaintiff. Because the two concepts differ, the Court's differing conclusions on the two claims are not inconsistent with 
each other. "
692,13," The Court notes that the fact of drivers leaving plaintiff's employ in spite of the restrictive covenants could be relevant to 
determining whether the restrictive covenants are effective in encouraging retention. This, however, is a different inquiry than 
assessing damages stemming from the drivers leaving plaintiff's employ. "
694,14," In Thompson v. Kaczinski, 774 N.W.2d 829, 836-38 (Iowa 2009) the Iowa Supreme Court adopted a modified approach to 
considering proximate cause in cases addressing physical and emotional harm. The Iowa Supreme Court has not been called 
on to determine if this modified approach also applies to cases involving purely economic torts. This Court need not consider the 
issue, however, because factual causation is dispositive."
694,15," In TransAm, this Court found that ""nothing in Thompson, or the subsequent decisions of the Iowa Supreme Court, [suggests] 
that Iowa's adoption of the causation principles set forth in the [Restatement (Third) of Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional 
Harm] has changed the traditional analysis of factual causation under Iowa law."" 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135900, 2018 WL 
3738017, at *15. The Court's conclusions remain unchanged, even when considering cases that were decided after TransAm. "
695,16," In Palmer, the Iowa Supreme Court acknowledged in a footnote that ""[t]he court of appeals . . . identified four elements of 
recovery on the basis of unjust enrichment, including the element that there be no at-law remedy available to the plaintiff. See 
Iowa Waste Sys., Inc. v. Buchanan Cty., 617 N.W.2d 23, 30 (Iowa Ct. App. 2000)."" Palmer, 637 N.W.2d at 154 n.2. See also 
Union Pac. R.R. Co. v. Cedar Rapids & Iowa City Ry. Co., 477 F. Supp. 2d 980, 1000 (N.D. Iowa 2007) (holding that an element 
of an unjust enrichment claim is that ""there is no at-law remedy that can appropriately address the claim"" (citations omitted)). 
The Iowa Supreme Court went on to agree that ""[t]he adequacy of a legal remedy is a general limitation on the exercise of equity 
jurisdiction and is properly considered when restitution is sought in equity."" Palmer, 637 N.W.2d at 154 n.2. The Iowa Supreme 
Court stopped short of adopting the Court of Appeals' holding, however, in determining that ""no independent principle exists that 
restricts restitution to cases where alternative remedies are inadequate."" Id. (citation omitted). The parties have not addressed 
the adequacy of a legal remedy with respect to plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim, and the Court will, thus, decline to address the 
issue, including the issue of whether the adequacy of a legal remedy is a separate and distinct element of plaintiff's claim."
695,17," Under Iowa law, unjust enrichment is ""an equitable doctrine based on the concept of an implied contract."" EAD Control Sys., 
LLC v. Besser Co. USA, No. C 11-4029-MWB, 2012 WL 2357572, at *3 (N.D. Iowa June 19, 2012) (citation and internal 
quotation marks omitted). ""[A]n express contract and an implied contract cannot coexist with respect to the same subject matter, 
and the law will not imply a contract where there is an express contract."" Id. (citations, alterations, and internal quotation marks 
omitted). The parties have not raised an issue as to whether an express contract is implicated as to plaintiff's unjust enrichment 
claim, and the Court, therefore, will not address the issue. "
696,18," The measure of defendant's benefit is not necessarily the same as the measure of damages plaintiff may recover. The issue of 
damages is addressed below."
696,19," Under Iowa law, ""[t]he doctrine of unjust enrichment is an equitable principle."" Johnson v. Dodgen, 451 N.W.2d 168, 175 (Iowa 
1990). Iowa generally does not afford the right to a jury trial on those claims that sound in equity. Weltzin v. Nail, 618 N.W.2d 
293, 296-97 (Iowa 2000). Here, the parties have demanded a jury trial. (Docs. 43, at 10; 44, at 1). Before trial, the Court may be 
called upon to address whether to submit plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim to the jury. "
697,20," The Court finds that there is no real dispute as to whether plaintiff competes with a number of companies, as opposed to just 
with defendant. This case is one in a series of four cases filed in this Court against purported CRST Competitors, and each of 
the cases rests on the same basic allegations and factual assertions. See TransAm, 1:16-cv-00052-LTS; CRST Expedited, Inc. "
698,," v. Knight Transp., Inc., 1:17-cv-00024-CJW-KEM; CRST Expedited, Inc. v. JB Hunt Transp., Inc., 1:17-cv-00026-CJW-KEM. 
Knight and Swift merged in 2017 to form Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings, Inc. Thus, the Court will consider Knight-Swift 
Transportation Holdings to be one company that competes with plaintiff, rather than two separate entities that both compete with 
plaintiff. That the number of companies plaintiff competes with was reduced by one, however, is of no consequence to the 
Court's analysis because there remain three separate competitor companies—TransAm, JB Hunt, and Knight-Swift 
Transportation Holdings—that the Court can readily identify."
698,21," The Court notes that defendant argues this section of its motion for summary judgment with reference to Iowa state law, but 
plaintiff's arguments in resistance are made largely with reference to federal law. (Compare Docs. 140, at 42-45 with 159, at 49-
58). Regardless of which body of law applies, the Court's conclusions would be the same because the Court finds that the 
injunctive relief sought would not remedy the harm alleged. See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 32, 129 S. Ct. 365, 
172 L. Ed. 2d 249 (2008) (""An injunction is a matter of equitable discretion; it does not follow from success on the merits as a 
matter of course."" (citation omitted)); Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 313, 102 S. Ct. 1798, 72 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1982) 
(""[A] federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law."" (citations 
omitted))."
698,22," In its Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, plaintiff requests that the Court ""dismiss[ ]"" the subject affirmative defenses. (Doc. 
127, at 2). In its brief, however, plaintiff only requests that the Court find that the subject affirmative defenses ""fail as a matter of 
law."" (Doc. 130, at 23). Plaintiff has not asserted a procedural basis upon which the Court can strike the affirmative defenses, 
and plaintiff's arguments regarding the affirmative defenses are offered with reference to summary judgment law. (See, e.g., id., 
at 5). The Court will, thus, construe plaintiff's motion as seeking a judgment that the subject affirmative defenses fail as a matter 
of law, and the Court will not consider plaintiff's motion as seeking to strike the affirmative defenses. "
705,1," For avoidance of doubt, this amount is intended to be equivalent to the maximum limit in the definition of Exception in the FTC

(1972), but that case does not address the filed rate doctrine's preclusive effect on antitrust laws. "
726,6," In Breiding, the Court concluded that retail electricity consumers who had alleged the same anticompetitive conduct against 
Defendants did not have standing after considering the six factors germane to antitrust standing analysis, especially where 
plaintiffs' antitrust injury was ""indirect and only remotely connected to [d]efendants' alleged anticompetitive conduct"" and the 
""nature of any damages is attenuated"" given the uncertainty around reconstructing prices and behavior across multiple, 
independent natural gas and electricity markets over the course of several years to calculate damages. Breiding, 344 F. Supp. 
3d at 455-56. "
727,7," In light of this ruling, the Court does not reach Defendants' additional arguments for dismissal, see D. 22 at 21 n.9. "
729,1," Under the prison mailbox rule, the Court deems the Complaint filed on the date Plaintiff signed the Complaint on September 25,

petition context); see also Douglas v. Noelle, 567 F.3d 1103, 1107-1109 (9th Cir. 2009) (applying mailbox rule to § 1983

731,2," The Court grants Tarsadia Defendants' request for judicial notice of the complaint filed in the District of Colorado as unopposed 
and subject to judicial notice. See Fed. R. Evid. 201; Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (9th Cir.

733,15, U.S.C. § 1703(a)(2)(A)-(C).
733,4," In his opposition, Plaintiff claims that he does not know the specific date when he signed the contract, either May 18, 2006 or 
December 12, 2006; therefore, his FAC cannot be dismissed as untimely, (Dkt. No. 31 at 10); however, the FAC alleges he 
signed the contract on May 18, 2006, (Dkt. No. 24, FAC ¶ 100), and incorporates by reference the Purchase Contract he signed 
which is dated May 18, 2006. (See Dkt. No. 17-3, Tarsadia Ds' RJN, Ex. A at 35-49.) Therefore, the Court concludes the Plaintiff 
has alleged he signed the Purchase Contract on May 18, 2006. "
734,5, The Court notes Tarsadia Defendants do not move to dismiss the federal securities claim based on statute of limitations. 
735,6," Extraordinary circumstance is used to demonstrate the application of equitable tolling. For equitable tolling to apply, Plaintiff 
must demonstrate ""some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way"" and prevented timely filing. Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 
631, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 177 L. Ed. 2d 130 (2010). In the habeas context, ignorance of the law or limited legal knowledge do not 
constitute extraordinary circumstances. Rasberry v. Garcia, 448 F.3d 1150, 1154 (9th Cir. 2006) (an inmates ""ignorance of the 
law"" and ""lack of legal sophistication"" is not an extraordinary circumstance warranting equitable tolling). However, here, the 
Court is considering application of the discovery rule under California law, not equitable tolling."
735,7," The Court notes that the FAC alleges that ""Plaintiff reluctantly closed escrow in the late summer or fall of 2007."" (Dkt. No. 24, 
FAC ¶ 27.) It is not clear why Plaintiff was reluctant to close escrow and whether his reluctance constitutes suspicion of some 
wrongdoing."
735,8," The Court questions Plaintiff's claim that he did not discover the securities claims until June 2017 when he received Class 
Notice of the Beaver action. The Beaver action did not involve securities fraud claims. "
739,9," Tarsadia Defendants do not argue that the state securities fraud claim should be dismissed under Rule 9(b). (Dkt. No. 27-1 at

739,10," Additionally, Tarsadia Defendants argue that the federal and state securities claims are barred by the Ninth Circuit ruling in 
Salameh that the transactions at issue did not constitute a ""security."" 726 F.3d at 1132. While Tarsadia Defendants claim that 
the securities law claims in the Salameh and Brooks case are ""identical"" they have not claimed or demonstrated that the factual 
assertions to support the claims are identical. Accordingly, the Court declines to rely on the Salameh ruling on Tarsadia 
Defendants' motion to dismiss. "

749,5," For example, Dr. Baye calculated that the cage-size restrictions in place from August 2005 through January 2007 increased the

20.92%. Dr. Baye Expert Report P 199 (Ex. 20 to Dr. Baye Report). "
751,6," For the purposes of this motion only, the defendants do not quarrel with the DAPs' contention that nationwide production of 
eggs was lower from August 2005 to December 2012, relative to Dr. Baye's benchmark period. Defendants' Mot. for Summ. J. at 
14 n.4 (Doc. No. 1812)."
751,7," This argument is best demonstrated with a hypothetical involving 100 eggs laid. Prior to the conspiracy, 50 of these eggs were 
used for shell eggs and 50 were used for egg products. After the conspiracy, the number of eggs laid (hypothetically) decreased 
to 80. The fact that there are only 80 eggs available after the conspiracy does not necessarily mean that 40 were allotted for 
shell eggs and 40 for egg products. It could be that 30 became shell eggs and 50 were used in egg products, meaning that egg 
products might not have been affected by the alleged conspiracy at all. "
752,8," The defendants argue that, in addition to being irrelevant, many of the exhibits that the DAPs attached to their response are 
inadmissible hearsay. For example, the DAPs cite to twelve UEP United Voices newsletters. See DAP Exs. 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 14, 
20, 31, 42, 43, 44, & 51. During the DPPs' trial, the Court ruled that these documents contained inadmissible hearsay as to the 
producer Defendants and could only be admitted for the limited purpose of notice of the statements contained in them and not 
the truth of the statements themselves. See In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 08-MD-2002, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
59633, 2018 WL 1725802, *2-3 (E.D. Pa. Apr. 9, 2018). "
753,9," The defendants did not challenge Dr. Baye's expert report under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 
113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993); however, this does not preclude the defendants from arguing that his opinions do not 
establish a genuine issue of material fact. In Daubert, the Supreme Court of the United States explicitly concluded that 
""conventional devices"" such as directed verdict and summary judgment ""are the appropriate safeguards where the basis of 
scientific testimony meets the standards of Rule 702."" 509 U.S. at 596. ""Even a theory that might meet certain Daubert factors, 
such as peer review and publication, testing, known or potential error rate, and general acceptance, should not be admitted if it 
does not apply to the specific facts of the case."" Concord Boat Corp. v. Brunswick Corp., 207 F.3d 1039, 1056 (8th Cir. 2000)

753,10," Courts have found a multiple regression analysis to be useful in quantifying the relationship between a dependent variable and 
independent variables. In re Se. Milk Antitrust Litig., 739 F.3d 262, 285 (6th Cir. 2014) (citing Weisfeld v. Sun Chem. Corp., 84 
Fed. Appx. 257, 261 n.3 (3d Cir. 2004)). ""This type of model can also 'control for other independent variables so as to isolate 
and identify the effect of a single independent variable on the dependent variable.""' Id. (quoting Weisfeld, 84 Fed. Appx. at 261 
n.3). "
754,11, The Court again notes that it is not entirely clear how much or how often or under what circumstances this happens. 
755,12," The defendants also argue that summary judgment is warranted because the DAPs cannot establish a causal link between the 
alleged conspiracy and higher Urner Barry prices. Dr. Baye calculated damages based on the Urner Barry price sheets, which 
reflect market-wide transactions, but the defendants contend that he did not look at how the pricing decisions of at least 15 non-
defendants who sold processed egg products impacted Urner Barry. At most, the defendants argue that Dr. Baye's model shows 
a correlation between a decrease in the overall number of eggs and an increase in egg product prices. Because Dr. Baye 
concluded that non-certified producers would not have been able to counteract the effects of the alleged conspiracy, this creates 
a material dispute of fact. "
756,13," R.W. Sauder's motion (jointly filed with then-defendant Ohio Fresh) is filed at Doc. No. 1808. UEP and USEM filed a notice 
joining R.W. Sauder's motion. Doc. No. 1810. Rose Acre's motion is filed at Doc. No. 1811. And Cal-Maine's motion is docketed 
at Doc. No. 1813."
756,14," See e.g. In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litig., 881 F.3d at 274 (""Crucially, unlike the plaintiff in Mid-West Paper, who 
sued price-fixing suppliers from whom it made no purchases and with whom it had no direct relationship, here the Purchasers 
are pressing claims against price-fixing suppliers from whom they directly purchased products that incorporate a price-fixed 
component."") (emphasis in original); id. (""The direct relationship between the Purchasers and their Suppliers, and the fact that 
the Suppliers are alleged price-fixing conspirators and not merely competitors of those conspirators, are key distinctions from the 
scenario we confronted in Mid-West Paper.""); id. at 275 (""Here, the Purchasers are in a direct relationship with the antitrust 
violators and seek to recover for higher prices set by those violators, and paid by the Purchasers to those very parties."")."
756,15," In their individual motions, each defendant outlined which DAPs never purchased egg products directly from that defendant. 
Those relationships are summarized in the Background section of this Memorandum. See supra pp. 4-5. "
757,16," Under the defendants' interpretation, UEP and USEM could never be held liable for their participation in a conspiracy because 
those entities do not sell eggs or egg products. It is unreasonable to think that UEP and USEM could have participated in 
conspiratorial conduct but are protected from contributing to any damages by what would essentially be a loophole."
757,1," United Egg Producers, Inc. and United States Egg Marketers, Inc. joined this motion by notice filed at Doc. No. 1810. "
760,1," This case was originally assigned to the Honorable Arthur D. Spatt, United States District Judge. On October 3, 2018, Judge 
Spatt entered an order of recusal and the case was reassigned to the undersigned."
760,2," The factual allegations in the counterclaims are assumed to be true for purposes of this motion and do not constitute findings of 
fact by the Court. "
761,3," Since the counterclaims and proposed amended counterclaims specifically refer to United States Patent Nos. 9,227,945, dated 
January 5, 2016; 8,765,942, dated July 1, 2014; and 8,815,850, dated August 26, 2014, (Countercl., ¶ 14; PAC, ¶ 14), those 
exhibits are properly considered on this motion, as set forth below."
761,4," According to Akorn, ""ODE is available to new drug products for which the approved indication is a disease or condition affecting 
fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, or if greater than 200,000 people, then there is no reasonable expectation that 
costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States."" 
(Countercl., ¶ 19; PAC, ¶ 20)."
761,5," According to Akorn, the USP ""is a scientific nonprofit organization that sets standards for identity, strength, quality, and purity of 
medicines, food ingredients, and dietary supplements that are manufactured, distributed and consumed worldwide[,] . . . [which] 
are enforceable in the United States by the FDA . . . [and] are recognized and required under federal law."" (Countercl., ¶ 23; 
PAC, ¶ 24). ""When such medicines comply with the USP-NF [United States Pharmacopeia and National Formulary] standards, 
the products may be marketed and labelled as USP-compliant, generally by including 'USP' after the product name."" (Countercl., 
¶ 24; PAC, ¶ 25). According to Akorn, ""[t]hat was how [its] methylene products were labeled because they complied at all times 
with the then-current USP-NF until Provepharm instigated the November 2016 changes."" (PAC, ¶ 25). "
762,6," Since the counterclaims and proposed amended counterclaims specifically refer to the documents included in plaintiff's Exhibit 
17, (Countercl., ¶ 22; PAC, ¶ 23), those documents are properly considered on this motion, as set forth below."
762,7," Since the counterclaims and proposed amended counterclaims specifically refer to the ""USP Guideline for Submitting Requests 
for Revision to USP-NF, General Information for All Submissions"" (""Submissions Guideline""), and the USP Code of Ethics, 
(Countercl., ¶ 25; PAC, ¶ 26), those documents are properly considered on this motion, as set forth below."
762,8," In its proposed amended counterclaims, Akorn additionally alleges, inter alia, (i) that Provepharm's June 30, 2014 submission 
to USP, which ""is a 151-page document in which the following sentence appears: 'Methylene Blue drug substance is 
manufactured by Provepharm manufacturers using the patented method licensed by the Applicant[,]'"" (the ""Patented Method 
Statement""), (PAC, ¶ 30; see Grant Decl., Ex. 1 at 2992), did not disclose the existence of the Methylene Blue Patents to USP 
because (A) ""[t]he first of the Methylene Blue Patents did not issue until July 1, 2014,"" and, thus, did not exist at the time of the 
June 30, 2014 submission, and (B) ""there was no license between Provepharm and any manufacturer of the methylene blue 
drug substance for the Methylene Blue Patents[,]"" and, thus, the Patented Method Statement was false[,]"" (PAC, ¶ 31); (ii) that 
the USP ""did not, in fact, appreciate"" the Patented Method Statement as a disclosure of the Methylene Blue Patents because (A) 
the Patented Method Statement ""did not identify any specific patents or patent applications[,] . . . did not have enough 
information for USP to understand the situation with respect to the Methylene Blue Patents[,] . . . [and] was insufficient for USP 
to understand that the Methylene Blue Patents existed or their relevance to the proposed monograph revision[,]"" and (B) ""USP 
did not even notice the Patented Method Statement[,]"" (id., ¶ 32); (iii) that ""[i]f USP had noticed the Patented Method Statement, 
and if the Patented Method Statement contained sufficient information for USP to understand the existence of the Methylene 
Blue Patents and their relevant [sic] to the proposed monograph revision, USP would have taken action to prevent the 
Methylene Blue Patents from affecting anyone's ability to use or meet a proposed revised monograph,"" including (A) requiring 
Provepharm to either abandon the Methylene Blue Patents or license them royalty-free, or, (B) if Provepharm refused, modifying 
the proposed monograph ""so that the Methylene Blue Patents would not affect anyone's ability to use or meet a proposed 
revised monograph[,]"" (id., ¶ 33); and (iv) that ""[b]ut for Provepharm's failure to disclose the Methylene Blue Patents to USP, the 
ability of anyone, including Akorn, to use or meet the proposed revised monograph would not be affected by the Methylene Blue 
Patents."" (Id.). "
764,9," In its proposed amended counterclaims, Akorn also alleges with respect to its second counterclaim for attempted 
monopolization that Provepharm ""had a specific intent to monopolize the relevant market[,] . . . [and] purposefully acted to 
wrongfully block anyone else, including specifically Akorn, from selling methylene blue in the United States[,] . . . [because] 
although FDA granted seven years of exclusivity to Provepharm for the very limited use of treating acquired 
methemoglobinemia, Provepharm's actions with USP to revise the methylene blue monographs will prevent Akorn and others 
from filing NDAs for any other indications of use, including for example the numerous 'off label' uses for which Akorn's methylene 
blue products and Provepharm's ProvayBlue® product are purchased."" (PAC, ¶ 51). "
765,10," Indeed, with the exception of the allegations pertaining to the Patented Method Selection and Provepharm's purported specific 
intent, Akorn's proposed amended counterclaims are virtually identical to its original counterclaims. "
767,11," Since Provepharm does not challenge the sufficiency of the specific intent element in its motion to dismiss, it is not addressed 
herein. "
768,12," Provepharm's assertion that ""[t]he FDA's approval of ProvayBlue® led the USP to update and revise the monograph for 
methylene blue to mirror the FDA's approved standards for this injectable drug[,]"" (Plaintiff's Reply Memorandum of Law in 
Further Support of its Motion to Dismiss [""Plf. Reply""] at 2), appears to be contradicted by the documents incorporated by 
reference in the counterclaims that are attached as exhibit 17 to the declaration of Kathy Grant. Those documents indicate, in 
relevant part, (i) that Provepharm commenced the process of seeking revision of the methylene blue monograph on or before 
May 24, 2013, i.e., approximately three (3) years before it obtained FDA approval of its NDA, because the existing monograph 
was ""old,"" did not ""take into account the recent knowledge on the [different] hydrate forms of the Methylene Blue,"" and 
""describe[d] the Methylene Blue as trihydrate only[;]"" (ii) that since Provepharm's API ""contains mainly the pentahydrate form, 
which is the most stable form[,] . . . it doesn't strictly conform to the USP monograph;"" and (iii) that Provepharm's objective in 
seeking revision of the monograph was ""to have a product compliant with USP"" and, thus, it was ""look[ing] for the most efficient 
process to update the monograph in the meantime of the review of [its] NDA."" (Grant Decl., Ex. 17 at 628). "
769,13," The plaintiff in Broadcom alleged that the defendant monopolized a market by ""by falsely promising to license its patents 
according to the fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory ('FRAND') terms set by the European Telecommunications Standards 
Institute ('ETSI') and its standards-defining organizations ('SDO') counterparts in the United States, but then reneging on those 
promises after it succeeded in having its technology included in the standard."" 501 F.3d at 306."
769,14," In Amphastar, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants ""wrongfully acquir[ed] monopoly power by deceiving the USP into 
adopting a standard which they later claimed was covered by defendants' patents."" Id., 297 F. Supp. 3d at 227."
769,15," Rambus alternatively held that to the extent that Broadcom's ruling ""may have rested on a supposition that there is a 
cognizable violation of the Sherman Act when a lawful monopolist's deceit has the effect of raising prices (without an effect on "
770,," competitive structure), it conflicts with NYNEX [Corp. v. Discon, Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998)]."" at 
466. However, that holding is not relevant to this case. "
771,16," The Court is not necessarily persuaded that this is a proper pleading standard, as opposed to an evidentiary standard. Apple 
relies on Rambus to hold that the pleader ""must allege that there was an alternative technology that the SSO was considering 
during the standard setting process and that the SSO would have adopted an alternative standard had it known of the patent 
holder's intellectual property rights."" Apple, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120416, 2011 WL 4948567, at *5. However, as set forth 
above, Rambus involved a failure of proof, not a failure of pleading. Moreover, Townshend did not set forth a pleading standard 
at all with respect to claims alleging anticompetitive conduct based upon alleged misconduct before an SSO; it merely 
distinguished two (2) cases based upon their facts. However, since Akorn's counterclaims allege sufficient facts suggesting the 
possibility that USP would not have revised the existing official monograph for methylene blue as requested by Provepharm had 
Provepharm disclosed its patent rights during the revision process, it is unnecessary to decide this issue."
771,17," The Submissions Guideline provides, in pertinent part, that ""because USP's standards are intended to be public standards 
available for the use and benefit of all parties, USP requests that sponsors disclose in their Requests for Revision whether any 
portion of the methods or procedures submitted is subject to patent or other sponsor-held intellectual property rights. In cases 
where patented methods, procedures or materials required for compendial tests and assays (such as RS or photomicrographs) 
are proposed, USP may seek assistance from the sponsor in in obtaining clearance or license for use by any persons seeking to 
use or apply a USP public standard incorporating such method, procedure or material, and may consider other approaches "
772,," including the solicitation of other Requests for Revision that use alternative methods or procedures. USP reserves the right to 
indicate in a resulting monograph or general chapter whether methods or procedures are subject to such intellectual property 
rights."" For purposes of this motion, all reasonable inferences must be construed in favor of the non-moving party, and it may 
reasonably be inferred from that entire provision that sponsors, such as Provepharm, are required to disclose their patents on 
""any portion of the methods or procedures submitted,"" including manufacturing processes, to the USP in their Requests for 
Revision."
772,18," In asserting that the counterclaims fails to state a plausible claim of antitrust injury, and is barred by the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine, Provepharm focuses upon its ""right to obtain NDA approval for ProvayBlue®, and with it Orphan Drug Exclusivity[,]"" 
(Plf. Mem. at 18), seemingly ignoring that the anticompetitive conduct alleged is Provepharm's purported deception in 
sponsoring the revised methylene blue standard before the USP without disclosing its patent applications directed to the revised 
standard, which, in combination with the FDA approval of its NDA, operated to reduce consumer choice, significantly heighten 
barriers to entry, and substantially foreclose competition in the methylene blue market in the United States. Provepharm's 
petitioning of the USP, a private standards-setting organization, for a revised methylene blue standard ""generally does not 
trigger Noerr-Pennington protection."" Amphastar Pharms. Inc. v. Momenta Pharms., Inc., 850 F.3d 52, 56 (1st Cir. 2017) (citing 
Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 500, 108 S. Ct. 1931, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1988)); see also 
Hospital Auth. of. Metro. Gov't of Nashville v. Momenta Pharm., Inc., No. 3:15-1100, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136004, 2016 WL 
5724306, at * 15-16 (M.D. Tenn. Sept. 29, 2016), report and recommendation adopted in relevant part and rejected on other 
grounds, 244 F. Supp. 3d 705, 715-16 (M.D. Tenn. Mar. 21, 2017) (finding that since the crux of the plaintiff's antitrust claim was 
the defendants' alleged misconduct before the USP, a private standards-setting organization, the Noerr-Pennington doctrine was 
inapplicable). Provepharm also apparently ignores the fact that the FDA's award of ODE to ProvayBlue® is for the treatment of pediatric and 
adult patients with acquired methemoglobinemia only; it allegedly does not prevent Akorn and others from submitting their own 
NDA for approval to market products having methylene blue API for any other indication or use, or from manufacturing and 
selling any such product under an approved NDA. Assuming the truth of the allegations in the counterclaims, it is Provepharm's 
alleged anticompetitive conduct, not the limited ODE protection, which restricts Akorn and other drug manufacturers from 
manufacturing and selling products with methylene blue API in the United States under their own NDA for any other use than 
that covered by the ODE, because the manufacturing process purportedly necessary to produce methylene blue in the form 
adopted by the USP in the revised monograph is allegedly covered by Provepharm's patents. Moreover, since the counterclaims 
plausibly allege that Akorn and other drug manufacturers would be subject to suits for patent infringement for their marketing of 
methylene blue, not merely the submission of their own NDAs for FDA approval, the safe harbor provision of the Patent Act, 35 
U.S.C. § 271(e)(1), is not applicable. "
773,19," Provepharm's contentions regarding the merits of Akorn's patent allegations are improper on a motion to dismiss at the 
pleadings stage. Since Rule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure only requires a pleading to contain ""a short and plain 
statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,"" Akorn's counterclaims need not provide further ""analysis,"" 
""explanation"" or ""more of a factual basis;"" nor conclusive or ""self-evident"" proof of any fact. (Plf. Mem. at 23). While Provepharm 
contends that its patents protect only ""one method for purifying methylene blue, [and that] it is not self-evident that this is the only 
method[,]"" (Plf. Mem. at 23) (emphasis omitted), ""there remain fact-intensive questions about the feasibility, availability and even 
existence of [any] alternative[] [methods]."" Amphastar, 297 F. Supp. 3d at 229. ""The existence of alternatives is a factual 
question inappropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss."" Id.; see, e.g. In re Actos End-Payor Antitrust Litig., 848 F.3d 89, 
101 (2d Cir. 2017) (rejecting the defendant's argument that the plaintiff's causation theory was implausible because it failed ""to 
rule out a litany of alternative possible causes of [the plaintiff's] delayed market entry,"" because ""[w]hile it [was] possible that one 
or more of th[o]se factors may turn out to be barriers to plaintiff's causation theory at later stages of the litigation, they do not 
mandate dismissing the complaint [at the pleadings stage]. . . . Dismissal at this early stage on the basis of speculation about 
possible and not inherently more plausible alternative causes would be premature."") "
774,20," Even assuming, arguendo, that Akorn must establish ""good cause"" pursuant to Rule 16(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure to amend its counterclaims after the deadline set forth in the parties' joint letter to the Court setting forth their 
negotiated discovery schedule, (DE 32), Akorn satisfied that standard by, inter alia, asserting its counterclaims by the deadline 
set forth in the parties' negotiated discovery schedule based upon the evidence before it at that time and then diligently seeking 
relevant discovery and moving to amend its counterclaims within a reasonable time after receiving the discovery sought. See 
generally Holmes v. Grubman, 568 F.3d 329, 335 (2d Cir. 2009) (""Whether good cause exists [under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)] turns 
on the diligence of the moving party."" (quotations and citation omitted)). Moreover, as set forth above, Provepharm will not suffer 
any significant prejudice as a result of the proposed amendment. [*47]  See generally Kassner v. 2nd Ave. Delicatessen Inc., 
496 F.3d 229, 244 (2d Cir. 2007) (holding that although ""the primary consideration"" for purposes of Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b) ""is 
whether the moving party can demonstrate diligence[,]"" the district court may also ""consider other relevant factors including . . . 
whether allowing the amendment of the pleading . . . will prejudice defendants."") "
784,1," Citations to ""IPP ¶"" and ""DPP ¶"" are respectively to the indirect purchaser plaintiffs' and the direct purchaser plaintiffs' 
complaints. (Dkt. Nos. 241, 244.) The IPPs are U.S. consumers; the DPPs are U.S. auto dealers. "
785,2," Defendants filed a copy of that press release (see Dkt. No. 377-3) and the Court takes judicial notice of its contents as 
information that is from a source ""whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2). The Court will not 
consider Defendants' supplemental briefing on the press release (see Dkt. No. 377), as Defendants did not seek the Court's 
leave before filing the brief, as required. See Civil L.R. 7-3(d). "
787,3," The Court may consider evidence presented outside the pleadings in assessing personal jurisdiction. See Dole Food Co. v. 
Watts, 303 F.3d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir. 2002). "
788,4," In Williams v. Yamaha Motor Co., 851 F.3d 1015 (9th Cir. 2017), a case on which the German Defendants rely, there were no 
allegations that the Japanese defendant, Yamaha Motor Co. Ltd., had designed the defective boat motors at issue for sale in the 
forum state of California. The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that personal jurisdiction was lacking over the foreign defendant there, 
even though its U.S. subsidiary sold the motors in California, id. at 1022-25, is thus not controlling. "
792,5," As the Court reads the complaints, Plaintiffs do not offer the soft-top convertible and AdBlue tank allegations in support of 
separate, component-level Sherman Act claims. They instead offer those allegations to support the broader ""whole car 
conspiracy"" to reduce innovation that is claimed. The Court, then, will not separately consider whether the soft-top convertible 
and AdBlue tank agreements would plausibly violate the Sherman Act on their own. "
795,1," Plaintiff OmniMax International, Inc., formerly known as Euramax International, Inc., has an operating and manufacturing 
division called ""Amerimax,"" which is at issue in this dispute. For ease of reference in the present Order, the Court will refer to 
Amerimax in place of either OmniMax or Euramax. "
797,2," See, e.g., Frank H. Easterbrook, Text, History, and Structure in Statutory Interpretation, 17 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol'y 61, 68 
(1994) (""Intent is elusive for a natural person, fictive for a collective body.""). "
804,1," Diva requests judicial notice of these public records. The Court can properly take judicial notice of these documents because 
they are public records provided by government agencies and their authenticity is not disputed. See Fed. R. Evid. 201 (allowing 
a court to take judicial notice of a fact ""not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is . . . capable of accurate and ready 
determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned""); Daniels-Hall v. Nat'l Educ. Ass'n, 629 
F.3d 992, 998-99 (9th Cir. 2010) (""It is appropriate to take judicial notice of this information, as it was made publicly available by 
government entities . . . , and neither party disputes the authenticity of the web sites or the accuracy of the information displayed 
therein.""). The Court, however, cannot take judicial notice of the facts in the Zoughi declaration. "
805,2," The UPA defines ""[l]oss leader"" as ""any article or product sold at less than cost . . . [w]here the effect is to divert trade from or 
otherwise injure competitors."" Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17030(c)."
805,3," The parties are in accord that Uber is a ""public utility corporation"" within the meaning of § 17024(1). ""'Public utility' includes 
every common carrier . . . where the service is performed for, or the commodity is delivered to, the public or any portion thereof."" 
Cal. Pub. Util. Code § 216(a). A ""common carrier,"" in turn, ""means every person and corporation providing transportation for 
compensation to or for the public or any portion thereof."" Id. § 211. ""Whenever any common carrier . . . performs a service for, or 
delivers a commodity to, the public or any portion thereof for which any compensation or payment whatsoever is received, that 
common carrier . . . is a public utility subject to the jurisdiction, control, and regulation of the commission and the provisions of 
[the California Public Utilities Act]."" Id. § 216(b). "
806,4," To be sure, the statute is not without ambiguity. Section 17024 does not, for instance, refer to rates ""subject to regulation by"" 
CPUC—language which would have made the broader reach of the exemption clear. "
807,5," Uber has also cited examples of the CPUC considering risks of anticompetitive behavior in regulating rates for other common 
carriers. For instance, in 1990 the CPUC adopted a flexible rate program for the trucking industry whereby ""common carriers 
[were] allowed rate freedom within a zone of reasonableness."" Regulation of Gen. Freight Transp. by Truck, 35 C.P.U.C. 2d 307, 
307 (Feb. 7, 1990). In those proceedings, the CPUC made clear that ""[t]he principal reason for regulation of utility rates in 
general is to prevent monopoly pricing due to restriction of supply."" Id. at 334. The decision to implement a flexible rate-setting 
mechanism was ""based upon a finding that workable competition exists"" within the industry, and the CPUC pledged to 
""continuously monitor the degree of competition and quality of service"" under the new scheme. Id. at 334, 353. "

821,3," For example, by the end of 2017, Wabtec and its subsidiaries employed approximately 18,000 full-time employees worldwide. 
(ECF No. 88 ¶ 30.) In 2016, Wabtec added approximately 5,700 employees through the acquisition of Faiveley. (Id.) By the end 
of 2017, Knorr and its subsidiaries employed approximately 27,700 employees worldwide, including approximately 5,000 
employees in the Americas. (Id.) "
822,4," The descriptions of the agreements and their import are taken from the consolidated class action complaint. The court 
expresses no opinion about the merits of those allegations. "
823,5," Plaintiffs allege: Knowledge of the agreements was closely held by senior executives [**26]  and recruiters of the Defendant companies who 
relied on direct and non-public communications with one another to manage and enforce the no-poach agreements, 
including in-person discussions and private email communications. ... Defendants devised internal procedures by which implicated applicants could be discreetly flagged. Once flagged, the 
company President decided whether to seek permission from the rival company to hire the individual. The applicant was not 
told, much less consulted, about this process. ... Knorr's policies stated that it was committed to fair competition. ... Wabtec's policies provided that it was committed to respecting its employees and the fair and equitable treatment of 
employees. (ECF No. 88 ¶¶ 60-63.) "
828,6," Plaintiffs in the notice of supplemental authority cite Conrad v. Jimmy John's Franchise, LLC, Case No. 3:18-cv-00133-NJR-
RJD, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94411 (S.D. Ill. May 21, 2019) (ECF No. 189-1), [**40]  and Blanton v. Domino's Pizza Franchising 
LLC, Case No. 2:18-cv-13207-VARDRG, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87737 (E.D. Mich. May 24, 2019) (ECF No. 198-2). Plaintiffs 
attached the Conrad and Blanton decisions to their notice of supplemental authority. The court will, therefore, use this case's 
ECF docket citation when discussing each of those decisions. In Conrad, the plaintiff sued the defendants under the Sherman Act for their alleged ""practice of including no-poach clauses in its 
franchise contracts."" (ECF No. 189-1 at 2.) The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied with respect to the 
plaintiff's Sherman Act claim. (Id. at 3.) The judge presiding over the case at the time held that plaintiff stated a plausible 
Sherman Act claim and the court could not decide at the pleading stage of the litigation which analysis would apply to the case, 
i.e., the rule of reason, the per se approach, or the quick look analysis. (Id. at 3-4.) The judge then retired and the case was 
reassigned. The defendants filed another motion to dismiss that was ""extremely similar to the one that the prior judge already 
adjudicated."" (Id. at 2.) The newly assigned judge applied the law of the case doctrine and denied the defendant's motion to 
dismiss the complaint. (Id. at 6.) In Blanton, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants ""violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by orchestrating an employee no-hire 
agreement among their nationwide network of franchisees."" (ECF No. 189-2 at 2.) The defendant filed a motion to dismiss and 
argued that the plaintiff failed to state a § 1 claim under the rule of reason. The court disagreed; it held that plaintiff stated a 
plausible § 1 claim and that the plaintiff's failure to apply the rule of reason was not fatal to his claim. The court explained that 
""[m]ore factual development...[was] necessary[,]"" and at that stage the plaintiff set forth factual allegations sufficient to show 
plausibly he was entitled to relief under § 1. (Id. at 10.) Defendants argue that the court should disregard plaintiffs' notice of supplemental authority because the courts in the foregoing 
decisions did not hold that horizontal no-poach agreements are always subject to the per se rule. (ECF No. 190 at 1.) The court 
finds Conrad and Blanton persuasive to the extent the courts in those decisions held that the plaintiffs set forth factual 
allegations sufficient from which the court could plausibly infer that the per se rule would apply, and, therefore, the plaintiffs were 
not required to plead a rule of reason analysis in their complaints. The court agrees with defendants that the courts in those 
decisions did not hold that all horizontal no-poach agreements will be per se violative of the antitrust laws. "
830,7," Defendant cites the following decisions from courts outside the Third Circuit in support of its argument that the rule of reason 
should be applied to the alleged horizontal restraints in this case. Those decisions, however, are easily distinguishable from this 
case. See Deslandes v. McDonald's USA, LLC, Civ. Action No. 17-4857, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 105260, 2018 WL 3105955, at 
*7 (N.D. Ill. June 25, 2018) (holding ""the restraint alleged in plaintiff's complaint cannot be deemed unlawful per se...[b]ecause 
the restraint alleged in plaintiff's complaint is ancillary to an agreement with a procompetitive effect""); In re High-Tech Employee 
Antitrust Litig., 856 F.Supp.2d 1103 n.9 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (acknowledging that the ""horizontal agreements between competitors in 
restraint of trade"" were ""either per se unlawful...or...prima facie anticompetitive under the rule of reason analysis"" but not 
deciding the issue because the plaintiffs plead their claim under the rule of reason); Bogan v. Hodgkins, 166 F.3d 509, 515 (2d 
Cir. 1999) (holding the agreement in issue did not trigger per se treatment because ""while the Agreement may constrain General 
Agents to some degree, it does not allocate the market for agents to any meaningful extent""); Phillips v. Vandygriff, 711 F.2d 
1217 (5th Cir. 1983) (holding the agreement in issue was not subject to per se analysis because it was ""at least potentially 
reasonably ancillary"" to a proper business purpose); UARCO Inc. v. Lam, 18 F.Supp.2d 1116 (D. Haw. 1998) (analyzing an 
""unclean hands"" defense in deciding a motion for preliminary injunction and holding that companies' agreements to not hire each 
other's employees must be analyzed under the rule of reason without recognizing that no-hire agreements are horizontal market 
allocation agreements which receive per se treatment under the antitrust laws); Coleman v. Gen. Elec. Co., 643 F. Supp. 1229 
(E.D. Tenn. 1986) (holding the per se analysis did not apply to the agreement in issue because ""there was no stifling of 
competition for the services of these employees"" and the impact of the agreement on the employment market was nothing more 
than ""incidental""). "
838,8," In the alternative to plaintiffs' argument that the allegations against Bendix are sufficient, they request leave to amend the 
consolidated class action complaint to set forth additional factual allegations against Bendix. (ECF No. 152 at 26 n.9.) To the 
extent plaintiffs want to amend their consolidated class action complaint, they should do so in accordance with Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 15."
838,9," For example, in Luppe v. Cheswick Generating Station, Civ. Action No. 12-929, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9791, 2015 WL 401443, 
at *2 (W.D. Pa. Jan. 28, 2015), the court explained that Rule 12(f) and Rule 23(c)(1)(A) ""together, provide authority for the Court 
to strike the class allegations from Plaintiffs' Complaint, if appropriate, even before Plaintiffs move for class certification."" "
839,10," One court in this district defined the relevant terms of Rule 12(f) as follows: ""Redundant""—The statement of facts which are wholly foreign to the issue intended to be denied or the needless repetition 
of material averments. ""Immaterial""—having no essential or important relationship to the averment intended to be denied. A statement of 
unnecessary particulars in connection with, and as descriptive of, what is material. ""Impertinent""—A statement [**76]  of matters applied to facts which do not belong to the matter in question, and which is 
not necessary to the matter in question. ""Scandalous""—Unnecessary matter or facts criminatory of a party referred to in the pleading. Burke v. Mesta Mach. Co., 5 F.R.D. 134, 138 (W.D.Pa.1946) (cited by DirecTV, Inc. v. Weikel, No. CIV. 03-5300 (JBS), 2005 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9902, 2005 WL 1243378, at *2 (D.N.J. May 25, 2005)). "
841,11," One treatise has recognized that ""[t]he typicality inquiry assumes an added dimension of complexity when multiple parties are 
named as defendants."" 1 WILLIAM B. RUBENSTEIN, ALBA CONTE, HERBERT NEWBERG, NEWBERG ON CLASS ACTIONS § 3:48 (5th ed. 
2012). ""The question is whether a plaintiff who has been affected by the conduct of one of the defendants may name all those 
who engaged in the challenged conduct as the defendants—and thereby represent a class of all those affected by any single 
defendant—even though the named plaintiff has had no contact with some of those defendants."" Id. The Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals has explained that ""where no nominal plaintiff has standing on any issue against one of multiple defendants, a suit for 
damages may not be maintained as a class action against that defendant."" Haas v. Pittsburgh Nat'l Bank, 526 F.2d 1083 (3d Cir. 
1975). The court of appeals acknowledged two exceptions to that general rule: (1) situations in which the injuries are the result of ""a conspiracy or concerted schemes between the defendants at whose 
hands the class suffered injury,"" or (2) instances in which all defendants are juridically related and a single disposition of the 
entire dispute would be expeditious. Id. at 1095 n.15 (quoting La Mar v. H & B Novelty & Loan Co., 489 F.2d 461 (9th Cir. 1973)). Here, plaintiffs, who are employees of Knorr, Wabtec, and certain of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, seek to 
represent a class of employees of Knorr, Wabtec, and certain of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries. Plaintiffs set forth 
factual allegations to show plausibly that their injuries are the result of conspiracies entered into by Knorr, Wabtec, and Faiveley 
N.A. Thus, the first Haas exception to the general rule that a plaintiff cannot assert claims on behalf of a class against a 
defendant with whom the plaintiff has had no contact is applicable to this case. "
842,12," All defenses that might be raised appear to be applicable to many members of the class. Defendants do not argue that the 
interests or incentives of the representative plaintiffs are not sufficiently aligned with those of the class. Plaintiffs and proposed 
members of the class were all employees of defendants or their wholly-owned subsidiaries. restrain competition for all their 
employees, which resulted in the suppression of compensation for all members of the proposed class. The legal  [*501]  theory 
for plaintiffs and the proposed classes and the factual basis for those claims are generally the same. The factual differences 
about each plaintiff cited by defendant do not defeat a finding of typicality at this stage of the case. See Id. "
851,13," The court defined ""internal equity structures"" as ""policies and practices that are alleged to have ensured relatively constant 
compensation relationships between employees."" Seaman, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16136, 2018 WL 671239, at *4. "
852,14," The court found that the plaintiff's theory that that ""the no-hire agreement affected a subset of non-faculty more directly 
because they missed out on compensation increases associated with lateral moves undertaken in connection with a faculty-lead 
team"" was not supported by any evidence. Seaman, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16136, 2018 WL 671239, at *7 n.8. The court 
explained that the evidence did not ""provide any indication or confirmation that faculty seek compensation increases for non-
faculty during lateral moves."" Id. The court also found that the plaintiff did not set forth a theory or evidence to calculate damages 
based upon that theory. Id. "
853,15," Satisfying the predominance requirement in a no-poach case, i.e., proving antitrust impact is capable of proof on a class-wide 
basis, may be an easier task when the putative class is comprised of a narrow, well-defined subset of employees. Here, 
plaintiffs' task is more difficult because they seek to represent an expansive class of all defendants' employees, which includes 
employees highly skilled in the railway equipment supply industry and employees without skills specific to that industry. "
854,16," The predominance issue may also impact the breadth of the class, i.e., all employees or only certain kinds of employees. See 
Seaman, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16136, 2018 WL 671239, at *8 (granting class certification for a faculty class but denying class 
certification for a class including faculty and non-faculty). "
863,1," Rabbe testified that he discussed his interest in both the Trimont and Sherburn elevators with Mulder while Mulder only 
remembered discussing the Trimont elevator."
863,2, This was memorialized in a text message between Rabbe and Kahler. 
864,3," ""Person"" is broadly denned as ""any individual, corporation, firm, partnership, incorporated and unincorporated association, or 
any other legal or commercial entity."" Minn. Stat. § 325D.50, subd. 5."
864,4," Although Rabbe testified that Mulder directed him to Kahler if he wished to purchase the Trimont elevator, there is no indication 
in the record that Rabbe made any firm demand or offer to purchase any of the elevators. It appears that, at most, Rabbe 
expressed an interest in purchasing the elevators. However, such expressions are insufficient to constitute a demand or offer to 
deal. See Cleary, 505 F.2d at 696-97."
864,5," Plaintiffs cite to Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962) in 
support of the proposition that this rule is not to be rigidly applied. While it is true that the United State Supreme Court declined 
to enforce this rule in Continental Ore, its rationale for doing so appears to be based on the peculiar facts of that case in which "
865,," respondents had effectively monopolized the supply of vanadium oxide though conduct which appeared to violate both sections 
1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (the Court's analysis does not distinguish between the two). As no much similar conduct exists in 
this case, the Court believes that Continental Ore is of limited applicability."
865,6," It is unclear whether FSB and Kahler could have engaged in any type of prohibited collusive conduct given that Kahler's role 
appeared to be either as a de facto selling agent or a competitive purchaser. The former has been held to be immune from 
antitrust liability, see Howard v. Minnesota Timberwolves Basketball Ltd. Partnership, 636 N.W.2d 551, 557 (Minn. App. 2001) 
(agent or representative cannot incur antitrust liability) while the latter, in this context, invariably precludes other competitors from 
acquiring the sought-after product."
865,7," Defendants have noted, rightfully so, that the allegation of collusive action on the part of Kahler and FSB is facially absurd 
given that FSB did not require Kahler's assistance in preventing Rabbe from purchasing the elevators. "

899,8," The wholesale acquisition cost (""WAC"") of a prescription drug refers to the list price of the branded drug. Leitzinger Report 28 
n.83; see also DPP Hr'g Tr. 16. As discussed below, Dr. Leitzinger conceptualizes generic drug price in terms of its discount 
from the brand's WAC. See Leitzinger Rebuttal Report ¶ 15 (""While generic suppliers compete with one another, they are also 
engaged collectively in competing with and diverting sales from the brand. The key metric in this regard is the level of the 
generic price relative to brand prices, often summarized as the generic discount from brand WAC.""); see also Expert Report of 
Pierre-Yves Cremieux (""Cremieux Report"") ¶ 32 n.41, ECF No. 582-1 (""The WAC is the manufacturer's list price to wholesalers 
before considering discounts, rebates, and other price concessions.""). "
900,9," One of the six Brand-Only Purchasers, King Drug Company of Florence, Inc., went out of business in November 2010, and has 
submitted a declaration stating that, considering its business model, it would have purchased generic Loestrin 24 had it been 
available earlier. Leitzinger Rebuttal Report ¶¶ 28-29; Decl. of Keith Elmore (Nov. 23, 2018), ECF No. 621-25."
900,10," This phenomenon is referred to as ""generic bypass"". Following generic entry, some wholesalers' customers shift their buying 
practices to purchase the generic drug directly from generic manufacturers, thereby ""bypassing"" the wholesaler. Leitzinger 
Report ¶ 68. As a result, wholesalers may lose volume in their sales. Id. ¶¶ 68-70. HN5[
] The weight of the authority on this issue sides with the DPPs, and the Court adopts those courts' reasoning that, 
consistent with Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968), 
purchasers are injured at the point in time they incur the overcharge. Thus, even if generic bypass may have occurred in a but-
for world, this does not negate injury. See Illinois Brick v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 724, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977) 
(holding that direct purchasers may recover the full amount of overcharges (citing Hanover Shoe, 392 U.S. at 494)); see also In 
re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 296 F.R.D. 47, 55 (D. Mass. 2013) (""Nexium II"")(""The Supreme Court has 'long 
recognized [overcharges] as the principal measure of damages for plaintiffs injured as customers.'"") (quoting In re Relafen 
Antitrust Litig., 218 F.R.D. 337, 344 (D. Mass. 2003)). "
902,11," In the DPPs' Further Support for Class Certification Memorandum, they adjust the putative class from comprising 48 to 47 
members. DPPs' Further Supp. for Class Cert. 3 & n.7, ECF No. 621. "
903,12," As a general matter, a class of 20 or fewer tends to carry the presumption that it is not sufficiently numerous; a class of 41 or 
more carries a presumption that it is sufficiently numerous; and ""[c]lasses with between 21 and 40 members are given varying 
treatment,"" depending on the facts of the specific case. Modafinil, 837 F.3d at 250 (quoting 5 James Wm. Moore, et al., Moore's 
Federal Practice § 23.22))."
903,13, Four of these overlap with parties that Defendants allege have no direct injury. Defs.' Opp'n to Class Cert. 19.
903,14," Indeed, but for the no-authorized-generic agreement between Warner Chilcott and Watson, the DPPs' theory posits, Generic-
Only Purchasers would have made their generic purchases directly from Warner Chilcott. Only because Warner Chilcott had 
agreed not to market an authorized generic did generic purchasers need to look elsewhere. DPPs' Further Supp. for Class Cert. 
13, 15-16. "
904,15," This Court respectfully disagrees with the conclusion reached on this issue in Skelaxin, 2014 U.S. DCist. LEXIS 66707, 2014 
WL 2002887, at *11. There, the court held that the plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue antitrust damages for ""generic 
overcharges"". 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66707, [WL] at *1, 11. It reasoned that the causal connection between the defendant's "
905,," alleged antitrust violation and the plaintiff-generic purchaser's harm was too attenuated. See 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66707, [WL] 
at *11 (citing In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., No. 99CIV5134, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12114, 2001 WL 855463, at *4 (D.D.C. July 2, 
2001)). Moreover, the Court reasoned that, because it was satisfied that the defendants did not intend the plaintiff's harm, they 
had not satisfied the standing inquiry set forth by the Supreme Court in Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc., 459 U.S. at 537-
45. Skelaxin, 2014 U.S. DCist. LEXIS 66707, 2014 WL 2002887, at 8-9. The Court, consistent with its reading of Areeda & 
Hovenkamp, concludes that in a market exclusion case like the one at bar, as opposed to a price fixing case, intervening pricing 
decisions of the non-defendant manufacturer do not require the same level of searching inquiry into causation."
905,16," Defendants argue that the Brand-Only Purchasers should be excluded from the class because there is no proof that they 
would have purchased generic Loestrin had it been available. See Defs.' Opp'n to Class Cert. 17-18. For the reasons stated 
above, see supra Part II.B. (discussing this argument in connection with Defendants' Motion to Exclude Dr. Leitzinger's Expert 
Report), this argument fails. "
907,17," For what it's worth, as the kids say, Dr. Leitzinger has now performed, in response to Defendants' criticisms, the calculations 
necessary for jury findings that the product hop was lawful, that the product hop was unlawful, and that the product hop occurred 
six months before a non-delayed Watson generic entry. See Leitzinger Report ¶¶ 62-65; Leitzinger Rebuttal Report ¶¶ 35-41. "

the common-law principles of vicarious liability are not to be confused with the reasons for them, and that their application 
remains a matter of fact. If one looks at the principle of vicarious liability through the prism of s 39(2) of the Constitution, one 
realises that characterising the application of the common-law principles of vicarious liability as a matter of fact untrammelled by 
any considerations of law or normative principle cannot be correct. Such an approach appears to be seeking to sterilise the 
common law test for vicarious liability and purge it of any normative or social or economic considerations. Given the clear policy 
basis of the rule as well as the fact that it is a rule developed and applied by the courts themselves, such an approach cannot be 
sustained under our new constitutional order. This is not to say that there are no circumstances where rules may be applied 
without consideration of their normative content or social impact. Such circumstances may exist. What is clear, however, is that 
as a matter of law and social regulation, the principles of vicarious liability are principles which are imbued with social policy and

function with the unified purpose of building and selling homes under the same Beazer Homes Holding Corp. name. (See PSOF 
¶ 4.) Plaintiffs raise the same argument with respect to D.R. Horton; The Drees Company; Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc.; and KB 
Home. (Id. ¶¶ 4, 10, 12, 14.)"
971,10," The parties dispute whether any Beazer entities purchased drywall in California during the relevant time period. (Compare Pls. 
Supp. SOF ¶ 48 (stating that from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2015, Beazer Homes purchased drywall in California 
""through its subsidiaries and affiliates""), with Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 48 (stating that because no Beazer Homes Holdings Corp. 
entities were located in California, they did not make purchases in California during the relevant time period).) Defendants also 
argue that purchases by Beazer Homes are governed by Georgia law pursuant to Beazer Homes's purchase agreement. (Defs. 
Resp. SOF ¶ 48; id. Ex. 122.)"
971,11," It is undisputed that several of Standard Pacific Corp. and Ryland Group, Inc.'s California divisions purchased drywall. (See 
Defs. SOF Ex. 16.)"
971,12," Defendants contend that CalAtlantic did not purchase any drywall, but that Standard Pacific Corp. and Ryland Group, Inc., 
CalAtlantic's purchasing entities, did. (Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 45.) Plaintiffs admit that CalAtlantic's purchasing entities ""technically 
purchased the wallboard upon which Cal Atlantic Asserts its claims,"" but contend that Standard Pacific Corp. and Ryland Group, 
Inc. purchased drywall on behalf of CalAtlantic Group, Inc. (PSOF ¶ 6; Pls. Supp. SOF ¶ 45.) "
972,13," The parties dispute whether these purchases may be attributed to D.R. Horton or only to its purchasing entities. (See Pls. 
Supp. SOF ¶ 49; Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 49.)"
972,14," Defendants deny that Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., which has its principal place of business in New Jersey, purchased drywall. 
(Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 50.)"
972,15," The parties dispute whether KB Home or its purchasing entities purchased drywall in California. (See Pls. Supp. SOF ¶ 46; 
Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 46.)"
972,16," The parties dispute whether Meritage Homes Corporation purchased 49,764 msf of drywall in California. (Compare Pls. Supp. 
SOF ¶ 51 (""From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2015, . . . Meritage Homes Corporation purchased 49,764 msf of 
drywall in the State of California.""), with Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 51 (""Meritage Homes . . . has its principal place of business of 
Arizona. Meritage has no separately organized entities which purchased [drywall]. As a result, Meritage had no purchases in 
California during the relevant time period."").) Defendants also argue that Meritage's claims are governed Arizona law pursuant to 
the purchase agreement. (Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 51; id. Ex. 123.)"
972,17," The parties dispute whether Pulte Home Corporation purchased drywall in California. (Compare Pls. Supp. SOF ¶ 52 (""From 
January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2015, Plaintiff Pulte Home Corporation purchased 51,881 msf of drywall in the State of 
California.""), with Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 52 (""Pulte Home Corporation has its principal place of business in Georgia. Pulte has no 
separately-organized entities which purchased [drywall]. As a result, Pule had no purchases in California during the relevant time 
period."").) "
973,18," Defendants contend that purchases by Toll Brothers, Inc. were governed by Pennsylvania law pursuant to the purchase 
agreement. (Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 53; id. Ex. 124.)"
973,19," Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts ""admit[s] that the [] seven entities (majority of which were acquired by TRI Pointe in 2014) 
technically purchased the drywall upon which TRI Pointe asserts its claims."" (PSOF ¶ 24.) However, in Plaintiffs' Separate 
Statement of Facts, Plaintiffs attribute these drywall purchases to TRI Pointe, which Defendants dispute. (Compare Pls. Supp. 
SOF ¶ 47 (averring that TRI Pointe Homes, Inc. purchased drywall), with Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 47 (""Defendants deny that TRI 
Pointe Homes, Inc. purchased any drywall during the relevant time period. Instead, seven separately-organized entities 
purchased wallboard."").) "
974,20," In addition to the facts summarized above, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants facilitated and maintained the conspiracy by 
participating in trade association meetings and a retirement dinner in California during the relevant time period. (See Pls. Supp. 
SOF ¶¶ 41-44.) As Defendants recognize, when these meetings were identified by the Class Plaintiffs in support of their motion 
for summary judgment, the Court stated that it ""w[ould] not give weight to any evidence that shows a bare opportunity to 
conspire, without more."" (Defs. Resp. SOF ¶¶ 41-44 (quoting February 2016 MSJ Opinion at 37).) The Court maintains the same 
position in the instant Motion and does not consider the trade association meetings or dinner in its analysis. "
975,21," Defendants contend that this email does not reflect illegal activity, but rather is evidence of legal, conscious parallelism. (Defs. 
Resp. SOF ¶ 34 (citing Valspar Corp. v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours & Co., 873 F.3d 185, 200 (3d Cir. 2017)).) "
976,22," Defendants state that this email exchange ""at most reflects the legal process of setting pricing in anticipation of competitor 
actions in an oligopolistic industry."" (Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 33.)"
976,23," (See also Pls. Supp. SOF Ex. V (August 15, 2011 email from Mr. Burkhammer to Mr. Brand and others (""I wanted to confirm 
that Pabco is going to support the upcoming increase and the number being tossed around is ten dollars."")); Pls. Supp. SOF Ex. 
W (October 25, 2012 email thread between Mr. Burkhammer and Mr. Brand (discussing PABCO's increase letter and confirming 
that PABCO would not be issuing job quotes in 2013)).)"
976,24," According to Defendants, earlier emails in this chain reflect that PABCO's ""policy"" is to not take on ""new business until the 
needs of current customers [are] met"" because this ""endear[s] PABCO to current customers and [gives] competitor's customers 
the desire to join the PABCO team ASAP."" (Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 38) (citation omitted).) "
977,25," Defendants argue that Exhibits PP and QQ ""at most, reflect that drywall manufacturers instituted the same policy of controlled 
distribution that they had done in advance of many prior price increases, in order to ensure that all customers received the 
wallboard they needed."" (Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 40.)"
977,26," Defendants argue that this report only ""reveals that American Gypsum and Temple Inland were increasing delivery of 
wallboard and attempting to recapture market share during the alleged conspiratorial period."" (Defs. Resp. SOF ¶ 37.) "
978,27," At oral argument, Defendants specifically argued that the laws of the states where the purchasing entities are headquartered 
govern for choice-of-law purposes. (Oral Arg. Tr. at 35:6-8.) "
982,28," This opinion is available on the MDL docket and at In re Domestic Drywall Antitrust Litig., No. 13-MD-2437, 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 135758, 2017 WL 3700999 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 24, 2017) (Baylson, J.). "
983,29," Defendants also argue the AT&T Mobility is of ""minimal value"" because it preceded the Supreme Court's decision in Bristol-
Myers Squibb Co., which ""re-emphasized"" the ""theme"" that a state that permits indirect purchasers to recover for purchases 
made within the state cannot dictate recovery for purchases made in other states. (MSJ at 19-20.) The Court is not persuaded 
by Defendants' attempt to draw connections between Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and the instant case. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 
which involved a state's exercise of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, is factually inapposite to this case, which 
involves the application of a state's substantive law to out-of-state plaintiffs. Further, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. does not affect the 
Court's choice-of-law analysis because, as the Supreme Court recognized in Shutts, ""[t]he issue of personal jurisdiction over 
plaintiffs in a class action is entirely different from the question of the constitutional limitations on choice of law."" Shutts, 472 U.S. 
at 821. "
985,30," Defendants contend that the availability of the pass-through defense is a material difference between California and other 
repealer states even though they dispute that California prohibits this defense. (Id.) "
1007,1," Plaintiffs also brought antitrust claims, but those claims have been dismissed. See In re McCormick, 217 F. Supp. 3d 124, 131 
(D.D.C. 2016). "
1008,2," In 1993, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") concluded that the ""filled as to be misleading"" portion of § 343(d) had 
not been ""adequately implemented."" See Misleading Containers; Nonfunctional Slack-Fill, 58 Fed. Reg. 2957-01, 2960 (Jan. 6, 
1993). It thus proposed, see 58 Fed. Reg. at 2960, and ultimately adopted a regulation, see 21 C.F.R. § 100.100(a), to define 
when ""slack-fill"" is ""nonfunctional"" and when ""nonfunctional slack-fill"" is ""misleading."" See 58 Fed. Reg. 64123. The FDA noted 
that it had ""decided not to elaborate on ways in which a container may be ""made"" or ""formed"" as to be misleading,"" finding those 
terms to be ""straightforward"" and to ""require little elaboration."" 58 Fed. Reg. at 2960."
1008,3," California has adopted verbatim the federal definition of nonfunctional slack-fill, and it similarly provides that ""[a] container that 
does not allow the consumer to fully view its contents shall be considered to be filled as to be misleading if it contains 
nonfunctional slack-fill."" See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 12606.2(c). New Jersey law provides that ""nonfunctionally slack-filled"" 
means ""a container which is filled to substantially less than its capacity for reasons other than (a) protection of the contents of 
the container or (b) the requirements of machines used for enclosing the contents in the container"" and that ""[n]o container shall 
be so nonfunctionally slack-filled as to constitute deception."" N.J. Stat. Ann. § 51:1-29(c)(2). Colorado has adopted the same 
definition and its Department of Public Health and Environment is charged with enacting regulations, as necessary, to prevent 
""deception of consumers"" by ""preventing the nonfunctional slack-fill of packages containing consumer commodities."" Colo. Rev. 
Stat. Ann. § 25-5-419(4)."

1016,38," In the alternative, defendants argued that the Court should dismiss claims under the laws of states where no named plaintiffs 
resided because they had no standing to pursue those claims. In re McCormick, 217 F. Supp. 3d at 142. The Court rejected this 
argument, concluding that ""Mt is more logical to consider named plaintiffs' ability to raise other state-law claims as a question of 
commonality, typicality, and adequacy under Rule 23, rather than a question of standing."" Id. at 144. "
1017,39," The named plaintiffs who voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice were Anne Marron, Nicholas Hilla, Bernard Ortiz,

In addition, the case in which Marron was the sole plaintiff, No. 16-cv-00104 (D.D.C.), has been dismissed. "

1022,43," Then-Circuit Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained: Applying divergent interpretations of the governing federal law to plaintiffs, depending solely upon where they initially filed 
suit, would surely reduce the efficiencies achievable through consolidated preparatory proceedings. Indeed, because there 
is ultimately a single proper interpretation of federal law, the attempt to ascertain and apply diverse circuit interpretations 
simultaneously is inherently self-contradictory. Our system contemplates differences between different states' laws; thus a 
multidistrict judge asked to apply divergent state positions on a point of law would face a coherent, if sometimes difficult, "
1023,," task. But it is logically inconsistent to require one judge to apply simultaneously different and conflicting interpretations of 
what is supposed to be [**43]  a unitary federal law. In re Korean Air Lines Disaster, 829 F.2d at 1175-76. "
1024,44," The Court does not agree, as defendants appear to suggest, that because so many courts have denied certification of multi-
state consumer protection and unjust enrichment classes, the burden is essentially insurmountable. (See McCormick's Opp. at 
26-27, 38-39 & Exs. 29-30 (Tables of Cases).)"

other states' laws, even if the states have materially identical legal standards. (See 7/10/18 Tr. at 44; Wal-Mart's Opp. at 2.) 
According to Wal-Mart, a class representative from one state cannot suffer the necessary injury to represent a plaintiff from 
another state because each state defines ""what the injury is."" (7/10/18 Tr. at 45.) Given the Court's conclusion that the multi-
state classes founder on the requirement of predominance, this argument is moot. "
1032,62," The D.C. Circuit has not yet spoken on this issue, see Hoyte v. District of Columbia, 325 F.R.D. 485, 490 (D.D.C. 2017), but

representatives: Fernandez (Connecticut), Jones (District of Columbia), Bittle and Theis (Illinois), Robinson (Maryland), Grindel 
(Missouri), and Gerstnecker (Pennsylvania). (See McCormick's Opp. at 20-21.) Plaintiffs are presumably no longer seeking 
appointment of Bittle and Theis given that they withdrew their request to have them selected as class representatives for the 
Illinois consumer protection class, and the Court has determined that Grindel satisfies typicality. As for the others, there is no 
need to decide whether defendants' challenges to typicality have merit because, as explained infra, the unjust enrichment 
classes they propose to represent will not be certified for other reasons. "
1036,68," Plaintiffs also assert that ""[p]laintiffs' Interim Co-Lead Counsel are qualified to lead a certified class."" (Pls.' Mem. at 25.) The

1036,69," The Eleventh Circuit has also endorsed administrative feasibility in an unpublished opinion. See Karhu v. Vital Pharms., Inc.,

administratively feasible method by which class members can be identified.""). But the unpublished decision in Karhu is not 
""binding precedent,"" see U.S. Ct. of App. 11th Cir. R. 36-2, and it appears to conflict with published Eleventh Circuit decisions 
approving the certification of classes that raise the same type of administrative feasibility issues. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick, 635 F.3d 
at 1283 (approving class certification subject to the district court on remand defining the class to include all purchasers of YoPlus 
yogurt during the relevant time period). "
1037,70," See Mullins v. Direct Digital, 795 F.3d at 662 (""Nothing in Rule 23 mentions or implies this heightened requirement under Rule 
23(b).""); Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 844 F.3d 1121, 1123 (9th Cir. 2017) (""A separate administrative feasibility prerequisite

Cir. 2015) (explaining that for ""a class to be sufficiently defined, the court must be able to resolve the question of whether class 
members are included or excluded from the class by reference to objective criteria"")."
1037,72," Compare In re Petrobras Sec., 862 F.3d at 264 (2d Cir. 2017) (rejecting ""freestanding administrative feasibility requirement"" as 
a prerequisite to class certification) with Brecher v. Republic of Argentina, 806 F.3d 22, 24 (2d Cir. 2015) (""the touchstone of 
ascertainability is whether the class is sufficiently definite so that it is administratively feasible for the court to determine whether 
a particular individual is a member.""); see also EQT Prod. Co. v. Adair, 764 F.3d 347, 358 (4th Cir. 2014) (recognizing ""an 
implicit threshold requirement that the members of a proposed class be readily identifiable . . . in reference to objective criteria""); 
John v. Nat'l Sec Fire & Cas. Co., 501 F.3d 443, 445 (5th Cir. 2007) (""The existence of an ascertainable class of persons to be 
represented by the proposed class representative is an implied prerequisite of [Rule 23]."")."
1037,73," Eight cases originated in California, Illinois or Nevada (Seventh and Ninth Circuits); one case came from Missouri (Eighth 
Circuit); one case came from New York (Second Circuit); and three cases were filed in the District of Columbia. The two 
remaining cases came from Pennsylvania (Third Circuit) and Florida (Eleventh Circuit). However, plaintiffs are not seeking to 
certify a consumer protection class in Pennsylvania and the unjust enrichment class will not be certified for other reasons. In 
addition, as noted, the Eleventh Circuit has only endorsed the administrative feasibility test in an unpublished opinion, see 
Karhu, 621 Fed. App'x at 950, although several district courts in Florida have followed that decision. See, [**83]  e.g., Randolph, 
303 F.R.D. at 684-85 (putative class not ascertainable as plaintiff had not offered feasible mechanism for identifying purchasers 
of oils containing ""All Natural"" label).However, under the D.C. Circuit's opinion in In re Korean Air Lines Disaster, this Court must, 
in the case of a circuit split, only apply one interpretation of Rule 23, and where there is no D.C. Circuit precedent on point, ""the 
transferee court [should] be free to decide a federal claim in the manner it views as correct without deferring to the interpretation 
of the transferor circuit."" 829 F.3d at 1174; see also supra pp. 30-32 & n.43."
1037,74," Part of the Third Circuit's justification for imposing a heightened ascertainability requirement was its conclusion that 
defendants ""must be able to challenge class membership"" and that absent class members' claims should be protected from 
dilution ""by fraudulent or inaccurate claims."" Carrera, 727 F.3d at 309-10. But, as the Seventh and Ninth Circuits have pointed 
out, these issues do not arise in a case (like this one) where the amount of damages is the same for each unit sold and liability 
can be determined on an aggregate basis by multiplying that amount by the number of units sold during the class period. See 
Briseno, 844 F.3d at 1132; Mullins v. Direct Digital, 795 F.3d at 670. Under those circumstances, ""the identity of particular class 
members does not implicate the defendant's due process interest . . . because the addition or subtraction of individual class "
1038,," members affects neither the defendant's liability nor the total amount of damages it owes to the class."" Briseno, 844 F.3d at 
1132 (quoting Mullins v. Direct Digital, 795 F.3d at 670). In addition, the amount of damages per unit is so small as to discourage 
fraudulent claims. "

result or that results in the sale or lease of goods or services to any consumer[.]"" Cal. Civ. Code § 1770(a). The UCL prohibits 
""unfair competition,"" which includes ""any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice."" Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200.

1048,86," While the six class representatives of the four consumer protection states testified that they would consider fill level to be a 
material factor in their purchasing decision (Esparza Dep. at 45; Marsh Dep. at 17, 35-36; Pellitteri Dep. at 21, 46; Grindel Dep. 
at 16, 19; Vladimirsky Dep. at 12, 25; Liberov Dep. at 16; see also supra Section III.C (analysis of typicality)), other deponents 
attributed their purchasing decisions to brand loyalty, including the plaintiffs who were withdrawn as Illinois class representatives 
(see Bittle Dep. at 27 (""I just grab the McCormick""); Theis Dep. at 21 (buys McCormick spices and will continue to buy because 
""McCormick is a good name. It's a good brand, and my mother used to use McCormick.""), the plaintiff from Connecticut (see 
Fernandez Dep. at 25-26 (""we've just always bought McCormick, so it's kind of out of habit""), and the plaintiff from New Jersey 
who voluntarily dismissed her suit prior to the filing of the motion for class certification (see Marron Dep. at 16 (""Q. Is it fair to say 
you just grabbed the McCormick tin? A. Yes."")). "
1050,87," This conclusion is reinforced by the substantial possibility that more than a few class members already knew about the alleged 
nonfunctional slack-fill at the time of purchase given the publicity starting in June 2015 in the Wall Street [**119]  Journal and the 
Minneapolis Star Tribune. These class members were not ""actually deceived"" and thus cannot recover under Illinois law."
1050,88," For example, the defendant's consultant warned it against using the term ""instant coffee""; ""[n]umerous expert surveys in the 
record concluded that few consumers understood the true nature of [defendants'] product""; the defendant conducted ""focus-
group testing to determine whether participants would notice anything amiss about [its product]""; one expert opined that as the 
product was ""three to four times more expensive than the typical instant coffee that may be spooned into a cup of hot water,"" 
""only a very 'price insensitive' consumer, or one who was misled, would use a $100 brewer [i.e., the Keurig machine] to heat 
water to make instant coffee."" Suchanek, 764 F.3d at 753-54. "
1059,1," The term ""Slack-Filled Pepper Products"" is defined in the Court's Memorandum Opinion filed this same date. "
1061,1," The court understands ""target conversion rate"" to refer to the freezer's efficiency, specifically the amount of CO2 that was 
needed to operate it."
1061,2," For ease of reference, this order will refer collectively to all agreements entered into on November 1, 2014 as ""the 2014 
Agreement."" However, as the court's analysis below reflects, the ""agreement"" is in fact composed of multiple separate contracts. "
1067,3," Partial rescission of a contract is disfavored under New Jersey law. See County of Morris v. Fauver, 153 N.J. 80, 707 A.2d 958, 
966 (N.J. 1998) (""As a general rule, rescission 'must be exercised in toto and is to be applied to the contract in its entirety with 
the result that what has been done is wholly undone and no contract provisions remain in force to bind either of the parties'"") 
(quoting Merickel v. Erickson Stores Corp., 255 Minn. 12, 95 N.W.2d 303, 306 (Minn. 1959)). ""Only where a contract is 
severable into different transactions may one of those separate transactions be avoided."" Id.; see also Bonnco Petrol, Inc. v. 
Epstein, 115 N.J. 599, 560 A.2d 655, 662 (N.J. 1989). "
1070,4," The parties dispute whether the 2011 Agreement remained in force following execution of the 2014 Agreement. Linde contends 
that the 2014 Agreement amounts to a novation, which ""substitutes a new contract and extinguishes the old one."" Wells Reit II-
80 Park Plaza, LLC v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, 414 N.J. Super. 453, 25 N.J. Tax 537, 999 A.2d 489, 497 (N.J. App. Div. 2010). By 
contrast, Valley Protein argues that ""the 2011 Agreement arguably remained in effect."" (Doc. No. 53 at 9.) The court 
acknowledges this dispute but need not reach this issue since Linde's counter-claim for breach of contract may be disposed of 
on alternative grounds, as explained below. "
1074,5," While the court finds that this particular statement within Coyle's declaration must be disregarded under the sham affidavit rule, 
it does not follow that all statements contained within it must also be disregarded. For instance, Coyle states in his declaration 
that Linde's engineer, Amanda Guzman, represented in October 2014 that the poultry-freezing equipment to be provided under 
the 2014 Agreement would be capable of processing 5,000 pounds of poultry per hour. (Coyle Decl. at ¶ 9.) Although the 
evidence establishes that Linde was unaware that a 5,000-pound-per-hour processing capacity was a requirement for Valley 
Protein at the time the 2014 Agreement was executed (see Doc. No. 52-4 at 19), that does not affirmatively prove that the 
statement contained within the Coyle declaration was never made. "
1076,6, Citation to these unpublished Ninth Circuit opinions is appropriate pursuant to Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3(b).
1076,7," California courts undertake a similarly functional analysis in other areas. For instance, in determining whether a particular 
cause of action sounds in tort or contract, California courts eschew a more formalistic approach in favor of an examination of 
""the quintessence of the action."" Voth v. Wasco Pub. Util. Dist., 56 Cal. App. 3d 353, 356, 128 Cal. Rptr. 608 (1976) (""Whether 
an action is contractual or tortious depends upon the nature of the right sued upon, and not the form of the pleading or the relief 
demanded.""); accord Amtower v. Photon Dynamics, Inc., 158 Cal. App. 4th 1582, 1602, 71 Cal. Rptr. 3d 361 (2008). "
1080,8," Neither Linde nor Valley Protein acknowledge that a split of authority exists on this point nor have they briefed the issue of 
which test this court should adopt. In the absence of any briefing addressing this point, the court declines to resolve the question 
of what test should properly apply. "
1081,9," If the parties are unavailable on August 20, 2019 at 9:30 a.m., they are directed to contact Courtroom Deputy Jami Thorp at 
(559) 499-5652, or JThorp@caed.uscourts.gov, within ten days of service of this order to reschedule the status conference to a 
mutually agreeable date. "
1112,1," ADS also brought state tort law claims, which the district court disposed of after trial. ADS does not pursue these claims on 
appeal. "
1113,2," It does not matter that ADS seeks declaratory, rather than monetary, relief under the District Act. HN5[
] Declaratory relief 
""presupposes the existence of a judicially remediable right"" and thus cannot be pursued without a predicate right of action.

(Baylson, J.)."
1119,5," There is some disagreement about whether the subsidiaries and related entities are wholly owned, separately-organized, or 
otherwise related to Homebuilder Plaintiffs. The Court's analysis below applies with equal force to any subsidiaries or related 
entities that are separately-organized legal entities, as opposed to divisions within each Homebuilder Plaintiff's corporate 
structure. To the extent the parties continue to disagree about which subsidiaries and related entities named in Defendants' 
Motion are, in fact, divisions, further briefing may be required. "
1120,6," In their Separate Statement of Material Facts, Homebuilder Plaintiffs characterize these subsidiaries as ""divisions,"" but 
Defendants argue in response that they are, in fact, separately incorporated limited liability corporations with separate legal 
existences. (See Pl.'s SOF ¶ 19; Resp. to Pl's SOF ¶ 19)."
1120,7," Homebuilder Plaintiffs take issue with Defendants' characterization of these subsidiaries as ""separately-organized"" because 
Homebuilder Plaintiffs contend these subsidiaries were acquired as part of TRI Pointe Homes, Inc.'s acquisition of 
Weyerhaueser Real Estate Company in 2014. (See Resp. to SOF ¶ 11; see also Pl.'s SOF ¶ 22; Resp. to Pl.'s SOF ¶ 22)."
1120,8," Homebuilder Plaintiffs take issue with Defendants' characterization of these subsidiaries, which Homebuilder Plaintiffs contend 
ignores the fact that three of the four subsidiaries—Plum Canyon Master LLC, Porter Ranch Development Co., and Shapell 
Industries, Inc.—were acquired by Toll Brothers, Inc. in 2014. (See Resp. to SOF ¶ 17; see also Pl.'s SOF ¶ 30; Resp. to Pl.'s 
SOF ¶ 30). "
1121,9," Of the remaining six Homebuilder Plaintiffs named in this suit, three—M/I Homes, Inc., Ashton Woods Holdings L.L.C., D.R. 
Horton Los Angeles Holding Company, Inc.—have produced assignments-of-claims for their subsidiaries' wallboard purchases. 
(SOF ¶¶ 21, 24, 27). The other three—Meritage Homes Corporation, Pulte Home Corporation, and CalAtlantic Group, Inc.—
seek damages only for their own wallboard purchases or for the purchases of their predecessor entities, and do not assert 
claims on behalf of any subsidiaries. (Id. ¶¶ 29, 31, 33, 34). The Homebuilder Plaintiffs contest Defendants' characterization of 
their claims to the extent it intends to limit in any way the damages recoverable by these six Homebuilder Plaintiffs. (Resp. to 
SOF ¶¶ 23, 26, 29, 31, 33, 34)."
1121,10," Homebuilder Plaintiffs admit that they produced these contention statements, but deny that their production was the first time 
that Homebuilder Plaintiffs comprehensively identified the legal entities that made purchases for which they claim damages. 
(Resp. to SOF ¶ 41)."
1121,11," Defendants admit that the Corporate Disclosure Statements identified the subsidiaries as such, but deny that they disclosed 
that the subsidiaries made drywall purchases in 2012-15 for which Homebuilder Plaintiffs are seeking damages in this action. 
(Resp. to Pl.'s SOF ¶¶ 3, 9, 25). The parties also disagree about the extent to which Defendants sought discovery from the 
subsidiaries or asked questions about corporate structure and subsidiary purchases during depositions. (Pl.'s SOF ¶¶ 33-38; 
Resp. to Pl.'s SOF ¶¶ 33-38). "
1122,12," The Court noted in its recent Choice of Law MSJ Opinion, and reiterates here, that Homebuilder Plaintiffs have contended 
throughout this action they are entitled to damages for all wallboard purchases, whether direct or indirect. The Court does not 
reach any conclusions as to whether Homebuilder Plaintiffs qualify as direct or indirect purchasers in ruling on this Motion. "
1134,1," We also note that the Town apparently did not credit Defendants' alleged misrepresentations, approving the Braddock Park 
Homes development project despite their vocal opposition to approval of the project. "
1138,1," By order filed June 11, 2019, the Court took the motion under submission."
1138,2," ""Flow cytometry is a powerful, laser-based technology used for identifying and quantifying cellular characteristics on a cell-by-
cell basis that offers a variety of biomedical and therapeutic applications."" (See id. ¶ 1.)"
1138,3," ""Reagents are essential consumable substances used in flow cytometers to identify and analyze certain cellular 
characteristics,"" which ""are marketed and sold separate and apart from the cytometry machines themselves."" (See id. ¶ 20.) In 
particular, reagents are specifically ""designed to be excited by lasers of different wavelengths"" and, ""[w]hen excited by the 
intended laser, the reagents fluoresce . . . and provide[] information regarding the cell at issue."" (See id.)"
1138,4," The FACSymphony is BD's ""highest-end UV cytometer."" (See id. ¶ 23.)"
1138,5," The Individual Defendants are ""nine former BD employees"" who ""left BD . . . and joined Cytek."" (See id. ¶ 4.) "
1140,6," To the extent BD, citing Apple, Inc. v. Psystar Corp., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1190 (N.D. Cal. 2008), and Oracle Am., Inc. v. 
Cedarcrestone, Inc., 938 F. Supp. 2d 895 (N.D. Cal. 2013), contends the UV reagent market is ""invalid as a matter of law"" 
because such market ""is the functional equivalent of a contractually-created aftermarket"" (see Mot. at 17:23-24), the Court 
disagrees. Specifically, the Court finds the cases on which BD relies in support of such argument are distinguishable because, 
inter alia, each concerned aftermarket restrictions that were ""fully disclosed and expressly agreed upon."" See Psystar, 586 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1203."
1140,7," Although BD also argues the UV reagent market is not legally cognizable because ""the FACC does not offer any factual 
allegations to show a lack of cross-elasticity between the products included in and excluded from [said] proposed market"" (see 
Reply at 9:20-21), the argument was raised for the first time in the Reply and, consequently, the Court does not consider it 
further herein. As set forth below, however, Cytek will be given leave to amend, and it may wish to address this issue in its 
amended allegations. "
1141,8," Contrary to BD's argument, the Supreme Court, in Illinois Tool Works Inc. v. Independent Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 31, 126 S. Ct. 
1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006), did not overrule the cases on which Morrison relied in setting forth the elements of a per se tying 
claim under section 16727, and BD has not cited, nor has the Court located, any authority citing Illinois Tool Works for such 
proposition. "
1145,1," During the alleged conspiracy period, Millennium was acquired by Cristal USA Inc. The briefing refers to the company 
interchangeably as Millennium, Millennium/Cristal, and Cristal. For ease reference, this order refers to the company as 
Millennium."
1145,2, The parties refer to the case interchangeably as Haley Paint and In re Titanium Dioxide. 
1151,3," The cited evidence is an appendix submitted by the plaintiffs in Haley Paint, setting forth the chronology of price increase 
announcements. The Court may take judicial notice of the appendix as a court record. See Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. Visa USA, 
Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 746 n.6 (9th Cir. 2006) (""We may take judicial notice of court filings and other matters of public record.""). As 
noted above, the fact that the document itself is subject to judicial notice ""does not mean that every assertion of fact within that 
document is judicially noticeable for its truth."" Khoja, 899 F.3d at 999. The Court finds it appropriate to accept the truth of the 
chronology here, because it is not challenged by Defendants and ""can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose 
accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned."" Id. "
1156,1," The instant case is a putative class action in which Plaintiff purports to represent a proposed class comprised of all 
""independent physicians and/or independent physician practices"" alternatively in the Erie County MSA or the 29-county Western 
Pennsylvania area who treat patients covered by a ""Highmark health insurance product."" Dkt. No. 42 at ¶¶ 1, 67."
1156,2," Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.L. No. 111-148, 124 Stat. 119 (2010) (the ""ACA"") (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 
18001 et seq.)."
1156,3," Reimbursements are the payments insurers give to providers to cover services rendered to the insurers' subscribers. West 
Penn, 627 F.3d at 92."
1156,4," According to Plaintiff, Highmark defines Western Pennsylvania to include Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Bedford, Blair, Butler, 
Cambria, Cameron, part of Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Fayette, Forest, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, 
Jefferson, Lawrence, McKean, Mercer, Potter, Somerset, Venango, Warren, Washington, and Westmoreland counties. Dkt. No. 
42 at ¶ 2 n.1. "
1157,5," The PPA is a standard form contract drafted by Highmark. Plaintiff contends that Highmark does not negotiate any of its terms, 
including reimbursement rates. Dkt. No. 42 at ¶¶ 59-60."
1157,6," In its entirety, the All Products Clause reads: Network Product Participation. Provider must and, where applicable, must 
ensure that all Practitioners participate in all Network Products covered under this Agreement, as described by [Keystone Health 
Plan West] and so long as Provider and Practitioners, as applicable, meet all required Participation Criteria applicable to a 
Network Product. Provider's and each Practitioner's participation in a Network Product will be subject to all terms and conditions 
contained in this Agreement and, as applicable, related attachments hereto. Provider and [Keystone Health Plan West] agree 
that such participation is not exclusive and that other Providers and Practitioners may also participate as designated by 
[Keystone Health Plan West]."
1157,7," A monopsony is a monopoly, but on the ""buy side"" of the market, in which one consumer is able to dictate conditions in the 
given market based on its dominant position. See Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons Hardwood Lumber Co., 549 U.S. 312, 
320, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2007) (""a monopsony is to the buy side of the market what a monopoly is to the sell 
side and is sometimes colloquially called a 'buyer's monopoly""). As mentioned previously, health insurers, such as Highmark, are 
considered ""buyers"" of doctors' services. Dkt. 35 at 7 (citing Kartell, 749 F.2d at 924. "
1158,8," The Court originally dismissed Plaintiff's Section 1 claim with prejudice. Dkt. No. 35 at 16. Plaintiff then filed a motion for 
reconsideration its Section 1 claim under a tying theory. Dkt. 38. After full briefing and consideration, the Court granted Plaintiff's 
motion. Dkt. No. 41. "
1160,9," ""Antitrust injury"" is but one element of ""antitrust standing,"" which involves an analysis of ""(1) the causal connection between the 
antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff and the intent by the defendant to cause that harm, with neither factor alone 
conferring standing; (2) whether the plaintiffs alleged injury is of the type for which the antitrust laws were intended to provide 
redress; (3) the directness of the injury, which addresses the concerns that liberal application of standing principles might 
produce speculative claims; (4) the existence of more direct victims of the alleged antitrust violations; and (5) the potential for 
duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages."" In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litig., 998 F.2d 1144,1165-
66 (3d Cir. 1993). Highmark has challenged only the sufficiency of Plaintiff's showing antitrust injury, and no other element of 
antitrust standing. See Dkt. No. 48 at 7 n.1; see generally Dkt. No. 47 at 6-12."
1160,10," The Third Circuit has left unresolved which to address first, ""an antitrust violation or an antitrust injury."" Phila. Taxi, 886 F.3d at 
338. As such, the Court sees no issue in starting with the prudential antitrust standing issue before proceeding to the substantive 
claims of Section 1 and 2. "
1161,11," Specifically, Plaintiff contends that Highland has attempted ""multiple times"" to buy out Plaintiff's practice and get Plaintiff to 
""join Highmark's own system at St. Vincent Hospital."" Dkt. No. 42 at ¶ 48. According to Plaintiff, this behavior constitutes a 
pattern in which ""Highmark aims to absorb its rivals in the outpatient patient services market, or put them out of business."" Dkt. 
No. 48 at 4. "
1164,12," The Court applies the same standard as a claim of monopoly to this situation of an allege monopsony based on the close 
""kinship between monopoly and monopsony,"" which suggests that ""similar legal standards should apply to claims of 
monopolization and to claims of monopsonization."" Weyerhaeuser Co., 549 U.S. at 322. "
1167,13," The ""Professional (or Participating or Preferred) Provider Agreement,"" which is the standard form contract governing the 
relations between the parties. See supra at 4."
1167,14," The parties disagree as to whether the Court may consider Exhibit A. Compare Dkt. No. 48 at 24 n.7 (Plaintiff arguing that the 
Court should ""strike or disregard"" the Exhibit because ""[a] court may not consider materials outside the pleadings on a Rule 
12(b)(6) motion"") (citing Pension Benefit Guar. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc., 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993); Fed. R. Evid. 
201(b)) with Dkt. No. 49 at 9 n.6 (Defendants arguing that the Court may consider Exhibit A ""because it is a matter of public 
record"") (citing Pension Benefit Guar., 998 F.2d at 1197). The Court finds that it may consider Exhibit A as a ""matter of public 
record."" See Pension Benefit Guar., 998 F.2d at 1197) (""Courts have defined a public record, for purposes of what properly may 
be considered on a motion to dismiss, to include ... letter decisions of government agencies.""). "
1168,15," The Supreme Court has devised ""three approaches"" to analyzing a Parker doctrine defense: ""(1) ipso facto immunity, (2) 
Midcal scrutiny, and (3) Hallie scrutiny."" Edinboro Coll. Park Apartments, 850 F.3d at 572 (referencing California Retail Liquor 
Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 100 S. Ct. 937, 63 L. Ed. 2d 233 (1980) and Town of Hallie v. City of Eau 
Claire, 471 U.S. 34, 105 S. Ct. 1713, 85 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1985)). Which applies is determined by whether the ""relevant actor"" is 
""comparable to a sovereign power, a private business, or something in between."" Id. at 572. Here, both parties utilize the Midcal 
standard. See Dkt. No. 47 at 22; Dkt. No. 48 at 21 (citing to Edinboro Coll, Park Apartments, 850 F.3d 567). This is the correct 
standard as ""Midcal analysis applies where private actors seek to immunize their anticompetitive conduct under the Parker 
doctrine"" and Highmark is a private actor. Edinboro Coll. Park Apartments, 850 F.3d at 573 (citing Midcal, 445 U.S. at 106). "
1170,16," Even more fatal to Plaintiff's argument, however, is the fact that the Eleventh Circuit, sitting en banc, subsequently reversed 
this very holding on this very point, albeit after Plaintiff filed its memorandum in opposition to Highmark's motion to dismiss. See 
Quality Auto Painting Ctr. of Roselle, Inc. v. State Farm Indem. Co., 917 F.3d 1249, 1272-73 (11th Cir. 2019) (en banc) 
(""[Plaintiffs] cite no law—in any of the four states—to the effect that market power alone is sufficient to invalidate a contract 
voluntarily entered into"")."

1177,1," There are two sections labeled ""Count IV"" in the Second Amended Complaint. The Court presumes that this is a numbering 
error and will refer to the second section labeled Count IV, pleading tortious interference against all Defendants, as Count V. "
1179,2," To the extent that Defendants intended to argue that Plaintiffs failed to adequately plead an essential element of a price 
discrimination claim under the RPA—two separate and contemporaneous sales to two distinct purchasers—Defendants are 
incorrect, The allegations in Security Tire were deficient because the defendants in that case ""did not make a sale to two buyers 
at the same level of competition"" and so the plaintiff ""could not have suffered secondary-line injury."" Eximco, Inc. v. Trane Co., 
737 F.2d 505, 517 (5th Cir. 1984) (discussing Security Tire), Here, however, Plaintiffs adequately pleaded two separate and 
contemporaneous sales to direct competitors: Wave, which is a corporation that is not Nortek's subsidiary, and Plaintiffs, which 
are limited liability companies that are not Nortek's subsidiaries. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3-23, 38, 45, 49, 68, 97. "
1180,3," Some circuits adopted a narrow interpretation of the cost-plus exception in light of Kansas v. UtiliCorp United. See EARL W. 
KINTNER ET AL., 11 FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW § 78.8(c)(3) (collecting cases). To date, however, neither the Fifth Circuit nor the 
Supreme Court has overruled In re Beef. "
1181,4," The Court also notes that leading treatises and practice guides agree that § 2(c) prohibits commercial bribery. See, e.g., 14 
PHILLIP E. AREEDA & HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 2632i (3d ed. 2012) (""[RPA § 2(c)] was intended to cover some 
practices that could be described as 'commercial bribery.'""); CORPORATE COUNSEL'S GUIDE TO ROBINSON-PATMAN ACT § 3:13 
(2018) (""In addition to the various state statutes, federal laws also proscribe commercial bribery, such as the [RPA], otherwise 
known as the price discrimination law."")."
1181,5," These elements are consistent with the language of § 2(c). See 15 § 13(c), "
1182,6," To the extent that the alleged bribe needs to cross the seller-buyer line—i.e., where the payment is paid ""by the [buyer] with the 
intent to improperly influence or corrupt"" the seller's conduct, Blue Tree Hotels Inv. (Can), Ltd. v. Starwood Hotels & Resorts 
Worldwide, Inc., 369 F.3d 212, 222 (2d Cir, 2004); Seaboard Supply Co., 770 F.2d at 372, the Court finds that Plaintiffs satisfied 
this requirement by pleading that Wave, the buyer, paid the bribe to Nortek's agents, the seller. See Second Am. Compl. ¶¶59-
75. "
1185,7," At the hearing on June 19, 2019, counsel for Plaintiffs clarified that they are not alleging an independent claim for civil

1188,1," AllCare makes a threshold argument that CVMG's motion is untimely. While CVMG did violate the Court's ordered deadline, 
CVMG is correct that 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) requires that ""[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court 
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded."" "
1193,1," The other teams are the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Buffalo Bills, Carolina Panthers, Chicago

Texans, Indianapolis Colts, Jacksonville Jaguars, Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Chargers, Los Angeles Rams, Miami 
Dolphins, Minnesota Vikings, New England Patriots, New Orleans Saints, New York Giants, New York Jets, Philadelphia Eagles, 
Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco 49ers, Seattle Seahawks, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tennessee Titans, and Washington 
Redskins. The full names of the entities controlling those teams and named as defendants can be found at paragraph 19 of 
Oakland's complaint."
1193,2," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c). "
1198,3," Despite this apparent focus of the brief, Oakland's attorneys disclaimed at the hearing an intent to base Oakland's theory of 
recovery on the thirty-two team structure of the NFL."
1198,4," In addressing these two claims together, Oakland appears to agree with Defendants that they describe the same theory of 
recovery. "
1200,5," For the purpose of the present motion, the parties agree that Oakland's declaratory judgment claim stands or falls with its 
antitrust damages claims. See Mot. at 16; Opp'n at 16."
1200,6," Oakland argues in a footnote that the per se rule applies to its claims, Opp'n at 12 n.7, but fails to address precedent holding 
per se doctrines inapplicable in the context of professional sports leagues."
1200,7," To the extent that these labels might be relevant to the analysis of an amended complaint, the Court agrees with Defendants 
that Oakland has not alleged a ""group boycott"" where Oakland claims only that Defendants jointly allowed the Raiders to 
relocate, not an agreement that no team could be located in or do business with Oakland. While the term ""price fixing,"" based on 
the plain meaning of those words, might not apply in the absence of an allegation of any fixed supra-competitive price, that 
doctrine is more on point, as courts have recognized that restrictions on supply can have an equivalent effect to fixing prices. 
See, e.g., Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Gulf Oil Corp., 588 F.2d 221, 226 (7th Cir. 1978) (""[A]n agreement to restrict the 
production of uranium unquestionably is a price fixing arrangement. 'Price fixing' is a characterization which extends to all 
conspiracies designed to manipulate the price of goods.""). "
1201,8," Defendants' arguments that Oakland is not a participant in the same market as Defendants or lacks a sufficiently direct 
relationship to any harm because it is not itself a professional football team neglect the basic principle that markets have at least 
two distinct classes of participants—sellers and buyers. See, e.g., Reply at 5 (asserting that ""the only party 'directly' affected by 
an agreement to prescribe the number of teams would be a team that sought to join the NFL joint venture"")."
1201,9," Oakland's contention that the new host city effectively pays the relocation fee appears to be a dubious proposition, as the 
timeline set forth in the complaint suggests that the amount of public funding provided for a Las Vegas stadium was set well 
before the NFL determined the amount of the relocation fee, and that the relocation fee was set in an arbitrary manner such that 
the amount would have been difficult to predict during the earlier negotiations for public funding."
1201,10," To the extent that the relocation fee might discourage a team from seeking to relocate, that team (or the entity seeking to 
attract it to a new location) might experience a cognizable antitrust injury if, as Oakland contends here, the fee is in fact arbitrary 
and not tied to procompetitive goals. See L.A. Mem'l Coliseum, 726 F.2d at 1397 (""To withstand antitrust scrutiny, restrictions on "
1202,," team movement should be more closely tailored to serve the needs inherent in producing the NFL 'product' and competing with 
other forms of entertainment.""). Such questions are beyond the scope of this case, where neither the Raiders nor any entity in 
Las Vegas has challenged the fee."
1202,11," To the extent that Oakland might have paid such a premium to upgrade the Coliseum when the Raiders returned from Los 
Angeles in the 1990s, it has not asserted that possible injury as a basis for its claims, and the four-year statute of limitations for 
such a claim has almost certainly expired. See 15 U.S.C. § 15b. "
1203,12," It is also not clear that Oakland's status as an ""indirect"" landlord, with the OACCA as a middleman directly contracting with the 
Raiders, bars Oakland's claims. Neither party cites authority addressing analogous circumstances where, as was allegedly the 
case here, an antitrust plaintiff negotiated directly with the defendant despite their contractual relationship running through a third 
party. Moreover, Oakland alleges that it sought to build a new stadium in partnership with the Raiders and other investors, with 
no allegation that the OACCA or any other intermediary would be involved in that relationship. At this time, while it remains 
unclear whether Oakland can amend to cure the more straightforward question of antitrust injury addressed above, Court 
declines to resolve the issue of whether Oakland's ""indirect"" relationship with the Raiders bars its antitrust claims. "
1204,13," At least one court has questioned the propriety of such statements and refused to allow a statement of interest—there, after 
the United State declined to intervene in a qui tam case. United States ex rel. Ruckh v. Salus Rehab., No. 8:11-CV-1303-T-
23TBM, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63325, 2017 WL 1495862, at *1 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 26, 2017); see also, e.g., LSP Transmission 
Holdings, LLC v. Lange, 329 F. Supp. 3d 695, 703 (D. Minn. 2018) (declining as a matter of discretion to consider a statement of 
interest filed months after briefing had concluded). The Court declines to address that issue in this instance. The United States' 
statement in this case does not raise arguments significantly different from those presented in Defendants' briefs, and the 
outcome of the present motion would not differ if the statement were excluded. "
1206,14," ""A contract, made expressly for the benefit of a third person, may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto

1206,15," Although Defendants briefly preserve an argument that the NFL's governing documents should be interpreted under New York 
law, both parties rely primarily on California authority in their arguments regarding Oakland's contract claim, and the Court 
assumes for the purpose of this order that California law applies. "
1207,16," A footnote included here in the policy states that the list of factors was largely ""contained in a bill reported by a Senate 
committee in 1984,"" but ""essentially restate matters that the League has considered important in connection with team location

1241,2," A properly functioning hydraulic clutch system is engaged when the driver depresses the clutch pedal, which causes a piston in 
the CMC to push fluid through the steel hydraulic line to the CSC and against the integrated release bearing, pressurizing the 
system. This in turn causes the clutch kit (pressure plate, clutch disc, and flywheel) to disengage the engine from the 
transmission. Releasing the clutch pedal releases the fluid pressure, which allows the gears to engage smoothly and efficiently. "
1244,3," The Magnuson-Moss Act incorporates the substantive provisions of state warranty laws. See Clemens v. DaimlerChrysler 
Corp., 534 F.3d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir. 2008) (""[T]his court's disposition of the state law warranty claims determines the disposition 
of the Magnuson-Moss Act claims.""); Walsh v. Ford Motor Co., 807 F.2d 1000, 1012, 257 U.S. App. D.C. 85 (D.C. Cir. 1986) 
(""[E]xcept in the specific instances in which Magnuson-Moss expressly prescribes a regulating rule, the Act calls for the 
application of state written and implied warranty law, not the creation of additional federal law.""). Accordingly, we focus only on 
Plaintiff's causes of action under California law—the CLRA and Song-Beverly Act. "
1245,4," We further note that Plaintiff's damages model is consistent with the CLRA's safe harbor provision, which requires that a 
customer ""[n]otify the person alleged to have"" employed unlawful practices and ""[d]emand that the person correct, repair, 
replace, or otherwise rectify the goods or services."" Cal. Civ. Code § 1782(a) (emphasis added)."
1245,5," Section 2715 provides for incidental and consequential damages, which are not at issue here. "
1246,6," Pulaski dealt with claims under the UCL and California's False Advertising Law, not the CLRA. See 802 F.3d at 983. But 
although ""[d]amages under the CLRA on the one hand and restitution under the False Advertising and Unfair Competition Laws 
on the other hand are different remedies,"" the CLRA contemplates restitution, and that concept is treated similarly under the 
three laws. Colgan, 38 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 58-59; see also Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Prods. Co., 23 Cal. 4th 163, 96 Cal. Rptr. 
2d 518, 999 P.2d 706, 713 (Cal. 2000) (discussing the overlap of ""restitution"" and ""damages"")."
1246,7," That conclusion was also inconsistent with the holdings of other circuits, which have described benefit-of-the-bargain recovery 
much as we did in Pulaski. In Carriuolo v. General Motors Co., for example, the Eleventh Circuit cited with approval a Florida 
state case that asked, ""Is a car with defective seatbelt buckles worth less than a car with operational seatbelt buckles? Common "
1247,," sense indicates that it is[.]"" 823 F.3d 977, 987 (11th Cir. 2016) (alteration in original) (quoting Collins v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 
894 So. 2d 988, 991 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004)). The Carriuolo court determined that it confronted a ""similar question"" that was 
also ""amenable to classwide resolution,"" explaining that a manufacturer's misrepresentation may allow it to command a price premium and to overcharge customers systematically. 
Even if an individual class member subjectively valued the vehicle equally with or without the accurate [safety information] 
sticker, she could have suffered a loss in negotiating leverage if a vehicle with perfect safety ratings is worth more on the 
open market. Id. The court therefore rejected the defendant's argument that ""the liability determination will be highly individualized because the 
buying and leasing experiences of each proposed class member were not uniform."" Id. at 985. Instead, the court concluded that 
""damages should reflect the difference between the market value"" of what was promised and what was delivered; ""[u]nlike the 
calculation of an individual consumer's direct pecuniary loss, which would limit the plaintiff to the difference of what she paid and 
the actual value received, the [applicable] 'benefit of the bargain' model provides a standardized class-wide damages figure 
because the plaintiff's out-of-pocket payment is immaterial."" Id. at 986; see also In re Whirlpool Corp. Front-Loading Washer 
Prods. Liab. Litig., 722 F.3d 838, 856-57 (6th Cir. 2013) (""Because all Duet owners were injured at the point of sale upon paying 
a premium price for the Duets as designed, even those owners who have not experienced a mold problem are properly included 
within the certified class.""). "
1248,8," Nissan also argues that the district court's denial of class certification is supported by other grounds in the record, but we 
observe that at least some of these additional contentions—for example, that Plaintiff's ""model misperceives the bargain"" 
because Nissan did not promise that the Class Vehicles were free of defects—are merits arguments, and beyond the scope of 
our review. See Stockwell v. City and County of San Francisco, 749 F.3d 1107, 1113 (9th Cir. 2014) (""Under Rule 23(f), the 
limitation on consideration of the merits to the relevant class certification questions is of jurisdictional significance.""). "
1260,1," Admor states that ""the request for injunctive relief has been limited to precluding Defendants from serving contractors and 
vendors that were actually misappropriated. This was based on information learned after the Complaint and Motion for 
Preliminary Injunction were filed."" ECF No. 55, PageID # 1027. Admor narrowed the scope of its requested preliminary injunction 
in its Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law for the preliminary injunction proceedings. However, Admor has not 
amended its Complaint. Therefore, the scope of the permanent injunction sought in the Complaint remains unchanged. "
1266,1," On or about December 3, 2015, Wheeled Coach changed its name to REV Ambulance Group Orlando, Inc. (ECF No. 17 ¶ 22.) "
1267,2," The SJC Agreement includes many similar clauses to the RR Agreement, including First Priority's obligation to actively and 
effectively sell vehicles, promote the purchase of such vehicles, and maintain an adequate staff and insurance. (ECF No. 17 ¶ 
25.)"
1267,3," The Amended Complaint notes that, following the execution of the SJC Agreement, ""three of the five ambulance brands [First 
Priority] sold and serviced were owned by [REV]: (1) Road Rescue; (2) McCoy Miller; and (3) Marque."" (ECF No. 17 ¶¶ 27.) First 
Priority also sold and serviced two other brands of ambulance vehicles, Demers and Braun, which were unaffiliated with REV. 
(Id.)"
1267,4," First Priority further alleges that, in an effort to ""economically coerce [it]"" and others similarly situated to become ""REV only"" 
dealers, REV introduced a new line of ""economically"" priced Type I and III ambulance vehicles called ""Frontline."" (Id. ¶ 49.) The 
Frontline ambulances are ""priced significantly below the wholesale cost of REV's other similar vehicles and have only been 
offered to REV only dealers."" (Id.) Additionally, REV requires its Frontline dealers to sell those vehicles exactly at the MSRP. 
(Id.) "
1269,5," The Amended Complaint does not include a count three, four, or seven. (ECF No. 17.) "
1271,6," This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the RR and SJC Agreements explicitly provide that the right to use 
trademarks and tradenames was subject to prior written approval of the respective contractors and First Priority has failed to 
allege such written approval was provided. (ECF No. 18-3, Ex. A; ECF No. 18-4, Ex. B.)"
1271,7," Similarly, in Colt Indus., the Third Circuit determined that no license existed because, inter alia, the plaintiff had been prohibited 
from using the defendant's trade name as part of its own. Colt Indus., 844 F.2d at 120. As here, the plaintiff in Colt Indus. ""could 
use [defendant's] name only in a limited sense and that [defendant's] brand name could not be used in [plaintiff]'s business "
1272,," name."" Id. In justifying its holding, the Third Circuit noted that if such an agreement ""constitutes a license to use a trademark, 
then any business selling a brand name product would . . . necessarily be considered as holding a license."" Id."
1272,8," Similarly, this Court is also unpersuaded by First Priority's argument that the holding in McPeak v. S-L Distrib. Co., No. 12-348, 
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123728, 2014 WL 4388526 (D.N.J. Sept. 5, 2014) supports a finding that First Priority had a proprietary 
interest in REV's trademarks. In McPeak, the court identified several factors relevant to showing that a proprietary interest in the 
trademarks were licensed, including, among others, the use of the defendant's marks on business cards, invoices bearing 
defendant's names and marks, and a representation that plaintiff's salespersons were employees or agents of defendant. 2014 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123728, [WL] at *9. None of these factors apply to First Priority."
1272,9," Importantly, the Third Circuit has also held that although defining a proper market can be a fact intensive inquiry requiring 
discovery, see Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs, Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 482, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992), 
there is no ""per se prohibition against dismissal of antitrust claims for failure to plead a relevant market under Fed. R. Civ. P. 
12(b)(6)."" Queen City, 124 F.3d at 436. "
1274,10," REV also contends that First Priority's Sherman Act causes of action - Counts Five and Eight - should be dismissed as the 
""alleged conduct is not actionable under the statute"" as it fails to allege a ""concerted action"" between REV and another party. 
(ECF No. 18-1 at 17-21.) As this Court has already granted REV's Motion to Dismiss First Priority's antitrust claims for failure to 
adequately define a relevant market, it need not consider REV's additional claims concerning these causes of action. 
Nevertheless, in light of First Priority's allegations that First Priority has been harmed by REV's ""exclusive dealing, recent 
mergers to take over competitors, and terminations of dealers for no legitimate reason,"" this Court finds that First Priority's 
antitrust claims have pled concerted actions between REV and third-parties so as to constitute actionable conduct pursuant to 
the applicable antitrust statutes. (ECF No. 17 ¶ 112.) "

1276,13," While the parties agree that Minnesota and Indiana law apply to the SJC and RR Agreements, respectively, REV invokes New 
Jersey law in contending that First Priority's promissory estoppel claim should be dismissed. (ECF No. 18 at 24-25.) Any 
disagreement between the parties as to the controlling law is immaterial, as dismissal of the promissory estoppel claim is also 
warranted under New Jersey law. See Freightmaster USA, LLC v. FedEx, Inc., No. 14-3229, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41519, 2015

1297,2," The Court's order approving the settlement relates only to DPPs, as distinct from other classes of plaintiffs in this action. MDL 
Dkt. No. 249."
1297,3," The Court's order notes that this definition is for settlement purposes only, and has no binding effect on the Court, the DPPs, or 
on the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs in any other context. The Special Master has therefore applied that definition accordingly. "
1298,4," Cisco's initial claim in its Opposition was $199,426,277.79. This figure was revised in its Motion. That motion states that the 
total is $191,759,460.10. MDL Dkt. No. 473 at 11 n. 10. In its Reply Brief, Cisco further reduced the final figure in dispute from 
$154,050,329.40 to $142,070,717.01 based on its decision to exclude Quanta purchases from its second-round settlement 
claim. MDL Dkt. No. 496 at 8 n. 3."
1298,5," Aptiv initially claimed ""at least $180,576,936.74"" in its Opposition to Class Counsel's motion. MDL Dkt. No. 391, at 7-9. It 
revised this figure during the course of briefing this matter, and in its final motion for approval of its settlement claims, it claims 
$146,111,638.53 for foreign purchases, and $2,367,303.69 for additional U.S. Purchases (relating to the NCC/UCC dispute 
discussed infra). MDL Dkt. No. 473 at 13. Combined with its approved claims, Aptiv claims $198,910,686.94 in total qualifying 
purchases."
1298,6," Transcript of May 31, 2019 Hearing before the Special Master (""Transcript"" or ""Tr.""), at 53:1720: ""[A]ll 190 million at issue from 
Aptiv are coming directly to Aptiv. There is no third-party manufacturer at issue at all for all of Aptiv's purchases. Full Stop."" "
1300,7," Class Counsel also requested that the Court proceed with allocation relating to all other non-objecting parties and reserve a 
""Hold Back Fund"" for unresolved claims by potential objecting parties. MDL Dkt. No. 381 at 3:14-16."
1300,8," Specifically, Class Counsel argued that if an ""indirect purchaser"" held assignments from a direct purchaser, those should not 
be held back for payment, but should be resolved separately by the assignor and assignee. MDL Dkt. No. 381 at 7:26-28. Class 
Counsel proposed that the funds be distributed based on each claimant's pro rata share of capacitors directly purchased from 
Defendants during the relevant time period. Id. at 4:10-14."
1300,9," Class Counsel correctly observed that these figures changed substantially between the time of Objecting Members' filing of 
objections to Class Counsel's Allocation Motion, and Objecting Members' own motion to approve their Second Round claims. 
Class Counsel in both its pleadings and at oral argument refer to this disparity as further proof of the lack of certainty and 
reliability in Objecting Members' submissions. "
1302,10," The Special Master notes that the district court in a separate MDL action recently recognized the obligation of counsel to 
ensure that class members not release their claims without compensation in the context of a settlement. See In re Cathode Ray 
Tube (CRT) Antitrust Litigation, MDL No. 1917, Case No. 3:07-cv-05944-JST (""CRT""), Dkt. No. 5362 (Order Denying JPPs' Mot. 
Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 62.1) at 1 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 8, 2018)."
1302,11," Although there are separate releases in this matter, the operative language for these parties is identical. "
1304,12," The parties devote substantial briefing to the application of the ""identical factual predicate"" doctrine articulated in Hesse v. 
Sprint Corp., 598 F.3d 581, 590 (9th Cir. 2010). Objecting Members urge that since their incorporated capacitor claims arise 
from the same factual predicate — i.e., price-fixing by Settling Defendants in their capacitor sales to Objecting Members — then 
their claim would be interpreted as released even if they had not presented the claim and even if it were not presentable in a 
class action. Class Counsel urges a more narrow reading of the doctrine that would exclude claims that lack a ""common interest"" 
with the other class members. The Special Master need not resolve this dispute because it finds that the release does in fact 
encompass incorporated capacitor claims. "
1305,13," Like the Court, Objecting Members rely on various Ninth Circuit authorities that reach similar conclusions, including United 
States v. Hsiung, 778 F.3d 738, 748-58 (9th Cir. 2015), and five district court decisions in this Circuit. MDL Dkt. No. 473 at 7."
1305,14," Tr. at 23 (quoting the Court): ""I held for Flextronics, not you or anyone else, that they were entitled to do that set of claims. . . . 
I did not articulate a general principle that was based on what I did for Flextronics on its evidentiary showing. So I'm not sure why 
you think this is a broad proposition that applies to every potential claimant."" "
1307,15," To prevent prejudice to other Second Round claimants with significant incorporated capacitor claims, Objecting Members have 
proposed that the Court direct that the claim deadline for the Second Round be reopened and merged with the upcoming Third 
Round for the Nichicon and Rubycon settlements. MDL Dkt. No. 473 at 15 n. 14. They propose sending updated information to 
all Second and Third Round claimants advising them of the opportunity to include incorporated capacitor claims. Id. Because the 
Third Round claims are not before the Special Master and this is a matter of Court administration for the Court and the parties, 
the Special Master defers on this suggestion. "
1308,16," Namely, the dispute about duplicative claims for NCC and UCC is the exception. "
1309,17," The Hsiung case from the Ninth Circuit, on which the Court relies, cites with approval other cases noting that defendants' 
conduct must be ""directed at a U.S. import market,' even if the defendants did not engage in importation of products into the 
United States."" Hsiung, 778 F.3d at 755 n.8 (quoting Animal Sci. Prods., Inc. v. China Minmetals Corp., 654 F.3d 462, 471 & n. 
11 (3rd Cir. 2011)). "
1315,1," Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficient as to the essential elements of monopoly power and antitrust 
injury, the Court declines to address the element of willfulness. "
1317,2," Defendant's representation that ""[e]ach and every ANTECH Laboratory Technician is under daily QA/QC programs designed to 
ensure accurate results"" is not mere puffery per se. See Annunziato, 402 F. Supp. 2d at 1140-41 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (finding 
representation of use of the ""most stringent quality control tests"" to be actionable because it ""is a specific factual assertion which 
could be established or disproved through discovery""). Here, however, Plaintiffs do not allege misrepresentation as to the 
existence or extent of Defendant's daily programming. Rather, they allege misrepresentation as to the inferable outcome of such 
programming, i.e., accurate test results, which is nonactionable. For example, in Tietsworth, the court found an assertion that 
products were ""designed, manufactured and tested for years of dependable operations,"" to be mere puffery. 720 F. Supp. 2d at 
1137 (emphasis added). Defendant's assertion that certain programming is implemented to ensure accurate results is likewise 
nonactionable. "
1320,3," Defendant insinuates that Little Critters has no standing to bring any of the asserted claims but does not provide argument why 
Little Critters would not have standing to bring an unlawful business practices claim predicated on an antitrust violation, which 
would not require reliance on a misrepresentation or privity of contract. "
1322,1," The Defendants include Citigroup, Citibank, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., and Citigroup Global Markets Limited (""Citi""); Bank 
of America Corporation, Bank of America N.A., and Merrill Lynch (""Bank of America""); Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank, and 
Barclays Capital Inc. (""Barclays""); BNP Paribas, S.A. and BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (""BNP Paribas""); Credit Suisse Group 
AG, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse International, and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (""Credit Suisse""); Deutsche Bank AG 
and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (""Deutsche Bank""); Goldman Sachs Group, Goldman Sachs & Co., Goldman Sachs Bank 
USA, Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P., and Goldman Sachs International (""Goldman Sachs""); HSBC Holdings plc, HSBC 
Bank plc, HSBC Bank USA, N.A., and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. (""HSBC""); JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and J.P. Morgan Securities plc (""JP Morgan""); Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A., 
Morgan Stanley & Co., Morgan Stanley Capital Services LLC, Morgan Stanley Derivative Products Inc., and Morgan Stanley 
Bank International Limited (""Morgan Stanley""); Royal Bank of Scotland plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, and RBS 
Securities Inc. (""RBS""); UBS Securities LLC (""UBS"") and UBS AG, and the affiliates and subsidiaries of these organizations that 
participated in the CDS market. As discussed in further detail below, the Court previously dismissed all claims with respect to 
Defendants UBS AG and RBS in its September 28, 2018 Opinion and Order. "
1323,2," The following facts are taken from the Complaint (Doc. No. 1 (""Complaint"" or ""Compl."")), and are assumed true for purposes of 
this motion. See ATSI Cominc'ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., 493 F.3d 87, 98 (2d Cir. 2007). In ruling on the motion, the Court has 
also considered Defendants' memorandum of law (Doc. No. 97 (""Mem."")), Defendant HSBC's supplemental memorandum of law 
(Doc. No. 98 (""HSBC Mem."")), Plaintiffs' memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants' motion (Doc. No. 116 (""Opp'n"")), 
Plaintiffs' supplemental memorandum of law in opposition to HSBC's memorandum (Doc. No. 117 (""Opp'n to HSBC"")), 
Defendants' reply (Doc. No. 123 (""Reply"")), Defendant HSBC's supplemental reply (Doc. No. 125 (""HSBC Reply"")), Plaintiffs' 
notice of supplemental authority (Doc. No. 135), and Defendants' response to Plaintiffs' notice of supplemental authority (Doc. 
No. 136)."
1323,3," As used here, the term ""CDS"" refers to both the singular and plural form. "
1325,4," Plaintiffs also allege that this is not the first time Defendants have been accused of conspiring to block an independent 
electronic CDS platform to maintain supracompetitive CDS trading profits, as the U.S. Department of Justice and the European 
Commission both investigated Defendants' conduct in the CDS market in 2011. (Compl. 11 16.) Furthermore, as discussed in 
greater detail below, in September 2015, Defendants paid $1.86 billion to settle a class action lawsuit brought by investors who 
alleged that Defendants fixed prices on CDS transactions and blocked the launch of the Credit Market Derivatives Exchange 
(""CDMX""), an electronic exchange and clearinghouse for CDS. (Id.) "
1327,5," The parties in In re CDS reached a settlement resolving all claims, to which Judge Cote granted preliminary approval in 
October 2015 and final approval in April 2016. (Doc. No. 3 at 2.)"
1327,6," On July 28, 2017, Judge Engelmayer issued an opinion and order in which he granted defendants' motion to dismiss Sherman 
Act Section 1 claims covering the period 2008-2012, denied the motion with respect to the period spanning 2013-2016, granted 
the motion to dismiss tortious interference with business relations and unjust enrichment claims except as to claims made by 
class plaintiffs, limited plaintiffs' state law claims to the 2013-2016 period, and dismissed all claims against HSBC and the two 
non-bank defendants. See In re IRS, 261 F. Supp. 3d 430, 500 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). Discovery in that case remains ongoing while 
the parties brief class certification. (See Case No. 16-md-2704 (PAE), Doc. No. 828.) "
1331,7," For purposes of this calculation, the Court did not include the facts set forth in the Complaint's introduction, which are 
appropriately phrased at a higher degree of generality than those alleged in the Complaint's facts section."
1331,8," While the use of a generic corporate name may pose obstacles to establishing personal jurisdiction over a defendant, as the 
Court found in its September 28, 2019 Order dismissing Tera's claims against UBS AG (Doc. No. 134), only UBS AG and RBS 
challenged the Court's personal jurisdiction. All other Defendants have waived any objections to personal jurisdiction by failing to 
raise them in their motion to dismiss. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12. "
1332,9," In re IRS is broader in scope than the instant case and therefore the longer complaints in that action included many factual 
allegations inapposite here. However, even as to conduct and events that are equally significant in both cases, the In re IRS 
pleadings contain more detail than does the Complaint. Some allegations included in the In re IRS pleadings that would 
strengthen Tera's CDS allegations are mysteriously absent from the Complaint. See, e.g., In re IRS Javelin and TeraExchange 
Plaintiffs' Second Consolidated Amended Complaint ¶ 231 (alleging that ""in July 2015, certain of the Dealer Defendant FCMs, 
including those of Barclays, BNP [Paribas], Credit Suisse, and JP Morgan, began jointly penalizing certain buy-side firms that 
were pushing against the bifurcated market structure by hiking their clearing fees by as much as ten-fold, while obedient buy-
side customers [were] protected"" (internal quotations omitted)); Id. ¶ 199 (describing a named Barclays official who used the 
excuse that Barclays was ""resource constrained"" as a pretext for refusing to establish trade clearing for TeraExchange and 
alleging that Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Suisse used the same language). "
1335,10," Because the Court's September 28, 2019 Order dismissed Tera's claims against UBS AG for lack of personal jurisdiction (see 
Doc. No. 134 at 4), the term ""UBS"" as used here refers to UBS Securities LLC, the only UBS entity that remains a party to this 
lawsuit. "
1336,11," The Complaint also refers to UBS when it alleges that a UBS official publicly stated his opposition to the ongoing practice of 
name give-up (Compl. ¶ 131); however, this claim is not a factual allegation about UBS's participation in the conspiracy, but 
rather a component of Tera's argument that the practice of name give-up no longer had a legitimate purpose. "
1339,12," Tera argues that this plus factor is particularly weighty here because, in light of Judge Cote's finding in In re CDS, ""this is the 
second time Defendants have conspired to prevent exchange-based CDS trading to preserve the RFQ system."" (Opp'n at 24.) 
The Court disagrees. Because In re CDS concluded in a settlement without any determination of liability, see Order Preliminarily 
Approving Settlements and Providing for Notice to the Settlement Class, I3-md-2476-DLC (Doc. No. 465), Judge Cote's finding 
that a common motive to conspire had been sufficiently pleaded to withstand a motion to dismiss does not support the 
conclusion that ""this is the second time Defendants have conspired"" in the CDS market. Likewise, the Court does not find the 
Complaint's allegations about past regulatory investigations related to Defendants' conduct in the CDS market to be probative 
because those investigations were closed without adverse findings and were related to conduct in a different time period and 
regulatory landscape. See Compl. ¶ 16; In re IRS, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 477 n.25 (citing In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., 502 F.3d 47, 
51-52 (2d Cir. 2007) (discounting as irrelevant alleged anticompetitive conduct by the same defendants in another region and 
rejecting the claim that ""if it happened there, it could have happened here"")). "
1340,13," The parties dispute whether Tera publicly reported the June 13 trade on its website, which bears upon the question of whether 
the other Defendants could have found out about the trade absent communication from BNP Paribas. Compare Mem. at 27 & 
n,35 (citing a post—oral argument letter by plaintiffs in In re IRS, which refers to data sharing regarding this trade as required by 
CFTC regulations) with Opp'n at 26 (maintaining that Tera did not post any information about the trade or counterparties on its 
website). In light of the Court's obligation to ""accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint"" at the 
motion-to-dismiss stage, Twombly, 550 U.S. at 572 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and because the materials 
cited by Defendants fall far short of the level of clarity necessary to permit the Court to take judicial notice of a fact in 
contradiction of the well-pleaded allegations of the complaint, see Global Network, 458 F.3d at 156, the Court adopts Tera's 
allegation as true."
1340,14," The Complaint also alleges, without supporting facts, that ""Defendants communicated regarding their conspiracy in secret via 
telephone, email, instant messaging, and Bloomberg messaging."" (Compl. ¶ 154.) The Court did not consider this bald assertion 
in determining the degree of interfirm communications alleged by Tera. "
1341,15," The Court previously dismissed Tera's Donnelly Act claim against RBS and UBS AG in its September 28, 2018 Order. (Doc. 
No. 134.) "
1346,1," These allegations are relevant to Plaintiff's antitrust claims. As explained in more detail below, most of Plaintiff's claims require 
it to plead a relevant market, which is composed of a geographic market—the geographic area where Defendants compete—
and a product market—a market of reasonably interchangeable goods. See infra § III.C. 1.a.iii.a."
1346,2," Plaintiff's allegations on this point are inconsistent. Plaintiff later alleges that Defendants sought to ""prevent competition from 
manufacturers of new PMA Parts (substitute parts otherwise manufactured by companies not affiliated with defendants, under 
an FAA program known as Part Manufacturing Authorization)."" Id. ¶ 689 (emphasis added). Thus, there appears to be some 
substitutability of parts. "
1347,3," ""Cross-elasticity"" refers to the responsiveness of the demand for one product to a change in price of another product. This 
concept is used to define a product market in antitrust claims. See United States v. E. I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351 U.S. 
377, 404, 76 S. Ct. 994, 100 L. Ed. 1264 (1956). For example, if ""a slight decrease in the price of cellophane causes a 
considerable number of customers of other flexible wrappings to switch to cellophane, it would be an indication that a high cross-
elasticity of demand exists between [flexible wrappings and cellophane]; that the products compete in the same market."" Id. at 
400. If the products have low cross-elasticity of demand—i.e., a change in the price of one product does not affect demand for 
another product, then the products are likely competing in different markets."
1347,4," The Complaint does not explain what ""as is"" certification entails. "
1349,5, The Complaint does not state who Gaines is.
1349,6," At an unspecified time, Defendants did notify Plaintiff that Plaintiff was breaching the MAA by failing to maintain trained 
technicians, failing to comply with audit requirements, and failing to maintain insurance. Id. ¶ 408. Plaintiff disputes that it 
breached any provision. Id. ¶ 408-10, 412. "
1358,7," To the extent the Court already dismissed a claim in whole or in part, the following analysis constitutes additional grounds for 
dismissing that claim. "
1359,8," On its own review of the Complaint, the Court is of the opinion that Count XXI includes allegations that could be construed as 
giving rise to a tying claim under the Sherman Act. Although Plaintiff never raises this legal theory, ""[t]o survive a 12(b)(6) motion 
to dismiss, a complaint need not correctly categorize the legal theories giving rise to the claims."" Rathborne v. Rathborne, 683 
F.2d 914, 917 n.8 (5th Cir. 1982); see also Shippitsa Ltd. v. Slack, Civ. A. No. 3:18-CV-1036-D, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121994, 
2019 WL 3304890, at *12 (N.D. Tex. July 23, 2019) (""Even if [the] complaint fails to identify a specific legal theory, the court 
cannot dismiss it on that ground.""). Accordingly, the Court addresses a potential tying claim and dismisses it for the reasons 
stated below. See infra § III.C.1.c. "
1360,9," Even if Plaintiff had adequately pleaded that SafranHE USA entered into a conspiracy to fix prices or boycott Plaintiff, the 
Complaint is devoid of any facts showing SafranHE France's or SafranHE Canada's participation in the alleged conspiracies. 
This deficiency is fatal to Plaintiff's claims against SafranHE France and SafranHE Canada, "
1361,10," Plaintiff contends that this is a typo and that the sentence should have read ""United States and Canada."" See Resp. 12 & 
n.17. It is axiomatic that Plaintiff cannot amend the complaint by a brief in opposition to a motion to dismiss. Energy Coal v. Citgo 
Petroleum Corp., 836 F.3d 457, 462 n.4 (5th Cir. 2016) (citing Roebuck v. Dothan Sec., Inc., 515 F. App'x 275, 280 (5th Cir, 
2013)). In any event, this correction would not save Plaintiff's defective market definition. Therefore, the Court will not grant 
Plaintiff leave to amend. See Resp. 12 n.17 (requesting leave to amend); Legate v. Livingston, 822 F.3d 207, 211 (5th Cir. 2016) 
(""[A] district court need not grant a futile motion to amend.""). "
1365,11," The pertinent statement reads: ""Turbomeca USA, Inc. specializes in the design, production, sale and support of low to medium 
power gas turbine engines for helicopters. . . . There are no other FAA authorized . . . Repair Centers within the United States 
qualified to provide all levels of repair and overhaul of the engine and fuel control unit other than Turbomeca USA, Inc.. [sic] 
Also, all manuals and technical documentation required to perform any repairs and/or overhauls on the Turbomeca engines are 
proprietary to Turbomeca USA, Inc. and are not available to non-authorized Repair Centers. Any other company providing repair 
service on this engine would be in violation of FAA regulations."" Third Am. Compl. ¶ 742. "
1373,1, The parties do not specify whether Labor One supplies temporary employees other than through the Community First Program. 
1374,2," This commission appears to be the same as the three percent fee for providing centralized management services. (See Labor 
One Opp. 9 (stating that pursuant to the contract, ""Labor One was to pay Staff Management 3% of its gross sales per invoice for 
Staff Management's role as a fee-charging procurement manager of temporary labor services at McCormick Place for 
Aramark"").) "
1375,3," Labor One equivocates in defining the relevant market for purposes of this claim. In some places, it defines the market as 
""staffing temporary labor services at McCormick Place."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 96; see also, e.g., id. ¶¶ 97-98, 101-02, 104, 106.) In 
other places, it defines the relevant market as ""the Chicago Market for staffing services."" (Id. ¶ 94; see also Labor One Opp. to 
Defs.' Mot. (""Labor One Opp."") [68], 4 (alleging that Staff Management excluded Labor One ""from the relevant market of 
providing temporary labor services at McCormick Place, as well as at any location Aramark services in the Chicago market"").) In 
still others, Labor One defines the relevant market as providing temporary labor services at McCormick Place and Navy Pier, 
another venue in Chicago. (See Labor One Opp. 6.) Because the amended complaint does not contain any factual allegations 
concerning the ""Chicago market"" or Navy Pier, the court will assume that Labor One is relying on the first definition listed here. 
In any event, this issue is immaterial; as the court explains below, it need not address whether Labor One has sufficiently 
alleged a relevant market because it dismisses the antitrust claim on other grounds. "
1376,4," Because Labor One does not allege that its business involves anything other than providing temporary employees, it is unclear 
what incentive Labor One would have to use Staff Management's temporary employees. Likewise, because Labor One alleges 
that Staff Management tried to prevent it from supplying temporary employees from the Community First Program (see, e.g., id. 
¶¶ 36, 45-46), the court does not understand why Staff Management would permit or even desire that Labor One ""transition"" 
those employees to its ""preferred vendor list."" (Id. ¶ 98.) Accordingly, the court assumes that this last allegation is coextensive 
with the allegation that Staff Management tried to exclude Labor One from the relevant market by replacing Labor One's 
temporary employees with its own or those from preferred vendors. (See id. ¶ 36.) "
1377,5," Labor One argues that Staff Management excluded these ""similarly situated"" companies (see Labor One Opp. 9), but no such 
allegation appears in the amended complaint. "
1378,6," Because the court is dismissing this claim for failure to sufficiently plead anticompetitive conduct and an antitrust injury, the 
court need not address Staff Management's arguments that Labor One has failed to allege (1) a relevant market; (2) that Staff 
Management's actions had a substantial effect on interstate commerce; and (3) that Staff Management had monopoly power.

1441,4," The defendants argue, and the plaintiffs do not dispute, that the NFL-Network Agreement is covered by the SBA. But the

1441,5," HN4[
] Under antitrust law, some restraints of trade, such as horizontal agreements among competitors to fix prices, restrict output, and divide markets, are generally deemed to be per se unreasonable, and therefore it is unnecessary to apply the rule of 
reason in order to determine whether such agreements violate Section 1. See In re Musical Instruments & Equip. Antitrust Litig., 
798 F.3d 1186, 1191 (9th Cir. 2015). Although this case concerns a horizontal agreement, the Supreme Court has concluded 
that the per se rule does not apply to agreements involving teams engaged in league sports, on the ground that such sports ""can 
only be carried out jointly."" NCAA, 468 U.S. at 101 (quoting Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 278 (1978)). Therefore, when 
considering agreements among entities involved in league sports, such as here, a court must determine whether the restriction 
is unreasonable under the rule of reason. Id. at 103. "
1446,6," There is no dispute that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the NFL-DirecTV Agreement because they are direct 
purchasers of DirecTV. Nor is there a dispute that the plaintiffs have standing to seek injunctive relief based on the Teams-NFL 
Agreement because ""indirect purchasers are not barred from bringing an antitrust claim for injunctive relief against 
manufacturers."" Lucas Auto. Eng'g, Inc. v. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 140 F.3d 1228, 1235 (9th Cir. 1998). The dissent agrees 
on these points, as well. Dissent at 41 n.2. "
1447,7," The dissent argues that our holding would require the complex damages calculations that the rule in Illinois Brick was intended 
to avoid. Dissent at 41. In Illinois Brick, the Court expressed concern that the judicial system would be too burdened if it had to 
determine how much of the antitrust violator's overcharge to the first purchaser was passed on to the second, third, or fourth 
purchasers in the distribution chain. 431 U.S. at 733 n.13 (""[T]he final purchaser still will have to trace the overcharge through 
each step in the distribution chain.""). But those sorts of calculations are not required in this context. Unlike the situation in Illinois 
Brick, the plaintiffs here do not allege that an innocent middleman has passed through damages caused by a higher-level 
antitrust violator. Because plaintiffs allege that DirecTV is part of the conspiracy, DirecTV directly caused the injury to the 
consumers. Thus, to calculate the plaintiffs' damages, a court would not need to determine to what extent the NFL overcharged 
DirecTV; it would need to consider only the prices consumers paid compared to the prices that would have existed in a 
competitive market. See Los Angeles Mem'l Coliseum Comm'n, 791 F.2d at 1367."
1447,8," Our analysis of ATM Antitrust Fee Litigation accords with the Supreme Court's instruction that in a distribution chain where 
""manufacturer A sells to retailer B, and retailer B sells to consumer C, . . . C may sue B if B is an antitrust violator."" Pepper, 139 
S. Ct. at 1521. Because this rule applies so long as B is an antitrust violator, it is irrelevant whether B is engaged in a price-fixing 
or an output-restricting conspiracy. See id."
1447,9," The dissent echoes this argument, see Dissent at 41 n. 3, but likewise fails to explain a reasoned basis for such a distinction. "
1448,10," By its terms, the SBA applies only to Section 1 of the Sherman Act and has no relevance to the plaintiffs' Section 2 claims. 15 
U.S.C. § 1291."
1448,*, I concur in the rest of the Majority's opinion. 
1449,1," If DirecTV did not overpay the NFL, then consumers have not been damaged by the NFL's horizontal agreement. Under those 
circumstances, any arbitrary inflation in the price set by DirecTV could not have stemmed from that agreement, but must stem 
from some other source."
1449,2," On the other hand, Plaintiffs are correct in asserting that, notwithstanding the direct purchaser rule, they ""have standing to 
challenge the agreements between the teams and the league"" for injunctive relief. Freeman v. San Diego Ass'n of Realtors, 322 
F.3d 1133, 1145 (9th Cir. 2003) (""Illinois Brick doesn't apply to equitable relief.""). Thus, because Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief in 
addition to their damages requests, their claim challenging the NFL Teams' horizontal Agreement is not entirely precluded by the 
direct purchaser rule."
1449,3," The Majority claims that a distinction between price-fixing and output-fixing restrictions is foreclosed by California Dental 
Association. Maj. Op. at 36 (citing Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 777, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999)). 
However, California Dental Association does not discuss the Illinois Brick rule or the distinction between indirect and direct 
purchasers. See generally 526 U.S. 756, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935. Instead, that case stands only for the uncontested 
proposition that a conspiracy to price fix and a conspiracy to restrict output both injure consumers by arbitrarily raising the price 
they pay for a product—i.e., both types of conspiracy have the same anti-competitive effects. Id. at 777. That says nothing about "
1450,," whether a particular consumer's injury is direct or indirect, or which consumers are authorized to seek judicial redress (i.e., which 
consumers do not rely on a pass-on theory of injury). Indeed, in Illinois Brick itself, the Court acknowledged that the indirect 
purchasers were injured by the manufacturer overcharging the distributor, but held that those purchasers were not the proper 
parties to sue to recover damages. 431 U.S. at 744-46. The Majority's reliance on Apple Inc. v. Pepper, is likewise misplaced, as the plaintiffs in that case purchased the relevant good 
directly from the monopolizing entity—not from a middleman who conspired with the monopolizing entity down the line. 139 S. 
Ct. 1514, 1521, 203 L. Ed. 2d 802 (2019). Here, Plaintiffs purchased a service from DirecTV, which is not a party to the NFL's 
horizontal agreement. While the Majority is correct that ""we are required to take a holistic look at how the interlocking 
agreements actually impact competition,"" Maj. Op. at 24, determining whether a party has alleged anti-competitive effects is 
distinct from determining whether the party is a direct or indirect purchaser with respect to a specific agreement—and none of 
the cases cited by the majority say otherwise, or even address that issue."
1450,4," Relying exclusively on the fact that Plaintiffs ""allege that DirecTV is part of the conspiracy,"" the Majority conclusively states that 
""a court would not need to determine to what extent the NFL overcharged DirecTV,"" because ""it would need to consider only the 
prices consumers paid compared to the prices that would have existed in a competitive market."" Maj. Op. at 34 n. 7. However, it 
is unclear how in practice a court could consider what the theoretical consumer price would have been in a competitive market 
(absent the NFL's horizontal agreement) without considering whether and how much of an overpayment DirecTV made. "
1457,1," The background section is drawn from the allegations of the complaint, documents incorporated into the complaint by 
reference, and matters subject to judicial notice. See Louisiana Mun. Police Employees' Ret. Sys. v. Wynn, 829 F.3d 1048, 1063 
(9th Cir. 2016). "
1469,1," Because of the voluminous nature of the disputed RFPs and responses, the Court will not recite each of the requests and 
objections in this Order, but has attached the relevant requests, along with Sohail's responses and objections as Appendix A. "
1471,2," Based on the Court's review of the RFPs at issue, it appears that neither the Motion nor Plaintiff's Supplemental Brief makes 
any distinction between RFPs that are directed at JadooTV and those that may be more specifically targeted to obtain 
information regarding Sohail's potential liability in an individual capacity. "

false or misleading representations of fact, including but not limited to those found in the Yardi January 14 Announcement 
accusing Entrata of engaging in SQL injection and alteration of .dll files in the Voyager code, as well as stating that newer 
versions of the Voyager application do not integrate with Entrata's Point Solutions Products."" (bold added).) "
1534,2," Yardi does not address the fact that Entrata, in its First Amended Complaint, seeks injunctive relief under the Lanham Act. (See 
FAC ¶ 123, ECF No. 55 at 50.) Yardi's own cited authority provides that ""cases involving injunctive relief and those seeking 
monetary damages under the Lanham Act have different standards of proof."" Porous Media Corp., 110 F.3d at 1335. Because 
Yardi does not seek summary adjudication of Entrata's request for injunctive relief, the court only focuses on Yardi's arguments 
related to monetary damages."
1534,3," Entrata agues: ""Yardi's January 2015 Notice claimed that Entrata's custom interface 'is known to use SQL injection and to 
make .dll modifications without notice.' This was untrue."" (ECF No. 596 at 18) (citations omitted).) "
1537,4," Entrata has presented evidence that Yardi's CEO made this statement to a (previously) mutual Entrata/Yardi customer shortly 
after Yardi's November 2015 announcement that it would no longer host custom interfaces. (See ECF No. 597-8 at 72-73.) "
1538,5," In order to answer this question, ""perhaps [the] most significant"" consideration for the fact finder ""is the evidence relating to"" 
Yardi itself, and whether Yardi's conduct ""was justified by any normal business purpose."" Aspen, 472 U.S. at 608. Yardi argues 
that it had multiple rational business purposes to end its relationship with Entrata—among them that Entrata misappropriated 
and lied about possessing a copy of Voyager and also that it was protecting its own intellectual property. Entrata argues that 
Yardi's ""proffered business justifications"" ""are pretextual,"" as evidenced by Yardi's ""shifting"" and ""inconsistent"" positions. (See 
ECF No. 596 at 33.) The court agrees with Entrata that there is evidence that Yardi has offered shifting justifications for its 
conduct. As in Aspen, there is at least some evidence that from which a jury could conclude that Yardi's justifications are invalid. Additionally, in determining whether Yardi's ""refusal to deal was part of a larger anticompetitive enterprise,"" Novell, 731 F.3d at 
1075, ""it is [also] relevant [for the fact finder] to consider the impact on consumers and whether [Yardi] has impaired competition 
in an unnecessarily restrictive way."" See Aspen, 472 U.S at 605. ""If a firm has been attempting to exclude rivals on some basis 
other than efficiency, it is fair to characterize its behavior as predatory."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted). 
""It is, accordingly, appropriate to examine the effect of the challenged conduct on consumers . . . ."" Id. Entrata has offered ample evidence that mutual customers preferred Entrata's integration products and were displeased at being 
forced to choose between Yardi and Entrata—especially because that choice increased costs for some customers. (See e.g, 
ECF No. 597-14 at 40 (An email from a (previously) mutual Yardi/Entrata customer to a Yardi representative provided, in 
relevant part: ""Given our history with Yardi, and the reputation management Marisa has cultivated over the past two decades, 
Sentinel chose to align itself with Yardi at a greater financial cost than we were paying to Entrata. To now tell our executive 
committee that the increased cost comes with decreased functionality is going to damage that reputation within our 
company."" (bold added).)) The effect of Yardi's conduct on consumers, and the evidence that Yardi was willing to damage its own reputation in order to cut 
off Entrata, provides further evidence of Yardi's irrational conduct."

678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). "
1543,2," The Complaint alleges that Align ""improperly"" used 3Shape's customer list in connection with the discount program, but it 
doesn't say what Align did or why it was improper. (Id. ¶ 57.) There are no allegations that Align employed bad faith, deceptive, 
or illegal conduct."
1543,3," The Complaint also contains a request styled as ""Count Three,"" in which 3Shape seeks an anti-suit injunction against Align. 
(D.I. 1 ¶¶ 104-113.) 3Shape does not oppose dismissal of this Count. (D.I. 17 at 3 n.2.) Accordingly, I recommend dismissal of 
Count 3. "
1544,4," ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to

felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, 
$1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."" 15 U.S.C. § 
2. "
1546,5," Nor has 3Shape explained how Align's offers, which 3Shape rejected, could have possibly resulted in any injury to 3Shape. 
See Brunswick Corp., 429 U.S. at 489 (requiring antitrust plaintiffs to prove injury ""that flows from that which makes defendants' 
acts unlawful"")."
1546,6," 3Shape does not argue that Align's ""attempt"" to enter into an exclusive dealing arrangement qualifies as anticompetitive 
conduct that supports 3Shape's claim that Align ""attempted monopolization"" of the scanner market. Which makes sense. For 
one thing, the proposed arrangement would have kept 3Shape on the market. See Oxbow Carbon & Minerals LLC v. Union 
Pacific R. Co., 926 F. Supp. 2d 36, 46 (D.D.C. 2013) (""In enacting the prohibitions on monopolies, Congress was concerned 
about 'the complete domination of a market by a single economic entity,' and therefore did not include 'shared monopolies' or 
oligopolies within the purview of Section 2."" (quoting Sun Dun, Inc. of Washington v. Coca-Cola Co., 740 F. Supp. 381, 391 (D. 
Md. 1990))). Nor did 3Shape suffer any injury as a result of Align's mere proposal. See n.5, supra. "
1548,7," The Complaint does not allege that the design of Align's iTero Element scanner has ever changed. The Court is therefore not 
confronted with an allegation of anticompetitive product redesign. "
1549,8," At oral argument, 3Shape's counsel suggested that Align's scanner discount program operated as a de facto exclusive dealing 
arrangement. (Tr. 25:9-26:22.) According to 3Shape's counsel, the ""target"" number of Invisalign orders was so high that a 
scanner purchaser was essentially unable to order any other types of aligners. The problem with that argument, which counsel 
acknowledged, is that the Complaint does not allege that fact. (Id.) Nor does it allege any facts about the size of the target 
number or, more importantly, its size in relation to a dental professional's total number of aligner orders. "
1551,9," The question of whether non-sham patent litigation can support a claim of an overall scheme to monopolize when the there are 
other alleged instances of anticompetitive conduct does not need to be addressed here, since the Complaint does not allege any 
other anticompetitive conduct. For the same reason, the Court need not answer the related question of whether unilateral 
conduct otherwise insulated from antitrust review can be combined with anticompetitive conduct when analyzing an antitrust

did not have ""sufficient minimum contacts with Iowa to satisfy the requirements of the due process clause of the fourteenth 
amendment."" Health Care Equalization Comm. of the Iowa Chiropractic Soc. v. Iowa Med. Soc., 851 F.2d 1020, 1022-23 (8th

not procure this contract until January 2018. "

a bill and keep peering agreement. Doc. 131 at ¶ 69; Doc. 120 at ¶ 109; Doc. 237, Exs. 118, 119. Although not on bill and keep

1638,1," Diverse Power argued in response to LaGrange's civil appeal statement that the District Court's order denying state-action 
immunity was not an appealable collateral order under Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 
93 L. Ed. 1528 (1949). See Diverse Power's Resp. to Civil App. Statement at 4 (filed April 16, 2018). Specifically, Diverse Power 
suggested that Commuter Transportation Systems, Inc. v. Hillsborough County Aviation Authority—where we initially extended "
1639,," Cohen to denials of state-action immunity—was either ""wrongly decided"" and/or ""abrogated by more recent decisions of the 
Supreme Court emphasizing the narrowness of [the collateral order] doctrine."" Id. We happen to think that Commuter Transportation was correctly decided. For the reasons articulated in that opinion and more, 
we think it's clear that state-action immunity is a form of immunity from suit, not merely from liability. And denials of immunity 
from suit—like denials of sovereign and qualified immunities—are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine. 
P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147, 113 S. Ct. 684, 689, 121 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1993) 
(sovereign immunity); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 536, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 2820, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985) (qualified 
immunity). But even if we agreed with Diverse Power on this point, we'd be powerless to do anything: Commuter Transportation 
is a decision of this Court that has not been overturned en banc. That we haven't overturned Commuter Transportation wouldn't matter if the Supreme Court had abrogated Commuter 
Transportation or another case presenting the same issue. This brings us to Diverse Power's second argument: that Commuter 
Transportation has been abrogated by more recent Supreme Court decisions narrowing the collateral order doctrine. Though 
Diverse Power confidently stated this conclusion in its response, none of the cases it cited has anything to do with the state-
action doctrine. See Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 130 S. Ct. 599, 175 L. Ed. 2d 458 (2009) (attorney-client 
privilege); Will v. Hallock¸ 546 U.S. 345, 126 S. Ct. 952, 163 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2006) (Federal Tort Claims Act's judgment bar); 
Cunningham v. Hamilton County, 527 U.S. 198, 119 S. Ct. 1915, 144 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1999) (order imposing sanctions for 
discovery abuses); Dig. Equip. Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 114 S. Ct. 1992, 128 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1994) (order 
vacating dismissal and rescinding a settlement agreement); P.R. Aqueduct, 506 U.S. 139, 113 S. Ct. 684, 121 L. Ed. 2d 605 
(Eleventh Amendment immunity); Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 108 S. Ct. 1945, 100 L. Ed. 2d 517 (1988) 
(immunity from civil process). So Diverse Power must be inferring from refusals to extend Cohen in completely different areas of substantive law that the 
Supreme Court will eventually declare denials of state-action immunity to be outside of Cohen. Suffice it to say, that's a far cry 
from an abrogation. "
