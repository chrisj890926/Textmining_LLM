22,1," The background facts are drawn from the allegations of the complaint and counter-complaint, which are accepted as true for 
purposes of the motion to dismiss. Reese v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th Cir. 2011). "
31,2," Although the Court has denied Cisco's motion to dismiss the UCL claim under the unlawful prong based on sufficient 
allegations of Lanham Act violations, the Court GRANTS the motion as to Defendants' § 369-b theory. As discussed above, the 
New York law applies only to sales in New York and the UCL applies only to conduct in California. Sullivan v. Oracle Corp., 51 
Cal. 4th 1191, 1209, 127 Cal. Rptr. 3d 185, 254 P.3d 237 (2011). "
45,1," Because this opinion overrules circuit precedent and creates a circuit split, we circulated it under Circuit Rule 40(e) to all 
judges in active service. A majority did not favor rehearing en banc. "
54,2," Shortly before Singer, the Fifth Circuit held that section 13(b)'s preliminary-injunction provision implicitly authorizes asset 
freezes. See FTC v. Sw. Sunsites, Inc., 665 F.2d 711, 718 (5th Cir. 1982). But its holding appeared to preclude the possibility of 
restitution in section 13(b), pointing instead to § 57b for monetary remedies. Id. at 719 (""[T]he exhortation in [Mitchell] to 
preserve the possibility of complete relief ... makes it appropriate to consider that the final, complete relief in this case may entail 
consumer redress through a [§ 57b] proceeding.""). Predictably, no circuit has materially relied on Southwest Sunsites to support 
an implied restitution award. "
55,3," Chief Judge Wood's dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc relies heavily on FTC v. Bronson Partners, LLC, 654 F.3d 359 
(2d Cir. 2011), but there the Second Circuit summarily followed the lead of other circuits in reading section 13(b) to include an 
implied power to order restitution. Id. at 365. The court quickly moved on to, and thoroughly considered, a wholly different 
question: whether the implied restitution remedy is equitable or legal. The lengthy passages quoted in the chief judge's dissent 
relate to that second-order question. Moreover, Bronson rejected the view that the plain meaning of ""injunction"" encompasses 
restitution. Id. at 367 (approving restitution because ""section 13(b) does not limit the district court to awarding only injunctions"") 
(emphasis added). "
60,4," Because we hold that section 13(b) doesn't authorize monetary relief, we have no need to consider Brown's alternative 
arguments that the Commission can't pursue penalties or legal—as distinct from equitable—restitution under section 13(b). See 
FTC v. AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC, 910 F.3d 417, 429 (9th Cir. 2018) (O'Scannlain, J., concurring) (discussing these arguments). 
We also don't need to consider the district court's asset-freeze determinations. "

73,4," The applicable date on which the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs can seek damages varies based on the length of each state's 
statute of limitations. Kansas, Mississippi, New Hampshire, and Tennessee have three-year statutes of limitation. Kan. Stat.

73,5," The eleven states, discussed below in greater detail, are Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, 
New Mexico, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia. While these states all have mandatory harmonization provisions, there are 
differences in the wording of these statutes that the Court will take into consideration when analyzing each state's precedent."
73,6," The four jurisdictions with codified permissive harmonization statutes are Arizona, District of Columbia, New Hampshire, and 
South Dakota."
73,7," Those ten states are California, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Tennessee, and 
Wisconsin. "
75,8," The Court recognizes that the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs did not assert claims under Massachusetts and New Hampshire law 
in their CAC. (See Master Docket Doc. # 105). Rather, these claims were asserted for the first time in the Orr Complaint. (Case 
No. 16-00809-CV-MDGAF, Doc. # 1, p. 40). This indicates that the Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs would only be able to claim 
damages dating back from 2016 within those two states' statute of limitations period. However, for the reasons discussed below, 
this does not impact the outcome as the Court finds that neither state would adopt the continuing violations doctrine. "
77,9," As previously discussed, only these claims remain against Ferrellgas, as the named representative from Maine failed to

90,1," Plaintiffs describe an MLS as ""a database of properties listed for sale in a particular geographic region."" (Doc. #38, p. 3). 
Plaintiffs state that if brokers are members of an MLS, they ""are required to list all properties on the MLS."" (Doc. #38, p. 3)."

101,1," By letter dated May 23, 2019, ICSC again wrote to the Court in response to the May 21 Letter and Edwards Declaration. (See 
""May 23 Letter,"" Dkt. No. 68.) However, because the Court never authorized ICSC to file a reply letter, the Court indicated that it 
would not consider the May 23 Letter, and if it were to do so, that it would provide Caruso an opportunity to respond. (See Dkt. 
No. 69.) The Court did not consider the May 23 Letter with respect to this Order, and thus did not give Caruso an opportunity to 
respond. "
102,2," Of course, the Court notes that another approach to avoiding ""protracted litigation"" is to eschew reflexive and needless motion 
practice and proceed expeditiously to a trial on the merits. "
104,3," The Court notes that, although ICSC limited its arguments described here to Count I, its arguments apply equally to Count II 
because both counts allege Sherman Act Section One violations and require Caruso to demonstrate the existence of an 
agreement or concerted action. "
107,4," ""There are three product markets that are relevant to this case: (a) the market for shopping center trade associations; (b) the

114,1," All of the motions by both Yardi and Entrata are based upon the reports submitted by the experts and their depositions and 
supporting materials. None of the parties requested an evidentiary hearing to proffer the proposed expert testimony or to subject 
their opinions to voir dire examination. Thus, the motions must be based on the disclosures of the proposed opinions in the 
reports in anticipation of what the evidence received at trial will support. Certain assumptions made by the experts may or may 
not be supported by the actual evidence. Thus, a failure in the evidence to support an assumption necessary for an opinion may 
preclude the opinion at the time of trial."
114,2," Dr. Kearl explained that: ""A relevant market is a set of products over which a hypothetical single seller of those products could 
profitably exercise a price increase. If the GUPPI indicates that a merger of two firms—which would then be the single seller of 
the firms' merged products—could profitably increase the price of the products sold by those firms, then the products sold by the 
two merging firms is a relevant antitrust product market."" (ECF No. 461-21 at 44.)"
114,3," ""The rate at which sales lost by one firm go to another firm is known as the 'diversion ratio.'"" (ECF No. 461-21 at 43.) "
115,4," See also ECF No. 526-2 at 162 (Q. ""Okay. When you were doing your GUPPI analysis, and correct me if I'm wrong, you 
assumed that the price of Yardi Voyager would be approximately equal to the price of RealPage, OneSite and MRI residential 
management; is that fair?"" A. ""That's correct."").)"
115,5," Yardi cites Dr. Kearl's deposition testimony, where he provided that ""[i]f we had a homogenous product that a dominant firm 
was pricing at, then the other firms would price under the umbrella—all right?—that that dominant firm sets. The only issue here 
is that these are not homogenous products."""
115,6," ""And two, there's been criticisms of the simple SSNIP test that were evidenced in the revision of the guidelines, the latest 
revision of the guidelines, which I think is 2010, in that if you have heterogenous products and/or heterogenous consumers, the 
SSNIP test may not work as well or may be harder to implement. And that led to a variant of the SSNIP test called the GUPPI."" 
(ECF No. 526-2 at 44.) "
126,1," In Aluminum I, the district court also initially dismissed the complaints of the IPs and the FLPs. Aluminum I, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 121435, 2014 WL 4277510, at *40. "
127,2," Because the FLPs relied on evidence outside the complaints, the district court converted the defendants' motion to dismiss the 
complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c) to a motion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, giving the FLPs and the 
Defendants notice and opportunity to supplement their submissions. MDL Docket Nos. 1059, 1062. "
129,3," Although the district court had converted the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings against the FLPs to a motion for 
summary judgment (because the FLPs referred in their answering papers to factual matters outside the complaint), the district 
court's opinions dismissing the claims relied primarily on the conclusion that the plaintiffs' theory of antitrust injury was legally 
deficient—rather than on the inadequacy of the plaintiffs' evidence. HN4[
] ""Where . . . the burden of persuasion at trial would be on the non-moving party . . . the party moving for summary judgment may satisfy his burden of production under Rule 56 in 
either of two ways: (1) by submitting evidence that negates an essential element of the non-moving party's claim, or (2) by 
demonstrating that the non-moving party's evidence is insufficient to establish an essential element of the non-moving party's 
claim."" Nick's Garage, 875 F.3d at 114 (quoting Farid v. Smith, 850 F.2d 917, 924 (2d Cir. 1988)). Having moved against the 
FLPs for judgment on the pleadings and not for summary judgment (and having made no motion at all against the IPs and 
Reynolds/Southwire), defendants had not undertaken to demonstrate the satisfaction of either option. In ruling on the plaintiffs' 
appeal from the district court's grant of summary judgment against them, we, like the district court, will focus on the sufficiency of 
the plaintiffs' legal theory, rather than on their evidence. "
132,4," Additional evidence underscores the extent to which maximizing profits from premiums was central to the defendants' business 
strategy. For example, an internal overview of J.P. Morgan's physical trading business states: ""Physical Trading is driven by 
anticipation of market structures. Buy metal for low premiums in times of over-supply. Sell metal for high premiums in times of 
scarcity."" Id. at 891. Scott Evans, a Goldman Sachs trader, said in his deposition that ""the key to valuing [a] trade from a mark-
to-market perspective is really the premium . . ."" id. at 830, and that ""the money you earn as a trader is primarily earned around 
the premium, being able to organize logistics, deliveries to customers, financing for those customers at an amount less than the 
premium rebates to you."" Id. at 479. And Patrick Wilson, a Glencore trader, explained at his deposition that ""the idea was always 
to try and buy at a cheaper premium than the premium you sell at. So once you purchase the aluminum at whatever premium it 
is, taking into account the cost associated with moving that from A to B, the payment—the financing costs, any sort of insurance 
costs, you would try and sell it for a premium that would make all that money back and give you a margin as well."" Id. at 434. "
150,1," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposes pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c). Responsibility for the delay in holding a hearing and resolving the present motions lies in large part with the Court, both 
due to health issues arising around the time of the date originally planned for the hearing and due to the Court's docket. The 
Court apologizes to the parties for the delay. "
152,2," OptumInsight's briefs repeatedly distinguish between OptumInsight and Symmetry, arguing that it should not be held 
responsible for the conduct of its ""then-adversary."" See, e.g., Def.'s Merits MSJ at 25 n.6. In the Court's view, for the reasons 
discussed in the Court's previous orders addressing the sufficiency of CCGroup's complaint and waiver of privilege, Symmetry 
and Ingenix are both predecessors to OptumInsight, and the post-merger OptumInsight is as much a successor to Symmetry as 
it is to Ingenix. See Cave Consulting Grp., Inc. v. OptumInsight, Inc., No. 15-cv-03424-JCS, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179966, 2016 
WL 7475820, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 29, 2016); Cave Consulting Grp., Inc. v. OptumInsight, Inc., No. 15-cv-03424-JCS, 2016

152,3," For subsequent references, this order uses the final three digits of each patent at issue—e.g., the ""'897 patent."" "
153,4," As discussed further below, previous litigation between the parties included claims related to five of the Dang Patents. This 
order uses the term ""Dang Patents"" in some instances to refer only to those five patents, with the intent that context should 
make clear whether those five patents or all eight patents are the subject of discussion. "

(N.D. Cal. Dec. 29, 2016). "
156,8," The Court also notes that CCGroup's counsel has shied away from implicating the physician efficiency market in past phases of 
this case. At a hearing on a discovery dispute, addressing whether any recovery in this case might be duplicative of CCGroup's 
ongoing royalties awarded (but since vacated) in Cave I, counsel acknowledged that a royalty rate could constitute double 
recovery, but asserted that ""the product that was the issue in that case is a physician efficiency scoring product,"" while ""[t]he 
issue in this case involves the grouping product."" Apr. 27, 2017 Hearing Tr. (dkt. 193) at 7:21-23; see also id. at 8:8-10 (""There "
157,," were grouper patents going our way, and we defeated those. That's the product and the technology at issue in this current 
case."")."
157,9," It is not clear from Dr. Sullivan's report how OptumInsight determined this number, the degree of OptumInsight's confidence in 
it, or whether it is in fact reliable. "
158,10," If, as Dr. Sullivan concludes, CCGroup's market share increased in the years after 2011, then his model's use of 2011 
numbers would tend to overestimate the VARs' share for those years, and would also overstate damages for those years. See 
Sullivan Report attach. E-9. "
159,11," As discussed above, Dr. Sullivan calculated this number based on OptumInsight's physician efficiency revenue in 2011 and its 
estimate of its own market share for that year."
159,12," Dr. Sullivan uses ""but-for"" revenue in the grouper market. See Sullivan Report attachs. D-6, E-3. The Court assumes for the 
sake of argument and for the purpose of this analysis that Dr. Sullivan's determination of the size of the grouper market rests on 
sufficient evidence and reliable principles."
159,13," Many of the assumptions in Dr. Sullivan's analysis fill gaps resulting from CCGroup's failure in discovery to develop a factual 
record of the nature of the market. HN4[
] While CCGroup is correct that ""a defendant whose wrongful conduct has rendered 
difficult the ascertainment of the precise damages suffered by the plaintiff, is not entitled to complain that they cannot be 
measured with the same exactness and precision as would otherwise be possible,"" see Eastman Kodak Co. of N.Y. v. S. Photo 
Materials Co., 273 U.S. 359, 379, 47 S. Ct. 400, 71 L. Ed. 684 (1927), no purported wrongdoing by OptumInsight prevented 
CCGroup from taking discovery from other market participants regarding their actual revenue and market share for the products 
at issue. Regardless, ""even where the defendant by his own wrong has prevented a more precise computation, the jury may not 
render a verdict based on speculation or guesswork."" Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, 327 U.S. 251, 264, 66 S. Ct. 574, 90 L. 
Ed. 652 (1946). "
160,14," OptumInsight's rebuttal expert Dr. Paul Godek criticizes Dr. Sullivan's reliance on accounting profit margins, which Dr. Godek 
contends are widely recognized by economists as not reflecting true economic costs of production and thus are not a valid basis 
for establishing the existence of market power. Godek Report ¶¶ 26-34. OptumInsight's motion, however, does not argue that 
Dr. Sullivan's use of accounting profits is a reason to exclude his testimony, and the Court declines to reach an issue not raised 
in the motion. See Defs.' Mot. to Exclude at 4-14. "
161,15," OptumInsight also argues that Dr. Sullivan cannot show damages to CCGroup in the grouper market because CCGroup would 
have benefited from the purportedly monopolistic price increase that Dr. Sullivan identifies in that market. See Def.'s Mot. to 
Exclude at 9-10. Because a jury could credit Dr. Cave's testimony that CCGroup avoided this market as a result of 
OptumInsight's practices at issue, and because Dr. Sullivan has sufficient grounds for his conclusion that OptumInsight 
dominated the market due to its patents, CCGroup's and Dr. Sullivan's theory of antitrust injury is not undermined by artificially 
inflated prices in a market in which CCGroup was not able to compete for customers."
161,16," Even if Dr. Sullivan were to estimate damages based on CCGroup's actual performance in the physician efficiency market, 
rather than a benchmark share of the market—an alternative that neither Dr. Sullivan's report nor CCGroup's briefs suggest—the 
analysis would still rest on the assumption that OptumInsight's estimate of its market share in a single year can be used to 
calculate the total value of the physician efficiency market for each year over a period of fifteen years. CCGroup has not shown 
that such an assumption is founded on any accepted economic principle or method."
161,17," Among other issues related to this aspect of Dr. Sullivan's analysis, the Court has concerns about the apparent tension 
between, on one hand, Dr. Sullivan's premise that the competitive physician efficiency market and the standalone grouper 
market are sufficiently similar to support a yardstick analysis, and on the other hand, Dr. Sullivan's assumption that no other 
competitors besides CCGroup and OptumInsight would enter a hypothetical competitive standalone grouper market in the 
absence of OptumInsight's purportedly wrongful conduct. "
163,18," Paragraphs 89 through 92, the only portion of Wilson's report cited in OptumInsight's argument regarding factual opinions, 
include no reference to the reexamination proceeding. "
166,19," It is difficult to understand how or why OptumInsight contends, for example, that the assertion that ""Symmetry lawyers were 
confused"" is ""not an opinion on states of mind."" See Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. to Exclude at 12. This is but one example of both parties 
overextending their positions to the point of absurdity. Such arguments only serve to further complicate a case that would be 
exceedingly complex even if the parties had been able to work in good faith to narrow the issues in dispute. "
168,20," This ruling is not intended to bar any expert from asserting flaws in another expert's reasoning based on the latter expert's 
failure to consider information or conduct analysis that the former expert believes is relevant to the latter expert's conclusion. 
Such testimony is permissible. What witnesses may not do is simply list topics on which the opposing party declined to offer 
expert opinions. "
172,21," CCGroup disputes OptumInsight's characterization of the cases OptumInsight cites for this proposition. Because there is no 
argument or evidence to support any reasonable construction of ""dynamic time windows"" broader than Judge Davila's 
construction under Phillips, the Court need not resolve the issue. "
177,22," CCGroup seeks leave to file a surreply arguing that the opinions of OptumInsight's expert witness Michael Dergosits, whose 
rebuttal report OptumInsight properly served after the deadline for CCGroup's opposition brief on limitations issues, support 
CCGroup's position regarding lack of constructive notice. OptumInsight opposes that request and, in the alternative if the Court 
were to allow the surreply, requests leave to file a short response. Because, as discussed below, the Court need not rely on the 
surreply to deny OptumInsight's motion with respect to fraudulent concealment, CCGroup's request to file the surreply is 
DENIED AS MOOT. "
178,23," The Court uses the term ""OptumInsight"" here to include not only the company in its current form, but also its predecessors 
Ingenix and Symmetry. For the reasons stated in the Court's previous orders and the Federal Circuit's decision on appeal, 
OptumInsight stands in the shoes of both Ingenix and Symmetry for all relevant purposes. See Order re 2d MTD at 27-28; Am. 
Order re Mot. to Compel at 18-19; In Re: OptumInsight, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 13483, 2017 WL 3096300, at *3 (noting with 
approval ""the widely accepted notion that that a successor company ordinarily stands in the shoes of the previously merged 
corporations""). "
179,24," Less than two years after it was decided, Santa Maria was overruled on other grounds by the en banc court in Socop-
Gonzalez, which rejected its approach of requiring a plaintiff to file within a reasonable time after a tolling period ended rather 
than allowing any remaining time in the statute of limitations to run from that point. Socop-Gonzalez, 272 F.3d at 1195-96. "
182,25," OptumInsight argues separately that it is entitled to summary judgment on CCGroup's fraudulent concealment argument 
because CCGroup was not diligent in investigating the validity of the patents at issue. Limitations MSJ at 24-25; Limitations 
Reply at 11-12. HN29[
] In the context of fraudulent concealment, diligence is merely a component of constructive knowledge, 
and is only required where a plaintiff ""'had enough information to warrant an investigation which, if reasonably diligent, would 
have led to the discovery of the fraud.'"" See Hexcel at 1060 (quoting Beneficial Standard, 851 F.2d at 275) (emphasis added). 
As discussed above, questions of fact remain as to whether CCGroup had such information before the limitations period and 
whether a diligent investigation would have revealed the basis for its claims."
182,26," Because the Court concludes that OptumInsight is not entitled to summary judgment on the issue of fraudulent concealment, 
the Court need not resolve on this motion whether, if CCGroup fails to prevail on that issue at trial, any antitrust claim would 
remain for acts occurring within four years before CCGroup brought this action."
182,27," The Federal Circuit issued its opinion in the Cave I appeal on March 21, 2018, and after denying a petition for rehearing en 
banc, issued its mandate in favor of OptumInsight on August 22, 2018. The Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari on 
January 7, 2019. "
183,28," The court in Lee disapproved of the Roger Cleveland [*113]  decision to the extent that it limited section 340.6(a) to ""a 
professional negligence statute"" and declined to apply it to a claim brought by someone other than the client of a defendant 
attorney, but Lee does not indicate that the Roger Cleveland court was wrong to apply section 335.1 to a claim by a corporate 
plaintiff, or that section 340.6(a) applies to claims against non-attorney defendants. See Lee, 61 Cal. 4th at 1233-39. "
185,29," OptumInsight argues that the standard for showing fraud on the PTO in a Walker Process claim is distinct from the 
Therasense inequitable conduct standard, and that a showing of egregious misconduct cannot substitute for a showing of but-for 
materiality in the context of Walker Process. Opp'n to Pl.'s MSJ at 8. The Federal Circuit has not yet resolved whether the 
standards are identical, and the parties have not identified a case explicitly considering this question that turned on its answer. 
See TransWeb, 812 F.3d at 1307 (""After Therasense, the showing required for proving inequitable conduct and the showing 
required for proving the fraud component of Walker Process liability may be nearly identical."" (emphasis added)). Before 
Therasense, a ""finding of Walker Process fraud require[d] higher threshold showings of both intent and materiality than does a 
finding of inequitable conduct."" Nobelpharma, 141 F.3d at 1070-71. Since that decision, however, both inequitable conduct and 
Walker Process require a showing of but-for materiality. See id.; Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1291. The Therasense court's 
rationale for considering affirmative egregious misconduct inherently material—including the inference that parties would not 
engage in such conduct if it were not material, and precedent holding ""'there is no room to argue that submission of false 
affidavits is not material'""—would seem to apply equally in the Walker Process context. See Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1292-93 
(quoting Rohm & Haas Co. v. Crystal Chem. Co., 722 F.2d 1556, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1983)). As discussed below, CCGroup has not 
established beyond any question of material fact that OptumInsight engaged in affirmative egregious misconduct, and CCGroup 
is therefore not entitled to summary judgment regardless of whether such misconduct would in itself satisfy the standard for 
materiality. "
186,30," A jury might also interpret Dang's demeanor when pressed about the discrepancies between the positions taken in the 
reexamination and his testimony in Cave I as suggesting an effort to rationalize earlier positions that he was not comfortable fully 
defending. Lancaster Opp'n Decl. Ex. 10A (videos of Dang's deposition testimony, particularly the video file ""DD-P115, 
L19.mp4,"" corresponding to testimony at 115:19-120:10 of Exhibit 10). "
188,31," On this issue in particular, Rosenbaum's affidavit at best walks a very fine line. Rosenbaum's 1999 meeting notes indicate 
that, with respect to the RFP response: ""- opportunity came about b/c [illegible, possibly [*127]  'of'] Aetna provided DATATA [sic] - to support development"" Howenstine Decl. re Pl.'s MSJ Ex. 46. Nevertheless, the meeting notes do not reflect the entirety of the information Rosenbaum 
claimed to have first learned in 2000, because the notes do not include the dates that data was shared, which arguably would 
have been particularly relevant to a reexamination considering, among other things, the timeline of Dang's conception as 
compared to the RFP response. "
191,32," In the time since briefing on the present motions closed, the Federal Circuit reversed aspects of the Cave I verdict unrelated to 
this case and remanded to the district court. Judge Davila entered a new judgment in the case consistent with the Federal 
Circuit's holding, and also included judgment in favor of OptumInsight on CCGroup's declaratory judgment claim—reflecting 
issues decided before the appeal but not included in the original judgment. CCGroup filed a motion to alter judgment and a 
notice of appeal, and this Court requested supplemental briefing on any preclusive effect of the amended judgment. 
OptumInsight declined to oppose CCGroup's motion to alter judgment, having concluded that the issue did not warrant the 
resources necessary to contest it, and elected to base its arguments regarding preclusion on only the original form of judgment 
in Cave I. See Def.'s Response to June 18, 2019 Order (dkt. 348). "
192,33," OptumInsight did not seek summary judgment on the validity of the Seare '079 patent. The Court considered at the hearing 
whether OptumInsight might nevertheless be entitled to judgment based on CCGroup's failure to present evidence of Seare's "
193,," conception date. A jury might reasonably conclude from this record that McMahon lacked a reasonable basis for his 
representation to the PTO if the jury agrees with CCGroup that Dang conceived his invention in 1993 or early 1994, and if 
McMahon had no evidence to suggest a conception date for the '079 patent earlier than Seare's filing date. The Court declines 
to grant summary judgment for OptumInsight on this issue. "
194,34," Much of this declaration reads like a supplemental brief summarizing case law, and is therefore improper. The Court 
nevertheless considers the declaration in resolving this issue. "
195,35," Because the market is defined as only including ""full scope"" groupers, 3M's hospital-carespecific grouper does not fall within 
the relevant market."
195,36," ""Q: [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] A: Not to my knowledge."" (In context, Zielinski's response indicates she is not aware 
of [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT], not that she believes the questioner's premise to be incorrect.)"
195,37," OptumInsight does not challenge whether CCGroup had sufficient ""intention and preparedness"" to enter the standalone 
grouper market based on the factors used by the Ninth Circuit to assess whether potential competitors thwarted from entering a 
market have suffered antitrust injury. See Dual-Deck Video, 11 F.3d at 1465. CCGroup's development of a grouper product and 
separate licensing of that product in at least some isolated circumstances shows that CCGroup had the capacity to compete in 
the market, if not that CCGroup actually competed in it. See, e.g., Howenstine Decl. re Opp'n to OptumInsight's Merits Mot. (dkt. 
318-1) Ex. 26 at CCG0010309 (""CHP has elected to License only the Cave GrouperTM module for this Amendment 3.""). "
197,38," Even this statement is arguably consistent with Dr. Cave's testimony, to the extent that Cave might have preferred that 
CCGroup serve as ""an 'add on' company"" at least in part because he believed competing as ""a vendor replacement company"" 
would increase the risk of OptumInsight seeking to enforce its patents against CCGroup."
197,39," Two other arguments by OptumInsight on the issue of antitrust injury warrant only a cursory response. First, OptumInsight 
argues in its motion, but does not pursue in its reply, that judicial estoppel should preclude CCGroup from showing antitrust 
injury because, according to OptumInsight, CCGroup's theory relies on positions contrary to those it has taken in past litigation. 
See Def.'s Merits MSJ at 36-37. HN52[
] The Ninth Circuit ""has restricted the application of judicial estoppel to cases where 
the court relied on, or 'accepted,' the party's previous inconsistent position,"" and OptumInsight makes no showing that any court 
relied on CCGroup's purportedly inconsistent prior positions. See Hamilton v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 270 F.3d 778, 783 
(9th Cir. 2001). Second, OptumInsight contends that its decision to license its patents to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services (""CMS"") at no charge in 2010 to develop a public grouper (the development of which was called for by the Affordable 
Care Act) establishes that OptumInsight lacked intent to monopolize the grouper market. Def.'s Merits MSJ at 37. It is not self-
evident that allowing the government to develop its own grouper to administer public benefits programs negates the possibility of "
198,," intent to monopolize the market for licensing such products to insurers and other private entities such that OptumInsight should 
be entitled to summary judgment on the issue. The significance, if any, of OptumInsight's decision to license its patents to CMS 
is for the jury to decide."
198,40," At the hearing, OptumInsight cited testimony by Dr. Cave that his work related to the '164 patent put him on notice of the 
patents at issue and the purported litigiousness of the industry. Such testimony does not establish that Dr. Cave chose to avoid 
the standalone grouper market for fear that his product infringed (or would be accused on infringing) that patent in particular. "
199,41," The Court previously held that OptumInsight stands in the shoes of its predecessor Symmetry in this respect, and the analysis 
here assumes for the moment that CCGroup can show that the patents at issue were obtained through fraud. "
200,42," Perhaps recognizing this, OptumInsight has not itself cited Dippin' Dots in support of its argument on the issue of scienter. See 
OptumInsight Merits Mot. at 5-10."
200,43," The Supreme Court reversed because the ""respondent failed to renew its preverdict motion as specified in Rule 50(b)."" 
Unitherm Food Sys. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., 546 U.S. 394, 407, 126 S. Ct. 980, 163 L. Ed. 2d 974 (2006). "
201,44," One perhaps distinguishing factor of Unitherm, as compared to other cases considering Walker Process, is that the patentee's 
enforcement efforts consisted of notifying others in the industry that the patentee ""intend[ed] to aggressively protect all of [its] 
rights under [the] patent"" at issue and soliciting licensing fees—not actual litigation. See id. at 1344. "
203,45," The parties do not address in any detail the standard for imputing an employee's knowledge to a corporation in the context of 
a sham litigation claim. HN58[
] As a general rule, an agent's knowledge will be imputed to the principal, so long as the knowledge is material to the agent's duties. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 5.03 (Am. Law Inst. 2006); see, e.g., United States 
v. Pac. Gas & Elec. Co., No. 14-cr-00175-TEH, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 171577, 2015 WL 9460313, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 
2015) (addressing case law applying a ""collective knowledge"" standard based on the Restatement in the context of corporate 
criminal liability). OptumInsight has not argued that any relevant knowledge that Gardiner might have had was immaterial to his 
duties."
203,46," OptumInsight argues that Therasense bars such inferences. Reply re Def.'s Merits MSJ at 5. The Federal Circuit held in 
Therasense that negligence was not sufficient to show intent to deceive the PTO for the purpose of establishing inequitable 
conduct. See 649 F.3d at 1290-91. That case acknowledges that intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, does not 
address knowledge of the infirmity of a previous litigation claim in the context of a sham litigation claim, and, as far as this Court 
is aware, has not been cited by the Ninth Circuit for any purpose. Therasense does not set the standard for whether 
OptumInsight was aware that its judicial counterclaims in Cave I lacked merit. "
204,47," The parties agree that CCGroup's malicious prosecution claim is governed by California law. See, e.g., Def.'s Merits MSJ at 
25. "
207,1," Disclaimer: Documents filed in CM/ECF may contain hyperlinks to other documents or websites. These hyperlinks are provided

their websites. The Court accepts no responsibility for the availability or functionality of any hyperlink. Thus, the fact that a 
hyperlink stops working or directs the user to some other site does not affect the opinion of the Court. "
208,2," The parties also discuss how sovereign immunity can be waived. And the law is well-settled that Florida has retained its 
sovereign immunity for FMLA claims. See e.g., Fla. Stat. § 768.28 (waiving Florida's sovereign immunity from tort actions 
brought in its own courts—but not federal courts—with certain limitations); Hamm v. Powell, 874 F.2d 766, 770 n.3 (11th Cir. 
1989) (holding § 768.28 does not waive Florida's Eleventh Amendment immunity). Nor has Congress abrogated immunity for 
claims under the FMLA's self-care provisions, like at issue here. See Coleman v. Court of Appeals of Maryland, 566 U.S. 30, 43, 
132 S. Ct. 1327, 182 L. Ed. 2d 296 (2012) (holding Congress did not abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity from 
suit under the FMLA's self-care provision); Cotora v. Lee Cty., No. 2:10-cv-775-FTM29, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101642, 2012 WL "
209,2996550," , at *3 (M.D. Fla. July 23, 2012) (dismissing a plaintiff's FMLA self-care retaliation claim because of sovereign 
immunity). "
210,3," Under Florida's Uniform Special District Accountability Act, special districts are ""units of local government created for a special 
purpose."" Fla. Stat. § 189.012(6) (2014). And Florida law includes special districts in the meaning of political subdivisions. Fla. 
Stat. § 1.01(8) (2014). "
211,4," Fonte argues LMHS cannot claim Eleventh Amendment immunity when it did not raise sovereign immunity in other federal 
cases involving FMLA claims, and it wants the Court to take judicial notice of documents in those cases. (Doc. 20 at 13-14). The 
Court need not address this argument because it denies LMHS sovereign immunity on the merits. "

filed solely for the purpose of adding Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as a defendant. It is otherwise substantively identical to the

addresses the Second Amended Complaint."

placement they receive on a search engine's results page."")."
237,4," Regarding ""keyword search auctions,"" Plaintiffs allege, among other things, as follows. Search engines calculate an ad's quality 
score by evaluating multiple components of that advertisement, including the advertiser's historical clickthrough rate, keyword 
and advertisement relevance, the quality and relevance of the advertiser's landing page, and the advertiser's historical account 
performance. Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 54-55 (alleging the higher an ad's quality score, the lower the advertiser will have to bid to win 
a keyword auction and further alleging ""even temporary absence from keyword auctions can dramatically increase an 
advertiser's bidding costs by lowering its quality score""). According to Plaintiffs, keyword search auctions are sealed, and 
advertisers do not know what other advertisers are bidding when they submit bids to search engines. Id., ¶ 58 (""Nonetheless, 
because keyword auctions are competitive, the price per click for keyword advertisements is often high, especially compared 
with other forms of online advertising. These higher prices reflect the high value of keyword search advertising."")."
237,5," ""Furthermore, according to one 2014 Google study of hotel shoppers provided to TravelPass, as of the second quarter of 2014, 
keyword searching was the number one starting point for consumers looking to book a hotel room online. Indeed, as of early 
2014, search volume for hotel room shoppers was on the rise, having increased by almost 20% over the previous year."" Docket 
Entry # 1, ¶ 61. ""This Google study also found that, as of early 2014, customers who search for one specific hotel brand online, e.g., Hilton, 
would often end up purchasing a hotel room with another brand, e.g., Marriott. For example, 22% of consumers searching for 
Hilton-branded hotels ended up booking with a Marriott-branded hotel instead."" Id., ¶ 63 (""This is the essence of robust

associations, and industry consultants.""). "
239,7," According to the complaint, as early as May 2014, one Gatekeeper OTA's account manager admitted in emails sent to certain 
Downstream OTAs that the conspiracy's goal was to ""level the playing field"" by ""ensuring that [the Defendant Hotels] are not 
employing similar branded keyword bidding strategies to bid on other chains e.g., Marriott bidding on Hilton."" Docket Entry # 1,

conspiracy to eliminate interbrand competition at the hotel level."" Id., ¶ 95; see also id. at ¶¶ 96-102."
239,8," Specifically, Plaintiffs allege as follows: Viewed in isolation, no individual Hotel Defendant had an independent economic incentive to cease bidding on its 
competitors' branded keywords. By the time the conspiracy was underway, branded trademark owners' spurious claims that 
competitor bidding on branded keywords violated federal trademark law had been thoroughly rejected by the courts. As a 
result, none of the Defendant [*15]  Hotels had an independent incentive to refrain from bidding on its competitors' branded 
terms because they were legitimately concerned about infringement claims. Docket Entry # 1, ¶ 13. "

244,13," Even though ""antitrust standing"" supplements Article III standing requirements (as set forth below), the Fifth Circuit has 
described the question as a preliminary one, to be answered from examination of the allegations of the complaint. Impala African 
Safaris, LLC v. Dallas Safari Club, Inc., No. 3:13-CV-2175-G, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126789, 2014 WL 4555659, at *4 (N.D.

merits of this antitrust case involving the insurance market for veterinarians, we are faced with two difficult threshold 
determinations,"" one of which was antitrust standing) (emphasis added). Because courts sometimes confuse the issues of whether the alleged conduct violates the antitrust laws with that of whether a 
plaintiff has antitrust standing, some courts assume a violation and then examine whether the plaintiff has antitrust standing to 
recover damages based on the violation. John J. Miles, 1 Health Care and Antitrust Law § 9:7 (2019) & n. 8 (2019) (citing 
Gelboim v. Bank of America Corp., 823 F.3d 759, 770 (2d Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 2017 WL 160462 (U.S. 2017) (""The interplay 
between [antitrust standing and antitrust violation] has engendered substantial confusion. To avoid that quagmire, the Court 
(among others) assumes the existence of a violation in addressing the issue of [antitrust] standing. . . . Although we would not 
ordinarily consider whether the complaints state an antitrust violation when assessing antitrust standing, it is easy to blur the 
distinction between an antitrust violation and an antitrust injury, as the district court did; so we will examine both for purposes of 
judicial economy.""); see also Sanger, 802 F.3d at 738 (citing Doctor's Hosp., 123 F.3d at 306 (""Standing analysis can be most 
helpful in the atypical antitrust case if the court assumes an antitrust violation has occurred and then determines whether the

Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, ¶ 335f, at 91 (4th ed.2014) (""[T]he court should assume the existence of a violation and

245,14," Antitrust standing is distinct from the standing doctrine that traces to Article III of the United States Constitution. Anderson v. 
21st Mortg. Corp., No. 7:15-CV-00200-KC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224102, 2017 WL 11037113, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 10, 2017) 
(citing In re Online DVD-Rental Antitrust Litig., 779 F.3d 914, 922 (9th Cir. 2015)). Article III standing is a threshold jurisdictional 
requirement for civil actions in federal court and is rooted in the bedrock constitutional principle that the judiciary's power extends 
only to cases and controversies. Anderson, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 224102, 2017 WL 11037113, at *3 (citing U.S. Const. art. III, 
§ 2; also citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct. 2130, 119 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1992)). By contrast, 
antitrust standing is a requirement for plaintiffs seeking damages under the antitrust laws. Anderson, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
224102, 2017 WL 11037113, at *3 (citations omitted). "
246,15," Specifically, the Court in AGC ""relied on other factors—the remoteness of injury, the existence of parties more directly harmed, 
and the risk of duplicative or complicated suits—in concluding that construction unions were not 'proper plaintiffs' to sue a group 
of contractors who, the unions alleged, had coerced landowners and other contractors to hire non-union subcontractors and 
thereby injured the unions."" McCormack, 845 F.2d at 1342 (citing AGC, 459 U.S. at 538-45). The alleged violations in AGC ""did 
not affect the unions directly, and the Supreme Court concluded that the connection between the violations and any injuries to 
the unions was too speculative and would render damage calculations too difficult."" McCormack, 845 F.2d at 1342 (citing AGC, 
459 U.S. at 542, 545). Because of ""[t]he existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-interest would normally motivate 
them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement,"" the Supreme Court found that the justification for allowing a more 
remote party (i.e. one who suffered an indirect injury) privately to enforce the antitrust laws was diminished."" Todorov, 921 F.2d 
at 1451 (quoting AGC, 459 U.S. at 542). Indeed, ""[d]enying the [u]nion[s] a remedy . . . [wa]s not likely to leave a significant 
antitrust violation undetected or unremedied."" Id."
246,16," The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals noted in Todorov, supra, the Supreme Court's approach in AGC, where the antitrust 
injury issue was dispositive of the case, has ""bred much confusion in the lower federal courts."" Todorov, 921 F.2d at 1451 n. 20 
(further noting because ""the Court went on to discuss other factors [it] suggested that antitrust injury was not a separate 
threshold question, but was, instead, one of several factors to be balanced when determining antitrust standing;"" and finally 
noting the Supreme Court in Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort, Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 107 S.Ct. 484, 93 L.Ed.2d 427 (1986) clarified that 
antitrust injury is a necessary component of antitrust standing)). "
247,17," For example, in the Seventh Circuit, a plaintiff must establish two elements: (1) she has suffered an antitrust injury (i.e., that 
her claimed injuries are of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and reflect the anticompetitive effect of either the 
violation or of anticompetitve acts made possible by the violation); and (2) she has antitrust standing (i.e., that the alleged harm 
proximately caused her injury). Tichy v. Hyatt Hotels Corp., 376 F. Supp. 3d 821, 842 (N.D. Ill. 2019)."
247,18," In Waggoner v. Denbury Onshore, L.L.C., 612 Fed. Appx. 734, (5th Cir. 2015), the principal issue before the court was the 
second requirement, antitrust injury. Id. at 736. According to the Fifth Circuit, both the district court and Waggoner's brief quoted 
the following from Bell v. Dow Chemical Co., 847 F.2d 1179, 1183 (5th Cir.1988): ""In making the determination, courts may 
assess several factors: 1) the nature of plaintiff's alleged injury; 2) the directness of the injury; 3) the speculative measure of the 
harm; 4) the risk of duplicative recovery; and 5) the complexity in apportioning damages."" 612 Fed. Appx. at 737, n. 4. The Fifth 
Circuit stated that while these AGC factors referenced in Dow ""are indeed appropriate in the overall standing inquiry [i.e. proper 
plaintiff status element], the antitrust-injury standing requirement is analogous to the first Dow factor: the nature of the plaintiff's 
injury. This is evident from Dow's citation to Brunswick for the proposition that, ""[r]egarding the first factor, plaintiff's injury must 
be the type that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent."" Id. (emphasis in original). "

market""); also citing Serpa Corp. v. McWane, Inc., 199 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 1999)). "
253,22," The court in Vaughn further suggested that the Fifth Circuit in Norris was ""commenting less on the dynamics of anticompetitive 
conduct and more on which parties are most likely to bring suit under the federal antitrust laws. Thus, it was focused on the third 
element"" — the issue of whether the plaintiff is a proper party to the antitrust claim. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88958, 2010 WL 
3488244, at *12."
253,23," Defendants assert TravelPass did not provide customers with competitive information that reduces their transaction costs 
when it bid on Defendants' branded keywords; rather, it deceived consumers through its use of hotel brand names in search 
engine advertisements, thereby misleading consumers to believe that the source of a particular listing was the hotel itself. In 
support of this argument, Defendants rely on a December 2017 complaint filed by the Federal Trade Commission (""FTC"") 
against TravelPass. See Docket Entry # 53 at p. 11; see also id. at p. 6 (citing Compl., Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Reservation 
Counter, LLC, TravelPass Group, LLC, and Partner Fusion, Inc., No. 2:17-cv-01301, Dkt. No. 2 (D. Utah Dec. 26, 2017), 
attached to the joint motion as Exhibit 3). According to Defendants, the FTC's complaint against TravelPass, and the subsequent consent decree, are both matters of 
public record and, thus, properly considered on a motion to dismiss. Docket Entry # 53 at p. 6, n. 7 (citing Paternostro v. Custer, 
No. 4:15CV71-RC-CMC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35254, 2016 WL 11473560, at *4 n.1 (E.D. Tex. Feb. 16, 2016) (""While "
254,," reviewing a motion to dismiss, courts may take judicial notice of court pleadings in other cases, because pleadings are public 
records."")). Although the Court may consider documents attached to or incorporated by reference into the complaint and also matters of 
public record, the Court does not do so here because it would not aid in the analysis of the pertinent issues."
254,24," Plaintiffs further explain that when TravelPass sells a Hilton room, it stands in a vertical relationship with Hilton only, but ""in 
that moment, it is simultaneously a horizontal competitor of every other brand."" Docket Entry # 79 at p. 20. According to 
Defendants' reply, TravelPass's ""undisputed business practices illustrate the fallacy of that argument."" Docket Entry # 97 at p. 4. "
255,25," The Court would further note the Fifth Circuit stated in Sanger that antitrust standing, like other issues, ""may present disputed 
issues of fact which must be resolved at the summary judgment stage in favor of the nonmoving party. . . ."" 802 F.3d at 738 
(citations omitted). According to the court in Biovail, ""the existence of an 'antitrust injury' is not typically resolved through a 
motion to dismiss."" Biovail, 49 F. Supp. 2d at 773 (quoting Brader v. Allegheny General Hospital, 64 F.3d 869, 876 (3d 
Cir.1995)) (noting the adequacy of a physician's contentions regarding the effect on competition is typically resolved after 
discovery, either on summary judgment or after trial and further noting even in antitrust cases that do not involve physicians 
suggest the existence of an antitrust injury is not typically resolved through motions to dismiss). ""Circumstances may, however, 
warrant dismissing antitrust claims on a motion to dismiss, particularly after Iqbal and Twombly, when the allegations do not 
show antitrust injury or one of the other elements of a Section 1 claim."" Natkin v. Am. Osteopathic Ass'n, No. 3:16-CV-01494-

256,26," The Fifth Circuit further explained that parties with antitrust injury are typically either competitors, purchasers, or consumers in 
the relevant market but also noted ""standing is not necessarily limited to this group."" 612 Fed. Appx. at 737 (citing McCready, 
457 U.S. at 472) (""As we have recognized, '[§ 4 of the Clayton Act] does not confine its protection to consumers, or to

258,27," The court in Tichy noted the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that ""antitrust standing"" (which as noted above is 
the second element of the Seventh Circuit's two-part ""antitrust standing"" test) refers to ""proximate causation."" Tichy, 376 F. 
Supp. 3d at 842, n. 6 (citing Supreme Auto Transport, LLC v. Arcelor Mittal USA, Inc., 902 F.3d 735, 743 (7th Cir. 2018)). 
According to the Tichy court, the Seventh Circuit ""eschew[ed] the term 'antitrust standing'"" and instead referred only to 
requirements plaintiffs had to meet to prevail under the statutes at issue. Id. In the Seventh Circuit, in considering whether a plaintiff has ""standing"" under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, courts consider 
certain AGC factors such as ""the potential for duplicative recovery, the complexity of apportioning damages, and the existence of 
other parties that have been more directly harmed."" Greater Rockford Energy and Tech. Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., 998 F.2d 391, 
396 (7th Cir. 1993) (quoting Cargill, 479 U.S. at 111 n. 6, 107 S.Ct. at 490 n. 6 (citing AGC, 459 U.S. at 544-45)). "
260,28," The court In re Online Travel Co. (OTC) Hotel Booking Antitrust Litig., 997 F. Supp. 2d 526 (N.D. Tex. 2014) explained that 
courts sometimes refer to these ""factual enhancements"" as ""plus factors,"" defined as ""facts that tend to ensure that courts 
punish concerted action—an actual agreement—instead of the unilateral, independent conduct of competitors."" Id. at 536, n. 13 
(quoting In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 323 (3d Cir.2010) (brackets and quotations omitted)). According to 
the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, although courts have referenced ""plus factors"" in analyzing the plausibility of Section 1 claims 
at the pleadings stage, ""those references have invariably been drawn from cases evaluating the merits of an antitrust plaintiff's 
conspiracy claim at the summary judgment and trial stages of litigation, when there is significantly more information available 
regarding whether complex analyses of pricing structures and other information suggest agreement."" Evergreen Partnering Grp., 
Inc. v. Pactiv Corp., 720 F.3d 33, 46 (1st Cir. 2013) (citing In re Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 321-22 (relying on In re Flat Glass 
Antitrust Litig, 385 F.3d 350, 359-60 (3d Cir. 2004), which explains that ""plus factors"" are ""proxies for direct evidence of an 
agreement"")). To avoid confusion, the court in In re OTC followed Twombly's language by using ""factual enhancements."" 997 F. Supp. 2d at 
536, n. 13. "
263,29," At the April 17, 2019 hearing, Defendants' counsel argued that unlike Seventh Circuit law that allows ""these sort of equally 
consistent inferences"" to go forward, Fifth Circuit law is different. Hearing Tr. (Docket Entry # 123) at p. 69:21-70:5 (mentioning 
Marucci Sports). According to counsel, in the Fifth Circuit ""when there are these kinds of conclusory allegations that are subject 
to many inferences, that's not sufficient at Rule 12."" Id. at 70:6-8. However, the court in Tichy found the defendants' alternative explanations unconvincing. It was only in assuming the defendants' 
alternative explanations were plausible that the Tichy court stated they would ""not negate the plausibility of Plaintiff's competing 
explanation"" and further referenced the Seventh Circuit law that, at the pleading stage, the court is not ""to stack up inferences 
side by side and allow the case to go forward only if the plaintiff's inferences seem more compelling than the opposing inferences."" Additionally, as explained in further detail below, not only does 
the Court find Plaintiffs' allegations are not conclusory, but the Court also notes Plaintiffs' complaint contains more detailed 
allegations than those pleaded in Tichy."
263,30," The Tichy court reached this conclusion even though vertical restrictions on advertisements might be less overtly 
anticompetitive than the alleged vertical price restrictions in In re OTC. Tichy, 376 F. Supp. 3d at 839. "
265,31," Specifically, Plaintiffs allege unilateral activity ""would have been economic suicide unless the hotels simultaneously conspired 
to eliminate direct interbrand competition for branded keyword search advertising between and among themselves."" Docket 
Entry # 1, ¶ 87. Plaintiffs allege ""unless the Defendant Hotels expended the time and effort to shut down every possible 
alternative distribution channel, its unilateral enforcement would still generate OTA and competitor results from any OTA not 
subject to aggressive enforcement measures."" Id. at ¶ 89 (emphasis in original). Plaintiffs have also alleged the Gatekeeper 
OTAs had no independent economic incentive to agree with the hotel chains to impose branded keyword bidding restrictions on 
themselves and their affiliates. Id. at ¶¶ 145-50. According to Plaintiffs, if ""a single Gatekeeper OTA like Expedia agreed to such 
restrictions, a competitor like Priceline would take Expedia's (and its downstream affiliates) former share of the branded keyword 
business without helping the hotels achieve their goal of eliminating competition in branded keyword search."" Docket Entry # 108 
at p. 5 (citing Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 145-50). "
266,32," Specifically, Defendants assert as follows: First, regarding an alleged Google employee statement that hotels stopped bidding on branded search terms sometime in the 
third quarter of 2014 (Docket Entry # 1, ¶ 103), Defendants assert this allegation relates solely to the primary conspiracy. Second, regarding an Expedia PowerPoint sent to its own downstream affiliates that purportedly aggregated requests from 
several hotels to reduce branded keyword bidding (Docket Entry # 1, ¶ 108), Defendants state the allegation that Gatekeeper 
OTA Expedia ""had a PowerPoint tracking its own compliance and that of its downstream OTAs with Expedia's own separate, 
bilateral agreements does not suggest a conspiracy between the Gatekeeper OTAs and the hotel Defendants."" Docket Entry # 
97 at p. 7. According to Defendants, at most, this allegation reflects parallel conduct. Third, regarding an email from Expedia to TravelPass allegedly requesting that TravelPass stop bidding on branded keyword 
search advertising (Docket Entry #1, ¶ 109), Defendants again assert this allegation reflects, at most, parallel conduct and does 
not suggest a conspiracy among the Defendants or all Defendants and Expedia. Id. Fourth, regarding TravelPass's trade association allegations (Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 116-132), Defendants explain in both their 
motion and reply that the opportunity to conspire at trade association events does not evidence wrongdoing. Id. at p. 8; see also 
Docket Entry # 53 at pp. 15-16. Fifth, regarding TravelPass's ""monitoring report"" allegations (Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 111-15), Defendants argue TravelPass's 
allegation that monitoring reports allegedly sent by Expedia to some of the Defendants were ""attempts to police the 
conspiracies"" is the kind of conclusory allegation that Twombly rejects. Docket Entry # 97 at p. 8. Sixth, Defendants address certain ""affiliate agreements"" of Marriott and Wyndham, which provide various keyword bidding 
restrictions, including requesting that the affiliate not bid on the keywords of other hotel chains (Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 133-140). 
According to Defendants, rather than being contrary to the economic interests of a hotel company, ""there are logical, self-
interested economic motivations for these two hotel companies to limit affiliates from attempting to attract consumers who 
already had indicated their preference for a certain brand, including, as TravelPass concedes, the additional cost associated with 
a guest booking an equally-priced room through an affiliate rather than directly through the hotel's website."" Id. Seventh, regarding an email from Priceline to TravelPass reminding TravelPass that Caesars had demanded that its 
downstream affiliates stop bidding on branded keywords (Docket Entry # 1, ¶ 148), Defendants assert the fact that Caesars 
allegedly requested Priceline to comply with its vertical contractual obligations does not evidence a conspiracy among all 
Defendants and Gatekeeper OTAs. Id. "
267,33," In the original complaint, under a section titled ""THE PRIMARY HORIZONTAL CONSPIRACY GROWS,"" Plaintiffs allege as 
follows regarding Caesar and Red Roof:"
267,141," . On November 14, 2016, the AHLA announced that senior executives from two new hotel chains—Caesars and Red 
Roof—would be joining its board of directors."
267,142," . Before their executives joined the AHLA board, neither Caesars nor Red Roof had participated actively or aggressively 
in the other conspirators' attempts to restrain branded keyword bidding."
267,143," . Within weeks of this announcement, Defendants Caesar and Red Roof began participating actively [*94]  in the other 
Defendants' illegal activities."
267,144," . By the end of December 2016, both Red Roof and Caesars had sent TravelPass spurious 'cease and desist' letters, 
and had begun complaining to Gatekeeper OTAs about OTA branded keyword bidding. Red Roof attempted to cut off 
TravelPass's access to Red Roof inventory in January 2017; in March 2017, Caesars followed suit. Docket Entry # 1, ¶¶ 141-144; see also id. at ¶ 148 (alleging a Gatekeeper OTA manager contacted TravelPass about 
Defendant Caesars' demand that OTAs stop bidding on Caesars-related keywords). "
270,34," However, because the case is before the Court on federal question jurisdiction because it also involves federal antitrust 
claims, the Court will of course apply federal substantive law in considering those issues. Whitehurst, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
87530, 2009 WL 3052663, at *4, n. 4 (citing Summers v. Tex. Dep't of Crim. Justice, No. 06-70046, 206 F. App'x 317, 319-320 
(5th Cir. Oct.25, 2006)). "
276,1, All references in this Opinion to Rules refer to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
277,2," If a customer simultaneously bought and sold the same currency pair, the spread would represent the liquidity provider's profits 
from that ""round-trip"" transaction. A ""half-spread"" thus represents one ""leg"" of the trip -- either buying from or selling to the 
liquidity provider."
277,3," Forwards are OTC transactions where the parties agree to exchange currencies at a certain rate on a specified date, other than 
the spot value date. Swaps are the exchange of a forward for either a spot or another forward, with different settlement dates (for 
example, selling a USD/GBP spot while buying a USD/GBP forward with settlement in ninety days). Futures are exchange-
traded forwards with standardized terms."
277,4," The Complaint also alleges that Defendants coordinated to manipulate fixing rates (published exchange rates used as a 
benchmark and pricing mechanism) and resting orders (orders directing a bank to execute a trade when the market price for a 
currency pair hits a specified level). For purposes of class certification, Plaintiffs focus only on the alleged conspiracy to widen 
spreads in the spot market. "
278,5," In their reply brief, Plaintiffs redefined the OTC Class in response to arguments made by the CS Defendants. The OTC Class 
definition set forth in the reply brief is the one analyzed in this opinion. See Simmons v. Author Sols., LLC, No. 13 Civ. 2801, 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85868, 2015 WL 4002243, at *4 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. July 1, 2015) (""As there has been at least one round of 
adversarial briefing on the class definitions set forth in plaintiffs' reply, those are the definitions that are analyzed here."")."
278,6," The Court limited the claims in its September 20, 2016, Opinion and Order. Dkt. 661."
278,7," According to Plaintiffs' expert Robin Poynder, ""Defendants produced approximately 3 billion lines of raw FX data from over 30 
different bank systems."" Poynder's firm assisted in processing the transaction data and creating a ""unified FX cash extract"" (the 
""Database""). "
282,8, Non-U.S. domiciliaries transacting with a Defendant's foreign desk are excluded under the OTC Class definition.
282,9," Even if the class definition were amended to exclude trades between a Defendant's foreign desk and a U.S. domiciliary 
operating abroad, this would not obviate the need for an individualized inquiry to determine class members' trading locations, 
which would be relevant to both whether claims were barred under the FTAIA and to determine who was in the class. See 
Mazzei, 829 F.3d at 268 (2d Cir. 2016) (""This factual question -- whether Mazzei proved that absent class members were in 
privity with The Money Store -- was both relevant to the (de)certification motion and an element of the class's merits claim."")."
282,10," Although the court in Petrobras did not decide the predominance issue, instead remanding to the district court, see id. at 274-
75, the court noted that resolving the question of domesticity could entail individualized inquiries that must be considered within 
Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance framework. See id. at 273."
282,11," U.S.-domiciled corporations may open foreign offices which, depending on local law, need not be organized as separate legal 
entities. See, e.g., MARGARET A. NILES, 5 LAWS OF INT'L TRADE § 140:32 (2019) (discussing legal status of foreign ""branches"" 
under Chinese law); Vera Poulsen, Going East to Seek Your Fortune?: The Pros and Cons of Using an LLC as a Business 
Vehicle and Related Aspects of Doing Business in Russia, 70 UMKC L. Rev. 217, 236 (2001) (discussing ""representative 
offices"" and ""permanent establishments"" under Russian law). Likewise, partners may participate in the business of a domestic 
partnership from abroad. See WILLIS, POSTLEWAITE & ALEXANDER, PARTNERSHIP TAXATION ¶ 21.04(1) (2019). "
283,12," In their reply, Plaintiffs revised the class definition to exclude trades in which class members provided liquidity, to address the 
possibility of intra-class conflicts."
283,13," As discussed above, the half-spread represents the effective price a customer pays to buy from or sell to a dealer. "
284,14," The reference price is the midpoint between ""the top-of-book bid and ask quotes"" (i.e., the best prices offered to buy or sell a 
currency pair) on the EBS or Reuters interdealer platforms."
284,15," The CS Defendants challenge the assertion that negative spreads necessarily indicate that a class member has provided 
liquidity; for example, dealers sometimes offer customers preferential rates in order to increase order flow. "
287,16," Plaintiffs raise this argument in the context of the OTC Class, but presumably would contend that it applies to the Exchange 
Class as well. "
303,1, Defendants did not request the Court take judicial notice of the documents submitted in support of their joint motion to dismiss. 
304,2," Plaintiffs also do not explain how much a DRAM component makes up of the final cost of each type of DRAM Product. See In 
re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 586 F. Supp. 2d 1109, 1113-14 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (alleging component comprised 60-
70% of end-product cost). This is important because it illustrates the degree to which a DRAM Product's cost is dependent upon 
or tied to DRAM cost. If a DRAM Product contains three components, of which DRAM is one, it is more likely that an increase in 
DRAM price will affect the overall price of the DRAM Product than if the DRAM Product contained thirty components. See In re 
Magnesium Oxide Antitrust Litig., No. 10-cv-5943, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121373, 2011 WL 5008090, at *7 (D.N.J. Oct. 20, 
2011) (observing that contested component of end-product would have ""minimal foreseeable effect"" on price where end-product 
contained only ""trace amount"" as opposed to products where contested component was ""major ingredient""). "
305,3," ""Sister state"" is a term courts have coined to describe class actions raising multiple similar state law causes of action. "
306,4," This Court addressed this precise issue in an order granting a motion to dismiss in Rivera v. Invitation Homes, Inc., No. 18-cv-
3158-JSW, Dkt. No. 30. "
307,5," Those twenty jurisdictions are Arizona, Arkansas, District of Columbia, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, 
New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin. "
308,6," In citing to this case, the Court does not intend to suggest it agrees that AGC applies to California law. See Batteries, 2014 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, 2014 WL 4955377, at *8-11. "
309,7, This section addresses the named Plaintiffs' standing to raise sister state claims in a putative class action.
309,8," This section addresses arguments concerning intrastate effect, the effect of notice requirements on the pleadings, the 
existence of a private right of action, and other issues specific to the state law claims at issue."
309,9," In discussing the applicability of the AGC test to antitrust standing under various state laws, the Court sets aside Defendants' 
contention that Plaintiffs' failure to plead an unlawful agreement infects each of the state claims. Plaintiffs do not appear to 
contest that the non-federal claims are also dependent upon an adequately-pled unlawful conspiracy. The Court therefore 
assumes, without deciding, that this is so. "
310,10," The Court notes that both parties appear to have conflated parallel conduct analysis with plus factor analysis. HN25[
] The 
existence of parallel conduct does not negate the need for plus factor analysis, and the existence of some plus factors is not 
necessarily dispositive as to whether parallel conduct has been successfully pled. Both parallel conduct and plus factors must be 
adequately pled in order to state a claim under § 1 of the Sherman Act. "
311,11," HN27[
] An oligopoly exists when a market is controlled or dominated by a few large sellers, creating high prices and low 
output similar to that found in a monopoly. Oligopoly, BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2019)."
311,12," HN28[
] A commodity is a standardized, homogenous product fungible to consumers in terms of its source. (Complaint ¶ 
141.) When demand for a product is inelastic, it means that the product's consumers are not particularly sensitive to price. In 
other words, for products with inelastic demand, cutting prices will not increase the size of the market, and raising prices will not 
decrease the size of the market. (Id. ¶ 166.) "
312,13," Even so, it is not clear to the Court from the Complaint that such ""opportunity"" existed: the complaint does not allege that 
Defendants attended each referenced association meeting. "
313,14, The Court notes the Complaint is inconsistent as to whether the Class Period begins in June or July of 2016. 
316,15, Plaintiffs plead their Cartwright Act claims in both the Second and Fourth Claims for Relief.
316,16," Though the parties seem to agree that the Sherman Act and the Cartwright Act have similar, if not identical, pleading 
requirements, the parties disagree, elsewhere in their briefs, as to whether the federal test for antitrust standing applies to 
California law. As explained more fully above (Section (C)(2)(b)), the Court declines to address this question."
316,17," Hynix filed a separate motion to dismiss, arguing that the Complaint lacks any factual allegations that Hynix participated in the 
purported conspiracy. The Court notes that allegations concerning Hynix are significantly sparser than those concerning either 
Samsung or Micron, but, given the Court's ruling that the Complaint does not sufficiently plead the existence of a conspiracy, the 
Court declines to address Hynix's separate motion to dismiss. The allegations against Hynix are insufficient to state a claim 
under the Sherman Act or the Cartwright Act for the same reasons the allegations against all Defendants are insufficient. "
317,18," The state statutes upon which these claims are based are: KAN. STAT. ANN. §§ 50-1-1, et seq., Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. §§ 
445.771, et seq., MISS. CODE ANN. §§ 75-2-1, et seq., N.Y. Gen. Bus. Laws §§ 340, et seq., N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 75-1, et seq.,

357,5," An Ohio trial court declared Cincinnati v. Beretta was superseded by the Ohio Products Liability Act (""OPLA""). See City of 
Toledo v. Sherwin-Williams, 2007 WL 4965044 (Ohio C.P. Dec. 12, 2007). This Court determined in an Order addressing a 
motion to dismiss, however, that Plaintiffs' public nuisance claim was not abrogated by OPLA. (Doc. #: 1203 at 23-28) (finding 
that more-recent case law shows the Plaintiff's common law nuisance claim, which does not seek compensatory damages, is not 
abrogated under the OPLA) (citing Ohio v. Purdue Pharma, Case No. 17 CI 261 (Ohio C.P. Aug. 22, 2018))."
357,6," HN8[
] Absent a statutory definition, ""a court may consult a dictionary definition for guidance discerning the plain meaning of the statute's language."" Vander Boegh v. EnergySolutions, Inc., 772 F.3d 1056, 1060 (6th Cir. 2014); O.R.C. § 1.42 (""Words and 
phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.""). "
358,7," Defendants misplace reliance on Doe v. Archdiocese of Cincinnati, 109 Ohio St. 3d 491, 2006-Ohio-2625, 849 N.E.2d 268, 278 
(Ohio 2006), to support their argument that only the statute's five-year limitations period applies to this case. There, plaintiff 
admitted that the alleged sexual abuse occurred when he was 12-15 years old, more than 20 years prior to filing suit. Id. at 271, 
277. The Court held the claim time-barred, explaining that the statute of limitations commenced five years after plaintiff reached 
the age of majority, which was the latest of the dates authorized by O.R.C. § 2923.34(J). Application of the statute's 'five years 
after termination of the conduct' clause would have commenced the limitation period more than 20 years earlier. In this case, 
application of the same clause acts very differently."
358,8," The same exception also applies in connection with another related case filed by the State of Ohio: State of Ohio ex rel. Yost v. 
McKesson Corp., et al, Case No. CVH 2018055 (Madison Cty. Ct. C.P.), in which the Ohio Attorney General alleges certain 
Defendants operated an opioid supply-chain enterprise in violation of the OCPA."
358,9," Neither the instant motion for summary judgment based on limitations nor any other motion filed by Defendants seeks dismissal 
of Plaintiffs' claim for equitable relief under RICO. "
359,10," In Ganey, the Sixth Circuit also acknowledged a circuit split as to whether RICO confers equitable relief, and declined to rule 
on that question where the ""sole issue"" before the Court was interpretation of an arbitration award. See 91 F.3d at *1, *3-4, 
[published in full-text format at 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 19148]& n.6 (vacating District Court's order of injunction as improperly 
exceeding its authority where plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and damages under RICO in arbitration, but were awarded money 
damages only). "
362,11," Distributors also note that a year prior to the West Virginia filing, Ohio joined West Virginia and Kentucky to form the Interstate 
Opiate Task Force ""to fight prescription-drug abuse"" in the region. (Doc. #: 1896-1 at 30 and referenced exhibits)."
362,12," The Montgomery court concluded that the media coverage triggered a duty to investigate, presenting an issue of fact as to 
plaintiff's diligence in investigating and discovering evidence warranting a claim. Montgomery, 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9176, [WL] 
at *5. "
364,13," Plaintiffs never argue that their inability to obtain granular ARCOS data precluded them from bringing suit. Instead, they argue 
only that ARCOS data ""would have assisted in building a case against Defendants."" (See Doc. #: 2212-1 at 29). Plaintiffs also 
assert they ""could have identified Distributor and Pharmacy Defendants as precipitators of the opioid epidemic ""much sooner"" 
with the benefit of ARCOS data."" (Id. at 36). These assertions are almost certainly true, but they do not support application of the 
doctrine of equitable tolling. "
366,14," The Pharmacies' memorandum of law adopts the arguments raised by the Manufacturers and Distributors concerning 
applicable limitations periods, accrual dates, tolling doctrines, and marketing practices. The Court's determinations above apply 
to Walgreens. "
368,1, Plaintiffs bring this suit individually and on behalf of others similarly situated.
368,2," This section draws from the allegations in the complaint, which are accepted as true for purposes of this Order. "
372,3," For this reason, the Bribery Defendants argument under the Burford abstention doctrine is unavailing. "
373,4," Johnson Utilities and Johnson International moved to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint, arguing that ""jurisdiction over the 
unsupported claims lies exclusively in the Superior Court of Arizona"" and that the Commission ""is constitutionally constrained 
from adjudicating civil claims pursuant to its limited grant of authority."" (Doc. 96-1 at 115.) R&R Partners and the Commission 
Utility Division also moved to dismiss."
373,5," The Transfer Defendants also moved to dismiss these claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the Court lacks 
subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law fraudulent transfer claims because it lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' RICO, 
ACFA, and unjust enrichment claims. For reasons explained above, the Court finds that it has jurisdiction over the RICO, ACFA, 
and unjust enrichment claims. The Court therefore has supplemental and ancillary jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' fraudulent transfer 
and declaratory judgment claims. See, e.g., Tomar Elecs., Inc. v. Watkins, No. 09-CV-170-PHX-ROS, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
146872, 2010 WL 11434976, at *3 (D. Ariz. Sept. 2, 2010). "
388,1," Not only is this type of document request unquestionably duplicative of the discovery already served and produced, it is 
impossible in huge corporations to ever be able to say that a ""targeted"" document request can demand ""all documents . . . 
concerning"" some broadly described topic. The CMO entered by the Court required Arconic to state with some degree of clarity 
the type of document sought, especially where so many documents had already been produced. There were many such broad 
requests that are too numerous to be restated here, but all ignored the directive of the CMO."
388,2," Arconic's effort to defend its cumulative discovery demands based on Kephart is misplaced. In Kephart v. ABB, Inc., No. 2:12-
668, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 51411, at *20 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 14, 2014), the court addressed a specific issue relevant in personal 
injury litigation where a plaintiff has put his ability to work at issue, finding that an arms' length vocational examination is not 
cumulative of the plaintiff's own medical records. Despite Arconic's repeated reliance on this case to support its definition of 
cumulativeness, nowhere does this case support Arconic's argument that its broadly cumulative discovery demands are justified, 
in the face of a CMO that orders otherwise, unless Novelis can establish that it has produced all responsive documents. "
389,3," As is discussed below related to Topics 12-14, the requests that Arconic proposed to narrow (Topics 13 and 14) were 
manifestly overbroad and unjustified."
389,4," In Ashton, in response to a request for ""contracts, purchase orders, or agreements,"" the defendant proposed to produce only ""a 
few 'sample' or 'template' contracts,"" and the court agreed with the plaintiff that allowing a party to provide only a self-selected 
sample of responsive documents was improper cherry picking. Ashton, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109694, 2016 WL 4414640, at *7. 
Arconic argues that, here, Novelis is similarly attempting to cherry pick and that ""Novelis is not entitled to unilaterally narrow the 
scope of Arconic's discovery to documents that Novelis wants to produce."" (2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109694, [WL] at 8.) The 
Novelis proposals in this case are entirely different from those in Ashton because Novelis proposes to produce entire categories 
of documents, and Arconic makes no showing that such proposals are inadequate. "
395,5," According to Novelis, the parties ""crafted search terms to capture any documents mentioning other pretreatments Novelis had 
in development (TiZr, Oxsilan, PT2 and PT3)""; Arconic noticed two 30(b)(6) topics on this issue (""Novelis's pretreatment 
development efforts"" and ""communication with Henkel about pretreatment development"") (though that deposition did not yet 
occur because discovery on the trade secret claims was stayed); and Novelis ""produced technical, commercial, and pricing 
documents analyzing A951 and other pretreatments."" (Novelis Letter at 23.) "
401,6," According to Novelis, Rhodia, Solvay and PPG ""are chemical companies from which Novelis does not purchase 
pretreatments."" (Redfern at 84.) Henkel is a chemical company with whom Novelis was working to develop an alternative to 
A951. (Novelis Letter at 21.) "
402,7," By contrast, if there are documents in other categories that are responsive to proper document requests, such documents are 
not protected from disclosure because they also relate to a pending transaction. At the Hearing, Novelis stated that a current 
custodian—Ganesh Panneer—is likely to have documents in his files related to the potential transaction, such as ""current 
analysis of the market and future forecasts."" (Hr'g Tr. at 198:11-16.) Novelis confirmed that to the extent merger-related 
documents, otherwise responsive to Arconic's requests, are located in its custodians' files—including Mr. Panneer's—Novelis 
would produce such documents. If there are highly sensitive parts of such documents, that portion can be redacted if such 
portions relate to a potential unconsummated business transaction, as long as the information about the comparison of the 
pretreatment products, or relative market size, is produced. Any such redactions must be labeled, to distinguish them from 
redactions on the basis of privilege. "
403,8," Arconic asserts that this interrogatory has additional relevance to the Antitrust Counterclaims, ""which are premised on 
assertions that Arconic influenced the price of A951 Chemicals through its agreement with Chemetall and that the 'manipulated' 
price includes consideration for expired patents."" (Arconic Letter at 38.) The referenced allegation of ""[m]arket forces"" is not to a 
principle of antitrust law but rather is a contractual term negotiated by the parties in the License."
403,9," Arconic further offers that ""in any event, if data from certain custodians is cumulative, in electronic discovery, such data can be 
de-duped and thereby will not result in any additional burden on Novelis."" (Redfern at 91.) This suggestion fails to account for 
the fact that, prior to de-duplication, the proffered custodians' data must be located, collected, processed and searched. This 
would be an extraordinarily expensive and inefficient way to determine if a proposed custodian is cumulative of other existing 
custodians. "
424,1," Shortly before Battipaglia was decided, two state supreme courts ruled that their states' post-and-hold laws were unilateral 
restraints not subject to preemption under the Sherman Act. See Intercontinental Packaging Co. v. Novak, 348 N.W.2d 330, 
337-38 (Minn. 1984); Wine & Spirits Specialty, Inc. v. Daniel, 666 S.W.2d 416, 418-19 (Mo. 1984). Like Battipaglia, those cases 
have not been followed elsewhere, and their reasoning has been undermined by the Supreme Court's subsequent development 
of the ""hybrid restraint"" classification in Fisher and 324 Liquor Corp. - a classification that, as the panel opinion acknowledges, 
applies to Connecticut's post-and-hold law. Conn. Fine Wine & Spirits, LLC, 932 F.3d at 38."
424,2," Unlike Connecticut's and New York's post-and-hold schemes, Vermont's scheme does not include an ""adjust"" provision under 
which wholesalers have a short period of time to match the lowest posted price before the hold takes effect. Nevertheless, while 
an adjust provision exacerbates the anti-competitive effects of post-and-hold laws, such laws are sufficiently anticompetitive on 
their own to violate the Sherman Act. See Costco Wholesale Corp., 522 F.3d at 896 n.18 (""[The absence of an adjust provision] 
will not save the [post-and-hold] scheme from per se condemnation. That firms are not empowered immediately to alter their 
prices to meet a lower price or to adjust to a higher price does not alter the conclusion that in the long run, prices for beer and 
wine are more likely to be uniform and stable because of tacit collusion.""). "
430,1," Even though there is also a common law right of access to judicial documents, ""the First Amendment protection has been 
understood to be stronger than its common law ancestor and counterpart."" Id. Here, the Court ""need not, and do[es] not, engage 
in such a common law analysis"" separate from the First Amendment analysis. Id. Because the Court finds that the public has a 
First Amendment right of access to the judicial documents at issue, no determination as to the public's common law right of 
access would the change the result. "
442,1, The BFPD is publicly available at https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb.
442,2," Plaintiffs suggest that the Court may take judicial notice of the fact that the information was in the public realm. However, the 
USDA Branded Food Products Database officially launched on 16 September 2016. See U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, USDA 
Announces New Open Data Partnership for Public Health, Release No. 0198.16, Sept. 16, 2016. The Court does not have 
sufficient facts by which to determine whether data contained within the BFPD was available in the public realm at the time of 
Plaintiffs' purchase and therefore also declines to take judicial notice on that basis. "
443,3," Specifically, Plaintiffs allege violations of : (1) 21 U.S.C. § 331(a), which prohibits introduction into interstate commerce of 
misbranded food; (2) 21 U.S.C. § 331(b), prohibiting the adulteration or misbranding of any food; and (3) 15 U.S.C. §1452, 
making it unlawful to package or label any consumer commodity which does not conform to the Fair Packaging and Labeling 
Program set forth in 15 U.S.C. Chapter 39."
443,4," Plaintiffs summarily list Cal. Health & Safe. Code sections: § 110390 (prohibiting the dissemination of false advertising); 
§110395 (prohibiting the manufacture or sell of falsely-advertised products); §110398 (making it unlawful to advertise a 
misbranded product); §110760 (making it unlawful to manufacture or sell any misbranded product); and §110765 (making it 
unlawful to misbrand any food). (SAC ¶ 88(a)-(e).) "
444,5," An advertisement is considered ""false"" under California law if it is misleading. Cal. Health & Safety Code § 110390. "
448,6," Standing is a jurisdictional issue raised either in a 12(b)(1) motion or motion for class certification. See e.g., Cardenas v. NBTY, 
Inc., 870 F.Supp.2d 984, 992-93 (E.D.Cal.2012) (analyzing ""solely under Rule 23"" whether plaintiff may assert claims on behalf 
of purchasers of products she did not purchase); Forcellati v. Hyland's, Inc., 876 F.Supp.2d 1155, 1161 (C.D.Cal.2012) (denying 
defendants' motion to dismiss because the ""argument is better taken under the lens of typicality or adequacy of representation, 
rather than standing"")."
448,7," In Lozano, the Ninth Circuit mentioned the California Supreme Court's reference to section 5 of the FTCA as a source of 
""guidance,"" but highlighted that the discussion revolved around anti-competitive conduct, rather than anticonsumer conduct and 
therefore found the FTC test inappropriate. "
449,8," The United States Supreme Court recognized that the FDCA statutory regime is designed primarily to protect the health and 
safety of the public at large. POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co., 573 U.S. 102, 108, 134 S. Ct. 2228, 189 L. Ed. 2d 141 
(2014)(citing FDCA, § 401, 52 Stat. 1046, 21 U.S.C. § 341 and highlighting that the FDA may issue certain regulations to

452,2," Defendants Belt Line, Moss, Hall, Hurlbut, Merrilli, and Norfolk Southern will be collectively referred to as ""Defendants."""
452,3," A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) is generally limited to a review of the allegations in the complaint itself. Goines v. 
Valley Cmty. Servs. Bd., 822 F.3d 159, 165-66 (4th Cir. 2016). However, courts may consider documents that are attached to 
the complaint as exhibits. Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c). Thus, the facts recited here are drawn from the Complaint and attached exhibits. "
453,," They are assumed true only to decide the motion to dismiss. The facts stated here are not factual findings for any purpose other 
than consideration of the pending motions. See Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S. Ct. 2197, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (2007)

Compl. at 3 n.1. "
460,5," As further iscussed below, the Individual Defendants make a similar unavailing argument in seeking to dismiss the shareholder 
derivative claims alleged against them. "
462,6," The Court notes that most of these cases were decided on summary judgment as the determination of whether a parent 
corporation shares ""a unity of interest"" with a subsidiary is a factual determination. Therefore, the Court will not prematurely 
reach such issue at the motion to dismiss stage of the litigation. "

483,1," The defendants-appellants appeal from an opinion and order of the district court denying their post-trial motion for judgment as 
a matter of law or in the alternative for a new trial under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 50 and 59, respectively. We view the 
evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant; here, the plaintiff-appellee. See, e.g., Ali v. Kipp, 891 F.3d 59, 64 (2d Cir. 
2018); MacDermid Printing Sols. LLC v. Cortron Corp., 833 F.3d 172, 180 (2d Cir. 2016). In its cross-appeal, the plaintiff-
appellee is challenging the district court's dismissal of two counts of their complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
12(b)(6) and limiting of their damages in response to a motion for summary judgment by the defendants-appellants. As with the 
post-trial motion under Rules 50 and 59, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant; again, the plaintiff-
appellee. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007); Glob. Reinsurance

Corp., 105 F. Supp. 3d 265, 273 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). The change in US Airways's status does not appear to have affected the 
merits of this appeal. For purposes of relative simplicity, we therefore treat US Airways throughout this opinion as though it has 
remained an independent entity. "

490,5," From time to time, we rely on and cite to the trial transcript. It is part of the record on appeal. See Federal Rule of Appellate

trial transcript, ""Trial Tr.,"" and the district court docket, ""Dkt."" Citations to the appendix on appeal are denominated ""A[xxx]."" "
492,6," As far as we are aware, we have not previously addressed a verdict based on hypothetical questions or an alternative verdict 
on appeal. We cannot, need not, and do not, in resolving this appeal, rule out the possibility that under some combination of 
circumstances we would affirm such a judgment. We do harbor some general doubt, however, as to the wisdom of basing a 
judgment on a jury verdict that the jury understands is unlikely to be the basis of such a judgment. Courts in other jurisdictions 
cast jaundiced eyes on the practice. See, e.g., Romer v. Baldwin, 317 F.2d 919, 923 (3d Cir. 1963) (declining to credit the jury's 
answers to alternative hypothetical questions because ""the jury must have approached the question of damages as merely an 
intellectual exercise in the theoretical evaluation of a claim""); Castle v. Sangamo Weston, Inc., 837 F.2d 1550, 1560-61 (11th Cir. 
1988) (having vacated the district court's judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the court of appeals declined to credit the award 
of liquidated damages by the district court conditioned on such vacatur because such award was merely a ""conditional"" ruling, 
which, though ""designed to promote judicial economy,"" is ""an impermissible means to a noble end""). But, of course, these 
decisions are not binding on us, and they would not require us to decide an appeal based on an alternative verdict or 
hypothetical question one way or another even if they were. "
496,7," US Airways further asserts that ""[b]oth the [Department of Justice] and [Department of Transportation] have concluded—after 
review of an extensive factual record—that distribution through Sabre constitutes a separate relevant antitrust market."" 
Complaint ¶ 143, A147."
496,8," Sabre argues that Kodak is narrower than US Airways contends and is inapplicable to this case. It contends that Kodak should 
only apply when a defendant ""exploited customers by either (1) changing its policies after its customers were locked in or (2) 
concealing its policies at the time of purchase."" Sabre Reply 52. Sabre cites cases from the First, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh 
Circuits in support. See Lee v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 23 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 1994); Alcatel USA, Inc. v. DGI Techs., Inc., 166 
F.3d 772, 783 (5th Cir. 1999); PSI Repair Servs., Inc. v. Honeywell Inc., 104 F. 3d 811, 819 (6th Cir. 1997); Digital Equip. Corp. 
v. Uniq Digital Techs., Inc., 73 F.3d 756, 763 (7th Cir. 1996). But those cases do not purport to apply any such rule to a plaintiff's 
attempt to allege a single-brand market when no alleged aftermarket or tying arrangement is involved, such as in this case, nor 
can we read Kodak to have done so. "
497,9," A district court in the Northern District of Texas came to the same conclusion in a virtually identical case in which US Airways's 
parent corporation, AMR, sued Sabre and other GDSs for the same alleged violations of Section 2. See Am. Airlines, Inc. v. 
Travelport Ltd., No. 4:11-CV-244-Y, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 166373, 2011 WL 13047291, at *6 (N.D. Tex. Nov. 21, 2011), order

(N.D. Tex. Feb. 28, 2012). The case was eventually settled, and that settlement, as noted above, was the basis for a limitation of 
recoverable damages in the case at bar. See US Airways, 105 F. Supp. 3d at 273, 290."

rule[.]""); Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705, 711 (11th Cir. 1984) (""[E]xclusive dealing arrangements 
are to be analyzed under the rule of reason.""). Defendant does not argue that Plaintiffs failed to allege the absence of any pro-
competitive justification and, on that issue, Plaintiffs alleged that ""[q]uality control is not a valid business justification for 
excluding third parties from servicing da Vinci robots"" because Defendant already entrusts its distributor's toolkit to third-party 
distributors and Plaintiffs use ""certified field service engineers with prior training and experience"" with Defendant to work on the 
surgical robots. See Doc. 14, at 20 (¶60) (emphasis added). Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs were required to allege that 
Defendant's conduct has no pro-competitive benefit or justification, the Court finds that they adequately did so."
502,4," Here, although multiple tying arrangements are alleged among the da Vinci robot systems, robot maintenance services, robot 
replacement parts, and the EndoWrist instruments, the Court will refer to them as a single tying arrangement based on their 
interrelated nature. "
503,5," Defendant points to the alleged avoidance of the one-year warranty on the entire da Vinci robot that befalls customers who 
accept service on the robot's parts from anyone other than Defendant as evidence that the arrangements are not formalistically 
exclusive. However, this allegation just as easily supports the position that as a practical matter, the arrangements are exclusive 
because customers who opt for a competitor suffer a significance consequence. "
504,6," Defendant also claims that Plaintiffs' injuries are attributable to federal regulations, but Defendant has provided limited support 
for its argument that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory framework pursuant to which Defendant's products 
were ""cleared"" for surgical use breaks the chain of proximate causation, thereby preventing Plaintiffs from establishing antitrust 
injury. Plaintiffs have persuasively distinguished this case from the one Third Circuit case cited by Defendant, see Doc. 18, at 
14-15, and in any event, the FDA clearance in this case does not require tying and exclusive dealing arrangements in 
contravention of antitrust law."
504,7," It is immaterial the one-brand market in this case is an aftermarket. Cf. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., 504 U.S. 
451, 479 n.29, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (citations omitted) (""[O]n the occasions when the [Supreme] Court has 
considered tying in derivative aftermarkets by manufacturers, it has not adopted any exception to the usual antitrust analysis, 
treating derivative aftermarkets as it has every other separate market.""); Aquatherm Indus., Inc. v. Fla. Power & Light Co., 145 
F.3d 1258, 1261 (11th Cir. 1998) (treating the ""pool heater aftermarket"" as ""the pool heater market""). "
505,8," Cf. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Servs., 504 U.S. 451, 479 n.29, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (citations 
and quotation marks omitted) (""[P]ower gained through some natural and legal advantage such as a patent, copyright, or 
business acumen can give rise to liability if a seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand his empire into the 
next.""). "
506,9," Defendant possesses patents that effectively give it a legal monopoly in the primary product market of surgical robots. 
However, in this suit, Plaintiffs do not challenge Defendant's monopolization (or attempted monopolization) in the primary 
market; rather, they sue under the theory that Defendant's patents do not allow it to expand its legal monopoly in the primary 
market into the aftermarkets through anticompetitive means. "
507,10," Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States, 410 U.S. 366, 93 S. Ct. 1022, 35 L. Ed. 2d 359 (1973)."
507,11," The Court assumes for purposes of ruling on Defendant's motion to dismiss that the essential facility doctrine is a viable theory 
even though the Supreme Court stated in Trinko that ""[w]e have never recognized such a doctrine."" 540 U.S. at 411. "
508,12," Because Plaintiffs plausibly stated a claim for monopolization and doing so required adequately alleging the possession of 
monopoly power and the commission of predatory or exclusionary anticompetitive acts, they adequately alleged a dangerous 
probability of Defendant's achieving—or continuing to achieve—monopoly power and the conduct required for attempted 
monopolization. "
515,1," The defendants nevertheless point out that LDCs operating in New England do face some variability in demand for natural gas 
due to rapidly changing weather conditions in the region. "
516,2," A ""[s]ale of electric energy at wholesale"" is a ""sale of electric energy to any person for resale."" 16 U.S.C. § 824(d). "
524,1," The operative complaint in the 3:18-cv-718 action is the Second Amended Consolidated Complaint. (Dk. No. 119, No. 3:18-cv-
718.) The operative complaint in the 3:18-cv-850 action is the Consolidated Class Action Complaint. (Dk. No. 56, No. 3:18-cv-
850.) The Court will refer to both operative complaints collectively as ""the complaints."" "
526,2," Only the direct purchaser plaintiffs make this allegation. (See Dk. No. 119, 3:18-cv-718, at if 90.) At oral argument, counsel for 
the plaintiffs said that Dale Mayfield is the vice president and has worked for Masonite since 2012. (Hr'g Tr. 23:21-25, June 11, 
2019; Dk. No. 138, 3:18-cv-718.)"
526,3," Steves & Sons, Inc. v. JELD-WEN, Inc., Civil Action No. 3:16-cv-00545-REP. Section 7 of the Clayton Act prohibits companies 
from acquiring assets that would create a monopoly and thus would harm competition. See 15 U.S.C. § 18."
526,4," The remaining named direct purchaser plaintiffs are Grubb Lumber Company, Inc. (""Grubb""), and Philadelphia Reserve Supply 
Company (""PRSCO""). "
527,5," A Rule 12(b)(6) motion gauges the sufficiency of a complaint without resolving any factual discrepancies or testing the merits of 
the claims. Republican Party of N.C. v. Martin, 980 F.2d 943, 952 (4th Cir. 1992). In considering the motion, a court must accept 
all allegations in the complaint as true and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. 
Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir. 2009) (citing Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 244 (4th Cir. 
1999)). The principle that a court must accept all allegations as true, however, does not apply to legal conclusions. Ashcroft v. 
lqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint 
must state facts that, when accepted as true, state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Id. ""A claim has facial plausibility 
when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the 
misconduct alleged."" Id (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007)). "
530,6," Because the Court will deny the motion to dismiss the Sherman Act claim for failure to state a claim, the Court also will deny 
the motion to dismiss the related state antitrust claims on the same ground."
530,7," The defendants also argue (1) that the plaintiffs failed to show that the defendants fraudulently concealed any relevant facts, 
and (2) even if the plaintiffs pleaded the requisite fraud, they did not do so with particularity. Because the plaintiffs failed to 
satisfy the diligence requirement, the Court need not reach the defendants' additional arguments. "
531,8," In Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff who 
indirectly purchased a product from a defendant may not recover damages under federal antitrust law. The Supreme Court has 
not decided whether the Illinois Brick bar applies to equitable relief. See Apple, Inc. v. Pepper, 139 S. Ct. 1514, 1520 n.1, 203 L. 
Ed. 2d 802 (2019) (""Illinois Brick did not address injunctive relief, and we likewise do not address injunctive relief in this case.""). 
The Fourth Circuit, however, has held that Illinois Brick ""bars only compensatory damages relief and does not apply to injunctive 
relief."" Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 213 n.24 (4th Cir. 2002). Here, the indirect purchaser plaintiffs only seek 
equitable relief and not damages under federal law, so the Illinois Brick bar does not apply."
531,9," The defendants also challenge the indirect purchaser plaintiffs' antitrust standing as to their state claims, which the Court 
addresses below. "
532,10," The defendants further distinguish between two groups of standalone indirect purchasers: those who bought IMDs for their 
own use (such as a homeowner) and those who bought IMDs to install for someone else's use (such as a contractor). For 
example, homeowners buy IMDs to install in their own home, whereas contractors buy IMDs to install in someone else's home 
for a fee or as part of a larger construction project. The defendants' distinction is one without much difference. Because the 
homeowner and the contractor bought standalone IMDs from distributors, both suffered the same antitrust injury and are 
consumers in the relevant market."
532,11," At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, counsel for the plaintiffs adopted the first and more narrow interpretation: that an 
""indirect purchaser"" means a standalone indirect purchaser—not a component indirect purchaser. (See Hr'g Tr. 57:5-17.) "
533,12," The plaintiffs initially lacked named representatives in twenty-three states. After the defendants moved to dismiss, the plaintiffs 
voluntarily dismissed Thomas J. Riley and Wally Bloss. Riley was a resident of Massachusetts during the class period and 
purchased IMDs in New Hampshire. Bloss was a resident of Missouri during the class period. Riley and Bloss were the only 
named plaintiffs residing in or alleging harm in Missouri and New Hampshire. The plaintiffs have another named representative 
from Massachusetts. "
534,13," Courts have also compared the ratio between the number of states with and without named plaintiff representatives. Here, 
only fourteen of the thirty-nine states have named plaintiff representatives. See Jones v. Micron Tech., Inc., No. 18-cv-2518-
JSW, 400 F. Supp. 3d 897, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152274, 2019 WL 4232417, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 3, 2019) (""Given that only 
five of the twenty-five non-federal jurisdictions have named plaintiff representatives, the Court is concerned that allowing 
unrepresented sister state claims to proceed would subject Defendants to discovery in these additional states before Plaintiffs 
have secured 'actual plaintiffs who clearly have standing and are willing and able to assert claims under these state laws.'"" 
(quoting In re Carrier IQ, Inc., 78 F. Supp. 3d 1051, 1074 (N.D. Cal. 2015))). But see In re Zetia (Ezetimibe) Antitrust Litig., No. 
2:18-md-2836, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59469, 2019 WL 1397228, at *22-23 (E.D. Va. Feb. 6, 2019), report and recommendation

Article III standing at the motion to dismiss stage). "
535,14," If the state's highest court has not addressed the issue, federal courts must predict how the state's highest court would rule. 
See Wells v. Liddy, 186 F.3d 505, 527-28 (4th Cir. 1999) (directing federal courts to consider ""canons of construction, 
restatements of the law, treatises, recent pronouncements of general rules or policies by the state's highest court, well 
considered dicta, and the state's trial court decisions""). "
536,15," As explained above, see supra Part III.A.3, the Court construes the complaint to mean that the plaintiffs seek relief only as to 
standalone indirect purchasers. "
537,16," The fifth factor also touches on the ""homeowner"" versus ""contractor"" dispute. See supra Part III.A.3. The defendants insist that 
including contractors as plaintiffs ""adds a level of complexity"" to the antitrust standing analysis because it creates difficulties with 
apportioning damages. (Hr'g Tr. 54:4-8.) That argument overcomplicates the plaintiffs' allegations. Consider a contractor who 
bought a door for a home renovation. In that scenario, only the contractor—not the homeowner for whom the contractor 
completed the renovation—would have a claim for damages based on the sale of that door under state law as an indirect 
purchaser. The plaintiffs do not seek to recover twice for the sale of the same door. In any event, the defendants have not 
identified any specific challenges with apportioning damages that would justify dismissal of the state antitrust claims under AGC. 
See In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litig., No. 13-md-2420, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141358, 2014 WL 4955377, at *15 (N.D. 
Cal. Oct. 2, 2014) (""[D]efendants have failed to articulate, with specificity, why the measurement of plaintiffs' damages would be 
unascertainable and why this Court would lack the capacity to scrutinize the evidence and resolve complex issues of damages 
apportionment.""). "
540,17," The UCL ""allows plaintiffs to bring claims for unfair, unlawful, or fraudulent business practices."" Antman, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
141945, 2015 WL 612304, at *6. To the extent that the plaintiffs are proceeding under the ""unfair"" or ""unlawful"" prongs of the 
UCL, Rule 9(b) does not apply. See Anthem, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70594, 2016 WL 3029783, at *33-34. "
541,18," See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 44-1522; Fla. Stat. § 501.204(1); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2(b); S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-20(b). 
The Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act also contains an FTC Act harmonization provision. See 815 "
542,," Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. § 505/2. As explained below, see supra Part III.B.3.b.iii, the Court will dismiss the Illinois consumer 
protection claim on other grounds. "
545,19," As explained above, see supra Part III.A.2, the plaintiffs cannot invoke the doctrine of fraudulent concealment to toll their 
claims."
545,20," See Ariz. Rev. Stat. § 44-1410; Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16750.1; Mich. Comp. Laws § 445.781(2); Minn. Stat. § 325D.64;

545,21, See Miss. Code Ann. § 15-1-49; Tenn. Code Ann. § 28-3-105. 
554,1," Defendant Elite Concrete, LLC does not join in the argument asserted as to the Charleston market. (ECF No. 146 at 1). "
564,2," As discussed above, discovery may support narrowing the temporal and/or geographical scope of the claim. However, at this 
stage, the Court considers application of the statute of limitations as to the conspiracy claim as it is pleaded in the SAC. "
566,3," In their response to Elite Concrete's motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs assert the SAC demonstrates a ""continuing violation."" (ECF 
No. 160 at 15). In finding that Plaintiffs have alleged fraudulent concealment, the Court determines it need not pass on whether 
the SAC sets forth continuing violations. "
567,4, Plaintiffs appear to concede that the Court does not have general jurisdiction over Evans Concrete.
567,5," South Carolina's long-arm statute is in accord with the limits of the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. S.C. 
Code Ann. § 36-2-803; Atlantic Soft Drink Co. of Columbia, Inc. v. South Carolina Nat'l Bank, 287 S.C. 228, 336 S.E.2d 876, 878 
(S.C. 1985). "
570,6," The Thomas Entities contend that Delaware law controls the asset purchase agreement and therefore governs the question of 
successor liability but assert that in any event the outcome is the same under South Carolina law. (Id. at 11 n.5). The Court need 
not resolve the issue at this time. "
578,1," The Court recounts and accepts as true the well-pled facts alleged in the Amended Complaint (# 21). See Dudnikov v. Chalk & 
Vermilion Fine Arts Inc., 514 F.3d 1063, 1069-70 (10th Cir. 2008)."
578,2," The Home Mag Holding Co. LLC (Home Mag Holding) is the owner of 11 regional publishers in areas other than Denver. It 
owns all of the intellectual property rights associated with TheHomeMag system, and licenses them to THM Management LLC, 
which in turn, sublicenses them to franchisees such as Antsel Marketing LLC. Campbell Wiener Inc. (Ventura) and The Home 
Improver LLC are regional THM publishers located in Southern California and Southwest Florida, respectively. Claire Lindsay, 
Annie Mullen, Barbara Robles, and Ellen Smith (the Individual Defendants) are employees of Antsel Marketing LLC, the 
Colorado Franchisee. "
579,3," The Amended Complaint alleges that there was a conspiracy among THM entities to spread false statements about 
competitors, giving rise to antitrust claims on two levels: the seven counties comprising the Denver area (Denver Market) and 
the entire United States (the National Market). "
582,4," Needless to say, these voluminous and duplicative briefs may have been more straightforward had the Defendants combined 
their Motions. "
585,5," Though GoDabo laments the high cost of producing magazines as a significant barrier to enter the market, entry barriers are 
factors that prevent rivals from timely responding to an increase in price above the competitive level, such as regulatory 
requirements. Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 51. The mere cost of capital is not a barrier to entry. "
586,6," GoDabo's formulation of the National Market is also not plausible. None of the Defendants sells advertising space to home-
improvement contractors on a national level. The National Franchisor sells franchises, not advertising space. Home Mag Holding 
licenses intellectual property, and though it owns some THM operations, none of those markets advertising space on a national 
level. The Colorado Franchisee only markets advertising space in Colorado. The Amended Complaint is thus overbroad for 
purposes of the National Market. "
588,7," In Pure, the Tenth Circuit's conception of the elements of a false-advertising claim includes the likelihood of confusion or 
mistake over product characteristics, which is clearly derived from § 1125(a)(1)(A). Subsection (A) pertains to trademark-
infringement claims. Tracing Tenth Circuit precedent, Pure's conception of the false-advertising elements originated from a 
treatise. See Cottrell Ltd. v. Biotrol Int'l Inc., 191 F.3d 1248, 1252 (10th Cir. 1999) (citing Charles E. McKenney & George F. 
Long III, Federal Unfair Competition: Lanham Act § 43(a) § 6 (11th ed. 1998)). Section 6 of this treatise does not cover 
subsection (A); indeed, the entire section covers subsection (B). Its conception of the false-advertising elements makes no 
reference to the likelihood of confusion. McKenney & Long, supra, § 6.3. For these reasons, the Court has modified the false-
advertising elements to remove any reference to likelihood of confusion in accordance with McCarthy's treatise. As a result, the 
Defendants' arguments that the alleged false statements do not bear on the likelihood of confusion are inapposite. (See, e.g., # 
42 at 19-20.)"
588,8, The only allegation addressing interstate commerce follows: 
589,," Defendants are involved in, and their anticompetitive, tortious, and illegal conduct described herein substantially affects 
interstate trade and commerce, including, but not limited to the use of US Mail for the direct mailing of marketing materials; 
the purchase of printed marketing materials and components from out of state for shipment to Colorado and across state 
lines for further mailing; the payment of franchise fees from Defendant THM Front Range in Colorado to Defendant THM 
Management, LLC in Florida; the operation of corporate owned magazines in numerous different states by THM Holding, 
the entry into franchise agreements and coordination of franchise operations across state lines; and the use of interstate 
wire and banking services to facilitate all of the above. (# 21 ¶ 14.) "
592,1," The court admonishes both parties for violating the court's Standing Order for Civil Cases. The parties are reminded that they 
are required to read and comply with the Standing Order and the Civil Local Rules. Going forward, the court will strike non-
compliant filings."
592,2," The court has filed this order under seal because it contains material subject to sealing orders. Within seven days of the filing 
date of this order, the parties shall provide the court a stipulated redacted version of this order, redacting only those portions of 
the order containing or referring to material for which the court has granted a motion to seal and for which the parties still request 
the material be sealed. The court will then issue a redacted version of the order. "
594,3," Despite both parties referring to this table in their supporting papers, it appears Orion mistakenly failed to file it with the motion. 
At the court's request, Orion filed the table at a later date. "
602,1," 28 U.S.C. § 517 does not create a right for the Government to appear and submit argument in any case in which the United 
States articulates an interest in the development and correct application of the law. United States ex rel. Ruckh v. Salus Rehab., 
No. 8:11-cv-1303, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63325, 2017 WL 1495862 (M.D. Fla. Apr. 26, 2017). Cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a) 
(empowering the Government to intervene in a federal court action that questions the constitutionality of an Act of Congress 
affecting the public interest). The Government's briefing and participation at oral argument, while siding with Oscar, was 
unhelpful to the resolution of the issues at bar."
602,2," The Court finds the complained-of conduct is immune from antitrust scrutiny under the McCarran-Ferguson Act and will not 
reach the merits of whether Plaintiff has adequately pled claims under the Sherman Act and the Florida Antitrust Act."
602,3," This account of the facts comes from Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (Doc. 75). The Court accepts these factual allegations as 
true when considering motions to dismiss. See Williams v. Bd. of Regents, 477 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir. 2007). "
603,4," Pursuant to Fla. Stat. § 542.20, ""[a]ny activity or conduct . . . exempt from the provisions of the antitrust laws of the United 
States is exempt from the provisions of this chapter [542]."" Accordingly, if the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption applies, Fla. 
Stat. § 542.20 requires dismissal of the state law antitrust claims. Jet 1 Ctr., Inc. v. City of Naples Airport Auth. (In re Jet 1 Ctr., 
Inc.), 322 B.R. 182, 197 (M.D. Fla. 2005); see also Golta, Inc. v. Greater Orlando Aviation Auth., 761 F. Supp. 778 (M.D. Fla. 
1991)."
603,5," ""Congress hereby declares that the continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the business of insurance is in 
the public interest, and that silence on the part of the Congress shall not be construed to impose any barrier to the regulation or 
taxation of such business by the several States."" 15 U.S.C. § 1011. "
604,6," ""The legislative history of the proviso clause indicates that Congress never intended state insurance department regulation of 
some insurance company activities to be enough to completely oust the federal antitrust laws for all activities. Otherwise a gap 
would exist where neither federal nor state law applied, and the public would be left wholly unprotected."" Charles D. Weller, The 
McCarran-Ferguson Act's Antitrust Exemption for Insurance: Language, History and Policy, 1978 DUKE L.J. 587, 607 (1978)."
604,7," ""The issue is difficult to resolve because the Act does not define 'business of insurance,' and the legislative history is 
ambiguous."" Alan M. Anderson, Insurance and Antitrust Law: The McCarran—Ferguson Act and Beyond, 25 WILLIAM & 
MARY L.R. 81, 89-90 (1983) (citing 91 CONG. REC. 480 (1945) (remarks of Sen. Murdock) (suggesting that the 'business of 
insurance' is synonymous with 'insurance companies'))."
604,8," ""The process of deciding what is and is not the 'business of insurance' is inherently a case-by-case problem."" Royal Drug, 440 
U.S. at 252. "
605,9," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding 
precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down before October 1, 1981). Thompson was decided May 4, 1981, 
and is therefore binding precedent. "
606,10," The court cited to SEC v. National Sec., Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 89 S. Ct. 564, 21 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1969), for the proposition that ""the 
fixing of rates is part of [the] business [of insurance]"" and ""[t]he selling and advertising of policies and the licensing of companies 
and their agents are also within the scope of the statute."" Thompson, 644 F.2d at 442-43 (citations omitted). Oscar concedes 
Florida Blue's brokers are instrumental in selling policies of insurance."
606,11," Sanger's complaint alleged that ""HUB violated federal and state antitrust law when, by entering into exclusive arrangements 
with the companies willing to underwrite these policies, it prevented competitors from brokering veterinary insurance policies."" 
Sanger, 802 F.3d at 736."
606,12," Unlike Florida, Texas antitrust law does not incorporate the McCarran-Ferguson exemption. See Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code § 
15.05(g) (""[T]he McCarran-Ferguson Act does not serve to exempt activities under this Act."" (citation omitted)). Therefore, the 
Fifth Circuit held that ""[w]hether HUB is entitled to the exemption thus has no effect on Sanger's state antitrust claims."" Sanger, 
802 F.3d at 742. "
607,13," The Ninth Circuit distinguished this case from the agreement providing peer review of chiropractors' fees in Pireno and the 
agreement between the insurer and pharmacists to offer low cost drugs in Royal Drug, holding that those practices are aimed 
solely at cutting insurers' costs—the business of insurers—and had nothing to do with the allocation of risk—the business of 
insurance. Feinstein, 714 F.2d at 932."
607,14," The Department of Justice argues that Thompson does not survive Pireno [**16] . (Doc. 89, p. 11). The Department also 
contends that Thompson did not discuss Pireno's factors on whether a practice is an integral part of the policy relationship. (Id.). 
However, Gilchrist and Sanger were decided in 2004 and 2015, respectively, long after Pireno, and neither criticize the 
reasoning in Thompson. Similarly, the First Circuit decided Arroyo-Melecio v. Puerto Rican American Insurance, 398 F.3d 56, 68 
(1st Cir. 2005), after Pireno and Royal Drug, and observed that Royal Drug left open the question of whether the business of 
insurance includes dealings within the insurance industry between insurers and agents. The Department of Justice is too quick 
to dismiss binding precedent, and this Court declines to follow suit. "

610,16," Oscar cites a portion of a statement by the Florida Department of Financial Services (""DFS"") in the Amended Complaint. The 
Court agrees with Florida Blue that the entire text of the communication does not support Oscar's claim that Florida law does not 
govern the insurer's agency relationship with its brokers. (Doc. 81, p. 12). "
611,17," ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall render the . . . Sherman Act inapplicable to any agreement to boycott, coerce, or

611,18," Exclusivity agreements were also present in Sanger Insurance Agency, and insurers declined to do business with Sanger due 
to their exclusive arrangement with HUB. 802 F.3d at 734. See also Thompson v. New York Life Ins., 644 F.2d at 444; Arroyo-
Melecio, 398 F.3d at 68. "
612,19," Oscar and Florida Blue disagree over whether § 1013(b) requires concerted action for coercion, with the Government siding 
with Oscar. (Doc. 81, pp. 13-15; Doc. 86, pp. 8-11; Doc. 89, pp. 13-16). The Court will not address this dispute, having found 
that the challenged activity—enforcement of a contractual relationship—does not meet the definition of coercion even assuming 
concerted action is not required. "
617,1, Individuals receiving food stamps generally access those benefits through EBT cards. 
619,2," For example, the Complaint alleges: [P]ursuant to 31 U.S.C. § 5103,] ""United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of 
Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender . . . ."" If I have enough coins to pay for a transaction without a 
cheque, case or card, it suffices and as a result is resolute with the constitutional requirements for transactions; without 
coins, cheque or cash, it suffices with a card and without a cheque, it suffices with either of the aforementioned list and 
according to [15 U.S.C. §] 13(b) alluding to services, it states ""Upon proof being made, at any hearing on a complaint under 
this section, that there has been discrimination in price or services or facilities furnished, the burden of rebutting the prima-
facie case thus made by showing justification shall be upon the person charged with a violation of this section . . . by 
showing that his lower price or the furnishing of services or facilities to any purchaser or purchasers was made in good faith 
to meet an equally low price of a competitor, or the services or facilities furnished by a competitor"" with respects to 
Card [*9]  payments as either a Legal Tender or a Conveyor thereof reconciling the constraints imposed on an Electronic 
Benefit Transfer (EBT) as opposed to a Debit Card, Credit Card or any other forms of card payment carrying the same 
functionality in serving as a quantity negating Legal Tender measure or a Legal Tender resulting in a discrimination in 
services and trade. Now, this argument isn't to excise the coinage or the legal tender act but to affirm the continuity of those 
acts as legal tenders and if they are indeed deemed legal tenders in its transactional obligations, then it is assumed to be a 
legal tender. . . . ECF No. 1. at PageID #7. "
626,1," ""The eight factors are: (1) strength of the trademark; (2) similarity of the marks; (3) proximity of the products and their

632,2," Armor All also argues that the addition of claims related to these statements in the Second Amended Complaint ""blatantly 
exceeded [TSI's] narrow leave to amend."" Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 102 at 22-23. Armor All filed a motion to strike, ECF No.

on March 12, 2019. Order, ECF No. 113; see Tr., ECF No. 148. For the same reasons expressed during that conference, the 
Court considers the false advertising claims regarding these statements properly alleged in the Second Amended Complaint. "

644,7," Ascertainability is typically a ""necessary prerequisite"" of a Rule 23(b)(3) class. Byrd v. Aaron's Inc., 784 F.3d 154, 162 (3d Cir. 
2015), as amended (Apr. 28, 2015). In this case, however, the Third Circuit has concluded that ascertainability is not a proper 
basis to deny certification. See ORDER of USCA, ECF No. 241. "
646,8," In 2003, Congress amended Rule 23 to include subdivision 23(g), which provides a non-exhaustive list of factors for a court to 
consider when scrutinizing the adequacy of class counsel's representation. See Fed R. Civ. P. 23(g). The addition was meant to 
transfer the analysis of class counsel's representation from Rule 23(a)(4), where it had little textual support, to Rule 23(g). See 1 
William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions § 3.80 (5th ed.). Rule 23(g) ""builds on"" the existing 23(a)(4) jurisprudence 
instead of ""introducing an entirely new element into the class certification process."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g) advisory 
committee's notes (2003 amendments). Accordingly, the Third Circuit continues to apply the factors relied on prior to the addition 
of Rule 23(g). See Drennan v. PNC Bank, NA (In re Comty. Bank of N. Va. & Guaranty Nat'l Bank of Tallahassee Second Mortg. 
Loan Litig.), 622 F.3d 275, 304-05 (3d Cir. 2010); In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., 418 F.3d 277, 307 (3d Cir. 2005). Class Counsel's 
representation of the Class satisfies both Rule 23(a)(4) and 23(g). "
650,9," Although the parties only engaged in limited formal discovery, the presumption of fairness may apply without any formal 
discovery. NFL Concussion Litig., 821 F.3d at 436-37. ""In some cases, informal discovery will be enough for class counsel to 
assess the value of the class' claims and negotiate a settlement that provides fair compensation."" Id."
650,10," Effective December 1, 2018, Rule 23(e)(2) was amended to include the following considerations to guide a court's 
determination of the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of a settlement, whether: (A) the class representatives and class counsel have adequately represented the class; (B) the proposal was negotiated at arm's length; (C) the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account: (i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; (ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief to the class, including the method of processing 
class-member claims; (iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney's fees, including timing of payment; and (iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and (D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2). The Advisory Committee Notes recognize that prior to the addition in Rule 23(e)(2) of these explicit 
factors to consider, circuit courts had developed their own lists of factors to determine whether a settlement was fair, reasonable, 
and adequate. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2) advisory committee's notes (2018 amendments). Moreover, the Advisory Committee "
651,," Notes explain: ""The goal of this amendment is not to displace any factor, but rather to focus the court and the lawyers on the 
core concerns of procedure and substance that should guide the decision whether to approve the proposal."" Id. Notwithstanding 
the amendment of Rule 23(e)(2), the Third Circuit continues to advise district courts to assess the fairness, reasonableness, and 
adequacy of a settlement applying the Girsh factors, the relevant Prudential considerations, and the Baby Products direct benefit 
consideration. See Google, 934 F.3d at 329. Following this guidance from the Third Circuit, this Court will apply the Girsh 
factors, the relevant Prudential [**29]  considerations, and the Baby Products direct benefit consideration to determine whether 
to approve the Settlement, with the understanding that these factors and considerations amply address ""the core concerns and 
procedure and substance"" listed in the amended Rule 23(e)(2). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2) advisory committee's notes (2018 
amendments). "
654,11," Ascertainability is typically a ""necessary prerequisite"" of a Rule 23(b)(3) class. Byrd, 784 F.3d at 162. ""The ascertainability 
inquiry is two-fold, requiring a plaintiff to show that: (1) the class is defined with reference to objective criteria; and (2) there is a 
reliable and administratively feasible mechanism for determining whether putative class members fall within the class definition."" 
Id. at 163 (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Comcast lacks records for most Former Subscribers, Comcast may have 
contested, if this case proceeded toward trial, whether a reliable and administratively feasible method exists to determine if its 
Former Subscribers fall within the class definition. "
656,12," An agreement by the defendant not to object to a plaintiff's fee request if it is under a certain dollar amount ""is often referred to 
as a 'clear sailing provision' (probably because the implication is that the fee request stands a much better chance of court 
approval if the defendant is not objecting)."" NFL Concussion Litig., 821 F.3d at 447. The Third Circuit has ""declin[ed] to hold that 
clear sailing provisions are per se bars to settlement approval while nonetheless emphasizing that they deserve careful scrutiny 
in any class action settlement."" Id. In a settlement involving a clear sailing provision, the Third Circuit has instructed a district 
court to ""review the process and substance of the settlement and satisfy itself that the agreement does not indicate collusion or 
otherwise pose a problem."" Id. Here, the Settlement Agreement was negotiated at arm's length and there is no indication of 
collusion or any other problem."
656,13," Class Counsel seeks $91,604.42 for reimbursement of expenses. Thus, Class Counsel seeks $1,008,395.58 in attorneys' 
fees. ""Counsel for a class action is entitled to reimbursement of expenses that were adequately documented and reasonably and 
appropriately incurred in the prosecution of the class action."" In re Safety Components, Inc. Sec. Litig., 166 F. Supp. 2d 72, 108 
(D.N.J. 2001); see also Mayer v. Driver Solutions, LLC, No. 10-1939, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 117556, 2012 WL 3578856, at *5 
(E.D. Pa. Aug. 17, 2012). Because reimbursement of $91,604.42 in litigation expenses is reasonable, the focus will be on 
Plaintiffs' request for attorneys' fees. "
660,14," Admittedly, Class Counsel had ""a significant financial incentive to cut its losses and settle the lawsuits,"" Baby Prods., 708 F.3d 
at 180 n.14, but settlement also made strategic sense given several significant hurdles to successful litigation, including the 
substantial risk that many potential Class Members would be required to resolve their claims in individual arbitration. "
663,1," This Court previously held that the MEC is an independent legal entity that may be sued. See Nahas v. Shore Med. Ctr., Civ. 
No. 13-6537, 2018 WL 1981474 (D.N.J. Apr. 27, 2018) "
664,2," In July 2006, both SMC's Credentials Committee and the MEC voted to deny Plaintiff's application for privileges. (Doc. 214-1, 
Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Material Fact (""Pl. SOF"") ¶2-3.) Plaintiff appealed to a Fair Hearing Panel (""FHP"") composed 
of three physicians, which in October 2006 found in favor of Plaintiff. The MEC then appealed the FHP's decision to the 
Appellate Review Panel; in January 2007, the Review Panel reversed the FHP's favorable recommendation, and instead 
recommended that an independent reviewer make a recommendation. (Pl. SOF ¶7.) SMC's Board of Trustees adopted this 
recommendation; however, since Plaintiff did not agree to SMC's condition that the outside reviewer's determination would be 
binding, SMC terminated the 2006 application. (Pl. SOF ¶9.)"
664,3," The Credentials Committee met in December 2009 to consider Plaintiff's application, but because it could not determine how 
many procedures he had completed, it recommended that the MEC or an outside party make a determination. (Pl. SOF ¶64.) In 
May 2010, the MEC made an adverse recommendation on Plaintiff's 2009 application. Plaintiff requested a fair hearing at which, 
under the SMC bylaws, a Fair Hearing Officer would determine whether the MEC's adverse recommendation was ""arbitrary, 
capricious, or not supported by credible evidence."" (Pl. SOF ¶76.) The August 27, 2012 decision of the Fair Hearing Officer held 
that Plaintiff did not meet the 2005 Criteria, and accordingly, that the MEC's adverse recommendation was not without merit. "
665,4," Even in Plaintiff's own Statement of Facts (Doc. 214-1), he admits, ""the Hearing Officer unilaterally modified the issue to be 
whether Dr. Nahas had satisfied the March 31, 2009 court-ordered criteria, notwithstanding that the Medical Executive 
Committee had used different criteria."" (Pl. SOF ¶81.) Thus, regardless of what criteria had been debated before, the effective 
denial of Plaintiff's 2009 application by the Fair Hearing Officer was based on the state court-ordered 2005 Criteria. This court 
previously made such a finding in Nahas v. Shore Med. Ctr., Civ. No. 13-6537, 2016 WL 1029362, at *9 (D.N.J. Mar. 15, 2016), 
and it remains consistent here."
665,5," Plaintiff argued that his performance of unauthorized procedures was inadvertent, as Defendants had not clearly delineated 
between procedures considered vascular and those considered endovascular. (Def. SOF ¶7-9.)"
665,6," The state court case in which Plaintiff brought the complaint about his 2011 suspension was consolidated into his earlier state 
court action challenging the denial of his 2006 application. (Def. SOF ¶38-39.) "
666,7," Plaintiff's original complaint contained additional claims, but those were dismissed by this court in Nahas v. Shore Med. Ctr., 
Civ. No. 13-6537, 2016 WL 1029362 (D.N.J. Mar. 15, 2016). The list here contains the claims in the operative complaint, 
Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 45, hereinafter ""SAC""). "
667,8," The Court does not discuss the parties' res judicata and collateral estoppel arguments here, as it is clear that summary 
judgment is warranted for Defendants on other grounds. This case has been litigated piecemeal over the past 13 years in both 
state and federal courts, and this Court finds it unnecessary to trace each relevant fact to the proceeding in which it may or may 
not have been previously litigated when doing so will not affect the outcome of this case. As Plaintiff's federal claims fail on the 
merits, the Court will instead focus on that analysis. See e.g., Johnson v. City of Philadelphia, Civ. No. 07-3110, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 98738, 2010 WL 3582517, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 10, 2010) (""Because the Court is satisfied that Plaintiff's claims are 
clearly barred. . . it declines to waste precious judicial resources explaining to Plaintiff why his claims would fail under many of 
the aforementioned theories.""). "
677,9," The only direct evidence of racial discrimination is a statement allegedly made by Defendant Galler referring to Plaintiff in his 
statement, ""we got one Arab guy named Nahas, Lebanese guy."" (Pl. Dep. at 148.) While this shows one individual defendant's 
awareness of Plaintiff's race and national origin, it is far from sufficient to show discriminatory intent or motivation. "
679,10," Having litigated this case in state court for approximately a decade, the parties are more than familiar with the state court 
system. As this Court no longer has an independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction, the state court presents a more 
appropriate place for Plaintiff to bring these claims. "
689,1," See also generally Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009) (""Where a complaint pleads 
facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of 
entitlement to relief."") (internal quotation marks omitted). "
690,2," Align apparently opposes the opportunity to amend. (See D.I. 12 at 19-20) However, the Court is not convinced that 
amendment would cause undue prejudice or would be futile. Allowing one opportunity for amendment is appropriate. "
692,1," The Court notes that the Class has not been certified. References to the ""Class"" are for purposes of convenience in addressing 
the allegations in the Complaint."
692,2," As will be discussed herein, the Complaint improperly groups the various Defendants together, often referring to them as 
""Defendants"" or ""Broker Defendants."" The Court does its best to distinguish the allegations with respect to each individual party 
while still accurately describing the allegations as framed in the Complaint. "
693,3," Before 2017, the Policies listed ""Monarch E & S Insurance Services"" as the point of contact. Compl. ¶ 31. After SPG acquired 
Monarch in 2017, the Policies listed ""Monarch E & S Insurance Services, Division of SPG Insurance Solutions."" Compl. ¶ 31; 
see also ECF Nos. 30-3 & 30-4."
693,4," HPIA coverage is ""available to persons who are unable to obtain basic property insurance in the private market from a licensed 
insurer."" Compl. ¶ 50 (citing HRS § 431:21-110). The Hawai'i Legislature, in creating HPIA, explained the policy underlying the 
program: ""The purpose of this Act is to create an entity which will provide appropriately priced basic property insurance for 
owners and occupants of property in high risk areas for major natural disasters. This extraordinary action is being taken to 
provide limited relief to meet the unique and pressing needs of these persons who are currently unable to obtain any property 
insurance."" 1991 Haw. Sess. Laws Act 284 § 2. "
697,5," The cases that Plaintiffs cite to argue that their bad faith and unjust enrichment claims should be reviewed under Rule 8(a) are 
inapposite. See Opp. Br. 5 (citing Sunday's Child, LLC v. Irongate AZREP BW LLC, No. 13-cv-00502-DKW-RLP, 2017 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 19565, 2017 WL 561338, at *6 (D. Haw. Feb. 10, 2017); Aloha Petroleum, Ltd. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, 
PA, No. 13-cv-00296-DKW-RLP, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92660, 2014 WL 3359933, at *3-5 (D. Haw. July 8, 2014)). Neither of 
the complaints in those cases involved any allegations of deceit, fraud, or fraud-related conduct such that Rule 9(b) would apply 
to even some of the allegations."
697,6," It is well established in the Ninth Circuit that Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement applies to state-law causes of action. See 
Vess, 317 F.3d at 1103; Smallwood, 730 F. Supp. 2d 1213, 1232 (D. Haw. 2010). "
698,7," This includes Count VII for declaratory judgment, which merely seeks declaratory relief based on the same fraudulent conduct 
alleged throughout the Complaint. See Compl. ¶¶ 150-54. "
700,8," Notwithstanding the Complaint's shortcomings under Rule 9(b), the Court reiterates its statement made at the hearing that the 
circumstances here are concerning. It is difficult to understand how Plaintiffs—residents of designated, high-risk lava zones—
could have ended up with homeowner's insurance policies expressly excluding the coverage that they presumably sought. It is 
equally troubling that Plaintiffs were allegedly not made aware that they may have qualified for non-surplus lines insurance, 
including under the HPIA program, which may have provided coverage for at least some of the losses Plaintiffs now face. That 
said, these concerns are not enough under Rule 9(b), and any amended complaint must comply with the Federal Rules. "
701,9," Although Underwriters also argue that the Complaint errs by failing to include allegations singling out each individual Lloyd's 
syndicate, such specificity is not required at this stage. As Plaintiffs explain in their Opposition Brief, Lloyd's operates such that 
""multiple syndicates agree to insure part of a risk on identical terms."" Opp. Br. 11 (quoting In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 
2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136684, 2017 WL 3642003, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. 23, 2017)). Thus, to the extent that Plaintiffs are alleging 
identical conduct by the similarly-situated group of Underwriters, they need not make individual allegations as to each separate 
syndicate to satisfy Rule 9(b). See In re Ins. Brokerage, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136684, 2017 WL 3642003 at *9 n.9. Moreover, 
much of the information relevant to each individual syndicate presumably is in Underwriters' possession, relaxing the Rule 9(b) 
requirements. "
702,10," Counts V (breach of fiduciary duties) and VI (negligence) also rely on Section 301 violations, but these counts are alleged 
solely against Broker Defendants. Compl. ¶¶ 138, 142. "
703,11," HRS § 480-1 defines ""consumer"" as ""a natural person who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, purchases, 
attempts to purchase, or is solicited to purchase goods or services or who commits money, property, or services in a personal 
investment."" Underwriters have not disputed that Plaintiffs are ""consumers."" "
704,12," Nothing in the forthcoming discussion should be construed as a final determination on the merits. The Court is merely 
analyzing the legal issues raised by Underwriters' Motion to Dismiss and opining on these alternative arguments for dismissal. 
By implication of the Court's ruling that the Complaint fails to comply with the federal pleading rules, additional factual allegations 
are needed to move forward with any claim. Whether such claims are legally viable based upon facts that might eventually be 
alleged is a question the Court cannot answer today. "
706,13," The Ninth Circuit in Spinner Corp. v. Princeville Dev. Corp., 849 F.2d 388, 390 (9th Cir. 1988) noted in passing that UDAP 
""specifically exempts certain groups and activities from its coverage such as . . . insurance transactions."" But that is all the court 
had to say, and the case focused on whether securities transactions were similarly exempt. See id."
706,14," The court in Jenkins did not expressly address the possible effect of § 480-11(b) on a UDAP cause of action in the insurance 
context, even though the statutory language was identical to the language in effect today. "
707,15," In addressing an additional claim brought under HRS § 480-2, the court noted that the defendants' conduct had ""complie[d] 
with state and federal hazardous waste laws."" Paragon, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75105, 2009 WL 2700278 at *6. This, among 
other findings, led the court to reject the plaintiff's UDAP claim. See id. Paragon did not involve insurance transactions such to 
implicate HRS § 480-11(b), but the observation that the defendant had complied with state and federal law is indicative of the 
specific-conduct approach. "
709,16," Of course, this example is only relevant to admitted insurers transacting in the traditional, non-surplus lines market. As 
discussed, surplus lines insurance is not regulated in the same way and is provided by non-admitted insurers who need not 
obtain approval for the rates, forms, and underwriting rules. See Compl. ¶ 41; see also HRS § 431:8-301 (allowing surplus lines 
insurance to be placed with unauthorized insurers under certain conditions)."
709,17," The Court notes, however, that Plaintiffs may face some difficulty in future pleadings to the extent that they are trying to 
attribute Broker Defendants' conduct to Underwriters. The specific-conduct approach asks whether the specific conduct of the 
defendant entitles it to a safe harbor. As currently framed, the Complaint arguably does not allege viable Insurance Code 
violations against Underwriters—only Broker Defendants. "
710,18," The JUP provides public assistance to individuals who cannot otherwise obtain insurance. Willis, 129 Haw. at 482-83, 304 
P.3d at 623-24. It operates in the form of a risk-pooling arrangement and was created by statute, HRS § 431:10C-401."
710,19," At least one judge in this district has recognized—in dicta—that ""[a] party cannot breach the covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing before a contract is formed."" Fabian v. Guild Mortg. Co., no. 13-00585 LEK-KSC, 2014 WL 12573004, at *11-12 (D. 
Haw. Feb. 11, 2014) (quoting Contreras v. Master Fin., Inc., No. 3:10-cv-0477-LRH-VPC, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 996, 2011 WL 
32513, at *3 (D. Nev. Jan. 4, 2011)). However, that case involved a loan contract, so it did not implicate the statutory framework 
essentially codifying the broad duty of good faith in the insurance context. Id. "
711,20," Unlike the circumstances here, Simmons involved a third-party injured claimant bringing a bad-faith claim against an insurer. "
713,21," Although, as discussed, Rule 9(b) is the relevant standard here for factual allegations of fraud, Rule 8 contains the general 
rules of pleading, which includes permitting pleading in the alternative."
713,22," On this point, Underwriters argue that the Policies and the parallel coverage litigation pending in state court preclude the 
unjust enrichment claim in this case. Mot. Dismiss 29. Indeed, it is well-settled in this circuit that ""equitable remedies are not 
available when an express contract exists between the parties concerning the same subject matter."" Soule, 1 F. Supp. 3d at 
1102 (quoting Swartz, 911 F. Supp. 2d at 938). However, it is not clear that the relief sought in this lawsuit is necessarily 
predicated on the terms of the insurance contracts. At the least, the Policies may not ""fully address the injustice."" See Porter, 
116 Haw. at 55, 169 P.3d at 1007 (affirming circuit court's ruling imposing equitable remedy because restitution may be 
appropriate ""where an express contract does not fully address an injustice""). The Policies establish rights and obligations with 
respect to coverage; whereas Plaintiffs' allegations in this lawsuit focus on Defendants profiting from their misrepresentations 
and manipulation of the contract-negotiation process. Accordingly, at this early stage, the Court would not dismiss Plaintiffs' 
unjust enrichment claim as precluded by the insurance Policies or the state-court coverage litigation."
713,23," It would not, as Plaintiffs argue, be premature to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim for failing to plead the lack of an 
adequate legal remedy. Plaintiffs rely on Sunday's Child, LLC v. Irongate AZREP BW LLC, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19565, 2017 
WL 561338, at *6-7 (D. Haw. Feb. 10, 2017), in which Judge Watson found dismissal of unjust enrichment at an early stage was 
not warranted. But in that case, it was not clear from the complaint whether the dispute could be ""answered entirely"" by the legal 
and contract claims. 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19565, [WL] at *6. And, notably, Judge Watson later rejected the unjust enrichment 
claim on summary judgment, citing Soule for the proposition that an inadequate remedy at law is a necessary prerequisite to an 
unjust enrichment claim. Sunday's Child, LLC v. Irongate AZREP BW LLC, 327 F. Supp. 3d 1322, 1341 (D. Haw. 2018), appeal 
filed Sept. 26, 2018. "
714,24," To be entitled to injunctive relief, a plaintiff must show ""(1) that it has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that the remedies 
available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of "
715,," hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be 
disserved by a permanent injunction."" eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391, 126 S. Ct. 1837, 164 L. Ed. 2d 641 
(2006). "
716,1," Reckitt is currently known as Indivior, Inc. In December 2014, Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was demerged from its 
prior parent, the Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, into Indivior PLC. Although Indivior is technically the named defendant in this 
case, the pleadings and many of the relevant exhibits use the name ""Reckitt."" To avoid confusion, I will refer to Defendant as 
""Reckitt."" "
717,2," Although a court should go beyond the complaint to determine whether a class should be certified, a plaintiff has no obligation 
to establish the merits of the case at the certification stage. In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 311, 316 (3d 
Cir. 2008). For the sole purpose of understanding the premise of the present case, I will take the allegations of the operative 
complaints as true, but will engage in a more ""rigorous assessment"" of the available evidence when conducting class 
certification review. The Direct Purchasers' and the End Payors' Complaints contain almost identical allegations. To avoid confusion, the facts 
recited herein will be derived from the Direct Purchasers' consolidated Amended Complaint. Where the allegations in the 
complaints differ, I will distinguish accordingly. "
722,3," Aside from the Direct Purchasers and the End Payors, a group of States Attorneys General have pressed similar claims against 
Reckitt. As they do not require class analysis, I do not include them in the discussion here. "
726,4," The Third Circuit has admitted expert testimony on antitrust damages, while concurrently finding that the assumptions 
underlying the expert's damages calculations were unfounded and insufficient to support a finding of actual damage. See 
Stelwagon Mfg. Co. v. Tarmac Roofing Sys., Inc., 63 F.3d 1267, 1275 (3d Cir. 1995)."
726,5," Numerous courts have, since Comcast, declined to exclude an antitrust damages expert under Daubert, even where the 
expert's damages calculation relies on assumptions that could eventually be proven legally or factually inaccurate. See, e.g., In 
re Domestic Drywall Antitrust Litig., 322 F.R.D. 188, 234 (E.D. Pa. 2017) (holding that plaintiffs need not disaggregate each 
alleged anticompetitive action and isolate its effect; rather the defendants were free to argue at trial that damages were not 
attributable to a particular form of alleged anticompetitive action); Dial Corp. v. News Corp., 165 F. Supp. 3d 25, 38 (S.D.N.Y. 
2016) (""And if a jury were to find News Corp.'s actions taken as a whole to be a violation of Section Two of the Sherman Act, 
disaggregating the monopolist's lawful actions from its unlawful actions for the purpose of calculating damages may be "
727,," 'unnecessary, if not impossible.'""); Univac Dental Co. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., No. 07-493, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41130, 2010 WL 
1816745, at *3 (M.D. Pa. Apr. 27, 2010) (""[I]t is perfectly acceptable for an expert to calculate an estimated amount of damages 
without regard to causation or any other elements of liability. Indeed, in the antitrust context, plaintiffs enjoy a considerable 
amount of leeway in 'constructing a hypothetical world free of the defendant['s] exclusionary activities[.]"")."
727,6," In his rebuttal report, Dr. Lamb clarified that in the event Reckitt's pricing practices are deemed to be an improper part of the 
alleged anticompetitive scheme, he can recalculate aggregate class damages using actual generic prices paid by the class 
instead of the lower generic prices that would have been paid in the absence of Reckitt's scheme. (Lamb Rebuttal Report ¶¶ 
165-66.) "
730,7," These criteria included: (1) drugs for which there is a brand originator and a line extension marketed by the same manufacturer 
where the brand originator and the line extension are both orally-administered, solid, and small molecule prescription 
medications; (2) drugs for which the brand originator and the line extension share the same active ingredients; (3) drugs for 
which the line extension was launched between 2007 and 2012; (4) drugs for which the line extension was on the market without 
AB-rated generic competition for at least thirty months after its launch; and (5) drugs for which the line extension is not an orally-
disintegrating tablet or chewable (to eliminate remaining instances where the line extension is for a different target population 
than the brand originator). (Lamb Rebuttal Report ¶ 117.)"
730,8," Reckitt's contrary cases are distinguishable. For example, in Loeffel Steel Products, Inc. v. Delta Brands, Inc., 387 F. Supp. 2d 
794 (N.D. Ill. 2005), an expert in a breach of contract and breach of warranty case sought to offer an opinion on lost profits 
based on a model using comparable businesses in the area. Id. at 811-12. The expert admitted that he knew nothing about the 
respective geographic or product markets or customer bases of the eight comparator companies or the quality of service or any 
other relevant factor that would bear upon the question of comparability, other than spending some time on the internet. Id. at 
814-15. Finding that expert's report was ""junk science,"" the court excluded the opinion. Id. at 817. Eleven Line, Inc. v. North Texas State Soccer Ass'n, Inc., 213 F.3d 198 (5th Cir. 2000) involved antitrust issues, but did not 
address the admissibility of expert testimony. Rather, the Fifth Circuit admitted and considered the expert's testimony, but found 
that the plaintiffs had not satisfactorily proven damages because the expert's projections were not based on a satisfactory 
yardstick of performance by closely comparable businesses. Id. at 207-08. Ultimately, after allowing the expert to testify, the 
Court concluded that ""[d]amage assumptions that find no support in the actual facts of the case cannot support a verdict."" Id. at 
209. The case does not stand for the proposition that such expert testimony should be excluded under Daubert. "
737,9," The cases cited by Reckitt are inapposite. See In re Gen. Motors Corp. Pick-Up Fuel Tank Prods. Liabl. Litig., 55 F.3d 768, 
784-85 (3d Cir. 1995) (generally discussing certification of a settlement class and noting that ""the protection of the absentees' 
due process rights depends in part on the extent the named plaintiffs are adequately interested to monitor the attorneys""); Clair 
v. DeLuca, 232 F.R.D. 523 (W.D. Pa. 2006) (finding that although lead plaintiff's interests did not clearly align with the class, 
inasmuch as he could not recover his losses in the suit, court determined that based on his statements regarding his experience, 
education, and motivation to pursue the matter diligently on behalf of the class, he satisfied the adequacy prong of Rule 23). "
738,10," This recitation of the evidence does not account for any contrary evidence Reckitt may have to dispute these facts. That is 
because the sole inquiry here is whether Plaintiffs can adduce class-wide evidence in support of their claims. "
742,11," (See, e.g. Def.'s Oppn' DPPs' Class Cert., Ex. 50, 27:16-28:25 (Esper Treatment Center in Pennsylvania stocks Methadone, 
Subutex, and Zubsolv); Ex. 49, 20:3-25); Phoenix Health in Maryland stocks Suboxone Film, Zubsolv, Vivitrol, Sublocade, and 
Methadone); Ex. 51 (Acadia with clinics in ten stages stocks multiple different types of products including Suboxone).)"
742,12," (Id., Ex. 1 (""Norman Report"") ¶ 112.) Testimony from these clinics shows that each clinic employed different criteria for 
purchasing decisions. (See, e.g., Id., Ex. 49, 50:13-52:9 (Phoenix Health Center's prescribing decision has nothing to do with the 
individual, but rather whatever the state is willing to pay for); Ex. 48, 31:16-25 (purchasing decisions for Acadia is made at the 
local or regional level based on consumer demand, demographics, and what the community needs).) Notably, the representative for Acadia also testified decisions regarding what specific medications are purchased are made at 
the national level based on pricing concerns and what proposals they are given from various suppliers. (Def.'s Opp'n DPPs' 
Class Cert., Ex. 48, 44:4-19.)"
742,13," (See, e.g., Def.'s Opp'n DPP's Class Cert., Ex. 48, 24:6-25:17 (Acadia Clinics); Ex. 49, 58:19-59:18 (Phoenix Clinic); Ex. 50,

one of the clinics stopped buying film and started buying a different branded product when a staff member heard a rumor that 
patients were scraping the coat of the film off of their tongues and selling it. (Id. Ex. 50, 28:17-29:9.) "
743,16," (Def.'s Opp'n DPPs' Class Cert., Ex. 25, 15:8-19:14.)"

soon be withdrawn); Def.'s Opp'n DPPs' Class Cert., Ex. 54, 81:12-16 (Prime Therapeutics adds film to the formulary to 
""alleviat[e] member confusion."")"
743,19," (See Def.'s Opp'n DPPs' Class Cert., Ex. 56.) "
744,20," The fact that In re Warfarin involved certification of a settlement class rather than a litigation class is irrelevant because the 
Rule 23(b)(3) predominance standard applies equally to both settlement and litigation classes. See AmChem Prods, Inc. v. 
Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 622-23, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1997). "
745,21," Reckitt also points to precedent which states that the predominance requirement cannot be met in cases founded on alleged 
misrepresentations that are not shown to be ""standard, uniform, [or] scripted."" In re LifeUSA Holding, Inc., 242 F.3d 136, 146 (3d 
Cir. 2001) (holding, in case asserting class claims for fraudulent nondisclosures and misrepresentations regarding annuity 
contracts, that absence of any uniform misrepresentation made to plaintiffs precluded a finding of commonality or 
predominance). This argument is irrelevant here. In LifeUSA, the claims were for fraudulent nondisclosures and misrepresentations, which 
require, as an element of proof, that each of the class members relied on the misrepresentations. Id. at 145 n.9. Here, the claims 
are for antitrust violations, which have no reliance element, but simply require a showing that the anticompetitive conduct caused 
injury to the class members. "
746,22," In my prior opinion denying Reckitt's motion to dismiss, I found this theory to state a plausible claim for relief. In re Suboxone 
Antitrust Litig., 64 F. Supp. 3d 665, 683 n.9 (E.D. Pa. 2014)."
746,23," Notably, ""the inability to show injury as to a few does not defeat class certification where the plaintiffs can show widespread 
injury to the class."" Meijer, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Holdings Co. III, Ltd., 246 F.R.D. 293, 310 (D.D.C. 2007) (quotations omitted). "
749,24," Notably, both classes exclude: (1) Pharmacy Benefit Managers; (2) Defendant and their officers, directors, management, 
employees, subsidiaries, and affiliates; (3) all governmental entities, except for government funded employee benefit plans; (4) 
all persons or entities who purchased Suboxone for purposes of resale or directly from Defendant or its affiliates; and (5) the 
judges in this case and any members of their immediate families. "
753,25," The parties dispute whether this ascertainability requirement applies to a class under Rule 23(c)(4). Reckitt contends that such 
a class must be ascertainable to be certifiable. The EPPs counter that the ascertainability inquiry has no place in certification of 
an issues class. The parties have cited to no legal guidance on this issue, and the Third Circuit has yet to address whether ascertainability must 
be analyzed in Rule 23(c)(4) issues class. Because I find that the ascertainability requirements have been met, I need not 
resolve this question."
753,26," (See Reckitt's Opp'n EPPs' Class Cert., Ex. 1, Decl. of Nicolas Hidalgo (""Hidalgo Dep."").)"
753,27," The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (""HIPAA"") puts limitations on the ability of covered entities, such as 
health plans and health care providers, to use protected health information. Citizens for Health v. Leavitt, 428 F.3d 167, 173 (3d 
Cir. 2005). "
754,28," Reckitt's case citations in support of their argument are distinguishable. In Vista Healthplan, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., No. 06-
1833, 2015 WL 3623005 (E.D. Pa. June 10, 2015), the plaintiffs merely provided their own ""assurances"" that ""comprehensive 
records documenting any purchase of Provigil can be easily obtained from any number of reliable objective sources,"" without 
detailing any reliable methodology for identifying class members. Id. at *9. In Fenwick v. Ranbaxy Pharms., Inc., 353 F. Supp. 3d 
315, 327-28 (D.N.J. 2018), the plaintiffs proposed a methodology for identifying potential class members, but that methodology 
included within it consumers who did not purchase any of the recalled pills at issue. Id. at 327-28. Neither of these problems 
exists here."
754,29," See 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(e)(1) (""A covered entity may disclose protected health information in the course of any judicial or 
administrative proceeding: [i]n response to an order of a court or administrative tribunal, provided that the covered entity 
disclosed only the protected health information expressly authorized by such order.""). "
756,30," The cases Reckitt cites in support of its argument are distinguishable. In Romero v. Allstate Ins. Co., 52 F. Supp. 3d 715 (E.D. 
Pa. 2014), a non-antitrust case, the plaintiffs sought to invalidate a release on the grounds that it was void as part of an illegal 
transaction. Id. at 721. The plaintiffs requested issue certification on the question of whether the release was ""part and parcel"" of 
the underlying transaction being challenged, but not on the crucial issue of whether the transaction being challenged was, in 
fact, an independent violation of the law. Id. at 737. As such, the plaintiffs ""effectively concede[d] that certification of this issue 
would not create any efficiencies in the upcoming Release-related trial"" since there would need to be ""circuitous and duplicative 
testimony"" in the subsequent trials. Id. Here, by contrast, the common evidence for the anticompetitive conduct and market 
power portions of the EPPs' antitrust claim will not be relevant to antitrust impact or damages. Reckitt also cites to In re ConAgra Foods, Inc., 302 F.R.D. 537, 581 (C.D. Cal. 2014), where the court declined to certify a class 
to litigate whether the defendant misled consumers, finding that the plaintiffs would need to prove individualized reliance and 
causation such that the requested issue class would not necessarily even determine the defendant's liability. Id. at 581. That 
case, however, involved a claim of misleading marketing of a brand of cooking oils, made from GMOs as ""100% natural."" Id. at 
563. The court only denied certification of the issues class without prejudice, noting that ""[w]hile this is an issue that is common 
to all members of all proposed classes . . . it is unclear, at this stage, what ultimate objective certifying a class to try this issue 
would advance."" Id. at 581. "
757,31," Reckitt engages in a lengthy discussion about Patient X and what such an individual would need to prove in order to establish 
antitrust injury and damages. As the EPPs do not seek to certify a class as to injury or damages, I need not address this 
discussion."
757,32," Reckitt suggests that attempting to separate common and individual issues would not only be impractical, but also 
unconstitutional. It explains that issues classes implicate the Seventh Amendment when they would require juries at the 
individual trials to reexamine issues settled at the class trial. (Reckitt's Opp'n EPPs' Class Cert. 22 (citing Castano v. Am 
Tobacco Co., 84 F.3d 734, 750 (5th Cir. 1996); Hostetler v. Johnson Controls, Inc., No. 15-226, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 137872, 
2018 WL 3868848, at *87 (N.D. Ind. Aug. 15, 2018)). With little further explanation, Reckitt concludes that the division of issues 
here would violate the Seventh Amendment. I find no such Seventh Amendment concerns here. The Seventh Amendment provides that ""no fact tried by a jury, shall be 
otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."" U.S. Const., amend 
VII. Notably, Reckitt fails to identify any common issues that would have to reexamined and/or relitigated at any subsequent 
individual proceedings. Indeed, the issue of antitrust violation is ""so distinct and separable"" from the issue of antitrust impact that 
these issues ""can be cleanly divided amongst separate trials without injustice."" In re: Prograf Antitrust Litig., No. 11-2242, 2014 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138429, at *14 (D. Mass. June 10, 2014) (noting that litigation of an antitrust violation would focus entirely on 
the defendant's conduct and state of the product market, whereas, assuming such violation, a trial of antitrust impact and 
damages would involve fact-finding regarding whether a particular plaintiff made a purchase of the drug at a supracompetitive 
price and the amount of any overcharges incurred) (internal quotation marks and quotations omitted). "

764,3," One of Dry's declarations does not include an averment that it was made under penalty of perjury or that the facts it recites are

U.S.C. § 1746(1) and (2). AHAI has cited no rule that requires that I consider only sworn declarations, oaths, affidavits or the "

36, Ex. A, Tab 11 (2011 Hanman Dep. at 84-85) (""Q. [W]hen you were the CEO of DFA, did you consider processors direct 
competitors of DFA with regard to milk procurement? A. Yes.""). "
783,6," Professor Elhauge asserts that: ""Despite DFA's representations to the DOJ that it did not control NDH, DFA in fact had 
substantial control of NDH's operations[.]"" Ex. Z (Elhauge Rep. at ¶ 203 n.480) (citing DFA's 50% ownership of NDH with the 
other 50% held by ""3 seasoned dairy industry executives,"" one of whom represented in a meeting that he and then-DFA CEO 
Gary Hanman ""were NDH,"" as well as a September 2001 milk supply agreement whereby DFA would supply all of NDH's milk 
requirements, except for any existing contracts which would not be renewed) (internal citations and footnotes omitted). "
784,7," Professor Elhauge opines that these low prices do not negatively impact DFA because its financial performance as a 
cooperative depends only on the volume of raw Grade A milk sold by DFA members, not its price. "
785,8," Although both Plaintiffs and Professor Elhauge contend that the identified agreements are ""full supply agreements"" whereby 
DMS agreed to supply the processor with all the milk it requires, the terms of some of the agreements do not permit the court to 
make that determination without additional information."
785,9," Professor Elhauge describes DFA's agreement with Dean as follows: In 2015 defendants settled a class action that, similar to the present case, alleged that defendants [**43]  conspired to 
suppress farmer pay prices in Order 1. As part of that settlement, defendants agreed that they would not enter into any new "
786,," full supply agreements for four years. Nevertheless, in January 2017, DFA entered into a full supply agreement with Dean 
Foods for its Lansdale, Pennsylvania plant. The agreement, which became effective on February 1, 2017, was for a two 
year term. Prior to that agreement, Lansdale had received 60% of its milk from DFA and the other 40% from Maryland-
Virginia Milk Producers Cooperative Association (MDVA). Following the agreement, DFA took over full supply to the plant. Plaintiffs' Ex. Z (Elhauge Rep. at ¶ 214) (footnotes omitted)."
786,10," In his deposition, DMS's CEO Brad Keating could not identify any cooperatives or processors in the Northeast that were 
accepting new members or additional milk in 2017. Plaintiffs' SDF ¶ 79, Ex. A, Tab 8 (2018 Keating Dep. at 97-108). Likewise, a 
DFA board member testified that ""anybody who was looking to find an independent market to take them probably couldn't find 
one."" Plaintiffs' SDF ¶ 79, Ex. A, Tab 27 (Bikowsky Dep. at 170)."
786,11," In paragraphs 90-92 of the SDF, Plaintiffs proffer evidence of Defendants' threats to and retaliation against independent 
farmers who resisted pressure to join DFA/DMS. This evidence, which otherwise appears to consist of hearsay, may be 
admissible for its effect on the independent farmers' state of mind. See United States v. Dupree, 706 F.3d 131, 136 (2d Cir. 
2013) (""If the significance of an offered statement lies solely in the fact that it was made, no issue is raised as to the truth of 
anything asserted, and the statement is not hearsay. Thus, a statement offered to show its effect on the listener is not hearsay."") 
(citation, alteration, and internal quotation marks omitted). "
787,12," Professor Elhauge qualifies his opinion as follows: I am not claiming that DFA's farmer-members do not benefit from higher raw milk prices. I am merely noting that DFA's 
financial performance at the cooperative-entity-level (as reflected on DFA's own income statements) show that its raw milk 
sales profitability (at the cooperative-entity-level) is tied only to volume, not price. And that therefore, DFA's overall per-unit 
profitability (at the cooperative-entity-level) can only rise as raw milk prices fall. Plaintiffs' SDF ¶ 99, Ex. Z (Elhauge Rep. at ¶ 133 n.261). "
788,13," In 2001 then-DFA CEO Hallman ""played a role in arranging for the unauthorized transfer of money, to be paid through a DFA 
affiliate, to [a] former DFA Board Chairman [who] received $1,000,000. This transaction was not approved by DFA's Board of 
Directors."" Plaintiffs' SDF ¶ 112, Ex. VVV (internal quotation marks omitted). Rick Smith, DFA's current CEO, acknowledged that 
this was an ""inappropriate payment"" that violated DFA's policies. Id., Ex. A, Tab 1 at 36. An Area Council member similarly 
received unauthorized and improper payments for more than four years that were neither disclosed to nor approved by DFA's 
board. Id., Ex. WW at 28. "
789,14," Plaintiffs explain: ""Defendants' market share is a simple mathematical calculation that is derived from Defendants' own data -- 
the volume of non-organic raw milk (in pounds) pooled on Order 1 by Defendants, divided by the total volume of milk pooled on 
Order [1]."" (Doc. 102 at 40) (citing Plaintiffs' SDF ¶¶ 128-29). They further observe: ""Defendants have calculated their own 
market share in the Northeast as between 40% and 56% depending on the year."" Id. at 41 (citing Plaintiffs' SDF ¶ 133) 
(emphasis omitted). "
790,15," Defendants assert Plaintiffs are pursuing a ""new theory"" (Doc. 92 at 7) in which ""Miley boldly claim that DFA orchestrated a 
single conspiracy for the entire thirteen-year period at issue in this case among the cooperatives and processors that were also 
mentioned as conspirators in Allen."" Id. at 6. Plaintiffs counter that they are instead ""pursuing the same claims (supported by the 
same evidence) that the [c]ourt ruled were sufficient to proceed to trial in Allen]."" (Doc. 102 at 8.) Both parties are correct. 
Plaintiffs' claims have been winnowed from the claims presented in Allen and are supported by new and additional evidence 
explained in Professor Elhauge's 173-page expert witness report. Professor Elhauge reaches conclusions regarding the 
anticompetitive impact of some of Defendants' alleged anticompetitive conduct that the Allen class action plaintiffs' expert 
witness did not. However, in essence, Plaintiffs' claims are grounded in the same theories at issue in Allen—a multifaceted 
conspiracy that operates at both the cooperative and processor levels of the market. "
794,16," The Dickson dissent cited well-established authority for this conclusion. See Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 217 
(4th Cir. 2002) (Gregory, J., dissenting) (citing Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, 306 U.S. 208, 227, 59 S. Ct. 467, 83 L. 
Ed. 610 (1939) (""[I]t is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be and often is formed without simultaneous action or 
agreement on the part of the conspirators.""); United States v. Masonite Corp., 316 U.S. 265, 275, 62 S. Ct. 1070, 86 L. Ed. 1461, 
1942 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 777 (1942) (""Here, as in Interstate Circuit, . . . [i]t was enough that, knowing that concerted action was 
contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it""); United States v. Tillett, 763 
F.2d 628, 632 (4th Cir. 1985) (stating that plaintiff must show that each alleged conspirator ""participated in the conspiracy with 
knowledge of the essential nature of the plan"")). "
795,17," The Ninth Circuit considered Dickson in William O. Gilley Enterprises, Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 561 F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 
2009) (""Gilley I""), an opinion it withdrew and superseded when it determined that the plaintiffs' claims were barred by res 
judicata. See William O. Gilley Enters., Inc. v. Ad Richfield Co., 588 F.3d 659 (9th Cir. 2009) (""Gilley II""). Although of no 
precedential value in the Ninth Circuit or elsewhere, the Ninth Circuit's Gilley I decision concluded that the aggregation of claims 
involving multiple participants is permissible and that ""Dickson is distinguishable from the present case, as the plaintiffs here do 
expressly allege that each Defendant's agreements considered in the aggregate have anticompetitive effects."" Gilley I, 561 F.3d 
at 1012. This case presents the same grounds for distinguishing Dickson. "
796,18," See United States v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290, 324, 317 (2d Cir. 2015) (observing that ""[a] horizontal conspiracy can use 
vertical agreements to facilitate coordination without the other parties to those agreements knowing about, or agreeing to, the 
horizonal conspiracy's goals"" and noting that ""[a]ntitrust law has never required identical motives among conspirators when their 
independent reasons for joining together lead to collusive action."") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)."
796,19," In Professor Elhauge's deposition, Defendants' counsel pressed him to identify either a ""single, unitary conspiracy"" or 
""separate conspiracies with separate parties."" He instead explained: Q. And you call it a multifaceted conspiracy. Is it a single, unitary conspiracy, or is it separate conspiracies with separate 
parties? . . . A. I mean, it's an overarching conspiracy. It has different component parts including, as I lay out, the agreement not to 
solicit farmers, agreement to exchange price information, the full supply agreements, and the payments not to compete for 
dairy farmers. So there's all different parts of it. But DFA and DMS are involved in all those parts of the conspiracy. Plaintiffs' SDF ¶ 10, Ex. A, Tab 33 (2018 Elhauge Dep. at 54). "
801,20," ""Where intent of the accused is an ingredient of the [violation] charged, its existence is a question of fact which must be 
submitted to the jury."" Morissette v. United States, 342 U.S. 246, 274, 72 S. Ct. 240, 96 L. Ed. 288 (1952). Likewise, ""[t]he 
determination [of] whether a dangerous probability of success exists is a particularly fact-intensive inquiry."" United States v. 
Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 80, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001). "
802,21," As Defendants' Capper-Volstead Act argument was raised for the first time in Defendants' Reply, the court does not analyze 
each alleged anticompetitive agreement and determine whether it reflects legitimate or predatory means. Fairdale Farms, Inc. v. 
Yankee Milk, Inc., 635 F.2d 1037, 1045 (2d Cir. 1980); see also Keefe ex rel. Keefe v. Shalala, 71 F.3d 1060, 1066 n.2 (2d Cir. 
1995) (""Normally, [courts] will not consider arguments raised for the first time in a reply brief"")."
802,22," See Rebel Oil Co. v. Atl. Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1437 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding that ""[t]he aggregation of market shares of 
several rivals is justified if the rivals are alleged to have conspired to monop[son]ize""). "
804,1," PSEG ""disputes many of the facts contained in the Complaint"" but acknowledges that for purposes of this motion it must accept 
them as true. (Def. Br., D.E. 17-1, at 4 n.2.) "
805,2," ""PPA's"" are long-term purchased power agreements. (Compl. ¶ 40.)"

(Compl. ¶ 40 n.4.)"
805,4," Long Island's power system ""has only limited ties"" to the rest of the New York State system. (Compl. ¶ 36.) "
809,5," Although Plaintiffs' tortious interference claim may be inconsistent with its antitrust claims, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 
8 allows that ""[a] party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has, regardless of consistency."" "
812,1," Although Plaintiffs filed suit as a putative class action, there is no motion to certify, and no class has yet been certified."
812,2," In addition to Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Plaintiffs also name Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company, 
Nationwide General Insurance Company, Nationwide Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Nationwide Life Insurance 
Company, Nationwide Financial General Agency (""Insurance Defendants"") as Defendants. Plaintiffs likewise name Nationwide 
Bank as a Defendant. Am. Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 44. The Court will refer to the collective as ""Defendants."""
812,3, The factual summary is taken from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint and the evidence submitted on summary judgment. 
813,4," Although Plaintiffs have suggested that it is inappropriate to rule on a summary judgment motion at this stage of the litigation, 
Plaintiffs have not submitted an affidavit or declaration pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) showing that, for 
specified reasons, they cannot present facts essential to their opposition. Plaintiffs have not even explained in detail what facts 
they would seek in discovery that could be pertinent to the statute of limitations issue. Nor have Bergdoll or Pacheco offered 
relevant evidence in opposition to Defendants' summary judgment motion."
813,5," As discussed below, the Supreme Court has also rejected the ""last predicate act"" accrual rule. See infra. "
814,6," This case does not present the scenario where a plaintiff is injured before the occurrence of a second predicate act and, thus, 
does not necessitate a discussion of when the statute of limitations begins to run in such a situation. See, e.g., Rotella, 528 U.S. 
at 558 n.4. In any event, in the Sixth Circuit, the statute of limitations begins to run at the time that both discovery of the injury 
and two predicate acts have occurred. Bygrave, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 29377, 2000 WL 1769587, at *4 n.5; EJS Properties, 
LLC v. City of Toledo, 522 F. Supp. 2d 936, 944 (N.D. Ohio 2007) (""[I]t is the point at which the plaintiff becomes or should 
become aware of the injury—in combination with the existence of a pattern of racketeering—that defines when a RICO claim 
accrues."")."
814,7," Isaak is a pre-Rotella case, but Sims cites Isaak for guidance on when a plaintiff discovers or should discover his injury for 
purposes of applying the injury discovery rule, and that portion of Isaak is not affected by Rotelia. Isaak is therefore additional 
support for the notion that the Sixth Circuit's injury discovery rule would require knowledge of both the injury and source of injury. 
Isaak, 169 F.3d at 399 (""[A] civil RICO cause of action begins to accrue as soon as the plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should 
have discovered both the existence and source of his injury and that the injury is part of a pattern."" (internal quotation marks and 
citation omitted)). "
815,8," The Court refers herein to the various Independent Contractor or Performance Agreements that agents entered into when 
joining the Agent Programs as ""Agreements,"" except in citations. "
816,9," For purposes of this Opinion and Order, the Court assumes that such a misrepresentation can serve as the basis of mail or 
wire fraud, although it is skeptical of such an assumption."
816,10," Indeed, by Plaintiffs' own allegations, they knew that they did not actually own their books of business (despite Defendants' 
alleged misrepresentations to the contrary) well before completing the programs. Plaintiffs allege that although they were 
induced to enter into the programs by promises of business ownership, the Agreements Plaintiffs entered into in order to 
participate in the programs specifically stated that Defendants owned the books of business. See Am. Compl. ¶ 107; Mot. 
Dismiss Ex. 1. And, based on their debt and income at the time of completing the Agent Programs (or, at the latest, within a few months 
thereafter), Bergdoll and Pacheco should have known whether they could likely sustain the type of lengthy, successful careers 
as an agent with Defendants that they were led to believe they could. Bergdoll and Pacheco point to no evidence, or even 
allegations, that they expected to grow their businesses over time or that, for some other reason, they did not realize the false 
nature of this representation until some date within the statute of limitations period. "
817,11," See Bygrave, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 29377, 2000 WL 1769587, at *3 n.3 (non-payment of rent actions were not predicate acts 
because those actions expressly asserted the plaintiff was a tenant and did not fraudulently misrepresent that she was a land 
contract purchaser); Sasser v. Amen, No. C 99-3604 SI, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9469, 2001 WL 764953, at * 7 (N.D. Cal. July 2, 
2001) (continued monthly paychecks perpetuating allegedly unlawful ""charge back"" policy that was first implemented outside the 
limitations period are not Independent' acts but simply reaffirmations of previous representations about the legality of the 
policy.""). Likewise, here, there is no allegation or, because this is now on summary judgment, evidence that the monthly 
collections fraudulently misrepresented the amount Bergdoll and Pacheco were required to pay on their respective loans. The 
monthly collection notices were likely therefore not ""new act[s] of fraud"" as argued by Plaintiffs. See Resp. 7, ECF No. 110 "
819,12," Only one of the cases Plaintiffs cite regarding the continuing violation doctrine included a civil RICO claim, see In re Nat. 
Prescription Opiate Lit., MDL 2804, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 213657, 2018 WL 6628898, at *3 (N.D. Ohio Dec. 19, 2018), and it is 
not clear whether the continuing violation analysis in that case applied to the RICO claim or to the other claims in that case. "
820,13," Nor have Bergdoll and Pacheco offered any evidence, such as affidavits, to support the allegation that success rates were 
concealed from them. Similarly, neither Bergdoll nor Pacheco allege or offer evidence that they were actively mislead as to their 
own progress in the programs or that such affirmative acts concealing their progress in the programs concealed the acts forming 
the underlying mail or wire fraud that injured them. "
821,14," As explained above, knowledge of injury and source was sufficient to put Bergdoll and Pacheco on inquiry notice regarding the 
existence of the underlying predicate acts of mail or wire fraud."
821,15," With respect to Plaintiffs' reference to Shelley Aaserud, the Court adds that Plaintiffs did not allege, let alone offer any 
evidence, that they exercised reasonable diligence to discover facts concerning the mail and wire fraud, that any specific facts 
constituting those causes of action were solely in Aaserud's possession, and that Plaintiffs were therefore unable to discover 
those facts within the statute of limitations due to the injunction. See Am. Compl. ¶ 192. Thus, although Plaintiffs alleged that 
Defendants prevented her from disclosing certain information, Plaintiffs have failed to even allege that the injunction prohibited 
them from discovering the facts that form the basis of their cause of action, had they exercised due diligence. "
825,1," The Court recognizes that the FAC contains a common boilerplate allegation that all defendants were each other's agents. 
However, when entities are involved in a transaction, the negotiations are conducted by the entities' respective agents. 
Generally, any resulting agreement is legally between the entities, not between the agents. Cf. Filippo Industries, Inc. v. Sun Ins. 
Co., 74 Cal. App. 4th 1429, 1442-43, 88 Cal. Rptr. 2d 881 (1999) (holding that agent is not liable on a contract when he acts for 
a disclosed principal and does not exceed his authority). As such, it is reasonable and plausible to infer that the agreement 
described in the first cause of action is between Hellenic and SER. However, in the absence of an express allegation that 
identifies the actual relationship between the individuals and SER, and that explains how Kast and Johnson can enforce the 
agreement in an individual/non-representative capacity, it cannot be reasonably inferred that Kast and Johnson are parties to the 
agreement in an individual capacity. Without allegations that plausibly show that Kast and Johnson can individually enforce the 
agreement, there is no basis to include them under the claim for declaratory relief. "
826,2," The Court notes that declaratory relief is available for both written and oral contracts. See Columbia Pictures Corp. v. De Toth, 
26 Cal.2d 753, 760, 161 P.2d 217 (1945) (oral contract); Shaw v. Regents of U. of Cal., 58 Cal.App.4th 44, 52, 67 Cal. Rptr. 2d 
850 (1997) (written contract); Zimmer v. Gorelnik, 42 Cal. App. 2d 440, 445, 109 P.2d 34 (1941) (holding that § 1060 applies to 
oral and written contracts)."
826,3," ""'[C]ommercial disparagement,' 'injurious falsehood,' 'product disparagement,' 'trade libel,' 'disparagement of property,' and 
'slander of goods,'"" are names that have been given to the same tort by various courts over the years. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. 
Swift Distribution, Inc., 59 Cal.4th 277, 289, 172 Cal. Rptr. 3d 653, 326 P.3d 253 (2014) "
827,4," Disapproved on other grounds by Baral v. Schnitt, 1 Cal.5th 376, 205 Cal. Rptr. 3d 475, 376 P.3d 604 (2016). "
829,5," The Court notes that the parties cite to and rely on pleading requirements of California state law. Such reliance, although not 
uncommon, is improper. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, not the California Code of Civil Procedure, govern all actions in 
federal court, irrespective of the source of subject matter jurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 1; Kearns v. Ford Motor Co., 567 F.3d 
1120, 1125 (9th Cir. 2009); United States use of Acme Granite & Tile Co. v. F.D. Rich Co., 441 F.2d 1143, 1144 (9th Cir. 1971). "
831,6," The Court is unaware of any authority holding that a claim for declaratory relief under Cal. Code Civ. P. § 1060 may form the 
basis of a UCL ""unlawful"" claim."
831,7," The Court notes that ""malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 9(b). While there is no heightened pleading standard under Rule 9(b) for punitive damages, the allegations that request 
and support punitive damages must still meet the requirements of Rule 8 and Iqbal, i.e. the factual allegations must indicate a "
832,," plausible basis for punitive damages. See Mayfield v. NASCAR, 674 F.3d 369, 377 (4th Cir. 2012); Coppola v. Smith, 982 
F.Supp.2d 1133, 1144-45 (E.D. Cal. 2013)."
832,8," The Court reiterates that it has not found a plausible trade libel claim. Because the plausibility of the claim as a whole is a 
separate issue from whether each defendant has adequate notice of the claims against them and the conduct attributed to them, 
the Court addresses the allegations with respect to Kast and Johnson. "
833,9," Again, that the allegations may tie Kast to the NIPEA claim does not change the fact that no plausible NIPEA has been alleged."
833,10," This statement is a general observation and is not to be construed as the Court prohibiting Hellenic from attempting to pursue 
trade libel and defamation claims. "
847,1, Mylan subsequently acquired Alphapharm in 2007. Compl. ¶ 83. 
850,2," Plaintiffs do not set forth the requirements for a monopolization claim under the numerous state laws cited in the Complaint, nor 
do they plead any state-specific factual allegations. The Court assumes, as the parties do (and as the Second Circuit did in 
Actos II) that those statutes accord with the federal standard for purposes of this motion. "
851,3," Unless otherwise noted, this opinion cites the here-applicable 2000 edition of Title 21 of the U.S. Code and the 2003 edition of 
Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations."
851,4," HN7[
] Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 355(c)(2), when a patent issues after an NDA has already been approved, the patent must also be listed in connection with the NDA drug if the identical requirements in § 355(b)(1) are present. See § 355(c)(2) (providing 
that an NDA applicant shall file with the application ""the patent number and the expiration date of any patent which claims the 
drug for which the applicant submitted the application or which claims a method of using such drug and with respect to which a 
claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, 
use, or sale of the drug"") (emphasis added). EPPs state that the ACTOS NDA was approved on January 15, 1999. Compl. ¶ 62. 
The '584 patent issued on October 12, 1999, and the '404 patent issued on December 11, 2001. As the Patents issued after the 
ACTOS NDA was approved, it appears that they were actually listed by Takeda pursuant to § 355(c)(2)—not § 355(b)(1). In any 
event, as the substantive requirements with respect to listing are identical in these provisions, and the parties cite § 355(b)(1) as 
the relevant provision, the Court does so as well."
851,5," The FDA regulations further define a drug product as ""a finished dosage form, e.g., tablet, capsule, or solution, that contains a 
drug substance, generally, but not necessarily, in association with one or more other ingredients."" 21 C.F.R. § 314.3. "
860,6," To be sure, the plaintiffs in Lantus had also asserted a separate sham litigation theory, in support of their monopolization 
claims, with respect to which the court appropriately applied the ""objectively baseless"" standard. But the court also appears to 
have applied that standard to the alleged false Orange Book listings. "
861,7," That theory, as noted, was not advanced before the Second Circuit but this Court permitted EPPs to include it in their 
Complaint following remand. "
862,8," The remainder of Caraco stands for the unrelated proposition that generic companies may assert a counterclaim, pursuant to 
21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(C), requiring an NDA holder to correct its descriptions of the uses covered by method-of-use claims (""use

869,6," Actelion also argues that Plaintiffs fail to plead a plausible anticompetitive scheme, Plaintiffs' ""group pleading"" does not satisfy 
the requirements of Rule 8, and Plaintiffs fail to plead the statutory requirements of their various state claims. Because the Court 
agrees with Actelion that most of Plaintiffs' claims are time-barred and Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their remaining claims, the 
Court does not need to address the rest of Actelion's arguments."
869,7," The statutes of limitations for Count 6 (Maine Antitrust Statute), Count 26 (Wisconsin Antitrust Act), Count 33 (Minnesota 
Consumer Fraud Act), and Count 44 (Vermont Consumer Fraud Act) are each six years."

871,9," In their Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief for their Sherman Act claim under § 26 of the Clayton Act, 15 
U.S.C. § 26 (2018). (Am. Compl. ¶ 306). Section 26 of the Clayton Act provides that ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or 
association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the 
antitrust laws . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. Because the Court will dismiss Plaintiffs' Sherman Act claim, the Court will also deny 
Plaintiffs' request for injunctive relief. "

regard to a product."") (quoting Lang McLaughry Spera Real Estate, LLC v. Hinsdale, 190 Vt. 1, 35 A.3d 100, 105 (Vt. 2011)). "
873,14," Plaintiffs also allege that GEHA purchased Tracleer in Colorado, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kansas, Tenneesee, and 
Texas; however, Plaintiffs do not bring antitrust claims under the laws of those states. (Am. Compl. ¶ 18). "
877,1," One could imagine a Supremacy Clause problem if Nevada's anti-SLAPP provisions were applied — outside Erie's domain — 
to a federal cause of action. Cf. Martinez v. California, 444 U.S. 277, 284, 100 S. Ct. 553, 62 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1980) (""It is clear 
that the California immunity statute does not control this [federal § 1983] claim . . . .""). But that is not the case here. Nor could it 
be: anti-SLAPP statutes do not apply to federal causes of action. See, e.g., Hilton v. Hallmark Cards, 599 F.3d 894, 901 (9th 
Cir. 2010) (""[T]he anti-SLAPP statute does not apply to federal law causes of action.""); Ginx, Inc. v. Soho Alliance, 720 F. Supp. 
2d 342, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (""[F]ederal courts have [generally] declined to apply [a]nti-SLAPP statutes to federal claims."")."
877,2," The only distinction? The award of attorney's fees accompanies the initial dismissal, see id. § 41.670(1)(a), whereas the award 
of damages occurs in ""a separate action"" brought after the initial dismissal, id. § 41.670(1)(c). For purposes of the Supremacy 
Clause, however, that distinction is without a difference. The right to a federal forum is impermissibly ""burden[ed]"" irrespective of 
precisely when the state ""seek[s] to exact a cost after the [exercise of the right] occurs."" Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 
337, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010). Adelson attempts another distinction — between ""the mere shifting of attorney's fees"" and ""the threat of [civil] liability, [which] far 
more significantly chills"" the right to bring a lawsuit. (Dkt. No. 24 at 10 (first alteration in original) (quoting Octane Fitness, LLC v. 
ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., 572 U.S. 545, 556, 134 S. Ct. 1749, 188 L. Ed. 2d 816 (2014).) But that distinction, too, melts into 
air. The Supremacy Clause condemns all attempts to ""curtail the free exercise of the right [to a federal forum]."" Terral, 257 U.S. 
at 532. "
878,3," Admittedly, the district court's reasoning in Garber sweeps more broadly. Its assertion that ""it is a federal question whether or 
not there has been an abuse of process of a federal court"" would likely preempt all state-law causes of action for abusive 
litigation filed in federal court. 254 F. Supp. at 87. Perhaps for that reason, Garber, ""a more than fifty-year-old case"" that applies 
""an approach [to federal common law that] is improper today,"" has been flatly deemed ""not persuasive."" Backer v. Cooperatieve 
Rabobank U.A., 338 F. Supp. 3d 222, 240 n.8 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). "
880,4," Because the choice-of-law analysis indicates that Nevada law governs, this Court does not address Plaintiffs' additional 
argument that Adelson is collaterally estopped from arguing that New York law governs. (Dkt. No. 21 at 18-21.)"
880,5," Adelson argues that there is a fundamental distinction between ""the existence of a cause of action"" and ""the elements of the 
resulting legal claim."" (Dkt. No. 24 at 14.) Of course. But the elements of a statutory cause of action are ascertained by 
interpreting the text of the statute. And here, the text of the statute plainly does not include the ""objectively baseless"" standard 
urged by Adelson. "
881,6," Adelson also suggests that the Court should interpret the Nevada statute to cohere with the common-law tort of malicious 
prosecution because Plaintiffs' claims would otherwise be untimely. (Dkt. No. 24 at 15.) Nevada law establishes a three-year 
statute of limitations period for any ""action upon a liability created by statute."" Nev. Rev. Stat. § 11.190(3). Adelson argues that 
Plaintiffs' cause of action accrued on the date of this Court's grant of the special motion to dismiss on September 30, 2013, 
which would render this suit untimely. In contrast, a claim for malicious prosecution does not accrue until all appeals have been 
exhausted. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 674 cmt. j. Thus, to ensure that their claim was filed within the statute of 
limitations period, Adelson argues, Plaintiffs' must concede that the anti-SLAPP statute ""incorporates all the elements of 
malicious prosecution[,] [including] the element of objective baselessness."" (Dkt. No. 24 at 16.) Plaintiffs' claims are timely. A claim under Nevada's anti-SLAPP statute, like a claim for malicious prosecution, accrues only after 
all appeals are exhausted. (After all, Plaintiffs' claims in this case would presumably encompass compensation for any harms 
suffered as a result of Adelson's appeal to the Second Circuit.) But — contra Adelson — there are no obvious implications for 
the substantive standard of liability under the anti-SLAPP statute, which is a conceptually unrelated question. "
882,7," Adelson argues that even if the Noerr-Pennington doctrine is an antitrust doctrine, it remains ""relevant outside the context of 
antitrust actions."" (Dkt. No. 17 at 20 (quoting FORSA v. Mullen, 313 F. Supp. 2d 339, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)). The doctrine does 
not, however, give this Court license to ignore clear statutory text. The Supreme Court's most recent pronouncement on the 
subject makes plain that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine applies only if it ""finds . . . roots in the text of"" the statute at issue. 
Octane Fitness, 572 U.S. at 556. Where, as here, the text of the statute is ""patently clear"" and ""imposes one and only one 
constraint on district courts' discretion"" (here, successful dismissal under the anti-SLAPP statute), the doctrine has no 
application. Id. at 553. "
884,8," Adelson's brief argues he has met his burden because the ""Complaint never claims that Mr. Adelson's factual allegations were 
false . . . [or] made without knowledge of their falsehood."" (Dkt. No. 28 at 8.) This gets it exactly backward. As the movant, 
Adelson ""bears the initial burden of production and persuasion"" to show ""that the lawsuit is based on [a] good faith 
communication[]."" John, 125 Nev. at 754 (internal quotation marks omitted). "
887,1," The three levels of payment processing are as follows: (1) Point of sale (""POS""), systems where merchants enter orders and 
accept credit cards; (2) payment interfaces, conduits that receive and process credit card transaction data from merchants' POS 
and send it payment processors; and (3) merchant account service providers (""MAS""), payment processors that receive data 
from payment interfaces or POS systems and send the data to banks and credit card companies."
887,2," Defendants also filed a Request for Judicial Notice. ECF No. 20. Plaintiff opposed Defendants' request. ECF No. 31. Plaintiff 
objected that the contents of the request (press releases, Form 10-Ks, and webpage timelines) did not meet the requirements of 
Federal Rule of Evidence 201 as they neither are relied upon in the complaint nor a matter of public record. See id. The Court 
DENIED AS MOOT Defendants' request as those exhibits were not used in reaching the Court's ruling. See Medina v. County of 
San Diego, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41883, 2012 WL 1033019, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 26, 2012). "
888,3, The Court cites Plaintiff's FAC filed under seal upon the Court's approval. See ECF No. 86.
888,4," Defendants have not raised any argument claiming that the alleged geographic market is improper. See ECF No. 70-1. For that 
reason, the Court will only address PLL's relevant product market allegations. "

896,2," The Retailer Plaintiffs (""Retailers"") originally objected to DPPs' proposed notice to the class contending that the form of notice - 
which required holders of partially assigned claims to obtain Par's consent before opting out - violated their right to pursue their 
claims individually. (ECF No. 382.) DPPs submitted a revised notice eliminating the offending language, (ECF No. 421), and 
Retailers withdrew their objection, (ECF No. 444). "
898,3," At this step, it is not necessary for the court to hold a hearing if the court is satisfied that it can make the preliminary 
determination ""on the basis of information already known, supplemented as necessary by briefs, motions, or informal

906,1," The Direct Purchaser Class Plaintiffs include FWK Holdings, LLC, Rochester Drug Cooperative, Inc., and Cesar Castillo. "
916,1," The second claim for relief prayed in the Third Amended Complaint, asserted by Ashton Woods and D.R. Horton, seeks 
damages under the Sherman Act for direct purchases from L&W. (ECF 110, Third Am. Compl., ¶¶ 264-271.) The Court issued 
an order as to this claim on September 27, 2019. (ECF 413.) Because Plaintiffs only seek umbrella damages under state law, 
Count II is not affected by this opinion. "
917,2," The claims against CertainTeed and National were dismissed with prejudice by Plaintiffs voluntarily, (ECF 178; 331); and the 
claim against Continental was dismissed by the Court, (ECF 93.) The claims against American, Lafarge, and TIN have settled.

ever purchase drywall directly from the manufacturer?"" Answer: ""No."")."
919,5," According to deposition testimony, Plaintiffs knew the manufacturer that supplied the drywall to their subcontractor if the 
purchase was part of a special program, but for the majority of purchases the manufacturer's identity was unknown. See, e.g.,

920,6," A complete chart of the intermediate purchaser declarations concerning pass through of prices is attached as the Appendix to

922,7," In their Motion, Defendants analyze the viability of umbrella damages under (a) federal law and (b) the law of the eighteen 
states, in addition to California, that Plaintiffs contend recognize the right of an indirect purchaser to sue for antitrust damages. 
(Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 4-15.) However, Plaintiffs do not seek umbrella damages under the Sherman Act, so 
Defendants' arguments on the unavailability of umbrella damages under federal law will not be addressed. (Pl.'s Opp. at 9.) 
Additionally, because the Court found that California's choice-of-law approach requires application of California state law to the 
state antitrust claims brought by Plaintiffs located in both repealer and nonrepealer states, the Court will not reach Defendants' 
arguments addressing umbrella damages under non-California law. (ECF 390; 400.) "
923,8," Def.'s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. at 12-14 contains a comprehensive collection of the eleven out of nineteen repealer states that 
have enacted harmonization statutes. "
924,9," At most, the deposition testimony establishes that Plaintiffs purchased domestically manufactured drywall, because the drywall 
used in the homes constructed by Plaintiffs was procured by subcontractors that were contractually obligated to obtain drywall 
only from United States manufacturers. See Section II.E. "
925,10," The Court summarized the substance of the allegations related to the anticompetitive conduct in California in the 
Memorandum re Motion for Summary Judgment (Choice of Law), ECF 390, at 10-17. "
931,1," Consistent with the applicable legal standard, the Court recites the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving parties, 
Seaside and Massingill. The facts are only briefly stated here. Detailed facts appear in Massingill's declaration, ECF No. 232, 
which the Court must accept as true at this stage. "
933,2," To the extent these causes of action concern matters outside the scope of the Agency Agreement, they still fail as a matter of 
law. Seaside's allegation that Coastal and the Dunards ""caus[ed] Seaside to pay or incur liability to increase the size of 
Seaside's business,"" ECF No. 215 at 24-25, does not establish Seaside conferred any benefit on Coastal and the Dunards, see 
Young v. Young, 164 Wn.2d 477, 191 P.3d 1258, 1262 (Wash. 2008). Further, Seaside's theory that Coastal and the Dunards 
made an ""implied promise,"" ECF No. 228 at 11, is precluded by Washington law, see Tacoma Auto Mall, Inc. v. Nissan N. Am., 
Inc., 169 Wn. App. 111, 279 P.3d 487, 495-96 (Wash. Ct. App. 2012)."

934,5," This is not to say that no fraudulent or inequitable conduct occurred, see Section E, infra, but merely to observe that Seaside

preponderating the evidence; and furthermore, the existence of an alleged civil conspiracy must be established by clear, cogent, 
and convincing evidence."" Id. ""While a finding that a conspiracy existed may be based on circumstantial evidence, mere 
suspicion is not a sufficient ground upon which to base a finding of conspiracy."" Id. ""The test of the sufficiency of the evidence to 
prove a conspiracy is that the circumstances must be inconsistent with a lawful or honest purpose and reasonably consistent 
only with existence of the conspiracy."" Id. ""The legal concept of civil conspiracy does not necessarily encompass or apply as to 
all of the verbal or physical actions of parties who, by happenstance, are interested in the same general subject matter."" Id. "
941,8," Contrary to Seaside's argument, ECF 228 at 6-8, the Agency Agreement was not a contract for ""continuous services"" and did

942,9," Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Seaside, the contracting parties appear to have treated each transaction as 
a separate, discrete occurrence. See, e.g., ECF No. 111-1 at 2 (""Agent and Broker agree to split commissions realized from 
transportation brokering activity, in accordance with a schedule to be negotiated pertaining on a shipper by shipper basis as part 
of this Agreement.""); id. at 3 (""[A]ll commission checks are created and mailed at the close of business Thursdays. Commission 
accrues to Agent Friday through Wednesday and are paid weekly.""); id. (""Broker earns 30% of the gross net profit from every 
load Agent invoices. Agent earns 70% commission of the gross net, paid within 7 days of receipt of the receivable, less the 
escrow deposit."")."
942,10," Massingill's counterclaim and third-party claim that Coastal and the Dunards failed to pay commissions held in an escrow 
account accrued, if at all, upon the March 13, 2017 termination of the Agency Agreement as to Seaside. "
945,*, This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.
945,1," Even if Lucas was incorrectly decided, we are bound by decisions of prior panels. See Miranda v. Selig, 860 F.3d 1237, 1243 
(9th Cir. 2017)."
945,2," We have serious doubts that the proper standard in the Ninth Circuit is to require a defendant to demonstrate a pro-competitive 
aspect to the agreement. See Rebel Oil, Inc. v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 51 F.3d 1421, 1433 (9th Cir. 1995) (noting that the 
standard is whether defendant's conduct is beneficial or neutral to competition); see also Pool Water Products v. Olin Corp., 258 
F.3d 1024, 1034 (9th Cir. 2001) (same). "
946,1," The majority asserts that Lucas Automotive ""extended"" the ""principles"" of Brunswick to cases where competitors are excluded 
from the relevant market, Maj. at 3, but in fact Lucas Automotive [**8]  merely applied Brunswick's holding that a disgruntled "
947,," competitor did not suffer an antitrust injury when a large company entered into an agreement that increased its market share but 
there was still competition in the relevant market. "
954,1," This conclusion was based on the following considerations: ""a reverse payment, where large and unjustified, can bring with it 
the risk of significant anticompetitive effects; one who makes such a payment may be unable to explain and to justify it; such a 
firm or individual may well possess market power derived from the patent; a court, by examining the size of the payment, may 
well be able to assess its likely anticompetitive effects along with its potential justifications without litigating the validity of the 
patent; and parties may well find ways to settle patent disputes without the use of reverse payments."" Id. at 158. "
955,2," In their briefing, DPPs expressly abandon the theory that the settlement agreements restrained trade by including unlawful 
reverse payments under Actavis, See DPPs' Mem. Opp. at 2-3 (noting that Defendants' arguments regarding reverse-payment 
allegations are ""largely directed to a different lawsuit entirely,"" namely, the End-Payor case, and that such arguments are 
""irrelevancies""). At oral argument, the Court confirmed with DPPs that they were no longer pursuing their restraint of trade claims 
under a reverse-payment theory. See Oct. 23, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 77:21-78:5. "
959,3," Through the settlement, Teva was able to enter the market at the same time as the first-filers because it did so as an 
authorized generic—that is, Takeda granted Teva a license to sell Takeda-manufactured tablets under Teva's label. As 
previously noted, the 180-day exclusivity period does not bar authorized generics from entering the market at the same time."
959,4," To be clear, the Second Circuit and this Court have previously held that Takeda's statements to the FDA in January 2010 
concerning the Patents' Orange Book descriptions plausibly caused Teva's delay in generic market entry. Under this theory, by 
contrast, those statements caused the FDA to cause Teva to file Paragraph IV certifications as to the drug product claims, after 
which Teva settled by accepting (among other things) a license to market an authorized-generic version of ACTOS on August 
17, 2012 or the date another generic version of ACTOS entered the market if earlier. Absent those statements, DPPs plausibly 
allege that Teva would have stuck with its Section viii statements and obtained FDA approval to enter the market soon after the 
'777 patent expired. This casual mechanism is supported by the facts alleged in DPPs' Complaint—unlike the alleged causal 
mechanism as to how Teva's 2010 settlement with Takeda further delayed Teva's market entry. In other words, while DPPs 
plausibly allege that Takeda's unilateral conduct delayed Teva's entry, they fail to do the same with respect to Takeda and 
Teva's joint conduct in entering the settlement. As such, DPPs' restraint of trade claim against Teva is dismissed for failure to 
allege antitrust injury. "
979,1," Contrary to ICP's assertion, the Supreme Court did not apply the per se standard to a group boycott in Interstate Circuit v. 
United States, 306 U.S. 208, 59 S. Ct. 467, 83 L. Ed. 610 (1939). (D.I. 200 at 25). First, the court nowhere uses the words ""per 
se"" or any similar language. See, e.g., Klor 's, 359 U.S. at 211-12 (stating that the restraint was ""in the forbidden category"" of 
agreements that ""from their nature or character were unduly restrictive""). Second, the court analyzed the unreasonableness of 
the restraint by taking into account the competitors' ""wide differences in location and character."" 306 U.S. at 230-31. Such 
analysis is ""predicated upon the rule of reason ... and not the per se rule."" Royal Drug Co. v. Grp. Life & Health Ins. Co., 737 
F.2d 1433, 1437 (5th Cir. 1984)."
979,2," The complaint does not allege that Caterpillar itself sells used equipment, but that Caterpillar's wholly owned subsidiaries, Cat 
Financial Services and Caterpillar Used Equipment Services, Inc., sell the used equipment. (See D.I. 162 at 48). Nevertheless, 
ICP attributes these activities to Caterpillar for purposes of analyzing the ""horizontal agreement"" required for per se treatment. It 
is also not entirely clear how plausible it is that the Dealer Defendants compete with each other, given their geographic distances 
from each other. "
980,3," If the rule of reason applies, the second amended complaint fails to plead a geographic market for new heavy construction 
equipment. Specifically, there are no allegations in the complaint regarding the geographic confines in which a potential buyer of 
new heavy construction equipment rationally looks for that equipment. Instead, the complaint is replete with allegations 
regarding where ICP would like to sell new heavy construction equipment, that is, online through IronPlanet. (See, e.g., D.I. 162 
at ¶¶ 54-60). ""[T]he geographic market is not comprised of the region in which the seller attempts to sell its product, but rather is 
comprised of the area where his customers would look to buy such a product."" Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 
726 (3d Cir. 1991). Even the complaint acknowledges that buyers did not traditionally purchase new heavy construction 
equipment online. (D.I. 162 at ¶¶ 53, 70). Instead, buyers traditionally looked to a local equipment dealer. (Id. at ¶ 36). "
981,4," Courts sitting in Delaware determine the applicable law based the ""most significant relationship"" test, which considers: ""(a) the 
place where the injury occurred, (b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred, (c) the domicile, residence, 
nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and (d) the place where the relationship, if any, between 
the parties is centered."" Integral Res. (PVT) Ltd. v. ISTIL Grp., Inc., 155 F. App'x 69, 71 (3d Cir. 2005). "
994,1," Reference to Defendants herein does not include Defendant The Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital Operating corporation 
d/b/a Cone Health (""Cone Health""), party to Case No. 17 CVS 9002, which filed its own Partial Motion to Dismiss on February 
12, 2018 (ECF No. 19), which the Court determined by its Order and Opinion on August 20, 2019 (ECF No. 128). "
996,2," The Individual Defendants assert the Counterclaims against MEDNAX and Dr. Mason but only against SAC and AAI in the 
alternative ""should the Court find that SAC is not a sham entity, created and controlled by MEDNAX[.]"""
996,3," Plaintiffs also sought dismissal of Defendants' federal antitrust claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter 
jurisdiction. However, the federal antitrust claim is no longer before this Court. Defendants filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal 
Without Prejudice of Federal Anti-Trust Claims Only on September 26, 2018 voluntarily dismissing the Federal Anti-Trust Claims "
997,," under 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a). (ECF No. 86.) Therefore, the Court does not further 
address Plaintiffs' 12(b)(1) Motion. "
998,4," HN4[
] The decision to dismiss an action with or without prejudice is in the discretion of the trial court. First Fed. Bank v. Aldridge, 230 N.C. App. 187, 191, 749 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2013). The Court concludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that 
dismissal of Rose Anesthesia's claims should be without prejudice. "
1001,5," The Court does not address whether Defendants sufficiently identified the relevant product and geographic markets. For 
purposes of the Motion, Plaintiffs do not dispute the defined market set forth by Defendants nor is any definition set forth by 
Defendants determinative in the disposition of the Motion for the reasons discussed herein. "
1003,6," The Court does not analyze the sufficiency of Defendants' pleading as it relates to defining the relevant market, as it is not 
necessary or outcome determinative for the purposes of this Motion. "
1011,1," Although ProMedica analyzed the relevant markets for the purpose of determining whether a prospective merger would violate 
§ 7 of the Clayton Act rather than for the purpose of determining whether an entity monopolized part of trade or commerce in 
violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, the Supreme Court has established that the clustering analysis is the same in each of these 
contexts. See Grinnell, 384 U.S. at 573 (""We see no reason to differentiate between 'line' of commerce in the context of the 
Clayton Act and 'part' of commerce for the purposes of the Sherman Act.""). "
1014,2," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine also protects efforts to ""persuade the legislature or the executive to take particular action with 
respect to a law that would produce a restraint or monopoly."" See Prof'l Real Estate Inv'rs, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 
508 U.S. 49, 56 (1993) (citations omitted). "
1015,3," WIN attached these letters to its amended answer and counterclaim. (See Docs. 120-1, 120-2.) "
1016,4," WIN's characterization of the ""sole-source"" contracts is consistent with the general understanding of sole-source arrangements 
between providers and government entities. See, e.g., U.S. ex rel. Taxpayers Against Fraud v. Singer Co., 889 F.2d 1327, 1329 
n.8 (4th Cir. 1989) (""Sole-source contracts, by their nature, are not subject to the competitive bidding process, that is, the 
situation in the case of a sole-source contract is not one where the lowest bid gets the contract.""). "
1017,5," In the Sixth Circuit, in ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, a district court may consider a document that is referenced in a complaint, 
though it is not attached to the complaint, when that document is central to the claims. Briggs v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. of 
Pittsburg, Penn., 774 F. App'x 942, 948 (6th Cir. 2019); Weiner v. Klais & Co., 108 F.3d 86, 88-90 (6th Cir. 1997), abrogated on

1043,2," 3Shape sold the Trios scanner in the United States for approximately four years without an Interoperability Agreement with 
Align. (See D.I. 1 ¶¶ 48, 55.) "
1045,3," ""Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a 
felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, 
$1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."" 15 U.S.C. § 
2. "
1047,4," Perhaps recognizing the difficulty in proceeding under the refusal to deal doctrine, City Smiles tries to recast Align's termination 
of the Interoperability Agreement as a design change to Align's manufacturing process. (D.I. 12 at 15.) That does not change the 
analysis. Whatever you want to call it, the result was that Align quit accepting orders for Invisalign from 3Shape's Trios scanner. 
That makes this a refusal to deal case, and City Smiles cannot evade refusal to deal doctrine simply by calling the conduct 
another name. See Novell, 731 F.3d at 1079 (""Whether one chooses to call a monopolist's refusal to deal with a rival an act or 
omission, interference or withdrawal of assistance, the substance is the same and it must be analyzed under the traditional 
[refusal to deal] test . . . .""). "
1048,5," The Complaint does not allege that the design of Align's iTero Element scanner has ever changed. The Court is therefore not 
confronted with an allegation of anticompetitive product redesign. Nor does this case concern the interoperability or integration of complementary products in two markets, as was at issue in 
United States v. Microsoft. 253 F.3d 34, 64-67, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (assessing antitrust consequences 
relating to the interoperability of browser and operating system under circumstances where the defendant's products were 
distributed together and could not be disaggregated). Unlike the product markets at issue in Microsoft, intraoral scanners and 
aligners are sold independently, can be used independently, and don't interact with each other in operation. "
1050,6," In the alternative, Align sought transfer of the case to the Northern District of California. (D.I. 7.) Because I recommend that the 
case be dismissed, I do not address Align's transfer arguments. See Tr. 15 (Align's agreement that dismissal in lieu of transfer is 
appropriate)."
1050,7," Antitrust standing is a prudential limitation. As it does not affect subject matter jurisdiction, there is no requirement that the 
Court consider it at this time. See Shionogi Pharma, Inc. v. Mylan, Inc., No. 10-1077, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58774, 2011 WL 
2174499, *3 (D. Del. May 26, 2011) (dismissing Section 2 claim for failure to state a claim without addressing the parties' dispute 
over antitrust standing)."
1050,8," Plaintiff's Complaint also alleged a class. The Court need not address class certification before dismissing the case. See, e.g., 
Donnenfeld v. Petro Home Servs., No. 16-882, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43945, 2017 WL 1250992, at *6 (D.N.J. Mar. 24, 2017) 
(""[B]ecause the Court is dismissing the Complaint, the Court will not consider Defendants' arguments regarding class 
certification at this time"")."
1050,9," Align requests that the Complaint be dismissed without leave to amend because any amendment would be futile. However, it is 
not clear on this limited record that amendment would necessarily be futile. See Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 235-36 (3d Cir. 
2004) (holding that leave to amend should be granted ""unless a curative amendment would be inequitable, futile, or untimely""). "
1054,1," Plaintiffs' first-amended class-action complaint (""FAC"") alleges the following facts, which the Courts accepts as true for 
purposes of Defendants' motion to dismiss and views in a light most favorable to Plaintiff. See Data Mfg., Inc., 557 F.3d at 851. "
1055,2," No party disputes whether the alleged anticompetitive conspiracy in this case substantially affects interstate commerce. NAR's 
nationwide presence and influence, Corporate Defendants' multistate operational and business structures, and the subject 
matter of the alleged conspiracy all sufficiently implicate interstate commerce. See Diversified Brokerage Servs., Inc. v. Greater 
Des Moines Bd. of Realtors, 521 F.2d 1343, 1345 (8th Cir. 1975) (citing Burke v. Ford, 389 U.S. 320, 321, 88 S. Ct. 443, 19 L. 
Ed. 2d 554 (1967) (""For it is well established that an activity which does not itself occur in interstate commerce comes within the 
scope of the Sherman Act if it substantially affects interstate commerce.""). Accordingly, the threshold question of whether the 
activities alleged here affect interstate commerce is considered undisputed for purposes of the motion to dismiss. "
1056,3," Plaintiffs contend there are ample grounds to conclude Section 2-G-1 is per se illegal. Corporate Defendants contend Section 
2-G-1 is not part of the small and shrinking group of ""manifestly anticompetitive conduct"" typically evaluated under a per se 
standard. (Doc. #118, p. 4 n.5). In considering a motion to dismiss, it is not necessary for this Court to determine whether the 
facts might ultimately support a finding of a per se violation, nor whether Section 2-G-1 warrants evaluation under a per se 
standard. That determination is best left to the merits stage of this proceeding. See Craftsmen I, 363 F.3d at 772 (""although a "
1057,," court's determination that the per se rule applies 'might involve many fact questions, the selection of a mode [of analysis] is 
entirely a question of law."") (citations omitted). For purposes of a motion to dismiss, evaluating whether Plaintiffs' factual 
allegations could plausibly satisfy a rule-of-reason standard is sufficient. "
1058,4," Relevant to this alleged effect is the practice of steering. As alleged by Plaintiffs, buyer-brokers can use their access to MLS 
information (unavailable to potential homebuyers) to view details about the offered levels of buyer-broker compensation and 
dissuade clients from viewing or purchasing homes with lower buyer-broker commission offers, thus ""steering"" them to 
properties with higher-paying commissions. (Doc. #38, p. 8; Doc. #88, p. 25). Plaintiffs allege the documented practice of 
steering causes home sellers to pay elevated commission rates, and thus elevated buyer-broker commissions, to avoid or 
dissuade buyer-brokers from engaging in steering. "
1060,5," Corporate Defendants also argue they cannot be held liable for a violation of the MMPA based solely on the alleged antitrust 
violation because Plaintiffs fail to allege conduct violative of state or federal antitrust laws. Given this Court's finding that Plaintiffs 
adequately plead factual allegations which plausibly suggest Corporate Defendants entered into an anticompetitive agreement, 
this argument need not be evaluated here. "

1076,10," As discussed in detail below, the Court certifies only a TPP class, and so, does not address whether the named consumer

1076,11," Defendant Warner Chilcott was also a defendant in Asacol. The argument they make here challenging standing would have 
been better made directly to the First Circuit in a petition for panel rehearing or rehearing en banc. The Court understands such 
a request was not made in Asacol, and thus Defendants have made their bed for this litigation. The Court is confident the First 
Circuit vigorously examined this issue in reaching its conclusion in Asacol, even if it did not cite each case Defendants reference."
1076,12," Niaspan and Flonase are distinguishable from Asacol in that they hold that named plaintiffs may only pursue claims in the 
states in which they reside or provided reimbursements. See, e.g., Niaspan, 42 F. Supp. 3d at 758; Flonase, 692 F. Supp. 2d at 
533. Asacol controls the Court's inquiry here. Moreover, Defendants get no traction with their argument that, applying choice-of-
law principles, the EPPs are limited to recovering only under the laws of the six states in which the TPPs are headquartered. 
This argument has been rejected by the majority of courts to address it. See, e.g., In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride 
and Naloxone) Antitrust Litig., 64 F. Supp. 3d 665, 694-95 (E.D. Pa. 2014), on reconsideration in part 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

514, 538 (E.D. Pa. 2010); Wellbutrin XL, 260 F.R.D. at 156-57). "
1077,13," The Court does not address whether the named EPPs have standing to bring antitrust claims in Massachusetts, or consumer 
protection claims in Kansas, Iowa, Maine, Utah, Missouri, and Vermont, because the EPPs are not pursuing these claims. See 
EPP State Law Claims Chart. While some of the EPPs' other state law claims are dismissed for failure to state a claim, as 
explained below, ""an HN3[
] Article III court ordinarily must be sure of its own jurisdiction before getting to the merits."" Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 816, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better 
Environment, 523 U.S. 83, 88-89, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1989))."
1077,14," The EPPs have Article III standing to bring antitrust claims in the District of Columbia, Nevada, New York, enhanced or treble 
damages under the antitrust laws of Michigan and the consumer protection laws of Massachusetts, because they are 
headquartered or purchased, paid for, and/or provided reimbursement for the drugs at issue in those states. See Asacol, 907 
F.3d at 47 (concluding that named plaintiffs have standing to bring claims under the state laws in which they purchased the 
drugs at issue). "
1078,15," The Court has considered all arguments set forth in Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 192, Defendants' Renewed 
Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 574-2, and replies thereto. The Court rejects, without further discussion, various arguments 
Defendants presented in their Motion to Dismiss. See, e.g., Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss 153, 164 (arguing, for example, that Hawaii's 
consumer protection statute has a pre-suit notice requirement and Nevada's consumer protection statute only provides 
enforcement for elderly and disabled persons)."
1078,16," Justice Stevens's concurrence in Shady Grove is largely considered the controlling opinion. See In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) 
Antitrust Litig., 968 F. Supp. 2d 367, 408-09 (D. Mass. 2013) (""Nexium I""); see also In re Trilegiant Corp., Inc., 11 F. Supp. 3d 
82, 116-18 (D. Conn. 2014) (collecting cases). The EPPs maintain that Justice Scalia's opinion should instead control. See 
EPPs' Opp'n to Renewed Mot. to Dismiss 12, 13 n.14; see also In re Aggrenox Antitrust Litig., No. 3:14-MD-2516 (SRU), 2016

1081,17," The EPPs do not press antitrust claims under the laws of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, 
Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming. Accordingly, the Court does not address Defendants' 
arguments with respect to these claims. See generally EPP State Law Claims Chart."
1081,18," The Court has previously concluded that the EPPs do not have standing to bring their antitrust claim under Utah law, and so, 
that claim is dismissed for the reasons explained above. "
1082,19," The Court uses the terms ""Unfair or Unconscionable Acts and Practices Claims"" and ""Consumer Protection and Deceptive 
Trade Practices Claims"" interchangeably. Moreover, the EPPs do not pursue consumer protection claims under the laws of the 
following states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, 
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, 
Wisconsin, and Wyoming. See generally EPP State Law Claims Chart. "
1083,20," The Court holds that the EPPs do not have standing to pursue their consumer protection claim under Massachusetts law, and 
the EPPs do not pursue their consumer protection claim under North Carolina law. The Court does not address these 
arguments. "
1085,21," Defendants also argue the Idaho Consumer Protection Act only allows for the recovery of restitution (not damages) and that 
the EPPs' expert, Dr. French, has not proposed a method by which to quantify such restitution. Defs.' Renewed Mot. to Dismiss 
63. Defendants do not explain why a restitution theory of recovery cannot be maintained using Dr. French's damages model, 
and the Court is confident it can."
1085,22," Defendants assert that the EPPs have failed to press their unjust enrichment claims because they attached a ""a compilation of 
the federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws at issue in this case"", and they did not include a list of unjust 
enrichment claims. See Decl. of Michael M. Buchman ¶ 3, ECF No. 528-2 (attaching ""a compilation of the federal and state 
antitrust and consumer protection laws at issue in this case""); see also EPPs' Chart of Antitrust and Consumer Protection Laws, 
ECF No. 528-5 (including no unjust enrichment claims). The Court declines to deem the EPPs' unjust enrichment claims 
abandoned on this basis, and nor does the Court consider Defendants' challenges to these claims waived. See EPPs' Opp'n to "
1086,," Renewed Mot. to Dismiss 39-41 (arguing the Court should deem waived Defendants' challenges to their unjust enrichment 
claims)."
1086,23," The Court need not address this argument with respect to Georgia and Illinois because those claims are dismissed for the 
reasons set forth above. See Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss 166. "
1089,24," To the extent the EPPs' Motion to Exclude Kosty and Strombom, ECF No. 733, argues that those experts are not qualified to 
render their opinions, it is DENIED. See EPPs' Mem. of Law in Supp. of Mot. to Exclude the Opinions and Test. of Kosty and 
Strombom 3, 15, ECF No. 736-1. The Motion is otherwise DENIED AS MOOT in light of the Court's conclusion here. The Court 
carefully considered Kosty's and Dr. Strombom's opinions and testimony, but ultimately is persuaded by the EPPs' experts, as 
set forth below, that the relevant data may be reliably obtained and compiled; the TPP class is ascertainable; and the EPPs have 
demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that each TPP in the TPP class was injured by the alleged conduct. If 
Defendants wish to offer these experts at trial for any other purpose, the EPPs may renew any specific, relevant objections at 
that time. "
1090,25," The Court empathizes with Defendants' grievance that, during discovery in this matter, the EPPs repeatedly asserted that they 
could not provide some of the transaction data they now say is readily available. EPP Hr'g Tr. vol. II, 153:1-160:25 (Feb. 14, 
2019), ECF No. 808. The Court concludes that that data were not missing or unavailable; instead, neither party was motivated to 
subpoena the PBMs and other entities involved until Asacol was decided. The Court appreciates Defendants' frustration but 
concludes it would be improper to deny class certification on this basis to secure retribution where the EPPs have otherwise met 
their burden. "
1091,26," Dr. French has been employed as an economist and Senior Advisor with an economic and financial consulting firm, Nathan 
Associates Inc. Expert Report of Gary L. French, Ph.D., Regarding Impact and Damages to EPPs ¶ 1 (""French Report""), ECF

all from the University of Houston. Id. ¶ 2. He has rendered opinions in other pharmaceutical antitrust cases. Id. ¶ 4. The Court

No. 751-1; Supplemental Declaration of Gary L. French, Ph.D. (""French Supp. Decl.""), ECF No. 786-2."
1092,28," Dr. French summarizes the findings of these studies as: (i) once a generic version of a branded drug enters the market, the generic version is sold at a significantly lower price than 
the branded drug; (ii) if an authorized generic version also enters at the same time when the generic version enters, the 
price gap between the branded drug and the generic versions widens; and, (iii) the generic versions' market share [**67]  
increases over time eventually taking most sales of the molecule away from the branded product. French Report ¶ 33."
1092,29," IQVIA is a data vendor for pharmaceutical products, and its data is ""considered the industry standard source of 
pharmaceutical data used by researchers and academics."" French Reply Report ¶ 23. "
1093,30," In his opening report, Dr. French employed both the Loestrin 24 and the Minastrin experiences as competitive benchmarks. 
French Report ¶ 68, 71. In refining his analysis and responding to Dr. Hughes's reports, Dr. French has abandoned the Loestrin 
experience and uses only Minastrin as a competitive benchmark. French Reply Report ¶ 60 (""I am no longer using the Loestrin 
24 experience to calculate but-for prices . . .""); id. ¶ 22 (""I am updating my analysis to employ only the Minastrin experience 
benchmark"")."
1093,31," According to Dr. French, the IQVIA National Prescription Audit (NPA) dataset ""contains both dollar and physical volume sales 
on a weekly or monthly basis for"" both brand and generic prescription drugs. EPP Hr'g Tr. vol. I, 80:2-12. The ""Insights"" dataset 
provides the number of prescriptions by type of payor, viz., cash payors, government payors, and third-party payors. Id."
1093,32," Dr. French considers updated information — including updated IQIVIA data and data sets produced by Dr. Hughes — in his 
Reply Report. See, e.g., French Reply Report ¶¶ 8, 23-26."
1093,33," As discussed further below, the Court declines to certify an EPP class that includes consumers. The Court, as a result, does 
not address Dr. French's methodology and analysis — and Defendants' challenges — pertinent to consumers only. "
1094,34," Dr. French's analysis of the Minastrin experience is consistent with the literature on generic entry: ""The price discounts on 
generic Minastrin in relation to the price of branded Minastrin, which has continually grown as generic competition intensified, 
and the resulting rapid substitution of lower priced generic Minastrin for higher priced branded Minastrin is consistent with the 
literature's description of branded drugs facing generic competition for the first time."" French Report ¶ 57."
1094,35," To the extent Dr. Hughes opines that depressed promotion efforts would have resulted in the EPPs purchasing a lower volume 
of Loestrin 24, resulting in lower damages to the EPP class, it is excluded. Compare Hughes Report ¶ 186 with French Reply ¶¶ 
82-83. HN31[
] An antitrust plaintiff is entitled to damages on the actual volume purchased. Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 487-94, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968)."
1094,36," ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, requires group health plan and issuers to provide preventive care coverage to 
women, without cost sharing, as defined in guidelines promulgated by the Health Resources and Services Administration 
(""HRSA""). HRSA, Women's Preventive Services Guidelines, available at https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines/index.html 
(last visited Oct. 16, 2019). In August 2011, HRSA issued binding guidelines requiring health plans and insurers to cover ""[a]ll 
Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods"", at no cost to the patient. Id. These guidelines went into effect 
in the first plan year beginning on or after August 1, 2012, for plans or policies created or sold after March 23, 2010, or older 
plans or policies that made certain changes since that date. Id. "
1095,37," While Defendants maintain that their rebates, coupons, and free samples amount to ""price concessions"", they can also be 
understood as marketing tools. See, e.g., Hughes Dep. 47:2-7, ECF No. 632-5 (""Q. Warner Chilcott distributed free samples as 
a marketing tool, correct? A. That's certainly my presumption, yes. I mean, just from knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry 
that free sampling is a common method of marketing pharmaceutical products."")."
1095,38," In Nexium III, the First Circuit held that rebates paid from a drug manufacturer to PBMs only affect injury-in-fact to the TPPs 
where the rebates are ""passed-through"" to the TPPs as a ""discounted price when the PBMs bill the TPPs"". 777 F.3d at 28 n.23. 
If the TPPs are instead charged the list price and later ""refunded a portion based on the rebate amount"", these rebates may be 
used to offset any damages award but do not ""affect the fact of injury."" Id. To the extent Dr. Hughes' testimony and opinion are 
inconsistent with this holding, it is excluded. "
1098,39," Because the Court has concluded, for the reasons explained below, that a consumer class may not be certified, the Court's 
analysis of the Rule 23 criteria focuses on the alternative TPP class. "
1099,40," Because the Court does not certify a consumer class, it need not address the typicality arguments concerning the named-
consumer plaintiffs. "
1101,41," The EPPs state that, as a practical matter, pharmacy data is only needed to obtain information on purchases by cash-payment 
consumers. EPPs' Sur-Sur-Reply 15-16. The Court understands, however, that some TPPs may not use PBMs and, thus, their 
transactions may not be included in PBM data. It is because pharmacy data is available that the Court is not troubled by the 
possibility that up to twenty percent of prescriptions are handled by large insurance companies rather than PBMs. See Defs.' 
Mot. to Exclude Miller, Craft, Winkelman 26."
1101,42," The Court is aware that at least one court has noted that ""the players in the pharmaceutical industry [do not utilize] all of the 
fields set out in NCPFP standards"". In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., 308 F.R.D. 134, 150 (E.D. Pa. 2015) (""Wellbutrin XL II""). 
While the court in Wellbutrin declined to certify an indirect-purchaser class on the record before it, the court explicitly held that its 
conclusion was limited to the record evidence presented and that it did ""not hold a view regarding whether indirect purchaser 
classes in other cases involving pharmaceutical purchases are ascertainable or not."" Id. at 151. Given the EPPs' expert 
testimony in this case, the Court is confident that the EPPs can execute their plan in an administratively feasible manner."
1101,43," Because the Court declines to certify a class inclusive of consumers, it need not address Defendants' argument that the EPPs 
will not be able to identify flat co-pay consumers. See EPPs' Sur-Sur-Reply 17. "
1102,44," Craft further testified that, if the EPPs were unable to determine whether a TPP is self-insured to some extent, they could call 
the TPP. EPP Hr'g Tr. Vol. II, 37-38. If affirmation could not be provided over the telephone, the EPPs would exclude that TPP in 
order to ensure that no fully-insured TPP was included in the class. Id. "
1104,45," See, e.g., EPP Hr'g Tr. vol. I, 28:20-22 (""I acknowledge this question of who has the burden is essential to our getting the 
class certified as to the consumers.""); id. at 29:13-16 (""[B]ecause the reality is if you were to decide there's not a presumption 
and, therefore, we acknowledge, therefore, there cannot be a consumer part of this class.""); EPP Hr'g Tr. vol II, 5:21-25; EPP 
Sur-Sur-Reply 3 (""Defendants' conduct made the common proof regarding brand-loyal Loestrin 24 consumers unavailable . . . 
.""). "
1105,46," Defendants manufacture tension in highlighting that the EPPs' pre-Asacol class excluded ""[a]ny 'brand loyalist' consumers or 
third-party payors who purchased Loestrin 24 Fe and who did not purchase any AB-rated generic equivalent after such generics 
became available."" EPPs' Mot. for Class Certification 13; see also Defs.' Sur-Reply 35 n.31. But this can hardly be seen as an 
admission that its proposed TPP class includes brand loyalists. That a TPP did not purchase generic Loestrin 24 once it became 
available is of no moment when we have evidence that, with sustained and robust generic competition, each TPP likely would 
have made at least one such purchase. "
1106,47," Defendants take issue with what they call Dr. French's ""individualized"" approach. See Defendants' PowerPoint Slide: Issues 
with IPP Class Certification and Trial Timing 4 (Sept. 11, 2019), ECF No. 1230-6. But it is only in response to Defendants' 
criticism that Dr. French undertook this analysis: Defendants mount a challenge to Dr. French's analysis by plucking out 
uninjured TPPs; the EPPs demonstrate why this is wrong."
1106,48," With respect to damages, see supra Part II.B.2.e. "
1107,49," To the extent any claims were pled in the EPPs' Complaint, see ECF No. 165, but are not pressed in the EPPs' State Law 
Claims Chart, see ECF No. 1231, they are also dismissed. "
1109,1," A more comprehensive factual background is available in OT, LLC v. Harford Cty., Md., Civil Action GLR-17-2812, 2019 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 161973, 2019 WL 4598009, at *1-6 (D. Md. Sep. 23, 2019). "
1110,2," Plaintiffs compiled a binder filled with what they deem to be offensive posts from various social media platforms. It was entered 
into evidence as Exhibit E at the hearing in June, 2018."
1110,3, Delegate McDonough lost the primary election for County Executive. Delegate Impallaria currently represents District 7.
1110,4," From the hearing transcript, it is not entirely clear whether Glassman was describing this particular conversation or a different 
one as ""threatening."" See Hearing Transcript, ECF 130 at 29. For the purposes of this motion, I have drawn a reasonable 
inference in Plaintiffs' favor. "
1111,5," More precisely, Judge Russell ordered issuance of use and occupancy permits and/or certificates and sewer and water hook 
up permits for certain town houses, and upon completion of certain administrative steps. The specific details are available at 
ECF 133."
1111,6," Judge Russell's Order is technically a partial grant and partial denial. He granted the motion to the extent that Plaintiffs sought 
damages under RLUIPA against the Delegates, since damages against state officials are prohibited under the statute. ECF 145 
at 4 n.2. The motion was otherwise denied. "
1113,7," The Delegates do not appear to challenge the threshold legal question of whether the rights at issue were clearly established. 
Rather, they contend ""it is not well-established that [their] actions could form the basis of a conspiracy."" ECF 199-1 at 18 
(emphasis added). In other words, they contest whether the right is one ""of which reasonable persons would have known"" in 
these particular factual circumstances, not whether the right was clearly established in the first instance. This contention is a 
rehash of the Delegates' arguments, in their Motion to Dismiss, about the underlying statutes at issue. See, e.g., ECF 57-1 at 31 
(""To state a claim under § 1981 or § 1982, a plaintiff must show an 'intent to discriminate on the basis of race,' and no such 
intent can be attributed to either Delegate Impallaria or Delegate McDonough.""). As Judge Russell explained in OT v. Harford 
County, ECF 217 at 25, the question of intent is replete with factual questions that should be decided by a factfinder. "
1114,8," The Delegates are not prohibited from raising qualified immunity as a defense at trial. For instance, after the jury renders its 
decision, the Delegates are free to move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the basis of qualified immunity. See, e.g., 
Wolfe v. Routzahn, 953 F.Supp. 2d 627, 633 (D. Md. 2013). "
1115,9," However, to the extent that Plaintiffs have sued the Delegates in their official capacities as state officers, summary judgment is 
granted to the Delegates on counts I-V. States are not ""persons"" within the meaning of § 1983, and state officials cannot be 
sued in their official capacity for monetary relief. Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 64, 109 S. Ct. 2304, 105 L. Ed. 
2d 45 (1989); see also Williams-El v. Dunning, 816 F.Supp. 418, 420 (E.D. Va. 1993) (stating officers sued in their official 
capacities for monetary relief are not ""persons"" under § 1983). Furthermore, Plaintiffs have not identified any injunctive relief that 
they seek from the Delegates. "
1116,10," In any event, this Court denied summary judgment on these counts with respect to the County Defendants. See OT, LLC v. 
Harford County, Maryland, No. GLR-17-2812, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161973, 2019 WL 4598009 (D. Md. Sep. 23, 2019). Since 
Plaintiffs have established genuine questions of material fact as to the existence of an underlying conspiracy, the conduct of the 
County Defendants are imputed to them at this stage. Cf. Yates v. Hagerstown Lodge No. 212, 878 F.Supp. 788, 803 (D. Md. 
1995) (""Yates need not plead an overt act against each defendant since a single act by one conspirator may sustain a 
conspiracy claim.""). "
1117,11," Since Plaintiffs do not oppose entry of summary judgment with respect to Judicial Review of Administrative Acts, ECF 204 at 
20 n.15, the Court grants summary judgment to the Delegates on Count XVI. "
1118,12," This Court notes that the question of whether Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights provides a private cause of 
action is undecided. See Booth v. Maryland, 337 F. App'x 301, 311 (4th Cir. 2009). "
1121,1," Appellant's initial complaint against respondents was filed in August 2012. (Pellitteri v. Wellquest International, Inc. (Feb. 1, 
2016, B264094), 2016 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 752 [nonpub. opn.], p. 2 (Pellitteri II).) On January 11, 2014, respondent 
Ackerman died, and on May 18, 2015, the parties filed a stipulation and order for Lydia Ackerman as Executrix of the Estate of 
Michael Ackerman to be substituted as a defendant in this litigation."
1121,2," Wellquest filed a motion for summary judgment, or in the alternative, summary adjudication of legal issues. The trial court 
granted the motion for summary judgment on October 19, 2017. "
1122,3," The ""Introduced Parties"" were ""Dave Richmond, Mark Levine, Gary Kohn, Lenny Sands, Jacqueline Amenta, Richard 
Mazzaglia as individuals, and Modern Media, Revolutionary Products,, Inc., Evolutionary Products, Inc., Modern Interactive 
Technology, Inc., Lasco, Lohan Media, and each of their officers, shareholders, directors and companies . . . which are owned 
by or wholly owned subsidiaries of each of the Introduced Parties companies and each of the parties and/or entities officers, 
shareholders, directors and referrals that are introduced to WQ by PCS who WQ has not entered into agreements with nor done 
business with prior to PCS's promotion of WQ to the Introduced Parties and introduction of WQ to The Introduced Parties."""
1122,4," On March 19, 2008, appellant emailed Ackerman with a subject line ""assignment."" The email stated that PCS assigned ""its 
things to a new corp that eric [sic] opened up so the new corp bank account I'm opening today will be under Direct 2 Market, 
Inc., a California Corporation."" Appellant further indicated that she would ""use Direct 2 Market, Inc. as the primary corp."" On July 
8, 2008, appellant provided Ackerman with the new banking information for Direct 2 Market, stating, ""please make this company 
the payee from now on, on all."" "
1124,5," The SAC set forth the following causes of action: (1) breach of oral joint venture agreement; (2) breach of oral partnership 
agreement; (3) breach of oral agreement; (4) breach of written agreement; (5) breach of fiduciary duty; (6) fraud; (7) conversion; 
(8) money had and received; (9) unjust enrichment; (10) quantum meruit; (11) accounting; (12) declaratory relief; and (13) unfair 
competition."
1124,6," As the demurrer was sustained in its entirety, the motion to strike was rendered moot."
1124,7," In addition, respondents pointed out that PCS's corporate charter was revoked in 2008, and its current corporate status was 
""permanently revoked."" "
1126,8," Specifically, appellant cites Evidence Code section 1521 [""The content of a writing may be proved by otherwise admissible 
secondary evidence""]; Evidence Code section 1523 [oral testimony may be admissible to prove the content of a writing if ""the 
proponent does not have possession or control of a copy of the writing and the original is lost or has been destroyed without 
fraudulent intent on the part of the proponent of the evidence;"" and ""Neither the writing nor a copy of the writing was reasonably 
procurable by the proponent by use of the court's process or by other available means""]. (Evid. Code, § 1523 subd. (b) & (c)(1).) 
Appellant also cites the following case law: Dart Industries, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co. (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1059, 1069, 124 
Cal. Rptr. 2d 142, 52 P.3d 79 [the contents of lost documents may be proved by secondary evidence and the law does not 
require the contents of such documents to be proved verbatim]; Meeks v. Autozone, Inc. (2018) 24 Cal.App.5th 855, 866, 235 
Cal. Rptr. 3d 161 [error to exclude plaintiff's testimony as to the offensive content of missing emails that defendant sent to her]; 
Westport Ins. Corp. v. Cal. Cas. Mgmt. Co. (N.D.Cal. 2017) 249 F.Supp.3d 1164, 1172, judgment corrected (N.D.Cal. May 30, 
2017, No. 3:16-cv-01246-WHO) 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82449 [exemplar insurance policy admitted to prove contents of 
insurance policy at issue]."
1126,9," Appellant claims that under Nevada law any corporation may be revived and the revival relates back as if the corporation's 
rights had at all times remained in full force and effect. (Citing Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 78.180; AA Primo Builders, LLC v. 
Washington (Nev. 2010) 126 Nev. 578, 245 P.3d 1190, 1197.) "
1127,10," The court indicated that it made evidentiary rulings regarding the recently-procured assignment. Appellant has not provided an 
adequate appeal as to any specific evidentiary ruling of the court. She includes the single sentence: ""For all the same reasons, 
the trial court erroneously sustained defendants' objections to plaintiff's declarations and exhibits supporting her cause of action 
for breach of oral agreements."" This broad argument is inadequate. Appellant does not give the legal basis for the trial court's 
decision to exclude her declarations and exhibits, and fails to make any reasoned argument as to the validity of the trial court's 
grounds for exclusion of specific evidence. Her sweeping statement that the trial court erroneously sustained defendants' 
objections is insufficient to show that the trial court abused its discretion, and we are not required to search the record to seek 
grounds for possible error. (Guthrey v. State of California (1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1115, 75 Cal. Rptr. 2d 27 [""'The reviewing 
court is not required to make an independent, unassisted study of the record in search of error . . . .'""].) Therefore the argument 
is waived. (Hernandez v. First Student, Inc. (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 270, 277, 249 Cal. Rptr. 3d 681 [""When an appellant raises 
an issue 'but fails to support it with reasoned argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived'""].)"
1127,11," While appellant argues that respondents improperly raised the argument regarding the Direct 2 Market assignment in their 
reply brief on summary judgment, the trial court found that the presentation of this argument in the reply brief was appropriate, 
because ""this subsequent assignment only came up after the motion for summary judgment was filed."" "
1128,12," The sham pleading doctrine prevents plaintiffs from ""'""amending complaints to omit harmful allegations, without explanation,

Springs, Inc. (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 336, 344, 179 Cal. Rptr. 3d 161 (Larson).) "
1131,13," At the time the demurrer to the cause of action for breach of oral contract was sustained, the summary judgment regarding 
appellant's standing to sue under the written PCS/Wellquest agreement had not yet been filed. Thus, the trial court credited 
appellant's allegations that the written agreement was entered by ""PCS, by and through [appellant] and her related persons and 
entities."" In other words, at the time of the demurrer, the trial court took as true appellant's position that she had standing to 
enforce the PCS/Wellquest agreement. We decide cases on the record and facts before the trial court at the time of its ruling. (In 
re Marriage of Jacobs (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 832, 835, 179 Cal. Rptr. 169.)"
1131,14," Appellant alleged that this non-circumvent agreement was in fact made with her ""through her entity, Creative Campaigns."""
1131,15," In her reply brief on appeal, appellant attempts to get around her allegation in the SAC of a single oral agreement in 2002 by 
stating that she was merely using a shorthand for all of her agreements with respondents, not just a single 2002 agreement. 
However, a plain reading of the SAC does not reveal such an allegation. Instead, appellant's breach of oral agreement cause of 
action alleges a single oral agreement, entered into in 2002, through which the parties allegedly agreed to various terms. "
1132,16, The exhibits are not attached to the copy of the contract in the record on appeal.
1132,17," Because appellant's breach of fiduciary duty cause of action was based on her causes of action for breach of agreements, we 
decline to discuss it in detail. As her causes of action for breach of agreement fail, her cause of action for breach of fiduciary 
duty grounded in those agreements also fails."
1132,18, The SAC was filed in September 2016. 
1134,19," Appellant's new allegations concerned respondents' alleged secret marketing of the Mercier detangling hairbrush, 
misrepresentations regarding margins, purchases and sales of the Magic Bullet, marketing of a knockoff of the Pin Curlz, which 
appellant alleges was her intellectual property, and circumventing appellant's rights to share products produced by Modern 
Media, a company appellant introduced to respondents."
1134,20," Magic Bullet was sold by Lenny Sands, one of the ""Introduced Parties"" identified in the written PCS/Wellquest agreement. "
1139,1," Robinson ""worked as a seasonal Tax Preparer primarily at Jackson Hewitt's Rockland, Maine location from 2017 through 
2018."" (Id. ¶ 19.) Jennings ""worked as a seasonal Tax Preparer for a Jackson Hewitt franchise . . . in Long Beach, California, 
from 2016 to 2017."" (Id. ¶ 20.) Gibson ""worked as a seasonal Tax Preparer and Manager for Jackson Hewitt franchise locations 
in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, from 2002 to 2007 and from 2014 to 2016."" (Id. ¶ 21.)"
1139,2," On the same day, Carson Newbauer filed Newbauer v. Jackson Hewitt Tax Serv., Inc., Civ. No. 18-679 (E.D. Va.) 
(""Newbauer"") in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. (ECF No. 31, at 2.) On March 28, 2019, the 
Honorable Robert G. Doumar consolidated Newbauer and three other cases against Jackson Hewitt in the Eastern District of 
Virginia and transferred them to the District of New Jersey. Id. Newbauer was the first case filed, which is relevant for statute of 
limitation purposes. Newbauer is no longer a named plaintiff in this matter. "
1141,3," Defendants argue that neither the No-Poach Clause nor the No-Poach Penalty could have caused Plaintiffs' injuries, because 
neither applied to Plaintiffs. (Def. Br. at 8; Reply Br. at 2-3 n. 6.) First, they point out that the No-Poach Clause does not explicitly 
prevent Defendants or franchisees from hiring from other franchisees. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, nevertheless, ""operated 
under the same policy to effectuate and enforce the Conspiracy."" (SAC ¶ 63.) As pleaded, Plaintiffs' overall allegations are 
sufficient to show the No-Poach Clause's role in a conspiracy causing Plaintiffs' injuries. Second, Defendants argue that the No-
Poach Penalty never applied, pointing to the Franchise Disclosure Document (""FDD"") and Franchise Agreement, which they 
provide. (ECF No. 69-2.) The Court may consider these documents without converting this motion to a motion for summary 
judgment, as Plaintiffs explicitly rely on them in the SAC. (See, e.g., SAC ¶¶ 44-47, 50, 58.); In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. 
Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). The documents do not resolve the factual dispute on whether the No-Poach Penalty 
applied, and at this stage, the Court will accept as true Plaintiffs' allegations on the No-Poach Penalty's applicability. See Flora v. 
County of Luzerne, 776 F.3d 169, 175 (3d Cir. 2015)."
1141,4," The Third Circuit has also analogously found antitrust standing where an allegedly illegal no-hire agreement caused plaintiffs to 
be ""precluded from selling their services [in a competitive market]."" Eichorn v. AT & T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 142 (3d Cir. 2001), 
as amended (June 12, 2001)."
1141,5," To the extent Jennings' employment does not fall within the 24-month window, Robinson's clearly does, and this is sufficient to 
grant Plaintiffs injunctive standing. See Freedom from Religion Found. Inc., 832 F.3d at 481 n.14 (finding the Court ""need not 
address the standing of the other plaintiffs to pursue injunctive relief"" when it found one plaintiff had standing to do so). "
1142,6," Defendants argue Plaintiffs first must ""demonstrate 'some cognizable danger of recurrent violation'"" exists, in order to invoke 
the voluntary cessation doctrine. (Reply Br. at 10 n. 22 (quoting W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. at 633)). As noted above, Plaintiffs 
have pleaded the No-Poach Penalty still affects them, and the AOD alone does not prove their injuries have stopped, and so 
there plausibly remains a potential cognizable danger of recurrent violation. "
1143,7," Plaintiffs bring claims under both §§ 1 and 3 of the Sherman Act. (SAC ¶ 122.) Section 3's language is virtually the same as § 
1's, but extends § 1's prohibitions to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. Therefore, this Court will analyze Plaintiffs' § 3 
claims under the same standards as it does Plaintiffs' § 1 claims."
1143,8," The ""courts have limited their attention to [these] two essential elements."" BanxCorp v. Bankrate Inc., Civ. No. 07-3398, 2012

U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129098, 2012 WL 3988182 (D.N.J. Sept. 11, 2012). The test in full requires plaintiffs prove: ""(1) concerted 
action by the defendants; (2) that produced anticompetitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) that 
the objects of the conduct pursuant to the concerted action were illegal; and (4) that it was injured as a proximate result of the 
concerted action."" Mylan Pharms., 838 F.3d at 441. "
1144,9," The factors Defendants argue show that they and franchisees are not separate entities under the Sherman Act (Def. Br. at 20) 
are insufficient at this stage. See Am. Needle, Inc., 560 U.S. at 198 (noting that while entities may have ""common interests such 
as promoting [their] brand, they are still separate, profit-maximizing entities, and their interests in [the conduct in question] are

1157,57," Kenu also cites Comcast Cable Communications, LLC v. OpenTV, Inc., 319 F.R.D. 269 (N.D. Cal. 2017), but that case 
involved declaratory-judgment claims for noninfringement, as opposed to invalidity. Id. at 271. Noninfringement and invalidity are 
not entirely analogous. Among other things, whereas invalidity can be determined in the context of the patent-in-suit alone, 
noninfringement can be determined only in the context of a specific product accused of infringing the patent. See, e.g., Asustek 
Computer Inc. v. AFTG-TG LLC, No. 5:CV 11-00192-EJD, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149330, 2011 WL 6845791, at *13 (N.D. Cal. 
Dec. 29, 2011) (""[W]ithout identifying the accused products, there simply is no way to adjudicate an infringement claim.""). The 
plaintiff in Comcast did not sufficiently plead what its products were, leaving the defendant and the court unable to determine 
what the plaintiff sought by way of a declaration of noninfringement. See Comcast, 319 F.R.D. at 273-74 (""To return to the 
example of count eight, it is impossible to infer from the amended complaint even a general idea of what [plaintiff's] Xfinity TV 
Anywhere or Xfinity.TV.net services are, much less how they fail to meet the [patent-in-suit's] limitation of 'determining, using an 
electronic program guide, an interactive application associated with a broadcast program.' Again, count eight is representative of 
counts one through ten, all of which similarly lack adequate factual allegations to support inferences of non-infringement."") 
(citations to record omitted). Mr. Dror's invalidity claims do not present an analogous issue."
1157,58," Several courts in this district have taken a different approach than the approach that the cases that Kenu cites have taken. 
Those courts have found a declaratory-judgment plaintiff's simply alleging that the patents-in-suit are invalid under various 
sections of the patent statutes, without pleading anything more, to be sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. ASUSTeK, "
1158,2011," U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149330, 2011 WL 6845791, at *13; Wistron Corp. v. Phillip M. Adams & Assocs., No. C-10-5548 EMC, 
2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46079, 2011 WL 1654466, at *11 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 28, 2011). Those courts cite to this district's Patent Local 
Rules and have held that ""[b]y requiring the party claiming invalidity to flesh out and support its invalidity contentions early on, 
the Patent Local Rules fulfill the function of Twombly and Iqbal"" and thus do not require a declaratory-judgment plaintiff to plead 
additional facts regarding his invalidity contentions in his complaint. ASUSTeK, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 149330, 2011 WL 
6845791, at *13; accord Wistron, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46079, 2011 WL 1654466, at *11 (denying motion to dismiss invalidity 
claims that pleaded only that each patent-in-suit fails ""to satisfy the conditions and requirements for patentability as set forth inter 
alia, in Sections 101, 102, 103, and/or 112 of Title 35 of the United States Code,"" without more, because ""requiring a heightened 
pleading of invalidity would circumvent this Court's Patent Local Rules which require detailed disclosures as to invalidity 
contentions soon after the suit is filed. . . . By requiring the party claiming invalidity to flesh out and support its invalidity 
contentions early on, the Patent Local Rules fulfill the function of Twombly and Iqbal.""). In light of the fact that Mr. Dror has 
highlighted an invalidity theory and identified specific pieces of prior art — i.e., has done more than simply recite sections of 
patent statutes and assert invalidity as a conclusion — the court need not decide between the approaches taken by cases like 
ASUSTeK and Wistron and the cases that Kenu cites. Cf. Fitness Anywhere, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136443, 2014 WL 4802432, 
at *2 (noting that ""[c]ourts in this district have disagreed over the amount of specificity required to satisfy Rule 8(a) when an

See Exergen, 575 F.3d at 1327 n.3 (""The substantive elements of inequitable conduct are: (1) an individual associated with the 
filing and prosecution of a patent application made an affirmative misrepresentation of a material fact, failed to disclose material

not bound by state court cases regarding the federal due process requirements for personal jurisdiction. Second, Plaintiff 
misreads Buckeye and attempts to use a specific jurisdiction ""minimum contacts"" analysis to argue general jurisdiction. Third, 
Plaintiff focuses on ""continuous and systematic"" contacts with the forum state while overlooking the critical part of the rule 
propounded by the Supreme Court: whether the contacts are so continuous and systematic to render Defendant

Belt, Plaintiff fails to detail where she saw and relied upon them. To the extent these phrases are not part of the screenshots or 
presented in Defendant's printout of Defendant's website, the Court declines to consider them. "
1195,1," The facts in this section are taken from Plaintiff's Fourth Amended Complaint (Doc. 83 (Am. Compl.)), and all well-pleaded 
factual allegations are presented in this section as true and construed in a light most favorable to Plaintiff. See In re Gold Res. 
Corp. Sec. Litig., 776 F.3d 1103, 1108 (10th Cir. 2015). Typically, if a court considers material outside the complaint, the matter 
becomes one for summary judgment. Inge v. McClelland, 725 F. App'x 634, 637-38 (10th Cir. 2018). The Court acknowledges 
that Plaintiff attached 93 pages of supporting documentation. The parties confined their briefing to the Amended Complaint, so at 
this stage of litigation, the Court will also limit its analysis to the allegations made within the Amended Complaint. "
1201,2," Despite the fact that Plaintiff discusses UNM faculty in this claim, he does not name the three departmental professors—
Brulotte, Smith, or Debenport. (Am. Compl. ¶ 225.) "
1203,3," Plaintiff's liberty interest argument is listed in the ""Substantive Due Process"" category in the Amended Complaint. (Am. Compl. 
¶¶ 255-63.) However, it is more appropriately analyzed against a procedural due process backdrop or separately. McDonald v. 
Wise, 769 F.3d 1202 (10th Cir. 2014). "
1207,4," Plaintiff also includes Tacea and Leister in Count XIV, but the Court later dismisses these claims. See infra Section V(c). "
1209,*, The Clerk of the Court is directed to amend the caption to conform to that above. 
1216,2," The district court also dismissed claims under the Robinson-Patman Act and Section 4 of the Clayton Act. Biocad does not 
appeal from those rulings."
1216,3," HN1[

to dismiss. Biro v. Conde Nast, 807 F.3d 541, 544 (2d Cir. 2015) (""We . . . accept[] as true the factual allegations in the

1216,4," A ""biosimilar"" is a ""biological product [that] is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in 
clinically inactive components""; and a biosimilar has ""no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the 
reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product."" 42 U.S.C. § 262(i)(2)(A)-(B). "
1218,5," HN4[
] While the term ""antitrust standing"" may give the impression of a jurisdictional obligation, ""the proximate causation 
requirement in antitrust standing requires a court to evaluate the merits of the action,"" and therefore ""its absence is not a 
jurisdictional bar to suit, but a failure to state a claim."" Lerner v. Fleet Bank, N.A., 318 F.3d 113, 129 (2d Cir. 2003), abrogation 
on other grounds recognized by Am. Psych. Ass'n v. Anthem Health Plans, Inc., 821 F.3d 352 (2d Cir. 2016); see Am. Psych 
Ass'n, 821 F.3d at 359 (""The Supreme Court has recently clarified . . . that what has been called 'statutory standing' in fact is not 
a standing issue, but simply a question of whether the particular plaintiff 'has a cause of action under the statute.'"" (quoting 
Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. 572 U.S. 118, 128, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014))). We 
therefore need not pass upon the antitrust standing question before determining the applicability of the FTAIA. "
1220,6," As the Supreme Court explained in Empagran, the FTAIA originated in a bill that initially referred only to ""export trade or export 
commerce."" 542 U.S. at 163 (quoting H.R. 5235, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., §1 (1981)). The House Report states: The Subcommittee's ""export"" commerce limitation appeared to make the amendments inapplicable to transactions that 
were neither import nor export, i.e., transactions within, between, or among other nations. . . . . Such foreign transactions should, for the purposes of this legislation, [**16]  be treated in the same manner as export 
transactions -- that is, there should be no American antitrust jurisdiction absent a direct, substantial and reasonably 
foreseeable effect on domestic commerce or a domestic competitor. The Committee amendment therefore deletes 
references to ""export"" trade, and substitutes phrases such as ""other than import"" trade. It is thus clear that wholly foreign 
transactions as well as export transactions are covered by the amendment, but that import transactions are not. House Report at 9-10 (citations omitted). "
1223,7," As the district court noted, the Complaint does refer to conduct that allegedly occurred in the United States, but it does not 
allege that those activities caused an injury in the United States import market. "
1224,1," The antitrust injury requirement stems from Section Four of the Clayton Act, which provides the right of action that allows 
private parties to sue for antitrust violations. Section Four reads, in relevant part: [A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States . . . without respect to the amount in controversy, [**30]  and shall recover 
threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee."

1236,1," In the alternative, Defendant also argues that Plaintiff has failed to allege any facts to establish that the Subject Vehicle fails to 
meet its basic purpose, and that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding design defects are irrelevant to claims of breaches of warranty. 
Plaintiff opposes. Since the Court dismisses Plaintiff's claim on the basis of vertical privity, these arguments are rendered moot."
1236,2," Plaintiff additionally alleges he is a third-party beneficiary between BMW and the original purchaser but fails to sufficiently 
provide any factual detail to substantiate a finding of a third-party beneficiary relationship with BMW. FAC ¶ 6. Further, federal 
district courts are split on whether to create a third-party beneficiary exception to the privity requirement under California law. 
See Mandani v. Volkswagen Grp. of Am., Inc., No. 17-CV-07287-HSG, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25381, 2019 WL 652867, at *6

split)). This Court declines to find a third-party beneficiary exception to California's privity requirement under Clemens. "
1238,3," Defendant alleges that under federal law, Plaintiff is required to first submit his claims to informal dispute settlement 
mechanism. 15 U.S.C. §§ 2302, 2310(a)(3), (d)(1), (e). Plaintiff opposes, stating that BMW failed to comply with federal 
regulations requiring certain disclosures be listed on the same page where the warranty text begins. In support for his argument, 
Plaintiff submitted a BMW warranty Service and Warranty Information manual as an exhibit attached to his opposition. Although 
the Court notes that the requisite disclosures in this attached exhibit are not listed on the same page where the warranty text 
begins, the Court also notes that the Subject Vehicle in question is not listed as one of the vehicles covered by the booklet in 
question. ECF No. 14 at 23, Ex. A at 1. Therefore, the booklet is inapplicable and if Plaintiff files an amended complaint, Plaintiff 
is directed to submit the Service and Warranty Information manual that covers the Subject Vehicle model. "
1241,1," The suit was initially filed in state court, and Argos removed it to federal court under the Class Action Fairness Act (""CAFA""), 
see 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(d), 1441, 1453. The Court is satisfied that diversity of citizenship is established between Vision and 
Argos. Vision is a Florida corporation with its principal place of business in Florida and Argos is a Delaware LLC and its sole 
member is Argos USA Corp, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Georgia. The Court found after a 
period of jurisdictional discovery that CAFA's $5 million jurisdictional amount in controversy requirement was met by aggregating 
the claims of the putative class members who paid the default fuel and environmental fee surcharges. See ECF No. 32 (Order 
denying remand)."
1241,2," These are new proposed class definitions, altered from the Complaint, that exclude transactions using the Georgia ticket, which 
is the Argos ticket attached to the Complaint. Argos argues that Vision's redefined class definitions are improper without 
amending the Complaint. The Court disagrees. While it is not permissible to broaden a class without amending the pleadings, it 
is permissible to seek certification of a narrower class without amendment. See Bouton v. Ocean Properties, Ltd, 322 F.R.D. 
683, 693 (S.D. Fla. 2017) (""[A] plaintiff may seek to certify a class definition narrower than the one proposed in the operative 
pleading without a new claim for relief [but] the converse is not allowed.""). The Court will evaluate class certification based on the 
class definitions as proposed in the motion because Vision has narrowed, not broadened, them."
1241,3," Argos provided customers no other explanation of how it used the surcharge money collected or how the surcharge rates were 
calculated beyond labeling them as ""fuel charges"" and ""environmental fees."" "
1242,4," In the Complaint, Vision affirmatively alleges that the surcharges were not related to Argos's actual costs. When asked about 
the factual basis for this allegation, Crook admitted he was not aware of any evidence supporting that statement in October 2015 
when he filed the Complaint. ECF No. 160-2, at 14."
1242,5," Crook testified somewhat inconsistently that he always negotiates the price of concrete in advance of a bid, ECF No. 160-2, at 
6, but also paid no attention to the contractual terms and did not know why Argos sometimes included the surcharges and 
sometimes did not, ECF No. 160-1, at 226. Although stating that he negotiated prices, as to the surcharges, Crook added, 
""[t]here was no rhyme or reason to why they charged [Vision] or when . . . I have no idea what motivated them to do it."" ECF No. 
160-1, at 243."
1242,6," During the relevant class period, the fuel charge increased from $11 per load to $12 per load effective January 5, 2015, and 
changed to $3.25 per cubic yard delivered, effective October 1, 2015. The letters show that the rate for environmental fees 
increased once during this period, from $1.25 per cubic yard to $1.50, effective October 2015. "
1243,7, The Georgia ticket attached to the complaint is dated February 2015.
1243,8," This represented a profit margin of between 23 and 24%, which surpassed Vision's ordinary 15% target margin (10% for 
overhead and 5% profit). Crook testified that in making bids, he uses an estimating software called ProEst to ensure that his bids 
cover all of Vision's costs plus an added percentage for overhead and profit. ECF No. 160-2, at 6-8."
1243,9," Christopher described Great Plains as the financial ""ending place"" for all of Argos's data. ECF No. 160-1, at 75-76. She 
confirmed that Argos also maintains a physical copy of the delivery tickets dating back eight years, commenting, ""[i]t's a lot of 
documents."" ECF No. 160-1, at 84 & 91. "
1244,10," When asked why this data and the needed calculations were not before the Court, Vision's counsel explained that there had 
been no serious dispute that Argos maintains electronic records showing the volume of concrete delivered per transaction. 
Vision argues that it is not required to prove damages at this stage but instead, it need only establish that a method is available 
for calculating them on a classwide basis. The Court agrees. Vision further notes that Argos itself has demonstrated this 
capability based on its own records, as shown on a spreadsheet containing volume data that Argos produced during 
jurisdictional discovery, and this was confirmed by Christopher's testimony. See Pla. Ex. 20 (a spreadsheet created in 
jurisdictional discovery, shows quantity delivered, ticket date, and customer) (ECF No. 131-4)."
1244,11," Argos retains physical copies of all purchase orders, but they are not searchable electronically."
1244,12," The Johnson Bros. purchase order and a GLF purchase order agreed to default rates and are signed by Argos. The four other 
purchase orders in evidence (from Cook Bros., Seretta Constr. Inc., Pettibone Concrete Constr., and Masonry Inc.), are either 
not signed or agreed to a nonstandard fee or no surcharges at all. Those transactions would be excluded from the proposed 
classes. "
1245,13," In the Waste Pro suit, the Escambia County Circuit Court certified a FDUTPA class based on environmental fees, finding that 
classwide proof could show that the terms were deceptive because Waste Pro had not explained to any customers what the 
""environmental fee"" covered, under what circumstances it could be imposed or increased, or that the environmental fee could be 
imposed arbitrarily. No class was certified on the fuel charge due to differences in what customers knew based on the contract 
terms. See Vision Constr. v. Waste Pro USA, Inc., Case No. 2015cv596-F (1st Jud. Circuit Escambia Cty., May 10, 2018), aff'd, 
Waste Pro USA v. Vision Constr. ENT, Inc., 282 So. 3d 911, 2019 WL 4458768 (Fla. 1st DCA 2019)."
1245,14," Ratner is a Certified Public Accountant (""CPA"") and certified fraud examiner (""CFE""), and also is accredited in business 
valuation by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. He focuses on forensic accounting and litigation support 
consulting, which is basically damage calculations, and he works on bankruptcy cases, providing solvency opinions for 
restructuring companies. Ratner has served as an expert in numerous cases, including as the Department of Justice's expert in 
the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill multidistrict litigation and as a plaintiff's expert on ""ability to pay"" in the Florida tobacco Engle 
Progeny cases. Vision's counsel conducted no voir dire and made no objection to Ratner's qualifications or designation as an 
expert. Based on his qualifications and experiences, the Court found Ratner qualified to testify as an expert in damages 
calculations."
1245,15," Ratner explained the types of contracts commonly used in the construction industry and said the construction contractor 
routinely passes along every dollar of cost while also marking up the cost for profit. ECF No. 160-1, at 309-319."
1245,16," Alexander is a CPA and CFE with over three decades of professional experience. He is also certified in financial forensics and 
has extensive experience in auditing and consulting services, applying revenue and expense accounting methods and analyzing 
business performance. He has testified as an expert in federal and state court cases as well as arbitration proceedings on the 
subject of damages, and his experience included work in the BP Deepwater Horizon multidistrict litigation. Alexander's 
qualifications were not challenged, and the Court designated him as Vision's rebuttal expert on damages. "
1246,17," Argos moves to strike portions of Alexander's rebuttal testimony. The Court finds it unnecessary to rely on any damages 
expert testimony for purposes of deciding the Motion for Class Certification, and therefore, the Motion to Strike is moot. Also, in 
support of its Motion to Strike, Argos produced new evidence consisting of charts and spreadsheets summarizing Argos's 
expense data during the five years of the originally proposed class period, presumably attempting to show that Vision cannot 
prove damages because Argos spent more in direct fuel and environmental costs than it collected in surcharges. See ECF No. 
118-3,-4,-6,-7. Vision argues that the Court should not consider this self-serving, attorney-drafted evidence because it 
prematurely addresses the merits and not issues of class certification. The Court agrees that this additional evidence delves too 
deeply into the merits to be resolved before merits discovery has occurred, and it is not necessary to the dispositive class 
certification issues."
1246,18," FDUTPA prohibits ""[u]nfair methods of competition, unconscionable acts or practices, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
in the conduct of any trade or commerce."" Fla. Stat. § 501.204(1). "
1247,19," Vision alleges that Argos engaged in practices that are ""deceptive and unfair."" A practice may be both unfair and deceptive or 
it may be unfair without being deceptive; for this reason, courts consider unfair practices and deceptive acts as presenting 
""distinct lines of inquiry."" Orkin Exterminating Co., Inc. v. F.T.C., 849 F.2d 1354, 1365, 1368 (11th Cir. 1988) (also noting 
deception is a form of unfair consumer practice). An ""unfair practice"" is ""one that offends established public policy and one that is 
immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers."" PNR, Inc. v. Beacon Prop. Mgmt., Inc., 
842 So. 2d 773, 777 (Fla. 2003) (internal marks omitted). An unfair practice has also been addressed through a 3-prong test 
based in part on federal law, which requires an injury (1) that is substantial, (2) not outweighed by countervailing benefits to 
consumers, and (3) that consumers could not reasonably have avoided. Porsche Cars N. Amer., Inc. v. Diamond, 140 So. 3d 
1090, 1096-97 (Fla. 3d DCA 2014). Argos argues that the ""reasonable avoidance"" standard requires too much individualized 
review to permit class certification. However, the Eleventh Circuit has declined to apply the ""reasonable avoidance"" standard 
when addressing a deceptive practice, characterizing ""reasonable avoidance"" as a subjective standard. See Democratic Rep. of 
the Congo, 614 F. App'x at 470 n.7 (noting an alleged deceptive practice must be judged from an objective point of view). It is 
clear that the facts asserted by Vision implicate a deceptive practice, which must viewed objectively, even if it is also considered 
unfair. Therefore, it is not necessary to discuss ""unfair practices"" as a separate line of inquiry or to apply the ""reasonable 
avoidance"" standard in this case."
1247,20," While unpublished opinions are not considered binding, they may be considered as persuasive authority. See 11th Cir. R. 36-
2; see also United States v. Futrell, 209 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir. 2000). "
1248,21," At the hearing, Vision requested an opportunity to seek a substitute a class representative, and the Court said it would 
consider Vision's request, if appropriate, after the class ruling. Any such request must be made by formal motion with briefing 
and with a showing of good cause for why the request was not made prior to the class hearing."
1248,22," The ""class definition is a tool of case management"" that ""settles the question of who the adversaries are, and so it enables the 
defendant to gauge the extent of its exposure to liability and it alerts excluded parties to consider whether they need to 
undertake separate actions in order to protect their rights."" Abbott v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 725 F.3d 803, 810 (7th Cir. 2013); 
see also Bouton v. Ocean Properties, Ltd, 322 F.R.D. 683, 694 (S.D. Fla. 2017). "
1249,23," Vision notes that Karhu is an unpublished Eleventh Circuit case and thus not binding. Also, an Eleventh Circuit panel has 
acknowledged a circuit split over whether the ""administrative feasibility"" requirement is implicit or actually exceeds the Rule 23 
requirements, noting that the Eleventh Circuit has not yet addressed this in a published opinion. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC v. 
Belcher, No. 18-90011, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 18088, 2018 WL 3198552, at *3 (11th Cir. June 29, 2018) (finding it was 
unnecessary to reach the issue in resolving the appeal). The Seventh Circuit has declined to follow the standard set out in 
Karhu, criticizing it as a ""heightened"" ascertainability requirement that unnecessarily raises the bar for class certification, 
""skewing the balance"" that must be struck when deciding class certification, which already sufficiently requires a clearly defined 
class based on objective criteria under Rule 23. Mullins v. Direct Digital, LLC, 795 F.3d 654, 657-58 (7th Cir. 2015). By contrast, 
other circuits, consistent with Karhu, require a plaintiff to demonstrate the ""administrative feasibility"" of the class definition as 
implicit within the rule. See, e.g., Byrd v. Aaron's Inc., 784 F.3d 154, 163 (3d Cir. 2015); Brecher v. Republic of Argentina, 806 
F.3d 22, 24-25 (2d Cir. 2015). Vision does not argue that the ""administrative feasibility"" standard should not apply but instead 
argues that the proposed classes are administratively feasible. Thus, although the Eleventh Circuit has not spoken on the issue 
in a published opinion, the Court will consider and analyze the class definition under the standard set out in the unpublished 
opinions of Karhu and also Bussey."
1249,24," It is not necessary to identify each class member before certification, but the court must be able to identify class members by 
the proposed definition at some stage of the proceedings. See Karhu, 621 Fed. Appx. at 952 (Martin, J., concurring) (citing 
Newberg on Class Actions § 3.3 (5th ed. 2012))."
1249,25," More precisely, the FDUTPA classes are defined as: All individuals and entities to whom Argos delivered materials in Florida and who paid Argos the default fuel surcharge (also 
known as the fuel charge) [and a separate class for those who paid the default rate for environmental fees] at any time from 
November 1, 2014 through [July 1, 2016]. ECF No. 119, at 28. During the hearing, Vision altered the ending date for the class periods, acknowledging that they must end 
on July 1, 2016, when Argos began using a form contract that included an arbitration clause and class action waiver."
1249,26," The contract subclasses are defined as: All individuals and entities to whom Argos delivered materials in Florida and who (1) paid Argos a default fuel surcharge 
(also known as the fuel charge) [and a separate subclass for those who paid the default rate environmental fees] from 
November 1, 2014 through [July 1, 2016], and (2) entered into the Standard Argos Contract. ECF No. 119, at 28-29. "
1251,27," Rule 23(b) defines class action types as cases where (1) separate actions would create a risk of inconsistent adjudications, (2) 
final injunctive relief would be appropriate respecting the class as a whole, or (3) that ""questions of law or fact common to class 
members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other 
available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)."
1251,28," However, typicality is not met for claims based on the environmental fees. As noted above, Vision lacks standing to represent 
a class of customers who paid the default rate for environmental fees because Vision paid a negotiated rate for them on its only 
transactions within the proposed class period. Therefore, its injury also is not typical of those customers who paid the default 
rate for environmental fees."
1251,29," Argos went to great lengths at the hearing to show that Vision did not suffer actual economic harm overall because it recouped 
all damages by passing the surcharge costs downstream to its own customers. Argos argued that this ""passing on"" defense and 
a voluntary payment defense (that is, that Vision paid the surcharges despite having knowledge that the surcharges were not 
related to actual costs), would present individualized issues that are not typical of the class and would predominate over the 
common issues, defeating class certification. Vision in turn raised a significant issue regarding the legality of Argos's ""passing 
on"" defense, which originates in antitrust law, and argued the absence of any factual basis on this record to support Argos's "
1252,," voluntary payment defense. The Court has considered these issues but ultimately finds it unnecessary to address them at this 
time because, on the present record, as discussed infra, Vision's motion for class certification fails on other grounds. The legal 
issues not addressed in this Order may be raised in dispositive motions following discovery."
1252,30," Vision is undoubtedly represented by qualified and experienced counsel, well able to vigorously prosecute the class claims, 
and there is no argument otherwise. "
1253,31," The Court acknowledges that proof of deception and thus liability on the FDUTPA claim is not dependent on Crook's 
subjective understanding, given that FDUTPA uses an objective standard of deception. See Carriuolo, 823 F.3d at 989. His 
adequacy as a class representative, however, is another question."
1253,32," Argos also argues that Vision profited from its only transaction within the class period and that this benefit places Vision in 
conflict with other putative class members who did not similarly benefit from the alleged wrongdoing. See Valley Drug, 350 F.3d 
at 1192-93 (commenting in the federal antitrust context, where courts must ""overlook the potential net gain"" when deciding 
antitrust damages, that the net gain need not be overlooked when considering the Rule 23 analysis and potential conflicts 
among class members). The record reflects that on the East Hill project, Vision paid the purportedly deceptive default rate fuel 
charges but then recouped all of its costs, plus a hefty profit. This overall net benefit may indeed place Vision at odds with 
putative class members who were not contractors in a position to similarly benefit from the purportedly deceptive surcharges. 
But on this record, that factor is speculative because no such customer testified. The Argos customers who testified were all 
contractors, whose practice, like Vision's, was to ensure that their company recovered all costs through their own project bidding. 
All of them nonetheless share the same interest in recovering a valueless overcharge. Thus, while Vision's net economic gain 
could potentially reduce its incentive to diligently pursue recovery of the overcharge, this alone does not create a substantial 
conflict with other class members. "
1256,1," Unless otherwise stated, the background facts are taken from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint, ECF No. 89, and are presumed to 
be true. "
1257,2," The CANAERO Contract and CANAERO Procedures are included as attachments to the Amended Complaint, so the Court will 
consider them as part of the pleadings. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c)."
1257,3, Plaintiffs have not provided the equivalent U.S. Dollar amount. 
1260,4," Although Defendants separately filed Motions to Dismiss, each explicitly incorporates the arguments of the other Defendants. 
Thus, the Court will consider Defendants' arguments collectively. "
1261,5," Additionally, because Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under § 1962(c), ""[their] charge of conspiracy to violate RICO 
pursuant to § 1962(d) is also without merit,"" and it must also be dismissed. Kimberlin v. Nat'l Bloggers Club, Case No. GJH-13-
3059, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32528, 2015 WL 1242763, at *3 n.2 (D. Md. 2015) (quoting Foster v. Wintergreen Real Estate Co., 
363 F. App'x 269, 275 (4th Cir. 2010)) (internal quotations omitted). "
1262,6," Plaintiffs attempt to argue that an agreement among the alleged members of the enterprise is not a requirement. ECF No. 105 
at 46-47. However, some level of coordination is necessary in order for enterprise members to function as a continuing unit for a 
common purpose. See Griffin, 660 F.2d at 999. Indeed, as the Supreme Court stated in Boyle, ""[i]t is easy to envision situations 
in which proof that individuals engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity would not establish the existence of an enterprise. 
For example, suppose that several individuals, independently and without coordination, engaged in a pattern of crimes listed as 
RICO predicates—for example, bribery or extortion. Proof of these patterns would not be enough to show that the individuals 
were members of an enterprise."" Id. at 947 n.4."
1262,7," Pin cites to documents filed on the Court's electronic filing system (CM/ECF) refer to the page numbers generated by that 
system."
1262,8," The only specific communications to which the Amended Complaint refers are statements made by Cesar Laguna, 
AeroMexico's Vice President Comptroller, in a declaration filed in Sanchez. ECF No. 89 ¶¶ 108, 109. Plaintiffs characterize Mr. 
Laguna's statements as ""admit[ting] that there was an agreement or understanding among the member defendants at that time 
that each will charge the [Tax] to all passengers, including the Exempt [Passengers]."" Id. ¶ 108. The actual declaration, however, 
states only that Mr. Laguna ""believe[d] that ... United Airlines, American Airlines, and other airlines which fly routes into Mexico "
1263,," all provide this service to their passengers."" Id. ¶ 108. Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, this statement is silent as to whether an 
agreement existed, let alone the specifics of how that agreement came to exist. "
1265,9," Plaintiffs argue that whether Defendants made material misrepresentations is a triable issue that should not be decided at this 
stage. ECF No. 105 at 55. While it is certainly true that whether a misrepresentation is material is a question of fact, the Court 
must first determine whether the Amended Complaint alleges a misrepresentation. It does not. "
1266,10," Because the Court concludes that the Amended Complaint fails to plausibly allege an antitrust conspiracy, it need not address 
whether the alleged conspiracy created an unreasonable restraint on trade. "
1278,1," In 2014, the legislature amended the Connecticut Solid Waste Management Services Act. See Public Acts 2014, No. 14-94 
(P.A. 14-94). As part of the amendments, the legislature changed the name of the defendant to the Materials Innovation and 
Recycling Authority. See P.A. 14-94, § 1 (a), codified at General Statutes § 22a-261 (a)."
1278,2," General Statutes § 22a-268 provides in relevant part: ""The authority shall utilize private industry, by contract, to carry out the 
business, design, operating, management, marketing, planning and research and development functions of the authority, unless 
the authority determines that it is in the public interest to adopt another course of action. The authority is hereby empowered to 
enter into long-term contracts with private persons for the performance of any such functions of the authority which, in the 
opinion of the authority, can desirably and conveniently be carried out by a private person under contract provided any such 
contract shall contain such terms and conditions as will enable the authority to retain overall supervision and control of the 
business, design, operating, management, transportation, marketing, planning and research and development functions to be 
carried out or to be performed by such private persons pursuant to such contract. Such contracts shall be entered into either on 
a competitive negotiation or competitive bidding basis, and the authority in its discretion may select the type of contract it deems 
most prudent to utilize, pursuant to the contracting procedures adopted under section 22a-268a and considering the scope of 
work, the management complexities associated therewith, the extent of current and future technological development 
requirements and the best interests of the state. Whenever a long-term contract is entered into on other than a competitive 
bidding basis, the criteria and procedures therefor shall conform to applicable provisions of subdivision (16) of subsection (a) 
and subsections (b) and (c) of section 22a-266, provided however, that any contract for a period of over five years in duration, 
or any contract for which the annual consideration is greater than fifty thousand dollars shall be approved by a two-thirds vote of 
the authority's full board of directors. The terms and conditions of such contracts shall be determined by the authority, as shall 
the fees or other similar compensation to be paid to such persons for such contracts. The contracts entered into by the authority 
shall not be subject to the approval of any other state department, office or agency. . . ."""
1278,3," The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal and cross 
appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes § 51-199 (c) and Practice Book § 65-1. "
1279,4," General Statutes § 1-101bb provides: ""No quasi-public agency, as defined in section 1-120, or state agency may retain a 
lobbyist, as defined in section 1-91. The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to prohibit a director, officer or "
1280,," employee of a quasi-public agency or state agency from lobbying, as defined in section 1-91, on behalf of the quasi-public 
agency or state agency."""
1280,5," In count two of the complaint, the plaintiff asserted a common-law unsuccessful bidder claim alleging that the defendant's 
award of the liaison services contract to Brown Rudnick was the result of the defendant's fraud, corruption or favoritism, and 
defeated the integrity of the bidding process. The trial court ultimately granted the defendant's motion to dismiss that claim as 
moot, and that ruling is not at issue in this appeal. All references in this opinion to the complaint, substituted complaint and 
second substituted complaint are to the plaintiff's claim that the defendant violated the anti-trust act."
1280,6," General Statutes § 35-31 (b) provides: ""Nothing contained in this chapter shall apply to those activities of any person when said 
activity is specifically directed or required by a statute of this state, or of the United States."""
1280,7," See In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litigation, 833 F.3d 151, 157 (2d Cir. 2016) (""a private antitrust plaintiff must 
plausibly allege that [1] it suffered an antitrust injury and [2] it is an acceptable plaintiff to pursue the alleged antitrust violations,"" 
i.e., that it is ""an 'efficient enforcer'""); Gatt Communications, Inc. v. PMC Associates, LLC, 711 F.3d 68, 78 (2d Cir. 2013) (""[t]o 
determine whether a putative antitrust plaintiff is an efficient enforcer of the antitrust laws, we examine primarily the following 
factors: [1] the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury; [2] the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-
interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement; [3] the speculativeness of the 
alleged injury; and [4] the difficulty of identifying damages and apportioning them among direct and indirect victims so as to avoid 
duplicative recoveries"" [internal quotation marks omitted])."
1280,8," The trial court noted that the plaintiff had added the following new allegations to its antitrust claim in the substituted complaint: 
""Member municipalities pay fees to [the defendant] based [on] the amount of trash they dispose of, and [the defendant] uses the 
revenue generated by the fees to pay various expenses it incurs, including the [liaison services] contract. The initial [liaison 
services] contract was issued to Brown Rudnick in 2006 without any competitive bidding, and, in the following years, fewer and 
fewer entities submitted bids. As a result of this anticompetitive activity, Brown Rudnick's price had not been subjected to market 
competition, and the market for potential bidders was eliminated. As a further result, member towns of [the defendant] incurred 
greater, unnecessary expense by paying higher than market fees for similar work provided by other firms. [The defendant] and 
its member towns were paying Brown Rudnick $7000 a month at times when there was little or no documentation of work 
actually performed. At a December 8, 2011 meeting, the quality and costs issues with the Brown Rudnick [liaison services] 
contract led one [of the defendant's] board member[s] to state that he never observed a representative of Brown Rudnick at any 
meeting he attended, that he was unaware of any outreach by Brown Rudnick to municipalities in his area, and that the [liaison 
services] contract seemed to be an unnecessary cost passed on to customers. By granting a monopoly to Brown Rudnick for the 
[liaison services] contract and allowing it to bill a flat rate without any analysis of its appropriateness, [the defendant] harmed its "
1281,," member towns by passing on these costs through tipping fees and engaged in anticompetitive activity. [The plaintiff] also alleges 
that [the defendant's] conduct constituted bid rigging, which is a per se anticompetitive activity."" The substituted complaint also 
included a count alleging, for the first time, that Nonnenmacher had published defamatory statements about Hennessy. The trial 
court ultimately granted the defendant's motion to strike that count as procedurally improper and denied the plaintiff's motion to 
amend the substituted complaint to include the defamation count and to cite in Hennessy and Nonnenmacher as parties. Those 
rulings are not at issue in this appeal."
1281,9," The plaintiff made the following new allegations in the second substituted complaint: (1) ""[a]s part of their conspiracy, in order to 
cloak the nature of some of the services, [the defendant] and Brown Rudnick agreed that the . . . liaison services would be 
provided on a flat fee basis . . . and that the services would be generically described on the invoices""; (2) ""Brown Rudnick 
proposed an hourly rate . . . that was higher than the hourly rate proposed by [the plaintiff]""; (3) ""[the defendant] and Brown 
Rudnick were both aware that the number of hours anticipated each month . . . was fabricated and without any basis""; (4) ""[t]he 
market for . . . liaison services includes many providers such as public affairs businesses and government relations 
professionals""; (5) ""[the plaintiff] is a participant in that market""; (6) ""[the defendant] engaged in conduct to subvert competition 
for . . . liaison services by maintaining a private agreement with Brown Rudnick . . . for a flat fee . . . regardless of the amount of 
services provided""; (7) ""[the defendant] agreed to pay that fee in order to secure impermissible lobbying services""; (8) ""[i]t was 
known in the market that [the defendant] would not consider anyone other than Brown Rudnick for the [liaison services] 
contract""; (9) ""[w]ith [the defendant's refusal] to consider any bidders other than Brown Rudnick, the number of firms bidding on 
the [liaison services] contract steadily declined""; (10) in 2007, the defendant's chief executive officer ""stated [that] he would 
'revisit' the [request for qualifications] and return to the [defendant's] [b]oard with a 'stable' of choices . . . [but] he did not do so . . 
. [and] continued to engage in anticompetitive activity to ensure that Brown Rudnick received the contract""; (11) in 2009, ""[the 
defendant] colluded to rig the bidding process to arrange for two existing vendors for non-municipal government liaison services 
to submit bids for the [liaison services] contract in order to give the appearance of open bidding""; (12) the defendant's conduct 
""led many providers of [liaison] services to refuse to participate in [the defendant's] public bidding process because of the 
understanding [that] the contract would only be awarded to Brown Rudnick""; (13) ""[d]ue to the poor quality of the performance of 
the [liaison services] contract . . . several municipalities left [the defendant]""; (14) ""Brown Rudnick's fee for its . . . liaison services 
was inflated over the market rate""; (15) ""[i]n 2002, before [the defendant] engaged in anticompetitive activity with Brown Rudnick, 
[the defendant] received substantially similar services for a monthly fee of $4000""; (16) ""[b]y engaging in anticompetitive activity . 
. . the quality of services provided under the [liaison services] contract was compromised, and Brown Rudnick's inflated price 
[had] not been subjected to market competition""; and (17) ""[the plaintiff] notified the attorney general of this action."" "
1282,10," In Lafayette, the United States Supreme Court held that, HN2[
] ""[w]hile a subordinate governmental unit's claim to [the state 
action exemption from antitrust actions] is not as readily established as the same claim by a state government sued as such . . . 
an adequate state mandate for anticompetitive activities of cities and other subordinate governmental units exists when it is 
found from the authority given a governmental entity to operate in a particular area, that the legislature contemplated the kind of 
action complained of."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., supra, 435 U.S. 415. "
1285,11," We recognize that the court in Ethypharm S.A. France v. Abbott Laboratories, supra, 707 F.3d 223, noted that the lack of 
antitrust standing ""does not affect the subject matter jurisdiction of the [federal courts], as . . . standing [under article three, § 2, 
of the United States constitution] does, but prevents a plaintiff from recovering under the antitrust laws."" Id., 232. However, 
HN11[
] ""[s]tanding is not a matter of constitutional law in Connecticut, but is rather a rule of judicial administration based upon 
the principle that the appropriate parties to litigate a dispute are those who are injured or about to be injured. The purpose of this 
requirement is generally said to ensure the existence of that concrete adverseness between the parties that guarantees that the 
questions will be framed with the necessary specificity, that the issues will be contested with the necessary adverseness and 
that the litigation would be pursued with the necessary vigor . . . ."" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Manchester Environmental 
Coalition v. Stockton, 184 Conn. 51, 65, 441 A.2d 68 (1981), overruled in part on other grounds by Waterbury v. Washington, 
260 Conn. 506, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). As we have explained, it is well established under Connecticut law that whether a person 
is a proper party to bring a claim and whether the claim is within the zone of interests that the statute was intended to protect 
implicate the subject matter jurisdiction of our state courts. See, e.g., AvalonBay Communities, Inc. v. Orange, supra, 256 Conn. 
567. We recognize that the distinction between subject matter jurisdiction, which implicates the court's authority to entertain and 
adjudicate a matter, and the authority to act pursuant to a statute, which implicates the court's authority to grant relief on the 
merits, has caused ongoing confusion in our courts. See, e.g., In re Jose B., 303 Conn. 569, 574, 34 A.3d 975 (2012) (""the 
distinction between challenges to the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction and challenges to the exercise of its statutory 
authority is not always clear"" [internal quotation marks omitted]). We also recognize the ""rule that every presumption is to be 
indulged in favor of jurisdiction . . . [in order] to bring about a trial on the merits of a dispute whenever possible and to secure for 
the litigant his day in court . . . by allowing the litigant, if possible, to amend the complaint to correct the defect . . . ."" (Citations 
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 579. It is arguable that, in light of this ongoing confusion and our policy of favoring 
entertaining a case on its merits, we should take a hard look at this court's statutory standing jurisprudence and consider 
whether we should take steps to conform to the federal rule. Because the parties in the present case have not comprehensively 
briefed this issue, we leave it for another day."
1285,12," General Statutes § 35-28 provides in relevant part: ""Without limiting section 35-26, every contract, combination, or conspiracy 
is unlawful when the same are for the purpose, or have the effect, of: (a) Fixing, controlling, or maintaining prices, rates, 
quotations, or fees in any part of trade or commerce . . . or (d) refusing to deal, or coercing, persuading, or inducing third parties 
to refuse to deal with another person."" "
1287,13," In other words, the fact that anticompetitive conduct is measured by such effects; see Bridgeport Harbour Place I, LLC v. 
Ganim, supra, 303 Conn. 215-16; does not necessarily mean that proof of such effects establishes an antitrust injury. For 
example, if a business chooses to purchase supplies from a vendor whose products are more expensive than those sold by 
competitors because the business has family connections with the chosen vendor, it does not follow from the fact that other 
vendors may choose not to compete to provide the product because they are aware of the family connections, and the fact that 
the business will have increased expenses that it may well pass on to its customers, that the business has violated the antitrust 
act. As we discuss more fully subsequently in this opinion, ""the antitrust laws protect only the purchaser's freedom to make a 
choice""; Doron Precision Systems, Inc. v. FAAC, Inc., 423 F. Supp. 2d 173, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); not a competitor's right to 
compete."
1287,14," This court also observed in Ganim that, even if the plaintiff had adequately alleged an antitrust injury, federal courts have 
concluded that government action is exempt from the antitrust laws under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. United Mine Workers 
v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr 
Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 136-37, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961); see Bridgeport Harbour Place I, LLC v. Ganim, 
supra, 303 Conn. 218-19; see also George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., 424 F.2d 25, 34 (1st Cir.) 
(distinguishing ""the narrow issue of whether . . . conduct is exempt from antitrust regulation"" under Noerr-Pennington doctrine, 
which exempts attempts to reduce competition through legislation and regulation from Sherman Act, from ""the broader issue of 
whether [the conduct] has in fact violated the Sherman Act""), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 850, 91 S. Ct. 54, 27 L. Ed. 2d 88 (1970). In "
1288,," support of this conclusion, this court in Ganim quoted extensively from the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Coll 
v. First American Title Ins. Co., 642 F.3d 876 (10th Cir. 2011), which held that a private party's use of bribery or other corrupt 
means to influence government regulation or legislation does not violate federal antitrust laws ""because the purpose of the 
Sherman Act is to regulate business, not political activity."" Id., 896; see Bridgeport Harbour Place I, LLC v. Ganim, supra, 218-
22. This court assumed in Ganim that the Noerr-Pennington state-action immunity principle applies not only to a party's use of 
bribery or other corrupt means to influence legislation or regulation, but also to the use of corrupt means to obtain a government 
contract. A number of federal courts have concluded, however, that that is not the case. See George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. 
Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., supra, 33 (""Noerr stressed the importance of free access to public officials vested with significant 
[policy making] discretion. We doubt whether the [c]ourt, without expressing additional rationale, would have extended the Noerr 
umbrella to public officials engaged in purely commercial dealings when the case turned on other issues.""); id. (""The state 
legislatures, by enacting statutes requiring public bidding, have decreed that government purchases will be made according to 
strictly economic criteria. . . . We conclude, therefore, that the immunity for efforts to influence public officials in the enforcement 
of laws does not extend to efforts to sell products to public officials acting under competitive bidding statutes."" [Citation 
omitted.]); F. Buddie Contracting, Inc. v. Seawright, 595 F. Supp. 422, 439 (N.D. Ohio 1984) (""Noerr-Pennington is concerned 
with the needs of a representative democracy in the field of public policy making. These needs are not at issue in this case, [in 
which] the parties are concerned with the award of a competitively bid contract which only incidentally involves a governmental 
body. The basis for the exemption, therefore, does not apply to this case.""); Czajkowski v. Illinois, 460 F. Supp. 1265, 1279 (N.D. 
Ill. 1977) (""Courts have recognized that some public activities, such as the purchase of equipment for governmental facilities, 
involve purely commercial dealings between business and government. . . . In these circumstances, the mantle of state 
sovereignty is removed and the state activities will be subjected to antitrust scrutiny."" [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks 
omitted.]), aff'd mem., 588 F.2d 839 (1978). Because we conclude that the plaintiff in the present case has not adequately 
pleaded an antitrust injury in the first instance, we need not consider whether this court correctly assumed in Ganim that the 
Noerr-Pennington doctrine exempts from the antitrust act claims arising from the award of a public contract. "
1289,15," We note that there is federal case law supporting the contrary position. See Stearns Airport Equipment Co. v. FMC Corp., 170 
F.3d 518, 526 (5th Cir. 1999) (stating in dictum that evidence that entity used bribery or threats to obtain public contract can give 
rise to antitrust violation); George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., 424 F.2d 25, 34 (1st Cir.) (""efforts to 
influence government officials acting under statutes requiring competitive bidding are within the scope of the antitrust laws""), 
cert. denied, 400 U.S. 850, 91 S. Ct. 54, 27 L. Ed. 2d 88 (1970); Doron Precision Systems, Inc. v. FAAC, Inc., 423 F. Supp. 2d 
173, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (stating in dictum that allegation of bribery, fraud or unethical procedures that corrupted public entity's 
award of contract might be sufficient to support claim of antitrust violation); F. Buddie Contracting, Inc. v. Seawright, 595 F. 
Supp. 422, 437 (N.D. Ohio 1984) (""[w]here a firm succeeds in tampering with the competitive bidding process in such a manner 
that competitive bidding becomes a farce, the [c]ourt believes that an unreasonable restraint of trade has occurred""). We find 
these cases to be unpersuasive. In George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., supra, 34, the court engaged in 
no analysis but simply made a conclusory statement. In F. Buddie Contracting, Inc. v. Seawright, supra, 437, the court relied on 
Richard Hoffman Corp. v. Integrated Building Systems, Inc., 581 F. Supp. 367 (N.D. Ill. 1984), which involved conduct that had 
the effect of limiting the public entity's choice of product. See id., 374 (""[i]n the present case, the choice of product is alleged to 
have been made by . . . the successful bidder, rather than the customer""). In Stearns Airport Equipment Co. v. FMC Corp., 
supra, 526, the court relied on F. Buddie Contracting, Inc., and another case, Indian Head, Inc. v. Allied Tube & Conduit Corp., 
817 F.2d 938, 947 (2d Cir. 1987), aff'd, 486 U.S. 492, 108 S. Ct. 1931, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1988), in which the defendant's 
conduct had restricted purchasers' freedom to choose a product. See id., 947 (efforts by defendant, which manufactured steel 
electrical conduit, to rig vote on proposal allowing use of polyvinyl chloride conduit at meeting of organization that established 
product and performance requirements for electrical systems gave rise to antitrust violation). In Doron Precision Systems, Inc. v. 
FAAC, Inc., supra, 183, the court relied on Interstate Properties v. Pyramid Co. of Utica, 586 F. Supp. 1160, 1163 (S.D.N.Y. 
1984), in which the court discussed the sham exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See footnote 14 of this opinion. The 
fact that Noerr-Pennington immunity does not apply to certain corrupt conduct does not necessarily mean that the conduct is 
anticompetitive in the first instance. See George R. Whitten, Jr., Inc. v. Paddock Pool Builders, Inc., supra, 34 (distinguishing 
""the narrow issue of whether . . . conduct is exempt from antitrust regulation"" under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine from ""the 
broader issue of whether [the conduct] has in fact violated the Sherman Act"")."
1289,16," Similarly, we reject the plaintiff's claim that ""Ganim is distinguishable because . . . Ganim involved conduct that occurred after 
the contract was awarded, so there was no allegation that the bidding process was compromised."" (Emphasis in original.) The 
court in Ganim did not distinguish corrupt government practices that might discourage parties from competing for a government "
1290,," contract before the contract is awarded from corrupt practices that might discourage parties from completing the contract after 
the award so that another party, who is willing to participate in the corrupt practice, can complete it. The intent of the government 
actor is the same in both cases, namely, to ensure that the parties with which it deals will participate in the corrupt practice. As 
we have explained, refusing to award a government contract unless the contracting party agrees to participate in a corrupt 
practice may violate a host of laws, but it does not constitute an antitrust injury. See Bridgeport Harbour Place I, LLC v. Ganim, 
supra, 303 Conn. 217-18 (allegation ""that any general contractor that wanted to do business with the city could do so but had to 
pay to play"" was not adequate to establish prima facie case of anticompetitive impact). "
1292,17," We recognize, of course, that the trial court had no authority to overrule our decision in Cheryl Terry Enterprises, Ltd., that 
private parties have standing to bring an antitrust action against public entities arising from a violation of a competitive bidding 
statute. "
1295,1," MHC also makes claims under the Illinois Anti Trust Act. (Counts II and IV). There appears to be no dispute that these should 
be resolved in the same manner as the § 1 Sherman Act claims. Accord Collins v. Assoc. Pathologists, Ltd., 844 F.2d 473, 480-
81 (7th Cir. 1988). "
1296,2," Dr. McCarthy defines the outpatient surgical market more narrowly than Dr. Bowblis. Dr. Bowblis includes the entire outpatient 
surgical market in his definition while Dr. McCarthy would only include those outpatient surgical services provided by MHC. 
Regardless, both sides agree that the only relevant market that MHC competes in is the market for outpatient surgical services."
1296,3," One of the ASC competitors — Marion Surgery Center, LLC — closed in 2016"
1296,4," HealthLink is not an insurer, but rather a ""rental"" network that operates as a go between for insurers and medical care 
providers. It negotiates contracts with providers for its network used by insurers. For purposes of the analysis in this case, there 
is no material difference between HealthLink and the other major insurers. "
1297,5," MHC alleges that SIH also had exclusivity provisions in contracts with five other smaller payers. But MHC makes no claim for 
damages as to these Irrelevant Payers. TAC ¶79; Bowblis Dep., p. 24. "
1299,6," There is a minor inconsistency between the testimony of Lane and VanMeter as to whether the BCBS offer was [REDACTED] 
or [REDACTED] of Medicare. This difference is not material to the undersigned's recommendation."
1299,7," Def. Ex. 25, VanMeter Dep, p. 118 - 127; Def. Ex. 70, p. 4,5,10,11."
1299,8," The Plaintiff suggests that the Supreme Court has established a special standard for evaluating a motion for summary 
judgment in antitrust cases. See Plt. Resp. at 1, fn 1 citing Eastman Kodak Indus. Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 U.S. 
451, 469, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992). But a close review of that case reveals that it simply employs the normal 
summary judgment in the context of the facts of that case — i.e. .all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the non-moving 
party. "
1303,9," In the informal objection process SIH cited to Judge Herndon's ruling on its Motion to Dismiss where this claim was dismissed 
for not alleging the government payers are ""significant sources of input."" Doc. 57, at 21. This dismissal was at the pleading stage 
and is not controlling. We now have a developed record graphically illustrating the significant differences between government 
and private payers, both generally and specifically as to MHC. The undersigned has no difficulty concluding these two categories 
are not interchangeable. "
1306,10," SIH argues that this is standard practice was a technicality that was not coercive. Zudycki Dep. at 152 - 53. But other 
testimony suggested although the contracts were usually renegotiated when this happened, sometimes they were terminated. 
Biederman Dep. 65-66. In any event, at this stage these facts are capable of more than one inference. "
1307,11," In the informal objection process, MHC also cited to testimony from Rex Budde, but that testimony concerned HFN, a different 
insurer. Plt. Ex. 9, Budde Dep. at 130. "
1308,12," As part of the informal objection process MHC also submitted an exhibit and Dr. Bowblis's backup files for the proposition that 
BCBS, HA and HealthLink patient prices went up between 2010 - 2016. But this evidence is not in the record and was not 
considered."
1308,13," In the informal objection process, relying on Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 
149 (1982), MHC argued that proof of suppression of patient choice would, alone, amount to a cognizable antitrust injury. But 
McReady does not so hold. The case analyzed the injury necessary to assert standing, did not analyze the requirements 
necessary to prove an antitrust injury to the market, and does not upend the substantial body of caselaw establishing those 
requirements since McReady was decided."
1308,14," MHC also submitted exhibits 27, 28 & 29 to bolster the proposition that patients were forced to higher priced hospitals as a 
result of being out-of-network with MHC. Exhibit 27 was not disclosed in discovery and inadmissible under Fed.R.C.Pro. 
37(e)(1). Exhibit 29 is partially compiled from an unknown source. In any event, MHC has submitted sufficient evidence, for 
purposes of summary judgment, for the proposition that prospective OON patients for MHC opted to obtain treatment at more 
expensive hospitals. "
1309,15," In the informal objection process, MHC asserted that the proper standard should be a showing of ""intention and preparedness"" 
to enter a market. It relies on Grip-Pak, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, 694 F.2d 466, 475 (7th Cir. 1982). But Grip-Pak established a 
threshold showing necessary for prospective entrants to a market to bring suit for damages. It did not establish a standard for 
causation. In fact, the Grip-Pak court explicitly stated that it was leaving for another day the ""precise dimensions"" of the "
1310,," requirement, evidencing its function as a test for limiting who could bring a damages suit rather than establishing an element of a 
claim. Id."
1310,16," The undersigned does not separately evaluate the question of whether the exclusivity provisions prevented MHC from 
contracting with Healthlink. The answer is clearly no. MHC did enter into a contract with HealthLink — twice — and remains in 
network with HealthLink."
1310,17," In the informal objection process, MHC argued that SIH had not actually raised this issue of causation in its briefing. It argues 
that the undersigned impermissibly relies on an issue for which it had no opportunity to address. In support of this proposition 
MHC cites Edwards v. Honeywell, 960 F.2d 673, 675 (7th Cir. 1992) & Malhotra v. Cotter & Co., 885 F.2d 1305, 1310 (7th Cir. 
1989). While the undersigned takes no issue with the legal proposition, it cannot be said this argument was not raised — raised 
vigorously in fact — by SIH. The fact that the undersigned has analyzed it under the rubric of causation, and that SIH argued it 
extensively under a different heading, does not give MHC license to ignore it. It does not take a clairvoyant to know that an 
argument raised over six pages of SIH's brief should be responded to. MHC ignored it at its peril. "
1314,1," ""Monopsony power is market power on the buy side of the market. As such, a monopsony is to the buy side of the market what 
a monopoly is to the sell side and is sometimes colloquially called a 'buyer's monopoly.'"" Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Ross-Simmons 
Hardwood Lumber Co., Inc., 549 U.S. 312, 320, 127 S. Ct. 1069, 166 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2007). "
1315,2, This program is codified at 42 U.S.C. § 256b.
1315,3," Rather than set forth the entirety of the voluminous facts in this background section, the Court provides the facts relevant to 
each of Plaintiff's claims in the context of discussing each claim. "
1316,4," In evaluating Plaintiff's New Mexico Antitrust Act claims, the Court generally follows authority interpreting claims under Section 
2 of the Sherman Act. The NMAA specifically directs courts to construe the state act ""in harmony with judicial interpretations of 
the federal antitrust laws."" N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-15; accord Smith Machinery Corp. v. Hesston, Inc., 1985- NMSC 004, 102 
N.M. 245, 694 P.2d 501, 505 (N.M. 1985) (recognizing that the NMAA specifically provides that it is to be construed ""in harmony 
with judicial interpretations of the federal antitrust laws"") (citing N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-15); Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2010- 
NMSC 035, 148 N.M. 713, 242 P.3d 280, 291 (N.M. 2010) (explaining that ""[t]o prove a cause of action under the Antitrust Act 
the Legislature requires that 'the Antitrust Act shall be construed in harmony with judicial interpretations of the federal antitrust 
laws'"" and that ""'[t]his construction shall be made to achieve uniform application of the state and federal laws prohibiting 
restraints of trade and monopolistic practices'"") (quoting N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-15) (additional citation omitted). Moreover, New 
Mexico courts have specifically held that they draw upon federal interpretations of the Sherman Act to define the scope of liability 
under the NMAA, see Smith Machinery Corp., 694 P.2d at 505 (""In the absence of New Mexico decisions directly on point, we 
look to federal cases involving allegations of antitrust arrangements under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.""), and that ""[i]t is the 
duty of the courts to ensure that New Mexico antitrust law does not deviate substantially from federal interpretations of 
antitrust law,"" Romero, 242 P.3d at 291. Thus, throughout this opinion, the Court relies on federal authority interpreting the 
Sherman Act in deciding the NMAA claims. "
1317,5," For purposes of their motion, Defendants accept Dr. Reiff's identification of the relevant markets in connection with Plaintiff's 
monopolization and attempted monopolization claims. Doc. 624 at 6 n.7. Accordingly, there is no dispute of fact as to this issue. "
1319,6," The contracts are only semi-exclusive because University of New Mexico (""UNM"") is part of the insurance network for all major 
insurers with insureds located in Albuquerque, with the exception of PHP insureds. P. Ex. 2-A ¶ 19. Accordingly, PHS's contracts 
with insurers prevent those insurers from contracting with Lovelace Hospital and other non-PHS providers, but do not prevent 
them from contracting with UNM."
1319,7," There is similarly no evidentiary support for Plaintiff's contention that PHS allowed United and Cigna to include it in their 
network only in return for ""discriminatory reimbursement rates."" Doc. 677 at 32. "
1321,8," Because Plaintiff identified no allegations in the SAC relevant to the third Reazin factor, the Court declined to address it. 
Similarly, Plaintiff has not presented evidence relevant to this factor. Accordingly, the Court again declines to address it. "
1324,9," ""Capitated"" patients are those patients insured by PHP for whom PHP pays PMG a predetermined rate for all services, 
regardless of the amount of treatment required. P. Ex. 2-A ¶ 95. When a PMG capitated patient is treated by an outsider 
provider, PHP pays that provider in accordance with the terms of the contract between PHP and that provider; PMG is then 
responsible to reimburse the cost of treatment to PHP. P. Ex. 1-18 at 101-103. The amount that PMG pays to PHP is considered 
by PHS to be a ""purchased medical cost."" Id. When a capitated patient is treated outside of the PHS system, the payment for the 
treatment represents a reduction in PHS's ""profit equal to the amount of the payment."" P. Ex. 2-A ¶ 95. Accordingly, it is a cost 
savings to the PHS enterprise to retain capitated patients for treatment by PMG physicians. "
1333,10, Lovelace acquired HOA in early 2015. 
1344,1," The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge for all purposed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c)."
1344,2," Because the allegations of the complaint are taken as true on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6), this section summarizes the 
allegations of Garcia's complaint as if true. Nothing in this order should be construed as resolving any issue of fact that might be 
disputed at a later stage of the case. "
1345,3," Garcia's attorney asserted at the hearing that at least one fatal crash has been caused by the wiring defect at issue in this 
case, but no such allegation appears in the complaint. "
1346,4," Garcia relies on the Ninth Circuit's decision in Mazza v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc., 666 F.3d 581, 595 (9th Cir. 2012), for 
the rule that overpayment for a product based on deceptive claims or omissions establishes injury in fact. See Opp'n at 10-11. 
That portion of Mazza—a case Harley-Davidson fails to address in its reply brief—concerns standing under Article III of the 
Constitution, not the UCL's requirement that a plaintiff ""has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of a 
violation."" See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17535. The Court need not address whether the test for ""injury in fact"" is the same 
under that statute as under Article III. "
1347,5," Although not relevant to the outcome of the present motion, the Court notes that which representations Garcia saw before he 
purchased his motorcycle is not an issue of state of mind, and thus likely must be pled with particularity under Rule 9(b). "
1349,6," The only case cited in the portion of Harley-Davidson's reply brief addressing this doctrine is in accord, holding that the primary 
jurisdiction doctrine was not appropriate because ""none of Plaintiffs' claims arise under the Safety Act or litigate any regulation or 
standard that the NHTSA has issued; rather, their claims arise under ordinary state law contract and tort principles,"" and the 
defendant ""[a]utomakers have not shown that any special agency competence is required to adjudicate these claims."" Lassen v. 
Nissan N. Am., Inc., 211 F. Supp. 3d 1267, 1279 (C.D. Cal. 2016); see Reply at 14-15 (dkt. 48) (citing only Lassen). "
1350,7," The Song-Beverly Act does not require privity, and Harley-Davidson does not argue that lack of privity warrants dismissal of 
Garcia's claim under that statute. See Cal. Civ. Code § 1792 (""Unless disclaimed in the manner prescribed by this chapter, every 
sale of consumer goods that are sold at retail in this state shall be accompanied by the manufacturer's and the retail seller's 
implied warranty that the goods are merchantable.""); In re MyFord Touch Consumer Litig., 46 F. Supp. 3d 936, 982 (N.D. Cal. 
2014)."
1350,8," Garcia's opposition exceeds the twenty-five page limit imposed by Civil Local Rule 7-3(a). The violation is not as severe as 
might be suggested by the number ""34"" on the final page of the brief, because the text of Garcia's argument is contained only on 
the pages numbered from 8 through 33, but that span nevertheless constitutes twenty-six full pages of argument. Although the 
Court excuses that violation in this instance, Plaintiff's counsel is admonished to comply with all applicable page limits going 
forward. Counsel is also instructed to follow the standard convention of using a separate numbering scheme for cover pages, 
tables of contents, and the like, so that the number of pages used for argument is readily apparent from the page numbers. "
1352,9," After briefing concluded, each party filed a statement of recent decision attaching decisions of other courts considering similar 
claims against Harley-Davidson by other plaintiffs. In Nesbitt v. Harley-Davidson Motor Co., Inc., No. SUCV2019000603 (Ga. 
Sup. Ct. Oct. 14, 2019), a Georgia state court held that whether Harley-Davidson engaged in affirmative conduct necessary to 
support fraudulent concealment was an issue of fact inappropriate for resolution on the pleadings. See Pl.'s Stmt. of Recent 
Decision (dkt. 50). In Fisher v. Harley-Davidson Motor Co., Inc., No. 2:19-CV-14154-ROSENBERG/MAYNARD (S.D. Fla. Oct. 
18, 2019), the Southern District of Florida held that the plaintiff had not alleged affirmative acts of concealment as required under 
Florida law and dismissed with leave to amend. See Def.'s Stmt. of Recent Decision (dkt. 55). Neither case addresses the 
requirements of California law."
1352,10," Certain allegations of Garcia's complaint could perhaps be read as suggesting that Harley-Davidson in fact took affirmative 
acts to conceal the defect. See, e.g., FAC ¶ 67 (""Not only did Harley-Davidson hide the defect from the public, it instructed 
dealers to continue to sell and repair motorcycles without alerting any customers that the defect existed even though it knew of 
the defect as early as 2009 [sic; other portions of the complaint allege knowledge in 2008].""). Garcia's opposition brief, however, 
does not argue that Harley-Davidson engaged in affirmative acts of concealment, and the Court declines to consider that issue 
sua sponte. "
1358,1," The Seventh Circuit has suggested that, even when allegations of market power are insufficient to state a claim under the per 
se rule, an antitrust plaintiff can state a tying claim under the ""rule of reason"" by demonstrating that the tie-in's anticompetitive 
effects outweigh any procompetitive benefits. See Reifert, 450 F.3d at 317 n.2 (citing Jefferson Parish, 466 U.S. at 35 
(O'Connor, J., concurring)). The Court shall not have to consider this possibility separately because, under either the per se rule 
or the rule of reason, plaintiff must plausibly allege that there are two separate tied products, and as the Court will explain, he 
has not done so. "
1366,1," Claims brought under RESPA 12 U.S.C. § 2607 are subject to a one-year statute of limitations pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 2614. 
That period begins to run ""from the date of the occurrence of the violation, which generally refers to the date of closing for loan 
origination violations."" Fangman v. Genuine Title, No. RDB-14-0081, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 92273, 2017 WL 2591525 (D. Md. 
June 15, 2017) (quoting Grant v. Shapiro & Burson, LLP, 871 F. Supp. 2d 462, 470 (D. Md. 2012)). RICO claims are subject to a 
four-year statute of limitations that ""begin[s] to run from the date when the plaintiff should have known of the existence of a RICO 
injury."" Dickerson v. TLC The Laser Eye Center Institute, Inc., 493 Fed. Appx. 390, 393 (4th Cir. 2012) (citing Rotella v. Wood, 
528 U.S. 549, 556, 120 S. Ct. 1075, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1047 (2000)). Likewise, 15 U.S.C. § 15b imposes a four-year limitations 
period upon Sherman Act claims, which ""begins to run when a defendant commits"" an injurious act. Go Computer, Inc. v. 
Microsoft Corp., 508 F.3d 170 (4th Cir. 2007) (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 338, 91 S. 
Ct. 795, 28 L. Ed. 2d 77 (1971)). "
1367,2," Interestingly, West Town itself argues ""the Complaint is devoid of any allegation that these Plaintiffs ever received, much less 
saw, the allegedly fraudulent marketing materials."" ECF No. 17-1, p. 15 (markings omitted). "
1368,3," In the pertinent part, the statute reads: ""No person shall give and no person shall accept any fee, kickback, or thing of value 
pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise, that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement 
service involving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person."" 12 U.S.C. § 2607(a) "
1370,4," In contrast to a horizontal agreement, a vertical agreement is one between actors at different levels of the market, typically 
between a manufacturer and a distributor. See, e.g., Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 
79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984). Plaintiffs expressly state that they are not claiming West Town participated in an illegal vertical 
agreement. ECF No. 21, p. 26 (""West Town's arguments as to vertical price fixing can be disposed with summarily, because 
Plaintiffs do not allege that the relationship between West Town and All Star is 'vertical', nor that the price fixing and refusal to 
deal agreements are 'vertical agreements', nor do Plaintiffs allege that any of the pro-competitive effects characteristic of vertical 
agreements exist.""). "
1371,5," Plaintiffs also allege a refusal to deal scheme, otherwise known as a group boycott, by which West Town would ""refuse to deal 
with any title and settlement services company"" other than All Star. ECF No. 1, ¶ 40. Like their price fixing claim, the group 
boycott claim also fails because a group boycott must be among competitors to be per se unlawful. NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, 
Inc., 525 U.S. 128, 135, 119 S. Ct. 493, 142 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1998); Southern Volkswagen, Inc. v. Centrix Financial, LLC, 357 F. 
Supp. 2d 837, 848-49 (D. Md. 2005) (""For an agreement to be deemed a per se group boycott, it must be made among 
horizontal competitors.""); see also Campfield v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 532 F.3d 1111 (10th Cir. 2008) (""the claims are 
inadequately pled because State Farm and Lynx are not competitors, and therefore cannot engage in a per se illegal, horizontal 
restraint of trade""); Spectators' Communication Network Inc. v. Colonial Country Club, 253 F.3d 215 (5th Cir. 2001). Moreover, 
Plaintiffs have offered little detail concerning the refusal to deal portion of the alleged agreement. Indeed, the record suggests 
that West Town did not prevent prospective borrowers from procuring settlement services from companies other than All Star if 
they found a preferable or cheaper title company. See, e.g., ECF No. 1-17. "
1413,1," The putative class sought relief in the form of monetary damages, and brought the action along with a separate class that 
sought equitable relief. (See First Consolidated Am. Class Action Compl. 1, Docket Entry No. 317.) At the earliest stages of this 
litigation, multiple class actions, as well as individual lawsuits by large retailers, were filed against Defendants. All actions were 
consolidated together into a multi-district litigation in 2005 (the ""MDL""). See In re Payment Card Interchange Fee & Merch. Disc. 
Antitrust Litig., 986 F. Supp. 2d 207, 220 n.12 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (""Interchange Fees I""). Since the initial consolidation, a number of 
matters have been continuously added to the MDL, which now involves over seventy cases."
1413,2," The Second Circuit vacated in part because it found that unitary representation of the two classes (damages and injunctive) 
violated Rule 23(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the representative parties did not adequately protect the interests 
of the class), and the Due Process Clause (the named plaintiffs in the class action did not adequately protect the interests of all 
class members). Interchange Fees II, 827 F.3d at 228, 231 (citations omitted). Relevant to the Rule 23(b)(2) class action — the 
relevant action for the present motion — the Second Circuit concluded that ""members of the (b)(2) class were inadequately 
represented."" Id. at 231. "
1414,3," Documents and filings refer to the Rule 23(b)(2) action in a variety of ways. In the MDL, the Rule 23(b)(2) action is proceeding 
as Barry's Cut Rate Stores Inc. et al. v. Visa, Inc., et al., No. 05-MD-1720. In addition, the action is sometimes referred to as 
""Barry's"" and the class is sometimes referred to as the ""equitable relief class."" For the purposes of consistency across opinions, 
the Court uses the terms ""Rule 23(b)(2)"" and ""injunctive relief"" to refer to the action, as opposed to ""Barry's"" and ""equitable 
relief."""
1414,4," After additional extensive discovery and renegotiations, the named representatives of the Rule 23(b)(3) damages class and 
Defendants reached a new and separate settlement agreement, which this Court preliminarily approved on January 24, 2019. 
(Prelim. Approval Order, Docket Entry No. 7361); In re Payment Card Interchange Fee & Merch. Disc. Antitrust Litig., 330 F.R.D. 
11, 2019 WL 359981 (E.D.N.Y. 2019)."
1414,5," The processing of payment transactions that occur over the Visa and Mastercard networks and the actors involved, differ from, 
for example, the business model that American Express uses. See generally United States v. Am. Express Co. (""Amex I""), 88 F. 
Supp. 3d 143, 156-60 (E.D.N.Y. 2015), rev'd on other grounds, United States v. Am. Express Co. (""Amex II""), 838 F.3d 179 (2d 
Cir. 2016), aff'd sub nom., Amex III, 138 S. Ct. 2274, 201 L. Ed. 2d 678. "
1415,6," Third-party processors, as defined in the Complaint, are non-Visa, Mastercard, or member bank firms ""that perform[] the 
authorization, clearing, and settlement functions of a Visa or Master[c]ard Payment-Card transaction on behalf of a Merchant or 
a Member Bank."" (Compl. ¶ 9(dd).) "
1416,7," According to Plaintiffs, Visa and Mastercard ""have established complex 'default' Interchange Fee schedules, including the fee 
levels, the structure of the fees, such as the Interchange-Fee categories that are tiered by Merchant type, card type, and the 
Merchant's transaction volume, among other things."" (Compl. ¶ 90.) Plaintiffs also contend that ""[i]nterchange fees account for 
the largest portion of Merchant costs for accepting such cards."" (Id.) Visa's rules ""provide[] that 'Interchange Reimbursement 
Fees are determined by Visa and provided on Visa's published fee schedule.'"" (Id. ¶ 86 (citing Visa Product and Service Rule 
9.1.1.3).) Mastercard's rules ""provide[] that . . . '[MasterCard] has the right to establish default interchange fees and default 
service fees.'"" (Id. ¶ 87 (quoting Mastercard Rule 8.3).) Both networks' rules state that default interchange fees apply unless 
member banks of the networks set their own financial terms or created a bilateral interchange fee agreement between member 
banks, or, for example, ""Visa has entered into business agreements to promote acceptance and Card usage."" (Id. ¶¶ 86-87.) "
1417,8," ""The Durbin Amendment did not change the networks' rules prohibiting surcharging,"" Interchange Fees I, 986 F. Supp. 2d at 
215, nor did it ""allow for product-level discounting, by which a merchant could choose to discount a particular card type,"" id. at 
215 n.6."
1417,9," However, similar to the Durbin Amendment, the consent decrees did not affect the networks' no-surcharge rules. Interchange 
Fees II, 827 F.3d at 229 (""[P]ursuant to a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 2011, Visa and Mastercard agreed to 
permit merchants to discount transactions to steer consumers away from credit cards use. None of these developments affected 
the honor-all-cards or no-surcharging rules, or the existence of a default interchange fee.""). "
1424,10," In antitrust cases, plaintiffs must demonstrate both Article III standing and antitrust standing. Antitrust standing is a separate 
two-part test which requires a plaintiff to show (1) antitrust injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent, and (2) 
that plaintiff is the proper plaintiff in light of a series of specific factors. See, e.g., IQ Dental Supply, Inc. v. Henry Schein, Inc., 
924 F.3d 57, 62 (2d Cir. 2019); In re DDAVP Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 585 F.3d 677, 688 (2d Cir. 2009). The Court 
understands Bank Defendants' motion to only challenge the redressability prong of Article III standing. The Court therefore does 
not address antitrust standing. "
1428,11," The other two cases cited by Bank Defendants, McDaniel v. Board of Education, 956 F. Supp. 2d 887, 893 (N.D. Ill. 2013) and 
Justice v. Kuhnapfel, 985 F. Supp. 2d 334, 336 (E.D.N.Y. 2013), are also distinguishable. McDaniel is similar to Okpalobi and 
Thomas-Ateba in that the suit was brought against a government agency, seeking to enjoin it from proceeding with school 
closings, and the court determined that plaintiffs lacked standing because ""the Illinois legislature ha[d] empowered the Board, 
not the City, to administer [Chicago Public Schools]."" 956 F. Supp. 2d at 894. Thus, the court in McDaniel found that ""even if 
[p]laintiffs were to prevail in their claims against the City and this Court were to grant the injunctive relief they seek, the City 
would lack the power to carry out the injunction."" Id. For the reasons stated in the Court's analysis of Bank Defendants' reliance 
on Okpalobi and Thomas-Ateba, the Court finds that McDaniel is distinguishable. Finally, in Justice, this Court found that 
defendants ""lacked the power"" to return plaintiff's son to her because her son's ""custody status [was] the subject of a state court 
determination by a Michigan state court, and this Court lack[ed] the power to change that determination."" 985 F. Supp. 2d at 
337. Justice is markedly different in terms of the relief sought and the jurisdiction and ability of the Court to order the requested 
relief."
1428,12," This case is unlike cases in which courts could not redress the alleged injury. See, e.g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 
523 U.S. 83, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998); Coal. of Watershed Towns v. U.S. E.P.A., 552 F.3d 216, 218 (2d Cir. "
1429,2008," ). In Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, the Supreme Court found that the redressability prong was not met 
because the requested injunctive relief could not redress the plaintiff's injury, as ""[n]one . . . would serve to reimburse 
respondent for losses caused by the late reporting, or to eliminate any effects of that late reporting upon respondent."" 523 U.S. 
at 105-06; see also Coal. of Watershed, 552 F.3d at 218 (finding redressability not satisfied and that any relief would be 
speculative because there was no basis to conclude that the state would have taken any different action than the EPA did, 
meaning that the injury may very well have been the same). In Steel, the Supreme Court noted that although the injunctive relief 
requested was ""aimed at deterring petitioner from violation [of an act] in the future,"" the plaintiffs had not alleged a threatened 
injury, and that if they ""had alleged a continuing violation or the imminence of a future violation, the injunctive relief requested 
would remedy th[e] alleged harm."" Steel, 523 U.S. at 108-09. The Court further noted that it could not envision appropriate relief 
under the plaintiffs' general request that the court provide ""such further relief as the court deems appropriate"" that ""would serve 
to reimburse respondent for losses caused by the late reporting, or to eliminate any effects of that late reporting."" Id. at 105-06. 
As noted elsewhere in this opinion, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged a continuing violation and future threat of harm in the form 
of, inter alia, supracompetitive default interchange fees."
1429,13," Although Bank Defendants failed to raise this argument in the standing section of their opening brief, the Court nevertheless 
addresses it. "
1432,14," ""To survive a motion to dismiss, a Sherman Act claim must (1) define the relevant geographic market, (2) allege an antitrust 
injury, and (3) allege conduct in violation of antitrust laws."" Concord Assocs., L.P. v. Entm't Props. Tr., 817 F.3d 46, 52 (2d Cir. 
2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Bank Defendants argue that the third prong is not met. "
1435,15," Commentary by leading antitrust scholars Herbert Hovenkamp and Christopher R. Leslie lends support to Plaintiffs' theory that 
Bank Defendants have not withdrawn from an ongoing conspiracy. In one article, the authors note that ""because Section One 
condemns only concerted action, [price-fixing] firms may attempt to structure their relationship to appear to be the action of a 
unified single entity that is beyond the reach of Section One."" Herbert Hovenkamp & Christopher R. Leslie, The Firm as Cartel 
Manager, 64 Van. L. Rev. 813, 814 (Apr. 2011). In analyzing the Mastercard and Visa IPOs as a case study, the authors 
highlight the uniqueness of the fact that the banks relinquished their voting rights ""while having only a minority stake,"" and 
surmise that ""[t]he likely explanation for this strategy is that the participants were seeking to limit antitrust exposure by ceding 
'control' to a single firm with diverse, inactive shareholders, as opposed to a joint venture in which decisions were made by 
active participants,"" and that ""[t]he intended result would be that the IPOs would be treated as single entities for antitrust 
purposes rather than as collaborations involving agreements among rivals."" Id. at 869. The authors suggest that ""[e]ven though 
the banks are not voting decisionmakers in the firm, any rule that limits their individual behavior must be regarded as 
multilateral."" Id. at 871."
1435,16," However, as discussed supra, the D.C. Circuit subsequently overturned the district court's decision in Osborn, rejecting the 
argument that the IPOs effectively ended the conspiracies. "

change of coverage). Plaintiff's Opposition does not address this section. Defendants' Motion to Strike this section is granted as 
unopposed. "
1457,7," Because the request for injunctive relief is moot, it is unnecessary to address Defendants' alternative argument that the Court 
should apply the doctrine of abstention and decline to adjudicate Plaintiff's request for injunctive relief. "

challenged Cytek's cause of action for declaratory relief."
1461,4," In addition to basing its UCL claim on an alleged violation of the Sherman Act, Cytek, in an effort to ""preserve its right to 
appeal"" (see SACC at 19:26), has realleged, in support of its UCL claim, and without alteration, violations based on the above-
referenced tying arrangement and employee agreement. "

1478,2," In the SAC, Plaintiff claims he does not know the specific date when he signed the Purchase Contract but it was sometime after 
May 2006. (Dkt. No. 47, SAC ¶ 5.) This claim is in contradiction to the FAC where he alleges he signed the contract on May 18, 
2006, (Dkt. No. 24, FAC ¶ 100), and incorporated by reference the Purchase Contract he signed which is dated May 18, 2006.

must be brought ""within one year from the date of the occurrence of the violation."" 15. U.S.C. § 1640(e). This is in distinct 
contrast to the ILSA's statute of limitations where a claim must be brought ""three years after discovery of the violation or after 
discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence."" See 15 U.S.C. § 1711(a)(2). The discovery rule is

clearances. Clearances preclude distributors from licensing other theaters, either specifically named or encompassed in a

entered into a separate agreement). The ""honor-all-cards"" rule requires merchants to accept all Visa or MasterCard credit 
cards if they accept any of them, regardless of the differences in interchange fees. Multiple rules prohibit merchants from 
influencing customers to use one type of payment over another, such as cash rather than credit, or a credit card with a 
lower interchange fee. These ""anti-steering"" rules include the ""no-surcharge"" and ""no-discount"" rules, which prohibit 
merchants from charging different prices at the point of sale depending on the means of payment. Id. at 228-29. ""Plaintiffs allege[d] that these [anticompetitive] rules were adopted pursuant to unlawful agreements among the 
banks and Visa [and MasterCard],"" and ""that the banks owned and effectively operated Visa and MasterCard, such that Visa

dated Oct. 30, 2019, Docket Entry No. 7755.) On November 27, 2019, Jack Rabbit filed a notice of appeal of the Court's October 
30, 2019 decision. (Notice of Appeal, Docket Entry No. 7798.) "
1612,12, This is the only final approval factor that the Court did not consider at length in the Preliminary Approval Order. 
1615,13," In addition, as stated at the final approval hearing, the Court notes that at no time has any Branded Operator filed a motion 
over the issue of whether they own the claim to a pro rata share of the settlement, or whether the major oil suppliers own the 
claim. (Hr'g Tr. 15:13-14.)"
1615,14," As to the fourth factor, no such agreements exist. (Pls. Mem. 29.) "
1616,15," In addition to the reasoning set forth in the Preliminary Approval Order, the Court finds the declaration by the Honorable H. 
Lee Sarokin (ret.) assessing litigation risks to be persuasive, and agrees with his assessment that ""[t]he parties faced unusual 
and numerous risks in this litigation."" (See Judge Sarokin Decl. 3.) Judge Sarokin's declaration highlights, inter alia, the risks that 
Class Counsel faced, both at the outset of this litigation under the Eleventh Circuit's affirmation of a district court decision, Nat'l 
Bancard Corp. (NaBanco) v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 596 F. Supp. 1231 (S.D. Fla. 1984), aff'd 779 F.2d 592 (11th Cir. 1986), where an 
interchange fee established by the court had been sought but denied, and pursuant to the ""seismic shift in the payment card 
world"" that took place due to the Supreme Court's decision in Ohio v. Am. Express Co., 585 U.S.    , 138 S. Ct. 2274, 2285, 201 
L. Ed. 2d 678 (2018). (See Judge Sarokin Decl. 3-4, 8-9.) "
1617,16," At the request of the Court after the final fairness hearing, the parties submitted the names of three potential special masters 
— one of whom the Court will appoint to resolve claim dispute issues and other issues referred by the Class Administrator — as 
well as a proposed order appointing a special master. (See Nov. 2019 Letter; Proposed Order Appointing Special Master, 
annexed to Nov. 2019 Letter as Ex. C, Docket Entry No. 7791-3.) Counsel for Jack Rabbit has also submitted a special master 
recommendation and requests that: [A] separate Special Master be appointed to exclusively handle the resolution of claims made, by any Branded or 
Unbranded Gas Station Owner versus their distributor. That Special Master would adhere to distinct guidelines including 
incorporating a rebuttable presumption in favor of the Branded or Unbranded Gas Station Owner, as to any claim for 
distributed funds. Distributors would be required to present direct evidence of direct purchaser status and actual damages 
to overcome that presumption. "
1618,," (Mot. for Leave to File Doc. Letter Mot. in Resp., Docket Entry No. 7807.) The Court denies this application. The Court finds 
adequate the appointment of one special master to address all issues referred by the Class Administrator. If during the course of 
the administration of the settlement it becomes apparent that a second special master is needed, the Court will consider 
appointing one. As for the request that the Court establish a guideline to include a rebuttable presumption in favor of Branded 
Operators, the Court denies this request as there is no legal basis to do so."
1618,17," At certain times during the final fairness hearing, Class Counsel stated that ""based upon what [they had] seen to date,"" the 
major oil suppliers appeared to be the first payor of the interchange fee, and not the Branded Operators, thereby suggesting that 
the major oil suppliers and not the Branded Operators would be able to file claims. (See Hr'g Tr. 9:24-10:3; see also id. at 8:20-
21; 11:2-11.) After being pressed by the Court as to whether Class Counsel was actually taking a position on the matter, Class 
Counsel assured the Court that if a Branded Operator is ultimately deemed to own a claim, they would be represented by Class 
Counsel and would be able to file a claim. (See, e.g., id. at 79:22-25; id. at 81:5-7 (""If we think that they were improperly included 
on th[e] [Dismissed Plaintiffs] list . . . I'll tell you we're going to fight for them."").)"
1618,18," According to the Plan of Administration and Distribution, [t]he Class Administrator may also use the transactional database maintained by Mastercard and additional available data 
to determine a Claimant's Interchange Fees Paid. The Class Administrator may well determine [*208]  that due to 
limitations in available data, many Claimants' Interchange Fees Paid on Mastercard-Branded Card transactions will need to 
be estimated using data from Visa databases and reasonable assumptions concerning Mastercard-Branded Card 
transaction volume relative to Visa-Branded Card transaction volume and other pertinent information. (Plan of Administration and Distribution I-4.) "
1619,19," Although this is not an official Rule 23(e)(2) or Grinnell factor, analysis of the release provision of the Superseding Settlement 
Agreement will assist in determining whether relief is adequate for the class. The Court also separately discusses the release 
provision because of the concerns raised by the Second Circuit in its decision to vacate the prior settlement approval. "
1621,20," For this reason, the Court is not persuaded by McLaughlin's arguments that (1) even if the prospective release is allowable, 
the ""five-year immunity period"" should not be extended to the end of the duration of any appeals, and ""[t]here is no apparent 
rationale for extending a term certain during appeals except to penalize class members for taking appeals,"" and (2) the length of 
the release and its ""uncertain temporal scope"" makes it difficult to assess what class members are giving up in exchange 
because if appeals are made, it is unclear ""how many additional years' worth of class members' damage claims are to be 
exchanged for that same class fund recovery."" (McLaughlin Obj. 3-7.) "
1628,21," Valero Energy Corporation and Valero Marketing and Supply Company are listed as Dismissed Plaintiffs in the Superseding 
Settlement Agreement. (See Dismissed Plaintiffs, annexed to Superseding Settlement Agreement as App. B.) ""Dismissed 
Plaintiffs,"" as defined in the Superseding Settlement Agreement, means: the individual plaintiffs and former opt-out plaintiffs that have dismissed with prejudice an action against any Defendant and 
that are listed in Appendix B [of the Superseding Settlement Agreement], and any additional persons, businesses, or other 
entities included in an exclusion [*242]  request that those plaintiffs previously submitted to the Class Administrator in 
connection with the [Original] Settlement Agreement. (Superseding Settlement Agreement ¶ 3(t).) "
1630,22," At the final fairness hearing during the discussions surrounding Valero, counsel for Fikes Wholesale Objectors expressed 
concern that allowing previously excluded entities to rejoin the class would require an adjustment of the class exclusion 
takedown payment of $700 million. (See, e.g., Hr'g Tr. 109:16-110:3.) Class Counsel responded that ""if any Valero [B]randed 
[O]perators or other 'Dismissed Plaintiffs' can show that their claims were settled without authority, . . . there should be no effect 
on the takedown calculation."" (Nov. 2019 Letter 3.) Class Counsel further explained that ""[w]hile it is unclear exactly how many 
persons or entities (if any) will fall into the category of Dismissed Plaintiffs whose claims were settled without their authorization, 
our data suggests that they would constitute a tiny percentage of the class and thus have no effect on the takedown payments."" 
(Id. at 4.) The Court agrees that it is extremely unlikely that the inclusion of any, or the majority of Dismissed Plaintiffs into the 
class would in any way affect the takedown payment amount of $700 million. (See id.) However, out of an abundance of caution, 
and as agreed to by the parties, the Court included the following paragraph in the Final Approval Order: The parties to the Superseding Settlement Agreement have clarified that in the event the claims process under the Plan of 
Administration and Distribution results in any determinations that would have reduced the Class Exclusion Takedown 
Payments provided in the preceding paragraph, as calculated pursuant to Paragraph 22 of the Superseding Settlement 
Agreement, the Visa Defendants shall refund the [*249]  difference with respect to the Class Exclusion Takedown Payment 
made to them, and the Mastercard Defendants and the Bank Defendants shall refund the difference with respect to the 
Class Exclusion Takedown Payment made to them, by wire transfer to the Class Settlement Cash Escrow Account. (Final Approval Order ¶ 8.) "
1633,1," This summary of facts is taken from the First Amended Complaint. See ECF No. 23. At the 12(b)(6) stage, these facts are 
taken as true and viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. Cf. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A., 534 U.S. 506, 508 n.1, 
122 S. Ct. 992, 152 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2002) (""Because we review here a decision granting respondent's motion to dismiss, we must 
accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.""). "
1637,2," Typically, in a patent-antitrust case, the Federal Circuit's law applies to the patent issues, while the regional circuit's law applies 
to the antitrust issues. See Nobelpharma AB v. Implant Innovations, Inc., 141 F.3d 1059, 1067 (Fed Cir. 1998). In Nobelpharma, 
the Federal Circuit set out the rule: ""As a general proposition, when reviewing a district court's judgment involving federal 
antitrust law, we are guided by the law of the regional circuit in which that district court sits. However, we apply our own law, not 
regional circuit law, to resolve issues that clearly involve our own jurisdiction."" Id. The Federal Circuit reasoned that, because 
most cases involving fraudulently procured patents will be appealed to the Federal Circuit, it is ""in the best position to create a 
uniform body of federal law on this subject and thereby avoid the danger of confusion [that] might be enhanced if [it] were to 
embark on an effort to interpret the laws of the regional circuits."" Id. (internal citation omitted). The Federal Circuit's conclusion 
""applies equally to all antitrust claims premised on the bringing of a patent infringement suit,"" but regional-circuit law continues to 
apply to ""issues involving other elements of antitrust law such as relevant market, market power, damages, etc., as those 
issues are not unique to patent law."" Id. Following this rule, the Court ""applies the law of the regional circuit as to market definition."" TransWeb, 812 F.3d at 1307. 
Ordinarily, the Court would also apply Fifth Circuit law to the ""dangerous probability"" element. See Domed Stadium Hotel, Inc. v. 
Holiday Inns, Inc., 732 F.2d 480, 487-88 (5th Cir. 1984). But in this case, the effect of enforcing the patent is inextricable from 
the market share that HOTF could occupy. As the Fifth Circuit recognized in Xitronix Corp. v. KLA-Tencor Corp., 916 F.3d 429 "
1638,," (5th Cir. 2019), ""the last Walker Process case decided by the Fifth Circuit was in 1975, before the Federal Circuit was created."" 
Id. at 435. Thus, our regional circuit precedent offers little guidance on how assertion of a patent may impact a party's likelihood 
of achieving monopoly power and the resulting impact on the market. Accordingly, the Court applies Federal Circuit law to this 
issue as needed. "
1641,3," The Chandler Plaintiffs take issue with the phrase ""in the conspiracy."" See Pls.' Resp. 15, ECF No. 26. They state that ""[t]he 
quotes from the MV Connect [sic] case are specific to antitrust 'conspiracy' claims, which is not an antitrust claim applicable in 
the instant case."" Id. The Court first notes that this statement is inaccurate. In MVConnect, the defendants moved to dismiss 
several claims, including ""conspiracy to violate Section I of the Sherman Act (Count I), monopolization and attempted 
monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman [Act] (Counts II and III), [and] conspiracy to monopolize under Section 2 (Count 
IV)."" 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161409, 2011 WL 13128799, at *3. Though the Court repeatedly referenced the individual officers' 
alleged involvement in the ""conspiracy,"" its analysis ultimately led to the dismissal of several claims against the officers, 
including those claims for attempted monopolization. See 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161409, [WL] at *9-10. But regardless, the 
Chandler Plaintiffs provide no justification for divining a ""required test"" from decades-old Sixth Circuit and Northern District of 
California opinions. See Pls.' Resp. 15, ECF No. 26 (citing nonbinding cases from the 1970s and 80s). Accordingly, the Court 
finds the Fifth Circuit's opinions in In re Morrison, 555 F.3d 473 and Mozingo, 752 F.2d 168—as applied in MVConnect, 2011 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161409, 2011 WL 13128799—provide the most appropriate test for individual officer liability in the antitrust 
context."
1641,4," Notably, the Chandler Plaintiffs state that ""the CEO of Phoenix Services, Mark H. Fisher, also runs HOTF, and on information 
and belief is the sole employee of HOTF."" First Am. Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 23. ""Although there is no express authorization in the 
federal rules for pleading on information and belief, allegations in this form have been held to be permissible, even after the 
Twombly and Iqbal decisions."" Charles Alan Wright & Arthur Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1224 (2d ed. 1990) 
(emphasis added). In the Fifth Circuit, ""'information and belief' pleadings are generally deemed permissible . . . especially in 
cases in which the information is more accessible to the defendant."" Johnson v. Johnson, 385 F.3d 503, 531, n.19 (5th Cir. 
2004); see also Innova Hosp. San Antonio, Ltd. P'ship v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ga., Inc., 892 F.3d 719, 730 (5th Cir. 
2018) [hereinafter Innova] (""underscor[ing] the principle that when discoverable information is in the control and possession of a 
defendant, it is not necessarily the plaintiff's responsibility to provide that information in her complaint""). Since the Chandler Plaintiffs assert that Fisher runs HOTF and was responsible for maintaining the patent-infringement litigation, 
their factual allegation that Fisher is the sole employee of HOTF appears to be ""'based on factual information that makes the 
inference of culpability plausible.'"" Innova, 892 F.3d at 730 (quoting Arista Records, LLC v. Doe 3, 604 F.3d 110, 120 (2d Cir. 
2010) (citations omitted)). And while the Phoenix Plaintiffs may not have access to HOTF's employment data, surely Phoenix—
HOTF's parent company—and Fisher himself know whether HOTF had or has additional employees. Because the Phoenix 
Defendants do not raise this issue, the Court accepts this ""information and belief"" pleading as true at the 12(b)(6) stage. "
1647,1," The market power summary-judgment record includes Plaintiffs' Statement of Disputed Facts, which does not, contrary to 
Defendants' suggestion, deserve to be stricken under Local Rule 56. See D.R.I. LR Cv 56. The Court DENIES Defendants' 
motion, ECF No. 610. "
1648,2," In Coastal Fuels of Puerto Rico v. Caribbean Petroleum Corp., 79 F.3d 182, 196-99 (1st Cir. 1996) (Section 2), the First Circuit 
noted direct evidence included ""actual supracompetitive prices and restricted output."" Coastal Fuels, 79 F.3d at 196 (emphasis 
added). Economic theory holds that an increase in price restricts output, however, because of the consequent demand 
decrease. See, e.g., Sumanth Addanki Dep. 202:11-18, ECF No. 603-14. This is known in economics as the law of demand, id., 
and arguably obviates the need for Plaintiffs separately to prove output restriction where it has shown supracompetitive prices. 
The court in In re Solodyn (Minocycline Hydrochloride) Antitrust Litigation recently held, relying on Coastal Fuels, that 
pharmaceutical-purchaser plaintiffs needed evidence of both supracompetitive prices and restricted output to prove market 
power. No. 14-md-02503, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11921, 2018 WL 563144, at *12 (D. Mass. Jan. 25, 2018). In doing so, the 
court did not consider the economic principle that, all else equal, an increase in price restricts output due to the consequent 
demand decrease. The Solodyn court also was without the benefit of the Supreme Court's recent opinion in American Express. 
See Am. Express Co., 138 S.Ct. at 2284, quoted above."
1648,3," On this, both sides agree that a factfinder should consider both direct and indirect evidence together, recognizing that it is 
impermissible for the Court to require separate presentations of direct and indirect evidence of market power. See Defs.' Market 
Power Responses 11, ECF No. 1251 (""Defendants believe it would be, to say the least, highly inappropriate to limit the jury to 
purported 'direct' evidence in an 'initial[]' phase, having the jury reach a verdict on such evidence, and only then potentially hear 
traditional (i.e., 'indirect') evidence regarding competition and monopoly power."") (emphasis added); Pls.' Answers to the Court's 
Questions for Further Market Power Briefing 9, ECF No. 1252 (""If the Court denies Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, it 
should submit the issue of market power to the jury to be decided at the conclusion of the first phase of the trial based on 
whatever evidence the parties choose to submit to the jury on that issue. Market power and market definition constitute a single 
issue that may be addressed using direct or indirect evidence.""). "
1649,4," Defendants' plaint that brand manufacturers generally have higher fixed costs than generics, given the resources it takes to 
innovate and submit a successful NDA, is a red herring. See Kaplow, supra, at 499-500 (explaining that, fixed costs 
notwithstanding, ""clarity in analysis is best served by maintaining the traditional distinction between the definition and 
measurement of market power, on one hand, and the determinants of liability, on the other""). High brand margins indeed may be 
necessary to recoup costs sunk into research and development, but the antitrust laws are not concerned with why brands need 
these margins, but instead how they got and, more to the point, maintained them. See 4A Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert 
Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application ¶ 402b3 (4th ed. 2019) (""[T]he appropriate 
scope of protection to be given to innovation is primarily the concern of the intellectual property laws.""). For these reasons, and "
1650,," as foreshadowed by earlier colloquies with counsel, Defendants may not introduce evidence of sunk costs to disprove market 
power at trial."
1650,5," In connection with the present motion for summary judgment, Plaintiffs and Defendants have filed the following Daubert 
motions (in addition to those already decided): Defendants' Motion to Exclude Certain Opinions and Testimony of Edward Lentz, 
John Doll, and Nicholas Jewell, ECF No. 890; Defendants' Motion to Exclude Opinions and Testimony of Plaintiffs' Expert Dr. 
Thomas McGuire, ECF No. 882; Defendants' Motion to Exclude the Opinions and Testimony of John R. Tupman, ECF No. 892;

That Authorized Generics Were Facing Legal Uncertainty, ECF No. 901."
1651,6," Defendants' argument turns a blind eye to well-settled law that antitrust injury occurs when a purchase is made at an inflated 
price. Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 489, 88 S. Ct. 2224, 20 L. Ed. 2d 1231 (1968); see also In 
re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig., No. 13-2472-WES-PAS, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118308, 2019 WL 3214257, at *5 n.10 (D.R.I. 
July 2, 2019) (reasoning that purchasers are injured at the point they incur the overcharge); In re Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Antitrust 
Litig., No. 1:12-md-2343, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66707, 2014 WL 2002887, at *5 (E.D. Tenn. May 15, 2014) (""Hanover Shoe and 
Illinois Brick make clear that courts and juries will not be forced down the rabbit hole of hypothetical issues antitrust violators 
may raise to minimize their liability."")."
1651,7," Defendants' arguments on this claim partially mimic those argued at the motion-to-dismiss phase, now with the benefit of a 
more developed record. "
1652,8," ""But-for"" materiality is not required in cases of egregious misconduct, such as filing an unmistakably false affidavit. See 
Therasense, Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 649 F.3d 1276, 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Plaintiffs do not meaningfully argue that this 
standard applies here."
1652,9," While this standard applies to inequitable conduct claims, cases discussing intent for Walker Process fraud do not explicitly 
reference the ""single most reasonable inference"" standard. See Shuffle Tech Int'l LLC v. Sci. Games Corp., No. 15 C 3702, 2017 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141445, 2017 WL 3838096, at *11 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 1, 2017) (""Although the standards appear to be largely the 
same, cases discussing Walker Process fraud omit the requirement that fraudulent intent must be the 'single most reasonable 
inference' that can be drawn from the evidence.""). But see Inline Packaging, LLC v. Graphic Packaging Int'l, LLC, 351 F. Supp. 
3d 1187, 1203 (D. Minn. 2018) (applying ""single most reasonable inference"" standard in analyzing Walker [**27]  Process fraud). 
That said, Plaintiffs seem to accept the fact that the ""single most reasonable inference"" is the standard. Pls.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. 
for Summ. J. 9-10, ECF No. 978 (""The only inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that [Dr.] Hodgen intended to 
deceive the PTO . . . ."") (emphasis added). "
1653,10," Defendants also question Mr. Lentz's methodology. The Court is satisfied that Mr. Lentz connects his experience to his 
opinions. Nor does the Court find persuasive Defendants' argument that Mr. Lentz's opinion should be excluded for considering, 
or failing to consider, certain evidence. Defendants may address these concerns, if appropriate, on cross-examination."
1653,11," Defendants seek to exclude these experts' opinions as unreliable because they are self-contradictory and directly contradict 
relevant PTO regulations. If Mr. Lentz or Mr. Doll's opinions directly contradict PTO regulations, or otherwise misstate them, they 
will be excluded. But if these opinions set forth a reasonable interpretation of the regulations, Defendants' motion is DENIED."
1653,12," Defendants ask the Court to exclude Dr. Jewell's opinion as irrelevant to Plaintiffs' fraud theories because no evidence 
suggests that this re-analysis of data was performed during the patent prosecution and intentionally kept from the PTO. This is 
not a valid reason to exclude these opinions."
1653,13," Defendants submit that the Court should exclude ""any purported identification of facts in support of opinions[.]"" Sept. 12, 2019 
Hr'g Tr. 35. Plaintiffs suggest that Mr. Lentz should be allowed to identify facts from which an inference of intent can be drawn, 
but Defendants argue that all Mr. Lentz relies on are privilege log entries, handwritten notes, and documents outside the 
prosecution history. The Court will not exclude Mr. Lentz's opinion testimony on this basis. "
1654,14," And, considering the applicable time restrictions, the Court is confident that neither side will be incentivized to do so."
1654,15," Overarchingly, Defendants consider telling the decision of some of the generic manufacturers to not raise an inequitable 
conduct defense in the underlying patent infringement suits, claiming it undercuts Plaintiffs' present Walker Process fraud claim. 
Two of the generic firms (Lupin and Mylan) did not bring inequitable conduct claims post-Star Scientific and post-Therasense, 
respectively; Watson did assert an inequitable conduct claim. While these generic challengers' decision not to assert this 
defense is perhaps relevant, it is not dispositive. As with any claim, a party might refrain from asserting a defense for any 
number of reasons. See generally Gideon Mark & T. Leigh Anenson, Inequitable Conduct and Walker Process Claims After 
Therasense and the America Invents Act, 16 U. Pa. J. Bus. L. 361, 370 (2014) (recognizing that ""the defense has an army of 
critics"")."
1654,16," The parties dispute when the patent assignment from Dr. Hodgen to Warner Lambert occurred; Plaintiffs say in 1994, and 
Defendants say in 1996. PSOF ¶ 39. The Court makes all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs' favor. "
1656,17," Through a recently filed motion in limine, see ECF No. 1300, Plaintiffs seek to prevent Warner Chilcott from arguing that 
Warner Chilcott executives were not involved in the '394 patent prosecution or assignment because, Plaintiffs say, Defendants 
obscured relevant and discoverable evidence. The Court referred this motion to Magistrate Judge Sullivan, and Judge Sullivan 
denied it."
1656,18," On this point (and others) Defendants challenge Plaintiffs' reliance on a privilege log, seeking to prevent Plaintiffs' use of the 
log as evidence. The Court referred the related motion in limine to Magistrate Judge Sullivan, and Judge Sullivan granted it in 
part and denied it in part. Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs rely on the privilege log as evidence to oppose this motion, the 
Court does not consider it, and Plaintiffs may not present such evidence to the jury except as directed in that order. "
1657,19," This evidence includes that the Study was four months long, had a small sample size, involved a controlled experiment, and 
that the protocol and final report were submitted to a board with strict confidentiality and record-keeping rules. See Barry v. 
Medtronic, Inc., 914 F.3d 1310, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (analyzing similar factors in evaluating experimental use). "
1659,20," Plaintiffs' expert Mr. Lentz explains that there was no realistic chance for Warner Chilcott to succeed on the patent claims — 
having a 10% or less chance of succeeding, and only that high to account for potential judicial error. Defendants use this opinion 
to say that Plaintiffs' own expert accounts for a 10% chance of success for Warner Chilcott, which is all that is needed to defeat 
a sham litigation claim. But Mr. Lentz said his opinion ""ought not be misconstrued to suggest that, given the actual facts and a 
proper application of the law, Warner Chilcott had a 10% chance of winning."" Expert Report of Edward T. Lentz 82 n.269, ECF 
No. 891-3. Only a ""reasonable"" litigant's ""realistic"" expectations are relevant. PRE, 508 U.S. at 60-61. "
1660,21, The parties agree that all arguments related to Lupin are now moot in light of the settlement with Lupin. 
1661,22," The parties agree that this motion is moot as related to Drs. Meyer's and Robbins's opinions about any agreement between 
Warner Chilcott and Lupin. "
1662,23," The Retailers allege a more limited market, including only Loestrin and its generic equivalent. "
1663,24," The parties agree that this motion is moot as it relates to Dr. Berneman's opinions about any agreement between Warner 
Chilcott and Lupin. "
1664,25," Plaintiffs' Motion to Exclude in Part the Expert Opinions of Christine Meyer, Ph.D. and Philip Green That Authorized Generics 
Were Facing Legal Uncertainty, ECF No. 901, is DENIED. The opinions are relevant because they deal with a potential risk 
factor pertinent to determining value. The criticisms can be effectively addressed on cross-examination."
1664,26," The Retailers' expert, Dr. Leffler, values Warner Chilcott's sacrifice at $21.9 million. PSOF 1 99. "
1668,27," Despite citing multiple grounds to justify his exclusion, Defendants actually never moved to exclude Dr. Leffler's opinions. To 
the extent their argument may be read as a motion, it is denied."
1668,28," ""In the context of patent litigation, a launch is said to be 'at-risk' if it takes place before the questions of infringement and 
validity are resolved, either through litigation or a license."" Wellbutrin XL II, 868 F.3d at 168 n.59. "
1671,29," Since the filing of this motion, Plaintiffs effectively dismantled this Daubert motion and refiled it in the form of a string of 
motions in limine. Plaintiffs never withdrew this motion, so the Court rules on it now consistent with its already-issued rulings on 
the motions in limine, if only to provide more detail."
1671,30," Plaintiffs claim these experts, in relying on Doryx, effectively ignore this Court's ruling on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. But 
the Court neither adopted Namenda over Doryx, nor considers these cases legally irreconcilable."
1671,31," The DPPs and the EPPs allege the relevant market consists of Loestrin, Minastrin, and their generic equivalents; the Retailers 
allege the relevant market consists of only Loestrin and its generic equivalents."
1671,32," Plaintiffs also argue that Dr. Meyer's opinion rests on an unreliable methodology because her conclusion relies only on the fact 
that generic Loestrin products eventually entered the market. The Court has already held that total foreclosure from the market is 
not required for a finding of anticompetitive conduct. Loestrin II, 261 F. Supp. 3d at 351; see also Abbott Labs. v. Teva Pharms. 
USA, Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 408, 423 (D. Del. 2006). To the extent that Dr. Meyer opines that Warner Chilcott's conduct was not 
anticompetitive absent total foreclosure, her opinion is excluded as contrary to law. Relevantly, Plaintiffs argue that Drs. Meyer 
and Schilling ignore the circumstances of the pharmaceutical industry, instead analogizing the facts here to that in other 
industries. This challenge may be addressed on cross-examination. "
1673,33," Defendants further distinguish Namenda to say that the coercion finding there depended, in large part, on the stipulated 
single-drug market definition, and the fact that undisputed evidence showed that no substitute existed outside the branded and 
generic drug. Namenda II, 787 F.3d at 654 n.27. Plaintiffs here also argue that the relevant market is a single-drug market. As 
noted above, Plaintiffs' case will rise or fall on the jury's finding as to the relevant market. If the jury agrees with Plaintiffs that it is 
a single-molecule market, then it will decide this question, and if not, it won't."
1673,34," Plaintiffs cite their expert Dr. Thomas's testimony that patients rarely expressed a problem with swallowing pills. PSOF 1 179. 
Defendants' Motion to Exclude Certain Opinions and Testimony of Michael Thomas, M.D., on Chewability and Patent Issues, 
ECF No. 886, is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; it is GRANTED to the extent that he opines on behalf of all 
physicians; Dr. Thomas's testimony must be limited to his own experience. The motion is otherwise DENIED."
1673,35," Alternatively, Defendants ask the Court to grant summary judgment on all Plaintiffs' damages claims for purchases of brand or 
generic Minastrin in or after January 2014 because generic versions of Loestrin were then available to consumers and Plaintiffs 
have no means to identify ""coerced"" patients. They say the jury could not ""make a 'just and reasonable' estimate of damages 
based on Minastrin purchases"", where Plaintiffs have not submitted expert testimony or other evidence ""showing which (or how 
many) patients who took Minastrin before generic Loestrin 24 was available . . . did so because of 'coercion.'"" Defs.' Mot. Summ. 
J. 61-62. In certifying the classes, the Court analyzed and approved the competing damages models, concluding that any challenges of 
the same could be addressed on cross-examination. None of Defendants' arguments compels revisiting that conclusion now. "
1674,36, Plaintiffs ask this Court to consider Defendants' arguments pertaining to the state law claims waived. It declines to do so.
1674,37," Defendants also argue the EPPs' state law claims fail for the reasons outlined in their Renewed Motion to Dismiss and Motion 
for Judgment on the Pleadings, ECF No. 576. This motion has been resolved, and Defendants' argument is therefore moot. "
1693,1," By the time the Motion for Class Certification was filed, UPMC had settled with Plaintiff. Plaintiff and UPMC reached a 
settlement agreement, which the Court approved in July 2016. (ECF Nos. 414, 415). UPMC was then dismissed from the action. 
(Id.) Inasmuch as UPMC documents are included in the record before the Court on the class certification motion, UPMC has 
requested the sealing, in whole or part, of certain of its documents. It also seeks to seal other documents from Highmark's files 
that contain information about Highmark-UPMC transactions that UPMC does not want to disclose to other competitors."
1693,2," Members of the press attended at least one day of the class certification hearings (see, e.g., Matthew Santoni, Insurer Says 
Hotel Can't Prove Alleged Conspiracy's Impact, Law360 (Sept. 19, 2018, https://www.law360.com/articles/1084270/insurer-says-
hotel-can-t-prove-alleged-conspiracy-s-impact). Part of that proceeding was conducted in a sealed courtroom. "
1694,3," The materials Highmark sought to be sealed make up eleven binders: • three binders of exhibits submitted with the class certification briefs filed between March and August 2018; • one binder of previously sealed exhibits submitted by Highmark; • one revised binder for Pl. Exs. 14 and 28; • two binders containing the transcripts of the hearings on Sept. 19 and Nov. 9, 2019 on class certification, materials 
submitted to the Court during those hearings, and the supplemental expert reports of the parties experts; • one binder of the transcript of Nov. 20, 2018, hearing; • one binder of briefs filed between March and August 2018; • one binder of excerpts of Pl. Ex. 29; and [*16] • one binder of materials related to the Daubert portion of the class certification process, including the report of the Court-
appointed Technical Advisor, the parties responses to that reports, the parties' Daubert briefs, the transcript of the May 15, 
2019, Daubert hearing and the materials presented to the Court during those hearings. The materials UPMC sought to seal comprised approximately 200 pages, and included exhibits submitted by the parties, briefs, 
and portions of hearing transcripts."
1694,4," In describing Plaintiff's allegations here the Special Master draws from and quotes Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint (ECF 
No. 286). The description of Plaintiff's allegations here does not represent any finding by the Special Master. "
1695,5," Expert Report of Robin Cantor, Ph.D. (Mar. 13, 2018)(ECF No. 527-1 and ECF No. 548-6)."
1695,6," Rebuttal Expert Report of Robin Cantor, Ph.D. (June 11, 2018) (ECF No. 527-42)."
1695,7," Expert Report of Dr. John H. Johnson, IV (May 17, 2018) (ECF No. 548-1). "
1696,8," ""The expert report and deposition testimony of Plaintiff's expert (Pl. Ex. 1; Def. Exs. 3, 6) also grossly misstate the confidential 
process by which HHIC set small group health plan premiums . . . ."" (Highmark June 1, 2018, Ltr. Br. n.3)."
1696,9," The Special Master notes these arguments to provide factual context for recommendations concerning sealing. The Special 
Master takes no position on the merits of the parties' arguments concerning class certification."
1696,10," Pursuant to Order for Presentation of Concurrent Expert Evidence, filed July 25, 2018 (ECF 567), the experts of each party 
were sworn in and placed in the jury box, side by side—the ""hot tub."" Each expert gave opening statements of their opinions, 
and then were invited to ask ""each other questions and engage in a discussion with respect to the matters of disagreement"" 
(ECF 567 ¶ 4). Thereafter counsel cross examined the experts and the experts made closing statements."
1696,11," Highmark's counsel argued that Mr. Cashion should be allowed to testify as a fact witness, because: Dr. Cantor has not identified a reliable method capable of common proof to show that that alleged increase in healthcare 
costs automatically increased base rates and an increase in base rates automatically increased premiums. She has no 
method to show that. That is because she used, instead of making up her own method, she used Highmark's own 
methodology for setting rates. That's why we brought Mr. Cashion to testify, because he's in charge of this. He is the chief 
actuary for Highmark."" (Sept. 19, 2018, Tr. 69:6-15). Thereafter, the Court directed Plaintiffs be allowed to depose Mr. Cashion again before he testified 
in Court on November 19, 2018, (id. at 182:21-183:6), and directed the experts to file supplemental reports after Mr. Cashion's 
deposition and in-court testimony. (Id. 183:8-189:8),"
1696,12," See Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). "
1697,13," Rule 5.2.H of the Local Rules of the Western District provides: Leave of Court Required to File Under Seal. A party wishing to file any document under seal must obtain prior leave of 
Court for each document that is requested to be filed under seal. A party must file a motion seeking leave to file such 
documents under seal. Only after obtaining an order of Court granting such a motion will a party be permitted to file a 
document under seal."
1697,14," The Stipulated Protective Order (ECF No. 76) was a broad protective order, under which the parties could unilaterally 
designate as ""Highly Confidential—Outside Counsel/Experts Only"" materials the designating party ""reasonably and in good faith 
believes"" are ""highly sensitive confidential or proprietary information"" and which, if disclosed, would ""have a substantial 
likelihood of compromising or jeopardizing that Party's business interests . . .."" [Id. at (C)(1)]. Notably, the parties were not 
required to challenge the propriety of the designations at the time the designation were made. [Id. at (C)(7)]. "
1698,15," In 2013, Allegheny Health Network became the sole member of West Penn Allegheny Health System, Inc. (See Fitzpatrick 
Aug. 21, 2018, Decl. at ¶ 18, and Aug. 8, 2018, Ltr. from Ms. Bauer to the Special Master at 1)."
1698,16," Allegheny Health Network did not provide any evidence or declarations to support of the factual statements in the letters 
written by its General Counsel. [Cf. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd., 529 F. Supp. 866, 891 (E.D. Pa. 
1981)(Becker, J.) (""the specific instances where disclosure will inflict a competitive disadvantage should be set forth in more than 
the briefs or the hearsay allegations of counsel's affidavit, for a protective order should not issue on that basis alone"")]. If the 
absence of such support would be fatal to issuance of a Rule 26(c) protective order, the absence here with a much higher 
burden upon the movant is critical. The Special Master called these omissions to the attention of AHN by email dated Sept. 17, 
2018. "
1699,17," Highmark Health is the parent corporation of Allegheny Health Network and Highmark, Inc. (See Fitzpatrick Aug. 21, 2018, 
Decl. at ¶ 18, and Aug. 8, 2018, Ltr., Ms. Bauer to the Special Master at 1)."
1699,18," The reasoning underlying this conclusion by PID and the Special Master's recommendation is discussed in detail infra Section 
IV.H at 76."
1699,19," The reports filed as part of the Daubert portion of the class certification process include: • Plaintiff's Response to the Technical Advisor Report (ECF 647/649/653); • Dr. Cantor's Response to Technical Advisor Report (ECF 647/649/653, Attachment 1); • Highmark's Response to the Technical Advisor Report (ECF 646/648); • Technical Advisor's Response to Dr. Cantor's April 4, 2019, Response Report (ECF 688). "
1700,20," Although Highmark, at the Special Master's invitation, revised its sealing chart as to the class certification briefs filed March-
July 2018, it did not revise its ""Daubert Sealing Table"" submitted July 9, 2018. (See Email, Sept. 17, 2019, Highmark to Special 
Master, and Email, Sept. 18, 2019, Highmark to Special Master )."
1700,21," UPMC does not seek to seal any portion of the slides used by Highmark at the Daubert hearing. (See Ltr. June 26, 2019, 
UPMC to Special Master, at 5; see also Ltr. July 9, 2019, UPMC to Special Master at n. 1)."
1700,22," UPMC states that ""Highmark has provided UPMC copies of the Technical Advisor's Report and subsequent responses thereto 
for out-side-counsel review . . . [and] [t]hese copies, like prior materials provided to UPMC contain some redactions."" (Ltr. June 
26, 2019, UPMC to Special Master at 1). Highmark represented to UPMC these documents were the only ones that ""could 
possibly pertain to UPMC or contain UPMC confidential information."" (Id.). "
1702,23," See Avandia, 924 F.3d 662, 2019 WL 2119630 at *3 [discussing the standard for discovery protective orders entered pursuant 
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)]. "
1703,24," In addition, the Supreme Court has found ""[e]very violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system 
envisaged by Congress,"" and thus Congress offered ""potential litigants the prospect of a recovery in three times the amount of 
their damages . . . [to] encourage[] these persons to serve as 'private attorneys general.'"" (Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 
405 U.S. at 262). The Supreme Court has also observed that antitrust law encourages plaintiff's suits ""to further the overriding 
public policy in favor of competition."" (Perma Life Mufflers, 392 U.S. at 139)."
1703,25," The Third Circuit has recognized a number of other types of lawsuits that concern issues and remedies affecting the public. 
[See, e.g., Publicker, 733 F.2d at 1074 (weighing ""the policy interest in protecting unsuspecting people from investing in "
1704,," Publicker in light of its bad business practices""); Republic of the Philippines v. Westinghouse Elec., Corp., 949 F.2d 653, 664 (3d 
Cir. 1991) (""the allegation of bribes by a major United States corporation to the leader of a foreign country is a matter of public 
interest, which could give rise to public debate""); Mine Safety Appliances Co. v. North River Ins. Co., 73 F. Supp. 3d 544, 567 
(W.D. PA 2014) (insurance coverage action for bodily injury claims under standard-form liability insurance policy ""has the 
potential to affect the rights and remedies of other carriers, insureds, and third-party claimants""); see also Brown & Williamson 
Tobacco Corp. v. F.T.C., 710 F.2d 1165, 1180-81 (6th Cir. 1983) (citizens ""have an interest in knowing the accurate ""tar"" and 
nicotine content of the various brands of cigarettes on the market"" and ""how the government agency has responded to 
allegations of error in the testing program"")]."
1704,26," In Avandia the Third Circuit stated that ""[t]o be clear, we do not require a district court to provide lengthy, detailed discussion of 
each individual document. Yet it must be clear from the record that the district court engaged in a particularized, deliberate 
assessment of the standard as it applies to each disputed document."" (Avandia, 924 F.3d 662, 2019 WL 2119630 at *8 n. 11). "
1706,27," Cf. Agency Solutions.Com, LLC v. TriZetto Grp., Inc., 819 F. Supp. 2d 1001, 1017 (E.D. Cal. 2011)( party seeking injunctive 
relief under California Uniform Trade Secrets Act action must describe the subject matter of the trade secret with sufficient 
particularity to permit the defendant and the court to ascertain the boundaries of the secret); M. Lemley, The Surprising Virtues 
of Treating Trade Secrets as IP Rights, 61 Stan. L. Rev. 311, 344 (2008) (plaintiff should be required to ""clearly define what it 
claims to own, rather than (as happens all too often in practice) falling back on vague hand waiving"")]."
1706,28," In response to the Special Master's request for clarification of its position on the applicable legal standard (see Email, May 20, 
2019, Special Master to Highmark), Highmark stated that ""the Cendant common law standard applies"" and went on to specify 
that ""Highmark has the burden of showing that 'the materials is the kind of information that courts will protect' and that 'disclosure 
will work a clearly defined and serious injury to the party seeking closure."" [Ltr. May 21, 2019, Highmark to the Special Master at 
3 (quoting Cendant, 260 F.3d at 194)]. "
1708,29," See also Littlejohn, 851 F.2d at 680 n. 15 (rejecting BIC's contention that the court must ""hold that a stipulated protective order 
gave BIC the unilateral power to designate which of its documents would become a part of the public record, even when 
admitted into evidence at trial, absent a showing of compelling need by some member of the public.""). "
1709,30," That no third party has yet sought to intervene in this process to argue for public access does not mean such a motion will not 
be filed at a later date. [See, e.g., Leucadia, Inc. v. Applies Extrusion Technologies, Inc., 998 F.2d 157, 161, n. 5 (3d Cir. 
1993)(permitting a motion to intervene in a settled case to challenge sealing of documents ""even after the underlying dispute 
between the parties has long been settled"" citing United Nuclear Corp. v. Cranford Ins. Co., 905 F.2d 1424, 1427 (10th Cir.1990) 
(""permitting intervention three years after underlying action had settled and noting that ""courts have widely recognized that the 
correct procedure for a third-party to challenge a protective order is through intervention for that purpose""); Beckman Industries, 
Inc. v. International Ins. Co., 966 F.2d 470, 471-73 (9th Cir. 1992) (""same, for intervention motion filed two years after case was 
settled and dismissed"")]."
1709,31," Although the Third Circuit was dealing with the common law right to access in Cendant, this posture does not alter the fact that 
""public access is particularly compelling"" in class action suits. (260 F.3d at 193)."
1709,32," This reference to Shane is recognition of a possibility in the general nature of class action suits and should not be read as any 
reflection on the conduct of Plaintiff's counsel in this lawsuit. "
1710,33," The exhibits at issue are: Pl. Exs. 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 17, 28, 29, 44, 45, and 47. The Special Master addresses Pl. Exs. 17 and 
29 separately infra Section IV.H at 76."
1710,34," See Argo v. Makhteshim Agan of N. Am., 2011 WL 13157168 at *4 (M.D.N.C. 2011) and Good v. American Water Works Co., 
Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42193, 2016 WL 1261140 at * 3 (S.D.W. Va. 2016)(involving a motion to dismiss). In contrast to a 
motion to dismiss, a motion for class certification may be resolved with reference to materials outside the four corners of the 
complaint. "
1711,35," The Special Master also does not find in the other two cases cited by UPMC to provide a principled reason to adopt UPMC's 
""irrelevancy"" argument. UPMC cites Saint Alphonsus Medical Center-Nampa, Inc. v. St. Luke's Health System, Ltd., 2015 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 18932, 2015 WL 632311 at * 2-3 (D. Idaho 2015), where the court expressly found in the first instance that the 
documents should be sealed because they contained trade secrets while other documents revealed individual doctor's 
compensation and productivity. The court stated secondarily—and arguably superfluously—that these documents ""played no 
role in the Court's decision and do[] not help the public understand the Court's decision."" UPMC also cites In re General Motors 
LLC Ignition Switch Litigation, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97308, 2015 WL 4522778 (S.D.NY. 2015), in which the court concluded ""all 
the exhibits submitted under seal were ... seemingly intended to condemn the conduct of New GM rather than to illuminate the 
legal and factual bases behind ... [the] opposition to New GM's motion"" for a protective order to enjoin Plaintiffs' counsel from 
releasing these materials to the press."
1711,36," The practical effect of UPMC's argument is that the sealing decision would be delayed until the court has ruled on the 
substantive motion. To delay a sealing decision until after an adjudication on the merits would hide the documents from public 
view, which could compromise the ability of the public to monitor and participate in the proceeding. This delay could be of 
particular concern in class actions where unnamed members of the class are numerous. HN28[
] Contemporaneous access is an integral part of public access. [See, e.g., Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 555, 592, 100 S. Ct. 2814, 65 L. Ed. 2d 973 
(Brennan, J., concurring) (""'contemporaneous review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of 
judicial power'"")]. When contemporaneous access is not possible, the Third Circuit expects sealing decisions to be made as 
expeditiously as possible. [See, e.g., Publicker, 733 F.2d at 1072 (""a district court in deciding whether to conduct a proceeding in 
camera must not relax the standard necessary to close a proceeding simply because a transcript of that closed proceeding can 
be made available at a later date."")]. "
1712,37," Plaintiff Exhibit 37, and Defendant Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and 10 are either the ""Base Rates Model"" or the ""Cashion Spreadsheet."" 
Mr. Cashion testified to these exhibits both in depositions (see Def. Exs. 5 and 12), and during the class certification hearing. 
(See Nov. 9, 2018, Tr. ). In addition, both Plaintiff's and Defendant's expert reports, depositions, and testimony at the hearings 
refer extensively to the ""Base Rates Model"" and the ""Cashion Spreadsheet."" (See Pl. Exs. 1, 39-40, 42-44; Cantor Nov. 14, 
2018, Supplemental Expert Report; Def. Exs. 1, 3-5, 11, 12, many portions of the hearing transcripts for Sept. 19 and Nov. 20, 
2018, and some portions of the slides submitted to the Court during those hearings)."
1712,38," Mr. Cashion was the Chief Actuary of Highmark, Inc. from April 2002 through December 2013, and since then he has been the 
Chief Actuary of Highmark Health. (See Cashion Aug. 23, 2018, Decl. ¶ 1). Mr. Cashion testified that, during the Class Period, 
he was ""responsible for the actuarial functions"" of Highmark Health Insurance Company (HHIC), a wholly owned subsidiary of 
defendant Highmark, Inc. (See Nov. 9, 2018, Tr. at 9-19; 3d Amended Complaint at ¶ 11)."
1712,39," The Special Master addresses Highmark's arguments to seal negotiated reimbursement rates separately infra at Section 
IV.C(3) at 45. "
1714,40," Pl. Ex. 28 is a contract between Highmark and UPMC's Presbyterian Hospital, dated June 28, 2002. Pl. Ex. 48 is a contract 
between Highmark and The Western Pennsylvania Hospital, dated May 23, 2008."
1714,41," Although Highmark originally sought to seal Plaintiff's Exhibits 28 and 47 in their entirety, it reconsidered that request and 
""decided to request only certain limited portions of these two documents remain confidential,"" i.e., ""certain commercially 
sensitive contract terms"" and ""specific financial terms."" (Fitzpatrick Third Supp. Decl., Feb 22, 2019, ¶¶ 3-4). "
1716,42," The Special Master accepts UPMC's explanation as accurate for the healthcare insurance industry in Western Pennsylvania, 
even though Highmark did not provide this level of detail in its briefs or declarations."
1716,43," The central document is Plaintiff Exhibit. 14, ""Term Sheet for Contract Terms Between Highmark, Inc. and UPMC Health 
System,"" signed by the parties and bearing a date of June 25, 2002. In addition, Plaintiff submitted other documents leading up to the executed agreement. [See Pl. Ex. 5 (Email, Feb. 15, 2002, 
Highmark ""Summary of Meeting with UPMC;"" Pl. Ex. 6 (UPMC Presentation Slides, ""UPMC-Highmark Contract Summary: 
Provisions Agreed to 5-23-02 between J. Paul & K. Melani""); Pl. Ex. 7 (Highmark, Presentation to Executive Committee, ""UPMC 
Health System Provider Agreement: Summary, June 26, 2002"")]. Plaintiff also submitted historic business documents about issues with the 2002, 10-year Agreement after its inception, (see, 
e.g., Pl. Ex. 21, 25, and 26), portions of deposition transcripts of UPMC and Highmark personnel discussing the 2002, 10-year 
Agreement (see Pl. Exs. 2, 3, 47), and reports of Plaintiff expert for class certification. (See Pl. Exs. 1, 42, and unnumbered 
Suppl. Expert Report of Dr. Cantor). "
1717,44," The Special Master also asked the requesting parties to clarify an apparent discrepancy between their declarants as to 
whether ""portions of the 2002 Term Sheet (Pl. Ex. 14) are still in effect today."" (Id.). "
1718,45," UPMC replied that the 2002 Term Sheet (Pl. Ex. 14) ... and the resulting 2002 Hospital Contracts (e.g., Pl. Ex. 28) would be 
""properly characterized as a 'one-of-a-kind agreement.'"" (Ltr. Feb. 20, 2019 UPMC to Special Master at 3)."
1718,46, The narrowing of sealing requests does not constitute an answer to the question posed.
1718,47," Highmark and UPMC explain that, although the contracts with individual hospitals were to have ended in 2012, several of 
those contracts have been extended. These extensions occurred pursuant to reciprocal consent decrees (approved by court on 
July 1, 2014), and the Mediated Agreements, the first signed on May 1, 2012 and the second on Dec. 20, 2017. The requesting 
parties have clarified that none of the individual hospital contracts are exhibits to the present class certification proceedings. 
(See Ltr. Feb. 20, 2019, UPMC to Special Master; and see Email, Feb. 22, 2019, Highmark to the Special Master, attaching a 
revised sealing chart and Fitzpatrick, Feb. 22, 2019, 3d Suppl. Decl.)."
1718,48," Highmark specifies: Pl. Exs. 1-2, 4-7, 14, 20, 25-26, 29, 31, 35, 38, 42, 45; Def. Exs. 1 and 6. Highmark's list is longer than 
those the Special Master considers here in section IV.D. In this Supplement, the Special Master discusses documents that relate 
only to the 2002 Master Agreement. "
1719,49," Parsing the declaration of Mr. Farner, he asserts that the exhibits ""[g]enerally. . . contain the work product and the results of 
strategic planning"" are: Pl. Exs. 3, 6, 12, 14, and 21. [See Farner Aug. 21, 2018, 2d Suppl. Decl. ¶40 (identifying the exhibits in 
Exhibit C-3 of UPMC's Letter Brief of Aug. 31, 2018, to be the exhibits at issue)]. UPMC also states that Pl. Exs. 3, 5, and 6 are 
discussed during the Sept. 19 hearing and appear in slides introduced by Plaintiff and Highmark at that hearing. (See Ltr. Br. 
Dec. 7, 2018, UPMC to the Special Master at 1-2)."
1719,50," Compare Pl. Exs. 5, 6, 7, 14, and 21, which contain business documents (emails, two PowerPoints, and one Term Sheet) 
dating from the early 2000s, with Pl. Exs. 25 (specifically ""Highmark Board Updates"" (HMKCW00032998-3021)), 26, and 45, all 
exhibits which the Special Master recommended sealing to protect Highmark strategies. (See, e.g., infra at 144 (recommend 
sealing Pl. Ex. 25, ""Highmark Board Updates"" because the Special Master concluded ""that Highmark's interest in maintaining 
the confidentiality of its strategic and tactical plans with its Board overrides the public interest""; infra at 147 (recommend sealing

projects in Pl. Ex. 26 are extensive and detailed . . .""); and infra at 182 (recommend sealing Pl. Ex. 45 in its entirety agreeing 
with Highmark that the document ""discusses at length Highmark's interpretation of the competitive landscape, its strategy for the 
future, its financial performance along key metrics, and market share""). "
1720,51," Highmark and UPMC explain that, although the contracts with individual hospitals were to have ended in 2012, several of 
those contracts have been extended. These extensions occurred pursuant to reciprocal consent decrees (approved by court on 
July 1, 2014), and the Mediated Agreements, the first signed on May 1, 2012 and the second on Dec. 20, 2017. The requesting 
parties have clarified that none of the individual hospital contracts are exhibits to the present class certification proceedings.

2019)."
1723,57," UPMC cites Pl. Ex. 14 as another example. It argues that, if the Term Sheet, which UPMC states is a draft, is released, 
competitors could compare Pl. Ex. 14 with ""final details later made publicly available"" and ""piece together how these terms were 
internally considered and valued strategically by UPMC, which in turn shows others who will negotiate with UPMC in the future 
how UPMC analyzes such a deal."" (Id. at 2-3)."
1723,58," The Special Master understands UPMC's response to be a reiteration of its argument in its May and June 2018 letter briefs 
that these documents reveal UPMC's ""historic negotiating strategies,"" which argument the Special Master found above failed to 
satisfy UPMC's burden. "
1724,59," (See Fitzpatrick May 30, 2018, Decl. at ¶¶ 5-6). Plaintiff alleges Highmark discontinued this product in 2004 as part of the anti-
trust conspiracy with UPMC. (See supra at 5, quoting Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint at ¶ 22). "
1725,60," Highmark seeks to bolster its ""confusion argument"" by noting a trial court grant of an injunction in a case where the court 
found, in part, that ""selective and out-of-context disclosure may lead to confusion in the patient community and undeserved 
reputational harm."" [In re Zyprexa Injunction, 474 F. Supp. 2d 385, 425 (E.D.N.Y. 2007)]. Zyprexa concerned a breach of a 
discovery protective order by a lawyer in the case, who provided discovery documents from Eli Lilly to the New York Times for 
publication. The issue before the court in Zyprexa was whether to issue an injunction to prohibit public dissemination of the ill-
gotten Lilly documents Although Highmark signals this case as analogous, using a ""cf."" cite, the Special Master does not find 
this case helpful. The reasons for sealing laid out in Publicker, do not include protecting the public from possible confusion. In 
addition, the Special Master notes that on appeal, the Second Circuit found irreparable harm in the disclosure of Eli Lilly's trade 
secret—it did not mention the trial court's dicta about public confusion. [Eli Lilly & Co. v. Gottstein, 617 F.3d 186, 196 (2d Cir. 
2010)]."
1725,61," Highmark makes this ""false information"" argument in connection with Pl. Ex. 1; Pl. Ex. 42; Pl. Ex. 44; Def. Ex. 1; Def. Ex. 3; 
Def. Ex. 6 (same as Pl. Ex. 1), Dr. Cantor's Supplemental Expert Report (ECF No. 591), as well as Plaintiff's briefs filed in 
support of Class Certification (ECF Nos. 526, 556, 575). Highmark makes this argument in throughout its sealing requests for Dr. "
1726,," Cantor's three reports, her deposition testimony and testimony before the Court. Highmark also argues to seal some portions of 
Dr. Johnson's reports and testimony where he ""corrects"" Dr. Cantor."
1726,62," In the July 12 Declaration Mr. Cashion made identical statements with respect to Dr. Cantor's Rebuttal Report (Pl. Ex. 42), and 
her deposition transcript (Pl. Ex. 44 and Def. Ex. 3). [¶¶ 7(e) and (f)]."
1726,63," At times Highmark identifies a different injury due to disclosure of Dr. Cantor's so-called ""false statements"" about Highmark's 
premium-setting process; to wit, Mr. Cashion declares in reference to certain portions of Dr. Cantor's reports or testimony that, 
""although Dr. Cantor often misinterprets how the base rates model and premium-setting process works, the discussion has 
enough detail that it would be commercially detrimental if the information were disclosed."" [(Cashion July 12, 2018, Decl. ¶7(d)]. 
This argument for sealing is plausible on its face. Thus where Highmark makes this argument, the Special Master will assess in 
the context of a document by document review whether Dr. Cantor's statements, if made public, could reveal confidential 
commercial information of Highmark. (See Section V. infra at 87-353). "
1727,64," The class certification exhibits that Highmark states were subject to previous sealing decisions by the Court are: Pl. Ex. 35, Pl. 
Ex. 39, Def. Ex. 8, also Pl. Ex. 1 at 57 (""on page 57 this section contains a screenshot of a document that Judge Conti has 
already sealed in this case in connection with briefing for summary judgment"") and Def. Ex. 4 (Highmark's Responses to 
Plaintiff's Second Set of Interrogatories—Class Certification). "
1728,65," Highmark makes a related argument throughout its Sealing Chart, that either the Court or the Special Master have previously 
sealed similar documents. [See, e.g., Highmark Sealing Chart at 42 in support of sealing Pl. Ex. 4 states: ""R&R #2 at 52 
(recommending sealing competitive strategy documents.)""]. On the basis of the record currently before the Special Master, the 
Special Master is unable to verify these allegations as to any similarity of the documents considered in R&R #2. Thus, the 
Special Master is not willing to rely on earlier findings as to unspecified documents as binding here. [See Avandia, 924 F.3d 662, 
2019 WL 2119630 at n. 12 (requests for sealing cannot be supported by an 8-year-old declaration about ""the same type of 
documents,"" when the court has ""no way to verify that assertion"")]. In any event, the true inquiry is whether documents qualify for 
sealing at this time, not based on a record of several years ago."
1728,66," Pl. Ex. 17 is a report titled ""Economic Analysis of Highmark's Affiliation with WPAHS and Implementation of an Integrated 
Delivery System,"" which was prepared by Compass Lexecon, dated April 24, 2013 (the ""Compass Lexecon Report"")."
1728,67," Pl. Ex. 29 contains what appears to be multiple reports. The first is ""Amended April Report of Barry C. Harris, Economists 
Incorporated, Oct. 15, 2012,""(HMK CW 0002373-2533) submitted to PID to address ""questions and issues identified in the PID 
Information Requests."" (See HMK CW 00002376). Pl. Ex. 29 also contains supplements to the ""Amended April Report,"" all dated 
Oct. 15, 2012, including: ""Amended Supplement 3 to Amended April Report"" (HMK CW 00002534-2552); ""Amended 
Supplement 4 to Amended April Report"" (HMK CW 00002553-2580); ""Amended Supplement 5 to Amended April Report"" (HMK 
CW 00002581-2597); and ""Supplement 6 to Amended April Report"" (HMK CW 00002598-2646). Each of these supplements are 
individually paginated."
1728,68," These reports were prepared ""in connection with a lengthy regulatory review [by the PID] of the then-proposed affiliation 
between Highmark and WPAHS."" (Cashion Dec. 6, 2018, Decl. at ¶ 5). Compass Lexecon served as the economics expert of 
the PID, while Dr. Harris was retained by Highmark. The PID published a redacted version of the Compass Lexecon Report on 
the PID website; the PID maintains the entire Harris Report as confidential. Ultimately, the PID approved the Highmark/WPAHS 
affiliation in April 2013 (see, e.g., Feb. 8, 2019, Ltr. PID to the Special Master at 2), which resulted in Allegheny Health Network 
and Highmark becoming ""the second largest integrated delivery and financing system in the country, known as an 'IDFS.'"" 
(Cashion Dec. 6, 2018, Decl. at ¶ 6). According to Highmark, UPMC is ""the primary competitor"" of the AHN/Highmark IDFS. (Id.)."
1728,69," In its briefs on class certification, Plaintiff does not quote or even paraphrase the content of Pl. Exs. 17 and 29. Rather Plaintiff 
includes pinpoint citations to pages in those exhibits. For example, on page 4 of Plaintiff's Memorandum in Support of Motion for 
Class Certification (ECF 534-1), Plaintiff states that ""The conspiracy allowed Highmark to maintain and strengthen its market 
power.17"" Note 17 reads: ""17 See Cantor Report at 23-24; Ex. 17 29-34, Ex. 29 18-19."""
1728,70," Plaintiff's expert (Dr. Cantor) listed these two exhibits in her expert report and testimony, along with a number of other ""Expert 
Reports,"" including other reports from Dr. Harris and Compass Lexecon. [See Pl. Ex. 1, Attachment 3, ""Material Considered,"" at 
5-6; Pl. Ex. 42, Attachment 3, ""Materials Considered,"" at 5-6; notably Supplemental Expert Report of Cantor, dated Nov. 14, 
2018, (no exhibit number), includes no mention of Harris, Compass Lexecon or PID]. "
1729,71," Highmark also stated in its Feb. 22, 2019, letter that it would continue to seek sealing of Pl. Ex. 29 in its entirety and sealing of 
the non-public version of Pl. Ex. 17. Highmark did submit arguments to seal each redaction already made by PID in Pl. Ex. 17. 
(See Highmark Feb. 22, 2019 Sealing Chart at 48-61)."
1729,72," See Jan. 9, 2019, Ltr., Special Master to PID Commissioner Altman, and Feb. 9, 2019 Ltr., Chief Counsel of the PID to the 
Special Master."
1729,73," The April 26th email attached a two-page list of the pinpoint citations to Plaintiff's briefs and Dr. Cantor's report and testimony 
that the Special master had identified, as well as footnotes referencing the documents from which the list was made. On May 
11th, the Special Master followed up with Plaintiff's counsel for a response and re-sent the detailed list on May 14th. (See Email, 
Ms. Anderson to Mr. Cavanaugh with attachment)."
1729,74," Plaintiff also ""demand[ed] that Highmark make the required showing necessary to continue [sic] any redacted information from 
public view."" (Feb. 19, 2019 Ltr., Mr. Stone to the Special Master at 1). "
1730,75," If the Court requests additional material be included from these exhibits, the Special Master, of course, will review it and make 
supplementary recommendations on sealing."
1730,76," For this Report and Recommendation No. 6, the Special Master has reviewed only the class certification materials currently 
before him."
1730,77," The pinpoint cites that are listed here reflect input from Highmark (see Email Apr. 29, 2019, Highmark to the Special Master). 
The Special Master twice asked Plaintiff to comment on the pinpoint citations identified, (see emails, April 26, 2019, J. Levie to "
1731,," Plaintiff and Highmark, and May 14, 2019, Ms. Anderson to Plaintiff), but Plaintiff expressly refused the Special Master's follow 
up request for input. (See email, Plaintiff to the Special Master, May 17, 2019). "
1732,78," 40 P.S. § 991.1407 Confidential Treatment (a) All information, documents, materials and copies thereof in the possession or control of the department that are 
produced by, obtained by or disclosed to the department or any other person in the course of an examination or 
investigation made pursuant to section 1406 or investigation made pursuant to section 1406.1 or 1406.2 and all information 
reported pursuant to sections 1402(b)(11.1) and (11.2), 1404 and 1405 shall be privileged and given confidential treatment 
and shall not be: (1) Subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in a private civil action. (2) [*125]  Subject to subpoena. (3) Subject to the act of February 14, 2008 (P.L. 6, No. 3), known as the ""Right-to-Know Law."" (4) Made public by the department or any other person, except to regulatory or law enforcement officials of other 
jurisdictions or group supervisors or members of a supervisory college in accordance with subsection (c), without the 
prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the department, after giving the insurer and its affiliates 
who would be affected thereby notice and opportunity to be heard, determines that the interest of policyholders, 
shareholders or the public will be served by the publication thereof, in which event it may publish all or any part thereof 
in such manner as it may deem appropriate."
1732,79," Contrary to Highmark's repeated assertions that ""third-party Highmark Health . . . has not had an opportunity to provide its 
position on these proceedings to establish the current competitive harm it would suffer as an IDFS in competition with the UPMC 
IDFS"" (Highmark Feb. 22, 2019 Sealing Chart at 48 and 66), the Special Master, in fact, afforded Highmark Health the 
opportunity to participate in this sealing process, but Highmark Health has not accepted his invitations. (See Sept. 17, 2018, 
email from Ms. Anderson, Counsel to the Special Master, to Highmark, Inc.). Thus, the Special Master finds that Highmark 
Health's lack of participation and lack of substantiation to support its concerns are not grounds to seal either the non-public 
version of Pl. Ex. 17 or Pl. Ex. 29. "
1733,80," The one exception is that, after UPMC settled, it ""produced highly confidential claims data pursuant to a subpoena from 
Plaintiff."" (UPMC Aug. 31, 2018, Ltr. Br. at 7). UPMC states the ""claims data produced by UPMC has never been made public 
and are among UPMC's most closely-guarded and confidential information."" (Farner Aug. 29, 2018, 2d Suppl. Decl. ¶ 34). 
Accordingly, the Special Master evaluates whether UPMC's claims data qualifies as ""confidential commercial information, such 
as trade secrets"" which should be sealed, as noted in Section IV.C(2) supra at 43-45, on a document by document or line-by-line 
basis. "
2001,1, The parties have consented to the jurisdiction of the undersigned magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(c). 
2004,2," ""Reverse passing off"" occurs where ""[t]he producer misrepresents someone else's goods or services as his own."" 539 U.S. at 
27 n. 1 (citing Williams v. Curtiss—Wright Corp., 691 F.2d 168, 172 (3d Cir. 1982)). "
2005,3," As discussed below, the Court finds that Sandhu's Lanham Act Counterclaim fails under Daster and Sybersound. Therefore, it 
does not summarize here Gibel's argument that the counterclaim fails for the independent reason that Sandhu has not alleged 
that any misrepresentations were made in ""commercial advertising"" because the Film has not been completed and no marketing 
of the Film has occurred. "
2007,4," In Paragraph 75, Sandhu also alleges that Gibel ""blocked access to those promotional materials and social media outlets."" 
Sandhu has cited no authority suggesting that this conduct, by itself, constitutes false advertising (or even that it is advertising). "
2015,1," The Merck Defendants consist of Merck & Co., Inc.; Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.; Schering-Plough Corp.; Schering Corp.; and 
MSP Singapore Co. LLC."

2016,5," The existence of an antitrust conspiracy is a threshold element in claims under either Sherman Act § 1 or § 2. 15 U.S.C. § 1; 
Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 202 (4th Cir. 2002). "
2017,6," In American Needle, Inc. v. National Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010), the Supreme 
Court rejected NFL teams' argument that, because they acted through a joint venture, their conduct was that of a ""single 
economic enterprise"" under Copperweld. "
2018,7," The court notes that Copperweld and American Needle involved appeals from a trial verdict and grant of summary judgment, 
respectively, not of a motion to dismiss. See Copperweld, 467 U.S. at 758; American Needle, 560 U.S. at 188."
2018,8," In that briefing, the Defendants argued that the Amended Complaints did not contain allegations of an agreement between 
Merck and Par, and only alleged agreements between Glenmark and Merck, and Glenmark and Par. See Merck-DPP Mot. Dis. 
Memo. at 8, ECF No. 354. "
2019,9," Because the court agrees with the DPPs' and Retailers' objection to Part III.A of the R&R, namely that the Amended 
Complaints plead facts that establish an antitrust conspiracy between Par, Merck, and Glenmark, see supra Section III.A of this 
Memorandum Opinion and Order, the court will not address their argument regarding the applicability of FTC v. Actavis, 570 
U.S. 136, 141, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013) (holding that ""reverse payment settlements . . . can sometimes violate 
the antitrust laws""). See DPPs' Objs. at 13-14; Retailers' Objs. at 3-5. As the Plaintiffs read Actavis, the Supreme Court did not 
question Par's involvement as a co-conspirator where Par, in a similar arrangement to this case, ""did not file an application of its 
own [i.e., an ANDA] but joined forces with Paddock, agreeing to share the patent litigation costs in return for a share of profits if 
Paddock obtained approval for its generic drug."" 570 U.S. at 144-45. "
2021,10," This Memorandum Opinion and Order is limited to the claims addressed herein and does not address any of the other claims 
involved in this case. See supra Section I. "
2024,1," ""At the pleadings stage of a case, the court assumes the truth of 'all well-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegations' in the 
complaint.'"" Durant v. N.Y.C. Housing Auth., No. 12-CV-937 (NGG) (JMA), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36919, 2012 WL 928343, at *1 
(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2012) (quoting Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petrol. Co., 621 F.3d 111, 123 (2d Cir. 2010))."
2024,2," Though Plaintiff does not provide any specific information as to when the Property was foreclosed, it appears that the state 
foreclosure proceeding terminated with an order of foreclosure in 2009. See Nationstar Mortg., LLC v. Ramnarine, 172 A.D.3d 
886, 100 N.Y.S.3d 278, 279 (N.Y. App. Div. 2019) (affirming the denial of Plaintiff's motion to vacate a judgment of foreclosure 
and sale). "
2025,3," The Court notes that ""[a]t the threshold, Plaintiff cannot actually sue directly under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, because 
'Section 1 of the Sherman Act does not itself provide a private right of action.'"" Ruotolo v. Fannie Mae, 933 F. Supp. 2d 512, 519 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (quoting In re Publ'n Paper Antitrust Litig., 690 F.3d 51, 62 (2d Cir. 2012)). Rather, a private right of action ""is 
established by section 4 of the Clayton Act, which authorizes private suits by 'any person who shall be injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.'"" In re Publ'n Paper Antitrust Litig., 690 F.3d at 62 (quoting 15 
U.S.C. § 15). In light of Plaintiff's pro se status, the Court construes his Sherman Act claim as being brought pursuant to the 
relevant portions of the Clayton Act. "
2026,4," ""Antitrust standing, distinct from constitutional standing, is 'a threshold, pleading-stage inquiry and when a complaint by its 
terms fails to establish this requirement [the court] must dismiss it as a matter of law.'"" Abbott Labs. v. Adelphia Supply USA, No. 
15-CV-5826 (CBA) (LB), 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 205321, 2017 WL 5992355, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2017) (quoting Gatt 
Commc'ns Inc. v. PMC Assocs., L.L.C., 711 F.3d 68, 75 (2d Cir. 2013)). "
2028,5," As the Court stated in its previous Memorandum & Order, ""[t]hough the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to review a state-
court judgment, it can consider 'claims sounding under the [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (""FDCPA"")], RICO, and state law' 
because such claims 'speak not to the propriety of the state court judgments, but to the fraudulent course of conduct that 
defendants pursued in obtaining such judgments.'"" Ramnarine, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 181641, 2019 WL 5309994, at *3 (quoting 
Sykes v. Mel S. Harris & Assocs. LLC, 780 F.3d 70, 94-95 (2d Cir. 2015)). Plaintiff was afforded the opportunity to replead any 
claims based on the FDCPA or similar statutes. See id. Plaintiff instead chose to file the instant amended complaint, relying, 
unsuccessfully, on the Sherman Act. None of the allegations in the amended complaint support an inference that Defendants 
engaged in a course of fraudulent conduct to obtain the state foreclosure judgment. The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiff 
is unable to, in good faith, plead any claims pursuant to the FDCPA or other similar statutes, which further indicates that any 
further opportunities to replead would be futile. "
2030,1," This order refers to the entity as both ""Zoove"" and ""StarStar Mobile."" "
2044,1," As such, the Court will not address herein any boilerplate objections or arguments for which there is no meaningful discussion 
because they do not suffice to deny the motion to compel. "
2045,2," Judges in this District have held that these rules require that the movant must ""personally engage in two-way communication 
with the nonresponding party to meaningfully discuss each contested discovery dispute in a genuine effort to avoid judicial 
intervention."" ShuffleMaster, Inc. v. Progressive Games, Inc., 170 F.R.D. 166, 171 (D. Nev. 1996). The consultation obligation 
""promote[s] a frank exchange between counsel to resolve issues by agreement or to at least narrow and focus matters in 
controversy before judicial resolution is sought."" Nevada Power, 151 F.R.D. at 120. To meet this obligation, parties must ""treat 
the informal negotiation process as a substitute for, and not simply a formalistic prerequisite to, judicial resolution of discovery 
disputes."" Id. This is done when the parties ""present to each other the merits of their respective positions with the same candor, 
specificity, and support during the informal negotiations as during the briefing of discovery motions."" Id. To ensure that parties 
comply with these requirements, movants must file certifications that ""accurately and specifically convey to the court who, where, 
how, and when the respective parties attempted to personally resolve the discovery dispute."" ShuffleMaster, 170 F.R.D. at 170. "
2046,3," It is helpful to keep in mind that a denial of a motion to compel on this ground is generally without prejudice to the refiling of the 
motion in the event that further efforts at negotiation prove unsuccessful. See, e.g., Aevoe, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 124593, 2013 
WL 4714273, at *2. There is likely no useful purpose to require further meet-and-confer efforts when the parties are clearly at an 
impasse and the motion to compel will simply be refiled. Cf. Crown Cork & Seal Co. v. Chemed Corp., 101 F.R.D. 105, 106 (E.D. 
Pa. 1984) (judicial intervention is appropriate when ""further efforts at negotiation are pointless"")."
2046,4," The discussion as to the issues now in dispute occurred at the end of a three-hour call in which other issues were also 
discussed. Docket No. 139-2 at ¶ 14. According to Defendant's counsel, ""[b]oth sides were noticeably tired."" Id. at ¶ 15."
2046,5," Defendant insinuates that written correspondence must be part of the meet-and-confer process. See, e.g., Resp. at 8. Written 
correspondence is helpful in many instances for the evaluation of the parties' competing positions, but the governing rules omit a 
requirement that the conferral efforts must include written discussion. Instead, the rules require personal consultation in the form 
of a face-to-face meeting, telephonic conference, or video conference. See, e.g., Local Rule IA 1-3(f)."
2046,6," According to the declaration of defense counsel Chad Harrison, ""[i]t was obvious that the parties needed some time to discuss 
the subject."" Docket No. 139-2 at ¶ 15. Regardless of what may have been obvious to Mr. Harrison, the responsive brief 
acknowledges that defense counsel Sam Castor instructed Plaintiff to proceed with filing the motion to compel. Resp. at 8; see 
also Docket No. 133-1 at ¶ 7. Defendant ties itself in a pretzel attempting to make sense of these incompatible facts by asserting 
that Mr. Castor's instruction to file the motion to compel was made with the ""reasonable expectation"" that further written conferral 
efforts would be made before filing a motion. Resp. at 8. This assertion makes no sense. The purpose of conferring is to avoid or 
narrow motion practice, so an attorney would not instruct that a motion to compel should be filed if he truly believed that further 
meet-and-confer efforts might lead to a compromise negating the need for that very same motion practice. "
2047,7," Some courts have called this practice into question. See, e.g., Carr, 312 F.R.D. at 470 (""Responding to interrogatories and 
document requests 'subject to' and/or 'without waiving' objections is manifestly confusing (at best) and misleading (at worst), and 
has no basis in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure"" (quoting Heller v. City of Dallas, 303 F.R.D. 466, 487-88 (N.D. Tex. 2014)). 
The parties have not briefed that issue here, so the Court assumes that it was proper for Defendant to answer subject to its 
objections."
2047,8, This response is identical with respect to both interrogatories.
2047,9," It is well established that the failure to raise a timely objection in responding to a discovery request results in the waiver of that 
objection. See, e.g., Richmark Corp. v. Timber Falling Consultants, 959 F.2d 1468, 1473 (9th Cir. 1992). As Plaintiff correctly 
states, Reply at 5, Defendant did not raise a relevance objection in response to the interrogatories. See Docket No. 133-2 at 37-
39 (initial interrogatory responses). The Court notes that Defendant did raise an overbreadth objection, which Defendant had 
earlier defined as including a relevance objection. See Docket No. 133-2 at 11 (attempting to define the term ""overly broad"" to 
include a relevance objection). The Court need not resolve this waiver issue because Defendant's argument fails on its merits. "
2048,10," When an interrogatory answer may be determined by examining business records and the burden of deriving the information 
is substantially the same for either party, then the responding party may specify the records to be reviewed and give the 
discovering party an opportunity to review those records. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(d); see also Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc. v. Yang 
Kun Chung, 321 F.R.D. 250, 282 (N.D. Tex. 2017) (outlining specific requirements for such a response). This provision is not 
implicated here. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Landis v. Tailwind Sports Corp., 317 F.R.D. 592, 594 (D.D.C. 2016) (the option 
to produce business records does not apply to contention interrogatories). "
2049,11," Defendant now contends that this was a typographical error. See Resp. at 15 n.53. If there was an error in the interrogatory 
responses, Defendant has an affirmative duty to correct it. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(e)(1)(A). At any rate, the generalized 
identification of trade secrets fails to comply with the interrogatory request as discussed herein."
2049,12," Defendant appears to argue that its supplemental responses are appropriate on the basis that Plaintiff is equally able to 
discern which trade secrets and intellectual property it is that Defendant contends were stolen. See, e.g., Resp. at 2-3, 9, 17. 
Such an argument lacks merit. See, e.g., National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, 256 F.R.D. at 681 (collecting cases 
rejecting objection that an interrogatory is improper if it seeks information equally available to both parties)."
2049,13," Defendant argues that some of the information is confidential. See Resp. at 15. No legal authority or meaningfully developed 
argument is provided that the confidential nature of the information suffices to prevent disclosure to Plaintiff, especially given the 
potential protection afforded through a stipulated protective order. Moreover, Defendant goes on to argue that Plaintiff actually 
already has access to the information at issue. See Resp. at 16. Defendant does not explain how it has a confidentiality concern 
with respect to providing rule-compliant interrogatory responses if Plaintiff already has access to that same information. "
2051,1," Where, as here, the parties introduce conflicting affidavits, the Court resolves conflicts in the plaintiff's favor. See Am. Tel & Tel. 
Co. v. Compagnie Bruxelles Lambert, 94 F.3d 586, 588-89 (9th Cir. 1996). The Court denies as moot plaintiff's evidentiary 
objections to the Declaration of Body Bertram, dkt. 13-1, because the Court does not rely on the declaration in deciding the 
motion. Dkt. 18-2. "
2055,2," Defendant does not address the reasonableness factors in its motion. See Motion at 5-7. In its reply, defendant simply argues 
that it would be unreasonable for the Court to exercise personal jurisdiction in this case because ""the only connection . . . 
between Defendant and the forum [] is that a contract exists . . . between Plaintiff . . . and Defendant."" Id., "
