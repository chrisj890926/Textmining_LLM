25,1," The Court assumes, for the purposes of this order, that this declaration is admissible even though it is dated December 12, 
2013, which was after the deadline to exchange expert reports."
25,2," Even if the challenged restraint did affect recruiting in other sports, it is undisputed that the restraint does not uniformly affect 
the recruiting market in all sports. Indeed, the NCAA's assertion that its restrictions on student-athlete pay enable Division I 
schools to redistribute resources to women's sports and less prominent men's sports rests on the assumption that certain sports 
generate more revenue than others. By restricting the benefits that schools may offer recruits in high-revenue sports, the 
challenged rules necessarily have a greater impact on certain recruits than others, even if the rules technically apply across all 
sports. "
26,3," The NCAA's motion appears to focus on Dr. Rubinfeld's analysis of the college education market. However, to the extent the 
NCAA contends that Dr. Rubinfeld's analysis of the ""group licensing"" market also justifies its request for leave to seek 
reconsideration, that contention is also rejected."
26,4," In its motion, the NCAA highlights evidence presented at summary judgment showing that Division I schools are ""required to 
provide a minimum amount of financial aid for [student-athletes] in sports other than football and men's basketball."" NCAA Mot. 
Reconsid. 6. This evidence, however, does not establish that the relevant market includes student-athletes from other sports 
and, even if it did, the NCAA could not justify the challenged restraint in this case simply by asserting that it must follow other 
rules of its own creation. "
27,5," Even if the NCAA subscribed to this questionable understanding of Title IX, it would still be able to require its member 
conferences to redistribute their Division I football and basketball revenue to less prominent men's sports. "
30,1," The Court consolidated these cases pursuant to Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on August 21, 2012. (Order 
dated August 31, 2012.) The consolidated cases were reassigned to me on the parties' consent in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 
636(c). (Order dated October 31, 2013.)"
30,2," FC requested a stay of this action because it filed a petition to cancel SBI's trademark registration of ""skee-ball,"" with the United 
States Patent & Trademark Office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (""TTAB"") on May 1, 2014 and expects the TTAB to hold 
a trial in July 2015. (ECF No. 41.) FC's request is denied. FC's complaint states that ""[a] judicial determination is necessary and 
appropriate at this time"" and that the parties' ""controversy is incapable of resolution without judicial adjudication."" (Compl. ¶ 35.) 
The Court finds that FC's pending petition does not warrant a stay of this action. With the parties' cooperation, this action shall 
be expedited. "
32,3," The Court notes that SBI filed the first action, albeit in an improper venue, and appears to argue that it will be prejudiced if its 
case is not the lead case. The Court notes that these cases were originally deemed consolidated by the Clerk of Court, prior to a 
judicial determination. Several months after the fact, the Court determined that the cases should be consolidated. (Order dated 
August 31, 2012.) At this juncture, the Court need not reconsider the consolidation or lead case designation. "
34,4," To the extent FC proposes new factual bases for its breach of contract claim in its opposition brief, the Court shall not consider 
these additional facts. See generally Halebian v. Berv, 644 F.3d 122, 130 (2d Cir. 2011) (the court ""does not ordinarily look 
beyond the complaint and attached documents in deciding a motion to dismiss brought under [Rule 12(b)(6)]."") As the pleading 
stands, it is ""insufficient to make the requisite plausible factual demonstration of the basis of [FC's breach of contract] claim."" 
Fink v. Time Warner Cable, 810 F. Supp. 2d 633, 645 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)."
34,5," For its proposition that the Statute of Frauds is inapplicable because there was no express stipulation not to perform the 
contract in a year, FC relies on a 1978 Second Circuit decision that states that ""[t]he practice of the New York courts has been to 
construe this one-year provision of the statute narrowly"" and ""the one-year provision has been held to bar enforcement of oral "
35,," contracts only in those cases where the contract is by express stipulation not to be performed within a year"" and not to cases ""in 
which the performance of the agreement depends upon a contingency which may or may not happen within the year."" (FC Opp'n 
at 14 (quoting Weisse v. Engelhard Minerals & Chem. Corp., 571 F.2d 117, 119 (2d Cir. 1978)(internal quotation marks 
omitted)). However, this 1978 case does not reflect the current state of the law. In 2009, the Circuit stated, ""[t]he principle that 
this aspect of the Statute of Frauds encompasses only those contracts that 'by their very terms have absolutely no possibility in 
fact and law of full performance within one year,... has not, however, been applied literally."" South Cherry Street, LLC, 573 F.3d 
at 105 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "
36,6," Notably, SBI does not move to dismiss on the grounds that FC fails to allege how SBI misappropriated the information FC 
disclosed or that this claim is duplicative of any other claims. "
37,7," The statute provides: Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to 
monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of 
a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other 
person, $1,000,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court."
37,15," U.S.C. § 2. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 15: any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue 
therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant [*26]  resides or is found or has an 
agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the 
cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. "
38,8," Even assuming the SBI is unfairly prohibiting FC from using the term ""skee-ball,"" there are no factual allegations that this then 
enables SBI to ""price monopolistically without prompt erosion from rivals' entry or expansion."" Areeda, ¶ 501 at 111. In other 
words, the trademark does not provide the power to exclude FC; FC can still enter the market it intends to enter as long as it 
doesn't unlawfully trespass on SBI's mark."
38,9," FC's opposition to instant motion also argues that SBI is ""self-professed to be the primary source of skee-ball machines in the 
United States"" and quotes SBI's website which states that it is an industry leader in the amusement game industry. (FC Opp'n at 
22.) However, the Court cannot read these allegations into the pleadings. See generally, Todd, 275 F.3d at 198 (""It is ... 
improper to assume that the plaintiff can prove facts that it has not alleged or that the defendants have violated the antitrust laws 
in ways that have not been alleged."")(internal quotation marks omitted). "
39,10," SBI's argument that FC's allegations are ""false, utterly implausible, and without any factual support"" goes too far. (SBI Mot. to 
Dismiss at 19.) FC's factual allegations must be accepted, at this juncture, to be true. Nonetheless, taken as true, the factual 
allegations do not plausibly state a claim of anticompetitive conduct."
39,11," Moreover, the Court notes that the doctrine of antitrust immunity for acts petitioning or directed towards influencing 
governmental action may apply to SBI's lawsuit. Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 
81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961). While there is an exception for ""sham"" litigation, to qualify for this exception, SBI's 
complaint must be ""objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits."" 
Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U.S. at 60. In accordance with Supreme Court law, ""[a]n objectively reasonable effort to 
litigate cannot be sham regardless of subjective intent."" Id. at 57. Here, FC does not allege facts to plausibly suggest that SBI's 
lawsuit falls into the ""sham"" exception. "
43,**," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
44,*," The Honorable David A. Ezra, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, sitting by designation."
44,1, We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. 
45,2," Defendants argue that the allegations regarding the fair market price provision are not sufficient to establish the existence of a 
price-fixing  [**7] conspiracy. We express no opinion on this issue. As set forth infra in section IV, we leave this issue for the 
district court to address on remand."
45,3," Plaintiffs  [**8] seek to maintain their action on behalf of themselves and a series of sub-classes consisting of consumers from 
various states who purchased SD cards within the class period, which includes the period from March 15, 2007 to the present. "
46,4," HN2[
] Under the doctrine of laches, a suit seeking equitable relief will be barred if a party has inexcusably delayed pursuing 
his claim and his adversary has been prejudiced as a result. Int'l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 518 F.2d at 926."
46,5," Defendants argue, relying on AMF, that the alleged anti-competitive impact caused by their combination was ""permanent at 
initiation,"" i.e. in the early 2000s when they first allegedly combined to develop the SD standard, and that the continued sales of 
SD cards at supracompetitive prices were ""but unabated inertial consequences of [their] pre-limitations action."" 591 F.2d at 72. 
Therefore, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' lawsuit should have been filed within four years of Defendants' initial  [**13] violation 
of the antitrust laws. As we explained in Samsung, ""AMF is the exception, not the rule."" Samsung, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 6256, 
2014 WL 1328318 at *2. In AMF, ""the unique nature of the automobile business meant that the initial refusal to deal was an 
'irrevocable, immutable, permanent and final' decision and any damages that occurred during the limitations period 'necessarily 
resulted from'"" the initial refusal. Id. (quoting AMF, 591 F.2d at 72). Here, in contrast, ""the license itself did not permanently and 
finally control the acts of"" Defendants. Id. Defendants could have ceased charging the price-fixed price at any time. "
53,1," See ECF 10, Case No. 13-cv-194 (M.D. Tenn.) (Status Report and Joint Statement of Issues) (stipulating that the only 
unresolved issues regarding TRG's Motion to Quash concern Requests 1, 2, and 4). "
54,2," Contemporaneously with the filing of its Motion to Quash, TRG served Plaintiffs with objections to the subpoena. "
55,3," TRG also argued in its briefing that the subpoena requests require ""disclosure of privileged or other protected matter,"" Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A)(iii). Specifically, TRG contended that Tennessee's Shield Law, Tenn. Code 24-1-208, creates a privilege over 
the requested material. At oral argument, TRG conceded that privileges created by state law are not applicable to this case. See 
EEOC v. Ill. Dept. of Emp't Sec., 995 F.2d 106, 108 (7th Cir. 1993)  [**11] (""State privileges are honored in federal litigation only 
when state law supplies the rule of decision. When federal law governs, as it does here, only privileges recognized by the 
national government matter.""). "
57,4," The 1991 Amendment Advisory Committee Notes provide: Clause (c)(3)(B)(ii) provides protection for the intellectual property of the non-party witness. . . . A growing problem has 
been the use of subpoenas to compel the giving of evidence and information by unretained experts. Experts are not exempt 
from the duty to give evidence, . . . but compulsion to give evidence  [**16] may threaten the intellectual property of experts 
denied the opportunity to bargain for the value of their services. Arguably, the compulsion to testify can be regarded as a 
""taking"" of intellectual property. The rule establishes the right of such persons to withhold their expertise, at least unless the 
party seeking it makes the kind of showing required for a conditional denial of a motion to quash as provided in the final 
sentence of subparagraph (c)(3)(B); that requirement is the same as that necessary to secure work product under Rule 
26(b)(3) and gives reasonable assurance of compensation. Although the present motion does not concern expert testimony, the commentary is illustrative of the concern that the subpoena 
power could be used to procure commercially valuable intellectual property without compensation."
57,5," Rule 45(c)(3)(B) was recently redesignated as Rule 45(d)(3)(B) in 2013. That provision provides: HN8[
] (B) When [Quashing or Modifying a Subpoena Is] Permitted. To protect a person subject to or affected by a 
subpoena, the court for the district where compliance is required may, on motion, quash or modify the subpoena if it 
requires: (i) disclosing a trade secret or other confidential  [**17] research, development, or commercial information; or (ii) disclosing an unrelated expert's opinion or information that does not describe specific occurrences in dispute and results 
from the expert's study that was not requested by a party. Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(B)."
57,6," Prior to the 1991 Amendments, the rules provided limited guidance to courts. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(b) (1990) (instructing 
courts to quash or modify a subpoena if it was  [**19] ""unreasonable and oppressive""). "
60,7, This is not to be taken as any implication that TRG was a participant in the alleged conspiracy. 
63,8," Valencia is not distinguishable from this case because the Valencia document request originated from a grand jury subpoena—
a subpoena with considerably more power, and fewer constraints,  [**41] than a civil discovery subpoena. Rather, Valencia is 
instructive because of how the court treated McGraw-Hill's confidential information after it was produced. "
65,9," The Court will leave the details of this aspect of compensation to discussions between counsel for Plaintiffs and TRG in the first 
instance. If counsel cannot come to an agreement within fourteen (14) days, the Court should be advised by letter and a 
conference will be scheduled."
65,10, See supra note 4.
65,11," Although not directly on point because they deal with administrative subpoenas, two Third Circuit cases provide some 
guidance as to whether a nonparty is entitled to compensation for complying with a subpoena. Rule 45 does not apply to 
administrative subpoenas. United States v. Friedman, 532 F.2d 928, 937) (3d Cir. 1976). Nevertheless, these decisions applied "
66,," the principles underlying Rule 45 by analogy. In EEOC v. Kronos, the court looked to Friedman—a case that examined Rule 45 
at a time when the rule did not expressly provide for reasonable compensation—to enumerate principles that district courts 
should consider ""with respect to fairness in subpoena enforcement proceedings."" 694 F.3d 351, 371-72 (3d Cir. 2012) (quoting 
Friedman, 532 F.2d at 937). Kronos described these principles as follows: the primary consideration in fairly allocating the  [**49] cost of compliance with an administrative subpoena is whether the 
cost of compliance with the subpoena exceeded that which the respondent may reasonably be expected to bear as a cost 
of doing business. Such an inquiry requires at least some evidence to support a party's assertion about what the actual 
costs of compliance will be. We also adopt the general proposition that a non-party should not be expected to bear as great 
an expense as a party when complying with a subpoena, a principle which finds support in the fact that Rule 45 
distinguishes between reimbursement for parties and non-parties. Id. at 372 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). These principles will be informative if there is no agreement on costs 
and the Court has to determine the precise amount of compensation owed to TRG for the costs of complying with the subpoena. 
They do not, however, provide guidance for whether compensation is owed for any intellectual property that TRG may disclose 
to Plaintiffs. "
74,1," Defendant heavily relies on In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation, 200 F.R.D. 297 (E.D. Mich 2001). The court in Cardizem 
concluded that the generic bypass issue did not preclude class certification. After so concluding, the court noted that the 
plaintiffs would be required to account for ""the by-pass phenomenon"" when presenting its case to the jury. Id. at 317. Based 
upon this Court's understanding of Hanover Shoe and Illinois Brick, the Court is unable to agree with this decision reached in "
75,," Cardizem and must respectfully decline to follow Cardizem as did the court in Relafen. See Relafen, 346 F. Supp. 2d at 368 n.11 
(""Respectfully, this Court did not consider Cardizem conclusive."")."
75,2," Also as in Relafen, Plaintiffs have indicated their desire to opt out of the direct purchaser settlement  [*22] class. "
77,3," Another circuit case, In re Beef Industry Antitrust Litig., 600 F.2d 1148, 1166 n.24 (5th Cir. 1979), suggested in a footnote that 
umbrella damages satisfy proximate causation. This holding has been called into doubt by later courts. See In re Vitamins 
Antitrust Litig., MDL NO. 1285, 99CIV5134, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12114, 2001 WL 855463, at *4 (D.D.C. June 2, 2001) (noting 
that the Beef Industry court relied on the ""target area"" standing test later rejected by the Supreme Court in Associated Gen. 
Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 537-45, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) and 
that ""[t]he overwhelming majority of recent court decisions that have addressed the viability of the 'umbrella' theory after 
Associated General have rejected 'umbrella' claims""). "
84,1," Plaintiffs have also moved for leave to file a surreply and addendum to their statement of additional material facts. For reasons 
stated below, the Court grants the motion. "
85,2," Plaintiffs cite this same document, a 2003 CTIA press release, as stating the Leadership Council was intended ""to further the 
'collective vision for the industry.'"" Pls.' Resp. at 48; see also Pls.' LR 56.1 Stat. ¶ PCTIA28 (both citing Pls.' Ex. 449). The 
phrase ""collective vision for the industry"" does not appear in this document. "
86,3, The requested instructions are:
86,1," . CTIA destroyed e-mails created or received by CTIA's Vice President of WID, Mark Desautels, to conceal evidence 
 [**16] that would have been unfavorable to CTIA;"
86,2," . CTIA destroyed Desautels's laptop profile and documents contained therein to conceal evidence that would have been 
unfavorable to CTIA;"
86,3," . T-Mobile destroyed an e-mail created by employees with responsibility over pricing to conceal evidence that would have 
been unfavorable to T-Mobile; and"
86,4," . T-Mobile destroyed handwritten notebooks created by an employee with responsibility over pricing to conceal evidence 
unfavorable to T-Mobile. Pls.' Spoliation Mem. at 32. "
88,4," Plaintiffs also cite to district court cases that are plainly in conflict with recent Seventh Circuit precedent and cite to out-of-circuit 
cases to support their contentions. The plaintiffs point to Adkins v. Mid-America Growers, Inc., 141 F.R.D. 466, 473 (N.D. Ill. 
1992), which says, ""In cases where evidence has been intentionally destroyed, it may be presumed that the materials were 
relevant."" See Pls.' Spoliation Mem. at 10 n.10. Yet Adkins cites only two 1987 cases for this rule: one from the D.C. Circuit, and 
another from the Northern District of California. This statement of law is also plainly in conflict with Seventh Circuit  [**24] law 
stating that intentional destruction of a document is not enough; the document must have been destroyed for the purpose of 
eliminating adverse information. See, e.g., Faas, 532 F.3d at 644 (""In order to draw an inference that the Leadership Overviews 
contained information adverse to Sears, we must find that Sears intentionally destroyed the documents in bad faith.""). Plaintiffs 
do cite to Bracey and other Seventh Circuit cases in their reply memoranda but proceed after doing so to cite other cases that 
articulate a different standard. See, e.g., Pls.' Repl. to CTIA at 6-7. "
89,5," The parties debate whether and when litigation was reasonably foreseeable vis-à-vis the destruction of the e-mails. The Court 
will assume for present purposes that litigation was indeed imminent at that point, the standard that plaintiffs advocate. "
119,1," Market concentration, typically measured using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, is a function of (1) the number, and (2) 
respective market shares of firms in a given market. U.S. Dep't of Justice & Federal Trade Comm'n, Horizontal Merger 
Guidelines § 5.3 (2010). "
120,2," Although the underlying antitrust litigation involves multiple plaintiffs, D&G is the only one at issue in this appeal. Cf. In re 
Wholesale Grocery Prods. Antitrust Litig., 707 F.3d 917, 919 (8th Cir. 2013) (reversing ""the district court's ruling that equitable 
estoppel bars"" other plaintiffs ""from asserting antitrust claims in federal court""). "
121,3," To the extent some of our more recent cases have, without explanation, perpetuated dicta that district courts should rarely 
enter summary judgment in antitrust cases, see, e.g., HDC Med., Inc. v. Minntech Corp., 474 F.3d 543, 546 (8th Cir. 2007), this 
dicta must be rejected as inconsistent with Judge Richard S. Arnold's cogent analysis, and binding prior-panel opinion in 
Associated Electric, 838 F.2d at 273-74. See Mader v. United States, 654 F.3d 794, 800 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc)."
121,4," Surprisingly, it appears our adherence to the unadorned text of Rule 56(a) places us at odds with two other circuits—
inconsistent with each other as well as inconsistent with our circuit. Compare PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co., 315 F.3d 101, 104 
(2d Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (""In the context of antitrust cases . . . summary judgment is particularly favored because of the 
concern that protracted litigation will chill pro-competitive market forces."" (emphasis added)), with Thurman Indus., Inc. v. Pay 'N 
Pak Stores, Inc., 875 F.2d 1369, 1373 (9th Cir. 1989) (""[T]his circuit generally disfavors summary judgment in antitrust cases."") 
(emphasis added)). "
122,5," Because a jury, after hearing evidence from both sides, must first answer the underlying factual questions, obviously we 
express no view at this stage whether the wholesalers actually committed any antitrust violation—per se or otherwise. See, e.g., 
Atkinson v. City of Mountain View, Mo., 709 F.3d 1201, 1211 (8th Cir. 2013) (""Which [side's] story is more plausible we cannot 
say because 'it is not our function to remove the credibility assessment from the jury.'"" (quoting Kukla v. Hulm, 310 F.3d 1046, 
1050 (8th Cir. 2002))). "
123,6," Our conclusion that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the  [**20] merits moots the challenge to the 
district court's denial of D&G's request for a continuance under Rule 56(d)."
123,7," Because the ultimate question whether per se or rule of reason analysis applies is one of law, we expect the district court will 
present the jury with factual interrogatories detailed enough to enable the court to make this choice. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 49; cf., 
e.g., Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 498, 108 S. Ct. 1931, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1988) (""In 
answers to special interrogatories, the jury found . . . . that petitioner's actions had an adverse impact on competition, were not 
the least restrictive means of expressing petitioner's opposition to the use of [a certain product] in the marketplace, and 
unreasonably restrained trade in violation of the antitrust laws.""); Baxley-DeLamar Monuments, Inc. v. Am. Cemetery Ass'n, 938 
F.2d 846, 849 (8th Cir. 1991) (""In its answer to special interrogatories, the jury found that there was no conspiracy among the 
defendants either to commit illegal tying  [**21] (section 1) or to monopolize the installation market (section 2).""). "
134,1," Graham defines “defendants' Lending  [***2] Personnel” (Lending Personnel) as “a lending team” composed of “people 
identified as vice-president, or manager, or as an appraiser or as a broker, or a loan officer, or a loan processor, or employee of "
135,," some type authored [sic] to create and process loan documents.” Graham alleges he does not remember the names of these 
individuals even though their names and titles appeared on business cards and name tags affixed to their clothing. He contends 
their identities are “more readily in the knowledge of defendants.”"
135,2, All further statutory references are to the Business and Professions Code unless otherwise noted.
135,3," The  [***3] court granted defendants' request for judicial notice of five documents recorded with the San Diego County 
Recorder's Office: (1) deed of trust recorded on December 30, 2004; (2) substitution of trustee recorded on October 27, 2011; 
(3) corporation assignment of deed of trust recorded on October 27, 2011; (4) notice of default and election to sell recorded on 
October 27, 2011; and (5) notice of trustee's sale recorded on February 13, 2012."
135,4, ReconTrust was erroneously sued as “Reconstruct Co. NA.”
135,5," American National is not a party to this appeal. According to Graham, the corporation is dissolved. "
136,6," We disregard many of the additions to the SAC, which appear to be irrelevant imports from pleadings in other cases, because 
we may disregard allegations that are contrary to facts of which judicial notice may be taken (Breneric Associates v. City of Del 
Mar (1998) 69 Cal.App.4th 166, 180 [81 Cal. Rptr. 2d 324]) and allegations that conflict with factual allegations in prior 
complaints (People ex rel. Gallegos v. Pacific Lumber Co. (2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 950, 957 [70 Cal. Rptr. 3d 501]). To illustrate, 
paragraph 12 of the SAC refers to a 2007 loan agreement, whereas Graham entered into the loan and deed of trust in 2004. 
Paragraphs 20 and 26 refer to the 2008 purchase of Countrywide by BofA and conduct by “Countrywide folks” whereas First 
Franklin was the loan originator for Graham's loan. Paragraph 47 states “defendant Countrywide” made a 2007 statement to 
investors about board-based declines in housing values at “the same time” representations were made to plaintiff, but Graham's 
loan originated in 2004. Additionally, the SAC alleges Lending Personnel did not advise plaintiff the loan would be “pre-
scheduled and sold immediately  [***8] upon execution of the loan” or that “MERS” (presumably Mortgage Electronic 
Registration Systems, Inc.) would be the controlling entity per the deed. The record before us does not indicate MERS has any 
involvement in this transaction. The deed of trust identifies lender First Franklin as the beneficiary and the trustee as 
Commonwealth Land Title Company. While the deed of trust permits the lender to sell the note or partial interest in the note 
without prior notice to the borrower and to appoint a successor trustee, the assignment of the deed of trust to Deutsche Bank 
and the substitution of trustee to ReconTrust did not occur until after Graham defaulted on the loan, seven years after origination 
of the loan. "
138,7," On appeal, Graham does not challenge the court's ruling on the third cause of action. Nor does Graham challenge the finding 
of no unfair business practices based on allegations of splitting the note from the deed. "
140,8," The Bank of America Corp. court also rejected the argument  [***22] that lenders were required to disclose to borrowers any 
alleged intent to defraud investors by selling loans to mortgage pools at inflated values, which allegedly resulted in depression of 
the real estate market. While the court concluded the lender had a duty to refrain from committing fraud, it did not have a duty to 
borrowers to disclose its postloan activities. (Bank of America Corp., supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at pp. 871–873.) "
142,9," HN10[
] An appraisal is required to conform to “generally accepted appraisal standards as evidence by the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice” and, among other things, be based upon the market value. (12 C.F.R. § 34.44 
(2014).) The federal regulations governing appraisals define market value as “the most probable price which a property should 
bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller each acting prudently 
and knowledgeably, and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a 
sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: [¶] (1) Buyer and seller are 
typically motivated; [¶] (2) Both parties are well informed or well  [***27] advised, and acting in what they consider their own best 
interests; [¶] (3) A reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; [¶] (4) Payment is made in terms of cash in U.S. 
dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and [¶] (5) The price represents the normal consideration for 
the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale.”

146,10," A number of California federal district courts, applying California law, have held plaintiffs are unable to show procedural 
unconscionability in similar loan transactions where the complaint “lacks facts establishing how the agreement was presented to 
the plaintiff, facts establishing relative bargaining power, or facts establishing a lack of negotiation.” (Riggins v. Bank of America,

149,1," Medina lodged his initial complaint on January 10, 2014. (ECF No. 1). After defendants  [*2] filed a motion to dismiss, Medina 
amended his complaint as a matter of right on March 21, 2014. (ECF No. 22). The factual background is based on the 
averments in the First Amended Complaint (""FAC""), which must be taken as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss."
149,2," The USPTO issued Patent No. 5,081,530 to Medina on January 14, 1992. "
151,3," The California Supreme Court has directed courts to look to the jurisprudence arising under section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45, for guidance in applying the unfair prong of the UCL. Davis v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 179 Cal. 
App. 4th 581, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 697 (2009). The factors defining ""unfairness"" under that  [*11] section are: ""(1) the consumer 
injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to consumers or competition; and 
(3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided."" Camacho v. Auto. Club of S. California, 
142 Cal. App. 4th 1394, 1403, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770 (2006)."
151,4," Medina does not specify whether this claim is for (a) intentional interference with prospective economic advantage or (b) 
negligent interference with prospective economic advantage. Due to his repeated averments  [*12] that defendants' conduct was 
fraudulent and intentional, this order construes his claim as alleging intentional interference. The distinction is of no 
consequence here, though, because both torts require that the defendant disrupt an economic relationship between the plaintiff 
and a third party. Because Medina fails to plead facts to support this element, he cannot state a claim under either tort theory. "
152,5," The same can be said for any prospective licensing opportunities with Honda, Optex, or the other entities that defendants 
allegedly ""[d]issuaded . . . from taking a license from Dr. Medina for the '530 patent."" (FAC ¶ 13). There are no allegations to 
suggest that Medina had an economic relationship with any of these companies. "
159,1," As previously discussed, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against Lubrizol on February 26, 2009, and then 
resolved the complaint by consent decree on April 7, 2009. The statute of limitations is generally suspended during the 
pendency of any civil or criminal proceeding instituted by the United States, and Z Technologies argues that this forty-day period 
should be added to  [**6] the statute of limitations under 15 U.S.C. § 16(i). See Yoder Bros., Inc. v. California-Florida Plant 
Corp., 537 F.2d 1347, 1361 (5th Cir. 1976) (""The tolling provision of the statute has the effect of giving antitrust plaintiffs a period 
of four years plus the length of the Government suit for which they can recover.""). Assuming Z Technologies is correct and the 
forty days should be added, we are presented with a statute of limitations of four years and forty days. "
161,2," Z Technologies discusses  [**10] extensively two district court cases, In re Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Antitrust Litig., No. 1:12-md-
2343, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 70968, 2013 WL 2181185, at *27-29 (E.D. Tenn. May 20, 2013), and In re Wholesale Grocery 
Products Antitrust Litig., 722 F. Supp. 2d 1079, 1086-89 (D. Minn. 2010). As both of these cases involved price increases 
brought in conspiracy claims, not in merger monopolization or unilateral monopolization claims, they provide little guidance as to 
whether price increases that are not the result of two companies conspiring together should be treated as an overt act."
161,3," See In re Cotton Yarn Antitrust Litig., 505 F.3d 274, 291 (4th Cir. 2007) (price-fixing conspiracy); Morton's Mkt., Inc. v.

161,4," The first case cited by Z Technologies that does not involve a conspiracy claim is Meijer, Inc. v. 3M, No. 04-5871, 2005 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 13995, 2005 WL 1660188 (E.D. Pa. July 13, 2005), but that case involved an attempt to maintain a monopoly by 
charging supra-competitive prices to suppress competition, not a merger acquisition resulting in a monopoly like in the present 
action. 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13995, [WL] at *4. The second case is Free FreeHand Corp. v. Adobe Systems Inc., 852 F. Supp. 
2d 1171 (N.D. Cal. 2012). There, contrary to Z Technologies's contention, the district court did not extend the statute of 
limitations solely on the basis of price. Instead, the district court determined that ceasing development of software, channeling 
existing customers to a different software, and bundling software constituted new post-merger  [**12] acts that extended the 
statute of limitations. Id. at 1187. These types of overt acts that the district court relied upon in Free FreeHand are absent in the 
present case."
161,5," See Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-68. "
163,6," Horizontal mergers occur when ""one firm acquires another firm that produces and sells an identical or similar product in the 
same geographic area, and thereby eliminates competition between the two firms."" 3 West's Fed. Admin. Prac. § 3067. 
""[U]nification of the merging firms' operations may create substantial market power and could enable the merged entity to raise 
prices by reducing output unilaterally."" Id. § 3068. "
164,7," Admittedly, there is dicta in Midwestern Machinery suggesting that the continuing violations doctrine should remain viable 
under the Sherman Act. But the Midwestern Machinery court also indicated that ""continuing violations restart the statute of 
limitations when there is an ongoing scheme, such as a price-fixing conspiracy or an attempt to monopolize."" 392 F.3d at 275. 
As this quote reveals, the Midwestern Machinery court believed that the continuing violations doctrine could be employed for 
claims of conspiracy or for maintaining a monopoly, but at no point did it expressly indicate that the continuing violations should 
be applicable to Sherman merger or acquisition claims. Id. This would have undercut the very logic that upheld the opinion. "

176,3, All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise specified. 
181,1, The motion is now pending before the district court judge for a final order. 
182,2," In his brief in support of  [*9] his motion for summary judgment and partial summary judgment, Defendant limits his arguments 
as to summary judgment on Plaintiff's claims to (1) the unenforceability of the SRA for lack of consideration for the restrictive 
covenants; (2) the unenforceability of the SRA as a result of Defendant's status as an independent contractor; (3) lack of 
meeting of the minds as to compensation; and (4) insufficient evidence for Plaintiff's UDTPA claim. In opposition to Defendant's 
motion, Plaintiff discusses other provisions of the SRA that Defendant allegedly breached, which were not included in 
Defendant's memorandum in support of granting summary judgment in his favor. Because the Court recommends denying in 
part Defendant's summary judgment motion, the Court will not address additional provisions in the contract that Defendant did 
not originally raise in his argument. "
184,3," To the extent Defendant's argument challenges the adequacy of consideration given, the Court will not evaluate such 
consideration. Hejl, 196 N.C. App. at 305, 674 S.E.2d at 429. ""The slightest consideration is sufficient to support the most 
onerous obligation, the inadequacy, . . . is for the parties to consider at the time of making the agreement, and not for the court 
when it is sought to be enforced."" Id. (quoting Machinery Co. v. Ins. Co., 13 N.C. App. 85, 90-91, 185 S.E.2d 308, 311-12 (1971) 
(internal quotation marks omitted)."
184,4," Furthermore, Defendant's argument that the contract is unenforceable as against public policy is disputed by Plaintiff. 
Defendant argues that Plaintiff gave up nothing and that he paid all of his expenses, used his own equipment, and that he was 
responsible for product development. (Def.'s Br. at 16.) In response, Plaintiff asserts that it created an entire infrastructure to 
assist Defendant (Hope Decl. ¶ 8), it paid some expenses for Defendant (Ex. 24, Docket Entry 75-24), and asserts that product 
development was not the one-man shown described by Defendant. (Cantrell Dep. at 21-22, Docket Entry 75-3.) At minimum, 
 [*17] a genuine issue is present precluding summary judgment in favor of Defendant on this issue. "
186,5," In any event, the Court notes that Defendant has not argued, nor does evidence illustrate ""antitrust injury"" or ""adverse impact"" 
as set out in Cole. See Cole, 496 F. Supp. 2d at 635 (""[Plaintiff] cannot show an adverse effect on competition by merely 
showing that he was unreasonably restrained from competing with [Defendant]."") "
188,6," To the extent Defendant argues ""restraint of trade,"" the Court notes Defendant's failure to prove antitrust injury or adverse 
impact set out in Cole. See Cole, 496 F. Supp. 2d at 634-36. "
190,1," The Court takes judicial notice of Edwards v. National Milk Producers Federation, No. 3:11-cv-04766-JSW (N.D. Cal)."
190,2," All references to pagination of specific documents pertain to those as indicated on the upper right corners via the CM/ECF 
electronic court docketing system."
190,3," Respondent objects that the service of the motion to compel was improper as it was served electronically and they have not 
appeared in this action. However, the Court notes that the motion to compel was also served by certified mail upon counsel for 
Respondent. (ECF No. 1 at 19.) Rule 5(b) provides for service upon a party's counsel by mailing the document. Counsel is 
admonished to refrain from bringing frivolous arguments that waste the time of the parties and the Court. "
191,4," While Petitioners argue that CDI was a member of the conspiracy from the beginning, CDI is not named as a party in the 
underlying lawsuit and for that reason they are a third party for the purposes of consideration of the motion to compel. "
194,5," Petitioners' expert states that Defendant DFA's share of the market in the west is 29%, which Petitioners concede is not 
inconsistent with CDI's assertion that the combined market share of Defendants DFA and LOL in California is 35%. (ECF No. 8 
at 10.)"
194,6," Since the Court is denying the motion to compel, it shall not address Respondent's argument that judicial estoppel bars 
Petitioners from asserting they require the information from CDI. "
197,1," The facts of the case and background information related to the parties' prior business relationship have been recounted at 
length in previous orders and will not be repeated here except as necessary to explain the Court's ruling. "
200,2," See Bloom v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 734 F. Supp. 1553, 1560 (C.D. Cal. 1990) (""In essence, § 17200 is a statutory tort 
the contours of which are similar to the common law tort of unfair competition.""); Brocade Communs. Sys. v. A10 Networks, Inc., 
873 F. Supp. 2d 1192, 1217 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (""It does appear that trade secret misappropriation is considered an intentional tort 
. . .""). "
205,3," A'lor also argues that its UCL claim can be based on Counterdefendants' interference with A'lor's prospective economic 
advantage. However, A'lor does not cite any authority which permits interference with prospective advantage to be the predicate 
act for a UCL claim. Moreover, A'lor's TACC does not include a separate cause of action for interference with prospective 
advantage. "
206,4," The Court notes that in ruling on a motion to dismiss, it may consider documents outside the pleadings without the proceeding 
turning into summary judgment. See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688-89 (9th Cir. 2001). In particular, the Court 
may consider: (a) documents that are ""properly submitted as part of the complaint""; (b) documents on which plaintiff's complaint 
necessarily relies and whose authenticity is not contested; and (c) ""matters of public record"" of which the court may take judicial 
notice under Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. See id. (internal quotations omitted). Here, A'lor's counterclaims 
necessarily rely on the two letters sent by Counterdefendants to A'lor's customers. Moreover, A'lor attaches the letters to its 
response in opposition to Counterdefendants' motion to dismiss. "
209,1," Here, the Court only recounts what Plaintiffs have alleged Indian law to be. The Indian regulatory statutes, while asserted in the 
Complaint to underlie the ""Licensing Agreement"" imposing obligations on VoIP companies, have not been provided to the Court 
in their original form. The Court declines to take judicial notice of the foreign laws without evidence of their actual text or other 
support. Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. v. Ziegler, 151 F.2d 784, 793 (3d Cir. 1945) (""The state of foreign law or the effect or 
operation of foreign law is a matter of fact and requires proof.""). See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1."
209,2," Plaintiff TI Investment Services is a limited liability company and special purpose vehicle formed in the United States to fund 
World Phone and is now World Phone's majority shareholder. "
210,3," As explained, infra, while categorizing their filing as a monopolization claim, Plaintiffs actually admit that even if all compliant 
companies were driven from the market, other noncompliant competitors to Microsoft would remain in the Indian VoIP market. 
[Complaint, ¶ 49]."
210,4," Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2. Section 2 sanctions those ""who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or 
conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several states,  [**8] or 
with foreign nations."" ""The offense of monopoly under § 2 of the Sherman Act has two elements: (1) the possession of monopoly 
power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or 
development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident."" Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen 
Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 596 n. 19, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985) (quoting United States v. Grinnell 
Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-71, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966)). See also Ideal Dairy Farms, Inc. v. John Labatt, Ltd., 90 
F.3d 737, 749 (3d Cir. 1996) (same). "
211,5," Plaintiffs also allege that this Court has diversity jurisdiction, but fail to adequately plead the citizenship of the parties to 
establish diversity. Partnerships and other unincorporated associations, including LLCs, are ""not considered 'citizens' as that 
term is used in the diversity statute."" Swiger v. Allegheny Energy, Inc., 540 F.3d 179 (3d Cir. 2008) (citing Carden v. Arkoma 
Assocs., 494 U.S. 185, 187-92, 110 S. Ct. 1015, 108 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1990)).  [**12] Instead, ""the citizenship of a limited liability 
company 'is determined by the citizenship of each of its members.'"" Johnson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 724 F.3d 337, 348 
(3d Cir. 2013) (quoting Zambelli Fireworks Mfg. Co. v. Wood, 592 F.3d 412, 418 (3d Cir. 2010)). Accordingly, in the context of 
LLCs ""the complete diversity requirement demands that all [members of the LLC] be diverse from all parties on the opposing 
side."" Swiger, 540 F.3d at 183. The citizenship of Plaintiff TI Investment Services, LLC has not been properly alleged for 
diversity purposes — the domiciles of its members have not been identified. However, as the court has independent, original 
jurisdiction over the subject matter because of the question of federal law presented in this case, the deficiency of Plaintiffs' 
citizenship allegations is not dispositive."
211,6," Plaintiffs also allege that TI provides management consulting services to World Phone and, prior to 2008, provided server-
related services to World Phone. As explained in more detail, infra, the former contention is not relevant to antitrust standing "
212,," [**15] because it confirms TI's role as a firm doing business (management consulting) that is not in the market in which injury is 
alleged to have occured (VoIP services). The latter contention only addresses involvement from TI prior to 2008 — a period 
before the alleged injuries were suffered."
212,7," The Supreme Court established the factors to be considered in evaluating standing in the antitrust context in Associated Gen. 
Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983). The Third 
Circuit has interpreted these factors as a multifactor balancing test: (1) the causal connection between the antitrust violation and the harm to the plaintiff and the intent by the defendant to 
cause that harm, with neither factor alone conferring standing; (2) whether the plaintiff's alleged injury is of the type for 
which the antitrust laws were intended to provide redress; (3) the directness of the injury, which addresses the concerns 
that liberal application of standing principles might produce speculative claims; (4) the existence of more direct victims of 
the alleged antitrust violations; and (5) the potential for duplicative recovery or complex apportionment of damages. "
213,," Ethypharm S.A. France v. Abbott Labs., 707 F.3d 223, 232-33 (3d Cir. 2013) (quoting In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust 
Litig., 998 F.2d 1144, 1165-66 (3d Cir. 1993)). The second factor, antitrust injury,  [**19] ""is a necessary but insufficient condition 
of antitrust standing."" Barton & Pittinos, Inc. v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 118 F.3d 178, 182 (3d Cir. 1997). If it is lacking, a 
court need not address the remaining Associated General factors. Ethypharm, 707 F.3d at 233."
213,8," Brunswick indeed sets bounds as to what qualifies as antitrust injury. For plaintiffs to prevail on a Sherman Act claim, they must prove more than injury causally linked to an illegal presence in the market. Plaintiffs must prove antitrust injury, 
which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes 
defendants' acts unlawful. The injury should reflect the anticompetitive effect either of the violation or of anticompetitive acts 
made possible by the violation. It should, in short, be ""the type of loss that the claimed violations . . . would be likely to 
cause."""
213,429," U.S. at 489 (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, 395 U.S., at 125)."
213,9," As a threshold matter, Defendant argues that World Phone's alleged injuries are not of the type the antitrust laws were 
intended to prevent. [Defendant's Brief in Support, I(A), p. 4-5 (citing Brunswick)]. Specifically, Defendant argues that, according 
to the Complaint, Defendant's alleged anticompetitive conduct of failing to comply with Indian regulatory statutes has actually 
lowered prices in the market for VoIP services between the United States and India. Accordingly, consumers have benefitted 
from the violation as alleged, and the US-India market for VoIP services enjoys more price competition, not less. Defendant cites 
Brunswick in support of this argument. [Defendant's Brief in Support, I(A), p. 4]. The Court finds that Defendant is only partially 
right: while competitors who have lost revenue as a result of increased price competition are normally unable  [**22] to allege an 
antitrust injury, there are limited circumstances in which such a competitor may nevertheless have a cause of action under the 
Sherman Act. The short-term effect of certain anticompetitive behavior[,] predatory below-cost pricing . . . for example[,] may be to 
stimulate price competition. But competitors may be able to prove antitrust injury before they actually are driven from the 
market and competition is thereby lessened. Brunswick Corp., 429 U.S. at 489 n. 14. This language in Brunswick is consistent with the structure of the Sherman Act itself. It 
gives effect to the plain terms of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which provides a cause of action both for monopolization, and 
attempted monopolization. See 15 U.S.C. § 2 (making it illegal for any person to ""monopolize, or attempt to monopolize . . . any 
part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations""). Thus Brunswick does not stand for the "
214,," proposition that antitrust injury can never be alleged when consumers in the relevant market experience lower costs. Instead, it 
leaves open the possibility that Plaintiff may plead a cause of action for antitrust injury arising from Defendant's in-progress 
 [**23] attempt to monopolize the relevant market through predatory pricing, rather than waiting until Defendant has already 
succeeded in monopolizing the relevant market."
214,10," See Complaint, ¶ 48 (""In other words, this case is not merely about cutting prices — it is also about Defendant Microsoft 
unlawfully disregarding a regulatory scheme meant to protect consumers within the Relevant Market.""). "
215,11," ""The lesson of the predatory pricing case law is that, generally, above-cost prices are not anticompetitive, and although there 
may be rare cases where above-cost prices are anticompetitive in the long run, it is beyond the practical ability of courts 
 [**27] to identify those rare cases without creating an impermissibly high risk of deterring legitimate procompetitive behavior 
(i.e., price-cutting)."" ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 274-75 (internal citations omitted). "
216,12," To the extent that Plaintiffs' allegations of a violation of Indian regulatory law are not supported by other factual assertions, 
they are mere conclusions of law, not binding upon the Court at the motion to dismiss stage. See Gage v. Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., AS, 13-3297, 555 Fed. Appx. 148, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 1042, 2014 WL 169654 (3d Cir. Jan. 16, 2014) [**32]  (""'[T]he 
tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.' 
Therefore, 'a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that, because they are no more 
than conclusions, are not entitled to the assumption of truth.'"") (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679). "
217,13," The deficiency of Plaintiffs' conspiracy claim is discussed in Section VIII, infra. "
218,14," As a threshold matter, the Third Circuit has held ""that the FTAIA constitutes a substantive merits limitation rather than a 
jurisdictional limitation,"" so Defendant's challenge  [**41] is appropriately brought, and the standard of Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) 
applies. Animal Sci, 654 F.3d at 467-68. "
221,15," In fact, the allegations in the Complaint, other than the mere assertion that a conspiracy exists, seem to indicate the Plaintiff is 
specifically alleging only parallel conduct. See Complaint, ¶ 50 (""Although there are other firms competing in the Relevant 
Market who have tacitly conspired with Defendant to also not comply with Indian law, the injury sustained by the competitive 
process is greatest as a result of Defendant Microsoft's conduct because of its attempted monopolistic position within the 
Relevant Market. Defendant Microsoft's 'stamp of approval' regarding non-compliance with Indian regulatory law has likely 
emboldened other smaller players to continue with their violations.""). "
237,1," Relatedly, the following facts focus more on S&P than Moody's, which is a party to only one of the cases before the Court. In 
any event, to the extent there are differences between the two rating agencies, those differences are irrelevant to the issues 
discussed in this Opinion."
237,2," John Moody, who gave his name to Moody's, was the first person to publish credit ratings publicly. See S. Rep. No. 109-326, at 
3 (2005) (Conf. Rep.); see generally John Moody, Moody's Analyses of Railroad Investments (1909). Moody sought to provide 
""analytical commentary on the railroads of America from the standpoint of the owners of the securities,"" and his ratings 
purported to be ""worked out on thoroughly sound and scientific lines.""  [**18] Id. at 14. "
238,3," The NRSRO designation was introduced in 1975 as part of the administrative scheme implementing the Net Capital Rule, 
which governs the amount of capital broker-dealers are required to maintain on their balance sheets. See S. Rep. No. 109-326, 
at 4; see also Net Capital Rule, 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c3-1 (2008); Adoption of Uniform Net Capital Rule and an Alternative Net 
Capital Requirement for Certain Brokers and Dealers, 40 Fed. Reg. 29795 (July 16, 1975). Under that scheme, broker-
dealers are required to hold less capital against assets that have been rated investment-grade by one of the NRSROs than 
against those that have not. See S. Rep. No. 109-326, at 4. In other words, the NRSRO designation was originally intended to 
ensure the reliability of credit ratings for the largely unrelated purpose of federal banking regulation. "
239,4," Elsewhere, the regulations prohibit certain conflicts of interest altogether. See, e.g., 17 C.F.R. § 240.17g-5(c). Additionally, the 
SEC has authority to revoke NRSRO status or to impose civil penalties. See 15 U.S.C. § 78o-7(d); 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(a)(1)(C)."
239,5," Unless indicated otherwise, citations to docket entries refer to docket entries in the MDL, 13 MD 2446. "
240,6," In addition to those seventeen actions, S&P and Moody's are currently facing civil enforcement actions brought by the federal 
government, California, Connecticut, and Illinois. The federal suit against S&P is currently pending in the United States District 
Court for the Central District of California. See United States v. McGraw-Hill Cos., No. CV 13-0779 DOC (JCGx) (C.D. Cal.). The 
suits brought by California, Connecticut, and Illinois are pending in their respective state courts, as S&P elected not to remove 
the California action and the other two, which S&P did remove, were remanded to state court prior to the MDL's creation. See 
Illinois v. McGraw-Hill Cos., No. 13 C 1725, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63315, 2013 WL 1874279 (N.D. Ill. May 2, 2013); 
Connecticut v. McGraw-Hill Cos., No. 3:13-cv-311 (SRU), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58528, 2013 WL 1759864 (D. Conn. Apr. 24, 
2013); Connecticut v. Moody's Corp., No. 3:10cv546 (JBA), 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 780, 2011 WL 63905 (D. Conn. Jan. 5, 2011); 
see also, e.g., Connecticut v. Moody's Corp., 664 F. Supp. 2d 196 (D. Conn. 2009) (remanding to state court an earlier civil 
enforcement action brought against Moody's); Flynn ex rel. Moody's Corp. v. McDaniel, 689 F. Supp. 2d 686, 687 (S.D.N.Y. 
2010)  [**30] (remanding to state court a derivative suit alleging that Moody's committed fraud and breached its fiduciary duties 
in connection with its use of the issuer-pays model). "
241,7," The JPML granted S&P's motion to transfer the cases to a single court, over the objections of the States and Moody's, in part 
to allow one court to address all of the motions to remand and motions to dismiss, thereby eliminating the risk of inconsistent 
rulings. (Transfer Order 2-3)."
241,8," Although the District of Columbia has not moved for remand (see Docket, 13 Civ. 4012), there is no dispute that, if the Court 
lacks subject-matter jurisdiction with respect to the States' civil enforcement  [**35] actions, its case would need to remanded as 
well. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) (HN6[
] ""If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject 
matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded."")."
241,9," HN7[
] When an action is transferred pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section 1407, as all of the instant cases were, the transferee court applies ""its interpretations of federal law, not the constructions of federal law of the transferor circuit."" 
Menowitz v. Brown, 991 F.2d 36, 40 (2d Cir. 1993). Accordingly, as the parties agree, Second Circuit law applies to these 
motions. "
242,10," As noted, S&P and Moody's did not invoke federal-question jurisdiction in the initial notice of removal that they filed in the 
Mississippi case; S&P did so in the supplemental notice of removal filed in 2013. Moody's did not join in that supplemental notice 
of removal (Notice of Supplemental Authority (Docket No. 34, 13 Civ. 4049)), and therefore does not join S&P's arguments with 
respect to the propriety of federal-question jurisdiction. "
243,11," Another application of the ""artful pleading rule"" is the complete preemption doctrine, pursuant to which removal is proper when 
Congress has ""so completely preempted, or entirely substituted, a federal law cause of action for a state one."" Romano, 609 
F.3d at 519; see also Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 393, 107 S. Ct. 2425, 96 L. Ed. 2d 318 (1987).  [**41] S&P 
concedes that the complete preemption doctrine does not apply here (see Defs.' Mem. Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Remand and Costs 
(Docket No. 30, 13 Civ. 4098) 3) and relies solely on the substantial federal question doctrine enunciated in Grable. S&P's 
concession is probably wise, if only because Congress expressly preserved the right of States to bring civil enforcement actions 
against NRSROs ""with respect to fraud or deceit."" 15 U.S.C. § 78o-7(o)(2). "
245,12," This conclusion is underscored by the fact that S&P's Code of Conduct predates CRARA. See supra Background, Section B. "
246,13," Notably, the language of Illinois's statute, which the McGraw-Hill Cos. Court construed to provide only a defense, is virtually 
identical to the language of statutes from other States in this MDL. Compare 815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 505/10b(1) (""Nothing in this Act 
shall apply to . . . [a]ctions or transactions specifically authorized by laws administered by any regulatory body or officer acting 
under statutory authority of . . . the United States.""), with, e.g., Ark. Code Ann. § 4-88-101(3) (""This chapter does not apply to . . . 
[a]ctions or transactions permitted under laws administered by . . . [a] regulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority "
247,," of this state or the United States . . . .""); Idaho Code Ann. § 48-605(1) (""Nothing in this act shall apply to . . . [a]ctions or 
transactions permitted under laws administered by . . . [a] regulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority of . . . the 
United States.""); S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-40(a)  [**57] (""Nothing in this article shall apply to . . . [a]ctions or transactions permitted 
under laws administered by any regulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority of . . . the United States . . . ."")."
247,14," Despite some ambiguity in their Notice of Removal, S&P and Moody's have abandoned any argument that they removed the 
case as a ""class action"" rather than as a ""mass action."" (See Mem. Law Opp'n Mississippi's Mots. To Remand and Costs and "
248,," Fees (Docket No. 35) (""Defs.' Remand Mem."") 17-19). That is for good reason, as CAFA defines a ""class action"" as a civil action 
""filed under"" a state-law equivalent to Rule 23, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(1)(B) (emphasis added), and Mississippi has no class action 
procedure whatsoever, see Am. Bankers Ins. Co. v. Booth, 830 So. 2d 1205, 1212-14 (Miss. 2002).  [**62] See generally 
Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp., 701 F.3d 796, 799 (5th Cir. 2012), rev'd and remanded on other grounds by 
Hood, 134 S. Ct. 736, 187 L. Ed. 2d 654 (2014)."
248,15," In light of that conclusion, the Court need not reach Mississippi's argument that the 2011 notice of removal was defective. 
(Mem. Law Supp. State Mississippi's Mots. To Remand and Costs and Fees (Docket No. 27) (""Miss. Mem."") 7-9). In light of the 
Court's conclusion with respect to federal-question jurisdiction, there is also no need to address Mississippi's argument that 
S&P's supplemental notice of removal was untimely. (Id. at 25-28). "
250,16," Some courts have concluded that the whole-complaint approach is warranted in part because of ""the Supreme Court's caution 
that restraint is particularly important in the removal context in light of the longstanding policy of strictly construing the statutory 
procedures for removal, as well as the sovereignty concerns raised by asserting federal jurisdiction over cases brought by states 
in their own courts."" Bristol Myers Squibb, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24026, 2014 WL 793569, at *4 (citation omitted); accord LG 
Display, 665 F.3d at 774; MyInfoGuard, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161070, 2012 WL 5469913, at *5; Charles Schwab, 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 5830, 2010 WL 286629, at *5. In the Court's view, however, while deference to the state's choice of forum should be 
a factor in applying the proper test to a particular set of facts — with all doubts resolved in the state's favor, see, e.g., Purdue 
Pharma, 704 F.3d at 213 — it should not be a factor in choosing which test to apply in the first instance. That is, the question of 
whether to apply the whole-complaint approach or the claim-by-claim approach should not turn on (or even be affected by) 
whether a State filed suit in state court  [**72] or federal court. "
251,17," S&P and Moody's also cite the original Complaint's requests for punitive damages and ""damages"" in the disgorgement count. 
(Defs.' Remand Mem. 9 n.5). The State argues that those requests should be disregarded as a scrivener's error and notes that 
both requests were  [**79] removed from the Amended Complaint filed after the case was removed. (Miss. Mem. 13 n.9; Reply 
Mem. Law Supp. State of Mississippi's Mots. Remand and Costs and Fees (Docket No. 38) 6). See Connecticut v. Moody's 
Corp., 664 F. Supp. 2d 196, 198 (D. Conn. 2009) (disregarding a request for punitive damages in similar circumstances as a 
scrivener's error). In either case, however, the Complaint did not seek punitive damages on behalf of consumers. And the 
request for damages referred expressly to damages ""for the harms intentionally and wrongfully done to the State."" (Miss. Compl. 
¶ 87 (emphasis added)). "
252,18," The Northern District of Mississippi's decision in Bristol-Myers Squibb, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90540, 2013 WL 3280267, upon 
which S&P and Moody's rely (Defs.' Remand Mem. 11), does not call for a different result. The Court in that case did find that 
Mississippi consumers were the real parties in interest for purposes of the State's disgorgement claim, but that was based in part 
on language in the complaint indicating that ""the injury complained of was suffered by the user or purchaser consumer"" and that 
the purpose of the relief was to make those consumers (and the State) ""whole."" 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90540, 2013 WL 
3280267, at *6 (quoting  [**80] from the complaint). The Complaint in this case does not include the same (or similar) language. 
Moreover, there is another reason not to follow Bristol-Myers Squibb: Although it did not address the issue expressly, the Court 
applied the claim-by-claim approach rather than the whole-complaint approach."
252,19," In light of the foregoing, a strong argument could be made that, even under the claim-by-claim approach, Mississippi would be 
the sole real party in interest. See, e.g., South Carolina v. LG Display Co., Ltd., No. 3:11-cv-00729-JFA, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
104216, 2011 WL 4344074, at *6 (D.S.C. Sept. 14, 2011) (stating that the state would be a real party in interest to its restitution 
claim even under a claim-by-claim approach because the state has a ""a quasi-sovereign interest . . . in bringing an action to 
enforce its laws, disgorge the proceeds of ill-gotten gains, and refund them to its citizens""); South Carolina v. AU Optronics 
Corp., No. 3:11-cv-00731-JFA, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104213, 2011 WL 4344079, at *6 (D.S.C. Sept. 14, 2011) (same); Illinois 
v. AU Optronics Corp., 794 F. Supp. 2d 845, 855 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (holding that the state would be the real party in interest with 
respect to its claim for restitution even under the claim-by-claim  [**81] approach because it ""has a quasi-sovereign interest"" in 
""seek[ing] recovery on behalf of a wide range of consumers and aim[ing] to deter future antitrust conduct by corporations in [the 
state]""). The Court, however, need not reach that question. "
253,20," As a threshold matter, there is some reason to question whether the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over S&P's 
Declaratory Judgment Cases insofar as they allege claims that, if S&P had been sued in federal court, could be raised only as 
defenses. See, e.g., Fleet Bank, Nat'l Ass'n v. Burke, 160 F.3d 883, 887-88 (2d Cir. 1998); Transatlantic Marine Claims Agency, 
Inc. v. Ace Shipping Corp., 109 F.3d 105, 107-08 (2d Cir. 1997). However, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Verizon 
Maryland Inc. v. Public Service Commission, 535 U.S. 635, 122 S. Ct. 1753, 152 L. Ed. 2d 871 (2002), which held that HN31[
] declaratory-judgment actions premised on the Supremacy Clause and seeking injunctive relief are properly within the subject-
matter  [**87] jurisdiction of federal courts, the Court concludes that it has federal-question jurisdiction to consider these cases. 
See also, e.g., Sprint Commc'ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 134 S. Ct. 584, 590, 187 L. Ed. 2d 505 (2013). "
254,21," Even if these three conditions are met, ""a federal court may still intervene in state proceedings if the plaintiff demonstrates bad 
faith, harassment or any other unusual circumstance that would call for equitable relief."" Spargo, 351 F.3d at 75 n.11 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). S&P does not allege that any of those exceptions apply here."
254,22," In light of that conclusion, the Court need not reach the States' alternative argument that the Declaratory Judgment 
 [**90] Cases should be dismissed as ""improper anticipatory filings undertaken as a race to the courthouse."" (Defs.' Joint Br. 
Supp. Mots. To Dismiss 6). "
255,23," In the face of these cases, S&P relies heavily on Harper v. Public Service Commission, 396 F.3d 348 (4th Cir. 2005), in which 
the Fourth  [**93] Circuit opined that Younger abstention is appropriate only where the pending state proceeding implicates 
""[i]nterests like education, land use law, family law, and criminal law [that] lie at the heart of state sovereignty."" Id. at 354; see 
also id. at 352-53. As S&P concedes, however, Harper is not controlling here. (Mem. Law Opp'n Defs.' Mots. To Dismiss 17 
n.12). Moreover, the Fourth Circuit's list was illustrative, not exhaustive, and the cases cited above stand for the proposition that 
the interest in enforcing state laws prohibiting deceptive business practices also lies at the heart of state sovereignty. "

268,2," Lotes never effected service on Foxconn Kunshan under the Hague Convention, and Foxconn Kunshan has not entered an 
appearance, either below or on appeal. "
272,3," The defendants contend that we may avoid deciding this question because the district court correctly dismissed Lotes's 
antitrust claims under the FTAIA, and nothing turns on whether or not that dismissal was properly jurisdictional. But HN6[
] 
jurisdiction is an issue distinct from and logically prior to the merits of a claim, and the Supreme Court has held that ""the 
nonexistence of a cause of action [i]s no proper basis for a jurisdictional dismissal."" Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 
U.S. 83, 96, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 140 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1998) (discussing Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682, 66 S. Ct. 773, 90 L. Ed. 939 
(1946)). Furthermore, this uncertainty in our jurisprudence  [**22] has been flagged by several district courts, see, e.g., In re 
Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 904 F. Supp. 2d 310, 315 (E.D.N.Y. 2012); Boyd v. AWB Ltd., 544 F. Supp. 2d 236, 243 n.6 (S.D.N.Y. 
2008), and we see no good reason to allow it to persist. See Morrison v. Nat'l Austl. Bank Ltd.., 561 U.S. 247, 254, 130 S. Ct. 
2869, 177 L. Ed. 2d 535 (2010) (holding that the lower courts erred in finding that the question of the extraterritorial reach of § 
10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 was jurisdictional, even though ""nothing in the analysis of the courts below 
turned on th[is] mistake"")."
272,4, The FTAIA is also codified in similar language in section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. See 15 U.S.C. § 45(a)(3). 
274,5," Compare, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 97-686, at 13 (1982) (explaining  [**30] that the statute ""address[es] only the subject matter 
jurisdiction of United States antitrust law,"" rather than ""the legal standards for determining whether conduct violates the antitrust 
laws""), with id. at 7 (explaining that the statute amends the Sherman Act ""to more clearly establish when antitrust liability 
attaches to international business activities"" (emphasis added)), and id. at 7-8 (explaining that the statute clarifies when 
""restraints on export trade . . . violate the Sherman Act"" (emphasis added)). "
277,6," We recognize that Webster's Third has not garnered universal respect among the Justices of the Supreme Court. See, e.g., 
Taniguchi v. Kan Pac. Saipan, Ltd., 132 S. Ct. 1997, 2003, 182 L. Ed. 2d 903 (2012); MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. AT&T Co.., 512 
U.S. 218, 228 n.3, 114 S. Ct. 2223, 129 L. Ed. 2d 182 (1994). But other dictionaries published roughly contemporaneously with 
the enactment of the FTAIA contain similar definitions. See, e.g., 4 Oxford English  [**40] Dictionary 702 (2d ed. 1989) (defining 
""direct"" as, among other things, ""[s]traight; undeviating in course; not circuitous or crooked"" and ""[p]roceeding from antecedent to 
consequent, from cause to effect, etc.; uninterrupted, immediate""). "
279,7," We recognize that in Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), the Supreme Court held 
that indirect purchasers may not recover treble damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act. See id. at 728-29. But in so holding, the 
Court in no way implied that anticompetitive injuries cannot be passed through to subsequent purchasers; to the contrary, the 
Court acknowledged that its rule ""denies recovery to those indirect purchasers who may have been actually injured by antitrust 
violations."" Id. at 746. Instead, the Court relied upon on practical considerations related to double recovery, apportionment, and 
deterrence. See id. at 730, 735, 737. The indirect purchaser doctrine, moreover, is subject to exceptions, see Simon v. KeySpan 
Corp., 694 F.3d 196, 202 (2d Cir. 2012), does not preempt state laws providing for damages claims by indirect purchasers, see 
ARC Am., 490 U.S. at 102, and does not apply to claims for equitable relief, see In re Air Cargo Shipping Servs. Antitrust Litig., 
697 F.3d 154, 157 (2d Cir. 2012); see also U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Ind. Gas Co., 350 F.3d 623, 627 (7th Cir. 2003). Furthermore, 
 [**48] this Court has not had occasion to consider the extent to which Illinois Brick applies when any direct purchaser claim 
would be barred by the FTAIA. But see Motorola Mobility LLC v. AU Optronics Corp., 746 F.3d 842, 844 (7th Cir. 2014) 
(indicating that Illinois Brick would continue to apply). "
281,8," To the extent Lotes intends to frame the defendants' failure to license U.S. patents as the basis of a separate claim based on 
purely domestic conduct, which would not be subject to the limitations of the FTAIA, such a claim would fail for the same 
reasons. HN31[

284,1, This appeal concerns Carnival's attempt to be classified as a member of the U.K. Settlement Class only. 
285,2," The district court's jurisdiction over the underlying antitrust action was premised on federal question jurisdiction. See 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1331. When the parties entered into the Settlement Agreements,  [**7] the district court incorporated the terms of those 
agreements into its dismissal order and also retained jurisdiction over the enforcement of those agreements. The district court, 
therefore, had jurisdiction over Carnival's enforcement action. See Alvarado v. Table Mountain Rancheria, 509 F.3d 1008, 1017 
(9th Cir. 2007) . This court has jurisdiction over the district court's denial of enforcement pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 because the district court's 
order denying enforcement ended the litigation between Carnival, as plaintiff, and BA and VAA, as defendants, on the merits. 
See Klestadt & Winters, LLP v. Cangelosi, 672 F.3d 809, 813 (9th Cir. 2012) (explaining that HN1[
] ""[a] final decision is one 
that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment"" (internal quotation marks 
omitted)). "
286,3," Carnival suggests a slightly different definition of sell: ""'to transfer (goods) or render (services) for another in exchange for 
money.'"" Appellant's Br. 25 (quoting Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary 1739 (2d ed. 2001)). Carnival's definition 
does not change the analysis: The Airlines transferred the tickets to the customer, not to Carnival."
286,4," The Airlines seek to characterize the district court's determination that the tickets were sold to Carnival's customers, not 
Carnival, as a factual finding, which we review only for clear error. Carnival urges that this determination is a matter of contract 
interpretation, subject to de novo review. We need not decide whether this determination falls neatly into either category 
because, regardless of the standard applied, we believe the district court's conclusion is the correct one."
286,5," Section 10.1 of Carnival's settlement agreement with BA states: ""In addition, because British Airways is potentially liable for 
treble damages under U.S. law, U.S. Settlement Class Members will be entitled to receive an additional payment per Qualifying 
Coupon of the pro rata share per Qualifying Coupon of $1 million (an 'Additional Payment')."" ER 127. "

289,2, Apple also asserts that DNAML is  [**8] barred from seeking recovery for any lost foreign sales. DNAML agrees. 
290,3," DNAML's complaint identified a second anticompetitive practice which it alleged harmed it. This was Apple's 2011 revision of its 
App Store Policies. DNAML did not plead facts to permit an inference, however, that Apple's unilateral revision to its App Store 
Policies constituted a violation of the antitrust laws. In opposition to this motion, DNAML has abandoned its claim that Apple's 
2011 revision to its App Store Policies violated  [**11] the law."

301,2," Apple contended that eight other civil penalty claims, which the States at that time pressed but have since withdrawn, were 
predicated on provisions of law requiring proof of elements beyond those required under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. "
302,3," For the first time, however, Apple distinguishes two of the twenty-six claims: one brought by Connecticut and one brought by 
Virginia. These two claims are discussed below."
302,4," In a footnote in its September 20 Submission, Apple compared the claims for relief in the SAC and the States' September 20 
Submission. Apple argued that the States had impermissibly changed three civil penalty claims. Apple points to Alaska's request 
for penalties under the Alaska Restraint of Trade Act, Alaska Stat. § 45.50.551(b), which did not appear in the States' Prayer for 
Relief in the SAC; Vermont's request under the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act, under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9 § 2458(b)(1), which was 
mistakenly listed in the SAC as Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9 § 2461;  [*15] and Nebraska's request for $25,000 under the Nebraska 
Consumer Protection Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. § 59-1614, which was revised upward to the statutory maximum from the $2,000 
request listed in the SAC due to a typographical error. Apple appears to have abandoned its argument regarding these three 
claims. In any event, the States may obtain any relief to which they are entitled, so long as Apple had adequate notice. Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 54(c); Powell v. Nat'l Bd. Of Med. Exam'rs, 364 F.3d 79, 86 (2d Cir. 2004). Count IV of the States' SAC alleged that Apple 
violated Alaska's Restraint of Trade Act, Vermont's Consumer Fraud Act, and the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act, thus 
providing Apple with adequate notice of those claims. The States may amend their complaint before the damages trial to correct 
any typographical errors. "
303,5," Apple does not argue that a civil penalty cannot be imposed under the VAA on the theory that the treble-damages component 
of the Clayton Act constitutes a ""fine or penalty."" This may be because the Supreme Court has explained that the Clayton Act is 
primarily remedial, rather than punitive in nature. See PacifiCare Health Sys., Inc. v. Book, 538 U.S. 401, 405-06, 123 S. Ct. 
1531, 155 L. Ed. 2d 578 (2003). "
304,6," While Apple's September 20 Submission urged that the Court award any state civil penalties as a portion of Clayton Act treble 
damages, the States' September 20 Submission did not address that issue. Since that time, the States and Apple have briefed 
their opposing views on this issue. "
306,7," The Eighth Amendment provides that ""Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual 
punishments inflicted."" U.S. CONST. amend. VIII. A ""fine"" under the Excessive Fines Clause is a ""payment to a sovereign as 
punishment for some offense."" United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 327, 118 S. Ct. 2028, 141 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1998) 
(citation omitted). "
307,8," This Opinion addresses Apple's argument that any imposition of civil penalties would violate the Eighth and Fourteenth 
Amendments. The precise amount of civil penalties will be imposed following the damages trial. "
315,1," Except as otherwise indicated, these are the facts laid out in the Complaint. In considering this motion to dismiss, I take as true 
all well-pleaded factual allegations and afford Plaintiff the benefit of all reasonable inferences. Butler v. Balolia, 736 F.3d 609, 
612 (1st Cir. 2013)."
315,2," Because this website is part of the public record and does not contradict the Complaint, it may be considered by the Court in 
deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 268 n.1, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209 
(1986); Giragosian v. Ryan, 547 F.3d 59, 65 (1st Cir. 2008); In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 2003). "
316,3," This Court may consider regulations  [*6] from the Code of Federal Regulations without converting a motion to dismiss to a 
motion for summary judgment. United States v. Fink, 393 F. Supp. 2d 935, 939 (D.S.D. 2005); see Greene v. Rhode Island, 398 
F.3d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir. 2005) (federal statutes are matters of public record of which court can take judicial notice without 
converting motion to dismiss into motion for summary judgment); Demick v. City of Joliet, 108 F. Supp. 2d 1022, 1025 (N.D. Ill. 
2000) (rules and regulations are matters of public record of which court can take judicial notice without converting motion to 
dismiss into motion for summary judgment)."
316,4," Yagoozon quotes from what purport to be customer testimonials on the Kids Fly Safe website in its Objection to Defendants' 
Motion to Dismiss. ECF No. 14-1 at 8-10. Dr. Jennings says that he reviewed ""many product testimonials reported on the Kids 
Fly Safe website and elsewhere,"" but provides no detail as to what he considered. Jennings Aff. ¶ 10. The Court assumes that 
the material on which Dr. Jennings relied is the same as that quoted in Yagoozon's brief. "
318,5," This transcription was informally prepared from the recording of the hearing on this motion held on April 16, 2014. It is at 
10:37:55 a m. to 10:38:46 a m. "
319,6," The Complaint pleads that Kids Fly Safe refused Yagoozon's first request to place an order, excusing its refusal based on an 
exclusive distribution arrangement affecting sales through Amazon.com. When Yagoozon tried again, offering to resell at its 
Florida store and not on Amazon.com, Kids Fly Safe simply failed to respond. This amounts to a refusal to deal. "
320,7," An exclusive distributorship is an arrangement that provides a distributor with the right to be the sole outlet for a manufacturer's 
products in a given territory, here the on-line retail website operated by Amazon.com. ABA Section of Antitrust Law, I Antitrust 
Law Developments 161 (7th ed. 2012). "
321,8," I note that this analysis of the viability of Yagoozon's Complaint does not consider the sufficiency of the Complaint's relevant 
market allegations because I have excluded and must avoid reliance on the Jennings Affidavit and the website testimonials. 
 [*29] Put differently, whether the relevant market is the ""online market for FAA-certified aviation child safety harnesses,"" as the 
Complaint alleges and Dr. Jennings opines, or whether that market is implausible because the Complaint fails to consider 
substitutable car seats, as Defendants argue, Yagoozon has failed to state a claim because of the failure plausibly to plead 
actual or potential harm to competition. "
322,9," In effect, I am treating the Complaint as cured by the Jennings Affidavit, accepting its conclusions as true as if they were 
 [*31] part of the Complaint. See Peoples v. Bank of Am., 11-2863-STA, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22208, 2012 WL 601777, at *6

332,*, The Clerk of the Court is respectfully directed to amend the official caption in this case to appear as set forth above. 
335,1," In 2008, Teva acquired Barr Pharmaceuticals, which was the entity actually seeking approval to produce generic AXR in 2002. 
For the sake of simplicity, both the complaint and this opinion refer to those entities collectively as ""Teva."" See Compl. ¶ 3 n.1."
335,2," Shire, Teva, and Impax have already settled litigation arising from these contract disputes. See Stipulation of Dismissal, Teva 
Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Shire LLC, No. 09 Civ. 8860 (MGC) (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 2009), ECF No. 17; Stipulation  [**6] of Dismissal, 
Impax Labs., Inc. v. Shire LLC, No. 10 Civ. 8386 (MGC) (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2013), ECF No. 211. "
336,3," Shire also argued that LWD had failed to properly allege a ""relevant product market,"" and that LWD was an ""indirect purchaser"" 
not entitled to damages with respect to any purchases of AXR from Teva or Impax. The district court declined to address these 
arguments, and neither has been reiterated on appeal. "
338,4," HN4[
] We may, of course, affirm on any ground that finds support in the record sufficient to permit a conclusion of law, even 
one not relied on by the district court. See MLSMK Inv. Co. v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., 651 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2011). "
343,1, More detailed background information can be found in the court's prior opinions in the case. 
344,2," IPPs are Louisiana Health Service Indemnity Company d/b/a BlueCross BlueShield of Louisiana (""BCBSLA""), New Mexico 
United Food and Commercial Workers Union's and Employers' Health and Welfare Trust Fund (""NMUFCW""), Plumbers and 
Pipefitters Local Union Number 572 Health and Welfare Fund, Janet M. Paone, and Judith Carrasquillo. Summary judgment 
against NMUFCW was allowed on April 3, 2014, following IPPs' concession that NMUFCW had not suffered injury during the 
proposed damages period. See Docket ## 437 and 438."
344,3," IPPs have not previously sought partial certification of a class in this case. Thus, their motion for ""reconsideration"" is more 
accurately viewed as a request that the court exercise its ability to alter or amend the order denying class certification pursuant 
to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C). "
345,4," Neither party has addressed whether issue preclusion would apply if an issue class is not certified and the question of antitrust 
violation were adjudicated only as to the named indirect purchaser plaintiffs. While it appears that subsequent plaintiffs could 
possibly use a verdict against Astellas to prevent relitigation of the issue in future cases, the same would not be true for Astellas 
in the event it prevails here. See Gunnells v. Healthplan Services, Inc., 348 F.3d 417, 427 (4th Cir. 2003) (""[P]roceeding with 
individual claims makes the defendant vulnerable to the asymmetry of collateral estoppel: If [defendant] lost on a claim to an 
individual plaintiff, subsequent plaintiffs could use offensive collateral estoppel to prevent [defendant] from litigating the issue. A 
victory by [defendant] in an action by an individual plaintiff, however, would have no binding effect on future plaintiffs because 
the plaintiffs would not have been party to the original suit."") (internal citations omitted); Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 95, 101 
S. Ct. 411, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1980) (""[T]he concept of collateral estoppel cannot apply when the party against whom the earlier 
decision is asserted did not have a 'full and fair opportunity' to litigate that issue in the earlier case."") (citation omitted). [*10] ""Collateral estoppel thus is a double-edged sword for a defendant."" Coffin v. Bowater Inc., 228 F.R.D. 397 n.13 (D. Me. 2005). 
Class certification, in contrast, would provide Astellas with ""the benefit of finality and repose,"" Gunnells, 348 F.3d at 427, that 
issue preclusion cannot, since a victory in this action would apply consistently to all class members' claims grounded in antitrust 
conduct. "
346,5," Indeed, in previously denying class certification, I found that variability in important factors suggested that significant numbers 
of class members may not have been harmed, and that IPPs had failed to show that their impact methodology could 
demonstrate widespread harm to the class despite such [*15]  distinctions. See Docket # 350 at 42-43. This does not mean, 
however, that the class definition is deficient for standing purposes. "
347,6," Astellas argues that, to prevail on the issue of antitrust violation, IPPs must prove only that Astellas caused some delay in the 
market entry of generic tacrolimus, but the issue of an individual class member's injury would turn in part on a precise ""but-for"" 
market entry date for generic tacrolimus. Thus, Astellas claims that both juries (one in the trial on antitrust violation, another in 
the trial on antitrust impact and damages) would need to assess how Astellas's conduct may have impacted generic entry. But 
this ""overlap"" can be easily resolved by instructing the first jury to make a specific determination about when generic tacrolimus 
would have entered the market but for the antitrust conduct. The second jury could then, using that finding, evaluate a plaintiff's 
injury without having to reexamine Astellas's conduct and its effect on generic market entry. "
348,7," Plaintiffs also point out that Astellas previously subpoenaed and deposed Drs. Cronin, Klintmalm, and Abecassis as fact 
witnesses, and that plaintiffs therefore examined them as such under significant time restraints and without the disclosure of 
expected testimony. Moreover, at a March 14, 2013 hearing, in the context of a dispute between the parties on reimbursing fact 
witnesses, Astellas represented that Dr. Cronin is ""being deposed as a fact witness."" See Docket # 330, Ex. A at 44. "
349,8," Plaintiffs add that dosage differentiation was particularly a non-issue in the case of tacrolimus. Because Prograf [*26]  was 
already dose-differentiated, Sandoz's generic tacrolimus was always intended to be dose-differentiated as well, since FDA 
regulations required that labels for both brand and generic products be the same. "
350,9," The parties offer differing views on the standard of proof on this issue. Astellas, citing CVD, Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 769 F.2d 842, 
849-51 (1st Cir. 1985), claims that plaintiffs must prove that the citizen petition was objectively baseless by clear and convincing 
evidence. Plaintiffs retort that the CVD case is grounded in the unique standards of patent law, and that here, as in most civil 
litigation, the standard of proof is by a preponderance of the evidence. The Federal Circuit has not yet made explicit the standard 
of proof for showing objective baselessness under the sham exception to Noerr-Pennington. [*29]  See, e.g., Wellbutrin, 
1657734, 2012 WL 1657734 at *4-5 (discussing lack of clarity regarding standard). Nonetheless, it is unnecessary to resolve the 
question here, since I find plaintiffs' evidence sufficient to survive summary judgment under either standard. "
352,10," Plaintiffs generally object to Astellas's use of post-petition evidence to support its motion, arguing that only facts that existed at 
the time of the petition's filing are relevant. See Filmtec Corp. V. Hydranautics, 67 F.3d 931, 938 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (objective 
baselessness analysis ""requires an inquiry into the reasonableness of the antitrust defendant's litigation when filed.""). Astellas, 
however, notes that courts evaluating objective baselessness have considered scientific and regulatory events occurring after a 
filing that are consistent with the petition's requests. See, e.g., Louisiana Wholesale Drug Co. v. Sanofi-Aventis, No. 07 Civ. 
7343 (HB), 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3611, 2008 WL 169362, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2008) (subsequent FDA action 
consistent [*37]  with petition's request supported jury finding that the petition was not objectively baseless); In re Warfarin 
Sodium Antirust Litig., No. MDL 98-1232-SLR, 1998 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19555, 1998 WL 883469, *7 (D. Del. Dec. 7, 1998) 
(petition not objectively baseless where ""FDA later proposed to adopt the very bioequivalency standards recommended by 
defendant""), rev'd on other grounds, 214 F.3d 395 (3rd Cir. 2000). I will consider post-petition events to the limited extent that 
they may shed light on the objective reasonableness of Astellas's petition at the time it was filed."
352,11," Illinois has adopted, by statute, the Illinois Brick bar to antitrust class action claims by indirect purchasers. See 740 Ill. Comp. 
Stat. 10/7(2) (2010); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 735, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). Astellas asserts that 
Illinois law also precludes an indirect purchaser plaintiff from making an endrun around Illinois Brick and the statute by raising 
antitrust claims under a theory of unjust enrichment. See, e.g., In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 812 F. Supp. 2d 390, 413 "
353,," (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (dismissing indirect purchaser unjust enrichment claims brought under Illinois law); In re Flonase Antirust 
Litig., 692 F. Supp. 2d 524, 543 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (""Illinois has adopted the logic of Illinois Brick, and therefore Plaintiffs may not 
assert a claim for unjust enrichment under Illinois law.""). Astellas further argues that Illinois law does not allow claims for unjust 
enrichment to be brought without an independently viable underlying claim. See Martis v. Grinnell Mut. Reinsurance Co., 388 Ill. 
App. 3d 1017, 905 N.E.2d 920, 928, 329 Ill. Dec. 82 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009). Carrasquillo strongly disagrees. She contends that Illinois statutory law only prohibits antitrust class actions and does not 
preclude her from bringing an unjust enrichment claim as a class action. She also disputes that her unjust enrichment claim can 
simply be dismissed as an end-run around Illinois Brick. See In re G-Fees Antitrust Litig., 584 F. Supp. 2d 26, 46 (D.D.C. 2008) 
(""No reason or logic supports a conclusion that a state's adherence to the [*39]  rule of Illinois Brick dispossesses a person not 
only of a statutory legal remedy for an antitrust violation, but also dispossesses the same person of his right to pursue a common 
law equitable remedy.""). Finally, Carrasquillo asserts that Illinois law does provide a stand-alone claim for unjust enrichment and 
that the Illinois Supreme Court has repeatedly sustained unjust enrichment claims not founded on separate underlying claims. 
See Raintree Homes, Inc. v. Vill. of Long Grove, 209 Ill. 2d 248, 807 N.E.2d 439, 445, 282 Ill. Dec. 815 (Ill. 2004); Indep. Voters 
v. Ill. Commerce Comm'n, 117 Ill. 2d 90, 510 N.E.2d 850, 856-58, 109 Ill. Dec. 782 (Ill. 1987); Cleary v. Philip Morris Inc., 656 
F.3d 511, 516 (7th Cir. 2011) (""The Illinois Supreme Court appears to recognize unjust enrichment as an independent cause of 
action.""). "
354,12," There is no suggestion that Carrasquillo would not have been eligible for PAP prior to the expansion of its income eligibility 
criteria. In any event, since the eligibility expansion occurred in the summer of 2009, the changes would already have been in 
place by October 2009 had she sought to enroll then. "
368,1," If Mr. Perez chooses to amend his Complaint, failure to allege facts not barred by the respective statutes of limitations or failure 
to allege fraud with particularity will result in a dismissal with prejudice. See Jackson, 353 F.3d at 758."
368,2," This allegation is contradicted by the statement that ""CMI fully modified the loan for [Mr. Perez] in 2012."" Joint Status Report at 
2. "
371,3," It is also unclear to the Court when the alleged fraud occurred. As required by the heightened standard for pleading fraud, if Mr. 
Perez chooses to amend his claims, he would be required to provide specific times of the alleged fraud that would not be barred 
by the four-year statute of limitations under the UCL. In an amended complaint, failure to allege specific facts that show that CMI 
intentionally made misrepresentations to Mr. Perez will likely result in dismissal with prejudice. See Jackson v. Carey, 353 F.3d 
at 758. "
374,1," At times, Plaintiffs' pleadings have referred to the relevant product market as ""fluid Grade A milk."" See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 13; Doc. 
16 at 14. This term has been used interchangeably in this case with ""raw Grade A milk,"" which is the term used in the CAC. Doc. 
117 at 13; ¶ 29. "
375,2," According to Dr. Rausser, a ""Farmer Premium"" is the amount received by each class member after subtracting ""from their 
gross pay price the federally regulated blend minimum"" price for each month. Doc. 381-1 at 12; 3/16/12 Rausser Rebuttal at 10. 
Dr. Rausser defines the ""federally regulated blend minimum price"" as the amount ""set each month for each Order by the Market 
Administrator for that Order."" Doc. 381-1 at 100-01; 3/16/12 Rausser Rebuttal at 98-99. By subtracting this price from the ""total 
price"" paid to farmers, Dr. Rausser asserts that the resulting ""Farmer Premium"" exposes the extent of price suppression in Order 
1 relevant to the benchmark orders. Id."
375,3," The court has also certified two subclasses, consisting of those dairy farmers who are members of DFA or otherwise sell milk 
through DMS (""DFA/DMS subclass"") and those dairy farmers who are not members of DFA and do not otherwise sell milk 
through DMS (""non-DFA/DMS subclass""). "
376,4," A party disputing a fact must either cite admissible evidence to establish that dispute or demonstrate the moving party's fact is 
unsupported by the evidence. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). ""If a party fails to . . . properly address another party's assertion of fact 
as required by Rule 56(c), the court may . . . (2) consider the fact undisputed for purposes of the motion; . . . (4) or issue any 
other appropriate order."" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). "
377,5," See Cal. Dental Ass'n v. FTC, 526 U.S. 756, 770, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999) (reserving ""quick look"" approach 
to cases in which ""an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the arrangements in 
question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets""). "
378,6," ""Evaluating market power begins with defining the relevant market."" Geneva Pharms. Tech. Corp. v. Barr Labs., Inc., 386 F.3d 
485, 496 (2d Cir. 2004). Thus, in order to assert an antitrust claim, a plaintiff must allege which ""trade or commerce,"" 15 U.S.C. 
§§ 1, 2, has been restrained. See Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U.S. 447, 459, 113 S. Ct. 884, 122 L. Ed. 2d 247 
(1993) (explaining that to determine whether there is a viable claim of monopolization or attempted monopolization, a court must 
inquire ""into the relevant product and geographic market"")."
378,7," Plaintiffs do not acknowledge that Dr. Rausser's opinion differs from their own definition of the relevant geographic market. 
They point to Dr. Rausser's explanation that: ""The purpose of this testimony [that the relevant geographic market extends 
beyond Order 1 to include dairy farmers who supply milk  [*20] to Order 1] was to point out that my conclusion [that] Order 1 is a 
relevant geographic market would not change even if my analysis were broadened to include farmers in nearby unregulated 
areas who sell their milk into Order 1."" Doc. 381-1 at 22; 3/16/12 Rausser Rebuttal at 20. However, at no time did Dr. Rausser 
opine that in order to be considered part of Order 1, a dairy farmer must be physically located within its confines. "
382,8," See H.L. Hayden Co., 879 F.2d at 1012 (directing that courts ""must accord plaintiffs 'the full benefit of their proof without tightly 
compartmentalizing the various factual components and wiping the slate clean after scrutiny of each'"") (quoting Cont'l Ore Co. v. 
Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962))."
382,9," The December 17, 1998 letter states: We look  [*37] forward to our expanding relationship with DFA as DFA begins to provide milk to the Venture, pursuant to 
the Milk Supply Agreement executed today. "
383,," After DFA successfully assumes responsibility for the co-op milk supply as contemplated by the Milk Supply Agreement, we 
would expect that DFA would gradually expand its milk supply responsibilities to include other milk supply needs of the 
Venture, including those which may be provided by independent producers. Pursuant to our discussions we would work closely with and provide support and assistance to DFA in accomplishing this 
result. After DFA has successfully performed its obligations under the Milk Supply Agreement, we, with DFA, would turn our 
efforts to the conversion of independent producers to DFA membership, (or in lieu thereof, to nonmembers utilizing the 
marketing services of DFA) first, around the East Greenbush, New York plant. Thereafter, as DFA's milk supplying 
capabilities increase, we would support and join your efforts to represent other producers so as to increase the percent of 
DFA controlled milk supplied to the Venture in the future, subject to the Venture's milk requirements. Doc. 488-1 at 14-15, PSOF 90(c)."
383,10," The cited statements were made in the following context: I think it will take one of two things to bring dairy cooperatives in under DFA's umbrella. No dairy cooperative in the United 
States is going to change its current course of action unless (1) it has or senses, ""risk"" going forward ""as is,"" (2) has a 
politically viable alternative that is saleable to the masses, and (3) addresses the personal expectations and/or 
requirements of the management and farmer leaders. Pretty basic stuff, huh? Even if these conditions are met, you still 
need one of two things: 1) either DFA hits home runs every year - year after year - on a substantial basis (something that 
will take time to achieve if it isn't impossible to begin with) or 2) DFA is flexible with respect to how cooperatives come 
into the fold (certainly  [*40] DFA has shown flexibility, and class and grace, with respect to Dairylea). I believe that instead of trying to be everybody's friend and having nice lunches and meetings with everyone, we should act 
like the competitors that we are. We can still be cordial, but we should put the maximum amount of pressure on other 
cooperatives so that they comprehend that DFA is not going to give them a free ride until everyone associated with that 
cooperative retires or dies. On the other hand, there still needs to be a politically attractive alternative for these 
cooperatives. In some cases, straight up merger will work. In other cases, however, I believe having an alternative structure 
will be necessary. Cooperatives operating facilities have debt load, equity, and milk check competitiveness issues facing them. With 
increasingly large proprietary competitors squeezing these cooperatives, merger may be an effective way to bring about 
unification because of the flexibility merger provides with respect to handling member equity. In the East, cooperatives like 
St. Albans and Maryland-Virginia, with minimal manufacturing operations and thus fewer problems, have less need for 
DFA's help with respect to  [*41] debt load, equity, and keeping members competitive on a month-to-month basis. These 
cooperatives might be convinced to come under the DFA tent, but they won't merge. Basically, putting it in the worst light 
possible, they don't have to merge, so they won't. Pls. Ex. 66 at 3 (emphasis supplied). "
384,11," Defendants have compiled their own list of Plaintiffs' use  [*44] of this phrase, Doc. 487 at 8 n.2, and point out that the court 
has already found that this document is ""less compelling than Plaintiffs claim"" for the reasons Defendants have asserted. See 
Allen v. Dairy Farmers of Am., Inc., 279 F.R.D. 257, 265 (D. Vt. 2011). Since the court's observation, Plaintiffs' use of this phrase 
has increased, and it could aptly be described as a cornerstone of their damages theory. The cited sentence fragment is not 
remotely able to bear that weight. "

Ass'n v. United States, 436 U.S. 816, 822, 98 S. Ct. 2122, 56 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1978). The Act does not extend immunity for 
conduct ""outside the 'legitimate objects' of a cooperative,"" including restraining or monopolizing trade, or suppressing 
competition. Md. & Va. Milk Producers Ass'n, Inc. v. United States, 362 U.S. 458, 468, 80 S. Ct. 847, 4 L. Ed. 2d 880 (1960)

harassment, . . . coerced membership, and discriminatory pricing."") (citations  [*59] omitted). "
392,14," Defendants note that Plaintiffs' opposition to their motion for summary judgment on Plaintiffs' continuing violation theory is 
contained in a footnote. See Doc. 488 at 68 n.66. In the footnote, Plaintiffs contend that ""the conspirators engaged in numerous 
acts to implement, effectuate, and extend the unlawful conspiracy within the four years before this case was filed."" Id. To identify 
these ""numerous acts,"" Plaintiffs refer the court  [*75] to another section of their brief which addresses the acts in question only 
in general terms. Plaintiffs, however, have responded to Defendants' Statement of Undisputed Facts regarding their continuing 
violation theory in a sufficiently detailed manner to preserve this issue for trial. See Doc. 488-1 at 48-50; PSOF 294-312. "
402,1," In the Counterclaim, the defendants/counterclaim-plaintiffs use the term ""WASCO"" to refer to both Wasco, Inc. and Lovell's 
Masonry, Inc. See Counterclaim ¶ 25,  [**6] ECF No. 5. For the sake of consistency, the Court does the same. "
404,2," Although WASCO argues otherwise, I.A.M. Nat'l Pension Fund Benefit Plan C v. Stockton TRI Indus., 727 F.2d 1204, 234 U.S. 
App. D.C. 105 (D.C. Cir. 1984),  [**11] is not to the contrary. The court in that case concluded that MPPAA's arbitration 
requirement was ""a prudential matter rather than a jurisdictional bar."" Id. at 1209. But the Grand Union court clarified and 
narrowed Stockton, explaining that ""Stockton is a case in which the party so tardily pleading arbitration had effectively waived 
the right to do so, and in which other facts did not impel the court to delay adjudication."" 808 F.2d at 70. The Grand Union court 
went on to conclude, as set forth above, that ""'[a]rbitrate first' is indeed a rule Congress stated unequivocally."" Id."
404,3," It appears that arbitration proceedings are currently ongoing between the parties. See Answer ¶ 15 (""Defendants . . . deny the 
allegation that they have not yet initiated arbitration.""); Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. to Dismiss Countercl. 6 (""Defendants themselves 
requested arbitration in this case, and counsel for the IPF has negotiated with counsel for Defendants regarding selection of an 
arbitrator to handle the arbitration.""). Indeed,  [**14] while WASCO's arbitration claims are pending, WASCO must still pay the 
withdrawal liability amounts under the clear language of the MPPAA. "
405,4," Courts have recognized exceptions to the arbitration requirement where fraud, misrepresentation, or both are alleged. See Carl 
Colteryahn Dairy, Inc. v. W. Pa. Teamsters & Emp'rs Pension Fund, 847 F.2d 113, 119 (3d Cir. 1988) (stating that a claim that 
an employer was fraudulently induced to become and remain a contributing member of the Fund ""differs significantly from the 
types of highly technical MPPAA issues that the statute has assigned to arbitration,"" and as such, need not be arbitrated before 
being brought in federal court). However, WASCO does not allege that it was fraudulently induced into entering into the 
collective  [**17] bargaining agreements and, at bottom, all of the claims center around the withdrawal liability amounts requiring 
application of the highly technical MPPAA issues. As such, this exception is inapposite. "
408,5," Finally, and as WASCO has conceded, even if WASCO could state a claim on LMRA violation grounds, it would not be entitled 
to damages, as several circuits have expressly held that there is no private cause of action for damages under 29 U.S.C. § 186. 
See, e.g., Bakerstown Container Corp. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 884 F.2d 105, 107 (3d Cir. 1989) (""[C]ourts of appeals for 
several circuits have concluded that § 302 provides no private cause of action for damages resulting from violations of § 302 [of 
the LMRA].""). "
412,1," Plaintiff explains a ""Pick-a-Payment Loan"" as ""a loan in which the borrower could select how much he or she pays each month 
to defendant from four options. Under these four options, the borrower could (1) make a loan payment that was equivalent to the 
standard 30-year term; (2) make a loan payment equivalent to a 15-year term payment; (3) make interest only payments; or (4) 
make a minimum payment in an amount to be determined by defendant."" FAC ¶ 27. "
413,2," Section 2924(g)(c)(i)(A) does not exist. Plaintiff may have intended to cite Civil Code § 2924g(c)(1)(A), which provides that 
""[t]here may be a postponement or postponements of the sale proceedings . . . [u]pon the order of any court of competent 
jurisdiction."" "
416,3," The court notes that the Ninth Circuit has not ruled on the question whether HOLA applies to Wells Fargo under the 
circumstances presented here. While there is disagreement among the district courts, the majority view is that HOLA applies to 
FSB-originated loans even as to conduct that post-dates the Wachovia/Wells Fargo merger. See Marquez v. Wells Fargo Bank, 
N.A., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131364, 2013 WL 5141689 at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 13, 2013); see also Metzger v. Wells Fargo Bank,

423,4," RESPA was amended, effective July 20, 2011, to shorten the time afforded loan servicers to respond to QWRs. Pub.L. No. 
111-203, tit. XIV, § 1463 (2010). Section § 2605(e)(1)(A) was amended to decrease the response time for acknowledgment of 
receipt of a QWR from ""20 days"" to ""5 days."" Section 2605(e)(2) was also amended to decrease the response time for providing 
information or an explanation as to why information cannot be obtained from ""60 days"" to ""30 days."" See Mortgage Reform and 
Anti-Predatory Lending Act, Pub.L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1463 (2010). "
431,1," The Providers include not only healthcare professionals and medical and surgical centers, but also others providing equipment 
and supplies. "
432,2," The Providers also allege that Defendants reached an agreement to fix prices to be paid for services rendered by healthcare 
providers such as Plaintiffs (the ""BCBS Price Fixing Conspiracy""). (Doc. # 86 at ¶ 3). As to price fixing, the Providers allege that 
each Defendant has agreed to participate  [**17] in the Blue Card program which locks in discounted reimbursement rates that 
the various Defendants have unlawfully achieved through market dominance in their respective Service Areas. Plaintiffs claim 
that the Blues' conduct results in all Providers receiving reimbursement rates that are well below market. (Doc. # 86 at ¶ 7). As a 
result, the Providers allege that they receive a significantly lower reimbursement rate for rendering service to a patient who is 
insured or administered by Defendants in other Service Areas because of this Price Fixing Conspiracy. (Doc. # 86 at ¶ 7). The 
court does not address the Providers' price fixing claims in this ruling. "
433,3," Plaintiffs have alleged to the contrary. See e.g., Doc. # 85 at ¶¶ 9, 10, 336-52; Doc. # 86 at ¶¶ 3-6, 157, 160-63."
433,4," Without admitting that their per se claim under the Sherman Act is subject to dismissal, the Provider Plaintiffs tacitly conceded 
at argument that they had not at this point attempted to state a rule of reason claim. They requested the opportunity to 
supplement their Master Complaint to allege such a claim, and the court has permitted them to do so. "
434,5," Moreover, even if the alleged market allocation agreement merely enforced pre-existing trademarks (and, to be sure, Plaintiffs 
have alleged that is not the case), that fact does not necessarily insulate the agreement from antitrust analysis. The Supreme 
Court has been clear on this issue in its Sealy decision. ""In Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 593, 71 S. Ct. 
971, 95 L. Ed. 1199 (1951), as in the present case, it was argued that the restraints were reasonable steps incident to a valid 
trademark licensing system. But the Court summarily rejected the argument, as we do here. It pointed out that the restraints 
went far beyond the protection of the trademark and included non-trademarked items, and it concluded that: 'A trademark cannot 
be legally used as a device for Sherman Act violation.'"" United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U.S. 350, 357, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 
2d 1238 (1967) (quoting Timken, 341 U.S. at 599). "
435,6," Plaintiffs allege that BCBSA was created by its 38 independent Blue Plans that operate under Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
trademarks and trade names, and that it is ""the trade association for the Blue Cross Blue Shield companies."" (Doc. # 99 at ¶ 
332; Doc. # 86 at ¶ 106). Plaintiffs further allege that the Plans are the members of, and govern, BCBSA, and that BCBSA is 
entirely controlled by its member plans. (Doc. # 99 at ¶ 333; Doc. # 86 at ¶ 106). Thus, they argue the agreements to allocate 
markets and fix prices are in fact horizontal and constitute per se violations of Section 1."
435,7," United States v. Sealy, 388 U.S. 350, 357, 87 S. Ct. 1847, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1238 (1967)."
435,8," Of course, even after expressing such reluctance, the Dagher Court stated plainly that ""[p]rice-fixing agreements between two 
or more competitors, otherwise known as horizontal price-fixing agreements, fall into the category of arrangements that are per 
se unlawful."" Dagher, 547 U.S. at 5. "
436,9," In addition to their assertion that the Supreme Court has retreated from its application of a per se analysis in a horizontal 
market allocation case, Defendants also assert that the challenged restraints  [**32] are not, in fact, horizontal. In making this 
argument, they point to their relationship with BCBSA, and even before that, the historical involvement of the American Medical 
Association and the American Hospital Association. This argument contradicts Plaintiffs' allegations in this case and is one more 
properly made as part of a Rule 56 motion as it will require fact development through discovery."
436,10," Defendants argue that the License Agreements themselves do not contain any provision which constitutes an illegal restraint 
on trade. However, that assertion is inapposite here because Plaintiffs need not tie their allegations of concerted activity to any 
particular agreement. To allege a Sherman Act violation, Plaintiffs must merely allege concerted action. ""When there is sufficient 
concert of action to implicate the purposes of the Sherman Act, the statute is applied without any need or attempt to classify that 
concerted action as a contract, a combination, or a conspiracy."" 6 P. Areeda &  [**34] H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, (""Areeda"") 
¶ 1403 at 20 (3d ed. 2010). The ""core concern"" of Section 1 is when ""competitors cooperate to substitute common action for "
437,," competition and thereby effect an anticompetitive restraint that could not otherwise be achieved."" Areeda, ¶ 1402a3, at 10. Thus, 
the court must focus on all of Plaintiffs' allegations of concerted action rather than accept Defendants' invitation to parse through 
specific written agreements."
437,11," As the Eleventh Circuit states in Taffet v. Southern Co.: The origin of the filed rate doctrine can be traced back to Texas & Pacific Railway v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 
27 S. Ct. 350, 51 L. Ed. 553 (1907), in which the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a shipper could maintain a 
common law action for damages against a common carrier for ""the exaction of an alleged unreasonable rate, although the 
rate collected and complained of was the rate stated in the schedule filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission...."" Id. 
at 436. The Court held that the shipper could not maintain such an action. After acknowledging that, at common law, a 
shipper had a right of action for damages against a carrier who refused to carry goods except upon the payment of an 
unreasonable sum, id., the Court held that the Interstate Commerce Act implicitly had changed the common law, id. at 436, 
and that the shipper's only redress was through the Interstate Commerce Commissions (ICC) which had the power to alter 
established rates. Id. at 448. The Court reasoned that the existence of a shipper's right  [**36] to recover damages on the 
basis that the established rate was unreasonable was ""wholly inconsistent with the administrative power conferred upon the 
[ICC], and with the duty, which the [Interstate Commerce Act] casts upon that body, of seeing to it that the statutory 
requirement as to uniformity and equality of rates is observed."" Id. at 440-41. Following Abilene Cotton, federal courts have applied the filed rate doctrine in a variety of contexts to bar recovery by those 
who claim injury by virtue of having paid a filed rate. See, e.g., Keogh v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry., 260 U.S. 156, 43 
S.Ct. 47, 67 L.Ed. 183 (1922) (plaintiff may not recover under federal antitrust laws for asserted injury related to paying the 
rate approved by the ICC)."
437,967," F.2d 1483, 1488-89 (parallel and additional citations omitted). "
438,12," In cases transferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, a federal district court applies the clearly settled law of the transferee court. 
See Murphy v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 208 F.3d 959, 965 (11th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1049, 121 S. Ct. 652, 148 
L. Ed. 2d 556 (2001) (adjudicating choice of law in the context of a transfer under 28 U.S.C. § 1406)."
438,13," For this reason, at least in this Circuit, the argument advanced by the Amici Curiae Antitrust Law professors (Doc. # 159)—
that the Filed Rate Doctrine only applies when the rate is ""filed"" with a federal  [**39] agency—is wide of the mark."
438,14," This argument does not apply to the Provider Plaintiffs, nor to Plaintiffs in states  [**40] where rates are not filed. The states in 
which Defendants assert rates have been filed are: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North 
Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Tennessee."
438,15," Plaintiffs further assert that it follows that each Defendant agreed not to file rates in any other Blue's markets, or to subject 
itself to the authority of the state insurance regulators of any such market, and the Filed Rate Doctrine cannot possibly shelter 
defendants who did not file rates in those markets. "
440,16," Although none of the Pireno factors are singlehandedly dispositive, 458 U.S. at 129, the fact that the Providers are not parties 
to an insurance relationship (i.e., either  [**49] insurer or insured) strongly weighs against the application of the Act's antitrust 
exemption to their claims. See Royal Drug, 440 U.S. at 216 (holding that the antitrust exemption was inapplicable, in part, 
because the complained-of ""Pharmacy Agreements [were] not 'between insurer and insured'""). "
441,17," The  [**51] court is aware that in Gilchrist, the panel, referring to the allegations in Slagle, loosely characterized them as 
involving ""premium stabilization through horizontal market allocation."" Gilchrist, 390 F.3d at 1333. However, a review of the 
actual facts in Slagle makes crystal clear that the Gilchrist court's short hand reference to ""horizontal market allocation"" was 
neither critical to its holding in Gilchrist (and therefore is non-binding dicta) nor is it an accurate description of the plaintiff's theory 
in Slagle (and therefore is not helpful). Indeed, in Slagle, plaintiffs did not complain of horizontal market allocation, at least in the 
sense alleged here."
441,18," As the Third Circuit put it, ""Plaintiffs allege only that defendants colluded in order to influence with which of them a given policy 
could be placed. In other words, the complaint asserts conduct  [**54] affecting not whether or to what extent a prospective 
insurance purchaser would transfer its risk to an insurer, but merely to which insurer that risk would be transferred. [Accordingly], 
. . . we cannot say that defendants' challenged agreement, as alleged in the complaint, affected the spreading of risk within the 
meaning of the 'business of insurance.'"" Id. "
442,19," The Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction and/or Improper Venue were filed by Defendants Triple S Salud, Inc. 
(Doc. # 107), Capital Blue Cross (Docs. # 112, 119, and 135), Excellus Health Plan, Inc., d/b/a Excellus BlueCross BlueShield 
(Doc. # 113), Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania (Doc. # 121), Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mississippi (Doc. # 122), Blue 
Cross Blue Shield of Arizona (Doc. # 125), Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, Inc. (Doc. # 125), Blue Cross Blue Shield of 
North Dakota (Doc. # 125), Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming (Doc. # 125), and HealthNow New York, Inc. (Doc. # 125)."
442,20," Under Section 1391(b)(1), venue is proper where one of the defendants resides in the relevant district and all of the 
defendants reside in the state in which the district is located. However, pursuant to Section 1391(c)(2), corporate defendants are 
""deemed to reside"" in any judicial district in which they are subject to personal jurisdiction. As a result, in the context of corporate 
 [**57] defendants, venue is proper wherever personal jurisdiction exists."
442,21," Regardless of approach, all courts seemingly agree with the notion that Section 12 grants nationwide personal jurisdiction in 
antitrust cases involving corporate defendants. Compare KM Enterprises, 725 F.3d at 724 (""Section 12 provides for both 
personal jurisdiction and venue in the case of a corporate defendant . . . the second clause provides for nationwide (indeed, "
443,," worldwide)  [**58] service of process and therefore nationwide personal jurisdiction.""); with Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Electric 
Company, Ltd., 885 F.2d 1406, 1415 (9th Cir. 1989) (""[W]e believe that the district judge [was] clearly correct in his view and that 
the worldwide service provision of § 12 justifies its conclusion that personal jurisdiction may be established in any district, given 
the existence of sufficient national contacts."")."
443,22," In both their briefs and at oral argument, Defendants characterize the ""integrated"" approach in reverse fashion, asserting that 
it stands for the proposition that Section 12's nationwide service of process procedure may only be utilized if its venue provision 
is first satisfied. See, e.g., (Doc. # 125-1 at 15—""Most of the Courts of Appeal addressing the relationship between the venue 
and service clauses of Section 12, including the District of Columbia, Second, and Seventh Circuits, adopt an 'integrated 
approach,' reading the two clauses together and requiring that plaintiffs first establish that venue is appropriate under Section 12 
before taking advantage of its nationwide service of process clause.""); (Doc. # 187 at 231—""[Y]ou only get through the gate to 
nationwide  [**59] service if you show that you meet the venue test that's in the first clause.""). Defendants appear to have 
misunderstood the crux of the circuit split: The debate's focus is not whether a plaintiff must first satisfy Section 12's venue 
clause before being able to employ Section 12's nationwide service of process procedure, but rather whether a plaintiff who has 
chosen to employ Section 12's nationwide service measure is then forced to also use Section 12 to determine venue or may 
instead look to Section 1391 in making such a determination. See KM Enterprises, 725 F.3d at 724-25 (""The structure of Section 
12 raises a question, however: must its venue and service-of-process provisions be read as an integrated whole? That is, if a 
plaintiff chooses to take advantage of Section 12's nationwide service-of-process provision (and thus in effect rely on nationwide 
personal jurisdiction), must she then establish venue under Section 12 as well, or may she mix and match, relying on the 
Clayton Act for personal jurisdiction and Section 1391 for venue?"")."
443,23," The Third Circuit has also adopted a ""mix-and-match"" interpretation of Section 12 in In re: Automotive Refinishing Paint 
Antitrust Litigation, 358 F.3d 288, 297 & n.10 (3d Cir. 2004). However, its holding was limited to alien corporate defendants. Id. 
Although Go-Video also involved an alien corporate defendant, the Ninth Circuit explicitly extended its holding to domestic 
corporate defendants in Action Embroidery Corp. v. Atlantic Embroidery, Inc., 368 F.3d 1174, 1179-80 (9th Cir. 2004)."

444,29," In Defendants' Motion (Doc. # 116), Defendants argue that Shred 360 does not have standing because, pursuant to the 
allegations of the Subscribers' Master Complaint, Shred 360 was not a direct purchaser. The court agrees with Plaintiffs that the 
allegations of the Master Complaint should be read in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. And, also, a decision on that disputed 
issue is more appropriate for determination on a developed factual record. Therefore, Defendants' motion (Doc. # 116) is due to

445,1," This Motion is directed to the allegations of a Complaint  [**66] filed in the underlying case in the District of Maryland (and that

457,5," Sutter initially argued that Plaintiffs lack standing to sue for damages under the Sherman Act. Motion at 16. Sutter  [**28] does 
not pursue this argument in its reply brief, however, and states its intent to ""defer for now its challenge to [P]laintiffs' standing."" 
Reply at 5 n.1. The order thus does not address the standing argument. "
458,6," Sutter argues that the court should consider the contents of the Dartmouth Atlas website (attached as LeVee Decl. Exs. A-C, 
ECF No. 71) as incorporated by reference to the complaint because it provides an additional basis for concluding that the HSA 
boundaries are not plausible. See Motion at 22, n.11. The website defines HSAs as local health care markets for hospital care in 
the form of a collection of zip codes for residents who receive most of their hospitalizations from hospitals in that area, a static 
description of where customers receive hospitalizations in that area. Id. at 22. The Dartmouth HSAs also include zip codes 
where substantial numbers of people use hospitals outside the HSA, which means that the HSA boundaries do not establish 
plausible markets. Id. at 23. The HSAs also are based on Medicare discharges, a population excluded by Plaintiffs' proposed 
relevant product market, which puts the product and geographic markets in conflict because the geographic markets do not 
account for the class here of commercial health plan  [**34] subscribers. Id. at 23-24. In addition, Sutter contends — and asks 
for judicial notice of facts that support its contentions — that using the HSAs yields demonstrably absurd results, including (1) 
putting Berkeley and Oakland in different HSAs (even though both are in Alameda County), (2) limiting a geographic market to 
an area immediately surrounding Mills-Peninsula Medical Center in San Mateo County (even though two non-Sutter hospitals 
are located a short distance away in Daly City and Redwood City, both in San Mateo County), (3) defining an HSA for Castro 
Valley, where Sutter operates Eden Medical Center (even though that excludes a non-Sutter hospital 8.2 miles away that also is 
in Alameda County), and (4) defining an HSA for Davis, where Sutter operates Sutter Davis Hospital (even though that excludes 
a Dignity Health hospital 10 miles away that also is in Yolo County). Id. at 24-25; Request for Judicial Notice (""RJN""), ECF No. 
71; Reply Supp. RJN, ECF No. 75. This shows that there are reasonable substitutes for Sutter's Inpatient Hospital Services that 
are not included in the proposed geographic markets and that the markets thus are not plausible. Motion at 22-25. Plaintiffs  [**35] oppose Sutter's request as an attempt to rely upon ""contentions of purported 'facts' well beyond the four corners 
of the TAC"" and contend that relying on those documents would require the court to convert the motion to dismiss into a motion 
for summary judgment. See RJN Opp'n, ECF No. 73 at 3-4. "
459,," While the court likely could rely on contents of the Dartmouth Atlas website under the incorporation by reference doctrine, and 
take judicial notice of the geographic facts that support Sutter's arguments that Plaintiffs do not allege a plausible market, it does 
not need to do so to reach the conclusion that Plaintiffs do not allege a plausible geographic market. Accordingly, the court 
denies as moot Sutter's requests for judicial notice. "
460,7," In their opposition, Plaintiffs make other arguments in support of their geographic market definition, but these merely respond to 
Sutter's subsidiary arguments. See, e.g., Opp'n at 28 (addressing Sutter's criticism that Plaintiffs define the geographic market 
too narrowly), 29 (addressing Sutter's factual attack that HSAs are based on Medicare discharges while the relevant product 
market excludes Medicare patients), 30 (addressing Sutter's criticism that the HSAs are ""one-size-fits-all"" geographic market 
definitions). The court finds Sutter's arguments either unpersuasive at the 12(b)(6) stage or (with regard to arguments based on 
Sutter's requests for judicial notice) the court does not reach them. "
461,8," Because Plaintiffs' failure to define the relevant markets disposes of the entire case, and because the court addressed nearly 
identical arguments in its previous orders, the court does not reach the arguments regarding Plaintiffs' failure to allege 
anticompetitive effects in the tied product market and the alleged anti-steering clauses. "
468,1," An orphan drug is one used to treat a rare disease or ailment. Because the drug will be purchased by only a small number of 
persons, pharmaceutical companies may lack the financial incentive to develop drugs for such diseases. To combat this 
problem, Congress passed the Orphan Drug Act, which provides various benefits to the sponsor of an orphan drug. Perhaps 
most importantly, the Act provides for a seven-year period of non-patent related marketing exclusivity. See Baker Norton 
Pharms., Inc. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 132 F. Supp. 2d 30, 31-32 (D.D.C. 2001). "
469,2," The settlement agreements were executed on the following dates: the Teva agreement was executed on December 8, 2005, 
effective December 4, 2005; the Ranbaxy agreement was executed on December 22, 2005, effective the same day; the Mylan 
agreement was executed on January 9, 2006; and the Barr agreement was executed on February 1, 2006. (Ceph. SOF ¶¶ 24,

Comm'n v. Cephalon, 551 F. Supp. 2d 21 (D.D.C. 2008). "
472,5," The Individual Plaintiffs also point to a file note written by Vincent Fabiano, the lead negotiator for Ranbaxy, outlining the terms 
of Cephalon's offer and noting that Cephalon ""will give us a deal otherwise similar to Teva, i.e.[] launch in 2011 or 2012 with 
early launch upon launch by any other generic."" (Refsin Decl., Ex. M.) "
473,6," (Hennings Decl. Ex. 21, Teva Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.1; Hennings Decl. Ex. 24, Ranbaxy Settlement Agreement, at § 
3.1.1; Hennings Decl. Ex. 27, Mylan Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.1; Hennings Decl. Ex. 29, Barr Settlement Agreement, at § 
3.2.)"
473,7," More specifically, the agreements explicitly addressed three situations in which another generic version of modafinil might 
reach the market before the date certain. First, Cephalon might negotiate an earlier entry date with another generic 
manufacturer. (Hennings Decl. Ex. 21, Teva Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.2; Hennings Decl. Ex. 24, Ranbaxy Settlement 
Agreement, at § 3.1.2; Hennings Decl. Ex. 27, Mylan Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.2;  [*43] Hennings Decl. Ex. 29, Barr 
Settlement Agreement, at Ex. A § 2.2(b).) Second, a non-settling Generic Defendant might continue to litigate and launch ""at-
risk"" at the end of the 30-month stay. (Hennings Decl. Ex. 21, Teva Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.3; Hennings Decl. Ex. 24, 
Ranbaxy Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.3; Hennings Decl. Ex. 27, Mylan Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.3; Hennings Decl. Ex. "
474,29," , Barr Settlement Agreement, at Ex. A § 2.2(c).) Third, a non-settling Generic Defendant might continue to litigate and obtain a 
non-appealable final judgment that Cephalon's patent was either invalid or not infringed. (Hennings Decl. Ex. 21, Teva 
Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.3.7; Hennings Decl. Ex. 24, Ranbaxy Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.3.7; Hennings Decl. Ex. 
27, Mylan Settlement Agreement, at § 3.1.3.7; Hennings Decl. Ex. 29, Barr Settlement Agreement, at Ex. A § 2.2(d).) Under 
each of these contingencies, the settling Generic Defendant would be allowed to enter the market."
474,8," (Hennings Decl. Ex. 24, Ranbaxy Settlement Agreement, at § 3.5; Hennings Decl. Ex. 27, Mylan Settlement Agreement, at § 
3.6.)"
474,9," For example, one of Ranbaxy's lead negotiators received a copy of the press release announcing the Cephalon-Teva 
settlement on December 9, 2005, almost two weeks prior to the execution of the Cephalon-Ranbaxy settlement. (Grogan Decl. 
Ex. N.) One of Mylan's lead negotiators testified that he was aware of both the Teva and Ranbaxy settlements prior to 
negotiating with Cephalon.  [*45] (Grogan Decl. Ex. R, at 73:21 to 74:7.) Barr, the last Generic Defendant to settle, was similarly 
aware of the three prior agreements before executing its Settlement Agreement with Cephalon. (Grogan Decl. Ex. Z.) "
475,10," As Apotex points out, for the purposes of summary judgment, I must assume that Cephalon obtained the '516 patent through 
fraud on the Patent Office, despite my decision not to give collateral estoppel effect to my prior ruling on that issue. King Drug 
Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32508, 2014 WL 982848 (E.D. Pa. March 13, 2014).  [*47] I do 
not, however, consider that fact significant to my analysis of the overall conspiracy motions addressed here. "
476,11," Oftentimes, these cases arise in the context of individual vertical agreements, from which the plaintiff attempts to infer a 
horizontal or overall conspiracy. See Toys ""R"" Us v. Federal Trade Commission, 221 F.3d 928, 934-36 (7th Cir. 2000) (holding 
that substantial evidence supported finding of horizontal agreement where there was a series of vertical agreements between 
toy retailer and toy manufacturers); In re Elec. Books Antitrust Litig., 859 F. Supp. 2d 671, 682-83 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (holding that 
series of vertical ""agency"" agreements between e-book publishers and distributor occurred ""in  [*52] a context that raises a 
suggestion of preceding agreement"" among the publishers (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 
557)). An overall agreement inferred from reverse-payment settlements does not quite fit this mold, as reverse payment 
settlements are horizontal restraints (that is, an agreement between competitors at the same level of distribution, United States 
v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972)), rather than vertical ones. Hence Plaintiffs 
seem to prefer the analogy to United States v. Masonite, 316 U.S. 265, 62 S. Ct. 1070, 86 L. Ed. 1461, 1942 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 
777 (1945), in which the Supreme Court appeared to affirm a finding that a series of bilateral horizontal agency agreements 
between competitors in the hardboard industry also constituted an overall horizontal conspiracy. "
477,12," The publishers had settled out of the case by the time the trial that produced the Apple decision was held. Apple, 952 F. Supp. 
2d at 645."
477,13," As the Seventh Circuit pointed out, there was also direct evidence of a conspiracy among the manufacturers. TRU carried 
information between the manufacturers, assuring each that its agreement to limit sales to the warehouse stores would be met 
with similar acquiescence by its competitors. See Toys ""R"" Us, 221 F.3d at 932 (""TRU communicated the message 'I'll stop if 
they stop' from manufacturer to competing manufacturer.""). "
479,1," Specifically, summary judgment is granted in favor of all Defendants and against the Direct Purchaser Class Plaintiffs with 
respect to Counts V and VIII of the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. Further, summary judgment is 
granted in favor of the Generic Defendants and against the Direct Purchaser Class Plaintiffs with respect to Count VI of the 
Second Consolidated Amended  [*65] Class Action Complaint. Summary judgment is also granted in favor of all Defendants and against the End Payor Class Plaintiffs with respect to Counts I, 
III, and IV of the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint, to the extent each is based on allegations of an overall 
conspiracy among all Defendants or between the Generic Defendants. Summary judgment is granted in favor of all Defendants and against Apotex with respect to Counts X and XI of the Second 
Amended Complaint, to the extent each is based on allegations of an overall conspiracy among all Defendants or between the 
Generic Defendants. Finally, with respect to the Individual Plaintiffs, summary judgment will be entered in favor of all Defendants and against the 
Individual Plaintiffs with respect to Counts V, VI, and VIII of their respective Complaints. "
491,1," Plaintiff asserts that Springfield Hospital cannot rely on certain emails, memoranda, and letters because they are inadmissible 
hearsay when offered by an opposing party. Springfield Hospital contends the documents are admissible under the business 
records exception. See HN1[
] Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) (exempting from the hearsay rule contemporaneous business records made ""by—or from information transmitted by—someone with knowledge,"" and ""kept in the course of a regularly conducted 
activity of a business"" by a business whose ""regular practice"" it was to make such records). The Second Circuit has ""stated that 
Rule 803(6) favors the admission of evidence rather than its exclusion if it has any probative value at all."" United States v. 
Kaiser, 609 F.3d 556, 574 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Springfield Hospital submitted the affidavit of Bob 
Demarco, Chief of Quality and Systems  [*7] Improvement, averring that he is personally familiar with the documents in question 
and that they ""were created in the regular course of business at Springfield Hospital."" (Doc. 44-5 ¶ 10.) Although not fully 
compliant with the foundation required by Rule 803(6), this affidavit provides a sufficient basis for the court to consider the 
internal emails, memoranda, letters, and hospital records in ruling on summary judgment as both parties rely on them. See 
Woods v. City of Chicago, 234 F.3d 979, 988 (7th Cir. 2000) (HN2[
] ""[A]t the summary judgment stage, the party seeking to 
offer the business record must attach an affidavit sworn to by a person who would be qualified to introduce the record as 
evidence at trial, for example, a custodian or anyone qualified to speak from personal knowledge that the documents were 
admissible business records.""). "
493,2," See 42 C.F.R. § 482.52(a)(4) (providing that a CRNA can only administer anesthesia if he or she ""is under the supervision of 
the operating practitioner or of an anesthesiologist who is immediately available if needed"")."
493,3," See 42 C.F.R. § 482.52(c)(1) (instructing that a hospital ""may be exempted from the requirement for physician supervision of 
CRNAs . . . if the State in which the hospital is located submits a letter to CMS signed by the Governor . . . requesting exemption 
from physician supervision of CRNAs""). "
495,4," During Mr. Majka's deposition, Plaintiff's counsel stated that he had a ""huge problem"" with the fact that Mr. Majka was ""clearly 
not prepared or capable of testifying as to almost all of the matters designated in [the Notice of Deposition]."" (Doc. 36-18 at 
55:25, 56:20-57:1.) In response, counsel for Springfield Hospital referenced a prior conversation in which he advised that ""many 
of the subject matters would be dealt with [by] Janet Lyle and Janet Sherer,"" whom Plaintiff deposed the day before Mr. Majka, 
because they had ""knowledge"" of the issues listed in the Notice of Deposition. Id. at 57:2-58:3. Counsel explained that these 
individuals had ""absolutely"" testified on behalf of Springfield Hospital concerning ""[s]ome of the issues,"" and represented that, if 
""there is other information that was left unanswered after [Ms. Lyle, Ms. Sherer, and Mr. Majka] were  [*23] deposed,"" he ""would 
be happy to make anybody else available"" except for Mr. Cordner, who was ""unavailable for reasons beyond anybody's control."" 
Id. at 57:25-58:11. Plaintiff's counsel acknowledged that Mr. Cordner would be unavailable, but stressed that he had ""issue with"" 
Mr. Majka's lack of ""prepar[ation]"" and subsequently ""suspend[ed]"" his deposition. Id. at 57:6-57:17."
495,5," Plaintiff points out that shortly before his termination, in a letter to the Governor urging him to opt-out of certain regulations, Mr. 
Cordner enthusiastically endorsed the use of CRNAs as opposed to relying solely on anesthesiologists. Plaintiff contends that 
this undercuts the credibility of Springfield Hospital's claim that Plaintiff's termination was part of a transition to an all-M.D. 
model. "
498,6," The Vermont Supreme Court has also not yet decided whether to adopt the Supreme Court's conclusion in Univ. of Tex. Sw. 
Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 186 L. Ed. 2d 503 (2013), that in Title VII retaliation cases, ""but-for causation"" (as opposed 
to a substantial or motivating factor) must be established and thus a plaintiff must prove ""that the unlawful retaliation would not 
have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer."" Id. at 2533. The Nassar Court held that 
Congress's use of the word ""because"" in Title VII's antiretaliation provision, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), imported a but-for causation 
standard. Nassar, 133 S. Ct. at 2528. The antiretaliation provision of the Vermont's Healthcare Whistleblower Protection Act also 
uses the word ""because."" See  [*32] 21 V.S.A. § 507(b) (""No employer shall take retaliatory action against any employee 
because the employee does any of the following[.]""). However, unlike FEPA, Vermont's Healthcare Whistleblower Protection Act 
is not patterned after Title VII. Because the Vermont Supreme Court has held that ""[t]he standards and burdens of proof to be 
applied under FEPA are identical to those applied under Title VII of the United States Civil Rights Act,"" Robertson v. Mylan 
Labs., Inc., 2004 VT 15, ¶ 47, 176 Vt. 356, 848 A.2d 310, the court predicts that the Vermont Supreme Court will follow Nassar 
in a FEPA case. It is an open question as to whether it will do so in analyzing claims under Vermont's Healthcare Whistleblower 
Protection Act. "
500,7," The Vermont Supreme Court has neither adopted nor rejected the cat's paw theory of liability for claims brought under state 
law. See Brown v. State, 2013 VT 112, ¶ 17, 88 A.3d 402 (acknowledging ""'cat's paw' theory of discrimination  [*41] in violation 
of the [Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act]""); Lamay v. State, 2012 VT 49, ¶ 10, 191 Vt. 635, 49 
A.3d 559 n.2 (citing Staub in an employment discrimination case and ""assum[ing] without deciding that any discriminatory 
animus by . . . plaintiff's supervisor . . . could be attributable to the ultimate decision maker""). "
501,8," HN18[
] The CPA prohibits ""retaliate[ion] against"" a person for opposing any ""act or practice which is collusive or in restraint of trade."" 9 V.S.A. § 2453b. In determining whether an act constitutes collusion, courts are to be ""guided by the construction of 
federal antitrust law and the Sherman Act, as amended, as interpreted by the courts of the United States."" 9 V.S.A. § 2453a(c). 
Accordingly, dismissal of Plaintiff's claims under the CPA and the Sherman Act turn on the threshold issue of whether Plaintiff 
has proffered admissible evidence of the alleged collusion or conspiracy to depress the wages of CRNAs. "
503,1," Defendants' request for oral argument will be denied. The parties have fully briefed the issues and oral argument will not aid in 
the Court's  [*2] decision. See Partridge v. Reich, 141 F.3d 920, 926 (9th Cir. 1998). "
505,2," Pioneer already availed itself of the contract dispute resolution process by filing a complaint with the Arizona Registrar of 
Contractors (""AZ-ROC""), which ""decided not to handle the matter and closed its file."" (Doc. 14 at 9.)"
505,3," As noted, even if the ADR provision could be considered ambiguous, the Supreme Court has liberally interpreted dispute 
resolutions provisions in favor of arbitration. Moses H. Cone Mem'l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. at 24."
505,4," In addition to relying on the Binding Dispute Resolution clause, Selectric argues that Plaintiffs fraud and antitrust claims are 
insufficiently pleaded. The Court will address these arguments in its discussion of Lutron's motion to dismiss. "
513,1," In counts seventeen and eighteen each of the plaintiffs allege negligence, against the codefendant, Thomas Duffy. "
516,2," The plaintiffs also argue, in the alternative, that the court should depart from the four-part test required to establish a claim for 
intentional infliction of emotional distress and instead require a plaintiff to prove the elements of a claim for negligent infliction of 
emotional [*18]  distress with the additional requirement that the conduct be intentional, reckless, or performed in bad faith. The 
court declines the invitation by the plaintiffs to modify the law. ""Although the doctrine of stare decisis permits a court to overturn 
its own prior cases in limited circumstances, the concept of binding precedent prohibits a trial court from overturning a prior 
decision of an appellate court. This prohibition is necessary to accomplish the purpose of a hierarchical judicial system. A trial 
court is required to follow the prior decisions of an appellate court to the extent that they are applicable to facts and issues in the 
case before it, and the trial court may not overturn or disregard binding precedent. See, e.g., Stuart v. Stuart, 297 Conn. 26, 45-
46, 996 A.2d 259 (2010) ('it is manifest to our hierarchical judicial system that this court has the final say on matters of 
Connecticut law and that the Appellate Court and Superior Court are bound by our precedent.'); Jolly, Inc. v. Zoning Board of 
Appeals, 237 Conn. 184, 195, 676 A.2d 831 (1996) ('It is axiomatic that a trial court is bound by Supreme Court precedent . . . 
This principle is inherent in a hierarchical judicial system . . . [R]evision of Supreme Court precedent is not the trial court's 
function."" [Citations omitted.])."" Potvin v. Lincoln Service and Equipment Company, 298 Conn. 620, 650, 6 A.3d 60 (2010). The 
elements of the tort [*19]  of intentional infliction of emotional distress are well established by prior decisions of our Supreme and 
Appellate Courts and this court is bound by them. "
517,3," The plaintiffs also raise concerns regarding the potential influence insurers have over their insureds when the loss suffered 
includes a home, and argue that citizens should not tolerate misconduct engaged in by insurers in bad faith where their rights 
and general welfare are involved. These arguments, however, do not address the present issue of whether the plaintiffs have 
sufficiently pled that the defendants engaged in intentional [*24]  conduct so outrageous and so extreme as to go beyond all 
bounds of normal decency."
517,4," Since the plaintiffs have failed to allege extreme and outrageous conduct sufficient for an action for intentional infliction of 
emotional distress, the court declines to address whether the plaintiffs' failure to allege an affirmative act is dispositive to the 
defendant's motion. "
522,5," Whether a CUIPA violation is a private cause of action in and of itself separate from CUTPA has not been decided by our 
appellate courts. ""Whether CUIPA allows a private cause of action independent [*44]  of CUTPA remains an open question."" 
H&L Chevrolet v. Berkley Ins. Co., 110 Conn.App. 428, 441, n.7, 955 A.2d 565 (2008). Since the plaintiffs have expressly 
alleged both CUTPA and CUIPA violations in each count, the court need not decide whether CUIPA by itself provides a private 
cause of action for individual claimants. "
524,6," The court granted the defendants' motion to strike the plaintiffs' antitrust claims in Austrian v. UnitedHealth Group, Inc., 
Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Complex Litigation Docket, Docket No. X06-CV-05-4010357-S (July 17, 2007, 
Stevens, J.) [43 Conn. L. Rptr. 852, 2007 Conn. Super. LEXIS 1949], on two grounds: (1) that the plaintiffs failed to allege 
concerted action between two legally distinct, economic entities; and (2) in addition, those counts alleging improper tying claims 
failed to establish that the ""tied"" item [*49]  was in a market distinct from the market of the ""tying"" item. Neither of those issues 
are before the court in the present motion."
524,7," The defendants also cite Springcrest Partners v. Admiral Ins. Co., United States District Court, Docket No. 4:12CV457A (N.D. 
Texas, March 25, 2013). Springcrest Partners, however, merely cites Russell v. Hartford Casualty Ins. Co., 548 S.W.2d 737 
(Texas App. 1977), for the proposition that the Texas equivalent of §38a-816(4) only applies to the business of supplying 
insurance and not to individual claimants upset by the handling of their insurance claim. Similar to Russell and as set out more 
fully in the body of this opinion, the district court decision in Springcrest Partners is devoid of any supportive reasoning for this 
interpretation of the statute."
524,8," Texas Ins. Code Ann. Art. 21.21 §4 states in relevant part: ""Boycott, Coercion and Intimidation. Entering into any agreement to 
commit, or by any concerted action committing, any act of boycott, [*52]  coercion or intimidation resulting in or tending to result 
in unreasonable restraint of, or monopoly in, the business of insurance."" "
526,9," Section 6031, referenced by the Insurance Committee, now General Statutes §38a-17, states in relevant part: ""If, in the opinion 
of the commissioner, any insurance company . . . is doing business in an illegal or improper manner or is failing to adjust and 
pay losses and obligations when they become due . . . the commissioner may order it to discontinue such illegal or improper 
method of doing business and may order it to adjust and pay its losses [*58]  and obligations as they become due."""
526,10," General Statutes §§35-28 and 35-29 of the Connecticut Antitrust Act also provides for other prohibited acts or conduct where 
the purpose or effect is monopolization or restraint in trade or commerce. Section 35-28 provides: ""Without limiting section 35-26, every contract, combination, or conspiracy is unlawful when the same 
are for the purpose, or have the effect of: (a) Fixing, controlling, or maintaining prices, rates, quotations, or fees in any part of 
trade or commerce; (b) fixing, controlling, [*60]  maintaining, limiting, or discontinuing the production, manufacture, mining, sale, 
or supply of any part of trade or commerce; (c) allocating or dividing customers or markets, either functional or geographical, in 
any part of trade or commerce; or (d) refusing to deal, or coercing, persuading, or inducing third parties to refuse to deal with 
another person."" Section 35-29 also provides: ""Every lease, sale or contract for the furnishing of services or for the sale of commodities, or for the 
fixing of prices charged therfor, or for giving or selling of a discount or rebate therefrom, on the condition or understanding that 
the lessee or purchaser shall not deal in the services or the commodities of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, 
shall be unlawful where the effect of such lease or sale or contract for sale or such condition or understanding may be to "
527,," substantially lessen competition or tend to create monopoly in any part of trade or commerce and where such goods or services 
are for the use, consumption or resale in this state."" "
528,11," The plaintiffs also allege an additional seventeen acts or practices in the business of insurance as violative of §38a-816(6). 
(Amended Complaint ¶¶194(a)-(q), 215(a)-(q)). These additional acts or practices, however, are nonspecific to the facts of this 
case and allege generally business practices prohibited by the statute to the extent that to recite them would not be helpful. "
532,1," Although irrelevant for purposes of defendants' motion to dismiss, it is worth noting that SESAC is a for-profit corporation while 
BMI and ASCAP are non-profits. (Compl. at 4-5, 7.)"

532,4," Plaintiff contends that RMLC has standing to sue on behalf of its member radio stations because RMLC negotiates their 
licenses and has agreed to sue on their behalf. Plaintiff alleges: "
533,69," . RMLC is a trade association whose objective is to achieve fair and reasonable license fees from PROs (including 
ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC) on behalf of its radio station members. As such, RMLC has standing to bring the present action 
on behalf of its members"
533,70," . RMLC's members consist of approximately 6,500  [**6] U.S. radio stations involved in the business of terrestrial radio 
broadcasting. Another 3,500 stations have agreed to be ""bound"" by the terms of the RMLC-negotiated licenses with 
ASCAP and BMI and, thereby, to pay the RMLC court-mandated fees to assist with operational expenses. RMLC's 
membership is open to all U.S. terrestrial radio stations or groups of radio stations ""under direct or indirect common 
control."" RMLC's member stations pay court-mandated dues to RMLC and have the right to resign their membership. . . ."
533,76," . RMLC's claims do not require the individual participation of each of its members to obtain the relief that it seeks. RMLC 
seeks only injunctive relief, not damages. SESAC violated the antitrust laws by employing common licensing practices that 
affect all RMLC members. RMLC can establish the illegality of these practices through evidence of SESAC's conduct that is 
common to its members. (Compl. at 23-25.) Plaintiff also alleges, ""all of RMLC's members have signed an authorization form that permits RMLC to 'institute . . . in the name 
of all authorizing stations proceedings to establish reasonable fees and terms for such licenses.'"" (Compl. at 25.) Because 
defendant has  [**7] not challenged RMLC's standing, however, the court will address the matter no further."
533,5," ""Exclusive dealing occurs when a seller agrees to sell, license or lease all or a substantial portion of its output of a product or 
service exclusively to a particular buyer, or when a buyer similarly agrees to purchase, license or lease all or a substantial 
portion of its requirements of a product or service exclusively from a particular seller."" WILLIAM HOLMES & MELISSA MANGIARACINA, 
ANTITRUST LAW HANDBOOK, Exclusive Dealing §2:19 (2013)."
533,6," A blanket license gives the purchaser the right to broadcast any music in a PRO's repertory for the time period set by the 
license agreement. (Compl. at 6.) A per-program license, on the other hand, ""permits a licensee to use all songs in a PRO's 
repertory, but only  [**9] for the purpose of specific radio programming."" (Compl. at 6.) "
534,7," Radio stations cannot avoid playing many of SESAC's songs because ""they do not control the non-feature music played in the 
programs and commercials that they air. SESAC leverages jingles and other non-feature, locked-in content to coerce RMLC's 
members (many of which rely on advertising revenue to survive) to pay for a blanket license."" (Compl. at 12.)"
534,8, Plaintiff explains:
534,58," . Because SESAC refuses to offer any viable alternative to its blanket license, no radio station has an incentive to 
acquire individual licenses directly from copyright holders. Absent a carve-out right, any direct license that a consumer 
acquired would have no effect on SESAC's blanket-license fee, but would entail an additional royalty burden on the 
consumer. When radio stations purchase blanket licenses from SESAC, therefore, they necessarily lack any incentive to 
acquire direct licenses from SESAC affiliates. As alleged in Paragraph 32, it  [**12] is not possible for radio stations to 
obtain licenses directly from SESAC affiliates and to forego dealing with SESAC. By acquiring licensing rights over 
handpicked, indispensable musical works, and by foreclosing any direct licensing between its affiliates and consumers, or 
any prospect for a carve-out discount, SESAC achieves de facto exclusive licensing rights. (Compl. at 20.)"
534,9," Carve-out rights ""entitle licensees to discounts if they secure separate permissions directly from the copyright owners to 
musical works subsumed within the blanket license."" (Compl. at 6.)"
534,10," It appears from the face of the complaint that SESAC withholds royalties from affiliates on a pro rata basis, deducting royalties 
based on how many and which songs an affiliate directly licenses. (Compl. at 20.) Plaintiff states: ""SESAC requires its affiliates 
that directly license to 'notify SESAC in writing within 10 days of the license being granted and also provide a copy of the license. 
Royalties that are otherwise payable will not be paid to performances that are direct licensed.'"" (Compl. at 20.) "
535,11," The  [**16] court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1331 and 15 U.S.C. §26 because plaintiff's claims fall 
under §1 and §2 of Title 15 of the United States Code. "
538,12," Of course, plaintiff alleges that SESAC is only able to offer its affiliates supracompetitive royalties because of its monopolistic 
conduct, but even if SESAC's ability to pay supracompetitive royalties stems from unlawful conduct, plaintiff has still failed to 
show that the unlawful conduct was  [**27] the result of concerted action. See ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 
270 n. 10 (3d Cir. 2012) (noting that §1 of Sherman Act requires concerted action while §2 does not). "
539,13," The term ""anticompetitive conduct"" is loosely coined as an umbrella term for any conduct that harms the competitive process 
itself (not simply competitors) and is therefore not conducive to concise definition. LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 152 (3d 
Cir. 2003)  [**30] (""'Anticompetitive conduct' can come in too many different forms, and is too dependent upon context, for any 
court or commentator ever to have enumerated all the varieties."") (quoting Caribbean Broad Sys., Ltd. v. Cable & Wireless PLC, 
148 F.3d 1080, 1087, 331 U.S. App. D.C. 226 (D.C. Cir. 1998))."
539,14," Plaintiff also defines the relevant geographic market as the United States. (Compl. at 17.) Because the geographic market is 
not in dispute, however, the court does not address it here. "
560,1," Defendants' motion initially encompassed state law claims brought by additional plaintiffs. However, the parties later stipulated 
to the dismissal of many plaintiffs' state law claims, leaving pending before the Court only those claims described  [*60] above. 
See MDL Master Dkt. No. 8987. "
564,1," The background facts are derived from the complaint. The Court accepts the factual allegations as true for purposes of this 
motion. Lazy Y. Ranch LTD. v. Behrens, 546 F.3d 580, 588 (9th Cir. 2008). "
569,2," Because the Court finds the defense with regard to the Social Security Act and antitrust immunity to be dispositive, it need not 
reach the other defenses raised."
569,3, The Court ordered and each party filed supplemental briefing on this issue. 
570,4," In 2008, § 9517(c)(3) was amended to include a reference to ""any health insuring organization described in [subparagraph (B)] 
that is operated by a public entity established by Merced County."" However, as discussed above, this amendment has no effect 
on 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-2(a)(3)(C) because § 1396u-2(a)(3)(C)'s adoption of OBRA's § 9517(c)(3) does not include "
577,5," Also, this Court previously noted that ""[t]he original version of the bill which became the Unruh Act extended its 
antidiscriminatory provisions to 'all public or private groups, organizations, associations, business establishments, schools, and 
public facilities"" and ""[l]ater versions dropped all the specific enumerations except 'business establishments' but added "
589,1," The Court directs the parties to this Court's procedures, which provide, in pertinent part: ""Counsel are admonished not to 
circumvent page limits by filing multiple motions which purport to address separate issues in a case. Such motions will not be 
considered unless counsel obtains leave to file more than one motion or to file a brief that exceeds the page limits authorized by 
the Local Rules."" Dkt. 5 at 2-3. The Court exercises its discretion to consider both the motion to dismiss and the motion to strike, 
but cautions counsel that ""the Court expects strict compliance,"" id. at 1, with relevant Local Rules in the future. "
590,2," Defendants' motion to strike, as well as plaintiffs' opposition, contain significantly more factual detail about the events at issue. 
The Court however, considers defendants' motions under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and thus limits its analysis to the facts alleged 
in the FAC."
590,3," The FAC identifies Mr. Needle as ""Jimm"" Needle. Defendants state that Mr. Needle is in fact named  [*6] James Needle. See 
Needle Decl. "
596,4," The Court observes that the Ninth Circuit has held that, under California law, HN19[
] ""[p]roperty is a broad concept that 
includes 'every intangible benefit and prerogative susceptible of possession or disposition.'"" Kremen v. Cohen, 337 F.3d 1024, 
1030 (9th Cir. 2003). Courts ""apply a three-part test to determine whether a property right exists: 'First, there must be an interest 
capable of precise definition; second, it must be capable of exclusive possession or control; and third, the putative owner must 
have established a legitimate claim to exclusivity.'"" Id. at 1030 (citing G.S. Rasmussen & Assocs., Inc. v. Kalitta Flying Serv., 
Inc., 958 F.2d 896, 906 (9th Cir. 1992)). Here, the only allegation that the information at issue here is ""capable of exclusive "
597,," possession or control"" rests on the confidentiality of the information. FAC ¶¶ 75-76. Because this is the same basis for plaintiffs' 
claim that they own trade secrets, FAC ¶ 82, the claim is thus ""based on the same nucleus of facts"" as plaintiffs' 
misappropriation claim, and hence preempted by the  [*31] CUTSA. See Mattel, Inc. v. MGA Entm't, Inc., 782 F. Supp. 2d 911, 
987 (C.D. Cal. 2011) (explaining that the CUTSA ""supersedes claims based on the misappropriation of confidential information, 
whether or not that information meets the statutory definition of a trade secret""). "
599,5," The Court separately notes that if plaintiffs intend to assert, in the alternative, that these claims, as well as the claim for 
negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,  [*38] are predicated on defendants' alleged theft of confidential 
information, see, e.g., FAC ¶ 97, then these claims would likely be preempted by CUTSA for the reasons stated above."
599,6," As discussed below, the FAC asserts a separate claim for defamation, based on allegations that plaintiffs falsely accused 
Valkanas of being involved in a double homicide. "
600,7," The Court notes that plaintiffs have attached several allegedly defamatory emails written by plaintiffs to their opposition to 
defendants' Anti-SLAPP motion to strike. See, e.g., Valkanas Decl. Ex. C-H. Although these emails provide significantly 
 [*42] more factual detail about the statements at issue, they were not attached to the FAC, and thus do not bear on this Court's 
analysis of whether the FAC states a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). See In re American Cont'l Corp./Lincoln Sav. & Loan Secs. 
Litig., 102 F.3d 1524, 1537 (9th Cir. 1996), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Lexecon, Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & 
Lerach, 523 U.S. 26, 118 S. Ct. 956, 140 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1998). "
608,1," The question,  [**5] as presented to the jury, recites: Do you find by clear and convincing evidence that the claimed invention was on sale, the subject of a commercial offer for 
sale, or in public use before the ""critical date"" of February 6, 2003? United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Verdict Form 2 (Feb. 28, 2013). "
610,2," To the extent that  [**7] SnoWizard asserts that its purchases of the parts was for experimental use, buying 400 or more 
exemplars can hardly qualify as anything other than commercial use, especially when, as admitted to by SnoWizard itself, it has 
never sold more than 383 icemakers a year. Indeed, in a letter submission after the hearing, SnoWizard acknowledges that the 
purchase of the SW1 and SW2 are of a ""production quantity."" "
617,3," SnoWizard also argues that the issue was not raised in the District Court and was therefore waived. New Plaintiffs correctly 
point to their briefings before the District Court where they argued that they are not in privity with Old Plaintiffs. "
618,4," We express no view as to whether all four of the Clayton Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act, Louisiana antitrust law, and Texas 
antitrust law require proof of a dangerous  [**32] probability of monopolization, as the District Court had instructed the jury. 
Appellants do not challenge the District Court's articulation of the law, and we will proceed on the basis that they need to 
establish SnoWizard's dangerous probability of monopolization. "
622,1," Plaintiffs are Dean Beaver, Laurie Beaver, Steven Adelman, Abram Aghachi, Dinesh Gauba, Kevin Kenna and Veronica 
Kenna."
622,2," Tarsadia Defendants consist of 5th Rock, Gregory Casserly, Gaslamp Holdings, LLC, MKP One, LLC, B.U. Patel, Tushar Patel, 
and Tarsadia Hotels."
622,3," As to Tarsadia Defendants, summary judgment was granted as to the first cause of action for violation of the anti-fraud 
provisions of the ILSA, the third cause of action for fraud, and fifth cause of action for unfair competition. As to Playground, 
summary  [**4] judgment was granted as to the fifth cause of action for unfair competition. "
623,4," Playground only oppose the unfair and fraudulent prongs of the UCL. Judge Sabraw dismissed the UCL ""unlawful"" claim as to 
Playground because Plaintiffs could not state an ILSA or SLA claim. (Dkt. No. 34 at 17:8-11.) Playground concedes that the 
unfair and fraudulent prongs are remaining. (Dkt. No. 98-1 at 24.) "
628,5," The ILSA has a similar savings clause as the Truth in Lendig Act (""TILA""). TILA's savings clause states: Except as provided in subsection (e) of  [**27] this section, this part and parts B and C of this subchapter do not annul, 
alter, or affect the laws of any State relating to the disclosure of information in connection with credit transactions, except to 
the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter and then only to the extent of the 
inconsistency."
628,15, U.S.C. § 1610(a)(1). 
629,6," While Plaintiffs argue that the savings clause indicates Congress' intent not to preempt state law, a savings clause is not a per 
se bar to conflict preemption. Geeir v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 529 U.S. 861, 869, 120 S. Ct. 1913, 146 L. Ed. 2d 914 (2000). The 
state law is still subject to conflict preemption. Chicanos Por La Causa, Inc., v. Napolitano, 558 F.3d 856, 866 (9th Cir. 2009). "
630,7," Defendants do not move for summary judgment on the merits of the UCL claim. In their motion, they only argue that the UCL 
claims  [**34] fails because there was no violation of the ILSA and the UCL claims are time barred by the underlying ILSA three 
year statute of limitations. Therefore those claims remain. "
631,8," Plaintiffs allege four violations of the ILSA. They include Defendants' failure to (i) file a Statement of Record with HUD, (ii) give 
each buyer an ILSA-compliant disclosure document called a Property Report before they signed their Purchase Contracts, (iii) 
include in the standardized Purchase Contract a 20-day cure provision, and (iv) disclose the two-year right to rescind under the 
ILSA that results from the first three items mentioned. It is undisputed that Tarsadia Defendants did not comply with these 
provisions. "
633,9," In Plaintiffs' opposition to Playground's motion, in a footnote they raise an alternative test for a UCL ""unfair"" claim laid out in 
Camacho v. Automobile of S. California, 142 Cal. App. 4th 1394, 1403, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770 (2006). However, Plaintiffs do not 
provide any analysis of this standard to this case. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit rejected that approach to consumer cases. 
Lozano, 504 F.3d at 736. "
636,10," Defendants note that courts are split on whether or not reliance is a required element of an ILSA anti-fraud claim citing Ivar v. 
Elk River Partners, LLC, 705 F. Supp. 2d 1220, 1236-38 (D. Colo. 2010); Garcia v. Santa Maria Resort, Inc., 528 F. Supp. 2d 
1283, 1296 (S.D. Fla. 2007). (Dkt. No. 146, Ds' Opp. at 29 n. 5.) Therefore, the argument that scienter is not a requirement for 
the anti-fraud claim could have been argued on summary judgment."
636,11," Plaintiffs argue that they did not concede that scienter is a required element; however, they cite to their brief in their motion for 
class certification which was not before the Court on the motions for summary judgment. "
649,1," This amended order corrects an inadvertent omission in the Conclusion section of the June 30, 2014 Order. (Doc. 47)."
649,2," The background facts are derived from the complaint. The Court accepts the factual allegations as  [*3] true for purposes of 
this motion. Lazy Y. Ranch LTD. v. Behrens, 546 F.3d 580, 588 (9th Cir. 2008). "
655,3," Because the Court finds the defense with regard to the Social Security Act and antitrust immunity to be dispositive, it need not 
reach the other defenses raised."
655,4, The Court ordered and each party filed supplemental briefing on this issue. 
656,5," In 2008, § 9517(c)(3) was amended  [*24] to include a reference to ""any health insuring organization described in 
[subparagraph (B)] that is operated by a public entity established by Merced County."" However, as discussed above, this 
amendment has no effect on 42 U.S.C. § 1396u-2(a)(3)(C) because § 1396u-2(a)(3)(C)'s adoption of OBRA's § 9517(c)(3) does 
not include subsequent amendments to § 9517(c)(3). Pearce, 603 F.2d at 767 (quoting Peabody Coal Co., 554 F.2d at 322). "
662,6," Also, this Court previously noted that ""[t]he original version of the bill which became the Unruh Act extended its 
antidiscriminatory provisions to 'all public or private groups, organizations, associations, business establishments, schools, and 
public facilities"" and ""[l]ater versions dropped all the specific enumerations except 'business establishments' but added to the 
latter phrase the modifying words 'of every kind whatsoever.'"" Sullivan, 731 F. Supp. at 952. "
683,1," This Order summarizes in some detail the current status of these cases, including the claims and defenses of the [*60]  parties, 
but it does not contain a description or exhaustive catalogue of the evidentiary record. This Order also summarizes certain 
procedural history that may have an impact on the case post-remand. While the order states the legal theories of the plaintiffs 
and the legal defenses of the defendant, the failure to include other issues or evidence in this order (or any other omission) does 
not result in a waiver of either party's ability to raise issues, present evidence or seek action by the transferor court following 
remand. All positions preserved by any party in the transferee court continue to be preserved regardless of whether they are 
included or referred to in this Order. "
684,2," A second set of class action cases, the polyester polyols cases, also were transferred under MDL No. 1616, but were not 
consolidated with the polyether polyols cases. This Order does not concern the polyester polyol cases, which settled long ago."
684,3," These cases were assigned Civil Action Nos. 08-2617-JWL, 09-2026-JWL, and 10-2077-JWL, respectively, in the District of 
Kansas."
684,4, The named plaintiffs are specifically listed in the applicable second amended complaints.
684,5," Plaintiffs originally included claims through 2004, but plaintiffs subsequently limited their claims to 2003. While these actions 
originally named additional defendants and included claims under state and foreign law for purchases made in Europe, those 
claims and individuals were dismissed. Plaintiffs are not pursuing a claim related to polyether polyol systems. "
686,6," Both sides reserve their rights to challenge the factual contentions of the other, including with respect to the admissibility of the 
contentions, whether or not the other side's factual contentions are expressly rebutted herein."
686,7," Plaintiffs Vitafoam Canada, Ltd. and Woodbridge Foam Corporation purchased urethane products in the United States that 
were delivered to Canada. Plaintiffs allege that Dow and its co-conspirators' conduct had a direct, substantial, and reasonably 
foreseeable effect on U.S. commerce, and this domestic effect gives rise to Vitafoam Canada and Woodbridge Foam 
Corporation's claims. "
687,8," Jorge Burtin, the assignee of plaintiff Skypark's claims, testified that he was suspicious of lockstep price increase 
announcements prior to November 23, 2004; however, Burtin exercised due diligence. "
714,1," Defendants' motion initially encompassed state law claims brought by additional plaintiffs. However, the parties later stipulated 
to the dismissal of many plaintiffs' state law claims, leaving pending before the Court only those claims described above. See 
MDL Master Dkt. No. 8987. "
715,2," Plaintiffs argue that it is inappropriate to apply the AGC standard to the claims brought under California law because AGC has 
not been adopted as the law in California. Because the Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated antitrust standing under the 
AGC standard for purposes of federal law, even if the Court were to apply the AGC standard to plaintiffs' California claims, the "
716,," outcome would be unchanged. Therefore, the Court declines to decide whether the AGC standard is properly applied to claims 
arising under California law. "
728,1," This order incorporates the legal and factual discussions from the April 25, 2014, Order granting SanDisk's motion to dismiss, 
as well as SanDisk's Request for Judicial Notice which it referenced. Order 4 n.4. I will not repeat facts pleaded in the TAC 
identical to ones already recited in that Order. "
729,2, Other manufacturers include Memorex and Kingston. See TAC ¶ 177. 
731,3," In the Order, I said that I will disregard PNY's request that I declare that SanDisk's ""exclusive dealing arrangements"" violate 
Section 16720 of California's Cartwright Act because there is no cause of action being asserted under that statute. Order 7 n.5. 
The prayer for relief in the TAC still contains such a request. I will again disregard PNY's request that I declare that SanDisk's 
""exclusive dealing arrangements"" violate the Cartwright Act. "
732,4," PNY points out that SanDisk's agreement with Best Buy ""reveals no [ ] 'at will' termination provision. Opp'n 7 n.2 (citing Mot. 5 
n.5). However, as the agreement  [*17] states—and the TAC recognizes—Best Buy may cease carrying SanDisk products 
exclusively (apparently at any time during the term of the contract), at which point the marketing and markdown funding provided 
by SanDisk will be pro-rated. RJN Ex. 1 ¶ E; TAC ¶ 194."
732,5," PNY's brief asserts that PNY has ""made multiple attempts to outbid SanDisk, but retailers refused to even entertain PNY's 
offers."" Opp'n 9. The TAC does not allege that PNY has attempted to outbid SanDisk."
732,6," SanDisk points out that ""[t]o the extent PNY seeks to allege that SanDisk has offered retailers SD cards at below-cost prices 
(see TAC ¶¶ 168-69), the TAC does not plead any facts to support such a theory."" Mot. 3 n.3. PNY does not respond to this 
point."
732,7," SanDisk notes that BJ's, CVS, and Walgreens receive financial incentives from SanDisk, but PNY does not allege that these 
benefits create any ""disincentive"" for them. Mot. 5 (citing TAC ¶¶ 221-22, 227-28, 236,  [*20] 239). "
733,8," SanDisk also disputes PNY's allegations that SanDisk has coerced retailers into exclusive dealing arrangements, saying that 
PNY fails to plead any facts to support its allegations. Mot. 8. PNY rightly points out that coercion is not a necessary element of 
the claim, Opp'n 12 n.7, and SanDisk does not meaningfully respond. See Reply 6 n.15. Accordingly, there is no need to 
address this issue."
733,9," PNY does not allege that SanDisk engaged in predatory pricing, which may be actionable. See Cascade Health Solutions v. 
PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 901 (9th Cir. 2008)  [*23] (""in the normal case, above-cost pricing will not be considered 
exclusionary conduct for antitrust purposes"")."
733,10," For this reason, PNY's argument that ""retailers cannot afford to lose the incentives provided for in the agreements"" is 
unpersuasive. Opp'n 8. Any entity engaged in commerce will generally pick a better economic arrangement than a worse 
economic arrangement. The question is whether competition has been harmed, not just whether a competitor lost out on a deal. 
Similarly, it is of no moment that ""[r]etailers are typically required to return or forego large incentives if they violate [ ] the 
exclusivity provision"" in their contracts. Opp'n 8 n.5. That dynamic reflects the essence of a contractual exchange. Cf. Church & 
Dwight Co., Inc. v. Mayer Labs., Inc., 868 F. Supp. 2d 876, 903 (N.D. Cal. 2012)  [*25] (""The only consequence is that retailers 
may not receive a rebate based on"" their decision to not abide by an arrangement.), vacated in part on other grounds, No. 10-cv-
4429-EMC, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68681, 2012 WL 1745592 (N.D. Cal. May 16, 2012). Without adequately pleading facts "
734,," showing that the contracts unreasonably foreclose competition despite their short term and easy terminability, such contracts are 
not actionable under the antitrust laws."
734,11," PNY alleges that ""[t]here are many practical impediments to a retailer terminating an exclusive arrangement for SD cards,"" 
identifying as an example ""planogram cycles,"" for which a store determines its store product placement. TAC ¶ 181. PNY claims 
that ""the opportunity to introduce new products to a planogram comes up only at pre-planned intervals"" and ""[t]o the extent the 
end of an exclusive dealing agreement and the end of the planogram cycle do not align, it may not be possible for a competing 
seller of SD cards to persuade a retailer to terminate the exclusive arrangement."" Id. But PNY has not alleged that this has in 
fact happened or explained why easily terminable contracts do not mitigate any such ""impediment."" "
735,12," Indeed, Judge Chen reaffirmed that a plaintiff must still adequately plead foreclosure and the length of the agreements at 
issue to state a claim for exclusive dealing, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35969, [WL] at *15, and stated in another order  [*29] in the 
same case ""that where exclusive or semi-exclusive contracts are short in duration, easily terminable, incentive-based, and leave 
open alternative channels to competitors, they are not exclusionary,"" Church & Dwight Co., 868 F. Supp. 2d at 903."
735,13," Similarly, the plaintiff in Pro Search alleged that despite its superior products, the cost of switching from the defendant's 
products to another's was prohibitive despite the short duration and easy termination of the defendant's contracts. 2013 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 169856, 2013 WL 6229141, at *6. No similar allegation is present here. "
736,14," PNY again relies on Dentsply for the proposition that ""direct sales are insufficient"" to provide ""an effective means of 
competition."" Opp'n 11. I have already rejected PNY's reliance on Dentsply on that point in my Order and explained why it is 
distinguishable from the facts here even as pleaded in the TAC. Order 14."
736,15," SanDisk points out that the TAC shows that the prices for both PNY's and SanDisk's USB drives have actually remained 
steady at Best Buy. Reply 3 (citing TAC Table 18). SanDisk also persuasively argues that there is no basis for PNY's contention 
that SD cards and USB drives should be priced similarly simply because of their allegedly similar component costs, rather than 
based on supply and demand, and cites testimony from another case in which a PNY executive represented that ""firms set their 
prices [for USB drives] according to the market price rather than on their costs."" Reply 3 n.8 (quoting SanDisk Corp. v. Kingston 
Tech. Co., Inc., 863 F. Supp. 2d 815, 831 (W.D. Wis. 2012)). Finally, SanDisk points out that it does not set prices in retailers' 
stores—the retailers  [*36] do. Reply 3 n.4, 7 n.18. PNY has not alleged otherwise."
736,16," At the hearing, counsel for PNY noted that the alleged foreclosure in the SD card market is well over 30 percent. However, ""a 
high foreclosure rate does not necessarily tell us anything about how competitively a market is performing."" AREEDA & "
737,," HOVENKAMP ¶ 1820b, at 175. Rather, high numbers ""only encourage closer scrutiny based on factors"" such as contract duration 
and alternative distribution channels. Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of R.I., 373 F.3d 57, 68 (1st Cir. 
2004) (Boudin, J.); AREEDA & HOVENKAMP ¶ 1821d, at 197-209. For the reasons discussed in this order, those other factors do 
not weigh in PNY's favor."
737,17," For this  [*38] reason, PNY's assertion that ""SanDisk's exclusive dealing in the SD card market violates Section 1 of the 
Sherman Act and Section 3 of the Clayton Act because it has caused harm to competition in the form of supra-competitive 
prices"" is unavailing because the existence of supra-competitive prices does not, in itself, suggest foreclosure. There could be 
any number of reasons to explain why SD card prices at certain retailers may have stayed steady or risen, but needless to say,

whether a plaintiff must identify such parties by name. Id. n.11. Although not raised by the parties here, since Gieseke was 
decided after the hearing on the instant motions, the Court finds that J&M has sufficiently identified its dealers as the third parties

950,8," West Virginia, like Minnesota, has enacted statutes applicable to unfair competition in various different contexts, see, e.g., W. 
Va. Code Ann. §§ 33-11-4(3); Minn. Stat. § 325D.04. The Court does not address whether any such statutes might apply to the 
facts of this case, as Plaintiff does not assert a statutory unfair competition claim. "
955,1," ""There is a significant difference between asserting that a plaintiff cannot state a cause of action and asserting that a plaintiff 
has not stated a cause of action, and therein lies the distinction between the motion to dismiss and the motion to strike."" 
(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Pecan v. Madigan, 97 Conn.App. 617, 621, 905 A.2d 710 (2006), cert. 
denied, 281 Conn. 919, 918 A.2d 271 (2007). Arguably, certain of CRRA's arguments relative to Tremont's antitrust claim would 
be more appropriately made in the context of a motion to strike. In fact, at times, particularly in its reply memorandum, the 
defendant seems to conflate its argument for dismissal based on standing with an argument that Tremont has failed to state a 
claim under the Antitrust Act because it merely alleges legal conclusions as opposed to factual allegations that would support 
specific violation(s) of the Act. CRRA further argues that Tremont has failed to properly [*8]  identify the sections of the Antitrust 
Act upon which it relies. CRRA's reliance on Bridgeport Harbour Place I, LLC v. Ganim, 303 Conn. 205, 32 A.3d 296 (2011), a 
case that was based on the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's amended complaint on the ground that it failed to allege an 
antitrust injury, highlights what appears to be a merging by CRRA of the distinct purposes of a motion to dismiss and a motion to 
strike. "
971,1," In a decision issued today, the Ninth Circuit has clarified that the FTAIA ""is not a subject-matter jurisdiction limitation on the

972,2," Almost in passing, defendants point out that Acer America's federal claims are barred by the ""bright line"" rule of Illinois Brick 
that indirect purchasers cannot recover. Plaintiffs do not contest that point, and it shall therefore be deemed that the complaint 
does not seek recovery under federal law for indirect purchases by any of the remaining plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' further argument that 
their state law claims would survive even if the FTAIA bars any part of their federal claims is not compelling. See SRAM, 2010 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141968, 2010 WL 5477313, at *4 (rejecting the argument that ""the FTAIA does not apply to ... state law claims""

Gen. of Tex. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 687 S.W.2d 803, 805-06 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.). In that case. the court held 
that an insurance company is not exempt from the Attorney General's investigative authority on the ground that it falls within the 
""business of insurance"" exemption to federal antitrust law. However, in that case, the court also relied on the boycott exception 
to the exemption given in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, finding that because the Attorney General was investigating a potential 
boycott, the exemption did not apply. The court did not address how a suit filed by a private plaintiff would be affected by Section 
15.05(g). The court assumes that an insurance company is not exempt from scrutiny under the Texas Free Enterprise and 
Antitrust Act based on Section 15.05(g)."
981,28," Under federal law, if the an exclusive dealing arrangement involves a good or other physical commodity, the arrangement can 
be challenged under either Section 1 of the Sherman Act or Section 3 of the Clayton Act, but if an exclusive dealing arrangement

994,*," The Honorable  [**5] Virginia M. Kendall, District Judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by 
designation."
994,1," TFT-LCD, which is an abbreviation for Thin-Film-Transistor Liquid-Crystal Display, is a display technology used in flat panel 
computer monitors, notebook computers, flat panel televisions, and other devices. A ""TFT display"" is ""[a] display using a 
refinement of LCD technology in which each liquid-crystal cell, or pixel, is controlled by three separate transistors, one each for 
red, blue, and green."" Stephen Kleinedler (ed.), Dictionary of Computer and Internet Words: An A to Z Guide to Hardware, 
Software, and Cyberspace  [**6] 270 (2001)."
994,2, Seven other individuals who are not parties to this appeal were named as coconspirators in the operative indictment. 
996,3," Hsiung and Chen raise the issue of improper venue; however, all of the defendants adopt by reference and join in all 
arguments raised by their co-defendants for purposes of this appeal.  [**14] See Fed. R. App. P. 28(i). "
998,4," We note that we would reach the same conclusion if the defendants' conduct  [**21] were characterized as forfeiture subject to 
plain error review. See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993); United States v. 
Perez, 116 F.3d 840, 846-48 (9th Cir. 1997) (en banc). ""The Supreme Court mandated a four-part inquiry to determine whether 
an error may be corrected under Rule 52(b): (1) there must be error; (2) it must be plain; and (3) it must affect substantial rights. 
Even after a reviewing court finds plain error under this three-part rubric, relief remains discretionary under Olano's fourth and 
final requirement. The Court of Appeals should correct a plain forfeited error affecting substantial rights if the error seriously 
affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings."" Perez, 116 F.3d at 846 (internal quotation marks 
omitted). No plain error resulted from the jury instruction because neither the Supreme Court nor this court has determined that 
Morrison overruled Hartford Fire. See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 467-68, 117 S. Ct. 1544, 137 L. Ed. 2d 718 
(1997). "
1001,5," In light of our holding and Supreme Court precedent, we cannot embrace the defendants' argument that adopting a per se 
standard violates the fair notice principle of the Due Process Clause. "
1002,6," A number of courts have referred to the FTAIA as jurisdictional, but did so prior to the Supreme Court's decisions in Reed 
Elsevier and Morrison and without analyzing whether the FTAIA concerns subject-matter jurisdiction or the scope of coverage of 
antitrust laws. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 326 F.3d 1319, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 2003); Dee-K Enters., Inc. v. Heveafil 
Sdn. Bhd, 299 F.3d 281, 287 (4th Cir. 2002); Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap As v. HeereMac Vof, 241 F.3d 420, 429-30 (5th Cir. 
2001); Nippon Paper Indus. Co., 109 F.3d at 3-4; see also Carrier Corp. v. Outokumpu Oyj, 673 F.3d 430, 439 n.4 (6th Cir. 
2012) (""sav[ing] the resolution of this issue for another day"" post-Morrison). "
1004,7," The Third Circuit also addressed the import trade exclusion, holding that it applies to importers and to defendants whose 
""conduct is directed at a U.S. import market,"" even if the defendants did not engage in importation of products into the United 
States. Animal Sci. Prods., 654 F.3d at 471 & n.11. We need not determine the outer bounds of import trade by considering 
whether commerce directed at, but not consummated within, an import market is also outside the scope of the FTAIA's import 
provisions because at least a portion of the transactions here involves the heartland situation of the direct importation of foreign 
goods into the United  [**44] States. See id. "
1007,8," We note that the Second Circuit recently disagreed with this definition of ""direct."" See Lotes,     F.3d    , 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 
10521, 2014 WL 2487188, at *13-16  [**55] (""Interpreting 'direct' to require only a reasonably proximate causal nexus""). It is not 
necessary to address this disagreement because we do not rely on the direct effects exception in affirming the convictions."
1007,9," We note that the meaning of ""direct effect"" under the FTAIA was addressed recently in Motorola Mobility LLC v. AU Optronics 
Corp., 746 F.3d 842 (7th Cir. 2014),  [**56] reh'g granted and opinion vacated (July 1, 2014). However, soon after the opinion 
was issued, the Seventh Circuit vacated the opinion and set the case for rehearing. Order, Motorola Mobility LLC v. AU 
Optronics Corp., No. 14-8003, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 12704 (7th Cir. July 1, 2014). As a consequence, we do not address the 
substance of the original opinion. "
1008,10," AUO also points to the legislative history, a comment from the Sentencing Guidelines, and the rule of lenity. Because the text 
of the statute is unambiguous, we stop with the text and do not refer to extrinsic sources to divine its meaning. See O'Donnell, 
608 F.3d at 555. "
1057,1," Originally, the complaint named only two Plaintiffs: Robert DeMars and Lorena Barrios. See Docket No. 1 at ¶ 27-28. The 
second amended complaint names five more: Pedro Marti, David Nisenbaum, Nicholas Anderson, Matthew Villani, and Scott 
McCullough. See  [**3] Docket No. 68 at ¶¶ 25-31."
1057,2, See Docket No. 1.
1057,3," Unless otherwise noted, all facts are drawn from the operative complaint and the docket records in this case. Plaintiffs' motion 
to strike the declaration of Silva Reyes is GRANTED, as a court is to decide a motion to dismiss based only on the complaint, 
and documents properly subject to judicial notice. See Lee v. Cty. Of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001). Plaintiffs 
dispute the authenticity of the 2009 Mobile Privacy Policy, see Docket No. 77 at 2, rendering judicial notice of the document 
unsuitable. See Fed. R. Evid. 203. Because Plaintiffs do not contest the authenticity of the 2008 Mobile Privacy Policy submitted 
as Exhibit A to the Request for Judicial Notice, see Docket No. 76 at 2, the court will consider that document."

conflated this test, in whole or in part, with the doctrine of antitrust standing. See, e.g., Gulfstream III Associates, Inc. v. 
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 995 F.2d 425, 429 (3d Cir. 1993) (""In Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477,

plaintiffs were found to lack ""standing"" where their loss could not be causally connected to defendants antitrust activities). 
Although formulations of the Brunswick rule may differ, the Third Circuit, other Circuits, and commentators have recognized that 
Brunswick's concern is ""centered on antitrust injury,"" see Alberta Gas, 826 F.2d at 1240, and is ""analytically distinct"" from the 
doctrine of antitrust standing. See Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 728 n.7 (""the question of which persons have been injured by an 
illegal overcharge for purposes of s 4 is analytically distinct from the question of which persons have sustained injuries 
 [**59] too remote to give them standing to sue for damages under § 4""); see also Cordes & Co. Fin. Services, Inc. v. A.G. 
Edwards & Sons, Inc., 502 F.3d 91, 95 (2d Cir. 2007) (""The antitrust injury element raises both factual questions related to

injury to the plaintiff, (3) that flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful, and (4) that is of the type the antitrust laws were 
intended to prevent.'""); Page, Scope of Liability at 1459-60 (""most courts have recognized that Brunswick announced a general 
principle that requires every treble damages plaintiff to show that his harm is related to the anticompetitive aspect of the 
defendant's conduct. Among these decisions, there are  [**60] dubious and incorrect applications of the principle, but the 
principle remains.""). In practical terms, this means that even if a plaintiff can show both that it has suffered antitrust injury and 
that its damages flow from that injury, as Brunswick requires, it still must prove it is the most proper party to enforce § 4's private 
right of action. "

standing concerns: HN51[

and because the injunctive remedy is a more flexible and adaptable tool for enforcing the antitrust laws than the damage 
remedy...."" Schoenkopf v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 637 F.2d 205, 210 (3d Cir.1980). Most importantly, 
""because standing under § 16 raises no threat of multiple lawsuits or duplicative recoveries [i.e. the concerns voiced in 
Illinois Brick ], some of the factors other than antitrust injury that are appropriate to a determination of standing under § 4

alleged (and ultimately proved) an 'injury in fact'—a harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent, not 
'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.' Second, there must be causation—a fairly traceable connection between the plaintiffs injury and 
the complained-of conduct of the defendant. And third, there must be redressability—a likelihood that the requested relief will 
redress the alleged injury. This triad of injury in fact, causation, and redressability constitutes the core of Article III's case-or-

not proceed when '[o]ther relevant factors—the nature of the [claimant's] injury, the tenuous and speculative character of the 
relationship between the alleged antitrust violation and the [claimant's] alleged injury, the potential for duplicative recovery or 
complex apportionment of damages, and the existence of more direct victims of the alleged conspiracy—weigh heavily against 
judicial enforcement.'"" (quoting ACG, 459 U.S. at 545, internal citation omitted); Laumann v. Nat'l Hockey League, 907 F. Supp.

test. First, a "" 'plaintiff must show ... injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which

factors: (1) the directness or indirectness of the asserted injury; (2) the existence of an identifiable class of persons whose self-
interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust enforcement; (3) the speculativeness of the

specifically arising under the antitrust laws. See id. Shortly after Gulfstream was decided, the Third Circuit clarified that for an

must be ""unambiguous and all-inclusive."" See Lerman v. Joyce Intern., Inc., 10 F.3d 106, 112 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that an

ECF Nos. 133-142. There, Defendants submit: Resco simply asserts it ""primarily purchases magnesite through brokers"" and relies on an assignment from Possehl (US) to 
bring this action. This simple assertion fails, however, as there is no evidence that Possehl (US) ever purchased magnesite 
directly from any Defendant or alleged co-conspirator on which to base an assignment of a direct purchaser antitrust claim 
for damages. While another entity, Possehl (HK), actually purchased magnesite from Defendants (evidenced by contracts 
produced to Plaintiffs by Defendants), including presumably on behalf of Resco as brokered by Possehl (US), there is no 
allegation or evidence that Possehl (HK) assigned any U.S. antitrust claims (assuming it has any) to Resco. Def. Supp. Brief MTCA, 137 at 4 (internal citations omitted)."

antitrust standing. See id. at 4 (""Direct purchasers have antitrust standing; mere brokers do not.""). While I agree that a broker is 
not equivalent to a purchaser for purposes of determining  [**119] antitrust standing, Possehl (US)'s role as a broker does not 
necessarily preclude it from also acting as a purchaser. Defendants are correct, however, that Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly 
plead this critical factual link."

1133,28," In Minn-Chem, Inc. v. Agrium, Inc., 683 F.3d 845 (7th Cir. 2012), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals takes issue with the 
label ""import exception"" reasoning that the import trade or import commerce that is excluded from the purview of the FTAIA by 
the parenthetical in the statute's chapeau (prefatory language)—"" Sections 1 to 7 of this title . . . shall not apply to conduct "
1134,," involving trade or commerce (other than import trade or import commerce) with foreign nations unless . . .""—is ""pure import 
commerce—that is the kind of commerce that is not subject to the special rules created by the FTAIA,"" whereas foreign conduct 
that has a ""direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable effect . . . on import trade or import commerce with foreign nations"" 
does constitute an exception to the FTAIA. See id. at 853-55. According to the Min-Chem court, Although some, including the Third Circuit in Animal Science, have referred to [the parenthetical ""other than import trade or 
import commerce"" in the chapeau] as the ""import exception,"" that is not an accurate description. Import trade and 
commerce are excluded at the outset from the coverage  [**146] of the FTAIA in the same way that domestic interstate 
commerce is excluded. This means only that conduct in both domestic and import trade is subject to the Sherman Act's 
general requirements for effects on commerce, not to the special requirements spelled out in the FTAIA. Where the FTAIA 
does apply, it ""remov[es] from the Sherman Act's reach ... commercial activities taking place abroad, unless those activities 
adversely affect ... imports to the United States Id. at 854 (internal quotations and citation omitted). See also In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 904 F. Supp. 2d 310, 2012 WL 
5839303 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 16, 2012) (""there are two types of Sherman Act claims that implicate import trade or import commerce 
which fall outside the scope of the FTAIA. The first is the 'import trade or commerce' parenthetical, which provides that the 
antitrust law shall apply to conduct 'involving' import trade or commerce with foreign nations. I shall refer to this exception as 
""the import exception."" The second is that the FTAIA brings back within the reach of the Sherman Act conduct involving 
nonimport trade or nonimport commerce when that conduct (1) has a direct, substantial, and foreseeable effect  [**147] on 
import trade or import commerce, and (2) the Sherman Act claim arises out of that effect. I shall refer to this exception as the 
""domestic effects exception."") (internal citations, quotations and punctuation omitted). Semantics aside, it is clear that the 
Sherman Act does apply to both ""conduct involving import trade or import commerce"" (which I will continue to refer to as the 
""import exception"") and foreign conduct that has a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect on import trade or commerce (which 
falls into the ""effects"" exception)."
1134,29," The ""effects"" exception encapsulates the following statutory language: [The Sherman Act] shall not apply to conduct involving trade or commerce . . . with foreign nations unless— (1) such conduct has a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect— (A) on trade or commerce which is not trade or commerce with foreign nations, or on import trade or import commerce with 
foreign nations; or (B) on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in such trade or commerce in the United 
States; and (2) such effects give rise to a claim under the provisions of sections 1 to 7 of [The Sherman Act] . . . ."
1134,15," U.S.C. § 6a.  [**148] It thus provides for application of the Sherman Act if the defendants' conduct has a ""direct, substantial

nations""); or (3) American export commerce (""on export trade or export commerce with foreign nations, of a person engaged in

1161,2," In considering the FTC's preclusion motion, I have also considered and  [**8] rejected Cephalon's argument that the FTC's 
case became moot upon the entry of generic Provigil competition in 2012. ""A case becomes moot only when it is impossible for 
a court to grant 'any effectual relief whatever' to the prevailing party."" Knox v. Serv. Emps. Intl. Union, 567 U.S. 298, 132 S. Ct. 
2277, 2287, 183 L. Ed. 2d 281 (2012) (quoting Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 287, 120 S. Ct. 1382, 146 L. Ed. 2d 265 
(2000)). To take just one form of relief the FTC says it may pursue, Cephalon argues that the Court ""should deny the FTC's 
belated request for monetary relief"" because: (1) the FTC did not include a specific prayer for disgorgement in its complaint, (2) 
the FTC has often stated that it did not intend to seek monetary relief, and (3) an FTC policy statement in place for most of this 
litigation (though now withdrawn) would have counseled against seeking equitable monetary relief. These arguments address 
only the propriety of certain relief, not the Court's power to grant it. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 
68-69, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997) (holding that a claim for nominal damages against the state under 42 U.S.C. § 
1983 did not save case from mootness because § 1983 creates no cause of action against a state). Cephalon may or may 
 [**9] not be right that the FTC is not entitled to any of the relief it currently seeks. But to try to answer this question on a motion 
challenging the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction ""confuses mootness with the merits."" Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 133 S. 
Ct. 1017, 1024, 185 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2013); see also Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 500, 89 S. Ct. 1944, 23 L. Ed. 2d 491 
(1969) (holding that claim for backpay saved case from mootness, despite argument that the claim was brought in the wrong 
court and thus the requested relief could not be ordered). "
1162,3," A more detailed discussion of the regulatory landscape that forms the backdrop for this case can be found in the Actavis 
decision, 133 S. Ct. 2223, 2227-29, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013), and in my earlier opinion denying Cephalon's motions to dismiss 
the complaints, King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 702 F. Supp. 2d 514, 519-21 (E.D. Pa. 2010). "
1165,4," Cephalon advances two arguments for the proposition that, even after Therasense, inequitable conduct is a lesser offense than 
fraud. These arguments are unpersuasive. First, Cephalon contends that fraud can only be proven with a showing of intent that 
is completely separate from materiality, while intent for inequitable conduct purposes may be inferred from materiality. (Br. of 
Ceph. 43.) Therasense rejected this position. Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1290 (""[A] court must weigh the evidence of intent to 
deceive independent of its analysis of materiality."") Second, Cephalon argues that materiality for inequitable conduct purposes is 
evaluated with a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, while such proof in fraud cases must be clear and convincing. (Br. of 
Ceph. 45.) This is true but irrelevant here. Apotex, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125859, 2011 WL 6090696, at *25. In addition to 
finding that Cephalon omitted key information with the intent to deceive, I also concluded that the same information invalidated 
the patent on several grounds. Because invalidity must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, where undisclosed 
information invalidates  [**22] the patent in district court, that information is necessarily material for the purposes of a fraud 
analysis. See Dippin' Dots, Inc. v. Mosey, 476 F.3d 1337, 1344-45, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (concluding that undisclosed sales 
rendered patent invalid for obviousness, and that same sales proved materiality for Walker Process purposes); Cornucopia 
Prods., LLC v. Dyson, Inc., 881 F. Supp. 2d 1086, 1100 (D. Ariz. 2012) (""Materiality [for Walker Process purposes] is generally 
established by showing that omitted or misrepresented prior art (or other relevant information) would have required the examiner 
to reject the application.""). In sum, my findings in the Apotex litigation, made consistent with the Therasense standards for 
inequitable conduct, supply the necessary determinations, to establish fraud on the PTO by clear and convincing evidence. "
1166,5," The FTC, as well as the Direct Purchaser Class Plaintiffs, have moved to strike these statements from Cephalon's opposition, 
or to compel the attorney-client privileged advice on which they are based. Given that they do not change my analysis here, and 
that consideration of these specific statements was unnecessary to my decision on the Direct Purchasers' preclusion motion, I 
will deny both motions as moot."
1166,6," The FTC does not discuss the imputation of knowledge issue in its separate brief, but does incorporate the arguments made by 
the Direct Purchasers in their preclusion motion. (Br. of FTC 7 n.4.) Cephalon responded to both of those motions in a 
consolidated opposition. "
1167,7," It is important to stress the distinction between my earlier ruling and this one. In concluding that Cephalon's Seventh 
Amendment right to a jury trial precluded the application of collateral estoppel to my earlier inequitable conduct finding, I did not 
rely on the fact that Therasense had changed the standards for inequitable conduct after Cephalon had tried its patent case. 
Instead, beginning from the largely undisputed premise that Cephalon had a right to have a jury determine fraud in the antitrust 
trial, I analyzed whether Cephalon had waived that right by failing to object on Seventh Amendment grounds at the time Apotex 
sought bifurcation and an earlier bench trial on inequitable conduct. King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 2014 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 32508, 2014 WL 982848, at *7 (E.D. Pa. March 13, 2014). I held that it had not, because case law at the time of 
bifurcation made clear that inequitable conduct (not in itself relevant to the antitrust cases) was  [**31] a lesser offense than 
fraud on the PTO (potentially relevant to the antitrust cases). Because a finding of inequitable conduct at the time of bifurcation 
would not have been binding in the subsequent antitrust trials, I concluded that Cephalon's failure to raise the issue did not 
amount to waiver. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32508, [WL] at *10."
1167,8," Given my determination that collateral estoppel applies, I need not consider here the FTC's alternative argument that the 
undisputed facts are sufficient  [**32] to hold the RE '516 patent invalid. "

Cox Enterprises illegally forced customers to rent a set-top box in order to gain full access to its premium cable services in 
violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. In re Cox Enterprises is distinguishable [*9]  from the present case. Unlike the

circumstance as a per se violation?"" Procaps' counsel advised that he was ""not aware of a case where the chronology of "
1189,," events is that something began as a lawful restraint, but because of a fundamental change in the nature of one of the parties to 
the restraint becomes a per se unlawful market allocation."" His explanation continued: ""And I would say as well that I am not 
aware of any case that says that when that occurs, the per se rule doesn't apply. Neither side has identified a case like that."" 
[ECF No. 487, p. 15 (emphasis added)]. Procaps' counsel also noted that ""I can't cite a case that shows the chronology we 
have here ..."" [Id. at p. 16 (emphasis added)]. The Court asked Patheon's counsel the same question, albeit phrased in slightly 
different  [**23] words: ""How do the courts deal with that, where you have a contract that the parties say is legal at the beginning 
and then there's a change of circumstance? How do you evaluate that?"" Patheon's counsel confirmed that the parties could not 
pinpoint a published case involving this type of changed circumstance scenario: ""The first answer to the question is, no, there is 
no case specifically on point for the facts."" [Id. at p. 17 (emphasis added)]."

question."" In re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litig., No. 2:13-CV-20000-RDP, 26 F. Supp. 3d 1172, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

for the rule that horizontal market  [**36] divisions are examples of per se illegality because they are business relationships ""that, 
in the court's experience, virtually always stifle competition""). Topco is the 40-year-old seminal case that stands for the rule that 
allocating territories to minimize competition at the retail level is a horizontal restraint constituting a per se violation of section 1

over if they are not allowed to try it as a per se case."" 703 F.3d at 1006. In contrast, Procaps has advised the Court that it will still

1196,8," Procaps' ability to effectively pursue the case  [**50] under the rule of reason approach using Patheon's unassailable market 
definitions is beyond the scope of this Order."
1196,9, The existence or degree of such alleged exclusion is not before the Court at the summary judgment stage. 
1200,10," Although Procaps now alleges that Patheon misused Procaps' confidential information by using it to internally review the 
proposed Banner acquisition before the deal closed, that theory appears nowhere in Count V or in Procaps' summary judgment 
briefs. Procaps raised this theory in its proposed summary judgment order. HN23[
] To assert a new claim at the summary 
judgment stage, the proper procedure is to amend the complaint — not argue it in a brief opposing a summary judgment motion. 
Gilmour v. Gates, McDonald & Co., 382 F.3d 1312, 1314-15 (11th Cir. 2004). This rule not only applies to legal claims, but to

710 F.3d 1221, 1227-28 (11th Cir. 2013). Consequently, Procaps cannot advance this new theory and facts now. Moreover, even if the Court were to consider this new theory, the Court does not find it persuasive because Procaps' confidential 
 [**63] information was not the material considered. Procaps' allegation is that Patheon reviewed P-Gels pricing in reviewing the 
Banner acquisition. P-Gels is the product the parties jointly introduced into the marketplace as part of their collaboration. [ECF 
Nos. 333, ¶ 6; 335, ¶ 2]. As the Court has previously noted, because P-Gels was jointly introduced, the information surrounding 
it, including pricing information, cannot be ""specific or proprietary to Procaps only. Rather, it is relevant to Patheon and Procaps."" 
[ECF No. 505, p. 4]. As a result, Procaps' new theory fails. "

issue in this case. See Oral Arg. Tr. 42, Mar. 20, 2014. "
1206,6," In Count Two, SHS alleges a bundling claim pursuant to § 1 of the Sherman Act. Bundling is the practice of offering, for a 
single price, two or more goods or services that could be sold separately, and a bundled discount occurs when a firm sells the 
bundle for a lower price than it charges for the goods or services purchased individually. See Cascade Health Solutions v. 
PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 894 (9th Cir. 2008); see also LePage's Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141, 154 (3d Cir. 2003) (en banc). 
Although bundled discounts generally benefit buyers by allowing them to get more for less, it is possible ""for a firm to use a 
bundled discount to exclude an equally or more efficient competitor and thereby reduce consumer welfare in the long run."" 
Cascade Health Solutions, 515 F.3d at 896 (citations omitted). A competitor who sells only a part of the bundle—in this case 
sutures and endo products—might not be able to match profitably  [*17] the price created by the bundled discount. See id. SHS alleges Defendants unlawfully bundle sutures and endo distribution services with other med-surg distribution services. 
Customers wishing to purchase med-surg products other than sutures and endo products from the Defendants are forced to pay 
an enhanced distribution fee, and in order to compete effectively, Defendants' competitors would have to sell suture and endo 
distribution services at a loss. SHS asserts Defendants have no procompetitive reason for engaging in such actions, and these 
actions have produced anticompetitive effects, including artificially inflating prices for sutures and endo distribution services for 
all consumers. Because SHS has alleged facts sufficient to support its claim that Defendants have violated § 1 of the Sherman 
Act by bundling, the Court will deny the motion to dismiss as to Count Two."
1206,7," In Count Five, SHS alleges Defendants have participated in exclusive dealing in violation of § 3 of the Clayton Act. SHS claims 
Defendants sell med-surg distribution services based on the condition the purchaser will not purchase sutures and endo "
1207,," distribution services from Defendants' competitors, and this exclusive  [*18] dealing has foreclosed competitors from the suture 
and endo products distribution services market. SHS also alleges Defendants' contracts are difficult to terminate, and thus exist 
for long terms. ""An exclusive dealing arrangement is an agreement in which a buyer agrees to purchase certain goods or services only from a 
particular seller for a certain period of time."" ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 270 (3d Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). 
Oftentimes exclusive dealing arrangements are entered into for procompetitive reasons; therefore, the legality of such 
agreements is judged under the rule of reason and depends on whether the arrangement ""will foreclose competition in such a 
substantial share of the relevant market so as to adversely affect competition."" Id. at 271; see also Tampa Elec. Co. v. Nashville 
Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 327-29, 81 S. Ct. 623, 5 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1961). To be unlawful, the arrangement must ""substantially 
lessen competition, rather than merely disadvantage rivals."" ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 271. It is plausible Defendants' contracts qualify as unlawful exclusive dealing, even if the exclusive terms are not explicitly stated in 
the contracts themselves. First, O&M and Cardinal allegedly  [*19] have 39% and 33% of the market for sutures and endo 
distribution services, respectively. SHS asserts Defendants have entered into the challenged contracts ""with at least a majority of 
acute care providers,"" or, at the very least, half of their customers, which could be 19.5% and 16.5% of the relevant market. Am. 
Compl. ¶ 54; Oral Arg. Tr. 67-68, Mar. 20, 2014. Thus, the potential degree to which Defendants' actions foreclose competitors 
from the suture and endo distribution services market is significant and may violate the Clayton Act. See Am. Motor Inns, Inc. v. 
Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230, 1252 (3d Cir. 1975) (finding that in light of the fact the defendant was the largest hotel-motel 
group in the country, an agreement which foreclosed defendant's competitors from 14.7% of the market ""may well offend the 
limitations which the Clayton Act places on exclusive contracts""). In addition, a number of factors are relevant to the 
determination whether an exclusive dealing arrangement forecloses a substantial part of the market; it is not simply a qualitative 
analysis of market power. See ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 271. For example, exclusivity arrangements need not be expressly stated 
 [*20] in a contract; instead, courts must ""ascertain the relationship between the parties and the effect of the agreement 'in the 
real world.'"" Id. at 270. Therefore, even though Defendants' contracts might not explicitly exclude customers from buying 
supplies from competitors, the real world effect may be to do just that. Further, the Clayton Act is not limited to contracts that 
completely exclude the purchase of a competitor's goods. See id. at 283. Given these factors, the Court cannot decide at this 
stage that the contracts at issue do not involve exclusive dealing, and this claim will not be dismissed."
1207,8," In Count Six, SHS alleges Defendants have tied med-surg distribution services other than sutures and endo distribution 
services (tying products) to the purchase of sutures and endo distribution services (tied products), in violation of § 1 of the 
Sherman Act. A tying arrangement is ""an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also 
purchases a different (or tied) product, or agrees that he will not purchase that product from any other supplier."" N. Pac. Ry. Co. 
v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6, 78 S. Ct. 514, 2 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1958). When the seller maintains a monopolistic position  [*21] in 
the market for the tying product and if a substantial volume of commerce in the tied product is restrained, a tying arrangement is 
per se illegal. See Times-Picayune Pub. Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 608-09, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953). If the 
defendant's lack of market power in the tying product prevents a plaintiff from establishing per se illegality of a tying 
arrangement, the defendant's conduct may still be unlawful under a rule of reason analysis. See Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 
2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 17-18, 104 S. Ct. 1551, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2 (1984), abrogated on other grounds by Ill. Tool Works Inc. v. 
Indep. Ink, Inc., 547 U.S. 28, 126 S. Ct. 1281, 164 L. Ed. 2d 26 (2006); see also Burtch v. Milberg Factors, Inc., 662 F.3d 212, 
221-22 (3d Cir. 2011). The Sherman Act does not prohibit ""tying,"" it prohibits ""contracts . . . in restraint of trade."" Jefferson 
Parish, 466 U.S. at 22 n.34. Thus, ""[t]he legality of petitioners' conduct depends on its competitive consequences, not whether it 
can be labeled 'tying.'"" Id. In this case, SHS has not alleged Defendants' market share in the market for med-surg distribution services excluding sutures 
and endo distribution services, stating only that each Defendant possess ""appreciable power"" in this market. Am. Compl.  [*22] ¶ 
138. Assuming the Defendants possess similar shares in that market as they do in the med-surg distribution services market 
generally (39% for O&M and 33% for Cardinal), then Defendants individually do not have the requisite market power to render 
the discount program per se illegal. However, SHS can still advance its claim under a rule of reason standard by demonstrating 
an actual adverse effect on competition in the sutures and endo distribution services market and an injury cognizable by the 
antitrust laws. See Town Sound & Custom Tops, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 959 F.2d 468, 482 (3d Cir. 1992). SHS has 
properly pled such an adverse effect because it claims that the Defendants' discount program has raised prices for all med-surg 
products. See, e.g., Am Compl. ¶¶ 90, 94. Defendants point out that SHS is free to buy from other competitors, and if the buyer in an arrangement is ""free to take either 
product by itself there is no tying problem even though the seller may also offer the two items as a unit at a single price."" N. Pac. "
1208,," Ry. Co., 356 U.S. at 6; see also Warren Gen. Hosp. v. Amgen Inc., No. 09-4935, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56220, 2010 WL 
2326254, at *7 (D.N.J. June 7, 2010), aff'd, 643 F.3d 77 (3d Cir. 2011).  [*23] However, an illegal tying arrangement can exist if 
purchasing the items together is the ""only viable economic option."" Amerinet, Inc. v. Xerox Corp., 972 F.2d 1483, 1500 (8th Cir. 
1992) (quoting Nobel Scientific Indus., Inc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 670 F. Supp. 1313, 1324 (D. Md. 1986), aff'd, 831 F.2d 
537 (4th Cir. 1987)); see also Compuware Corp. v. Int'l Bus. Machines Corp., 366 F. Supp. 2d 475, 480 (E.D. Mich. 2005). In the 
absence of a formal agreement, a plaintiff can still establish a tie-in was involved by ""proof that purchase of one product, the tied 
product, was not voluntary, i.e., by proof of coercion."" Ungar v. Dunkin' Donuts of Am., Inc., 531 F.2d 1211, 1224 (3d Cir. 1976). 
Here, SHS alleges purchasers have been coerced into buying products they might have preferred to purchase elsewhere 
because Defendants' bundles are structured and priced so customers have no sound economic alternative but to accept the 
offer. Am. Compl. ¶ 58. The Court finds these circumstances could plausibly amount to coercion. The Court has serious doubts about the viability of SHS's tying claim in light of the fact the arrangement is not per se illegal 
given the Defendants' market power and  [*24] the fact consumers can purchase the tying and tied products separately. This 
issue, however, is better addressed at the summary judgment stage."
1208,9," The Court will address Counts Three and Four of the Amended Complaint involving allegations of conspiracy or concerted 
action before turning to the substantive monopolization claim, which relies in part on the sufficiency of the conspiracy allegations."
1208,10," Specifically, to prevail on a § 1 conspiracy claim, the plaintiff must allege ""(1) concerted action by the defendants; (2) that 
produced anti-competitive effects within the relevant product and geographic markets; (3) . . . the concerted actions were illegal; 
and (4) [the plaintiff] was injured as a proximate result of the concerted action."" Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., 423 F.3d 184, 207 
(3d Cir. 2005); see also Howard Hess, 602 F.3d at 253. To prevail on a § 2 conspiracy claim, a plaintiff must establish ""(1) an 
agreement to monopolize; (2) an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy; (3) a specific intent to monopolize; and (4) a causal 
connection between the conspiracy and the injury alleged."" Howard Hess, 602 F.3d at 253 (citing Am. Tobacco Co. v. United 
States, 328 U.S. 781, 788, 809, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946)) (second citation omitted). "
1209,11," See Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 322 (explaining that ""Twombly aligns the pleading standard with the summary judgment 
standard in at least one important way: Plaintiffs relying on circumstantial evidence of an agreement must make a showing at 
both stages (with well-pled allegations and evidence of record, respectively) of something more than merely parallel behavior 
and something plausibly suggest[ive of] (not merely consistent with) agreement"" (internal citations and quotation marks 
omitted)). "
1210,12," SHS does allege that five representatives from Cardinal spoke at a 2012 conference and ""[b]oth companies are slated to 
attend the 2013 conference in Washington, D.C."" Am. Compl. ¶ 71. The fact that one of the Defendants' representatives spoke 
at a conference and representatives from both Defendants might have attended a conference in 2013 does not render it 
plausible the Defendants ""got together and exchanged assurances of common action."" Flat Glass, 385 F.3d at 361. "
1211,13," In Count One, SHS alleges unlawful monopolization or attempted monopolization in the sutures and endo distribution services 
market. As explained above, in the Amended Complaint, SHS provided the Court with Defendants' market shares of the overall 
med-surg distribution services market including sutures and endo distribution services (39% for O&M and 33% for Cardinal), but 
also asserts ""[u]pon information and belief, Defendants possess similar shares in the sutures and endo distribution services 
market with respect to acute care providers."" Am Compl. ¶ 17."
1211,14," SHS admitted at oral argument that if the Court did not accept a shared monopoly theory and the Court did not find a 
conspiracy (which would allow for aggregation of the shares), then ""we wouldn't have a § 2 claim at all."" Oral  [*38] Arg. Tr. 61, 
Mar. 20, 2014. As the District of Kansas explained in dismissing SE's § 2 claims against these same Defendants, most courts 
have rejected a shared or joint monopoly argument when analyzing § 2 claims because such claims contradict the basic concept 
that a monopoly is the domination of a market by a single firm. See Suture Express, Inc. v. Cardinal Health 200, LLC, 963 F. 
Supp. 2d 1212, 1227 (D. Kan. 2013). This Court similarly rejects a shared or joint monopoly argument."
1211,15," SHS describes these barriers to entry in the distribution services field as ""high fixed costs, high risk of failure in the business 
development process, and difficult regulatory hurdles,"" along with the fact that ""[p]roviding Med-Surg distribution services 
requires substantial investment in a distribution network and regulatory compliance."" Am. Compl. ¶ 43. SHS also asserts 
Defendants' discount program creates a barrier to entry. Id. ¶ 93. "

1259,2," Lenox also argues that we cannot consider res judicata because Medtronic did not file a cross-appeal. We need not address 
this argument. "
1260,3," The district court concluded that Lenox had failed to show antitrust injury. Appellant's App. (unsealed) at 195, 198. Attacking 
this conclusion, Lenox argues that it could have incurred an antitrust injury even if competition had not been lessened. 
Appellant's Opening Br. at 63 (Oct. 2, 2013); see 15 U.S.C. § 15(a) (2012) (authorizing recovery for persons injured in their 
""business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws""). Responding, Medtronic argues that harm to 
competition must be proven either as a part of antitrust standing or as an element of the Sherman Act claims. Appellee's 
Response Br. at 51 n.18 (Dec. 2, 2013). For the sake of argument, we may assume that Medtronic is correct. Thus, for purposes 
of our opinion, we assume that Lenox had to prove harm to competition either as a part of antitrust standing or as an element of 
the Sherman Act. "

1262,7," At oral argument, defense counsel stated that Medtronic had to lower its prices when another powered bone mill entered the 
market, but not when manual bone mills entered. Oral Arg. 24:46-26:41. Based on this statement, Medtronic's counsel argued 
that Lenox had improperly defined the market under its own theory, as the Lenox hand-operated bone mill did not constrain the 
price of electric bone mills. Id. But Medtronic did not raise this argument in its motion for summary judgment. Even in its appeal brief, Medtronic did not raise 
the argument. Instead, Medtronic simply stated in a footnote that Lenox's legal theory suggested ""that . . . powered bone mills 
constituted a distinct market,"" separate from hand-cranked bone mills. Appellee's  [**20] Resp. Br. at 25 n.6 (Dec. 2, 2013) 
(emphasis omitted). With only this passing mention in a footnote of Medtronic's appeal brief and complete omission in its summary judgment brief 
filed in the district court, we decline to consider Medtronic's assertion in oral argument that powered mills and hand-cranked mills 
constitute separate markets. See Gross v. Burggraf Constr. Co., 53 F.3d 1531, 1547 (10th Cir. 1995) (declining to consider a 
matter presented in oral argument when it was inadequately briefed); United States v. Williamson, 746 F.3d 987, 2014 WL

address arguments omitted or inadequately presented in an appellant's opening brief). "
1263,8," In its response brief, Medtronic refers to Lenox's figure as  [**24] 63.3% of market revenues, but does not explain how it 
derived this figure from the chart that it cited (at Appellant's App., vol. 1 (sealed) at 423). This chart includes Medtronic's data 
regarding the number of disposable units sold by Medtronic and Stryker. Id. From this chart, one could calculate Medtronic's 
share of disposable units sold (not revenue) at 58%, not 63.3%. But Lenox's economic expert calculated Medtronic's market "

1271,1," Although a Local Rule 3.01(g) certification was included in the Motion to Amend, BOA alleges that no such meet and confer

1289,1," The panel majority, responding to this dissent, protests that it has not ruled that Tyco's filing of the citizen petition is ""effectively"" 
an antitrust violation, even as the majority remands for determination of antitrust injury. The law is clear that antitrust violation 
must exist before consideration of antitrust injury becomes applicable. See, Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petrol. Co., 495 U.S. 328, 
342, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (""The purpose of the antitrust injury requirement . . . . ensures that the

1327,1," This Court indicated at one point in its discussion that collateral estoppel would apply to those findings of fact that “support” the 
nine legal conclusions. 10/10/02 Tr. at 5:5. Microsoft understands the term “support” as synonymous with the “necessary to the 
judgment” standard used in collateral estoppel analysis, and uses the terms interchangeably in this memorandum. There would 
be no basis under either federal or California law for deviating from the Restatement (Second) of Judgments' definition of 
“necessity” discussed in Part 1I-A [*108]  of this memorandum. See also the authorities cited in Microsoft's Mem. In Opp. To 
Plaintiffs' Proposed Jury Instructions 21-22 & n.22 (Aug. 26, 2002)."
1327,2," As shown in Microsoft's prior collateral estoppel briefing, under both California and federal law, the relevant issue is not which 
findings were necessary to the district court's original judgment, but rather which findings were necessary to the Court of 
Appeals' significantly narrower decision. See Microsoft's Mem. In Opp. To Plaintiffs' Proposed Jury Instructions 22 & n.23 (Aug. 
26, 2002). "
1328,3," In addition to reserving all of its objections to collateral estoppel, Microsoft understands that issues about the formatting and 
presentation of findings to the jury are not being briefed or decided at this juncture, but will be addressed after this Court has 
decided which findings are necessary to the legal conclusions it has adopted. See 10/16/02 Tr. at 53:23 to 54:18."
1328,4," See generally Office of Consumers' Counsel v. FERC, 808 F.2d 125, 129, 257 U.S. App. D.C. 230 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (citing 
Restatement § 27 cmt.h in holding that “[i]ssue preclusion applies only if the first determination was necessary to the judgment”); 
18 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore'S Federal Practice, supra, § 132.03[4][a], at 132-106 (3d ed. 2002) (“When … the court 
makes findings of fact, but the judgment is not dependent on those findings, they are not conclusive between the parties in a 
subsequent action based on a different cause of action.”) (emphasis added)."
1328,5," Although plaintiffs contend that many of the findings “were necessary to establish Microsoft'S anticompetitive intent,” the Court 
of Appeals held that evidence of intent “is relevant only to the extent it helps us understand the likely effect of the monopolist'S 
conduct.” 253 F.3d at 59. Plaintiffs never explain how evidence of Microsoft'S intent toward, for example, Lotus Notes, 
helped [*113]  the appellate court understand the likely effect of the acts found to be anticompetitive. "
1329,6," Given that Netscape rejected whatever proposal Microsoft made in June 1995, it is not surprising that the district court relied 
upon these findings only in connection with the aempt claim that was reversed. 84 F. Supp. 2d at 32-33 (FF 87-89). The district 
court did not rely upon any of these findings as a basis for its monopoly maintenance ruling, stating only that the findings 
provided “context” for Microsoft'S subsequent acts. 87 F. Supp. 2d at 39. Findings that simply provide “context” do not support, 
and are not necessary to, the Court of Appeals' decision. Not only was Microsoft'S June 1995 proposal to Netscape not among 
the acts found to be anticompetitive, the Court of Appeals did not even mention the proposal in its opinion or rely upon Findings 
of Fact 79-89 either as “context” or as an aid to help understand the likely effect of the to the Court of Appeals' specific liability 
findings, Findings of Fact 79-89 do not support [*117]  any of the legal conclusions adopted by this Court. "
1330,7," In her November 1, 2002 decision, Judge Kollar-Kotelly specifically cited one of those findings—Finding of Fact 129—as an 
example of a factual finding for which Judge Jackson ascribed no liability, 224 F. Supp. 2d at 143, and further stated that 
Findings of Fact 115-132 “did not provide a clear basis of liability,” id. at 163 n.68."
1330,8," Like other findings discussed above, Findings of Fact 93-132 describe specific conduct by Microsoft that has not “been 
weighed for competitive and anticompetitive effect.” 224 F. Supp. 2d at 138. These findings are unrelated to the acts found to be 
anticompetitive and do not support the D.C. Circuit's market definition and monopoly power determinations. Nor did the appellate 
court rely on those findings as evidence of intent to help understand [*120]  the likely effects of Microsoft's conduct. Rather, 
Findings of Fact 93-132 describe in highly pejorative terms conduct that has not been held to be anticompetitive. The attraction 
to plaintiffs of having preclusion on these findings is obvious, but so, too, is the prejudice to Microsoft lawful. "
1331,9," At the October 10, 2002, hearing, the Court suggested that preclusive effect may apply to the findings related to the tying claim. 
See 10/10/02 Tr. at 7:11-18. This would be error and should be reconsidered. It is blackletter law that vacated liability 
determinations cannot give rise to preclusion. See 224 F. Supp. 2d at 258 (“Because the claim was not pursued on 
remand, [*122]  there exists no finding that Microsoft illegally ‘tied’ any product to Windows.”)."
1331,10," Although Judge Kollar-Kotelly on remand rejected Microsoft's contention that the Court of Appeals implicitly reversed this 
conclusion in reversing the district court's “course of conduct” liability determination, 224 F Supp. 2d at 99, she did not hold that 
Findings of Fact 230-238 supported the Court of Appeals' decision. "
1333,11," The D.C. Circuit cited Finding of Fact 397 only in connection with its reversal of the imposition of liability for Microsoft'S 
development and promotion [*132]  of an incompatible JVM. 253 F.3d at 75. Although Finding of Fact 398 refers to Microsoft'S 
Java developer tools, the Court of Appeals held that the development of incompatible developer tools did not violate the antitrust 
laws. See 253 F.3d at 76; see also 224 F. Supp. 2d at 144-45 (“[T]he imposition of liability for Microsoft'S Java tools concerned 
not the tools' incompatibility with cross-platform Java, but Microsoft'S deceptive conduct.”). The appellate court went on to hold 
that Microsoft'S “deception” of Java developers regarding those tools did violate the Sherman Act, 253 F.3d at 76, but that ruling 
was supported by Finding of Fact 394, see 84 F. Supp. 2d at 106-07, not by Finding of Fact 398. "
1334,12," These consumer harm findings were also unnecessary to the Court of Appeals' liability determination given the relaxed causal 
standard applied by the D.C. Circuit, and collateral estoppel on these issues would be inappropriate given the sharp differences 
in the legal standards and proof burdens for establishing injury and causation in the two cases. See Microsoft's Mem. in Opp. To 
Plaintiffs' Proposed Jury Instructions 18-20 (Aug. 26, 2002)."
1334,1," As discussed in the accompanying memorandum, Microsoft's position concerning the necessity of these findings to the Court's 
legal conclusions is subject to all of Microsoft's on-going objections and appellate rights to collateral estoppel identified in its prior 
written submissions and oral arguments. The Court has emphasized that Microsoft's participation in this process will not waive or 
otherwise prejudice any of its objections. See, e.g.,  10/16/02 Tr. at 55:5-6. "
1341,1," The Justice Department action is captioned United States v. Microsoft Corporation, Civil No. 98-12322(DDC). The consolidated 
case brought by a coalition of states and the District of Columbia is captioned State of New York, et al, v. Microsoft 
Corporation [*153] , Civil No. 98-1233(DDC). The State of Minnesota was a plaintiff in the latter case. These two cases are 
referred to as the “government case” in this Memorandum. "
1342,2," In their initial memorandum, Plaintiffs sought application of collateral estoppel to 377 Findings. At the oral argument Plaintiffs 
withdrew their request as to 16 Findings. "
1354,1," Dr. Leamer was subject to vigorous attack in the initial class certification motion, and this Court agreed with some of 
Defendants' contentions with respect to Dr. Leamer and thus rejected the initial class certification motion. See ECF No. 382 at 
33-43."
1354,2," Defendants' motions in limine, Plaintiffs' motion to exclude testimony from certain experts, Defendants' motion to exclude 
testimony from certain experts, a motion to determine whether the per se or rule of reason analysis applied, and a motion to 
compel were pending at the time the settlement was reached."
1354,3," Plaintiffs in the instant Motion represent that two of the letters are from non-Class members and that the third letter  [*12] is 
from a Class member who may be withdrawing his objection. See ECF No. 920 at 18 n.11. The objection has not been 
withdrawn at the time of this Order."
1354,4," Devine stated in his Opposition that the Opposition was designed to supersede a letter that he had previously sent to the Court. 
See ECF No. at 934 n.2. The Court did not receive any letter from Devine. Accordingly, the Court has considered only Devine's 
Opposition. "
1355,5," Plaintiffs also assert that administration costs for the settlement would be $160,000."
1355,6," Devine calculated that Class members would receive an average of $3,573. The discrepancy between this number and the 
Court's calculation may result from the fact that Devine's calculation does not account for the fact that 147  [*16] individuals have 
already opted out of the Class. The Court's calculation resulted from subtracting the requested attorneys' fees ($81,125,000), 
costs ($1,200,000), incentive awards ($400,000), and estimated administration costs ($160,000) from the settlement amount 
($324,500,000) and dividing the resulting number by the total number of remaining class members (64,466)."
1355,7," If the Court were to deny any portion of the requested fees, costs, or incentive payments, this would increase individual Class 
members' recovery. If less than 4% of the Class were to opt out, that would also increase individual Class members' recovery. "
1356,8," One way to think about this is to set up the simple equation: 5/95 = $20,000,000/x. This equation asks the question of how 
much 95% would be if 5% were $20,000,000. Solving for x would result in $380,000,000."
1356,9," Again, 8/92 = $20,000,000/x would lead to x = $230,000,000. "
1358,10," On the same day, Mr. Campbell sent an email to Mr. Brin and to Larry Page (Google Co-Founder) stating, ""Steve just called 
me again and is pissed that we are still recruiting his browser guy."" ECF No. 428-13. Mr. Page responded ""[h]e called a few 
minutes ago and demanded to talk to me."" Id. "
1359,11," Mr. Jobs successfully expanded the anti-solicitation agreements to Macromedia, a company acquired by Adobe, both before 
and after Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia. "
1365,12," Adobe also benchmarked compensation off external sources, which supports Plaintiffs' theory of Class-wide impact and 
undermines Defendants' theory that the anti-solicitation agreements had only one off, non-structural effects. For example, Adobe 
pegged its compensation structure as a ""percentile"" of average market compensation according to  [*57] survey data from 
companies such as Radford. ECF No. 804-17 at 4. Mr. Chizen explained that the particular market targets that Adobe used as 
benchmarks for setting salary ranges ""tended to be software, high-tech, those that were geographically similar to wherever the 
position existed."" ECF No. 962-7 at 22. This demonstrated that the salary structures of the various Defendants were linked, such 
that the effect of one Defendant's salary structure would ripple across to the other Defendants through external sources like 
Radford. "
1380,1," All exhibit citations in this order are to the page numbers provided by the parties at trial, which do not necessarily correspond to 
the page numbers created by the original author of the exhibit."
1380,2," The NCAA's bylaws define financial aid to mean ""funds provided to student-athletes from various sources to pay or assist in 
paying their cost of education at the institution."" Ex. 2340 at 206. The Court adopts this definition  [**14] for the purposes of this 
order."
1380,3," Prior to 2006, FBS was known as Division I-A and FCS was known as Division I-AA. For the purposes of simplicity, this order 
uses ""FBS"" and ""FCS"" to refer to these subdivisions even when discussing student-athletes who played Division I football before 
2006. "
1383,4," Plaintiffs presented some evidence at trial of a market for licenses to use student-athletes' names, images, and likenesses in 
other merchandise, such as jerseys and bobbleheads. The Court does not address this market because Plaintiffs previously 
abandoned all of their claims related to such markets. Docket No. 827, June 20, 2013 Hrg. Tr. 54:13-:16. In addition, the 
evidence they presented at trial regarding merchandise-related licenses did not constitute proof of a market for group licenses 
but, rather, only individual licenses. "
1386,5," Under certain circumstances, a student-athlete who has an unexpected ""special financial need"" may be permitted to receive 
additional aid beyond the cost of attendance. Trial Tr. 2144:25-2145:14 (Petr). This additional aid comes from his  [**38] school's 
""student assistance fund"" and could include money for ""needed clothing, needed supplies, a computer,"" or other academic 
needs. Ex. 2340 at 238."
1386,6," The NCAA's bylaws contain a minor exception permitting student-athletes to receive limited compensation for educational 
expenses ""awarded by the U.S. Olympic Committee or a U.S. national governing body."" Ex. 2340 at 211. "
1390,7," The NCAA's objections to this testimony under Federal Rules of Evidence 602 and 701 are overruled. Walter Byers was the 
executive director of the NCAA between 1956 and 1975, Stip. Undisputed Facts ¶ 23, and therefore had personal knowledge of 
the popularity of NCAA sports during this period. "
1396,8," This market could be divided into two submarkets -- one in which Division I basketball schools compete for elite basketball 
recruits and one in which FBS football schools compete for elite football recruits. However, because the parties' evidence and "
1397,," arguments in this case apply generally to both of these submarkets, there is no need to subdivide the broader market for the 
purposes of this analysis. "
1400,9," The Supreme Court recently relied on this language from then-Judge Sotomayor's concurrence in another Sherman Act case 
involving a challenge to concerted action by members of a sports league. American Needle, 560 U.S. at 202 (""HN14[
] 
[C]ompetitors 'cannot simply get around' antitrust liability by acting 'through a third-party intermediary or 'joint venture.''"" (quoting 
Salvino, 542 F.3d at 336 (Sotomayor, J., concurring)). "
1402,10," As discussed in the findings of fact, when a third party -- such as a bowl committee or the NCAA itself -- has organized a 
particular athletic event, the networks may also purchase a separate license from that party to use its intellectual property during 
the telecast. Because these transactions do not involve the transfer of rights to use student-athletes' names, images, and 
likenesses, they are not relevant to this discussion. "
1403,11," The evidence presented at trial suggests that most telecasting contracts, even for regular season games, are negotiated at the 
conference-wide level -- not the individual team level. Nevertheless, the Court notes that the challenged rules would not 
suppress competition in this market even if contracts to telecast regular season games were negotiated at the individual team 
level. "
1404,12," Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all of their claims against the NCAA for ""individual damages,  [**112] disgorgement of profits, 
and an accounting."" Docket No. 198, Stip. Dismissal, at 2. They also dismissed their claims for unjust enrichment. Accordingly, 
the Court does not consider these claims here. "
1405,13," The NCAA's other argument -- that videogame  [**116] developers would not need to acquire group licenses because their 
use of student-athletes' names, images, and likenesses is protected under the First Amendment -- was rejected by the Ninth 
Circuit earlier in this litigation. In re NCAA Student-Athlete Name & Likeness Licensing Litig., 724 F.3d 1268, 1284 (9th Cir. 
2013) (concluding that ""EA's use of the likenesses of college athletes like Samuel Keller in its video games is not, as a matter of 
law, protected by the First Amendment""); see also Hart v. Electronic Arts, Inc., 717 F.3d 141, 170 (3d Cir. 2013) (holding that 
""the NCAA Football 2004, 2005 and 2006 games at issue in this case do not sufficiently transform Appellant's identity to escape 
the right of publicity claim""). "
1408,14," In its post-trial brief, the NCAA argues that the integration of academics and athletics also increases consumer demand for its 
other product -- FBS football and Division I basketball games. It presented scant evidence at trial to support this assertion. In any 
event, to the extent that the NCAA contends that its restrictions on student-athlete compensation increase consumer demand for "
1409,," FBS football and Division I basketball games,  [**132] the Court addresses that argument in its discussion of the NCAA's 
asserted procompetitive justification of amateurism. "
1410,15," The Court notes, however, that the NCAA could easily adopt several less restrictive rules if it wished to increase competitive 
balance or output. With respect to competitive balance, for instance, the NCAA could adopt a more equal revenue distribution 
formula. As noted above, its current formula primarily rewards the schools that already have the largest athletic budgets. This 
uneven distribution of revenues runs counter to the association's stated goal of promoting competitive balance. See, e.g., 
Salvino, 542 F.3d at 333 (noting that ""disproportionate distribution of licensing income would foster a competitive imbalance"" 
among Major League  [**140] Baseball teams); Smith v. Pro Football, Inc., 593 F.2d 1173, 1188, 193 U.S. App. D.C. 19 (D.C. 
Cir. 1978) (""The least restrictive alternative of all, of course, would be for the NFL to eliminate the draft entirely and employ 
revenue-sharing to equalize the teams' financial resources [as] a method of preserving 'competitive balance' nicely in harmony 
with the league's self-proclaimed 'joint-venture' status.""). As for the NCAA's stated goal of increasing output, the NCAA already "
1411,," has the power to achieve this goal in a much more direct way: by amending its current requirements for entry into Division I or 
increasing the number of athletic scholarships Division I schools are permitted to offer."
1411,16," The Court also notes that, over the past two decades, numerous commentators have suggested that the NCAA could hold 
payments in trust  [**143] for its student-athletes without violating generally accepted understandings of amateurism used by 
other sports organizations. See, e.g., Sean Hanlon & Ray Yasser, ""'J.J. Morrison' and His Right of Publicity Lawsuit Against the 
NCAA,"" 15 Vill. Sports & Ent. L.J. 241, 294 (2008) (""Searching for a solution to the problem posed by this Comment, 
commentators have suggested a 'have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too' approach whereby a trust would be created, allowing student-
athletes the ability to preserve their amateur status while their athletic eligibility remains. The money generated through the use 
of the commercial value of their identity would be placed in a trust until the expiration of their athletic eligibility.""); Kristine Mueller, 
""No Control over Their Rights of Publicity: College Athletes Left Sitting the Bench,"" 2 DePaul J. Sports L. & Contemp. Probs. 70, 
87-88 (2004) (""One suggestion put forth is to create a trust for the athletes, which would become available to them upon 
graduation. . . . [This proposal] allows the athletes to reap the financial benefits of their labors, while maintaining the focus on 
amateur athletics.""); Vladimir P. Belo, ""The Shirts Off Their Backs: Colleges  [**144] Getting Away with Violating the Right of 
Publicity,"" 19 Hastings Comm. & Ent. L.J. 133, 155 (1996) (""Should the NCAA hold steadfastly to its notions of amateurism and 
resist payment to the athletes, the trust fund alternative could be a fair and reasonable compromise. First of all, it could be 
limited to certain merchandising monies, such as those associated with selling game jerseys or any other revenue from 
marketing a student-athlete's name and likeness.""); Stephen M. Schott, ""Give Them What They Deserve: Compensating the

Cargill, 479 U.S. at 111. Because the Court finds Retrophin has met its burden under section 4 of the Clayton Act, Retrophin 
also meets its burden under section 16. "
1418,2," To the extent the Ninth Circuit held the plaintiff had alleged antitrust injury as a customer, the decision is not directly on point. 
See id. at 369, 374, 376-78. Nonetheless, the Court's interpretation of Brunswick and Lucas is relevant to whether Retrophin 
sufficiently alleges antitrust injury."
1418,3," Questcor states in its Motion that it intends to use Synacthen for ""new indications."" (Mem. [**15]  at 4, 23.) Whether or not this 
could be considered pro-competitive, it is not alleged in the Complaint. "
1419,4," Questcor also argues that it did not actually foreclose Retrophin from entering the Relevant Markets, because Retrophin could 
enter through RE-034. (Mem. at 10.) However, as explained in greater detail below, Retrophin alleges RE-034 is not on the 
market and may not ever make it to the market, (see Compl. ¶¶ 58, 60), and the Court will not resolve any factual dispute 
regarding this issue at this stage."
1419,5," Questcor also argues in passing that Retrophin [**16]  lacks Article III standing. (Mem. at 11.) Article III standing imposes a 
lower bar than antitrust standing. Assoc. Gen. Contractors, 459 U.S. at 535 n.31. As the Court finds Retrophin has antitrust 
standing, it also finds Retrophin has Article III standing."
1419,6," The Court grants Questcor's request for judicial notice of FDA publications in the Federal Register, which describe procedures 
and statistics regarding FDA approval. (See Mem. at 13-14); 44 U.S.C. § 1507. The Court nonetheless focuses on the "
1420,," allegations in Retrophin's Complaint, as opposed to generally-applicable facts about the FDA, in determining whether Retrophin 
has sufficiently alleged an intent and preparedness to enter the market. "
1421,7," Questcor does not dispute Retrophin has sufficiently alleged relevant geographic and product markets, nor does Questcor 
directly challenge the sufficiency of Retrophin's market share allegations. (See Compl. ¶¶ 37-45). In light of these allegations, 
and the allegations as to barriers to entry, the Court finds Retrophin plausibly alleges monopoly power. Cf. Movie 1 & 2 v. United 
Artists Comm's, Inc., 909 F.2d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir. 1990) (""[M]arket share is perhaps the most important factor to consider in

purchases a different (or tied) product""—may be unlawful under § 1. Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc., 504 
U.S. 451, 461-62, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Medical Center 
alleges that the tying product is the implied license to perform MPIs involving adenosine, and the tied product is the Adenoscan. "
1463,2," See Eastman Kodak, 504 U.S. at 460-61 (HN2[
] ""A tying arrangement is an agreement by a party to sell one product but 
only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product,"" which violates antitrust laws ""if the seller has 
appreciable economic power in the tying product market and if the arrangement affects a substantial volume of commerce in the 
tied market."") (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Phillip Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, IX Antitrust Law § 1700a (3d 
ed. 2011). [**8]"
1463,3," HN3[
] The appropriate measure of damages in a tying case is the amount the purchaser overpaid for the unlawfully tied 
bundle of products or services when compared to the amount the purchaser would have paid to purchase those products or 
services separately. See Kypta v. McDonald's Corp., 671 F.2d 1282, 1285 (11th Cir. 1982). Here, however, the Medical Center 
alleges that Astellas charged nothing for the implied use license it tied to the sale of Adenoscan, and further alleges that, even if 
Astellas had offered a stand-alone license separate from the Adenoscan, Astellas would have charged nothing for that license. 
In this tying case, then, the Medical Center is measuring its damages by the amount Astellas was able to overcharge the 
Medical Center for the Adenoscan, by tying it to the implied license, as compared to the price at which the Medical Center could 
have obtained other, comparable adenosine products."
1463,4," Because this tying claim is before us on standing, we do not reach its merits and so we do not express any opinion regarding 
the claim's merits. "
1464,5," Applying the direct purchaser rule here serves all of the purposes underlying that rule. See UtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 208-16. But 
even if the rule's application in this particular case did not serve the rule's underlying purposes, the Supreme Court has directed 
courts to apply the rule nonetheless: ""even assuming that any economic assumptions underlying the Illinois Brick rule might be 
disproved in a specific case, we think it an unwarranted and counterproductive exercise to litigate a series of exceptions."" Id. at 
216."
1464,6," No one questions that Astellas tied the implied process license to the purchase of Adenoscan. But there are two ways to view 
that arrangement. One way is to suppose that the implied license came directly from the purchase of Adenoscan and thus 
flowed down the Adenoscan distribution chain, from Astellas to the distributor to the Medical Center. [**13]  This is what Astellas 
contends, and that is consistent with its, Astellas's, own assertions in letters it sent to healthcare providers, including the Medical 
Center. The other way to view the arrangement is that Astellas linked the right to obtain an implied license to the purchase of "
1465,," Adenoscan, even though healthcare providers like the Medical Center, in exercising that right, actually obtained the implied 
license directly from Astellas. That is the Medical Center's contention. As we see it, it does not matter because, either way, 
Astellas undoubtedly conditioned its granting of the implied license on the purchase of Adenoscan, and here the entire tying 
damages came from the enhanced price of Adenoscan, the tied product, which was first paid by the distributors to Astellas."
1465,7," The Medical Center attempts [**17]  to distinguish Kloth because, in that case, 1) both the computer hardware and software 
came together from the computer manufacturers to the consumer; and 2) Microsoft leveraged its power in the computer "
1466,," operating system market to compel the manufacturers to install its software onto the computers. But those facts do not 
meaningfully distinguish Kloth from the circumstances presented here."
1466,8," Recall that under the Medical Center's theory, no one actually paid anything for the implied license."
1466,9," The case came to the Tenth Circuit on a summary judgment decision. See Sports Racing Servs., 131 F.3d at 878. Ultimately 
the court remanded the case to the district court for further factual finding. Id. at 890-91."
1466,10," The distributor was not itself buying the cars to race them and, when it resold the cars, it did not do so with a license that the 
buyer could race them in a Club-sponsored race. The buyer independently had to qualify and pay directly to Sports Car Club for "
1467,," the right to race in a sponsored race. There was no suggestion that when the distributor bought the car from Sports Car Club, 
that it was also buying an implied right to race that car in a Club-sponsored race."
1467,11," This court, in Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc) adopted as binding precedent all 
decisions of the former Fifth Circuit issued prior to October 1, 1981. "
1468,12," Astellas now asserts that the FDA approved a generic form of Adenoscan a year later, in August 2013, after the Medical 
Center initiated this appeal, but that information is not part of the appellate record."
1468,13," It may be that the district court did not conclude as a jurisdictional matter that the Medical Center's [**25]  claims were, or soon 
would be, moot. Instead, the district court may have decided not to exercise its discretion to certify the class under these 
circumstances. If so, the denial of class certification was an abuse of discretion, for the same reasons stated above. "
1472,1," Per this Court's referral, Magistrate Judge Valdez determined, in consultation with the parties, the proper scope of the targeted 
Rule 56(d) discovery necessary for Plaintiffs to respond to Schreiber's motion for summary judgment. In making her 
determinations, Judge Valdez was guided by several principles announced by this Court, including: [**9]  (i) that the prior 
production of tens of thousands of documents and the taking of fifteen depositions during the CFTC investigation, which 
occurred much more contemporaneously than this litigation, likely provided Plaintiffs with most of the discovery that they needed 
to contest summary judgment (and more documents than they possibly could use), and (ii) that any remaining depositions 
should be focused on attempting to prove their allegations that high-level DFA and Schreiber employees conspired to 
manipulate the price of spot cheese and milk futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. "
1473,2," Judge Valdez allowed the depositions of Mr. Dunford and Ms. Van Dyke, even though she was skeptical that, ten years down 
the road, they would have any useful information to provide, and then allowed three depositions of individuals who were not 
engaged in high-level discussions. She allowed the depositions based on a nexus between them and the high-level employees 
who would have been involved in a conspiracy (per Plaintiffs' allegations), if one existed. For the remaining employees, the 
nexus was not sufficiently established, in part because Plaintiffs articulated nothing more than a hunch that [**10]  these 
individuals might have relevant information (and in fact did not provide a single document linking these individuals to knowledge 
about a conspiracy) and further because the passage of ten years makes it even less likely that these individuals would have 
information relevant to establishing a conspiracy."
1473,3," Although this litigation has at times been somewhat contentious in regard to the merits-as high-stakes litigation often is-the 
Court commends the parties and their counsel for the highly professional approach they have taken to working with the Court 
and each other in setting and meeting the deadlines put in place to accommodate the parties' (and the Court's) desire for an 
efficient, orderly, and timely resolution of the complex issues presented on both the litigation and settlement fronts in this MDL 
action. "
1474,4," This figure represents less than one percent of Schreiber's total barrel cheese needs for 2004 and less than half a percent of 
Schreiber's total cheese needs for that year. "
1475,5," The cheese input price is based on price surveys conducted by the National Agricultural Statistical Service (""NASS"") of large 
cheddar cheese manufacturers concerning their [**18]  sales of block and barrel cheddar cheese. Thus, the NASS cheese 
survey price largely captures the CME cheese price. In fact, the NASS cheese survey price has a 98% correlation with CME 
spot cheese market prices when adjusted to account for the difference in timing between collecting price information and 
publishing survey results. According to studies by the University of Wisconsin, from January 2000 to January 2007, the cheese 
price component in the USDA Class III milk price formula has determined ""upward of 83%"" of the USDA price of Class III milk. In 
short, CME cheese prices impact USDA Class III milk prices and thereby necessarily impact CME Class III milk futures contract 
prices, which, again, ""cash settle"" to the USDA Class III milk price."
1475,6," Schreiber also maintains that a large spread can cause cheese producers to divert more milk supply to blocks rather than 
barrels, thereby reducing the supply of barrel cheese; however, viewing the evidence before the Court, a question of fact 
remains as to whether Schreiber had a shortage of barrel cheese in 2004. "
1476,7," As set forth infra page 12, the evidence also reflects that Schreiber bid on and purchased cheese in March 2004 in part so that 
the markets would rise enough [**22]  that ""Kraft would have to raise their prices on the shelf to create again a store brand and 
brand price difference."" "
1477,8, This 22-cent spread was the second largest CME block-barrel spread that ever had occurred on the CME up to that point. 
1478,9," Schreiber testified before the CFTC that its barrel purchasing activity on the CME between May 25, 2004 and June 22, 2004 
was motivated in part by a desire to maintain the spread by preventing offers of barrels by other traders from driving down the 
barrel price relative to the block price. "
1479,10," Schwenke reported to David Pozniak, provided input to Chris Herlache, and served as Schreiber's Rule 30(b)(6) witness in 
this action."
1479,11," In a September 14, 2004 e-mail to Herlache—after Schreiber had purchased four loads of CME barrels—Schwenke asked: 
""what are we doing Chris[Herlache]? I need inventory to go down, not up."" In the same e-mail chain, Herlache responds the 
following morning, on September 15, 2004, and explains that the barrel-block spread had grown to 10 cents because DFA was 
supporting blocks at $1.5675. Herlache further explains that ""[t]hroughout this past week, there [**34]  ha[ve] been a number of 
other companies also trying to correct the spread with us."" "
1480,12," The evidence of record, including from Plaintiffs' expert, is that March through June typically is an ""inventory building period"" in 
the cheese industry. Indeed, Schreiber was not the only firm building inventory during this period in 2004. The record also 
reflects that it was difficult to build inventory between January and April. In the spring of 2004, milk supply decreased 
substantially and cheese prices rose to record levels. Internal Schreiber documents at the time note that cheese was scarce and 
that, even at high prices, no seller would agree to fill any of Schreiber's CME bids. See, e.g., April 2, 2004 internal Herlache e-
mail (""1) Since the markets started taking off in March, there have been no trades, despite the high price. 2) This means the 
overall market supply of cheese is so tight that no one is willing to part with any cheese despite the very good profit [**38]  they 
could make.""). By March, Schreiber's cheese inventories were approximately 10 million pounds below their level in 2005 and 
2006, and even by May, Schreiber's inventories were approximately 5 million pounds lower than usual. "
1481,13," Goddard testified that he spoke to Schreiber at least once to get ""their input as to where they thought the market should be or 
was going and how that would affect business."""
1481,14," Although market observers, including Schreiber, could see that DFA was supporting the block market at a high level, there is 
no direct evidence that Hanman communicated to Schreiber a request to raise barrel prices. Rather, as set forth above and 
below, the internal communications from both DFA and Schreiber fairly clearly indicate that neither side knew with precision 
what the other side was doing and rather that they were speculating about what moves the other would make and why. See, 
e.g., June 23, 2004 internal Herlache e-mail regarding the drop in prices of block and barrel cheese on the CME (""The decrease 
in cheese was a result of DFA no longer supporting the 1.80 block market. It is currently unknown why they chose today to pull 
their support, but I will pass on any information I do get.""). "
1482,15," The activity chart also purports to identify the purchasers of butter during the week as AgriTrading (11), Bert Lewis (3),

identify the sellers of butter as AgriTrading (2), Dreyers (21), HKI (4), Hoogwegt (3), Morningstar (Dean) (1), MINR (9), Rich

1484,17," On May 26, 2004, Korsmeyer, McCroskey and Pozniak met in Chicago regarding ""Rabobank."" Schreiber contends that the 
meeting was about a potential joint venture. No additional evidence has been presented by the parties about the substance of 
this meeting."
1484,18," In 2002, Schreiber sued DFA for patent infringement. On April 28, 2004, Larry Ferguson and Gary Hanman [**53]  met to 
negotiate a settlement. Although a tentative settlement proposal was reached at that meeting, the suit was not finally settled for 
another year. "
1485,19," Korsmeyer and David Pozniak were friends and their families were friends. Pozniak testified that he had conversations about 
the ""markets in general"" with Korsmeyer and other people in the cheese and dairy business."
1485,20," Schreiber agrees that these facts are not in dispute, except that Ms. Van Dyk provided an incorrect name: Aaron and Nicholas 
Kelne were Schreiber's floor traders, and no person named Neil Kelne was a floor trader for Schreiber. "
1486,21," Schreiber points out that DFA discussed pricing with other customers. For instance, on May 24, 2004, Steve Vesce of 
American Dairy Brands wrote to Mark Korsmeyer of DFA regarding Korsmeyer's request that Vesce ""poll[] a few private label 
customers and retailers for optimum [**59]  barrel/block pricing and here seems to be the consensus"": Private Label: Optimum markets around the $1.10 mark as this would allow PL to be promoted with significance and still 
make a margin for the retailer. These guys like to promote at 2/$3.00 or $1.49 Retail: A different but predictable answer is that they think a $1.30ish mark is best for them as this takes the swings out and 
allows for consistent pricing and still gives them the margin they are looking for. In a similar vein, on June 24, 2004, Chris Hanson of Carlson Restaurants Worldwide, one of DFA's customers, sent an e-mail to 
Lavonne Dietrich of DFA, asking: ""Lavonne, What's the story on the block and barrel market trending down right now?"" "
1490,22," The 5 million pound sale represented less than 5.4% of Schreiber's purchases from DFA in fiscal year 2004 and less than 
0.9% of Schreiber's total bulk (block and barrel) cheese purchases during that same period. "
1491,23," ""Current production"" for this sale meant new production or cheese that was less than 20 days ""cheese age"" and ""up to 60 
days of age"" refers to existing production or ""Corona production up to 60 days age at shipment."""
1491,24," The following examples illustrate the different prices per pound throughout July, August, and September 2004. The record 
indicates that if Schreiber had wanted ""new production via Corona"" then Tom Goddard was going to ""push to get all 5 million 
pounds produced in next two weeks (week of 7/18 & 25/04)."" The week of July 18, 2004 (a Sunday) the CME block cheese price "
1492,," ranged from $1.47 per pound on Monday, July 19, 2004 to $1.48 on Friday, July 23, 2004. Initially, as of July 15, 2004, the sale 
was for ""35 loads of Corona 'new' colored cheddar block production to Smithfield, UT and 90 loads of colored cheddar blocks to 
Carthage, MO."" For ""[a]ll Smithfield shipments, [Schreiber] want[ed] new production."" DFA was going to try and start producing 
the new production the week of July 18, 2004 when the CME block cheese price ranged [**79]  from $1.47 on Monday, July 19, 
2004 to $1.48 on Friday, July 23, 2004. These 24 loads of new production that were being shipped to Missouri were targeted to 
be shipped the week of August 16, 2004, and were scheduled to be delivered on September 1-2, 2004. If these 24 loads were 
less than 20 days cheese age at the time of shipment, then that gives them an approximate make-date of August 15, 2004. The 
CME block market price on August 13 and August 16, 2004 was $1.55 per pound, or $.145 more than Schreiber paid. Of the 61 
loads shipped to Utah at least 5 loads were ""up to 60 days of age"" and at least 26 loads were ""from current production."" These 
26 loads were scheduled to be shipped the weeks of August 8 and August 16, 2004. If these 26 loads were less than 20 days 
cheese age at the time of shipment then for loads shipping the week of August 8 that would mean an approximate make-date of 
July 21, 2004. The CME block market price on July 21, 2004 was $1.48 per pound, or $.075 more than Schreiber paid. For loads 
shipping the week of August 16, 2004 that would mean an approximate make-date of July 29, 2004. The CME block market 
price on July 29, 2004 was $1.53 per pound, or $.125 more than [**80]  Schreiber paid. "
1493,25," ""'Because the Cartwright Act is patterned after the federal Sherman Act and both have their roots [**85]  in the common law, 
federal cases interpreting the Sherman Act are applicable in construing the Cartwright Act.'"" In re Copper Antitrust Litig., 436

1494,26," Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, provides a private cause of action for the enforcement of § 1, and also provides 
treble damages and attorneys' fees to successful antitrust plaintiffs. "
1498,27," In their surreply, Plaintiffs contend that Schreiber's reply brief creates a new ""evidentiary interpretation"" of Ferguson's letter to 
the CME. What Plaintiffs' argument fails to appreciate is that the actual language of the letter—not anything that Schreiber or 
Plaintiffs say in their briefs—has the ""evidentiary"" value. And Schreiber clearly highlighted the letter in its opening brief. 
Whatever gloss Plaintiffs or Schreiber want to put on the [**101]  letter, they can (and have); but the language and timing of the 
letter, viewed in consideration with the rest of the evidence of record (as opposed to the parties' spin on the evidence) is what 
matters to the Court's resolution of the issues in this case."
1498,28," The evidence reflects that on May 13, 2004, Elvin Hollon of DFA emailed Van Dyk and stated: ""I may be getting an audience 
at the CME on the replacement cheese issue in the next week or so. I may want you to make a call. Who do you clear trades 
thru?"" In response, Van Dyk provided the name of Schreiber's clearing firm and CME spot cheese broker. However, as set forth 
in detail infra at page 64, the evidence of record quite plainly indicates that Hollon and Van Dyk's correspondence had nothing to 
do with a conspiracy to manipulate the price of milk futures. Moreover, the manipulation period as alleged by Plaintiffs had not 
even begun yet."
1498,29," Schreiber's internal records of its purchases conflict with DFA's own record when Schreiber utilized an unfamiliar broker, 
casting doubt on the allegation that Hanman's knowledge came directly from Schreiber. On May 24, 2004, for example, DFA's 
records attribute a sale of 1 load of barrels at $1.7650 to ""SAW."" This sale actually was to Schreiber through an unusual broker. "
1499,," On May 26, DFA attributes the sale of 6 loads to barrels to SAW; those sales also were to Schreiber. And on June 2, DFA 
attributes yet another sale to SAW that actually was purchased by Schreiber."
1499,30," The additional reasons put forth by Schreiber for its conduct—many of which are the subject of both Plaintiffs' response brief 
and its surreply—are not as well supported by the evidence contemporaneous to the conspiracy period or by the testimony after 
the fact. At a minimum, [**107]  those reasons (and the evidence offered in support) tend to raise questions of fact about 
Schreiber's business judgment during the time in question. However, as set forth in more detail below, that does not change the 
facts that Plaintiffs have not come forward with any evidence indicating an agreement beyond evidence of parallel conduct and 
that the contemporaneous evidence supports the opposite inference that Schreiber's conduct was in conformance with its 
economic interest in the spread. "
1500,31," The record reflects that in 2004, DFA was Schreiber's second largest cheese supplier. Given the clear evidence of a 
customer-supplier relationship between Schreiber and DFA, Plaintiffs' refusal to concede the existence of this type of 
relationship—while repeatedly highlighting the fact that the parties also were competitors, a point not challenged by Schreiber—
is puzzling."
1500,32," Plaintiffs maintain that from these [**111]  personal relationships, a jury could infer a conspiracy. However, without any 
additional evidence of a conspiracy, that sort of logic requires an unsupported leap from legitimate conduct to unlawful conduct 
that is not supported in the case law."
1500,33," The decision by a group of industry players to have a meeting or to talk at a dinner or cocktail reception [**112]  does not 
constitute a conspiracy. See Market Force Inc. v. Wauwatosa Realty Co., 906 F.2d 1167, 1173 (7th Cir. 1990) (""[I]t is well 
established that evidence of informal communications among several parties does not unambiguously support an inference of a 
conspiracy.""). "
1501,34," For his part, Hanman testified that he had no recollection of the May 11, 2004 meeting and believed that he did not attend it. 
Hanman Dep. 212:19-213:10.14. For purposes of summary judgment, the Court assumes that he did attend. "
1503,35," Plaintiffs' surreply, which the Court has considered, does not mention the five million pound sale."
1503,36," Plaintiffs do not contend that DFA's deal with Schreiber was more favorable than sales DFA offered or made to other 
customers during the same period. "
1507,37, Plaintiffs do not dispute that Indriolo and Valley Gold lack standing to pursue their CEA claims.
1507,38," Compare Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009) (definition of futures contract: ""An agreement to buy or sell a standardized 
asset * * * at a fixed price at a future time * * *.""), with id. (definition of ""spot"": ""Made, paid, or delivered immediately * * *.""); see 
also id. (defining ""market"" and distinguishing between a ""futures market,"" which is a ""commodity [**137]  exchange in which 
futures contracts are traded; a market for a trade (e.g., commodities futures contracts and stock options) that is negotiated at the 
current price but calls for delivery at a future time,"" from a ""spot market,"" which is a ""market (esp. in commodities) in which 
payment or delivery is immediate"")."
1507,39," Additionally, even if the CEA did provide such a right of action, all of the named Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs would lack standing 
to assert such a claim because none of them purchased CME spot cheese contracts between April 1, 2004 and December 31, 
2006."
1507,40, Knutson purchased or sold a CME Class III milk futures contract during the relevant time period and thus has standing. 
1509,41," Citing to Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. S.E.C., 187 F.3d 713 (7th Cir. 1999), Plaintiffs maintain that ""commodity 
underlying"" is not defined in the CEA. When read in context, the statement further undercuts Plaintiffs' argument. The court in 
Board of Trade was responding to an argument by the SEC that a utilities futures contract tied to the Dow Jones Utilities and 
Transportation Averages was defective because the Dow Jones average did not include any telecommunications stocks. See id. 
at 723. In other words, the SEC had argued that the futures contract was tied to the wrong underlying commodity (in the SEC's 
view, the NYSE Utilities Index would have been a better choice). The court rejected this argument, stating that a board of trade 
can choose any commodity to underlie a futures contract that it wants: ""While the SEC thinks that [**145]  the difference 
between the NYSE and Dow Jones utilities portfolios is bad, an investor may believe that choice is good. The more different 
proxies for 'utilities' are available, the easier it is to hedge or balance a particular portfolio. There's no right definition of the 
commodity underlying a futures contract. Instead there are many possible definitions. Boards of trade experiment to find good 
combinations, but most contracts fail to attract enough trading to justify continued listing."" Id. The implications of the Seventh 
Circuit's dicta are that each futures contract in fact has a defined underlying commodity and that commodity is the commodity 
(such as the Dow Jones Utilities and Transportation Average) specified in the futures contract. "
1510,42," Dr. Pirrong identified two instances in which Schreiber did [**147]  not purchase cheese on the CME despite the existence of a 
spread wider than 5 cents. Similarly, before the CFTC, Herlache testified that there are days in which Schreiber would allow the 
spread to maintain a larger space based on other factors."
1510,43," Moreover, the record reflects that Schreiber's purchases from May 24 to June 23 likely would not have affected the May Class 
III milk price (and thus would have had no impact [**148]  on Schreiber's May futures positions). As Plaintiffs' expert Professor 
Jesse explains, the Class III milk price incorporates the average NASS survey prices for cheese in May, which are in turn 
correlated with CME prices after a two-week lag. Jesse Aff. ¶ 6. In other words, CME prices on May 24, 2004 (when Schreiber 
allegedly began participating in the conspiracy) would not have had an effect on NASS survey prices until approximately June 7, 
and NASS prices on June 7 had no input into the May Class III price, which was announced on June 4. If Plaintiffs had wanted 
to determine whether Schreiber had an interest in higher futures prices during a potentially relevant time, they would have 
looked at Schreiber's June and July futures contract positions, as those were the positions whose closing prices potentially could 
have been affected by Schreiber's trading. Schreiber has presented evidence that its hedging positions were net short for June 
and July by 148 contracts, meaning that its positions would (and did) lose money on higher June and July Class III milk prices. "

1548,5," Prior to the Rouse decision, it has been unclear whether Wells Fargo should be considered a citizen of California for diversity 
purposes — the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals had not opined and district courts within the circuit were split. See, e.g., Grace v. 
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 926 F. Supp. 2d 1173, 1178 (S.D. Cal. 2013) (finding Wells Fargo to be a citizen of both South Dakota

*5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 12, 2012) (finding Wells Fargo to be a citizen only of South Dakota). "
1550,6," As noted above, Wells Fargo is a national bank subject to regulation by the OCC under the National Bank Act, 12 USC sec. 1, 
et seq. While the NBA potentially could give rise to preemption of claims arising out of Wells Fargo's post-merger conduct, 
Defendants have not asserted a preemption defense based upon the NBA. Accordingly, the Court does not consider whether or 
to what extent NBA preemption might apply here. "
1567,1, This program is codified at 42 U.S.C Section 256b. 
1568,2," The Court sets forth additional facts alleged in the complaint throughout the opinion. Rather than restate those facts in this 
background section, the Court raises the facts relevant to each of Plaintiff's claims in the context of deciding whether Plaintiff has 
stated a claim for relief. "
1569,3," Defendants contend that the complaint fails to allege that Defendants monopolized the inpatient hospital services market and 
they therefore do not move for dismissal of any claims premised on this market. In its opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, 
Plaintiff does not argue that the complaint contains such allegations but rather maintains that it intended—but did not—include 
such [**12]  allegations and that it will correct this error. [Doc. 40 at 3 n.1]. To date, Plaintiff has taken no steps to add federal or 
state claims of monopolization of the inpatient hospital services market. Thus, the Court will not consider whether such 
monopolization claims are subject to dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). "
1570,4," Admittedly, the Tenth Circuit's reading of Section 4 of the Clayton Act and the Supreme Court's decision in McCready differs 
from the interpretations of other courts. Compare Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d 454, 466-67 (5th Cir. 2007) (declining to read 
the ""inextricably intertwined"" language in McCready broadly and holding that McCready does not alter the limitations on standing 
that require a plaintiff to be a customer or competitor in the restrained market); Serpa Corp. v. McWane, Inc., 199 F.3d 6, 13 (1st "
1571,," Cir. 1999) (holding that ""we decline to interpret McCready broadly,"" and noting that in McCready ""the plaintiff was a consumer in 
the market directly affected by the antitrust violation"" and that the Supreme Court has applied McCready's ""inextricably 
intertwined"" [**16]  language ""as a legal conclusion"" applicable ""to the consumers and competitors""). In the absence of a 
Supreme Court opinion on point, however, it is the Tenth Circuit's opinions that govern the analysis of this Court. "
1573,5," Defendants also argue that Plaintiff cannot obtain standing by virtue of allegations it ""tried to bring new entries into both the 
markets for Private Health Insurance and Hospital Inpatient Services."" [Doc. 40 at 23; Doc. 24 ¶¶ 247-52]. To the extent that 
Plaintiff claims that it has standing to bring its monopolization claim by virtue of its attempt to enter these markets, [Doc. 40 at 
23], the Court declines to consider this basis for standing. The Court already has held that Plaintiff had [**28]  standing because 
of its status as a perceived competitor and its status as a seller of services. The Court therefore need not decide whether the 
complaint contains allegations sufficient to confer standing on any other ground. "
1574,6," In evaluating Plaintiff's New Mexico Antitrust Act claims, the Court generally follows authority interpreting claims under Section 
2 of the Sherman Act. HN8[
] The New Mexico Antitrust Act specifically directs courts to construe the state act ""in harmony with [**29]  judicial interpretations of the federal antitrust laws."" N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-15; accord Smith Machinery Corp. v. 
Hesston, Inc., 1985 - NMSC 004, 102 N.M. 245, 694 P.2d 501, 505 (N.M. 1985) (recognizing that the NMAA specifically 
provides that it is to be construed ""in harmony with judicial interpretations of the federal antitrust laws"") (citing N.M. Stat. Ann. § 
57-1-15); Romero v. Philip Morris, Inc., 2010 - NMSC 035, 148 N.M. 713, 242 P.3d 280, 291 (N.M. 2010) (explaining that ""[t]o

judicial interpretations of the federal antitrust laws'"" and that ""'[t]his construction shall be made to achieve uniform application of 
the state and federal laws prohibiting restraints of trade and monopolistic practices'"") (quoting N.M. Stat. Ann. § 57-1-15) 
(additional citation omitted). Moreover, New Mexico courts have specifically held that they draw upon federal interpretations of 
the Sherman Act to define the scope of liability under the NMAA, see Smith Machinery Corp., 694 P.2d at 505 (""In the absence 
of New Mexico decisions directly on point, we look to federal cases involving allegations of antitrust arrangements under Section 
1 of the Sherman Act.""), and that ""[i]t is the duty of the courts to ensure that New Mexico antitrust law does not deviate 
substantially from federal interpretations of antitrust law,"" Romero, 242 P.3d at 291. Thus, throughout this opinion, the Court 
relies upon federal authority [**30]  interpreting the Sherman Act in deciding the NMAA claims. "

effectively a refusal to deal. Similarly, in Six Twenty-Nine Productions Inc. v. Rollins Telecasting, Inc., 365 F.2d 478 (5th Cir.

Montanez v. Cass, 1975- NMCA 142, 89 N.M. 32, 546 P.2d 1189, 1195 (N.M. Ct. App. 1975) (""It has long been the policy of our 
courts to follow in the footsteps of the Restatement of Torts, 2d.""), rev'd in part on other grounds sub nom N.M. Elec. Serv. Co. v. 
Montanez, 1976- NMSC 028, 89 N.M. 278, 551 P.2d 634 (N.M. 1976); see also Coffey v. U.S., 906 F. Supp. 2d 1114, 1170 n.31 
(D.N.M. 2012). Although there is a Restatement (Third) of Torts, the Supreme Court of New Mexico has relied on it primarily in 
the contexts of products liability, see, e.g., Brooks v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 1995 - NMSC 043, 120 N.M. 372, 902 P.2d 54 (1995), 
apportionment of liability, see, e.g., Baker v. Hedstrom, 2013-NMSC-043, 309 P.3d 1047, 2013 WL 4760950 (N.M. 2013), and 
foreseeability with respect to liability for physical and emotional harm, see, e.g., Rodriguez v. Del Sol Shopping Ctr. Assocs., 
L.P., 2014 - NMSC 014, 326 P.3d 465, 467 (N.M. 2014). Because New Mexico courts have relied upon the Restatement 
(Second) of Torts in the absence of controlling precedent, this Court likewise relies upon the Restatement to predict how the 
New Mexico Supreme Court would rule. Cf. Guidance Endodontics, LLC v. Lentsply Intern., Inc., 708 F. Supp. 2d 1209, 1253 
(D.N.M. 2010) (citations omitted). "
1591,17," The LensCrafters court did not hold that the claimant's argument that LensCrafters interfered with his prospective contracts by 
the improper means of misleading patients lacked merit because Kehoe failed to present evidence that LensCrafters acted with 
a sole motive to harm. [**95]  See 282 P.3d at 768. Rather, the court held that Kehoe could not establish his claim because 
Kehoe failed to present any evidence in support of his allegation that LensCrafters intentionally misled patients. See id. Thus, 
the court's statement that Kehoe's evidence was not enough to ""establish . . . actual interference based on a motivation other 
than profit"" is dicta. Id. "
1593,18," The Court does not consider Defendants' additional arguments in favor of dismissal because the Court dismisses Plaintiff's 
injurious falsehood claim on the ground Plaintiff failed to plead special damages. "
1597,19," The Tenth Circuit has distinguished between two types of mail fraud violations: ""violations based on schemes 'to defraud' and 
those based on schemes 'for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or 
promises.'"" U.S. v. Kennedy, 64 F.3d 1465, 1476 (10th Cir. 1995) (internal quotations omitted). The Circuit has held ""that 
schemes to defraud need not . . . contemplate the use of affirmative misrepresentations."" Id. (citing U.S. v. Cronic, 900 F.2d 
1511, 1513-14 (10th Cir. 1990)). Rather, it is only when ""alleg[ations of] mail fraud [are] based on the statute's second type of 
scheme"" that ""[f]alse or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises"" are required. Id. (citing Cronic, 900 F.2d at 1513-14). 
Plaintiff argues that because its RICO claim is premised on a scheme [**116]  to defraud, it may state a claim through 
allegations of implicit—rather than explicit—misrepresentations. "
1601,20," That the alleged harm to Plaintiff and the RICO violation are unrelated to one another, and therefore distinct, is further 
illustrated by the fact that Defendants could have issued the mandate for any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted 
fraudulent scheme involving the pharmaceutical companies. Cf. Anza, 547 U.S. at 458-59 (holding that proximate cause did not 
exist [**130]  because the harm and violation were not sufficiently related and explaining that the defendant ""could have lowered 
its prices for any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of fraud,"" ""that the defendant's ""lowering of prices in no 
sense required it to defraud the state tax authority"" and ""that a company commits tax fraud does not mean the company will 
lower its prices""). Issuing the mandate did not necessarily require Presbyterian Hospital to defraud the pharmaceutical 
companies. To the contrary, Presbyterian had an incentive to issue the mandate even if it did not purchase any 340B drugs, 
because Presbyterian would profit—albeit less—on the sale of non-340B drugs. Likewise, that Defendants allegedly defrauded 
the pharmaceutical companies did not necessarily mean that Defendants would issue the mandate."
1601,21," Even if Plaintiff had alleged that Defendants harmed it by increasing their profit margin by buying 340B drugs at a discount and 
selling them to persons not covered by the 340B program, when Plaintiff did not have the same opportunity to inflate its profit 
margin (because Plaintiff is not eligible to purchase 340B drugs), this allegation could not confer standing. The Anza Court 
specifically rejected the argument that a defendant-competitor's scheme to lower prices by fraudulently omitting a charge for 
sales tax was sufficiently related to the harm of lost sales incurred by the plaintiff-competitor because the defendant was able to 
attract more customers. See 547 U.S. at 459-61. "
1603,22," Defendants also argue that the Court should dismiss Plaintiff's RICO claims because Plaintiff failed to allege that Defendants 
made a false statement and failed to allege that Defendant knew of this falsity or was indifferent to its truth. The Court declines 
to address this argument. The Court already has granted the Motion to Dismiss the RICO claims on the ground that Plaintiff 
does not have standing to assert the claims, and this holding is dispositive. "
1605,1," Medina lodged his initial complaint on January 10, 2014. (ECF No. 1). After defendants filed a motion to dismiss, Medina 
amended his complaint as a matter of right on March 21, 2014. (ECF No. 22). Defendants then moved to dismiss Medina's state 
law claims of unfair competition and tortious interference with a prospective business advantage, alleged in his First Amended 
Complaint (""FAC""), on April 10, 2014. (ECF No. 33). This Court dismissed these claims with leave to amend on May 23, 2014. 
(ECF No. 46). Medina filed a Second Amended Complaint (""SAC"") on June 18, 2014. The factual background herein is based on 
the averments in the SAC, which must be taken as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss."
1605,2," The USPTO issued Patent No. 5,081,530 to Medina on January 14, 1992. "
1606,3," This allegation, which comprises Medina's third claim, is addressed separately below, in subsection B. "
1607,4," Because the SAC fails to surpass the initial hurdle of properly pleading sufficiently specific facts to support a conspiracy under 
the Cartwright Act and Section 1 of the Sherman Act, whether defendants were even separate entities maintaining separate and 
independent interests at the time of the allegedly unlawful acts--a point of dispute between the parties—is of little consequence 
to the resolution of the present motion. It bears noting, however, that even if the defendants' alleged actions in furtherance of 
conspiracy took place before Microsoft's alleged acquisition of Canesta and 3DV, this would not be dispositive of the existence 
of a conspiracy. Whether alleged conspirators are ""separate entities"" with ""independent interests"" is an inquiry of competitive 
reality, not legal distinctions. Indeed, it is not determinative ""that two [*12]  legally distinct entities have organized themselves 
under a single umbrella or into a structured joint venture. The question is whether the agreement joins together 'independent 
centers of decisionmaking'"" to deprive the marketplace unreasonably of a ""diversity of entrepreneurial interests."" Am. Needle, 
Inc., 560 U.S. at 195 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). "
1608,5," As noted in this Court's prior order, the California Supreme Court has directed courts to look to the jurisprudence arising under 
section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45, for guidance in applying the ""unfair"" prong of the UCL. Davis v. 
Ford Motor Credit Co., 179 Cal. App. 4th 581, 101 Cal. Rptr. 3d 697 (2009). The factors defining ""unfairness"" under that section 
are: ""(1) the consumer injury must be substantial; (2) the injury must not be outweighed by any countervailing benefits to 
consumers or competition; and (3) it must be an injury that consumers themselves could not reasonably have avoided."" 
Camacho v. Auto. Club of S. California, 142 Cal. App. 4th 1394, 1403, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770 (2006). "
1613,1," At the hearing held on August 25, 2014, Plaintiffs directed the Court's attention to the following statement in Kissell: ""According 
to Biosense, '[t]he essence of the agreement between [Biosense] and the Sales [Representatives] . . . is the requirement that the 
Sales [Representatives] not work for a competing company.' But the terms of the Non-Compete Agreements do not contain such 
a sweeping restriction. Rather, the Non-Compete Agreements contain two more narrowly tailored restrictions."" (alteration in 
original) It is unclear if Plaintiffs assert (1) that because of the quoted statement Biosense should be estopped from asserting 
that it understands the non-competition agreement to be less than a blanket prohibition on former employees working for 
competitors, or (2) that the court's statements after the quoted language from Biosense should either collaterally estop or 
otherwise restrain Biosense from asserting that the agreement is such a blanket prohibition. Regardless, neither of these 
arguments has any merit. The complaint does not allege, nor does Biosense elsewhere assert, that Elsener may not work for St. 
Jude under any circumstance. "
1614,2," Though Biosense submitted some evidence with its motion to dismiss, this evidence is not applicable to its assertion that 
Plaintiffs' complaint is insufficient on its face. "
1616,3, The Court assumes arguendo that being restrained from hiring one's preferred candidate is a cognizable injury. 
1622,4," As the Court represented at the hearing on August 25, 2014, the Court has read the cases cited by Plaintiffs. The Court finds 
each of these cases inapposite. "
1623,1," Plaintiff did not request oral argument on his summary judgment motion, though Defendants did request oral argument on their 
cross motion. The Court denies Defendants' request because it grants Defendants' motion and finds that oral argument would 
not be beneficial in the resolution of this case. See Local Rules W.D. Wash. CR 7(b)(4) (all motions to be decided without oral 
argument [**2]  unless argument is requested in the caption of the motion and the Court grants the request); Partridge v. Reich, 
141 F.3d 920, 926 (9th Cir. 1998) (""[A] district court can decide [a summary judgment motion] without oral argument if the parties 
can submit their papers to the court.""). "
1624,2, BookSurge has since become known as CreateSpace. The Court refers to BookSurge in this Order. 
1625,3," This is not the first time Dr. Joseph has sued Amazon and Mr. Bezos. He brought similar claims against them in 2001, but a 
Northern District of California judge dismissed that lawsuit based on a forum selection clause. University Press, Calif. v. 
Amazon.com, Case No. C01-20902, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26987 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 29, 2001). The same forum selection clause 
resulted in this case being transferred from the Northern District of California to this district. "
1627,4," To the extent the Court concludes that judgment on the pleadings is appropriate, consideration of the ""Open Letter"" is 
permissible because Dr. Joseph's Complaint expressly references and relies upon that document. (See Dkt. No. 1 at ¶ 9.)"
1627,5," While the Court cannot be certain, it appears that Dr. Joseph believes he is automatically entitled to prevail in this lawsuit 
because another independent book publisher sued Amazon in 2009 and defeated an initial motion to dismiss. That [**13]  case, 
Booklocker.com v. Amazon, settled thereafter and never made it to the later stages of litigation. What Dr. Joseph fails to grasp, 
among other things, is that that lawsuit was brought in 2009, merely one year after Amazon initiated its POD policy. And more 
fundamentally, he appears not to understand that the plaintiff in that lawsuit sufficiently pleading an unlawful tying arrangement 
does not mean, therefore, that Dr. Joseph's pleadings—which the Court finds extremely difficult to follow—either state a claim or 
otherwise alleges a timely claim."
1627,6," Even assuming Plaintiff's Complaint sufficiently alleged a timely claim, he has offered no evidence to demonstrate that the 
alleged tying agreement was enforced against him within the limitations period. Summary judgment in Defendants' [**15]  favor 
would accordingly be appropriate. "
1628,7," To the extent the Court assumed the sufficiency of Plaintiff's allegations, Defendant would be entitled to summary judgment, as 
Dr. Joseph has failed to offer any actual evidence in the course of summary judgment briefing beyond the same March 31, 2008 
letter to support his claim. "
1629,8," At most, Plaintiff has highlighted the fact that Amazon offers a type of ""bundled discount"" or incentive to booksellers who use 
its [**20]  BookSurge service rather than other POD services. It does so, effectively, by allowing booksellers to have Amazon re-
sell their books without having to provide five hard copies to Amazon up front if they use the BookSurge POD service, whereas 
the use of another POD service requires those hard copies to be sent to Amazon before the books will be listed. As the Ninth 
Circuit and other courts have explained, ""[s]tanding alone, the fact that a customer would end up paying higher prices to 
purchase the tied products separately"" is not sufficient to demonstrate coercion. Cascade Health Solutions v. PeaceHealth, 
515 F.3d 883, 915 (9th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted)). To sufficiently demonstrate ""coercion"" in these circumstances, a plaintiff 
must provide evidence to show that only a ""trivial proportion"" of sales are made separately; if proven, the fact that the two 
products are rarely, if ever, sold separately ""shows that the package discount is as effective as an outright refusal to sell [the 
tying product] separately."" Cascade Health Solutions, 515 F.3d at 915 (citing 10 Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 1758b at 327 
(2d ed. 2004)). Here, Dr. Joseph neither alleges nor offers evidence to demonstrate that Amazon's book sales service and 
BookSurge POD service are only sold separately in ""trivial"" amounts. Because he has done no more than allege [**21]  and offer 
evidence that it is somewhat cheaper to use Amazon's bookstore if the publisher also uses BookSurge to print POD titles, his 
claim necessarily fails. See, e.g., Aerotec Intern., Inc. v. Honeywell Intern., Inc.,     F.Supp.2d    , 4 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 2014 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 38651, 2014 WL 1017914, at *4-6 (D. Ariz. 2014) (concluding that no illegal tying arrangement existed where 
defendant offered bundled products at a discount because the products were available separately and no other evidence of 
coercion supported existence of tying arrangement). "
1631,9," Dr. Joseph also frames this claim as a ""bait and switch"" scheme. The alleged conduct, however—Amazon's alleged removal of 
special link tags—is not a ""bait and switch"" scheme against Dr. Joseph, as he nowhere alleges that Amazon advertised a 
product to him at a low price for no purpose other than to dupe him into purchasing a higher-priced item. See Walker v. 
Wenatchee Valley Truck and Auto Out, Inc., 155 Wash. App. 199, 215, 229 P.3d 871 (Wash. App. 2010) (""Bait and switch 
describes an offer which is made not in order to sell the advertised product at the advertised price, but rather to draw a customer 
to the store to sell him another [**30]  similar product which is more profitable to the advertiser.""). His claim is thus without merit 
insofar as he intends to bring a bait and switch claim under Washington law. "
1640,1," In addition to these allegations, as discussed below, certain plaintiffs also allege that the warehouses raised prices for storage 
and took actions that impacted [*24]  a regional premium in the Netherlands. These allegations are not particularly developed. 
Separately, plaintiffs also assert state law claims based on the conduct underlying the federal antitrust claims. "
1641,2," There were originally over twenty complaints filed and transferred to or consolidated with others in this Court. A number of 
plaintiffs agreed to consolidate their actions. Thereafter, consolidated and/or amended complaints were filed. Recently, 
Eastman [*25]  Kodak Co. (""Kodak"") also filed a complaint. (Eastman Kodak Co. v. The Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc., No. 14-cv-
6849 ECF No. 1.) However, defendants have not yet moved as to that complaint. Accordingly, this Opinion & Order does not 
address that complaint directly. However, where there are similarities, any future Court ruling on that complaint would follow the 
rationale and determinations herein."
1641,3," The Commercial End Users allege a class period that spans the period from February 1, 2010 forward. (Comm. Compl. ¶ 204.)"
1641,4," There may well be an economically necessary interaction between the value of trading positions in aluminum and actual usage. 
However, none of the allegations in the various complaints describe if, how or why that exists. In the absence of such 
allegations, there is a break in the chain between the actions of the defendants here and the plaintiff users. "
1642,5," There are certain instances in which allegations are of necessity limited to the particular level of the supply/distribution chain 
referenced in a particular complaint. For instance, allegations relating to the roles [*30]  and businesses of the Commercial End 
Users and Consumer End Users are found only in their respective complaints."
1642,6," A ""tonne"" is a metric ton (1000 kilograms). It is approximately 110.2% of an American ton. "

1644,10," The LME trades in aluminum, aluminum alloy, copper, tin, nickel, zinc, lead, NASAAC, cobalt and molybdeneum. (Agfa Compl.

1645,11," A large amount of the inventory in Detroit area warehouses is owned by hedge funds, banks, and traders. (Agfa Compl. ¶ 59; 
FLP Compl. ¶ 383; Mag Compl. ¶ 58.) "
1646,12," In their complaints, plaintiffs frequently make allegations regarding affiliated entities under a single name. For instance, 
plaintiffs sometimes refer to ""Goldman"" when it is clear that Metro is the legal entity whose actions are described. (See, e.g., 
FLP Compl. ¶ 158.) As there are no allegations suggesting any lack of attention to corporate formalities, the grouping of entities 
in this manner is without support and is therefore conclusory. Grouping entities without providing factual support for doing so 
(other than the mere fact of common ownership) cannot support specific references to specific entities, which are necessary for 
the Court to evaluate the sufficiency of the allegations. Thus, where possible, the Court references the specific entity that is the 
subject of the factual allegations."
1646,13," The London Metal Exchange Limited (""LME Ltd."") has also filed a motion to dismiss all complaints on the merits. (ECF No. 
333.) On August 25, 2014, the Court granted LME Ltd.'s motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity grounds. (ECF No. 564.) 
Accordingly, the LME's motion to dismiss all complaints on the merits is DENIED AS MOOT."
1646,14," The FLPs also allege that one or more Jane Doe defendants may have been participants in the unlawful conspiracy, and/or 
that plaintiffs may have purchased aluminum from such entities. (See FLP Compl. ¶¶ 142-44.) But the allegations are unspecific 
as to the Jane Doe defendants' position in the supply/distribution chain, or even what kinds of entities they are."

Fabricators, Inc. (Comm. Compl. ¶¶ 18-26.) "
1649,19, The timing could materially affect the plausibility of plaintiffs' claims. 
1650,20," Plaintiffs' allegations with regard to incentive payments are cast in terms of ""Goldman."" However, the other allegations of the 
complaints only support Metro as the operational arm of the Goldman-affiliated warehousing operations. There are also no 
allegations in any complaint regarding how, who, when, or why any ""Goldman"" personnel would, could, or did communicate with 
Metro personnel with respect to warehouse operations."
1650,21," Notably, the FLPs do not allege how the LME's retention of Europe Economics was transformed into the ""defendants'"" paid 
consultant, rather than merely that of the LME specifically. (Compare FLP Compl. ¶ 193, with FLP Compl. ¶ 198.) Presumably 
this allegation [*60]  is based on the assumption that by virtue of their combined minority ownership interest in the LME's parent, 
defendants could both control the consultant such that it was ""theirs"" and exert sufficient influence to determine whether its 
recommendations would or would not be adopted. However, such an assumption is without support in any allegation."
1650,22," The FLPs also allege the LME agreed with Goldman Sachs to increase storage rates. (FLP Compl. ¶ 203.) The LME's public 
documents indicate that storage rates are set [*61]  by the warehouses themselves and reported to the LME. See London Metal 
Exch., Terms and Conditions Applicable to All LME Listed Warehouse Companies § 5.1.4 (2013), available at 
http://www.lme.com/~/media/Files/Warehousing/Warehouse%20consultation/Warehousing%20Agreement.pdf. While on these "
1651,12," (b)(6) motions the Court does not find facts but construes allegations in plaintiffs' favor, allegations directly contradicted by the 
public record impact plausibility."
1651,23, Mag and Agfa do not allege a monopoly claim.
1651,24," The Class Period is alleged to commence in 2009, but affiliates of Goldman Sachs are not alleged to have purchased Metro 
International and its warehouses until February 2010. It is therefore unclear whether the allegations at paragraph 289 in the 
FLPs' complaint refer to LME warehouses in the greater Detroit area or other warehouses that Goldman acquired, as to which 
there are no specific allegations in the complaint."
1651,25, Agfa and Mag do not explicitly allege a relevant market. (See Agfa Compl.; Mag Compl.) 
1652,26," Neither § 1 nor § 2 of the Sherman Act provides for a private right of action. That is accomplished by § 4 and § 16 of the 
Clayton Act. Section 4 provides for a treble damages action and states that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or 
property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws"" may sue for treble damages. 15 U.S.C. § 15. Section 16 provides "
1653,," for an action for injunctive relief and states that ""[a]ny person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and 
have injunctive relief . . . against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws . . . ."" 15 U.S.C. § 26. "
1654,27, These plaintiffs seek damages for state law competition and other claims. 
1657,28," This case is unlike others in which plaintiffs who are neither competitors nor consumers have been found to have standing. In 
each of those cases, plaintiffs were necessary to the completion of the scheme. See, e.g., McCready, 457 U.S. at 479 (only if 
insureds such as McCready ceased using psychologists would the scheme achieve its purpose); Ice Cream, 253 F. Supp. 2d at 
269-70 (plaintiffs needed to buy milk and cream from defendants at inflated prices for scheme to work effectively). "
1658,29," Mag and Agfa allege that they purchased some aluminum directly from producers (Alcoa and Hyrdo); but it is unclear to what 
extent that would have incorporated the Midwest Premium, and the extent to which those purchases were in the U.S. or 
elsewhere, or whether that matters."
1658,30," Of the FLP plaintiffs, only two, International Extrusions and Talan, specifically assert that they in fact purchased and took 
delivery of aluminum that was formerly warranted in an LME warehouse. (See FLP Compl. ¶¶ 105-15.) But it is unclear as to 
whether this aluminum was warranted in LME warehouses in Detroit or elsewhere, and these plaintiffs do not allege that they 
purchased it directly from an LME warehouse."
1658,31," While these plaintiffs do not assert claims for damages under the federal antitrust laws, and instead assert only a claim for 
injunctive relief, plaintiffs must also demonstrate antitrust standing to assert such a claim. Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 
479 U.S. 104, 107 S. Ct. 484, 491, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986) (applying antitrust standing requirement to claims for injunctive 
relief); Daniel, 428 F.3d at 437; Paycom, 467 F.3d at 290. "
1659,32," To the extent that the FLPs purchase aluminum from traders or others who were themselves paying higher than reasonable 
storage fees; it may be that those traders would not be incented to pursue claims. Traders may stand to gain more from the 
arbitrage opportunity than they lose in increased storage costs. Econometric modelling could presumably predict when the 
arbitrage opportunity would exceed expected costs. In this scenario, the [*92]  FLPs could potentially be the most efficient 
enforcers. However, to support this scenario, plaintiffs would need additional allegations relating to trading dynamics, etc. "
1660,33," Plaintiffs argue that it is premature and unnecessary for this Court to resolve whether a rule of reason or per se analysis 
should be applied in these cases. That is undoubtedly true. But resolution of the issue for fact-finding purposes is separate from 
ensuring that there are sufficient allegations to support the claims themselves. In this regard, when a rule of reason analysis is 
potentially (and, here, likely) required, plaintiffs have an obligation to allege a relevant market. This of course allows the parties 
to conduct appropriate discovery."
1660,34," ""In this Circuit, a threshold showing of market share is not a prerequisite for bringing a § 1 claim."" Todd v. Exxon Corp., 275 
F.3d 191, 206 (2d Cir. 2001); K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs., Inc. v. Walker Mfg. Co., 61 F.3d 123, 129 (2d Cir. 1995) (""If a plaintiff 
can show an actual adverse effect on competition, such as reduced output . . . we do not require a further showing of market 
power.""). "
1665,35," This legal separateness is supported by the defendants' Rule 7.1 corporate disclosure statements. (See ECF Nos. 55, 120, 
123, 124, 261, 262, 324, 507, 519.)"
1665,36," The statement by Blythe Masters cited by plaintiffs in their briefs (Agfa Compl. ¶ 56; Comm. Compl. ¶ 66; Cons. Compl. ¶ 72; 
FLP Compl. ¶ 379; Mag Compl. ¶ 55) suggests only that JP Morgan's ownership of Henry Bath gave it access [*113]  to more 
information and data on the physical aluminum market. Standing alone, it does not provide evidence of anticompetitive conduct 
in the warehouse storage market, nor does it provide any evidence of communications between Henry Bath and JP Morgan for 
the purpose of effectuating a conspiratorial agreement. "
1666,37," Plaintiffs do not allege why the cancellation of warrants would not alone lead to delays in load-outs as the warehouses 
struggled to keep up. "
1671,38," The Court notes that [*133]  defendants made numerous arguments in support of dismissal. It is unnecessary for the Court to 
address every one as those which it has addressed are sufficient at the present to resolve the instant motions. However, it 
should be noted that if plaintiffs present an amended complaint, the Court is not foreclosing defendants from raising any 
arguments in support of futility. The Court will examine any proposed amended complaint and any arguments in response 
thereto. "

treatment of ""obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, 
and social anxiety disorder."" FAC ¶ 22. "
1730,2," The Court GRANTS Defendant's unopposed request for judicial notice as to Exhibits 1-22 and 25-27, and has taken notice of 
the adjudicative facts contained therein. See Von Saher v. Norton Simon Museum of Art at Pasadena, 592 F.3d 954, 960

to Exhibits 23 and 24, the ""Amazon.com Book Search Results."" Unlike the publications, it is not evident to the Court that these 
search results do not vary by user or change over time based on new inventory. See Dorner v. Comm. Trade Bureau of Cal., No.

judicially notice internet search results because ""results for an identical search can vary from day to day""). "
1733,3," The ""proper definition of 'unfair' conduct against consumers is 'currently in flux' among California courts,"" and some appellate 
opinions have applied a more stringent test, particularly for conduct that threatens an incipient violation of antitrust law. Davis v. 
HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., 691 F.3d 1152, 1169 (9th Cir. 2012)."
1733,4," HN8[
] Plaintiff's causes of action under the CLRA, the fraud prong of the UCL, and the FAL all sound in fraud [*20]  and are therefore all subject to the heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Kearns, 
567 F.3d at 1125 (""[W]e have specifically ruled that Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standards apply to claims for violations of 
the CLRA and UCL.""). "
1734,5," HN11[
] The Ninth Circuit has held that claims under the UCL begin to run on the date of the defendant's violation and not the 
date of discovery. See Karl Storz Endoscopy—Am., Inc. v. Surgical Techs., Inc., 285 F.3d 848, 857 (9th Cir. 2002). However, 
the California Supreme Court clarified recently that claims under the UCL are ""governed by common law accrual rules,"" including 
delayed discovery. Aryeh, 292 P.3d at 878. The Ninth Circuit's interpretation of California law is ""'binding in the absence of any 
subsequent indication from the California courts that our interpretation was incorrect,'"" Jones—Hamilton Co. v. Beazer Materials 
& Servs., Inc., 973 F.2d 688, 696 n.4 (9th Cir. 1992) (quoting Owen v. United States, 713 F.2d 1461, 1464 (9th Cir. 1983)). The 
Aryeh decision is a clear indication that Karl Storz Endoscopy incorrectly held that the delayed discovery rule is not available to 
toll the statute of limitations for claims under the UCL."
1734,6," Plaintiff alleges she ceased taking Zoloft on or about August 6, 2006, and used the generic equivalent until June 2008. FAC at 
¶ 99-100. It is not evident that Defendant was the cause of her economic injury from August 2006 to June 2008, because 
Plaintiff does not allege that Defendant manufactures or sells the generic equivalent. Even giving Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt 
that Defendant was the cause of her injury through June 2008, her claims are barred by the statutes of limitations. "
1735,7," Plaintiff relies on ""information and belief"" to assert she would not have been able to access information regarding Zoloft's 
effectiveness even if she had bothered to look. FAC ¶ 104. However, she fails to provide any factual basis for this assertion and 
Defendant's submissions of numerous articles, excerpts from books, websites, and other publications contradict her allegation. 
See Pfizer Inc.'s Request for Judicial Notice in Support of Motion to Dismiss (""Pfizer's RJN""), Exhs. 1-24, ECF. No. 131."
1735,8," Arroyo v. Plosay, 225 Cal. App. 4th 279, 170 Cal. Rptr. 3d 125 (Cal. Ct. App. 2014), is inapposite. In Arroyo, plaintiffs had 
notice of the defendant's mishandling of the decedent's body, causing facial disfigurement. The Arroyo plaintiffs had no reason 
to suspect the defendant had also prematurely declared decedent dead and placed her in the morgue while still alive. In 
contrast, Plaintiff should have suspected that Defendant's claims regarding Zoloft's efficacy were misleading [*28]  since she 
relied on those claims only to experience Zoloft's ineffectiveness."
1735,9, [ILLEGIBLE FOOTNOTE] 
1736,10," These are just a few of the publications that were available to the public before, during, and immediately after Plaintiff's use of 
Zoloft. The Court notes that many of these sources are geared towards the lay public, and discuss many of the allegations made 
in the FAC concerning selective publication, misleading labels, and suppression of negative clinical trial results."

1738,1, Counsel has informed the court that a corporate name change has occurred and Activision TV is now known as Activelight TV. 
1739,2," The Attorney General continues to argue that it did not discontinue its investigation against Activision, because the focus of the 
investigation was on Farney Daniels, not Activision."
1739,3," Count I involved the lawsuit against defendant Pinnacle Bank for infringement of the Activision Patents. Pinnacle Bank and 
Activision have now settled this part of the lawsuit. Filing No. 176, Consent Judgment."
1739,4," In particular, the Attorney General argued that plaintiff and intervenor violated the Nebraska Consumer Protect Act, Neb. Rev. 
Stat. § 59-1602 et seq., and the Nebraska Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. § 87-302. "
1740,5," The defendants respond to this summary judgment, again arguing that plaintiff lacks standing to pursue these claims and the 
claims are moot. However, this court has previously ruled on those issues and they need not be relitigated here. See Filing No. 
111, Memorandum [*7]  and Order at 1-3 and Filing No. 153, Restricted Order at 2. The defendants also argue that plaintiff has 
failed to satisfy the pleading requirements applicable to summary judgment motions. The court finds this argument is likewise 
without merit, as the plaintiff has clearly articulated its position, and the court has reviewed the facts presented to date on a 
number of occasions."
1740,6," In fact, the Attorney General has stated they are not going to investigate plaintiff or its counsel with respect to the patent issue 
and has offered a limited injunction to that effect."
1740,7," Likewise, the RICO statutes referred by the defendant are preempted. See In re Innovatio IP Ventures, LLC Patent Litig., 921 
F.Supp.2d 903, 912 (N.D. Ill. 2013) (holding that pre-suit communications are shielded from RICO claims pursuant to the First 
Amendment). "
1741,8," The court notes that the plaintiff argues the inapplicability of the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act and the Deceptive Trade 
Practices Act. The court need not address them in view of its preemption ruling with respect to Activision."
1741,9," The court has already concluded that this is a First Amendment violation. See Filing No. 41, 12, 14. "
1744,10," The court also notes that MPHJ sent letters of inquiry regarding potential infringement, but these letters did not accuse the 
recipients of infringement. See, e.g., Arrival Star, Inc. v. Descartes Sys. Group, Inc., 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22433, at *36 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2004) (where potentially infringing process is not publicly available, sending letter seeking review of alleged 
infringer's technical documentation reasonably satisfied Rule 11). "
1747,1," Telesaurus VPC, LLC is now known as Verde Systems, LLC, and AMTS Consortium, LLC is now known as Environmentel, 
LLC. (T2 26:17-19; T4 74:20-21; T4 98:21-23 [Havens].) The Court uses the entities' names as they were pleaded."
1747,2," Two defendants bowed out via settlement and two others, defunct companies, defaulted."
1747,3," Another indication of the robust activity in the FCC is plaintiffs' August 22, 2014 letter to the Court [D.E. 287] reporting a filing 
by MCLM — specifically, interrogatory responses — in ongoing proceedings before the FCC. "
1748,4," Telesaurus GB, LLC and Havens do not hold AMTS licenses. (T3 9:1-8; T4 123:16-20 [Havens].)"
1748,5," Mobex Communications was not named in the original complaint, but was later included as a defendant in the operative second 
amended complaint [D.E. 1]."
1748,6," With respect to the § 1 claim, plaintiffs now also ask the Court to enter an order revoking MCLM's AMTS licenses to ""send a 
message"" about the consequences of non-compliance with the antitrust laws in this industry. (Pls.' CL ¶¶ 105-06.) "
1749,7," As the Court held a bench trial, to accommodate MCLM's interest in making a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(c) at the close of 
plaintiffs' case in chief, several of these witnesses, while called by plaintiffs, could be described as defense witnesses, and the 
Court afforded the parties latitude in determining how to present their respective cases. (See T1 33:7-34:2; T5 89:9-17 
(permitting flexibility as to leading questions); T6 110:7-15 (dispensing with formality of labels for certain witnesses that both 
sides intended to call).)"
1749,8," The Court granted Touch Tel's pre-trial motion to quash subpoenas that MCLM directed to Kling and Cooper. (D.E. 260; D.E. 
261.)"
1749,9," On July 16, 2014, plaintiffs filed their proposed findings [*11]  of fact (""Pls.' FF"") [D.E. 283] and proposed conclusions of law 
(""Pls.' CL"") [D.E. 283-1], and MCLM filed in a single document [D.E. 282] its proposed findings of fact (""MCLM FF"") and 
proposed conclusions of law (""MCLM CL""). On July 23, 2014, plaintiffs filed their supplemental proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law (""Pls.' Supp. FF/CL"") [D.E. 286], as did MCLM (""MCLM Supp. FF/CL"") [D.E. 285]. "
1750,10," This entity is sometimes referred in the record to as Telesaurus Holdings GB, LLC. The Court uses the entity's name as it 
appears in the caption of the operative complaint and as Havens referred to it during trial. (T2 25:21 [Havens].)"
1750,11," As detailed below, Mobex Network Services did not participate in either auction of geographic licenses; its only AMTS licenses 
were site-based. "
1751,12, The first auction of geographic licenses was not held until 2004 so the only AMTS licenses available were site-based.
1751,13," The term ""Cooper Dep."" refers to the transcript of the deposition of Robert Cooper dated March 21, 2013, jointly-designated 
portions of which the parties submitted as evidence following trial."
1751,14," Both sides (plaintiffs in their proposed findings of fact (¶ 25) and MCLM through its exhibit D7, a 2007 FCC order) cite to a 
former version of 47 C.F.R. § 80.475(a) as indicating that site-based [*19]  AMTS applicants were required to serve a navigable 
inland waterway less than 150 miles long in its entirety; a navigable inland waterway more than 150 miles long with continuity of 
service along at least 60 percent of the waterway; and, along the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans or the Gulf of Mexico coastline, with 
continuity of service to a substantial navigational area. "
1753,15," As discussed below, Regionet was in fact two companies: Regionet Wireless License, LLC, and Regionet Wireless 
Operations, LLC. As the parties do, the Court uses the term ""Regionet"" except where it is necessary to distinguish between the 
two entities."
1753,16," Plaintiffs characterize the cited portion of the Cooper deposition transcript as representing a ""lengthy objection from [Paging 
Systems'] lawyer."" (Pls. FF ¶ 64 (citing Cooper Dep. 195:12-196:3).) Review of the excerpt suggests that the attribution to the 
attorney is a transcription error. The statements plaintiffs seek to attribute to counsel could not logically have been made by him 
(""That turned out not to be correct, but I didn't know it for years."" ""I remember . . . the gist of the conversation out there.""), and 
the attorney's other objections during this portion of the examination were brief, non-speaking objections. "
1757,17, MCLM had or has a contract for use of the same technology pursuant to its licenses. (T7 92:11-13 [Reardon].) 
1758,18," The Court uses the terms ""concerted action,"" ""agreement,"" and ""conspiracy"" interchangeably as indicating an arrangement 
within the scope of § 1's contract, combination, or conspiracy language. See In re Baby Food, 166 F.3d at 117 & n.3 (stating that 
liability must be based on ""some form of 'concerted action,'"" and noting that term ""is often used as shorthand for any form of 
activity meeting the Section 1 contract, combination or conspiracy requirement"") (internal quotation marks, citation, and 
alteration omitted). "
1761,19," In a designated, but uncited, exchange found in Cooper's deposition transcript, Cooper states that there was no such option. 
(Cooper Dep. 184:25-185:18, 186:22-187:3.) "
1764,20, Paragraph [*64]  78a indicates the second paragraph bearing number 78.
1764,21," Reardon described MCLM's dilemma thus: Q. And, Mr. Reardon, why would you not want to give plaintiffs the most accurate, detailed and thorough information 
concerning your site-based stations, in order to avoid the very interference that you said you don't want to have happen? "
1765,," A. Well, that is sort of asking a conclusion or asking for an opinion that I didn't express. As I have said earlier, [*68]  quite to 
the contrary. If and when this extremely litigious person actually is going to build a site and comes with a—within 120 
kilometers of an existing site and says, I would hope to be at this location with this type of equipment, how do we avoid 
interference? Then I have instructed our attorneys to very clearly make sure that we avoid the interference, because we are 
liable if one of our users gets interfered with. But this is somebody again who is very litigious. And . . . we also need to make sure that information which could be used 
by quote unquote ""bad guys"" doesn't get out in the public domain. So we're also a little sensitive about the fact that the users of the systems are utilities, railroads for public safety, pipelines, 
state troopers, security folks. Q. Why would you then not want to be absolutely sure that there was no interference with these very important public 
functions? A. Well we do want to make sure there's no interference. As Mr. Havens testified himself, sir, he's never built anything. He's 
not even come close. (T9 87:18-89:1 [Reardon].)"
1765,22," At pre-trial stages and at trial, plaintiffs also argued that co-location of stations by the defendants compels the conclusion that 
they must have known about each other's non-compliance. Plaintiffs appear to have dropped that argument, as the only mention 
of it in their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law is that MCLM's submissions ""merely focus[ed] [on] co-location 
matters which are [*71]  a tiny portion of the much larger whole."" (Pls.' Supp. FF/CL ¶ 35.) In any event, even if the Court 
assumes knowledge, as explained below plaintiffs' evidence is insufficient to prove that any non-reporting decision was more 
likely the product of a conspiracy than of an independent business decision. "
1770,23," See, e.g., Deutscher Tennis Bund v. ATP Tour, Inc., D. Del. No. 07-178, D.E. 195 (""Verdict Sheet""), at p. 1."
1770,24," Juries do the same thing when they are told that if they answer ""No"" to the question about whether there has been proof by a 
preponderance of concerted action, they should proceed no further. See Verdict Sheet at p.1. "
1776,*," This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It has been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the 
reader. "
1777,1," Yelp states that the specific benefits of advertising ""have changed somewhat over time."" For example, Yelp no longer permits 
businesses to highlight a ""favorite review"" and now offers a ""video feature"" for advertisers' Yelp pages. "
1782,2," Our holding in Sosa was also influenced by the need to avoid an interpretation of extortion that would impinge on the 
defendant's First Amendment rights. Id. at 940."
1782,3," Although we have noted that California does not have a claim-of-right defense, see Gomez v. Garcia, 81 F.3d 95, 97 (9th Cir. 
1996), the state authority we relied on for that conclusion did not involve threats of economic harm, see, e.g., Beggs, 178 Cal. at 
83 (threats to accuse a person of a crime); People v. Serrano, 11 Cal. App. 4th 1672, 1678, 15 Cal. Rptr. 2d 305 (Ct. App. 1992) 
(recovering debt by kidnapping and holding a person for ransom). "
1783,4," Chan alleges that she purchased advertising after a Yelp representative told her that Yelp could ""tweak"" her reviews if she 
advertised with Yelp. But Chan does not allege that this pledge was part of her advertising contract with Yelp."
1783,5," By the reference to reputational injuries, the business owners may have meant to invoke trade libel law as the basis for the 
wrongfulness element of extortion. But as the business owners have not pled the other elements of trade libel, see Gregory v. 
McDonnell Douglas Corp., 17 Cal. 3d 596, 600, 131 Cal. Rptr. 641, 552 P.2d 425 (1976); City of Costa Mesa v. D'Alessio Invs., 
LLC, 214 Cal. App. 4th 358, 375-76, 154 Cal. Rptr. 3d 698 (Ct. App. 2013), we do not decide whether a sufficient allegation of 
trade libel could supply the wrongfulness element for extortion purposes. "
1785,6, We do so without reaching the question of whether California courts recognize a distinct tort of civil extortion.
1785,7," The business owners suggest that the district court should have allowed them to participate in discovery before granting the 
motion to dismiss, so that the business owners could have marshaled facts to support their allegations. Because the business "
1786,," owners sought discovery relating to Yelp's challenge to their standing, which Yelp does not renew on appeal, and because we 
affirm the dismissal based on the Third Amended Complaint's failure to state a claim, the discovery sought could not have 
affected our decision."
1786,8," Again, we are not considering whether the CDA would pose a barrier to any such claims. "
1787,1," Unless otherwise noted, the factual background is taken from the Complaint, (Dkt. No. 1-1, Notice of Removal Ex. A), and 
Defendant's Request for Judicial Notice, (Dkt. No. 4, ""RJN,"" Exhibits A-J). Defendants asks the Court to take judicial notice of 
exhibits A-J. (Dkt. No. 4-2.) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201, the Court takes judicial notice of [*2]  these documents "
1788,," because they are matters of public record or, alternatively, Plaintiff has cited to them in his Complaint. See Lee v. City of Los 
Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689 (9th Cir. 2001). See also, infra, Section III."
1788,2," The Court notes that some allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint state the Trial Payment Plan payments amount as $2219.49 per 
month. (See Compl. ¶ 35.) "
1791,3," As the Court finds that Plaintiff fails to state a plausible claim for breach of contract, the Court declines to address Defendant's 
motion to dismiss the breach of contract claim based on an asserted statute of frauds defense. See Rivera v. Peri & Sons 
Farms, Inc., 735 F.3d 892, 902 (9th Cir. 2013) (holding that a motion to dismiss should only be granted due to an affirmative 
defense if the defense ""is obvious on the face of a complaint"")."
1791,4," The Court notes that although the Complaint repeatedly refers to plural ""Defendants,"" there is only one currently-named 
Defendant in this matter. "
1799,1," Fittingly, these arrangements are also known as ""pay for delay."" Aaron Edlin et al., Activating Actavis, 28 Antitrust 16 (2013)."

1799,4, These individuals are: Denise Loy; Melissa Chrestman; and Mary Alexander.
1799,5," Along with Warner Chilcott Company, LLC, the defendants include an assortment of Warner Chilcott's subsidiaries and other 
affiliates: Warner Chilcott Public Limited Company; Warner Chilcott Company, Inc.; Warner Chilcott (US), LLC; Warner Chilcott 
Laboratories Ireland, Limited; Warner [**9]  Chilcott Holdings Company III, Ltd; Warner Chilcott Corporation; and Warner Chilcott 
Sales (US), LLC. Collectively, these entities are referred to as ""Warner Chilcott."" "
1800,6," The Court refers to Watson rather than Actavis in order to avoid confusion with the recent Supreme Court decision in F.T.C. v. 
Actavis, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2223, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013)."
1800,7," Citing references are to the Direct Purchaser Class Plaintiffs' Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint and Jury Demand 
(cited as ""DP Compl."") and to the Consolidated Class Action Complaint of the End Payors (cited as ""EP Compl.""). "
1801,8," Importantly, a brand manufacturer is not prohibited from offering its own generic during this 180-day period. When a brand 
manufacturer does so, its generic is referred to as an ""authorized generic."" Of course, a brand manufacturer's decision not to 
offer an authorized generic has the potential [**15]  to increase profits for the initial generic manufacturer. "
1802,9," Watson based its Paragraph IV certification principally on its belief that the '394 Patent was invalid by virtue of the failure of the 
EVMS scientists to accurately report the mixed results of their studies to the United States Patent [**17]  and Trademark Office."
1802,10," See Warner Chilcott Co. v. Watson Pharms., Inc., C.A. No. 2:06-cv-3491-HAA-ES (D.N.J.)."
1802,11, This date was subject to acceleration in the event that Warner Chilcott allowed another generic earlier market entry.
1802,12," A pledge by a brand manufacturer not to launch an authorized generic is often referred to as a ""no authorized generic 
agreement."""
1802,13," See Warner Chilcott LLC v. Lupin Ltd., C.A. No. 1:09-cv-673-JCJ (D. Del.). "
1803,14," In addition, Lupin allegedly received approximately $4 million to defray certain costs associated with the parties' prior litigation.

1804,16," Rule of reason analysis demands a determination as to ""whether under all the circumstances of the case the restrictive 
practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition."" Arizona v. Maricopa Cnty. Med. Soc'y, 457 U.S. 332, 343, 102 S. 
Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982). Courts engaging in rule of reason analysis consider three primary factors: (1) whether ""the 
alleged agreement involved the exercise of power in a relevant economic market,"" (2) whether ""this exercise had anti-
competitive consequences,"" and (3) whether ""those detriments outweighed efficiencies or other economic benefits."" Stop & 
Shop Supermarket Co. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of R.I., 373 F.3d 57, 61 (1st Cir. 2004). "
1807,17, Aside from the modest cost defrayment paid to Lupin. 
1808,18," In fact, the Actavis majority seems to acknowledge this reality. See 133 S. Ct. at 2234-35 (noting that when there is ""payment 
in return for staying out of the market . . . [t]he patentee and the challenger gain; the consumer loses""). "
1809,19," While today's ruling resolves the Sherman Act claim brought by the Direct Purchasers, as well as the federal antitrust claims 
brought by the End Payors, the End Payors' state antitrust, consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims remain. The Court 
is aware that the Plaintiffs may wish to seek interlocutory review before the End Payors proceed with these claims. For this 
reason, the Plaintiffs [**42]  are invited to file a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) (or another relevant provision of law) within 45 
days of the date hereof. In addition, the Court notes that the parties extensively briefed a separate series of questions, including whether the Plaintiffs 
adequately pled market power in a relevant market, whether the federal antitrust claims were brought within the statute of 
limitations, and whether many of the state law-based claims are subject to dismissal on standing and other grounds. Based on 
the holding set forth above, the Court need not address these issues. In the event that the First Circuit or the Supreme Court 
reverse this Court's decision and remand the action for further proceedings, the Defendants will be given an opportunity to seek 
dismissal on these grounds. "
1828,1," The Court's End-Payor class certification is currently under appellate review by the First Circuit. See United States Ct. Appeals

1836,3," The Retailer Plaintiffs also refer in their brief to evidence of a July 2007 settlement conference convened by Judge Pisano and 
""attended by three of the four conspirators (AstraZeneca, Ranbaxy and Teva)."" Retailer Pls.' Conspiracy Opp'n 7. No party has 
offered substantive evidence, however, that the Defendants used the conference to coordinate with each other. The Court gives 
no weight to the Retailer Plaintiffs' mention of the conference, because without more, the Defendants' compulsory attendance at 
a court-ordered conference ought not be construed even as weak evidence of concerted action. "
1839,4," In a case very similar to this one, discussed infra, Judge Goldberg of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has ruled this 
language mere dicta and thus inapposite, because the Masonite conspiracy was proven by direct evidence. See King Drug Co. 
of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., Civil Action Nos. 2:06-cv-1797, 2:06-cv-1833, 2:06-cv-2768, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84818, 
2014 WL 2813312, at *13 (E.D. Pa. June 23, 2014). The Court sees no reason so to downplay this reasoning. The Supreme 
Court's language quoted here simply establishes that an illegal conspiracy can exist under the described conditions. Whether 
the Masonite Court also observed the presence of direct evidence of conspiracy does not affect the controlling nature of the 
principle it endorsed in this part of its opinion. "
1841,5," Contrary to Judge Goldberg's characterization, In re Modafinil Litig., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84818, 2014 WL 2813312, at *12-
13, joining such an arrangement must have, at that point, been an economically rational proposition, because the toy 
manufacturers would not otherwise have agreed to it. "
1852,6," These three scenarios do not represent all possible timelines under which Ranbaxy allegedly could have come to market, but 
they are the only possibilities meaningfully discussed by the Plaintiffs. Other variations, the Court presumes, are so unlikely as to 
be completely unrealistic. "
1853,7," The Court notes, however, that this report does not offer primary evidence (e.g., sales data) to support this conclusion."
1853,8," Note that under this scenario, Ranbaxy still would have had to receive approval for a site transfer by 2012, so the 
considerations discussed supra apply, albeit with significantly more time for the transfer to be approved. "
1854,9," Note that under this scenario, Ranbaxy still would have had to both receive approval for an AIP and then a site transfer by 
2014. Thus, the considerations discussed supra apply, albeit with more time for the regulatory approvals to be secured. "
1856,10," The Plaintiffs do not supply evidence that would warrant [**116]  reconsideration of the first and third counterfactual scenarios 
proposed in their original motion. The evidence does not touch on the possibility that Ranbaxy could have come to market before 
February 2009. The evidence also does not clearly address the January 2012 consent decree, nor does it offer further insight 
into how Ranbaxy would have been able to comply with it in time to launch before May 2014."
1856,11," For example, the MMA provides for first-filer exclusivity forfeiture if the first filer does not timely obtain [**118]  tentative ANDA 
approval, or if the first filer does not timely come to market after a final court judgment that the underlying patents are invalid, 
unenforceable, or not infringed. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(D)(i)(I)(aa), (bb)(AA). As is well-established in the record by now, 
Ranbaxy received timely tentative approval, and its settlement with AstraZeneca ensured that there would be no final judgment 
of patent invalidity, unenforceability, or lack of infringement. "
1862,12," That said, it is true that had the Court been able to adhere to its original March trial date (it was not due to the unexpected 
obligation to try a massive criminal case, United States v. O'Brien, 4:12-cr-40026-WGY), the Plaintiffs would have been caught 
short and their carefully constructed theory would have collapsed, as McGuire's originally flawed methodology was (and is) 
unacceptable to the Court. It is only the unavoidable continuance of the case to the October running trial list that has permitted 
the Plaintiffs to cobble together this theoretically acceptable analysis. "
1866,13," Many commentators have pointed out the high reversal rate of patent decisions appealed to the Federal Circuit, particularly 
when claim construction issues are under review. See, Ted L. Field, ""Judicial Hyperactivity"" in the Federal Circuit: An Empirical 
Study, 46 U.S.F. L. Rev. 721, 722-23 (2012) (reviewing literature). Further, empirical studies have found that the Federal Circuit 
reverses claim construction decisions as much as 44 percent of the time. Id at 722. In patent cases overall, the Federal Circuit 
reversed 28.8 percent of decisions in the first half of 2010, while the Second, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits' combined 
average reversal rate in January and February 2010 was 14.0 percent. Id. at 759 tbl. 9. The study concluded that, ""the reversal 
rates of the Federal Circuit in patent cases were significantly greater than the reversal rates of the regional circuits."" Id. at 776."
1866,14," Patent litigation in the federal courts frequently has been criticized for being slow and inefficient, due to unusually high reversal 
rates and problems with forum shopping. [**155]  See Jeanne C. Fromer, Patentography, 85 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1444, 1446, 1463 
(2010); see also id. at 1465 (""[F]orum shopping can be economically inefficient because it can waste resources when litigants 
fight over the appropriate forum or when one litigant is severely inconvenienced by a remote forum choice.""). One empirical 
study has found that the median time-to-trial for patent cases is around three years, although this varies across jurisdictions.

1867,15," With regard to whether a reverse payment was made in these settlements, Teva and DRL are similarly situated. Both 
settlements, unlike the Ranbaxy settlement, involved the forgiveness of contingent liabilities. Also, as non-first-filers, both Teva 
and DRL faced the additional barrier to generic entry of being subject to Ranbaxy's 180-day marketing exclusivity period. "
1871,16," More specifically, AstraZeneca points out that the proposed overcharge model fails to account for inflation in the price of brand 
Nexium, the Direct Purchasers' profit margins on the resale of brand and generic Nexium, and their expected generic Nexium 
sales volumes in the relevant time period. AstraZeneca Mem. Actual Injury 2, 9, 10."
1871,17," As this Court has explained in previous opinions, generic bypass describes a common market [**173]  dynamic whereby 
retailers typically purchase branded drugs from wholesalers like the Direct Purchasers, but then switch to purchasing drugs 
directly from the manufacturer once a generic version becomes available. See In re Relafen Antitrust Litig., 346 F. Supp. 2d 349, 
368-69 (D. Mass. 2004); see also In re Nexium, 296 F.R.D. at 56-57. "
1872,18," When the Court considered AstraZeneca's motion in February 2014, it denied summary judgment partially on the [**176]  
basis that AstraZeneca's arguments were not yet ripe; at the time, the Retailer Plaintiffs still had an opportunity to file for 
exclusion from the Direct Purchaser class. See Order, Feb. 12, 2014, ECF No. 857. As that window has closed, the Court 
focuses its discussion here on the merits. "
1873,19," AstraZeneca briefly has raised the argument that these agreements violate ""non-assignment"" clauses in AstraZeneca's 
distribution [**180]  contracts with the Assigning Wholesalers. AstraZeneca Assigned Claims Mem. 6 n.4. No evidence of said 
distribution contracts or even specific contractual language has been introduced, however, to support AstraZeneca's assertion. 
The Court therefore dismisses this argument. "
1874,20," The Retailer Plaintiffs allege in their amended [**184]  complaint that Ranbaxy's but-for generic entry date would have been 
""on or about December 1, 2008."" Am. Compl. & Demand Jury Trial ¶ 2, ECF No. 515. Although this is obviously different from 
the Direct Purchasers' allegation that but-for generic entry would have occurred in August 2008, the discrepancy does not bear 
on the Court's disposition of this motion. "

1876,1," The CUTPA count is Count Two of the amended complaint insofar as the Journal expressly preserved the CAA count in Count 
One for an appeal of the court's decision. "
1877,2," Specifically, in striking the CAA count, this [*4]  court ruled that the amended complaint failed to allege specific facts to meet 
the standard for predatory pricing because ""[t]he complaint [wa]s silent as to the price for which the paper is being sold by the 
defendant and silent as to any facts from which an appropriate measure of its costs might be inferred or a comparison of same 
to the former made,"" because ""[t]he complaint fail[ed] to state how or in what manner, elimination of the plaintiff will likely lead to 
recoupment of the defendant's costs or losses,"" and because there was ""no specific allegation [of specific intent] or allegation 
from which such specific intent to destroy competition may be inferred."" Journal Publishing Co., Inc. v. Hartford Courant Co.,

LEXIS 3027 (November 26, 2013, Dooley, J.). The court does not, herein, repeat the voluminous body of both state and federal 
law which informed these determinations. "
1879,3," As previously noted, [*11]  whether Connecticut will continue to follow the so-called cigarette rule in light of federal precedent 
which has essentially eschewed certain aspects of the rule, remains unanswered by our Supreme Court.See, Ulbrich v. Groth, 
310 Conn. 375, 78 A.3d 76 (2013)."
1879,4," As noted by Judge Hodgson, ""The reason for this outcome is plain. Were the courts to hold otherwise, a plaintiff could impose 
liability for statutory violations via CUTPA even though he or she was unable to prove all the essential elements of the statute 
invoked, with the effect of removing the requirements of such statutes."" Lavoie v. Bayer Corp., Superior Court, judicial district of 
Waterbury, Complex Litigation Docket, Docket No. X01-CV-01-01683920-S (January 23, 2002, Hodgson, J.) (31 Conn. L. Rptr. 
391, 396, 2002 Conn. Super. LEXIS 205). "
1880,5," The CAA is patterned after federal antitrust legislation and therefore, Connecticut courts are specifically directed to look to the 
federal courts for guidance on the interpretation and enforcement of these statutes. Conn. Gen. Stat.§35-44b. (""It is the intent of 
the General Assembly that in construing section 35-24 to 35-46, inclusive, the court of this state shall be guided by 
interpretations given by the federal courts to federal antitrust statutes."") See also, Westport Taxi Service, Inc. v. Westport Transit 
District, 235 Conn. 1, 15-16, 664 A.2d 719 (1995) (""[W]e follow federal precedent when we interpret the act unless the text of our 
antitrust statutes, or other pertinent state law, requires us to interpret it differently.)."
1880,6," In striking the previously pled CAA count, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to adequately set forth either below cost 
pricing or recoupment. The court's analysis, in large measure, has equal application [*18]  to this complaint. "
1881,7," Again, the plaintiff does not concede the correctness of the court's prior ruling, but has acknowledged that the deficiencies 
found therein were not all addressed in the revised amended complaint."
1881,8," Plaintiff's suggestion that the public [*20]  policy embodied in the First Amendment supports the CUTPA claim as to the 
attempted monopolization of the marketplace of ideas is misplaced and rejected. It is not the purpose of the first amendment to 
protect plaintiffs in the newspaper business against fair, lawful competition in the marketplace of ideas. Thus, absent conduct 
that gives rise to the underlying antitrust claim, the public policy embodied in the first amendment is not implicated. "
1897,1," If the applicant certifies under paragraphs I or II, the FDA may approve the ANDA after its review of the application. See 21 
U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(i). If the applicant certifies under paragraph III, the FDA will not approve the application until after the 
patent for the listed drug has expired. See id. § 355(j)(5)(B)(ii). "
1898,2," HN5[
] As required on a motion to dismiss, the Court takes all plausible factual allegations contained in plaintiffs' Complaints 
to be true."
1898,3," There is a discrepancy in the end-payor plaintiffs and direct-purchaser plaintiffs' Complaints on this point. The direct-purchaser 
plaintiffs allege that ""Kos sought and received seven patents to cover the formulation and method-of-use for Niaspan,"" DP

""at risk"" means the generic manufacturer knows it may be liable for patent infringement but chooses to enter the market 
anyway. If a generic loses the infringement suit, a court may award treble damages for willful infringement.""). "
1900,5," Sixteen of these lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and one lawsuit was filed 
in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. "
1902,6," U.S. District Judge William Young's decision in In re Relafen Antitrust Litigation, 286 F. Supp. 2d 56 (D. Mass. 2003), on which 
defendants rely, is inapposite. In that case, Judge Young refused to apply the continuing-violation doctrine to a suit brought by a 
generic drug manufacturer against a competitor for ""litigat[ing] a sham lawsuit,"" but he expressly distinguished such a claim from 
a claim in which a purchaser sues for ""the continuing act of charging higher prices."" Id. at 62. In the latter type of case, Judge 
Young explained, ""[t]he continuing act of charging higher prices [would be a] continuing violation, and a plaintiff [would] not be 
limited by the initial acts of predatory pricing by the defendant."" Id. To the extent there is any ambiguity as to Judge Young's 
position in In re Relafen, in In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litigation, Judge Young expressly held that ""every time the 
Direct Purchasers were overcharged for brand Nexium, they suffered a cognizable injury."" 968 F. Supp. 2d 367, 400 (D. Mass. 
2013)."
1902,7," The parties have not briefed, and thus the Court will not decide at this juncture, what filing date(s) applies. Furthermore, 
although defendants have attached to their Motion to Dismiss an appendix containing a chart with the limitations periods 
applicable to the end-payor plaintiffs' various state-law claims, absent briefing on the applicable tolling and accrual rules, the 
Court declines to address the timeliness of the end-payor plaintiffs' state-law claims at this time on the ground that consideration 
of this issue would be premature. "
1903,8," Moreover, the Court rejects plaintiffs' argument that they have satisfied this prong by alleging that the conspiracy was ""self-
concealing."" ""Reasonable diligence . . . remains a separate element for tolling even when there is a so-called 'self-concealing 
conspiracy,' which only makes it unnecessary to show affirmative acts of concealment."" Quigley v. E. Bay Mgmt., Inc., No. 13-
cv-3998, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82752, 2014 WL 2765076, at *3 (E.D. Pa. June 18, 2014). Moreover, the alleged conspiracy in 
this case ""cannot be characterized as a self-concealing fraud"" given that, inter alia: (1) ""the challenged agreements [did not] 
require secrecy to take effect,"" (2) with the exception of certain details noted above, ""the agreements . . . were immediately 
disclosed to the public,"" and (3) ""the 'scheme' established by defendants would not, and in fact did not, dissolve once the 
agreements were made public [in full]."" In re Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig., 261 F. Supp. 2d 188, 224 (E.D.N.Y. 
2003). "
1904,9," Defendants have moved for the Court to take judicial notice of various public filings in order to establish that plaintiffs were on 
notice of the facts underlying their causes of action well before plaintiffs filed suit. In light of the Court's conclusion that plaintiffs' 
allegations are insufficient to plead fraudulent concealment with particularity, this part of defendants' Motion for Judicial Notice is 
moot."
1904,10," Indeed, the Supreme Court in FTC v. Actavis recognized the value of a no-AG provision to a generic manufacturer. 133 S. Ct. 
2223, 2229, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013) (noting that ""th[e]180-day period of exclusivity can prove valuable, possibly 'worth several

to sell a generic version of the brand-name product . . . can be worth several hundred million dollars."")."
1905,11," While declining to definitively rule on whether a no-AG provision can constitute a reverse payment, two other U.S. district 
courts, both in this Circuit, have expressed skepticism of the argument that defendants advance in this case. See In re

Stewart, Deputy Solicitor General) (""[T]he kind of settlement that we would regard as legitimate[ is] where the parties simply 
agree to a compromise date of generic entry, then the parties would certainly take into account their own assessment of what 
would likely happen at the end of the suit. . . . And the problem with the reverse payment is that it gives the generic an incentive 
to accept something other than competition as a means of earning money.""); id. at 20 (Malcolm L. Stewart, Deputy Solicitor 
General) (noting that ""the natural effect of [a reverse] payment is not to facilitate . . . a picking of a point between the dates that

overcharge[s] w[ill] be apportioned among the various plaintiffs."" 431 U.S. 720, 745, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977). "
1912,22," Defendants also move to dismiss the end-payor plaintiffs' claim brought under South Dakota's consumer-protection statute for 
failure to state a claim, however, as discussed supra, the Court already has concluded [**57]  that the named end-payor 
plaintiffs do not have constitutional standing to bring any claims under South Dakota law. "
1913,23," In defendants' opening brief, they also cite a case for the proposition that Rhode Island's Deceptive Trade Practices Act ""does 
not [**61]  apply to 'all those activities and businesses which are subject to monitoring by state or federal regulatory bodies or 
officers.'"" Mot. to Dismiss at 33 n.21 (quoting State v. Piedmont Funding Corp., 119 R.I. 695, 382 A.2d 819, 822 (R.I. 1978)). 
However, after the end-payor plaintiffs asserted in response that ""private prescription pharmaceutical pricing is not regulated by 
any government entity,"" Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 37, defendants did not address the issue in their Reply. The Court declines 
to rule on this issue in view of that limited briefing. "
1914,24," The Court notes that there is authority for the proposition that an issue raised for the first time in a reply is deemed to be 
waived. See, e.g., United States v. Martin, 454 F. Supp. 2d 278, 281 n.3 (E.D. Pa. 2006) (""A reply brief is intended only to 
provide an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised in the response brief; it is not intended as a forum to raise new 
issues.""); Bishop v. Sam's East, Inc., No. 08-cv-4550, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53082, 2009 WL 1795316, at *5 (E.D. Pa. June 23, 
2009) (ruling that an issue raised for first time in a reply brief ""is waived"")."
1914,25," Defendants also move to dismiss the end-payor plaintiffs' Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, 
Oklahoma, and Washington unjust-enrichment claims for failure to state a claim, however, as discussed supra, the Court already 
has concluded that the named end-payor plaintiffs do not have constitutional standing to bring any claims under laws of these 
states. "
1915,26," With respect to these eight states, plaintiffs only cite two cases both of which are inapposite. In In re K-Dur Antitrust Litigation, 
338 F. Supp. 2d 517 (D.N.J. 2004), Judge Joseph Greenaway did not consider the end-run argument. Likewise, plaintiffs' 
citation to In re G-Fees Antitrust Litigation, 584 F. Supp. 2d 26 (D.D.C. 2008), is unavailing. That district-court case, which is not 
binding on this Court, is an outlier decision in which the court held ""that a state's adherence to the rule of Illinois Brick. . . [does 
not necessarily] dispossess[] [a purchaser] of his right to pursue a common law equitable remedy."" Id. at 46. The Court already 
has expressly rejected that position, as discussed supra. "
1917,27," The sole case cited by defendants in support of their position, see Sheet Metal Workers Local 441 Health & Welfare Plan v. 
GlaxoSmithKline, PLC, 737 F. Supp. 2d 380, 429 (2010), does not address this issue. "
