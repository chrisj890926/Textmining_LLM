23,1," The background facts are drawn from Plaintiffs' second amended complaint, with all non-conclusory factual allegations 
accepted as true. Docket No. 100-1; see Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868 (2009)."
23,2," According to Plaintiffs, allergen immunotherapy is a process of introducing allergens incrementally into a patient's system to 
desensitize the patient to such allergens. See Second Am. Comp. ¶ 35. It is the only known cure to allergic rhinitis for seasonal 
and perennial allergies. Id. Over-the-counter and prescription allergy medications merely mask allergy symptoms, but do not 
cure the problem. Id. The Court refers to allergy testing and allergen immunotherapy as ""allergy care."" "
24,3, The ABAI is not a defendant in this case.
24,4," These physicians are referred to as ""board-certified physicians"" or ""allergists."""
24,5," Third-party payors include commercial insurance companies, managed care health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. See 
Second Am. Compl. ¶ 36. "
25,6," Plaintiffs have additionally replied in support of their motion to amend, Docket No. 111, and Defendants have filed a notice of 
errata, notifying the Court of an inadvertent typographical error in their reply to their motion to dismiss, Docket No. 112. 
Defendants have also requested an oral hearing on their motions to dismiss. Docket No. 110. The Court denies Defendants' 
request for a hearing since it is able to determine the issues raised in Defendants' motions without additional evidence or 
argument. See Walk Haydel & Associates, Inc. v. Coastal Power Prod. Co., 517 F.3d 235, 241 (5th Cir. 2008) (stating that when 
deciding a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a court has discretion as to the type and amount of discovery to 
allow, and, when appropriate, may hold a full evidentiary hearing). "
26,7," The motion does not address the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' allegations as to individual Defendants. Challenges by individual 
Defendants are addressed in separate motions. See Docket Nos. 83-85. "
27,8," This draft letter is attached to Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and incorporated into the complaint by reference. Mot. 
for Prelim. Inj., Ex. D-9; Second Am. Compl. ¶ 61."
27,9," Plaintiffs incorporated by reference a letter sent by AAAAI, ACAAI, and JCAAI to regional leaders regarding the formation of 
RADAR. Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. E-4; Second Am. Compl. ¶ 68."
27,10," A copy of this newsletter is attached to Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction and incorporated into the complaint by 
reference. Mot. for Prelim Inj., Ex. E-13; Second Am. Compl. ¶ 83."
27,11," The Court quoted this newsletter at length in its order denying Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. See Docket No. 82, 
at 5. "
28,12," Whether conduct is analyzed under the rule of reason or is per se illegal is a question of law. PSKS, Inc. v. Leegin Creative 
Leather Products, 171 F. App'x 464, 466 (5th Cir. 2006) (reversed on other grounds). As explained below, Plaintiffs have 
asserted facts supporting an inference that Defendants' conduct impermissibly restrained competition. Therefore, the Court does 
not decide at this time whether Plaintiffs' antitrust claims should be analyzed under the rule of reason, are subject to per se 
illegal condemnation, or should be analyzed in some other manner. Cf Cal. Dental, 526 U.S. at 779 (""The truth is that our 
categories of analysis of anticompetitive effect are less fixed than terms like 'per se, ""quick look,' and 'rule of reason' tend to 
make them appear."")."
28,13," Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants' ""standard of care"" prohibits patient self-administration of allergy immunotherapy 
shots. See Second Am. Compl. ¶ 91. Plaintiffs assert that physicians who employ UAS often allow their patients to self-
administer allergy shots. Id."
28,14," Plaintiffs also allege Defendants encouraged third-party payors to fix prices ""in an attempt to deny [Plaintiffs] access to 
customers and markets."" Second Am. Compl. ¶ 107. As noted in the Court's order denying Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary 
injunction, the alleged price-fixing can be viewed as a tool for effectuating a boycott of Plaintiffs. Docket No. 12, at 9 n.9. Since 
Plaintiffs' boycott theory survives Defendants' motion to dismiss, to the extent Plaintiffs pursue a price-fixing theory, that theory 
also survives."
28,15," Plaintiffs attach Parkland's letters to their motion for preliminary injunction and incorporate the letters into their complaint by 
reference. Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Ex. F-3; Second Am. Compl. ¶ 95. "
29,16," While Plaintiffs' allegations primarily concern Defendants' alleged contact with third-party payors, including the four examples 
noted above, Plaintiffs also allege Defendants contacted primary care physicians. See, e.g., Second Am. Compl. ¶ 83 (alleging 
that a JCAAI newsletter encouraged allergists to ""educate"" primary care physicians on their ""standard of care""). Additionally, the 
Court notes board-certified physicians are direct competitors to UAS since both board-certified physicians and UAS compete in 
providing allergy care support services to primary care physicians. See JCAAI Newsletter, Docket No. 12, Ex. E-13 (""[Board-
certified physicians] can also provide immunotherapy for administration in [primary care physicians'] office[s], if they wish.""); 
Second Am. Compl. ¶ 83 (incorporating the JCAAI newsletter by reference)."
29,17," See also Allied Tube, 486 U.S. at 497-98,499 n.3 (noting that a jury found the defendant violated Sherman Act § 1 by 
subverting the consensus standard-making process of a professional association, whose standards are routinely adopted into 
law by state and local governments, but withdrawing certiorari on the issue of whether the evidence supported this finding); FTC 
v. Ind Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 462-64, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986) (affirming the Federal Trade 
Commission's finding that a conspiracy among dentists to refuse to submit x-rays to dental insurers for use in benefits 
determinations violated Sherman Act § 1, even though the dentists' policy was allegedly adopted for noncompetitive ""quality of 
care"" reasons); Consol. Metal Products, Inc. v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 846 F.2d 284,289-92 (5th Cir. 1988) (analyzing whether a 
trade association's product certification delay violated Sherman Act § 1 under the rule of reason). "
30,18," Additionally, Plaintiffs' allegations stand in contrast to the facts in Schachar, 870 F.2d at 397. There, the Seventh Circuit noted 
that ""[a]ll the [American Academy of Ophthalmology] did is state as its position that radial keratotomy was 'experimental."" Id. at 
398 (emphasis in the original). The American Academy of Ophthalmology ""did not induce hospitals to withhold permission to 
perform the procedure, or insurers to withhold payment."" Id. In contrast, Plaintiffs allege Defendants induced primary care 
physicians not to practice allergy care on their own or with the support of UAS. See, e.g., Second Am. Compl. ¶ 83. Additionally, 
Plaintiffs allege that Defendants induced third-party payors to withhold payment to primary care physicians practicing allergy 
care and to withhold payment to UAS. See id. ¶¶ 86-99. "
31,19," See also Second Am. Compl. ¶ 35 (""The area of effective competition, and hence the geographic scope of the market for 
allergy testing and allergen immunotherapy from the patient side . . . tends to be relatively localized.""); id. ¶ 84 (Defendants have 
attempted to restrain competition in every local market in the nation. . . . The result of [Defendants'] activity has constrained 
competition in all 25 states where Plaintiffs do business.""). "
32,20," Plaintiffs style their claim ""tortious interference with existing contracts and business relations;"" however, tortious interference 
with existing contracts and tortious interference with business relations are two distinct torts. See Heil-Quaker Corp. v. Mischer 
Corp., 863 S.W.2d 210, 213-14 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1993), writ granted w.r.m., 877 S.W.2d 300 (Tex. 1994) (citing 
RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 766B, cmts. a, c (1979)). The Court considers Plaintiffs' claim for tortious interference 
with business relations below, under the heading ""tortious interference with prospective business relations."" See Faucette v. 
Chantos, 322 S.W.3d 901, 915 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (""This court has recognized that tortious 
interference with prospective contractual relations includes continuing business relations."") (citing Heil—Quaker, 863 S.W.2d 
210 at 214). "
34,21," Additionally, the Court finds AAAPC has standing to bring this claim on behalf of its members. The third prong of the test for 
associational standing—whether the claim asserted or the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the 
lawsuit—is solely prudential. See Ass'n of Am Physicians & Surgeons, 627 F.3d at 550. Since the Court finds AAAPC has 
standing to pursue a Sherman Act claim on behalf of its members, and since AAAPC seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief, 
the Court finds AAAPC has standing to pursue a civil conspiracy claim. See id. at 552-53 (noting that under appropriate 
circumstances, allegations of systematic abuse to association members could be established with evidence from some 
members, and once proved as to some, the violations would be proved as to all sufficient for equitable relief). "
35,22," Additionally, prior Supreme Court precedent established that a principal could be held liable for the anticompetitive acts of its 
agent, acting with actual authority. See Hydrolevel, 456 U.S. at 581-82 (Powell, J. dissenting) (noting Supreme Court precedent 
allowed the imposition of antitrust liability on a principal who had ratified or authorized the acts of its agent). "
36,23," Plaintiffs also allege Dr. Stephen J. Pollard, a business partner of Dr. Sublett, acted on behalf of Family Allergy when 
approaching a third-party payor. Second Am. Compl. ¶ 89."
36,24," See also Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.03 (""[A] third party [must] reasonably believe[] the actor has authority to act on 
behalf of the principal and that belief is traceable to the principal's manifestations."")."
36,25," See also Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.03 (""If the principal places a person in a position or office with specific functions or 
responsibilities, from which third parties will infer that the principal assents to acts by the person requisite to fulfilling the specific 
functions or responsibilities, the principal has manifested such assent to third parties.""). "
37,26," AAAAI, ACAAI, and JCAAI are alleged to be non-profit organizations. See Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 17, 18, 21. The Court 
assumes, without deciding, that the fiduciary shield doctrine could apply to non-profit organizations. See People ex rel. Hartigan 
v. Kennedy, 215 Ill. App. 3d 880, 576 N.E.2d 107, 115-16, 159 Ill. Dec. 438 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991) (applying the fiduciary shield 
doctrine to find the court lacked personal jurisdiction over directors of a not-for-profit corporation)."
37,27, The Court notes that neither JCAAI nor ACAAI contest jurisdiction. 
38,28," Ms. Jones was a star of movie musicals and the 1970s television show The Partridge Family. See Tamburo v. Dworkin, 601 
F.3d 693, 702 (7th Cir. 2010). The article alleged that she drank so heavily as to prevent her from fulfilling her professional 
obligations. See Calder, 465 U.S. at 788 n.9."
38,29," Plaintiffs allege that ""remote practice of allergy"" or ""RPA"" is a term Defendants use to refer to UAS and primary care 
physicians practicing allergy testing and allergen immunotherapy. Second Am. Compl. ¶ 54. "
43,1, The court has set forth the caption in this order to reflect the present parties and their status.
43,2," As in the June 2014 Order, the court finds that re-stating the facts as a whole here, rather than describing in piecemeal fashion 
the various changes that the Supplemental Complaint proposes, serves clarity and comprehensiveness. "
46,3," Plaintiffs' memorandum of law in support of its supplemental motion does include a new allegation that defendants have not 
argued the statute of limitations in other jurisdictions where similar lawsuits have been filed. Plaintiffs have not asserted any 
legal basis for finding that defendants' litigation strategies in other jurisdictions should be relevant to the matters before the court. 
""It is not the obligation of this court to research and construct the legal arguments open to parties, especially when they are 
represented by counsel."" In re Williams, 5:10-CV-49, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85221, 2010 WL 3292812, at *7 (W.D. Va. Aug. 19, 
2010) (quoting United States v. Wantuch, 525 F.3d 505, 516 n. 5 (7th Cir.2008))."
46,4," The court's jurisdiction in this proposed class action is based on district courts' original jurisdiction over certain class actions 
involving diversity of citizenship. 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(2)(A). Federal courts sitting in diversity apply federal procedural law and 
state substantive law. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 736 F.3d 255, 261 n.3 (4th Cir. 2013). In such cases, "
47,," state law governs the applicable statute of limitations and the moment that claims accrue. Granahan v. Pearson, 782 F.2d 30, 31 
(4th Cir. 1985). "
48,5," Equitable estoppel is a substantive issue, not a procedural one, and thus North Carolina law applies. See Leciejewski, 2011 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41677, 2011 WL 1458505, at *2, n. 2."
48,6," While Goodman more recently held that a plaintiff need not ""plead affirmatively in his complaint matters that might be 
responsive to affirmative defenses even before the affirmative defenses are raised,"" and that defendants would be required to 
show that a plaintiff's potential rejoinder to affirmative defenses ""was foreclosed by allegations in the complaint,"" Goodman, 494 
F.3d at 466, it did not address this precedent establishing that a plaintiff seeking to argue equity to avoid the statute of limitations 
must plead facts necessary to show the elements of the equitable doctrine invoked. Thus, the Charlotte Telecasters/Pocahontas 
rule appears to remain good law. "
49,7," Although plaintiffs' original complaint alleged receipt of the October 2004 letter, it alleged that plaintiffs did not become aware of 
AIG Group Insurance Trust's status as policyholder until January 5, 2010. (Compl. ¶ 55, 62)."
49,8," The court notes that a line of cases have held that a plaintiff is unreasonable in relying upon a defendant's fraudulent or 
negligent misrepresentation when he ""could have discovered the truth upon inquiry."" See, e.g., William L. Thorpe Revocable 
Trust v. Ameritas Inv. Corp., No. 4:11-CV-193-D, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 134049, 2012 WL 4193096, at *9 (E.D.N.C. Sept. 19, 
2012); Suntrust Mortg., Inc. v. Busby, 651 F. Supp. 2d 472, 484-85 (W.D.N.C. 2009); Hudson-Cole Dev. Corp. v. Beemer, 132 
N.C. App. 341, 346, 511 S.E.2d 309 (2010). Consequently, [w]hen the party relying on the false or misleading representation could have discovered the truth upon inquiry, the 
complaint [*28]  must allege that he was denied the opportunity to investigate or that he could not have learned the true 
facts by exercise of reasonable diligence. Suntrust Mortg., 651 F. Supp. 2d at 484. However, the court does not find that the facts alleged require such pleadings here. 
Cases applying this rule typically involve misrepresentations of property, where the information allegedly misrepresented could 
have been discovered through a title search and consultation with the register of deeds. See e.g., Barfield v. Matos, 215 N.C. 
App. 24, 43, 714 S.E.2d 812 (2011); Hudson-Cole Dev., 132 N.C. App. at 346. The requirement has also been applied to 
misrepresentations of insurance policies, when reading the policy would have disclosed the truth. Cobb v. Pa. Life Ins. Co., 215 
N.C. App. 268, 276, 715 S.E.2d 541 (2011). Yet, the disclosure that AIG Group Insurance Trust was the policyholder does not "
50,," make clear, on the facts alleged in the complaint, whether plaintiffs could have discovered the truth regarding the nature of the 
policy upon inquiry. Rather, the plaintiffs allege that defendants ""refuse to allow"" plaintiffs access to the master policy. (Supp. 
Compl. ¶ 174). Therefore, the face of the complaint does not trigger the requirement to make additional allegations regarding 
investigation or due diligence. "
52,9," As with equitable estoppel, judicial estoppel is a substantive issue on which North Carolina law applies. See Fairfield Resorts, 
Inc. v. Fairfield Mountains Property Owners Ass'n, Inc., No. 1:06-CV-191, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 52499, 2007 WL 2111379, at *4 
(W.D.N.C. July 18, 2007) (applying North Carolina caselaw on judicial estoppel). "
57,1," As explained above, a ""court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is not genuine dispute as to any 
material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (emphasis added). A fact is 
material if it ""might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law."" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. 477 U.S. 242, 248, 
106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986)."
57,2, Defendants Struhs and Adams are employees of MedImpact. Doc. 1-1 at 3. 
58,3," In a January 26, 2011 letter, PEEHIP counsel explained to the plaintiffs' counsel that the DMR provision of the PEEHIP—
MedImpact contract ""states that 'MedImpact shall process the Claim according to the Eligible Member's Benefit Plan,"" and that 
""[t]he PEEHIP Hospital/Medical plan document . . . states that '[i]n Alabama, benefits are only for prescriptions purchased from 
Participating Pharmacies.'"" Doc. 129-68 at 111 (emphasis in the original)."
58,4," On May 24, 2011, the plaintiffs filed suit in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Alabama. Doc. 1 at 1. The [*9]  defendants 
subsequently removed the matter to this court on June 23, 2011. Id. "
59,5," The court cannot consider the contentions in the brief because ""statements by counsel in briefs are not evidence."" Skyline 
Corp. v. Nat'l Labor Relations Bd., 613 F.2d 1328, 1337 (5th Cir. 1980)."
59,6," Were the plaintiffs to argue that support for their RICO claim is buried in the 6,500-plus pages of documents they filed in 
support of their opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, the court's decision would remain unchanged. 
""There is no burden upon the district court to distill every potential argument that could be made based upon the materials before 
it on summary judgment."" Resolution Trust Corp. v. Dunmar Corp., 43 F.3d 587, 599 (11th Cir. 1995) (citing Blue Cross & Blue 
Shield v. Weitz, 913 F.2d 1544, 1550 (11th Cir.1990)). ""Rather, the onus is upon the parties to formulate arguments."" Id. (citing 
Rd Sprinkler Fitters Local Union No. 669 v. Indep. Sprinkler Corp., 10 F.3d 1563, 1568 (11th Cir. 1994)). "
61,7," Additionally, rejecting a contract is not a predicate act as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1)."
61,8," In their complaint, the plaintiffs identified the predicate acts giving rise to their RICO claim as ""mail fraud, wire fraud, 
interference with the operation [*19]  of employee benefit plans, and/or extortion."" Doc. 1-1 at 11. The court is not convinced that 
any of the supposed predicate acts described by the plaintiffs constitute mail fraud, wire fraud, or extortion. Additionally, the 
court can find no authority supporting the notion that interference with the operation of an employee benefit plan is a predicate 
act as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1961(1); c.f. 18 U.S.C. § 1961 (listing embezzlement from an employee benefit plan as defined by 
18 U.S.C. § 664 as a predicate act for RICO purposes)."
61,9," In spite of the plaintiffs' attempts to insinuate that MedImpact executives tricked the PEEHIP board into voting to remove APNS 
from PEEHIP's network, doc. 123 at 21-22, 44, the board's vote cannot be the requisite predicate act for the plaintiffs' RICO 
claim because it was committed by the PEEHIP board, not the defendants. "
63,10," Although the Simpson report contains an additional heading reading ""MedImpact's Behavior Reduced Competition and 
Harmed Consumers,"" doc. 128 at 20, the ensuing information only discusses harm to consumers, id. at 20-25. "
64,11," The court's decision to remand the plaintiffs' remaining claims is also influenced by the fact that the claims not only relate 
solely to state law, they also raise unanswered questions of state law. See Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 
79, 117 S. Ct. 1055, 137 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1997) (noting that a ""federal tribunal risks friction-generating error when it endeavors to 
construe a novel state Act not yet reviewed by the State's highest court""). Particularly, the resolution of the plaintiffs' negligence 
and wantonness claims requires determinations regarding the meaning of and interplay between Alabama's Any Willing Provider 
statute, Ala. Code § 27-45-3, and its Usual and Customary statute, Ala. Code § 34-23-115. Although the statutes have been in 
effect for more than two decades, Alabama's courts have afforded them little attention. Moreover, as referenced above, while 
this court, when considering the defendants' motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), found that the ""[p]laintiffs 
have pled sufficient facts at this juncture to establish that their common law claims are not dependent on a private right of action 
conferred by"" Ala. Code §§ 27-45-3 and 34-23-115, doc. 12 at 9 (emphasis added), principles of comity, when viewed alongside 
the other factors advocating remand of this matter, counsel in [*30]  favor of an Alabama court determining whether that remains 
the case. "
71,1," Walker Process Eqpt., Inc. v. Food Machinery Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965)."

2389, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126468 (D.N.J. Sept. 5, 2013). "
75,6," Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301, et. seq., in order to obtain FDA approval of an ANDA, a generic 
manufacturer must certify that the generic drug will not infringe any patents listed in the Orange Book. An ANDA must contain 
one of four certifications. A ""Paragraph IV"" certification must state ""that the patent for the brand name drug is invalid or will not 
be infringed by the generic manufacturer's proposed product."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 36.) The impact of Hatch-Waxman on a 
pharmaceutical patent is discussed at length in Actavis. As such, it is not discussed here in length. "

76,8," U.S. Patent No. 4,743,450. "
77,9," ""At risk"" launch, in the context of Hatch-Waxman Act, occurs when a generic manufacturer launches a generic version of the 
branded drug while the patent(s) on the branded drug is in litigation. Such a launch is called ""at risk"" because the court could 
find that the launched generic drug infringes the patent(s), in which case the generic manufacturer would owe damages to the 
branded company."

83,12," As held in In re Lipitor Antitrust Litig., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126468 (D.N.J. Sept. 5, 2013)."
83,13," The Court had some difficulty with the Plaintiff's rationale underlying plausibility. That is, Plaintiffs contend that Ranbaxy's 
amorphous atorvastatin would have been approved by FDA because the FDA was ""under immense pressure"" to approve 
generic Lipitor. (Am. Compl. ¶ 194.) For example, Plaintiffs allege that Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions 
Committee Chairman Tom Harkin and other public officials sent a letter to FDA on March 10, 2011, urging FDA to ""clarify the 
relevant regulatory issues"" so the public [**57]  could afford generic atorvastatin. (Am. Compl. ¶ 195.) This statement does not 
meet the plausibility standard because a public statement by public officials about an active political issue is not a plausible 
conclusion without other support, especially when the statements, like Senator Harkin's letter, have no other legally binding 
effect. In addition, Ranbaxy's amorphous atorvastatin was never approved by the FDA because Ranbaxy amended with a 
crystalline version after the Settlement Agreement was entered. "
85,14," In In re Nexium, AstraZeneca and three generic defendants-Ranbaxy, Teva, and Dr. Reddy's, were alleged to have entered 
into reverse payment agreements to keep a generic version of Nexium off the market. All three generic defendants agreed to 
refrain from selling generic versions of Nexium until May 27, 2014 when some (but not all) of the patents had expired, though 
this was years after the generic defendants were initially [**63]  proposing in their Paragraph IV certifications and arguing in the 
resulting litigations. In return, AstraZeneca agreed to not to produce its own authorized generic version of Nexium during 
Ranbaxy's 180-day exclusivity period, allegedly accruing a value to Ranbaxy of over $1 billion. It is unclear from the opinion if 
there was a cash payment made to Ranbaxy. Also, AstraZeneca forgave contingent liabilities of both Teva and Dr. Reddy's 
related to ""at risk"" launches of generic versions of non-related products. The generic defendants urged the court to read Actavis 
to apply only to monetary payments and the court declined. At the motion to dismiss stage, the In re Nexium court found the 
allegations sufficient to allege an antitrust violation. In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 968 F. Supp. 2d 367, 392 (D. 
Mass. 2013). Later, at the summary judgment stage, the court denied summary judgment made on similar grounds. In re Nexium 
(Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 12-md-02409-WGY, 42 F. Supp. 3d 231, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126954 (D. Mass. Sept. 4, 
2014), ECF No. 977."
85,15," In this case, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the generic defendant Teva are alleged to have entered into reverse payment 
agreements to keep a generic version of Lamictal off the market. GSK allowed certain generic forms of Lamictal to enter the 
market before [**64]  all patent claims had expired, though later than Teva was initially proposing in the Paragraph IV 
certification and arguing in the resulting litigation. In return, GSK agreed not to produce its own authorized generic version of 
Lamictal during Teva's 180-day exclusivity period. The court held that application of Actavis did require a monetary payment to 
have occurred in the settlement and the no-authorized generic agreement was not a payment within Actavis. The court 
concluded that ""the settlement was reasonable and not the sort that requires Actavis scrutiny."" "
87,16," The Complaint seems to set forth ""bottlenecking"" as a separate cause of action. The Court views bottlenecking as an effect of 
the RPSA. Hence, the restraint of trade, if any, focuses on the RPSA rather than the bottlenecking. See Actavis, 133 S. Ct. 
2223, 2231, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343. "
90,17," Similarly, Defendants argue that Pfizer's forbearance of Ranbaxy's potential liability [**81]  did not constitute a ""payment"" 
because Accupril II settlement falls within an exception to Actavis and is a ""safe harbor"" from RPSA liability. ECF No. 490, p. 19-
20; see also ECF No. 493, p. 20. That is, the Accupril II resolution stands on its own and is not related to Lipitor Process 
settlement or the Caduet settlement. The Court disagrees. The Agreement was signed at one single time, and the corporate 
management of each party most likely comingled the facts to determine the settlement's adequacy. To divide the Settlement 
Agreement into segments, as defendants propose, is opposite of what most likely occurred. Here, the facts give rise to the 
conclusion that the Accupril II settlement was likely reviewed in conjunction with the other litigations, and other terms of the 
Agreement. The settlements of three branded drugs in one Agreement circumstantially combines all three drugs into one 
contemporaneous settlement. Settlement Agreement at 26 This is an obvious indication that the parties negotiated each 
settlement with other cases in mind, it is implausible to analyze the agreement unless it is considered as a whole. See Weiss v. 
Mercedes-Benz of North America, 899 F. Supp. 1297, aff'd  66 F. 3d 314(D.N.J. 1995). Thus, Pfizer's safe harbor argument 
does not hold water. [**82] "
103,1," Defendants brought a separate motion to exclude Plaintiffs' expert in violation of the Northern District Local Civil Rule 7-3(a). 
Therefore, the Court STRIKES their separate motion. Nevertheless, because Defendants included their basis for excluding 
Plaintiffs' expert in their opposition to the motion for class certification, the Court will address their arguments to exclude 
Plaintiffs' expert. The Court FURTHER DENIES Defendants' motion to file a sur-reply to Plaintiffs' supplemental brief. "
114,1," Plaintiffs' motion to strike the motions submitted by Wechsler and their motion to vacate the Court's prior decisions are both ill-
founded and are DENIED. The Law Offices of Glenn H. Wechsler can only appear through Mr. Wechsler, the motions were 
timely, there is no evidence that Mr. Wechsler functions as a debt collector within the meaning of the FDCPA, and Plaintiffs do 
not state a claim against him. Further, there is no ground upon which to vacate the Court's prior orders. In addition, Wechsler's alternative motion to strike is rendered moot by reason of this Court's dismissal of all claims against him. "

128,2," The parties confirmed, via a telephonic conference with Chambers, that Defendant did not depose Dr. Phillips or Mr. Taylor."
128,3," Although Dr. Phillips refers to his interest rate as a ""discount rate,"" it does not result in a discount in the common meaning of 
the word. See Hoskie v. United States, 666 F.2d 1353, 1354 (10th Cir. 1981) (explaining that the discount rate reduces an award 
for future loss to its present value). Dr. Phillips, instead, used the rate to adjust past damages upward to an increased present 
value. See Contract Lodging Corp. v. Union Pac. R.R., 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18663, 1991 WL 278482, at *2 (D. Kan. Dec. 19,

well,"" but that it ""[d]epend[s] [] on the specifics of any ruling by the Second Circuit."" Def. Mem. at 8 (emphasis added). And the

150,29, Def. Mem. at 3.
150,30," Id. at 6 (quoting Salerno v. American League of Prof'l Baseball Clubs, 310 F. Supp. 729, 731 (S.D.N.Y. 1969), aff'd, 429 F.2d 
1003 (2d Cir. 1970)). This parsing of Salerno's logic is questionable. The court in Salerno actually said: Since baseball is exempt from the federal antitrust laws by decision of the United States Supreme Court, this complaint fails 
to state a claim against defendant upon which relief can be granted. Having found that no diversity of citizenship exists 
under 28 U.S.C. sec. 1332 and having found that organized baseball does not fall within the scope of the federal antitrust 
laws, this Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter. Salerno, 310 F. Supp. at 731 (emphasis added). In fact, then, Salerno is ambiguous in its characterization of the baseball [**11]  
exemption. It first describes the exemption as a merits issue, and then, in the next sentence, it re-characterizes the issue as 
jurisdictional. Whatever the Salerno court had in mind, this is hardly the controlling authority that the MLB Defendants make it 
out to be. "
151,31," Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 511, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006) (quoting 2 J. Moore et al., Moore's 
Federal Practice § 12.30[1] (3d ed. 2005)). Accord Da Silva v. Kinsho Intern. Corp., 229 F.3d 358, 361 (2d Cir. 2000) (noting that 
courts ""often obscure the issue by stating that the court is dismissing 'for lack of jurisdiction' when some threshold fact has not 
been established, without explicitly considering whether the dismissal should be for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for 
failure to state a claim""). This logic also finds support in the distinction drawn by Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
between (1) dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and (2) dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be 
granted. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12."
151,32," The MLB Defendants' delay in raising the jurisdictional argument only reinforces the point. This case has been ongoing for two 
years, and has already involved extensive fact discovery. Yet it is only now, after losing on summary judgment, that the MLB 
Defendants decided to bring these supposed jurisdictional issues to the Court's attention. When asked at a September 5, 2014 
conference why they did not raise the baseball exemption earlier, the MLB Defendants explained that they ""thought it best, given 
the plaintiffs [**13]  complaint, to be able to present [the baseball exemption argument]"" in connection with ""the best set of facts,"" 
including ""plaintiffs expert report."" 9/5/14 Transcript of Premotion Conference, at 14-15. This analysis strongly suggests that the 
baseball exemption presents a merits issue. The application of the exemption is undoubtedly a question of law. But it is a 
question of law that — as the MLB Defendants acknowledge — depends on facts. The same is not true of subject matter 
jurisdiction, which concerns the Court's power over the type of controversy in general, not on the specific facts of the case. "
157,1," Defendants' motion is brought under ""Rule 12"" generally. The Court construes Defendants' Article III challenge to be a motion 
under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), which is the appropriate vehicle for such a challenge. See Chandler v. State 
Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 598 F.3d 1115, 1122 (9th Cir. 2010)."
157,2," At the hearing, Defendants' counsel [*9]  also made the much broader argument that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the traceability 
requirement — and thus lack Article III standing — with respect to any claim. When questioned by the Court, defense counsel 
acknowledged that the broader argument had not been fleshed out in the briefs. As discussed below, this order dismisses the 
bulk of Plaintiffs' claims with leave to amend. Because amendment could affect its viability, and because it has not been briefed 
adequately, Defendants' broader Article III argument is not addressed in this order. Defendants may reassert the argument in a 
future motion, if appropriate. "
158,3," Actimmune was a civil RICO action, not an antitrust action. "
159,4," Plaintiffs argue that many states' antitrust and consumer protection laws do not require in-state residency or in-state purchase. 
To the extent that Plaintiffs are asserting that they [*15]  have statutory standing under those laws, the FAC does not make that 
allegation clear and does not identify the states in question."
159,5," At the hearing, Plaintiffs' counsel asserted that granting Defendants' motion on this basis will have little effect as a practical 
matter, since Plaintiffs will locate putative class members in each state and move to add them as parties. Counsel argued that it 
would be more efficient simply to permit the claims to go forward under the laws of all states now and thus avoid future 
piecemeal litigation. The Court does not disagree; however, it is constrained by the jurisdictional limits imposed by Article III. "
160,6," In Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1977), the Supreme Court limited the ability of 
indirect purchasers to recover damages under the Sherman and Clayton Acts. ""[I]n response to Illinois Brick, some states 
passed 'repealer' statutes expressly allowing indirect purchasers to recover money damages for antitrust violations under state 
law."" Flat Panel, 586 F. Supp. 2d at 1120."
160,7," Whether AGC applies to a state's antitrust statute [*20]  is a question of state law. In re Flash Memory Antitrust Litig., 643 F. 
Supp. 2d 1133, 1151 (9th Cir. 2009). HN6[
] ""In analyzing questions of state law, federal courts are bound by the decisions of "
161,," the state's highest court"" and ""must follow the state intermediate appellate court decision"" absent convincing evidence that the 
state's highest court likely would not follow it. Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)."
161,8," Defendants rely upon Tenn. Med. Ass'n v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tenn., Inc., 229 S.W. 3d 304, 311 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007), 
for the proposition that AGC should be applied to the antitrust claim brought under Tennessee law. The [*21]  cited case 
involved a medical association's action against a health maintenance organization under Tennessee's Consumer Protection Act. 
The decision cited AGC in the context of a discussion of common law principles of proximate cause. The Court is not persuaded 
that the decision suggests that Tennessee's highest court would apply AGC to state law antitrust claims. "
162,9," While it accepts as true all factual allegations in the FAC, the Court need not accept ""allegations that are merely conclusory, 
unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences."" In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) 
(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Plaintiffs' allegations that ""Titanium Dioxide comprises a significant portion of 
the cost of products containing the chemical,"" that ""Titanium Dioxide follows a traceable physical chain of distribution from 
Defendants to Plaintiffs"" and that ""any costs attributable to Titanium Dioxide can be traced through the chain of distribution to 
Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs"" are conclusory. FAC ¶ 143. Given their implausibility in light of the breadth of products at issue, the 
Court does not accept those tracing allegations as true. "
163,10," With respect to Mississippi, Defendants assert an additional argument that Plaintiffs' claims are barred because they do not 
allege a sufficient nexus between the alleged anticompetitive conduct and intrastate commerce. That argument was rejected in 
GPU II on facts similar to those pled in this case. See GPU II, 540 F. Supp. 2d at 1099 (""Plaintiffs have alleged that defendants' 
conspiracy substantially affected commerce in each of those states, injured residents in those states, that defendants promoted 
and sold GPUs and graphics cards in each of those states, and that defendants harmed competition in those states . . . . 
plaintiffs have alleged that defendants' conspiracy affected commerce within these states.""). This Court likewise concludes that 
Plaintiffs have alleged facts sufficient to plead an effect on intrastate commerce."
163,11," Defendants assert multiple arguments in support of their motion to dismiss [*30]  the claims brought under state consumer 
protection laws. All of the consumer protection claims addressed herein fail because, as presently framed, the complaint does 
not allege facts sufficient to show that the alleged unfair or deceptive price-fixing actually caused Plaintiffs injury. In light of that 
basic pleading failure, the Court need not address the myriad of other arguments asserted by Defendants. If Plaintiffs cure the 
defects noted in this order, Defendants may reassert those arguments in a future motion, if appropriate. "
168,1," In addition to the named Defendants, Plaintiff includes a lengthy list of ""non-party co-conspirators, or aiders and abetters (sic),"" 
which includes a number of attorneys, two other law [**3]  firms, Plaintiff's mother, two Oregon state court judges, and 
employees of several financial institutions. (SAC, ECF 106 ¶¶ 15a-15m)"
168,2," Plaintiff is pursuing this action pro se. This Court construes a pro se plaintiff's complaint so as to give the plaintiff the benefit of 
any doubt. See, e.g., Morrison v. Hall, 261 F.3d 896, 899 n.2 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S. 
Ct. 594, 30 L. Ed. 2d 652 (1972), for the proposition that pro se pleadings are ""subject to a lesser standard than pleadings 
drafted by lawyers""). "
169,3," Plaintiff includes, along with the SAC, two appendices that outline every RICO and ORICO predicate act he claims occurred 
during the pendency of the alleged conspiracy, and the party or parties Plaintiff claims participated in the act: Appendix A, the 
""RICO — Predicate Acts Chart"" (ECF 106 at 114-127), and Appendix B, the ""ORICO — Predicate Acts Chart."" (ECF 106 at 128-
134) "
170,4," Judge Fogel's short, 4-page order granting the motions to dismiss, which Plaintiff himself describes as ""a well-reasoned ruling"" 
(SAC ¶ 81), is cited as Rupert v. Bond (Rupert I), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99610, 2010 WL 3618662 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 9, 2010). "
174,5," These allegations include any activities ascribed to Mr. Zusman himself, or the Markun Zusman law firm more generally."
174,6," Plaintiff describes the Zusman Defendants' alleged participation in predicate acts on pages 6 and 7 of Appendix A (predicate 
acts 23-25 and 32), and page 4 of Appendix B (predicate acts 16-18). However, the allegations in the two appendices do not 
include every allegation Plaintiff alleges in the SAC — for example, it does not include the alleged scheme to obtain Oregon 
declaratory judgments outlined in paragraph 79 of the SAC — and thus the Court engaged in a reading of the entire SAC in 
order to determine the fullest extent of Plaintiff's claims against the Zusman Defendants and the three other Defendant groups. "
175,7," Plaintiff further asserts that the Court cannot determine whether or not the sham litigation exception applies in the context of a 
Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, contending that the Ninth Circuit has held that such a determination cannot be made at the 
pleadings stage. (See Opp. to Zusman Mot. to Dismiss at 10-11) Plaintiff cites for this proposition Hydranautics v. FilmTec Corp., 
70 F.3d 533 (9th Cir. 1995). In Hydranautics, however, the circuit court, recognizing that ""the district court did not reach th[e] 
issue"" of Noerr-Pennington immunity, id. at 538, declined to affirm on that ground. The Ninth Circuit has, contrary to Plaintiff's 
argument, upheld dismissals under Noerr-Pennington immunity in a number of cases more recent than Hydranautics. See, e.g., 
Freeman, 410 F.3d 1180 (""Noerr-Pennington immunity is a sufficient ground to dismiss the complaint as to all defendants.""). "
177,8," Plaintiff includes with this allegation a footnote which describes activity undertaken by several Defendants in this matter, but 
which does not mention Mr. Zusman or the Markun Zusman Compton firm. (See SAC ¶ 79 n.22 (mentioning activities by Susan 
Bond, Matthew Whitman, and non-party Judge Maurer of the Clackamas Circuit Court in Oregon)) [**33]"
177,9," In his briefing, Plaintiff contends that his allegations regarding the Zusman Defendants' conduct regarding their representation 
in Rupert I are pled with the requisite specificity under Rule 9(b). As the Court finds that this Rupert I-related conduct falls under 
the protection of Noerr-Pennington, it does not reach this question."
177,10," Plaintiff does not include a date with this allegation, but does state a date in paragraph 78, March 15, 2010, and opens 
paragraph 79 with the word ""thereafter."" (SAC ¶¶ 78-79) "
178,11," Plaintiff does not allege that this Court has general jurisdiction over the Sibling, Downes, or Cartwright Defendants. (See Opp. 
to Cartwright Mot. to Dismiss at 4; Opp. to Sibling Mot. to Dismiss at 4; Opp. to Downes Mot. [**37]  to Dismiss at 3) "
181,12," nn12 In his Opposition to the Downes Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff briefly argues that the Defendants have 
consented to jurisdiction because they ""have not presented a narrowly focused challenge to personal jurisdiction,"" instead 
making additional arguments as to why the claims should be dismissed that go beyond a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss. (See 
Opp. to Downes Mot. to Dismiss at 25) Plaintiff cites no law for this proposition. A party does not waive a jurisdictional defense 
simply because that defense is raised concurrently with other defenses. See United States v. Ligas, 549 F.3d 497 (7th Cir. 2008) 
(""[T]he federal rules permit defendants to simultaneously seek relief and raise a jurisdictional defense without waiving that 
defense."") (compiling cases); see also Gates Learjet Corp. v. Jensen, 743 F.2d 1325, 1330 (9th Cir. 1984). The Downes 
Defendants did not seek to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) after bringing a motion to dismiss on other grounds. As such, their 
jurisdictional defense was raised concurrently [**47]  with their other arguments regarding reasons to dismiss this action, and the 
Court does not find that they have consented to jurisdiction before it. "
182,13," In his Opposition to the Sibling Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff argues that ""judicial estoppel should stop the Sibling 
Defendants from being heard to argue that Oregon is an alternative forum"" in which this case can be heard. (Opp. to Sibling Mot. 
to Dismiss at 21) (original capitalization omitted). Plaintiff contends in his briefing, as he did at oral argument, that he is civilly 
dead in Oregon. (See, e.g., id. at 22) Plaintiff, however, [**52]  misapprehends the nature of the Court's jurisdictional inquiries. 
The Court needs to determine, for Plaintiff's § 1965(b) jurisdiction argument, whether any other forum could possibly hale all 
Defendants before it. See LeDuc, 814 F. Supp. 820, 826. Having found that Oregon could possibly have jurisdiction over all 
Defendants in this action, the Court then must engage in a specific jurisdiction inquiry with regard to the Downes, Cartwright, and 
Sibling Defendants. There is no reason why judicial estoppel would cause this Court to find personal jurisdiction over any of the 
Defendants in California. "
184,14," Defendants also argue that Plaintiff's ""history of vexatious litigation"" and prior placement on the California Vexatious Litigant 
list is relevant to the Motion for Sanctions. (See, e.g., Reply, ECF 135 at 3) Plaintiff states that he has been removed from the 
California Vexatious Litigant list as of May 29, 2013. (Opp. to Mot. for Sanctions at 14) The Court is not persuaded that Plaintiff's 
former placement on the Vexatious Litigant list is relevant to this Motion for Sanctions, and the Court declines to engage with the 
Downes Defendants' [**60]  argument that Plaintiff obtained his removal from the list by ""omitting from the record at least five 
other cases to which he was a party."" (Reply at 3) "
194,1," The filed rate doctrine does not bar Plaintiffs' claims for injunctive relief. See Square D Co. v. Niagra Frontier Tariff Bureau, 
Inc., 476 U.S. 409, 422 n.28, 106 S. Ct. 1922, 90 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1986)."
194,2," Several Defendants—Thai Airways (dkt. 830), Cathay Pacific (dkt. 919), Qantas Airways (dkt. 926) and Singapore Airlines (dkt. 
927)—also filed motions for summary judgment, which they withdrew upon settlement. "
195,3," The Court is not persuaded that either Aloha Airlines, Inc. v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 489 F.2d 203 (9th Cir. 1973) (which 
predates deregulation and involves a claim that Hawaiian Airlines had attempted [**20]  to monopolize the inter-island air 
transportation system on the Hawaiian islands), or Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 296, 83 S. Ct. 
476, 9 L. Ed. 2d 325 (1963) (which predates deregulation and involves a suit by the government alleging that Pan American had 
violated sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act by interfering with a competing airline's efforts to extend its flight routes in South 
America), answers these questions."
195,4," As Plaintiffs point out, the Court does not have the benefit of a statement from the DOT about whether it understands the filed 
rate doctrine to apply in this case. See Opp'n at 50 (citing Tran Decl. (dkt. 875) ¶¶ 3-6, Exs. 1-2)."
195,5," The CAB was abolished in January 1985 under the Civil Aeronautics Board Sunset Act of 1984 (98 Stat. 1703) and the Airline 
Deregulation Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 1744). The Court will use ""DOT"" throughout this Order to avoid confusion."
195,6," The ADA effectively removed the DOT's jurisdiction over domestic fares and the DOT ceased approving or accepting tariff 
filings on January 1, 1983. See 14 CFR § 399.40; Tariffs for Post-1982 Domestic Travel (April 7, 1982), 47 FR 14892-01 (""the "
196,," intent of the statute would be best fulfilled by reading it to prohibit tariff filings for transportation provided after the sunset date""). 
It is not directly relevant to the dispute at issue, although the parties compare it to the IATCA."
196,7," Plaintiffs offer Michael Levine as an expert on the airline industry and deregulation. Levine Decl. (dkt. 898) Att. A. Defendants 
object to Levine's testimony, arguing among other things that he is not qualified to offer opinions on either Congress's or the 
DOT's intent, as he has never been a member of Congress and never worked at the DOT, only having worked at the CAB from 
1965-1966 and 1978-79, and as a CAB consultant in 1977 and 1980. See Reply (dkt. 917) at 19. The Court recognizes Levine 
as an expert in the airline industry but not on Congress or the DOT's understanding of the antitrust [**24]  laws or the filed rate 
doctrine. Nor does the Court accept Levine's legal conclusions. See, e.g., Levine Decl. ¶ 21."
196,8," Section 414 of the FAA provides that ""Any person affected by an order made under sections 408, 409, or 412 of this Act shall 
be, and is hereby, relieved from the operations of the ""'antitrust laws' . . . and of all other restraints or prohibitions made by, or 
imposed under, authority of law, insofar as may be necessary to enable such person to do anything authorized, 
approved, [**26]  or required by such order."" Section 408 governs the DOT's control over consolidation, mergers and 
acquisitions; Section 409 governs interlocking relationships; and Section 412 governs pooling and other cooperative 
agreements. Section 412(a) requires that every air carrier file a true copy of every agreement between carriers that relates to 
""the establishment of transportation rates, fares, charges, or classifications."" "
197,9," Notably, the DOT withdrew this statement of proposed rulemaking in 2002. See Withdrawal of Proposed Rulemaking 
Action; Statement of Enforcement Policy on Rebating, 67 F.R. 72396-01."
197,10," The Court dismissed with prejudice all of Plaintiffs' claims for alleged price-fixing on flights originating in Asia as barred by the 
Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act. Order Re Mot. to Dismiss at 12. Thus, the remaining claims are limited to flights 
originating in the United States."
197,11," ""Normal"" fares are those with Economy Restricted and Economy Unrestricted fare types, which are a small subset of economy 
class fares that tend to have relatively few restrictions. Fare codes (also known [**31]  as ""booking codes"" or ""fare basis codes"") 
are a way for the airlines to identify exactly what type of ticket a customer purchased. Schwartz Decl. (dkt. 886) at 4 n.3. Fare 
codes could indicate the week, day or time of the flight or a required minimum or maximum stay at a destination, among other 
factors. Id. "
198,12," Plaintiffs contend that many fares in GFS are listed as ""private,"" meaning that they are viewable only by parties that have been 
approved by an airline to view those fares, such as the carriers' network of travel agents. Id. (citing to Schwartz Decl. ¶¶ 10, 13). 
Defendants dispute this, asserting that the DOT may view all of the fare and surcharge information in any ATPCO database, 
including GFS, regardless of whether ATPCO formally ""presented"" the fare or not. Joint Memo. at 7 n.12 (citing no evidence 
other than 14 C.F.R. § 221.180(b), which requires that the DOT be able to monitor all filed tariffs on a 24-hour a day, 7-day a 
week basis); Tr. of Aug. 15, 2014 (dkt. 938) at 29 (Defendants' counsel: ""The DOT has access to the ATPCO database, and can 
see every fare that's in there."")."
198,13," The DOT may designate the fare as: (1) ""Acknowledged,"" if the DOT acknowledged the filing in its entirety; (2) 
""Approved,"" [**33]  if DOT approved the filing in its entirety; (3) ""ApprovedC,"" if the DOT approved the filing with comments; (4) 
""ApprovedX,"" if the DOT approved the filing, except as noted on individual fare, arbitrary, or text information; (5) ""Disapproved,"" 
if the DOT disapproved the filing in its entirety; (6) ""DisapprovedX,"" if the DOT disapproved the filing, except as noted on 
individual fare, arbitrary, or text information); (7) ""Suspended,"" if the DOT suspended the filing in its entirety. Schwartz Decl. ¶ 
23."
198,14," But see Reply at 21 (citing Avent Depo. Ex. F (dkt. 917-7) at 16, 116-18, 124) (challenging Avent declaration stating that he 
was unable to find any DOT action to suspend or reject airfares because Avent admitted in his deposition that he did not review 
either the AIR or ATPCO database and that he actually is aware of DOT actions on airfares and surcharges based on IATA 
proceedings). "
199,15," Defendants's argument that the 2004 announcement ""did nothing to change the filing requirements,"" Reply at 10, does not ring 
true."
199,16, Japan Airlines has settled with Plaintiffs. See Mot. for Settlement (dkt. 900).
199,17," Plaintiffs also alleged that ANA coordinated with Japan Airlines to set the price of a third discount fare, Yobiyose fares, which 
were Asia-originating fares sold in the United States. FAC (dkt. 493) ¶¶ 114-23. The Court granted ANA's motion to dismiss 
Plaintiffs' claims based on the Yobiyose fares. Order Re Mot. to Dismiss at 39-40."
199,18," ANA notes that the Complaint also referred to a published fare called ""Business Value"" or ""Biz-Value,"" which ANA advertised 
and sold in 2006. ANA Mot. at 6. Despite its name, Business Value tickets were not discounted, and ANA contends that they 
were filed with DOT. Id. "
200,19," The filed rate doctrine [**40]  is also sometimes referenced as the ""filed tariff doctrine,"" see, e.g., Davel Commc'ns, Inc. v. 
Qwest Corp., 460 F.3d 1075, 1084 (9th Cir. 2006), or the ""Keogh doctrine,"" see, e.g., Cost Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Wash. Natural 
Gas Co., 99 F.3d 937, 943 & n.7 (9th Cir. 1996), after the case where it was first established, Keogh, 260 U.S. 156, 43 S. Ct. 47, 
67 L. Ed. 183 (1922). Carlin v. DairyAmerica, Inc, 705 F.3d 856 (9th Cir. 2012). "
201,20," Some courts have recognized only two rationales for the filed rate doctrine: non-discrimination and justiciability. See, e.g., 
Verizon Del., Inc. v. Covad Commc'ns Co., 377 F.3d 1081, 1086 (9th Cir. 2004); Fax Telecommunicaciones, Inc. v. AT&T, 138 
F.3d 479, 489 (2d Cir. 1998). In those cases, Courts typically define the nonjusticiability strand broadly to include the preemption 
issues that are central to the third strand here."
201,21," The Ninth Circuit has held ""that the principle of nondiscrimination still suggests the filed rate doctrine should [**42]  be applied 
in class actions. . . ."" Id. at 882. "
202,22," Plaintiffs rely excessively on the DOT's rulemaking statements for the proposition that Congress intended to remove the DOT's 
jurisdiction over international air fares. See, e.g., Opp'n at 9. The statements are not determinative of congressional intent. See 
Ting, 319 F.3d at 1136 (noting that Congress's purpose is the ""ultimate touchstone"" in a preemption analysis); see also Cain v. 
Air Cargo, Inc., 599 F.2d 316, 320 (9th Cir. 1979) (holding that HN6[
] courts must examine congressional intent in enacting a 
regulatory regime in a specific industry to determine applicability of the filed rate doctrine)."
202,23," No one knows this more than [**45]  ANA, who pled guilty to criminal charges of price-fixing during the class period, but 
asserts the filed rate doctrine as a defense in this civil case. See Opp'n at 58 (citing RJN Ex. 2 (ANA Plea) (dkt. 870-2) ¶ 4)."
202,24," To be clear, the Court does not hold that Congress needs to have made an explicit statement as to the filed rate doctrine, only 
that the Court does not accept Plaintiffs' suggestion that Congress did so. See, e.g., Opp'n at 8-13."
202,25," Because of this distinction between antitrust immunity and the filed rate doctrine, the Court will not follow In re Ocean 
Shipping Antitrust Litigation, 500 F. Supp. 1235, 1240 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), which predates all of the relevant case law in this 
Circuit, and which found that courts could not use the filed rate doctrine to grant ""implied"" antitrust immunity to commercial 
carriers when Congress had already designated an ""express"" path to antitrust immunity for those same carriers in the same law. 
It is not correct to characterize the filed rate doctrine as a ""repeal of the antitrust laws."" See id. at 1241. "
203,26," But see id. (adding that ""the Department is authorized pursuant to 49 U.S.C. § 41509 to cancel a rule that is 
unreasonable [**51]  after notice and hearing,"" and that it declined to exercise that authority because there was no ""specific 
evidence that [the challenged rates were] unreasonable.""). "
204,27," Grays Harbor is one of a number of cases that arise out of the California Energy Crisis of 2000-2001, when shortages of 
power and high electricity prices caused blackouts and general turmoil in the West Coast [**56]  electricity markets. See, e.g., E. 
& J. Gallo Winery, 503 F.3d 1027; Wah Chang, 507 F.3d 1222; Snohomish Cnty., 384 F.3d 756; California ex rel. Lockyer v. 
Dynegy, Inc., 375 F.3d 831 (9th Cir. 2004). Plaintiffs generally alleged that defendant energy producers manipulated the market 
and restricted electricity supplies in order to cause artificially high prices in the market. "
205,28," See also Snohomish, 384 F.3d at 760-61 (describing extensive actions FERC took to ""continue[] to oversee wholesale 
electricity rates"")."
205,29," The court specifically held that ""The STB's regulation of rates in noncontiguous domestic trade parallels FERC's regulation of 
natural gas rates in Gallo."" Id. "
206,30," Plaintiffs in that case had also argued that meaningful agency review was required for the doctrine to apply—an argument the 
memorandum disposition rightly rejected out of hand. See id. at 688."
206,31," Defendants challenge this testimony, arguing that Avent contradicted himself at his deposition by admitting that he is aware of 
a customer who sought to challenge a fuel surcharge through the complaint process. See Reply at 21. Defendants fail to point to 
any contradiction as to air fares."
206,32, The Court notes that Defendants challenge this testimony. See Reply at 21.
206,33," Nor is it the law that because foreign regulators approved some of the unfiled rates, the filed rate doctrine should apply. See 
Joint Memo. at 16-17. Defendants cite no authority so holding, and their argument that this Court should be the first forgets that 
the filed rate doctrine is grounded in principles of federal preemption and deference to agency decision making. See E. & J. 
Gallo Winery, 503 F.3d at 1033. The reasons that a court would defer to a federal [**62]  agency's decision on how best to carry 
out its regulatory mission do not apply to foreign regulators. This Court has no reason to assume that foreign regulators care 
about curbing anticompetitive conduct or have the authority to do so. "
207,34," Plaintiffs [**64]  also point to a good deal of evidence that Defendants did not effectively file many of their fuel surcharges at 
issue. See Opp'n at 35-36."
207,35," Providing some further support for this interpretation of the DOT's intentions is the DOT's failure to approve the carriers' 2003 
request for immunity for collusive fuel surcharge rate setting. See RJN Ex. 9 (Application for Approval of Agreements by the Int'l 
Air Transport Assoc., Aug. 25, 2003) (dkt. 870-9); Opp'n at 16."
207,36," As an initial matter, Plaintiffs argue that ANA cannot even invoke the filed rate doctrine because: (1) it is judicially [**65]  
estopped, based on its criminal trial; (2) it waived its right to assert this defense; and (3) the Department of Justice has 
disapproved of ABA's conduct. Opp'n at 56-60. HN12[
] Judicial estoppel generally prevents a party from prevailing in one 
phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase. Milton H. Greene 
Archives, Inc. v. Marilyn Monroe, LLC, 692 F.3d 983, 993 (9th Cir. 2012). ANA pleaded guilty to price-fixing ""unpublished"" 
passenger fares, including the Satogaeri and Biz-wari fares at issue in this case. Opp'n at 57. Plaintiffs note that the D.C. District 
Court stayed an award of damages against ANA ""in light of [the] pending civil action."" Id.; but see ANA Reply (dkt. 914) at 5 
(ANA paid a $73 million fine). But ANA is not taking inconsistent positions—it argues here that the doctrine applies to bar 
recovery as to its fares, not that its fares were not the result of price-fixing. Moreover, the filed rate doctrine applies regardless of 
the culpability of a defendant's conduct or the possibility of inequitable results. Carlin, 705 F.3d at 869. Plaintiffs next argue that 
ANA waived the filed rate defense by pleading guilty, and knowingly and voluntarily acknowledging that this litigation was the 
appropriate vehicle for resolving the amount [**66]  of ANA's financial exposure. Opp'n at 58. The Court does not find waiver 
here. Nor is the Court persuaded that the DOJ is interchangeable with the DOT. ANA is not barred from invoking the doctrine. "
208,37," Plaintiffs would contend that that is nearly what happened here. See Opp'n at 55 (citing Fukuda Depo. at 71-77, 83-84; 
Schwartz Decl. ¶¶ 29-39). "
209,38," The Court further rejects Plaintiffs' assertion that the Court cannot grant summary judgment on some rates while leaving 
others intact. See Opp'n at 52. E. & J. Gallo Winery does not support Plaintiffs' assertion. In the case at hand, Plaintiffs' claims 
are not based on an index or any other compilation of air fares. The Court does not now reach the issue of Defendants' joint and 
several liability or whether Plaintiffs have proven a conspiracy. See id. at 52-53. "
210,1," Because many of the involved individuals share a common surname, the court will refer to them by their first names to prevent 
any confusion. The court means no disrespect. "
213,2," For a similar reason, the two cases relied upon by American General - Adler v. Manor Healthcare Corp., 7 Cal. App. 4th 1110, 
9 Cal. Rptr. 2d 732 (1992), and Vournas v. Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, 73 Cal. App. 4th 668, 86 Cal. Rptr. 2d 490 
(1999) - do not advance American General's argument for application of § 18100 right now. Both Adler and Vournas involved 
grants of summary judgment where allegations of defendants' actual knowledge were either absent or unproven. Here, Plaintiffs 
have asserted sufficient facts to support the theory that American General had actual knowledge of certain information which, if 
true, would negate the application of § 18100. The evidence may ultimately show something different once discovery is 
completed, but that analysis should be made at a later time [*11]  upon a different type of motion. "
214,3," American General also correctly contends that Plaintiffs may not obtain nonrestitutionary disgorgement through their UCL 
claim. See [*14]  Korea Supply Co. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 29 Cal. 4th 1134, 1151-52, 131 Cal. Rptr. 2d 29, 63 P.3d 937 
(2003). The court is not persuaded, however, that this limitation on damages is a sufficient reason to dismiss the claim 
altogether. "
216,1," Throughout his complaint, Radoff refers to Elavon's actions with respect to ""Plaintiffs."" Because no class has yet been certified 
and Radoff is the only named Plaintiff, the Court discusses the claims pled on behalf of the putative class in the singular. 
Nevertheless, any argument made with respect to Radoff applies equally to the putative class members. "
221,2," In light of the Court's dismissal of all claims, the Court need not address Elavon's alternative motion to strike class allegations. "
224,1," Unless otherwise stated, the following facts are from Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint and assumed to be true for purposes 
of this motion. See Dkt. No. 15."
224,2," Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 23, is granted. See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b); Marder v. Lopez, 450 F.3d 445, 448 
(9th Cir. 2006)."
224,3, Bank of America is the successor by merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing. FAC ¶ 7.

440,1," Some contracts cover multiple brands, such as Honda [*241]  and Acura, which may account for some of this gap. See Compl. 
¶ 513. "
443,2, [*252] Defendant also explains that [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] 
444,3," Tampa Electric Co. was a Clayton Act § 3 case, but the same rule of reason analysis governs exclusive dealing claims under 
both statutes. Cf. CDC Techs., 186 F.3d at 79 (""The conclusion that a contract does not violate § 3 of the Clayton Act ordinarily 
implies the conclusion that the contract does not violate the Sherman Act.""). "
445,4," It may well be that some portion of the used cars not currently sold with VHRs should be included in the relevant market, but 
that is a matter for factual dispute, not one that defeats Plaintiffs' allegations at the pleading stage. "
446,5," Specifically, the Complaint explains that inventory for dealerships turns over every 45-60 days, and thus reasons that the 
number of used car listings annually must be between six and nine times the monthly figure. With an average of 1,873,920 
monthly listings for franchised dealers, the Plaintiffs estimate that there are 11,243,520 listings annually by franchised dealers. 
This number is 75% [*261]  of the 14,989,431 used vehicles sold by franchised dealers. Compl. ¶ 523."
446,6," [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. See Ortmeier Decl. Ex. A (Dkt. No. 46-1). The contract being terminable on relatively 
short notice means this portion of the market may not be foreclosed, and to remove [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] from 
the foreclosure analysis would seem to detract significantly from the share of the overall market that is foreclosed. However, it is 
unclear the extent to which Cars.com listings overlap with Autotrader listings, and if most vehicles are listed on both, [TEXT 
REDACTED BY THE COURT], because it still forces most customers to buy one of Defendant's VHRs and leaves them with 
little incentive to buy from competitors. Moreover, [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT]. See Ortmeier Decl. Ex. S (Dkt. No. 46-
19). To the extent allegations based on [TEXT REDACTED BY THE COURT] still fall within the statute of limitations, they can 
support a Sherman Act claim. "
447,7," Defendant also tries to call into question the accuracy of the 90% figure provided by its own employee. It does so in several 
ways: first, by stating that the figure was limited to individuals who actually bought VHRs rather than all used car purchasers, 
and second, by claiming (based on evidence outside the Complaint) that it only relates to online sales. The former argument 
depends on redefining the VHR market to include all used car sales, which has already been rejected. The latter does not suffice 
to make Plaintiffs' argument facially implausible, particularly in light of [*265]  Defendant's own reliance on the 90% figure. "
451,1," ETSI is a standard development organization (""SDO"") responsible for the standardization of information and communications 
technologies. (Id. ¶ 40.) "
454,2," The SAC makes it clear that TCL does not make any such admission. (See, e.g., SAC ¶ 13 (""TCL does not accept Ericsson's 
representation that any (or all) of its patents that it has identified as 'essential' are, in fact, necessary for the compliant 
implementations of 2G, 3G, and 4G technologies . . ."").)"
454,3," This position is very similar to the Lear doctrine, under which a patent licensee is not estopped, by virtue of the license, from 
challenging the validity of the patent. Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 670-71, 89 S. Ct. 1902, 23 L. Ed. 2d 610 (1969). 
Furthermore, the Court notes that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure explicitly allow for pleading in the alternative. See Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 8(d). The Court finds that the SAC sufficiently sets forth TCL's alternative theories for relief in compliance with Rule 8(d)."
454,4," In light of this judicial admission, the Court is not convinced that the letter received by Ericsson's counsel from TCL's counsel 
on August 29, 2014 (Gibson Reply Decl. Ex. 2) warrants dismissal of TCL's FRAND claims. "
456,5," In support of its motion to dismiss, Ericsson emphasizes that it has negotiated FRAND licenses with 90 other industry 
participants, which suggests that it did not fraudulently induce ETSI to incorporate its technology into its standards. (See MTD 9; 
Reply MTD 7.) While this may be relevant evidence to the ultimate determination of whether Ericsson intended to license its 
patents at FRAND rates when it made its declarations to ETSI, at this stage in the litigation, ""[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and 
other conditions of a person's mind may be alleged generally."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Consequently, the Court finds the SAC's 
general allegation of Ericsson's intent to deceive is sufficient at this stage. At the September 22, 2014 hearing, Ericsson's 
counsel argued that Ericsson's business dealings with other industry participants renders TCL's fraud claims implausible under 
Iqbal and Twombly. The Court disagrees. The fact that Ericsson may have issued many licenses to other companies does not 
foreclose the possibility that Ericsson fraudulently induced ETSI to adopt its technology into the standards with the intention of 
exploiting this market power to the detriment of just a few industry participants, such as TCL."
456,6," Ericsson also argues that the claim fails because TCL has not alleged its consent to be bound by any such FRAND rate 
adjudication. However, as discussed above, the Court is convinced that TCL has in fact demonstrated such consent."
456,7," Unlike the plaintiff in Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73827, at *20 (W.D. Wash. June 1, 2011), TCL 
has made no concession that the relief it is seeking in its declaratory judgment claim is the same as the relief that it is seeking on 
its other claims. "
457,8," Consequently, the Court need not address the parties arguments regarding whether Ericsson's bundled licensing of the 2G, 
3G, and 4G patents standing alone is anti-competitive or whether Ericsson's filing of infringement lawsuits against TCL in various 
jurisdiction is actionable under the UCL. "
458,9," The SAC alleges, ""[i]n its Complaint in Texas, Ericsson alleges that TCL infringes [the '556 or '506 patent]"" and that ""TCL 
alleges that it does not infringe one or more claims of the ['556 or '506] patent, either directly or contributorily, and has not 
induced others to infringe one or more claims of the ['556 or '506] patent."" (SAC ¶¶ 150-53, 158-62.) "
459,10," See Docket No. 11, at 5. "
461,11," Obviously, if discovery turns up evidence of willfulness, Ericsson would be hard-pressed to oppose an appropriate 
amendment. "
470,1," All ""¶"" citations are to the operative complaint. "
471,2," Plaintiff alleges that it was ""Southwest, using Litton letterhead,"" who sent this letter. For reasons more fully discussed infra at 
III-B, the Court does not consider this a well-pled allegation entitled to a presumption of truth."
471,3," Plaintiff does not, at least in this lawsuit, dispute that she was required under her deed of trust to purchase flood insurance and 
that her lenders were entitled to purchase it and charge her at least some amount for the cost of obtaining [*7]  flood insurance if 
she failed to do so. "
474,4," In fact, however, [*17]  the Court doubts that, even when the doctrine does apply, it is an issue of standing as opposed to the 
merits of the claim. The Court is aware that at least district court has characterized the filed-rate doctrine as an issue of standing. 
Morales v. Attorneys' Title Ins. Fund, Inc., 983 F. Supp. 1418, 1429 (S.D. Fla. 1997). ""[T]here is, however, persuasive case law 
which holds that the filed rate doctrine is not a subject matter jurisdiction issue, but is rather a defense on the merits."" Hoover v. 
HSBC Mortgage Corp. (USA),     F.Supp.2d    , No. 3:13-cv-149 MAD/DEP, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40743, 2014 WL 1280441, at 
*8 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2014) (citing Curtis v. Cenlar FSB, No. 13-cv-3007 DLC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161687, 2013 WL 
5995582, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 12, 2013). Defendants ""reason that because . . . [the plaintiff] loses on the merits, he has not 
suffered any 'cognizable injury that is traceable to the acts of the . . . defendants and he lacks standing to sue them.'"" Curtis, 
2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 161687, 2013 WL 5995582, *2. ""But this reasoning would allow any Rule 12(b)(6) motion to be restyled 
as a Rule 12(b)(1) standing motion."" Id. ""While standing and merits questions frequently overlap, standing is fundamentally 
about the propriety of the individual litigating a claim irrespective of its legal merits, while a Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry is concerned 
with the legal merits of the claim itself."" Id. (emphases in the original). ""Here, the defendants are not contending that . . . [the 
plaintiff] is the wrong individual to bring these [*18]  legal claims; they are arguing that the claims are simply not legally 
cognizable."" Id. ASIC has not directed the Court to any Ninth Circuit authority directly addressing this question. In 2007, the Ninth Circuit applied 
the doctrine in considering the appeal of a filed-rate doctrine dismissal which had been entered pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). Wah 
Chang v. Duke Energy Trading & Mktg., LLC, 507 F.3d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir. 2007). But more recently, the Ninth Circuit 
considered a filed-rate doctrine dismissal that had been entered under Rule 12(b)(6). Carlin v. DairyAmerica, Inc., 705 F.3d 856, 
866-67 (9th Cir. 2013) cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 116, 187 L. Ed. 2d 35 (U.S. 2013). Whether or not Plaintiff's claims fail because 
of the filed-rate doctrine, the Court sees nothing about her relationship to her asserted harm that deprives this Court of 
jurisdiction to address the question she presents for adjudication. Ultimately, the Court need not decide the question in this "
475,," motion because the Court concludes, even after considering all relevant evidence and assuming the burden is properly placed 
on Plaintiff, that the filed-rate doctrine does not bar Plaintiff's claims. "
478,5," In her opposition brief, Plaintiff also suggests Litton and Ocwen breached section 14 of the deed of trust, but the Court does not 
consider this argument since it is not in her complaint. "
513,1," Where convenient, the Court uses the nomenclature of the complaints to refer to subsets of the seventeen named defendants, 
who are: (1) LG Chem, Ltd., and (2) LG Chem America, Inc. (""LGCAI"") (collectively, ""LG Chem""); (3) Samsung SDI Co., Ltd., 
and (4) Samsung [*51]  SDI America, Inc. (collectively, ""Samsung""); (5) Panasonic Corp. and (6) Panasonic Corp. of North 
America (""PNA"") (collectively, ""Panasonic""); (7) Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. (""Sanyo Electric""), and (8) Sanyo North America Corp.

""Hitachi""); (14) GS Yuasa Corp. (""GS Yuasa""); (15) NEC Corp., and (16) NEC Tokin (collectively ""NEC""); and (17) Toshiba Corp."
513,2," Pursuant to the Court's phased approach, defendants filed their Phase 2 Motion in advance of the filing of the IPPs' SCAC. The 
parties then stipulated, and the Court ordered, that the Phase 2 Motion would apply to the IPPs' SCAC. (Dkt. No. 433.)"
513,3," ""Antitrust standing is distinct from Article III standing. A plaintiff who satisfies the constitutional requirement of injury in fact is 
not necessarily a proper party to bring a private [*53]  antitrust action."" Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tel. Co. of California, 190 
F.3d 1051, 1054 n.3 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing AGC, 459 U.S. at 535 n.31); see also Amarel v. Connell, 102 F.3d 1494, 1507 (9th 
Cir. 1996) (antitrust standing is a court-created doctrine designed to limit the number of persons affected by antitrust violations 
who may sue for their injuries). "
514,4," While the DPPs and IPPs both utilize the defined terms ""Lithium Ion Battery"" and ""Lithium Ion Battery Products,"" they define 
those terms differently. (Compare DPP-SCAC ¶¶ 2-4 with IPP-SCAC ¶¶ 1, 4.) Because the differences between the two sets of "
515,," definitions are immaterial for purposes of this Order, the Court, for convenience and concision, refers simply to cells, batteries, 
and battery products."
515,5," The Court found that, despite the DPPs' moniker, they are, for Illinois Brick purposes, indirect purchasers because they 
purchased batteries and battery products as opposed to the allegedly price-fixed cells themselves, and thus paid the alleged 
overcharge only as a pass-on. Jan. 21 Order at 9-10. "
516,6," The IPPs' fourth cause of action asserts 21 claims under the antitrust and restraint of trade laws of: (1) Arizona; (2) California; 
(3) the District of Columbia; (4) Illinois; (5) Kansas; (6) Maine; (7) Michigan; (8) Minnesota; (9) Mississippi; (10) Nebraska; (11) 
Nevada; (12) New Hampshire; (13) New Mexico; (14) New York; (15) North Carolina; (16) North Dakota; (17) Oregon; (18) 
Tennessee; [*61]  (19) Vermont; (20) West Virginia; and (21) Wisconsin. (IPP-SCAC ¶¶ 529-49.) For convenience, the Court 
refers here to the District of Columbia as a ""state."""
516,7," The IPPs' fifth cause of action asserts 12 claims under the consumer-protection and unfaircompetition laws of: (1) Arkansas; (2) 
California; (3) Florida; (4) Massachusetts; (5) Missouri; (6) Montana; (7) Nebraska; (8) New Hampshire; (9) New York; (10) 
South Carolina; (11) Utah; and (12) Vermont. (IPP-SCAC ¶¶ 553-64.) The IPPs assert claims under California, Nebraska, New 
Hampshire, New York, and Vermont law in both their fourth and fifth causes of action. With this overlap, the IPPs' fourth and fifth 
causes of actions assert a total of 33 claims under the laws of 28 jurisdictions—27 states and the District of Columbia."
516,8," Defendants initially moved on the same basis to dismiss the IPPs' claims under Montana's Unfair Trade Practices and 
Consumer Protection Act, insofar as the IPPs sought relief under Part 2 of that statute. (Phase 2 Motion at 21-22; see also 
Phase 2 Reply at 15.) The IPPs have since clarified that they seek relief only under Part 1 of the statute, and the parties concur 
that defendants' Motion as to Part 2 is moot. (See May 9 Tr. at 70:18-20.) That portion of the Motion is therefore DENIED AS 
MOOT. "
517,9," ""While the Supreme Court has expressed reluctance in carving out exceptions to the Illinois Brick rule, limited exceptions do 
exist."" In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litig., 686 F.3d 741, 749 (9th Cir. 2012) cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 257, 187 L. Ed. 2d 260 (U.S. 
2013) (compiling and explaining the exceptions recognized by the Ninth Circuit). The Court applies one such exception in Part 3, 
Section 1, infra."
517,10," The parties extensively cite orders issued in those cases that analyzed, in the context of Rule 12 motions, the same issues 
raised here. The Court lists them in order of decision: In re Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litig., 516 F. 
Supp. 2d 1072 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (""DRAM I""); In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1011 (N.D. Cal.

520,11," Some of these characterizations are inapt. As set forth in more detail herein, of the two New Mexico cases cited, one is from 
the state high court and the other from the intermediate appellate court. Romero v. Philip Morris Inc., 2010 - NMSC 035, 148 
N.M. 713, 724, 242 P.3d 280 (N.M. 2010); Nass-Romero v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 2012- NMCA 058, 279 P.3d 772, 778-81 (N.M. Ct. 
App. 2012). The decision squarely addressing antitrust standing is from the latter, yet defendants count New Mexico among their 
high-court authorities. Similarly, the cited New York decisions are a reasoned but unpublished [*75]  trial court opinion endorsing 
application of AGC principles and a three-paragraph, unpublished intermediate appellate disposition that does not mention AGC. 
Ho v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 3 Misc. 3d 1105[A], 787 N.Y.S.2d 677, 2004 NY Slip Op 50415[U], at *5 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2004) 
(unreported), aff'd, 16 A.D.3d 256, 793 N.Y.S.2d 8 (N.Y. App. Div. 2005). Defendants count these among their intermediate 
appellate authorities. "
522,12," The Court does not include [*84]  the District of Columbia among these jurisdictions, notwithstanding the Peterson opinion 
previously noted, because that jurisdiction's courts have only thrice had occasion to interpret its harmonization statute and, in 
three trial-court but no appellate opinions, have come to conclusions that are not obviously reconciled. Compare Peterson, 2005 
D.C. Super. LEXIS 17, 2005 WL 1403761, at *4 (following federal precedents in view of statutory language similar to Clayton Act 
and weak harmonization statute) with Holder v. Archer Daniels Midland Co., 96-2975, 1998 D.C. Super. LEXIS 39, 1998 WL "
523,1469620," (D.C. Super. Nov. 4, 1998) (""a broad application of the District of Columbia's antitrust statute seems particularly 
important to effectuate the purpose of the statute""); see also Goda v. Abbott Labs., CIV. A. 01445-96, 1997 D.C. Super. LEXIS 
69, 1997 WL 156541 (D.C. Super. Feb. 3, 1997) (certifying class of indirect purchasers over an Illinois Brick objection)."
523,13," The Court is aware that authority on the ""complex issue"" of whether and how AGC applies in the context of state antitrust 
statutes is, at best, ""splintered."" Compressors, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 50737, 2013 WL 1431756, at *8 (quoting Kellen S. Dwyer, 
With the Illinois Brick Wall Down, What's Left?: Determining Antitrust Standing Under State Law, 3 J. BUS. ENTREPRENEURSHIP & 
L. 255 (2010)). Given the difficulties inherent in this area of the law, the Court clarifies [*86]  that, while the sufficiency of the 
IPPs' bare pleading of antitrust standing under AGC minimizes the Erie issue here, the Court has not heeded the IPPs' call for a 
""clear directive"" from a state's legislature or highest court before applying AGC to that state's antitrust laws. (Phase 2 Opp'n at 2-
3.) The Court is cognizant that several judges have adverted to the need for such a ""clear directive."" E.g., TFT-LCD I, 586 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1123; GPU II, 540 F. Supp. 2d at 1097; ODD I, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 101763, 2011 WL 3894376, at *12. And the 
Court is sensitive to concerns about federal district judges declaring ""in ipse dixit style"" what state law is. GPU I, 527 F. Supp. 2d 
at 1026. However, it is well settled that ""[a] state is not without law save as its highest court has declared it."" W. v. Am. Tel. & 
Tel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236, 61 S. Ct. 179, 85 L. Ed. 139 (1940). There is a balance to be struck between, on the one hand, 
fabricating state law from whole cloth and, on the other, imposing an artificial uncertainty until a state's high court happens to 
speak clearly on an issue. The Court's duty is to chart a middle course, ascertaining state law by applying the interpretive 
guidelines set forth by superior federal courts to state-court authority marshalled by able counsel. "
524,14," The Court is cognizant that when courts confer antitrust standing on market non-participants on the basis of an injury suffered 
in an ""inextricably intertwined"" market, they are applying a ""narrow exception"" to the usual rule of market participation. Dang v. 
San Francisco Forty Niners, 964 F. Supp. 2d 1097, 1111 (N.D. Cal. 2013); Lorenzo v. Qualcomm Inc., 603 F. Supp. 2d 1291, 
1300 (S.D. Cal. 2009) (citing Am. Ad. Mgmt., 190 F.3d at 1057 n.5); see also DRAM II, 536 F. Supp. 2d at 1139-41 (examining 
""inextricably interlinked"" exception in the [*90]  context of a computer components case). ""This exception applies when the 
claimant can be considered the 'direct victim' of a conspiracy or the 'necessary means' by which the conspiracy was carried out."" 
Lorenzo, 603 F. Supp. 2d at 1300-01 (quoting Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., Inc., 740 F.2d 739, 744-47 (9th Cir. 1984)). Simply 
invoking the phrases ""inextricably linked"" or ""inextricably intertwined,"" without facts supporting that conclusion, will not suffice. 
See id. at 1301 (quoting Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., 171 F.3d 912, 926 n.8 (3d Cir. 
1999)). However, it is possible to plead inextricably intertwined markets. Dang, 964 F. Supp. 2d at 1112-13 (deeming sufficient 
plaintiff's allegation that ""the retail market for apparel bearing NFL-related intellectual property"" was inextricably intertwined ""with 
the market for the licensing of that intellectual property""). "
526,15," The Court notes that, while DRAM II was on appeal, the parties settled prior to argument before the Ninth Circuit. "
528,16," The Court finds that the risk of duplicative recovery, to the extent it should be considered separately, weighs in favor of 
antitrust standing, notwithstanding the presence of the DPP class. As the DRAM I court explained: Illinois Brick repealer states 
""have necessarily made the policy decision [*103]  that duplicative recovery may permissibly occur. Duplicative recovery is, in 
many if not all cases alleging a nationwide conspiracy with both direct and indirect purchaser classes, a necessary consequence 
that flows from indirect purchaser recovery. Accordingly, it is no bar against standing, and this factor does not weigh against 
standing."" 516 F. Supp. 2d at 1093; see also Flash, 643 F. Supp. 2d at 1155-56 (same, and collecting cases); In re Auto. Parts 
Antitrust Litig., 12-MD-02311, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 80338, 2013 WL 2456612, at *8 (E.D. Mich. June 6, 2013). The Court 
perceives no other indirect purchasers standing ready to sue under state law, nor have defendants identified any."
528,17," Defendants originally challenged the IPPs' proposed Utah Damages Class but concede in their reply brief that the IPP-SCAC 
cures the deficiency asserted earlier. (Phase 2 Reply at 11 n.14.) "
529,18," For instance, if the Court eventually were to certify one of the IPPs' proposed classes of non-California governmental plaintiffs, 
it would be responsible for safeguarding the interests of absent class members. Given that such class members would, in this 
proposed class, consist of political subdivisions of states, with their own obligations to their own citizens, their own specific 
relationships to their states (and any parens patriae actions their states may bring), their own organizing charters (or lack 
thereof), and additional complexities that may yet disclose themselves, the Court lacks information regarding how the Court 
could discharge its duties to the purported governmental class members. "
530,," The Court makes no comment on the parties' choice-of-law arguments regarding the proposed [*110]  governmental classes. 
Those matters are best addressed on a fuller record, development of which the Court anticipates in connection with any motion 
challenging the IPPs' purported nationwide damages class proceeding under California law. "
531,19," The IPPs assert claims under the Illinois Antitrust Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. §§ 10/1, et seq., and South Carolina's Unfair Trade 
Practices Act, S.C. Code Ann. §§ 39-5-10, et seq. (IPP-SCAC ¶¶ 532 (Illinois), 562 (South Carolina).) The Illinois Antitrust Act 
provides, in pertinent part: HN21[
] No provision of this Act shall deny any person who is an indirect purchaser the right to sue for damages. 
Provided, however, that in any case in which claims are asserted against a defendant by both direct and indirect 
purchasers, the court shall take all steps necessary to avoid duplicate liability for the same injury including transfer and 
consolidation of all actions. Provided further that no person shall be authorized to maintain a class action in any court of this 
State for indirect purchasers asserting claims under this Act, with the sole exception of this State's Attorney General, who 
may maintain an action [*116]  parens patriae as provided in this subsection."
531,740," Ill. Comp. Stat. § 10/7(2) (emphasis supplied). South Carolina's Unfair Trade Practices Act provides, in pertinent part: HN22[
] Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or 
employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act or practice declared unlawful by § 39-5-20 may bring 
an action individually, but not in a representative capacity, to recover actual damages. S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-140(a) (emphasis supplied). "
532,20," The Court concurs with Judge Moskowitz's reasoning in In re Hydroxycut Mktg. & Sales Practices Litig., 299 F.R.D. 648, 2014 
WL 295302, at *2-4 (S.D. Cal. 2014) (""Hydroxycut II""), and shares his conclusion that Justice Stevens's concurrence in the 
Supreme Court's fractured decision in Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393, 130 S. Ct. 
1431, 176 L. Ed. 2d 311 (2010), is not the controlling opinion of that case because it cannot be meaningfully regarded as both 
narrower than another and a common denominator of the Court's reasoning. Lair v. Bullock, 697 F.3d 1200, 1205 (9th Cir. 
2012). ""Because the Ninth Circuit has not yet voiced an opinion on how to apply Shady Grove, the Court looks to pre-Shady 
Grove Ninth Circuit cases analyzing whether the application of federal rules in certain situations would violate the Rules Enabling 
Act."" Hydroxycut II, 299 F.R.D. 648, 2014 WL 295302, at *3. The parties and the Court concur that Freund articulates the proper 
test under pre-Shady Grove Ninth Circuit law. "
534,21," The Court is cognizant that other rulings, including some from this District, have reached the opposite conclusion. E.g., SRAM, 
2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131002, 2010 WL 5094289, at *8; TFT-LCD I, 586 F. Supp. 2d at 1125; GPU I, 527 F. Supp. 2d at 1029-
30. The Court [*126]  declines to follow those cases because they limited their examination of ADTPA's notion of 
unconscionability to that expressed in Bryant, which, as the Court has explained, is too narrow. "
535,22," Defendants' opening brief also argues that the DPPs lack standing under the coconspirator exception recognized by Ninth 
Circuit law. ATM Fee, 686 F.3d at 749; Del. Valley, 523 F.3d at 1123 n.1; State of Ariz. v. Shamrock Foods Co., 729 F.2d 1208, "
536,1211," -14 (9th Cir. 1984). The DPPs, however, disclaim reliance on that exception (see Phase 3 Opp'n (no mention of co-
conspirator exception)), as defendants acknowledge (Phase 3 Reply at 2). The Court therefore need not address that exception."
536,23," Plaintiff First Choice Marketing, Inc. (""First Choice"") allegedly purchased ""Sony high-definition camcorders,"" but the DPP-
SCAC does not specify that those camcorders contained defendant-branded lithium ion batteries. (DPP-SCAC ¶ 22.) Similarly, 
plaintiff The Stereo Shop allegedly purchased a Sony camcorder but the camcorder's battery is not identified. (DPP-SCAC ¶ 25.) 
These omissions are notable in light of the DPP-SCAC 's careful specificity with respect to the batteries contained in other 
battery products. (E.g., DPP-SCAC ¶¶ 21, 23.) In light of the other allegations [*133]  in the DPP-SCAC, however, they are not 
ultimately fatal for purposes of pleading the DPPs' antitrust standing. It is eminently plausible that those devices carried Sony 
batteries, and the contrary inference is impermissible at the pleading stage."
536,24," The DPP-SCAC identifies other relationships between corporate entities beside complete ownership. (See DPP-SCAC ¶ 21 
(Circuit City allegedly purchased Samsung battery products containing Samsung batteries from non-defendant ""Samsung 
Electronics America, Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Ltd., which in turn is the single largest 
shareholder of Defendant Samsung SDI Co., Ltd."" (emphasis supplied)); DPP-SCAC ¶ 24 (Ritz Camera allegedly purchased 
Panasonic battery products containing Panasonic batteries from non-defendants ""Panasonic Company and Panasonic Company 
East,"" both of which allegedly are ""regional sales companies of [non-defendant] Panasonic Consumer Electronics [*135]  
Company, which is a division of Defendant Panasonic Corporation of North America, which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Defendant Panasonic Corporation"").) These allegations satisfy Royal Printing for purposes of pleading. ATM Fee, 686 F.3d at 
749 (""an indirect purchaser may sue if the direct purchaser is a division or subsidiary of the price-fixing seller""); Sun 
Microsystems Inc. v. Hynix Semiconductor Inc., 608 F. Supp. 2d 1166, 1180 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (minority stock ownership may 
support inference of control)). "
537,25," The SCAC adds new allegations concerning international marking standards for lithium ion batteries. These standards 
allegedly require each cell ""to be marked with the manufacturer's name, trade name, or trademark and model designation."" (¶ 
101.) The DPPs also allege that lithium ion batteries and battery cells bear barcodes or other markings that identify the cell 
manufacturer and may be used, in at least some instances, to identify the manufacturer of the battery cell ""and other 
components of the pack."" (¶ 102.) The DPPs allege that these markings and barcodes allow a cell to be traced through the chain 
of manufacture, including through the packing phase. (Id.) Be that as it may, the DPPs do not allege that they have used the 
barcodes to trace their particular purchases, which undercuts [*136]  the probative value of the allegations somewhat. "
538,26," The DPPs argue that ""[c]ommon ownership of a conspirator and direct purchaser satisfies Royal Printing,"" and cite for support 
two rulings in tagalong actions in the TFT-LCD case. (Phase 2 Opp'n at 9-10 (citing In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., M 
07-1827 SI, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38111, 2010 WL 1264230, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 28, 2010); In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) 
Antitrust Litig., M 07-1827 SI, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133852, 2011 WL 5357906, at *1-2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2011)).) In the first of 
those rulings, the Court relied on allegations that the common owner would not authorize suit of the conspiring subsidiary by the 
direct-purchaser subsidiary. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38111, 2010 WL 1264230, at *1 (""Plaintiffs have alleged, and the record 
contains evidence in support, that [direct-purchaser] Tatung America . . . is unlikely to sue [parent company and alleged 
conspirator] Tatung Taiwan for Sherman Act violations.""). The DPP-SCAC does not so allege. Further, this ruling issued before 
ATM Fee clarified that the absence of a realistic possibility of suit is not, by itself, sufficient to support antitrust standing under 
the ownership-and-control exception; rather, ""whether a realistic possibility of suit exists[] depends on the existence of ownership 
or control between the direct purchaser [*142]  and the seller."" 686 F.3d at 756. In the second ruling, the Court relied on 
evidence that the common owner ""participated in the conspiracy."" 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 133852, 2011 WL 5357906, at *2. The 
DPP-SCAC does not allege that common owner Hitachi Ltd. participated in the alleged conspiracy. "
540,27," Defendants point to the DPP-SCAC's allegations of the existence of other third parties who purchased [*150]  directly from the 
conspiracy, that is, the independent packers located in Taiwan. Taking those allegations as true, the existence of another party 
with a more direct injury than the present plaintiffs does not conclusively establish that the present plaintiffs lack a sufficiently 
direct injury. Am. Ad Mgmt., 190 F.3d at 1055 (courts must balance the AGC factors, no single factor of which is decisive). 
Moreover, though the Taiwanese packers are an ""identifiable class of persons,"" AGC, 459 U.S. at 542, nothing in the DPP-
SCAC supports an inference that their ""self-interest would normally motivate them to vindicate the public interest in antitrust 
enforcement,"" id. On the contrary, the DPP-SCAC alleges that the Taiwanese packers are beholden to defendants for their 
supply of raw cells to pack and are unlikely to sue. (DPP-SCAC ¶ 97.) While that is no reason to confer antitrust standing under 
Illinois Brick's ownership or control exception, see ATM Fee, 686 F.3d at 756, 756 n.8, no authority has been presented to the 
Court suggesting that it is forbidden to account for the lack of a realistic possibility of suit by any identifiable class of more direct 
purchasers under the analytically distinct inquiry mandated by AGC. "
541,28," Having determined that the DPPs have standing to [*151]  sue for damages under federal antitrust law, the Court declines to 
reach defendants' attack on the DPPs' request for injunctive relief, which defendants frame as a request to dismiss the DPP-
SCAC with prejudice. (Phase 3 Motion at 17-18; Phase 3 Reply at 14.)"
541,29," The defendants who filed individual motions are listed here, along with the docket numbers of the corresponding motion, 
opposition, and reply briefs: (1) MCA and HML (Dkt. Nos. 427, 454, 463); (2) LGCAI (Dkt. Nos. 425, 453, 461); (3) NEC Corp. 
(Dkt. Nos. 426, 455, 466); (4) PNA and SNA (Dkt. Nos. 429, 456, 467); (5) GS Yuasa (Dkt. Nos. 424, 452, 462); (6) SEL and 
SEND (Dkt. Nos. 431, 457, 468); and (7) Toshiba Corp. (Dkt. Nos. 430, 458, 464). The Court addresses the individual motions in 
that order. "
545,30," In so ruling, the Court is cognizant that [*167]  plaintiffs state they received access to NEC Corp. and NEC Tokin's grand jury 
productions only after they filed their current complaints and a few days before filing their opposition to NEC Corp.'s motion, and 
that many of the documents are in Japanese and thus require translation. (Dkt. No. 455 at 6.) "
546,31," Plaintiffs allege that Sanyo Electric is the parent of SNA, that Panasonic Corp. is the parent of PNA, and that Sanyo Electric 
became a wholly owned subsidiary of Panasonic Corp. (though they allege markedly different dates on which this occurred). 
(DPP-SCAC ¶ 41 (""on April 1, 2011""); IPP-SCAC ¶ 455 (""[a]s of December 9, 2009"").)"
546,32," A June 4, 2007 email shows SNA receiving pricing information from an employee of Sanyo GS Soft Energy reporting after 
requesting and receiving information from ""Maxell."" (DPP-SCAC ¶ 221; see also id. ¶ 237.) Takanao Matsumoto of Sanyo 
Energy relayed this information (including production [*170]  capacity, packing process, price negotiations with customers, 
shipping routes and future purchasing plans) to Sanyo. (See DPP-SCAC ¶¶ 221-222; IPP-SCAC ¶ 232.)"
546,33," The IPP-SCAC alleges this fact via a footnote that links to a website containing GS Yuasa's date of incorporation. Plaintiffs 
concede that the fact is part of the IPP-SCAC. (See Dkt. No. 452 at 3.) "
547,34," Atchison is a CERCLA case that overruled a prior Ninth Circuit decision, Louisiana-Pacific Corp. v. Asarco, Inc., 909 F.2d 
1260 (9th Cir. 1990) [*174] . Louisiana-Pacific held that, in CERCLA actions, due to a perceived need for uniformity, federal 
courts were to analyze questions of successor liability under CERCLA-specific federal common law rather than state laws of 
general application. The test that plaintiffs cite is the federal common law test which, technically, Atchison disapproved. See 
Atchison, 159 F.3d at 361 (citing Louisiana-Pac., 909 F.2d at 1263). The holding of Atchison is that state law, not federal 
common law, governs successor liability in CERCLA actions, as state law generally supplies decisional rules unless use of state 
law would substantially conflict with a specific and concrete federal policy or interest in an area where uniformity is needed. See 
id. at 362-64; see also United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 728-29, 99 S. Ct. 1448, 59 L. Ed. 2d 711 (1979). Atchison also teaches, however, that the four-pronged test from Louisiana-Pacific, relied upon by plaintiffs here, ""mirror[s] the 
traditional successor liability rules of most states, including California."" 159 F.3d at 362. No party has identified which body of 
state successor-liability law applies to the question now before the Court, but neither is any potential conflict apparent (unlike, for "
548,," example, the potential conflicts apparent in various states' application of antitrust standing principles, see supra Part II, Section 
II.A.2.b). Accordingly, this Court applies the substantive corporate law of California. Patton v. Cox, 276 F.3d 493, 495 (9th Cir. 
2002) (""When a federal court sits in diversity, it must look to the forum state's choice of law rules to determine the controlling 
substantive law.""); Hatfield v. Halifax PLC, 564 F.3d 1177, 1184 (9th Cir. 2009) (""Under California's choice of law rules, a 
California court will apply its own rule [*175]  of decision unless a party litigant timely invokes the law of a foreign state."" (internal 
quotation marks omitted)). That law, as provided by the parties, appears to be coextensive with the test quoted from Atchison. 
See Daniell v. Riverside Partners I, L.P., 206 Cal. App. 4th 1292, 1300, 142 Cal. Rptr. 3d 717 (Cal. Ct. App. 2012), reh'g denied 
(July 11, 2012). "
549,35," The Court previously ruled that plaintiffs had failed to allege the existence of a conspiracy during the years 2000 and 2001. 
Jan. 21 Order at 21-22. Nothing in this ruling should be deemed to comment on whether the present complaints adequately 
allege a conspiracy operating in the years 2000 and 2001 which Yuasa, GS-Melcotec, or GS Soft Energy could have 
participated. That question is not now before the Court. "
551,36," As they did with respect to GS Yuasa, plaintiffs rely on Atchison. Here, however, and unlike in their argument as to GS Yuasa, 
they fail to identify which of the four circumstances where successor liability may obtain—assumption of liability, de-facto 
merger, mere continuation, or fraud—that they believe applies to SEND. See Atchison, 159 F.3d at 361. This vagueness alone 
would be reason enough to decline their invitation to impute successor liability here. As it stands, the paucity of 
allegations [*187]  concerning any successor liability theory makes the failure to identify a cognizable theory of such liability 
beside the point."
551,37," Though the Court is tolerant of imprecision inherent in the documents relied upon by plaintiffs, the imprecision created by the 
Plaintiffs themselves unnecessarily confuses a reader. For example, the IPP-SCAC refers, unhelpfully, to ""Sony North America,"" 
which is not a party to this case (or, according to defendants, an entity at all). Though defendants argue that the reference is so 
vague as to warrant dismissal (Dkt. No. 431 at 6 n.4), given that SEL is the only Sony defendant based in North America, the 
parties—including defendants—appear to understand the term to refer to SEL. (See id. (presuming that the allegations are 
""directed at SEL and SEND"").) SEND and SEL nevertheless have a point: the allegations of the IPP-SCAC are inconsistent and 
unclear in their delineation of corporate defendants and third parties. (E.g., IPP-SCAC ¶ 229 (referring to parties as ""Sony 
Electronics — San Jose, California"" and ""Sony Energy Devices of Japan"").) Given the scope of this litigation, [*189]  clarity is 
required. The IPPs request leave to amend to add allegations unique to the DPPs' complaint. (Dkt. No. 457 at 2 n.2.) In the interest of 
efficiency, the Court reviews the allegations of both complaints for now. However, the Court also GRANTS to both the IPPs and 
the DPPs leave to amend for the limited purpose of adopting a consistent nomenclature for both parties and third parties, and, 
consistent with Rule 11, adding allegations present in the other's complaint. This Order permits but does not require such 
amendment. "
553,38," As to the merits of Toshiba Corp.'s arguments, were the Court to consider them, suffice it to say that the amended complaints 
allege no less than did the earlier iterations. "
559,1," See FTC, PAY-FOR-DELAY: HOW DRUG COMPANY PAY-OFFS COST CONSUMERS BILLIONS: A FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION STAFF

559,2," Effexor is a tablet that dissolves rapidly, [*15]  resulting in a rapid increase in blood plasma levels of venlafaxine shortly after 
administration. (Second Am. Compl. at ¶ 63). Compounds with such rapid dissolution profiles are referred to as ""instant release"" 
formulations. (Id.). Levels of venlafaxine in the blood gradually decrease, reaching sub-therapeutic levels in about twelve hours. 
(Id.). "
560,3," The Husbands patent would have expired much earlier than 2008, but Wyeth ""received a significant extension to reflect the 
time it took the FDA to approve its NDA for Effexor and an additional six month extension for having conducted pediatric 
studies[]."" (Id.)."
560,4," Inderal LA, a ""longer acting"" or extended release product, had been formulated over a decade earlier and received marketing 
approval from the FDA in April 1983. (Id. at ¶ 72)."
560,5," In the early 1990s, Alza also sought patent protection for its extended release osmotic approach for venlafaxine. On May 27, 
1993, Alza filed patent application No. 08/068,480 listing the inventors as Edgren, et al. (the ""Edgren application""). (Id. at ¶ 88). 
On August 27, 2002, the Edgren application issued as U.S. Patent No. 6,440,457 (the ""Edgren patent"" or the ""'457 patent""). On "
561,," December 8, 1994, the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva, Switzerland [*20]  published WO 94/27589, 
assigned to Alza (the ""'589 PCT application""). (Id. at ¶ 89). According to Plaintiffs, the '589 PCT application ""claims priority to the 
Edgren application and disclosed to the public all features of the Edgren application."" (Id.). Alza's '589 PCT application allegedly 
""describes, repeatedly, the broader notion that the use of extended release venlafaxine would reduce the daily spiking in blood 
plasma levels that result from multiple daily usage of venlafaxine."" (Id. at ¶ 90). "
562,6," According to Wyeth, because Examiner Hulina had identified the Upton patent during her independent search for prior art and 
rejected certain claims over it, ""the Upton patent . . . was known to the PTO [*25]  from the very beginning of the prosecution."" 
(Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Wyeth Defs. Mot. to Dismiss All Direct Purchaser Compls. (""Wyeth Br."") at 6) (ECF No. 138)."
562,7," Wyeth contends that the ""family history of the '137 application (before Examiner Hulina) . . . was [actually] before Examiner 
Spear, including the fact that Examiner Hulina had initially rejected claims in view of Upton and the proposed amendment of the 
claims, [since] the history is listed in each Effexor XR application and on the first page of each Effexor XR Patent."" (Id. at 6-7). 
Wyeth further contends that it disclosed Alza's '589 PCT application in each of its patent applications beginning with the '328 
application. (Id. at 8). Moreover, according to Wyeth, ""[b]eginning with the '137 application, in each of its patent applications 
Wyeth disclosed . . . [the] patent covering Inderal LA[.]"" (Id. at 9). "
565,8," In October 2006, with Wyeth's permission, Teva obtained FDA approval and began selling generic instant release [*36]  
venlafaxine. (Second Am. Compl. at ¶ 274). In June 2008, the Husbands patent expired. (Id.)."
565,9," The agreement to delay included a provision for an earlier launch by Teva if another generic entered earlier than July 2010, or 
if another generic was successful in invalidating the '171, '120 and '958 patents. (Id. at ¶ 276)."
565,10," According to Defendants, pursuant to the Wyeth-Teva agreement, Wyeth granted Teva an exclusive license to sell generic 
versions of Effexor years before expiry of the relevant patents — seven years early in the case of Effexor XR and two years 
early in the case of Effexor IR. (Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss Direct Purchaser Class Pls.' Second Am. Compl. (""Defs.' 
Supp. Br."") at 6) (ECF No. 305)."
565,11," Defendants, in contrast, contend that ""Wyeth did not pay one dollar to Teva . . . so that the generic challenger would 'stay 
out.'"" (Id.). Rather, according to Defendants, ""Teva paid Wyeth for the procompetitive right to sell generic versions of Effexor, 
through substantial royalties."" (Id.)"
565,12," The court hearing the underlying [*39]  patent case solicited the FTC's views pursuant to a 2002 Consent Decree in which the 
FTC had secured the right to weigh in on Wyeth's settlements and to raise objections in advance. See In the Matter of Schering-
Plough Corp., Upsher-Smith Labs, Inc., & Am. Home Prods. Corp., Decision and Order, Docket No. 9297 (Apr. 2, 2002). 
According to Defendants, ""the Consent Decree required Wyeth to (1) produce to the FTC not only the settlement and all related 
agreements themselves, but also a variety of additional materials, including documents prepared internally at Wyeth for the 
evaluation of the settlement, (2) provide the patent court with a copy of the Consent Decree and Analysis to Aid Public 
Comment, and (3) 'not oppose any effort by the Commission to participate, in any capacity permitted by the [patent] court, in the 
court's consideration' of the settlement."" (Letter from Liza M. Walsh, Connell Foley LLP to Judge Peter G. Sheridan, U.S. Dist. 
Ct. for the Dist. of N.J., at 2 (June 13, 2014) (ECF No. 320). "

572,16," In In re Nexium, AstraZeneca and three generic defendants—Ranbaxy, Teva, and Dr. Reddy's, were alleged to have entered 
into reverse payment agreements to keep a generic version of Nexium off the market. All three generic defendants agreed to 
refrain from selling generic versions of Nexium until May 27, 2014 when some (but not all) of the patents had expired, though 
this was years after the generic defendants were initially proposing in their Paragraph IV certifications and arguing in the 
resulting litigations. In return, AstraZeneca agreed to not to produce its own authorized generic version [*63]  of Nexium during 
Ranbaxy's 180—day exclusivity period, allegedly accruing a value to Ranbaxy of over $1 billion. It is unclear from the opinion if 
there was a cash payment made to Ranbaxy. Also, AstraZeneca forgave contingent liabilities of both Teva and Dr. Reddy's 
related to ""at risk"" launches of generic versions of non-related products. The generic defendants urged the court to read Actavis 
to apply only to monetary payments and the court declined. At the motion to dismiss stage, the In re Nexium court found the 
allegations sufficient to allege an antitrust violation. In re Nexium (Esomeprazole) Antitrust Litig., 968 F. Supp. 2d 367, 392 (D. 
Mass. 2013). Later, at the summary judgment stage, the court denied summary judgment made on similar grounds. In re Nexium

572,17," In this case, GlaxoSmithKline (""GSK"") and the generic defendant Teva are alleged to have entered into reverse payment 
agreements to keep a generic version of Lamictal off the market. GSK allowed certain generic forms of Lamictal to enter the 
market before all patent claims had expired, though later than Teva was initially proposing in its Paragraph IV certification and 
arguing in the resulting litigation. In return, GSK [*64]  agreed to not to produce its own authorized generic version of Lamictal 
during Teva's 180-day exclusivity period. The court held that application of Actavis did require a monetary payment to have 
occurred in the settlement and the no-authorized generic agreement was not a payment within Actavis. The court concluded that 
""the settlement was reasonable and not the sort that requires Actavis scruitiny."" "

policies may be outside the scope of the privilege because ""they are often merely a compendium of policies and rules""). 
Companies also frequently disclose their compliance policies voluntarily as evidence of their efforts to comply with the antitrust 
laws. "
596,1," Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Final Approval of the Class Action Settlement Between Plaintiffs and Defendant Cal-Maine Foods, 
Inc. (Docket No. 1036) (hereinafter, ""Mot.""), accompanied by a Memorandum in Support of the Motion (Docket No. 1036-2) 
(hereinafter, ""Mem. Supp. Mot.""). "
597,2," The exhibits and materials submitted in relation to the Motion, the hearing on the Motion, and the overall [**2]  record of this 
case provide the sources for the factual background discussed here. The Court also considered the pending Plaintiffs' Motion for 
an Award of Attorneys' Fees and for Reimbursement of Expenses (Docket No. 999) (hereinafter, ""Fees Mot."") and the 
accompanying Memorandum in Support (Docket No. 999-1) (hereinafter ""Mem. Supp. Fees Mot."") in which Plaintiffs seek 
attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses relating to the litigation to be paid from the Cal-Maine Settlement. As for the 
Fees Motion, the Court does not address here the substantive arguments, which will be considered separately. "
598,3," The terms used in this Order that are defined in the Cal-Maine Settlement Agreement are, unless otherwise defined herein, 
used in this Order consistent with the definitions of the Agreement. "
602,4," This figure includes new Claim Forms filed for the Cal-Maine settlement, of which there are 470, as well as prior claims (e.g. 
from the Moark Settlement) and supplemental submissions. Mem. Supp. Mot. 7-8."
602,5," The Supreme Court explained: ""What matters to class certification . . . is not the raising of common 'questions'—even [**21]  in 
droves—but, rather the capacity of a classwide proceeding to generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the 
litigation. Dissimilarities within the proposed class are what have the potential to impede the generation of common answers."" 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (quoting Richard A. Nagareda, Class 
Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 132 (2009)). "
604,6," The Court may also consider other possibly relevant information as to the adequacy of counsel, such as proposed terms for 
attorneys' fees and nontaxable costs and ""any other matter pertinent to counsel's ability to fairly and adequately represent the 
interests of the class."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(B), (C). "
606,7," For these same reasons, to the extent that consideration of Rule 23(b)(3)(C) is pertinent here, and, for now, without regard to 
the remand mechanisms for an MDL action, it would be preferable to adjudicate these claims in one judicial proceeding and in 
one forum as a class action. See Amalgamated Workers Union of Virgin Islands v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., 478 F.2d 540, 
543, 10 V.I. 575 (3d Cir. 1973) (""The 'superiority requirement' was intended to refer to the preferability of adjudicating claims of 
multiple-parties in one judicial proceeding and in one forum, rather than forcing each plaintiff to proceed by separate suit, and 
possibly requiring a defendant to answer suits growing out of one incident in geographically separated courts.""). See generally 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) 1966 note (""Also pertinent is the question of the desirability of concentrating the trial of the claims in the 
particular forum by means of a class action, in contrast to allowing the claims to be litigated separately in forums to which they 
would ordinarily [**36]  be brought.""). However, as one commentator has discussed, in light of 28 U.S.C. § 1407, as a general 
matter, ""[t]his factor should . . . be of little or no significance in resolving the superiority issue."" Newberg, supra, §4:31. Indeed, 
this factor appears to have limited bearing under the present circumstances because the United States Judicial Panel on 
Multidistrict Litigation previously considered, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, the desirability of centralizing the various initially-filed 
direct purchaser class action suits in this particular forum, see Processed Egg, 588 F. Supp. 2d at 1367, and a consolidated 
class action complaint was filed which superseded all previously-filed direct purchaser complaints. "
608,8," The Manual for Complex Litigation observes that the ""task is demanding because the adversariness of litigation is often lost 
after the agreement to settle."" David F. Herr, The Manual for Complex Litigation § 21.61, at 487 (4th ed. 2011). Indeed, the 
observation that ""'[c]ourts applying [a multifactor] test [ ] often recite the litany and engage in pro forma analyses, [**41]  but their 
hearts are not in it,'"" could be an equally a propos statement for those parties advancing unopposed motions for final settlement 
approval. Ehrheart v. Verizon Wireless, 609 F.3d 590, 605 n.10 (3d Cir. 2010) (dissenting, Smith, J.) (quoting Jonathan R. 
Macey & Geoffrey P. Miller, Judicial Review of Class Action Settlements, 1 J. of Legal Analysis 167, 172 (2009)). Here, there is an absence of any objectors or any adversarial challenge to the Motion for Final Approval, just as there were no 
objectors to the earlier settlements between Plaintiffs and Moark and Sparboe. See July 16, 2012 Memorandum 32. The lack of 
objectors leaves the Court with no meaningful arguments in the record criticizing this settlement. Nonetheless, the Court 
recognizes that ""[w]hether or not there are objectors or opponents to the proposed settlement, the court must make an 
independent analysis of the settlement terms."" Herr, supra, at 488. The Court, recognizing that a lack of adversariness at the 
final approval stage does not bear on whether the settlement negotiations themselves were hard-fought and sufficiently 
adversarial, must look past the lack of objectors and determine itself whether the settlement negotiations were fair, reasonable 
and adequate. "
609,9," The Court of Appeals invites individualized analysis by noting that ""[o]ther related factors . . . also may be relevant to this 
inquiry."" Prudential, 148 F. 3d at 323 n.73. "
610,10," Although the response rate to the Notice of Settlement (as measured by the number of Claim Forms returned in relation to 
number of Notices distributed) is low, the Court does not draw any inferences of some sort of negative class reaction to the "
611,," settlement from this response rate. Cf. Zimmer, 758 F.2d at 92-93 (3d Cir.1985) (recognizing that an ostensibly low response 
rate may not in fact be low in light of other similar settlements). As previously discussed, the Court has determined that Class 
Members had adequate notice and opportunity to submit claims, opt out, or file objections. "
613,11," Based on this observation, the Court of Appeals has questioned the significance of this factor [**57]  in ""settlement-only"" class 
actions following the Supreme Court's decision in Amchem. See Prudential, 148 F.3d at 321. "
614,12," The Third Circuit Court of Appeals expects that ""settling parties should provide[] information to determine the range of 
reasonableness of the [settlement] allocation 'in light of the best possible recovery,' and 'in light of all the attendant risks of 
litigation.'"" Pet Food, 629 F.3d at 354 (citations omitted). The Court further explains that ""'[t]his figure should generate a range of 
reasonableness (based on size of the proposed award and the uncertainty inherent in these estimates) within which a district 
court approving (or rejecting) a settlement will not be set aside.' Precise value determinations are not required.'"" Id."
614,13, Plaintiffs have not proffered any evidence for the record concerning such a present value analysis.
614,14," The Court does not comment on whether the information and [**63]  facts that Cal-Maine may provide would be established, 
or even admissible, at trial, based upon counsel's representations. "
615,15," See generally In re Ikon Office Solutions, Inc., Secs. Litig., 194 F.R.D. 166, 184 (E.D. Pa. 2000) (""Approval of a plan of 
allocation of a settlement fund in a class action is 'governed by the same standards of review applicable to approval of the 
settlement as a whole: the distribution plan must be fair, reasonable and adequate.'"" (quoting In re Computron Software, Inc., 6 
F. Supp. 2d 313, 321 (D.N.J. 1998)); Newberg, supra, § 12.35 (same)."
615,16," As discussed earlier, following the final fairness hearing Plaintiffs filed a Motion for an Award of Attorneys' Fees and for 
Reimbursement of Expenses, in which Plaintiffs seek specific amounts for attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses 
relating to the litigation to be paid from the Cal-Maine Settlement. The Court intends to address this Motion separately and does 
not consider here the substantive arguments presented in that Motion in relation to considering whether the Cal-Maine 
Settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. After all, the Court's inquiry as to this Prudential factor focuses on whether the 
settlement agreement's provision for attorneys' fees are reasonable, and that provision only sets forth that attorneys' [**69]  fees 
and expenses are subject to Court approval. "
638,1," Defendants' motion for reconsideration also seeks partial summary judgment on behalf of Gaspari Bros. Inc., Sher-Rockee 
Mushroom Farm LLC, LRP Mushrooms, and John and Michael Pia for the reasons they previously asserted in their July 1, 2008 
Memorandum of Law in Support of Certain Defendants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Dkt. No. 245). Dkt. No. 513 at p. 
2. I denied their prior motion without prejudice to refiling after the completion of discovery. See In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser "
639,," Antitrust Litig., 621 F. Supp. 2d 274, 282 n.6 (E.D. Pa. 2009). I will decide their request for partial summary judgment on the 
basis of their prior arguments in a separate decision. Also now pending in this litigation [**42]  are a number of other motions, including plaintiffs' January 6, 2014 motion for class 
certification of the alleged injured class, Dkt. No. 514, and the parties' numerous submissions related to that motion, defendants' 
motion for adjudication of plaintiffs' claims under the Rule of Reason, Dkt. No. 492, plaintiffs' cross-motion, Dkt. No. 495, and 
defendants' motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims, Dkt. No. 518."

motion for reconsideration."
639,3," Defendants filed this motion on [**43]  January 6, 2014. They seek reconsideration of my 2009 decision based on their 
contention that the decisions in American Needle Inc. v. National Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 
947 (2010), and Deutscher Tennis Bund v. ATP Tour, Inc., 610 F.3d 820 (3d Cir. 2010), have effected an intervening change in 
law warranting reconsideration. These decisions were issued more than three and a half years ago and plaintiffs argue that 
defendants' motion for reconsideration is untimely. Defendants counter by explaining that they delayed in filing this motion since 
""Phase II discovery was ongoing"" and ""the Court had entered a stipulated Scheduling Order that required the parties to wait until 
all fact and expert discovery was completed before filing summary judgment and other substantive motions"" by February 11, 
2014. Dkt. No. 552 at Mem. p. 2. Notwithstanding defendants' assertion of the unrelated motion for partial summary judgment in conjunction with their motion for 
reconsideration, see Dkt. No. 513 at p. 2, the issues in defendants' motion related to the applicability of the Capper-Volstead 
exemption were not the subject of Phase II discovery. Defendants therefore should have brought their motion for reconsideration 
based on American Needle and Deutscher Tennis Bund after the Court of Appeals lifted its stay of this matter on 
September [**44]  30, 2011. However, in the interests of justice, I will consider defendants' argument that an intervening change 
in law now necessitates reconsideration of my prior interlocutory decision denying defendants' motion for summary judgment on 
the issue of Capper-Volstead immunity. See HN1[
] Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (An order that does not dispose of every claim in an action ""may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties rights and 
liabilities.""); see also Pellicano v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Ass'n, 540 F. App'x 95, 97 n.4 (3d Cir. 2013) (finding that where the 
District Court's order was not a final judgment, the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration was ""was nothing more than an 
interlocutory motion invoking the district court's general discretionary authority to review and revise interlocutory rulings prior to 
entry of final judgment . . . ."") (citation omitted); Mohammad v. Kelchner, No. 03-1134, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40762, 2005 WL

reconsider an interlocutory order whenever it is 'consonant with justice to do so.'""). "
640,4," I did not [**46]  address defendants' third argument as I found that defendants were not able to defeat plaintiffs' first and 
second arguments. See infra, note 11. "
641,5," My analysis of the single entity/enterprise defense is also applicable to plaintiffs' conspiracy to monopolize claim under § 2 of 
the Sherman Act because the same requirement of a plurality of actors is present. See Trugman-Nash, Inc. v. N.Z. Dairy Bd., 
942 F. Supp. 905, 920 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), on reh'g sub nom, Trugman-Nash, Inc. v. N.Z. Dairy Bd., Milk Prods. Holdings (N. Am.) 
Inc., 954 F. Supp. 733 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (HN6[

mushroom distribution companies, respectively located in Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Atlanta. Id. The remaining 50% 
ownership interest in the distribution centers was held by Stuart Thomas through his ownership of Thomas Mushroom

643,8," Phase I of discovery in this matter proceeded and concluded under the controlling precedents of Copperweld and Siegel 
Transfer, Inc. v. Carrier Express, Inc., 54 F.3d 1125 (3d Cir. 1995)."
643,9," Specifically, Manfredini testified that LRP-M ""work[s] in conjunction with LRP . . . . That's why they're tied together."" Dkt. No. 
252-17 at 21:19-22:2 (D. Manfredini Dep.)."
643,10," My prior decision considered elements of the relationship between LRP-M and Manfredini Enterprises that, after American 
Needle, are no longer considered to be dispositive in determining whether they constitute a single entity. See In re Mushroom, 
621 F. Supp. 2d at 290 (discussing the entities' common control structure)."
643,11," As plaintiffs correctly point out: Although plaintiffs may establish entitlement to summary judgment in their favor by demonstrating defendants' inability to 
establish any one of the three bases outlined by the [**58]  Court[: (1) inclusion of a non-grower member in the EMMC; (2) 
agreement with persons or entities not engaged in agricultural production; or (3) anticompetitive and predatory practices 
that fall outside the legitimate object of an agricultural cooperative,] defendants must establish as a matter of undisputed 
fact that none of the three is true. "

are handled by it for members."" Id."
644,13," As defendants argue, this issue was not specifically considered in my 2009 decision. Dkt. No. 513, Mem. at p. 1. I note that

affirmative defense that they were immune from antitrust liability because they believed in good faith that they were complying 
with antitrust laws or Capper-Volstead)."
645,15," Additionally, defendants were instructed by their counsel that members of the EMMC must be ""'producers,' i.e. mushroom 
growers and farmers"" and were advised that the Capper-Volstead Act affords only a limited exception and does not provide ""a 
blanket immunity from antitrust law."" Dkt. No. 492 (Ex. A). Counsel also advised defendants that ""there is no protection offered 
by . . . Capper-Volstead if the potentially § 1 offending 'agreement' is entered into with a non-member"" and ""there is also no 
protection if the activity engaged in under Capper-Volstead § 1 shield otherwise violates the complex law under § 2 of the 
Sherman Act . . . ."" Id."
645,16," Defendants support their argument with the following limited set of out-of-context quotations that merely state that the Act 
allows farmers to take advantage of a certain organizational business structure:"
645,61," CONG. REC. 1033 (1921) (statement of Rep. Volstead noting that the object of the Capper-Volstead Act was to ""modify 
the laws under which business organizations are now formed, so that farmers may take advantage of the form of 
organizations that is used by business concerns""; Md. & Va. Milk Producers Ass'n. v. United States, 362 U.S. 458, 466, 80 
S. Ct. 847, 4 L. Ed. 2d 880 (1960) (""[The Act] aims to equalize privileges by changing the law applicable [**66]  to ordinary 
business corporations so the farmers can take advantage of it"") quoting H.R. REP. NO. 67-24, at 2 (1921) . . . . Dkt. No. 513, Mem. at pp. 3-4. I observe that HN17[
] the Supreme Court in Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Ass'n clearly stated that the language of §§ 1 and 2 of the Capper-Volstead Act and § 7 of the Clayton Act ""shows no more than a purpose to 
allow farmers to act together in cooperative associations without the associations as such being 'held or construed to be illegal "
646,," combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade, under the antitrust laws,' as they otherwise might have been."" 362 U.S. at 465 
(internal citations omitted)."
646,17," HN18[
] The issue of good faith reliance on counsel was not before the Court of Appeals in Consolidated Express nor considered by it in its decision. The Court's holding was limited to the specific retroactive application of an unforeseeable change 
in law. It ""recognized that [the Clayton Act's § 4] damage remedy is effective as a deterrent only when its application to an 
agreement can be foreseen by the parties at the time they [were] engaged in collective bargaining."" Consolidated Express, 602 
F.2d at 520. The Court found that § 4's remedy had a strong punitive element which was difficult to apply to conduct [**67]  
which the ""parties had no reason to believe would ever be held to be illegal, and may even have reasonably believed to be 
legally compelled."" Id. However, the Court specifically noted that its concern about illegality resulted from an unanticipated shift 
in a National Labor Relations Board policy and ""[a]ntitrust policy may not be significantly advanced by giving retroactive effect"" to 
such changes in application of § 4. See id."
646,18," Without explanation defendants also cite to In re Lower Lake Erie Iron Ore Antitrust Litigation, 759 F. Supp. 219 (E.D. Pa.

dictum in Flanagan that the California legislature was concerned that the increasingly popular cellular network did not have the 
same privacy guarantees as landlines. See Young, 2014 WL 3434117, at *1. "
654,6," CRF notes that Pepper fails to allege that he was in California when the calls at issue were received. Nevertheless, at this 
stage the Court must construe the facts in Pepper's favor. While he does not allege that he was in California when he received 
the calls, he assert that he resided in California at all relevant times. (Compl. ¶ 5.) In context, this suggests that Pepper received 
at least one of CRF's calls while located in California. "
655,7," In light of the Court's holding granting judgment on the pleadings to CRF as to the § 632 claim, it does not consider Pepper's 
UCL claim based on that cause of action. "
656,8," Pepper's argument that § 17204 does not apply to his UCL claim because it seeks only injunctive relief is inapposite. See 
Stoba v. Saveology.com, LLC, No. 13-CV-2925-BAS NLS, 2014 WL 3573404 (S.D. Cal. July 18, 2014) (citing Buckland v.

700,4," The defendants who have pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges include British Airways Plc., Korean Air Lines Ltd., Qantas

Malaysia Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Ltd., Emirates Airline, El Al Israel Airlines Ltd., Air Canada, AC Cargo LP, and 
Salvatore Sanfilippo. (ECF No. 1732)."
701,8," Additionally, the court has granted preliminary approval of proposed settlements with certain remaining defendants. On January 
29, 2014, the court granted preliminary approval to the plaintiffs' settlements with Singapore Airlines Ltd, Singapore Airlines 
Cargo Pte Ltd. (ECF No. 1980) and Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd. (ECF No. 1979). On March 4, 2014, the court granted preliminary 
approval to the plaintiffs' settlement with Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. (ECF [*111]  No. 1992). On May 16, 2014, the court 
granted preliminary approval to the plaintiffs' settlement with China Airlines, Ltd. (ECF No. 2017). On August 22, 2014, Judge 
Gleeson entered an order authorizing the dissemination of the class notice and claim form for these settlements, and scheduling 
a fairness hearing for January 16, 2015. (ECF No. 2047). "
702,9," After the Daubert motions were fully briefed, the defendants moved to strike the final McClave declaration, arguing that 
because it introduced a revised multiple regression analysis, it violated the scheduling order barring further briefing on the class 
certification issue. ECF No. 1911. Included with the defendants' motion was an additional declaration from Mr. Kaplan, refuting 
Dr. McClave's new findings. ECF No. 1912-1. Finding that the Court would benefit from as much information as possible, I 
denied the motion and agreed to consider McClave's additional [*114]  declaration and Kaplan's sur-reply for both class 
certification and Daubert purposes. ECF No. 1946. "
709,10," In anticipation of the court's Rule 23 discussion, later in this opinion, the court notes that although Kaplan's testimony 
regarding potentially omitted factors is admissible, its significance on the question of class certification is not great. Bazemore v. 
Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 400, 106 S. Ct. 3000, 92 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1986) (""While the omission of variables from a regression may 
render the analysis less probative than it otherwise might be, it can hardly be said, absent some other infirmity, that an analysis 
which accounts for the major factors must be considered unacceptable."") (quotation marks omitted). Because McClave has 
accounted for the ""major factors,"" any omitted factors identified by Kaplan will go to its weight on the merits, and will not preclude 
its use as common proof under Rule 23(a)(2) and (b)(3). McClave has also put forth some bases to believe that many of 
Kaplan's purportedly omitted factors are in [*140]  fact accounted for in McClave's model, Kaplan Mem. 20-21 (citing McClave 
Reply Decl. § 10.1 at 69-70; Rausser Decl. ¶ 77-78), and that the explanatory variables in his models accounted for most of the 
price variability in the industry. McClave Reply Decl. §§ 10.0-10.4. These issues go solely to the merits, and would be 
inappropriate to resolve at this stage of litigation. Amgen, Inc. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, 133 S.Ct. 1184, 
1194-95, 185 L. Ed. 2d 308 (2013) (HN10[
] ""Merits questions may be considered to the extent—but only to the extent—that they are relevant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.""). "
710,11," The court is aware that in other cases where the defendants' experts have testified, courts not only permitted but were actually 
swayed by their similar use of sub-regressions. [*145]  See Oral Arg. Trans. 136:10-13. But those cases are easily 
distinguishable. In In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., the plaintiffs simply did not contest the accuracy of Dr. Burtis's 
sub-regressions. 253 F.R.D. 478, 495 (N.D. Cal. 2008). Similarly, although the plaintiffs in In re Plastics Additives Antitrust Litig., 
attacked the reliability of some of Mr. Kaplan's sub-regressions, the ones they did not attack were found by the court to be 
sufficient to demonstrate the absence of antitrust impact on a number of class members. No. 03-CV-2038, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 90135, 2010 WL 3431837, at *17 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 31, 2010). Here, the defendants and their experts have unequivocally 
admitted that this is not what their sub-regressions show, Kaplan Opp. 10 (citing Kaplan Decl. ¶ 32, n.72, Moore Decl. ¶¶ 27-28), 
so the probative value of this testimony is substantially diminished. Put another way, the defendants concede that their experts' "
711,," sub-regressions do not actually demonstrate that one or more class members did not suffer antitrust impact. Rather, they offer 
the sub-regressions merely in an effort to demonstrate that McClave's regressions are not a reliable method of proving that all 
class members did suffer antitrust impact. "
716,12," She then compares this expected result to one of her sub-regressions in which, according to her calculations, rates increased 
by 22 percent when the cost variable increased by one percent. Burtis Decl. ¶ 94. To Burtis, this discrepancy illustrates how 
McClave's global coefficients may be wildly un-predictive of actual prices. Id. "
717,13," In particular, Burtis should not be permitted to offer the opinion that ""Dr. McClave's model assumes that when [*168]  the cost 
variable increases by one percent, inbound rates fall by 10.37 percent, all else equal."" Burtis Decl. ¶ 94. "
720,14," See Section III.E, infra, for a more in-depth discussion of the common questions this case presents. "
721,15," See Section III.E.2.b.iv, infra."
721,16," See, e.g., Coolidge Decl., Ex. 18 at 3rd page (internal Lufthansa e-mail detailing meeting of eight defendants and stressing the 
importance of allowing ""no exceptions [to the fuel surcharge] in origin markets, . . . destination areas, . . . [or] forwarders and 
shippers. Allowing one exception will defeat the whole industrial movement.""); id. Ex. 19 at 3rd page (letter from Y. Shimono, 
Nippon Cargo Airlines, to S. Sugimoto, All Nippon Airways, characterizing fuel surcharge implementation as an ""industrywide 
action"")."
721,17," See, e.g., Coolidge Decl., Ex. 6 at 7th page (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's [*181]  judgment against 
British Airways, finding that ""the most appropriate market for analyzing the conduct the subject of these proceedings is and has 
been at all material times a worldwide market for air cargo services, hereinafter referred to as the Air Cargo Market, and 
international air cargo carriers, including British Airways and Lufthansa, are, and at all material times have been, actual or 
potential competitors in the supply of international air cargo services in the Air Cargo Market""); Landau Decl., Ex. 224 at ¶ 15 
(European Commission's finding that in the air cargo market ""any indirect route is generally substitutable to any direct routes. 
The vast majority of the respondents to the market investigation agreed upon this approach.""); id. Ex. 229 at ¶ 44 (Australian 
federal court's finding that ""[a] customer would never accept the transport of his or her goods from Melbourne to Tokyo as a 
substitute for transporting them from Melbourne to Boston. But, if there were suppliers who would, given a sufficient price signal, 
devote their resources to the former in preference to the latter, those suppliers should be regarded as doing business in the 
same market""). "
727,18," Similarly, during Polar's sentencing hearing, Judge Bates noted that ""because of joint and several liability under the Sherman 
Act . . . [the victims] potential recovery [in a civil action against Polar] is the same as it is . . . with respect to the other airlines. 
And it's the reason here, as in other cases, why at the outset the Government decided not to insist upon restitution and the 
parties, the Government and Polar, agreed to that as part of their plea agreement."" Landau Reply Decl., Ex. 263. "
729,19," Such is the case in many antitrust class actions where plaintiffs rely on expert testimony to establish a common method for 
proving the elements of injury and damages on a classwide basis. See, e.g., Comcast v. Behrend, 133 S.Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 
515 (2013); Cordes, 502 F.3d at 106-09; In re IPO, 471 F.3d at 41; Caridad v. Metro-North Commuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 291-
92 (2d. Cir. 1999); In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d at 321-22); Blades v. Monsanto Co., 400 F.3d 562, 570, 
575 (8th Cir. 2005); West v. Prudential Sec., Inc., 282 F.3d 935, 938 (7th Cir. 2002); In re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litig., 
985 F. Supp. 2d 1167, 1205-16 (N.D. Cal. 2013); In re Titanium Dioxide Antitrust Litig., 284 F.R.D. 328, 346-49 (D. Md. 2012); In

2010); Reed v. Advocate Health Care, 268 F.R.D. 573, 582-95 (N.D. Ill. 2009); In re EPDM, 256 F.R.D. 82, 91-102 (D. Conn. 
2009). "
731,20," Notably, however, Piggly Wiggly is only a damages case, and does not actually support the proposition that impact can be 
completely offset by negotiations. To the contrary, the court found that ""[a]lthough proof of antitrust injury can be shown by the 
common proof that each was in fact injured by the alleged conspiracy, the amount of damages resulting from that injury will 
require some degree of investigation into facts specific to each Plaintiff and potentially facts specific to each Plaintiff's numerous 
negotiations and transactions over the course of many years."" 100 Fed. Appx. at 298 (quotation marks omitted)."
731,21," Because the plaintiffs do not advance the argument that the defendants have conferred injury on its customers merely by 
""fixing"" the starting point for negotiations, the court does not consider this argument. However, the court does note that such an 
argument may have some basis under existing law. See, e.g., In re EPDM, 256 F.R.D. at 88-89 (""[I]t is possible for a plaintiff to 
suffer antitrust injury-in-fact [*217]  and yet have no damages because it has taken steps to mitigate the actual price paid 
through rebates, discounts, and other non-price factors . . .. By expending resources to negotiate down from the 
supracompetitive prices established by the cartel, plaintiffs who have suffered no damages may still have suffered an injury-in-
fact from the antitrust conspiracy. The fact that a plaintiff may have successfully employed bargaining power to fend off the effect 
of the conspiratorial practice does not mean that it has not been put in a worse position but-for the conspiracy."" (emphasis in 
original)); see also In re NASDAQ Market-Makers Antitrust Litig., 169 F.R.D. at 523 (""Neither a variety of prices nor negotiated 
prices is an impediment to class certification if it appears that plaintiffs may be able to prove at trial that . . . the price range was 
affected generally.""); id. (""The proof necessary to demonstrate that the defendants conspired to maintain an inflated 'base' from 
which all pricing negotiations began and that this 'base' price was higher than the 'base' price which would have been 
established by competitive conditions would be common to all members of the class. . . Accordingly . . . the fact of damage is 
predominantly, if not exclusively, [*218]  a common question."" (quoting Hedges Enterprises, Inc. v. Continental Group, Inc.., 81 
F.R.D. 461, 475 (E.D. Pa. 1979)); In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., 251 F.R.D. 629, 638 (D. Kan. 2008) (""[E]vidence of a 
standardized pricing structure, which (in light of the alleged conspiracy) presumably establishes an artificially inflated baseline 
from which any individualized negotiations would proceed, provides generalized proof of class-wide impact.""); In re Industrial 
Diamonds Antitrust Litig., 167 F.R.D. 374, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (""The theory that underlies these decisions is, of course, that the 
negotiated transaction prices would have been lower if the starting point for negotiations had been list prices set in a competitive 
market. Hence, if a plaintiff proves that the alleged conspiracy resulted in artificially inflated list prices, a jury could reasonably 
conclude that each purchaser who negotiated an individual price suffered some injury.""); Fears v. Wilhelmina Model Agency, 
Inc., No. 02-CV-4911, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11897, 2003 WL 21659373, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 15, 2003). "
732,22," The court recognizes that the plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating antitrust impact, and has analyzed the evidence to 
determine whether the plaintiffs have met that burden. Nevertheless, securities law jurisprudence suggests that a burden-shifting 
approach might be a fairer way to address that issue in a case such as this one where plaintiffs produce substantial evidence of 
price-fixing as to one of the components of price. Under such an approach, upon adequate proof of the existence of a conspiracy 
to fix a component of price, a presumption would arise that the conspiracy had the effect of raising the overall price of the 
product or service at issue. It would then fall to defendants to affirmatively demonstrate that their price-fixing did not produce that 
result. That approach mirrors the approach in so-called [*220]  ""fraud on the market"" cases which was recently reaffirmed by the 
Supreme Court in Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc.,     U.S.    , 134 S. Ct. 2398, 2409-13, 189 L. Ed. 2d 339 (2014). In 
such cases, once the plaintiffs establish that a defendant has made materially false misrepresentations concerning a stock 
traded in an efficient market, they need not show that the misrepresentations had an actual impact on price; rather it becomes 
the defendant's burden to show that they did not. Id. at 2413-14. Such burden-shifting in the securities context is grounded in the 
Supreme Court's appreciation of the substantial public interest served by ensuring effective private remedies for violations of the 
securities laws. See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 245, 108 S. Ct. 978, 99 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1988). There is, of course, a 
similar public interest in ensuring effective private remedies for antitrust plaintiffs. See, e.g. Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 
251, 262, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972) (""Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system 
envisaged by Congress.""); Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 130-31, 89 S. Ct. 1562, 23 L. Ed. 2d 
129 (1969) (""The purpose of giving private parties treble-damage and injunctive remedies was not merely to provide private 
relief, but was to serve as well the high purpose of enforcing the antitrust laws.""). "
734,23," For example, Polar cites some shipments of salmon from Chile for which surcharges were explicitly capped. Polar Opp. 9 
(citing Lane Decl. ¶ 20 (ECF No. 1686)). By the same token, the defendants may seek to argue there were no overcharges on 
particular OD pairs, in certain regions, or in other discrete subsections of the total pool of transactions. This argument should be 
distinguished from the defendants' [*230]  current argument, which appears to be that impact was random and cannot be 
determined by anything other than purely individual inquiries. "
735,24," Tollison also examines some actual evidence of the defendants' anti-competitive behavior. Tollison [*231]  Decl. 23-29. 
Because that section of his testimony goes to the question of a violation rather than impact, it is not considered at this juncture. "
736,25," The defendant Polar contends that Tollison ""admits that the Defendants consist of only, at most, forty percent or fewer of the 
total air cargo carriers."" Polar Mem. 20 (citing Tollison Dep., 47:7-48:25, ECF No. 1685-12). However, a review of the cited 
deposition transcript provides absolutely no basis for this assertion. "
740,26," The defendants' e-mails appear to confirm that the conspiracy was successful. See, e.g., Landau Reply Decl., Ex. 275 
(surcharge constituted 25% of British Airways' profitability); id., Ex. 276 (fuel surcharge ""key to profitability"" for Emirates); id., Ex. 
278 (surcharge improved yields for Polar); id., Ex. 311 (same for Quantas)."
740,27," Specifying values in their logarithmic form is an apparently common practice in econometrics. See McClave Decl. 8 (citing 
Gujarati & Porter, Basic Econometrics 159-62 (McGraw Hill 5th Ed. 2009))."
740,28," The plaintiffs contend that these single-transaction customers constitute approximately one-third of the total putative class. 
See McClave Dep. Tr. 167:13-169:10, Simmons Decl., Ex. 51 (customer model only includes ""roughly 200,000"" customers, and 
does not ""directly address impact to roughly [*255]  one-third of the potential proposed class members."") The defendants in turn "
741,," believe the single-transaction customers constitute two-thirds of the putative class. See, e.g., Oral Arg. Tr. 66:23-24 (Plaintiffs 
""admitted [the customer model] didn't apply to two-thirds of the class."")."
741,29," Although the defendants do not make this argument, the court is aware that the Supreme Court in Dukes rejected the idea of 
using a sample set to determine liability and damages for an entire class. The circumstances in that case are readily 
distinguishable from this one, however. The Court in Dukes declined the Ninth Circuit's suggestion of conducting a ""Trial by 
Formula,"" in which a special master would review claims from a small sample of putative class members in order to determine 
the class's average rate of liability and damages. See 131 S.Ct. at 2561. In that disparate impact case, the Court was informed 
by the plaintiffs' overall failure to demonstrate any common questions that would ""tie[ ] all their 1.5 million claims together."" Id. at 
2555-56. Here, by contrast, the plaintiffs share a single theory of liability—that they were overcharged on their airfreight 
purchases due to a price-fixing conspiracy. Recourse to a sample set [*256]  will therefore not obscure meaningful differences 
between purchasers, as it would have in Dukes. Instead, the use of this ""sample"" has been proposed only to accommodate the 
limited availability of data for the smallest purchasers. Additionally, sampling is only being used for one of the plaintiffs' many 
forms of evidence, and the sample set here is substantially larger than the sample set contemplated in Dukes. See id. at 2541 
(noting that the appellate court had suggested using a ""similar procedure"" as in Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 103 F.3d 767, 782-
787 (9th Cir. 1996), where only one percent of roughly nine thousand claims were reviewed). For these reasons, the court finds 
that nothing in Dukes precludes reliance on the customer model as a form of common proof. "
742,30," See McClave Reply Decl. 47, n.108; McClave Sur-Reply Decl. 7, n.18 (each citing Johnson, Normal L.; Kotz, Samuel, 
Balakrishnan, N., Chapter 14, ""Lognormal Distributions,"" Continuous Univariate Distributions, Vol. 1 (John Wiley & Sons 2nd Ed. 
1994))."
742,31," McClave defines ""statistical significance"" in his declaration. See McClave Decl. 10 n.21. "
743,32," Although the defendants' experts offered multiple opinions attacking the reliability of McClave's global model as proof of 
classwide [*263]  impact, none of the attacks rested on a lack of statistical significance of the results it produced. "

746,35," The problem for the D.C. [*274]  Circuit was that the ""methodology also detects injury where none could exist. When applied 
to shippers who were subject to legacy contracts—i.e., those shippers who, during the Class Period, were bound by rates 
negotiated before any conspiratorial behavior was alleged to have occurred—the damages model yields similar results."" In re 
Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 725 F.3d 244, 252, 406 U.S. App. D.C. 371 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This led the court to 
question whether ""the overcharges the damages model calculates for class members is any more accurate than the obviously 
false estimates it produces for legacy shippers."" Id. at 254. To the D.C. Circuit, this invalidated a model that was ""essential"" to 
the district court's finding of common impact and damages, and therefore merited decertification. Id at 253. "
747,36," Notably, even courts that have refused to endorse the use of an aggregate damages formula have still found class certification 
appropriate regardless. For example, the same week that Blood Reagents was decided, a federal district court in Maryland took 
a much different approach in addressing a plaintiffs' aggregate damages model. The court in that case rejected use of an 
aggregate damages model because ""some level of individual negotiation [*276]  took place . . . regarding rebates, price, non-

not vary greatly if the calculation is inexact. See Amchem, 521 U.S. at 617 (""The policy at the very core of the class action 
mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action

Plaintiff alleges that an E*TRADE customer services representative referred to Plaintiff's puts as ""in the money,"" this statement 
was allegedly made after the expiration date and is cited only in support of Plaintiff's allegation of Defendant's practice with 
regard to the current market [*17]  value of stock during a trading halt. (See SACAC ¶ 22.)"

759,34," In Piemonte, the Clearing Corporation's rules provided that an option holder could exercise the option only by causing his 
broker to file a written exercise notice with the Clearing Corporation on the prescribed form on or before the fixed expiration date. 
(See Piemonte supra, 405 F.Supp. at p. 713.) Notably, the Customer Agreement at issue in the instant matter similarly states 
that ""E*TRADE Securities has no obligation to exercise any option absent specific instructions from me."" (See Customer Agmt. 
at p. 52, Exh. 3 to SACAC.) However, the Courts must also accept Plaintiffs allegation that Defendant promised to automatically 
exercise any options that were ""in the money"" on the expiration date, even if this could be understood to conflict with the 
quoted [*21]  portion of the Customer Agreement. "
760,35," Besides alleging violation of the UCL's fraudulent prong, the SACAC also alleges violation o the unfair prong. However, this 
claim of unfairness is based on ""E*TRADE's misrepresentations."" (See SACAC ¶ 73.) Here, the Court finds no 
misrepresentation to support the claim for unfair business practice."
760,36," At paragraph 22 of the SACAC, Plaintiff alleges that his E*TRADE account showed the value of his puts as $3,900 until the 
day of their expiration, despite the fact that trading was halted. However, there is no allegation of reliance by Plaintiff on what 
was shown on his E*TRADE account, and the allegation is not pled with sufficient particularity. (See Lazar v. Sup. Ct. (Rykoff-
Sexton, Inc.) (1996) 12 Cal. 4th 631, 645 [e.g., how, when, where, to whom and by what means misrepresentations were 
tendered].) Furthermore, any such fraud-based claim would be preempted by SLUSA because it would constitute a 
misrepresentation regarding the value of covered securities that induced Plaintiff [*24]  to take no action on his decision to 
exercise his puts and sell the underlying security."

(Opp. at 319.) If a city manages to work out a good deal when it enters a contract with a service provider, any resulting economic 
gain is for the public good and benefits the public coffers. The phrase ""private economic gain"" has no meaning in this context. "
783,7," TowerCo also argues that plaintiffs have failed to allege any plausible relevant market and the requisite specific intent.

78, 102, 116, 119.) The Court need not accept the SCAC's conclusory, unexplained allegations regarding the alleged 
conspiracy's supposed impact on inter-brand competition. (See SCAC ¶ 143 (""In the absence of the agreements [OTA] 
Defendants and the [Hotel Defendants] would have competed based on room price. The price fixing scheme alleged herein

fact, the few OTA Defendants mentioned in the article are reported to have offered prices varying by as much as $40-80 for 
three of the four U.S.-based hotels observed. See Lisa Kalis, The Hotel Rate Game, Travel & Leisure, June 2003, available at

865,5," ""The term 'concerted action' is often used as shorthand for any form of activity meeting the [S]ection 1 'contract, combination or 
conspiracy' requirement."" Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co., 37 F.3d 996, 999 n.1 (3d Cir. 1994 ). "
866,6," Competing concerns related to discovery play an important role in the evaluation of the factual particularity of pleadings on a 
12(b)(6) motion in an antitrust case. While ""antitrust discovery can be expensive,"" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558, ""dismissals prior to 
giving the plaintiff ample opportunity for discovery should be granted sparingly,"" Hosp. Bldg. Co. v. Trs. of Rex Hosp., 425 U.S. 
738, 746, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976)."
866,7," Although this definition of direct evidence of conspiracy comes from a case discussing the standard for proving a conspiracy on 
summary judgment, see In re Baby Food, 166 F.3d at 118, the standard has been applied in cases involving a motion to dismiss. 
See In re Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 324 n.23; Burtch, 662 F.3d at 225. "
867,8," Allegations of criminal investigations into anticompetitive conduct support the plausibility of antitrust conspiracy. Starr, 592 F.3d 
at 324; In re Blood Reagents Antitrust Litig., 756 F. Supp. 2d 623, 632 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (""Add to this the existence of a parallel 
criminal investigation—an allegation demonstrating that the government believes a crime may have occurred—and the result is 
'enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of an illegal agreement.'"" (quoting Twombly, 
550 U.S. at 556)). "
868,9," As Plaintiffs correctly assert, other courts have not required antitrust plaintiffs to allege a conspiracy connecting all defendants 
in question. See Hinds County v. Wachovia Bank N.A., 700 F. Supp. 2d 378, 394 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (""[F]or pleading purposes, 
plaintiffs are not required to prove the existence of an alleged industry-wide conspiracy."") While not deciding whether such a 
requirement must always be met when a plaintiff asserts a large-scale conspiracy, the Court holds that Plaintiffs, here, have 
alleged ""enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal agreement"" among the 
Defendants. Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556. "
869,10," In Sargent, the district court granted dismissal for the criminal defendants on double jeopardy grounds based on a finding that 
the conspiratorial conduct alleged was part of a single overarching conspiracy and thus defendants could not be found guilty a 
second time for the same conspiracy. See 785 F.2d at 1124-26. There, in both the trial court and on appeal, defendants were 
tasked with proving a single large-scale conspiracy, and the government argued the existence of separate conspiracies. Id. at 
1127-28."
869,11," Crestar Defendants are CCTS, Crestar, and Green, current CEO of Crestar. (FACC ¶¶ 134-35.) According to the allegations of 
the FACC, which the Court must accept as true, CCTS and Crestar are the same entity—""[f]ollowing the Class Period, [CCTS] 
changed its name to [Crestar]."" (Id. ¶ 34.) "
883,1, I assume the truth of plaintiffs' allegations for purposes of these motions.
883,2," For purposes of this case, Korean Noodles are instant noodle soup products made of noodles, seasoning and/or vegetables. 
Korean Noodles are typically sold in a package with seasoning and dehydrated vegetables in a packet, cup or bowl. The 
consumer adds boiling water to the noodles and mixes in any flavor packets to make an instant meal. See DPCC ¶ 1; IPCC ¶ 
44."
883,3," Plaintiffs allege that Paldo Company, Ltd. distributes Korean Noodles in the United States on behalf of Korea Yakult. "
884,4," Seoul Shopping comprises, collectively, Seoul Shopping Inc., Hansfood I Corp., Hansfoods II Corp., and Met Foods. See 
DPCC ¶ 15."
884,5," The indirect purchaser plaintiffs properly seek only an injunction, not damages, in connection with their cause of action for 
violation Section 1 of the Sherman Act. IPCC ¶ 180."
884,6," Defendants state that the ""Indirect Purchaser Plaintiffs assert their antitrust claims under state law because federal antitrust 
law does not permit recovery by indirect purchasers."" Dkt. No. 83 at 4 n.7."
884,7," Indirect purchaser plaintiffs only assert the third and fourth causes of action (state law violations) in the alternative, ""[s]hould 
this Court determine that California law [the Cartwright Act] does not apply to the Class."" IPCC ¶ 193. "
886,8," Paldo Company, Ltd. is a defendant in the indirect purchaser complaint, not in the direct purchaser complaint."
886,9," When discussing the conspiracy, plaintiffs lump the Korean and American entities together, for example referring to 
""Nongshim"" rather than Nongshim Korea or Nongshim America."
886,10," Direct purchaser plaintiffs state that the KFTC Order ""identified witnesses by their last name only, and included the designation 
of 'OO' presumably to mask the identity of certain of the individual participants in the conspiracy."" DPCC ¶ 70 n.4."
886,11," The price correlation charts are attached as Exhibits A-E to their direct purchaser consolidated complaint. Dkt Nos. 61-1 to 61-
5. "
887,12," Defendants contend that the person with the surname ""Lee"" that was mentioned in the KFTC order is not Yong-Hoon Lee. See 
Dkt. No. 112. However, whether Yong-Hoon Lee was mentioned in the KFTC order is not determinative to this order. Rather, as 
noted below, it is the overlapping leadership and control over the two Nongshim entities which renders plaintiffs' allegations that 
Nongshim USA participated in the conspiracy plausible. "
888,13," ""Correlated"" refers to allegations that the price increases in the United States correlated to price increases in Korea. In 
contrast, ""parallel price increases"" refers to allegations that defendants increased prices in parallel, i.e., that Nongshim raised 
prices first and the other defendants followed suit. "
889,14," Plaintiffs allege that defendants participated in a price-fixing conspiracy, which is a per se violation of the Sherman Act. 
Plaintiffs therefore need not establish that defendants intended to fix prices of Korean Noodles in the United States as well as 
those sold in in Korea, as long as the [**25]  noodles were sold in the United States. See, e.g., United States v. Soc'y of Indep. 
Gasoline Marketers of Am., 624 F.2d 461, 465 (4th Cir. 1979) (HN7[
] ""Since in a price-fixing conspiracy the conduct is illegal 
per se, further inquiry on the issues of intent or the anti-competitive effect is not required."")."
889,15," Or, in the case of Nongshim, also manufactured in the United [**26]  States. "
890,16," Defendants assert that plaintiffs' reliance on the KFTC order is misplaced because the KFTC subsequently stated that it 
""determined that exported products [e.g., products shipped to the United States] were not subject to price-fixing...."" Dkt. No. 83 
at 7 (citing request for judicial notice, Dkt. No. 84). The KFTC's subsequent statements are beyond the complaint and not proper 
subjects of judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b). In any event, the statements do not render plaintiffs' 
allegations implausible. Defendants' requests for judicial notice of the KFTC's subsequent statements are DENIED. Dkt. Nos. 84, 
95."
890,17," HN10[
] A defendant who joins a conspiracy is jointly and severally liable for any actions taken in furtherance of the 
conspiracy. See, e.g, In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 820 F. Supp. 2d 1055, 1059 (N.D. Cal. 2011). However, 
plaintiffs must still establish that a defendant is part of the conspiracy in the first instance. "
891,18," Plaintiffs also allege that Nongshim Korea instituted a global ""profitability management information system by product and 
business"" and a ""management infrastructure"" in order to capture a greater share of the $540 [**33]  million United States ramen 
market. DPCC ¶ 187."
891,19," As noted above, plaintiffs allege that Nongshim America is wholly owned by, and under the direction of, Nongshim Korea, that 
Nongshim Korea's vice chairman and co-chief executive officer, Mr. Dong Wong Shin, is also chairman of Nongshim America, 
and that Nongshim Korea's president and co-chief executive officer, Mr. Jun Park, is also director of Nongshim America. DPCC 
¶¶ 19, 20, 21, 73; IPCC ¶¶ 25, 153. The parties dispute whether Mr. Park was identified in the KFTC order. See Dkt. No. 112. 
However, this order does not rely on Mr. Park being identified in the KFTC order."
891,20," Plaintiffs plead both that the Korean Defendants sold the Korean Noodles to direct purchaser plaintiffs in the United States and 
that the Korean Defendants shipped their Korean Noodles to the U.S. Defendants, who then sold the Korean Noodles to the 
direct purchaser [**35]  plaintiffs. Compare DPCC ¶¶ 26, 32, 37 with DPCC ¶¶ 173-74, 178, 182. To the extent that the Korean 
Defendants sold the Korean Noodles to the U.S. Defendants, who in turn sold the Korean Noodles to the direct purchaser 
plaintiffs, direct purchaser plaintiffs would have indirectly purchased the noodles from the Korean Defendants. However, direct 
purchaser plaintiffs would still have standing to sue the Korean Defendants for damages under Section 1 if the U.S. Defendant 
middlemen were controlled or owned by the Korean Defendants. See, e.g., In re ATM Fee Antitrust Litig., 686 F.3d 741, 749 (9th 
Cir. 2012) (HN11[
] ""an indirect purchaser may sue if the direct purchaser is a division or subsidiary of the price-fixing seller"") 
cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 257, 187 L. Ed. 2d 260 (U.S. 2013). "
892,21," As noted above, plaintiffs allege that Ottogi America is under the direction and control of Ottogi Korea because Ottogi Korea 
owns 100% of Ottogi America's stock. DPCC ¶ 29; IPCC ¶ 27."
892,22, Plaintiffs allege that Sam Yang USA sells Samyang Korea's Korean Noodles in the United States. DPCC ¶ 34.
892,23," At oral argument, counsel for Samyang Korea argued that Samyang Korea's inability to control or direct Sam Yang USA's 
activities or any activities in the United [**39]  States means that it could not have participated in the conspiracy to raise prices in 
the United States. But plaintiffs allege that Samyang Korea conspired in Korea to fix prices on Korean Noodles and that it 
imported price-fixed Korean Noodles into the United States. It is accordingly beside the point that Samyang Korea could not 
control the Korean Noodles once they arrived in the United States; plaintiffs allege that the prices had already been fixed at that 
point. As discussed above, whether plaintiffs can prove that that is the case is not presently before me. "
893,24," Plaintiffs allege that an entry on yellowpages.com ""indicates that Sam Yang (USA) is 'a part of Sam Yang Foods Co., LTD who 
manufactures soy sauce products, ice cream and fresh milk.'"" DPCC ¶ 34. Sam Yang USA responds that the entry is incorrect 
and ""now correctly states that 'Sam Yang USA is privately owned and is [**41]  unaffiliated with Samyang Foods Co., Ltd., a 
company based out of South Korea.'"" Dkt. No. 87 at 4 n.6. Plaintiffs filed a statement with additional information about the 
relationship between Samyang Korea and Sam Yang (USA), which defendants dispute. Dkt. No. 110, 113. Plaintiffs have leave 
to add these allegations in an amended complaint. Since the information was not alleged in the complaint, plaintiffs' request to 
submit the additional information (Dkt. No. 110) is DENIED as moot."
893,25," Paldo Company, Ltd. is a defendant in the indirect purchaser plaintiffs' complaint, not in the direct purchaser's complaint. The 
indirect purchaser plaintiffs state a cause of action for violation Section 1 of the Sherman Act, but, as they are indirect 
purchasers, they seek only an injunction, not damages, in connection with that cause of action. IPCC ¶ 180. "
894,26," The various plaintiffs filed their complaints between July and September 2013. Those actions were subsequently consolidated 
into the present direct purchaser and indirect purchaser actions."
894,27," Defendants argue that plaintiffs' state claims are time-barred for the same reasons as the Sherman Act claims. Defendants do 
not dispute that the ""discovery rule"" or fraudulent concealment are available to toll those statutes of limitation. The state law 
claims are therefore tolled for the same reasons as the Sherman Act claims. "
895,28," Defendants' reply brief attaches what defendants purport is a copy of an English-language article published by Korea Daily, 
dated June 11, 2008, ""describing the KFTC's investigation of ramen manufacturers (including some of the Korean Defendants in 
this case) in Korea."" Dkt. No. 94-1, Ex. B. The article is available on Korea Daily's website. Plaintiffs filed an objection to this 
article, arguing that the article is not authenticated [**48]  as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 901, is not accompanied by a 
request for judicial notice, and is not relevant because the court must accept all allegations in the complaint as true. Dkt. No. 99. 
I agree with the substance of plaintiffs' objection and have not incorporated the contents of the article into my decision. However, 
even if the article were properly before me, it lacks sufficient detail to put plaintiffs on notice that they had a cause of action for 
price-fixing. "
896,29," The parties dispute whether the FTAIA is a jurisdictional matter or a substantive issue. HN20[
] The Ninth Circuit addressed 
the issue this year, stating that ""the FTAIA is not a subject-matter jurisdiction limitation on the power of the federal courts but a 
component of the merits of a Sherman Act claim involving nonimport trade or commerce with foreign nations."" United States v. 
Hui Hsiung, 758 F.3d 1074, 1087 (9th Cir. 2014)."
896,30," HN21[
] The Supreme Court also explained that the FTAIA ""make[s] clear to American exporters (and to firms doing 
business abroad) that the Sherman Act does not prevent them from entering into business arrangements (say, joint-selling 
arrangements), however anticompetitive, as long as those arrangements adversely affect only foreign markets."" F. Hoffmann-La 
Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 161, 124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226 (2004). The Ninth Circuit has also sought 
to distill the meaning of the FTAIA, stating that: Although the statute is a web of words, it boils down to two principles. First, the Sherman Act applies to ""import trade or 
import commerce"" with foreign nations. [**52]  Put differently, the FTAIA does not alter the Sherman Act's coverage of 
import trade; import trade is excluded from the FTAIA altogether. Second, under the FTAIA, the Sherman Act does not 
apply to nonimport trade or commerce with foreign nations, unless the domestic effects exception is met. United States v. Hui Hsiung, 758 F.3d 1074, 1086 (9th Cir. 2014) "
897,31," As stated above, plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a conspiracy to fix prices of Korean Noodles sold in the United States with 
respect to defendants Nongshim Korea, Nongshim USA, Ottogi Korea, Ottogi USA, and Samyang Korea."
897,32," Plaintiffs also allege that the U.S. Defendants distributed Korean Noodles, manufactured in Korea, across the United States on 
behalf of the Korean Defendants. See DPCC ¶¶ 30, 34, 37, IPCC ¶ 28. But to the extent that the commerce at issue is directly 
between plaintiffs and the U.S. Defendants, then the commerce is not ""with foreign nations"" and the FTAIA would not apply in 
the first instance. 15 U.S.C. § 6a."
897,33," HN23[
] Import activity is not covered by the FTAIA, whether or not the import activity satisfies the exception in subsections (1) and (2). See, e.g., United States v. Hui Hsiung, 758 F.3d 1074, 1090 (9th Cir. 2014) (""Under its plain terms, the FTAIA does 
not [**54]  affect import trade.""); Dee-K Enters., Inc. v.Heveafil Sdn. Bhd., 299 F.3d 281, 285-86 (4th Cir. 2002) (""Because this 
case involves importation of foreign-made goods . . . the FTAIA standard obviously does not directly govern this case.""). The 
exception is only relevant if the trade or commerce with foreign nations at issue is something ""other than import trade or import 
commerce."""
897,34," For purposes of this motion, and because it does not affect my determination, I accept defendants' position [**56]  that the 
conduct at issue must ""adversely affect"" import commerce to fall within the import exclusion to the FTAIA. However, I am not 
convinced that this is a correct statement of the law. By its own terms, the FTAIA does not apply to ""import trade or import 
commerce."" 15 U.S.C. § 6a. As the Supreme Court explains, the FTAIA ""lays down a general rule placing all (nonimport) activity 
involving foreign commerce outside the Sherman Act's reach."" F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 162, 
124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226 (2004) (emphasis added). The FTAIA accordingly has no impact on import commerce, "
898,," whether or not the import commerce has an ""adverse"" effect. See, e.g., Hsiung, 758 F.3d at 1086 (""import trade is excluded from 
the FTAIA altogether""). Simply put, the FTAIA does not apply to import commerce. But just because the FTAIA does not apply, 
that does not mean that plaintiffs have stated a claim: plaintiffs must still adequately allege the elements of their underlying 
Sherman Act claims to withstand a motion to dismiss. The sufficiency of plaintiffs' price-fixing conspiracy allegations are 
addressed above."
898,35," The indirect purchaser plaintiffs assert claims under the laws of the following states in which no named plaintiff resides or 
purchased the noodles: Arkansas, Arizona, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin. IPCC ¶¶ 192-215."
898,36," Plaintiffs cite only one case from within the Ninth Circuit, In re Hydroxycut Marketing and Sales Practices Litig., 801 F. Supp. 
2d 993 (S.D. Cal. 2011), in support of [**59]  their argument that the Court should defer ruling on the standing issue until the 
class certification stage. Hydroxycut has subsequently been criticized for ignoring controlling precedent. See Morales v. Unilever 
U.S., Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 49336, 2014 WL 1389613, *5 n.5 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 9, 2014) (""Hydroxycut' s suggestion that 
courts should defer questions of standing for class certification is inconsistent with controlling Ninth Circuit precedent.""). I 
likewise find Hydroxycut inconsistent with controlling precedent. "
899,37," Except for the claim under New York's Deceptive Acts and Practices Act, which is addressed below. "
900,38," Plaintiffs cite In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., 527 F. Supp. 2d 1011 (N.D. Cal. 2007) and In re TFT —LCD (Flat 
Panel) Antitrust Litig., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 110635, 2011 WL 4501223 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 28, 2011), in which the Court denied 
motions to dismiss or for summary judgment on Section 349 claims based on price-fixing allegations. However, in those cases 
the Court apparently found that the defendants' deceptive acts caused the plaintiffs' injury. That is not the case here. In addition, 
those decisions did not address Lorillard Tobacco, in which New York's highest court held that deception in itself does not 
constitute an injury under Section 349. See Lorillard Tobacco, 94 N.Y.2d at 56; In re Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litig., 
851 F. Supp. 2d 867, 909 (E.D. Pa. 2012) (citing Lorillard Tobacco and dismissing Section 349 claim where the complaint ""does 
not plausibly suggest that the purported pretextual explanations for the rising egg prices are the actual cause of the Plaintiffs' 
alleged harm of paying artificially-inflated prices for eggs.""). As Judge Wilken explained in rejecting a Section 349 [**65]  claim, 
""price fixing by manufacturers, without more, does not have a deceptive impact on consumers and IP Plaintiffs have not 
produced evidence that the allegedly inflated prices materially misled consumers."" In re Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) 
Antitrust Litig., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 131002, 2010 WL 5094289, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 8, 2010). "
902,39," Lipov is a federal case, but it cites W.C. Ducomb Co., Inc. v. Ann Arbor Mach. Co., 2012 Mich. App. LEXIS 278, 2012 WL 
516089, at *3 (Mich. Ct. App. Feb.16, 2012), for the [**71]  proposition that an unjust enrichment claim cannot lie where any 
benefit to the defendant came from a third-party. See W.C. Ducomb, 2012 Mich. App. LEXIS 278, 2012 WL 516089, at *3 
(""Assuming that retaining the money from Chrysler was a benefit, it is undisputed that those funds came from Chrysler, not 
plaintiff. Accordingly, plaintiff cannot establish the first element of unjust enrichment.""). The facts of W.C. Ducomb are not 
analogous to those alleged here. W.C. Ducomb is nonetheless helpful for its holding that benefits conferred by a third party 
cannot support a claim for unjust enrichment."
902,40," The claims are set [**72]  forth in A & M Supply Co. v. Microsoft Corp., 252 Mich. App. 580, 654 N.W.2d 572 (2002). "
904,41," Defendants also cite Georgia Malone & Co., Inc. v. Rieder, 19 N.Y.3d 511, 973 N.E.2d 743, 950 N.Y.S.2d 333 (N.Y. 2012), in 
which New York's highest [**76]  court reaffirmed the rule that an unlawful enrichment claim cannot lie where the relationship 
between the parties is too attenuated. However, Georgia Malone did not involve indirect purchasers or price-fixing claims and 
therefore does not shed light on whether the relationship between the parties is too attenuated in this case. Mandarin Trading 
Ltd. v. Wildenstein, 16 N.Y.3d 173, 944 N.E.2d 1104, 919 N.Y.S.2d 465 (N.Y. 2011), also cited by defendants, is likewise 
inapposite and not instructive here."
904,42," The minimal discussion in Cox makes it difficult to analogize the facts there to those present here and in Sperry and Daicel. 
However, it appears that the products at issue in Cox—Microsoft's operating systems—were incorporated into computers which 
were purchased by the [**78]  plaintiffs. See, e.g., Cox, 8 A.D.3d at 41 (noting that Microsoft's ""prime customers"" were computer 
manufacturers and distributors, not the plaintiffs). Accordingly, like in Sperry and Daicel, the price-fixed product was merely an 
ingredient of the larger product—computers—purchased by the plaintiffs, rendering the manner in which Waldman distinguished 
Cox from Sperry and Daicel questionable. "
905,43," Plaintiffs allege a cause of action under New York's Donnelly Act, N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law § 340, which is distinct from the New 
York Deceptive Acts and Practices Act. Defendants seek to dismiss the Donnelly Act claim only on the grounds that it is time-
barred. I reject that argument as discussed above. "
911,1," The other elements require a defendant who is a commercial competitor of the plaintiff, commercial speech made for the

they ""told current and potential AccuImage customers that, among other things, AccuImage's products are not FDA 
approved when, in fact, they are."" Plaintiff also alleges that Taylor ""made false and misleading representations . . . to actual 
and potential AccuImage customers around the country to persuade them to purchase TeraRecon's . . . products."" The 
complaint does not, however, allege any facts regarding the location, timing, or content of Taylor's allegedly false 
statements. The rest of the false advertising allegations in the complaint simply mimic the elements of the cause of action 
and do [*38]  not plead sufficient facts. . . . Therefore, the court grants Taylor's motion to dismiss claim one with leave to 
amend.The court also finds that TeraRecon does not have sufficient notice of the corporation's allegedly actionable conduct 
under this claim. Plaintiff uses the language of the statute to plead this cause of action but does not provide sufficient 
factual information about TeraRecon's actionable conduct aside from the allegation that they misrepresented whether or not 
AccuImage's product was FDA approved. . . . As stated above, plaintiff must make more detailed allegations to satisfy the 
elements of the cause of action, such as: the circumstances under which TeraRecon made false statements, how the 
statements entered interstate commerce, and how plaintiff has been or is likely to be damaged as a result of defendants' 
false statements."

946,1," The jury found BD's 1 mL and 3 mL Integra syringes infringe various claims of RTI's patents. The United States Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit partially reversed, holding the 3 mL Integra syringe did not infringe any claim. Retractable Techs., 
Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 653 F.3d 1296, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2011). However, the Federal Circuit [*6]  affirmed this Court's

Retractable Techs., Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson & Co., 757 F.3d 1366, 1372-73 (Fed. Cir.)."
946,2," RTI apparently made a math error by claiming BD's profits are ""about $275 million."" RTI subtracts the damages award of 
$113,508,014 from BD's combined safety syringe and conventional syringe profits of $374,186,588 and should arrive at 
$260,678,574—not ""about $275 million."" BD pointed this error out in its response brief. RTI did not respond in its reply brief, 
ostensibly agreeing that RTI actually requests $260,678,574 in profits rather than ""about $275 million."" "
947,3," BD argues this cannot be the ""view of the law"" because ""if RTI could prove $100 in attributable profits, it would be entitled to 
$260 million."" Docket No. 618 at 10. Aside from the reality that $100 in view of $260 million would be a de minimus amount, BD's 
hypothetical omits a critical step. If RTI proves only $100 in attributable profits, that does not mean RTI is entitled to $260 
million—it only means that the Court may then apply the principles of equity analyzed in light of the Pebble Beach factors. See 
Pebble Beach Co,. v. Tour 18 I Ltd., 155 F.3d 526, 554 (5th Cir. 1998). One of those factors is diversion. Without some 
countervailing reason, it would not be equitable to award $260 million in profits if RTI could only show $100 profits (or less) from 
diverted sales. "
948,4," BD argues that RTI's disgorgement and injunction claims are barred by laches because RTI asserted these claims beyond the 
relevant statute of limitations, which BD argues is two years. Docket No. 604 at 13. According to BD, each element of laches is 
strongly presumed because RTI filed suit beyond the relevant statute of limitations. Id. In response, RTI argues the relevant 
statute of limitations provides a four-year period. Docket No. 612 at 14. However, the Court need not identify the relevant statute 
of limitations [*15]  period in this case because the Fifth Circuit does not presume the elements of laches based on a statute of 
limitations. See Jaso v. Coca Cola Co., 435 Fed. App'x 346, 356 & n.10 (5th Cir. 2011) (noting the Fifth Circuit does not apply 
same presumption as other circuits and requires the defendant to prove each element of laches). Accordingly, to assert laches 
as a defense, BD must prove (1) a delay in asserting a right or claim; (2) that the delay was inexcusable; and (3) that undue 
prejudice resulted from the delay. Id. at 356. Because BD cannot show undue prejudice, see infra text accompanying note 5, 
BD's defense of laches fails. "
949,5," For the same reasons, the Court rejects BD's argument that disgorgement and injunctive relief are barred by laches. See 
Docket No. 618 at 12-15. "
951,6," BD's proposal regarding its waste space claims suffers from the same problem. BD wants to make medication and cost-savings 
comparisons as long as it represents that RTI's VanishPoint waste space is 0.07 mL. Docket No. 605 at 4. If adopted, such an 
injunction would still allow BD to manipulate the comparisons by falsely stating the waste space of its own products, or by failing 
to update the comparisons if RTI reduces the waste space of its VanishPoint in the future. "

[procompetitive] arguments, they are intrinsically factual . . . and inappropriate for resolution at the motion to dismiss stage"")."
989,17," At oral argument, defendants argued that the fact that Watson maintained the supracompetitive price was irrelevant because 
antitrust analysis focuses on the number of competitors in a market. However, plaintiffs make a different point. Plaintiffs allege 
that the provision of $96 million of brand product was a large and unjustified payment made in order to keep Watson's own, 
lower cost generic, out of the market until September 15, 2013. Regardless, both of plaintiffs' theories — delayed entry of 
generic lidocaine patches and Watson's sale of brand name product at supracompetitive prices — plausibly allege that the 
provision of brand product was harmful to competition. "
990,18," At oral argument, defendants argued that the settlement required Endo/Teikoku to give Watson free Lidoderm in 2013, and 
then to continue giving brand product in 2014 and 2015 or until the FDA approved Watson's ANDA. See Request for Judicial 
Notice Ex. A at 10. They assert this demonstrates that Endo/Teikoku's intent was to allow Watson to enter the market before 
FDA approval (even if the FDA delayed approval of Watson's generic through 2015) rather than to compensate Watson for 
delaying release of its generic until September 15, 2013. I do not find this argument persuasive for three reasons. First, the 2013 
term is different than the 2014 and 2015 terms because it is not contingent on FDA approval of Watson's ANDA. Second, the 
size of the payment suggests that this justification is not [**54]  plausible. Third, the settlement states that the parties intent 
regarding the "" rand Product provided by Endo/Teikoku to Watson's Wholesaler Affiliate hereunder is a good-faith bargained-for 
resolution of the claims at issue in the Litigation,"" not to allow Watson to enter the market despite FDA approval. DPP Compl. ¶ 
97."
990,19," This conclusion is in accordance with the FTC, which has taken the position that free brand product, when given in exchange 
for an agreement to delay a generic, can allow a brand-name manufacturer to share its monopoly profits. See In re Lamictal, 
Case No. 14-1243 (3rd Cir. April 28, 2014), 2014 WL 1745072, at *17-18 (quoting Brief of F.T.C. as Amicus Curaie[sic] in 
support of Plaintiffs-Appellants, ""whether such sharing takes the form of gold bullion, stocks, free goods, real estate, or--as here-
-an additional agreement not to compete, the potential for harm to consumers is present. In any event, a settlement with a No-
AG commitment can [**55]  violate the antitrust laws whether it is characterized as a reverse payment (in kind rather than in 
cash) or instead as a reciprocal agreement not to compete."")."
990,20," At least one court has found that a six month no-authorized-generic [**56]  agreement was not anticompetitive under the rule 
of reason test. See, e.g., In re Lamictal, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9257, 2014 WL 282755, at *10 (""six months of early entry, that 
there was no payment of money[,] and that the duration of the No—AG Agreement was a relatively brief six months all serve to 
persuade this Court that the settlement was reasonable and not anticompetitive as forbidden by Actavis.""). Even though the 
agreement in that case was not found to be anticompetitive, the court did not hold that it had procompetitive benefits, as 
defendants argue, and as a pure early-entry settlement would. "
991,21," At oral argument, defendants [**58]  urged me to follow Judge Sheridan's analysis in In re Lipitor. In that case, the alleged 
non-monetary payments were ""(i) the forfeiture of Pfizer's claim for damages in the Accupril II litigation in exchange for 
Ranbaxy's payment of $1 million; and (ii) foreign patent litigation settlements permitting Ranbaxy to launch generic Lipitor in at 
least eleven non-U.S. markets prior to patent expiration."" In re Lipitor, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127877, 2014 WL 4543502, at *19. 
On the motion to dismiss, the court concluded that the focus of Actavis is ""on the antitrust intent of the settling parties rather than 
the manner of payment,"" and so rejected defendants' argument that reverse payments must be cash. However, the judge 
dismissed the complaints because they failed to meet the Twombly standard and allege facts sufficient to establish the value of 
the forfeited claims for damages. 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127877, [WL] at *19, *21; see also In re Effexor XR, 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 142206, 2014 WL 4988410, at *22 (granting motion to dismiss because plaintiffs failed to allege sufficient facts to value 
the no-authorized-generic). Here, plaintiffs have adequately and plausibly alleged the value of both the no-authorized-generic 
agreement and the $96 million worth of brand-name Lidoderm."

992,23," In re Lamictal, the only post-Actavis case defendants cite on this point, does not analyze whether a license can be a payment. 
Rather, it reiterates the fact that Actavis only mentions ""monetary payments,"" and categorically declines to ""extend the holding of 
Actavis to the non-monetary facts before it."" In re Lamictal, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9257, 2014 WL 282755, at *9. I do not find 
this case persuasive for the reasons discussed above."
992,24," The specific and plausible valuations provided in the complaints distinguishes this case from In re Effexor, where the district 
court agreed that non-cash payments could [**63]  constitute reverse payments under Actavis but held that the pleadings in that 
case did not provide sufficient, plausible allegations to make those valuations. In re Effexor XR, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142206, 
2014 WL 4988410, at *23. "
993,25," Plaintiffs allege that Judge Sleet had ""rejected Endo's claim construction position, strengthening Watson's defense to 
Endo/Teikoku's infringement claims,"" and that the ""evidence at trial was overwhelmingly in favor of Watson."" DPP Compl. ¶ 79. 
Specifically, they [**67]  allege that Judge Sleet had indicated that the '529 patent only covered products containing ""one and 
only one"" substance from two different categories, while ""Watson's generic Lidoderm product contained at least four water-
soluble high-molecular-weight substances, and three water-retaining agents."" Id. at ¶¶ 87-88 (emphasis in original). "
994,26," At oral argument, defendants contended [**68]  that the timeline demonstrated that Watson would not have entered the 
market before September 15, 2013 without the settlement. Their presentation focused on three distinct hurdles: the patents, the 
patent litigation, and the FDA proceedings. The first-expiring patent expired in 2014, and the last expired more than two years 
later. DPP Compl. ¶ 94. The litigation could have continued for many years because Endo/Teikoku could have appealed any 
decision, and the second case had just begun. Similarly, the Citizen Petition had been pending for six years. Plaintiffs respond 
that they are not relying as a theory of injury on the argument that Watson would have prevailed in the patent litigation and 
entered the market without encumbrance before September 15, 2013. Thus defendants' arguments that plaintiffs must prove 
that Watson would have prevailed in the litigation or surmounted all three hurdles are inapposite. Reply 8. The three barriers 
identified by defendants do not undermine the theories of injury asserted by plaintiffs for the reasons discussed below."
994,27," Defendants request that I take judicial notice of three Watson earnings calls because they are public documents and were 
incorporated by reference in the complaints. Defendants' equest for Judicial Notice [Dkt. 92]. Plaintiffs object to this request on 
the grounds that the contents of the earning calls are not central to their claim. Plaintiffs' Opposition to Defendants' equest for 
Judicial Notice [Dkt. 104]. HN16[
] The ""incorporation by reference"" doctrine applies to situations in which the plaintiff's claim 
depends on the contents of a document. Knievel v. ESPN, 393 F.3d 1068, 1076 (9th Cir. 2005). Despite plaintiff's 
arguments [**71]  to the contrary, Watson's willingness to launch immediately after the FDA approved the ANDA, regardless of 
the ongoing litigation, is a crucial factor in one of the plaintiff's primary theories of injury and in support, plaintiffs rely on the 
contents of the calls. For this purpose, the request is GRANTED."
994,28," Watson's concerns about the Citizen Petition are not relevant when considering whether Watson would have launched at-risk 
because an at-risk launch cannot occur until the regulatory hurdles are cleared. As discussed above, plaintiffs have plausibly 
alleged that the regulatory hurdles (including the Citizen Petition and the ANDA) would have been and were cleared on August 
23, 2012."

1000,37," In re Skelaxin (Metaxalone) Antitrust Litig., 299 F.R.D. 555, 565 (E.D. Tenn. 2014), relied on by defendants in reply, is a class 
certification decision that addressed the apparent [**90]  difficulties of creating damage models based upon the complex 
operations of the health plan plaintiffs. That decision is not relevant to the specificity required for standing at the pleading stage. 
The defendants other cases are likewise inapposite. In In re K-Dur, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 121946, 2008 WL 2660783, at *5 the 
court was not addressing standing, but choice of law. The court concluded for that distinct analysis, the ""state with the greatest 
interest in a TPP's claims brought on its own behalf is the state where the TPP has its principal place of business and from which 
it presumably paid the allegedly supracompetitive prices.""); see also In re Rezulin Prods. Liab. Litig., 392 F. Supp. 2d 597, 611 
(S.D.N.Y. 2005) (choice of law). Finally, In re Ditropan XL Antitrust Litig., 529 F. Supp. 2d 1098 (N.D. Cal. 2007) is not to the 
contrary. There, defendants moved to dismiss arguing that IPPs lacked standing because they failed to allege that they either 
resided in or purchased product in 24 states. The plaintiffs opposed based only on the argument that standing should be 
determined at class certification. The district court disagreed and dismissed state law claims as a result. Id. at 1106-07. "
1001,38," GEHA has also voluntarily withdrawn the following claims: (i) antitrust, monopolization and unjust enrichment claims under the

1001,39," Defendants contend that GEHA cannot bring antitrust claims under Missouri law; an argument GEHA does not dispute. Mot. 
31."
1001,40," The In re Actimmune Mktg. Litig. court relied on In re Express Scripts, Inc., Pharmacy Ben. Mgmt. Litig., Case No. 1672, 2006 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65168, 2006 WL 2632328, at *10 (E.D.Mo. Sept.13, 2006) (dismissing claim [**94]  of health benefit plan 
against prescription drug administrator because the pharmaceuticals purchased by the plan were not ""for the Plan's personal, 
family, or household purposes. Instead, they were purchased for a business purpose to serve the Plan's clients.""). "
1002,41," GEHA also relies generally on a case from this District interpreting the Michigan consumer protection statute that — unlike 
Missouri's — does not contain language that ""require[s] a transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant that involves the 
sale of goods primarily for personal, family or household purposes; rather, it requires only that the plaintiff's damages arise from 
defendant's provision of such goods. In other words, the statute does not require the plaintiff to be the consumer who purchased 
the goods primarily for personal purposes."" In re Bextra & Celebrex Mktg. Sales Practices & Prod. Liab. Litig., Case No. 05-1699 
CRB, 495 F. Supp. 2d 1027, 1033 (N.D. Cal. 2007); see also MCLS § 445.902(g) (""'Trade or commerce' means the conduct of a 
business providing goods, property, or service primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.""). The Bextra case, 
therefore, is inapposite. In Pa. Emple. Benefit Trust Fund v. Zeneca, Inc., 710 F. Supp. 2d 458 (D. Del. 2010), the court also 
interpreted the Michigan consumer protection statute. The court explained that with respect to a third party payor health plan 
(like GEHA), the question under Michigan law was whether the ""role as a third party payor ('TPP') rendered it a 'mere conduit or 
intermediary' for its participants' use of Nexium or whether it purchased [**96]  Nexium principally to engage in its own 
commercial enterprise."" because the complaint lacked sufficient facts to explain how the TPP operated, the court could not make 
that determination and dismissed the Michigan consumer protection claim. Id. at 484."
1002,42," Because the claims have been dismissed with leave to amend, I need not reach whether GEHA has stated claims under the 
consumer protection statutes of other states' laws. See Mot. 34-41."
1002,43," Defendants also challenged the EPPs antitrust claims under Florida law, but the EPPs voluntarily withdrew their Florida 
antitrust claims in their Opposition. Oppo. 31, n.80. It is DISMISSED with prejudice. [**97] "
1003,44," For this reason, I decline to follow In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litig., No. 13-MD-2420 YGR, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
141358, 2014 WL 4955377, at *21 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 2, 2014) which relied on Freund v. Nycomed Amersham, 347 F.3d 752, 761-
62 (9th Cir. 2003). The provision at issue in Freund was the conflict between Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 50 (requiring parties to make a 
Rule 50(a) motion pre-verdict to preserve the right to argue a Rule 50(b) motion post-trial) and a California rule providing that the 
appealability of punitive damage awards is not waivable. The Ninth Circuit held that the district court erred in allowing California 
law to trump ule 50, because ""the federal rule must be applied if it does not 'abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right' in 
violation of the Rules Enabling Act,"" and the California non-waiver provision was a procedural rule, ""not a substantive rule that 
would be modified by the application of the federal rule."" Id. at 761. As discussed above, I consider the no non-Attorney General 
class action rule enacted as part of the Illinois [**100]  Antitrust Act to be substantive and intertwined with the creation of the 
substantive right of indirect purchasers to sue."
1003,45," In Illinois Brick, the Supreme Court held that indirect purchasers of goods produced by firms engaged in anticompetitive 
conduct were too remote from that conduct to be regarded as injured within the meaning of the Clayton Act. 431 U.S. at 746-48. 
A number of states have passed state laws known as Illinois Brick-repealers which specifically grant end-payors the right to sue 
for antitrust violations, the validity of which was upheld by Supreme Court in California v. ARC America Corp., 490 U.S. 93, 109 
S. Ct. 1661, 104 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1989). "
1004,46," The EPPs argue that indirect purchasers can bring antitrust under § 9. Ciardi v. F. Hoffmann La Roche, Ltd., 436 Mass. 53, 
55, 762 N.E.2d 303 (2002). That may be, but Providence and the Iron Workers are engaged in trade and commerce and 
covered by § 11. "
1005,47," Defendants also argue that plaintiffs' complaint failed to allege fraud and deception under § 11. See Reply 26. However, there 
is no fraud or deception claim alleged in the EPPs Complaint, therefore, the Court need not reach this argument."
1005,48," The same district court rejected a request to certify the question of whether indirect purchasers have standing to the Puerto ico 
Supreme Court, finding that because ""the Puerto ico Supreme Court has unequivocally rejected limitations to private 
antitrust [**106]  standing under PRAA, this court must deny Defendants' motion for certification."" Rivera-Muniz v. Horizon Lines 
Inc., Case No. 09-CV-2081, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 95495, 2010 WL 3703737, at *1 (D.P.R. Sept. 13, 2010). "
1007,49," Plaintiffs also rely on In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., 851 F. Supp. 2d 867, 914-36 (E.D. Pa. 2012) to argue that 
even if defendants' argument is well-taken, defendants had to prove on a state-by-state basis that each of the 24 jurisdictions 
would preclude an unjust enrichment claim. Oppo. 38-39, n.108. The court in In re Processed Egg Prods., in the twenty page 
discussion cited by the EPPs, addressed the sufficiency of claims under various state unjust enrichment common law standards. 
The only discussion of Illinois Brick and unjust enrichment focused on one state, Utah. Moreover, the EPPs provide no authority 
from any of the 24 specifically identified jurisdictions showing that any of them would allow unjust enrichment claims stemming 
from indirect antitrust injury when plaintiffs are precluded from bringing indirect claims. "
1008,50," Defendants challenge the unjust enrichment claims for following ""benefit of the bargain"" jurisdictions: Arizona, Arkansas, 
California, the District [**116]  of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and 
Utah. Defendants argue that courts in these jurisdictions ""reject unjust enrichment claims when 'parties voluntarily have 
negotiated, entered into and fully performed their bargain.'"" Mot. 43 (quoting In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Exp. Antitrust 
Litig., 350 F. Supp. 2d at 210)."

1012,2," The Court GRANTS Defendant's unopposed request for judicial notice of Apple's iOS 5, 5.1, 6, and 7 License Agreements and 
takes judicial notice of the adjudicative facts contained therein. The contents of these documents are necessarily implicated by 
Plaintiffs' Complaint and neither party contests the authenticity of the documents. See Fed. R. Evid. 201; Rubio v. Capital One

Galbraith v. Cnty. of Santa Clara , 307 F.3d 1119 (9th Cir. 2002). "
1016,3," Defendant also cites Hall v. Earthlink Network, Inc., 396 F.3d 500, 502 (2d Cir. 2005), in support of its contention that any 
interception would fall within the ""ordinary course of business"" exception. In Hall, the plaintiff alleged Earthlink had wrongfully 
intercepted emails sent to his cancelled email address because Earthlink had stored those emails rather than ""bouncing back"" 
the emails to the senders. Hall had proceeded to the summary judgment stage, and Earthlink offered evidence that it lacked the 
technical ability to ""bounce back"" emails and that storing such emails was an ordinary business practice. Id. The Hall plaintiff 
offered no evidence to the contrary, and the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment. Id. In 
addition to the differing procedural posture of this case, Defendant has offered no evidence that it lacks the ability to unregister 
Plaintiffs from its iMessage registry or otherwise prevent the automatic interception of messages."
1016,4," The Court notes that Defendant's selective quotation of the legislative history omits the Senate Report's further adoption of 
language from a prior Judiciary Committee Report that ""[t]he term 'intentional' is not meant to connote the existence of a motive. 
Liability for intentionally engaging in prohibited conduct is not dependent on an assessment of the merit of the motive that led the 
person to disregard the law."" S. Rep. 99-541, at 23-24 (1986). Plaintiffs need not allege that Apple had an improper motive, only 
that Apple intentionally intercepted their messages. "
1017,5," Apple attaches software license agreements for iOS 5, iOS 5.1, iOS 6, and iOS 7. See Boule Decl., Exhs. A—D. The relevant 
language regarding iMessages is the same across all of the license agreements. "
1018,6," The only difference is that 18 U.S.C. § 2707(e)(3) reads ""a good faith determination that section 2511(3) of this title 
permitted [**27]  the conduct complained of . . . ."" "
1019,7," A plaintiff who has standing under the UCL's ""lost money or property"" requirement will have suffered the requisite ""damage"" for 
purposes of establishing CLRA standing. Hinojos v. Kohl's Corp., 718 F.3d 1098, 1108 (9th Cir. 2013). "
1020,8," Plaintiffs cite Fireside Bank v. Superior Court, 40 Cal. 4th 1069, 56 Cal. Rptr. 3d 861, 155 P.3d 268 (2007), for their claim that 
""an out of pocket payment of funds is not a prerequisite to a claim for injunctive or declaratory relief."" Opp. at 19. The Fireside 
Bank Court did not address standing under the UCL or CLRA and neither the claims nor factual allegations of that case bear any 
relation to the issues at stake here."
1020,9," The California Courts of Appeal are split on the scope of the duty to disclose in CLRA and UCL omissions and fraudulent 
concealment claims. Compare Collins v. eMachines, Inc., 202 Cal. App. 4th 249, 134 Cal. Rptr. 3d 588 (Cal Ct. App. 2011) 
(applying four factors from Limandri v. Judkins, 52 Cal. App. 4th 326, 60 Cal. Rptr. 2d 539 (Cal. Ct. App. 1997)), with Buller v. 
Sutter Health, 160 Cal. App. 4th 981, 74 Cal. Rptr. 3d 47, 52 n.3 (Cal. Ct. App. 2008) (""respectfully disagree[ing]"" with the 
application of the Judkins factors to UCL and CLRA omission claims to the extent that they compel a duty to disclose). 
Defendant cites Wilson v. Hewlett-Packard Co., 668 F.3d 1136 (9th Cir. 2012), but does not discuss the Ninth Circuit's analysis "
1021,," of Falk v. Gen. Motors Corp., 496 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (N.D. Cal. 2007), and other cases applying the Limandri factors where the 
plaintiffs alleged affirmative misrepresentations or the CLRA and UCL claims implicated services. The Court does not reach the 
question of whether the Limandri factors are properly applied here because the Court concludes that even if they did apply, 
Plaintiffs have failed to adequately allege a duty to disclose."
1021,10," The ""proper definition of 'unfair' conduct against consumers is 'currently in flux' among California courts,"" and some appellate 
opinions have applied a more stringent test, particularly for conduct that threatens an incipient violation of antitrust law. Davis v.

1060,9," Specifically, SecurityMetrics alleges: For PCI Standard compliance validation purposes, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover each divide merchants into four levels; 
American Express divides them into three; and JCB divides them into two. Following the classifications used by Visa and 
MasterCard, the lowest-volume merchants are commonly referred to as ""Level 4 merchants."" Def.'s Countercl. ¶ 30. The Court adopts this terminology herein."
1060,10," These PCI compliance service vendors include Approved Scanning Vendors (""ASVs""), Qualified Security Assessors (""QSAs""), 
Payment Application Qualified Security Assessors (""PA-QSAs""), PCI Forensic Investigators (""PFIs""), and Point-to-Point 
Encryption assessors (""P2PEs""). "
1061,11," Specifically, First Data sought to force SecurityMetrics to format its security compliance reports in the same manner that it had 
during the parties' contractual relationship. SecurityMetrics ceased using that type of reporting [*11]  after First Data terminated 
the contract."
1061,12," The Terms of Settlement is a one page document, reading in relevant part: First Data Merchant Services (""FD"") and SecurityMetrics, Inc. (""SM"") agree to the following essential terms of settlement: • The parties shall incorporate these terms of settlement in a final settlement agreement, in a form and with content 
mutually acceptable to both parties, [REDACTED]. • [REDACTED] • The parties shall keep confidential the terms of this settlement and those facts and circumstances forming the basis

other from any and all obligations and claims, known or unknown. Def.'s Countcl. Ex. F, ECF No. 157-6. "
1063,13," Notably, First Data's expert Dr. Gary T. Ford, criticized the report for failure to use a control. See Mem. Supp. MIL #1, at 8 
(citing Rebuttal of ""Expert Report of Michael Belch, Ph.D.,"" Mem. Supp. MIL #1 Ex. F). Moreover, Dr. Belch himself 
acknowledged that he was not ""sure that [he] attempted to or even opined that it was the use of the word 'PCI' in 'PCI Rapid 
Comply' that led to my opinion"" and he further suggested that if he ""was trying to parcel out specifically the effects of PCI, then 
[he] would probably have done an experiment."" Reply MIL #1 (citing Belch Depo., MIL #1 Ex E at 108:8-14)."
1063,14," Instead, SecurityMetrics points to a 2005 survey conducted by First Data's survey expert performed on behalf of the ABA 
Section of Science & Technology [*18]  Law. That survey was designed to ""ascertain corporate counsel's opinions about recent 
trends in data management, electronic discovery and the proposed changes in the Federal Rules."" Resp. MIL #1, at 7. Of 
course, this survey was not designed to be evidence in a lawsuit. Moreover, the survey clearly intended to gather information—in 
other words, it sought to collect comments and feedback. Thus, the purpose of that survey is clearly distinguishable from the one 
before the Court, where SecurityMetrics seeks to test the effect that a certain term has in the eyes of merchants. "
1064,15," In the mid-nineties, First Data purchased Card Establishment Services, a merchant credit card processor allied with Wells 
Fargo Bank. ""This transaction established First Data and Wells Fargo as partners and jump started First Data's successful 
program of establishing joint-venture merchant-acquiring businesses with bank partners."" Response MIL #2 15 (quoting Kjos at 
12-14)."
1064,16," First Data suggests that this [*23]  testimony should be excluded because the expert testimony of an economist is necessary 
to adequately prove the types of antitrust claims raised by SecurityMetrics. While this Court finds Philbin is sufficiently qualified "
1065,," to testify on the issues of market concentration and barriers to entry, this Court makes not ruling on the issue of whether Philbin's 
testimony is sufficient to prove SecurityMetrics' claims; that issue will be addressed at the proper time—on First Data's Motion 
for Partial Summary Judgment."
1065,17," Notably, Philbin has not asserted that First Data has violated any actual standard, regulation, or industry custom."
1065,18," The Federal Rules suggest that [*25]  expert testimony on general background facts is subject to less stringent standards than 
main, substantive facts. Specifically, the Advisory Committee Notes to the 2000 Amendment of Federal Rule of Evidence 
(""Rule"") 702 states: If the expert purports to apply principles and methods to the facts of the case, it is important that this application be 
conducted reliably. Yet it might also be important in some cases for an expert to educate the factfinder about general 
principles, without ever attempting to apply these principles to the specific facts of the case. . . . [E]xperts might instruct the 
factfinder on . . . principles . . . without ever knowing about or trying to tie their testimony into the facts of the case. The 
amendment does not alter the venerable practice of using expert testimony to educate the factfinder on general principles. 
For this kind of generalized testimony, Rule 702 simply requires that: (1) the expert be qualified; (2) the testimony address a 
subject matter on which the factfinder can be assisted by an expert; (3) the testimony be reliable; and (4) the testimony ""fit"" 
the facts of the case."
1065,19," First Data will, of course, have the opportunity to cross-examine Philbin about these issues. "
1067,20," Indeed, at this stage, Fist Data has not offered any case law to support the proposition that only one expert must satisfy all the 
elements to succeed on a claim."
1067,21," Specifically, First Data's motion references paragraphs 65, 68, and 90 of the Dr. Pleatsikas' expert report. In turn, these 
paragraphs reference the following transcripts:"
1067,1, ) Direct Connect phone transcript
1067,2, ) Opt Out phone transcript
1067,3, ) Petroleum Processing Solutions
1067,4, ) SurfFirst phone transcript
1067,5, ) Blackstone phone transcript
1067,6," ) Clearpay phone transcript See Pleatsikas Report ¶¶ 65, 68, 90."
1067,22," Nevertheless, First Data asserts that this omission, when ""[p]iled on top of all the other serious flaws identified by First Data,"" 
constitutes ""further reason to exclude Dr. Pleatsikas."" Reply MIL 33, at 23. As indicated herein, this Court does not find the other 
""flaws"" to be ""serious,"" and this Court declines First Data's invitation to exclude Dr. Pleatsikas' report, opinions, and testimony. "
1068,23," Although SecurityMetrics contends that the assertion of privilege and/or confidentiality has been limited to only his clients' 
identities, this Court finds that such information is important—and indeed necessary—in order for First Data to have any 
meaningful investigation into the foundation of Atlas' experience. "
1069,24," Jason Brown, the Finance Manager for First Data, served as First Data's Rule 30(b)(6) witness on the issue of fees, costs, and 
charges."
1069,25," Specifically, First Data asserts that the deposition transcript was emailed to all counsel on July 29, two days before the July 31 
expert report deadline."
1069,26," With respect to ISO revenues, First Data contends that ""ISO wholesale revenue (fees First Data charged to—not collected 
from—ISOs) is distinct from ISO retail revenue (representing fees that ISOs charged to their merchants from which First Data 
receives nothing)."" MIL #5, at 11. Similarly, First Data asserts that it bills only the retail revenue to its merchants and not the 
wholesale revenue. See id. at 12."
1069,27," First Data also argues that Nelson failed to properly disaggregate the damages as they related to the various individual 
counterclaims. See Reply MIL #5 (citing Pharmanetics, Inc. v. Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 182 F. App'x 267 (4th Cir. May 
31, 2006) (unpublished) and discussing Comcast Corp. v. Behrend,     U.S.    , 133 S. Ct. 1426, 185 L. Ed. 2d 515 (2013)). While 
both cases address the issue of lump sum damage calculations, those cases do not alter the Court's conclusion at this time. 
Notably, in Pharmanetics, the district court had already awarded summary judgment on some of the claims while the damages 
had been calculated as if the plaintiff had prevailed on those claims. Similarly, in Comcast Corp., the United States Supreme 
Court specifically relied upon the fact that the damages calculation addressed [*41]  four theories of liability but that only one of 
those theories remained at issue in the case. See Comcast Corp., 133 S. Ct. at 1434 (""This methodology might have been 
sound, and might have produced commonality of damages, if all four of those alleged distortions remained in the case.""). In this 
case, however, there has been no ruling on the various motions for summary judgment and all of the relevant theories still 
remain at issue in the case. "
1070,28," First Data's final arguments—that exclusion is proper due to Nelson's incorporation of the report of Michael Belch or due to the 
prejudicial effect on First Data under Rule 403—are also unavailing. Nelson's report spends a mere two paragraphs discussing 
Belch's report, which this Court has already excluded, and that discussion is just one aspect of the discussion of First Data's 
alleged conduct. First Data's Rule 403 argument does not raise any new issues and the above analysis adequately addresses 
the issues raised in its three sentence argument with respect to Rule 403. First Data's argument with respect to Schedule 16 and some of the other attachments to Nelson's report will be addressed in 
connection to First Data's sixth Motion in Limine. Moreover, it also worth noting that the Court has permitted First Data to re-depose Nelson."
1070,29," First Data contends that this failure was particularly meaningful because this Court allowed First Data to interview Mr. Caldwell 
again under Rule 30(b)(6) on the issue of damages following the June 18-19, 2014 hearing. See June 20, 2014 Letter Order ¶ 
10, ECF No. 245. "
1072,30," SecurityMetrics' argument with respect to Rule 1006 of the Federal Rules of Evidence does not change the Court's analysis. 
The question is not whether the recordings identified in the chart and Schedule 16 had been previously produced to First Data; 
the question is when SecurityMetrics identified those recordings as the basis for First Data's liability and SecurityMetrics' alleged 
damages."
1072,31," While the Court acknowledges that the sanction here is somewhat harsh, the Court finds it appropriate under the 
circumstances presented here. After First Data alleged that Caldwell was unprepared for his original Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, 
this Court essentially afforded SecurityMetrics a ""mulligan"" by permitting an additional Rule 30(b)(6) deposition on the issue of 
damages. While the Court did not order any cost-shifting with respect to that second deposition, the Court warned 
SecurityMetrics that it would be bound by Caldwell's testimony. "
1086,1," The Direct Purchasers' and the End Payors' complaints contain almost identical allegations. To avoid confusion, the facts 
recited herein will be derived from the Direct Purchasers' consolidated amended complaint. Where the allegations in the 
complaints differ, I will distinguish accordingly. In reviewing Defendants' motion to dismiss, I assume that all facts found in the 
consolidated amended complaints are true, and to the extent any facts from outside the amended complaints are recited, they 
are referenced for informational purposes only. See Ethypharm S.A. France v. Abbott Labs., 707 F.3d 223, 225 n.1 (3d Cir. 
2013). "
1087,2," The complaint indicates that orphan drug exclusivity may be granted: ""(a) on the basis that a product is intended to treat a 
disease or condition that has a U.S. prevalence of less than 200,000 persons; or (b) where the sponsor can show that there is 
no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing and making available the drug will be recovered from U.S. sales, despite 
the fact that the product treats a disease or condition that has a U.S. prevalence of 200,000 or more individuals."" The FDA found 
that the latter of these considerations applied to Suboxone. (Id. at ¶ 79.)"
1087,3," The End Payors allege that this [**9]  number was closer to 85% by the time generic Suboxone tablets entered the market in 
February 2013. (EP Compl. ¶ 4.) "
1088,4," Under the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, the FDA has the authority to require drug manufacturers to conduct a Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (""REMS""). A REMS is a process by which a drug's manufacturer demonstrates to the FDA 
that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks. ""A REMS can include a medication guide, a package insert, and potential restrictions 
on the distribution of the drug."" If the FDA requires a generic to conduct a REMS, an ANDA will not be approved until the REMS 
process is completed. (Id. at ¶¶ 57-58; Oral Arg. Tr. pp. 12-15.) "
1089,5, See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(4)(G); 21 C.F.R. § 314.127(a)(7). 
1091,6," All of the arguments raised in Reckitt's motion to dismiss the Direct Purchasers' complaint have also been incorporated as 
arguments requiring dismissal of the End Payors' state law antitrust claims. As the arguments raised and facts alleged apply 
equally to both groups of Plaintiffs, I will refer generally to Plaintiffs in this section where appropriate. "
1092,7," ""'Detailing' in the retail pharmaceutical business refers to the practice of sending company representatives to doctors' offices to 
distribute samples and promotional materials and information."" Walgreen, 534 F. Supp. 2d at 149 n.4. "
1093,8," At oral argument, Reckitt also claimed that Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Warner Chilcott Public Ltd. Co., 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 152467, 2013 WL 5692880 (E.D. Pa. June 12, 2013), supported its position. There, the district court expressed 
skepticism as to whether the defendants' alleged product-hopping scheme constituted exclusionary conduct. 2013 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 152467, [WL] at *2. However, the court in Mylan did not dismiss the plaintiffs' claims, instead finding that the development 
of a record was necessary. See id. "
1094,9," I note that Plaintiffs also alleged that Reckitt engaged in anticompetitive behavior by reducing the price of its film and raising the 
price of the tablets, despite the fact that the film was more expensive to manufacture. Reckitt correctly notes that only predatory 
pricing—that is, price decreases by a monopolist below any reasonable measure of cost—can be anticompetitive. Atl. Richfield 
Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 339, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (""in the context of pricing practices, 
only predatory pricing has the requisite anticompetitive effect""); see also Schor v. Abbott Labs., 457 F.3d 608, 610-11 (7th Cir. 
2006). While there are no allegations of predatory pricing here, I do not believe that this completely forecloses Plaintiffs' antitrust "
1095,," claims. See ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254, 277 (3d Cir. 2012) (finding that, HN12[
] where ""price itself was 
not [**33]  the clearly predominant mechanism of exclusion,"" failure to establish predatory pricing did not preclude the plaintiffs' 
claim)."
1095,10," Although Continental Ore involved a § 1 conspiracy claim, the Third Circuit has applied its reasoning to § 2 cases as well. 
LePage's, 324 F.3d at 162 (""the courts must look to the monopolist's conduct [**35]  taken as a whole rather than considering 
each aspect in isolation""). "
1097,11," Reckitt argues that even if 21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(8) created a duty to deal, it does not even apply under these circumstances. 
21 U.S.C. § 355-1(f)(8) states: No holder of an approved covered application shall use any element to assure safe use required by the Secretary under 
this subsection to block or delay approval of an application under section 355(b)(2) or (j) of this title [**43]  or to prevent 
application of such element under subsection (i)(1)(B) to a drug that is the subject of an abbreviated new drug application. Reckitt asserts that the complaints include no facts to indicate that the elements to assure safe use in Reckitt's REMS were 
used, or even could be used, to block or delay any ANDA. Instead, they frame Plaintiffs' argument as disliking the terms by 
which Reckitt sought to negotiate. Plaintiffs respond by pointing to sections of its complaint alleging that § 355-1(f)(8) applies, 
and a letter written to the FDA, which recounts that the FDA previously warned Reckitt that attempts to block or delay would 
violate § 355-1(f)(8). Plaintiffs argue that the FDA's interpretation of the FDCA is entitled to deference. However, there is no 
document attached to the complaint that actually includes a statement from the FDA on this issue. Therefore, I agree with 
Defendants that it is dubious whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently pleaded that the statute even applied. Nevertheless, I need not 
decide this issue because, even assuming the statute applies, Count III will still be dismissed. "
1098,12," Plaintiffs' reliance on Safeway Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 761 F. Supp. 2d 874 (N.D. Cal. 2011) is misplaced. In Safeway, the 
court found that there had been a prior course of dealing between the [**44]  manufacturer and its competitors, that there was 
evidence that it was only willing to negotiate on unreasonable terms, and there was evidence that the manufacturer refused to 
provide its competitors the same terms that it provided to its retail customers. Id. at 892-95. Plaintiffs here have only alleged that 
Reckitt refused to negotiate reasonably. There is no history of collaboration prior to the SSRS process. Therefore, Safeway is 
distinguishable. "
1099,13," While the FDA did [**50]  state that it ""welcomes and encourages sponsors to utilize unit-dose packaging,"" it also stated ""we 
do not believe the data at this time support refusing to approve applications that lack such packaging."" (DP Compl., Ex. G., p. 
14.) Reckitt tries to argue that based on this ""encouragement"" some of its relief was granted. I disagree with that assertion. "
1101,14," The End Payors' customers are also alleged to have made purchases in Ohio. However, this is irrelevant for the purposes of 
my analysis because no claims have been brought under Ohio law."
1101,15," While Reckitt asserts that the End Payors' claims under Virginia law should be dismissed for lack of standing, it later argues 
that under conflict of laws principles the End Payors ""can only assert claims under the laws of Virginia or their residence"" and 
advocates applying Virginia law. (Reckitt Mot. to Dismiss EP Compl., pp. 8, 10.) I find that the End Payors' allegations that 
Reckitt engaged in wrongful, anticompetitive conduct in Virginia is sufficient to establish standing in that state. "
1102,16," Wellbutrin reflected on two Supreme Court cases, Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 117 S. Ct. 2231, 138 L. 
Ed. 2d 689 (1997) and Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 119 S. Ct. 2295, 144 L. Ed. 2d 715 (1999), in which the 
Supreme Court considered the propriety of class certification immediately prior to assessing Article III standing. However, 
Wellbutrin found these cases to be distinguishable. In Amchem and Ortiz the Supreme Court had been asked to determine the 
standing of potential class members as opposed to the standing of the named plaintiffs. Further, in Amchem [**59]  and Ortiz, a 
finding that class certification was improper would have negated any need to determine standing, making class certification 
""logically antecedent"" to the Article III issue. Wellbutrin, 260 F.R.D. at 153-54. Indeed, ""[t]o rule on the issue of standing at that 
point in the case would have required the Court to make a determination as to the standing of persons who were not actually 
parties to the case, but who were only proposed parties to the case."" Id. at 153. Therefore, for these additional reasons, I agree 
with the analysis in Wellbutrin finding that Amchem and Ortiz are distinguishable, and that class certification is not logically 
antecedent to standing in this case."
1102,17," The End Payors also cite to this Court's decision in King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 702 F. Supp. 2d 514 
(E.D. Pa. 2010), arguing that I previously rejected the reasoning of Wellbutrin. However, in Cephalon, I did not need to reach the 
question at issue here—whether the named end payor plaintiffs had standing to assert state law claims on behalf of absent class 
members. The named end payor plaintiffs in Cephalon had reimbursed customers, and thus had standing, in every jurisdiction in 
which they had brought a claim. Id. at 538. "
1103,18," Accordingly, the antitrust claims brought under the laws of the following states and territories are dismissed: Arizona, District of 
Columbia, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode 
Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia. The End Payors have also voluntarily withdrawn their 
antitrust claims under Illinois, Missouri and New York law. (See EP [**62]  Resp., p. 34 n.29.) The consumer protection claims under the laws of the following states and territories are also dismissed: Arkansas, Arizona, 
District of Columbia, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, 
Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and West Virginia. Finally, the unjust enrichment claims brought under the laws of the following states and territories are dismissed: Arkansas, 
Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Maine, 
Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South 
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming. "
1104,19," The End Payors have identified the following states as either ""home states"" or ""purchase states"": Alabama, Alaska, California, 
Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, 
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (EP Compl. ¶¶ 102-15.) Claims under Virginia law may also proceed as Virginia is Reckitt's home 
state—the state where much of Reckitt's anticompetitive conduct is alleged to have been carried out."
1104,20," Reckitt argues that the End Payors' claims for monopolization under Florida and Massachusetts law must be dismissed 
because these states do not permit antitrust claims by indirect purchasers. In the same vein, Reckitt argues that California 
antitrust law does not recognize a claim for monopolization. A review of the statutes cited in the End Payors' complaint 
demonstrates that the monopolization and attempted monopolization claims brought in Counts I and II have been brought under 
the Consumer Protection Laws of Florida, Massachusetts and California. Therefore, I will address whether the End Payors have 
stated a claim under these statutes in the Consumer Protection Law section infra."
1104,21," Reckitt attaches exhibits to its motion that identify [**68]  cases and statutes from each of the relevant state jurisdictions in 
support of all of Reckitt's state-specific arguments. The End Payors argue that this appendix is improper for exceeding 
previously ordered page limits. This argument was the subject of a motion to strike, wherein the End Payors argued that Reckitt 
had nearly doubled its page limit by attaching exhibits filled with authority and legal argument. (Doc. No. 61.) Reckitt responded 
that the tables were for the convenience of the Court and are routinely utilized in this type of litigation where numerous state 
statutes are at issue. Reckitt points out that it had previously consented to an increase in the page limit of the End Payors' "
1105,," response in order to allow them to more fully address these state-by-state arguments. (Doc. No. 62.) The motion to strike was 
denied, although I noted that ""[s]hould the Court conclude that the numerous exhibits filed by Defendant along with its Rule 12 
motions are improper, those exhibits will not be considered."" (Doc. No. 66.) While these tables of authority do contain legal argument and thus exceed the previously-ordered page limit, the additional 
pages were likely necessary to address claims raised by the [**69]  End Payors from nearly every state in the country. As the 
End Payors were provided an additional twenty pages to respond to Reckitt's motion, which allowed them to identify authority 
from all of the relevant jurisdictions, there has been no prejudice to the End Payors. Therefore, I will consider Reckitt's exhibits. "
1107,22," While California's antitrust law does not recognize unilateral conduct, as is alleged here, Reckitt has not demonstrated that 
any such restriction exists as to California's consumer protection law. Therefore, I will allow California's claims for 
monopolization and attempted [**76]  monopolization to proceed under California's consumer protection law."
1107,23," Although Florida's antitrust law does not permit antitrust claims by indirect purchasers and has adopted Illinois Brick, Florida 
courts have held that the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act does not have this same restriction. Mack v. Bristol-
Myers Squibb Co., 673 So.2d 100, 110 (Fla. App. 1996). Therefore, I decline to dismiss the claims for monopolization and 
attempted monopolization brought under the FDUTPA on Illinois Brick grounds. "
1108,24," As previously noted, Massachusetts' consumer protection law was cited as providing a cause of action for the End Payors' 
monopolization and attempted monopolization claims. These claims will also be dismissed as barred by Illinois Brick. "
1111,25," The End Payors cite to Cephalon, 702 F. Supp. 2d at 539, for the proposition that this Court has previously rejected the end-
run argument with regard to unjust enrichment claims. However, Illinois Brick and various states' adoption of this limitation were 
not discussed in Cephalon. See id. at 539-40."
1111,26," Arnold v. Microsoft Corp., 2001 Ky. App. LEXIS 1311, 2001 WL 1835377, at *7 (Ky. Ct. App. Nov. 21, 2001) (applying the 
holding of Illinois Brick to Kentucky's antitrust law)."
1111,27," Sickles v. Cabot Corp., 379 N.J. Super. 100, 877 A.2d 267, 275 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 2005) (""an indirect purchaser is 
precluded from suing for antitrust violations under the [New Jersey Antitrust statute]""). "
1112,28," I note that some Florida precedent has not been entirely clear that the conferral of a direct benefit is required. See Merkle v. 
Health Options, Inc., 940 So.2d 1190, 1199 (Fla. 4th D.C.A. 2006); Hillman Constr. Corp. v. Wainer, 636 So.2d 576, 577-78 
(Fla. 4th D.C.A. 1994). Although these cases allowed claims to proceed where there did not appear to be a direct benefit 
conferred, at no point did the court make a clear statement that a direct benefit was not required. Furthermore, the appellate 
courts' reasoning in reversing the trial courts' dismissals seemed to focus on the trial courts improperly making factual 
determinations that a benefit was not conferred, as opposed to adopting the factual allegations made in the complaint. I do not 
find that these ambiguous rulings are sufficient to overcome the majority of Florida precedent [**92]  that has clearly and 
affirmatively held that a direct benefit is required for an unjust enrichment claim under Florida law. "
1117,29," Reckitt also incorporates these arguments into its motion to dismiss the Direct [**107]  Purchasers' complaint. The Direct 
Purchasers have adopted the arguments made by the End Payors; however, they acknowledge that they inadvertently failed to 
include certain allegations regarding market power that had previously been pleaded in one Direct Purchaser's original 
complaint. (See Dkt. No. 13-1164, Doc. No. 1, ¶¶ 98-104.) They state that they intend to file a consolidated second amended 
complaint to re-insert those averments upon disposition of this motion. "
1119,30," The allegations present in the Direct Purchasers' consolidated amended complaint also establish direct evidence of monopoly 
power, and to the extent required to establish a relevant market, identify it in a similar manner as the End Payors—that is, that 
the relevant market includes Suboxone in all of its forms and dosage strengths, including generics. They also briefly include an 
explanation as to why Suboxone does not have cross-elasticity of demand with other opioid dependence treatments. For the 
reasons explained in this section, I am not inclined to grant a motion to dismiss on monopoly power grounds, particularly where 
the Third Circuit has articulated that dismissal at this stage is disfavored and where it is unclear that a relevant market definition 
is required at all where direct evidence of monopoly power has been provided. I accept the Direct Purchasers' [**112]  
allegations regarding the relevant market, but acknowledge that it is a close call and urge them to file the second amended 
complaint to include more substantial facts on this issue."
1119,31," Reckitt adopts the arguments in this section as to the Direct Purchasers as well. The Direct Purchasers do not respond, 
nor [**113]  do they adopt the End Payors' response on this issue. The only allegation in the Direct Purchasers' complaint 
regarding these additional Reckitt entities is that they ""manufacture[ ] and market[ ] numerous products, including 
pharmaceuticals subject to FDA approval, and w[ere] in whole or in part responsible for some or all of the conduct alleged herein 
and attributed to Reckitt."" (DP Compl. ¶¶ 19-23.) These bare bones allegations are not sufficient to establish liability against 
these additional Reckitt entities. See In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., 514 F. Supp. 2d 683, 699 (E.D. Pa. 2007) 
(HN51[
] ""In order to sustain their claims of monopolization and attempted monopolization, Plaintiffs must . . . prove the 
required elements against each individual defendant."") (quoting Carpet Group Int'l v. Oriental Rug Imps. Assoc., 256 F. Supp. 2d 
249, 284 (D.N.J. 2003)); see also In re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 812 F. Supp. 2d 390, 417 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Accordingly, as 
to the Direct Purchasers, these four additional Reckitt entities will be dismissed. "
1120,32," While Reckitt states in their brief that three End Payors failed to serve Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK) Ltd. and Reckitt 
Benckiser Group plc and two failed to serve any Defendant (see Reckitt's MTD EP Compl. p. 40, n.25), a review of the dockets 
in this matter reveals the following: The End Payors that have failed to serve Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare (UK) Ltd. and Reckitt 
Benckiser Group plc. are United Food & Commercial Workers Health & Welfare Fund (Dkt. No. 13-3229), A.F. of L.-A.G.C. 
Building Trades Welfare Plan (Dkt. No. 13-3545), Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters Employee Benefits Fund (Dkt. No. 
13-1808), and I.B.E.W. 292 Health Care Plan (Dkt. No. 13-2454). The End Payors that failed to serve any Defendant are 
Teamsters Health Services & Insurance Plan Local 404 (Dkt. No. 13-3451)."
1120,33," The antitrust claims under the laws of Arizona, District of Columbia, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, 
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South 
Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, [**118]  Vermont and West Virginia will be dismissed. The consumer protection claims under the laws of Arkansas, Arizona, District of Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, 
Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South

Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode

dismissed. "
1127,1," In addition to the claims that are the subject of Alfred Angelo's motion, House of Brides asserts claims for breach of contract 
(Count I), breach of warranty (Count II), and declaratory judgment (Count III)."
1127,2," The facts stated in the SAC are accepted as true for the purposes of this motion. See Navarro v. Neal, 716 F.3d 425, 429 (7th 
Cir. 2013). Those factual allegations are essentially identical to those that were relayed in this Court's decision on the prior 
motion to dismiss, as the plaintiffs chose to largely replead the same information. The Court therefore assumes familiarity with its 
prior opinion, briefly summarizes the facts here, and will discuss the handful of new factual allegations in addressing the parties' 
respective arguments. "
1134,3," Illinois [*28]  law appears to be somewhat unsettled with respect to whether a claim for tortious interference with contract 
requires that the breach be by the third party and that (like a claim for tortious interference with business expectancy) the 
defendant's actions be directed towards the third party. See Fresh N' Pure, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136307, 2011 WL 5921450, at 
*8-10 (discussing the split of authority among Illinois state courts). These issues are potentially relevant since Alfred Angelo 
argues in its reply (but not its opening brief) that House of Brides' tortious interference with contract claim is deficient since the 
SAC fails to allege that Alfred Angelo's actions were directed to any third party. It is not necessary to resolve this question, 
however, since the tortious interference with contract claim fails in any event, as explained below."
1134,4," This rationale applies as well to the claim for tortious interference with business expectancy. See Fid. Nat'l Title Ins. Co. v. 
Westhaven Props. P'ship, 386 Ill. App. 3d 201, 219, 898 N.E.2d 1051, 1067, 325 Ill. Dec. 772 (2007) (to prevail on such claim, a 
plaintiff must show ""some impropriety committed by the defendant in interfering with plaintiff's business expectancy""); see also 
Acoustical Surfaces, Inc. v. Vertetek Corp., No. 13-CV-4837, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 48122, 2014 WL 1379864, at *7 (N.D. Ill.

treatment, their significance requires resolution in time to permit the possibility of appellate review. "
1192,1," Note that § 50-112 has been amended, effective April 18, 2013. Other statutes related to this case were amended with the 
same effective date. "

1222,1," State Farm was served with Plaintiff's complaint on September 5, 2014, and thus removal was timely pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 
1446(b). (See Doc. No. 1, p. 3.) "
1224,2," Section 377.32 requires an individual who seeks to commence an action or proceeding or continue a pending action or 
proceeding as the decedent's successor in interest to file an affidavit or declaration setting forth certain facts including the 
decedent's name, date and place of decedent's death, and a statement that there is no other pending action in California for the 
administration of decedent's estate. See Cal. C. Civ. Proc. § 377.32. "
1226,3," State Farm also moves to dismiss or strike Plaintiff's request for damages in conjunction with the UCL and FAL claims. (Doc. 
No. 4-1, p. 25-26.) District Courts do not have discretion to strike an improper request for damages. See Whittlestone, Inc. v. 
Handi Craft Co., 618 F.3d 970, 972 (9th Cir. 2010). However, to the extent Plaintiff has failed to adequately state a claim as to 
both the UCL and FAL claims, any request for damages—either restitutionary or injunctive in nature—similarly fails and is 
therefore dismissed from the complaint by way of dismissing the first and second causes of action. "
1227,4," As the Court finds Plaintiffs intentional and negligent misrepresentation claims barred by the economic loss doctrine the Court 
does not address State Farm's alternate grounds for dismissal of those claims for failure to comply with the heightened pleading 
requirements of Rule 9(b). "

question of law as to which there is substantial ground for a difference of opinion and that immediate review of the order 
may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation."
1248,10, These questions were identical to those that had been proposed by the Petitioners.
1248,11," We consider only whether the limitation period applies to the cause of action brought by the Attorney General in his 
capacity as parens [***7]  patriae."
1248,12," The formulation of this second question could be construed as an invitation to consider whether RCW 4.16.160 exempts the Attorney General's claim for actual damages pursuant to RCW 19.86.090 from the four-year limitation period set forth in 
RCW 19.86.120. To the extent that this invitation was, in fact, extended, we decline to accept it. The focal cause of action on discretionary review, as evidenced by the trial court record and by the merits briefing submitted 
by the parties, is the parens patriae claim. Although the parties' litigation strategy does not dictate the scope of discretionary 
review, for purposes of our review in this matter, we choose to address only the issue of whether RCW 4.16.160 exempts the "
1249,," parens patriae cause of action from any otherwise applicable statute of limitation. See City of Bothell v. Barnhart, 156 Wn. App.

1251,18," Washington's legislature was not alone in creating this type of claim. Many other states have authorized their attorneys

1251,19," Indirect purchasers are those who are not “immediate [***15]  buyers” from the antitrust defendant. Kansas v. UtiliCorp United, 
Inc., 497 U.S. 199, 207, 110 S. Ct. 2807, 111 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1990)."
1251,20," Two exceptions to this prohibition have been recognized: the “cost-plus” exception and the “control” exception. See, e.g., In re 
Wyo. Tight Sands Antitrust Cases, 866 F.2d 1286, 1290 (10th Cir. 1989). Neither exception is at issue herein."
1251,21," The United States Supreme Court has held squarely that the “indirect purchaser rule” of Illinois Brick does not preempt state 
law. ARC, 490 U.S. at 101."
1251,22," HN15[
] “Person” includes “the counties, municipalities, and all political subdivisions of this state.” RCW 19.86.090."
1251,23," “Person” includes “corporations and associations existing under or authorized by the laws of either the United States, the laws 
of [***16]  any of the Territories, the laws of any State, or the laws of any foreign country.” 15 U.S.C. § 12."

1251,25," As noted, supra note 20, exceptions to this rule exist. "
1252,26," Many states have, unlike Washington, enacted legislation that allows indirect purchasers to recover actual damages pursuant 
to state antitrust statutes. Tomlin & Giali, supra, at 161."
1252,27," These amendments were, at least in part, in response to the following observation made by this court in Blewett: although “a 
private plaintiff must ‘be injured in his or her business or property’ in order to bring any suit under the Act, this requirement does 
not exist in [RCW 19.86.080],” meaning that “the indirect purchaser is not entirely without a remedy.” 86 Wn. App. at 790; LAWS OF 2007, ch. 66, § 1. "
1253,28," RCW 19.86.090 was amended twice between 1970 and 2007, and again following the 2007 amendment. LAWS OF 1983, ch. 
288, § 3; LAWS OF 1987, ch. 202, § 187; LAWS OF 2009, ch. 371, § 1. However, given that the content of these amendments have 
no impact on our analysis, we do not further dwell on them."
1253,29," As an initial matter, the Petitioners argue that two Washington cases, Imperato v. Wenatchee Valley College, 160 Wn. App. 
353, 247 P.3d 816 (2011), and Eastwood v. Cascade Broadcasting Co., 106 Wn.2d 466, 722 P.2d 1295 (1986), establish that 
“there is no basis to conclude that the legislature intended to give [the Attorney General] an infinite period of time in which to file” 
his parens patriae claim. Pet'rs' Opening Br. at 29-31. As we explained, our inquiry as to the first certified question is not whether 
the legislature intended to establish an infinite period of time in which the Attorney General may file a parens patriae claim. 
Instead, we must discern whether the legislature intended RCW 19.86.120 to apply to parens patriae claims brought pursuant to 
RCW 19.86.080. Neither case cited by the Petitioners is useful in seeking to discern the legislature's intent. In Imperato, the plaintiff filed an unfair labor practices claim in superior court and argued that because the six-month statute of 
limitation otherwise applicable to his claim explicitly applied only when the claim was filed before the Public Employees Relations 
Commission (PERC), the six-month limitation period did not [***22]  bar his claim. 160 Wn. App. at 360-62. The issue before 
Division Three was whether the plaintiff could avoid the statute of limitation by filing his complaint in superior court instead of 
before PERC. Given that, in resolving this issue, Division Three sought to discern whether the legislature intended for a statute 
of limitation to apply for the same claim but in a different venue, the precedential value of its decision is limited to its observation 
that “[w]hen interpreting a statute, a court's fundamental objective is to ascertain and carry out the legislature's intent.” Imperato, 
160 Wn. App. at 361. In Eastwood, our Supreme Court considered whether a false light invasion of privacy claim was governed by the two-year 
statute of limitation for libel and slander or the three-year statute of limitation for injury to the person or rights of another. 106 
Wn.2d at 469. In concluding that the two-year limitation period applicable to libel and slander applied, the court was “persuaded 
that because of the duplication inherent in false light and defamation claims … the same statute of limitations is applicable to 
both actions.” Eastwood, 106 Wn.2d at 474. However, because the court was dealing with common law causes of action, it was 
not required to seek to ascertain legislative intent. [***23]  Therefore, its decision does not inform ours. "
1254,30," While this could be construed as an argument that the indirect purchaser rule of Illinois Brick preempts the CPA, the 
Petitioners do not purport to be maintaining such a position and, in any event, that position has been rejected [***24]  by the 
United States Supreme Court. ARC, 490 U.S. at 101."
1254,31," It is apparent, given our recent observation that “modern economic structures” will, in at least some cases, make it 
“unreasonable to expect” that antitrust defendants “would target Washington consumers directly,” that these augmented 
protections are more than just a gloss on the federal regulatory regime. AU Optronics, 180 Wn. App. at 928. "
1255,32," It is clear that, in amending RCW 19.86.080 in 2007, the legislature considered the CPA's structure. This is evidenced, in part, 
by its added directive that courts consider consolidation or coordination with other related actions to avoid duplicate recovery."
1255,33," “[Restitution] differs in its goal or principle from damages.” 1 DAN B. DOBBS, DOBBS LAW OF REMEDIES § 4.1(1), at 555 (2d ed. 
1993). Whereas “[r]estitution measures the remedy by the defendant's gain and seeks to force disgorgement of that gain,” 
damages “measures the [***28]  remedy by the plaintiff's loss and seeks to provide compensation for that loss.” 1 DOBBS, supra, 
§ 4.1(1), at 555. "
1256,34," Initially, the Petitioners argue that this exemption applies only to limitations prescribed within chapter 4.16 RCW. This is so, 
they assert, because the prefatory clause restricts application of the exemption to that of “limitations prescribed in this chapter.” 
Pet'rs' Opening Br. at 16. Thus, they argue, it has no application with regard to a cause of action subject to a statute of limitation 
set forth in a different chapter of the RCW. They are incorrect. The prefatory clause applies the limitations on actions brought by private parties in chapter 4.16 RCW to actions brought in the 
name or for the benefit of certain political subdivisions of the State. The State itself, acting through the Attorney General does 
not, however, fall within the enumerated political subdivisions. Consistent with this observation, our Supreme Court has applied 
the exemption set forth in the proviso to a limitation period prescribed in a different chapter of the RCW in an action brought by 
the State. See State v. Miller, 32 Wn.2d 149, 156, 201 P.2d 136 (1948) (applying the provision now codified at RCW 4.16.160 to 
exempt a certain cause of action from application [***34]  of a statute of limitations located in a different code chapter). "
1257,35," Conversely, it is our understanding that when the State seeks [***36]  damages pursuant to RCW 19.86.090, it is acting not in 
a sovereign capacity but, rather, as a consumer. Counsel for the Attorney General, during oral argument, conceded that, when 
the State seeks to recover actual damages, it is not exercising a sovereign function. Counsel also conceded that the CPA does 
not authorize the State to act as parens patriae on behalf of itself. "
1258,36," Not only is it speculative to suggest that the legislature perceived private plaintiffs to be “equally capable” of furthering the 
purposes of the CPA, it is irrelevant to the resolution of [***37]  this issue."
1258,37," The Petitioners also cite to our decision in State v. Pacific Health Center, Inc., 135 Wn. App. 149, 157 n.7, 143 P.3d 618 
(2006). They argue that a footnote contained in the procedural history demonstrates that a limitation period has previously been 
applied to a RCW 19.86.080 restitution claim. [***39]  This footnote, which describes a trial court's ruling, states, “The [trial] court 
found appellants had committed 9,426 separate violations within the statute of limitations' allowable period on the State's claim.” 
Pac. Health, 135 Wn. App. at 157 n.7. Given that, at the time of our decision, the legislature had not yet expressly authorized 
parens patriae actions to be brought pursuant to RCW 19.86.080, this observation is not pertinent to the resolution of the issue 
presented herein. "
1259,38," Citing to Lunsford, the Petitioners argue that because the additional issues are arguably related to issues raised in the trial 
court, we should consider them for the first time “on appeal.” Pet'rs' Reply Br. at 25. To the contrary, this matter comes before us 
on discretionary review, not on appeal. Thus, Lunsford is inapposite."
1259,39," The Petitioners contend, without supporting citation, that because a commissioner of this court, “[d]uring the hearing on this 
motion, … discussed the applicability of” RCW 19.86.120 to claims brought pursuant to RCW 19.86.090, her subsequent grant 
of discretionary review, which “is simply silent on this issue,” creates an “ambiguity in [her] order” that “renders Plaintiff's [***43]  
authorities inapposite.” Pet'rs' Reply Br. at 24. We are unpersuaded by this unsupported contention. "
1262,1," Defendants also filed a request for judicial notice. Dkt. 35. Defendants request that the court take notice of a second amended 
complaint filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania dated January 26, 2010. The document is a 
matter of public record. Lee v. City of Los Angeles, 250 F.3d 668, 689 (""A court may take judicial notice of 'matters of public 
record.'""). Accordingly, the request for judicial notice is GRANTED. However, in taking judicial notice of this document, the Court 
does not accept it for the truth of the matters asserted therein. "
1263,2," For the purposes of defendants' motion to dismiss claim 9 under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the Court limits its analysis to the 
facts alleged in the SAC. However, in analyzing defendants' motion to strike claims 1, 2, 4-8, and 10 pursuant to California's 
Anti-SLAPP statute, the Court considers both the facts alleged in the SAC and competent evidence contained in the parties' 
affidavits. See Cal. Code Civ. Pro. § 425.16(b)(2). The Court notes that both defendants and plaintiffs cite multiple declarations in their briefs, several of which have not been filed 
in connection with the instant motion, but which were filed in connection with defendants' motion to dismiss and special motion to 
strike plaintiffs' FAC. Dkts. 14, 18-21, 26-28, 30. The parties cite the following declarations: Declaration of Greg Howe, Dkt. 14-1; 
Declaration of James Needle, Dkt. 34-2; Declaration of Errol Kent, Dkt. 14-4; Declaration of Cyrus S. Naim, Dkt. 34-4; 
Declaration of Carl Michael, Dkt. 30-1; Declaration of George Davison, Dkt. 26; Declaration of Shawn Miner, Dkt. 28; Declaration 
of Anthony Valkanas, Dkt. 28. "
1265,3," Howe avers that he does not have copies of the emails he sent and received to ""other victims"" of New Show, because it was 
his practice to simply delete the emails after reading them, and he does not know how to keep a copy of his sent mail. Howe 
Decl. ¶ 19. Howe further avers that his ""intention was never to withhold documents from this case, it was just my ordinary 
practice [to delete the emails]. When I deleted them this case had not yet been filed, and I had no idea [New Show] could or 
would file it . . . ."" Id."
1265,4," Needle asserts that he removed these comments after a few days, because he ""knew [New Show] had recently sued 
Television Writers' Vault based on some comments posted online by its founder . . . and [he] wanted to avoid any similar legal 
troubles."" Id. "
1270,5," To the extent that this argument is predicated on plaintiffs' assertion in their opposition that the Court should only consider 
defendants' private statements—which it appears to be—the Court is similarly unpersuaded. See Makaeff, 715 F. 3d at 263 n.5 
(rejecting Trump University's attempt to limit appellate court's consideration to allegedly defamatory private letters, when Trump 
University's pleadings and affidavits referenced internet postings). "
1275,6," ""Because a showing of actual malice necessarily depends on the falsity of the statements at issue, the district court may 
assume the falsity of the statements and proceed directly to the actual malice inquiry. If it concludes that [plaintiff] cannot 
establish a reasonable probability of proving actual malice, it need not inquire whether the statements were actually false for 
purposes of ruling on the motion to strike."" Makaeff, 715 F.3d at 271, n.3. "
1278,7," Further, Needle asserts that when he was first hired by Davison Design, he was asked to sign a form notifying him that the 
company had previously been fined by the FTC for unethical promotion practices, and which asked Needle to report any other 
unethical activity he witnessed to the FTC. Needle Decl. ¶ 3. In fact, defendants point to a press release issued by the FTC titled 
""Invention Promoters Will Pay $10 Million to Settle FTC Charges,"" dated July 18, 2008. Naim Decl. ¶ 8, Ex. 7. The Court 
judicially notices this press release, as well as the FTC Consent Decree referenced therein. The Court notes that the 2008 
Consent Decree prohibited Davison Design from engaging in unethical promotional practices that bear a striking resemblance to 
the promotional practices complained of by both Needle and Howe. The Consent Decree also required Davison Design to 
deliver a copy of the Consent Decree to all employees hired as of July 2013, and contained broad monitoring provisions 
applicable to all business entities connected to the Davison defendants. It thus appears to the Court that Needle was obligated 
to report any unethical promotional practices he witnessed while still employed by Davison Design, further underscoring that 
plaintiffs' claim for intentional interference with contractual relations lacks ""minimal merit."" "
1282,1," Specifically, FDMS's original Complaint [*4]  alleged tortious interference with existing and prospective contractual and 
business relationships (Count 1), false endorsement/association in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A) 
(Count 2), trademark, service mark and trademark infringement in violation of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1114(1) and 
1125(a)(1)(A) (Count 3), false advertising in violation of the Lanham Act 15 U.S.C. § 1125 (a)(1)(B) (Count 4) and common law 
unfair competition (Count 5). Following a stay of this action pending final disposition of the earlier case filed in the District of Utah 
and the subsequent denial of FDMS's Preliminary Injunction Motion filed in this Court, FDMS was permitted to amend its 
Complaint (ECF No. 91). The Amended Complaint (ECF No. 92) filed by both First Data Plaintiffs seeks declaratory relief (Counts 1 & 9) and alleges 
breach of contract (Count 2), common law unfair competition (Count 3), tortious interference with existing and prospective 
contractual and business relationships (Count 4), injurious falsehood (Count 5), as well as violations of the Lanham Act, 15 
U.S.C. §§ 1114(1) and 1125(a)(1)(A) (Counts 6, 7, & 8)."
1282,2," At the December 12, 2014 hearing, First Data withdrew its other common law tort claims for unfair competition and injurious 
falsehoods."
1282,3," After having resolving the motions for summary judgment, this Memorandum Opinion also addresses a few outstanding 
evidentiary issues. Specifically, SecurityMetrics' request for clarification and/or reconsideration (ECF No. 321) is DENIED AS 
MOOT. First Data's Motion to Strike the November 12, 2014 'Pinch-Hitting' Declaration of Expert Robert J. Philbin (ECF No. 310) 
was denied for the reasons indicated on the record at the December 12, 2014 hearing. SecurityMetrics' Motion in Limine to 
Exclude Portions of Expert Report and Testimony of J. Gregory Sidak (ECF No. 296) is DENIED AS MOOT. Finally, 
SecurityMetrics' Motion in Limine to Exclude Portions of Dr. Richard Gering's Report, Testimony, [*6]  and Demonstrative 
Exhibits (ECF No. 300) is GRANTED AS MOOT. "
1283,4," Within the payment card industry, merchants are categorized based upon the volume of their transactions. Level 4 merchants 
have the lowest transaction volume and are the category of merchants at issue in this case."
1283,5," Specifically, SecurityMetrics alleges: For PCI Standard compliance validation purposes, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover each divide merchants into four levels; 
American Express divides them into three; and JCB divides them into two. Following the classifications used by Visa and 
MasterCard, the lowest-volume merchants are commonly referred to as ""Level 4 merchants."" Def.'s Countercl. ¶ 30. The Court adopts this terminology herein."
1283,6," Specifically, SecurityMetrics alleges: For PCI Standard compliance validation purposes, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover each divide merchants into four levels; 
American Express divides them into three; and JCB divides them into two. Following the classifications used by Visa and 
MasterCard, the lowest-volume merchants are commonly referred to as ""Level 4 merchants."" Def.'s Countercl. ¶ 30. The Court adopts this terminology herein. "
1284,7," SecurityMetrics also has several additional certifications that First Data does not, including certifications as a Qualified Security 
Assessor (""QSA""), Payment Application Qualified Security Assessor (""PA-QSA""), PCI Forensic Investigator (""PFIs""), and Point-
to-Point Encryption assessors (""P2PE""). [*10]"
1284,8," For purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, the relevant documents include the original January 2008 contract (the ""Master 
Services Agreement"") (ECF No. 275-2) and a separate ""Statement of Work"" (ECF No. 275-3), and the 2011 Amendment to the 
Master Services Agreement (ECF No. 275-5)."
1284,9," Accordingly to First Data, the event that precipitated the falling-out was First Data's instruction to SecurityMetrics to stop using 
the data provided by First Data for out-bound solicitations to Level 4 merchants. First Data believes that this action was 
consistent with the contract. First Data alleges that, thereafter, SecurityMetrics accused First Data of breaching the contract, cut 
off First Data's access to SecurityMetrics' interactive database, and stopped submitting PCI compliance reports with [*12]  the 
START feeds."
1284,10," As noted infra, this service is now being wound down. "
1287,11," SecurityMetrics also suggests that granting this motion would have the effect of mooting Count 9 of First Data's Amended 
Complaint."
1287,12," Specifically, this Court ruled that: According to First Data, the phrase ""for which SecurityMetrics will provide services as outlined in any Statement of Work"" 
signifies that ""SecurityMetrics is precluded post-termination from using data about Unenrolled Merchants that it previously 
received from FDMS to market PCI compliance services to those merchants."" Pls.' Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 10, 
ECF No. 115. On its end, SecurityMetrics argues that ""provide"" means ""to supply or make available."" Def.'s Reply to Pls.' 
Opp. at 7, ECF No. 122. Specifically, SecurityMetrics contends that while it supplied services to Enrolled Merchants, it 
made its services available to Unenrolled Merchants. Id. As stated above, [*21]  when ""the language of the agreement is 
reasonably susceptible to [either parties'] contended interpretation, . . . [the agreement] is ambiguous, and any evidence 
relevant to prove its meaning is admissible."" Ward, 907 P.2d at 269. In this case, as ""the contrary positions of the parties 
[are] each . . . tenable,"" Uintah Basin Med. Ctr., 2005 UT App. 92 at ¶ 13, 110 P.3d 168, the provision relating to 
SecurityMetrics' use of Merchant Data in the Terms of Settlement is ambiguous. As such, ""extrinsic evidence must be 
looked to in order to determine the intentions of the parties."" Dixon v. Pro Image Inc., 1999 UT 89, ¶ 14, 987 P.2d 48. 
Extrinsic evidence regarding the meaning of ""Merchant"" is not presently before the Court. Moreover, it is well established 
that ""the construction of ambiguous provisions is a factual determination that precludes dismissal on a motion for failure to 
state a claim."" Martin Marietta Corp. v. Int'l Telecomm. Satellite Org., 991 F.2d 94, 97 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Kreisler & 
Kreisler, LLC v. Nat'l City Bank, 657 F.3d 729, 731 (8th Cir. 2011) (""If the language is susceptible to more than one "
1288,," meaning, then resolution of the ambiguity as to the parties' intent is a question of fact and the court should not grant a 
motion to dismiss.""); Eternity Global Master Fund Ltd. v. Morgan Guar. Trust Co. of N.Y., 375 F.3d 168, 178 (2d Cir. 2004) 
(""[A] claim predicated on a materially ambiguous contract term is not dismissible on the pleadings.""); Dawson v. Gen. 
Motors Corp., 977 F.2d 369, 373 (7th Cir. 1992) (same proposition). Accordingly, Defendant SecurityMetrics' Motion to 
Dismiss Counts I and II of Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint [*22]  is DENIED. Mem. Op. Mot. Dismiss Am. Compl. 11-12, ECF No. 152."
1288,13," ""Refused"" means a Merchant that has refused the Services after having been contacted by SecurityMetrics."
1288,14," ""Enrolled"" means a Merchant that is currently enrolled to receive SecurityMetrics Services."
1288,15," ""No Response"" means a Merchant that, after repeated attempts by SecurityMetrics to contact, has not responded to any such 
communication efforts."
1288,16," First Data also rejects SecurityMetrics' reliance upon other provisions in the parties' earlier agreement. In First Data's view, 
Section 11.3.1 means merely that SecurityMetrics will not enroll new merchants after the termination of the contract. Similarly, it 
asserts [*24]  that paragraph 2 of the 2011 Amendment merely dealt with the re-enrollment or recertification of merchants, which 
was the purpose of the amendment. "
1289,17," Additionally, SecurityMetrics identifies further extrinsic evidence that it views as supporting its position, including the fact that 
(1) much of the Merchant Data was not provided by First Data but had been developed by SecurityMetrics; (2) that 
SecurityMetrics reported on enrolled and unenrolled merchants; (3) SecurityMetrics reduced its settlement demand in exchange 
for the Merchant Data provision in the Terms of Settlement. "
1290,18," The first modification addressed a typo, the second sought broader exceptions for the confidentiality provisions; [*30]  and the 
third sought to remove a provision from the venue clause."
1290,19," The only cases identified [*32]  by SecurityMetrics—and referenced by a ""Cf.""—are Murray v. State, 737 P.2d 1000 (Utah 
1987), and John Deere Co. v. A&H Equip., Inc., 876 P.2d 880, 883 (Utah App. 1994). In Murray, the defendant made an initial 
written offer of settlement. During a later phone call, plaintiff's counsel indicated that the plaintiff had accepted the offer and the 
defendant tendered a check. Several days later, the plaintiff changed her mind, refused the sign the settlement, and returned the 
check. As this summary should make clear, Murray is inapposite because in that case an acceptance preceded a rejection; 
SecurityMetrics, however, initially rejected the offer and subsequently wished to accept it. Similarly, in John Deere Co. v. A&H Equip., Inc., the defendant and counterclaimant A&H Equipment, Inc. initially proposed a 
settlement that would have released the parties' claims against each other. John Deere verbally accepted the settlement and 
then sent a letter indicating John Deere's acceptance. Subsequently, John Deere began preparing the settlement documents. "
1291,," Upon reviewing those documents, however, A&H refused to sign them because it claimed that it also sought release from a 
previous judgment entered against it payable to a related but independent third party. Again, in John Deere, the court ruled that 
an acceptance [*33]  had preceded a subsequent rejection."
1291,20," Additionally, First Data seeks injunctive relief under Count 4 for tortious interference on the basis of these marketing practices."
1291,21," First Data's Amended Complaint also makes reference to SecurityMetrics' marketing practices. See Am. Compl. ¶ 214. 
However, based upon First Data's representations in its papers, at the December 12, 2014 hearing, and the parties' resolution of 
First Data's Lanham Act claims, it appears to the Court that the only remaining theory of liability with respect to the tortious [*36]  
interference claim for damages relates to SecurityMetrics' reporting practices. "
1292,22," These arguments arise in SecurityMetrics Reply brief. See Reply 2-7, ECF No. 305. In its opening brief, SecurityMetrics also 
argued that First Data had failed to identify any relationship with which SecurityMetrics had interfered. The Court does not find 
this argument [*37]  to be persuasive because First Data has produced evidence that various merchants blamed First Data for 
delays in their compliance status reporting. Accordingly, First Data has provided evidence that there was, indeed, interference 
with First Data's relationships with third parties."
1292,23," Maryland law ""recognize[s] the doctrine of 'avoidable consequences' in tort actions-the duty to minimize damages-denying 
recovery of any damages that could have been avoided by reasonable conduct on the part of the plaintiff."" Jones v. Malinowski, 
299 Md. 257, 269, 473 A.2d 429 (1984)."
1292,24," Even if this Court were to find that the Terms of Settlement did not operate as such a release, SecurityMetrics' proximate 
cause argument does not entitle it to summary [*38]  judgment. Specifically, SecurityMetrics argues that the proximate cause of 
First Data's alleged damages was not SecurityMetrics' reporting; instead, SecurityMetrics argues that the proximate cause was 
First Data's repudiation of the contract and its failure to pay for continued START reporting. Thus, rather than alleging that the 
causal chain was broken, SecurityMetrics has posited that the causal chain reaches back further than First Data claims. Of 
course, proximate cause is traditionally a question of fact for the jury. See Lyon v. Campbell, 120 Md. App. 412, 431-32, 707 
A.2d 850 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1998) (""Tortious conduct may be the proximate cause of an injury without being its sole cause. To 
create a jury issue, a plaintiff need only introduce evidence to show that, more likely than not, the defendant's wrongful conduct 
caused the injury alleged. Under this standard of proof, the plaintiff is not required to exclude every possible cause of his 
injury.""(citations omitted)). Because First Data has demonstrated evidence directly linking SecurityMetrics' reporting practices to 
its claimed damages, this Court finds that summary judgment on the basis of lack of proximate cause is inappropriate. Similarly, the issue of reducing a damages award based upon the doctrine [*39]  of avoidable consequences is typically treated 
as a jury issue. See, e.g., 3 Stein on Personal Injury Damages Treatise § 18:4 (3d ed.) (""[W]hat is a reasonable effort to 
minimize damages in a given case will depend upon the particular circumstances and is ordinarily a question of fact for the 
jury.""). Finally, with respect to SecurityMetrics' arguments regarding proof of the elements of a tortious interference claim, 
SecurityMetrics asserts that First Data has failed to proffer ""evidence that SecurityMetrics' conduct is calculated to damage First 
Data or has an unlawful purpose."" This position ignores the undisputed fact that SecurityMetrics still generates START reporting 
and compliance report spreadsheets for ISOs. "
1294,25," SecurityMetrics suggests that First Data simply ignored the first statement identified by First Data (and particularly the 
statement that ""[t]he Compliance Service Fee is not affected by your choice to use a third-party vendor.""). In its papers, 
SecurityMetrics argued that First Data's motion should be denied to this first statement because ""First Data has not even 
addressed this other advertisement in its opening brief—and First Data should not be permitted to do so, for the first time, on 
reply."" Reply 6, ECF No. 298. SecurityMetrics reiterated this [*43]  position at the December 12, 2014 hearing. Considering that SecurityMetrics presented arguments regarding the first statement, it is clear that SecurityMetrics was aware 
that First Data's Motion was directed at both statements. Indeed, as First Data points out, First Data's motion cites to both 
statements, and the statements contain similar content. Considering that First Data had an opportunity to present argument on 
both statements in both its Response in Opposition and at the December 12, 2014 hearing, this Court will not deny First Data's 
Motion on these grounds."
1294,26," First Data has further contended that a merchant could receive such a refund only once. See Dec. 12, 2014 Hr'g Tr. 35: 1-13."
1294,27," Certainly, a case could easily exist where the determination of falsity would require determination by a jury. For example, had 
SecurityMetrics proffered evidence that First Data never charged the compliance fee despite its representations that it 
would, [*46]  a jury would need to make factual findings regarding First Data's billing practices and the truth or falsity of its 
statements in light of those practices. In a case such as this, however, where the facts are not disputed, there is no way that a 
reasonable jury could conclude that the statement is false on its face rather than simply misleading. "
1295,28," In its Response brief, SecurityMetrics baldly asserts that ""First Data's choice of 'PCI Rapid Comply'—not just its inclusion of 
'the acronym ""PCI""' in that name, but the name as a whole—does indeed falsely imply nonexistent endorsement by the PCI 
Security Standards Council."" SecurityMetrics' Resp. at 7-8. Nothing about the name ""PCI Rapid Comply,"" however, 
unambiguously implies such endorsement. If anything, the name is ambiguous; as such, SecurityMetrics is required to offer 
some extrinsic evidence—evidence which it has neither produced nor identified. "
1296,29," First Data has also argued that (1) the request for damages was not properly pled; (2) SecurityMetrics never timely supplied a 
calculation of its damages to First Data; and (3) the claimed damages are not causally tied to First Data's alleged conduct. "
1299,30," The only piece of evidence that SecurityMetrics identifies is the Declaration of Bradley Caldwell, in which Mr. Caldwell states 
that, with respect to SecurityMetrics' pricing, ""[m]ost commonly the price term is negotiated to about $2 per merchant, to 
compete with non-FDMS or third party providers such as Trustwave."" See SecurityMetrics' Resp. at Ex. C. ¶ 6, ECF No. 298-3."
1299,31," In finding that SecurityMetrics has failed to demonstrate any injury to competition that is actionable [*60]  under the antitrust 
laws, this Court makes no ruling on the various other arguments raised by First Data with respect to the specific antitrust claims 
and theories. Nevertheless, the Court notes that it is troubled by SecurityMetrics' attempted monopolization counterclaims; 
SecurityMetrics lacks any expert testimony to support its claim and it essentially seeks to disguise a variety of alleged business 
torts and Lanham Act violations as antitrust violations. See SecurityMetrics' Resp. at 27 (""The factual predicates for 
SecurityMetrics' attempted monopolization include (1) all those on which its other antitrust claims are based, (2) the defamation 
campaign discussed above in connection with SecurityMetrics' injurious falsehood claim, (3) the false advertising and 
endorsement claims discussed above in connection with SecurityMetrics' Lanham Act claims, (4) First Data's reckless instigation 
of a series of disingenuous legal proceedings having as their apparent object driving SecurityMetrics (First Data's only serious 
competitor for the 820,000 merchants at issue) from the field, and (5) First Data's ACF and associated refund policies. By that 
conduct, First Data has attempted to monopolize [*61]  the market for PCI compliance services provided to the 820,000 
merchants to which it provides both transaction processing and what it calls ""acquirer services,"" in violation of Section 2 of the 
Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, and Maryland Commercial Law Code § 11-204(a)(2).""). The Fourth Circuit has noted that such 
bootstrapping attempts warrant suspicion from the courts. See Military Servs. Realty, Inc. v. Realty Consultants of Virginia, LTD, 
823 F.2d 829, 832 n.4 (4th Cir. 1987) (""[C]ourts should be circumspect in converting ordinary business torts into violations of 
antitrust laws. To do so would be to create a federal common law of unfair competition which was not the intent of the antitrust 
laws."" (quoting Merkle Press, Inc. v. Merkle, 519 F. Supp. 50 (D. Md. 1981)). Such suspicion is certainly warranted in this case 
because First Data is already winding down the PCI Rapid Comply program, which was the primary basis of SecurityMetrics' 
other antitrust claims. Further complicating SecurityMetrics' attempt to recover its lost profits is the fact that SecurityMetrics' damages expert (Dr. 
Nelson) failed to disaggregate his damages calculations. Thus, failure on one of its counterclaims—or simply one of the theories 
posited in any of those various counterclaims— would give rise to serious issues regarding Dr. Nelson's calculations. See Mem. 
Op. Mots. In Limine at 24 n.27, ECF No. 313 (noting that failure to disaggregate [*62]  calculation of damages based upon 
claims becomes problematic after one or more theories of liability are eliminated from a case); see also Pharmanetics, Inc. v. 
Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 182 F. App'x 267 (4th Cir. May 31, 2006) (unpublished); Comcast Corp. v. Behrend,     U.S.

1322,1," Even were the court to find the language of paragraph 4.c ambiguous, the extrinsic evidence that DeBartolo cites does not 
illuminate the parties' intent concerning paragraph 4.c. The extrinsic evidence, which consists of a series of notes between Crain 
and DeBartolo during their state-court mediation, consists of four or five negotiating points that relate to other written parts of the 
Settlement Agreement. See Mediation Notes [D.E. 28-3] 1-8. The first three points on every version of the notes comport 
respectively with paragraphs 4, 4.a, and 4.b, and the remaining points relate to other sections. Compare Settlement Agreement 
2-3, with Mediation Notes 1-8. DeBartolo correctly states that the first point in each version is that ""[n]either party will take steps 
to remove the other from the patent."" Mediation Notes 3, 5, 7; see Mem. Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. 6. Although this language 
underscores the intent of the parties concerning [*10]  paragraph 4, the notes do not clarify any potentially ambiguous language 
contained in paragraph 4.c. Cf. Root, 272 N.C. at 587, 158 S.E.2d at 835 (noting the ""general rule"" that a written instrument's 
""terms may not be contradicted by parol or extrinsic evidence""). "
1323,2," The court rejects DeBartolo's objection that the settlement agreement makes joining Freaker USA futile. Freaker USA, like 
Crain, is not barred by the settlement agreement from bringing an action pursuant to section 256 to correct a purported error of 
inventorship. "
1325,3," DeBartolo also suggests that paragraph 4.a of the settlement agreement may violate N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-1. See Def.'s Resp. 
Mot. File Am. Compl. 5. ""Federal case law interpretations of the federal antitrust laws are persuasive authority in construing 
[North Carolina] antitrust statutes."" Hyde v. Abbott Lab., 123 N.C. App. 572, 578, 473 S.E.2d 680, 684 (1996); see Madison 
Cablevision, Inc. v. City of Morganton, 325 N.C. 634, 656, 386 S.E.2d 200, 213 (1989). Section 75-1 is nearly identical to section 
1 of the Sherman Act, although North Carolina law also prohibits agreements that ""violate[] the principles of the common law."" 
N.C. Gen. Stat. § 75-2. DeBartolo does not indicate any common law principle that paragraph 4.a of the settlement agreement 
violates. Thus, the court rejects DeBartolo's contention that the proposed amendment is futile based on North Carolina antitrust 
law. "
1334,1, Sabre implicitly adopts US Airways' definition for purposes of the motion by basing its arguments on that definition. 
1335,2," US Airways refers to this provision as the ""No Discount"" provision. For consistency, this Opinion uses the term ""Full Content"" 
throughout. "
1338,3," Professor McFadden estimates damages through October 31, 2012, although the Settlement Agreement became effective on 
October 30, 2012. This one day discrepancy is not material to the Court's analysis; at trial, however, US Airways may seek 
damages only for the period from February 23, 2011, up to and including October 30, 2012. See infra § III.B. "
1341,4," US Airways also seeks an injunction barring Sabre from enforcing the Contractual Restraints in the 2011 Agreement, which 
remains in force. Sabre argues that the doctrine of laches bars US Airways' request to enjoin Sabre from enforcing the 2011 
Agreement. Because Sabre's motion for summary judgment precluding injunctive relief is granted on account of the Settlement 
Agreement, the laches argument is moot. "
1345,5," US Airways concedes, however, that comparison booking cannot be as easily achieved without the ""one stop booking"" that 
Sabre offers. It argues that the absence of software enabling ""one stop booking"" is a result of Sabre's own ""stym[ing] [of] the 
deployment"" of such software."
1345,6," Sabre does not address causation or speculative damages within the rubric of standing. Because analysis of both factors is 
part of a standing analysis, the Court considers both factors in its discussion of standing. "
1347,7," Because US Airways does not have standing to pursue the Choice Seats claim, Sabre's alternative arguments for summary 
judgment on this claim are not addressed. "
1348,8," US Airways disputes that the Travelocity fees were paid under a separate agreement. It is undisputed, however, that the 
Travelocity fees are not addressed in the 2011 Agreement at issue here. "
1353,1," The artful pleading doctrine also applies when a state law claim is completely preempted by federal law, regardless of how the 
plaintiff has pled it. Lippitt, 340 F.3d at 1041. Synchrony does not argue that Elias's claims are completely preempted. "
1354,2," Synchrony attempts to link this argument to its contention that the existence of a duty of care turns on federal law by 
characterizing the negligence per se doctrine as ""substitut[ing] a legislatively or administratively defined duty of care in place of a 
general duty of care."" (Resp. at 12.) This is not accurate. The negligence per se doctrine is used to establish the existence of a 
breach, not a duty. See 6 Witkin, Summary 10th, Torts, § 873, p. 102 (2005) (""Either the courts or the Legislature must have 
created a duty of care. The presumption of negligence created by [California Evidence Code § 669, which codifies the 
negligence per se doctrine,] concerns the standard of care, rather than the duty of [*8]  care.""). "
1360,1," Relators appear to allege that Gilead at least partially disclosed the presence of ""degradation product(s)"" had been observed in 
one of its products in 2005. Id. ¶ 118. However, they contend that Gilead falsely represented the impurity was only seen when 
the drugs were stored in elevated temperature conditions. [*12]  Id. In fact, the impurity had been observed in drugs even stored 
in normal temperature conditions. Id. "
1361,2," According to the complaint, ""[f]or every released batch of API or finished drug product, manufacturers are required to create a 
Certificate of Analysis (""COA"") certifying that the batch was manufactured according to the specifications contained either in an 
Investigational New Drug (""IND"") application or in a New Drug Application (""NDA"")."" FAC ¶ 32. "
1364,3," The term ""certification"" in this context does not carry with it any talismanic significance, but is ""simply another [*28]  way of 
describing a false statement made to the government."" Gonzalez v. Planned Parenthood of L.A., No. CV 05-8818 AHM (FMOx), 
2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88495, 2012 WL 2412080, at *4 (C.D. Cal. June 26, 2012); see also United States v. Univ. of Phoenix, 
461 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir. 2006) (rejecting view that the ""word 'certification' has some paramount and talismanic 
significance""). "
1367,4," Liability based solely on cause-in-fact is not typical. Courts have implied limitations, such as requiring proximate cause, even 
where not expressly imposed by statute. See Paroline v. United States, 134 S. Ct. 1710, 1720, 188 L. Ed. 2d 714 (2014). Here, 
the FCA requires the fraudulent claim be presented ""for payment."" 31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1). "
1368,5," A drug can [*40]  be adulterated for any number of reasons, including contamination in the product; improper controls during 
manufacturing; or because it differs in strength, quality, or purity from its description in an ""official compendium."" See generally 
21 U.S.C. § 351."
1368,6," Relators have pointed to statements made by Gilead during the FDA approval process in which it certified that it would comply 
with ""all applicable laws"" including GMP regulations. For example, at the hearing Relators cited to the 2005 New Drug 
Application (""NDA"") for Gilead's drug ""Truvada."" At the end of this NDA, as with all NDAs, is a certification box which provides, in 
relevant part: I agree to update this application with new safety information about the product that may reasonably affect the statement of 
contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse reactions in the draft labeling. I agree to submit safety update reports 
as provided for by regulation or as requested by FDA. if this application is approved, I agree to comply with all applicable 
laws and regulations that apply to approved applications, including, but not limited to the following:"
1368,1," . Good manufacturing practice regulations in 21 CFR Parts 210, 211 or applicable regulations, Parts 606, and/or 820. Docket No. 105-18, at 4 (filed under seal). Relators contend this certification was false when made insofar as the FTC (the active 
ingredient of Truvada) was not being manufactured pursuant [*42]  to GMP regulations and was, in fact, adulterated with foreign 
substances. See FAC ¶¶ 105-29. While such statements made during the FDA approval process constitute certifications of 
regulatory compliance, the certification was not made as part of securing a payment. Relators point to nothing which indicates 
CMS conditioned payment on such certifications. "
1370,7," The limitations of the ""worthless services"" doctrine do not prevent an FCA claim for the sale of non-conforming goods to the 
government where, for example, there is a knowing breach of a material specification established by contract with the payor 
agency. See, e.g., Compton 142 F.3d at 304. "
1372,8," Gilead argues that the FAC contains insufficient [*56]  allegations that Mr. Campie did, in fact, engage in protected conduct. 
Insofar as Mr. Campie has indicated that he can provide further factual allegations on this point and he will need to amend his 
retaliation claims for the reason articulated in this order, the Court declines to address this argument until Mr. Campie has had 
an opportunity to include all pertinent factual allegations in an amended complaint. "
1373,9," The Court notes that Gilead moved to dismiss the various state law false claims act causes of action in a five sentence 
paragraph that failed to cite relevant case law from all of the affected states or otherwise attempted to support its contention that 
the state law claims should rise or fall with the federal claim. Gilead is advised, for purposes of any further proceeding, that the 
Court does not consider such a conclusory argument sufficient to actually present a ground for dismissing a cause of action. "
1387,1," Defendants cite Whirlpool Financial Corp. v. GH Holdings, 67 F.3d 605 (7th Cir. 2010), for the proposition that if information is 
available in the public domain, constructive knowledge of its cause of action should be imputed to a plaintiff. Whirlpool Financial, 
however, holds that ""once a plaintiff has been put on notice regarding the possibility of fraud,"" constructive [**15]  knowledge of 
publicly available information may be imputed to it. Here, I have concluded that plaintiff did not plead facts which would have put 
it on notice of defendant's allegedly fraudulent conduct. "

1402,1," For the purposes of Defendant's motions to dismiss, the Court assumes as true all well-pleaded allegations set forth in the 
amended complaint. See Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., 507 F.3d 614, 618 (7th Cir. 2007). "
1403,2," Elsewhere, the complaint similarly alleges that [b]y allowing Yankee to receive higher commissions on the sale of Amtrak tickets, Yankee is able to price independent 
tours and escorted tours more cheaply than other tour operators, thereby preventing all others from acting as effective 
competitors in that market by (a) discouraging passengers from purchasing leisure railway travel packages from tour 
operators other than Yankee, including VBR, and (b) discouraging travel agents from purchasing for their clients' leisure 
railway travel packages from tour operators other than Yankee, including VBR. Compl. at ¶¶ 113, 119, 137, 143. "
1406,3," Because Illinois law directs courts to ""use the construction of the federal law by the federal courts as a guide in construing"" the 
Illinois Antitrust Act ""when the wording [of the Act] is identical or similar to that of federal antitrust law"" (740 ILCS 10/11), courts 
have held that Illinois Antitrust Act claims ""will stand or fall"" with federal Sherman Act claims based on the same underlying facts 
and legal theories. Int'l Equip. Trading, Ltd. v. AB Sciex LLC, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 123109, 2013 WL 4599903, at *3 (N.D. Ill. 
Aug. 29, 2013). Accordingly, the Court's conclusion that the Sherman Act claims are subject to dismissal portends the same 
result for Plaintiff's state law claims under the Illinois Act. "
1414,1," The Court refers to the individual Plaintiffs and the IAM/IAMAW collectively as ""Plaintiffs"" and differentiates among them only 
as required."
1414,2," In their Complaint and Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs also alleged violations of Maine law regarding the timing of severance 
and vacation payments owed to Verso employees. Compl. ¶ 6. On January 6, 2015, the Court ruled on these issues in a

1415,3," On December 29, 2014, the United Steelworkers, on behalf of USW Local Union 4-01188 and 4-261 (USW) filed a motion for 
joinder. Mot. for Joinder as Pl. Filed by United Steelworkers (ECF No. 54). That same day, Plaintiffs filed their response in

1415,4," Although the parties submitted joint stipulations regarding certain facts and the authenticity and admissibility of certain exhibits, 
those stipulations only applied to the severance [**7]  and vacation pay claims. See Joint Stipulations Relating to Count 9 of the 
Compl.: Timely Payment of Severance and Vacation Pay (ECF No. 31); Joint Stipulation Regarding Authenticity and 
Admissibility of Exs. (ECF No. 47). Thus, in developing the factual background of this antitrust dispute, the Court relied on affidavits and pleadings. Int'l Paper Co. v. 
Inhabitants of the Town of Jay, 672 F. Supp. 29, 33 (D. Me. 1987) (HN1[
] ""Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a) does not require the Court to hold an evidentiary hearing before issuing a preliminary injunction. While an evidentiary hearing may be

Paper Co., 672 F. Supp. at 33). "
1416,5," The ECF and Plaintiffs' pagination in this motion differ. To maintain consistency, the Court has used the page number labeled 
by Plaintiffs. "
1418,6," Plaintiffs asserted in their motion that the closing was scheduled to occur no later than January 9, 2015. Pls.' Mot. at 1, 6. 
However, on December 24, 2014, Verso's counsel informed the Court during a telephone conference that the closing had been 
rescheduled to take place no earlier [**15]  than January 16, 2015. Minute Entry (ECF No. 41). Subsequently, on January 13, 
2015, Verso's counsel informed the Court during oral argument that it was his understanding that Verso was waiting for approval 
from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) before closing with AIM. Tr. of Proceedings 3:12-22. Although counsel 
indicated that he could not predict when FERC would issue a decision, he expected a decision to be issued soon, and requested 
the Court, if able, to issue a ruling on Plaintiffs' motion before January 19, 2015 so that Verso could close then. Id. 3:20-4:7. On 
January 15, 2015, Verso's counsel informed the Court that FERC issued its ruling authorizing the proposed deal between AIM 
and Verso. Letter from Attorney David E. Barry (ECF No. 89); id. Attach. 1 Order Authorizing Disposition of Jurisdictional 
Facilities (FERC Order). Based on counsel's comments during oral argument and the recent decision by FERC, this timetable 
explains Verso's urgency. "
1421,7," Plaintiffs note that because 10 M.R.S. § 1102-A is ""worded similarly,"" their analysis is the same for both section 1102-A and 
Section 7 of the Clayton Act. Pls.' Mot. at 10 n.10."
1421,8," Plaintiffs note that because 10 M.R.S. § 1102 is ""worded similarly,"" [**27]  their analysis is the same for both section 1102 and 
15 U.S.C. § 2. Pls.' Mot. at 12 n.15, 15 n.21."
1421,9," Plaintiffs note that because 10 M.R.S. § 1101 is ""worded similarly,"" their analysis is the same for section 1101 and 15 U.S.C. § 
1. Pls.' Mot. at 14 n.17."
1421,10, See supra note 8. 
1424,11," Verso also argues that the Court should apply the heightened standard for a mandatory preliminary injunction because 
Plaintiffs' requests go beyond preserving the status quo; instead, they seek ""affirmative action"" on the part of Verso. Verso's 
Opp'n at 5-7. "
1434,12," On January 16, 2015, Plaintiffs' counsel filed a letter to address questions he thought he had not adequately answered during 
oral argument. Additional Citations to Authorities by IAMAW (ECF No. 91) (Attorney Baker Letter). As regards ""antitrust standing 
for sellers of services,"" Attorney Baker cited In re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, 856 F. Supp. 2d 1103, 1123 (N.D. 
Cal. 2012) and Addamax Corp. v. Open Software Foundation, Inc., 888 F. Supp. 274, 280 (D. Mass. 1995) to support Plaintiffs' 
position. Attorney Baker Letter at 2. Plaintiffs direct the Court's attention to language in In re High-Tech Employee Antitrust 
Litigation where that court noted that ""it is not the status as a consumer or competitor that confers antitrust standing, but the 
relationship between the defendant's alleged unlawful conduct and the resulting harm to the plaintiff."" 856 F. Supp. 2d at 1123. This language does not support Plaintiffs' [**70]  position. The district court also stated that ""where . . . an employee is the direct 
and intended object of an employer's anticompetitive conduct, that employee has standing to sue for antitrust injury,"" Id. It cited 
several cases in support of this statement, including Eichorn. Id. For the reasons previously discussed, Plaintiffs have not 
demonstrated that they were ""the direct and intended object of"" Verso's alleged anticompetitive conduct. Plaintiffs also point to language in Addamax Corp. where that court stated that ""a seller to a collusive monopsony, has alleged 
sufficient antitrust injury, and has the standing necessary to bring this suit."" 888 F. Supp. at 280. Addamax Corp. is 
distinguishable, however, because Addamax was an ""independent developer[]"" that complained it lost out on a bid due to ""an 
illegal joint venture designed to influence the market for operating systems technology."" Id. at 277-78. In other words, Addamax 
was not complaining on the basis of its status as an employee of the defendants. "
1436,13," Although Verso argued in its opposition that the Court should apply the heightened standard for a mandatory preliminary 
injunction, the Court declines to decide this point as [**77]  it concluded that even without applying the higher standard, Plaintiffs' 
claims do not demonstrate a strong likelihood of success on the merits. "
1437,14," During oral argument, Plaintiffs' counsel was asked whether he had argued the relevance of a conglomerate merger or 
acquisition in his filings, to which he responded, ""yeah, we refer to Procter & Gamble Clorox in our brief . . . we may not have 
used the word conglomerate, for which I apologize."" Tr. of Proceedings 55:3-18. HN17[
] Mere citation to caselaw without 
articulating the applicable contention(s) is insufficient, and the Court will not predict counsel's arguments. See United States v. 
Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (""It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal [**81]  way, 
leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones. . . . Judges are not 
expected to be mindreaders. Consequently, a litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else 
forever holds its peace"") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). "
1451,1," This Court granted MacDermid's motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation 
claims. ECF No. 429."
1451,2," Cortron has not challenged the portion of the jury's verdict finding it liable for breach of contract. See Unredacted Mem. L. 
Supp. Renewed Mot. JMOL & New Tr. or Remit. (ECF No. 440), at 31. "
1452,3," Failure to raise a specific argument has been excused where the trial judge ""intervened and on his own discussed the . . . 
issue,"" which had already been raised on the ""summary judgment motion and . . . was the central issue at trial."" Gordon v. Cnty. 
of Rockland, 110 F.3d 886, 887 n.2 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Blockel v. J.C. Penney Co., 337 F.3d 17, 25 (1st Cir. 2003) (""[T]he 
district court foreclosed J.C. Penney's opportunity to make its arguments with any specificity. Under these circumstances J.C. 
Penney cannot be faulted for failing to provide more detail."")."
1452,4," The Court will discuss the state and federal antitrust counts together, as the Connecticut Antitrust Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 35-
24 to 35-46, generally is construed to follow federal antitrust law. Conn. Gen. Stat. § 35-44b (""It is the intent of the general 
assembly that in construing [the Connecticut Antitrust Act] the courts of this state shall be guided by interpretations given by the 
federal courts to federal antitrust statutes.""). The primary difference pertinent to this case is that for federal liability, a plaintiff 
must also show an effect on interstate commerce, an issue that has not been challenged by Cortron. "
1455,5," Although Cortron did not specifically challenge MacDermid's proof of the ""relevant market"" in the directed verdict colloquy, its 
broader challenge to the proof of an anticompetitive effect, in light of more specific arguments about the relevant market raised 
earlier in its Daubert motion, can arguably be construed as raising the issue [*23]  of the relevant market definition. "
1457,6," See Imbrogno v. Chamberlin, 89 F.3d 87, 90 (2d Cir. 1996) (""In deciding remittitur motions in diversity cases, federal courts 
apply federal procedural standards and state substantive law.""); Baker v. Coughlin, 77 F.3d 12, 15 (2d Cir. 1996) (""In applying 
pendent jurisdiction, federal courts are bound to apply state substantive law to the state claim.""). "
1460,7," Dr. Levinsohn's testimony supported this request. Trial Tr. 743-44 (""[T]he agreement between DuPont and Cortron, violated the 
term of a contract. . . . So the damages associated with that are exactly the same as the damages that went along with the first 
claim. It's also my understanding that the misappropriation of trade secrets, same act, violated a contract. So damages for the 
same act are the same.""); [*40]  833-34 (Q. ""And with regard to the antitrust damages and the contract damages, in your direct 
you kind of summarized your contract damages and said they're essentially the same as the antitrust number and the trade 
secret number?"" A. ""That's correct.""). "
1464,8," Restitutionary damages are available here even though the jury awarded the $3.91 million for destruction of trade secrets 
under the CUTPA count rather than the CUTSA count. CUTPA authorizes restitutionary measures of damages equal to the 
defendant's unjust enrichment. Grand Light & Supply Co. v. Honeywell, Inc., 771 F.2d 672, 681 n.3 (2d Cir. 1985) (""Damages 
under CUTPA are to be measured according to a restitution formula rather than according to contract principles.""); F.T.C. v. 
Verity Int'l, Ltd., 443 F.3d 48, 67 (2d Cir. 2006) (""The appropriate measure for restitution is the benefit unjustly received by the 
defendants.""). "
1465,9," The court analyzed these factors in the context of a CUTPA claim, but nothing about the court's reasoning suggests that the 
factors are any less applicable to a CUTSA claim. "

1472,1," The SAC was erroneously docketed as an ""Amended Answer."" (See Docket No. 43.)"
1472,2," As explained, this narrowing became necessary in light of the deposition testimony of Plaintiff's expert, who conceded that his 
opinion applied only to earlier pin-on-glass replacement window regulators rather than later-developed ""service kit"" 
replacements. (Id. at 5-6.)"
1472,3," The Court previously identified only four Part Numbers. The parties' summary judgment submissions make clear that the eight 
specified Part Numbers are at issue. (Cf. Docket No. 147 at 8 & n.6.) "
1473,4," The offer extends only to vehicles built on or after March 15, 2006; however, for ease of reference, the parties, and now the 
Court, refer to these vehicles [*7]  as MY 2006-07 vehicles. (See Motion at 1 n.1.) "
1475,5," ""Daubert's general holding . . . applies not only to testimony based on 'scientific' knowledge, but also to testimony based on 
'technical' and 'other specialized' knowledge."" Kumho Tire, 526 U.S. at 141. "
1476,6," At the hearing, defense counsel pointed out that the specific part purchased by Plaintiff Doyle passed the ""heat creep"" test to 
which the it was subjected. (See Radyko [*17]  Decl. (Docket No. 159-1) ¶¶ 5-6.) Moreover, Dr. Batzer himself acknowledged 
that the methodology of that ""heat creep"" test was sound. (Batzer Depo. at 161.) Nevertheless, although this specific test 
supports Chrysler's position, it does not wholly negate Dr. Batzer's overarching opinion regarding the allegedly defective material 
used in manufacturing the lift-plate mechanisms of the replacement window regulators. "
1477,7," Two exhibits offered by Plaintiff Doyle are not relevant to his claims. As argued in the Reply, one of the two ""Quality and 
Product Engineering Analysis Report"" is an earlier draft of the other; the later draft reveals it relates not to the ""pin-on-glass"" 
design at issue in the present action. (Reply at 3-4; Barteau Decl. Exs. 4 & 7.) Another exhibit is of marginal probative value. Plaintiff Doyle also offers a summary prepared from a database maintained by 
Chrysler of customer complaints made to dealers. (Barteau Decl. Ex. 1.) The summary provides some (but not all) details from 
fifteen entries in that database which reference Part No. 68059645AA in the ""cause"" field of the entry. (Id.; cf. D'Aunoy Decl. 
(Docket No. 191) ¶¶ [*20]  3-5 & Ex. A (details of the fifteen entries).) Chrysler correctly points out that these complaints do not 
identify failure of the lift plate as a result of heat creep associated with the relevant part number as being the cause of a 
customer's complaint. (Id. ¶ 8; Reply at 2-3.) Moreover, Chrysler presents evidence that all these entries relate to 2006-2007 
MYs, and Plaintiff Doyle's vehicle is a 2005 MY. (D'Aunoy Decl. ¶ 7.) Nevertheless, these entries are examples of the type of 
product failures associated with Plaintiffs' defect theory; as such, they are not wholly irrelevant."
1477,8," Where the parties agree to relevant facts, the Court cites to Plaintiff Doyle's Statement of Genuine Issues (""SGI""). (Docket No. 
181.) "
1478,9," Chrysler implicitly urges the Court to disregard these documents because Plaintiff Doyle does not specifically cite them in his 
Opposition brief. (See Reply at 2 n.2 (referring to Barteau Decl. Ex. 2).) The Court considers these documents because they are 
offered as evidence and they are referenced [*22]  in Plaintiff Doyle's SGI. (See SGI at ¶¶ 3-4 & 6.) Therefore, the Court 
assumes Plaintiff Doyle's failure to focus any his arguments on these documents is inadvertent. These documents are evidence 
that support Plaintiff Doyle's theory of defect, but they are not dispositive. "
1479,10," At the hearing on this matter, defense counsel acknowledged that the defect opinions of Dr. Batzer were sufficient to raise a 
triable issue of fact if the Court viewed those opinions as applying to the specific part numbers at issue. "
1497,1," Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 78(b) and Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the Court finds this motion appropriate for 
decision without oral argument. "

1510,1," Because several members of the families share the same last name, we refer to them by their first names for convenience and 
clarity. (See Jones v. ConocoPhillips Co. (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 1187, 1191, fn. 1, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 571.) "
1511,2, The Rhoads family claims Margolis concealed from it his intention to [*7]  assign the agreement to Dakota. 
1512,3," Dakota employee Anthony DiAntonio submitted a declaration in opposition to the special motion to [*9]  strike confirming that 
Miller had initially approved the use of the Dakota materials in preparation of a book anticipated as a ""companion piece to the 
documentary . . . ."""
1512,4," The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed a cause of action for misappropriation of Randy's name and likeness under Civil Code 
section 3344.1. "
1514,5," There have been numerous biographical works written about Randy that were neither endorsed nor challenged by the Rhoads 
family. "
1516,6," With respect to materials obtained from the Rhoads family pursuant to the Margolis-Rhoads agreement, the DiAntonio 
declaration identifies several ""personal family photographs"" provided by Kathryn, two featured quotes from an interview with 
Delores on June 25, 2007, photographs of the family visiting Randy's grave on July 30, 2007, and photographs resulting from 
access to some of Randy's equipment that may never have been publicly shown. Kathryn and Kelle assert they recognize some 
statements in the book as ones they made during their interviews for the documentary. The Rhoads family may not recover, 
however, for the use of materials gathered by Dakota in the course of preparing the documentary that did not come [*23]  from 
Delores, Kathryn or Kelle. For instance, the rights to photographs or statements made by people who knew Randy may belong 
to Dakota, but those materials fall outside the scope of the Margolis-Rhoads agreement itself."
1516,7," Margolis contends he acted solely as an editor on the book and thus cannot be liable for any decision as to which materials 
were used or how they were obtained. This distinction also requires a factual inquiry more appropriate for the finder of fact. "
1518,8," As we explained in Klein v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at page 1376 and footnote 14, although there is 
currently a split of authority with respect to the proper definition of the term ""unfair"" in the context of [*32]  consumer cases 
arising under the UCL, the Second District has consistently followed the definition enunciated by Division Eight of this court in 
Camacho v. Automobile Club of Southern California (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1403, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770. "
1519,9," Because the Rhoads family's claims for misappropriation under Civil Code section 3344 and the common law fail as a matter of 
law, its effort to plead a UCL claim under the ""unlawful"" prong based on misappropriation also fails."
1519,10," DiAntonio offers his opinion that many of those interviewed for the documentary did so because they believed the project had 
the approval of the Rhoads family, but provides no evidence that any of those [*34]  individuals have objected to their depiction 
in the book. The Rhoads family has presented no evidence the book has misled anyone, particularly within the avid, but 
relatively small, community of Randy's fans. According to Klein, he has on occasion been asked whether the family has 
endorsed the book and has denied such endorsement. "
1520,*," Judge of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, section 6 of the California 
Constitution. "
1523,1," This section comes from the First Amended Complaint, [**3]  which details the challenged GM plan and also includes attached 
exhibits obtained from GM and All Star through discovery."
1523,2," Although Bump the Competition has been in existence since 2009, the examples Felder's provides in the complaint are not 
based on actual sales or transactions."
1523,3," The state claims are for violations of the Louisiana antitrust laws, the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act, as well as a 
conspiracy claim for joint and solidary liability pursuant to Louisiana Civil Code article 2324. "
1524,4," Felder's sued General Motors; All Star Automotive Group, which includes All Star Advertising Agency, Inc., All Star Chevrolet, 
Inc., and All Star Chevrolet North, L.L.C.; and 25 John Doe Defendants. For clarity, the All Star and John Doe Defendants are 
collectively referred to as All Star."
1524,5," And failure to plead a state or federal antitrust conspiracy required dismissal of the remaining solidary liability claim under 
Louisiana law."
1524,6," The Automotive Body Parts Association filed an amicus curiae raising the issue of monopoly leveraging in which a 
monopolist—in this case, GM—is able to leverage profits from goods on which it holds a monopoly to cover losses arising from 
the below-cost sale of another good for which it does not have a monopoly. The amicus argues primarily that the use of average 
variable cost as the ""appropriate measure"" may be erroneous, stating that ""where a monopolistic leverage is used to decrease a 
predator's overall costs, courts ought to consider those fixed costs which are being covered by the illegal leverage."" Amicus Br. 
at 7 (quoting David M. Magness, Comment, Getting Past Summary Judgment in Predatory Pricing Cases After American 
Airlines: Will Post-Chicago Analysis Ever Prevail?, 5 Hous. Bus. & Tax L.J. 421, 449 (2005)). The amicus, however, is ""limited to 
the issue of pricing and costs and the effect that timing and monopoly leveraging may have on whether costs are classified as 
fixed or variable in the determination of appropriate measure of cost and variable cost."" Id. at 13. It does not characterize 
Felder's claims as one for monopoly leveraging, and Felder's does not raise this claim and [**10]  its complaint does not allege 
that GM prices below any measure of costs. "
1525,7," They provided the following explanation for why marginal cost is the best measure: ""Under conditions of perfect competition, a 
firm always maximizes profits (or minimizes losses) by producing that output at which its marginal cost equals the market price."" 
88 HARV. L. REV. at 702. Because rational firms attempt to maximize profits or minimize losses, a firm selling at a ""shortrun profit-
maximizing (or loss-minimizing) price is clearly not a predator."" Id. at 703. On the other hand, ""a firm producing at an output 
where marginal cost exceeds price is selling at least part of that output at an out-of-pocket loss."" Id. at 712. ""A monopolist pricing 
below marginal cost should be presumed to have engaged in a predatory or exclusionary practice"" because ""[t]he monopolist is 
not only incurring private [**13]  losses but wasting social resources when marginal costs exceed the value of what is produced. 
And pricing below marginal cost greatly increases the possibility that rivalry will be extinguished or prevented for reasons 
unrelated to the efficiency of the monopolist."" Id. "
1526,8," Felder's allegations [**15]  seem to limit All Star's costs to the purchase price of the parts from GM, without including other 
potentially variable costs for each unit of sale. Notably, however, Felder's assumes that All Star is making a profit on each sale 
after the rebate is included. And at the Rule 12 stage, we review only the allegations that a plaintiff makes; we cannot speculate 
about costs it may have missed. There is no allegation that All Star is pricing below average variable cost if the rebate is 
considered."
1526,9," Felder's may have gotten this impression from the district court's discussion of rebate cases, which the district court read for 
the proposition that ""price is measured after considering any discounts or rebates."" Id. at 635 (citing A.A. Poultry Farms, Inc. v. 
Rose Acre Farms, Inc., 881 F.2d 1396, 1407 (7th Cir. 1989)). As discussed below, All Star is receiving the rebate as a purchaser 
of parts from GM, so it makes the most sense to read the district court's opinion as viewing the rebate as a reduction in the cost 
of acquiring the parts. "
1527,10," Felder's makes no mention of whether it sells parts other than GM-equivalent parts, which is relevant to whether Felder's can 
stay in business in spite of All Star's lower prices. "

1548,1," As detailed infra, these agreements were entered into by Defendant, Cephalon, Inc. (""Cephalon""), the brand-name 
manufacturer of Provigil, and the following Defendant generic drug manufacturers: Barr Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Barr""); Mylan 
Laboratories, Inc. and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively ""Mylan""); Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. and Teva 
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (collectively ""Teva""); and Ranbaxy Laboratories, Ltd. and Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively 
""Ranbaxy"") (collectively referred to as the ""Generic Defendants"")."
1548,2," All facts are undisputed, unless otherwise noted, and disputed facts are viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs—the 
non-moving parties. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). "
1549,3," The FDA publishes a list of all patents covering a drug under which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be 
asserted in the ""Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations"" publication, also known as the Orange 
Book. Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd., 527 F.3d at 1282. "
1550,4," The same facts and defenses raised by the Generic Defendants in their Paragraph IV litigation were later presented to this 
Court in the Apotex v. Cephalon patent litigation, resulting in the RE '516 patent being declared invalid and unenforceable. (See 
Pls.' Comb. SUF ¶¶ 8-28); Apotex, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125859, 2011 WL 6090696 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 7, 
2011) aff'd, 500 Fed. Appx. 959 (Fed. Cir. 2013). "
1551,5, Naltrexone is a drug used to treat alcoholism. (Mylan SUF ¶ 37.)
1551,6, Fentanyl is a pain medication primarily used with cancer patients. (Id. at ¶ 53.)
1551,7," Defendants argue that the Collaboration Agreement and Option [**35]  and Exclusivity Agreement (described infra) cannot be 
characterized as part of the settlement agreement. However, Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury 
to determine that the three contracts were separate pieces of one cohesive agreement, and that the product development 
agreements were necessary to the settlement. (See Letter Decl., Ex. 120 (Cephalon emailing the three agreements to Mylan for 
signature on the same date, insisting that all three be signed prior to a press release scheduled for the following morning); 
Bazerman Exp. Rep., Apr. 21, 2011, ¶ 40 (""the Cephalon/Mylan agreements would not have occurred at the same time if the 
contemporaneous business transactions were independent of the patent settlement"").) "
1552,8," Although the ChemAgis supply agreement was signed as a separate agreement, it had originally been included within the 
settlement agreement between Cephalon and Barr. The API supply agreement was excised and written separately pursuant to a 
change requested by Barr. (Pls.' Comb. SUF ¶¶ 270-71.) In light of this evidence and the simultaneous signatures required by 
the parties, a reasonable jury could find that the ChemAgis and Perrigo agreements were necessary parts of the settlement 
agreement between Cephalon and Barr."
1552,9," Cephalon, Barr and Teva suggest that there exists a ""special,"" heightened standard of review for motions for summary 
judgment in the antitrust context. The cases that these Defendants cite refer to the limited inferences that may be drawn from 
ambiguous, circumstantial evidence in establishing concerted action, and that summary judgment may not be thwarted by 
economically senseless theories. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Svc., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 468-69, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 
119 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1992); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587-88, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. 
Ed. 2d 538 (1986); Race Tires Am., Inc. v. Hoosier Racing Tire Corp., 614 F.3d 57, 73 (3d Cir. 2010); see also In re Flat Glass "
1553,," Antitrust Litig., 385 F.3d 350, 357-58 (3d Cir. 2004). Plaintiffs have presented direct evidence of concerted action through the 
settlement agreements between [**40]  Cephalon and each of the Generic Defendants, and Defendants have not challenged 
Plaintiffs' ability to meet the concerted action requirement on these claims. Furthermore, the Supreme Court and United States 
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit have made clear that ""[t]he traditional summary judgment standard applies with equal force 
in antitrust cases[.]"" Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co., 37 F.3d 996, 1001 (3d Cir. 1994) (citing Eastman Kodak, 504 
U.S. at 468)."
1553,10," Paddock was paid $12 million; Par Pharmaceuticals, which joined forces with Paddock, was paid $60 million; and Actavis was 
paid $19-$30 million annually for a total of nine years. Id. at 2229. "
1554,11," I note that at oral argument, Barr acknowledged that a showing of large and unjustified may be part of Plaintiffs' initial burden 
under the rule of reason. In any event, Barr argued that Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden, regardless of whether or not it 
is presented as a ""threshold burden"" prior to the application of the rule of reason. (Oral Arg. Tr., pp. 16-19.) "
1555,12," The private Plaintiffs argue that even if they do not satisfy their burden under Actavis, summary judgment may not be granted 
on their challenges to the settlement agreements due to their allegations of fraud in the procurement of Cephalon's patent. They 
assert that proof of Walker Process fraud renders the settlement agreements per se violations of the Sherman Act, and thus, 
evidence of fraud [**50]  is sufficient to deny summary judgment. The Generic Defendants respond that they may not be held 
liable under the antitrust laws for Cephalon's fraud. I need not address this issue at this time because, as detailed infra, I find 
that Plaintiffs have provided sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment under Actavis. "
1558,13," I recognize that Plaintiffs' experts Hartman, Noll and Elhauge are the subject of Daubert motions filed by Defendants (see 
""Joint Motion to Exclude Damages Opinions of Plaintiffs' Experts Drs. Hartman, Leffler, Leitzinger and Noll""; ""Defendants' Motion 
to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiffs' Proposed Economic Experts""). These motions do not assert that Plaintiffs' experts 
understate the Generic Defendants' expected profits—in fact, the motion to exclude these experts' damages opinions appears to 
argue the opposite. Therefore, I will consider these figures in deciding the summary judgment motions currently before me."
1558,14," Similarly, Defendants have not challenged the Plaintiffs' ability to demonstrate monopoly power on its conspiracy to 
monopolize claims. See Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech. Svc., Inc., 504 U.S. 451, 481, 112 S. Ct. 2072, 119 L. Ed. 2d 265 
(1992) (a plaintiff asserting a claim for monopolization must establish (1) monopoly power in the relevant market; and (2) 
anticompetitive conduct). "
1559,15," I also disagree with Defendants' contention that Plaintiffs must establish that the value Cephalon received from the goods and 
services was grossly inadequate, [**65]  and the transactions were a complete sham, in order to demonstrate that the reverse 
payments were unjustified. Cephalon, Barr and Teva urge that American Motor Inns, Inc. v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 521 F.2d 1230 
(3d Cir. 1975) prohibits the ""second guessing"" of complex business agreements. I do not read American Motors that 
expansively. See id. at 1248-50 (finding that the availability of alternative means of achieving a defendant's stated business 
purpose does not automatically render the agreement unlawful; rather, courts should determine whether the restriction was 
""fairly necessary in the circumstances of the particular case"")."
1559,16," This evidence distinguishes Plaintiffs' expert reports from the cases cited by Ranbaxy, wherein the plaintiffs relied upon expert 
opinions that were not based upon facts in the record. See In re Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d 112, 135 (3d Cir. 1999) 
(quoting Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 242, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993)) 
(""When an expert opinion is not supported by sufficient facts to validate it in the eyes of the law, or when indisputable record 
facts contradict or otherwise render the opinion unreasonable, it cannot support a jury's verdict""); Advo, Inc. v. Phila. 
Newspapers, Inc., 51 F.3d 1191, 1198 (3d Cir. 1995) (finding that expert opinions could not subvert summary judgment in 
predatory pricing case where there was no direct evidence of predatory pricing). "

1576,4," Federal Rule of Evidence 201 authorizes a court to ""judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute [**20]  
because it . . . can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned . . . at 
any stage in the proceeding,"" including on a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Kramer v. Time Warner Inc., 937 F.2d 767, 773 (2d 
Cir. 1991) (""Of course,"" a district court ""may . . . consider matters of which judicial notice may be taken under Fed. R. Evid. 201"" 
on a motion to dismiss.). Accordingly, the Court takes judicial notice of the settlements and penalties involving Defendants based 
on various government agencies' press releases and the underlying orders ""whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned"" 
and which resulted from the investigations described in the U.S. Complaint. See, e.g., McLoughlin v. People's United Bank, Inc., 
586 F. Supp. 2d 70, 73 (D. Conn. 2008) (""The Court may take judicial notice of the press releases of government agencies""

1602,35," As set forth in the Background section, the ""non-covered items"" language appears in the top portion of the Agreement, which 
refers to the ""following products/services,"" and is followed by a specific charge: Provider agrees to accept the Adjusted Price listed below less any deductible, coinsurance, and non-covered items, if 
applicable, as payment in full for the following [*15]  products/services that have been or will be provided to the above-
referenced patient. Date of Product/Service Provider's List Price "
1603,, Adjusted Price
1603,1," /13/2008 to 1/13/2008 $128,733.33 $106.205.00 As the emphasis indicates, the ""less any . . . non-covered items"" language seems to apply to the specific ""Product/Service"" listed 
in the Agreement — a January 13, 2008 treatment with a Provider's List Price of $128,733.33. That language operates separately from the language covering other charges, which is seen in the second cutout in the 
Background section: Provider agrees to accept a 17.5% discount from their List Price as the Adjusted Price for all invoices with a date of 
service on or after 01/13/2008 and for any unpaid invoices prior to 01/13/2008 which are not listed above. Notably, while this second portion sets out price terms for post-January 13 treatments, and indicates that it covers items not 
listed above, it says nothing about excluding payments for ""non-covered items."" So, as a matter of contract interpretation, 
CGLIC's argument — that the Agreement precludes payments on ""non-covered items"" for all of the treatments, rather than just 
the January 13 treatment — is not clearly supported by the Agreement's language. Indeed, CGLIC tacitly acknowledges this by the way its briefing tortures the contractual terms. At page 7 of its Motion, for 
example, CGLIC describes the contract as follows: The Viant Agreement obligates IV Solutions to accept the ""Adjusted Price,"" a ""17.5% discount from their list price,"" ""less 
any deductible, coinsurance, and non-covered items, if applicable, as payment in full for the products/services that have or 
will be provided to"" D.G. ""subject to all terms and conditions of the [Plan]."" Mot. at 7:9-13. To read the contract in this fashion, the first clause begins by quoting language from the bottom portion of the Agreement, which 
addresses invoices for services other than those ""listed above"" (""The Viant Agreement obligates IV Solutions to accept the 
Adjusted Price,' a '17.5% discount from their list price . . .""). Without any indication that it was jumping to a different section of the contract, the second clause quotes from the top of the 
Agreement, which is discussing terms for the ""following products/services,"" while specifically-identifying a January 13 charge. 
(""less any deductible, coinsurance, and non-covered items if applicable, as payment in full for the . . . products/services that 
have or will be provided to 12). [D.G.]"") In so doing, this clause uses ellipses to turn ""less any deductible, coinsurance, and non-
covered items, if applicable, as payment in full for the for the following products/services that have been or will be provided to 
[D.G.],"" into ""less any deductible, coinsurance, and non-covered items, if applicable, as payment in full for the ... 
products/services that have been or will be provided to [D.G.]."" Finally, CGLIC jumps back down to the disclaimer for the third clause, and in the process, substitutes ""policy,"" which would 
seem inapplicable to its argument, for ""Plan,"" which is more consonant (subject to the all terms and conditions of the [Plan]""). "

1612,64," Even were this not the case, CGLIC's implied-covenant claim would also fail for two reasons. First, HN21[
] while the implied 
covenant exists to supplement a contract's existing terms, it ""cannot impose substantive duties or limits on the contracting 
parties beyond those incorporated in the specific terms of their agreement."" Guz v. Bechtel Nat. Inc., 24 Cal.4th 317, 349-50, 
100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089 (2000); McClain v. Octagon Plaza, LLC, 159 Cal.App.4th 784, 806, 71 Cal. Rptr. 3d 885 
(2008) (stating that, ""because [the implied covenant] protects only the express terms of the agreement, it cannot impose 
substantive duties or limits on the contracting parties beyond those incorporated in the specific terms of their agreement""). Here, 
if collecting copayments is not an express condition of the Agreement, imposing it through the implied covenant would 
contravene the prohibition against rewriting contracts through the implied covenant. Vikco Ins. Servs., Inc. v. Ohio Indem. Co., 
70 Cal.App.4th 55, 70, 82 Cal. Rptr. 2d 442 (1999) (""The courts will not imply a better agreement for parties than they 
themselves have been satisfied to enter into, or rewrite contracts whenever they operate harshly""); Series AGI W. Linn of Appian 
Grp. Investors DE LLC v. Eves, 217 Cal.App.4th 156, 169, 158 Cal. Rptr. 3d 193 (2013) (same). Second, CGLIC cites Kennedy and the Plan when arguing that it had ""a legitimate expectation that IV Solutions would bill 
D.G[.]""64 But ""[t]he covenant of good faith is read into contracts in order to protect the express covenants or promises of the 
contract, not to protect some general public policy interest not directly tied to the contract's purposes."" Foley v. Interactive Data 
Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654, 690, 254 Cal. Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373 (1988). By citing Kennedy and the Plan, rather than express terms 
of the Agreement, CGLIC's argument seems to be (though it is not actually fleshed out either way) that its implied-copayment-
condition would protect some general policy in favor of requiring providers to collect co-payments, rather than some express 
condition of the Agreement. But, again, that is not why the implied covenant exists. Carma Developers (Cal.), 2 Cal.4th at 373 
(""It is universally recognized the scope of conduct prohibited by the covenant of good faith is circumscribed by the purposes and 
express terms of the contract"")."
1612,65," As stated above, CGLIC's UCL-fraud theory rests on an entirely unpled premise, and therefore cannot support summary 
judgment would still be proper. CGLIC's briefing argues that it is entitled to invoke a ""consumer"" unfairness test because its co-
payment theory involves a significant public interest, summary judgment. See Section 3.2.1, supra. As a result, the Court only 
discusses CGLIC's unfair and unlawful theories. Also, CGLIC's argument that the named plaintiff in a post-Prop 64 UCL-fraud 
case need not show reliance and causation is wrong. See, e.g., In re Tobacco II Cases, 46 Cal.4th 298, 326, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 
559, 207 P.3d 20 (2009) (""Therefore, we conclude that this language imposes an actual reliance requirement on plaintiffs 
prosecuting a private enforcement action under the UCL's fraud prong""); Hall v. Time Inc., 158 Cal. App. 4th 847, 859, 70 Cal. 
Rptr. 3d 466 (2008) (""[T]he representative UCL plaintiff must plead he or she suffered an injury in fact caused by, or in justifiable 
reliance on, the alleged acts of unfair competition""). Schnall v. Hertz Corp., 78 Cal.App.4th 1144, 93 Cal. Rptr. 2d 439 (2000), a 
pre-Prop 64 case, is no longer good law on the point for which CGLIC cites it. As the California Supreme Court explained in 
Tobacco II Cases, Prop 64 ""impose[d] an actual reliance requirement on plaintiffs prosecuting a private enforcement action 
under the UCL's fraud prong"" (although, in a class action, unnamed class members (debatably) need not show reliance or 
causation). "
1613,66," Some courts have held that a practice is unfair only if it offends a public policy ""tethered to specific constitutional, statutory, or

unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers"" and the ""gravity of the harm"" outweighs the ""utility of the defendant's 
conduct."" Id. (collecting cases, citations omitted). Still others measure unfairness through a three-part test: ""(1) the consumer

See IVS Mot. at 17:23-25; Docket No. 113, Ex. A. Nonetheless, it is clear from the record that CGLIC is neither a competitor nor 
consumer — a fact CGLIC ostensibly concedes by attempting to invoke D.G.'s interest in the matter in its effort to rely on a UCL 
""consumer"" test. "
1614,70," Adopting this rationale, several courts have relied on Linear Tech. to reject UCL claims under largely similar circumstances. 
See [*41]  Sacramento E.D.M, Inc., 965 F.Supp.2d at 1154 (dismissing UCL claim where it ""arose out of [Plaintiffs'] business

Antitrust Litig., 695 F.Supp.2d at 999 (""The allegations [in the] complaint fundamentally sound in contract and do not allege facts 
sufficient to demonstrate a connection to the protection of the public. The Court finds the allegations to be insufficient to 
establish the requisite public or individual consumer interest as required under California law.""); Dollar Tree Stores Inc. v. 
Toyama Partners LLC, 875 F.Supp.2d 1058, 1083 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (finding that breach of lease could not support a UCL claim 
under Linear Tech. where it was ""based on a breach of a contract that does not implicate the public in general or individual 
consumers""); In re ConocoPhillips Co. Serv. Station Rent Contract Litig., No. 09-CV-2040-RMW, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40471, 
at *10-*11 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 13, 2011) (""Plaintiffs' relationship with defendant is defined by their contractual arrangement. The case 
does not involve the general public or individual consumers who are parties to a contract . . . . Under [Linear Tech], plaintiffs 
cannot assert an 'unfair business practice' claim under Section 17200.""). See also Gallucci v. Los Angeles SMSA Ltd. P'ship, 
2013 WL 5536373 (Cal. Ct. App. Oct. 8, 2013) (unpublished/nonbinding) (""[O]ther than a 'Cel-Tech' claim between competitors, 
the unfair competition law has no application in commercial disputes between two businesses. Where a UCL action is based on 
contracts not involving either the public in general or individual consumers who are parties to the contracts, a corporate plaintiff 
may not rely on the UCL for the relief it seeks. Plaintiffs are not consumers. Instead, they allege a business dispute with 
defendants. Thus, the UCL does not apply here."")(citing and quoting Linear Tech. Corp., 152 Cal.App.4th at 135)."
1614,71," At a certain level, the Court has doubts about Linear Tech's provenance. The case relies on Rosenbluth Int'l, Inc. v. Superior 
Court, a split, pre-Proposition 64 case which grounds its holding in the language of the then-existing standing provision, Cal. 
Bus. & Prof. Code § 17204, and to a lesser extent, due process concerns specific to representative actions. See 101 
Cal.App.4th 1073, 1075, 1077-79, 124 Cal. Rptr. 2d 844 (2002). Nonetheless, Linear Tech's language is clear, and CGLIC has 
not attempted to counter its holding or rationale. Absent some countervailing appellate-level (or higher) authority, or a convincing 
reason why Linear Tech. should not apply, the Court should follow Linear Tech. and conclude that CGLIC's UCL ""unfair"" claim 
fails as a matter of law. See Lewis v. Tel. Employees Credit Union, 87 F.3d 1537, 1545 (9th Cir. 1996) (""When interpreting state 
law, federal courts are bound by decisions of the state's highest court. In the absence of such a decision, a federal court must

substantial rights. Even after a reviewing court finds plain error under this three-part rubric, relief remains discretionary under 
Olano's fourth and final requirement. The Court of Appeals should correct a plain forfeited error affecting substantial rights if the

1632,7," A number of courts have referred to the FTAIA as jurisdictional, but did so prior to the Supreme Court's decisions in Reed 
Elsevier and Morrison and without analyzing whether the FTAIA concerns subjectmatter jurisdiction or the scope of coverage of 
antitrust laws. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 326 F.3d 1319, 1329-30 (11th Cir. 2003); Dee-K Enters., Inc. v. Heveafil

2012) (""sav[ing] the resolution of this issue for another day"" post-Morrison). "
1634,8," The Third Circuit also addressed the import trade exclusion, holding that it applies to importers and to defendants whose 
""conduct is directed at a U.S. import market,"" [**40]  even if the defendants did not engage in importation of products into the 
United States. Animal Sci. Prods., 654 F.3d at 471 & n.11. We need not determine the outer bounds of import trade by 
considering whether commerce directed at, but not consummated within, an import market is also outside the scope of the 
FTAIA's import provisions because at least a portion of the transactions here involves the heartland situation of the direct 
importation of foreign goods into the United States. See id. "
1637,9," Both the Second Circuit and the Seventh Circuit disagree with this definition of ""direct."" See Lotes, 753 F.3d at 398 (choosing 
instead to [i]nterpret[]'direct' to require only a reasonably proximate causal nexus""); Minn-Chem, 683 F.3d at 857 
(""Superimposing the idea of 'immediate consequence' on top of the full phrase results in a stricter test than the complete statute 
can bear.""). Whether our circuit should reconsider the stricter standard we impose is not within the province of this panel. Miller 
v. Gammie, 335 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc) (""[A] three-judge panel may not overrule a prior decision of the court."").

1666,11," In an academic sense, the ability to show damages within a single agency could perhaps be said to be relevant to showing 
classwide damages, despite being insufficient on its own. See Obrey, 400 F.3d at 695 (stating that a ""statistical study may fall 
short of proving the plaintiff's case, but still remain relevant to the issues in dispute""). In this case, however, where there is no "
1667,," other evidence that could tie agency-specific models to any [**35]  method of classwide proof across hundreds of agencies and 
clinics, it is a distinction without a difference. "
1668,12," To the extent that Plaintiffs separately argue that compensation is ""rigid"" across all clinics, the record does not adequately 
show such a price structure. The compensation rates that Dr. Singer compiled for different egg donor agencies show significant 
variation, albeit generally below $10,000 per donation. See Singer Report at 12 (Figure 1); Singer Reply Report at 51 (Figure 2)."
1668,13," Dr. Singer stated that clinics and agencies cannot yield suitable data unless they affirmatively withdrew from compliance with 
the Guidelines, even if data is available from before they agreed to them: ""An agency may be able to capture some or all of the 
benefits of the low compensation rates imposed by the Challenged Conduct without formally agreeing to the Maximum [**42]  
Price Rules. Accordingly, the initial decision to comply with SART's guidelines may not capture the effect of the Challenged 
Conduct."" Singer Report ¶ 30. "
1669,14," The Court recognizes that antitrust impact is a question of statutory standing and therefore, strictly speaking, a component of 
liability rather than damages. Defendants' counsel conceded at the hearing that an issue class may be certified even where 
liability will not be fully determined by the classwide issue. In this case, the only aspect of antitrust impact that appears to be 
disputed is whether each class member was impacted at all—a question that goes hand in hand with the issue of damages. The 
question is not whether, if such an injury exists, it is an antitrust impact. "
1671,15," The parties did not address in briefing whether the individual clinics and agencies are necessary parties to this action, and 
stipulated at the hearing that they are not. The Court therefore finds no reason to address that issue. "
1673,16," Plaintiffs also cite two other lists of donor agencies that Defendants produced during discovery, but it is not clear from the face 
of these documents that they include only agencies that agreed to follow the Guidelines. See McLellan Reply Decl. Exs. 12, 13."
1673,17," See Singer Report ¶¶ 36-37, 55-58 (discussing difficulties that Dr. Singer encountered in determining when two clinics ceased 
to be bound by the Guidelines)."
1673,18," At the hearing, defense counsel raised for the first time the possibility that local market conditions may be relevant to 
evaluating the Guidelines under the rule of reason if the Court determine that the Guidelines are not a per se violation of the 
Sherman Act, and that such considerations weigh against finding predominance even as to the question of violation. The Court 
finds the unbriefed and uncertain possibility of geographic considerations insufficient to defeat certification. In the event that local 
considerations become relevant, they could likely be addressed by modifying certification to create a manageable number of 
geographic subclasses. "
1674,19," At least one district court has held that the Supreme Court's decision in Comcast abrogated the Ninth Circuit's rule that the 
need for individualized damages calculations cannot defeat predominance. Stiller v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 298 F.R.D. 611, 
627 (S.D. Cal. 2014) (""The Supreme Court's decision in Comcast makes clear that individualized damages determinations can 
defeat Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement.""). That case, however, predates the Ninth Circuit's decisions in Leyva and 
Jimenez, which construed Comcast more narrowly. See Jimenez, 765 F.3d at 1167; Leyva, 716 F.3d at 513-15. This Court is 
bound by the Ninth Circuit's post-Comcast decisions and the rule that they reaffirm."
1674,20," At the hearing, Defendants' counsel conceded that the Court has discretion to certify an issue class in this case, but argued 
that an issue class would not advance an efficient resolution of the case. That argument is addressed separately below. "
1676,21," The class in Jimenez was defined as ""[a]ll current and former California-based 'Claims Adjustors,' or persons with similar titles 
and/or similar job duties, who work(ed) for Allstate Insurance Company within the State of California at any time during the 
period from September 29, 2006 to final judgment,"" with no definitional requirement that class members worked overtime. See 
Jimenez v. Allstate Ins. Co., No. LA CV10-08486 JAK, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65328, 2012 WL 1366052, at *1 (C.D. Cal. Apr.

1676,22," Defendants make much of the fact that Dr. Singer, at his deposition, testified that ""as [he] understand[s] it . . . you need to be 
able to demonstrate that . . . the conduct that elevated the prices ended up touching all of the buyers in the class."" Singer Dep. 
at 108:16-19; see Cert. Opp'n at 11 (citing this testimony); Mot. re Singer at 4 (same). Dr. Singer is an economist, not an 
attorney, and regardless, his opinion on the standard for class certification is not legal authority. To the extent that all class 
members [**68]  must have been ""touched"" by Defendant's alleged conduct in order to certify an issue class, the Court finds that 
requirement satisfied by the fact that all class members received compensation from clinics or agencies that agreed to follow the 
challenged Guidelines. "
1677,23, Whether a lack of Article III standing bars certification in this case is discussed in the following section.
1677,24," The Fifth Circuit appears to have adopted a rule that classwide injury-in-fact must be demonstrated in antitrust cases, but does 
not require such a [**70]  showing in other cases. Compare Bell Atl. Corp., 339 F.3d at 302 (reciting longstanding rule requiring 
classwide injury-in-fact for antitrust cases), with Mims v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 590 F.3d 298, 308 (holding in a non-antitrust 
case that ""[c]lass certification is not precluded simply because a class may include persons who have not been injured by the 
defendant's conduct.""). The Court is not aware of any Fifth Circuit opinion explaining a rationale for drawing that distinction."
1677,25," While this is not necessarily an issue of predominance, the Court discusses it here because it relates to Defendants other 
arguments regarding the issue of class members' injury-in-fact. "
1678,26," The Mazza panel found that standing was satisfied in that case, so it is not clear from that opinion what circumstances would 
violate the rule that it set forth. See Mazza, 666 F.3d at 595-96. "
1679,27," For the same reason, the Court rejects Defendants' suggestion [**79]  that certification should be denied because abolishing 
the challenged compensation guidelines could ""trigger[] a legislative response to set compensation at a certain level or to 
prohibit compensation altogether."" See Cert. Opp'n at 20 (citing McCarthy Report ¶¶ 48-49). Legislatures could establish price 
restrictions in any industry; to hobble enforcement of the antitrust laws based on the mere possibility of protective legislation 
would effectively nullify them. While the Court expresses no opinion as to whether such legislation is desirable in this instance, 
Defendants cannot base their arguments on hypothetical laws that do not presently exist. "
1681,28," Plaintiffs' [**86]  Reply erroneously characterizes this standard as a ""heightened requirement"" inapplicable to antitrust actions. 
Cert. Reply at 25-26. The case they cite held only that ""plaintiffs need not show an 'imminent threat of irreparable injury,'"" and 
found standing despite the defendants' argument that they had ceased the alleged conspiracy and were unlikely to resume it. 
See In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 267 F.R.D. 583, 596 (N.D. Cal. 2010). It did not hold that antitrust actions are 
exempt from the normal standing requirements for equitable relief, and other cases that Plaintiffs cite confirm that antitrust 
plaintiffs seeking an injunction must satisfy the usual test for standing. E.g., SRAM, 264 F.R.D. at 610 (quoted above). "
1682,29, Plaintiffs' counsel has not pursued any objection to Kamakahi's deposition testimony.
1682,30," ""I don't know [when]. There is a civil war going on right now. I don't know. Not next year, I will say. In the future."" Lujan, 504 
U.S. at 564 (quoting deposition testimony) (alteration in original). "
1687,1," The CAA provides, in relevant part, that ""credit terms shall not be deemed granted to Applicant unless and until the foregoing 
Application, these Terms and Conditions, and the form of Approval below are all completed and executed."" (Laquidara Decl., Ex 
F.) "
1688,2," The plain reading of the CAA indicates that ""all purchases"" are subject to the terms of the CAA, including the forum-selection 
clause."
1688,3," Furthermore, Trendsettah's claims arguably do not arise from purchases at all. Trendsettah alleges that Swisher did not sell the 
Splitarillos it was obligated to sell to Trendsettah under the Private Label Agreement in an attempt to monopolize the cigarillo 
market, but Trendsettah does not dispute purchases it made in the past. The Credit Application and Agreement is not implicated 
when there are no purchases. In addition, at oral argument, Swisher noted that the PLA required Trendsettah to purchase a quantity of Swisher-branded 
products in addition to the private label products, and that for a certain time while the PLA was not in effect, Trendsettah 
purchased Swisher-branded products pursuant to the terms of the CAA only. This argument does not affect the Court's analysis. 
First, it is not obvious from the face of the Complaint that the Swisher-branded products were actually purchased outside the 
scope of the PLA. Second, even had the Swisher-branded products been purchased under the CAA only, the Court's foregoing 
analysis and conclusion would not be affected. The forum-selection clause in question does not extend to disputes that arise 
from purchases, and none of Trendsettah's claims invokes the CAA. "
1696,1," Rambus, Inc. v. FTC, 522 F.3d 456, 380 U.S. App. D.C. 431 (D.C. Cir. 2008) overturned an FTC order finding that Rambus 
engaged in unlawful monopolization arising out of its failure to disclose its patents to the standard-setting body. Id. at 462. There, 
the FTC ""found the consequences of such nondisclosure only in the alternative: that it prevented [the standard setting 
organization] either from adopting a non-proprietary standard, or from extracting a RAND commitment from Rambus when 
standardizing its technology."" Id. (emphasis omitted). The procedural posture and facts in the present action are more akin to 
those presented in Broadcom than Rambus. Like this case, Broadcom involved a motion to dismiss, rather than a review of a 
merits determination. And, like this case, the patent holder in Broadcom actually made a FRAND commitment. This had not 
occurred in Rambus. There it was alleged that the patent holder wrongfully evaded making such a commitment, Consequently, 
the D.C. Circuit expressed ""serious concerns about strength of the evidence relied on to support some of the Commission's 
crucial findings regarding the scope of [the standard setting [*17]  organization's] patent disclosure policies and Rambus's 
alleged violation of those policies."" Id. at 467."
1696,2," Non-sham and objectively reasonable lawsuits are generally protected petitioning activity, and cannot alone constitute an

to obtain redress for schemes to violate the antitrust laws)."
1697,3," Counterclaim-Defendants [*19]  also challenge the counterclaim on the ground that Defendant does not know what the patent 
owners would charge for licenses to their individual ATSC patents because Defendant has chosen not to negotiate with them. 
They add that ""[t]he burden of proving lack of a realistic opportunity to license directly cannot be met where a plaintiff never 
makes an inquiry or attempts to negotiate a single individual license."" Reply, Dkt. 76 at 10 (citing Nero AG v. MPEG LA, L.L.C.,

not apply a theory of monopolization through false promises to a standard-setting organization. Rather, there were different 
theories pursued there than those that underlie the present counterclaims. Thus, even if Nero were binding precedent, it would 
not control the outcome here."
1697,4," Counterclaim-Defendants argue that ""[t]he present lawsuit is merely the reaffirmation of the [Defendant's] demand for royalty 
payments for their respective ATSC patents (an original act that was done in 2007)."" Reply, Dkt. 76 at 6. However, 
Counterclaim-Defendants nowhere describe any efforts they undertook to seek royalty payments from Defendant in 2007. "
1698,5," Counterclaim-Defendants argue that, in American Tobacco, a ""'shared monopoly' [*23]  theory was unnecessary . . . because 
each defendant enjoyed 'marked dominance,'"" and each was individually convicted of monopolization. Reply, Dkt. 76 at 8. 
However, because the Defendants in American Tobacco were in the same market, a theory of shared monopolization is 
consistent with its facts. "
1707,1," The ownership percentages listed in the Proxy Statement total more than 100%, so these figures may not be exactly accurate. 
Further, a few other small shareholders are listed. This possible inaccuracy has no effect on this Court's analysis of whether 
there existed overlapping ownership. "
1708,2," Several pieces of meaningful evidence discussed below were highlighted by Direct Purchasers during oral argument, but were 
not discussed in their summary judgment briefing. This practice is discouraged. See Nerswick v. CSX Transp., Inc., 692 F. Supp. 
2d 866, 882 (S.D. Ohio 2010), affirmed, 441 F. App'x 320 (6th Cir. 2011) (""it is not the obligation of the court . . . to comb the 
record to find evidence or testimony establishing a party's case.""). That said, Plaintiffs' two requests to supplement the summary 
judgment record (Docs. 1363 and 1461) are granted, though the evidence adduced in Doc. 1363 is mostly unhelpful for the 
reasons stated in the FXI response at Doc. 1372. "
1713,3," Once again, this assumption is questionable. Even if Direct Purchasers were challenging the Sale Order on direct appeal, 
which they are not, a ""bankruptcy court's findings of fact are reviewed for clear error."" U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. U.S. E.P.A., 563 
F.3d 199, 205 (6th Cir. 2009). Although this Court believes the bankruptcy court's order is, at the very least, entitled to 
deference, this Court does not simply adopt the bankruptcy court's [**31]  findings and conclusions recited in the Sale Order at 
9, ¶ S. Rather, for all the reasons stated in this Order, this Court independently concludes the bankruptcy court was entirely 
correct when it concluded FXI is neither a successor to nor a mere continuation of, Foamex, and FXI did not engage in a de 
facto merger with Foamex. "
1756,1," It is not apparent from the e-mail whether Farah offered the comments that preceded or followed his name, which appears in

1784,6, The court therefore did not address the Private Hospitals' contentions with respect to the other product markets. [**10] 
1785,7," This quotation is not included in the definitive book of Berra quotations, see Yogi Berra, The Yogi Book: ""I Really Didn't Say

ed., 2006) (attributing a variant to Niels Bohr, but noting that the exact authorship is disputed)."
1785,8," The application of this framework in the Ninth Circuit is not rigid. Thus, in determining whether the prima facie case has been 
rebutted, a district court may consider evidence submitted by the plaintiff in the case-in-chief. See Olin, 986 F.2d at 1305 (finding 
no burden-shifting error because the FTC had determined that the rebuttal evidence was insufficient to overcome the prima facie 
showing); see also Chi. Bridge & Iron, 534 F.3d at 424-25 (stating that Olin ""allows [a court] to preserve the prima facie 
presumption if the [defendant] . . . fails to satisfy the burden of production in light of contrary evidence in the prima facie case""). "
1786,9," Although the Merger Guidelines are ""not binding on the courts,"" Olin, 986 F.2d at 1300, they ""are often used as persuasive

1786,10," This ""two-stage model"" of health care competition [**15]  is ""the accepted model."" John J. Miles, 1 Health Care & Antitrust L. § 
1:5 (2014). In the first stage, providers compete for inclusion in insurance plans. See Vistnes, supra, at 674. In the second stage, 
providers seek to attract patients enrolled in the plans. See id. at 681-82. Because patients are ""largely insensitive"" to price, the 
second stage ""takes place primarily over non-price dimensions."" Id. at 682. Thus, antitrust analysis focuses on the first stage. Id. 
at 692. "
1787,11," Extensive evidence was offered about [**17]  Micron, a Boise employer that created a health care plan including financial 
incentives for employees to use certain providers; the plan caused a substantial portion of Micron employees residing in Nampa 
to switch to non-Nampa PCPs. St. Luke's argues that this evidence proved that Nampa consumers would respond to a SSNIP. 
But the district court did not clearly err in finding the Micron example unpersuasive. Micron's cost differentials were much higher 
than a SSNIP, Boise PCPs were close to work for Micron's employees, and it was unclear whether other employers would be 
willing or able to replicate Micron's program. "
1788,12," Ancillary services, such as x-rays and diagnostic testing, are sometimes performed by doctors in conjunction with PCP 
examinations. Before the merger, Saltzer provided many ancillary services at its physicians' offices. Insurance companies and 
Medicare often offer higher reimbursements [**22]  for ancillary services performed at a hospital-based outpatient facility. "
1790,13," The district court found that a core reason for high health care costs is the prevalent fee-for-service reimbursement model, 
based on the apparently uncontested opinions of expert witnesses. Experts have recommended moving toward integrated care 
and risk-based reimbursement. ""In an integrated delivery system, [PCPs] and specialty physicians work as a team, with PCPs 
managing patient care and specialty physicians consulting and providing care as needed."" Risk-based reimbursement (also 
known as capitation) means that ""providers receive [**26]  reimbursement from insurers in the form of a set amount for each 
patient rather than a payment for each service rendered. The set amount is based on the average expected health care 
utilization for the patients given such factors as their age and medical history."" ""Capitation motivates providers to consider the 
costs of treatment as they will share in the savings if they can keep actual costs below the set amount they receive."""
1790,14," Some courts have attempted to explain why the Supreme Court cases do not recognize an efficiencies defense, see, e.g., H.J. 
Heinz, 246 F.3d at 720 n.18 (arguing that the ""possible economies"" language in Proctor & Gamble does not ban an actual 
efficiencies defense), but others have simply stated that the defense exists without addressing the language in Brown Shoe and 
its progeny, see, e.g., ProMedica, 749 F.3d at 571. "
1792,15," St. Luke's argues that once a defendant comes forward with proof of efficiencies, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that 
there are ways of achieving those efficiencies without the merger. This tracks the Sherman Act analysis. See, e.g., Bhan v. NME 
Hosps., Inc., 929 F.2d 1404, 1412-14 (9th Cir. 1991). But, HN17[
] in Clayton Act § 7 cases, after a plaintiff has made a prima facie case that a merger is anticompetitive, the burden of [**34]  showing that the claimed efficiencies cannot be ""attained by 
practical alternatives,"" Merger Guidelines § 10 n.13, is properly part of the defense, see Olin, 986 F.2d at 1305 (explaining that it 
is the defendant's ""burden to rebut a prima facie case of illegality""). That burden, moreover, is not unduly onerous, as the 
defendant need not disprove alternatives that are ""merely theoretical."" Merger Guidelines § 10. "

266, 270, 298), and a motion to supplement the record on summary judgment oral argument. (ECF No. 309). There also appear 
to be two pending motions to seal, filed by Live Nation. (ECF Nos. 218, 265). The motions to seal are granted. "

1799,7," Plaintiffs' motion to [**12]  strike portions of Live Nation's reply in support of its motion to exclude Elhauge (ECF No. 266) is 
denied. The arguments that plaintiffs contend are new were adequately briefed in Live Nation's initial motion to exclude. 
Plaintiffs' motions to strike various exhibits proffered by Live Nation (ECF Nos. 270, 298) are also denied. Plaintiffs' arguments 
are not without merit, but they go to weight and credibility, not admissibility. Finally, Plaintiffs' motion to supplement the record 
from the hearing held on November 7 is granted. (ECF No. 309). I am not, however, ruling on ultimate admissibility at trial, only 
that I am considering the supplemental facts in light of their mention during the hearing. (ECF No. 309). "
1800,8, Plaintiffs cite the other six cases in their opposition motion. (ECF No. 251 at p. 8). 
1801,9," As Live Nation points out, Elhauge included plays and musicals that were only performed on one occasion, such as Mamma 
Mia and Barbie Live, in his data. Given the single occurrence of these performances, they are unlike artists on tour and 
necessarily only perform at amphitheaters or non-amphitheaters. As such, these performances are ""incapable of switching (in 
response to a price change or otherwise),"" thus further skewing the data and creating more data points for the 100% and 0% 
sides of the U-shaped histogram. (ECF Nos. 212 at p. 7 n.3; 263 at p. 8). "
1802,10," For example, plaintiffs intend to rely on Joshua Baron to explain the ""development, workings and structure of the concert 
industry, and Live Nation's domination of that industry to the jury."" (ECF No. 243 at p. 1). Specific opinions he provides include 
the difference between amphitheater and non-amphitheater performances, and the category of artists who ""prefer"" the former. 
Id. at 11. This testimony is well within his expertise on the concert industry. Other offered testimony, however, including antitrust 
conclusions such as ""Live Nation's control [**25]  of the only network of amphitheaters gives it significant leverage over artists,"" 
id., and ""Live Nation has engaged in anticompetitive conduct,"" id. at 12, is not, and would accordingly not be permitted. The same would apply to Bigelow, an expert on the food and beverage industry at concert venues. (ECF No. 248). While 
permitted to testify on the pricing system at Nissan and Merriweather, and to compare prices at these venues with those at peer 
venues, Bigelow could not offer his opinion as to underlying market behavior that caused these prices, or use the price data to 
make claims of anticompetitive or monopolist behavior. (ECF No. 205-26). "
1803,11," Courts sometimes distinguish between per se illegal tying arrangements, and tying arrangements reviewed under the rule of 
reason. E.g., Montgomery Cty. Ass'n of Realtors, Inc. v. Realty Photo Master Corp., 783 F. Supp. 952, 959 (D. Md. 1992). I do 
not need to parse the differences here, for the analysis is substantially similar. See BookLocker.com, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 
650 F. Supp. 2d 89, 97 n.2 (D. Me. 2009) (""In any event, the gap between a per se claim and a rule of reason claim in the tying 
context may not be wide.""). "
1804,12," Plaintiffs, not Live Nation, move for summary judgment on the product dimension of the promotion services market. I do not 
need to address this question because the geographic dimension is defective, therefore tainting the entire promotion services 
market definition relied upon by plaintiffs. "
1805,13," At one point, plaintiffs mischaracterize the national vs. local inquiry. (ECF No. 291 at p. 6) (""Artists reside throughout the 
country and are not seeking promoters where they reside.""). Where artists reside is irrelevant, the question is where artists 
perform and whether promoters do in fact operate on a national scale, available in multiple locations. As Live Nation argues, an 
artist seeking a promoter for the Baltimore-D.C. area ""is not going to retain the services of a promoter based in Florida."" (ECF 
No. 287 at p. 36). "
1806,14," See also Holmes and Mangiaracina, Antitrust Law Handbook § 2:18 (""It must be more specifically shown that the buyer was 
coerced into taking the tied item, not because he wanted it or was simply ignorant in his purchasing decision, but because this 
was a condition forced upon him directly or by the practical economics of the arrangement.""). "
1807,15," James Guerinot, a manager, also confirms that with respect to Nine Inch Nails' decision to perform at Nissan, ""[t]here was no 
element in coercion in the booking process,"" the choice was ""based solely on business decisions."" (Guerinot Decl., ECF No. 
228-1 ¶ 8). "
1810,16," Plaintiffs also cite regression analyses calculated by Elhauge which demonstrate that artists who perform at a Live Nation 
amphitheater [**52]  in a town where it is the only amphitheater performed at Merriweather 26% of the time, in contrast to 84% 
when artists bypass Live Nation amphitheaters. This calculation is insufficient for a reasonable fact-finder to infer coercion, 
however, because it does not address whether artists were coerced into bypassing Merriweather, or instead did so voluntarily."
1810,17," Plaintiffs state that ""none of plaintiffs' claims are based upon the finding that LN exercised monopoly power in the 
Baltimore/DC [**53]  venue market."" (ECF No. 279 at p. 54). "
1814,18, Plaintiffs' complaint does not contain an enumerated Count IX. 
1826,1," Originally, the United States and eighteen states brought this action, which was filed in 2010, but Hawaii stipulated to the 
dismissal of its claims without prejudice before trial. (Stip. & Dismissal Without Prejudice of the Claim of the State of Hawaii (Dkt. 
104).) "
1828,2," On the final day of testimony, August 18, 2014, the court held the evidentiary record open to allow [**16]  the parties to resolve 
certain evidentiary disputes concerning summary evidence they wished to include in the evidentiary record pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Evidence 1006. (Tr. at 6757:13-6758:1, 6768:13-18.) The parties were able to resolve their disputes as to all but one of 
these additional exhibits, DX7828-63, which is a single slide from Dr. Bernheim's presentation that displays the corporate logos 
of twenty-six large companies and is captioned ""Amex's Rates Have Declined for Many Merchants."" (See DX7828 at 63.) 
Plaintiffs object to the admission of DX7828-63 as a violation of Rule 1006 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26. (Aug. 27, 
2014, Pls. Ltr. (Dkt. 594-1).) Because the court finds that DX7828-63 lacks any appreciable probative value, there is little cause 
not to admit the exhibit for the purposes of a complete appellate record. Specifically, Dr. Bernheim's determination that the 
discount rates declined for the twenty-six merchants represented on DX7828-63 is premised on a methodology for calculating 
merchants' effective discount rates that the court finds to be unreliable and upon which it places little, if any, weight. See infra 
Part IV.D. As a result, Plaintiffs suffer no prejudice from the admission of DX7828-63 to ensure a complete record [**17]  on 
appeal. "
1829,3," Throughout this Decision, where an exhibit's pincite is preceded by an apostrophe, the number refers to the last three digits of 
the control number of the particular page cited. Where the pincite is not preceded by an apostrophe, the number refers to the 
ordinary pagination of the exhibit."
1829,4," For the purposes of this Decision, the term ""merchant"" will be used to refer to the wide range of entities that need to collect 
payments, including airlines, hotels, grocery stores, online retailers, and government agencies, among myriad others. The terms 
""consumer"" and ""customer"" are used herein to refer to those individuals and entities that purchase goods and services from 
merchants; in other words, those who desire to make payments. However, it is important to recognize that Amex-
accepting [**19]  merchants and Amex cardholders are both technically ""consumers"" of the services provided by Defendants. 
Though nomenclature can be a source of unnecessary confusion in the payments context, the court has endeavored to be as 
clear as possible. "
1832,5," At the time of the Visa litigation, both Visa and MasterCard were organized as ""open, joint venture associations with members 
(primarily banks) that issue[d] payment cards, acquire[d] merchants who accept payment cards, or both."" Visa I, 163 F. Supp. 2d 
at 332. For example, in return for the right to issue Visa cards and acquire Visa transactions from merchants, member financial 
institutions agreed to follow Visa's bylaws and operating regulations, including its Exclusionary Rules. (Id.) Accordingly, the court 
occasionally refers to these ventures as the ""bank associations"" throughout this Decision. Visa's and MasterCard's corporate 
structures changed in 2008 and 2006, respectively, when initial public offerings ""converted each from a consortium of competitor 
banks into single-entity, publicly traded companies with no bank governance."" See In re Payment Card Interchange Fee & 
Merch. Disc. Antitrust Litig., 986 F. Supp. 2d 207, 212 (E.D.N.Y. 2013). "

Cinemas, and Liberty Travel, among others)."
1839,7," Defendants' contention that the Government seeks to impose liability under a truncated rule of reason, or ""quick look"" analysis, 
is without merit. (Defs. Post-Trial Br. (Dkt. 605) at 8-10.) American Express argues that the ""actual adverse effects"" test relied 
upon by Plaintiffs is inapposite here, as it was taken from a portion of the Supreme Court's opinion in F.T.C. v. Indiana 
Federation of Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 461-62, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986), which [**62]  applied a ""quick look"" 
analysis to a horizontal agreement. (Defs. Post-Trial Br. at 8.) See also Major League Baseball Props., Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., 542 
F.3d 290, 317 (2d Cir. 2008) (discussing state of Supreme Court precedent on ""quick look"" analyses). Yet as the Second Circuit 
clarified in Todd v. Exxon Corp, 275 F.3d 191, 206-07 (2d Cir. 2001), and as the court clarifies herein, HN5[
] ""[t]he use of 
anticompetitive effects to demonstrate market power . . . is not limited to 'quick look' or 'truncated' rule of reason cases,"" and 
may be used as a supplement to or in lieu of a market share approach to proving market power. Id. at 207 (2d Cir. 2001) 
(rejecting antitrust defendants' attempt to equate the direct means of proving anticompetitive effect under the rule of reason with 
a ""quick look"" or ""truncated"" rule of reason inquiry). Plaintiffs have unequivocally stated their position that the NDPs should be 
assessed using a full rule of reason inquiry (see Tr. at 15:18-16:2 (Opening Statement), 6783:8-13 (Closing Argument)), and the 
court agrees that the various complexities in this case preclude a finding that the anticompetitive effects flowing from the NDPs 
are ""obvious."" See Cal. Dental Ass'n v. F.T.C., 526 U.S. 756, 770-71, 119 S. Ct. 1604, 143 L. Ed. 2d 935 (1999) (noting the 
Supreme Court has generally applied a truncated analysis only where ""an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of 
economics could conclude that the arrangements [**63]  in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and 
markets"")."
1839,8, See Tr. at 4187:4-4189:18 (Katz). 
1840,9," American Express maintains its position, first articulated in its summary judgment briefing, that Plaintiffs must prove that it 
possessed market power in the relevant market [**66]  in order to prevail under Section 1. For the same reasons set forth in 
Amex I, the court rejects this position as inconsistent with clear and binding precedent in this Circuit. See Amex I, 21 F. Supp. 3d 
187, 2014 WL 1817427, at *6-7. In any event, as suggested by the Second Circuit in Todd and Tops Markets, HN8[
] when a "
1841,," plaintiff has discharged his initial burden in a Section 1 case by proving that the challenged restraint caused actual detrimental 
effects on competition, the plaintiff implicitly has also proven that the defendant possessed sufficient antitrust market power to 
cause such competitive harms. See Todd, 275 F.3d at 206; Tops Mkts., 142 F.3d at 98. Additionally, as discussed later in this 
Decision, the court concludes that American Express does in fact possess antitrust market power in the relevant market. See 
infra Part IV. "
1842,10," The Government additionally, albeit unsuccessfully, challenged the dual governance structures of Visa and MasterCard, which 
permitted members of each association to sit on the Board of Directors of either Visa or MasterCard. See Visa I, 163 F. Supp. 2d 
at 378-79."
1842,11," Dr. Katz's characterization of the relevant [**73]  market at trial differed from both the definition alleged by Plaintiffs in the 
Amended Complaint and the definition adopted in Visa, insofar as Dr. Katz added the notation ""provided to merchants"" after the 
core product definition ""general purpose credit and charge card network services."" (Compare Tr. at 3858:14-25 (Katz), with Am. 
Compl. ¶ 33.) Having reviewed the whole of Dr. Katz's testimony, the court cannot conclude that by including this additional 
language Dr. Katz intended to depart from the product markets adopted by the district court and Second Circuit in Visa. Rather, 
it seems far more likely that the addition of the ""provided to merchants"" qualification was included by Dr. Katz as a foil against 
which he could define a submarket of network services provided to only T&E merchants, as opposed to all merchants. The court 
accordingly concludes that Plaintiffs and Dr. Katz propose that it adopt a substantively identical market as the network services "
1843,," market used in Visa. As the Second Circuit explained in Visa, in the network services market the four major networks compete 
with one another to sell services to both the issuing banks and merchants. See Visa II, 344 F.3d at 239 (""[I]n the market for 
general [**74]  purpose card network services, the four networks themselves are the sellers, and the issuers of cards and 
merchants are the buyers."" (emphasis removed)). In other words, like the overall GPCC platform, the network services market 
itself is two-sided; each network competes for the business of two separate sets of consumers. Of course, due to its large 
proprietary issuing business, American Express does not need to focus on the demands of the issuing banks to the same 
degree as Visa and MasterCard, yet it cannot wholly ignore these demands either, given its third-party issuing or GNS business."
1843,12," As the Second Circuit recognized in Visa II, a third avenue of competition occurs at the ""acquiring"" level among American 
Express and the various acquirers/processors that provide services to Visa-, MasterCard-, and Discover-accepting merchants. 
344 F.3d at 237. This level of competition, however, has little bearing on the court's analysis of Amex's NDPs, except insofar as 
it affects each network's respective merchant coverage. American Express generally does not rely on acquirers to act as 
intermediaries between the network and its merchants, while those competitors that do rely on acquiring banks to deal with 
merchants still dictate nearly [**77]  all key terms of the networkmerchant relationship, including interchange rates (which form 
the bulk of the merchant discount fee), anti-steering rules, and other conditions of acceptance. (See Tr. at 3828:13-22, 3833:17-
24 (Katz).) Accordingly, as in Visa, the court finds that it is able to conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the 
challenged restraints without extensive consideration of the acquiring market; therefore, the role and functions of acquiring 
banks will be addressed only where relevant, and the court will otherwise assume a direct relationship between network and 
merchant on the merchant side of the GPCC platform. "
1844,13," The court in National Bancard Corp. v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 596 F. Supp. 1231 (S.D. Fla. 1984) (""NaBanco""), aff'd, 779 F.2d 592 
(11th Cir. 1986), however, did define a relevant product market for all ""payment systems,"" finding that Visa's GPCC cards were 
reasonably interchangeable with other credit cards, ATM cards, travelers checks, personal checks, and cash. Id. at 1257-58. In 
reaching this determination, the NaBanco court appears to have recognized some of the two-sided features of the credit card 
industry, though it did not expressly consider how such a structure might affect its definitional analysis. Id. Importantly, however, 
the broad market definition endorsed by NaBanco was rejected by the district court in Visa. As Judge Jones noted, ""although it is 
literally true that . . . cash and checks compete with general purpose cards as an option for payment by consumers . . . cash and 
checks do not drive many of the means of competition"" in the GPCC industry. Visa I, 163 F. Supp. 2d at 335-38. Relying on the 
qualitative differences between GPCC cards [**81]  and other forms of payment, the fact that Visa and MasterCard did not 
consider the costs of non-GPCC systems in pricing their own services, and evidence of consumer payment preferences, the 
Visa court ultimately concluded that ""neither consumers nor the defendants view debit, cash and checks as reasonably 
interchangeable with credit cards."" Id. The Second Circuit agreed, Visa II, 344 F.3d at 238-40, and, given both the passage of 
time since the NaBanco decision and the imprecise reasoning applied by the district court in that case, this court finds little 
justification in NaBanco for the ""transactions"" definition advocated by American Express. "
1845,14," For example, prior to 2010, American Express consistently and repeatedly represented to courts, federal agencies, and its 
investors that it did not compete with [**84]  debit card networks because of the limited substitutability between credit and debit.

1847,15," Defendants dispute the probative value of Dr. Katz's application of the SSNIP test in this case due to a lack of concrete 
quantitative data on price sensitivity among cardholders and merchants, noting instead that Dr. Katz's analysis is merely "
1848,," ""another way of expressing one's judgment about the qualitative evidence."" (Tr. at 6219:18-6221:4 [**95]  (Bernheim).) The court 
disagrees. While there is limited direct quantitative data on price sensitivity among cardholders or merchants, the court finds Dr. 
Katz's analysis to be both carefully executed and persuasive. Emigra Grp., 612 F. Supp. 2d at 352 (""Direct evidence of cross-
elasticity of demand is rare.""). Moreover, the more pragmatic, factual analysis Defendants favor also supports Dr. Katz's 
proposed market definition. See infra Part III.A.2.b. Nor does the court find fault in Dr. Katz's decision to begin his SSNIP 
analysis by assuming a test market equivalent to that adopted by the district court and Second Circuit in Visa, namely, the 
market for general purpose credit and charge card network services, rather than beginning with a single-brand market for 
American Express cards alone. (See Tr. at 4057:10-23, 4059:11-24 (Katz).)"
1848,16," Dr. Bernheim's conclusions, [**98]  to the contrary, focused almost entirely on cardholders' inclination to substitute between 
credit and debit products, which, while certainly relevant to the reasonable interchangeability of the associated acceptance 
services from a merchant's perspective, does not tell the whole story. For example, Dr. Bernheim analyzed data regarding 
individual customers' spending patterns at specific supermarkets and drugstores, which showed that some customers were 
switching between debit and credit products, even when shopping at the same merchant. (Tr. at 6261:12-6262:15, 6267:4-
6269:5 (Bernheim); DX7828 at 31-33, 35-36.) But Dr. Bernheim made no attempt to link that substitution to changes in the price 
for network services (see Tr. at 6635:22-6636:23 (Katz)), and did not explain why between two-thirds and three-quarters of the "
1849,," customers whose spending patterns were analyzed used only credit or debit and did not switch between the two forms of 
payment. (Id.) Defendants' expert also cited new data from a survey conducted by the Boston Federal Reserve to illustrate the 
changing perceptions of credit and debit products (id. at 6237:21-6244:3, 6248:22-6249:17 (Bernheim); DX7828 at 26), but his 
analysis [**99]  appears to have overstated the significance of the shift in consumer attitudes (see id. at 6641:4-6643:15 (Katz)). 
For the reasons set forth here and in the remainder of this section, the court finds Dr. Bernheim's and Defendants' arguments 
concerning debit's inclusion in the relevant market to be unpersuasive. "
1850,17," Indeed, in the last Form 10-K filed by American Express before initiation of this lawsuit, the company publicly acknowledged 
that ""[t]he ability to substitute debit cards for credit and charge cards is limited because there is no credit extended and the 
consumer must have sufficient funds in his or her demand deposit account to pay for the purchase at the time of the transaction, 
as opposed to charge cards where payment is due at the end of the month or credit cards where payment can be extended over 
a period of time."" (PX1408 at 22 (Amex 2009 Form 10-K).)"
1850,18," See Tr. at 252:25-253:2 (Thiel/Alaska Airlines) (""Q: Can Alaska [A]irlines as an institution substitute the acceptance of debit 
cards for the acceptance of credit cards? A: No.""), 387:8-388:7 (Robinson/Ikea) (noting that Ikea's ""experience has shown us 
that different customers [] have different preferences, and we have to offer those choices""); 564:20-565:9 (Bouchard/Sears) 
(testifying that Sears would be at a competitive disadvantage were it not to accept GPCC cards), 1231:1-1232:24 (Kimmet/Home "
1851,," Depot) (given Home Depot's large average ticket [**108]  size, it is ""almost required to accept credit cards"" and noting that if it 
dropped GPCC cards ""a segment of the customer base . . . would clearly move to our competitors""), 1525:9-21 (O'Malley/Best 
Buy) (testifying that Best Buy has never considered accepting only debit cards because ""consumers are expecting to pay with 
credit cards""), 5908:2-18 (Flueck/Starwood Hotels) (noting that Starwood must accept GPCC cards because business travelers 
generally book travel on their credit cards to allow time for reimbursement); see also id. at 1233:10-25 (Kimmet/Home Depot) 
(testifying that Home Depot would likely continue accepting GPCC cards in the face of a 10% increase in the discount rate), 
1683:24-1684:5 (Dale/Sprint) (same)."
1851,19," Only one merchant, Jetro, appears to have successfully negotiated a lower discount rate based on the lower debit rates that 
took effect after the Durbin Amendment. (Tr. at 2282:17-2284:10 (Berry/Amex).) Yet even in that case, internal Amex documents 
made it clear that ""Jetro will need to be educated on why debit and credit are separate products and why AXP should only be 
compared to credit."" (PX0011 at '627.) Accordingly, the court finds little probative weight in this example, and [**109]  certainly 
not enough to outweigh the prevailing evidence presented at trial that credit and debit are viewed by networks and merchants 
alike as distinct product groups."
1851,20," The court is not persuaded by Dr. Bernheim's argument that the proper measure of the Durbin Amendment's impact in the 
marketplace is an unweighted average of rates paid by merchants, as opposed to the figures used by Dr. Katz and the Federal 
Reserve to measure the Durbin Amendment's effect on debit rates, which are weighted by charge volume. (Tr. at 6519:15-
6520:24 (Bernheim).) While the raw measure of how many merchants did or did not see a decline in their debit rates is 
interesting, the more relevant metric for determining interchangeability from the merchant's perspective, including how much 
incremental profit a merchant might realize by dropping GPCC cards entirely, cannot be calculated or even approximated on an 
unweighted basis. [**111] "
1852,21," The anecdotal evidence provided by those merchants that testified at trial supports the observations of Dr. Katz. Despite the 
decline in debit rates after the Durbin Amendment, none of these merchants saw any decline in their credit card pricing. (Tr. at 
251:23-252:8 (Thiel/Alaska Airlines), 407:13-408:6 (Robinson/Ikea), 1525:24-1526:6 (O'Malley/Best Buy), 1611:22-1612:5 
(Brennan/Hilton).) Nor did any of the merchants switch away from GPCC acceptance after Durbin. (See id. at 1234:12-1235:5 
(Kimmet/Home Depot), 1525:9-1526:3 (O'Malley/Best Buy), 2321:21-2322:7 (Bruno/Crate & Barrel), 5297:16-5298:5 
(Gutierrez/Strictly Bicycles); see also id. at 2723:5-8 (Funda/Amex) (testifying that he was unaware of any merchant that ceased 
accepting GPCC cards and relied on debit).)"
1852,22," Of course, declining interchange fees on debit cards cannot be equated with lower prices for debit network [**113]  services, 
as these are two separate elements of the overall debit discount fee. Nonetheless, the absence of any meaningful reaction 
among merchants to both lower interchange rates and lower all-in rates for debit acceptance supports the court's determination 
that debit and credit network services are not reasonably interchangeable from the merchants' perspective. "
1855,23," Defendants attempt to undercut Plaintiffs' market [**124]  share argument by arguing that firms with under 30% market share 
presumptively lack market power in the Second Circuit. (Tr. at 6932:16-23 (Closing Argument).) Defendants find support for this 
market power threshold in Commercial Data Servers, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., in which Judge McMahon of 
the Southern District of New York noted that ""[c]ourts have consistently held that firms with market shares of less than 30% are 
presumptively incapable of exercising market power."" 262 F. Supp. 2d 50, 74 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citation and internal quotation 
marks omitted). Yet absent clear precedent from the Second Circuit establishing the 30% threshold advocated by American 
Express—and there is none—the court is unwilling to endorse Defendants' unduly formalistic and arbitrary approach to market 
power. HN24[
] Market share is but one factor considered when attempting to approximate a defendant firm's power in a 
relevant market, and that a firm's share falls below some arbitrary threshold cannot disprove allegations of market power without 
reference to the other competitive dynamics at play. See United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 528, 68 S. Ct. 
1107, 92 L. Ed. 1533 (1948) (""The relative effect of percentage command of a market varies with the setting in which that factor 
is placed.""); Allen-Myland, Inc. v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp., 33 F.3d 194, 209 (3d Cir. 1994) (""'Market share is [**125]  just a way of 
estimating market power, which is the ultimate consideration. When there are better ways to estimate market power, the court 
should use them.'"" (quoting Ball Mem'l Hosp., Inc. v. Mut. Hosp. Ins. Co., 784 F.2d 1325, 1336 (7th Cir. 1986) (Easterbrook, 
J.))). Moreover, Amex's proposed threshold is inconsistent with the Second Circuit's finding in Visa that MasterCard, which at the 
time possessed a 26% share of the network services market, possessed market power sufficient to establish a Section 1 
violation. Visa II, 344 F.3d at 240. "
1856,24," Discover's successful entry in 1985 may be attributed to two unique factors that are unlikely to be replicated in today's market. 
First, Discover offered a ""breakthrough value proposition"" for cardholders, offering cash back rewards at no annual fee—in fact, 
Discover was ""the first card to have any form of rewards."" (Tr. at 820:23-821:16 (Hochschild/Discover).) Second, and perhaps 
more importantly for overcoming the network effects just described, Discover was initially owned and operated by one of the 
nation's largest retailers, Sears, which marketed Discover's cards to its already significant population of private label 
cardholders. (Id. at 823:3-16 (Hochschild/Discover).) Similar [**128]  entry today would be ""impossible,"" according to Discover. 
(Id.) "

cardholders), 4759:15-29 (Glenn/Amex); PX0426 at '649 (Amex presentation noting ""research indicates strong loyalty to 
American Express Cards"" ""[d]riven by [the] ability to earn points, miles, or cash rebates"" and that many cardholders ""use

considered dropping American Express because ""we would lose an unacceptable amount of sales""), 1262:23-25 (Kimmet/Home

3146:2-6 (Gibson/Sinclair) (noting it would ""be crazy not to take [American Express]"" at Sinclair's hotel properties because it 
constitutes ""34 percent of the business"")."
1857,27," E.g., id. at 389:10-390:10 (Robinson/Ikea) (noting there had been ""internal discussions about whether or not it would be 
feasible to drop American Express,"" but that after conducting internal surveys among its customers, Ikea concluded the 
company could not drop Amex without ""suffering a loss in sales"" attributable to Amex-insistent cardholders shopping elsewhere), 
491:1-494:8 (Satkowski/Enterprise) (testifying that Enterprise determined it could not [**135]  drop Amex because its ""corporate 
customers were not interested in paying fo[r] their rental with a different method of payment""), 1529:6-1536:22 (O'Malley/Best 
Buy) (stating that Best Buy had conducted a ""war game"" to evaluate feasibility of dropping Amex, but after estimating levels of 
insistence among various cardholder segments it concluded ""the numbers [were] pretty stark"" that Best Buy should continue 
acceptance), 1687:12-1690:12, 1759:13-23 (Dale/Sprint) (Sprint twice considered dropping Amex, but did not do so because 
""[t]here was a concern that we would lose customers . . . if we made that decision,"" particularly among corporate cardholders). "
1858,28," Though Amex's value-based pricing methodology is only one of several inputs the network uses when setting its headline 
discount rates (see Tr. at 2564:18-2565:4 (Funda/Amex)), the conceptual framework used by Amex's pricing team nonetheless 
demonstrates Defendants' own reliance on estimates of cardholder insistence in the ordinary course of business, as well as a 
recognition by the network that the uncommon loyalty of its cardholders amplifies its leverage over merchants. This is, in effect, 
the same dynamic observed in Visa. See Visa I, 163 F. Supp. 2d at 340-41. "
1861,29," Specifically, a number of American Express witnesses cited the harm done to the network's relationship with Continental 
Airlines as evidence of the financial damage caused by Value Recapture, which is not captured in the profitability analyses just 
described. As part of its Value Recapture initiative in the airline industry, American Express raised Continental's headline 
discount rate in January [**151]  2008 by approximately 10%, which equated to several million dollars in additional discount fees 
paid by the airline annually. (See PX0056-A at '237; PX0211 at '046; DX3821 at '533, '560-01; PX1033 at '151.) More than two 
years later, in June 2010, Continental decided not to renew its participation in Amex's Membership Rewards program as a 
redemption partner, and withdrew from Amex's airport lounge access program, pursuant to which Platinum and Centurion 
cardholders enjoyed free access to a number of airlines' lounges. (PX1033 at '151; Tr. at 5720:16-5722:8 (Gilligan/Amex).) 
While these moves were undoubtedly detrimental to American Express's bottom line and the utility of its cards to cardholders 
(see Tr. at 5721:22-5723:19 (Gilligan/Amex)), Defendants' efforts to establish causation between the VR price increases and the 
airline's decision to alter its relationship with Amex is not convincing. To the contrary, the contemporaneous record evidence 
plainly shows that while Continental was unhappy with the magnitude of the price increase imposed years earlier, the primary 
reason for its withdrawal from Membership Rewards and the lounge access program was to avoid heavy penalties 
under [**152]  its new co-brand contract with Chase. (See PX1033 at '151 (""As we've discussed with several members of your 
team over the past year, any extension of M[embership] R[ewards] is very difficult because of our co-brand agreement with 
Chase.""); see also Tr. at 5471:4-14 (Codispoti/Amex) (testifying that the network was ""fairly certain that Continental would exit 
the [Membership Rewards] program"" because of Continental's co-brand relationship with Chase); PX1203-A at '245 (""Re-signing 
these Amex partnerships would result in significant penalties to Continental from their co-brand issuer (Chase)."").) "
1862,30," The probative value of Plaintiffs' evidence concerning Amex's pricing premium also is undercut by the fact that it speaks only 
to one component of the net or two-sided price charged across Defendants' partially integrated platform—i.e., the merchant 
discount rate. (See Tr. at 6340:2-7 (Bernheim).) As the court later explains, the evidentiary record does not include a reliable 
measure of the two-sided price charged by American Express that correctly or appropriately accounts for the network's 
expenses on the [**156]  cardholder side of the platform, from which the court might draw comparisons to Visa and 
MasterCard's pricing. See infra Part.IV.D. "
1863,31," American Express's merchant discount rates are typically compared to those of its competitors on a mix-adjusted basis, 
meaning Defendants' headline rates—which are the same for all Amex card products—are compared on a weighted basis to a 
comparable ""mix"" of Visa and MasterCard card products in order to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison. (See Tr. at 919:5-
20 (Hochschild/Discover) (agreeing that to fairly compare merchant discount rates one should do an ""apples to apples"" 
comparison that compares fees on like card products), 2567:1-22 (Funda/Amex).) Yet the court recognizes that merchants' 
acceptance decisions often are not so nuanced; from the merchant's perspective, the relevant price when comparing the 
network services provided by the four GPCC networks likely is the total per transaction cost, regardless of what type of Amex, 
Visa, MasterCard, or Discover card is used. (See, e.g., id. at 385:10-386:5 (Robinson/Ikea), 474:18-477:19 
(Satkowski/Enterprise).) Without adjusting for mix, Amex's premiums appear [**159]  significantly larger. (See PX2702 at 85.)"
1863,32," See PX0111 at '809 (noting average [**160]  household income for Amex cardholders is 21% higher than that of non-
cardholders' households); DX6576 at 10."
1863,33," Numerous merchant witnesses called by Plaintiffs testified that American Express had the largest average ticket size for any 
GPCC network. (See, e.g., Tr. at 433:10-12 (Robinson/Ikea), 588:14-18 (Bouchard/Sears), 1297:24-1300:4 (Kimmet/Home 
Depot), 2347:3-8 (Bruno/Crate & Barrel).) Amex additionally delivers incremental value to airlines and other T&E merchants due 
in large part to its strong corporate card business. (See PX1601 at '273 (Amex presentation showing its cardholders have ""1.6 
times more air tickets purchases v. non-Cardholders"" and ""3.2 times higher spend on air travel""); PX0111 at '809 (Amex 
presentation stating that its cardholders purchase first or business class tickets 2.3 times as often as non-cardholders). )"
1863,34, See DX7238 at '375; Tr. at 3290:5-14 (Biornstad/MasterCard). 
1865,35," Additionally, it appears that while Amex's average effective discount rate continued to decline during Value Recapture (see Tr. 
at 5718:3-16 (Gilligan/Amex)), those price increases more than offset all sources of downward pressure on Amex's overall rates 
except those attributable to changes in mix. (PX1753-A at '029, '034-35 (noting ""Value Recapture initiatives continue to offset 
controllable rate investments globally"").)"
1865,36," Cardholders effectively pay a ""negative"" price for acceptance services in Amex's GPCC platform in the form of rewards earned 
on a per transaction basis. (Tr. at 3852:11-3853:2, 3905:17-3906:5, 4021:16-24 (Katz).) See also Evans & Schmalensee (2007) 
at 151 (""[P]rofit-maximizing prices may entail below-cost pricing to one set of customers over the long run and, as a matter of 
fact, many two-sided platforms charge one side prices that are below marginal cost and are [**168]  in some cases negative."")."
1865,37," For example, Dr. Bernheim's two-sided price calculations include a one-time $1 billion pre-purchase of SkyMiles paid by 
American Express to Delta Airlines—which was effectively an ""interest-free loan"" intended to provide increased liquidity for the 
airline—as well as foregone interest on these funds, as an offset to discount revenue. (Tr. at 6656:9-6659:1 (Katz), 5359:16-19 
(Miller/Delta), [**170]  5658:16-23 (Codispoti/Amex).) Ordinarily, American Express purchases SkyMiles earned on its co-brand 
card with Delta when the cardholder makes a purchase. Delta itself recognized that payments made pursuant to the co-brand 
agreement, including the $1 billion pre-purchase of SkyMiles that was critical to the airline's decision to renew its co-brand 
partnership with American Express, were not related to the discount rate or Delta's status as an Amex-accepting merchant, but 
were instead to compensate the airline for marketing, issuing, and other efforts undertaken to promote the co-brand relationship. 
(See id. at 5330:19-5331:8, 5340:13-5341:4, 5342:19-25, 5345:5-5346:23, 5376:11-20 (Miller/Delta).) "
1866,38," Similarly, Defendants note that American Express has the fewest cardholders and fewest issuing banks of any major network. 
(Defs. Post-Trial Br. at 4; see also Jt. Stmt. § 18; Tr. at 4295:16-21 (Chenault/Amex).) These metrics concern Amex's position in 
the card issuance market, which was at issue in Visa, but is not directly relevant to the court's analysis in this case. Nonetheless, 
the court recognizes that Amex's performance in the issuing market undoubtedly, though indirectly, affects its ability to compete 
against Visa, MasterCard, and Discover in the network services market. The more Amex-branded cards merchants see come 
through [**173]  their doors, the more important it is for them to accept American Express; and the breadth of Amex's merchant 
network, or consumers' perception thereof, influences cardholders' views on the utility of, and thus their willingness to adopt or 
use, an Amex card. (Tr. at 2960:7-23 (Pojero/Amex); DX7575 at '137; DX6791 at '566.) Additionally, the amount of merchant 
demand for Amex acceptance is also somewhat affected by the fact that Defendants process fewer transactions than Visa and 
MasterCard (see DX6576 at 8); however, as discussed previously, the more relevant metric for merchants considering whether 
to begin or stop accepting American Express is how much Amex cardholders are spending at the point of sale. While these 
additional metrics present a variety of competitive challenges for Amex, the network's robust share of the network services 
market when measured by charge volume suggests that these disadvantages have not precluded the network from assuming a 
dominant position in the relevant market. "
1867,39," As the court previously noted, American Express is also slower to pay funds to merchants on any given transaction as 
compared to its competitors. (See, e.g., Tr. at 188:6-18, 189:9-12 (Thiel/Alaska Airlines), 558:9-559:22 (Bouchard/Sears), 
2391:3-2392:6 (Priebe/Southwest); see also id. at 2582:1-3 (Funda/Amex) (""We recognize here there are parts of our business 
that are actually less attractive to merchants than Visa and MasterCard and speed of pay is one."").)"
1867,40," When merchant acceptance is evaluated by the percentage of merchants that accept GPCC cards that also accept Amex, 
which is referred to as ""Locations in Force Coverage,"" or ""LIF Coverage,"" American Express's coverage among GPCC-
accepting merchants is below 80%. (See Tr. at 2945:25-2946:20 (Pojero/Amex).) However, LIF Coverage is not weighted 
by [**177]  charge volume, which distorts the relevance of this statistic; when calculating LIF Coverage, for example, Delta 
Airlines and the corner florist are given equal weight. (See id. at 2852:24-2853:7 (Pojero/Amex); see also id. at 4802:13-4803:2 
(Glenn/Amex) (discussing concerns with integrity of LIF data).) Spend coverage, by contrast, reflects Amex's estimate of how 
much of its cardholders' credit card spending could be accommodated at merchants that accept American Express relative to the 
cardholders' overall GPCC spending. (See PX1412 at 8; Tr. at 1159:7-1160:8 (Quagliata/Amex), 4440:21-4441:7 
(Chenault/Amex).)"
1867,41," See Toys ""R"" Us, 221 F.3d at 930, 932, 936-37 (affirming FTC's finding of market power notwithstanding the fact that the 
defendant firm was forced to negotiate with manufacturers in order to impose the challenged restraint); United States v. Grinnell 
Corp., 236 F. Supp. 244, 254, 257 (D.R.I. 1964), aff'd in relevant part, 384 U.S. 563, 576, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778

(4th Cir. 2006) (noting that the ""prices that [Microsoft's] customers paid were negotiated and, as a consequence, were both 
discounted and unique to each transaction""). "
1871,42," In Dr. Katz's view, these responses, some of which Amex did pursue to a limited degree, represent competition on the merits. 
(Tr. at 3843:10-19 (Katz).) "
1873,43," The court, of course, recognizes that prior to the consent decrees entered [**202]  into by Visa and MasterCard in this case, 
both networks also maintained anti-steering restrictions akin to Amex's NDPs, and that all three networks' restraints likely 
contributed to Discover's decision to abandon its low-price model. Yet, based on the testimony adduced at trial, the court finds 
that a similar outcome is likely in a market subject to American Express's NDPs alone, even if these restraints do not cover every 
merchant in the United States. (See Tr. at 3841:3-9 (Katz).) "
1877,44, Such a provision ultimately was not included in the Durbin Amendment. 
1878,45," See also id. at 688:23-689:12 (Quagliata/Amex) (testifying that if steering were allowed, ""cardmembers will still have a 
choice""), 2736:14-2737:18 (Funda/Amex) (agreeing that, if merchants were permitted to offer discounts by card brand, 
customers would have a choice of benefits and could ""make a decision one way or another""), 6188:14-25 (Mitchell/Official 
Payments) (Official Payments offers customers discounts for using cheaper cards with the understanding that customers ""can 
make their own choice as to whether they want to use their rewards card or not or if it is more important for them at that moment 
in time to save some money""); PX1176 at '379 (""With selective discounting, the risk of loyal Amex Cardmembers walking away 
(not returning) is much lower; they are being offered a discount but still allowed to use Amex if they prefer."")."
1878,46," To the extent merchants realize [**221]  cost savings as a result of steering, Defendants dispute that any degree of merchant 
savings will be passed on to customers in the form of lower retail prices. Primarily, Amex relies on a report by the Reserve Bank 
of Australia (""RBA"") from April 2008 that noted there was no ""concrete evidence"" that cost savings attributable to the RBA's 
decision to regulate interchange rates and expressly permit surcharging in Australia had been passed on to consumers. (See 
DX4026 at 23; Tr. at 5817:18-5820:22 (Gilligan/Amex).) Yet when read in its entirety, the RBA's report actually supports the 
court's determination that lower discount rates resulting from removal of the NDPs will benefit consumers as merchants translate 
some amount of their lower credit card costs into lower prices. In full, the RBA noted that ""[n]o concrete evidence has been 
presented to the [RBA] regarding the pass-through of these savings, although this is not surprising, as the effect is difficult to 
isolate. The Bank had previously estimated that the cost savings would be likely to lead to the CPI being around 0.1 to 0.2 
percentage points lower than would otherwise be the case over the longer term (all else constant). It is very [**222]  difficult to 
detect this against a background where other costs are changing by much larger amounts and the CPI is increasing by around 2 
1/2 per cent per year on average. Despite the difficulties of measurement, the Board's judgment remains that the bulk of these 
savings have been, or will eventually be, passed through into savings to consumers. This judgement is consistent with standard 
economic analysis which suggests that, ultimately, changes in business costs are reflected in the prices that businesses 
charge."" (DX4026 at 23 (emphasis added).) "
1879,47," Although Discover retains its anti-steering rules at nearly all of these locations, the court does not view those provisions as a 
significant explanation for the lack of merchant steering, as discussed later in this section."
1879,48," See Tr. at 2859:19-22, 3002:13-3004:2 (Pojero/Amex) (""[M]ost of the[] merchants in the gap are very, very small merchants. . . 
. The vast majority sit well below [$]20,000 in AMEX annual charge volume potential.""); PX0021 at '127 (showing 91% of the gap 
is made up of merchants with under $50,000 in annual Amex volume); PX0890 at '353-54 (noting 75% of merchants in the gap 
are ""probably half the size"" of ""your local florist""). "
1880,49," Similarly, the fact that some larger merchants with custom acceptance agreements with American Express would ultimately 
choose not to disclose their negotiated effective discount rates at the point of sale due to confidentiality concerns (see, e.g., Tr. 
at 1306:9-1307:3 (Kimmet/Home Depot), 2211:22-2212:3 (Haslam/OfficeMax)), does not establish that this particular form of 
steering would [**230]  not be pursued by the millions of merchants subject to Amex's standard rate tables. "
1881,50," Defendants view a freely competitive network services market—that is, one without the NDPs—as inherently tilted toward Visa 
and MasterCard, given those networks' ubiquity and scale advantages. (See Tr. at 4434:21-4435:10 (Chenault/Amex) (""The 
reality is it's a total[ly] unlevel playing field."").) For instance, Amex contends that because Visa and MasterCard have more cards 
in force when compared to American Express, merchant steering will be a one-way street away from Amex, since merchants will 
not be willing to steer customers toward a card their customers may not have. (See id. at 4475:22-4478:12 (Chenault/Amex); 
6097:2-6098:20 (McNeal/Amex).) As a factual matter, Amex is correct that Visa and MasterCard have more cards in circulation. "
1882,," Moreover, an Amex cardholder almost always has a Visa or MasterCard product in [**237]  his wallet, but the reverse is not true 
to the same extent. (See Jt. Stmt. ¶ 18; Tr. at 4193:2-8 (Katz).) Yet Defendants' inferential leap that this disparity will render 
them unable to compete in a market where merchants can steer customers among the various card brands lacks support in the 
record. First, Amex's predictions about merchant willingness to steer customers to its network is belied by the steering toward 
Amex that already occurs in the co-brand and ""Official Card"" contexts. Additionally, there is no evidence in the record that 
merchants would be unwilling to attempt to steer customers if some customers do not carry their preferred form of payment. In 
other words, if merchants were economically incentivized to steer toward American Express—for example, due to lower discount 
rates or other remuneration—merchants may well be willing to undertake such efforts even if fewer than 100% of their customers 
would be able to take advantage of the offer. "
1883,51," See also Tops Mkts., 142 F.3d at 97 (noting HN34[
] ""[t]he Sherman Act protects competition as a whole in the relevant 
market, not the individual competitors within that market""); Stamatakis Indus., Inc. v. King, 965 F.2d 469, 471 (7th Cir. 1992) 
(stating the antitrust laws exist to ""protect consumers from suppliers rather than suppliers from each other"")."
1883,52," In its post-trial briefing, American Express cites only two cases for the proposition that ""it is widely recognized that vertical 
restraints can increase interbrand competition by facilitating product differentiation and competition on quality."" (Defs. Post-Trial 
Br. at 24.) Neither case is directly [**243]  applicable to the court's analysis of the NDPs. In Leegin, for example, the Supreme 
Court found the defendant's vertical agreements setting a floor below which its retailers could not price the goods in question 
were justified because ""[m]inimum resale price maintenance can stimulate interbrand competition—the competition among 
manufacturers selling different brands of the same type of product—by reducing intrabrand competition—the competition among 
retailers selling the same brand."" 551 U.S. at 890. Similarly, in New York v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., a district court held that non-
price agreements restricting intrabrand competition among defendant's wholesalers to be justified because the vertical restraints 
promoted interbrand competition by ensuring the quality, consistency, and vigorous promotion of its product. 811 F. Supp. 848, 
874-78 (E.D.N.Y. 1993). Defendants' argument concerning its NDPs is quite different from the justifications accepted by the 
courts in Leegin and Anheuser-Busch. Rather than restricting intrabrand competition in the name of fostering greater interbrand 
competition, as was the case in the two decisions cited by American Express, the NDPs impede one form of interbrand 
competition (competition on price) in the purported name [**244]  of another (increasing the number of rival firms with ""welcome 
acceptance""). Therefore, the decisions cited by Defendants have no direct bearing on the issue before the court in this case. 
And as described below, American Express may not decide on behalf of an entire market which avenues of interbrand 
competition are open and which are closed. "
1884,53," Testimony by a number of American Express witnesses further illustrates that merchant steering and a positive payment 
experience are not necessarily mutually exclusive. (See Tr. at 4575:7-10, 4576:12-18 (Chenault/Amex) (suggesting that if 
MasterCard offered a discount, free shipping, or another ""benefit"" to a customer at Whole Foods for using her MasterCard, it 
would not interfere with ""welcome acceptance"" so long as it occurred pursuant to a marketing agreement), 4550:6-4551:23 
(Chenault/Amex) (noting that when a merchant offers a discount for using a co-brand card it ""does not interfere with welcome 
acceptance""), 4557:22-4563:6, 4564:2-4565:16 (Chenault/Amex) (testifying that steering does not run afoul of ""welcome 
acceptance"" if done pursuant to a ""sponsorship"" relationship); see [**246]  also id. at 790:7-24 (Quaglita/Amex); DX7525 at '382 
(Amex's consumer research concerning the ""We Prefer Visa"" campaign concluded that ""being exposed to a payment preference 
message does not make CMs [cardmembers] and Non-CMs feel unwelcome,"" and results in negative opinions of the merchant 
rather than the network).)"
1884,54," See United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 610, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1972) (explaining that ""the 
freedom to compete . . . cannot be foreclosed with respect to one sector of the economy because certain private citizens or 
groups believe that such foreclosure might promote greater competition in a more important sector of the economy""); United 
States v. Brown Univ., 5 F.3d 658, 675 (3d Cir. 1993) (dismissing argument that a restraint led to increased competition in other 
forms of competition as a ""mere consequence of limiting price competition""). But see Sullivan v. Nat'l Football League, 34 F.3d 
1091, 1112 (1st Cir. 1994) (suggesting in dicta that courts are capable of balancing harms inflicted to intrabrand competition in 
one market with gains to interbrand competition in another, distinct market). A similar concept has been rejected in the merger 
context as well. See United States v. Phila. Nat'l Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 370, 83 S. Ct. 1715, 10 L. Ed. 2d 915 (1963) (rejecting the 
possibility that under the Clayton Act ""anticompetitive effects in one market could be justified by procompetitive consequences in 
another"")."
1884,55," American Express has previously rejected the propriety of such balancing, arguing before the Second Circuit in Visa II that ""no 
amount of issuer competition can eliminate the effects of increased prices, or reduced output, choice, or innovation at the 
network level. . . . Decreased competition in the sale of an input or intermediate good, such as network services, [**249]  is 
harmful to consumers no matter how competitive the downstream market may be."" Brief of American Express Co. as Amicus 
Curiae in Support of Affirmance at 6-7, Visa II, 344 F.3d 229 (2d Cir. 2003), 2002 WL 32828497, at *6-7. "
1886,56," Although the court declines to rely on examples of how American Express has adapted its business in those foreign countries 
where merchant steering is permitted as evidence of how the company might react in the United States, such evidence does 
illustrate Amex's adaptability as an institution. In Canada, for example, merchants since 2010 have had the ability to differentially 
discount by credit card brand and American Express continues to operate a profitable business in that country, maintaining its 
commitments to superior customer service and cardholder rewards. (See Tr. at 2694:24-2695:10 (Funda/Amex), 5737:10-5738:6 
(Gilligan/Amex).) Similarly, in Australia, after the RBA allowed merchants to impose differential surcharges by card brand, 
American Express was able to adapt to the new competitive landscape and today runs a highly profitable business [**255]  in 
that country. (See PX1442 at 18 (Chenault telling investors ""we've experienced surcharging in Australia. And while we had a 
momentary adjustment period obviously, to that, I think we were able to surmount the issues and we're running a very profitable 
business in Australia""); Tr. at 5821:6-5823:15 (Gilligan/Amex) (noting Amex's business in Australia ""started growing at a very 
healthy rate"" after surcharging began and ""we gained market share in Australia"").)"
1886,57," See Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colo., Inc., 479 U.S. 104, 117, 107 S. Ct. 484, 93 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1986) (describing the ""perverse 
result"" that would accompany a ""hold[ing] that the antitrust laws protect competitors from the loss of profits due to . . . price 
competition""); Stamatakis Indus., 965 F.2d at 471 (""[A] producer's loss is no concern of the antitrust laws, which protect 
consumers from suppliers rather than suppliers from each other.""); Drug Mart Pharmacy Corp. v. Am. Home Prods. Corp., 472 
F. Supp. 2d 385, 402 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (""[T]he antitrust laws are not intended to protect profit margins but consumer welfare."" 
(internal quotation marks omitted)). "
1887,58," At the extreme, Defendants caution that the NDPs provide important protections against the network services market ""tipping"" 
to the dominant networks, Visa and MasterCard, and that their removal could result in the market being dominated by an 
effective duopoly. (See Tr. at 5051:11-22 (Gilbert).) Again, this argument overstates the value of anti-steering rules in enhancing 
interbrand competition. Tipping describes ""the tendency of one system to pull away from its rivals in popularity once it has 
gained an initial edge,"" which is particularly relevant in markets subject to network effects, where the positive feedback 
loops [**260]  are self-reinforcing. (DX0229 at '105-06; Tr. at 4201:17-4202:8 (Katz).) Here, however, the likelihood of the 
network services market tipping to Visa and MasterCard is limited both by Amex's provision of a differentiated product and by the 
fact that merchants and cardholders typically are multi-homing—i.e., merchants accept multiple card brands, which ""greatly 
diminishes the [likelihood of] tipping and makes it feasible — or more likely that multiple networks will survive."" (Tr. at 4250:25-
4251:18 (Katz); see also id. at 4208:1-17 (Katz), 5052:2-17 (Gilbert).) Defendants present no empirical evidence to suggest that 
this market is particularly likely to tip if steering is permitted, and the quantitative evidence that was presented to the court 
suggests that the market is less susceptible to this dynamic than Amex contends. For example, the evidence shows that 
although Amex's share fell 20% between 1990 and 1995, the market did not tip to Visa and MasterCard. (Id. at 5154:11-17.)"
1887,59," In striking this equilibrium, it is possible that American Express will be forced to raise its fees to cardholders in order to offset 
declining discount revenue—in effect, requiring the recipients of its premium [**261]  rewards to bear a greater share of their 
cost. "
1888,60," As explained by Judge Easterbrook, the classic example of free-riding occurs in the context of retail distribution: Manufacturer produces a product or improvement that requires explanation [**265]  or demonstration—perhaps a television 
set with an improved degaussing coil. Retailer #1 demonstrates the effects to consumers in a showroom filled with TV sets, 
some with and some without the feature. Such a demonstration is costly in merchandise, in staff time, in floor space. 
Neither Manufacturer nor Retailer #1 can charge the consumer for this information. Its value is too uncertain to expect the 
consumer to pay for access to the sales floor, and a retailer is not apt to gain customers by threatening to charge them if 
they leave without buying. So a consumer may leave the store with valuable information; Retailer #1 recovers the cost of 
supplying this information in the purchase price of the product, not with a separate charge. Yet a consumer armed with the 
information may order the product from Retailer #2, which offers no information. Retailer #2 can make a profit at a lower 
price than does Retailer #1, for Retailer #2 has lower costs. To compete, Retailer #1 must lower its own price, and that 
means lowering its costs too—cutting cost by cutting services that consumers value. Chi. Prof'l Sports Ltd. P'ship v. Nat'l Basketball Ass'n, 961 F.2d 667, 675 (7th Cir. 1992) (citing Lester G. Telser, Why Should 
Manufacturers Want Fair Trade?, 3 J.L. & Econ. 86 (1960)). (See also Tr. at 6437:23-6438:6 [**266]  (Bernheim) (describing the 
same free-rider problem by referencing the ""expression that Best Buy is Amazon's showroom"").) "
1889,61," Drs. Bernheim and Gilbert dispute the feasibility of a fee-for-service model for American Express's marketing services. (Tr. at 
5120:13-5122:11 (Gilbert), 6447:17-6451:8 (Bernheim).) Under the current model, they argue, American [**270]  Express 
recovers the cost of supporting its merchants' marketing efforts through the merchant discount rate. They note this 
compensation structure effectively aligns the interests of both the network and merchant over the course of the promotion—both 
parties aim to increase spend—and that a fixed-fee structure would be less effective in doing so. (Id. at 6448:1-6449:11 
(Bernheim).) Yet Plaintiffs do not suggest that the only feasible pricing structure for Amex's marketing services is a fixed fee, and 
Defendants have presented insufficient justification as to why joint marketing agreements could not have incentive-based 
compensation structures that are equally effective at eliminating moral hazard and reducing potential free-riding."
1889,62," American Express does not dispute that it retains the capacity to end free-riding by a specific merchant should it so choose by, 
for example, ending the specific marketing campaign or even terminating that merchant's acceptance agreement. For example, 
when Defendants learned Marquis Jet was steering customers away from its network during a joint marketing promotion with 
American Express—i.e., precisely the kind of free-riding envisioned by Defendants—the [**271]  network terminated its "
1890,," promotion contract with Marquis Jet. (See id. at 6440:14-6441:11 (Bernheim); DX2016 at '814.) Defendants have provided no 
reason to why a similar approach, including active monitoring of the merchant's charge volume during and after the promotion, 
would be neither effective nor feasible among the limited number of merchants with whom American Express conducts such 
programs. (See Tr. at 3996:14-3997:3 (Katz).)"
1890,63," American Express also overstates the potential harm of free-riding on these types of investments. The network's ability to 
separately price and sell its merchant analytics, for example, ensures an independent incentive for the network to continue 
investing in its ability to provide these analytics-based services. Put simply, the network has a means to ensure a return on its 
investment separate and apart from the discount revenue associated with those cardholders who are successfully steered to a 
different card product."
1890,64," To the extent Amex argues that merchants could free-ride by benefitting from its cardholders' tendency to spend more on 
average without having to incur the associated costs (see Tr. at 5119:9-17 [**275]  (Gilbert)), the network has presented no 
evidence to suggest that customers steered to another card product would still spend as much as they would have if they used 
their Amex cards. "
1895,1," The instant Motion seeks [**3]  dismissal of the antitrust claims in the Second Amended Complaint brought by only four of the 
six Plaintiffs (Arapahoe Surgery Center, Cherry Creek Surgery Center, Hampden Surgery Center, and Kissing Camels Surgery 
Center) against only three of the four Defendants (Cigna Healthcare, Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., and Cigna 
Healthcare of Colorado). (SAC pp. 2, 62-63.) However, the Motion is filed by all four Defendants, and all six Plaintiffs responded 
to it. (See ECF Nos. 61 & 63.) Therefore, for the purposes of this Order, the Court will use the terms ""Plaintiffs"" and ""Defendants"" 
when referring to the parties' positions on the Motion even where not all Plaintiffs or Defendants are implicated in the underlying 
claims. "
1900,2," In Abraham v. Intermountain Health Care Inc., 461 F.3d 1249, 1263 (10th Cir. 2006), the court made reference to the 
defendant's ""procompetitive justification for limiting the number of paneled health care providers"", which the defendant argued 
increased the volume of patients each provider sees, allowing it to negotiate lower reimbursement rates to those providers. 
Cigna cites Abraham for the proposition that lowering reimbursement rates has been recognized as procompetitive. (ECF No. 61 
at 12.) The Court disagrees with Cigna's reading, as Abraham referred to this alleged ""procompetitive justification"" in the context 
of the first prong of a § 1 claim to determine whether the defendant ""may have acted independently"" rather than creating an 
inference of conspiracy. See Abraham, 461 F.3d at 1263. The Abraham court was not, as here, evaluating the second prong of a 
§ 1 claim to determine whether the conspiracy unreasonably restrained trade. As such, the Abraham court did not make a 
finding [**20]  that the defendant's proffered justification was, in fact, procompetitive. Id. "
