22,1," Plaintiff also sought a declaratory judgment that an arbitration agreement, entered into between himself [*3]  and defendant, 
was invalid. The court dismissed plaintiff's declaratory judgment claim on defendant's motion by order entered April 16, 2014."
22,2," In support of its motion for summary judgment, defendant relies on: excerpts from plaintiff's deposition transcript, (Pl.'s Dep., 
DE 55-1); plaintiff's responses to defendant's first set of requests for production (""RFP""), (Pl.'s RFP Resp., DE 55-2); plaintiff's 
response to defendant's first set of interrogatories, (Pl.'s Interrog. Resp., DE 55-3); and defendant's responses to plaintiff's first 
set of requests for admissions (""RFA""), (Def.'s RFA Resp., DE 55-4). In addition, defendant relies on an email from plaintiff to 
defense counsel, dated October 20, 2015, (Oct. 20 Email, DE 55-5); and a series of emails, one from defense counsel to 
plaintiff, dated May 21, 2015, and a response from plaintiff to defense counsel, dated May 24, 2015, (May Emails, DE 55-6)."
22,3," In support of his motion for summary judgment, plaintiff relies on: defendant's responses to his RFAs, which are substantively 
identical to defendant's RFA submission lodged in the docket at entry 55-4, (Def.'s RFA Resp., DE 65-1); and defendant's 
response to his first [*6]  RFP, (Def.'s RFP Resp., DE 65-2). In addition, plaintiff relies on two emails. Specifically, plaintiff cites 
an email from plaintiff to Chuck Murray, defendant's general manager, (Murray Email, DE 65-3); and an email from plaintiff to 
Frank Belflower, defendant's former chief operating officer, and Murray, (Belflower and Murray Email, DE 65-4). Plaintiff also 
relies on an EZ Code marketing brochure, which includes plaintiff's own notation that it was ""obtained from [defendant's] website 
on September 10, 2013,"" (EZ Code Brochure, DE 65-5); an EZ Code sales and royalty report, dated December 31, 2015, (EZ 
Code Royalty Report, DE 65-6); as well as documents published by defendant regarding dealer pricing for the EZ Code "
23,," machine, from 2008 until present, (DE 65-7). Further, plaintiff relies on several publications regarding the RapidKey 7000, the 
rights to which were sold to a third party in April 2015. Those documents include: the sales agreement between plaintiff and the 
purchaser of his rights in the RapidKey 7000, dated April 23, 2015, (Sales Agreement, DE 65-9); a picture of the RapidKey 7000, 
(RapidKey 7000 Picture, DE 65-10); a magazine article listing the RapidKey 7000 as a ""top [*7]  2015 electronic key machine,"" 
(Magazine Excerpt, DE 65-11); and a photo of the RapidKey 7000 production room and assembly line, taken around February 
2012, (DE 65-12). Finally, plaintiff relies on a print out from the P.A.C.E.R. system detailing defendant's involvement in more 
than 50 law suits, (PACER Report, DE 65-13); as well as his own affidavit, dated January 15, 2016, (Pl.'s Aff., DE 65-14). 
Plaintiff relies on these same documents in opposition to defendant's motion for summary judgment. (See Pl.'s Br., DE 62). Plaintiff also relies on the following in response to defendant's motion for summary judgment: a supplement to his affidavit, (Pl.'s 
Supp. Aff., DE 71); several pieces of marketing material related to the RapidKey 7000, (DE 71-1 through 71-4, 71-6, 71-7, 71-9); 
additional excerpts from his deposition, (Pl.'s Dep., DE 71-5); and his supplemental responses to defendant's interrogatories, 
(Pl.'s Supp. Interrog. Resp., DE 71-8)."
23,4," Defendant submitted a ""statement of material facts,"" (DE 54), to which plaintiff lodged objections. (DE 63). Defendant's 
""statement of material facts"" addresses this case's procedural posture, including plaintiff's [*8]  conduct during the course of 
discovery, rather than the material facts at issue in this dispute. As such, the court has gleaned the ""undisputed material facts"" 
from the parties' various evidentiary submissions."
23,5," At least one of plaintiff's exhibits, the Belflower and Murray Email, belies this contention in part. In [*9]  particular, part of that 
exhibit includes an advertisement for the EZ Code, apparently retrieved by plaintiff from defendant's website on or about August 
20, 2013. That brochure, with regard to the ""patent pending"" claim, reads as follows: ""The Ilco EZ Code electronic machine cuts 
traditional automotive and commercial keys by code or duplication. Features include an internal database of codes and cut 
specifications, patent pending 'Automatic Key Edge Detection' and automatic depth calibration."" (Belflower and Murray Email, 3). 
Given the lack of serial comma in the second sentence of that description, ""patent pending"" could refer to both ""Automatic Key 
Edge Detection"" and ""automatic depth calibration."" However, given the fact that ""patent pending"" immediately proceeds 
""Automatic Key Edge Detection,"" as well as the fact that the phrase ""Automatic Key Edge Detection"" is both capitalized as a 
proper noun and set off in quotations, as compared to ""automatic depth calibration,"" which is neither, the most reasonable 
construction of that document is that defendant's false ""patent pending"" mark reached only the ""Automatic Key Edge Detection"" 
feature."
23,6," Whether plaintiff and defendant were in direct competition is a disputed fact. However, in light of the resolution reached below, 
the court assumes that the parties were competitors. In any case, certain of plaintiff's evidence, in particular the marketing 
materials lodged in the docket at entry 71-3, fairly could be read to undermine this assertion. Specifically, [*11]  that document 
lists various key cutting machines, including the RapidKey 7000 and EZ Code. It describes the EZ Code as a ""code cutting"" 
machine that cuts ""edge cut [keys] - single, double, cruciform."" (DE 71-3, 3). By contrast, that document describes the RapidKey 
7000 as a ""code cutting duplicator,"" that cuts ""flat steel, safe deposit, corrugated, paracentric and Mogul [keys], single sided, 
doublesided."" (Id., 4). Although the court does not rely on this document in the statement of the facts, it does seem to undermine 
plaintiff's assertion that he and defendant were in ""direct competition"" given the apparent difference in types of keys serviced. "
24,7," In plaintiff's supplemental affidavit, he avers that he last sold the CodePro 4500 in 2011. However, in his earlier given 
deposition, plaintiff testified that he last sold that same product in 2014. Given this inconsistency, the court relies only on 
plaintiff's earlier given testimony. See Grace v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc. (In re Family Dollar FLSA Litig.), 637 F.3d 508, 512-13 
(4th Cir. 2011) (holding if affidavit inconsistent with prior deposition testimony, the court may disregard the affidavit)."
24,8," Although the Sales Agreement shows that plaintiff sold his rights in the RapidKey 7000 in April of 2015, at his deposition he 
testified that the purchaser began selling the RapidKey 7000 some six months earlier, in October of 2014. "
25,9," Plaintiff initially indicated that he sought statutory damages under 35 U.S.C. § 292 (2006), which authorized qui tam suits 
against offenders on behalf of the United States. Realtors were entitled to recover up to $500.00 for ""every such offense,"" with 
one-half of the total recovery owed to the United States. Id. However, the qui tam provision of the false marking statute was 
repealed in 2011. See 35 U.S.C. § 292 (2012). Because of the 2011 amendments, private parties, who previously could have "
26,," sued to recover statutory damages, now may recover the entire amount of loss suffered by such party as a result of ""competitive 
injury."" Id."
26,10," In Sukumar, the Federal Circuit likened the ""competitive injury"" requirement to the concept of ""injury to competition"" under 
antitrust law. See 785 F.3d at 1401."
26,11," There is evidence that plaintiff's sales, at one time, may have been as high [*20]  as 19 machines in one year. (See Pl.'s Dep., 
120:1-7). However, there is insufficient context from which to infer that plaintiff's sales ever sustained that level of success. In 
addition, there is insufficient context to suggest that plaintiff's sales were so high in the years 2006 and 2007, immediately before 
defendant's first use of the false mark. The court is unwilling to speculate on that point."
26,12," Although, arguably, the RapidKey 7000 and CodePro 4500 were not aimed at the same market, where the former apparently 
had drastically improved technology, the court herein considers them to be part of the same market. Were the court to consider 
the machines to be in different markets, it would render inapt plaintiff's claims of competitive injury to his RapidKey 7000 
intellectual property rights arising from the EZ Code's false marking, where the EZ Code and CodePro 4500, a much older 
machine, were also competitors. "
32,1," Defendants requested an expedited decision by no later than a date certain so that financing could be secured to hold their 
deal together. December 17, 2015 Tr., Docket 107 at 39. The Court committed to ruling on the merits of this controversy by no 
later than May 10, 2016. Id."
32,2," As the Court stated during the hearing: ""Let me extend my appreciation to [the paralegals]. They're the unsung heroes and 
never get the credit that they deserve. I know how hard you work to make us look good, I know that. So on behalf of everyone, 
thank you very much."" Hrg Tr. 158:8-13."
32,3," As the Court expressed many times during these proceedings, the lack of meaningful appellate review on the merits is an 
unfortunate reality of antitrust statutes. Because the administrative process before the FTC is so time consuming, most 
corporations, like Defendants in this case, cannot secure financing to keep the deal together pending the administrative trial on 
the merits. See, e.g. FTC v. Sysco Corporation, 113 F. Supp. 3d 1, 15 (2015) (noting that the Defendants announced that they 
will not proceed with the merger if the Court grants the requested injunction.)"
32,4," The Court appreciates the tremendous amount of time, money and effort Defendants put into this case, and understands that 
they genuinely believe this merger would be best for their companies, the industry and the public. While the Court's decision is 
surely a great disappointment to Defendants, the Court is optimistic that Defendants will find ways to innovate, evolve and 
remain relevant in the rapidly changing office supply industry. "

36,7," In contrast, the typical preliminary injunction standard requires a plaintiff to show: (1) irreparable harm; (2) probability of

37,8," Defendants' economic expert, Johnathan Orszag, produced several expert reports for Defendants but was not called to testify. "
38,9," Although the Merger Guidelines are not binding on this Court, the D.C. Circuit has relied on them for guidance in other merger 
cases. Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 38 (citing Heinz, 246 F.3d at 716 n.9)."
38,10," In Plaintiffs' complaint, they alleged that the relevant market was limited to large B-to-B customers, including, but not limited to 
""those that buy $1 million annually of consumable office supplies for their own use."" Id. ¶¶ 41, 45. For analytical purposes, Dr. "
39,," Shapiro drew the line at large B-to-B's that spend $500,000 or more on office supplies. Hrg Tr. 2154:16-2155:14 (Dr. Shapiro 
noting that 90 percent of Enterprise customers spend at least $500,000 on office supplies and that there is no ""magic place 
that's the right place"" to draw the line, but necessary for practical analytical purposes)."
39,11," The Court is aware of the academic observation that ""the rationale for market definition in Brown Shoe was very different from 
and at odds with the rationale for market definition in horizontal merger cases today."" Phillip E. Areeda and Herbert Hovenkamp, 
ANTITRUST LAW: AN ANALYSIS OF ANTITRUST PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION at 237 (CCH, Inc. 2015). Today the concern is that the post-merger firm might be able to raise prices without causing too much output to be lost to its 
rivals. In contrast, the Brown Shoe concern was that by reducing its price' (or improving quality at the same price), the post-
merger firm could deprive rivals of output, thus forcing them out altogether or relegating them to niche markets. Id. at 240. Nevertheless, [**30]  the Court finds the Brown Shoe factors a useful analytical tool, and as Judge Amit P. Mehta 
recognized in Sysco, ""Brown Shoe remains the law, and this court cannot ignore its dictates."" Sysco, 113 F. Supp. 3d at 27 n2. "
47,12," Tier 1 diversity suppliers are minority or veteran owned businesses that are regional in nature and generally rely on large 
nationwide office supply companies like Staples and Office Depot to service their customers. Hrg Tr. 1379 (PDME). "
49,13," ""P-Cards"" or ""procurement cards"" are the equivalent of company credit cards that allow goods to be purchased without using a 
traditional purchasing process. "
53,14," Throughout the hearing Defendants argued that the FTC's declaration drafting process, especially as it pertained to Mr. 
Wilson, was ""wrong."" Hrg Tr. 3016:11-14. As is routine in antitrust cases, the FTC began drafting declarations based on the 
interviews that were conducted. The companies and the FTC then engaged in a back-and-forth process of edits. Some 
companies found the FTC's drafts to be accurate, others, like Amazon, sought significant edits. Although the Court expressed its 
concern about this process at various times during the hearing, no evidence of an improper motive on the part of the FTC was 
ever presented. Hrg Tr. 3016-3018. "
55,15," Defendants bear the burden of showing that any proposed remedy would negate any anticompetitive effects of the merger and 
that their claimed efficiencies are: (1) merger specific; and [**85]  (2) reasonably verifiable by an independent party. H&R Block, 
833 F. Supp. 2d at 89. Because Defendants rested at the close of Plaintiffs' case-in-chief and called no witnesses to support 
their arguments related to remedies or efficiencies, they have not met their burden. "

76,4," While DDAVP was pending on appeal, Congress promulgated the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act (""FDAAA""), 
which provides in part that consideration of a citizen petition shall not delay FDA approval of an ANDA unless a ""delay is

notice to the applicant ""not later than 30 days after making such [a] determination"" along with a brief summary of the ""specific 
substantive [**17]  issues raised in the petition which form the basis of the determination."" Id. § (B). However, it is not evident 
that the FDAAA has curbed all abuses of the citizen petition process. See Michael Carrier & Daryl Wander, Citizen Petitions: An 
Empirical Study, 34 Cardozo L. Rev. 249, 283 (2012) (""[W]hat is clear is that the 2007 amendment has not been successful in

possibility that Sherman Act liability might be predicated on the time taken for the FDA to decide whether a citizen petition raises 
a legitimate public health concern. But, for reasons explained below, Apotex has not plausibly pled any such anticompetitive 
delay here."
76,5," Apotex's assertions that Acorda falsely mischaracterized trial testimony and misrepresented Apotex's bioequivalence studies

90,4," Petrie also challenges various evidentiary rulings made by the district court, including the district court's refusal to grant a 
motion to compel that Petrie filed well after the close of discovery, and the district court's decision to exclude various expert 
declarations because of its impression that the declarations would not be helpful in determining whether the Board had 
committed an antitrust violation. We are satisfied that none of the district court's evidentiary rulings in this case constituted an 
abuse of discretion, and therefore affirm. See Jacksonville Airport, Inc. v. Michkeldel, Inc., 434 F.3d 729, 732 (4th Cir. 2006) 
(noting that HN11[
] a district court's evidentiary rulings [**11]  are reviewed for abuse of discretion). "
110,1," Although a relatively brief time has elapsed since the hearing, the court would not want this decision to be deemed a rush to 
judgment. The court has been aware from the time the Complaint was filed that this matter is time sensitive because ""WHDH will 
cease to be an NBC affiliate on January 1, 2017."" Dkt. # 3 (WHDH's Motion to Expedite). Consequently, the court has studied 
the pleadings as they have been filed. Any remaining questions were resolved at the very thorough and informative May 12 
hearing. "
111,2, The well-pled and plausible facts of the Complaint are accepted as true for purposes of evaluating a motion to dismiss. 
112,3," In Section 2, Comcast agreed not to migrate the telecast of major sporting events (such as the Olympics) from broadcast to 
cable stations. Compl. - Ex. A. at 2-3. In Section 3, Comcast agreed that NBC ""will remain solely responsible for negotiating 
network affiliation agreements with NBC Local Affiliates"" and the negotiations will [**7]  be conducted ""separate from, and 
without [being] influence[d]"" by Comcast's cable interests. Id. at 3-4. In Section 7, Comcast agreed to honor NBC's agreements 
and side letters with affiliate stations and ratify other measures maintaining affiliate market integrity. Id. at 4-5."
112,4," The retransmission market refers to the payment of fees by cable companies to broadcasters for the right to retransmit the 
broadcast signals over cable."
112,5," WHDH claims that its broadcast spectrum alone has a fair market value of over $454 million. By way of background, a 
spectrum license is required for over-the-air broadcasting. The license permits the holder to broadcast on a specific radio 
frequency in a defined geographic area. From time to time, the FCC conducts auctions of broadcast spectrums. See [**9]  id. ¶ 
94. "
113,6," The Complaint is silent as to whether these viewers may have access to free over-the-air NBC programming from another 
source, such as WJAR, in Providence, Rhode Island."
113,7," WHDH relies [**13]  on the language in Section 1 that [a]s Comcast negotiates and renews agreements with its broadcast affiliates, Comcast will continue its cooperative 
dialogue with its affiliates toward a business model to sustain free over-the-air service that can be workable in the evolving 
economic and technological environment as a promise to negotiate in good faith with affiliate stations. WHDH asserts that Comcast's subsequent failure to negotiate with 
it breached Comcast's explicit undertaking to engage in a ""cooperative dialogue."" To the extent that a breach of a promise to 
negotiate in good faith constitutes a cognizable claim under Pennsylvania law, courts are uniform in holding that a mere promise 
to negotiate in good faith, absent predefined terms or a general framework in which to conduct negotiations, will not support a 
claim. See Clark Res., Inc. v. Verizon Bus. Network Servs., Inc., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46154, 2011 WL 1627074, at *4 (M.D. 
Pa. Apr. 29, 2011), citing Jenkins v. Cty. of Schuylkill, 441 Pa. Super. 642, 652-653, 658 A.2d 380 (1995); see also Channel "

contract in the future does not alone constitute a contract.""). As the court explained during its dialogue with counsel at oral argument, the lack of pre-agreed terms is also an impediment to 
fashioning the injunctive relief sought by WHDH on its contract and antitrust claims. The court cannot give effect to the 
parties' [**14]  unexpressed intent. As the Supreme Court cautioned, ""[n]o court should impose a duty to deal that it cannot 
explain or adequately and reasonably supervise. The problem should be deemed irremedia[ble] by antitrust law when 
compulsory access requires the court to assume the day-to-day controls characteristic of a regulatory agency."" Verizon 
Commc'ns Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 540 U.S. 398, 415, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004)."
114,8," Under Pennsylvania law, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not create substantive rights that do not exist 
in the contract itself and a claim for a breach of the covenant is subsumed in the breach of contract claim. Burton v. Teleflex Inc., 
707 F.3d 417, 432-433 (3d Cir. 2013). "
115,9," The Massachusetts Antitrust Act is to ""be construed in harmony with judicial interpretation of comparable federal antitrust 
statutes insofar as practicable."" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93, § 1."
115,10," Comcast disputes WHDH's allegation of monopolistic power in the commercial television market because it contends that 
broadcast and cable television stations operate in two separate and distinct markets. Even under the all-inclusive definition of 
the relevant market pled in the Complaint, Comcast is only one of 10 established commercial television outlets competing in 
Boston and its environs. See Compl. ¶ 120. "
116,11," WHDH contends that Comcast is also a horizontal competitor in the Boston market because its cable transmissions compete 
with the broadcast stations for viewers. Even accepting WHDH's definition of the market, this argument ignores a key historical 
fact — that WHDH's affiliate contract with its self-executing expiration date was negotiated with NBC before the merger of NBC 
with Comcast. During oral argument, WHDH conceded that had NBC, as an entity independent of Comcast, decided to replace 
WHDH with a new affiliate at the expiration of WHDH's contract, there would be no antitrust violation. The flexibility to switch 
affiliates or substitute an owner-operated broadcast station is the right that NBC had bargained for with WHDH by incorporating 
the expiration date in the affiliation contract. Incongruently, WHDH also insisted at oral argument that the antitrust laws would be 
violated even if Comcast (not NBC) were to replace it with another affiliate instead of building its own station. The court fails to 
see how the introduction of a new broadcast station into the Boston market, as Comcast proposes, would harm competition 
among broadcasters."
116,12," The vertical relationship between [**22]  a network and its affiliate stations is no more clearly illustrated than by the court's 
recollection that WHDH was a CBS station prior to its becoming an NBC affiliate in 1995."
116,13," Comcast notes that, as acknowledged by the FCC Order, this is a business model that NBC had imposed in other large 
metropolitan markets long before the instant dispute with Comcast See FCC Order at 173."
116,14," RCN Boston, for example, currently offers nearly 400 channels from around the world. http://www.rcn.com/boston/digital-

117,15, Comcast also attacks the misrepresentation theory as lacking the particularity required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 9 in pleading fraud.
117,16," Comcast denies that it deliberately led WHDH down a primrose path. As it points out, although no notice of an intent not to 
renew was required by the affiliation contract, the Complaint admits that Comcast gave WHDH 16 months' advance notice of its 
intentions. See Compl. ¶ 91."
117,17," Comcast also argues that this theory fails because WHDH does not identify a breach of a specific term of the FCC Order 
(Commitment 1 was not incorporated in the final FCC Order), nor does WHDH point to a commitment by Comcast that it 
would [**27]  maintain the existing signal strength of each of its NBC stations. "
127,1, Hershey Canada is the only one of the Canadian Chocolate Manufacturers that is a party to this appeal.
127,2," Because we conclude that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment for the Chocolate Manufacturers, we do not 
reach the secondary question of whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding a portion of the Individual Plaintiffs' 
economic expert's report calculating the damages caused by Nestle USA. "
128,3," Trade spend refers to rebates, allowances, discounts, and promotions that manufacturers individually negotiate with retailers 
that effectively lower the price that the customer pays. "
129,4," Several defendants also moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(2). After initially deferring ruling on 
these motions, the District Court ultimately granted the motions as to Mars Canada, Nestle S.A., and Nestle Canada. See In re 
Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., 641 F. Supp. 2d 367, 373 (M.D. Pa. 2009)."

130,6," As explained earlier, we do not reach this issue because we will affirm the District Court's summary judgment. See supra note 
2."
130,7," A horizontal price-fixing agreement occurs when competitors on the same market level agree to fix or control prices for their 
goods or services. "
131,8," We illustrated the point well in Flat Glass by comparing the theories involved in Matsushita and Petruzzi's, see 385 F.3d at 358, 
and we summarize that discussion here. In Matsushita, the Supreme Court criticized the alleged multi-firm, predatory pricing 
scheme as inherently ""speculative,"" so the Court refused to draw an inference of a conspiracy from ambiguous evidence. See 
475 U.S. at 588-91, 597-98. In Petruzzi's, by contrast, we drew more liberal inferences in the plaintiffs favor because the 
plaintiffs theory—that the defendants conspired not to compete with each other on existing customer accounts—made ""perfect 
economic sense."" 998 F.2d at 1232. The only way for the defendants in Petruzzi's to increase profits in this manner was by 
agreement. Moreover, this conduct of refusing to compete was obviously not procompetitive. Id."
131,9," The ""strictures of Matsushita d[o] not apply"" when plaintiffs use direct evidence to prove a conspiracy because ""no inferences 
are required from direct evidence to establish a fact,"" thus negating any concern about the reasonableness of the inferences 
drawn from that evidence. Petruzzi's, 998 F.2d at 1233. Nor are these concerns implicated when there is ""strong circumstantial 
evidence"" because such evidence is ""sufficiently unambiguous."" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). "
132,10," An oligopoly is a market ""in which a few relatively large sellers account for the bulk of the output."" 2B Phillip E. Areeda & 
Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 404a, at 10 (4th ed. 2014). "
133,11," Line pricing is the practice engaged in by retailers of setting the same retail price for competing candy products of the same 
size. Given the practice of line pricing, the Chocolate Manufacturers contend that once one manufacturer raises list prices, it "
134,," makes sense for all to follow. If a retailer raises the retail price on all competing candy products of a given size in response to 
one manufacturer raising list prices, the other manufacturers will suffer a decline in sales volume due to the higher retail price 
and lose out on any increased revenue unless they follow the list price increase. See J.A. 1084; see also J.A. 1278 (Mars 2002 
document explaining it would follow Hershey's price increase on kings because ""the market would move to the higher price with 
or without us"")."
134,12," This case is quite different from Petruzzi's, where we said the economic evidence went ""a long way"" in meeting the plaintiffs 
burden. 998 F.2d at 1241. There the alleged conspiracy was not price fixing but instead an agreement to compete only on new 
customer accounts and not to compete on existing customer accounts (i.e., competition ended once a defendant ""won"" a new 
account). The industry (fat and bone rendering) was homogeneous, meaning the only basis for competition among the 
defendants was price. The economic evidence in Petruzzi's showed a price differential between new and existing accounts (new 
accounts were offered a significantly better price than were existing accounts), which could only rationally be explained by an 
unlawful agreement Id. Here, by contrast, the Plaintiffs' economic evidence is based on parallel price increases among 
oligopolists without corresponding cost increases, a result which, as previously noted, is as consistent with interdependence as 
with a conspiracy. "
136,13," Our decision in Flat Glass is not to the contrary. There we noted in dicta that evidence of a defendant's price fixing in a market 
for original equipment manufacturer glass would be relevant to the claim that the same defendant also conspired to fix prices in 
the market for flat glass, a closely related but distinct product market in the same geographic area. See 385 F.3d at 377--78. The 
evidence in Flat Glass involved identical companies and one executive who participated in the price-fixing conspiracies in both 
product markets. It is therefore consistent with the rule stated above because the people and companies involved in both 
conspiracies overlapped. Nor does the standard we adopt here conflict with Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 
1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962). Continental Ore is inapposite because the relevant foreign conduct in that case was part of a 
single conspiracy that ""was effectuated both here and abroad,"" id. at 706, and the Plaintiffs do not contend a single conspiracy 
existed here. "
137,14," We have doubts about the actuation theory and whether it unduly blurs an already fine line between lawful interdependence 
and unlawful conspiracies, especially when the alleged conspiracy involves price fixing among oligopolists supposedly formed by 
a tacit agreement. ""[EJven when each firm rests its own [pricing] decision upon its belief that competitors will do the same,"" that 
only shows interdependence, not a conspiracy. Clamp-All, 851 F.2d at 484. But because the District Court concluded that Dr. 
Vellturo's theory was admissible and the Chocolate Manufacturers do not challenge that decision on appeal, we reject the 
theory's application on its own terms."
137,15," Dr. Vellturo's explanation of the actuation theory in his report drives home the point. There he opines that before 2002, the 
Chocolate Manufacturers were unable to raise prices together. Posing a thought experiment, he says to ""consider a scenario in 
which U.S. executives from each Defendant with pricing authority for both the U.S. and Canada fly to a meeting in Canada"" and 
""[w]ithout ever uttering an express word regarding U.S. prices, the three executives agree to raise prices in Canada by 10%."" 
J.A. 2193. The thought experiment continues with the executives returning to the U.S. and monitoring the Canadian outcomes, 
and then, without any further communication, one firm announces a price increase of 10% in the U.S. Dr. Vellturo opines that 
under these circumstances, the ""coordinated anticompetitive agreement in Canada has significantly changed the information 
known about likely responses to a price increase in the U.S. by these same companies,"" with the price leader expecting the "
138,," other companies to follow the price increase. J.A. 2194. This thought experiment presumes not only that the conspirators in the 
U.S. knew of the Canadian conspiracy but also that the U.S. conspirators are the same people as the Canadian conspirators. Moreover, at oral argument, counsel for the Individual Plaintiffs clearly explained that Dr. Vellturo premised his theory on 
evidence showing ""that the U.S. executives with pricing authority at a minimum knew that there was a [sic] joint conduct in 
Canada, 
[and] 
at 
a 
maximum 
directed 
that 
it 
occur.""

available 
at 
http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/oralargument/audio/14-2790InReChocolateConfectionaryAntitrust.mp3. That being said, Dr. Vellturo backtracked in his deposition by asserting that the U.S. Chocolate Manufacturers' awareness of the 
Canadian conspiracy was ""not essential to [his] opinion."" J.A. 2529. In that case, we acknowledge that the factual prerequisites 
for this variation of the actuation theory—that the Chocolate Manufacturers monitored Canadian prices and communicated 
(lawfully) with their Canadian affiliates—are satisfied. But under this variant theory, the inference of a U.S. conspiracy is tenuous 
because the U.S. result of parallel pricing is perfectly consistent with interdependence. See Areeda & Hovenkamp, supra, ¶ 
1422b, at 170 (noting that facilitating devices alone do not imply a traditional conspiracy because ""any parallelism in subsequent 
behavior will often be of the sort that can be satisfactorily explained by oligopolistic interdependence alone and without regard to 
the facilitating practice"")."
138,16," To the extent Dr. Vellturo's opinion is based only on similar outcomes, see supra note 15, it is insufficient on its own to create 
a reasonable inference of a conspiracy."
138,17," ""My father taught me... keep your friends close, but your enemies closer."" The Godfather Part II (Paramount Pictures 1974). "
139,18," A September 2005 email from Don Robinson, President of Mars Canada, to Robert Gamgort, President of Mars North 
America, does not show that Mars executives in the U.S. knew of the Canadian conspiracy. In that email, Robinson said that ""an 
industry wide price increase has been rumoured for a few weeks"" and reported the price increases already taken and being 
taken by Mars Canada's competitors. J.A. 1395. Unlike the aforementioned 2003 Brown to Snyder email, for example (which 
suggested that Hershey Canada contemplated a coordinated response to a Nestle Canada price increase with its rivals), this 
Mars email does not include information that tends to show a Canadian conspiracy. Nor does a March 2002 email from Frank Higgins, Vice President of Marketing for Nestle USA, to other Nestle USA executives 
show that Nestle USA knew of the ongoing Canadian conspiracy. In that email, Higgins reported on a Hershey Canada price 
increase and promised he would ""get[] more information from Nestl[e] Canada to assess the likelihood that they will increase 
prices in the US."" J.A. 7394. This email shows that Nestle USA monitored outcomes in Canada but says nothing of whether 
Nestle USA knew the price increases there were the result of interdependence or a conspiracy. "
141,19," Compare J.A. 7105 (2002 Hershey internal document explaining that ""the bidders conducted extensive due diligence reviews 
and were provided with additional information as requested (in some instances for competitive and regulatory reasons only 
certain non-operational personnel of potential bidders were provided information)""), and J.A. 13295-96 (Direct Purchaser Class's 
expert acknowledging the complete lack of record evidence showing that either Nestle S.A. or Nestle USA received information 
about Hershey's commodities cost coverage), with J.A. 12843^15 (Cadbury officer acknowledging that Cadbury received 
information about Hershey's commodities cost coverage in an email from an investment banker working for Hershey during the

163,15," The district court's musing that the same harm could have occurred if the defendants each ""independently"" submitted a

LIBOR fix, and largely consistent with the published LIBOR fix in the other tenors. Using probability analysis, the consulting 
expert then calculated the likelihood to be less than 1 % that UBS could have achieved this remarkable consistency based on 
consideration of the prior day's interquartile range LIBOR Panel Bank submissions."" (bolding and emphasis in original)). "
177,1," Because this matter is before the Court on a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept as true the allegations set forth in the 
complaint. See Hosp. Bldg. Co. v. Trs. of Rex Hosp., 425 U.S. 738, 740, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1976). "
179,2," In another section, the FAC alleges ""Defendants also uniformly demanded the 'opt-out' of their respective members' data (their 
Realtor members' data) from the syndication feed, thereby significantly reducing the data feed Plaintiff received by 30 percent."" 
[FAC ¶ 53.] "
182,3," Further, where fees have been awarded to those that are not parties to a contract, the movant generally has been a third-party 
beneficiary of the contract. The Association Defendants do not claim to be third-party beneficiaries to the Service Center 
Agreement. Even in such a case, ""a nonsignatory seeking relief as a third-party beneficiary may recover fees under a fee 
provision only if it appears that the contracting parties intended to extend such a right to one in his position."" Hyduke's, 189 Cal. 
App. 4th at 436 (internal quotations and alterations omitted); see also Sessions Payroll Management, Inc. v. Noble Const. Co., 
Inc., 84 Cal. App. 4th 671, 101 Cal. Rptr. 2d 127 (Ct. App. 2000). There is no evidence of such intent here."
182,4," Because the Court finds the Association Defendants are not entitled to fees under section 1717, it declines to address Plaintiff's 
argument that the amount of fees Defendants request is unreasonable."
182,5," Because all Defendants join in each other's arguments in support of their motions to dismiss, the Court will not differentiate 
between the two motions unless specified herein. "
183,6," Plaintiff also seeks judicial notice of a webpage illustrating that Plaintiff San Diego Association of Realtors owns the name 
""Greater San Diego Association of Realtors."" The Court need not take judicial notice of this page in order to conclude that this 
case should not be dismissed based on Plaintiff's alleged procedural error. Accordingly, Plaintiff's request for judicial notice is 
DENIED AS MOOT."
183,7," In the FAC and throughout the parties' briefs, the parties treat Plaintiff's Cartwright Act claim as rising or falling with the 
Sherman Act claim. Accordingly, the Court addresses them as such. "
185,8," Further, the type of per se violation Plaintiff alleges occurred here—group boycotts, also described as a concerted refusals to 
deal—are often, but not always, considered per se restraints. Nw. Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pac. Stationery & Printing Co.,

191,1," Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement with Blue Sky Studios, Inc. ECF Nos. 249, 282. Blue 
Sky Studios, Inc. thus did not join Defendants' opposition to class certification. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for preliminary "

227,13," Defendants contend that this case is akin to Backhaut, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107519, 2015 WL 4776427, at *13-15, where 
this Court found that certification of a class was improper, in part, because of the predominance of individualized inquiries as to "
228,," whether individual plaintiffs impliedly consented to interception of their text messages. Defendants' reliance on Backhaut is 
inapposite for at least two reasons. First, in Backhaut the plaintiffs did not offer any response to the defendant's arguments that 
the need for individualized inquiries into the statutory consent defense under the Wiretap Act would render the case 
unmanageable. 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107519, [WL] at *15. Second, and more importantly, the statutory [**137]  defense at 
issue in Backhaut required a determination of the presence or absence of actual consent—not constructive consent. 2015 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 107519, [WL] at *14 (""Consent may be explicit or implied, but it must be actual consent rather than constructive 
consent."") (quotation marks omitted). As a result, the inquiry in Backhaut was necessarily individualized because it focused on 
the presence or absence of actual consent of each class member, not on whether the defendant could demonstrate some form 
of constructive consent. See id. Here, by contrast, Defendants' proof is largely directed to constructive knowledge."
228,14," Defendants' quotation of Dukes replaces ""statutory defenses"" with ""defenses,"" thus divorcing the quoted language from the 
statutory context in which it was made. Opp. at 2 (quoting Dukes, 564 U.S. at 367). No such statutory defenses are at issue 
here. "
229,15," DreamWorks does not appear to contend that the arbitration clauses in its other employment agreements differ materially from

240,1," The denial of the exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action directed to HPC's other causes of action, i.e.

] In any event, product market [**17]  definition turns on the existence of close substitutes, not the ability to switch 
effortlessly to such substitutes. "
247,1," On January 7 & 8, 2016, BUSA filed dozens of nearly identical lawsuits—in federal and state court—against distributors whom 
BUSA had terminated, including Young's and its related entities in several other states. As a result, Young's is currently a 
defendant in four additional federal cases in this district and in five state cases that BUSA filed in the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of 
Florida."
247,2," BUSA's new distributor, Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, LLC, is not a party to this lawsuit. "
248,3," Young's moved to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (b)(6). Because the Court declines to exercise 
jurisdiction [**4]  over BUSA's Complaint even if there is subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), it is not necessary to 
reach a determination as to whether BUSA failed to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6)."
248,4," Attached as exhibits to the Complaint are [**6]  the 2004 Agreement, the RFP Intent to Bid form, and the RFP Terms and 
Conditions, among other documents. "
249,5," The 2004 Agreement also includes a mandatory dispute resolution clause—not mentioned by either party—which reads in 
pertinent part: The parties will seek to resolve any controversy, disagreement, claim, or dispute between them which relates to or arises 
out of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the interpretation, breach or termination thereof, or which is otherwise 
related in any manner to the relationship between BUSA and DISTRIBUTOR (whether based in contract, tort, statute, or 
upon any other type of cause of action or theory of recovery whatsoever) (in each case, a ""Dispute"") in accordance with the 
following terms and conditions: . . . The parties shall first attempt to settle any Dispute amicably and promptly by consulting and negotiating with each other 
in good faith. In the event of a Dispute, either party shall notify the other party in writing regarding the existence of such 
Dispute (the ""Dispute Notice""). If the Dispute is not resolved or settled through direct negotiations between the parties 
within thirty (30) days after the receipt by one party of the Dispute [**7]  Notice, then the parties shall seek to resolve the 
Dispute through confidential mediation within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the aforementioned thirty (30) day 
negotiation period. The parties will select one (1) mediator by mutual consent. . . . If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation . . . then the Dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and 
venue of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida or, in the event that such court does not have 
subject matter jurisdiction over such proceeding, in the courts of the State of Florida located in Miami-Dade County, Florida 
(each, the ""Court"") . . . Further, each party certifies that no representative or agent of either party has represented, 
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of such litigation, seek to enforce this waiver provision. Each 
party acknowledges that this provision is a material inducement for the other party entering into this agreement. [DE-1-2, p. 12.] "
251,6," In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit [**13]  adopted as binding 
precedent the decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to October 1, 1981. "
254,7, BUSA voluntarily dismissed these cases after removal and then re-filed state actions against Young's without antitrust claims. 
260,1," Several of the courts of appeals noted in this paragraph, following the lead of the Second Circuit in Bankers Trust Co. v. 
Rhoades, have adopted the broader position that even a ""new and independent injury"" from the same predicate act may ground 
a new lawsuit. Bankers Trust, 859 F.2d 1096, 1103 (""At a later date, when a new and independent injury is incurred from the 
same violation, the plaintiff is again 'injured in his business or property' and his right to sue for damages from that injury accrues 
at the time he discovered or should have discovered that injury.""). If a new injury from past conduct can create grounds for a new 
legal claim, then, plainly, new injuries from new conduct must allow a new legal claim as well. See Love v. Nat'l Med. 
Enterprises, 230 F.3d at 775 (stating rule from Bankers Trust and applying it to injuries from new conduct). "
261,2," Defendants cite a number of other Fourth Circuit cases in an attempt to bolster their position, but these cases simply reiterate 
the ""injury discovery"" rule, which, as the court explained above, does not conflict with the ""separate accrual"" rule. See, e.g., 
Dickerson v. TLC The Laser Eye Ctr. Inst., Inc., 493 F. App'x 390 (4th Cir. 2012); Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Elec. Motor & 
Supply, Inc., 262 F.3d 260, 266 (4th Cir. 2001)(""[T]he application of the statute of limitations essentially turns on the question of 
whether, with respect to each alleged injury, PEPCO knew or should have known of its injury prior to July 29, 1994"")(emphasis 
added); CVLR Performance Horses, Inc. v. Wynne, 792 F.3d 469, 476 (4th Cir. 2015). No circuit-level authority cited by 
defendants demonstrates a rejection of the separate [*13]  accrual rule. "
262,3," Defendants appear also to state that, if all of plaintiffs' RICO counts are sufficiently ""related"" to each other to form a pattern, 
then each new event alleged cannot also be sufficiently independent to support recovery under the separate accrual rule. Def. 
Repl. to Pl. Resp. to Def. Mot. to Reconsider at *5-6 (""Plaintiffs cannot have it both ways, either the RICO Act applies and all 
predicate acts are part of a pattern of racketeering activities or RICO does not apply and Plaintiffs' claims must fail because the 
acts are not substantially related and cannot be part of a civil RICO claim.""); see also Def. Repl. to Pl. Resp. to Mot. for Summ. 
J. at *6-7. This argument must fail. First, the statute allows suit based on a ""pattern of racketeering activity,"" which is ""two acts of 
racketeering activity, one of which occurred . . . within ten years . . . after the commission of a prior act."" 18 U.S.C. § 1961. If the 
statute [*15]  of limitations for a ""pattern"" expired four years after discovery of the first injury in the pattern, no claim could ever 
lie for two events ten years apart unless the first injury was not discovered until long after it was inflicted. Defendants' theory thus 
appears to be at odds with the statute's language. Moreover, the separate accrual rule could never apply if events in all RICO 
patterns were so related that no additional injury in a pattern could ever be ""new and independent."" "
264,4," See 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (""[J]urisdiction . . . shall be exercised and enforced in conformity with the laws of the United States, so 
far as such laws are suitable to carry the same into effect; but in all cases where they are not adapted to the object, or are 
deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies and punish offenses against law, the common law, as modified 
and changed by the constitution and statutes of the State wherein the court having jurisdiction of such civil or criminal cause is 
held, so far as the same is not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States, shall be extended to and govern 
the said courts in the trial and disposition of the cause. . . ."")(emphasis added)."
264,5," Our court of appeals has disagreed with the Second Circuit, and has held that EMTALA is not consistent with state notice-of-
claim statutes. Power v. Arlington Hosp. Ass'n, 42 F.3d 851, 866 (4th Cir. 1994)(""We do not read § 1395dd(d)(2)(A) as expressly 
or impliedly incorporating state-mandated procedural requirements for EMTALA claims. The statute refers us to state law only in 
determining 'those damages available for personal injury' actions against hospitals, no further."")."
264,6," The application of notice-of-claim statutes to RICO may differ from the analysis for Section 1983 and certain other federal laws 
if RICO is determined not to be a ""civil rights law"" to which Section 1988(a) applies. See Isle of Wight Cty. Sch. Bd., 402 F.3d at 
475 (noting that the Section 1988(a) ""deficiency"" analysis applied to the statute at issue because it was a ""civil rights"" law); but 
see Hardy, 164 F.3d at 793 (applying ""deficiency"" analysis without determining that statute at issue implicated civil rights). "
265,7," The statute has evidently been used only to dismiss claims that originate in state court and do not arise under Section 1983. 
Petersen v. W. Virginia Univ. Bd. of Governors, No. 2:06-CV-0664, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56125, 2007 WL 2220192 (S.D.W. 
Va. July 31, 2007). "
267,8," The DVD of Anderson's fight in Williamson, and Pauley's discussion with Anderson regarding his disqualification, is marked as 
Exhibit C to Defendants' Reply to Plaintiffs' Response to the Motion for Summary Judgment and Partial Summary Judgment

269,9," Defendants cite § 55-17-1(a), which states the findings of the legislature that support the enactments contained elsewhere in 
Article 17 of the statute. W. Va. Code § 55-17-1(a)(""The Legislature further finds that protection of the public interest is best 
served by clarifying that no government agency may be subject to awards of punitive damages in any judicial proceeding."")."
269,10," Defendants note that they have been sued in their individual and official capacities, but suggest that punitive damages may 
not be recovered against them because ""Defendants . . . were acting in their official capacities as public officials and agents of 
the State of West Virginia in all counts of this suit."" Def. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. at *18. The fact that defendants "
270,," were engaged in work on behalf of the state during the events of the case does not mean that individual-capacity claims cannot 
lie, see, e.g., Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908), and if such claims lie, they may support 
punitive awards."

if: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class."
283,3," Rule 23(b)(3) provides: (b) Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if Rule 23(a) is satisfied and if: (3) the court finds that the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only 
individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the 
controversy. The matters pertinent to these findings include: (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action. "
307,1," John Moore cross-appeals the trial court's evidentiary rulings, contending that it erred in issuing them after the motion to 
dismiss was overruled by operation of law. The defendants respond that all of their objections to the evidence should have been 
sustained. Because our disposition does not turn on a ruling excluding any particular evidence from the Valentine affidavit, we 
need not reach the parties' challenges to the trial court's rulings on the evidence. "

319,2," The applicability of Direct Commercial Funding, which the Bureau contends was wrongly decided, was an unknown variable. 
Litigants in Harris County and the nine other counties that constitute the First and Fourteenth Judicial Districts do not know 
which appellate court will have jurisdiction over an appeal until after filing a notice of appeal. See Tex. Gov't Code § 22.202(h). 
The litigants in this appeal reasonably may have expected an appeal to be heard by the First Court of Appeals due to the 
assignment of a prior related appeal to this court, see 1st Tex. App. (Houston) Loc. R. 1.3(b), but they could not have known with 
certainty whether this court would adopt [**55]  the Fourteenth Court's reasoning in Direct Commercial Funding. For a discussion 
of this peculiar feature of appellate jurisdiction over some Texas counties and some of its undesirable consequences, see 
generally Kem Thompson Frost, Predictability in the Law, Prized Yet Not Promoted: A Study in Judicial Priorities, 67 Baylor L. 
Rev. 48 (2015)."
319,3," After the Bureau filed its notice of interlocutory appeal, the trial court signed an order staying further proceedings in the case. 
The court explained that its order granting the motion to dismiss was entered 14 days after the statutory deadline due to the 
volume of material the parties filed (a combined total of 1,601 pages) and a ""busier-than-normal"" month. The order detailed what 
the court was doing during the 30-day window for ruling on the motion to dismiss, including: (1) three jury trials; (2) a three-day 
bench trial; (3) 129 motions set for submission with or without oral hearing; and (4) 254 uncontested motions or requests. The 
court also noted that it was in trial for a total of 14 days and had no support in the form of a briefing attorney, law clerk, or 
associate judge."
319,4," To the extent the court relies on a legislator's statement of intent for the proposition that the ""legislative intent"" of section 
51.014(a)(12) of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code is ""to provide for a right of interlocutory appeal in all possible 
circumstances,"" this court has rejected the relevance of that particular artifact of legislative history in both Paulsen v. Yarrell, 455 
S.W.3d 192, 196 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.), and Schlumberger Ltd. v. Rutherford, 472 S.W.3d 881, 887-89 
(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.). "
320,5," See, e.g., Direct Commercial Funding, Inc. v. Beacon Hill Estates, LLC, 407 S.W.3d 398, 401 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]

(observing that ""there is no provision for extension of the thirty-day period in section 27.005(a),"" but not actually holding that a 
trial court is therefore powerless to rule after day 30). "
322,6," See Fruehauf, 848 S.W.2d at 84. When the Direct Commercial Funding court examined the statute, it noted the absence of any 
provision specifically authorizing the court to grant a motion to dismiss more than 30 days after the hearing and concluded that 
the court was not authorized to do so. Direct Commercial Funding, 407 S.W.3d at 402. My analysis reaches the opposite 
conclusion. No provision specifies that the 30-day deadline for ruling on a motion to dismiss deprives the court of any power it 
otherwise would have following entry of an interlocutory order. Cf. In re Brehmer, 428 S.W.3d 920, 921 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 
2014, orig. proceeding). I would not read additional terms into the statute that are absent from what was enacted by the 
Legislature in order to create a jurisdictional bar. See Laidlaw Waste Sys. (Dallas), Inc. v. City of Wilmer, 904 S.W.2d 656, 659 
(Tex. 1995)."
322,7," To the extent it matters, see Crosstex Energy Services, L.P. v. Pro Plus, Inc., 430 S.W.3d 384, 392 (Tex. 2014), a jurisdictional 
bar does not advance the enacted statement of the TCPA's purpose, ""to encourage and safeguard the constitutional rights of 
persons to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise participate in government to the maximum extent permitted by 
law and, at the same time, protect the rights of a person to file meritorious lawsuits for demonstrable injury."" Tex. Civ. Prac. & 
Rem. Code § 27.002. Instead of facilitating a prompt dismissal, treating the 30-day [**64]  deadline as jurisdictional only forces 
the parties into an unnecessary ancillary track of interlocutory appellate litigation like the one before us. Cf. Fruehauf, 848 
S.W.2d at 84 (avoiding needless restriction on the trial court which would create unnecessary litigation and be inconsistent with 
the notion of inherent plenary power vested in the trial courts). Instead of allowing the trial court to correct its own error by 
dismissing the case before the movant invokes the right of appeal and associated stay of proceedings (which efficiently can be 
accomplished by a one-line order granting the motion), such an interpretation forces the parties to relitigate the issue before an 
appellate court, which is obliged to write a full-blown opinion explaining its reasoning. See Tex. R. App. P. 47.1. In the event of a 
reversal, all that is accomplished is that the trial court is compelled to do something it otherwise could have done on its own 
much more efficiently, as the trial court in this case attempted to do. Nothing in the TCPA suggests the Legislature intended to 
require such an inefficient process. As such, neither judicial economy nor the purpose of the statute are served by reading into 
the statute an exception to the general rule [**65]  of continuing plenary power over interlocutory orders."
322,8," See Hernandez v. Ebrom, 289 S.W.3d 316, 319 (Tex. 2009) (""Appeals of some interlocutory orders become moot because the 
orders have been rendered moot by subsequent orders.""); State Bar of Texas v. Gomez, 891 S.W.2d 243, 245 (Tex. 1994) 
(""Subject matter jurisdiction requires . . . that there be a live controversy between the parties . . . .""). "
323,9," This procedural fact distinguishes the case of Dallas Morning News, Inc. v. Mapp, No. 05-14-00848-CV, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 
6600, 2015 WL 3932868 (Tex. App.—Dallas June 26, 2015, no pet.), in which a TCPA motion to dismiss was denied by 
operation of law, the movant filed notice of an interlocutory appeal, and the trial court subsequently purported to enter a final 
judgment dismissing the case pursuant to the TCPA. The court of appeals in that case found Rule 29.5 to be inapplicable, but for 
a different reason—that under the reasoning of Direct Commercial Funding, ""the trial judge took an act prohibited by statute 
when she signed an order outside the statutorily mandated time period."" 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 6600, 2015 WL 3932868 at *3. 
For the reasons discussed above, I disagree with this interpretation of the TCPA."
323,10," The Bureau stated in its statement of jurisdiction that it ""had no choice but to file this interlocutory appeal based on the 
Fourteenth Court of Appeals' decision in Direct Commercial Funding v. Beacon Hill Estates, LLC, 407 S.W.3d 398, 401 (Tex. 
App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.)."" Appellants' Brief at xiii. The Bureau nevertheless stated that ""the Direct Commercial 
decision was incorrectly decided,"" and that ""a trial court has continuing jurisdiction to grant a motion to dismiss [**70]  beyond 
the 30-day period."" Id. "
324,11," Speer v. Presbyterian Children's Home & Serv. Agency, 847 S.W.2d 227, 229 (Tex. 1993) (citing Tex. Const. art. II, § 1). "
337,1," All parties repeatedly argue about the positions taken by the Court in its October 27, 2015 order. The Court, however, is not 
bound by its holdings or findings in that order. See In re Sony Grand Wega KDF-E A10/A20 Series Rear Projection HDTV 
Television Litig., 758 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1098 (S.D. Cal. 2010)."
337,2," Neither BOA Defendants nor FPI Defendants challenge Plaintiff's claims under California insurance law. Cf. Leghorn, 950 F. 
Supp. 2d at 1115 (considering challenges to FPI claims under both the filed rate doctrine and California insurance law). The 
Court thus limits its analysis to the filed rate doctrine. "
338,3," District courts outside of this circuit have also split on the proper approach. Compare, e.g., Singleton v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 
No. 2:12CV216-NBB-SAA, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138374, 2013 WL 5423917, at *2-3 (N.D. Miss. Sept. 26, 2013) (applying the 
filed rate doctrine to bar FPI claims), with Abels v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 678 F. Supp. 2d 1273, 1277 (S.D. Fla. 2009) 
(allowing FPI claims to survive). At least four district courts have followed the Second Circuit's decision in Rothstein. See FPI 
Mot. 10-14; FPI First Not. Supp. Auth. 1; FPI Reply 5 n.9; FPI Second Not. Supp. Auth. 1."
338,4," At least one court has included the Court's prior order among decisions that adopted Rothstein. See Wilson v. EverBank, No. 
14-CIV-22264, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15751, 2016 WL 457011, at *7 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 3, 2016). The prior order, however, 
expressly stated that it ""need not enter [the] debate"" between the California district courts and Rothstein. See 10/27/15 Order at 
30. "
341,5," Plaintiff argues that the ""crux of this case"" is that the wrongful FPI conduct by BOA Defendants improperly altered his loan 
payments, so the cited cases are inapposite. BOA Opp. 24 n.33. Although the Court finds a similar argument persuasive when 
analyzing the accounting claim, see infra Section III.C.xi., the Court does not find it persuasive in the context of this claim, where 
the allegations are that Plaintiff agreed to pay a certain amount to reinstate his loan."
341,6," Although BNYM is included in this claim as part of the BOA Defendants, the Court does not find that this alters its previous 
analysis regarding the lumping together of defendants. "
344,7," The Court therefore does not need to consider Plaintiff's rationales for tolling the statute of limitations. See SAC ¶¶ 120-27; FPI 
Opp. 25 n.33. The Court acknowledges that Gustafson v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP started the clock when the plaintiff 
was informed that FPI policies were placed on his properties, No. SACV 11-915-JST ANX, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 186601, 2012 
WL 7071469, at *8 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2012), but believes that Plaintiff's allegations that he initially believed the FPI policies 
were a mistake makes it inadvisable to determine at this stage that the clock started (i.e. he knew or should have known of the 
wrongdoing) when he first learned that there were FPI policies on his properties in 2010. "
345,8," Plaintiff also states that he lived in the 4424 Lindblade Property when he refinanced the loans in 2007, see SPS Opp. 17 n.24, 
but this allegation does not appear to be in the SAC. HN23[
] All factual allegations that a plaintiff employs to oppose a motion 
to dismiss must be included in the operative pleading. See Schneider v. Cal. Dep't of Corr., 151 F.3d 1194, 1197 (9th Cir. 1998) 
(""The 'new' allegations contained in the inmates' opposition motion, however, are irrelevant for Rule 12(b)(6) purposes. In 
determining the propriety of a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, a court may not look beyond the complaint to a plaintiff's moving papers, 
such as a memorandum in opposition to a defendant's motion to dismiss.""); Epikhin v. Game Insight N. Am., No. 14-CV-04383-
LHK, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 66188, 2015 WL 2412357, at *4 (N.D. Cal. May 20, 2015) (""Simply put, Plaintiffs cannot avoid 
dismissal by alleging new facts in an opposition to a motion to dismiss.""). "
346,9," The Court therefore need not address SPS's arguments that Plaintiff fails to sufficiently allege that he sent SPS the required 
qualified written requests, or that Plaintiff's RESPA claims are barred by the statute of limitations. See SPS Mot. 10-11."
346,10, The Court thus does not need to discuss SPS's argument that Plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege damages. See SPS Mot. 8. 
347,11," The SAC also alleges a claim under California Civil Code § 1785.25(f). See SAC ¶¶ 223, 225. Plaintiff acknowledges in his 
opposition that this claim is preempted by federal law. SPS Opp. 14 n.20. The Court therefore grants the motion to dismiss the 
portion of Count Eleven relating to § 1785.25(f). "
348,12," BOA Defendants also argue that Plaintiff improperly lumps together the conduct of the six grouped defendants. BOA Mot. 9. 
The Court rejects this argument for the reasons stated previously. See [*52]  supra Section III.C.i. "
349,13, The specific breakdown of what can and cannot be amended is listed in the following section. See infra Section IV. 
352,1," See Defendant Martin Auza Sheep Company (""Auza"")'s motion to dismiss and reply (Doc. 83, 106); Defendant Cunningham 
Sheep Company (""Cunningham"")'s motion and reply (Doc. 86, 104); Defendant Western Range Association (""WRA"")'s motion 
and reply (Doc. 87, 107); Defendant Nottingham Land and Livestock, LLLP (""Nottingham"") and Two Bar Sheep Co., LLC (""Two 
Bar"")'s motion and reply (Doc. 88, 108); Defendant Dennis Richins d/b/a Dennis Richins Livestock (""Richins"")'s motion and reply 
(Doc. 89, 109). Defendant Mountain Plains Agricultural Service (""MPAS"")'s motion and reply (Doc. 91, 105). Mr. Richins' briefs 
were filed with three other ranches whom Plaintiffs subsequently dismissed without prejudice: Ball Brothers Sheep Company; 
Child Ranch, LLC; and Estill Ranches, LLC. Doc. 116."
352,2," At oral argument, Richins waived his motions regarding personal jurisdiction and venue under Rule 12(b)(2) and (3). Richins 
did not waive his Rule 12(b)(7) argument for failure to join an indispensable party, but given its conclusion on the Rule 12(b)(6) 
arguments, the court does not reach that issue."
352,3," Plaintiffs filed a combined response (Doc. 96) opposing all of the motions to dismiss. The court permitted Plaintiffs to surreply 
(Doc. 115), and Plaintiffs filed two notices of supplemental authority (Docs. 110, 118)."
352,4," The SAC generally identifies one of the plaintiffs as Leovegildo Vilchez Guerra (SAC caption, ¶¶ 146-148) but elsewhere as 
Leovegildo Vilchez. Id. ¶ 18. For purposes of this ruling, the court assumes that the latter is a typographical error. "
353,5," The Rancher Defendants are Defendants Auza, Cunningham, Nottingham, Two Bar, and Richins."
353,6," Plaintiffs sue Defendant Dennis Richins d/b/a Dennis Richins Livestock as a Rancher Defendant for purposes of antitrust 
claims (SAC ¶ 34, Counts I, II) and as the former executive director, board member, and president of WRA for purposes of their 
civil RICO claim. Id. ¶¶ 112-115, Count IV. "
355,7," Plaintiffs do not allege how many members belong to WRA or MPAS, but the SAC recognizes that there are many more 
member ranches than the five that Plaintiffs are suing. See, e.g., SAC ¶ 78 (alleging WRA job order for 18 member ranches); 
Doc. 73-3 at 24-26; Doc. 73-4 at 8-10; Doc. 73-9 at 6 (WRA job orders and H-2A applications that reflect numerous member 
ranches). Plaintiffs also allege that collectively the Association Defendants ""claim to recruit 'nearly all' of the roughly 2000 to 
2500 shepherds employed in the United States each year."" SAC ¶ 164. "
356,8," With one exception, Defendants do not raise issues regarding the other elements of a § 1 claim — unreasonable restraint of 
trade and antitrust injury. See, e.g., Compliance Mktg., Inc. v. Drugtest, Inc., Case 09-cv-1241-JLK, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
34315, 2010 WL 1416823, at *5-6 (D. Colo. Apr. 7, 2010); 15 U.S.C. § 4; SAC ¶¶ 108-11, 227 241, 255. WRA argues in passing 
that there is no antitrust injury. Doc. 87 at 7. The court need not reach that issue unless it concludes that the claims plausibly 
describe an anticompetitive agreement or combination. See, e.g., Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1082. "
357,9," WRA argues (Doc. 87 at 3) that ""an express, manifested agreement, and thus an agreement involving actual, verbalized 
communication, must be proved in order for a price-fixing conspiracy to be actionable,"" quoting In re High Fructose Corn Syrup 
Antitrust Litig., 295 F. 3d 651, 654 (7th Cir. 2002). Twombly appears to hold that a tacit price-fixing agreement, if plausibly 
alleged, does suffice. 550 U.S. at 553."
357,10," O'Bannon v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 802 F.3d 1049, 1054-55 (9th Cir. 2015) pet'n for cert. filed (U.S. Mar. 17, 2016); 
[cert. denieds 137 S. Ct. 277; 196 L. Ed. 2d 33 (2016)]; Osborn v. Visa, Inc., 797 F.3d 1057, 1067, 418 U.S. App. D.C. 193 
(D.C. Cir. 2015), pet'n for cert. filed (U.S. Jan. 29, 2016). [cert. denied 136 S. Ct. 2543, 195 L. Ed. 2d 867 (2016)]."
357,11," Champagne Metals, 458 F.3d at 1083-84; Beltran, 176 F. Supp. 3d 1066, 2016 WL 1253622, at *4-5; Text Messaging, 630 
F.2d at 628. "
360,12," The same is true of Snyder: it was insufficient to allege that the defendant insurance companies (and others) had conspired 
simply because their insurance policies used the same or similar contract term, and they either belonged to an industry 
association or were associated with it in a RICO enterprise. 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5314, 2016 WL 192270, at *10. "
365,13," Plaintiffs filed with their opposition brief an MPAS email sent apparently only to members in Oregon regarding the same state 
minimum wage increase as WRA's communication. Doc. 96-1. However, ""the sufficiency of a complaint must rest on its contents 
alone,"" Gee v. Pacheco, 627 F.3d 1178, 1186 (10th Cir. 2010), and raising new materials in a response brief is impermissible. 
See, e.g., Erikson v. BP Expl. & Prod. Inc., 567 F. App'x 637, 639 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 441, 190 L. Ed. 2d 329 
(2014), reh'g denied, 135 S. Ct. 1031, 190 L. Ed. 2d 895 (2015). The court also does not consider several factual materials that 
Defendants filed (or cited) that are not subject to exceptions to Rule 12(d). Docs. 87 at 6, n.2; 89; 104-1; and 109. "
366,14," It appears that none of the Plaintiffs in this case were parties in Ruiz. Id. at 1060. The order reflects that the shepherd plaintiffs 
brought claims against WRA under the Fair Labor Standards Act and various state law theories. Id. Except for a quantum meruit 
claim, the court found issues of material fact for trial. Id. at 1078-79. "
367,15," The court takes judicial notice that the DOL announced the new rule on October 16, 2015, and that the new rule (a) replaces 
the 2011 methodology and (b) raises the minimum wage: DOL Employment and Training Administration, Temporary Agricultural 
Employment of H-2A Foreign Workers in the Herding or Production of Livestock on the Range in the United States, 80 Fed. Reg. 
62958-01, 62986 (Oct. 16, 2015) (codified at 20 C.F.R. § 655 Subpart B) (copy filed, Doc. 83-1)."
367,16," Plaintiffs' failure to state an antitrust claim does not leave them without redress under other laws or before the DOL. See, e.g., 
Ruiz and the litigation history noted supra § I.A. that resulted in significant changes to the DOL's applicable rules. "
368,17," See also Black & Decker, 801 F.3d at 430 (""detailed story"" alleging agreement to boycott made at specific meeting by named 
individuals); Evergreen Partnering Group, Inc. v. Pactiv Corp., 720 F.3d 33, 47-48 (1st Cir. 2013) (alleged ""proactive destructive 
conduct ... difficult to explain outside ... of a conspiracy""); Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 336-337 (""detailed allegations of bid 
rigging"" survived Rule 12); Processed Egg, 821 F. Supp. 2d at 730-31 (conduct inconsistent with independent self-interest);

(allegations identified executives involved, specific time frames, regions, and agreements to ""stay out of each others' territories, 
which ... are the subject of ... criminal guilty pleas"")."
368,18," See also Insulate SB, Inc. v. Advanced Finishing Sys., Inc., 797 F.3d 538, 546 (8th Cir. 2015) (the ""complaint repeatedly 
asserts Graco and an unnamed set of distributors generally conspired to restrain trade [and that at least some communicated 
together], but these assertions are not enough.""); Erie County, Ohio v. Morton Salt, Inc., 702 F.3d 860, 870-73 (6th Cir. 2012) 
(allegations were equally consistent with independent conduct); Burtch v. Milberg Factors, Inc., 662 F.3d 212, 228-229 (3d Cir. 
2011) (same); Ins. Brokerage, 618 F.3d at 327-336 (dismissing part of claim); Jacobs v. Tempur-Pedic Int'l, Inc., 626 F.3d 1327,

(""similarities in contractual language, pricing, and equipment design"" were insufficient); Suture Exp., Inc. v. Cardinal Health 200, 
LLC, 963 F. Supp. 2d 1212, 1225 (D. Kan. 2013) (""that a defendant could have chosen a different strategy does not ... infer ... 
that the choice of a strategy similar to that of a fellow competitor is a ... conspiracy"")."
368,19," Because the court recommends dismissal for failure to plausibly allege antitrust conspiracy, the court does not reach 
Defendants' other arguments for dismissal of the antitrust claims. "
369,20," Technically, MPAS framed this issue as a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) issue of particularity in ""the identity of the party 
making the false statements, and the consequences thereof."" However, the SAC's allegations of enterprises as to both WRA 
and MPAS are virtually identical. Compare, SAC ¶¶ 116-121 to ¶¶ 122-127; Count IV to Count V. If Plaintiffs fail to allege a 
person distinct from the enterprise as to MPAs, the court has no need to reach whether Rule 9 requires more particularity. "
370,21," In their response brief, Plaintiffs assert that they ""do not allege a RICO claim where the WRA is the Defendant and the WRA 
and Richins are the enterprise."" Doc. 96 at 34 n.14. This is not, however, plain from Count IV as pled: ""By participating in the 
Richins Enterprise and the WRA Enterprise, which engaged in patterns of racketeering and commission of the underlying 
predicate acts, Defendant Richins and the WRA injured Plaintiffs and the WRA Illegal Deduction Class."" SAC ¶ 265. To the 
extent Plaintiffs sued WRA as the person for the Richins Enterprise, this fails to allege an enterprise distinct from WRA. Yellow 
Bus, 883 F.2d at 141 (""there is no difference between the union as an entity including [the individual defendant] as officer, and 
the union plus [the officer], since the whole is no different than the sum of its parts in this context"") (internal quotation marks 
omitted). "
371,22," The SAC alleges that Richins was the executive director of WRA from 2001 ""until sometime in 2014."" Richins' other alleged 
roles with WRA predate the four year statute of limitation that Plaintiffs appear to recognize applies to the claim. SAC ¶¶ 113, 
133 (alleging conduct in the four years prior to complaint)."
371,23," In their Response, Plaintiffs point out that the Tenth Circuit left open the possibility that ""there are situations where a subsidiary 
and parent relationship, properly alleged, could state a claim for § 1962(c) liability."" Doc. 96 at 34 (citing Brannon, 153 F.3d at 
1149). More accurately, Brannon would ""not exclude the possibility that, as the Emery court recognized,"" ""in order to state a 
viable claim under § 1962(c) against a corporation for conducting the affairs of its parent corporation, a plaintiff must, at the very 
least, allege the parent 'somehow made it easier to commit or conceal the fraud of which the plaintiff complains.'"" Id. at 1147 
(citing Emery v. Am. Gen. Fin., Inc., 134 F.3d 1321, 1324 (7th Cir. 1998)). Plaintiffs do not allege facts of that nature here."
371,24," SAC ¶ 114 refers to Ruiz, 949 F. Supp. 2d at 1069, but the case adds little or nothing to the facts alleged here: ""Western 
Range's executive director, Dennis Richins, testified that Western Range would pay a sheepherder's wages if the member ranch 
did not pay them, or if a gap in the sheepherder's employment with member ranches meant that the sheepherder was not being 
paid by a specific member ranch at a given time."" Id. "
373,25," Plaintiffs have not formally requested leave to amend their complaint a third time. When Plaintiffs do not formally seek leave to 
amend, the court need not provide for amendment upon dismissal. See, e.g., McLain v. Dussart, No. 12-CV-02504-REB-MEH, 
2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24766, 2015 WL 970155, at *1 (D. Colo. Mar. 2, 2015). To obtain leave, Plaintiffs would have to show that 
a third amendment would likely enable them to plausibly allege the federal claims or diversity jurisdiction. Id. Nothing in the 
record indicates that a third amendment would enable Plaintiffs to do either. The court accordingly recommends dismissing 
without leave to amend. "
376,1," Unless otherwise noted, citations to the record refer to the lead docket in these actions, 14-cv-3728. "
379,2," The Court notes, in particular, that plaintiffs have recast many of their conspiracy allegations from the CAC to support their 
monopoly allegations. In doing so, certain of the alleged conduct that was previously attributed to all of the Goldman Sachs, 
JPMorgan and Glencore defendants is now attributed solely or primarily to Glencore Ltd. and Pacorini. Because the Court must 
construe the allegations in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and resolve all inferences in their favor, the Court accepts 
plaintiffs' current allegations as [*18]  true notwithstanding that certain allegations are inconsistent with the CAC. The Court 
notes, in any event, that it faulted plaintiffs' conspiracy allegations in Zinc I in part because the alleged anticompetitive conduct 
appeared to have been engaged in primarily by Glencore Ltd. and Pacorini, and not by the other defendants."
379,3," In Zinc I, the Court provided a comprehensive background on the zinc industry, the operation of the LME, and how physical 
zinc is priced (as alleged by plaintiffs in the CAC). See Zinc I, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1650, 2016 WL 93864, at *4-5. The Court 
assumes familiarity with that explanation and here condenses (and, as necessary, supplements) that discussion."
379,4," The SAC periodically refers to ""LME U.S. Zinc,"" which it defines as ""LME-grade primary zinc for physical delivery in the United 
States."" (SAC ¶ 2.) At other points, the SAC refers to and focuses on ""SHG Zinc."" (SAC ¶ 104.) According to the SAC, these 
terms are interchangeable. (See SAC ¶ 90.) For the sake of consistency, the Court refers to LME U.S. Zinc as SHG zinc. As 
Glencore Ltd. points out, the SAC is at times ambiguous when referring to primary zinc or to zinc generally. (Glencore's Opening 
Mem. at 9 n.2, ECF No. 166.) In contrast, the Court presumes that generic references to ""primary zinc"" or ""zinc"" were not 
intended to mean SHG zinc only but to refer to all zinc."
379,5," Despite the Court's admonishment in Zinc I, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1650, 2016 WL 93864, at *32, *33 n.41, the SAC frequently 
refers generically to ""Glencore"" without identifying the particular entity to which plaintiffs intend to refer (e.g., SAC ¶¶ 1, 2, 26, 56, 
79, 88, 89). As the Court can only presume that these ambiguous references were intentional under the circumstances, the 
Court assumes that, unless absolutely clear in context, when the SAC refers generically to ""Glencore,"" it is referring to 
defendants' ultimate parent, Glencore plc, or other non-defendant [*21]  affiliates, rather than to defendant Glencore Ltd. The 
Court cautions plaintiffs that such generalizations are likely to encounter difficulty at later stages of the case. "
380,6," Plaintiffs allege that more LME zinc is warehoused in New Orleans than at all other locations combined. (SAC ¶¶ 82, 84.)"
380,7," At times, the SAC references the existence—but does not at all explain the significance of—other regional premiums that may 
be used to calculate the price of SHG zinc. (See SAC ¶¶ 92, 104, 105.) The SAC does not identify these other regional 
premiums or the prominence of their use, or explain if they are calculated in a different manner than the MW SHG Premium. The 
parties did not address what, if any, significance the existence of other premiums has on the plausibility of plaintiffs' monopoly 
theory in their briefing or at oral argument. The Court notes, however, that all of the named plaintiffs allege that they purchased 
SHG zinc at prices incorporating the MW SHG Premium. (SAC ¶¶ 30, 37, 44, 51, 58.) Thus, construing all reasonable inferences 
in plaintiffs' favor, the Court finds that plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the MW SHG Premium is incorporated into the price of 
nearly all industrial contracts for the physical delivery of SHG zinc. To the extent that this allegation proves to be incorrect, that 
may raise a serious flaw in plaintiffs' monopolization theory at later stages of this case. "
381,8," Plaintiffs allege that ""Glencore"" sells 100% of the primary zinc produced in the United States by virtue of its exclusive off-take 
agreement with Nyrstar, pursuant to which ""Glencore"" would sell zinc at prices based on LME prices plus market-based annually 
agreed premiums. (SAC ¶¶ 139-41.) "
382,9," Other aspects of the LME zinc warehouse services market, including location and capacity of warehouses, and queue length 
and metal load-out times, are direct components of the supply of SHG zinc. (SAC ¶ 102.) "
383,10," As defendants contended at oral argument, the SAC does not allege that defendants control warrant owners' decision whether 
to cancel their warrants. (Apr. 15, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. at 34:9-14, 46:10-47:8.) Plaintiffs do, nonetheless, allege that defendants 
control load-out queues because cancellations are always far in excess of the minimum amount of metal that must be loaded out 
on a daily basis under LME rules (see SAC ¶ 108; Apr. 15, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. at 66:25-67:11) and, as explained below, that 
defendants therefore have various ways to manipulate load-out queues even without controlling warrant owners' decision 
whether to cancel their warrants."
383,11," Plaintiffs allege that after HKEx completed its purchase of the LME in December 2012, in November 2013 it approved stricter 
load-out rules that required warehouses experiencing delays of 100 days or more to ship out more metal than they take in. (SAC 
¶ 198.) Implementation of such reforms has, however, been delayed by judicial review of the LME's proposal. (SAC ¶ 198.) "
384,12," Plaintiffs also seek to base their Section 2 claims on defendants' securing of what this Court referred to in Zinc I as the ""Queue 
Order Agreement."" Zinc I, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1650, 2016 WL 93864, at *8. Pursuant to that agreement, prominent traders at 
different firms committed to a regular schedule of warrant cancellations at certain agreed upon tonnage amounts. (SAC ¶ 152.) 
According to CW1, the Queue Order Agreement was initiated when Glencore representatives met with several large trading 
companies in the late summer or early fall of 2012 and agreed to a ""synchronized"" and ""highly coordinated"" schedule of zinc 
warrant cancellations at Pacorini's New Orleans warehouses. (SAC ¶ 153.) As part of this, Pacorini created [*40]  a Queue 
Manager spreadsheet to monitor when cancellations were going to occur prior to the warrants being canceled officially through 
the LME. (SAC ¶¶ 157, 159.) The Court does not find the allegations relating to this agreement particularly relevant to the 
Section 2 claims as it sought to rationalize load out, not enhance congestion. The Court nonetheless refers to it here for 
completeness."
384,13," This Court has previously explained the concept of a ""contango"" in its decisions in Aluminum and in Zinc I. Zinc I, 2016 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 1650, 2016 WL 93864, at *9; In re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., No. 13-md-2481 (KBF), 2014 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 121435, 2014 WL 4277510, at *21 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 29, 2014). "
386,14," To state an attempted monopolization claim, a plaintiff must allege plausible facts supporting that the defendant has engaged 
in predatory or anticompetitive conduct, with a specific intent to monopolize a particular and defined market, and a dangerous 
probability of success. Spectrum Sports, 506 U.S. at 456; PepsiCo, 315 F.3d at 105. "
387,15," The Court acknowledges that, as Glencore Ltd. and Pacorini pointed out at [*50]  oral argument (see Apr. 15, 2016 Oral Arg. 
Tr. at 12:6-23, 30:24-31:13, 43:12-44:4), Indiana Federation of Dentists is arguably distinguishable from this case in that the 
product and geographic markets in that case were circumscribed based on the industry and consumer choice. See Indiana Fed'n 
of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 449-52, 460-61. However, several other cases have affirmed that allegations of a relevant market need 
not be as robust where the plaintiff alleges direct evidence of monopoly power, and defendants have not rebutted the logical 
basis for that understanding. "
388,16," Defendants' arguments relating to both Section 2 claims are essentially the same; they largely relyon their arguments 
regarding plaintiffs' actual monopolization claim in seeking dismissal of plaintiffs' attempted monopolization claim. (Glencore's 
Opening Mem. at 16-17; Glencore's Reply Mem. at 8-9, ECF No. 176; Pacorini's Opening Mem. at 11, ECF No. 169; Pacorini's 
Reply Mem. at 56, ECF No. 178.) Because the Court ultimately concludes that plaintiffs' actual monopolization claim passes 
muster at this stage, and defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs' attempted monopolization claim survives if plaintiffs' actual 
monopolization does, the Court analyzes both Section 2 claims together."
388,17," Defendants also argue—throughout their papers—that plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed for failing to cure the particular 
deficiencies that the Court identified in Zinc I in relation to the Court's review of the CAC. (See, e.g., Pacorini's [*55]  Opening 
Mem. at 6-8; Glencore's Opening Mem. at 1-2.) While the Court looks to its analysis in Zinc I as an important reference point, the 
Court does not view this argument as itself a sufficient independent basis to dismiss the SAC, which contains allegations and 
claims organized to tell a more coherent story that were not previously before the Court. Instead, the Court focuses its analysis 
on the independent merits of plaintiffs' current claims. As the Court explained at oral argument, it is the effectiveness of plaintiffs' 
amendments, rather than the volume of changes, that is significant in terms of whether plaintiffs are able to defeat defendants' 
motions. (Apr. 15, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. at 7:6-9.) When reviewing a complaint for sufficiency of the allegations, the Court must 
review the complaint ""as a whole in context."" Cohen v. S.A.C. Trading Corp., 711 F.3d 353, 360 (2d Cir. 2013). "
389,18," At oral argument, Glencore Ltd. argued that a relevant inquiry is whether plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that defendants 
excluded competition in the sale of SHG zinc, not whether the MW SHG Premium was elevated. (Apr. 15, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. at 
28:18-22.) To the extent this argument suggests that allegations of exclusionary behavior are required to state [*57]  a claim, 
that premise is incorrect. Monopoly power may be alleged either as control of price or the exclusion of competition. E.g., 
PepsiCo, 315 F.3d at 107; Xerox Corp. v. Media Scis., Inc., 660 F. Supp. 2d 535, 543 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). Plaintiffs' direct evidence 
therefore need not consist of the exclusion of competition. With that said, economic principles support an argument that in the 
absence of exclusionary behavior, competition will ultimately drive price to non-monopolistic levels. That issue is, however, for a 
later stage."
389,19," To the extent that defendants equate their alleged ability to influence the price of SHG zinc as simply the ability to ""bid up a 
price by just paying more"" (Apr. 15, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. at 25:7), the Court does not find the analogy immediately appealing. 
Plaintiffs do not allege that defendants have increased [*60]  the price by paying more for SHG zinc in some open market 
setting; rather, plaintiffs allege that defendants exercise control over one of the price components that all purchasers of SHG "
390,," zinc must pay. Here, plaintiffs essentially allege there was no need to ""bid"" up the price asdefendants had the unilateral power to 
force up the price. The Court acknowledges that plaintiffs' theory does not necessarily represent the traditional monopoly power 
case, but that does not mean that it is unavailable under Section 2."
390,20," For instance, plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that defendants were responsible for canceling large volumes of LME 
warrants that triggered lengthy load-out queues. (Glencore's Reply Mem. at 4 (citing Zinc I, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1650, 2016 
WL 93864, at *29 n.39).) If other traders were responsible for canceling most of the warrants in defendants' warehouses, that at 
least decreases the extent to which defendants are able to control the length of load-out queues. "
391,21," The closest that plaintiffs come to pleading Glencore Ltd.'s market share is the allegation that it has an exclusive offtake [*67]  
agreement with Nyrstar, the only U.S.-based zinc producer. (SAC ¶¶ 100, 138-43.) That fact says little about Glencore Ltd.'s 
market share in the LME U.S. Zinc Market, however, given plaintiffs' allegation that zinc production occurs on a global basis and 
is shipped throughout the world, whereas U.S.-produced zinc encompasses just a fraction of the SHG zinc that is consumed in 
the United States. (SAC ¶¶ 101, 142.) Similarly, plaintiffs' allegations as to the large percentage of SHG zinc held in defendants' 
LME warehouses in comparison to all LME zinc warehouse stocks indicate little about defendants' percentage share of control of 
SHG zinc sold in the United States (SAC ¶¶ 124-36, 211), in light of plaintiffs' allegation that LME-registered warehouses are but 
one of many sources of SHG zinc for a consumer seeking delivery in the United States (SAC ¶ 98). Defendants' alleged 
hoarding of zinc in their LME-registered warehouses does not render these allegations more relevant, nor does Glencore Ltd.'s 
trading activity or alleged corralling of other traders to participate in the Queue Order Agreement show its monopoly power. 
Finally, the SAC contains no allegations plausibly showing the [*68]  existence of significant barriers of entry blocking 
competitors from selling SHG zinc in the United States; allegations as to significant barriers to entry into or expansion of primary 
zinc production or the extent of Glencore plc's control over that production (e.g., SAC ¶¶ 64, 97, 100) are inapposite to 
defendants' market share of the market for LME U.S. Zinc. At oral argument, plaintiffs conceded that Glencore plc's global 
mining operations are not a necessary component of defendants' alleged monopoly. (Apr. 15, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. at 69:8-11.) "
392,22," Because the MW SHG Premium is the only zinc premium published by Platts that is referenced in the SAC, the Court infers 
that plaintiffs mean to refer to the MW SHG Premium when they say ""Platts zinc premium."""
392,23," In another instance of ambiguity, the SAC states only that ""primary zinc"" is price inelastic (SAC ¶ 99), which says nothing 
about whether SHG zinc is also price inelastic. "
395,24," This ruling is fully consistent with the Court's determination in Zinc I that Glencore [*84]  Ltd. was independently entitled to 
dismissal of the monopolization claim against it on the ground that the CAC did not allege any facts showing that Glencore Ltd. 
was ""able to control the price for LME storage at any warehouses."" Zinc I, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1650, 2016 WL 93864, at *29. 
Whereas the CAC did not plausibly allege that Glencore Ltd. itself engaged in any conduct that constituted monopoly 
maintenance in the market for LME zinc warehouse services, the SAC plausibly alleges that Pacorini has itself directly 
participated in conduct allowing for the control of the price of SHG zinc. "
397,25," Additionally, even though the Court has determined that plaintiffs have—based on their allegations of direct evidence of 
monopoly power—met the threshold necessary to plead a plausible relevant market for purposes of their Section 2 claims, the 
Court has serious doubts whether plaintiffs' market allegations are robust enough to state a Section 7 claim, for which the 
relevant market is a ""necessary predicate."" United States v. Marine Bancorporation, Inc., 418 U.S. 602, 618, 94 S. Ct. 2856, 41

401,3," The defendants withdrew the following defenses: failure to state a claim, ""Defendants do not owe Plaintiffs any duties,"" and 
""Plaintiffs have not been harmed."" Id."
401,4," Defendants declined to seek jury instructions for ""Corporate Shield Doctrine,"" ""Alter Ego/Piercing the Corporate Veil,"" ""Failure 
to Properly Plead Fraud,"" ""Failure to Plead Infringement Claims with Particularity,"" ""Prior Material Breach,"" and ""Preemption."" Id. 
at 2, 3, 15, 16."
401,5," In their briefing on this motion, the plaintiffs seemingly interpret the July 2 Order as affecting the ""evidence"" that may be offered 
at trial. E.g., P. Mem. at 7 (""Defendants have set forth and are bound by their Factual Contentions; pursuant to the Court's 
instruction, they cannot offer further evidence.""). While the Order limits defendants to the factual allegations supporting the 
defense, it does not address the nature of the evidence that could be used to support those allegations. "
402,6, The defense reads in full as follows: 
403,," Plaintiffs' claims are barred, in full or in part, because all the materials that were imported by or for the account of 
Defendants were lawfully made under Title 17 pursuant to a license agreement(s) with each applicable Plaintiff; said 
license(s) authorized the reproduction of the applicable Plaintiff's copyrighted material and the use of the applicable 
Plaintiff's trademarks; and Defendants were entitled to import and re-sell the subject textbooks without the copyright 
owner's permission because the copyright owner's exclusive distribution rights (17 USC § 106(3)) were exhausted by virtue 
of the ""First Sale Doctrine,"" which permits the owner of a particular copy of a copyrighted work to sell or otherwise dispose 
of the possession of that copy. [*14] Answer ¶ 111."
403,7," As plaintiffs note, P. Repl. Mem. at 6, the defendants' citation to to SAC ¶¶ 103-09, see [*15]  D. Opp. at 7, 18, for the 
proposition that there are such claims is irrelevant because these paragraphs relate to the plaintiffs' claim for conspiracy to 
commit fraud, not their claims for copyright infringement. "
406,8," Defendants' brief, in the first line of the second paragraph, states that MBS returned these counterfeit works to 
""Defendants."" [*24]  D. Opp. at 14. We assume that this is a typographical error and that defendants meant ""Plaintiffs."" If 
defendants actually meant ""Defendants,"" it would provide no evidence that plaintiffs had knowledge of any infringement. "
407,9," While it is not necessary to reach the issue, there is virtually no evidence supporting a statute of limitations [*27]  defense as to 
Titles 89 and 54. MBS surrendered Title 89 to the plaintiffs in May 2013, less than three years prior to the filing of the SAC. 
Roadmap Entry 89. As for Title 54, the defendants have not pointed to any evidence indicating when MBS surrendered a copy of 
this title."
407,10," While it could hardly cure the defendants' failure to cite evidence to support this defense, we note that the cases they cite, D. 
Opp. at 16-17, are not as broad as defendants assert. In Weber v. Geffen Records, 63 F. Supp. 2d 458 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), the 
court expressly stated that it was ""not holding that awareness of some number of violations necessarily yields constructive 
knowledge of all other violations by the same parties."" Id. at 465. Rather, the court faulted plaintiff for his failure to read a public 
document that reflected infringement or to ""take even a cursory look at the new, widely released album from a musical group that 
very recently had repeatedly infringed his musical compositions."" Id. at 466. In Fahmy v. Jay-Z, 835 F. Supp. 2d 783 (C.D. Cal. 
2011), the plaintiff alleged that a single copyright had been infringed multiple times by the same defendants. See id. at 790. 
Fahmy found that the plaintiff was under a duty to investigate whether other products put out by the same defendant ""contained 
the same infringement."" Id. (citation omitted). Defendants have marshaled no evidence that plaintiffs failed in this duty. Likewise, 
Kepner-Tregoe, Inc. v. Exec. Dev., Inc., 79 F. Supp. 2d 474 (D.N.J. 1999), aff'd, 276 F.3d 577 (3d Cir. 2001), ""place[d] a duty . . . 
to monitor [defendant's] [*30]  products"" on the plaintiff. Id. at 488. The letter the plaintiffs sent to the defendants, see Letter from 
Matthew J. Oppenheim to Neil Mooney, Esq., dated Aug. 30, 2011, appended as Ex. 6 to Miller Decl., shows that the plaintiffs 
were monitoring the defendants after the 2008 Settlement Agreement. Defendants have not explained how ""act[ing] as if they 
did not care what happened to"" individual copies of counterfeit books, Smyres Decl. ¶ 16, constitutes a breach of this duty. "
408,11," Defendants mistakenly refer to this paragraph as ""¶ 106."""
408,12," Defendants also cite to a copy of an unexecuted settlement agreement that would have resolved the instant litigation. See D. 
Opp. at 18 (citing Settlement Agreement, appended as Ex. 9 to Miller Decl.). Defendants never explain the circumstances of the 
creation of this document, however, and thus it too carries no evidentiary weight. "
409,13," The two cases cited by the defendant, D. Opp. at 19, qad. Inc. v. ALN Assocs., 770 F. Supp. 1261, 1270 (N.D. Ill. 1991), and 
Alcatel USA, Inc. v. DGI Techs., Inc., 166 F.3d 772, 793 (5th Cir. 1999), are [*35]  irrelevant. Both involve plaintiffs who tried to 
extend an existing copyright over new material, not plaintiffs who tried to limit sales of copyrighted material. "
410,14," The defendants incorrectly state that the ""Settlement Agreement did not define . . . the 'Effective Date.'"" D. Opp. at 22. In fact, 
the first sentence of the Settlement Agreement reads as follows: ""This settlement agreement . . . is made this 11th day of July 
2008 (the 'Effective Date') . . . ."" Settlement Agreement at 1; see also D.R.56.1 ¶ 2. "
414,1," BCBSA and HCSC have also filed a motion to stay discovery pending a ruling on their motions to dismiss. Dkt. # 90. The 
motion to stay discovery (Dkt. [*3]  # 90) is moot in light of this Opinion and Order ruling on the motions to dismiss."
414,2," Plaintiff refers to HCSC and BCBSA collectively as ""Blue Cross Blue Shield,"" but the complaint clearly alleges that they are 
separate entities and there are no allegations concerning piercing the corporate veil or disregarding the corporate entity of 
BCBSA under any theory. HCSC and BCBSA raise separate arguments in their motions to dismiss and they are proceeding as 
separate and independent parties, and the Court will refer to HCSC and BCBSA as separate entities in this Opinion and Order. 
The complaint is clear that HCSC is the Blue Cross Blue Shield entity operating in Oklahoma and there are no allegations of 
direct dealings between BCBSA and Bristow Healthcare, [*5]  and the Court will refer to HCSC as the party interacting with 
Bristow Healthcare during the contractual negotiations. "
415,3," In its response to defendants' motion to dismiss, plaintiff refers to Kelly as senior vice president of BCBSA. See Dkt. # 76, at 7. "
416,4," Plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed without prejudice its claims against Hillcrest Healthcare System, Inc. Dkt. # 74."
416,5," The Oklahoma Antitrust Reform Act expressly states that the ""provisions of this act shall be interpreted in a manner consistent 
with Federal Antitrust Law, 15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. and the case law applicable thereto."" Okla. Stat. tit. 79, § 212. Therefore, it is 
unnecessary to engage in a separate analysis for plaintiff's state and federal antitrust claims. See Cohlmia v. Ardent Health 
Services, LLC, 448 F. Supp. 2d 1253, 1262 (N.D. Okla. 2006). "
417,6, Plaintiff has filed notice (Dkt. # 77) that it is withdrawing its argument that BCBSA's motion to dismiss was untimely. 
419,7," It is also apparent that Bristow Healthcare was dissatisfied with the blended rate in the new agreement and that it would have 
preferred if HCSC had simply extended the terms of the existing agreement to Cimarron. See Dkt. # 2, at 12. "
420,8," This finding also results in the dismissal of plaintiff's state law antitrust claim under Okla. Stat. tit. 79, § 203(A) (count two) as to 
HCSC. "
421,9," Plaintiff cites Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985), and 
argues that the refusal to deal with a party can sometimes give rise to liability under a monopolization theory if the party refusing 
to contract does so with the intention of creating or furthering a monopoly. Dkt. # 75, at 26-27. The Tenth Circuit has 
characterized Aspen Skiing as a limited exception to the general rule of business independence to deal or not deal with certain 
parties, and a necessary condition for liability under Aspen Skiing is that the monopolist and rival have a ""preexisting and 
presumably profitable course of dealing."" Novell, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 731 F.3d 1064, 1075 (10th Cir. 2013). CORE and 
HCSC did not have prior business relations and they are not in the position of monopolist and rival, and Aspen Skiing has no 
applicability to this case. "
422,10," Plaintiff has alleged that patients cannot currently be referred to BMC for surgery due to remodeling of the surgical facilities at 
BMC, but this was a voluntary decision by plaintiff and plaintiff has not alleged that defendant had a contractual obligation to 
allow plaintiff to refer patients to CORE to accommodate plaintiff's decision to remodel its facilities. See Dkt. # 2, at 17. In other 
words, it was not improper or unjustified for HCSC to deny plaintiff's request to refer surgical patients to CORE on an in-network 
basis due to plaintiff's voluntary decision to close the surgical facilities at BMC for remodeling. "
424,1," In their Supplemental Request For Judicial Notice [*3]  filed Feb.2, 2016, Plaintiffs Vaughan have submitted, and tabbed as 
Exhibit 3, a Copy of a Grant Deed recorded 8-27-08 showing St. Joseph Design, Inc., a California Corporation as the owner of 
the El Granada property. As an owner of the property, St. Joseph Design, Inc. was not required to have a contractor's license to 
hire a licensed contractor to build a house. See People v. Moss (LA Super. Ct, App. Dept. 1939) 33 Cal. App. 2d Supp. 763, 87 
P.2d 932."

Grant Deed referenced in the foregoing Footnote 1, where the Kuldas executed the Grant Deed before a notary public as 
corporate officers of St. Joseph Design, Inc., as owner of the property. "
425,3," Given the particular pleading, including the related Exhibits, of this 14th Cause of Action, the Court may so interpret and 
construe the agreement, on Demurrer, as a matter of law. See, e.g., Careau v. Security Pacific Business Credit, Inc. (2nd Dist. 
1990) 222 Cal. App.3d 1371, at 1403, 272 Cal. Rptr. 387. "
428,1," For ease of reference, the District of Columbia is referred to as a ""state"" herein. "
431,2," With respect to Plaintiffs' Sherman Act § 1 claim, the Court determined that only the first three AGC factors apply, as the fourth 
and fifth factors address damages, which are not available under § 1. See Prior Order at 27. "
433,3," The relevant statutes of limitations are set forth in Exhibit A to Defendants' motion to dismiss. See Defs.' Mot. Exh. A, ECF 167-
1. "
442,1," SiteLink moved to dismiss the defamation counterclaim in its Motion. After the Motion was filed, Red Nova amended its 
defamation counterclaim to add more-specific factual allegations. SiteLink has withdrawn its Motion as to that claim. Because 
the [**4]  amendment modified only the defamation claim, the Court allowed the parties to proceed with briefing and oral 
argument on the Motion, even though the filing of an amended pleading ordinarily would moot an earlier-filed motion to dismiss 
that pleading. "
443,2," SiteLink refers to its management software as business-management software, or BMS, rather than FMS. For purposes of this 
Order & Opinion, the labels ""FMS"" and ""BMS"" refer to the same type of software. "
444,3," Red [**9]  Nova's counterclaims address these licenses specifically, and the licenses' provisions are an integral basis for Red 
Nova's claims. It is therefore appropriate for the Court to consider the licenses when ruling on the Motion. See Oberlin Capital, 
L.P. v. Slavin, 147 N.C. App. 52, 60-61, 554 S.E.2d 840, 847 (2001). The licenses are attached as exhibits A-C to SiteLink's 
original complaint. "
517,1," At oral argument, Defendants' counsel stated: ""... I would submit, Your Honor, that the reason there isn't a lot of precedent is I 
don't believe anyone has ever tried to take a case of fraud on the FDA and package it as an antitrust case."" (#45, Transcript of 
Motion Hearing, March 31, 2016, at 26:13-26:17.) Plaintiffs' counsel admitted that this type of case ""hasn't been brought before, 
but these facts are pretty rare... The FDA hasn't had to come down on a manufacturer like this ever before... with respect to 
good manufacturing practices... the kind of misconduct that would happen here hasn't happened before."" (#45 at 42:10-42:18.) "

intruding into the FDA's decision-making process or burdening the agency. "
533,14," Plaintiffs acknowledge that they lack access to the relevant information at this stage of the case. ""It is unknown at this time the 
extent to which, if at all, Ranbaxy's wrongfully acquired tentative approval for its generic Valcyte ANDA played into the 
agreement to delay entry from August of 2010 to March of 2013. It is also unknown what impact a forfeiture of Ranbaxy's first-to-
file exclusivity would have had on the efforts of other generic ANDA filers seeking to bring generic Valcyte to market."" (#1 ¶216.) 
36"
533,15," Defendants note that ""plaintiffs do not (and cannot) allege that any other generic had tentative approval for generic Valcyte as 
of the start of the alleged damages period, when plaintiffs claim generic entry would have occurred."" (#22 at 32.) Assuming 
arguendo that this is true, it does not mean that Plaintiffs cannot prove that some other generic manufacturer obtained TA and 
would therefore have been eligible to launch before the end of the alleged damages period. "
534,16," Although Defendants assert that the FDA did not find fraud for generic Valcyte either, and rescinded TA merely because of a 
mistake, Plaintiffs are entitled to an inference in their favor on this factual question. Cooperman v. Individual, Inc., 171 F.3d 43, 
46 (1st Cir. 1999) (HN30[
] on a motion to dismiss, court must ""accept as true all well-pleaded allegations and give plaintiffs the 
benefit of all reasonable inferences."") Regardless, under the analysis that follows, Count I should be allowed to proceed even 
absent the FDA's conclusive decision of fraud. "
539,17," The complaint contains other statements of Beardsley that do not appear to be false or improper. (See, e.g., #1 ¶118 (""[On a 
conference call with the FDA on April 5, 2007] Beardsley acknowledge[d] that Ranbaxy had not yet addressed all of the 
concerns raised in the 2006 warning letter""); #1 ¶145 (""Beardsley informed the FDA that Ranbaxy needed ""to think through the 
implications for the criminal case of providing the audits""); #1 ¶182b (""as Beardsley would admit the following year, Ranbaxy had 
not addressed all issues described in the Warning Letter"").) "
540,18," The parties are advised that any party who objects to this Report and Recommendation must file specific written objections 
with the Clerk of this Court within 14 days of the party's receipt of this Report and Recommendation. The written objections must 
specifically identify the portion of the recommendations to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The parties 
are further advised that the United States Court of Appeals for this Circuit has repeatedly indicated that failure to comply with 
Rule 72(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., shall preclude further appellate review. See Keating v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 848 
F.2d 271 (1st Cir. 1988); United States v. Emiliano Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir. 1986); Scott v. Schweiker, 702 F.2d 13,

543,1," As Defendants assert, ""[t]he Department of Public Health is an arm of the State charged with regulating various aspects of 
public health. The Commissioner is the head of the department and Adrienne Anderson is a health program associate in the 
investigations unit."" Doc. 28-1, at 9 n.9."
543,2," Plaintiff alleges, for example, that ""Defendant Adrienne Anderson, acting under color of law, threatened to take action against 
Plaintiff for practicing medicine"" and ""displayed a complete disregard for the registered trademark Doctor of Ňedicine®."" Doc. 1, 
at ¶ 7."
543,3," Plaintiff [*3]  specifically points to the related penalty provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. § 20-14, which provide that ""[a]ny person 
who violates any provision of section 20-9 shall be guilty of a class D felony."" Conviction of a class D felony may result in a term 
of imprisonment ""not more than five years,"" Conn. Gen. Stat. § 53a-35a(8), or a fine in ""an amount not to exceed five thousand 
dollars,"" Conn. Gen. Stat. § 53a-41. See Doc. 1, ¶ 6 (alleging that ""[t]he threat of prosecution is real and immediate"" and may 
make Plaintiff ""subject to criminal sanctions"")."
543,4," According to Plaintiff, this trademark was registered on March 30, 2010, and amended on June 25, 2013. Doc. 1, at ¶ 2. In her 
Complaint, Plaintiff states: ""The trademark Doctor of Ňedicine® identified under TESS at U.S. Serial Number 76699108 lists 
the [*4]  certification statement for this particular trademark as follows: 'The certification mark as used by authorized persons is 
intended to certify that an individual has met the requirements of the American Ňedicine Licensing Board, Inc., and is licensed to 
provide services as a Doctor of Ňedicine.®'"" Id. (quoting Ex. 1, ""Certificate of Registration"")."
543,5," In her brief in opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff explains that ""[t]he diacritic symbol on the mark Doctor of 
Ňedicine® has made it a distinctive, famous, and unique chef-d'oeuvre."" Doc. 36, at 8. The Court is puzzled by the description of 
the word ""Ňedicine"" as a ""chef-d'oeuvre,"" a term which is generally defined as a masterpiece in art or literature. See, e.g., 
http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chef%20d'oeuvre 
; http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chef-d'%C5%93uvre . "
544,6," Consequently, in so arguing, Defendants suggest the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction [*6]  over these claims."
544,7," In fact, according to Plaintiff, the Department of Health intends to issue [to her] a cease and desist order that would require 
[her] to cease and desist using [her] United States Certification Mark"" to practice Ňedicine. Doc. 39, at 4."
544,8," Conn. Gen. Stat. § 19a-11 provides, in relevant part: Any board or commission listed in subsection (b) of section 19a-14 may, in its discretion, issue an appropriate order to any 
person found to be violating an applicable statute or regulation, providing for the immediate discontinuance of the violation. 
. . .The court may grant such relief by injunction or otherwise, including temporary relief, as it deems equitable and may 
make and enter a [*8]  decree enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside, in whole or in part, any 
order of the board or commission. "
545,9," The American Ňedicine Licensing Board, Inc., is a Connecticut corporation registered with the Connecticut Secretary of State. 
See Doc. 1, Ex. 1. ""Beverly Betancur"" is the named president of the corporation, which was registered on July 12, 2004; and the 
official business address is ""29 Orchard St. #2, Stamford, CT."" The currently designated Agent for the business is ""Beverly P. 
Jackson,"" at 19 Silk St., Norwalk, CT."" See also http://www.concord-sots.ct.gov/CONCORD ."
545,10," A certification mark is not a typical trademark or service mark. Rather, such a mark is owned by one person but may be used 
by others in connection with goods or services, which are thus certified as to quality and origin. 3 McCarthy on Trademarks and 
Unfair Competition § 19:91 (4th ed.). Specifically, a certification mark is designed to ""certif[y] that the goods or services tested 
meet certain standards or conditions."" Id. Therefore, ""[o]ne who sees such a certification mark on a product or in connection with 
a service is entitled to assume that the product or service in fact meets whatever standards of safety or quality have been set up 
and advertised by the certifier."" Id."
545,11," In addition, Plaintiff created a website for this school at http://nedicine.net ."
545,12," The letter, written by Adrienne Anderson, was dated September 25, 2015 and addressed to Allen L. Williams, III, counsel for 
Jackson, with respect to the Department's investigation. Because the letter was incorporated by reference into Plaintiff's 
Complaint, the Court may consider its contents in making [*12]  this ruling. See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., 282 F.3d 147, 
152 (2d Cir. 2002) (for purposes of Rule 12(b)(6) motion, ""the complaint is deemed to include any written instrument attached to 
it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by reference""). "
546,13," In addition, Jackson alleges that ""[t]here have been other questionable arrests of physicians that have been charged with the 
unlicensed practice of medicine, with full knowledge that said Doctors were licensed under federal authority, to practice as a 
Doctor of Ňedicine®."" Doc. 1, ¶ 18."
546,14," The individual defendants in Betancur's action included: Timothy M. Cerio, the General Counsel for the Florida Department of 
Health; Dr. Rony Francois, the Secretary for the Florida Department of Health; William N. Meggs, the State Attorney for the State 
of Florida; and Dr. Ana M. Viamonte Ros, Secretary of the Department of Health. Betancur v. Florida, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
15412, 2008 WL 506305, at *1. "
547,15," It would appear that the ""Naturopathic National Council"" was replaced by the ""American Ňedicine Licensing Board"" in that the 
former is now listed as ""inactive,"" whereas the latter is ""active"" and is the cross-referenced entity for the former in the records of 
the Connecticut Secretary of State. See http://www.concord-sots.ct.gov/CONCORD (accessed June 20, 2016) (showing 
""Business ID"" for ""American Nedicine Licensing Board, Inc."" with ""Old Name"" of ""Naturopathic National Council, Inc."")."
547,16," Instead, Plaintiff now calls herself ""Doctor of Ňedicine, N.D."" "
548,17," In her brief in opposition to Defendants' motion to dismiss, Plaintiff argues that ""Defendants are falsely claiming that Plaintiff is 
practicing mainstream medicine instead of alternative medicine in an attempt to take illegitimate control of the mark Doctor of 
Ñedicine.®"" Doc. 36, at 5. She attempts to distinguish ""Ñedicine"" as the practice of ""alternative medicine,"" as opposed to 
""conventional medicine."" Id. She fails to address, however, that the State is entitled to define medicine for the purpose of 
protecting the public safety."
548,18," 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act states, in relevant part: (1) Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or any container for goods, uses in commerce any 
word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination [*22]  thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or 
misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which — "

such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or 
commercial activities by another person, . . . shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act."
549,19," The Sherman Antitrust Act provides: Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, [*23]  in restraint of trade or commerce among 
the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."
549,15, U.S.C. § 1.
549,20," As Defendants noted, ""medicine is not a trademark,"" but rather defined in Connecticut as the practice of ""diagnosing, 
operating or prescribing for any injury, deformity, ailment or disease, actual or imaginary, of another person,"" Conn. Gen. Stat. § 
20-9. Doc. 28-1, at 9 n. 8. Moreover, ""none of the Defendants are medical practitioners actively involved in the practice of 
medicine."" Id. n.9."

immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due 
process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const. amend. XIV."
550,23," It is unclear from Plaintiff's Complaint which Fourteenth Amendment right she seeks to redress (e.g., due process, a liberty 
interest, equal protection). However, at one point she refers to an ""inalienable"" right of a citizen as the ""liberty of contract."" Doc. 
1, ¶ 28. "
551,24," The amendment to Rule 4(m), Fed. R. Civ. P., shortening ""the presumptive period for serving a defendant from 120 days to 90 
days"" became effective on December 1, 2015. See ""Committee Notes to Rule 4 - 2015 Amendment."" Therefore, when Plaintiff 
attempted service in May of 2015, the former 120-day period of Rule 4(m) was in effect. "

S. Ct. 441, 52 L. Ed. 714 (1908), holding that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar suits for prospective relief against state

Carothers, 192 F.3d 52, 57 n.3 (2d Cir. 1999). "

555,30," As the United States [*40]  Supreme Court declared in Seminole Tribe, ""For over a century we have reaffirmed that federal 
jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting States 'was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial 
power of the United States.'"" 517 U.S. at 54 (quoting Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 15, 10 S. Ct. 504, 33 L. Ed. 842 (1890))."

555,33," The United States Supreme Court has specified that it has ""held that through the Fourteenth Amendment, federal power 
extended to intrude upon the province of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed 
Congress to abrogate the immunity from suit guaranteed by that Amendment."" Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 59, 116 
S. Ct. 1114, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996). "
556,34," The United States Supreme Court concluded in Parker: We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state 
or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature."
556,317, U.S. at 350-51.
556,35, Connecticut has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity in this action. [*43] 
558,36," ""The plausibility standard is not akin to a 'probability requirement,' but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant 
has acted unlawfully."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Thus, ""[w]here a complaint pleads facts that are 'merely consistent with' a 
defendant's liability, it 'stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of 'entitlement to relief.'"" Id. (quoting Twombly, 
550 U.S. at 557). "
559,37," Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that a complaint ""contain . . . a short and plain statement of the claim 
showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). The pleading standard set forth in Rule 8 ""does not require 
'detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation."" Iqbal, 
556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Rule 8 simply ""does not unlock the doors of discovery for a plaintiff armed 
with nothing more than conclusions."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-79. "
560,38," The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution states, in pertinent part: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor 
shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its 
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const. amend. XIV. "
561,39," As the United States Supreme Court explained in Watson: It is too well settled to require discussion at this day that the police power of the states extends to the regulation of certain 
trades and callings, particularly those which closely concern the public health. There is perhaps no profession [*56]  more 
properly open to such regulation than that which embraces the practitioners of medicine. Dealing, as its followers do, with 
the lives and health of the people, and requiring for its successful practice general education and technical skill, as well as 
good character, it is obviously one of those vocations where the power of the state may be exerted to see that only properly 
qualified persons shall undertake its responsible and difficult duties. To this end many of the states of the Union have 
enacted statutes which require the practitioner of medicine to submit to an examination by a competent board of physicians 
and surgeons, and to receive duly authenticated certificates showing that they are deemed to possess the necessary 
qualifications of learning, skill, and character essential to their calling. Watson v. State of Maryland, 218 U.S. 173, 176, 30 S. Ct. 644, 54 L. Ed. 987 (1910). "
562,40," Because amendment of Plaintiff's claims would still be subject to dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), such amendment 
would be futile. "
583,1," In full, 18 U.S.C. §1962 provides: HN4[
] LEdHN[4][
] [4] “(a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income derived, directly or indirectly, 
from a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has participated as a 
principal [****11]  within the meaning of section 2, title 18, United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part of 
such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any 
enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce. A purchase of securities on the 
open market for purposes of investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in the control of the issuer, or of 
assisting another to do so, shall not be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held by the purchaser, the 
members of his immediate family, and his or their accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of an 
unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, 
and do not confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more directors of the issuer. “(b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to 
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities [****12]  
of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce. “(c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s affairs 
through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt. “(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.” The attentive reader will notice that these prohibitions concern not only patterns of racketeering activity but also the collection of 
unlawful debt. As is typical in our RICO cases, we have no occasion here to address this aspect of the statute."
583,2," In full, §1964(c) provides: HN6[
] LEdHN[6][
] [6] “Any person injured in his business or property by reason [****13]  of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains 
and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee, except that no person may rely upon any conduct that would have 
been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities to establish a violation of section 1962. The exception contained in 
the preceding sentence does not apply to an action against any person that is criminally convicted in connection with the fraud, 
in which case the statute of limitations shall start to run on the date on which the conviction becomes final.” "
584,3, The complaint also alleges [****16]  that RJR committed a variety of state-law torts. Those claims are not before us.
584,4," At an earlier stage of respondents’ litigation against RJR, the Second Circuit “held that the revenue rule barred the foreign 
sovereigns’ civil claims for recovery of lost tax revenue and law enforcement costs.” European Community v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., 
424 F. 3d 175, 178 (2005) (Sotomayor, J.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1092 (2006), 126 S. Ct. 1045, 163 L. Ed. 2d 858. It is unclear 
why respondents subsequently included these alleged injuries in their present complaint; they do not ask us to disturb or 
distinguish the Second Circuit’s holding that such injuries are not cognizable. We express no opinion on the matter. Cf. 
Pasquantino v. United States, 544 U.S. 349, 355, n. 1, 125 S. Ct. 1766, 161 L. Ed. 2d 619 (2005). "
586,5," Because a finding of extraterritoriality at step one will obviate step two’s “focus” inquiry, it will usually be preferable for courts to 
proceed in the sequence that we have set forth. But we do not [****23]  mean to preclude courts from starting at step two in 
appropriate cases. Cf. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236-243, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2009). "
587,6," The foreign killings would, of course, still have to satisfy the relatedness and continuity requirements of RICO’s pattern 
element. See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 109 S. Ct. 2893, 106 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1989). "
589,7," As to §§1962(a) and (d), see supra, at 13 - 14, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 495-496. "
590,8," We stress that we are addressing only the extraterritoriality question. We have not been asked to decide, and therefore do not 
decide, whether the complaint satisfies any other requirements of RICO, or whether the complaint in fact makes out violations of 
the relevant predicate statutes."
590,9," See Brief for Governments of Federal Republic of Germany et al. as Amici Curiae, O. T. 2003, No. 03-724, p. 11 (identifying 
“controversial features of the U.S. legal system,” including treble damages, extensive discovery, jury trials, class actions, 
contingency fees, and punitive damages); id., at 15 (“Private plaintiffs rarely exercise the type of self-restraint or demonstrate the "
591,," requisite sensitivity [****38]  to the concerns of foreign governments that mark actions brought by the United States 
government”); Brief for United Kingdom et al. as Amici Curiae, O. T. 2003, No. 03-724, p. 13 (“No other country has adopted the 
United States’ unique ‘bounty hunter’ approach that permits a private plaintiff to ‘recover threefold the damages by him 
sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.’ . . . Expanding the jurisdiction of this generous United 
States private claim system could skew enforcement and increase international business risks. It makes United States courts the 
forum of choice without regard to whose laws are applied, where the injuries occurred or even if there is any connection to the 
court except the ability to get in personam jurisdiction over the defendants”); see also Brief for Government of Canada as 
Amicus Curiae, O. T. 2003, No. 03-724, p. 14 (“[T]he attractiveness of the [U. S.] treble damages remedy would supersede the 
national policy decision by Canada that civil recovery by Canadian citizens for injuries resulting from anti-competitive behavior in 
Canada should be limited to actual damages”). Empagran concerned not the presumption against extraterritoriality [****39]  per 
se, but the related rule that we construe statutes to avoid unreasonable interference with other nations’ sovereign authority 
where possible. See F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Empagran S. A., 542 U.S. 155, 164, 124 S. Ct. 2359, 159 L. Ed. 2d 226

J., dissenting) (discussing the two canons). As the foregoing discussion makes clear, considerations relevant to one rule are 
often relevant to the other. "
592,10," Respondents note that Sedima itself involved an injury suffered by a Belgian corporation in Belgium. Brief for Respondents 45-
46; see Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 483-484, 105 S. Ct. 3275, 87 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1985). Respondents 
correctly do not contend that this fact is controlling here, as the Sedima Court did not address the foreign-injury issue. "
593,11," Pfizer most directly concerned whether a foreign government is a “person” that may be a Clayton Act plaintiff. But it is clear 
that the Court’s decision more broadly concerned recovery for foreign injuries, see 434 U.S., at 315, 98 S. Ct. 584, 54 L. Ed. 2d 
563 (expressing concern that “persons doing business both in this country and abroad might be tempted to enter into 
anticompetitive conspiracies affecting American consumers in the expectation that the illegal profits they could safely extort 
abroad would offset any liability to plaintiffs at home”), as respondents themselves contend, see Brief for Respondents 44 
(“[T]his Court clearly recognized in Pfizer that Section 4 extends to foreign [****48]  injuries”). The Court also permitted an 
antitrust plaintiff to sue for foreign injuries in Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 82 S. Ct. 
1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1962), but the Court’s discussion in that case focused on the extraterritoriality of the underlying antitrust 
prohibitions, not the Clayton Act’s private right of action, see id., at 704-705, 82 S. Ct. 1404, 8 L. Ed. 2d 777, and so sheds little 
light on the interpretive question now before us."
593,12," This does not mean that foreign plaintiffs may not sue under RICO. The point is that RICO does not include the explicit 
foreign-oriented language that the Pfizer Court found to support foreign-injury suits under the Clayton Act. "
594,13," In respondents’ letter notifying this Court of the waiver of their domestic-injury damages claims, respondents state that 
“[n]othing in the stipulation will affect respondents’ claims for equitable relief, including claims for equitable relief under state 
common law that are not at issue in this case before this Court.” Letter from David C. Frederick, Counsel for Respondents, to 
Scott S. Harris, Clerk of [****50]  Court (Feb. 29, 2016). Although the letter mentions only state-law claims for equitable relief, 
count 5 of respondents’ complaint seeks equitable relief under RICO. App. to Pet. for Cert. 260a-262a, Complaint ¶¶181-188. 
This Court has never decided whether equitable relief is available to private RICO plaintiffs, the parties have not litigated that 
question here, and we express no opinion on the issue today. We note, however, that any claim for equitable relief under RICO 
based on foreign injuries is necessarily foreclosed by our holding that §1964(c)’s cause of action requires a domestic injury to 
business or property. It is unclear whether respondents intend to seek equitable relief under RICO based on domestic injuries, 
and it may prove unnecessary to decide whether §1964(c) (or respondents’ stipulation) permits such relief in light of 
respondents’ state-law claims. We leave it to the lower courts to determine, if necessary, the status and availability of any such 
claims."
594,1," The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §1961 et seq., makes it unlawful “to . . . invest” in 
an enterprise income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity, §1962(a), “to acquire or maintain” an interest in an 
enterprise [****52]  through a pattern of racketeering activity, §1962(b), “to conduct or participate . . . in the conduct” of an 
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity, §1962(c), or “to conspire” to violate any of those provisions, §1962(d). "
596,2," Insisting that the presumption against extraterritoriality should “apply to §1964(c) independently of its application to §1962,” 
ante, at 18 - 19, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 498-499, the Court cites Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108, 133 S. Ct. 1659, 
185 L. Ed. 2d 671 (2013). That decision will not bear the weight the Court would place on it. As the Court comprehends, the 
statute there at issue, the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. §1350, is a spare jurisdictional grant that itself does not “regulate conduct 
or afford relief.” Kiobel, 569 U.S., at 116, 133 S. Ct. 1659, 185 L. Ed. 2d 671, 680. With no grounding for extraterritorial 
application in the statute, Kiobel held, courts have no warrant to fashion, on their own initiative, claims for relief that operate 
extraterritorially. See ibid. (“[T]he question is not what Congress has done but instead what [****56]  courts may do.”)."
596,3," The Court asserts that “[t]here is good reason not to interpret §1964(c) to cover foreign injuries just because the Clayton Act 
does.” Ante, at 25, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 502. The Clayton Act’s definition of “person,” 15 U.S.C. §12, the Court observes, “explicitly 
includes ‘corporations and associations existing under or authorized by . . . the laws of any foreign country.’” Ante, at 25, 195 L. 
Ed. 2d, at 502 (some internal quotation marks omitted). RICO, the Court stresses, lacks this “critical” language. Ibid. The Court’s 
point is underwhelming. RICO’s definition of “persons” is hardly confining: “any individual or entity capable of holding a legal or 
beneficial interest in property.” 18 U.S.C. §1961(3). Moreover, there is little doubt that Congress anticipated §1964(c) plaintiffs 
like the suitors here. See 147 Cong. Rec. 20676, 20710 (2001) (remarks of Sen. Kerry) (“Since some of the money-laundering 
conducted in the world today also defrauds foreign governments, it would be hostile to the intent [****59]  of [the USA PATRIOT 
Act, which added as RICO predicates additional money laundering offenses,] for us to interject into the statute any rule of 
construction of legislative language which would in any way limit our foreign allies access to our courts to battle against money 
laundering.”). "
603,1," IPPs also filed a motion for class certification, but briefing on the motion has been delayed by discovery disputes and 
settlement negotiations."
603,2," IPPs also reached a settlement agreement with these defendants, which I approved on January 14, 2016. "
605,3," Tooling agreements are agreements by which defendants designated one defendant to be the exclusive manufacturer of a 
particular aftermarket sheet metal part but still allow other manufacturers to sell that part. DPPs argue that such tooling 
agreements are evidence of a price-fixing conspiracy. "
608,4," For example, Lamb notes that aftermarket sheet metal is a commodity, meaning that every unit is the same; that different 
manufacturers' products are interchangeable; and that competition between manufacturers is based primarily on price. He also 
notes that defendants were the primary manufacturers of aftermarket sheet metal, meaning that purchasers had few alternatives 
to avoid artificially inflated prices and making it more likely that defendants' conduct affected the entire class. Additionally, Lamb 
points out the absence of economic substitutes for aftermarket sheet metal, which reduces the bargaining power of individual 
class members. "
609,5," For example, DPPs present evidence that defendants ""typically set prices for AM Sheet Metal Products at levels that are 20 
percent to 30 percent of OEM part prices."" Second Lamb Report at 21 (citing Wang Dep. 154:18-155:2 (Feb. 17, 2012); Yang 
Dep. 124:1-125:10 (Feb. 16, 2012)). "
610,6," To determine the but-for price, Lamb compared prices in the class period with those in the benchmark period. He chose 
September 5, 2009, the day after the class period through December 31, 2011 based on information provided by DPPs. "
615,1," TOI does not manufacture segmented (i.e., bifocal or trifocal) polycarbonate photochromic lenses. (D.I. 59 at 4). "
616,2," This image, which is merely illustrative, comports with VE's description of the different entities in the photochromic lens market. 
(See D.I. 63 at 117)."
616,3," TOI also partnered with lens casters that sold Transitions as their exclusive photochromic lens without a contractual exclusivity 
obligation. (See D.I. 39-7 at 7; D.I. 55-1 at 143). "
617,4," According to TOI's COO, TOI's exclusivity agreements with lens casters never applied to any labs owned by the lens casters 
and there were never exclusive or de facto exclusive agreements with any labs. (D.I. 39-7 at 8). VE does not argue or present 
evidence to the contrary. (See D.I. 57 at 24-25, 34-37). "
626,5," VE's expert, [*41]  Mr. Kenneth Baseman, also suggests that VE may have been able to avoid the delamination issue if it had 
not been for TOI's exclusionary conduct because VE would have been able to test LifeRx lenses in a small number of stores. (DI 
43-1 at 111-13). Mr. Baseman maintains that VE was unable to test for delamination because LensCrafters and VE feared that 
TOI would retaliate if it learned of LifeRx. (Id.). I am not persuaded that VE would have avoided the delamination issue if it were 
not for TOI because the record shows that LifeRx passed all of VE's delamination tests prior to launch (D.I. 41-5 at 58-59) and 
no contemporaneous documents state that VE would have conducted further testing (See D.I. 43-1 at 111-12; D.I. 58 at 13). "
627,6," I assume, without deciding, that D.I. 58 at 14, 1136 is admissible. "
628,7," TOI also seeks to exclude certain statements in the declarations of Mr. Hepper and Mr. Resnik on evidentiary grounds. (D.I. 99 
at 16). Although I have not considered, in deciding the motion for summary judgment, the specific statements that TOI contends "
629,," should be excluded, I recognize that there is no reason to presume that Mr. Hepper could testify from personal knowledge about 
TOI's intentions and motivations. (See D.I. 99 at 21). Assuming they were admissible, I concluded that Mr. Hepper's 
interpretations of TOI's conduct were insufficient evidence to prevent summary judgment in favor of TOI on VE's refusal to deal 
claim. (See supra Part III.B). Consequently, I decline to decide TOI's motion to exclude the specific statements in D.I. 58 and D.I. 
59 on which I did not rely. (See D.I. 99 at 21); Masci v. Six Flags Theme Park, Inc., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178666, 2014 WL 
7409952, at *4 n.3 (D.N.J. Dec. 31, 2014). "
641,1," Defendants MTC Financial, Inc. and U.S. Bank Trust, N.A., as Trustee for LSF9 Master Participation Trust have been served, 
(Dkt. No. 1 at 46), but have not yet answered."
641,2," Caliber argues that the Court should dismiss Charlotte Watson because she is not a signatory on the Deed of Trust and Note 
and cites to documents attached to its Request for Judicial Notice. Since the Court denies Caliber's Request for Judicial Notice, 
the Court denies Caliber's motion to dismiss Charlotte Watson at this time. "
643,3," BANA argues that the RESPA claim against U.S. Bank fails because it was not a servicer of the loan; however the argument is 
unnecessary because the first cause of action is against BANA and Caliber only and not U.S. Bank. (Dkt. No. 8, FAC at 21.) "
644,4," Caliber moves to dismiss the TILA provision for failing to cite to provisions of TILA that it violated. BANA does not move to 
specifically dismiss the TILA claim based on Plaintiffs failure to allege specific facts; it moves to dismiss generally both 
Regulation X and Regulation Z on the merits. However, the FAC does not allege any facts to support violations of TILA and 
therefore, the TILA claim must be dismissed."
644,5," ""Congress gave the Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD"") authority to regulate under RESPA, and HUD 
promulgated the corresponding regulations known as Regulation X. The Dodd—Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act transferred the regulatory authority of RESPA from HUD to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (""CFPB""), 
and CFPB later republished Regulation X without material changes."" Edwards v. First American Corp., 798 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th 
Cir. 2015) (concerning anti-kickback provision of RESPA). "
645,6," Plaintiffs also argue and cite to the Federal Register regarding the servicer's duty to provide accurate information regarding loss 
mitigation options. (Dkt. No. 16, Ps' Opp. at 8.) However, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how loss mitigation options are 
subject to the disclosure provisions of 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36, which is the basis of the first cause of action. HN13[
] Disclosure requirements regarding loss mitigation options are provided in 12 C.F.R. § 1024.41 when a borrower submits a loss mitigation 
application. Here, Plaintiffs have not alleged they submitted a loss mitigation application. "
647,7," The reinstatement quotes address Plaintiffs' request for information for the amount required to bring the loan current. (Dkt. No. 
8, FAC ¶ 71.) "
649,8," This section concerns what information is not required to be provided by the servicer to the borrower. It appears that Plaintiffs 
may have meant to cite to 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36(d) which addresses the response requirement when a borrower submits a 
request for information."
649,9," In a footnote, Caliber argues that 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36 does not require a servicer to respond to any request that is the same as 
previously requested and complied with. Caliber argues that it previously provided information about the owner and investor 
when it sent Plaintiffs copies of the assignment of the deed of trust. However, the Court notes that even if Caliber is exempt from 
providing duplicative information, the regulations require the servicer to notify the borrower of this determination in writing no 
later than five days after making such determination. See 12 C.F.R. § 1024.36(f). "
650,10," The Court also notes that while the argument was not raised [*31]  by Caliber, BANA's argument concerning the inapplicability 
of RESPA to inquiries concerning loan modification and information concerning the original loan transaction and its subsequent 
history would apply to Caliber. See Medrano, 704 F.3d at 666-67; Smallwood, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 160926, 2015 WL 
7736876, at *6. "
652,11," Biakanja v. Irving, 49 Cal. 2d 647, 320 P.2d 16 (1958) (six factor test to determine whether a duty exists)."
652,12," In support to its statement that BANA does not owe Plaintiffs a duty of care to respond to RFIs or NOEs, (Dkt. No. 10-1 at 15), 
BANA cites to district court cases that held that there is no duty of care under RESPA and Regulation X based on the affirmative 
disclosure requirement to provide proper disclosures concerning the terms and conditions of the loan. See Mendoza v. 
Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 112423, 2009 WL 4706350, at *2, 5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 3, 2009) (no duty of 
care under Cal. Civ. Code Section 1916.7, TILA, HOEPA, RESPA, and the Regulations X and Z for failing to provide statutorily 
mandated disclosures); Avila v. Countrywide Home Loans, No. 10cv5485-LHK, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 34071, 2011 WL 
1192999, at *5 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2011) (no duty of care under TILA, HOEPA, RESPA and Regulations X and Y to provide 
proper [*40]  disclosures concerning the terms and conditions of the loans as lenders do not owe a fiduciary duty to borrowers); "
653,," Levy v. JP Morgan Chase, 10cv1493 DMS(BLM), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118232, 2010 WL 4641033, at * (S.D. Cal. Nov. 5, 
2010) (no duty of care under TILA, HOEPA, RESPA and the Regulations X and Z). These cases do not address the issue in this 
case of whether there is a duty to respond to RFIs and NOEs under RESPA. Plaintiffs' case citations are not supportive."
653,13," Plaintiffs did not provide the proper legal analysis on the duty of care. They focused on the duty of care as it relates to loan 
modifications which is not alleged in the negligence cause of [*41]  action. If the negligence claim is raised again in the second 
amended complaint, and another motion to dismiss is filed, the Court expects the parties to address the legal issue of duty of 
care as it applies to the facts alleged in the second amended complaint. "
654,14," Caliber cites Castaneda v. Saxon Mort. Servs., Inc., 687 F. Supp. 2d 1191, 1198 (2009) in support which held that a servicer 
of a loan owes no duty to the borrowers. However, the duty concerned the failure to make the required disclosures to the 
plaintiffs. Id. at 1197. The case did not address the duty to respond to inquiries by borrowers. "
657,15," BANA claims that the quiet title, cancellation of instrument and declaratory relief should be dismissed and lumps the 
arguments together making it difficult to distinguish what argument falls under which claim, as the legal standard on all three 
causes of action differ. "
658,16," California district courts are currently split on the issue whether plaintiffs alleging claims for quiet title must verify their 
complaints in federal court. Compare Briosos v. Wells Fargo Bank, 737 F. Supp. 2d 1018, 1031-32 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (dismissing 
without prejudice plaintiff's failure to assert a quiet title claim in a verified complaint); Ritchie v. Cmty Lending Corp., No. CV 09-
02484 DDP (JWJx), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 73216, 2009 WL 2581414, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Aug.12, 2009) (same) with Gomez v. 
Calpacific Mortg. Consultants, Inc., No. 09-CV-2926-IEG (CAB), 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64555, 2010 WL 2610666, at *5 n. 2 
(S.D. Cal. June 29, 2010); Fimbres v. Chapel Mortg. Corp., No. 09-CV-0886-IEG POR, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109261, 2009 WL 
4163332, at *6 (S.D. Cal. Nov.20, 2009) [*57]  (same); Delino v. Platinum Comm. Bank, 628 F. Sucpp. 2d 1226, 1237 (S.D. Cal. 
2009) (granting motion to dismiss quiet title b/c complaint does not identify the date as of which the determination is sought, or 
specify which of the several Defendants named in this action are asserting an adverse claim to the Property. Furthermore, the 
complaint is not verified). Here, since the Court grants in part Defendants' motion to dismiss, in order to avoid further briefing on 
this issue, Plaintiffs should refile a verified second amended complaint. "
659,17," The Court notes that while Plaintiffs allege cancellation of instrument on Assignment 1, (Dkt. No. 8, FAC ¶ 174), it appears 
they seek [*60]  cancellation of instrument on Assigments 2 and 3 only. (Id. ¶ 175.) Plaintiffs should clarify the claim when they 
file the second amended complaint. "
663,18," The paragraph numbers on page 37 of the FAC are not consecutive and are numbered 188, 39, 40. . . (Dkt. No. 8, FAC at 37.) 
Therefore, the paragraph numbers cited by the Court on the slander title cause of action are the ones on page 37 of the FAC. "

694,7," Although Judge Hornby certified a nationwide injunctive class and exemplar state damage classes (including a California class) 
in 2006, the First Circuit subsequently vacated his certification orders in 2008. (In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export 
Antitrust Litigation, supra, 522 F.3d 6; In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Antitrust (D.Me. 2006) 235 F.R.D. 127

California class certification in the federal action and Judge Hornby dismissed the California claims. (In re New Motor Vehicles 
Canadian Export Litigation (D.Me. 2009) 632 F.Supp.2d 42, 63.) "
695,8," The parties disagree as to the import of Judge Hornby's conspiracy discussion. While certainly relevant, we do not view Judge 
Hornby's analysis as binding [***16]  on us in any way, especially since he appears to have considered much more of plaintiffs' 
evidence than our own trial court did. (In re New Motor Vehicles Canadian Export Litigation, supra, 632 F.Supp.2d at pp. 47–50.)"
695,9," The other manufacturers filed similar summary judgment motions on the conspiracy issue, which are not included in the record 
before us. In addition, all of the remaining defendants filed a joint motion for summary judgment on the issue of antitrust impact 
as well as a motion to exclude the opinions and testimony of plaintiffs' expert witness, Robert E. Hall, Ph.D. Although fully 
briefed, these two joint motions [***18]  have not been argued or decided by the trial court. "
696,10," In conjunction with its order granting summary judgment, the trial court issued separate orders ruling on plaintiffs' objections to 
Ford's evidence, Ford U.S.'s evidentiary objections, and the objections to plaintiffs' evidence filed by Ford Canada. "
699,11," On appeal, plaintiffs do not challenge the trial court's exclusion of Millette's first statement—that he remembered “comments 
being made that everyone supported the concept of trying to keep the vehicles in Canada.” We therefore focus our review on the 
admissibility of his two subsequent statements and do not consider the first statement in our summary judgment analysis."
699,12," Although not necessary to our resolution of this matter, we note that if statements attributable to all of the other participants at 
the May 15 meeting were the basis for Millette's conclusion that a consensus had been reached to keep Canadian automobiles 
in Canada, then any such statements would likely themselves be admissible as admissions of co-conspirators, because they 
would have then been made while participating in a conspiracy and in furtherance of the objective of that conspiracy. [***33]  
(Evid. Code, § 1223.) Indeed, such statements could also be understood as operative facts, evincing the conspiratorial 
agreement itself, and therefore be deemed admissible as nonhearsay. (See 1 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (5th ed. 2012) Hearsay, §§ 
32–36, pp. 825–830.) Of course, logically, it is difficult if not impossible to reach any ultimate conclusion regarding how these 
alleged “statements” should be characterized as there is absolutely no evidence of who actually said what, a circumstance which 
underscores the inherent unworkability of Ford's “conveyed” hearsay theory."
699,13," In November 2015, the parties were given the opportunity to file supplemental letter briefs addressing this theory of 
admissibility, along with certain others. Both did so, and we have considered their submissions in rendering our decision. In 
Ford's supplemental briefing, the automobile manufacturer argues that plaintiffs' failure to specifically reference section 800—
either in the trial court or on appeal—precludes any reliance on it. As described in detail above, however, Ford claimed in the "
700,," trial court that the statements at issue are hearsay and plaintiffs have argued strongly, both below and before this court, that they 
are not. We believe that this was more than sufficient [***36]  to preserve the issue. Having agreed with plaintiffs that the 
testimony is nonhearsay and was erroneously excluded, we consider section 800 only as part of our prejudice analysis. Indeed, 
even if further specificity were required to preserve the argument in this limited context, plaintiffs claimed in their appellate 
briefing that “Mr. Millette used his senses to observe behavior at the meeting and form an understanding of what happened. He 
conveyed his understanding through his testimony.” And, before the trial court, plaintiffs similarly argued: “He perceives what 
happens at the meeting. He takes away an understanding of that. He is competent to testify about what he perceived at the 
meeting, that where before there wasn't a consensus … now there was.” The trial court seemed to agree, stating: “[M]y present 
view of that is that he is giving his understanding of what happened and that this is not hearsay.” (Italics added.) Thus, plaintiffs 
have adequately raised the question of whether Mr. Millette could properly testify as to his understanding or opinion regarding 
the events at issue. "
701,14," Ford repeatedly urges us to defer to the trial court's exercise of discretion in this case. However, because the trial court made 
a legal error—characterizing nonhearsay as hearsay—it never [***41]  exercised its discretion with respect to whether the 
testimony at issue was otherwise admissible. If anything, though, the court's comments seem to indicate that it properly 
understood Millette's statements for what they are: His understanding of what happened at the May 2001 meeting. "
703,15," HN17[
] “In antitrust actions [***50]  brought under the Cartwright Act, we look to interpretations of its federal law counterpart, the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.), for guidance since the federal act was a model for our own in 
most respects.” (Biljac Associates v. First Interstate Bank (1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1410, 1420 [267 Cal. Rptr. 819] (Biljac), 
disapproved on other grounds as stated in Reid, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 532, fn. 8.) "
704,16," Other cases considering conspiracy allegations in the context of cutting off a discount channel of distribution include Coca-
Cola Co. v. Omni Pacific Co., Inc. (N.D.Cal., Sept. 27, 2000, No. C 98-0784 SI) 2000 U.S.Dist. Lexis 17089 (Coca-Cola) 
(sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment [***53]  on claim of illegal horizontal conspiracy between Coca-Cola and its 
competitors to eliminate exporters selling lower priced United States beverages into higher priced foreign markets based on 
exchanges of information regarding those exporters), Toys “R” Us, Inc. v. F.T.C. (7th Cir. 2000) 221 F.3d 928 (agreements 
between Toys “R” Us and toy manufacturers to restrict sales to a discount competitor of Toys “R” Us constitute illegal horizontal 
conspiracy where toy manufacturers would not enter into agreements without assurances that other manufacturers were also 
bound), and Alvord-Polk, Inc. v. F. Schumacher & Co. (3d Cir. 1994) 37 F.3d 996, 1005–1006, 1013–1014 (Alvord-Polk) 
(evidence insufficient to prove conspiracy among wall-covering manufacturers to restrict sales by discount 800-number dealers). "
707,17, We discuss below the insufficiency of information gathering from competitors as a basis for establishing antitrust liability. 
708,18," Specifically, the trial judge opined: “I think the law is that if you're doing something parallel without concerted effort and then at 
some point you go into—you enter into an arrangement, an agreement, by which you say we're going to keep doing this and 
now we're all going to do it together like we were before, but we're going to keep doing this, maybe step up our—but we promise 
we won't stop. I think that's enough to get to a jury as a matter of law. I think that is covered by the Cartwright Act.” In the end, 
however, [***69]  the trial court described plaintiffs' assertion that Ford Canada had conspired with others to continue doing what 
it had previously been doing unilaterally as “pure speculation.” As we discuss in detail below, we disagree with this 
characterization of plaintiffs' evidence. "
709,19," Unsurprisingly, this coincided with information gathering by the manufacturers with respect to the scope [***73]  of the problem 
and possible solutions implemented by competitors. In December 1999, a Ford Canada employee reported a discussion with his 
“contact” at Honda Canada regarding Honda Canada's existing export restrictions, including the voiding of warranties. In June 
2000, a Ford Canada employee contacted his counterpart at Chrysler Canada and learned exports were a major problem for 
them. In September 2000, a Ford Canada executive spoke with Toyota Canada and learned about its response to the export 
problem, including pricing “hot” cars the same in the United States and Canada. "
710,20," When deposed, both Ford Canada executives offered nonconspiratorial, though differing, explanations for their use of the term 
“export compromise.”"
710,21," Citing Continental Ore, plaintiffs argue on appeal that the trial court erred by failing to consider all of the conspiracy evidence 
as a whole. Instead, they claim, the court below compartmentalized the various types of evidence and then gave the benefit of "
711,," the doubt to Ford on every category. The trial court, however, expressly addressed this very argument, stating: “I didn't 
compartmentalize the evidence. I'm aware that when you have a claimed conspiracy, the parts relate to each other.” More 
fundamentally, given our de novo review of the matter, the trial court's process in reaching its decision is essentially irrelevant. 
We will engage in our own review of all of the evidence presented. (See Continental Ore, supra, 370 U.S. at p. 699; see also 
Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c) [summary judgment appropriate only when “all the papers submitted” show no issue of 
material fact].)"
711,22, These statements regarding the potential benefits of joint action were not admitted by the trial court for their truth. 
712,23," Indeed, this is the position that was initially articulated by the trial court, which stated during the summary judgment hearings 
below: “You can't satisfy your burden by showing that there was an opportunity to meet. You can't satisfy your burden to show 
that they simply met without regard to regarding [sic] anything. So the type of evidence you usually see that there was a 
convention and they [***84]  all went to the convention, and they all had dinners together and the like; not enough. [¶] What you 
have here is a series of communications where it is clear what the topic of the communications would be, and I think there is 
admissible evidence as to each of the defendants here that they participated to some extent in communications with each other 
where the topic of the problem that they all shared was discussed. So that's different than saying, well, they had lunch at the 
American Bankers Association.” "
713,24," Although we do not consider it in reaching our decision, we note that there is other potential direct evidence of conspiracy in 
the record that the trial court excluded on hearsay grounds, a decision not challenged by plaintiffs for purposes of this summary 
judgment motion. For instance, a draft letter by a senior executive at Chrysler Canada dated April 2002 to “All DaimlerChrysler 
Canada Retailers” states: “We have joined forces with the other manufacturers (with CVMA and AIAMC) and have met with 
CADA officials to explore additional deterrents to the export activity.” (Italics added.) [***89]  In addition, an internal e-mail from 
Pierre Millette to others at Toyota Canada describes an April 2002 meeting among representatives of CADA, various 
manufacturers, and dealers as follows: “GM was not present but had advised they were supportive of joint action. They are 
involved in a lawsuit with one of the biggest exporters and one of the allegations is an industry conspiracy to stop exports which 
makes their participation in the conspiracy (all present agreed there was nothing illegal with what was being done) to stop 
exports a problem.” (Italics added.) "
715,25," As mentioned above, Ford has filed a motion to exclude the opinions and testimony of Robert Hall in the trial court, along with 
voluminous supporting documentation. Plaintiffs, for their part, have responded with extensive materials of their own opposing 
Ford's motion. The trial court, however, has yet to take any action on Ford's motion to exclude, and thus the Hall reports 
submitted by plaintiffs in opposition to Ford's summary judgment motion remain HN31[
] “evidence set forth in the papers” to which no objection has been sustained by the trial court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (c).) As such, they must be considered 
by the trial court—and in this court's de novo review—“[i]n determining whether the papers show that there is no triable issue as 
to any material fact.” (Ibid.; see also Code Civ. Proc., § 437c, subd. (b)(2).) "

723,5," AIDS Healthcare could have pursued its anticipation and obviousness theories (but not its subject matter theory) through the 
inter partes review procedure at the United States Patent and Trademark office where it would have enjoyed a more favorable 
claim construction standard, but it could not have asserted its theories that the patents covered unpatentable subject matter or

741,1," The facts contained in this Opinion are drawn from Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint (Dkt. #106), cited as ""Am. Compl."" For 
convenience, Defendants' brief in support of their motion to dismiss (Dkt. #153) is cited as ""Def. Br.""; Plaintiffs' [**55]  brief in

limits. (Dkt. #139). The parties sought 50 pages for their respective principal briefs and 25 pages for Defendants' reply; the Court 
granted the parties 40 pages for the principal briefs and 20 pages for reply. (Dkt. #140). The Court was dismayed to see both 
sides circumvent these carefully-selected page limits by shunting large chunks of their briefs into footnotes with a smaller 
typeface. For further submissions in this case, and for further cases before this Court, the parties are directed to follow both 
letter and spirit of the Court's orders."
741,2," These CRSs were early [**57]  versions of GDSs. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 294). For the purposes of this motion, the Court treats 
the terms ""CRS"" and ""GDS"" as synonymous. "
744,3," The FAA, as amended by the ADA, was originally codified at 49 U.S.C. §§ 1301-1542. The provision cited in the text was 
originally contained at 49 U.S.C. § 1305(a). In 1994, Congress recodified the FAA and the ADA so that this provision is now 
found at 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b)(1). As part of the recodification, Congress changed the phrase ""rates, routes, or services"" to 
""price, route, or service,"" but did not intend this modification to substantively change existing law. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 677, 
103rd Cong., 2d Sess. 83-84 (1994). "
746,4," Because the Court finds Plaintiffs' state-law claims to be preempted, it does not address whether Plaintiffs have satisfied the 
standing inquiry applicable to those claims. "
748,5," The Court observes that Defendants' characterization of Plaintiffs' claims as too remote to confer standing is somewhat at odds 
with their preemption argument. To be sure, the [**81]  inquiry as to whether a claim is ""related to"" airline fares and services is 
distinct from the question of whether the alleged harms flow directly from Defendants' purported misconduct. Nevertheless, 
Defendants highlight Plaintiffs' allegation that ""[t]he supracompetitive prices paid by Plaintiffs and Class members for Airline 
tickets are traceable to, and the direct, proximate and foreseeable result of, Defendants' supracompetitive prices for GDS fees"" 
— that is, they highlight the alleged direct link between Defendants' GDS fees and airline ticket prices — in support of their 
preemption argument. (Def. Br. 7). To then argue that the alleged ""'singular' connection"" between Defendants' conduct and 
increased prices for consumers fails to present direct injury strikes the Court as too clever by half. (Id. (quoting Am. Compl. ¶ 
34)). "
749,6," Defendants analogize Plaintiffs' claims to those brought by consumers against credit card companies for alleged 
anticompetitive agreements, pursuant to which merchants were required to accept debit cards if they accepted [**83]  credit 
cards. (Def. Br. 27; Def. Reply 12-13). However, in finding that consumer-plaintiffs in those cases lacked standing, courts 
considered the ""daunting evidentiary problems of proving any marginal effect of the excessive debit card fees vis a vis the 
multitude of other pricing factors that impact the ultimate purchase price of any and all products that a Visa or MasterCard 
merchant sells,"" observing that ""one cannot 'conceive of an economically feasible way to administer a trial which would require 
inquiry into how every retailer set the price for every consumer good sold in this state.'"" Strang v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., No. 03 Civ. 
011323, 2005 WL 1403769, at *4 (Wis. Cir. Ct. Feb. 8, 2005) (quoting Crouch v. Crompton Corp., No. 02 CVS 4375, 2004 
NCBC LEXIS 6, 2004 WL 2414027, at *27 (N.C. Super. Oct. 26, 2004)); see also Gutzwiller v. Visa U S A Inc., No. C4-04-58, 
2004 Minn. Dist. LEXIS 19, 2004 WL 2114991, at *9 (Minn. Dist. Ct. Sept. 15, 2004), abrogated on other grounds by Lorix v. 
Crompton Corp., 736 N.W.2d 619 (Minn. 2007). To the extent that these cases are considered analogous to the case at hand, the concerns expressed therein are largely 
obviated by the fact that Plaintiffs' only remaining claim seeks injunctive relief rather than damages. Furthermore, the facts of the 
credit card cases suggest that the injuries there alleged were significantly less direct and certain than those alleged in the 
present case: Whereas plaintiffs in the credit card cases alleged an [**84]  increase in prices charged by all card-accepting 
merchants for the entire range of goods offered by those merchants, here Plaintiffs claim an increase in price for a single service 
sold by a limited group of airlines. See Peterson v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., No. Civ. A. 03-8080, 2005 D.C. Super. LEXIS 17, 2005 WL 
1403761, at *5 (D.C. Super. Ct. Apr. 22, 2005) (noting that consumers had failed ""to point to any particular products"" for which 
they had paid inflated prices); Knowles v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., No. Civ. A. CV-03-707, 2004 Me. Super. LEXIS 227, 2004 WL 
2475284, at *6 (Me. Super. Oct. 20, 2004) (noting that ""[w]hile this might be a manageable inquiry if only one product were 
involved, the complexity of inquiry is geometrically increased when all of the different pricing variables applicable to each and 
every retail product sold in the state must be considered""). "
750,7," In addition to arguing that Plaintiffs' federal Sherman Act claim is barred by the doctrine of laches, Defendants also contend 
that as a result of Plaintiffs' delay in bringing suit, Plaintiffs' state-law claims are barred by the applicable state statutes of 
limitations. (Def. Br. 31-32). Because the Court finds Plaintiffs' state-law claims to be preempted, the Court does not reach the 
issue of whether those claims fall within their respective limitations periods. "
751,8," The Court notes that unlike the application of fraudulent concealment to toll a statute of limitations, specific elements need not 
be pleaded when asserting a defendant's wrongdoing to counter the affirmative defense of laches. State of N.Y. v. Cedar Park 
Concrete Corp., 684 F. Supp. 1229, 1234 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (""Although the fraudulent concealment doctrine requires the pleading 
of specific elements, there is no similar requirement to counter the laches defense against equitable relief.""); see also Tuffy v. 
Nichols, 120 F.2d 906, 909 (2d Cir. 1941) (finding that ""[e]ven if there was no intentional or fraudulent concealment, [defendants] 
can hardly plead the equitable defense of laches"" where they knew of plaintiff's ignorance). "
755,1," Plaintiff alleges, on information and belief, that Monster was aware that Plaintiff and other competitors, would not be allowed to 
sell products through the military resale system without a Master Broker or Sub Broker. Compl. ¶ 39."
755,2," At around the same time, High Plains was also serving as a Sub Broker for Monster. Compl. ¶ 33. "
756,3," Plaintiff also alleges that Monster harms competitors by exerting influence over Master Brokers and Sub Brokers to provide 
shoddy services or not to provide services to competitors. Compl. ¶¶ 42-43. While in contract with Mid Valley, Plaintiff 
experienced several problems with the firm's services including ""shoddy product displays, incorrect entry of Plaintiff's product 
UPC information in DECA's electronic accounting system, and overall neglect regarding product placement and presentation 
with DECA for product code advancement."" Id. ¶ 40. Some commissaries did not receive orders from Hip Hop because of 
incorrect UPC information, but the brokers did not correct these problems because of Monster's influence. Id. ¶ 41. And Plaintiff 
alleges that Defendant has engaged in anticompetitive conduct in other markets. Id. ¶¶ 57-59. Monster disrupted Plaintiff's 
contractual and prospective economic relationship with Costco and Walgreen in a manner similar to its conduct in the Military 
Resale Market. Id. ¶¶ 57-58."
756,4," While harm to a competitor is relevant, Plaintiff must do more to plead a connection between its direct harm and harm to 
competition overall. See, e.g., Hasbrouck v. Texaco, Inc., 842 F.2d 1034, 1040 (9th Cir. 1987) (""The purpose of drawing a 
distinction between harm to competition and harm to competitors is to point out that not all acts that harm competitors harm 
competition.""). "
757,5," For example, the Court is unable to determine whether the relevant market includes commissaries alone, includes other military 
locations, or includes locations not controlled by the military purchasing process."
757,6," Because the Court dismisses Plaintiff's federal antitrust claims, it also dismisses its Cartwright Act and UCL claims. ""The 
analysis under California's antitrust law mirrors the analysis under federal law because the Cartwright Act was modeled after 
the Sherman Act."" Cty. Of Tuolumme v. Sonora Cnty. Hosp., 236 F.3d 1148, 1160 (9th Cir. 2001). Therefore, when a plaintiff's 
Sherman Act claims are dismissed for failure to state a claim, plaintiff's Cartwright Act claims should also dismissed. In re Late 
Fee & Over-Limit Fee Litigation, 528 F. Supp. 2d 953, 965 (N.D. Cal. 2007), aff'd, 741 F.3d 1022 (9th Cir. 2014). Likewise,

decision, many states passed so-called ""Illinois Brick repealer statutes,"" which give indirect purchasers the right to sue when 
firms violate analogous state antitrust laws. See, e.g., Robert H. Lande, New Options for State Indirect Purchaser Legislation: 
Protecting the Real Victims of Antitrust Violations, 61 Ala. L. Rev. 447, 448 (2010). Such states are referred to a ""repealer 
states."" A state which has not enacted such a statute is referred to as a ""non-repealer state."" "
810,13," Certain objections were withdrawn or stricken prior to publication of this order. Excluding those, the Court considered the 
materials at ECF Nos. 4400 (""IPP Obj.""), 4401 (""Clifton Obj.""), 4384 (""Saik Obj.""), 4101 (""Hull Obj.""); 4436 (""RU Obj.""); 4437 (""C-
S Obj.""); 4439 (""St. John Obj.""); 4440 (""Bonsignore Obj.""); and 4466 (""Williams Obj.""). The Hull objection is actually an objection 
litigated before Special Master Quinn but incorporated by reference and objections re-made in response to the publication of the 
R&R. See 4394 at 1. Three [*176]  responses were filed. See ECF Nos. 4431 (""C-S Resp.""), 4449 (""IPP Resp.""), and 4479 (""IPP 
Williams Resp.""). Two additional briefs were timely filed and will be considered, see ECF Nos. 4545-4, 4558, but relate only to 
attorneys' fees, expenses, or incentive awards and thus have no bearing on the subject matter of this order."
810,14," The Attorneys General of Connecticut, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, 
Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Virginia jointly filed one Statement of Interest. See ECF No. 4462 (""Non-Repealer State 
SOI""). The Attorneys General of Massachusetts and Missouri jointly filed a second. See ECF No. 4463 (""MA & MO SOI""). New 
Hampshire, the third omitted repealer state, neither joined any Statement of Interest nor filed one of its own."

810,16," Pursuant to discussions held at the second fairness hearing, the Court ordered the IPPs to file support for Chunghwa's notice 
costs. See ECF No. 4584. The IPPs did so. See ECF No. 4592. "
812,17," Objector Hull objects to the R&R, but merely re-urges and incorporates by reference all his original objections as made before 
the Special Master. The Court permits this tactic. See ECF No. 4430 at 2. However, as the underlying objections were 
addressed by Special Master Quinn, merely re-urging the same objections provides no basis to disturb the Special Master's 
findings. "

814,21, Objections related to the lack of a cy pres recipient are addressed (and overruled) later in this order. 
815,22," The Court considers this factor, as it must, but gives it little weight. ""Although a court might give [*190]  weight to the fact that 
counsel for the class or the defendant favors the settlement, the court should keep in mind that the lawyers who negotiated the 
settlement will rarely offer anything less than a strong, favorable endorsement."" Principles of the Law of Aggregate Litigation 
§ 3.05 comment a (2010)."
815,23," Special Master Quinn did not address these Statements [*192]  because they were filed after he had completed his review of 
the settlements. He concluded: ""Other than the California Attorney General, who filed a Statement of Interest asserting various 
conditional objections, no other governmental official has raised any concern regarding the settlements. This fact favors approval 
of the Proposed Settlements."" ECF No. 4351 at 34. The facts before this Court have now changed, and so the Court gives this 
finding by the Special Master no weight."
815,24," The Court includes California in this total because it filed a Statement of Interest before Special Master Quinn, although it has 
not filed any objection to the Special Master's R&R. California appears to have acquiesced in the Special Master's resolution of 
the objection it filed before him. "
816,25," Although the quoted language is from the Phillips Settlement, the other agreements are materially identical. "
818,26," Given that these powers have been employed to permit remedies of disgorgement under the Federal Trade Commission Act 
and the Fair Labor Standards Act, Objectors Cooper and Scarpulla attempt to read three more recent cases as allowing 
disgorgement under Section 16 of the Clayton Act. The Court agrees with the Special Master that the cases cited by objectors "
819,," are inapposite. [*202]  See United States v. Keyspan Corp., 763 F. Supp. 2d 633, 639-640 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), In re TFT-LCD (Flat 
Panel) Antitrust Litig., No. C 10-4346 SI, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76562, 2011 WL 2790179, at *3-4 (N.D. Cal. July 12, 2011); In 
re Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Antitrust Litigation, No. M-02-1486-PJH (MDL No. 148), Docket No. 2132 at 84. 
Keyspan and LCD are distinguishable because they were brought by the Government instead of a private party. DRAM permits 
a party to include a request for such a remedy in a complaint, but does not reach the issue of whether private disgorgement 
could ever be awarded."
819,27," Objectors do cite Oregon v. AU Optronics Corp. (In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig.), MDL No. 1827, 2011 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 76562, 2011 WL 2790179 (N.D. Cal. July 11, 2011) for the proposition that such relief is available. In a later order issued 
in the same case, however, Judge [*203]  Illston recognized that a request for ""restitution under federal law . . . would be 
barred."" In re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust Litig., 787 F. Supp. 2d 1036, 1040 (N.D. Cal. 2011)."
819,28," Objectors rely on Nat'l Super Spuds, 660 F.2d at 9, to argue that the release of uncompensated claims is not permitted. The 
basis of the Second Circuit's holding there, however, was that the claims being released had not been asserted in the complaint "
820,," and were based on a different factual predicate. Super Spuds is inapposite to the present case. Compare In re Auction Houses 
Antitrust Litig., 42 F. App'x 511, 519 (2d Cir. 2002) (""In the twenty-one years since Super Spuds, we have never affirmed the 
approval of a class action settlement which included the uncompensated impairment of non-class claims unless the non-class 
claims were based on the identical factual predicate as the class claims."" (emphasis in original)) with Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v. 
Visa USA, Inc., 442 F.3d 741, 748 (9th Cir. 2006) (""The weight of authority holds that a federal court may release not only those 
claims alleged in the [*206]  complaint, but also a claim 'based on the identical factual predicate as that underlying the claims in 
the settled class action . . . .'"" (quoting Class Plaintiffs, 955 F.2d at 1287-89)) and Lipuma v. Am. Express Co., 406 F. Supp. 2d 
1298, 1317-19 (S.D. Fla. 2005) (distinguishing itself from Super Spuds and Auction House because there ""the claimants [we]re 
one and the same.""). Moreover, even if Super Spuds could be read to hold that no class action claim can ever be released 
without compensation, the Ninth Circuit has never adopted such a rule. See Nguyen, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63312, 2014 WL 
1802293, at *7 (C.D. Cal. May 6, 2014) (""The Objector argues that any settlement that releases any claim without compensation 
is per se unreasonable, but the Objector's authority does not bear this out.""). "
822,29," Missouri's State Attorney General suggests they could have brought a case under Missouri's Merchandising Practices Act 
(""MMPA""), Mo. Rev. Stat. § 407.010, et seq. See MA & MO SOI at 4. HN31[
] The MMPA provides for a five year statute of 
limitations. See Owen v. Gen'l Motors Corp., 533 F.3d 913, 921 n.6 (8th Cir. 2008) (five year limitations period in § 516.120 
applies to MMPA claims). As over five years have passed, however, any MMPA claims would also be time-barred. "
823,30," This includes Massachusetts, even though the Massachusetts claims were dismissed. Special Master Legge was clear that 
""certainly no procedural [*215]  dismissal of this nature should bar the filing of a truly new suit."" See ECF No. 768 at 13. 
Objectors were thus free (with notice of that freedom) to bring a new claim after the stipulation but prior to expiration of the 
statute of limitations."
823,31," The formula is only approximate because the denominator (step two) will need to be adjusted to filter out the products that 
comprise the $25 minimum payment claims, and the value multiplier (step three) will need to be adjusted to subtract the $25 
minimum payments from the money available for distribution. "
824,32," ""Secondly, when that residue occurs and we know how much it is and we have a handle on it, you can make supplemental 
claims distributions. For example, to late claimants. You can further exhaust the amount."" ECF No. 4512 at 51. "
825,33," Given that Lead Counsel has submitted a new proposal which is the subject of the Plan R&R, the Court denies as moot any 
objection to the original Chunghwa allocation plan. See ECF No. 4351 at 41-46; IPP Obj. at 9; Bonsignore Obj. at 12-14; Plan 
Resp. at 1 n.2."
825,34, Theirs was the only timely objection. See ECF No. 4494 (striking the objection at ECF No. 4470). 
835,1," Early in the litigation, the Court consolidated all indirect and direct purchaser class actions that had been filed across the 
country. Thus, the first group is in fact many separate cases that the Court is treating in a consolidated fashion for pre-trial 
purposes. "
836,2," The Court's Order on the Class Action Defendants' Summary Judgment Motions may be found at In re Domestic Drywall 
Antitrust Litig., 163 F. Supp. 3d 175, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19487, 2016 WL 684035 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 18, 2016). The parties in the 
Class Action are now involved in class-action issues."
836,3," Continental's Motion was inadvertently left off of the Ashton Woods docket, so the ECF citation for Continental's Motion is from 
the MDL docket, 13-md-2437. "
838,4," Homebuilder Plaintiffs allege in a footnote that ""[t]he USG companies (including Defendant L&W Supply) are members of the 
conspiracy. [*12]  . . . Alternatively, Defendant USG Corporation is a member of the conspiracy by virtue of its status during the 
Conspiracy Period as the alter ego of Defendants United States Gypsum Company and L&W Supply."" SAC ¶ 45 n.3."
838,5," In SAC ¶ 279, Plaintiffs also allege that L&W had the opportunity to conspire at a dinner with one of L&W's clients. Although 
this is at least some allegation of fact, a mere opportunity to conspire, particularly between a customer and vendor, is insufficient 
to allege membership in an antitrust conspiracy. "
839,6," E.g., SAC ¶¶ 191, 194, 195, 231."
839,7," E.g., SAC ¶¶ 43, 45, 57, 265."
839,8," E.g., SAC ¶¶ 187, 224."
839,9," The Court found only two references: ""Defendant L&W Supply also mocked the legality of announcing prices more than 30 
days in advance of any price increase."" SAC ¶ 149. ""[O]n September 19, 2011 (the date provided by Mr. Metcalf), senior pricing 
officials at Defendant USG and Defendant L&W Supply held a call to discuss the elimination of job quotes and the 
implementation of a price increase."" SAC ¶ 190. This allegation is sufficient as a matter of law for reasons stated in the text 
under the Copperweld case. "
840,10," When the parties present their ultimate choice-of-law arguments, they should carefully consider Hammersmith v. TIG 
Insurance, 480 F.3d 220 (3d Cir. 2007). "
841,11," Ultimately, the Court will have to make many choice-of-law decisions related to this claim. Although the Homebuilder Action is 
not a class action, the Court asks the parties to carefully consider Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 105 S. Ct. 
2965, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1985), when it comes time to address the consumer protection choice-of-law issues. "
853,1," Each of these documents includes both an answer and counterclaims. In each document, the paragraph numbering starts over 
at 1 in the counterclaim portion. Throughout this Order, paragraph-only citations to ECF Nos. 317, 318, and 320 (e.g., ECF No. 
320 ¶ 1), refer to the paragraph numbers in the counterclaim portion of those documents."
853,2," ECF No. 318 is United's counterclaims. As between Aetna, Anthem, and United, United's counterclaim allegations are the most 
detailed, but they are also largely representative of Aetna's and Anthem's allegations. Accordingly, for purposes of stating the 
Counterclaimants' allegations in this Part II, the Court will cite only to ECF No. 318. "
856,3," HN4[
] The Colorado Antitrust Act is the state law analogue to the Sherman Act. See Colo. Rev. Stat. § 6-4-119 (""the courts shall use as a guide interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable federal antitrust laws""). Because federal antitrust 
law principles apply to both the federal and state antitrust claims, the Court will analyze both claims together. See Four Corners 
Nephrology Assocs., P.C. v. Mercy Med. Ctr. of Durango, 582 F.3d 1216, 1220 n.1 (10th Cir. 2009)."
856,4," All ECF page citations are to the page number in the ECF header, which does not always match the document's internal 
pagination, particularly in briefs with prefatory material (such as a table of contents) and in exhibits. "
857,5," Plaintiffs' Motion to Dismiss prominently asserts this disconnect in Counterclaimants' injury theory. (See ECF No. 346 at 14-15.) 
Surprisingly, neither Aetna's nor United's respective response briefs offer any rebuttal. "
860,6," As explained in Parts III.A & G, herein, this statute does not provide a private cause of action, but it nonetheless may be 
considered when determining whether the ASCs' alleged interference with contract satisfies the element of ""improper"" 
interference."
860,7," In any event, HN15[
] ERISA preemption does not apply to non-ERISA health plans. Thus, Aetna's and United's tortious 
interference and unjust enrichment claims would survive at least as to these plans. "
861,8," Rather than responding to Counterclaimants' position, Plaintiffs asserted for the first time in their reply brief that there can be no 
unjust enrichment because Counterclaimants do not pay the amount billed by the ASCs, but instead something less than that 
based on Counterclaimants' decisions regarding a reasonable reimbursement rate. ""It can hardly be contended,"" say Plaintiffs, 
""that Aetna and United's payments to the ASCs were 'unjust' in light of Aetna and United's unilateral roles in determining the 
amount of the payments."" (ECF No. 377 at 27.) Plaintiffs had ample opportunity to raise this argument in their opening brief, and 
did so in their challenges to other counterclaims. The Court therefore must consider the argument's absence in the opening 
brief's discussion of unjust enrichment to be a deliberate decision, and Plaintiffs have therefore waived the argument in this 
phase of the case. "
862,9," Plaintiffs do not direct this same attack at Counterclaimants' theories of tortious interference based on the insurer-insured 
relationship. The Court therefore has no occasion to examine it in that context. "
863,10, Plaintiffs do not argue that this claim fails due to United's discretion over reimbursement amounts. 
866,1," The jurisdiction seems obvious as the racetrack operates at least four races weekly, and the revenue of plaintiffs is around fifty 
six thousand dollars per lost track day. The races at Camarero are transmitted in foreign countries, such as, the Dominican "
867,," Republic, as well as Continental United States and Puerto Rico. The racetrack also provides betting facilities of races televised 
from other States of the Union. Horse owners buy horses in Puerto Rico and from the mainland United States. Two or three 
races are dedicated every day which include imported horses. See Docket No. 5, par. 34-35. The Court invites defendants to 
show if the conclusion of the Court is erroneous as to compliance with interstate commerce has been satisfied. "
868,2," How this amount is paid amongst the plaintiffs is not clear at this time, but the payment is regulated by the administrative 
agency that governs and regulates to horse racing, that is, the Horse Racing Industry and Sports Administration. The Horse 
Racing Industry and Sports Administration is the only entity that can approve a request to vary the $20.00 payment to the 
jockeys for riding in a horse race. "
869,3," Whether the jockey mounts on any particular race or horse depends on whether the particular horse owner selects the jockey 
to ride the horse depending on the availability of the jockey to race in a particular race. See Docket No. 5, page 3, par. 14-15. "
870,4," For identical rulings relating to racetracks, see Taylor v. Local 7, International Union of Journeymen Horseshoers, 353 F.2d

1859, 16 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1966). As to lawyers working as individual counsel (as independent contractors for the government) 
representing indigent defendants engaged in a ""concerted refusal to deal,"" the Court refers to FTC v. Superior Court Trial 
Lawyers Association, 493 U.S. 411, 110 S. Ct. 768, 107 L. Ed. 2d 851 (1990). "
884,1," HN3[

884,2," RAP 2.3(b)(4) provides discretionary review of a trial court decision may be accepted when [t]he superior court has certified, or all the parties to the litigation have stipulated, that the order involves a controlling question of

885,4," We stress that our opinion is limited to the attorney general's .080 claims. The attorney general's complaint broadly requested 
injunctive relief, damages, restitution, civil penalties, and attorney fees, and the State subsequently specified that it seeks 
damages on behalf of state agencies that were purchasers of CRT products under .090, restitution for state consumers under 
.080, and civil penalties under RCW 19.86.140. CP at 2, 27-28; State's Resp. at 2. The Court of Appeals addressed only 
whether the State's .080 claim for injunctive relief and restitution is subject to a statute of limitations and declined to consider 
whether the .090 and .140 claims were untimely, concluding those issues were beyond the scope of the certified questions it 
granted for review. LG Elecs., Inc., 185 Wn. App. at 151. "

894,13," In light of the limited number of jurisdictions without an express statute of limitation provision, the Superior Court of 
Connecticut's decision in Connecticut v. Mobilia, Inc., No. 65134, 1983 WL 14950, at *1-2 (Super. Ct. Conn. June 3, 1983) 
(unpublished) appears to be the only analogous case, and it suffers from the same interpretive flaw. "
896,14," Again, Herrmann does not compel a different result. Unlike in Herrmann, where the State had an interest [***40]  in protecting 
the integrity of the existing insurance system through deterrence of potentially repetitive behavior, 82 Wn.2d at 7, here, there is 
no potential for the alleged conspiracy to reoccur as CRTs are old technology. "
897,1," By statute, a hearing examiner's proposed decision may become the final order of the Board if the Board fails to act within 30 
days. R.C. 4517.58. However, as explained herein that presupposes that there are sufficient Board members to constitute a 
quorum. "
899,2," ""Automatic adoption provisions satisfy due process requirements if the party with the claim of entitlement had the opportunity 
for a meaningful hearing and consideration of its claim, and the decision adopted by operation of [*6]  law is consistent with the 
factual determinations made during the administrative proceeding."" Bob Daniels Buick Co. at *13. "
915,1," E3 and Aetna's conduct is also consistent with the conduct of parties that believe Plaintiffs engaged in fraudulent overbilling. 
See Verdict, Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Bay Area Surgical Management, LLC, Case No. 1-12-CV-217943 (Apr. 13, 2016) 
(awarding $37,452,199 to Aetna). The Court recognizes that appeals have not been exhausted in that case. See Stipulation, 
Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Bay Area Surgical [*30]  Management, LLC, Case No. 1-12-CV-217943 (June 28, 2016) (stipulating 
to stay proceedings until July 18, 2016 to delay entry of judgment and appeal deadlines so parties can engage in settlement 
discussions). The Court takes judicial notice of both these filings as they are court documents. "
918,2," Tellingly, Plaintiffs do not address the Supreme Court's decision in NYNEX in either of its oppositions. "
923,1," Chemence's argument that the Intervenors' motions should be denied because they have not produced a confidentiality log 
identifying the documents being withheld is also not well-taken. (See Chemence's Br. in Opp. at 2). Chemence has cited no 
authority for requiring such a log; moreover, the information is being requested of the FTC—not the Intervenors—so the 
Intervenors would not know exactly what items the FTC has in its possession that would be responsive to the requests for 
production. In any event, the information is not relevant to the current lawsuit. "
925,2," The FTC's antitrust authority was at issue in the cases that Chemence cites; in each case, the FTC sued to enjoin a merger or 
acquisition that threatened competition. (See Chemence Br. in Opp. at 8-9 and cases cited therein). The market information from 
third-party competitors was relevant to the FTC's investigation of whether the mergers would be anti-competitive and violate 
antitrust law. As discussed above, in a deceptive trade practices case such as the one before this Court, the conduct of other 
industry participants is not relevant. "
930,1," Plaintiffs state in their complaint that ""[a]ll references in the complaint to 'Warner Chilcott' include Warner Chilcott plc and ""all 
related entities and subsidiaries that were acquired by Actavis plc (now operating as 'Allergan plc' as of June 15, 2015) and/or 
Warner Chilcott Limited as part of the October 1, 2013 acquisition and transaction."" D. 26 n.1. Warner Chilcott [*11]  argues that 
Plaintiffs have named the wrong entities as defendants because Warner Chilcott Company LLC (an unnamed party) signed the 
Settlement Agreement and therefore they should be dismissed from the case. D. 52 at 60-62. Plaintiffs acknowledge that their "
931,," complaint does not name Warner Chilcott Company LLC as a defendant. D. 54 at 19. Nevertheless, they point out that 
""[a]lthough an improper defendant is indicated in the caption, we may consider a complaint to have named the proper defendant 
if the allegations made in the body of the complaint make it plain that the party is intended as a defendant."" Callahan v. Wells 
Fargo & Co., 747 F. Supp. 2d 247, 251 (D. Mass. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the operative 
complaint makes clear that Warner Chilcott Company LLC is an intended party, the Court considered it named and analyzed the 
motions accordingly."
931,2," Plaintiffs, in D. 56, urge the Court to strike Exhibits 2-17 attached to the Cole Declaration, D. 53, which Defendants assert may 
be considered without converting the motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment, see D. 63. The Court ALLOWS "
932,," nunc pro tunc Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file a reply memorandum in support of their motion to strike, D. 74, and considered it 
in resolving the motion to strike. The Court declines to consider Exhibits 2-9 [*15]  because the parties want the Court to draw 
competing factual inferences from these exhibits, an inappropriate task at this stage. See Evergreen Partnering Grp., Inc. v. 
Pactiv Corp., 720 F.3d 33, 45 (1st Cir. 2013) (noting that ""[i]t is not for the court to decide, at the pleading stage, which 
inferences are more plausible than other competing inferences, since those questions are properly left to the factfinder""). The 
Court, however, takes judicial notice of Exhibits 10-11 only for the purpose that the FDA has not yet approved generics for 
Asacol and Asacol HD. D. 53-10, D. 53-11. The Court did not rely on Exhibits 12-17 in considering the motions to dismiss. The 
request to strike Exhibits 12-17, D. 56, is thus denied as moot."
932,3," In March 2012, the FDA issued draft guidance recommending that manufacturers avoid two substances (one of which was 
DBP) because research had suggested that the two substances were linked to poor reproductive and developmental outcomes. 
D. 26 ¶ 131. The FDA finalized this guidance in December 2012. Id. ¶ 132. "
933,4," Plaintiffs agree that the Court may consider the Settlement Agreement, [*19]  referenced in the amended complaint, at this 
stage. D. 57 at 12."
933,5," The Settlement Agreement also contains acceleration clauses, which would have allowed Zydus to sell its generic Asacol HD 
product even earlier than November 15, 2015 had a third party entered the market or obtained a favorable judicial decision. D. 
53-1 at 10, D. 52 at 71. Plaintiffs, however, do not allege that these provisions are unlawful and concede that the Court need not 
consider them. D. 54 at 18 n.13. "
934,6," Because causation is an element of constitutional standing and antitrust standing, Defendants raise arguments about them 
together. D. 51 at 7-15, D. 52 at 13-17. "
935,7," D. 53-11; see Drugs@FDA, FDA Approved Drug Products, https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm 
(enter ""Asacol HD""; then submit) (last visited July 19, 2016). "
938,8," Compare In re Suboxone (Buprenorphine Hydrochloride & Naloxone) Antitrust Litig., 64 F. Supp. 3d 665, 682 (E.D. Pa. 2014) 
(denying motion to dismiss after noting that the ""key question is whether the defendant combined the introduction of a new 
product with some other wrongful conduct, such that the comprehensive effect is likely to stymie competition, prevent consumer 
choice and reduce the market's ambit,"" with ""the somewhat unique characteristics of the pharmaceutical market in mind""); 
Abbott Labs. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 432 F. Supp. 2d 408, 422 (D. Del. 2006) (denying motion to dismiss because the 
""nature of the pharmaceutical drug market"" [*35]  supports antitrust scrutiny of the defendants' ""product-switching conduct"") with 
Walgreen Co. v. AstraZeneca Pharm. L.P., 534 F. Supp. 2d 146, 151 (D.D.C. 2008) (granting motion to dismiss because ""there 
is no allegation that AstraZeneca eliminated any consumer choices"")."
938,9," Warner Chilcott also argues that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine immunizes the hard switch scheme because the company 
removed Asacol from the market because of the FDA's safety concerns over DBP. D. 52 at 53-55. Because both sides dispute 
the link between Defendants' actions and the FDA's stance on DBP, Plaintiffs' allegations sufficiently preclude the conclusion 
that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine applies as a matter of law because ""[t]he scope of [the Noerr-Pennington doctrine] depends . 
. . on the source, context, and nature of the anticompetitive restraint at issue"" and ""[t]he dividing line between restraints resulting 
from governmental action and those resulting from private action may not always be obvious."" Allied Tube & Conduit Corp. v. 
Indian Head, Inc., 486 U.S. 492, 499, 501-02, 108 S. Ct. 1931, 100 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1988); see Abarca Health, LLC v. PharmPix 
Corp., 915 F. Supp. 2d 210, 216 (D.P.R. 2012) (noting that the applicability of the doctrine ""is a highly factual determination[] 
inappropriate for a dismissal motion""). "
939,10," The Court's conclusion that Plaintiffs lack standing for Count II extends to all Count II claims, particularly because, as stated 
above, the two sides agree that the state law claims should be interpreted harmoniously [*39]  with federal antitrust law. See 
supra Section V.B; In re Androgel Antitrust Litig. (No. II), 687 F. Supp. 2d 1371, 1382 (N.D. Ga. 2010) (stating that ""[b]ecause 
the Plaintiffs' allegations do not state a plausible antitrust claim under federal law, the Indirect Purchasers also do not state a 
plausible antitrust claim under state law""). Dismissal of Count II claims on state-specific grounds are thus an additional reason 
for dismissal."
939,11," Plaintiffs urge the Court to strike Attachments 1-4 (D. 52 at 99-109), which were appended to Warner Chilcott's memorandum 
in support of their motion to dismiss, because they exceed the page limits. D. 57 at 18-19. Although Defendants should have 
sought leave to exceed the page limits [*40]  set in this case, these charts are routinely accepted in these types of cases. See, 
e.g., Suboxone, 64 F. Supp. 3d at 696 n.21. Plaintiffs' request to strike these charts is DENIED. The Court, however, did not rely 
on Attachment 5 in considering the motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs' request to strike Attachment 5 is DENIED as moot. "
940,12," Both parties agree that the statute of limitations for a claim under the Montana Unfair Trade Practices [*42]  Act is two years. 
D. 52 at 97, D. 58 at 25. Defendants argue that the Montana monopolization claim (Count I) is untimely because the first 
complaint was filed more than two years after the withdrawal of Asacol. D. 52 at 97. Nevertheless, courts have held that ""a new 
cause of action accrues to purchasers upon each overpriced sale of the drug."" Solodyn, 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125999, 2015 
WL 5458570, at *8 (quoting In re Niaspan Antitrust Litig., 42 F. Supp. 3d 735, 747 (E.D. Pa. 2014)). The Court declines to 
dismiss this claim on statute of limitations grounds. "
941,13," The eleven states are the following: California, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nevada, New York, Oregon, 
Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin. D. 52 at 91-94."
941,14," Compare In re Aggrenox Antitrust Litig., 94 F. Supp. 3d 224, 254 (D. Conn. 2015) (declining to dismiss because the notice 
requirements were procedural), motion to certify interlocutory appeal on other grounds granted, No. 3:14-md-2516 SRU, 2015 
U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94516, 2015 WL 4459607 (D. Conn. July 21, 2015), and In re Aftermarket Filters Antitrust Litig., No. 08-cv- "

correct that nothing [*47]  in the statutory scheme suggests that defendants may use the statute as a shield to avoid answering 
for alleged anti-competitive behavior""), with In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., 749 F. Supp. 2d 224, 232 (M.D. Pa. 
2010) (dismissing indirect purchasers' claim for failing to comply with notice requirements with leave to amend), and In re Flash 
Memory Antitrust Litig., 643 F. Supp. 2d 1133, 1158 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (same). "
943,15," Defendants criticize Plaintiffs for failing to cite the correct statutes for their Utah and Oregon claims. D. 52 at 99. Because 
Plaintiffs confess error and Defendants assumed for the purposes of their motion that Plaintiffs had cited the correct statutes, D. 
52 at 99 nn.68-69, D. 58 at 23 n.32, the Court declines to dismiss these claims on this basis. Defendants also argue that claims 
brought under Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (""FDUTPA"") should be dismissed because they do comport with 
the pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9. D. 52 at 83-84. Courts, however, disagree whether such claims must be pled with 
particularity. See, e.g., In re Auto. Parts Antitrust Litig., No. 12-md-02311, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90724, 2014 WL 2999269, at 
*19 (E.D. Mich. July 3, 2014) [*52]  (concluding Rule 9 was inapplicable to FDUTPA claims based on price-fixing conspiratorial 
conduct brought by end payors). The Court finds In re Auto. Parts persuasive and declines to dismiss the Florida claims on this 
basis. "
946,1," Except as otherwise noted, the court finds the following facts to be material and undisputed for purposes of summary judgment. 
Additionally undisputed facts are set forth in the court's Opinion below in the context of specific counts in the complaint."
946,2," As the parties' respective proposed findings of facts have not included this background information, the court has referred to 
their respective expert reports to fill in the gaps. (See Kevin Murphy Am. Expert Rpt. (dkt. #298) at 7-8; Barry C. Harris Expert 
Rpt. (dkt. #322) at 8-11.) Most of the general background appears to be in dispute; neither is it strictly material to the outcome of 
the parties' respective motions for summary judgment. "
947,3," By definition, a ""cow"" has given birth to at least one calf, while a ""heifer"" is a female who has never had a calf. "
951,4," ST has withdrawn a claim for breach of confidentiality based on ""ST's morphology criteria."" (Defs.' Opp'n Br. (dkt. #334) at 68-
69.) "
953,5," ABS and Genus confirm as much in their response to ST and XY's ""proposed finding of fact"" to this effect, stating that they are 
challenging the enforceability of Section 4(b) as a whole. (Resp. Supp. PFOF (dkt. #350) ¶ 428.) "
954,6," ST cites two examples of ABS and Genus's fraudulent misrepresentations regarding their intention to perform the under the 
Agreement -- ""we look forward to working together over the coming years to our mutual benefit"" and ""we look forward to working 
with you in the years ahead."" (Defs.' Opp'n [*33]  Br. (dkt. #334) at 53.) Both statements certainly sound more aspirational than 
representations of fact upon which ST could reasonably rely. Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 341 
S.W.3d 323, 327 (Tex. 2011) (""Material means a reasonable person would attach importance to and would be induced to act on 
the information in determining his choice of actions in the transaction in question.""). Regardless, the Agreement's integration 
clause disavowal of ""all previous communications, representations or undertakings"" renders defendants' supposed reliance of 
these general statements unreasonable. (Agreement (dkt. #258-7) ¶ 21.) "
955,7," Defendants' alternative arguments for promissory estoppel, alleging that plaintiffs failed to disclose the scope of its GSS 
technology or ""promised to be bound by the liquidated damages provisions in the Agreement"" (Answer (dkt. #302) ¶ 231), are 
doomed for the same reason. Here, defendants simply seek to negate ABS's challenge to the liquidated damages provisions as 
unenforceable under Texas law. Having failed to explain how any promise to be bound by a contract is enforceable under a 
promissory estoppel theory, the court will dismiss defendants' promissory estoppel claims. "
956,8," The parties agree that ABS's unfair competition claim under the common law of Wisconsin rises or falls with its Sherman Act 
claim, and so, it is not addressed separately. "
958,9," Professor Murphy is the Jury Stiler Professor of Economics in the Booth School of Business and Department of Economics at 
the University of Chicago, which is also where he earned his doctorate. "
959,10," Of course, the court will continue to consider whether the evidence as a whole at trial supports such a finding. "
962,11," The court will deny ABS's motion to strike Cynthia Ludwig's declaration that Monsanto was uninterested in licensing, rather 
than selling its patent technology. (Dkt. #368.) At least for summary judgment, ST sufficiently established that Ludwig had 
adequate personal knowledge based on her participation in meetings from which she could describe the understanding as to 
whether the patents ST acquired from Monsanto were available for licensing. [*62]  (Dkt. #374.)"
962,12," ST's arguments that the ""failing company defense"" and the Noerr-Pennington doctrine save its patent acquisitions from § 2 
scrutiny are likewise easily [*64]  dismissed as applying to claims falling under § 7 of the Clayton Act. Contrary to ST's assertion, "
963,," ABS could, as it did, elect to challenge ST's patent accumulation under § 2 of the Sherman Act, and ST fails to demonstrate that 
the failing company defense is applicable to a § 2 claim. With respect to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, the Seventh Circuit has 
refused to immunize a party's conduct when litigation is used as a vehicle for eliminating competition regardless of the outcome 
of the suit. See Winterland Concessions Co. v. Trela, 735 F.2d 257, 263-64 (7th Cir. 1984) (""As this court has previously noted, 
'it has long been thought that litigation could be used for improper purposes even where there is probable cause for the litigation; 
and if the improper purpose is to use litigation as a tool for suppressing competition in the antitrust sense . . . it becomes a 
matter for antitrust concern.'"") (quoting Grip-Pak, Inc. v. Ill. Tool Works, Inc., 694 F.2d 466, 472 (7th Cir. 1982)). Since ABS 
accuses ST of accumulating and asserting patents for the purpose of restricting competition in violation of § 2, among other 
anticompetitive behavior, the court declines to apply the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to protect the challenged conduct."
963,13," See also Kobe, Inc. v. Dempsey Pump Co., 198 F.2d 416, 422 (10th Cir. 1952) (""Ordinarily patent pools when created for 
legitimate purposes are not illegal in themselves. Agreements [*65]  which require licensees to assign future inventions or 
patents are not in themselves illegal. Such agreements, however, which effect a restraint of trade or create monopolies, if 
designed for that purpose, are violations of the law."") (internal citations omitted); Id. at 425 (""The facts . . . are sufficient to 
support a finding that although Kobe believed that some of its patents were infringed, the real purpose of the infringement action 
and the incidental activities of Kobe's representatives was to further the existing monopoly and eliminate Dempsey as a 
competitor. The infringement action and the related activities, of course, in themselves were not unlawful, but when considered 
with the entire monopolistic scheme which preceded them, we think, as the trial court did, that they may be considered as having 
been done to give effect to the unlawful scheme.""). "
965,14," The parties' experts generally agree that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have at least an undergraduate degree in 
the biological sciences, engineering or chemistry, as well as at least three years of experience with cell sorting or sperm cells. 
(Robinson Report (dkt. #294) ¶ 11; Ludwig Report (dkt. #296) ¶ 24; Nolan Report (dkt. #297) ¶ 25.) The differences among the 
characteristics of the person of ordinary skill in the art proposed by the parties' experts are not material for the purposes of the 
present motions. "
966,15," The parties identify no difference between ""sort strategies"" and ""sorting strategies,"" nor do there appear to be any material 
differences between the two terms. "
967,16," This overlap finds further support in the specification: [*77]  80:41-48 (""In general, as will be pointed out below, there are many 
control strategies which may be employed to maximize particle throughput and there are many sorting strategies that may be 
employed with each particular control strategy.""); 86:23-26 (""Thus, as discussed earlier, particles such as sperm cells may be 
accepted or rejected for sorting into a population of desired cells based on the probability that such particles belong in the usable 
population""). Further descriptions abound. See 127:18-21 (""Different control sorting strategies can be employed in a photo-
damage system, including the 'high recovery' and 'high purity' sorting strategies discussed above in the context of a droplet 
sorter.""); 127:46-51 (""It should be noted that multiple particles in a first series or multiple particles in a second series could be 
'closely spaced,' but since the particles in any such series have the same characteristic (A or B), they are treated as a single-
particle series, at least for sorting strategy purposes."") "
969,17," [*83] Although ST has the better of the argument on the construction of these terms, ABS does not infringe claims 9 and 10 
for reasons unrelated to this claim construction dispute as set forth below. "
977,1," References to ""Dkt."" followed by a number refer to documents filed in this action in the New York State Courts Electronic Filing 
(NYSCEF) system."
977,2," The following definitions of MCO, IPA, and Provider are set forth in an exhibit to the parties' contract: ""Managed Care Organization"" or ""MCO"" shall mean the person, natural or corporate, or any groups of such persons, 
certified under Public Health Law Article 44, who enter into an arrangement, agreement or plan or any combination of 
arrangements or plans which provide or offer, or which do provide or offer, a comprehensive health services plan. ""Independent Practice Association"" or ""IPA"" shall mean an entity formed for the limited purpose of arranging by contract 
for the delivery or provision of health services by individuals, entities and facilities licensed or certified to practice medicine 
and other health professions, and, as appropriate, [*3]  ancillary medical services and equipment, by which arrangements 
such health care providers and suppliers will provide their services in accordance with and for such compensation as may 
be established by a contract between such entity and one or more MCOs. ""IPA"" may also include, for purposes of this 
Agreement, a pharmacy or laboratory with the legal authority to contract with other pharmacies or laboratories to arrange 
for or provide services to enrollees of a New York State MCO. ""Provider"" shall mean physicians, dentists, nurses, pharmacists and other health care professionals, pharmacies, hospitals 
and other entities engaged in the delivery of health care services which are licensed, registered and/or certified as 
required by applicable federal and state law. See Dkt. 48 at 15 (emphasis added). It should be noted that both IPAs and Providers are contractually permitted to subcontract 
out their services, for instance, to Affiliated Providers. That said, the definitions of IPA and Provider make clear that the latter 
actually provides medical services while the former does not."
977,3, The 1997 Agreement and additional amended agreements are not in the record. 
978,4," See. e.g., Dkt. 67-71 (letters sent by Academy to Healthfirst between November 6, 2012 and I January 23, 2013 indicating that 
Academy's new name had ""IPA"" in it)."
978,5," Healthfirst executed the 2014 Agreement on April 3, 2014, and Academy executed it on May 8, 2014. See Dkt. 48 at 11."
978,6," The full corporate names of each of the three Healthfirst entities are listed on the signature lines; Academy is referred to as 
""ACADEMY ORTHOTIC and PROSTHETIC"". See Dkt. 48 at 11."
978,7, This was [*7]  confirmed at the recent discovery conference. 
979,8," The excerpted copy of the Provider Manual submitted by Healthfirst indicates that it was revised on September 26, 2014, 
almost 2 months after Academy was terminated. See Dkt. 49. Absent from the record is a complete copy of this version of the 
Provider Manual or any portion of the Manual in effect prior to Academy's termination. Nor is it clear which version was in effect 
prior to the execution of the 2014 Agreement or if the Provider Manual is at all mentioned in prior versions of the contracts. 
Academy's counsel indicated that it was not. In light of Healthfirst's incomplete and irrelevant submissions, the record is devoid 
of documentary evidence that could justify dismissal of the contract claim based on Healthfirst's contention that Academy failed 
to comply [*9]  with the Provider Manual."
979,9," Other important defined terms, which are not reproduced here, are set forth in section 1 of the 2014 Agreement. See Dkt. 48 at 
1-2."
979,10," Section 2.10 further provides: Healthfirst shall give Provider at least thirty (30) days written notice of any change to the Provider Manual that affects 
Provider's rights or responsibilities under this Agreement, except where adoption of such a change must be [*10]  made on 
shorter notice to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or requirements under the Plan Contracts. No provision of the 
Provider Manual may be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement. See Dkt. 48 at 4. "
981,11, SDOH is defined in the 2014 Agreement to mean the New York State Department of Health. See Dkt. 48 at 2.
981,12," Stein is referred to as a defendant [see AC ¶ 38], even though he is not a party in this action. Stein was named as a defendant 
in the Federal Action, discussed herein."
981,13," It should be noted that Healthfirst represented to the court at the recent discovery conference that it was not involved in such 
investigation until late [*18]  2014, after it had terminated Academy, that such investigation had nothing to do with the seat lift 
coding issue, and that Healthfirst was considered a victim and received restitution. "
982,14," While the AC states that the letter was dated October 24, the actual letter, attached to the AC as Exhibit E, is dated October 
28, 2014. See Dkt. 38 at 2. "
984,15," It should [*25]  be noted that Judge Weinstein's decision cited communications between Fidelis and Academy that clearly 
demonstrate that Fidelis knew Academy was an IPA and that they agreed there was no need to convert their Provider 
agreement to an IPA agreement. See 312 FRD at 286 (quoting 12/12/14 email from Academy to Fidelis). "

to preclude a person from asserting a right after having led another to form the reasonable belief that the right would not be 
asserted, and loss or prejudice to the other would result if the right were asserted. The law imposes the doctrine as a matter of 
fairness. Its purpose is to prevent someone from enforcing rights that would work injustice on the person against whom 
enforcement is sought and who, while justifiably relying on the opposing party's actions, has [*35]  been misled into a detrimental "
987,," change of position""). It should be noted that the claims are not otherwise alleged to be invalid. The only issue is the identity of 
the Provider."
987,18," Academy's only breach discussion is its cursory suggestion in its opposition brief that Healthfirst's termination of Academy 
caused Academy and its Providers to breach their contracts. Academy further states, [*39]  without explanation, that ""the 
Providers also breached at least Sections 3.2, 4.1, 5.1, and 5.2 of the provider agreement."" See Dkt. 61 at 31. For Academy to 
properly plead this claim, it must make its allegations in its pleading, not in its attorney's unsworn brief, and must provide more 
than conclusory allegations. "
988,19," The court sees no reason to address the parties' dispute over possible conflict between the federal cases cited by Academy 
and Court of Appeals precedent since any such discussion would be dicta. The tortious interference claim is pleaded 
insufficiently in the AC, and, according to Academy's opposition brief, appears to be capable of being repleaded based on 
alleged breaches by the Providers, mooting the need to rely on Academy's own breach. The court will only address this issue if 
Academy's claims turn exclusively on its own breach."
988,20," If repleaded, these claims should be set forth in separate causes of action."
988,21," The Court of Appeals has explained that tortious interference with business relations is more difficult to satisfy because 
""greater [*41]  protection is accorded an interest in an existing contract (as to which respect for individual contract rights 
outweighs the public benefit to be derived from unfettered competition) than to the less substantive, more speculative interest in 
a prospective relationship (as to which liability will be imposed only on proof of more culpable conduct on the part of the 
interferer)"". NBT Bancorp Inc. v Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Inc., 87 NY2d 614, 622, 664 N.E.2d 492, 641 N.Y.S.2d 581 
(1996) (citation omitted). "
989,22," To the extent Academy seeks to claim that legal, but nonetheless wrongful ""economic pressure"" [see Reading, 317 FSupp2d 
at 334-35] is the basis for its claim, such claim must be fleshed out with more detail than provided thus far. See generally Carvel 
Corp., 3 NY3d at 190-93 (discussing Guard-Life's holding with respect to competition). As noted, Healthfirst had the contractual 
right to terminate Academy for any reason."
989,23," That said, the parties have agreed to stay discovery until October 6, 2016, and this decision does not alter that agreement, 
which was so-ordered by the court. See Dkt. 82. It also should be noted that the parties have not asked the court to hold this 
motion in abeyance. See id."
989,24," The court declines to address the proper scope of damages since the issue was not raised in the parties' briefs, although the 
court's view on the damages recoverable on each cause of action will be a guiding factor in making ESI proportionality 
determinations in discovery. "
998,1," In accordance with ""the conventional summary judgment praxis,"" the Court recounts the facts in the [**6]  light most hospitable 
to PRTC's case theories consistent with record support. Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir. 2002). 
In compliance with this obligation, the Court recites supported facts as true even if OneLink disputes them."
998,2," OneLink stated that PRTC's first application was denied in November 2008, DSMF ¶ 2, but PRTC submitted [**7]  a qualified 
response and clarified that the decision from the TRB was handed down on October 29, 2008. PRDSMF ¶ 2 (citing Decl. of 
Dylan M. Carson (Carson Decl.) Attach. 1 Ex. 1, at 4, 10 (ECF No. 217) (Resolution and Order)). The Court adjusted the date to 
October 29, 2008."
998,3," PRTC admitted OneLink's paragraph 3, but also interposed a qualified response, noting that the TRB also based its decision 
on ""22 separate determinations of fact, including No. 3 which notes that OneLink submitted comments to the TRB objecting to 
the franchise application."" PRDSMF ¶ 3 (citing Resolution and Order at 4-7). The Court reviewed the record citation and 
included the number of findings of fact and that OneLink submitted comments to the TRB as an interested party. The Court did 
not include that OneLink in fact objected to the franchise application, as opposed to merely commenting on it, because Findings 
of Fact Number 3 does not support that assertion. See Resolution and Order at 4. "
999,4," PRTC's paragraph [**9]  1 originally stated that OneLink's motions and complaint were ""unsuccessful."" PSAMF ¶ 1. OneLink 
denied the paragraph to the extent it claims that the motions and complaint were ""unsuccessful,"" but OneLink otherwise 
admitted that they were filed on the dates asserted by PRTC. DRPSAMF ¶ 1. For example, OneLink points out that PRTC has 
presented no evidence that the Urgent Motion to Dismiss PRTC Application filed on February 25, 2009 was ever ruled on by the 
TRB, and clarified that the Cable Act Complaint filed on February 10, 2009 resulted in a ruling from Judge Gelpi that OneLink 
had demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its motion seeking a temporary restraining order and 
preliminary injunctive relief, and the complaint was eventually dismissed on the basis of mootness. Id. (citing San Juan Cable 
LLC v. Telecomms. Regulatory Bd. of P.R., 598 F. Supp. 2d 233 (D.P.R. 2009); Carson Decl. Attach. 6 Ex. 42). The Court has 
clarified that three of the motions presented to the TRB were ""unsuccessful"" because they were denied, included additional 
procedural history regarding the Cable Act Complaint, and deems the paragraph, as altered, admitted. D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(e)."
999,5," PRTC's paragraph 2 originally stated: ""In response [to the filing of the Motion to Intervene before the [**10]  TRB on January 
13, 2009], on January 21, 2009, the TRB vacated the previously scheduled February 11-13, 2009 hearing dates, and reset them 
for March 4-6, 2009."" PSAMF ¶ 2. In response, OneLink denied the paragraph in its entirety, arguing that the hearing dates were 
reset for March as a result of PRTC's motions to restrict access to certain exhibits, and furthermore, that PRTC ""has proffered no 
admissible evidence establishing or supporting a reasonable inference"" that the hearing dates were moved ""in response to any 
OneLink filing."" DRPSAMF ¶ 2. Both parties cite the same record evidence in support of their assertions. Carson Decl. Attach. 3 
Ex. 16 (Jan. 21, 2009 Resolution and Order). A review of the January 21, 2009 Resolution and Order reveals that the hearing was postponed as a result of both PRTC's 
motions and OneLink's motion. The TRB gave PRTC ten days to answer the Motion to Intervene, appeared to grant part or 
perhaps all of PRTC's motions for protection, and then declared, ""[i]n consideration of the foregoing, it is necessary to update the 
docket,"" including rescheduling the hearing dates. Id. at 1-2. The Court included that the filings of these motions impacted the 
hearing dates, and [**11]  otherwise overrules OneLink's denial."
999,6," PRTC's paragraph 4 asserted, as fact, that ""[h]ence, from January 13, 2009 through March 3, 2009, the TRB was forced to 
consider and respond to and/or deny no less than five objectively baseless filings by OneLink during the time it should have 
been considering the PRTC application."" PSAMF ¶ 4. This ""fact"" is an argument, not properly presented in a statement of 
material facts. Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990) (""the nonmoving party [may not] rest[] 
merely upon conclusory allegations""). Furthermore, even if ""fact,"" PRTC's record evidence does not support the assertion (citing 
the same record evidence it provided in its paragraphs 1 through 3). The Court will consider in due course whether the facts, 
viewed in the light most favorable to PRTC, demonstrate that OneLink's filings may have been ""objectively baseless."""
999,7," PRTC admitted OneLink's paragraph 6, but also interposed a qualified response, noting that the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals' 
stay came at the request of OneLink, and the Court of Appeals lifted the stay per its April 24, 2009 Resolution. PRDSMF ¶ 6 
(citing Carson Decl. Attach. 1 Ex. 2 at 1, 23; id., Ex. 3 at 7). The Court added these additional facts to provide context."
999,8," PRTC's paragraph 5 originally stated: ""When the appellate court lifted the stay on March 31, 2009, the TRB was faced with 
OneLink's still pending Urgent Motion to Dismiss PRTC Application."" PSAMF ¶ 5. In response, OneLink denied the paragraph in 
its entirety, contending that PRTC has not provided any record evidence that would allow a reasonable inference that ""the TRB 
ever ruled on (or even considered) OneLink's Urgent Motion to Dismiss PRTC Application, let alone that the TRB considered it 
during the period between March 31 and May 20, 2009."" DRPSAMF ¶ 5. The Court adjusted the language of PRTC's paragraph 
5 to reflect that the TRB had not reached a decision on the motion at the time the [**13]  stay was lifted, and otherwise overrules 
OneLink's denial. "
1000,9," OneLink admitted PRTC's paragraph 6 but noted that if ""PRTC intends to imply that, as a matter of fact, these filings 
determined the pace of the TRB's consideration of PRTC's franchise application, PRTC has proffered no admissible evidence 
establishing or supporting any such inference."" DRPSAMF ¶ 6. To the extent this assertion is intended as a qualified 
response, [**14]  it is overruled."
1000,10," PRTC's paragraph 7 stated: ""Once again, rather than considering PRTC application, the TRB was stuck in a web of OneLink 
petitions until the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico issued its May 20, 2009 stay."" PSAMF ¶ 7 (citing the same record evidence in 
its paragraphs 5 and 6). The record evidence provided by PRTC does not support its assertion that the TRB was ""stuck in a web 
of OneLink petitions"" until May 20, 2009, nor does it support a finding that these petitions somehow slowed down the application 
review process. The Court did not include PRTC's paragraph 7."
1000,11," PRTC admitted OneLink's paragraph 7, but also interposed a qualified response, noting that the stay issued by the Puerto 
Rico Supreme Court came at the request of OneLink. PRDSMF ¶ 7 (citing Carson Decl. Attach. 1 Ex. 4). The Court added this 
additional fact to provide context."
1000,12," OneLink admitted PRTC's paragraph 8 but interposed a qualified response, explaining that the parties were not notified of the 
November 24, 2010 decision until December 21, 2010. DRPSAMF ¶ 8 (citing Carson Decl. Attach. 1 Ex. 4). The Court added 
this fact to PRTC's paragraph 8."
1000,13," PRTC's paragraph 9 originally stated that it ""supplemented its application given the two years of delay since its December 
2008 submission."" PSAMF ¶ 9 (emphasis added). OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 9 in its entirety, asserting that the reason 
PRTC supplemented its application was because they were ordered to do so by the TRB. DRPSAMF ¶ 9 (citing Carson Decl. 
Attach. 1 Ex. 4; id., Attach. 4 Ex. 23 at 1 (Application Supplement)). OneLink also argued that PRTC submitted no evidence to 
support a claim that it supplemented its application as a result of delay, ""or that OneLink was responsible for any such delay."" Id. PRTC cited the same Application Supplement as OneLink in support of its paragraph 9. In its opening paragraph of the 
Application Supplement, PRTC explained that ""[i]n compliance with the Board's directives, and given that in the intervening two 
years since the application was filed [**16]  certain facts in the original application have changed, PRTC is hereby 
supplementing its original application."" Application Supplement at 1. In addition, in the TRB's November 24, 2010 Resolution and 
Order, it instructed PRTC ""to express itself on the matter"" due to the stay being lifted. Carson Decl. Attach. 1 Ex. 4 at 1. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to PRTC, the Court agrees with OneLink that the evidence does not support a 
finding that PRTC supplemented its application as a result of delay, and therefore, removed the words ""of delay"" from PRTC's 
paragraph 9. However, the record evidence supports the remainder of PRTC's paragraph 9. The TRB instructed PRTC ""to 
express itself on the matter"" but that was not an order that PRTC needed to supplement its application; PRTC chose to 
supplement its application."
1000,14," PRTC's paragraph 10 originally included that OneLink argued in its Motion to Recuse that ""the TRB's consideration of PRTC's 
franchise must sit in abeyance until the TRB ruled on its Motion."" PSAMF ¶ 10. OneLink denied the paragraph in its entirety, 
arguing that PRTC provided no evidence that the TRB was unable to set a hearing date between November 24, 2010 and "
1001,," January 20, 2011, and noting that OneLink did not argue in its motion that consideration of the franchise application had to ""sit in 
abeyance"" until a ruling on the Motion to Recuse. DRPSAMF ¶ 10 (citing Carson Decl. Attach. 4 Ex. 24 (Mot. for Recusal)). The 
Court overrules the denial as it relates to the fact that [**18]  the Motion to Recuse was filed before a hearing date had been set. 
The Court does not interpret PRTC's assertion the same way OneLink does—PRTC was simply noting that a hearing date had 
not been set yet, not that the TRB was unable to do so. However, the Court agrees that OneLink never argued in its motion that 
consideration of the franchise application could not occur until the TRB ruled on its motion; instead, OneLink requested that the 
TRB ""expunge from the record any information relating to President Torres' involvement to date in the Second Franchise 
Proceeding."" Mot. for Recusal at 8. The Court removed this part of PRTC's paragraph 10."
1001,15," PRTC's paragraph 11 originally included that ""[t]he TRB sought a formal ethics opinion from the [OGE]."" PSAMF ¶ 11. 
OneLink denied the paragraph in its entirety, asserting that the inquiry arose from a February 24, 2011 letter sent by President 
Torres to the OGE, and that ""[t]he OGE did not address any 'claims' raised by OneLink—it addressed President [Torres-] 
Lopez's inquiry."" DRPSAMF ¶ 11. Both parties cite the OGE response in support of their assertions. Carson Decl. Attach. 4 Ex. 
25 (Ethics Letter). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to [**19]  PRTC, the Court overrules the denial. A reasonable inference can be 
drawn that President Torres' letter was written in her capacity as President and Associate Member of the TRB, and thus, the 
response from the OGE was directed at both her and the TRB. The Court altered PRTC's paragraph 11 slightly to indicate that 
the letter originated with President Torres, and the Court removed the phrase, ""formal ethics opinion."" In addition, the Ethics 
Letter establishes that, contrary to OneLink's assertion, the OGE did address OneLink's claims, and decided that President 
Torres could remain involved in the PRTC franchise application proceeding. Id. at 2, 4 (""[A]s regards the possible conflict of 
interest noted by OneLink, we are of the opinion that you need not recuse yourself from intervening before the Board and any 
other venue, as President and Associate Member of the Board, in the case of Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Inc. h/n/c Claro 
TV, Case No. JRT-2008-CCG-0002, because you did not intervene or participate, directly or indirectly, in the case while you 
were employed by PRTC"")."
1001,16," PRTC's paragraph 13 originally stated: ""Ninety seven days passed while the TRB and [OGE] considered and rejected 
OneLink's motion [**20]  to recuse."" PSAMF ¶ 13 (citing record support contained in its paragraphs 8 through 12). OneLink 
denied the paragraph in its entirety, arguing that its Motion to Recuse was never before the OGE, and PRTC has presented no 
evidence establishing that the Motion to Recuse was being ""considered"" by the TRB during this ninety seven-day time period, or 
that it delayed consideration of the franchise application in any way. DRPSAMF ¶ 13. The Court agrees with OneLink that the 
record evidence does not support a finding that the OGE was considering the Motion to Recuse; it was considering an inquiry 
from President Torres in her capacity as President and Associate Member of the TRB. However, the Court concludes that the 
evidence establishes, at the very least, that the motion was filed for the TRB's consideration, regardless of whether the TRB 
actually considered it. The motion was filed with the TRB. In addition, by the Court's count, ninety-seven days passed between 
the time that the Motion to Recuse was filed and the franchise application hearing was held. The Court adjusted PRTC's 
paragraph 13, and sustains in part and overrules in part OneLink's denial."
1001,17," In its opposing statement of material facts filed under seal, PRTC admitted OneLink's paragraph 10 but also interposed a 
qualified response, asserting that ""OneLink paid for half of the costs of an October 27, 2011 complaint before the TRB filed by 
Puerto Rico Cable Acquisition Corp. d/b/a Choice Cable T.V. against PRTC."" PRDSMF ¶ 10 (ECF No. 219) (Ex Parte) (citing 
Carson Decl. Attach. 1 Ex. 5; id., Ex. 6). Exhibit 5 was filed under seal. Notice of Filing Exs. Attach. 2 Ex. 5 Doc. Filed Under 
Seal (ECF No. 220) (Frix and Dorchester Email). It is an email communication between Dana Frix—counsel for OneLink in this 
litigation—and Ron Dorchester of OneLink. Id. at 2. In relevant part, the communication states: "
1002,," Please recall that in October OneLink and Choice [Cable T.V.] agreed to split the cost of filing a complaint before the TRB. . 
. . Please note [**22]  that the amount of that invoice reflects only the amount due by OneLink. The other half is being billed 
directly to Choice. For your convenience we are providing complete billing detail even though OneLink is responsible only 
for half. Please also recall that OneLink and Choice are both plaintiffs in a federal complaint against the TRB and that the 
companies have agreed to split charges for that complaint. . . . The amount shown on that invoice is due by OneLink. 
Please note that for your convenience we are providing complete billing detail even though OneLink is responsible only for 
half. Id. Exhibit 6 is a verified complaint and request for emergency relief filed with the TRB by Choice Cable T.V. against PRTC and 
several other respondents. Carson Decl. Attach. 1 Ex. 6. The complaint was filed on October 27, 2011. Id. The Court is required to draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all genuine factual disputes in favor of PRTC, ATC Realty, 
LLC v. Town of Kingston, New Hampshire, 303 F.3d 91, 94 (1st Cir. 2002), and having done so, the Court still overrules PRTC's 
qualified response because there is no evidence that the TRB is either a Puerto Rico or federal court; it is a regulatory board. Even if the TRB were deemed a ""court,"" the Court would still overrule PRTC's [**23]  qualified response for several reasons. 
First, regarding the communication between Attorney Frix and Mr. Dorchester, although they agreed to split the cost of filing a 
complaint with the TRB, there is no indication that OneLink was a party in that litigation. Second, the October 27, 2011 complaint 
only lists Choice Cable T.V. as the ""Complainant"" and does not reference OneLink in the complaint. Third, it is unclear why 
OneLink and Choice would agree to split the cost if only one party were named in the filing; however, the remainder of the 
communication is telling. It appears that Attorney Frix is referring to two cases—the October complaint with the TRB, and a 
federal complaint whereby ""OneLink and Choice are both plaintiffs"" and, as with the October complaint, they agreed to split 
costs related to the filing. It seems odd that Attorney Frix would highlight the fact that the two companies are both plaintiffs in a 
case unless they are not in another. Finally, the ""Summary of Current Invoices"" breaks down the charges as one for ""Choice 
Complaint to TRB re PRTC Illegal Construction"" and the other for ""OneLink/Choice [v]. TRB (Fed District Court)."" Frix and 
Dorchester Email at 2. For these reasons, the Court overrules [**24]  PRTC's qualified response."
1002,18," PRTC's paragraph 14 also originally included that OneLink filed suit in federal court while the TRB was considering the 
franchise agreement. PSAMF ¶ 14. OneLink denied only this part of PRTC's paragraph 14 on the basis that the evidence does 
not support the assertion. DRPSAMF ¶ 14. The Court agrees with OneLink and has removed this part of PRTC's paragraph 14."
1002,19," PRTC admitted OneLink's paragraph 11, but interposed a qualified response. First, it clarified that while OneLink stated that 
the TRB postponed approval of the franchise agreement until February 2012, DSMF ¶ 11, it was in fact postponed until January 
31, 2012. PRDSMF ¶ 11 (citing Carson Decl. Attach. 1 Ex. 7 (Stipulation)). The Court adjusted the date to January 31, 2012. Second, PRTC stated that ""OneLink extorted from the TRB an agreement to delay approval of PRTC's Franchise Application 
until at least January 31, 2012 in exchange for OneLink withdrawing its TRO request. The Stipulation also contemplated that 
after January 31, 2012, the TRB would provide OneLink ""7 days['] notice before taking any action with respect to approving a 
franchise agreement for PRTC."" Id. (citing Stipulation ¶ 3). The record evidence does not support PRTC's assertion that OneLink "
1003,," ""extorted from the TRB an agreement to delay approval"" of the franchise agreement, and OneLink's paragraph [**26]  11 
adequately explained the circumstances surrounding the settlement agreement with record citation. D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(e) 
(""Facts contained in a supporting or opposing statement of material facts, if supported by record citations as required by this 
rule, shall be deemed admitted unless properly controverted""). However, regarding the notice requirement, the Court included 
this point under the rule of completeness. FED. R. EVID. 106."
1003,20," PRTC's paragraph 16 originally stated: ""On December 2, 2011, OneLink extorted from the TRB an agreement to delay 
approval"" of the franchise agreement ""until at least January 31, 2012 in exchange for OneLink withdrawing its TRO request."" 
PSAMF ¶ 16 (citing Stipulation ¶ 3). OneLink denied extorting any such agreement, noting that PRTC has presented no 
evidence to support its assertion. DRPSAMF ¶ 16. Besides including the date whereby the Stipulation was entered into, the 
Court does not include PRTC's paragraph 16 for reasons previously discussed. See note 19, supra."
1003,21," PRTC's paragraph 18 originally stated: ""By then, sixty-three days passed."" PSAMF ¶ 18 (citing record evidence contained in 
its paragraphs 14 through 17). OneLink denied the paragraph on the basis that it is ""impossible to admit"" without knowing when 
sixty-three days had passed. DRPSAMF ¶ 18. The Court overrules the denial. It is obvious that, while not explicit, PRTC is 
referring to the period between November 29, 2011, when OneLink filed suit in federal court, and February 1, 2012, when the 
TRB approved the franchise agreement. Even OneLink recognized this in its denial while simultaneously claiming that the 
paragraph was ""impossible to admit."" Id. The Court altered PRTC's paragraph 18 slightly to indicate the dates of the referenced 
time period."
1003,22," PRTC's paragraph 19 originally began by stating that ""[w]hile the TRB approved PRTC's franchise agreement on February 1, 
2012 . . ."" PSAMF ¶ 19. OneLink denied the paragraph in its entirety, first by arguing that if PRTC is intending to imply that the 
referenced filings had an effect on approval of the franchise application or agreement, or delayed PRTC's ability to start its video 
service business, PRTC has presented no evidence to support the assertion. DRPSAMF ¶ 19. The Court has not read in any 
such implication in its recitation of facts, and overrules this part of OneLink's denial. Second, OneLink contends that, of the four filings referenced by PRTC, one of them was filed before approval of the franchise 
agreement, [**29]  and the other three filings were made ""in opposition to the TRB's approval of PRTC's franchise agreement, 
which by then had already been approved."" Id. The Court agrees that the first referenced filing was made on November 15, 2011 
(i.e., before the franchise agreement was approved), and thus, does not support PRTC's paragraph 19. See Carson Decl. 
Attach. 4 Ex. 30. However, the other three filings were made after approval of PRTC's franchise agreement, and OneLink does 
not dispute this. At the same time, OneLink appears to agree with the Court's finding in its own denial. The Court replaced the 
word ""while"" with ""after"" in the beginning of PRTC's paragraph 19 for clarity."
1003,23," OneLink's paragraph 12 originally stated: ""Since February 8, 2012, PRTC has held a valid video franchise and been free to 
build and operate a video network in Puerto Rico."" DSMF ¶ 12. PRTC denied this statement, asserting that although its franchise 
agreement was approved on February 1, 2012: "
1004,," OneLink continued to file and prosecute numerous motions and petitions related to PRTC's franchise after the February 
2012 approval. Those motions were separately addressed and dismissed in the TRB's April 4, 2012 Order, declaring [**30]  
that ""PRTC is authorized to operate its video service throughout the entire Island of Puerto Rico using an Internet Protocol 
technology platform known as ""Claro TV."" PRDSMF ¶ 12 (citing Carson Decl. Attach. 2 Ex. 8 (Decision and Order)). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to PRTC, the Court included in the recitation of the facts that (1) the TRB 
approved the franchise agreement on February 1, 2012; (2) OneLink continued to argue motions and petitions after this date, 
see Decision and Order at 1-4 (which allows for a reasonable inference that, contrary to OneLink's assertion, PRTC was not 
""free to build and operate a video network in Puerto Rico"" following approval of the franchise agreement); and (3) that the April 
4, 2012 decision by the TRB declared PRTC's right to operate its video service using the name, ""Claro TV."" Id. at 18."
1004,24," PRTC's paragraph 20 originally stated: ""On April 4, 2012[,] the TRB ruled on OneLink's numerous motions relating to PRTC's 
franchise and found it necessary to clarify that 'PRTC is authorized to operate its video services through-out the Island of Puerto 
Rico.'"" PSAMF ¶ 20. OneLink denied the paragraph to the extent it asserts that the TRB ""found it necessary [**31]  to clarify"" any 
prior orders or decisions relating to PRTC's franchise application or agreement, arguing that PRTC has presented no evidence 
to support its assertion. DRPSAMF ¶ 20. The Court agrees with OneLink and removed this phrase from PRTC's paragraph 20, 
and deems the paragraph, as altered, admitted."
1004,25," PRTC's paragraphs 21 through 27 contain numerous quotations from legal memoranda and orders written by the TRB. The 
Court has summarized PSAMF ¶¶ 21-27 in the record. For example, in its paragraph 21, PRTC stated: On October 20, 2009, in its Response to OneLink's appeal on its Motion for Injunction and Declaration Judgment, the TRB 
stated to the Court of Appeals that: 'This case constitutes the most recent episode in a prolonged campaign abusing the 
judicial appeals process initiated by [OneLink] in order to prevent the [TRB] from exercising its statutory prerogative of 
evaluating a cable-TV franchise application and attempting to keep [PRTC] from submitting an application before the [TRB] 
for the concession of such a franchise.' PSAMF ¶ 21 (citing and quoting Carson Decl. Attach. 5 Ex. 34). PRTC provided additional quotations as statements of material 
fact from various legal memoranda filed by the TRB in its paragraphs 22, 23, 26, and 27. Id. ¶¶ 22-23, 26-27. Similarly, in its paragraph 24, PRTC stated: On April 4, 2012, in its Decision and Order, the TRB stated: ""For the record, [the TRB] want[ed] to formally list all [11] legal 
proceedings and other challenges that OneLink [**33]  has lodged to no effect. . . . [OneLink's] theories have failed in a 
variety of forums where they have been filed because, simply, they are unsupported by law, from substantive and 
procedural points of view."" Id. ¶ 24 (citing and quoting Decision and Order). PRTC provided additional quotations as statements of material fact from the 
TRB's August 8, 2012 Resolution and Order in its paragraph 25. Id. ¶ 25. OneLink objected on a number of bases to these paragraphs. First, it argues that ""[t]o the extent these statements are intended 
to address legal causation, that is a legal issue, and none of these statements is relevant or material to it"" or, in the alternative, if 
not intended to address legal causation, then they are irrelevant and immaterial. DRPSAMF ¶ 21. Second, it contends that the 
quotations in these paragraphs are all out-of-court statements being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, and thus, 
constitutes inadmissible hearsay for which there are no exceptions. Id. Rule 56 allows OneLink to ""object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be 
admissible in evidence."" FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c)(2). Thus, ""inadmissible evidence may not be considered"" for summary [**34] "
1005,," judgment. Horta v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 2, 8 (1st Cir. 1993); see also Asociacion De Periodistas De P.R. v. Mueller, 680 F.3d 70, 78-
79 (1st Cir. 2012) (explaining that only admissible evidence and evidence that could be used at trial may be considered for 
summary judgment). At oral argument OneLink agreed with the Court that the TRB's orders and decisions, as well as its reasoning in reaching those 
decisions, were admissible evidence. Tr. at 81-82. Additionally, OneLink agreed that findings and determinations by the TRB, 
such as that OneLink's status as an intervenor was a ""tough"" or ""novel"" legal issue, can be considered by this Court. Id. at 83-
84. As applied to the TRB's order and the judicial opinions in this case, this is most certainly correct. See FED. R. EVID. 
803(8)(A); Olsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d 52, 63 (1st Cir. 1999). However, the Court agrees with OneLink that the statements made by the TRB quoted in PSAMF ¶¶ 21-23, 26-27 are 
inadmissible hearsay if offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Once the TRB stepped out of its role as adjudicator and into a 
role as advocate, its written arguments are not admissible for their truth under Rule 803(8)(A). Nevertheless, it is the Court's determination that these statements are admissible to show OneLink's knowledge that the TRB 
believed that OneLink's petitioning was abusing the judicial process with the intent to delay PRTC's franchise application 
approval [**35]  in order to preserve its monopoly. See PSAMF ¶¶ 21-23, 26-27. But, as the TRB's statements are not admitted 
for the truth of the matter asserted, the statements are not relevant or material to the issue of causation, and the Court does not 
consider the statements when addressing causation. Finally, as the Court observed, the TRB's agency findings and orders in PSAMF ¶¶ 24-25 are admissible for the truth of the 
matters under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(A). See Davignon v. Hodgson, 524 F.3d 91, 112-13 (1st Cir. 2008) (affirming the 
trial court decision to admit a state labor commission's decision). Here, the TRB's adjudicatory view of the merits of OneLink's 
litigation is an appropriate factor for this Court to consider. Waugh Chapel S., LLC v. United Food & Commercial Workers Union 
Local 27, 728 F.3d 354, 366 (4th Cir. 2013) (noting that ""a state court's appraisal of the merits of litigation aids the sham 
exception inquiry""). But as the Waugh Chapel Court pointed out, the state resolution of the merits of litigation under state law is a 
different issue than the federal question of a litigant's First Amendment right to petition the courts and ""[i]t would make little 
sense to cede that federal question to state law proceedings that involve issues that are distinct from our inquiry under California 
Motor."" Id. Likewise, the TRB's conclusions that OneLink's actions constituted abuse of the judicial [**36]  process and were 
unsupported by law are unpersuasive, as they were made without the guidance of PRE or California Motor Transport. See 
Section IV(C)(2), infra. The Court gives little weight to these statements when addressing causation. See Section IV(C)(3)(iv), 
infra."
1005,26," PRTC's paragraph 28 originally stated: ""PRTC spent over $3.2 million to defend the sham petitions and lawsuits and incurred 
additional costs in consultants, lawyers and management time during the elongated approval process."" PSAMF ¶ 28. OneLink 
admitted PRTC's paragraph 28 only as regards the total amount of money PRTC spent, but otherwise denied the paragraph. 
DRPSAMF ¶ 28. The Court sustains in part OneLink's denial as regards PRTC's use of the words ""sham"" and ""elongated,"" as 
these key words are argument rather than fact, and the Court has not included them. The Court denies in part OneLink's denial 
as regards PRTC's additional costs during the approval process because the evidence cited by PRTC supports its assertion. 
See Notice of Filing Exs.Attach. 8 Ex. 41 at 3-4. "
1007,27," OneLink notes that PRTC alleged in its Amended Complaint that OneLink ""literally hijacked"" a September 2008 hearing by its 
attendance, and OneLink counters that ""the allegation is not (and could not plausibly be) that OneLink's appearance at a single 
hearing . . . at the TRB's invitation . . . delayed any approval of PRTC's application."" Def.'s Mot. at 18 (internal citations omitted). "
1016,28," ""The same philosophy [of attempts to influence the legislative or executive branch of government] governs the approach of 
citizens or groups of them to administrative agencies (which are both creatures of the legislature, and arms of the executive) and 
to courts, the third branch of Government. Certainly the right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right 
of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition."" California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 
404 U.S. 508, 510, 92 S. Ct. 609, 30 L. Ed. 2d 642 (1972)."
1016,29," As described by one district court, ""when a court of law is the object of the challenged petitioning, the sham exception is given 
a much broader compass."" Livingston Downs Racing Ass'n Inc. v. Jefferson Downs Corp., 192 F. Supp. 2d 519, 532 (M.D. La. 
2001). "
1018,30," In Judge Gelpi's August 10, 2012 Order, the Court observed that it ""will follow the lead of the Second and Ninth Circuits that 
have also read these cases together and held the objectively baseless requirement not to apply to allegations of a pattern of 
proceedings. [**77]  First Opinion and Order at 4. Judge Gelpi made a similar comment in the Court's September 13, 2012 
Order. Second Opinion and Order at 3 (""The Second and Ninth Circuits have held [the PRE two-part definition of sham] applies 
when determining if one action constitutes a sham, but does not apply when the challenged proceedings constitute a pattern of 
repetitive litigation""). These Orders predate Waugh Chapel, 728 F.3d 354 (decided Aug. 26, 2013) and Hanover, 806 F.3d 162 
(decided Nov. 12, 2015). The Waugh Chapel and Hanover Courts held that when applying California Motor Transport that the 
subjective motive of the litigant and the objective merits of the suits are relevant to pattern sham litigation. Waugh Chapel, 728 
F.3d at 364; Hanover, 806 F.3d at 180. This Court adopts the approach of the Third and Fourth Circuits and incorporates the 
subjective motive of the litigant and the objective merits of the suits into its pattern sham litigation analysis. "
1020,31," OneLink urged the Puerto Rican courts and regulatory board to take allegedly anticompetitive action. As the First Circuit 
explained [**84]  in George R. Whitten, this action is analyzed under Noerr-Pennington, not Parker. George R. Whitten, 424 F.2d 
at 30-32. "
1023,32," The Court recognizes that the $3.2 million figure is a total, including the period during which the matters were stayed. The 
Court also acknowledges that the two parties before the Court are arms of successful parent corporations. Nevertheless, there is 
no gainsaying that the litigation OneLink generated in this matter has been inordinately expensive for PRTC by any measure. "
1036,1, In this Order when citing to [**7]  the record the Court refers to the redacted version of all filings.
1036,2," Where, as here, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, the Court must evaluate each motion independently and 
""determine whether either of the parties deserves judgment as a matter of law on facts that are not disputed."" Matusevich v. 
Middlesex Mut. Assur. Co., 782 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 2015) (citing Barnes v. Fleet Nat'l Bank, N A., 370 F.3d 164, 170 (1st Cir. 
2004)). For cross-motions for summary judgment the standard of review is applied to each motion separately. Libertarian Party 
of New Hampshire v. Gardner, 759 F. Supp. 2d 215, 221 (D.N.H. 2010) aff'd, 638 F.3d 6 (1st Cir. 2011). Thus, in accordance 
with ""the conventional summary judgment praxis,"" in regards to PRTC's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 246) and its 
supporting facts (ECF No. 247), the Court recounts the facts in the light most hospitable to OneLink's [**8]  case theories 
consistent with record support. Gillen v. Fallon Ambulance Serv., Inc., 283 F.3d 11, 17 (1st Cir. 2002). In compliance with this 
obligation, the Court recites supported facts as true even if PRTC disputes them. Id. Likewise, with OneLink's cross-motion for 
summary judgment (ECF No. 261) and its supporting facts (ECF No. 263), the Court recounts the facts in the light most 
hospitable to PRTC's case theories consistent with record support and recites supported facts as true even if OneLink disputes 
them. Id."
1036,3," PRTC's statements of material fact 40 and 63, and additional statement of material fact 34, are statements based on expert 
opinions of Puerto Rico law. PSMF ¶¶ 40, 63; PSAMF ¶ 34. The First Circuit has explicitly held that such testimony is prohibited, 
subject to exceptions not applicable here. Nieves-Villanueva v. Soto-Rivera, 133 F.3d 92, 99 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing United States 
v. Newman, 49 F.3d 1, 7) (1st Cir. 1995)). ""[I]t is not for witnesses to instruct the jury as to applicable principles of law, but for the 
judge."" Id. ""[T]he judge's expert knowledge of the law makes any such assistance at best cumulative, and at worst prejudicial."" 
Id. at 100. Moreover, ""inadmissible evidence may not be considered"" for summary judgment. Horta v. Sullivan, 4 F.3d 2, 8 (1st 
Cir. 1993); see also Asociacion De Periodistas De P.R. v. Mueller, 680 F.3d 70, 78-79 (1st Cir. 2012) (explaining that only 
admissible evidence and evidence that could be used at trial may be considered for summary judgment). As such, [**9]  PSMF 
¶¶ 40, 63 and PSAMF ¶ 34 are inadmissible and excluded from the record. "
1037,4," PRTC's paragraph 33 initially prefaced its statement with ""Here, OneLink admitted to the TRB that it lacked standing to 
intervene."" PSMF ¶ 33. OneLink objected to this language, maintaining that the statement was an argument and legal 
conclusion, not a fact. DRPSMF ¶33. The Court agrees that the first sentence of paragraph 33 is conclusory argument not 
properly presented in a statement of material facts. Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990) 
(""the nonmoving party [may not] rest[] merely upon conclusory allegations""). The Court alters the record to present only 
uncontested fact. Likewise, PRTC's paragraphs 43 and 69 are arguments not properly presented in a statement of material facts 
and are also excluded from the record. PSMF ¶¶ 43, 69."
1037,5," In his deposition, when asked ""You don't know whether you would have gotten access or not [to confidential documents] as a 
result of being an intervenor?"" Mr. Khoury, OneLink's Rule 30(b)(6) witness, replied ""No, I don't."" Khoury Dep. Attach. 4, 19:15-
18 (Carson Decl. Ex. 41) (ECF No. 250) (Khoury Dep.). OneLink denied this statement [**11]  as unsupported. DRPSAMF ¶ 33. 
Citing the record evidence, OneLink argues that Mr. Khoury stated that access to those records was a motivational factor for 
requesting intervenor status, and also refers to TRB regulations regarding service of process of documents to support that 
OneLink would have received those documents had it been an party. Khoury Dep. 19:1-5 (Carson Decl. Ex. 41); TRB Regulation 
5664, § 5.3(a) (eff. prior to Nov. 2010) (Carson Decl. Ex. 12) (ECF No. 248); TRB Regulation 7848, § 7.3 (eff. Nov. 2010) 
(Carson Decl. Ex. 13) (ECF No. 248). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court determines that 
OneLink did not know whether it would receive confidential documents submitted by PRTC had OneLink been afforded 
intervenor status."
1037,6," PRTC's paragraph 26 stated: ""OneLink admits that had it succeeded in its efforts to intervene, it would have gained no rights 
vis-à-vis the franchise proceedings that it did not enjoy without intervenor status."" PSFM ¶ 26. OneLink objected to this 
statement, contenting it is ""an argument and legal conclusion, not a fact."" DRPSMF ¶ 26. The Court agrees. Medina, 896 F.2d at 
8 (""the nonmoving party [may not] rest[] merely upon conclusory allegations""). Furthermore, [**12]  even if ""fact,"" PRTC's record 
evidence does not support the assertion. While in his deposition Mr. Khoury could not identify all procedural rights afforded to an 
intervener before the TRB, he did testify to certain rights OneLink would have gained from intervener status. Khoury Dep. at 
18:19-21:13; 39:18-42:2 (Carson Decl. Ex. 41); Khoury Dep. Attach 3, 19:1-5; 20:18-21:35; 38:1-14; 103:10-14 (Grube Decl. Ex. 
35) (ECF No. 264). As such, the Court excludes paragraph 26 from the record. Likewise, regarding the issue of intervener status 
and OneLink's ability to participate in the franchise proceedings, PRTC's statement of material fact paragraphs 27, 29-30, 65-67, 
and 71-72, and statement of additional material fact paragraphs 19, 21 and 32, are arguments not properly presented in a 
statement of material facts, Medina, 896 F.2d at 8, and are excluded from the record. See PSFM ¶¶ 27, 29-30, 65-67, 71-72; 
PSAMF ¶¶ 19, 21, 32. Moreover, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, OneLink identifies a number of rights it would have been 
afforded had it participated in the franchise proceedings as an intervenor, including: (1) the right to notice of the TRB's orders or 
proceedings; (2) the ability [**13]  to immediately file a motion to reconsider if the franchise was approved; (3) the right to cross-
examine PRTC's witnesses; and (4) the obligation for the TRB to act on OneLink's motions as a formal party. DRPSMF ¶ 26-27; 
see Khoury Dep. 19:1-5; 20:18-21:35; 38:1-14; 103:10-14 (Grube Decl. Ex. 35); see also In re Application of Coqui.net, JRT-

536, Op. at 9-11, Aug. 30, 2012 (Carson Decl. Ex. 124) (ECF No. 248). The right of access to confidential documents as an 
intervenor is addressed in footnote 5, supra."
1037,7," OneLink denied paragraph 42, contending it is an argument, not a fact. DRPSMF ¶ 42. Also, OneLink admitted that its cable 
franchise was non-exclusive, but denied its franchises were ""not at issue,"" arguing that ""OneLink, like the public at large, had a 
legitimate interest in 'fair competition.'"" Id. The Court overrules OneLink's denial. The [**14]  Court does not read PRTC's "
1038,," sentence to make the broad assertion that OneLink had no interest in the outcome of the proceedings, but rather that OneLink's 
franchise agreements themselves were not at issue in PRTC's franchise proceedings, and that OneLink's franchise agreements 
were nonexclusive."
1038,8," PRTC's paragraph 45 originally stated: ""[OneLink] submitted comments and information and cross-examined witnesses at the 
TRB hearing on Sept. 26, 2008 regarding PRTC's franchise application."" PSMF ¶ 45. OneLink denied this paragraph, arguing 
that it did not submit any comments at the September 26, 2008 hearing, and that it was given only a limited opportunity to cross-
examine two TRB witnesses, [**17]  ""subject to limitations imposed by the TRB due to OneLink's status as a non-party whose 
petition to intervene had been denied."" DRPSMF ¶ 45. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court 
concludes that OneLink provided comments, before, not at the September 26, 2008 hearing, and adjusts the record accordingly. 
However, paragraph 46 only states that OneLink crossed-examined witnesses, and though this cross-examination may have 
been only a ""limited opportunity,"" this objection does not contradict PRTC's statement, and as such is overruled."
1038,9," PRTC's paragraph 31 originally stated: ""Misdirected by OneLink's baseless interference, TRB denied PRTC's first application 
on Oct. 29, 2008."" PSMF ¶ 47. OneLink denied this statement, arguing that there is no evidence that any of its actions or 
representations before the TRB were misleading or baseless, and lists a number of reasons the TRB stated for denying PRTC's 
application. DRPSMF ¶ 47. The Court affirms OneLink's denial and alters the record to include the TRB's reasoning for denying 
PRTC's first franchise application. "
1039,10," PRTC admitted that the TRB did not seek public comment of its order granting PRTC the STA, but denied that the TRB did not 
provide public notice of this Order and cites OneLink's January 13, 2009 Motion for Intervention in support of its denial. PRDSMF 
¶ 13; Jan. 13, 2009 OneLink Motion to Intervene and Request for Proceedings at 2 (Carson Decl. Ex. [**19]  61) (ECF No. 248). 
OneLink cited the TRB's December 17, 2008 Resolution and Order to support its contention. DSMF ¶ 13; In re: PRTC h/n/c 
ClaroTV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002, Dec. 17, 2008 Resolution & Order (Grube Decl. Ex. 4) (ECF No. 264). Considering the evidence 
in the light most hospitable to PRTC, the Court finds that PRTC has proffered no evidence that the TRB provided public notice 
on its December 17, 2008 Resolution and Order. Indeed, the Order makes no reference to public notice, and lists only PRTC's 
counsel in its service notice. Id. Additionally, OneLink's January 13, 2009 Motion for Intervention argues that the TRB issued its 
Resolution and Order ""without providing an opportunity for public notice or comment or holding public hearings on any of the 
documents submitted by PRTC."" Jan. 13, 2009 OneLink Motion to Intervene and Request for Proceedings at 2 (Carson Decl. 
Ex. 61) (ECF No. 248). However, OneLink has provided no evidence that the TRB did not provide public notice; it only illustrated 
that it was not served notice with the issuance of the December 17, 2008 Resolution and Order. The Court adjusts the record to 
show that OneLink was not served notice of the Order and Resolution, [**20]  but removes the contention that no public notice 
was given."
1039,11," PRTC admitted that the TRB did not seek public comment of the order granting expedited review of PRTC's December 2008 
application but denied that the TRB did not provide public notice of this order. DRPSMF ¶ 14; Feb. 25, 2009 Request for 
Mandamus at 6 (Carson Decl. Ex. 63) (ECF No. 248). Again, as in footnote 10, supra, PRTC has proffered no evidence that the 
TRB provided public notice, but also again OneLink has provided no evidence that the TRB did not provide public notice; 
OneLink only showed that it was not served notice. See In re: PRTC h/n/c ClaroTV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002, Dec. 30, 2008 
Resolution & Order (Grube Decl. in Supp. of Def. Mot. for Summ. J. Ex. J) (ECF No. 200-4). Again, the Court adjusts the record 
to show that OneLink was not served notice of the Order and Resolution, but removes the contention that no public notice was 
given."
1039,12," PRTC's paragraph 49 originally stated: ""Despite OneLink's belief that it would [**22]  be accorded the same rights to 
participate as it had been in the first proceeding without intervenor status, on January 13, 2009, OneLink again filed a Motion to 
Intervene."" PSMF ¶ 49. OneLink admitted that it filed a motion to intervene on January 13, 2009, but it denied the rest of the 
statement, contending it is ""an argument and legal conclusion, not a fact."" DRPSMF ¶ 49. The Court agrees. Medina, 896 F.2d 
at 8. For the same reasons in denying PSMF ¶ 26, footnote 6, supra, the Court admits in part and excludes in part paragraph 49."
1039,13," Regarding OneLink's January 13, 2009 motion to intervene, PRTC's paragraph 70 originally stated: Rather, OneLink attempted to end-run the confessedly clear language of the APA by purporting to rely on a case decided 
long before even its first intervention petition. OneLink mischaracterized the holding in San Antonio Maritime as supporting 
its assertion that intervention was appropriate during franchise proceedings even though, as OneLink itself noted, the 
intervention section in the Adjudicative Procedures subchapter of the APA ""makes explicit reference only to adjudicative 
proceedings."" "
1040,," PSMF ¶ 70. OneLink denied the paragraph, asserting the statement is an argument and legal [**23]  conclusion, not a fact, and 
improper under District of Puerto Rico Local Rule 56(b). The Court agrees, Medina, 896 F.2d at 8, and excludes paragraph 70 
from the record."
1040,14," PRTC's paragraph 50 originally stated: ""In reaction to OneLink's Motion to Intervene, on January 21, 2009, the Board vacated 
the February 11-13, 2009 hearing dates, and reset them for March 4-6, 2009."" PSMF ¶ 50. In response, OneLink denied the 
paragraph in its entirety, arguing that the hearing dates were reset for March as a result of PRTC's motions to restrict access to 
certain exhibits, and furthermore, that PRTC ""has proffered no admissible evidence establishing or supporting a reasonable 
inference"" that the hearing dates were moved ""in response or reaction to any OneLink filing."" DRPSMF ¶ 50. Both parties cite 
the same record evidence in support of their assertions. Jan. 21, 2009 Resolution & Order at 1-2, P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, 
JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 62) (ECF No. 248). A review of the January 21, 2009 Resolution and Order reveals that the hearing was postponed as a result of both PRTC's 
motions and OneLink's motion. The TRB gave PRTC ten days to answer the Motion to Intervene, appeared to grant part or 
perhaps all of PRTC's motions [**24]  for protection, and then declared, ""[i]n consideration of the foregoing, it is necessary to 
update the docket,"" including rescheduling the hearing dates. Id. at 1-2. The Court included in the record that the filings of these 
motions impacted the hearing dates, and it otherwise overrules OneLink's denial."
1040,15," PRTC's paragraph 154 originally stated: ""The TRB had, in fact, taken action on OneLink's intervention motion. On January 21, 
2009, for instance, the TRB issued an order requesting that PRTC respond to OneLink's."" PSMF ¶ 154. OneLink denied this 
paragraph, arguing that ""the TRB did not take up OneLink's intervention motion until March 2, 2009, and in doing so, on that 
date, the TRB stated that it had planned to wait longer before denying OneLink's motion, but was forced to act because of 
OneLink's mandamus petition."" DRPSMF ¶ 154. Reviewing this evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court 
sustains its denial and adjusts the record to reflect PRTC's and the TRB's actual response to OneLink's January 13, 2009 Motion 
to Intervene. See Mar. 2, 2009 Resolution & Order at 2, P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 
64) (ECF 248)."
1040,16," PRTC's paragraph 51 originally stated: [**25]  ""When the TRB did not rule on its intervention request, OneLink sued the TRB 
in the Court of First Instance for mandamus on February 25, 2009."" PSMF ¶ 51. OneLink provided a qualified admission to 
paragraph 51, stating: OneLink admits that, on February 25, 2009—one week prior to a scheduled public hearing on PRTC submitted its second 
franchise application—OneLink brought a mandamus action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance seeking to compel 
the TRB to rule—either way—on the motion to intervene that OneLink had filed with the TRB on January 13, 2009, shortly 
after PRTC submitted the application. DRPSMF ¶ 51 (emphasis provided). The underlined portion of this paragraph as proposed is garbled. The Court has revised the 
paragraph as follows: OneLink admits that, on February 25, 2009—one week prior to a scheduled public hearing on PRTC's second franchise 
application—OneLink brought a mandamus action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance seeking to compel the TRB to 
rule-either way—on the motion to intervene that OneLink had filed with the TRB on January 13, 2009, shortly after PRTC 
submitted the application. "
1041,," Similar to paragraph 51, PRTC's paragraph 152 originally stated: On February [**26]  25, 2009, OneLink filed a mandamus petition with the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, requesting 
that the court order the TRB to resolve its January 13, 2009 Motion to Intervene. OneLink based this request on the fact 
that the TRB had ""not taken any action regarding"" its intervention motion and had ""refused to consider"" its motion. PSMF ¶152. OneLink denied paragraph 152, explaining: [OneLink] denies PRTC's characterization of OneLink's bases for that petition. OneLink's petition was necessary to respond 
to the TRB's statement that it would decide OneLink's intervention motion on the same day as the hearing that the TRB had 
scheduled on PRTC's franchise application, which would have afforded OneLink no ability to access documents and 
adequately prepare to participate in the hearing. DRPSMF ¶ 152. Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court affirms OneLink's qualification to 
PRTC's paragraph 51 and sustains its denial of paragraph 152. The record indicates that the TRB had not yet ruled on 
OneLink's Motion to Intervene as of one week before the scheduled franchise application hearings, as well that OneLink's 
purported reasoning for seeking mandamus was [**27]  based on more than just the fact that the TRB had ""not taken any action 
regarding"" its intervention motion and had ""refused to consider"" its motion. Feb. 25, 2009 Req. for Mandamus at 4-6, San Juan 
Cable LLC d/b/a OneLink Commc'ns v. TRB, KPE-09-0600 (904) (Carson Decl. Ex. 63) (ECF 248); Feb. 19, 2009 Resolution & 
Order at 1, P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 116) (ECF 248). The Court expands the record 
to support OneLink's qualification and denial."
1041,17," PRTC's paragraph 52 originally stated: ""On March 2, 2009, TRB issued an order denying intervention, and explaining that 
OneLink had been ""mendacious"" (i.e., repeatedly lying) in its representations to the Puerto Rico court."" PSMF ¶ 52. OneLink 
denied paragraph 52 as ""vague, conclusory and an unsupported [**29]  opinion, not a fact, and should be disregarded."" 
DRPSMF ¶ 52. The Court addresses the statement by the TRB that OneLink had been ""mendacious"" in footnote 115, infra."
1041,18," Onelink denied PRTC's original paragraph 53, arguing OneLink was not allowed to participate in the TRB proceedings on 
PRTC's first franchise application to the same extent that a party would have been able to participate, and denying that it did not 
offer ""expert information or specialized knowledge"" that aided the TRB in PRTC's first franchise application. DRPSMF ¶53. These objections do not respond directly to PRTC's paragraph 53. However, to provide better context for the TRB's reasoning 
for denying OneLink's intervention request, the Court provides the full statement cited by PRTC. Mar. 2, 2009 Resolution & 
Order at 2, 4, P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 64) (ECF No. 248). Additionally, this expansion of the record in part addresses OneLink's denial of PRTC's paragraph 154, see footnote 15, supra, 
while also addressing PRTC's objection to OneLink's paragraph 16. DSMF ¶ 16. Specifically, OneLink's paragraph 16 stated: 
""The TRB did not rule on OneLink's 'Motion to Intervene and Request for [**30]  Proceedings' until after OneLink filed an action 
in Puerto Rico state court, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the TRB to address that motion."" Id. PRTC denied the 
statement, arguing that the TRB ""did 'rule' on OneLink's intervention motion, setting a hearing date for this motion and inviting "
1042,," PRTC to respond to the motion."" PRDSMF ¶ 16. PRTC's functional definition of ""rule"" — setting a hearing date for this motion 
and inviting PRTC to respond to the motion — is unpersuasive. When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to PRTC, 
the Court overrules PRTC's denial for reasons similar to those discussed in this footnote and footnote 15, supra."
1042,19," OneLink admits that during the franchise proceedings that the TRB never rejected any OneLink submission, but denies that 
the TRB timely responded (or responded at all) to all of its submissions. DRPSMF ¶ 34. For example, OneLink contends the 
TRB failed to rule on its January 13, 2009 motion to intervene in the proceedings on PRTC's second franchise application for 
over a month. Id. OneLink asserts it was thus forced to file a mandamus action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance to 
compel the TRB to rule on OneLink's request for [**31]  intervention. Id. OneLink also notes that it filed a motion for an order to 
show cause with the TRB on April 7, 2009, alleging that PRTC had engaged in unlawful pre-franchise construction of its cable 
network, but contend the TRB never addressed OneLink's motion. Id.; Jan. 13, 2009 OneLink Motion to Intervene and Request 
for Proceedings, In re: P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 61) (ECF No. 248); Feb. 25, 2009 
Req. for Mandamus at 7, San Juan Cable LLC d/b/a OneLink Commc'ns v. TRB, KPE-09-0600 (Carson Decl. Ex. 63) (ECF No. 
248); Apr. 7, 2009 Em. Mot. For Order to Show Cause, In re: Investigation into P.R. Tel. Co.'s Development, Construction and 
Operation of a Cable System in Violation of Law 213, JRT-2009-CCG-0001 (Carson Decl. Ex. 68) (ECF No. 248). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court accepts OneLink's qualification to paragraph 28 and 
alters the record to reflect that the TRB did not respond to all of OneLink's submissions."
1042,20," PRTC's paragraph 46 states: ""OneLink admits that the TRB never refused to accept any OneLink submission and that it was 
able to voice all of its concerns to the TRB."" PSMF ¶ 46. OneLink qualified [**32]  paragraph 46 using the same arguments it 
provided for paragraphs 26, footnote 6, supra, and 28, footnote 19, supra. For the reasons provided in footnotes 6 and 19, the 
Court affirms in part and denies in part paragraph 46, as outlined in the amended record for PSMF ¶ 28."
1042,21," PRTC's paragraph 54 originally stated: ""Despite having nothing to gain (but delay), OneLink appealed the TRB's second 
rejection of OneLink's second request for intervention to the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals, on no basis — according to 
OneLink's (30)(b)(6) witness on sham litigation — other than that it ""was the next forum available."" PSMF ¶ 54. OneLink [**34]  
denied paragraph as argument and legal conclusion, not fact, and therefore improper under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b). DRPSMF ¶ 
54. The Court agrees and amends the record accordingly. The Court also amends the record to reflect OneLink's objection to 
PRTC's assertion that the March 2, 2009 order was a ""second rejection"" of OneLink's January 13, 2009 motion to intervene. Id."
1042,22," OneLink objected to the use of the term ""at the same time"" as being vague, and denied that paragraph 55 had a discernable 
relationship to those that preceded it. DRPSMF ¶ 55. The Court adjusted the record slightly to accommodate this objection. "
1043,23," OneLink denied PRTC's original paragraph 56 on grounds that PRTC was not providing the full context of the TRB decision. 
DRPSMF ¶ 56. The Court has expanded on the record to address OneLink's concerns."
1043,24," OneLink denied PRTC's original paragraph 57, objecting to its connotations that its motions ""delayed or otherwise affected the 
pace of the TRB's consideration of PRTC's franchise application."" DRPSMF ¶ 57. Reviewing the evidence in the light most 
hospitable to OneLink, the record does not support a finding that these petitions slowed down the application review process. 
The Court adjusts the record accordingly. [**36]"
1043,25," PRTC's paragraph 6 originally stated: ""In addition to the eighteen petitions identified in PRTC's motion for partial summary 
judgment, OneLink also sought to impose costs and delay on PRTC's application process with six additional requests for relief, 
all of which were either rejected or ignored by the TRB."" PSAMF ¶ 6. OneLink denied the paragraph as unsupported. DRPSAMF 
¶ 6. The Court finds that PRTC's contention that OneLink ""also sought to impose cost and delay"" is argument not appropriate for 
summary judgment. D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b). As such, the Court combines PSAMF ¶ 6 with PSMF ¶ 57, and adds those petitions 
cited by PRTC that are not already referenced in PSMF ¶ 57. The sixth petition cited by PRTC is added to the appropriate 
section of the record. PSAMF ¶ 6, footnote 41, infra. August 1, 2011 Urgent Mot. of OneLink Requesting Access to Docs. and 
Opportunity to Prepare for Hr'g (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 4) (ECF No. 272)."
1043,26," PRTC's paragraph 58 stated: Based on nothing more than an alleged belief that the TRB ""might not"" address OneLink's concerns ruling on the franchise 
application, and with no explanation of how intervenor status might effect that, OneLink appealed the Appellate Court's 
rejection of its claimed intervention to the ""the next forum available,"" this time the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. PSMF ¶ 58. OneLink denied this paragraph, asserting the statement is an argument and legal conclusion, not a fact, and is 
therefore improper and should be disregarded under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b). The [**38]  Court agrees, Medina, 896 F.2d at 8, and 
paragraph 58 is excluded from the record."
1043,27," PRTC's paragraph 31 originally stated: ""The lack of a genuine interest in redressing grievance was vividly demonstrated when 
OneLink's owners and management celebrated — proclaiming ""We Win"" and ""this is fantastic"" — after the Puerto Rico Supreme 
Court issued a procedural stay of the TRB's consideration of PRTC's franchise application in May 2009."" PSMF ¶ 31. OneLink 
denied this paragraph, insisting the statement is not fact but instead argument and legal conclusion. DRPSMF ¶ 31. The Court "
1044,," agrees the majority of the statement is argument, not properly presented in a statement of material facts, Medina, 896 F.2d at 8, 
and adjusts the record to present only uncontested facts. Additionally, PRTC's paragraph 60 cited to the same email relied upon in paragraph 31. PSMF ¶ 60. Responding to OneLink's 
objections, DRPSMF ¶ 60, the Court excludes any argument and adjusts the record to include only undisputed facts."
1044,28," PRTC's paragraph 61 originally stated: ""The Supreme Court held that ""obvious[ly]"" OneLink had no right to intervene because 
the franchise application was not an adjudicatory proceeding."" PSMF ¶ 61. OneLink denied paragraph 61, arguing the court 
""never so held or stated"" and clarified the court's holding by citing the language used in the opinion. DRPSMF ¶ 61. Moreover, 
OneLink asserted that the translation of the July 9, 2010 opinion from Spanish to English was ""incomplete and imprecise,"" 
submitted its own certified translation, and indicated that the word ""obvious"" should instead be the word ""evident."" Id. (citing 
June 9, 2010 Op. at 36-39, P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, Telecomm. Regulatory Bd. of P.R. v. San Juan Cable LLC d/b/a 
OneLink Commc'ns, CC-09-380 (Grube Decl. Ex. 15) (ECF No. 264-2). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court adopts the certified translation offered by OneLink and 
sustains OneLink's denial, altering the record to reflect the actual language from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico's holding. 
Additionally, the Court excludes PRTC's paragraph 68 from the record, for the reasons discussed in [**43]  this footnote and that 
the statement is an argument, not a fact, and is therefore improper under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b). Medina, 896 F.2d at 8. "
1045,," Additionally, in response to OneLink's cross-motion for summary judgment paragraph 32, PRTC asserts the translation reads: 
""As is obvious, the right to intervene may exist only in an adjudicative proceeding."" PRDSMF ¶ 32. In doing so, however, PRTC 
makes no assertion that their translation is more complete or precise than OneLink's. Moreover, ""evident"" is defined as ""clear to 
the vision or understanding."" Evident, MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (11th ed. 2003). ""Obvious"" is 
defined as ""easily discovered, seen, or understood."" Id. ""Evident"" is listed as the synonym for ""obvious."" Id. The Court finds no 
obvious or evident significance to this quibbling and overrules PRTC's denial of OneLink's paragraph 32."
1045,29," PRTC's paragraph 62 originally stated: ""The Court confirmed that intervention in a franchise proceeding before approval of the 
franchise is contrary to the law and the policy of the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Act."" PSMF ¶ 62. OneLink denied this 
paragraph, contending the statement was an argument and legal conclusion, not fact. DRPSMF ¶ 62. Additionally, OneLink 
denied [**44]  PRTC's assertion, claiming that this issue was a matter of first impression before the Puerto Rico Supreme Court 
and only after ""construing precedent, policy and legislative history"" did it hold that OneLink had no right to intervene. Id. Viewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court finds this statement is in part conclusory and alters 
PRTC's paragraph 62 to reflect the actual language used in the opinion to describe the court's analysis of the telecommunication 
laws and policies governing Puerto Rico and this analysis's subsequent impact on its holding. This record evidence was supplied 
by OneLink's paragraph 32. DSMF ¶ 32."
1045,30," PRTC's paragraph 64 originally stated: ""Based on nothing other than a procedural right to request reconsideration, OneLink 
twice requested reconsideration by the Supreme Court and was twice rebuffed. PSMF ¶ 64. OneLink denied the paragraph, 
contending the statement was an argument, as well as denying that it had no basis to twice request reconsideration. DRPSMF ¶ 
64. The Court agrees the assertion that the requests for reconsideration were based on ""nothing other than a procedural right"" is 
argument — not supported by the record cited by [**45]  PRTC — and accordingly adjusts the record."
1045,31," OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 140. DPRSMF ¶ 140. In its denial, OneLink admitted that the proceedings on PRTC's 
franchise application resumed on November 24, 2010, and then provided background regarding the nature and substance of the 
Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision while also asserting that OneLink was not notified by the TRB until December 21, 2010 
that the application process had resumed. Id. The denial is unresponsive and is overruled. Moreover, the TRB's November 24, 
2010 Resolution and Order states that OneLink shall be served with notice, Nov. 24, 2010 Resolution & Order at 1, P.R. Tel. Co. 
d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 126) (ECF No. 248), and OneLink has provided no evidence that it was 
not served with the order until December 21, 2010."
1045,32," PRTC's paragraph 141 originally stated: ""On January 3, 2011, PRTC supplemented its application given the two years of 
delay since its December 2008 submission."" PSMF ¶ 141. OneLink denied the statement, contending ""PRTC has proffered no 
evidence . . . that PRTC supplemented its application in response to any delay, that there in fact had been any delay, or that 
OneLink was [**46]  responsible for any such delay. PRTC supplemented its application on January 3, 2011, because the TRB 
ordered it to do so."" DRPSMF ¶ 141. Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court affirms OneLink's 
denial, and adjusts the record using PRTC's own language as to why it supplemented its franchise application. Jan. 3, 2011 
Supp. to Application for Authorization to Provide Video Service at 1, P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson 
Decl. Ex. 127) (ECF No. 248). "
1046,33," PRTC's paragraph 142 originally contended that OneLink argued in its Motion to Recuse that ""the TRB's consideration of 
PRTC's franchise must sit in abeyance until the TRB ruled on its Motion."" PSMF ¶ 142. OneLink denied the paragraph in its 
entirety, arguing that PRTC provided no evidence that the TRB was unable to set a hearing date between November 24, 2010 
and January 20, 2011, and noting that OneLink did not argue in its motion that consideration of the franchise application had to 
""sit in abeyance"" until a ruling on the Motion to Recuse. DRPSMF ¶ 142 (citing Jan. 20, 2011 OneLink Motion for Recusal of 
President Torres at 3-8, In re: P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 128) (ECF No. 248)). The 
Court overrules the denial as it pertains to the impact of the Motion to Recuse on the hearing date. The [**48]  Court interprets 
PRTC's assertion to mean that a hearing date had not been set by January 20, 2011, not that the TRB was unable to set a date 
due to the Motion to Recuse. However, the Court agrees that OneLink never argued in its motion that consideration of the 
franchise application could not occur until the TRB ruled on its motion; instead, OneLink requested that the TRB ""expunge from 
the record any information relating to President Torres' involvement to date in the Second Franchise Proceeding."" Id. at 8. The 
Court removed this section of PRTC's paragraph 142."
1046,34," OneLink's paragraph 38 stated: While the second franchise application was pending, the media reported that Commissioner Torres was ""the only one who 
has spoken openly in favor of granting the franchise to Claro"" and that ""Torres reaffirmed her intention to endorse the 
granting of the cable franchise once she has confirmed that it is a decision that will benefit consumers."" DSMF ¶ 38. PRTC objected to the statement, arguing the news article is unauthenticated hearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 802. 
PRDSMF ¶ 38. The Court agrees and excludes that statement from the record as an out-of-court declaration offered to prove the 
truth of the matter asserted. Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)."
1046,35," OneLink [**49]  admitted PRTC's paragraph 143 with the qualification that ""Commissioner Torres' former employment by, and 
receipt of a pension from, PRTC were not the only reasons that OneLink argued required her recusal from PRTC's franchise 
proceeding."" DRPSMF ¶ 143. Having reviewed the record, the Court affirms OneLink's qualification and adjusts the record to 
note there were other grounds it argued for Commissioner Torres' recusal."
1046,36," OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 145. DRPSMF ¶ 145. Specifically, OneLink admitted the language cited by PRTC was 
accurate, but also noted that the ""Ethics Office advised that President Torres 'must recuse [herself] from participating . . . in 
those cases . . . in which the PRTC appears as a party and [she] participated, directly or indirectly, while [she] w[as] an 
employee,'"" and that the Ethics Office ""did not address the statement made by Commissioner Torres to the Puerto Rico Senate 
during her confirmation proceedings that she would recuse herself from all PRTC matters."" Id. (citing Mar. 29, 2011 Ethics Op. at 
4, OPC-11-165 (Carson Decl. Ex. 129) (ECF No. 248)). This denial is unresponsive and is overruled. "
1047,37," PRTC's paragraph 146 originally stated: ""After the delay caused by OneLink's recusal motion, the Board scheduled a hearing 
on PRTC's Franchise Application for April 27, 2011."" PSMF ¶ 146. OneLink denied the statement, arguing that PRTC has 
proffered no evidence that the TRB spent time between January 20, 2011 and April 27, 2011 ""considering OneLink's motion or 
that OneLink's motion in any way delayed or otherwise affected the pace of the TRB's consideration [**51]  of PRTC's franchise 
application during that period or that the TRB was unable to set a hearing during that period."" DRPSMF ¶ 146. Viewing the 
evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court agrees that PRTC has proffered no evidence that OneLink's motion 
delayed the TRB's consideration of PRTC's franchise application. However, the Court concludes that the evidence establishes, 
at the very least, that the motion was filed for the TRB's consideration, regardless of whether the TRB actually considered it. In 
addition, by the Court's count, seventy-six days passed between the filing of the Motion to Recuse and the setting of the 
franchise application hearing. As such, the Court adjusts the record to show that the Motion to Recuse was filed for the TRB's 
consideration and that seventy-six days passed between the filing of the Motion and the Resolution and Order setting the 
hearing date on PRTC's franchise application. See Jan. 20, 2011 OneLink Motion for Recusal of President Torres at 3-8, In re: 
P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 128) (ECF 248); Apr. 6, 2011 Resolution & Order, at 1, 
P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. [**52]  Ex. 130) (ECF No. 248)."
1047,38," OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 149, asserting that Governor Pataki did not meet with Governor Fortuno for the purpose of 
""tell[ing] him"" about OneLink's concerns regarding [**53]  the TRB, but rather that the meeting was to address ""a lot of issues."" 
DRPSMF ¶ 149 (citing Pataki Dep. at 44:4-46:10 (Carson Decl. Ex. 114) (ECF No. 248) (Pataki Dep.). Viewing the evidence in 
the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court overrules its denial. The record demonstrates that Governor Pataki went to Puerto 
Rico for the ""urgent matter"" of discussing the appointment of Sandra Torres. Id. at 47:9-48:16."
1047,39," PRTC's paragraph 150 states: ""In response, Governor Fortuno 'laughed, and ... said anybody who knows anything about 
telecommunications in Puerto Rico has worked for PRTC. If I didn't have anybody from PRTC working at the TRB there wouldn't 
be anybody at the TRB.'"" PSMF ¶ 150. OneLink objected to the paragraph, arguing that ""Governor Pataki's hearsay recollection 
of Governor Fortuno's statements constitutes admissible evidence to the extent that it is being offered for the truth of the matter 
asserted."" The Court sustains the objection and excludes as hearsay paragraph 150 from the record. Fed. R. Evid. 802"
1047,40," PRTC's paragraph 151 originally stated: ""Despite the Ethics Opinion and the clear message from Puerto Rico's Governor, 
OneLink still renewed its request to recuse Commission Torres even [**54]  after the TRB granted PRTC's franchise 
application."" PSMF ¶ 151. OneLink denied the statement, arguing its motion for a vote of no confidence and disqualification was 
based on different grounds than OneLink's earlier recusal motion, as well that there was no ""clear message from Puerto Rico's 
Governor"" on the subject. DRPSMF ¶ 151. The Court excludes any reference to Governor Fortuno's comments for the reasons 
stated footnote 39, supra. Moreover, in reviewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court determines that 
OneLink's November 16, 2011 motion was filed on different grounds than its January 20, 2011 motion to recuse, and accordingly 
adjusts the record. Nov. 16, 2011 Mot. for Vote of No Confidence and Disqualification of Comm'r Sandra Torres, In re: P.R. Tel. 
Co. h/n/c/ Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 132) (ECF 248); Jan. 20, 2011 OneLink Mot. for Recusal of

1048,42," OneLink's paragraph 40 originally stated: ""The TRB did not allow OneLink to cross-examine witnesses or to hear all of PRTC's 
testimony, during the August 8, 2011 public hearing in the second franchise proceeding."" DSMF ¶ 40. PRTC denied this 
statement, contending that OneLink was allowed to hear all of PRTC's testimony, but that during the confidential portion of the 
hearing the public was not permitted to attend. PRDSMF ¶ 40. PRTC also admits that OneLink was not allowed to cross-
examine witnesses. Id. Both parties cite the same portion of the record. Feb. 14, 2014 Decl. of Omar E. Martinez Vazquez, at ¶ 
3 (ECF No. 265). PRTC also cited Nov. 8, 2011 Resolution & Order at 9, In re: PRTC h/n/c ClaroTV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 
(Carson Decl. Ex. 77) (ECF No. 248); however, this portion of the record is unresponsive and not relevant to OneLink's 
paragraph 40. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to PTRC, the Court concludes that the TRB permitted OneLink (along with all 
other interested parties) to hear PRTC's testimony during the hearing, but did not permit it to hear [**61]  any testimony during 
confidential portions of the hearing. The Court affirms PRTC's denial in part and overrules its denial in part and adjusts the 
record to reflect the Court's findings."
1048,43," OneLink's paragraph 41 originally stated: ""On August 19, 2011, the TRB approved a Resolution and Order approving PRTC's 
franchise application."" DSMF ¶ 41. PRTC denied this statement, contending ""the November 2, 2011 Resolution and Order was 
not a valid order because one signatory, Aguirre Iturrino, was not a commissioner of the TRB on October 20, 2011, when the 
order was signed."" PRDSMF ¶ 41. PRTC's denial is based on a dissenting opinion by Commissioner Torres published on 
November 3, 2011. Nov. 3, 2011 Dissenting Op. of Comm'r Sandra Torres Lopez at 4, In re: PRTC h/n/c ClaroTV, JRT-2008-
CCG-0002 (Grube Decl. Ex. 22) (ECF No. 264). "
1049,," Reviewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to PRTC, the Court determines that TRB published a Resolution and Order 
on November 2, 2011, and that on November 3, 2011 Commissioner Torres issued a dissent asserting that the order was null 
and contrary to law. The evidence relied upon by PRTC does not establish that order was ""not valid,"" only that Commissioner 
Torres dissented to the order, contending [**62]  that it was not valid. To clarify this point, the Court expands the record to 
provide a section of Commissioner Torres' reasoning for her dissent. This expansion of the record also incorporates the content 
cited in OneLink's paragraphs 43-44. See DSMF ¶¶ 43-44. Finally, PRTC raises the same or substantially the same objection to OneLink's paragraphs 41-48. PRDSMF ¶¶ 41-48. By 
addressing the objection to OneLink paragraph 41 here, the Court also responds to PRTC's denials to OneLink's paragraphs 42-
48. "
1050,44," OneLink admitted PRTC's paragraph 73 with qualification, noting: On November 2, 2011, the TRB issued an order granting PRTC's second video franchise application and imposing 
conditions on PRTC's franchise. Then, on November 8, 2011, the TRB under a new majority consisting of Commissioner 
Torres (who had dissented from the November 2 Order) and newly-appointed Commissioner Escudero (who had not 
participated in any hearings on the application or the November 2 Order)—both long-time former PRTC employees 
receiving PRTC pensions—rescinded the November 2 Order, including its conditions, and issued a new order granting 
PRTC's franchise. Neither of those orders approved or addressed [**64]  the actual franchise agreement that was 
necessary for PRTC to operate its IPTV system. That agreement was subsequently negotiated between PRTC and the 
TRB. DRPSMF ¶ 73. This issue is addressed footnote 45, infra."
1050,45," PRTC denied OneLink's paragraph 49, asserting that the TRB ""reconsider[ed]"" the November 2, 2011 Resolution and Order, 
not that it ""revoked and replaced"" it. PRDSMF ¶ 49. In support of this argument, PRTC cites the TRB's November 8, 2011 
resolution and order. Nov. 8, 2011 Resolution & Order at 1, In re: PRTC h/n/c ClaroTV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 
77) (ECF No. 248). The order does state that it proceeds to ""reconsider the Resolution and Order."" Id. However, OneLink 
provided testimony on the matter where PRTC admitted that the November 8, 2011 resolution and order ""revoked and replaced"" 
the November 2, 2011 resolution and order. DSMF ¶ 49 (citing Pl.'s Resp. & Obj. to Def.'s Req. for Admis., Interrog., and Req. 
for Produc. of Docs., Resp. to Req. for Admis. Nos. 177 & 178 (Grube Decl. Ex. 38) (ECF No. 264)). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to PRTC, the Court determines that the TRB ""reconsidered"" the November 2, 
2011 Resolution and Order, but it also ""revoked and [**65]  replaced"" it with the November 8, 2011 Resolution and Order, and 
accordingly adjusts the record."
1050,46," OneLink provided an unresponsive, qualified admission to PRTC's paragraph 75 that the Court overrules. DRPSMF ¶ 75. "
1051,47," OneLink provided an unresponsive, [**66]  qualified admission to PRTC's paragraph 74 that the Court overrules. DRPSMF ¶

No. 248). This error is corrected for the record."
1051,49," OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 76 as argumentative, not fact, and improper under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b). DRPSMF ¶ 76. 
OneLink admitted that PRTC accurately cited the TRB decision, but denies that ""the TRB's legal conclusion, as stated therein, is 
correct, [**70]  let alone that it was compelled at that time by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision."" Id. Regardless whether 
the TRB's legal conclusion is ""correct,"" OneLink admitted the statement accurately quotes the TRB's order. The Court denies 
OneLink's objection. "
1052,," Additionally, PRTC's paragraph 134 originally stated: ""In its April 4, 2012 Resolution and Order, the TRB affirmed that OneLink 
could only file a motion ""requesting the agency's decision be reconsidered"" once the TRB determined that OneLink had a 
""substantial and legitimate interest"" in PRTC's franchise proceeding."" PSMF ¶ 134. OneLink denied this paragraph as 
incomplete and provided the full quote cited by PRTC. DRPSMF ¶ 134. The Court upholds the denial and incorporates the 
entirety of the sentence cited by PRTC into the record through PSMF ¶ 76. See Apr. 4, 2012 Decision & Order at 7, P.R. Tel. 
Co. h/n/c Claro TV, FC-100 (Carson Decl. Ex. 1) (ECF No. 248)."
1052,50," PRTC's paragraph 77 originally stated: ""As the TRB noted, the time to intervene arises at this point because ""if PRTC had not 
complied with its conditions [that were listed in the TRB's order approving the franchise application], there would have been no 
franchise."" PSMF ¶ 77. [**71]  OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 77 as being argument, not fact, and improper under D.P.R. 
LOC. R. 56(b). DRPSMF ¶ 77. OneLink admitted that PRTC accurately cited the TRB decision, but denied that ""the TRB's legal 
conclusion, as stated therein, is correct, let alone that it was compelled at that time by the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's 
decision."" Id. Again, regardless of whether the TRB's legal conclusion is ""correct,"" OneLink admitted that the statement 
accurately quotes the TRB's order. The Court overrules OneLink's denial, but adds the full text of the paragraph of the TRB 
order cited by PRTC to better understand PRTC's paragraph 77."
1052,51," PRTC's paragraph 13 originally stated: ""OneLink was given ""the opportunity to present the evidence and arguments that it 
deemed appropriate for its claim for intervention"" at the August 9, 2012 intervention hearing."" PSAMF ¶ 13. OneLink denied this 
statement as unsupported, arguing that: By the time of the August 9, 2012 hearing, OneLink had filed an appeal to the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals seeking an 
order that (i) the TRB had lost jurisdiction for failing to resolve OneLink's motion for reconsideration in 90 days; (ii) OneLink 
should be allowed to intervene into PRTC's franchise proceeding in accordance with the OneLink v. Claro Supreme Court 
decision. . . . OneLink also had pending at the time of the August 9, 2012 hearing a petition for certiorari to the Puerto Rico 
Supreme Court in which OneLink requested that the Court issue an order to the TRB to not permit PRTC to construct or 
operate its franchise until after OneLink's then pending motion for reconsideration was resolved. Given these pending appeals, OneLink could not participate (and therefore did not have the opportunity to present 
evidence [**73]  and arguments) in the August 9 hearing (a point it made to the TRB in a letter on August 6, 2012), without 
jeopardizing its appellate position and losing the opportunity for appellate court assistance to ensure that Puerto Rico law "
1053,," was followed. Accordingly, OneLink made a special, limited appearance at the August 9, 2012 hearing to make clear its 
view that the TRB had lost jurisdiction over the proceedings. DRPSAMF ¶ 13. Reviewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the record supports the conclusion that the 
TRB gave OneLink the opportunity to address its claim for intervention at the August 9, 2012 hearing, but also that OneLink 
declined to do so because, inter alia, it did not recognize the TRB's jurisdiction over the matter. Aug. 9, 2012 Minutes at 1-2 
(Eloranto Decl. Ex. 14) (ECF 272); Aug. 6, 2012 Special Appearance Letter to TRB (Grube Decl. 2 Ex. 6) (ECF No. 284). The 
Court adjusts the record to incorporate why, as supported by the record evidence, OneLink declined to argue the intervention 
issue at the August 9, 2012 hearing before the TRB."
1053,52," PRTC's paragraph 131 originally stated: ""As usual, OneLink filed a motion for reconsideration of this decision on May 25, 2012 
and the court denied it on May 30, 2012."" PSMF ¶ 131. OneLink objected to PRTC's use of the term ""as usual"" as argumentative 
and not a statement of fact to which any response is required. DRPSMF ¶ 131. The Court agrees and affirms OneLink's [**75]  
objection, removing the term ""as usual"" from the record."
1053,53," PRTC's paragraph 136 originally stated: ""Before [**76]  the Official Examiner had time to determine whether OneLink had a 
'legitimate and substantial interest' in PRTC's franchise proceeding, OneLink filed a petition for review before the Puerto Rico 
Court of Appeals on June 27, 2012 regarding its petition for reconsideration of PRTC's franchise."" PSMF ¶ 136. OneLink denied 
this paragraph; this denial is addressed in part by and resolved through the admission of paragraph 137. DRPSMF ¶ 136; see 
also PRTC ¶ 137; DRPSMF ¶ 137. Moreover, PRTC submitted the original Spanish version of OneLink's June 27, 2012 Petition 
for Review in San Juan Cable LLC, h/n/c OneLink Commc'ns v. TRB, et al., KLRA-2012-536 (Carson Decl. Ex. 123) (ECF No. 
248), but failed to submit a certified translation of that petition as required by D.P.R. LOC. R. 5(g). Having reviewed the record in 
the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court determines that OneLink filed a petition for review before the Puerto Rico Court of 
Appeals on June 27, 2012 regarding its petition for reconsideration of PRTC's franchise, Aug. 30, 2012 Op. at 4, San Juan 
Cable LLC, h/n/c OneLink Commc'ns v. TRB, et al., KLRA-2012-536 (Carson Decl. Ex. 124) (ECF No. 248), and affirms 
OneLink's objection as to whether [**77]  the Official Examiner had time to determine whether OneLink had a ""legitimate and 
substantial interest"" in PRTC's franchise proceeding. See March 9, 2012 Resolution & Order, In re: PRTC h/n/c Claro TV, JRT-
2008-CCG-0002 (Grube Decl. Ex. 23) (ECF No. 264); Jul. 9, 2012 Resolution & Order at 2, In re: P.R. Tel. Co. d/b/a Claro TV, 
JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Grube Decl. Ex. 25) (ECF No. 264)."
1053,54," OneLink admitted PRTC's paragraph 138, but qualified its admission in stating that ""OneLink avers that the Puerto Rico Court 
of Appeals also noted in its decision that there are a number of exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine, including irreparable 
harm."" DRPSMF ¶ 138. This qualification is unresponsive and is overruled. "
1054,55," OneLink admitted that PRTC used the quoted language in paragraph 78, but denied that these representations ""constituted 
sufficient assurances to address the TRB's and OneLink's concerns regarding cross-subsidization . . . ."" DRPSMF ¶ 78. This 
denial regarding the sufficiency of these representations is argument, not fact, is improper under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b), and is 
overruled. Medina, 896 F.2d at 8."
1054,56," PRTC's paragraph [**80]  80 originally stated: ""Obviously aware of PRTC's representation to its regulator that it 'will comply 
with the FCC rules on separate accounting,' OneLink stated that it 'should not be require[d] . . . to rely upon petitioning the FCC 
to obtain relief against PRTC [for cross-subsidy violations].'"" PSMF ¶ 80. OneLink denied this statement, admitting that it was 
aware of PRTC's representations to the TRB regarding compliance with FCC rules on separate accounting, but denied PRTC's 
""highly selective quotation"" accurately reflected OneLink's statement in its July 22, 2009 petition. DRPSMF ¶ 80. The Court 
affirms OneLink's denial and provides OneLink's full statement for context. Also, OneLink again denied that PRTC's representations in the second franchise application constituted sufficient assurances to 
address the TRB and OneLink's cross-subsidization concerns, as evidenced by the TRB's November 2, 2011 Resolution and 
Order and especially in light of the TRB's earlier November 2008 order rejecting PRTC's first franchise application. Id. Again, this 
denial regarding the sufficiency of these representations is argument, not fact, is improper under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b), and is 
overruled. Medina, 896 F.2d at 8."
1054,57," PRTC's paragraphs 111 [**81]  and 116 stated: ""On July 22, 2009, OneLink represented to the TRB that it understood that 
""The Statement of Public Policy in Law 213 provides that it is the policy of Puerto Rico to 'concentrate the primary jurisdiction 
with regarding to the regulation of the telecommunications field in a single agency of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.'"" PSMF 
¶¶ 111, 116. OneLink admitted the paragraph but qualified it by providing the context of the entire section of its July 22, 2009 
petition to the TRB. DRPSMF ¶¶ 111, 116. This section was already provided in response to OneLink's objections to PRTC's 
paragraph 80, footnote 56, supra, and thus OneLink's qualifications to paragraphs 111 and 116 have been addressed. "
1055,58," PRTC's paragraph 84 originally stated: ""On July 23, 2010, OneLink filed its inevitable motion for reconsideration. This motion 
was denied by the appeals court on August 5, 2010."" PSMF ¶ 84. OneLink objected to the use of the term ""inevitable"" as 
argumentative and lacking any support in the record. DRPSMF ¶ 84. The Court affirms the objection and has removed 
""inevitable"" from the record."
1055,59," OneLink denied the first sentence of PRTC's paragraph 85 (""Regarding OneLink's alleged cross-subsidy 'concerns'""), [**84]  
and to support its concerns regarding cross-subsidization, cited the TRB's November 2, 2011 Resolution and Order and the 
TRB's earlier November 2008 order rejecting PRTC's first franchise. DRPSMF ¶ 85 (citing Oct. 29, 2008 Resolution & Order at 
7-8, In re: Coqui.Net Corp. h/n/c Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0001 (Carson Decl. Ex. 59) (ECF No. 248); Nov. 2, 2011 Resolution

Order, In re: PRTC h/n/c Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson Decl. Ex. 77) (ECF No. 248)). The Court affirms OneLink's 
denial and accordingly adjusts the record. See footnote 60, infra."
1055,60," PRTC's paragraph 87 originally stated: ""In the context of the PRTC application, the TRB addressed cross-subsidization by 
noting that the FCC already has in place a comprehensive cross-subsidy regulatory scheme under parts 32 and 64 of the FCC 
rules and imposing requirements to insure compliance with this federal regulatory scheme."" PSMF ¶ 87. OneLink denied PRTC's 
paragraph 87 as incomplete, noting that the TRB had previously addressed OneLink's concerns respecting cross-subsidies. 
DRPSMF ¶ 87 (citing Nov. 8, 2011 Resolution [**85]  & Order at 5, In re: PRTC h/n/c Claro TV, JRT-2008-CCG-0002 (Carson

(Carson Decl. Ex. 59) (ECF No. 248). The Court recounts the facts in the light most hospitable to OneLink's case theories consistent with record support. Gillen, 283 
F.3d at 17. The Court affirms OneLink's denial and adjusts the record to reflect the full progression of the TRB's consideration of 
cross-subsidization. "
1056,61," PRTC's paragraph 17 originally stated: ""In addition to its federal court lawsuits, on July 15, 2009, OneLink filed a state court 
lawsuit alleging that PRTC violated the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Act by illegally building a cable system, and requested 
a preliminary injunction."" PSMF ¶ 17. OneLink objected to the ""vague references to 'federal court lawsuits,'"" arguing: On February 10, 2009, OneLink filed a complaint requesting an injunction against PRTC's operation and construction of its 
IPTV network under a 'Special Temporary Authority' or ""STA"" that had been approved by the TRB. This Court found a 
likelihood of success on the merits on OneLink's claim and, in response, PRTC and the TRB agreed to dissolve the STA. 
After OneLink discovered that PRTC was continuing to illegally build its network, [**87]  it sought to reopen the first action, 
but this Court suggested that OneLink file a new complaint so that the parties could go directly to the merits. OneLink did so on April 2, 2009. As this indicates, both ""federal court lawsuits"" actually related to the same issue, i.e., 
PRTC's continuing illegal construction and operation of its IPTV network. OneLink admits that after this Court found that OneLink did not have a private cause of action under the specific Cable Act 
provisions alleged in the federal action filed on April 2, 2009, OneLink filed a state court lawsuit on July 15, 2009, alleging 
that PRTC violated the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Act by illegally building a cable system and requested a 
preliminary injunction, among other relief. DRPSMF ¶ 17. Reviewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court expands on paragraph 17 to provide 
background regarding the two 47 U.S.C. § 521 (Cable Act) lawsuits filed in this Court. See Feb. 10, 2009 Verified Compl., San 
Juan Cable LLC d/b/a OneLink Commc'ns v. TRB, et al., 3:09-cv-01119-GAG (Carson Decl. Ex. 90) (ECF No. 248); Apr. 2, 2009 
Compl., San Juan Cable d/b/a OneLink Commc'ns v. P.R. Tel. Co., 3:09-cv-1322-GAG (Carson Decl. [**88]  Ex. 97) (ECF 248)."
1056,62," PRTC's paragraph 35 originally [**90]  stated: Well aware that the TRB's STA was for a limited test and did not amount to general permission to market IPTV services, 
and despite acknowledging that the test would have caused no harm to OneLink, OneLink still challenged the approval of 
the test by the TRB in federal district court. OneLink's basis? As explained by its 30(b)(6) witness on the sham litigation: 
""Something smelled fishy. You know, we needed to get to the bottom of it."" PSMF ¶ 35. OneLink denied this paragraph, submitting that the statement is an argument and legal conclusion, not a fact, and 
improper under D.P.R. Loc. R 56(b). DRPSMF ¶ 35. Reviewing the record in the light favorable to OneLink, the Court agrees "
1057,," that a significant portion of paragraph 35 is argument, not fact, excludes the arguments, and expands upon the record to provide 
greater context on the issue of harm and the STA. Khoury Dep. at 48:3-20 (Carson Dec. Ex. 41) (ECF No. 248). Additionally, PRTC's statement of material facts paragraph 94 and statement of additional material facts paragraph 27 are 
substantially similar to PSMF ¶ 35, and OneLink raised similar objections to each. DRPSMF ¶ 94; DRPSAMF ¶27. As such, 
PRTC's paragraphs 94 and 27 and OneLink's objections [**91]  are incorporated into paragraph 35. Finally, PRTC's statement of additional material fact paragraph 28 relies on the same or related testimony as PSMF ¶¶ 35, 94 
and PSAMF ¶ 27. PSAMF ¶ 28. OneLink denied the statement as unsupported. DRPSAMF ¶ 28. For the reasons discussed in 
this footnote, the Court expands on the record cited by PRTC to provide greater context on why OneLink filed its Cable Act 
complaints."
1057,63," OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 7 as unsupported, asserting that Mr. Gilmer did not know whether PRTC constructed a 
head end prior to receiving franchise approval, and that he was only ""generally aware"" that constructing video-related 
components of the plant before receiving a franchise was illegal. DRPSAMF ¶ 7. Having reviewed the evidence in the light most 
favorable to OneLink, the Court concludes that Mr. Gilmer did not know whether PRTC built a head end facility prior to receiving 
franchise approval but finds that Mr. Gilmer testified that if PRTC did build a head end prior to receiving franchise approval that it 
""would certainly be . . . illegal."" Gilmer Dep. 79:6-80:14 (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 8) (ECF No. 276). The Court adjusts the end of 
PRTC's paragraph 7 to read ""would be illegal"" [**92]  instead of ""was illegal."" Additionally, PRTC's paragraph 25 originally stated: ""OneLink Board member Barrett Gilmer could not recall OneLink's Cable Act 
claims but was certain that PRTC's conduct was illegal, including its construction of a head end prior to receiving a cable 
franchise."" PSAMF ¶ 25. OneLink admitted that Mr. Gilmer could not recall the Cable Act claims, but, as in paragraph 7, denied 
that Mr. Gilmer knew the head end construction was illegal. Id. The Court includes in the record that Mr. Gilmer could not recall 
OneLink's Cable Act claims."
1057,64," OneLink gave a qualified admission to PRTC's paragraph 8, noting that Mr. Dorchester was constrained by the requirements 
of not disclosing his knowledge of the alleged illegal build out that came from his legal counsel and was protected by attorney-
client privilege, and as such provided only the two reasons stated in paragraph 8. DRPSAMF ¶ 8. After reviewing the record the 
Court agrees with this qualification and adjusts the record to reflect the constraints of attorney-client privilege by noting that there 
were two reasons Mr. Dorchester believed PRTC was engaged in illegal pre-franchise construction. Mr. Dorchester may have 
had additional [**93]  reasons. These adjustments also address OneLink's denial of PRTC's paragraph 24. PSAMF ¶ 24; 
DRPSAMF ¶ 24. The Court does not include the additional testimony provided by OneLink from other members of OneLink's 
Board."
1057,65," PRTC's paragraph 9 originally stated: ""OneLink Chief Technology Officer Russell Skinner submitted a declaration in OneLink's 
first federal illegal construction suit supporting OneLink's claim that PRTC was engaged in illegal construction."" PSAMF ¶ 9. 
OneLink denied that Mr. Skinner was their ""Chief Technology Officer,"" contended that instead he was a technology consultant; 
OneLink admitted that Mr. Skinner signed a declaration that was submitted to this Court during the first Cable Act complaint. Id. 
The record supports OneLink's denial and is adjusted accordingly. "
1058,66," PRTC admitted OneLink's paragraph 61 but qualified it, observing that this Court and the First Circuit concluded that OneLink 
lacked standing to bring its claims. PRDSMF ¶ 61; San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Tel. Co., 623 F.Supp.2d 189, 195 (D.P.R. 2009); 
San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Tel. Co., 612 F.3d 25, 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2010). The Court adjusts the record to incorporate PRTC's 
qualified admission. Additionally, PRTC's statement of additional material fact paragraph 10 asserted: Mr. Skinner testified that an ""IPTV trial . . . with a group of 250 homes"" performed by another of his clients, Hawaiian 
Telephone, a year before this client received a cable franchise was legal. This pre-franchise [**95]  test by Mr. Skinner's 
client occurred before or during the time that OneLink filed its § 1983 claim and funded Choice's October 27, 2011 
Complaint. PSAMF ¶ 10. OneLink denied this statement as unsupported, noting that Mr. Skinner was not an attorney, but instead a 
technology consultant whose work was ""exclusive to a laboratory environment and assembling . . . brand-new technology that 
had never really been integrated before."" DRPSAMF ¶ 10; Skinner Dep. 134:9-14 (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 11) (ECF No. 276). The 
Court agrees that there is no foundation for Mr. Skinner to give a legal opinion as to whether PRTC's actions were compliant with 
federal law. Moreover, as OneLink notes, ""there is no foundational evidence that establishes that whatever testing occurred in 
Hawaii was similar to what PRTC was doing."" DRPSAMF ¶ 10. The Court excludes PRTC's paragraph 10 from the record."
1058,67," PRTC's paragraph 35 originally stated: ""On March 25, 2009, OneLink moved to re-open its Cable Act case, but the Court 
declined."" PSMF ¶ 95. OneLink denied this paragraph, citing San Juan Cable LLC v. P.R. Telephone Co., 623 F.Supp.2d 189, 
194 (D. P. R. 2009), to support its contention that OneLink did move on March 25, 2009, to re-open its original federal lawsuit 
challenging the STA, and instead of re-opening the case, the Court requested that OneLink file a new case challenging PRTC's 
alleged illegal pre-franchise construction. DRPSMF ¶ 95. The record supports OneLink's denial and is adjusted to reflect that the 
Court requested OneLink to refill its complaint."
1058,68," OneLink admitted that it filed a second complaint under the Cable Act on April, 2, 2009, but qualified that it did so at the 
invitation of the Court and denied any suggestion [**97]  that the new complaint was repetitive or frivolous. DRPSMF ¶ 96. The 
record supports OneLink's contention, footnote 67, supra, and the Court has included this qualification."
1058,69," OneLink admitted paragraph 98 but qualified that its amended complaint also included new claims to address PRTC's new 
assertion that OneLink did not have a private right of action under the Cable Act provisions alleged in the initial complaint. 
DRPSMF ¶ 98; Apr. 16, 2009 Am. Compl. at ¶ 58, San Juan Cable d/b/a OneLink Commc'ns v. P.R. Tel. Co., 3:09-cv-1322-
GAG (Carson Decl. Ex. 99) (ECF No. 248). The record supports this qualification and is adjusted accordingly. "
1059,70," In its qualified admission to OneLink's paragraph 61, PRTC provided the record evidence that this Court dismissed OneLink's 
first Cable Act complaint on May 27, 2009. PRDSMF ¶ 61."
1059,71," OneLink admitted that it sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico containing the language quoted by 
PRTC but objected to OneLink's use of the word ""confirmed"" and denied there was any conflict between asking for executive 
relief given the law as the Court stated it, while also appealing the Court's judgment. DRPSMF ¶ 99. The Court replaced 
""confirmed"" with ""sent a letter"" and inserted more of the quoted portion of the letter to expand the record and provide context, 
addressing OneLink's concerns about PRTC ¶ 99 and ¶ 100. DRPSMF ¶¶ 99, 100."
1059,72," In its qualified admission to OneLink's paragraph 61, PRTC provided record evidence for the date the First Circuit Court of 
Appeals affirmed this Court's dismissal of OneLink's [**99]  first Cable Act complaint, as well as the fact that the First Circuit 
affirmed this Court's decision. PRDSMF ¶ 61."
1059,73," PRTC's paragraph 101 originally stated: ""Despite several clear decisions that OneLink had no standing to assert a claim under 
the Cable Act, OneLink filed another federal lawsuit alleging that PRTC violated the Cable Act in November 2011."" PSMF ¶ 101. 
OneLink objected to this statement as argument, not fact, and improper under D.P.R. Loc. R. 56(b). DRPSMF ¶ 101. The Court 
agrees and removes this language from paragraph 101. Moreover, the record evidence does not support PRTC's assertion that 
""[d]espite several clear decisions that OneLink had no standing to assert a claim under the Cable Act of the franchise 
agreement."" D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(e) (""Facts contained in a supporting or opposing statement of material facts, if supported by 
record citations as required by this rule, shall be deemed admitted unless properly controverted""). Additionally, in the record the 
Court includes that Choice Cable was a co-plaintiff in the action against the TRB. See Nov. 29, 2011 Compl. for Inj. and Other 
Relief at 1, San Juan Cable LLC d/b/a OneLink Commc'ns and P.R. Cable Acquisition Corp. d/b/a Choice Cable T.V. v. TRB et 
al., 3:11-cv-2152-DRD (Carson Decl. Ex. 103) (ECF No. 248)."
1059,74," PRTC's paragraph 102 originally stated: ""On [**101]  November 29, 2011, after the TRB approved PRTC's Franchise 
Application and was considering the Franchise Agreement, OneLink filed suit against the TRB in federal court alleging violations 
of Ku Klux Klan Act and, once again, the Cable Act."" PSMF ¶ 102. OneLink admitted that it filed the federal lawsuit on November 
29, 2011 but denied paragraph 102 on two grounds: (1) that the PRTC proffered no evidence that the TRB was ""considering"" 
PRTC's franchise agreement on or about November 29, 2011; and (2) that a 42 U.S.C. § 1983, an action commonly referred to 
as an action under the Ku Klux Klan Act, suggests that OneLink engaged in ""sham"" conduct, as section 1983 is not limited to 
claims against members of the Ku Klux Klan or similar organizations. DRPSMF ¶ 102. After reviewing the record, the Court 
agrees that PRTC proffered no evidence that the TRB was considering PRTC's franchise agreement when the law suit was filed. 
The Court alters the record to refer only to § 1983, not the KKK Act. Additionally, PRTC's paragraph 123 is nearly identical to paragraph 102. PSMF ¶ 123. OneLink raised the same objections to 
paragraph 123 as to paragraph 102, DRPSMF ¶ 123, and the Court alters paragraph 123 as it did for paragraph 102. "
1060,75," PRTC's [**102]  paragraph 20 originally stated: ""OneLink filed its § 1983 action because, in its view, PRTC was constructing a 
cable plant illegally using cross-subsidized funds."" PSAMF ¶ 29. OneLink admitted that Mr. Zachem's deposition identified illegal 
pre-franchise construction and cross-subsidization as two of the reasons for filing its November 29, 2011 complaint against the 
TRB but also argues ""any suggestion that these were the only reasons is denied as unsupported,"" citing the complaint itself and 
providing other bases for filing, such as the actions of the TRB in rescinding its November 2, 2011 order. DRPSAMF ¶ 29; 
Zachem Dep. 177:20-178:10 (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 9) (ECF 276); November 29, 2011 Complaint, San Juan Cable d/b/a/ OneLink 
v. Telecom. Regulatory Bd. of P.R., No. 11-cv-02152 (D.P.R.) (Carson Decl. Ex. 103) (ECF 248). Viewing the evidence in the 
light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court affirms its denial and provides additional record evidence regarding OneLink's stated 
reasons for filing its November 29, 2011 Section 1983 and Cable Act Complaint."
1060,76," PRTC's paragraph 30 asserted that ""OneLink Board member Brian Cassidy could not recall the § 1983 action."" PSAMF ¶ 30. 
OneLink denied this statement as unsupported, [**103]  contending that Mr. Cassidy recalled that OneLink filed the action, but 
he could not specifically recall the complaint itself. DRPSAMF ¶ 30. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, 
the Court affirms its denial and excludes paragraph 30 from the record. OneLink provides record evidence of other Board 
members' approval of the filing, and regarding the filing of the November 29, 2011 complaint Mr. Cassidy himself stated ""I'm sure 
the Board was updated."" Cassidy Dep. 116:8 (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 5) (ECF No. 276); Zachem Dep. 169:19-171:24, 173:3-175:23 
(Grube Decl. 2 Ex. 12) (ECF No. 284)."
1060,77," PRTC's paragraph 104 originally stated: ""On December 2, 2011, with the holiday season approaching, OneLink extorted from 
the TRB an agreement to delay approval of PRTC's Franchise Agreement until at least January 31, 2012 in exchange for 
OneLink withdrawing its TRO request."" PSMF ¶ 104. OneLink denied paragraph 104, arguing that PRTC had proffered no 
evidence establishing or supporting a reasonable inference that OneLink engaged in any extortion to resolve an action pending 
before this Court. DRPSMF ¶ 104. The Court agrees. The record evidence does not support PRTC's assertion that OneLink 
""extorted from the TRB an agreement to delay approval"" of the franchise agreement, and OneLink's objection adequately 
explained the circumstances surrounding the settlement agreement with record citation. D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(e) (""Facts contained 
in a supporting or opposing statement of material facts, if supported by record citations as required by this rule, shall be deemed 
admitted unless properly controverted""). The Court excludes PRTC's reference to the ""holiday season"" as irrelevant. Fed. R. 
Evid. 402. Additionally, PRTC provided a qualified [**105]  response to OneLink's paragraph 63 that it admitted ""that the TRB acquiesced 
to OneLink's extortion."" PRDSMF ¶ 63. For the reasons discussed in this footnote, the Court denies PRTC's qualification."
1060,78," PRTC's paragraph 105 originally stated: ""On February 1, 2012, after the extorted period of delay lapsed, the TRB approved 
PRTC's Franchise Agreement."" PSMF ¶ 105. OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 105, submitting that PRTC had proffered no 
evidence establishing or supporting a reasonable inference that OneLink engaged in any extortion to resolve an action pending 
before this Court. DRPSMF ¶ 105. For the same reasons discussed in the previous footnote 77, supra, the assertion of extortion 
is removed from the record."
1060,79," OneLink admitted paragraph 106, but denied any suggestion that any dismissal was based on the Cable Act, asserting that 
rather the Court's dismissal was based on the Younger abstention and ripeness doctrines. DRPSMF ¶ 106; Feb. 2, 2012 Op. & 
Order at 2, San Juan Cable LLC d/b/a OneLink Commc'ns and P.R. Cable Acquisition Corp. d/b/a Choice Cable T.V. v. TRB et "
1061,," al., 3:11-cv-2152-DRD (Carson Decl. Ex. 106) (ECF No. 248). The record supports OneLink's denial and is amended to note 
the [**106]  dismissal was based on the Younger abstention and ripeness doctrines."
1061,80," See footnote 61, supra."
1061,81," PRTC's paragraph 108 originally stated: On September 4, 2009, [**107]  OneLink appealed to the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals. On October, 20, 2009, the TRB 
opposed the appeal, explaining that: ""This case constitutes the most recent episode in a prolonged campaign abusing the 
judicial appeals process initiated by [OneLink] in order to prevent the [TRB] from exercising its statutory prerogative of 
evaluating a cable-TV franchise application and attempting to keep [PRTC] from submitting an application before the [TRB] 
for the concession of such a franchise."" PSMF ¶ 108. OneLink denied this statement as an out-of-court statement by the TRB, excerpted from a legal brief by a non-
party in a different litigation whose interests were aligned with PRTC and against OneLink, and asserts it is inadmissible hearsay 
to the extent that it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Fed. R. Evid. 802. This objection is addressed in 
footnote 115, infra."
1061,82," PRTC's paragraph 39 originally stated: ""Here, in June and July 2009, OneLink submitted complaints regarding PRTC's alleged 
illegal deployment of a video network to the U.S. Department of Justice and the Puerto Rico Office of Monopolistic Affairs."" 
PSMF ¶ 39. OneLink objected to the term ""complaints"" to describe their communications with the U.S. Attorney's Office and 
OMA. DRPSMF ¶ 39. For reasons similar to those discussed in footnote 88, infra, regarding the term ""adverse action,"" the Court 
sustains OneLink's objection and substitutes ""complaint"" for ""petitioned."" Also, the Court adjusts the record to accurately reflect 
the dates of the communications cited in the record. See June 11, 2009 Letter to United States Attorney's Office at Puerto Rico 
Telephone Company, Inc.'s Violations of Federal Law (Carson Decl. Ex. 49) (ECF No. [**109]  248); Feb. 12, 2010 Letter to 
Assistant Secretary for Monopolistic Affairs, Department of Justice of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico at 4, re OneLink v. 
PRTC, QLM-2010-0010 (Carson Decl. Ex. 50) (ECF No. 248); July 13, 2009 email to FCC (Carson Decl. Ex. 111) (ECF No. 
248). Finally, for consistency and accuracy, the Court adjusts the record to refer to the United States Attorney for the District of 
Puerto Rico (U.S. Attorney) instead of the Department of Justice (DOJ). "
1062,," PRTC's paragraph 112 originally stated: ""After OneLink lost its federal Cable Act case before this Court, it petitioned two 
different federal agencies and the Puerto Rico Office of Monopolistic Affairs, claiming that PRTC was competing illegally years 
before PRTC ever received a franchise to offer IPTV."" PSMF ¶ 112. OneLink denied paragraph 112, contending that its 
communications with the DOJ and the FCC ""asserted that PRTC's construction of a cable system without a franchise was a 
violation of the federal Cable Act. OneLink's communications with the Puerto Rico Office of Monopolistic Affairs asserted unfair 
competition."" DRPSMF ¶ 112. The Court incorporated this clarifying language into the record, and in addition merged PRTC's 
paragraph 112 with paragraph 39, as they address the same set of facts. Also, the Court provided further clarification [**110]  
regarding what agencies were contacted and on what dates. Additionally, it is unclear from the record evidence on what date OneLink contacted the OMA. The February 12, 2010 letter from 
OneLink to the OMA does not state on which date OneLink initially contacted the OMA regarding PRTC's alleged anti-
competative behavior. Feb. 12, 2010 Ltr. to Asst. Secretary for Monopolistic Affairs, Dept. of Justice of the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico at 4, OneLink v. PRTC, QLM-2010-0010 (Carson Decl. Ex. 50) (ECF No. 248). In that letter, the earliest date 
mentioned by OneLink was the OMA's October 29, 2009 subpoena of the PRTC. Using that date, the Court establishes that 
OneLink contacted the OMA on some date on or before October 29, 2009."
1062,83," OneLink admitted PRTC's paragraph 113, but qualified its response by providing additional language from the quoted letter. 
DRPSMF ¶ 113. The Court incorporated this language into the record."
1062,84," PRTC's paragraph 114 originally stated: ""First, two weeks after this Court dismissed OneLink's case, on June 11, 2009, 
OneLink petitioned the United States Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico, contending that PRTC had committed 'serious, 
repeated and longstanding violations of federal law.'"" PSMF ¶ 114. OneLink denied this paragraph, arguing the letter was not 
""another petition"" but rather a continuation of OneLink's prior communications with the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding PRTC's 
unlawful pre-franchise construction. DRPSMF ¶ 114. After [**112]  reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, 
the Court agrees this was not ""another petition"" and adjusts the record to clarify this point."
1062,85," PRTC's paragraph 115 originally stated: ""OneLink also forwarded the same petition to the Federal Communications 
Commission claiming unfair competition by PRTC."" PSMF ¶ 115. OneLink admitted it forwarded its June, 22, 2009 letter to the 
U.S. Attorney, in addition to other information regarding PRTC's alleged illegal pre-franchise construction, but denied the letter 
specifically claimed ""unfair competition"" by PRTC. DRPSMF ¶ 115. The Court agrees with OneLink and alters the record to 
better reflect the nature and substance of the July 13, 2009 email sent to the FCC."
1062,86," PRTC's paragraph 117 originally stated: ""Despite this statement to the TRB, OneLink's representatives asked the Puerto Rico 
Department of Justice Office of Monopolistic Affairs (""OMA"") to investigate PRTC for violation of the Puerto Rico 
Telecommunications Act."" PSMF ¶ 117. OneLink denied the statement as argument, not fact, and argued it should be 
disregarded under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b). DRPSMF ¶ 117. OneLink additionally denied that its communication with OMA was in 
anyway at odds with PSMF ¶¶ 111, 116. Id. Reviewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court sustains 
OneLink's objection and denial, and accordingly adjusts the record. "
1063,87," OneLink's paragraph 66 originally stated: ""The OMA initiated an investigation into PRTC's misconduct and served a subpoena 
on it."" DSMF ¶ 66. PRTC denied the statement, asserting the OMA did not investigate ""misconduct"" by the PRTC. PRDSMF ¶ 
66. The Court agrees the use of the term ""misconduct"" is improper and alters the record using the language of the OMA's 
October 29, 2009 subpoena. See Oct. 29, 2009 Summons & Req. for Info., In re: QLM-2010-0010, P.R. Dept. of Justice Ofc. of 
Monopolistic Affairs (Grube Decl. Ex. 13) [**114]  (ECF No. 264)."
1063,88," PRTC's paragraph 23 originally stated: Nor did the Federal Communications Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, or Puerto Rico Department of Justice Office 
of Monopolistic Affairs ever pursue any adverse action in response to OneLink's complaints. PSMF ¶ 23. OneLink raised two objections to this paragraph. DRPSMF ¶ 23. First, OneLink objected that the term ""adverse 
action"" is ""vague and undefined"" and went on to state: [t]o the extent that ""adverse action"" means the initiation of a judicial proceeding, OneLink admits that [OMA] never initiated 
such a proceeding in response to OneLink's petitioning OMA to investigate ""whether PRTC has engaged in unfair 
competition by building its Cable TV system without first having obtained a franchise from the [TRB], and thus, in violation 
of law."" OMA did issue a subpoena to PRTC requesting information regarding its illegal pre-franchise construction activities, 
but as Mr. Khoury testified, OneLink is not aware that OMA ever ""issued any finding or issued any adverse ruling."" Id. Second, OneLink claims PRTC ""does not possess information sufficient to admit or deny whether the FCC or the U.S. 
Department of Justice ever pursued any 'adverse [**115]  action' against PRTC. Accordingly, Mr. Khoury's lack of knowledge 
cannot be used as evidence of the lack of agency action."" Id. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court includes OneLink's qualification as to what is meant by an 
""adverse action"" and substitutes the language with the term ""administrative proceedings."" Moreover, the Court agrees that a 
deponent's lack of knowledge cannot be used as evidence that the FCC and the U.S. Attorney's Office did not take any ""adverse 
actions,"" and that PRTC has not offered any additional evidences that the agencies did take any action. See Khoury Dep., at 
88:25-91:8 (Carson Decl. Ex. 41) (ECF No. 248). The Court modifies the statement to incorporate OneLink's objections. Mirroring PRTC's paragraph 23, paragraph 118 stated: ""Despite espousing a general lack of awareness of even having 
submitted these complaints to the FCC, DOJ, and OMA, OneLink was unable to identify any adverse action taken by any of the 
agencies in response to its complaints, because none ever occurred."" PSMF ¶ 118. OneLink denied paragraph 118 on similar 
grounds as it did to paragraph 23. DRPSMF ¶ 118. As with paragraph 23, the Court upholds OneLink's [**116]  denial and 
objection to paragraph 118."
1063,89," PRTC's paragraph 31 stated: No OneLink Director or Officer, including its Rule 30(b)(6) witness on the topic of OneLink's sham litigation, Naji Khoury, 
could explain why OneLink filed complaints with the USDOJ, FCC, or OMA, or were unaware that such complaints had 
been submitted or, in the case of the OMA, that the organization even existed. PSAMF ¶ 31. OneLink denied the paragraph as unsupported. DRPSAMF ¶ 31. The Court agrees. The testimony cited by PRTC 
largely does not relate to why the petitions to these agencies were filed, but highlights that the Board members could not recall 
the specifics of those filings. The Board members' lack of memory or knowledge regarding the specifics of the filings or the filings 
themselves is not material. Moreover, there is sufficient record evidence introduced by both parties addressing why OneLink 
petitioned the agencies. See Section I(B)(7), supra. PRTC's paragraph 31 is excluded from the record. "
1064,90," PRTC's paragraph 2 originally stated that ""[w]hen PRTC filed its 2008 franchise application, OneLink's management turned to 
their consulting telecommunications expert, Alvaro Pilar, to assess the competitive threat IPTV posed to OneLink."" PSMF ¶ 2. 
OneLink denied paragraph 2, contending it is ""neither relevant nor material to PRTC's motion for summary judgment"" nor does 
the purported statement find any support in the cited materials and is improper under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b) and should be 
disregarded. DPRSMF ¶ 2. OneLink argues that there is no evidence that Mr. Pilar was serving as a ""consulting 
telecommunications expert"" when he prepared the cited memorandum, or that OneLink's management ""turned to"" Mr. Pilar 
""when PRTC filed its 2008 franchise application"" for the purpose of [**119]  ""assess[ing] the competitive threat IPTV posed to 
OneLink."" Id. OneLink asserts that the document was prepared a few months after PRTC filed its first franchise application to 
provide ""an overview of IPTV and [a] guess of what PRTC may do or may not do on IPTV and an analysis of how IPTV works."" 
Id. (citing Pilar Dep. 38:14-39:20 (Carson Decl. Ex. 22.) (ECF No. 248) (Pilar Dep.)). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court finds that PRTC's paragraph 2 mischaracterizes the 
record and alters the statement to better reflect the record. The Court determines, however, that the information is relevant to 
understanding OneLink's knowledge regarding IPTV and PRTC's entry into the Cable television market."
1064,91," PRTC's paragraph 3 originally stated: After cautioning that the TRB ""supports competition in the cable market,"" Mr. Pilar shared his expert opinion with OneLink 
that ""[c]ustomers find a single source for both high-speed data and digital video services very attractive"" but that telephone 
companies like PRTC ""suffer because they have not been able to offer an equivalent triple play alternative."" PSMF ¶ 3. OneLink denied paragraph 9, arguing the statement of fact was neither relevant nor material [**120]  for summary 
judgment. DRPSMF ¶ 3. Specifically, OneLink again argued that there is no evidence that Mr. Pilar was a ""consulting 
telecommunications expert,"" footnote 90, supra, while also asserting that ""[n]or did Mr. Pilar anywhere in the memorandum 
""caution"" OneLink that the TRB ""supports competition in the cable market."" Id. OneLink admits that the memorandum PRTC 
selectively quotes contains the quoted text but denies that the quotes appear in the order or in the context PRTC represents. Id. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court alters the record to address PRTC's mischaracterizations 
but also determines that the information is relevant to understand OneLink's knowledge regarding IPTV and PRTC's entry into 
the Cable television market."
1064,92," OneLink denied PRTC's paragraph 4 as being ""neither relevant nor material,"" and asserted that the statement 
mischaracterized the cited memorandum as a ""report."" DRPSMF ¶ 4. However, OneLink admitted that the memorandum does 
contain the quoted text but denied the passage is complete as it failed to include Mr. Pilar's conclusion. Id. The Court altered the statement to characterize it as an ""overview"" and not a ""report"" and also [**121]  included the section of 
Mr. Pilar's conclusion omitted by PRTC. The Court overrules OneLink's objection that the statement of fact is neither relevant nor 
material, as it illuminates OneLink's knowledge regarding IPTV and PRTC's entry into the Cable television market. "
1065,93," PRTC's paragraph 5 stated: ""Faced with a looming ""price war,"" OneLink worked with the two other Puerto Rico cable 
companies, Liberty Cablevision and Choice Cable, to compose a white paper for potential submission to the TRB."" PSMF ¶ 5. 
OneLink denied paragraph 6 in its entirety, arguing the statement was neither relevant nor material, and denied that: there is any evidence that OneLink expected that PRTC's launch of IPTV would precipitate a ""price war,"" that any such war 
was ""looming,"" or that any ""price war"" occurred when PRTC did launch IPTV. Nor is there any evidence that OneLink 
""compose[d]"" the draft white paper, let alone that it did so ""for potential submission to the TRB."" . . . DRPSMF ¶ 5. Viewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court agrees with OneLink that there is no 
evidence that OneLink expected a ""looming 'price war'"" or that OneLink took any part in composing the draft white paper, 
agreed [**122]  with its views, or had knowledge of the document's content. Carrosquilla Dep. 25:10-27:15 (Carson Decl. Ex. 23) 
(ECF No. 248). Additionally, the Court grants OneLink's denials of PRTC's paragraphs 6-9. PSMF ¶¶ 6-9; DRPSMF ¶¶ 6-9. As with PRTC's 
paragraph 5, paragraphs 6-9 are direct quotes from the draft white paper. Id. Thus, for the reasons discussed in this footnote, 
the Court grants OneLink's objections and excludes PRTC's paragraphs 6-9."
1065,94," PRTC's paragraph 10 originally stated: ""At the same time, Ron Dorchester, CEO of OneLink, ordered his CFO and General 
Manager to prepare an analysis for the Board of Directors of the potential impact of PRTC's entry into IPTV on OneLink."" PSMF¶ 
10. OneLink denied the paragraph, arguing that there is no evidence that Mr. Dorchester ""ordered"" OneLink's CFO, Jorge 
Hernandez, or General Manager, Bill Chain, do anything. DRPSMF ¶ 10. OneLink contends that — three days after the PRTC 
submitted its second TRB franchise application — it sought Mr. Hernandez to ""assume three different, hypothetical scenarios in 
which PRTC were to make IPTV available between June and December 2008 and to calculate OneLink's [**124]  cash flow 
assuming each of those scenarios."" Id. OneLink further contends that ""t[]here is no evidence . . . that OneLink believed those 
scenarios were anything but hypothetical . . . or that Mr. Dorchester sought an ""analysis"" of ""the potential impact of PRTC's 
entry. Nor is there any basis to support PRTC's obviously incorrect assertion that Mr. Dorchester's February 2008 email was 
sent ""[a]t the same time"" that Liberty (not OneLink) prepared the draft white paper referenced in ¶¶ 5-9 (December 2008, based 
on its cover email)—they clearly were not."" Id. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court agrees with OneLink that there is no basis to support the 
contention that Mr. Dorchester's February 2008 email was sent during the same time that the draft white paper was prepared. 
The Court adjusts the record accordingly. However, the Court finds that OneLink is quibbling over the distinction between 
""ordered"" and ""asked"" or the difference between ""an analysis of potential impacts"" and ""assuming hypothetical scenarios,"" and 
thus does not alter the remainder of PRTC's statement. See Hernandez Dep. at 36:10-37:2 (Carson Decl. Ex. 26) (ECF No. 
248)."
1065,95," OneLink admitted the [**125]  quoted language appears in the document, but denied that Mr. Dorchester ""instructed"" his CFO 
and General Manager to do anything (asserting that he instead ""asked"") or requested his CFO to ""test"" PRTC's potential entry 
against OneLink's debt covenants. DRPSMF ¶ 11. Further, OneLink contends that ""[t]here is no evidence, however, that 
OneLink believed that those scenarios were anything but hypothetical and assumed for purposes of the requested exercise."" Id. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court finds that OneLink believed that ""those scenarios were 
anything but hypothetical"" and substituted PRTC's use of the word ""assume"" with ""presume,"" the actual language used in the 
February 2008 email. February 9, 2008 Dorchester Email (Carson Decl. Ex. 26) (ECF No. 248). OneLink's remaining objections 
are overruled. OneLink is again quibbling over the distinction between ""instructing"" and ""asking."" Moreover, the February 9, 2008 
email specifically asked OneLink's CFO to ""Test [models] 1-2-3 against our covenants for 2008"" and to ""Test against our cash 
needs for interest payments."" Id. "
1066,96," PRTC's paragraph 15 originally stated: In May 2008, a OneLink Board member advised Mr. Dorchester [**126]  that he had received an inquiry from a OneLink 
investor regarding how PRTC's provision of IPTV ""will impact our business."" Mr. Dorchester replied, ""Well that is no 
surprise is it! I'll provide a general response that can be used as a form for all these inquiries which doubtless will be 
forthcoming."" PSMF ¶ 15. OneLink denied paragraph 15 on grounds that (1) there is no evidence OneLink had received an inquiry from any 
entity that was an investor, and (2) that Mr. Dorchester's response that ""it is no surprise"" referenced PRTC's having filed its 
franchise application. DRPSMF ¶ 15. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court adjusts the record to reflect OneLink's qualifications. See 
Dorchester Dep. at 71:18-22; 73:8-14 (Carson Decl. Ex. 30) (ECF No. 248)."
1066,97," PRTC's paragraph 16 stated: It was ""no surprise"" because ratings agencies, such as Moody's, based their earlier 2007 ratings of the ""highly leveraged"" 
OneLink in part on the fact that ""San Juan faces competition that is less aggressive than in most stateside US markets ... 
[since] PRTC [is] unlikely to undertake a competitive video offering in San Juan over the next several years . . . given its 
combined ownership [**127]  by the government and Verizon."" PSMF ¶ 16. OneLink denied this statement, arguing that it is ""inadmissible hearsay to the extent that it is being offered to prove 
the truth of the matter asserted (Fed. R. Evid. 802). Inadmissible evidence may not be considered on summary judgment."" 
DRPSMF ¶ 16. The Court sustains the denial and excludes PRTC's paragraph 16 from the record as hearsay, Fed. R. Evid. 802; 
in addition, it is argument, not fact, and improper under D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(e)."
1066,98," OneLink admitted the statement supplied by PTRC regarding the June 3, 2008 email but provided the complete language of 
the paragraph cited by PTRC. DRPSMF ¶ 18. This additional language provided context for the statement and the Court 
expanded on PRTC's submission. See June 3, 2008 Dorchester Email (Carson Decl. Ex. 34) (ECF No. 248)."
1066,99," PRTC's paragraph 32 originally stated: ""To OneLink, its expensive pattern of lawsuits against PRTC and the TRB were ""A 
good investment!!"""" PSMF ¶ 32. OneLink objected to the statement as argument not fact and not supported in the materials as 
required by [**129]  D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b). DRPSMF ¶ 33. The Court agrees, as the cited October 15, 2008 email makes no 
reference to any ""pattern of lawsuits."" October 15, 2008 Marcus Email (Carson Exhibit No. 44) (ECF No. 248). Indeed, as of 
October, 2008, OneLink had only been involved with PRTC's first franchise application. The Court alters the record accordingly."
1066,100, PRTC's paragraph 19 originally stated: 
1067,," At the height of its frustration with its fellow incumbents' refusal to participate in OneLink's sham petitioning, OneLink went 
so far as to finance a lawsuit that it convinced Choice to file in which OneLink was neither a party nor had any interest in the 
outcome. PSMF ¶ 19. OneLink denied paragraph 19 it its entirety and listed myriad objections. DRPSMF ¶ 19. OneLink stated ""[n]one of 
the cited materials state or suggest that OneLink was frustrated or that it was engaged in any sham petitioning, which OneLink 
denies. Nor is there any evidence of any link between what is addressed in ¶ 18 (June 2008, regarding PRTC's first franchise 
application) and this paragraph (October 2011, regarding PRTC's second franchise application)."" Id. The Court agrees and finds 
that PRTC provided no evidence that OneLink was ""frustrated"" or that [**130]  there is a link between what is addressed in 
PSMF ¶ 18 and PSMF ¶ 19. Id. Regarding ""sham petitioning,"" the Court will consider in due course whether the facts 
demonstrate that OneLink's filings may have been ""objectively baseless."" Moreover, PRTC's record evidence does not show that OneLink ""convinced"" Choice to file a lawsuit. PRTC cites the depositional 
testimony of OneLink's Chief Financial Officer, Jorge Herandez, and billing statements from the law firm of Chadbourne & Park 
LLP sent to Mr. Hernandez for legal services provided to OneLink. Hernandez Dep. at 257:20-259:7 (Carson Decl. Ex. 35) (ECF 
No. 248); Exhibit 62 Billing Statements and Email (Carson Decl. Ex. 36) (ECF No. 248); Exhibit 63 Billing Statements and Email 
(Carson Decl. Ex. 37) (ECF No. 248). Nowhere is there any indication that OneLink attempted to or was successful in 
encouraging Choice to seek legal action against PRTC. At the same time, the record is less clear as to whether OneLink financed a lawsuit filed by Choice against PRTC. Specifically, 
the Chadbourne & Park LLP billing statements indicate that OneLink and Choice split legal costs for filing a complaint before the 
TRB and for a federal complaint against [**131]  the TRB. Exhibit 62 Billing Statements and Email (Carson Decl. Ex. 36); Exhibit 
63 Billing Statements and Email (Carson Decl. Ex. 37). In a billing statement dated December 16, 2011, Attorney Dana Frix of 
Chadbourne & Park emailed Mr. Dorchester an invoice for professional services rendered through December 16, 2011. The 
email stated: Please recall that in October OneLink and Choice agreed to split the cost of filing a complaint before the TRB. For 
convenience, we have segregated our charges for the complaint onto our Matter 008 (entitled: Choice Complaint to TRB re 
PRTC Illegal Construction). Please note that the amount of that invoice reflects only the amount due by OneLink. The other 
half is being billed directly to Choice. . . . Please also recall that OneLink and Choice are both plaintiffs in a federal complaint against the TRB, and that the 
companies have agreed to split charges for that complaint. We have segregated charges for the complaint onto our Matter 
010 (entitled: OneLink/Choice V. TRB). Id. PRTC also cited the deposition testimony of Mr. Khoury: Q: Did OneLink pay for part of the cost of filing this complaint? A: My understanding is yes, there was. I don't know exactly the [**132]  circumstances on which it happened, but, yes, it 
was. Q: Do you know why they agreed to pay for part of the cost? A: No, I do not know why. Khoury Dep. at 95:10-18 (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 6) (ECF No. 286). In addition, PRTC provides the deposition testimony of OneLink 
Senior Vice President Sandra Perry: Q: And were you aware that OneLink paid legal fees for proceedings filed by Choice objecting to the franchise application 
for PRTC? A: Yes. Q: How — how did you become aware of that? A: It came up in a meeting, in an operations meeting, in an operations meeting. Q: Who was — who was at that meeting? A: To the best of my memory, it was Ron Dorchester, Bill Chain, Jorge Hernandez. "
1068,," Perry Dep. at 85:9-20 (Carson Decl. Ex. 48) (ECF No. 250). Yet, later in her deposition Ms. Perry gave conflicting testimony: Q: From your experience in the industry, is — isn't it highly unusual for a company like OneLink to agree to pay legal fees 
for a company like Choice to oppose the application of a third party? A: I don't know that OneLink did, and I have no experience of that occurring. Id. at 87:2-21; see also id. at 83:11-17, 84:14-21. Also supporting OneLink's contention that it did not pay for Choice's legal 
fees [**133]  against PRTC is an October 31, 2011 email sent by Mr. Dorchester to OneLink Board members that states: Originally we were prepared to pay for the legal in order to not lose the opportunity to let people know about the continued 
bad behavior on the part of [PRTC]. Fortunately the local Choice/GM appeared interested and was able to gain permission 
from ""high powers"" to pay for the legal themselves. A nicer outcome!"" October 31, 2011 Dorchester Email (Grube Decl. Ex. 20) (ECF No. 264). Moreover, OneLink provides the following deposition 
testimony: Q: And, again, there was never any agreement between Choice and OneLink to fund any filings or litigation with respect to 
[PRTC's] franchise application? A: There was never an agreement for OneLink to fund any Choice applications or filings or petitions. Q: So Choice and OneLink never entered into any agreement whereby OneLink would pay for a portion of the expense for 
Choice to file any — its complaint to the TRB, for example? A: That is correct. OneLink has never offered to pay half or any portion of Choice Cable TV's charges for filing. Carrosquilla Dep. at 132:16-133: 4 (Grube Decl. Ex. 36) (ECF No. 264). Q: Do you know whether OneLink paid for [**134]  any legal filings made by Choice in opposition to the PRTC application? A: No, I'm not aware of such. No. Hernandez Dep. at 65:23-66:1 (Grube Decl. Ex. 33) (ECF No. 264). Q: Do you recall that OneLink paid for the lawsuit that Choice filed against [PRTC] alleging illegal build-out? . . . A: I don't — I don't believe we did. Dorchester Dep. at 88:20-25 (Carson Decl. Ex. 20) (ECF No. 248). The Court is required to draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all genuine factual disputes in favor of OneLink, ATC Realty, 
LLC v. Town of Kingston, New Hampshire, 303 F.3d 91, 94 (1st Cir. 2002), and having done so, finds that OneLink did not fund 
Choice's complaint against PRTC. Though it appears they were invoiced for Choice's complaint after agreeing to split the cost in 
October of 2011, the October 31, 2011 email sent by Mr. Dorchester to OneLink Board members indicates that Choice 
eventually agreed to pay its own legal fees. October 31, 2011 Dorchester Email (Grube Decl. Ex. 20). However, this email does 
indicate that OneLink was prepared to pay for Choice's legal fees against the PRTC. Id. This statement in the email contradicts 
the testimony provided by Mr. Khoury, as well as some of the testimony provided by Ms. Perry. Considering the conflicting 
statements given by Ms. Perry, [**135]  the testimony from Messrs. Carrosquilla, Hernandez, and Dorchester, that the invoice 
sent to OneLink from its counsel split the bill between OneLink and Choice, and the October 31, 2011 email from Mr. 
Dorchester, the Court finds that OneLink was prepared to pay for part or all of Choice's action against PRTC before the TRB but 
did not eventually make a payment, and amends the record accordingly. Additionally, for reasons similar to those discussed in this footnote, the Court affirms OneLink's objections to PRTC's statement 
of material fact paragraphs 119 and 120, PSMF ¶¶ 119-120, as well as PRTC's statements of additional material fact 
paragraphs 3-5. PSAMF ¶¶ 3-5."
1068,101," PRTC's paragraph 20 states: ""When Choice ultimately withdrew the OneLink funded action, Dorchester reported to his Board, 
""We are advised that Choice Cable has declined to continue its legal case against Claro/PRTC/TRB. This will and has absolutely 
no impact on our circumstances."" PSMF ¶ 20. OneLink denied this paragraph in its entirety. DRPSMF ¶ 20. First, OneLink "
1069,," denies that they funded Choice's lawsuit. For the reasons discussed in footnote 100, supra the Court upholds OneLink's denial. 
Second, OneLink further contends: [**136] And while OneLink admits that PRTC accurately quoted the cited email of March 21, 2012, OneLink denies that email or 
the quoted language has anything to do with any decision by Choice regarding the administrative complaint Choice had 
filed in the TRB challenging PRTC's pre-franchise construction—much less that it reflects a report on the withdrawal of that 
complaint. Viewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court sustains OneLink's denial. First, Mr. Dorchester 
references a ""legal case against Claro/PRT/TRB."" Id. However, the TRB was not a defendant in Choice's administrative 
complaint; it was the tribunal. See Oct 27, 2011 Compl. and Request for Emergency Relief, P.R. Cable Acquisition Corp. d/b/a 
Choice Cable T.V. v. P. R. Tel. Co., et al., JRT-2011-Q-0886 (Carson Decl. Ex. 47) (ECF No. 248). Second, Choice did not file a 
motion to withdraw its administrative complaint until October 9, 2012 — nearly six months after Mr. Dorchester sent the 
referenced email — as part of a settlement of an unrelated dispute with PRTC. Carrosquilla Dep. at 133:5-135:14 (Grube Dec. 
Ex. 36) (ECF No. 264); Oct. 9, 2012 Mot. Requesting Voluntary Dismissal with Prejudice, P.R. Cable [**137]  Acquisition Corp. 
d/b/a Choice Cable T.V. v. P. R. Tel. Co., et al., JRT-2011-Q-0886 (Grube Decl. Ex. 26) (ECF No. 264). For these reasons, the 
Court excludes paragraph 20, and the Court also excludes PRTC's paragraphs 37, 38, and 122. PSMF ¶¶ 37-38, 122."
1069,102," PRTC's paragraph 21 states: ""Begging the obvious question, then why did OneLink pay over $25,000 to have it filed?"" PSMF 
¶ 21. OneLink denied this statement, claiming it is a ""rhetorical question"" and ""is not a fact and therefore is improper under"" 
D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(b). DRPSMF ¶ 21. The Court agrees; this ""fact"" is an argument, not properly presented in a statement of 
material facts. Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 8 (""the nonmoving party [may not] rest[] merely upon conclusory allegations""). 
Furthermore, even if it were a ""fact,"" PRTC's record evidence does not support the assertion. See supra, footnotes 100-01. The 
Court excludes this statement from the record. Moreover, PRTC's paragraph 22 — which relates back to paragraph 21 — states: ""Mr. Dorchester answered that question to his 
own Board: 'It was just TOO important an opportunity to miss and they would have.'"" PSMF ¶ 22 (capitalized in the original). As 
with paragraph 21, this ""fact"" is an argument, not properly presented [**138]  in a statement of material facts. Medina-Munoz, 
896 F.2d at 8. Also, the quoted language does not support PRTC's assertion. It is unclear what was ""just TOO important an 
opportunity to miss."" OneLink contends that this quoted language does not refer to OneLink's claimed funding of Choice's 
administrative complaint but to a public relations effort by OneLink to report on PRTC's continued pre-franchise construction of 
its cable system. DRPSMF ¶ 22; see October 31, 2011 Dorchester Email (Grube Decl. Ex. 20); Hernandez Dep. at 65:23-66:1 
(Grube Decl. Ex. 33) (ECF No. 264). Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court excludes this 
statement from the record. Additionally, for the reasons discussed in this footnote, the Court also excludes PRTC's paragraphs 36 and 121. PSMF ¶¶ 36, 
121."
1069,103," PRTC admitted OneLink's paragraph 67 but qualified that the TRB took action on the Choice complaint; specifically on 
January 25, 2012, the TRB issued a Resolution and Order in which it designated Luz M. Rios as Official Examiner to oversee 
the Choice compliant. PRDSMF ¶ 67; Jan. 25, 2012 Resolution and Order at 2, Puerto Rico Cable Acquisition Corp. d/b/a 
Choice Cable TV v. Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Inc. [**139] , JRT-2011-Q-0886 (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 22) (ECF No. 272). Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to PRTC, the Court affirms PRTC's qualification and adjusts the record 
accordingly."
1069,104," PRTC's paragraph 12 originally stated: ""OneLink and its owners recognized that PRTC's entry into video would reduce 
OneLink's market share, revenues, and monopoly profits, causing OneLink to fetch a lower price."" PSMF ¶ 12. OneLink [**140]  
denied paragraph 12 on grounds that: [t]here is no evidence that OneLink was a monopolist . . . or that PRTC's entry into IPTV video would have any effect on 
OneLink's business. . . . OneLink did believe that because of many years of underinvestment by PRTC . . . [it would] not be "
1070,," capable of providing a [sic] Internet Protocol Television service or high speed Internet service that would seriously compete 
with OneLink's service. DRPSMF ¶ 11. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court agrees that the August 19, 2010 emails 
cited by PRTC do not support the proposition that ""OneLink and its owners recognized that PRTC's entry into video would 
reduce OneLink's market share, revenues, and monopoly profits."" August 9, 2010 Marcus and Volpert Emails (Carson. Decl. Ex. 
27) (ECF No. 248). However, upon review of the 2010 emails, the Court determines that the evidence does support the 
assertion that Barry Volpert and Jeffrey Marcus — Managing Partners of Crestview Partners and owners of OneLink — 
perceived that PRTC posed a potential risk to OneLink's sales price. Id. As such, the Court alters the language of paragraph 12 
to better reflect the record evidence."
1070,105," PRTC's paragraph [**141]  13 originally stated: Eric Zinterhofer, one of the lead negotiators for the buyers, explained to a frustrated OneLink that the offer reduction was 
based upon questions around representations OneLink had made early on regarding ""performance, the situation with Claro, 
and the state of your network."" The lower price, Mr. Zinterhofer explained, was driven by ""Claro's timing of entering the 
market"" and the fact that OneLink's budget projections were based on ""uncompetitive pricing"" — which could not be 
sustained in the face of PRTC's entry into the market. Mr. Zinterhofer advised the sellers: ""don't look a gift horse in the 
mouth. PSMF ¶ 13. OneLink denied this statement, first arguing that ""[t]here is no evidence that OneLink was frustrated; instead, it is 
Mr. Zinterhofer, not OneLink, who in the quoted email is frustrated."" DPRSMF ¶ 13. The Court agrees with OneLink, and 
removed the use of ""frustrated"" from the statement. Jan. 26, 2012 Zinterhofer Email (Carson Decl. Ex. 28) (ECF No. 248). 
OneLink further argues ""[a]s Mr. Zinterhofer testified, he was trying to negotiate a lower purchase price for OneLink in early 2012 
. . . . There is no evidence that he did so based on any 'representations' that [**142]  OneLink had made about [PRTC]. Rather . 
. . he presented a number of 'arguments,' for why the price should be lower . . . ."" DPRSMF ¶ 13; Zinterhofer Dep. at 67:20-72:3 
(Grube Decl. Ex. 32) (ECF No. 264). The Court agrees and adjusts the record to reflect that (1) there is no evidence that 
OneLink made any representations about PRTC and (2) Mr. Zinterhofer made a number of arguments as to why OneLink's 
purchase price should be lower."
1070,106," PRTC's paragraph 14 stated: A potential buyer would certainly reduce its offer price to compensate for the added risk of acquiring a company that had 
breached its debt covenants, or worse, could wait until the covenants were breached in the hopes of securing a lower price 
from the target's debt holders as opposed to equity holders once the property transferred back. PSMF ¶ 14. OneLink denied the statement, asserting that it is ""vague and generalized . . . opinion, not a fact . . . and therefore 
improper. . . . It is supported by only an out-of-court statement made in an unverified expert report, which is inadmissible hearsay 
to the extent that it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted."" DRPSMF ¶ 14. The Court affirms OneLink's denial 
and [**143]  removes PRTC's paragraph 14 from the record. Fed. R. Evid. 802; D.P.R. LOC. R. 56(e)."
1070,107," PRTC denied OneLink's paragraph 65, citing PSAMF ¶¶ 15, 16, and 18. PRDSMF ¶ 65. PRTC's paragraph 15, 16, and 18 
state: All of the Board members who OneLink identified as having knowledge about its history of petitioning — CEO Ron 
Dorchester, Gov. George Pataki, Tyler Zachem and Barrett Gilmer of MidOcean Partners, and Jeffrey Marcus and Brian "
1071,," Cassidy of Crestview Partners — had little to no recollection of OneLink's petitioning [**144]  history, let alone the bases for 
OneLink's filings. PSAMF ¶ 15. The OneLink Board members allegedly responsible for authorizing the filing of OneLink's intervention petitions, including 
CEO Ron Dorchester, Gov. George Pataki, Barrett Gilmer, and Brian Cassidy, could not recall whether OneLink had filed 
intervention requests and appeals, who approved these filings, what benefits or rights OneLink would have gained had it 
succeeded, or the basis for the intervention requests. PSAMF ¶ 16. Naji Khoury, OneLink's Rule 30(b)(6) witness on the topic of OneLink's sham litigation, could not identify the basis for 
OneLink's belief that it had the right to intervene in a TRB franchise proceeding other than OneLink's inchoate desire for a 
""forum"" to hear its ""concerns"" about cross-subsidization and illegal construction — concerns which the TRB was already 
aware of and had specifically discussed in its October 2008 order denying the first franchise application. PSAMF ¶ 18. OneLink denied all three paragraphs as unsupported, asserting numerous objections and arguments. DRPSAMF 
¶¶ 15-16, 18. First, addressing PRTC's objection to OneLink's paragraph 65, even when viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to 
PRTC, [**145]  the Court overrules PRTC's denial. OneLink provided myriad examples from its Board of Directors' testimony 
that: (1) they believed PRTC had engaged in illegal pre-franchise construction and intended to employ cross-subsidization, (2) 
they sought a fair and level playing field, and (3) they believed PRTC's application had multiple deficiencies. See DSMF ¶ 65. 
Moreover, the statements PRTC provides in support of its denial — PSAMF ¶¶ 15-16, 18 — either are unresponsive to 
OneLink's paragraph 65 (e.g., ""All of the Board members . . . had little to no recollection of OneLink's petitioning history"" 
(PSAMF ¶ 15)) or are refuted by the testimony provided in support of paragraph 65 (e.g., ""The OneLink Board members . . . 
could not recall . . . the basis for the intervention requests"" (PSAMF ¶ 16)). Second, regarding PRTC's paragraphs 15, 16, and 18, OneLink broadly denies all three statements on the grounds that: PRTC responds, not with contrary evidence as required by Rule 56, but by relying on what it characterizes as the OneLink 
(non-lawyer) Board members' failure to recall certain details about OneLink's legal arguments from years earlier. 
Specifically, unable to dispute the positions summarized [**146]  in OneLink's Material Fact No. 65 or the testimony 
supporting that fact, PRTC in this purported statement [PSAMF ¶ 15], as well as in [PSAMF ¶¶ 16, 18], points to the 
inability of individual directors, at certain points in their depositions (and often in response to vague or otherwise 
objectionable questions), to recall the precise details of specific petitions. None of PRTC's claims regarding the Board 
members' memories is material, nor provides any affirmative evidence of sham, which it is after all PRTC's burden to prove. DRPSAMF ¶ 15. Reviewing the record in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court affirms OneLink's denials to PRTC's 
paragraphs 15, 16, and 18. In addition to finding merit in the issues raised by OneLink in the above quote, the Court finds ample 
support in the record evidence for OneLink's arguments, including: (1) that the mere lack of recollection does not create an issue 
of disputed fact for summary judgment purposes, (2) not answering a question on advice of counsel on the basis of privileged 
attorney-client communications does not indicate a lack of recall, (3) PRTC selectively excerpts questions and answers while 
ignoring surrounding testimony, and (4) [**147]  PRTC's claims regarding the inability of the Board members to recall specific 
issues are often incorrect and unsupported by record evidence. See DRPSAMF ¶¶ 15-16, 18. As such, PRTC's statements of 
additional material fact 15, 16, and 18 are excluded from the record."
1071,108," PRTC's paragraph 20 originally stated: ""OneLink understood that having a concern about something did not necessarily give 
a party the right to file a complaint."" PSAMF ¶ 20. OneLink denied this statement as unsupported, arguing that ""PRTC grossly 
misstates Mr. Khoury's testimony."" DRPSAMF ¶ 20. The Court modifies the record by providing the verbatim language cited by 
PRTC. "
1072,109," OneLink admitted PRTC's paragraph 17, but qualified it as incomplete, providing record evidence from depositions of Mr. 
Cassidy that went ""beyond generalities in explaining how OneLink pursued its petitioning activities, including intervention, as well 
as the bases for those actions."" DRPSAMF ¶ 17. Reviewing the evidence in the light [**150]  most favorable to OneLink, the 
Court includes this additional record evidence to provide adequate context for PRTC's paragraph 17, including depositional 
testimony from Mr. Cassidy regarding OneLink's concerns and legal strategy."
1072,110," PRTC's paragraph 22 stated: ""OneLink's Board of Directors never discussed whether OneLink needed to be an intervenor in 
order to participate in the franchise proceeding."" PSAMF ¶ 22. OneLink denied this statement as unsupported, citing record 
evidence that supports the contention that the OneLink Board discussed the issue of whether to file to seek intervenor status. 
DRPSAMF ¶ 22; Dorchester Dep. at 56:24-57:5 (Grube Decl. 2 Ex. 5) (ECF No. 284); Cassidy Dep. at 189:15-190:5 (Grube 
Decl. Ex. 28) (ECF No. 264). OneLink also argues that PRTC's paragraph 22 does not create a factal dispute, as the record 
evidence does not support PRTC's assertion that OneLink's Board of Directors never discussed the need to be an intervenor 
(""The testimony cited by PRTC does not create a fact dispute because Governor Pataki testified that he could not recall, not that 
it did not happen""). DRPSAMF ¶ 22; Pataki Dep. 42:11-18 (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 1). The Court upholds OneLink's denial [**151]  of 
PRTC's paragraph 22 as unsupported and excludes the statement from the record."
1072,111," PRTC's paragraph 23 stated: ""OneLink did not rely on advice of counsel to determine whether it had a claim under the Cable 
Act."" PSMAF ¶ 23. OneLink denied the statement as unsupported, arguing that it ""obviously relied on its lawyers to provide legal 
counsel regarding its claims and to prepare and file documents in the proceedings at issue, including in federal court with regard 
to the Cable Act."" DRPSAMF ¶ 22. Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court affirms OneLink's 
denial and excludes PRTC's paragraph 23 from the record. PRTC's use of Mr. Cassidy's statement to assert that OneLink did 
not rely on counsel to determine whether they had a viable claim under the Cable Act fails to account for the record evidence of 
other OneLink Board member's testimony that asserts otherwise. Id. (citing Pataki Dep. 23:25-24:5, 24:23-25:10; Cassidy Dep. 
57:3-16, 88:16-23, 89:3-13, 189:15-191:20, 192:8-18, 192:21-193:18, 194:20-195:10). Reading Mr. Cassidy's answer that ""[w]e 
knew that [pre-franchise construction] was illegal, and we satisfied ourselves because we knew it was illegal"" in the [**152]  
context of his deposition reveals his answer was given for the broader assertion that OneLink's Board did not require legal 
advice to make the determination that PRTC's pre-franchise building was illegal. Cassidy Dep. 90:3-13 (Eloranto Decl. Ex. 5) 
(ECF No. 272). There is no factual dispute."
1072,112," PRTC's paragraph 2 states: ""OneLink ""does not assert, nor will it assert at trial, that OneLink relied on the advice of counsel 
relating to the merits of, or whether to file, any action, opposition, petition, lawsuit, or other request for relief relating to PRTC's 
franchise applications."" PSAMF ¶ 2. OneLink admitted this statement, contending: [OneLink] is not asserting an advice-of-counsel defense, which means that OneLink is not relying on confidential attorney-
client advice and communications relating thereto to prove its good faith. Of course, this does not mean that OneLink may 
not defend the legal arguments that it advanced in the underlying proceedings and that PRTC alleges were frivolous, nor 
does it prohibit OneLink from citing or referring to the publicly filed briefs and motions from those proceedings. DRPSAMF ¶ 2. The Court notes that OneLink is not asserting an advice-of-counsel defense. [**153] "
1073,113," PRTC's paragraph 1 originally stated: ""OneLink Board member and former New York Governor George Pataki testified that 
the OneLink Board ""always"" had the ""understand[ing] that ultimately [PRTC was] entitled to a license."" PSAMF ¶ 1. OneLink 
admitted the statement, but argued it was not material, asserting OneLink's opposition to PRTC's franchise application was 
because ""PRTC had not complied with the procedures for obtaining that franchise and had otherwise not complied with the law, 
not because PRTC could never be entitled to a license."" DRPSAMF ¶ 1. To illustrate this point, OneLink provided the full 
testimony given by Governor Pataki that PRTC relied on for its statement. Pataki Dep at 31:16-33:4 (Grube Decl. Ex. 30) (ECF 
No. 264). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to OneLink, the Court finds PRTC's statement incomplete and to 
provide clarity on the issue expands the record to include the full testimony of Governor Pataki."
1073,114," PRTC's paragraph 25 originally stated: ""In June, 2012, CEO Ron Dorchester began to question the wisdom of continuing the 
(sic) file sham litigation: 'up to you folks but I'd rather just save the $450k rather than spend it in a half-effort that cannot hope to 
succeed.'"" PSMF¶ 25. OneLink denied this statement, contending: [a]s of June 2012, the owners of OneLink had signed an agreement to sell OneLink to two buyers, Liberty Global and 
Searchlight Capital Partners. The purchase agreement included a negotiated number, defined as a ""cap,"" on the amount of 
all legal fees that could be incurred by OneLink between (i) a period of time prior to the signing of the agreement and (ii) the 
closing of the transaction. As long as the total amount of legal fees incurred by OneLink during that period did not exceed 
the negotiated ""cap,"" the purchase price of the transaction would be unaffected. If, however, the total amount of the legal 
fees incurred by OneLink during that period on all legal matters [**155]  (not just the PRTC franchise proceeding) exceeded 
the ""cap,"" then the purchase price would be adjusted downward to reflect the excess above the cap. As of June 2012, the 
amount left before the negotiated ""cap"" would be reached was $450,000. At that time, OneLink was still pursuing appeals 
relating to its effort to intervene in the PRTC franchise proceeding or, in the alternative, seek a reconsideration of the TRB's 
grant of the franchise application. . . . Mr. Dorchester in that email communicated to OneLink's Board of Directors that, in 
his view, it would take more than $450,000 to cover all of OneLink's legal expenses between that point and the closing 
(including but not limited to legal expenses relating to the PRTC franchise application). Mr. Dorchester understood that the 
Board of Directors would not allow Mr. Dorchester to exceed the negotiated cap since doing so would reduce the already-
negotiated purchase price. As a result, Mr. Dorchester told the Board that OneLink should not spend any more money on 
lawyers relating to the PRTC franchise application since OneLink would not have enough money to complete the appeals 
and, if successful, the intervention that would follow and [**156]  remain below the cap given all of OneLink's other ongoing 
legal expenditures. DRPSMF ¶ 25. Viewing the evidence in the light most hospitable to OneLink, the Court finds merit to OneLink's qualifications to 
Mr. Dorchester's email and amends the record to provide more context to the quoted text. See Dorchester Dep. at 116:21-127:3 
(Carson Decl. Ex. 30) (ECF No. 248); Gilmer Dep. at 51:4-52:2, 87:15-88:16 (Grube Decl. Ex. 27) (ECF No. 264). "
1074,115," PRTC's paragraphs 1, 24, 52, 108, 129, 153, and 156 from its initial statement of material facts (ECF No. 247), as well as 
paragraph 14 from its additional statement of material facts (ECF No. 273), contain numerous quotations from legal memoranda 
and orders written by the TRB. In the interest of brevity, the Court has summarized PSMF ¶¶ 1, 24, 52, 108, 129, 153, 156 and 
PSAMF ¶ 14 in the record. For example, in its paragraph 1, PRTC stated: As the TRB would later characterize it, ""threatened by competition from [PRTC], [OneLink] . . . engaged in a four-year 
campaign to prevent PRTC from entering the marketplace."" PSMF ¶ 1 (quoting Jan. 25, 2012 TRB Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Inj. Relief at 1, San Juan Cable LLC d/b/a OneLink Commc'ns v. 
The Telecomm. Regulatory Bd. of P.R., 3:09-cv-02152-DRD (ECF No. 248) (Carson Decl. Ex. 19)). Related quotations as 
statements of material fact from legal memoranda drafted by the TRB are provided in PSMF ¶ 108 and PSAMF ¶ 14. Statements 
from orders issued by the TRB are found in PSMF ¶¶ 24, 52, 129, 153, and 156. OneLink denied PSMF ¶1, maintaining that ""[t]his out-of-court [**158]  statement by the TRB, excerpted from a legal brief by a 
non party in a different litigation whose interests were aligned with PRTC and against OneLink . . . [and] is inadmissible hearsay 
to the extent that it is being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (Fed. R. Evid. 802). Inadmissible evidence may not 
be considered on summary judgment."" DRPSMF ¶ 1. OneLink raised similar objections to PSMF ¶¶ 24, 52, 108, 129, 153, 156 
and PSAMF ¶ 14. Rule 56 allows OneLink to ""object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be 
admissible in evidence."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Thus, ""inadmissible evidence may not be considered"" for summary judgment.

2012) (explaining that only admissible evidence and evidence that could be used at trial may be considered for summary 
judgment). At oral argument OneLink agreed with the Court that the TRB's orders and decisions, as well as its reasoning in reaching those 
decisions, were admissible evidence. Tr. at 81-82. Additionally, OneLink agreed that findings and determinations by the TRB, 
such as that OneLink's status as an intervenor was a ""tough"" or ""novel"" legal issue, can be considered by this Court. Id. at 83-
84. As applied to the TRB's order and [**159]  the judicial opinions in this case, this is most certainly correct. See Fed. R. Evid. 
803(8); Olsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d 52, 63 (1st Cir. 1999). The Court agrees with OneLink that the TRB statements quoted in PSMF ¶¶ 1, 108 and PSAMF ¶ 14 are inadmissible hearsay if 
offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Once the TRB stepped out of its role as adjudicator and into a role as advocate, its 
written arguments are not admissible for their truth under Rule 803(8)(A). Nevertheless, these statements are admissible to show OneLink's knowledge that the TRB believed that OneLink's petitioning 
was abusing the judicial process with the intent to delay PRTC's franchise application approval in order to preserve its monopoly. 
See PSMF ¶¶ 1,108 and PSAMF ¶ 14. The TRB's agency findings and orders in PSMF ¶¶ 24, 52, 129, 153, and 156 are admissible for the truth of the matters under 
Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8)(A). See Davignon v. Hodgson, 524 F.3d 91, 112-13 (1st Cir. 2008) (affirming the trial court

1124,1," On November 24, 2015, the Court ruled on CAISO's motion to dismiss the original complaint, which was largely granted. (See 
Doc. No. 23.) In that order, the [*3]  Court exhaustively summarized the case's factual background. The Court assumes

with respect to the instant order. "
1125,2," IID alleges that MIC has nothing to do with the allocation of interstate transmission capacity, but rather, merely acts as an 
""accounting mechanism."" (Doc. No. 26 ¶¶ 84, 86-87.) However, as [*6]  explained in detail below, the Court finds these newly 
added allegations irreconcilable with other allegations contained in the FAC and the original complaint, as well as with IID's 
overarching theory of injury. See infra pp. 10-11 and note 6. "
1128,3," The Court notes that neither party in TANC can be construed as a customer of the other, yet the Ninth Circuit readily found the 
filed rate doctrine applicable to bar the plaintiff's suit. See TANC, 295 F.3d at 923 (describing the relationship as a contractual 
agreement whereby the parties jointly constructed and interconnected with the electricity intertie in dispute)."
1128,4," IID points to no case law that has applied the competitor exception to a claim challenging or seeking enforcement of a tariff filed 
with a federal regulatory commission, nor has the Court found any. IID's reliance on Wah Chang v. Duke Energy Trading & 
Marketing, L.L.C., 507 F.3d 1222, 1226 (9th Cir. 2007), and County of Stanislaus v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., 114 F.3d 858, 
866 (9th Cir. 1997), does not aid its position given that the Ninth Circuit gave short shrift to the exception in finding it did not 
apply in those cases."
1128,5," IID cites a letter from CAISO to FERC, in which CAISO states certain proposed amendments to its tariff concerning MIC 
assignment ""do not affect physical transmission capability of the ISO Controlled Grid, transmission rights, or the manner in which 
transmission service is obtained under the ISO Tariff."" Letter from CAISO, to the Honorable Philis J. Posey, Acting Secretary, 
Federal 
Energy 
Regulatory 
Commission

(Mar. 
22, 
2007), 
available 
at http://elibrary.ferc.gov/idmws/file_list.asp?document_id=13489719 . The Court finds this letter to be the proper subject of judicial 
notice because its source, FERC's website, ""cannot reasonably be questioned."" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). The Court therefore takes 
judicial notice of the letter."
1128,6," The Court is cognizant of its duty to accept as true the FAC's factual allegations. However, this duty does not extend to 
allegations that are implausible in light of earlier iterations of the plaintiff's complaint. See, e.g., Fasugbe v. Willms, No. CIV. 
2:10-2320 WBS KJN, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56569, 2011 WL 2119128, at *5 (E.D. Cal. May 26, 2011) (stating that while 
""plaintiffs may alter their allegations in an amended complaint, [] the court may properly consider the plausibility of the FAC in 
light of the prior allegations""). In its original complaint, IID stated [*19]  that MIC is ""the maximum amount of power that can be 
safely and reliably imported from one BAA to another BAA."" (Doc. No. 1 ¶ 94.) IID further alleged that ""CAISO will not allow IID 
to pass additional energy over either bridge,"" and without this permission from CAISO, ""IID cannot provide existing and potential 
customers electric transmission service that originates within [] IID's BAA and terminates within or travels across CAISO's BAA . 
. . ."" (Id. ¶¶ 4, 90.) Furthermore, the allegation that MIC has nothing to do with transmission capacity is belied by other 
allegations in the FAC and IID's theory of its case altogether. For example, IID alleges that ""the amount of Expanded MIC acts 
as a restriction in the flow of electricity from IID to CAISO's territory."" (Doc. No. 26 ¶ 59.) IID further alleges that ""renewable 
energy generators within IID's BAA [] cannot transmit energy across the[] two connection points or interties [connecting IID's 
BAA to CAISO's] to [customers] within CAISO's BAA unless CAISO assigns the requisite amount of [] Expanded [MIC] to each 
intertie."" (Id. ¶ 178.) In light of these allegations, it is simply implausible that MIC has no effect on transmission allocation. [*20] "
1129,7," CAISO asserts the Court should apply the doctrine of primary jurisdiction because [*22]  the Court will ultimately be faced with 
complex issues when determining whether CAISO complied with its tariff. (Doc. No. 28-1 at 18-20.) However, the Ninth Circuit 
has made clear that the doctrine is used to route only ""threshold decision[s] as to certain issues to the agency charged with 
primary responsibility for governmental supervision or control of the particular industry or activity involved."" Gen. Dynamics 
Corp., 828 F.2d at 1362. In the context of a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court ""must accept as true [IID's] 
allegation that [CAISO] violated [its t]ariff. For that reason, the 'threshold decision' which [CAISO] would have [the Court] refer to 
[FERC] must necessarily be resolved in favor of [IID]."" Cost Mgmt. Servs., Inc., 99 F.3d at 949. "
1130,8," CAISO conceded as much [*25]  at the hearing and in its nonopposition to IID's request to respond to CAISO's exhibit. (See 
Doc. No. 46 at 2 (""IID continues to focus on the fact that it is not regulated by FERC. . . . That fact is not contested . . . ."" 
(emphasis added)).) "
1131,9," At the hearing on this matter, CAISO argued that its tariff purportedly governs ""unscheduled overflow"" onto IID's grid. (Doc. No. 
42.) Be that as it may, but CAISO ignores the fact that the vast majority of IID's allegations related to CAISO's use of IID's grid 
relates to its knowing, unauthorized use. (Doc. No. 26 ¶¶ 9.C, 173(g), [*27]  193.) Accepting these allegations as true, CAISO's 
use of IID's grid goes beyond the mere occasional and accidental overflow. Accordingly, the Court finds, for purposes of the 
instant motion, that the FAC's allegations take IID's state law claims outside the reach of CAISO's tariff. Because the exhibit 
CAISO provided the Court and IID at the hearing does little to change the IID-favored outcome on this issue, the Court DENIES 
AS MOOT IID's ex parte motion for an opportunity to respond to the exhibit. (Doc. No. 44.) "

1147,1, YETI does not dispute this interpretation in responding to the Jacobsen' motion to dismiss. 
1152,1," Although Genpak was a defendant in this case, it is not an appellee. Genpak settled with Evergreen prior to summary 
judgment. "
1153,2," The facts in this case are taken from the defendants' Local Rule 56.1 Joint Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, the 
Plaintiff's Corrected Local Rule 56.1 Statement of [**3]  Material Facts, and, when appropriate, the record. The defendants argue 
we should accept all of their facts as true because Evergreen failed to file a paragraph-by-paragraph response, instead providing 
its own counterstatement of the facts. Massachusetts Local Rule 56.1 does not require paragraph-by-paragraph rebuttal. See 
McGrath v. Tavares, 757 F.3d 20, 26 n.10 (1st Cir. 2014). It is sufficient for the party opposing summary judgment to file a 
statement of facts it believes are still under dispute. See id. (finding plaintiff complied with Local Rule 56.1 by filing own 
statement of disputed material facts because ""[t]he District of Massachusetts simply requires '[the] party opposing [a motion for 
summary judgment] . . . include a concise statement of the material facts of record as to which it is contended that there exists a 
genuine issue to be tried, with page references to affidavits, depositions and other documentation.'"" (alteration in original) 
(quoting D. Mass. L. R. 56.1)). We follow the district court's approach of accepting any of the defendants' facts Evergreen fails to 
contest, but consider any evidence Evergreen has cited as creating a dispute and draw all reasonable inferences in Evergreen's 
favor. See Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2003)."
1153,3," Prior to 2005, Evergreen operated using a slightly different business model with Boston Public Schools. Participating schools 
collected their polystyrene products and processed them into resin using Evergreen's equipment. Evergreen then purchased this 
resin and sold it to polystyrene converters who (with Evergreen's assistance) used the pellets to make new polystyrene products."
1153,4," Also starting in 2006, Evergreen collected trays from several other southeastern United States school districts as well as the 
Publix grocery store [**6]  chain. None of these customers ever purchased products made using Evergreen's recycled resin. "
1154,5," Despite the savings Gwinnett Schools received from having Evergreen remove its trays, it did not factor this in to its 
calculations when selecting a bid. Gwinnett Schools officials explained that they were obligated to select the lowest bid."
1154,6," Before the district court, Evergreen alleged an alternative starting date, March 18, 2005, for the conspiracy. The district court 
rejected this argument and Evergreen has not advanced it on appeal. We therefore focus our analysis exclusively on the May 
31, 2007, conference call conspiracy claim."
1154,7," In both proposals, Evergreen requested that the Plastics Group help Evergreen with the start-up costs for a Los Angeles 
recycling facility and financing upgrades to the Norcross facility. One proposal, totaling $500,000, would also have committed the 
Plastics Group's members to helping Evergreen with operating and maintenance costs as well as to paying commissions on 
products sold containing Evergreen's resin. The other proposal, totaling $3.1 million, would have committed the Plastics Group's 
members to purchasing all of the recycled resin Evergreen produced. [**9]  Forrest later separately sent a third proposal that 
requested a $500,000 subsidy and a commitment to purchase a set amount of Evergreen's resin. "
1156,8, Dow Chemical is also a member of the Plastics Group. Evergreen did not name it as a defendant to this suit. 
1157,9," We accept Evergreen's contention that a reasonable factfinder could conclude the article was misleading. One of PDR's 
founders, Tom Preston, stated at his deposition that the article portrayed PDR as further along in its operations than it was at the 
time. Nonetheless, because Evergreen cannot tie this article to the Plastics Group, let alone cite any facts showing the 
misrepresentations were deliberate, we do not find the fact it was misleading supports an inference of conspiracy. "
1158,10," We decline to address the defendants' argument that Evergreen's conspiracy claim is economically irrational, which would, in 
turn, require Evergreen to present stronger conspiracy evidence. See Matsushita, 475 U.S. at 596-97 (""Lack of motive bears on 
the range of permissible conclusions that might be drawn from ambiguous evidence: [**21]  if petitioners had no rational 
economic motive to conspire, and if their conduct is consistent with other, equally plausible explanations, the conduct does not 
give rise to an inference of conspiracy.""). We acknowledge the defendants' point that driving a viable recycler such as Evergreen 
out of business would be a risky proposition given that some local governments could respond by banning polystyrene outright. 
Nonetheless, there may be a colorable argument that the defendants feared that local governments would instead mandate the 
use of recycled products, and would thus wish to prevent any expensive recycling methods from becoming viable."
1158,11," We also note that Evergreen received complaints from Dolco before the conspiracy allegedly began, weakening any inference 
that these complaints were post hoc justifications."
1158,12," Evergreen also contends that Reilly referred Forrest's funding proposals to the Plastics Group as a ""way of maintaining group 
course of action."" In light of the resin quality issues, however, Reilly may have been acting [**23]  independently, referring 
Forrest because Genpak did not want to bear the investment risk alone. Evergreen has not presented evidence that tends to 
exclude this possibility of independent action. "
1159,13," We note that the concentrated nature of the polystyrene market falls within the former category of evidence of an 
anticompetitive market."
1159,14," This evidence consists of (1) a 2005 article posted on the ACC's website stating polystyrene recycling was infeasible; (2) 
minutes from a March 18, 2005, Plastics Group meeting asking whether the industry could ""win out"" against its critics without 
having to recycle; and (3) representatives of Pactiv and Dart standing up during the middle of a 2005 Plastics Group meeting 
and stating they did not want to recycle. The district court found both the minutes and Forrest's statements regarding the 2005 
meeting inadmissible. We agree that the notes are not subject to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)'s business records 
exception because they were not authenticated. We also agree with the district court's conclusion that Forrest's statements 
about what Patterson heard at the 2005 Plastics Group meeting are being used for the truth of the matter asserted and do not fit 
into any hearsay exception. "
1160,15," Evergreen attempts to corroborate Forrest's affidavit by citing the deposition testimony of Eastern Bag representative Kenneth 
Rosenberg. During the deposition, Rosenberg was shown a copy of Evergreen's complaint, which stated that ""Solo's president 
and CEO, Bob Korzenski, told Eastern Bag and Paper's president, Meredith Reuben, that he had been told by his people not to 
work with Evergreen or Michael Forrest."" Rosenberg stated he ""remember[ed] [Korzenski] saying something similar, or that they 
didn't want to work with him or something."" Rosenberg's testimony is unhelpful because it is also hearsay."
1160,16," This evidence consists of (1) Forrest's affidavit stating that Patterson told Forrest that Dolco ""did not want to compete against 
Pactiv"" after a November 2005 meeting among Dolco, Evergreen, and Sysco; (2) a December 2005 draft proposal to Sysco that 
stated Dolco was not in the ""Pactiv style business"" and if it was, Pactiv ""could run [Dolco] underground with ease""; and (3) the 
deposition testimony of Dolco's Director of Operations Gaffe Villegas, acknowledging that Pactiv was larger than Dolco and ""a 
big company can do a lot of harm to a smaller company."" We note that the latter two statements, when read in context, actually 
create an inference against conspiracy. Both the proposal and Villegas state that Dolco could not compete against Pactiv on 
cost or volume -- before mentioning Pactiv, the proposal states that ""the 'Earth Plus' products give both [Evergreen] and Dolco 
the opportunity to provide environmentally responsible packaging along with some stock product sales,"" suggesting that Dolco 
viewed recycling as a way to differentiate its products to successfully compete against Pactiv. Even if any of this evidence [**30]  
was admissible, we also note that Evergreen fails to cite any evidence contradicting statements made by Dolco representatives 
that the Earth Plus line fell through because Sysco backed out."
1160,17," The district court declined to accept this contention as true because the only evidence cited by Evergreen was Forrest's 
affidavit and an e-mail saying Forrest told someone Genpak retracted its bid. This conclusion impermissibly weighs evidence at 
the summary judgment stage. HN11[
] Although Matsushita places limits on the inferences courts may draw from ambiguous evidence, it does not change the summary judgment standard that courts ""may neither evaluate the credibility of witnesses nor 
weigh the evidence."" Hicks v. Johnson, 755 F.3d 738, 743 (1st Cir. 2014). "

1164,6," This question arises from a Memorandum Opinion entered by this Court on March 8, 2016, which denied Defendants' Motion 
for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Parens Patriae Claims. "
1165,7," This question arises from a Memorandum Opinion entered by this Court on April 18, 2016, which denied Defendants' Joint 
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the Attorney General's Foreign Commerce Claims and granted in part the State's 
Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Antitrust Law's Domestic-Injury Exception."
1165,8," The State also objected to Defendants' initial framing of each of the questions. With respect to the Attorney General's parens 
patriae authority, Defendants proposed a broader question in their Reply brief, which presumably addresses the State's 
concerns as to the narrowness of the issue, and which the Court considers here. With respect to the domestic effects issue, 
Defendants also acceded to a broader question, and the Court has fashioned terminology which fairly encompasses all of the 
issues considered in its Memorandum Opinion of April 18, 2016. The Court also notes that, as the State pointed out in its 
Response brief, when an Appellate Court accepts a question of law for appeal pursuant to Rule 308 the ""interests of judicial 
economy and the need to reach an equitable result oblige"" the Appellate Court to consider the propriety of the entire order giving 
rise to the question on appeal. Townsend v. Sears, Roeuck & Co., 227 Ill.2d 147, 153 (2007) (internal citation omitted); Resp. 1 
at 12. "
1169,9," Cited by this Court at page 23 of its Memorandum Opinion and Order of March 8, 2016, as supporting the Court's conclusion 
that an amendment reducing a statute of limitations for recovery in a civil suit is ""procedural in character."""
1169,10," Section 4 is described by the Court as ""a clear legislative directive as to the temporal reach of statutory amendments and 
repeals when none is otherwise specified: those that are procedural may be applied retroactively, while those that are 
substantive may not."" Id. (internal citations omitted). "
1171,11," The Court also notes that the mere potential for a procedural amendment — which the Illinois Supreme Court has clearly 
indicated includes a change in a statute of limitations (see page 16, supra) — to hypothetically apply to a litigant with a vested 
statute of limitations defense in some unknown set of circumstances at some unknown point in time cannot reasonably be 
calculated by any court. This is particularly true given that, as the Court in Diocese of Dallas noted, a statute of limitations bar ""is 
an affirmative defense which a defendant may, in its sole discretion, assert or waive."" Id. at 414 (internal citation omitted). To the 
extent that Counsel Wick's argument that an amendment must apply in all cases or in none implies that the Court would be 
required to undertake such a calculation, it is further indication that the Court's reading of Diocese of Dallas is the more accurate 
one. "
1172,12," This assertion is the subject of a pending Motion for Partial Summary Judgment by the State which is still pending before the

1185,1," The facts in this Opinion are drawn from the trial transcript (""Tr."") and the trial exhibits (""Ex.""), unless otherwise indicated. For convenience, the Court will refer to Grossman's brief in support of the RICO Motion as ""Def. RICO Br."" (Dkt. #194),

(Defendants did not submit any opposition to these motions.) Similarly, the Court will refer to Plaintiffs' brief in support of the 
Fee Motion as ""Pl. Fee Br."" (Dkt #190); Grossman's opposition to the Fee Motion as ""Def. Fee Opp."" (Dkt #205); and 
Plaintiffs' reply as ""Pl. Fee Reply"" (Dkt. #206). Finally, the Court will refer to Plaintiffs' response to the Court's request for 
supplemental briefing as ""Pl. Supp. Br."" (Dkt. #219) and Defendant's response to the Court's request as ""Def. Supp. Br."" 
(Dkt. #220). "
1188,2," The funds in the IBIS account are now the subject of an interpleader proceeding in this Court, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v.

1188,3," Because there may have been some delay in processing Grossman's papers through the District's Pro Se Office, the Court will 
presume that his papers were filed on the dates provided in the documents themselves, rather than the dates appearing on the 
docket sheet. "
1193,4," Some courts in other jurisdictions have suggested that the ""focus"" of § 1341 is the use of the U.S. mails. See, e.g., United 
States v. Coffman, 771 F. Supp. 2d 735, 738-39 (E.D. Ky. 2011). But this Court is not convinced that the use of the U.S. mails, 
without more, can be considered conduct relevant to the ""focus"" of the mail fraud statute. As its title indicates, § 1341, is aimed 
at ""frauds and swindles."" To be sure, the statute addresses a limited set of ""frauds and swindles"" — namely, those involving the 
U.S. mails. However, in singling out this type of fraud, Congress did not shift the focus of the statute away from fraud. Rather, 
Congress narrowed the focus of the statute from all fraud to fraud facilitated by the U.S. mails. Thus, the use of U.S. mails is a 
necessary but not sufficient condition for criminal liability under § 1341. Cf. Petroleos Mexicanos v. Conproca S.A. de C.V., 572 
F. App'x 60, 61 (2d. Cir. 2014) (summary order) (finding no domestic violation of the wire fraud statute despite the fact that U.S. 
wires were used to further a fraud). "
1195,5," See also RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty.,     U.S.    , 136 S. Ct. 2090, 2109-10, 195 L. Ed. 2d 476 (2016): There is good reason not to interpret § 1964(c) to cover [**36]  foreign injuries just because the Clayton Act does so. When 
we held in [Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308, 98 S. Ct. 584, 54 L. Ed. 2d 563 (1978)] that the Clayton Act 
allows recovery for foreign injuries, we relied first and foremost on the fact that the Clayton Act's definition of ""person"" — 
which in turn defines who may sue under that Act — ""explicitly includes 'corporations and associations existing under or 
authorized by ... the laws of any foreign country.'"" 434 U.S. at 313, 98 S. Ct. 584; see 15 U.S.C. § 12. RICO lacks the 
language that the Pfizer Court found critical. See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(3). To the extent that the Pfizer Court cited other factors 
that might apply to § 1964(c), they were not sufficient in themselves to show that the provision has extraterritorial effect. For 
example, the Pfizer Court, writing before we honed our extraterritoriality jurisprudence in Morrison and Kiobel, reasoned 
that Congress ""[c]learly ... did not intend to make the [Clayton Act's] treble-damages remedy available only to consumers in 
our own country"" because ""the antitrust laws extend to trade 'with foreign nations' as well as among the several States of 
the Union."" 434 U.S. at 313-314, 98 S. Ct. 584. But we have emphatically rejected reliance on such language, holding that 
""'even statutes ... that expressly refer to ""foreign commerce"" do not apply abroad.'"" Morrison, 561 U.S. at 262-263, 130 S. 
Ct. 2869. This reasoning [**37]  also fails to distinguish between extending substantive antitrust law to foreign conduct and 
extending a private right of action to foreign injuries, two separate issues that, as we have explained, raise distinct 
extraterritoriality problems. See supra, at 2105-2108. Finally, the Pfizer Court expressed concern that it would ""defeat th[e] 
purposes"" of the antitrust laws if a defendant could ""escape full liability for his illegal actions."" 434 U.S. at 314, 98 S. Ct. 
584. But this justification was merely an attempt to ""divin[e] what Congress would have wanted"" had it considered the 
question of extraterritoriality — an approach we eschewed in Morrison, 561 U.S. at 261, 130 S. Ct. 2869. Given all this, and 
in particular the fact that RICO lacks the language that Pfizer found integral to its decision, we decline to extend this aspect 
of our Clayton Act jurisprudence to RICO's cause of action. "
1196,6," The Amended Complaint also alleges that Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of intellectual property — the names of the actual end 
users of the journals. At trial, however, Plaintiffs [**40]  did not seek damages for the loss of this intellectual property. (See Tr. 
438-39, 480-81). Instead, Plaintiffs requested damages that consisted of the difference between the price that certain (identified) 
Brazilian institutions should have paid for journal subscriptions, and the price that those institutions actually paid. (See id.). 
Consequently, the Court has not considered the alleged loss of intellectual property in its analysis. The Court notes for the 
record, however, that the loss of this intellectual property apparently occurred in Brazil, where Defendants falsified the names on 
their subscription forms. "
1197,7," Thus, even if the Court had accepted Plaintiffs' proposed test for a domestic RICO injury, the Court would not have found that 
Defendants' conduct had a direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on U.S. commerce. "
1198,8," A fourteenth invoice lists ""DHL Omega"" as the shipping method for some of the journals that Defendants ordered. (Ex. 35). 
While DHL is a German shipping company, it has operations all over the world; consequently, that particular shipping 
designation does not provide much insight."
1198,9," It is true that, for at least some of the journals that Elsevier sent to Plaintiffs, ""[l]egal and beneficial title"" to the journals 
""remain[ed] with Elsevier until Elsevier ha[d] received in full (in cash or cleared funds) all sums due [for the journals]."" (Ex. 11, "
1199,13," -16,19-20, 22, 24, 27-28, 32-33, 35, 37, 39-40, 43). Because Plaintiffs sent their checks to U.S. addresses, a reasonable jury 
might be able to infer that Elsevier cashed or cleared those checks in the United States. In other words, a reasonable jury might 
be able to infer that title to the disputed journals passed from Plaintiffs to Defendants in the United States. But this does not 
change the Court's analysis. Before title passed to Defendants, Plaintiffs did not have possession of the journals, but they did 
have a right to sue Defendants to recover (i) the journals themselves or (ii) damages from Defendants' use of the journals (in 
derogation of Plaintiffs' title). After title passed to Defendants, Plaintiffs were in exactly the same [**51]  position: Plaintiffs did not 
have possession of the journals, but they did have a right to sue Defendants to recover the journals or damages from 
Defendants' use of the journals (in derogation of the contractual promise that the journals were for ""valid personal use""). As the 
change of title made no practical difference to Plaintiffs, the Court believes that Plaintiffs were injured when they lost possession 
of the journals, rather than when they lost title to the journals. "
1202,10," Because the Court has resolved the questions on the jury's verdict form, it need not consider Plaintiffs' alternative argument 
that the questions on the Court's verdict form should be characterized as general verdict questions, rather than special verdict 
questions, and that inconsistency between general verdicts does not ordinarily require retrial. (See Pl. Supp. Br. 19-20 (citing 
Cash v. County of Erie, 654 F.3d 324, 343 (2d Cir. 2011))). However, the Court believes that this argument has considerable 
force. "
1206,1," Notably, Simon argued that Gumwood needed to prove actual harm to competition, such as the exclusion of a competitor or 
charging of above-market rents, whereas it now only proposes that Gumwood must show a ""substantial potential of harm to 
competition."""
1206,2," In that respect, the question proposed by Simon is largely a straw man, and does not reflect the distinction that Simon contends 
would actually be dispositive here. The dispute is not over whether there must be a substantial potential for harm to competition, 
but over the content of that requirement-whether it is met by showing that a substantial volume of commerce is foreclosed 
because of the tie, as articulated by the Seventh Circuit in Reifert and the Supreme Court in Jefferson Parish, or whether it 
requires an additional analysis of whether foreclosing a substantial volume of commerce in the tied market is also sufficiently 
likely to harm the competitive process in that market, as apparently proposed by Simon. "
1207,3, This Court also expressly rejected this same argument in denying Simon's motion to dismiss. [DE 55 p. 22-23].
1207,4," Further, given the fact-intensive nature of this inquiry, divorcing the legal standard from the facts of the case-as would be 
required to call this a pure question of law suitable for interlocutory appeal-would hamstring the court of appeals in its ability to 
frame the contours of such a requirement, which is a further reason why this issue is not appropriate for interlocutory appeal. "

could prove liability. "
1234,1," More specifically, the order to show cause directed the parties to address three questions: ""(1) whether an antitrust plaintiff's 
proof of overcharges (which, by definition, is a proof of supracompetitive prices) necessarily proves market power, 
because [**11]  the extraction of supracompetitive prices is itself an exercise of market power; (2) whether, in this case (and in 
any case brought under FTC v. Actavis), an allegation of supracompetitive prices can be proved or disproved directly with data 
on the allegedly supracompetitively priced product and its generic(s); and, if so, (3) whether, in such a case, an explicit 
articulation of (and discovery and argument on) market definition is necessary or relevant."" (doc. # 432). The order also directed 
them to ""address the so-called Cellophane fallacy, either as either as part of their responses to the questions above or 
separately, and whether they avoid or commit that fallacy in their positions on the questions above."" Id."

antitrust enforcement agencies, and most economists have all reached the conclusion that a patent does not necessarily confer 
market power upon the patentee. Today, we reach the same conclusion . . . .""). The defendants additionally cite Walker Process 
Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 86 S. Ct. 347, 15 L. Ed. 2d 247 (1965), and its progeny to 
argue that the existence of a patent does not create a presumption of market power or necessarily imply the definition of the 
relevant market. I agree with that proposition as far as it goes, but I do not believe it goes as far the defendants urge me to take 
it. Walker Process concerns fraudulently procured patents and requires an appraisal of ""the exclusionary power of the illegal 
patent claim in terms [**17]  of the relevant market for the product involved,"" id. at 177, because otherwise ""there is no way to 
measure [the defendant's] ability to lessen or destroy competition."" Id. That is consistent with the fact that some patents confer 
little or no market power (that is: relatively worthless patents). It does not follow, however, that the defendant's ability to harm 
competition is never measurable directly or that it cannot be manifest in direct evidence of the harm itself. "

938. See also Kottle v. Nw. Kidney Ctrs., 146 F.3d 1056, 1060 (9th Cir.1998) "
1271,6," There are two flaws to TCL's attempt to controvert this point. The first is that Dr. Leonard's analysis has nothing to do with 
Ericsson's ""intent."" The second is that Exhibit 16 to the Holder Declaration submitted in this case lacks the pages cited in TCL's 
response to Ericsson's Statement of Uncontroverted Facts. (See Holder Decl. Ex. 16, Dkt. No 948-18 (lacking pages 25-27.).)"
1271,7," TCL essentially admits that it is engaging in this kind of bootstrapping when it argues ""TCL's evidence that Ericsson attempted 
to force TCL to license its [standard essential patents] at supracompetitive royalty rates is sufficient to establish 'unfair' acts 
pursuant to [the UCL]."" (TCL Opp'n p. 19 (emphasis added).) "
1274,1, Plaintiff details the history of the company and the trademark as follows: [**3] 
1275,," As duly recorded with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (""USPTO""): (a) Just Bulbs Ltd. applied for, and on 
April 12, 1983 received, registration for the service mark JUST BULBS (see Ex. A); (b) Just Bulbs Ltd. merged with 
Superiority Inc., and provided to Superiority authorization to use JUST BULBS, as of August 15, 1995; (c) pursuant to such 
authorization, by assumed name certificate dated December 27,1995, Superiority Inc. was ""doing business as"" JUST 
BULBS; and (d) by assignment dated October 13, 2008, Just Bulbs Ltd. assigned the registration for JUST BULBS to 
plaintiff, Bulbs 4 East Side Inc. True and correct copies of the recordations at the USPTO of the foregoing merger, assumed 
name certificate, and assignment documents are annexed and made Exhibit B hereto. (Document No. 1 at 3 and Exhibit B)."
1275,2," Plaintiff alleges that Ricks sometimes operates ""under the name of businesses which hide his identity."" (Document No. 26 at 7). 
For example, the Domain Name was purchased by ""motherboards.com."" Id. at 10. For the sake of clarity, the Court will refer to 
Defendant as ""Ricks"" throughout. Plaintiff also has filed its claims against defendants ""does 1 through 10,"" who ""cannot yet be known,"" [**4]  but who it alleges are 
""the agents, partners, joint-ventures, co-conspirators, owners, principals, successors, and predecessors of Ricks and are in 
some manner responsible or legally liable for the events, actions, transactions, and circumstances alleged herein."" (Document 
No. 1 at 2). However, the motions at issue only concern Defendant Ricks."
1275,3, Plaintiff's predecessor-in-interest is Superiority Inc. See fn. 1 supra. 
1277,4, Defendant does not dispute that the mark has been used continuously by Plaintiff for more than five years.
1277,5," Defendant merely lists this defense, but nowhere in its motions does it provide additional argument. For the sake of 
thoroughness, however, the Court will briefly consider this defense. "
1278,6," Defendant does not specifically dispute that Plaintiff's mark has acquired secondary meaning, nor does he dispute this 
evidence."
1278,7," This refers to the Declaration of David Brooks, Document No. 26, Exhibit A."
1278,8," Plaintiff also cites to Dallas Cowboys Football Club, Ltd. v. Am.'s Team Properties, Inc., for the proposition that the fact that its 
sales are substantially more than Defendant's weighs in favor of secondary meaning. 616 F. Supp. 2d 622, 636 (N.D. Tex. 
2009). See also Nola Spice Designs, L.L.C. v. Haydel Enterprises, Inc., 783 F.3d 527, 544 (5th Cir. 2015) (Court noted that 
sales of approximately $30,500 were ""low compared to the sales of products bearing marks that we have found to have 
secondary meaning,"" which included cases where sales consisted of ""916,385 cases [**15]  of Fish—Fri between 1964 and 
1979"" and where recent sales exceeded $93 million.) (citing Zatarains, Inc. v. Oak Grove Smokehouse, Inc., 698 F.2d 786, 795-
6 (5th Cir. 1983); Bd. of Supervisors for La. State Univ. Agric. & Mech. Coll. v. Smack Apparel Co., 550 F.3d 465, 478 (5th Cir. 
2008)). "
1279,9," Defendant unconvincingly claims that he never made this representation. (Document No. 36 at 9). Regardless, he was clearly 
aware of Plaintiff's mark and continued to infringe upon it. "
1283,10," Therefore the Court does not need to consider Plaintiff's claim that Defendant has ""unclean hands."" "
1284,11," The cases cited by Defendant are inapplicable or less relevant for a number of reasons. First, some of the cases merely limit 
the plaintiff's damages, but do not bar the entire action. Ironclad, L.P. v. Poly-Am., Inc., No. CIV.A. 3:98-CV-2600P, 1999 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 16265, 1999 WL 826946, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 14, 1999) (limiting the plaintiff's Lanham Act damages to those 
occurring within the four-year statute of [**32]  limitations); Am. Rice, Inc. v. Producers Rice Mill, Inc., 518 F.3d 321, 337 (5th Cir. 
2008) (limiting damages to defendant's profits in recent years). Plaintiff is correct that in Edmark Indus. SDN. BHD. v. S. Asia 
Int'l (H.K.) Ltd. the defendant had ceased its infringing conduct and was not liable for the more recent re-distribution of the 
packaging by third parties. 89 F. Supp. 2d 840, 846 (E.D. Tex. 2000); (Document No. 37 at 16). In addition, the Court was 
barring a common law unfair competition claim. Id. Furthermore, in Bernardo Footwear, LLC v. Ashley Nettye, Inc., the plaintiff's 
claims were closely related to time-barred breach of contract claims, and the plaintiff conceded that its Lanham Act claim arose 
eight to ten years earlier. No. CIV.A. H-11-2057, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43583, 2012 WL 1076252, at *5 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 28, 
2012); (Document No. 37 at 17). The relevant portion of the decision in Bernardo Footwear also rests upon the conclusion that 
plaintiff should have discovered defendant's actions sooner; the discussion of a continuing cause of action was limited to the 
breach of contract claim. Id. "
1285,12," The Court explained that, Haar [the alleged infringer] uses the name ""thechildrensplace.com"" as the address, or name, of its website, and has 
similarly reserved all the other names in contention. This is not simply an adjectival use, as might be the case if Haar 
named his [**36]  website otherwise, but referred to it in publicity materials as ""a children's place."" Haar's use is as a mark. 
It therefore cannot qualify for the protection of 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b)(4). TCPIP Holding Co. v. Haar Commc'ns, Inc., 244 F.3d 88, 104 (2d Cir. 2001). "
1287,13," Plaintiff asks that this claim be stricken from the record, [**42]  because such evidence violates Federal Rule of Evidence 408. 
(Document No. 37 at 2). However Defendant's claim refers to a lack of a settlement offer. Furthermore, the Court is considering 
Defendant's statement as relevant to his bad faith under the ACPA, not ""to prove or disprove the validity or amount of a disputed 
claim or to impeach by a prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction."" Fed. R. Evid. 408; Zinner v. Olenych, 108 F. Supp. 3d 
369, 391 (E.D. Va. 2015). But see Fairbanks Capital Corp. v. Kenney, 303 F. Supp. 2d 583, 594 (D. Md. 2003). "
1288,," Plaintiff also asks that other portions of Defendant's Memorandum be stricken from the record. (Document No. 37 at 2). 
However, as those sections are not relevant, the Court will not rule on those requests."
1288,14," Interestingly, Plaintiff does not bring up the fact that, at one point, there was a button on the website where one could make 
offers to purchase it, calling into question the veracity of Defendant's statement that he never attempted to sell the Domain 
Name. (Document No. 33-1 at 39:8-10; Document No. 26, Exhibit B-5, at 409)."
1288,15," Omitting the second ""p"" in shopping is known as ""typosquatting,"" where a party uses a domain name containing a typo or 
intentional misspelling of distinctive or famous names. Texas Int'l Prop. Associates v. Hoerbiger Holding AG, 624 F. Supp. 2d 
582, 587 (N.D. Tex. 2009). Any argument that Defendant was unaware of HP's trademark is particularly absurd here, as there is 
no other reason to intentionally purchase a domain name with a typo. "
1289,16," Defendant's extensive involvement in litigation regarding cybersquatting and trademarks also suggests that he did not have a 
reasonable belief that his use of the Domain Name constituted fair use. "
1292,1," This Order refers to defendants EnzymeWorks, Inc. and EnzymeWorks, Inc. (China) collectively as ""EnzymeWorks"" or the 
""EnzymeWorks entities."" "
1294,2," Even if they are not, it is reasonable to infer that such purchases would be governed by language that is substantially similar to 
the contracts that have been provided. "
1303,1, A third argument regarding DiMartino's standing for injunctive relief will be tackled separately in this section. See infra § B(iii). 
1305,2," The Supreme Court's decision in Blue Shield of Virginia v. McCready, 457 U.S. 465, 102 S. Ct. 2540, 73 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1982), 
is inapplicable to the instant action. In McCready, the plaintiff was obligated to make payments under her insurance plan to Blue 
Cross and it was these payments that she sought to recover in her suit. Accordingly, the Supreme Court distinguished Illinois 
Brick since there were no other relevant actors in the economic chain. The economic and distribution chain from BMWNA to the 
second-parties and then to the Plaintiff impinges on the very policy considerations raised in the Supreme Court's line of direct-
purchaser standing cases and DiMartino has not alleged any form of direct relationship between the customer [*16]  and 
BMWNA, as discussed above. See Hale v. Stryker Orthopaedics, No. CIV 08-3367 (WJM), 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126886, 2009 
WL 321579, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb. 9, 2009) (noting that in that action ""[b]etween Plaintiffs and Defendants in the chain of distribution 
stand several actors, including the hospitals performing the joint surgeries and Plaintiffs' insurers."") "
1307,3," While in his opposition brief Plaintiff attempts to pivot his FDUTPA claim away from fraud by relying on his antitrust allegations, 
this post hoc rationalization cannot avoid the fact that the FDUTPA claim—at its core—sounds in fraud and therefore must meet 
Rule 9(b)'s requirements. "
1319,*," Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation "
1325,1," In their submissions, the parties utilize a variety of methods to pincite specific portions of the record. For ease of reference, the 
Court has consistently cited to the assigned page numbers in the header of the documents, with the exception of documents 
consistently organized by paragraph number or mini-deposition page numbers throughout, which the Court cited according to 
such designations. "
1326,2," Dr. Deligdish is the president of Omni. (Doc. 57, ¶ 22.) Dr. Grenevicki founded IFS. (Id. ¶ 22.)"
1326,3," Lead Plaintiff Omni is also a multi-specialty physicians practice with various ancillary service facilities. (Doc. 57, ¶ 20.) "
1329,4," In its entirety, the disclaimer reads as follows: ""The objective of this REPORT is to provide an estimate of the Fair Market Value . . . as of the VALUATION DATE, of the 
SUBJECT INTEREST. The purpose and specific use of this REPORT is to assist [Omni] in its advertisement to the management 
of the SUBJECT ENTITY regarding the consideration of a prospective transaction of the SUBJECT INTEREST. The opinions expressed in this REPORT are restricted to that use and not valid if used for [*17]  any other purpose. Any other 
use of this REPORT may lead the user to an incorrect conclusion for which the VALUATOR assumes no responsibility. No other 
use of this REPORT is permitted without the express written authorization of the VALUATOR. Possession of this REPORT or a 
copy thereof does not carry with it the right of publication. It may not be used for any other purpose, in whole or in part, by 
anyone except [Omni], for whom this REPORT was prepared, or conveyed to any other third party without the previous express 
written consent of the VALUATOR."" (Doc. 197-2, pp. 9) "
1330,5," According to Plaintiffs, SEF is a measure of the degree of accuracy of a forecast. (Doc. 197, p. 24.) "
1336,6," The Court also rejects the Corporate Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs lack standing to sue because they have not been 
totally excluded from the market. (See Doc. 201, p. 3 n.2.) As previously stated, ""[t]he primary vice of vertical merger or other 
arrangement tying a customer to a supplier is that, by foreclosing the competitors of either party from a segment of the market 
otherwise open to them, the arrangement may act as a clog on competition, which deprives rivals of a fair opportunity to 
compete."" Brown Shoe Co., 370 U.S. at 323-24 (emphasis added). Moreover, nowhere in the Corporate Defendants' cited 
authority does the Eleventh Circuit pronounce that antitrust injury requires complete exclusion from the [*42]  relevant market. 
See Gulf States, 466 F.3d 961."
1336,7," For purposes of addressing the Corporate Defendants' MSJ as to Count II only, the Court will refer to Health First and HRMC 
collectively as ""Defendants."" "
1340,8," In his declaration, Dr. Dowdell avers that his office operating suite was certified by the Department of Health. [*59]  (Doc. 235-
58, ¶ 7.) "
1343,9," According to Plaintiffs, all physicians and medical practices that agreed to Health First's exclusive dealing arrangements are 
Defendants' co-conspirators—including MIMA and its physicians prior to the [*70]  MIMA Acquisition. "
1344,10," Contrary to Defendants' arguments, none of Plaintiffs' proffered testimony constitutes hearsay."
1344,11," The Court also rejects the Corporate Defendants' contention that portions of Plaintiffs' evidence falls outside the scope of the 
Complaint. (See Doc. 249, p. 9.) To the contrary, Plaintiffs alleged a conspiracy based on exclusive dealing arrangements 
between MIMA and Health First. (E.g., Doc. 57, ¶¶ 146-152, 368.) The evidence produced by Plaintiffs supports exactly that. "
1346,12," The Corporate Defendants also appear to dispute whether Plaintiffs are consumers of services within the purview of FDUTPA. 
(See Doc. 201, pp. 200, 201.) Though immaterial, the Court rejects this argument. Florida law has clearly established that the 
2001 amendment to FDUTPA eradicated the prior requirement that a plaintiff be a consumer to seek relief under the statute. N. 
Am. Clearing, Inc. v. Brokerage Comput. Sys., Inc., 666 F. Supp. 2d 1299, 1310 n.9 (M.D. Fla. 2009) (stating that ""the 2001 
Amendments to FDUTPA broadened its scope to allow any person or entity who has suffered a loss as a result of unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices to commence a private action for actual damages""); see also Caribbean Cruise Line, Inc. v. Better 
Bus. Bureau of Palm Beach Cty., 169 So. 3d 164 (Fla. 4th DCA 2015) (same). Moreover, a claim under FDUTPA need not even 
arise out of a consumer transaction. Furmanite America, Inc. v. T.D. Williamson, Inc., 506 F.Supp.2d 1134, 1145-46 (M.D. Fla. 
2007)."
1346,13," The only notable exception to this rule is ""when the product is rendered valueless as a result of the defect."" Rollins, Inc., 454 
So. 2d at 585. In that circumstance, ""the purchase price is the appropriate measure of actual damages."" Id. "
1351,14, Any remaining arguments raised in the parties' motions but not expressly addressed in this Order are rejected. 
1354,1," Plaintiff alleges that all of the defendants [*3]  are wholly-owned subsidiaries of WSI, but that WSI is the ""manufacturer, 
merchant, and marketer"" of the products at issue. TAC ¶¶ 1, 27-36. "
1356,2," While the TAC does not allege what ply the unpurchased products are, in his First Amended Complaint Rushing admitted that a 
number of the unpurchased products were single-ply. See Dkt. No. 1-10 (FAC) ¶¶ [*10]  60, 63, 66. While the contents of the 
prior complaints are not admissions or ""legally binding"" on him, they are relevant to what he may be able to plausibly allege if 
given leave to amend. They indicate that he may not be able to allege that any of the unpurchased products are two-ply. "
1357,3," Rushing cannot claim that the two-ply issue does not matter, because if defendants were allowed to count the two-ply yarn as 
two threads for thread-count purposes, the bedding he purchased would have a 582 thread count, which is within the + or — 5% 
deviation he alleges is the industry standard."
1357,4," Plaintiff alleges that WSI does business as Williams-Sonoma Home (WSH). TAC ¶ 29. Defendants refer to the bedding that 
Rushing purchased as ""WSH bedding."" I will likewise refer to the bedding plaintiff purchased as WSH bedding. "
1358,5," For this reason, defendants' reliance on Davis v. HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A., 691 F.3d 1152, 1165 (9th Cir. 2012) does not 
support them. In Davis, part of the conduct challenged was expressly permitted, indeed required in consumer transactions, by 
the federal regulation at issue and therefore, fell within the safe harbor."
1358,6," Plaintiff alleges that the federal agency charged with regulating consumer transactions, the FTC, has opined that companies 
manufacturing or selling bedding should not count each thread in a two-ply yarn in the thread-count number advertised. TAC ¶ 
58. Defendants dispute the characterization of the impact of the FTC's opinion letter and argue their conduct [*17]  nonetheless 
is complies with the FTC guidance because they disclose the fact the yarns in the product at issue were two-ply. Reply at 9 n.12. 
I need not resolve these dueling contentions as to the impact of the FTC letter in order to resolve this motion to dismiss. "
1359,7," See also Falk v. GMC, 496 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1094-95 (N.D. Cal. 2007) (""Plaintiffs can therefore successfully pursue a CLRA 
claim, . . . if GM was 'obliged to disclose' the potential for problems with the speedometers in certain vehicles. A failure to 
disclose or concealment can constitute actionable fraud in four circumstances: [*20]  (1) when the defendant is in a fiduciary 
relationship with the plaintiff; (2) when the defendant had exclusive knowledge of material facts not known to the plaintiff; (3) 
when the defendant actively conceals a material fact from the plaintiff; and (4) when the defendant makes partial representations 
but also suppresses some material fact. LiMandri v. Judkins, 52 Cal. App. 4th 326, 337, 60 Cal. Rptr. 2d 539 (1997)."")."
1359,8," Plaintiff's CLRA violation is based in part on express allegations that ""defendants' active concealment of material facts violated 
§ 1770(a)(5)'s proscription against representing that goods have characteristics and quantities that do not actually have. . . . 
Defendants' active concealment of material facts violated or § 1770(a)(7)'s proscription against representing that goods are of a 
particular standard, quality or grade when they are of another. . . . Defendants' active concealment of material facts violated § 
1770(a)(9)'s proscription against advertising good with the intent not to sell them as advertised."" TAC ¶¶ 154-156. "
1360,9," Defendants challenge Rushing's apparent reliance on puffery as a source of his illegality claim. Mot. 18. In Opposition, he 
clarifies that he does not rely on defendants' ""puffery-type"" statements that its bedding is ""luxurious"" or ""soft"" for an 
actionable [*23]  claim. Oppo. 12."
1360,10," California courts are split on how to define ""unfair"" in the consumer context, with some applying the modified Cel-Tech 
standard and others applying the balancing test. See, e.g., Lozano v. AT & T Wireless Servs., Inc., 504 F.3d 718, 736 (9th Cir. 
2007); see also Rubio v. Capital One Bank, 613 F.3d 1195, 1204 (9th Cir. 2010). "
1361,11," The cases plaintiff relies on for the proposition that notice can be provided post-suit predate Alvarez. See Yamada v. Nobel 
Biocare Holding AG, 275 F.R.D. 573, 581 (C.D. Cal. 2011); In re HP Inkjet Printer Litig., No. C 05-3580 JF, 2006 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 12848, 2006 WL 563048 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 7, 2006))."
1361,12," That stipulation mentioned the CLRA notice and explained that 30 days after the SAC was filed, plaintiff would file his TAC to 
seek damages under the CLRA, consistent with the CLRA's notice requirement. Dkt. No. 19. "
1362,13," Plaintiff also relies on Haddix v. Gen. Mills, Inc., No. 2:15-CV-02625-MCE-AC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65108, 2016 WL 
2901589, at *9 (E.D. Cal. May 17, 2016), which discussed the exception to notice under California law when a breach of express 
warranty claim is brought by injured consumers against manufacturers with whom they have not dealt. Here, however, plaintiff 
expressly pleads that he purchased the bedding directly from defendants. The exception does not apply here. See Davis v. 
Apperience Corp., No. C 14-00766 WHA, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 154758, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 31, 2014) (rejecting application 
of exception where plaintiff dealt directly with defendant). "
1369,1," The products that are the center of this dispute are New Orleans-style sno-balls, not snow cones. As all true confectionary 
connoisseurs know, a [**3]  sno-ball is a dessert treat made from finely shaved ice that can be consumed with a straw or spoon 
while a snow cone is made using coarser crushed ice and is generally eaten directly cone to mouth. Snow cones originated in 
Texas and are the invention of Samuel ""King Sammie"" Bert who first sold the treats at the 1919 Texas State Fair. Sno-balls, 
although often associated with New Orleans, were first made in Baltimore from the shavings left over on ice shipments moving 
from New England to the American South. See Mariel Synan, The Colorful History of Shaved Ice, HUNGRY HISTORY, 
http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/the-colorful-history-of-shaved-ice ."
1369,2," The 10-4275 action was dismissed without prejudice and the claims made in it were re-asserted in 11-1499, which was 
consolidated with 06-9170. In the 11-1499 suit, several other similarly situated companies joined with Southern Snow as 
plaintiffs."
1369,3," S. Snow Mfg. Co. v. SnoWizard Holdings Inc., No. 06-9170 (E.D. La. Feb. 27, 2013), ECF No. 652. "
1370,4," The court entered judgment for Plum Street Snoballs (a Southern Snow co-plaintiff) establishing that Plum Street owned a valid 
and enforceable trademark for the unregistered term ORCHID CREAM VANILLA and that SnoWizard used a reproduction of 
that trademark in a manner likely to cause confusion in violation of Lanham Act §§ 43(a), 35; 15 U.S.C. §§ 1125(a), 1117. The 
jury also found that SnoWizard's conduct was ""unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or deceptive"" and that Plum Street Snoballs 
was entitled to the costs of the action. The jury rendered judgment against Southern Snow (in favor of defendant SnoWizard) on all the plaintiffs' other causes of action 
including additional trademark infringement claims tied to ORCHID CREAM VANILLA and claims involving the plaintiffs' 
asserted [**6]  trademarks in SNOW SWEET. The jury similarly found against Southern Snow on its assertions that SnoWizard 
had fraudulently asserted trademark rights in ORCHID CREAM VANILLA, SNOBALL, SNOSWEET, SNOBALL MACHINE, 
HURRICANE, MOUNTAIN MAPLE, BUTTER-CREAM, BUTTERED POPCORN, CAKE BATTER, CAJUN RED HOT, COOKIE 
DOUGH, DILL PICKLE, GEORGIA PEACH, KING CAKE, MUDSLIDE, PRALINE, and WHITE CHOCOLATE & CHIPS. The jury found for SnoWizard on six of SnoWizard's eight counter-claims, concluding Southern Snow's trademark infringement 
claims for SNOBALL ""were groundless, brought in bad faith, or were brought for purposes of harassment""; that SnoWizard 
owned valid trademarks in CAJUN RED HOT, WHITE CHOCOLATE & CHIPS, MOUNTAIN MAPLE, and SNOSWEET, which 
Southern Snow or co-plaintiff Parasol Flavors infringed; and that SnoWizard and Sciortino owned a valid patent for an icemaker 
that Southern Snow infringed. S. Snow Mfg. Co., Inc. v. SnoWizard Holdings, Inc., No. 06-9170 (E.D. La. Mar. 5, 2013) 
(judgment on jury verdict)."
1370,5," The First Amended complaint included Theodore Eisenmann, Van's Snowballs, and Plum Street Snoballs as plaintiffs. Those 
parties were not listed on the Second Amended Complaint. Southern Snow urges that they are erroneously listed as appellants 
here because they did not join the Second Amended Complaint, while SnoWizard insists they are valid cross-appellees because 
the second Rule 11 sanctions motion in SnoWizard's cross appeal is tied to the filing of the First Amended complaint. "
1371,6," The malicious prosecution claims relate to only two of the prior cases, No. 10-4275, and No. 11-0515. No. 10-4275 was 
dismissed without prejudice and the claims were refiled in the Consolidated Cases. No 11-0515 settled."
1371,7," Because SnoWizard had already sought sanctions against Southern Snow in a related proceeding, the two Rule 11 motions 
brought in the present case are the Second and Third Sanctions Motions."
1371,8," Generally, a true res judicata argument (claim preclusion) is an affirmative defense that should not be the basis for a 12(b)(6) 
dismissal, but this bar is waived by the appellants' failure to assert it on appeal. Norris v. Hearst Trust, 500 F.3d 454, 461 n.9 
(5th Cir. 2007)."
1371,9," The plaintiffs argue that Louisiana's claim preclusion standard governs, while the defendants assert the federal test [**12]  
applies. HN4[
] Federal common law on choice of law dictates that the standard for the claim preclusive effect of a federal 
court judgment depends on the grounds for federal jurisdiction in the original suit. When the original suit is based on the federal 
court's diversity jurisdiction, ""the law that would be applied by state courts in the State in which the federal diversity court sits"" 
governs the judgment's preclusive effect. Semtek Int'l Inc. v. Lockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 508, 121 S. Ct. 1021, 149 L. 
Ed. 2d 32 (2001). But when the prior judgment was based on the court's federal question jurisdiction, a single federal standard 
applies. Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 891, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2008). Because the Consolidated Cases were "
1372,," heard in federal court based on federal question jurisdiction, the federal rule governs here. Wright, Miller, & Cooper, Federal 
Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d. § 4466."
1372,10, We discuss in Part II.C Southern Snow's claims for conspiracy against Morris and Tolar.
1372,11," Southern Snow argues that because the district court dismissed some of its claims in the Consolidated Cases as barred by the 
Noerr—Pennington doctrine, those claims did not receive a final judgment on the merits. HN6[
] A precluded claim, however, "
1373,," need not have been decided by a jury; a prior court must merely have brought the claim to a final judgment. See, e.g., Brooks v. 
Raymond Dugat Co., 336 F.3d 360, 362 (5th Cir. 2003) (""A dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment on the merits.""); In re

1373,12," Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014), does not help the plaintiffs, despite 
their assertions to the contrary. Lexmark narrowed the class of plaintiffs able to establish standing under the Lanham Act to 
those within the ""zone of interests protected by the law."" Id. at 1388. It gave no indication that a single pattern of facts could bear 
consecutive suits. "

1374,15," Although this circuit has never specifically addressed the point, SnoWizard argues that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine bars 
civil-RICO liability based purely on statements made to federal courts. See Bayou Fleet, Inc. v. Alexander, 234 F.3d 852, 859-60 
(5th Cir. 2000) (applying Noerr—Pennington to § 1983 claim after noting that the Supreme Court has only used it to bar antitrust 
claims); ABA Section of Antitrust Law, 2 Antitrust Law Developments 1284-1302 (7th ed. 2012). Southern Snow argues that 
the defendants' actions in the prior proceeding would qualify for the sham litigation exception to Noerr-Pennington, see 
Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., 508 U.S. 49, 56, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993), 
but SnoWizard's [**21]  actions hardly qualify as sham litigation considering that the jury found in their favor on several of their 
counterclaims and they were successful at summary judgment on several others. Because Southern Snow does not plead the 
requisite criminal activity to support a civil-RICO claim, we need not address whether criminal activity based solely on litigation 
activity should be barred from civil-RICO liability as an extension of the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. "
1375,16," HN9[
] In Taylor v. Sturgell [**24] , the Supreme Court announced a small group of exceptions to the general rule that non- parties cannot be bound to the outcome of a prior lawsuit by claim preclusion. The exceptions are: First, a person who agrees to be bound . . . . Second . . . a variety of pre-existing substantive legal relationships between 
the person to be bound and a party to the judgment. Qualifying relationships include, but are not limited to, preceding and 
succeeding owners of property, bailee and bailor, and assignee and assignor . . . . Third . . . in certain limited circumstances 
a nonparty may be bound by a judgment because she was adequately represented by someone with the same interest who 
was a party to the suit . . . . Fourth, a nonparty may be bound by a judgment if she assumed control over the litigation in 
which that judgment was rendered . . . . Fifth, a party bound by a judgment may not avoid its preclusive force by relitigating 
through a proxy . . . . Sixth, in certain circumstances a special statutory scheme may expressly foreclose successive 
litigation by nonlitigants. Taylor, 553 U.S. 880, 893-95, 128 S. Ct. 2161, 171 L. Ed. 2d 155 (2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Only the third 
exception plausibly applies but, as the district court observed, Morris [**25]  and Tolar may have asserted different arguments 
and defenses in the first litigation had they been included as defendants, and they have separate ethical obligations to the Court 
that do not exist for SnoWizard. As a result, non-party claim preclusion does not bar Southern Snow's claims against them. "
1376,17," Counts 10 and 13 bring claims of malicious prosecution based on docket No. 11-0515, which ended in a settlement. The 
district court dismissed these claims because settled cases ""cannot serve as the basis for a malicious prosecution"" claim. Ulmer 
v. Frisard, 945 So.2d 85, 88 (La. Ct. App. 2006). Southern Snow makes no argument on appeal in defense of counts 10 or 13. 
As a result, it has abandoned those claims. McKay v. Novartis Pharm. Corp., 751 F.3d 694, 702 n.6 (5th Cir. 2014). "
1378,18," SnoWizard urges that counsel should be treated as a repeat offender because counsel for Southern Snow was plaintiffs' 
counsel in St. Germain and therefore should know that where the plaintiffs ""have not alleged the requisite predicate criminal acts 
under RICO, they have not met the pleading standard of Rule 12(b)(6)."" St. Germain, 556 F.3d at 263 (emphasis added). 
SnoWizard further observes that, in addition to losing his appeal in St. Germain, counsel narrowly avoided Rule 11 sanctions. 
We observed that St. Germain was ""a close case [arguing for sanctions] given that [counsel and his client] clearly have not 
presented [**34]  a cognizable civil RICO claim."" Id. at 264. In his next suit against the same defendants, counsel was not able 
to escape sanctions. Howard v. St. Germain, 599 F.3d 455, 458 (5th Cir. 2010) (sanctioning counsel for filing a frivolous appeal 
advancing ""a ridiculous, farfetched notion""). Although we find counsel's pattern of behavior troubling, we are not convinced that 
the district court abused its discretion by denying sanctions. SnoWizard also notes that counsel filed another suit against SnoWizard in the PTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in 
February 2015 once again challenging the WHITE CHOCOLATE & CHIPS and CAJUN RED HOT trademarks on behalf of Snow 
Ball's Chance, Ltd., a New Orleans company that SnoWizard asserts is merely a front for Southern Snow. Whatever offenses 
counsel and Southern Snow may have committed before the PTO, however, are the proper subject of that agency's sanctions 
process, not the present suit. "

1387,3," After the hearing, the Court ordered supplemental briefing to determine whether the jury's finding of specific intent on 
Trendsettah's attempted monopolization claim rendered harmless the Court's failure to give the refusal-to-deal instruction on the 
attempted monopolization claim. Docket No. 253. As Swisher correctly noted in supplemental briefing, anticompetitive conduct 
cannot be inferred from evidence of anticompetitive intent alone. See William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Cont'l Baking 
Co., 668 F.2d 1014, 1028 (9th Cir. 1981) (""[D]irect evidence of intent alone, without corroborating evidence of conduct, cannot 
sustain a claim of attempted monopolization."") (collecting cases)."
1387,4," Ostensibly, the jury's findings were based on evidence presented at trial that (1) Swisher's anticompetitive conduct began in the 
fourth quarter of 2012, twenty months into the parties' course of dealing; (2) Swisher entered into the private label agreements 
only after senior management learned that Trendsettah had approached its competitors with the same manufacturing proposal; 
and (3) Swisher sacrificed short-term profits by refusing to both fill more profitable orders for unflavored cigarillos and transfer 
production of cigarillos to their Dominican Republic facilities. Docket No. 242 at 14-16, 28. "
1389,5," In Swisher's view, the Good Times model must exclude unfilled orders that exceeded the monthly caps. After an independent 
review of Trendsettah's monthly deficit figures for the second private label agreement, see Pls.' Trial Ex. 137 at 1 (""Revised Ex. 
10.a to Cox Report""), the Court determines that excluding excess orders would reduce the total deficit figure from 202,309,970 
unfilled orders to 182,603,170 unfilled orders. This is a difference of 19,706,800 unfilled orders, or 9.74% of the total deficit 
figure. All such unfilled orders occurred in February 2013, the first month of the second private label agreement. Id. After 
February 2013, there were no unfilled orders that exceeded the monthly caps. Id. "
1391,1," At the request of Brewer, defendants Hashim and LaBombard have not been served by the United States Marshals Service.

since the initial filing against them. See N.D.N.Y. L.R. 4.1(b) (requiring service within sixty days of the filing of the complaint).

Cacamis because of his gender, (id.) — the claim still fails to allege sufficient facts to support an equal protection claim."
1394,6," In one of his responsive memoranda, Brewer asserts that ""[e]rroneous [d]eprivation is folded into infringement of the right to 
bear arms. Unclean Hands replaces it as Fifth Cause of Action. Plaintiff also amends the 4th Cause of Action."" (Dkt. No. 30 at 
19.) While it is not altogether clear what legal effect Brewer thinks his assertion has, the court would deny any request for leave 
to amend as futile. "

employees oppose the filing, claiming it is an attempt to circumvent the denial of Brewer's request to file a sur-reply, contains 
irrelevant material, and that the documents are not presented in admissible form. (Dkt. No. 84.) The court concurs and 
accordingly excludes from its consideration any of the content from Brewer's request for judicial notice."

1438,5," That HDP never manufactured CRTs is not relevant to whether HDP withdrew, assuming it joined the conspiracy in the first 
place. In any event, a defendant does not need to produce the price-fixed good in order to be liable for a conspiracy. See, e.g., 
United States v. Apple, Inc., 791 F.3d 290 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding Apple liable for facilitating a conspiracy among book 
publishers). Defendants also try to distinguish Reisman and Antar. They argue the defendants in those cases did not qualify for 
withdrawal because they did not take affirmative acts. Instead of selling the business, as here, the Reisman and Antar 
defendants merely retired. That is a distinction without a difference. The defendants in Reisman and Antar did not effectuate 
their withdrawal because they retained an ownership interest and therefore failed to sever all ties. Antar, 53 F.3d at 583; 
Reisman, 409 F.2d at 793; cf. Morton's Mkt, 198 F.3d at 839. Regardless, other Hitachi Defendants sold the CRT business, not 
HDP. As Defendants point out, HDP never manufactured or sold CRTs in the first place. Defendants cannot lament that 
traditional lines of corporate separateness have been crossed by the DAPs, see infra note 6, only to blur those same lines when 
it is convenient. "
1439,6," The Hitachi Defendants argue that HDP's 25 percent ownership interest in Hitachi Shenzhen is irrelevant given principles of 
corporate separateness. Indeed, the Hitachi Defendants cannot be held liable for the acts of Hitachi Shenzhen, a separate 
corporate entity, absent alter ego liability or some other legal theory that would allow the DAPs to impute the acts of Hitachi 
Shenzhen onto the Hitachi Defendants. See U.S. v. Bestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 68 (1998) (""It is a general principle of corporate law 
deeply ingrained in our legal system that a corporation is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.""). The question before the 
Court, however, is whether the Hitachi Defendants have met the elements of withdrawal as a matter of law, not whether the 
DAPs can hold the Hitachi Defendants liable for the acts of Hitachi Shenzhen. HDP fails to meet the elements of withdrawal as a 
matter of law, in part, because it continued to own a 25 percent stake in a coconspirator. Cf. Morton's Market, 198 F.3d at 830 
(""With the sale of its dairy, [the defendant] certainly 'retired' and totally severed its ties to the milk price-fixing conspiracy."") 
(emphasis added). "
1440,7," After filing their Reply, Defendants filed objections to evidence submitted in support of the DAPs' Opposition. ECF Nos. 3449, 
4359. Local Rule 7-3(c) states that ""[a]ny evidentiary and procedural objections to the opposition must be contained within the 
reply brief or memorandum."" The Court strikes Defendants' objections for failure to comply with the Local Rules."

1458,1," The previous opinion concluded that the timing and nature of the threats was not suggestive of a preceding agreement. I think 
that ICP's clarifying allegations warrant a different conclusion. "
1459,2," Defendants argue that the ""poses [*16]  a real threat"" standard articulated in Dentsply is inapplicable to the § 1 and § 3 claims 
at issue here. (D.I. 59 at 13). I disagree. While Dentsply's, language is colored by the monopoly claim that was at issue, it is 
applicable to other exclusive dealing cases. I understand Dentsply to simply emphasize that, under the rule of reason, ""[t]he test 
is not total foreclosure, but whether the challenged practices bar a substantial number of rivals or severely restrict the market's 
ambit."" Dentsply, 399 F.3d at 191. "
1460,3," This underscores another problem with ICP's claim. ICP argues that [*22]  IronPlanet is the sole means of distributing new 
heavy construction equipment over the Internet, when IronPlanet currently offers no sales of new heavy construction equipment 
over the Internet."
1460,4," PNY Technologies discusses the more common situation, whether direct internet sales is an alternative channel of distribution

1461,5," Although Tampa Electric is a Clayton Act § 3 case, its ""relevant geographic market framework is applied routinely in Sherman

v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 726 (3d Cir. 1991). "
1462,6," Apani is a § 3 case. Apani principally relies on the Tampa Electric framework, as well as Professor Kintner's Federal Antitrust 
Law treatise. In discussing the definition of a geographic market, the treatise authors do not draw a distinction between Sherman 
Act cases and Clayton Act cases. See Joseph P. Bauer et al., Federal Antitrust Law § 10.15 (3d ed. 2013). Therefore, in 
assessing whether a § 2 plaintiff has adequately defined a relevant geographic market, Apani is instructive."
1462,7," ICP alleges that each of the twelve types of new heavy construction equipment has its own individual product market. (D.I. 48 
¶¶ 34-39)."
1462,8," Further, ICP alleges that it, through sales over the Internet, would have become ""a direct and immediate competitive threat to 
the Manufacturer Defendants"" in at least twenty-five states. (D.I. 48 ¶¶ 79-80). This suggests that ""the area of effective 
competition"" for the alleged product markets extends beyond individual states. Tampa Elec, 365 U.S. at 327. "
1463,9," Since ICP's exclusive dealing claims also require ICP to define a relevant geographic market, those claims—to the extent they 
rely on the smaller geographic markets—could also be dismissed on this basis. "
1471,1," See Flow Chart, attached to this opinion as Exhibit A. The information in the Flow Chart is collected from the undisputed facts

1474,2," Acuity argues that the evidence supports these contentions; however, Acuity's evidence regarding the actions and opinions of 
the providers is actually inadmissible second-hand testimony given by Acuity's executives. See Gunville v. Walker, 583 F.3d 
979, 985 (7th Cir. 2009) (a party cannot rely on inadmissible hearsay to oppose summary judgment). However, Acuity claims 
that, if given more discovery, it will produce affidavits from providers to support the testimony of Acuity's executives. "
1479,3," Even if Acuity did identify a proper derivative market, the finding of a derivative submarket is still subject to the practical indicia, 
discussed in the previous section. See Newcal, 513 F.3d at 1051 (""in considering the legal validity"" of a contractually-created, 
single-brand, derivative submarket, the court [*52]  must also determine whether the submarket qualifies as a submarket ""under 
the Brown Shoe standard""). "
1488,1," The language of the Alamo-brand rental agreement is slightly, immaterially different: ""The optional Tollpass service accepted 
by Renter provides for the daily rental of a toll collection transponder . . . or, in some states, the use of video-monitored toll

1488,3," While not entirely clear from the pleadings, it appears the proper functioning of PToll depended upon TxDOT's willingness, at 
least at that time, to prioritize BancPass's fleet account differently, such that tolls incurred by vehicles with license plates 
registered both to BancPass and another entity would be charged to BancPass. See Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. [#86-10] Ex. H (Deitiker 
Rep.) at 5. It is not clear if a change in the prioritization order has since occurred or remains necessary for PToll to properly 
function. "
1491,4," See section II.D, infra. "
1492,5," During hearing on the parties' motions, the Court orally ruled from the bench that PToll does not constitute tortious interference 
with any of the relevant contracts as a matter of law, and thus explains those oral rulings fully [*19]  in this opinion."
1492,6," HTA further argues BancPass cannot recover mental anguish damages because it is an entity, not an individual. See Def.'s 
Mot. Summ. J. [#84] at 14-15. In its response, BancPass clarifies that it is not seeking mental anguish damages in this litigation. 
See Pl.'s Resp. [#92] at 13. Additionally, BancPass moves for summary judgment on HTA's affirmative defense of truth to the defamation claims. See Pl.'s 
Mot. Summ. J. [#86] at 19-20. The Court declines to consider this argument on summary judgment, as it is more appropriately 
resolved on a full factual record to be developed at trial. "
1495,7," HTA makes the preliminary argument that BancPass lacks standing to assert its claim for declaratory relief on this issue 
because BancPass is neither a party to nor an intended beneficiary of the rental agreements. See Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. [#84] at 
8-9. The Court rejects this argument. Here, BancPass ""has sufficient injury-in-fact to satisfy the Art. [*30]  III case-or-controversy 
requirement,"" and as a prudential matter, ""can reasonably be expected properly to frame the issues and present them with the 
necessary adversarial zeal."" See Sec. of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., Inc., 467 U.S. 947, 956, 104 S. Ct. 2839, 81 L. 
Ed. 2d 786 (1984) (discussing third-party standing). Additionally, restricting BancPass's ability to market PToll to rental car 
customers prevents those customers from exercising their right to freedom of contract. See U.S. Dep't of Labor v. Triplett, 494 
U.S. 715, 721, 110 S. Ct. 1428, 108 L. Ed. 2d 701 (1990). Finally, HTA has itself brought a claim for reciprocal declaratory relief, 
so the practical consequences of this question are minimal. Accordingly, the Court finds BancPass may assert its claim for 
declaratory relief concerning the rental contracts. "
1496,8, See supra n. 1. 
1497,9," Confusingly, in HTA's response to BancPass on this issue, HTA states that ""HTA has not moved for summary judgment on its 
claim that PToll tortuously [sic] interferes with HTA's TxDOT Rental Fleet Agreement."" Def.'s Resp. [#91] at 17. HTA, however,

1530,2," The Complaint indicates that the relevant geographic market is the United States. (D.I. 4 ¶ 83) Defendants do not appear to 
dispute this. "
1531,3," A customer would elect to switch flight simulator models if the customer elected to switch [**12]  airplane models. However, 
given that training services account for ""less than one percent"" of the cost of an aircraft (see D.I. 4 ¶ 92). it is unlikely that a 
customer's dissatisfaction with training services would cause the customer to switch to a different airplane model. Indeed, the 
Complaint indicates that, when deciding which airplane model to purchase, business aircraft buyers primarily consider ""capital 
costs (price of airframe), as well as the size and range of aircraft its compliance with regulatory standards and the availability of 
financing."" (Id.) This means that unfair pricing and other anticompetitive behavior with respect to flight simulators and training 
services would likely not impact one's decision to purchase a particular airplane model. Put differently, this means that prices for 
different types of training services are independent and that demand for any particular kind of training service is generally not 
sensitive to price changes. These factors support the Court's conclusion that Plaintiff has adequately alleged that there is a 
separate market for different types of flight training services. See Brown Shoe, 370 U.S. at 325."
1531,4," At later stages, Plaintiff would have to satisfy the ""rule of reason test,"" which would include a requirement [**14]  to prove that 
the adverse, anticompetitive effects of Defendants' conduct is not reasonably necessary to achieve whatever purportedly pro-
competitive objective Defendants would articulate for it in their defense. Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 1367

the present dispute. "
1532,6," While the Complaint indicates that Gulfstream entered into a ""no-bid, exclusive dealing agreement,"" it does not allege that FSI 
was chosen unfairly or through an uncompetitive or corrupt process. Instead, the alleged facts suggest that FSI actively sought 
the G650 contract early in the process, while Plaintiff did not begin its exploration until after Defendants' exclusivity agreement 
was in place."
1532,7," While the Second Circuit generally recognizes the validity of exclusive agreements, it reached a different outcome in Geneva 
based in large part on the presence of fraud and ""predatory practices."" See E&L Consulting, 472 F.3d at 30. "
1533,8," Plaintiff's allegations of anticompetitive conduct are limited to the market for G650 training services. There is no allegation that 
Plaintiff was unable to compete to provide flight simulators and training services for other aircraft."
1533,9," In the briefing, Plaintiff argued that Honeywell's avionics system was ""off-the-shelf."" (D.I. 21 at 10) This assertion is directly at 
odds with the allegation in the Complaint that avionics systems are unique to each aircraft. (See D.I. 4 ¶¶ 32-33, 60) "
1534,10," If there were a conflict between Georgia law and Delaware law, the Court would still apply Georgia law. Where, as here the

location of Gulfstream's headquarters. "

state law antitrust and consumer protection claims are not preempted by federal patent law. In Oneok, the Supreme Court held 
that the plaintiffs state law antitrust claims were not preempted by the Federal Natural Gas Act. Oneok, 135 S. Ct. at 1591. This 
case is inapposite because it does not address the issue of preemption in the context of federal patent law. In Cipro I and II, the plaintiff challenged the terms of their patent settlement with the defendant, claiming that the settlement 
terms restrained competition in violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The court held that state antitrust law was not 
preempted by federal antitrust law where the underlying controversy involves a question of infringement. In re Cipro Cases I & 
II, 61 Cal. 4th 116, 187 Cal. Rptr. 3d 632, 348 P.3d 845 (Cal. May 7, 2015). This case is also inapposite because it does not

1565,1," A package with both a lock and keys is preferred by consumers over a lock and keys as separate products. Consumers would 
incur transaction costs from having to search for keys compatible with a specific lock -- packaging the products together avoids 
these costs. The lock and keys tie-in creates even more value to the consumer if a problem with the product arises. What if the 
lock will not turn? Without the tie-in, the consumer may be faced with the lock manufacturer saying the problem lies with the keys 
and the key manufacturer saying the problem lies with the lock. "
1567,2," For example, relevant characteristics of the market include, among other things, the regulatory environment, norms for the 
protection of intellectual property rights, security, theft propensity, and consumer preferences. "
1569,3," The plaintiffs emphasize that the packages sold by cable providers are ""tiered"" so that every subscriber of premium services 
obtains basic services from the same provider. However, it would make little commercial sense to sell basic cable services 
separately. In any event, an allegation of a large market share in basic services means nothing in this context because such a 
share tells us nothing about the market share in premium services. "
1571,1," Notably, the district court reached the same conclusion below, holding that Plaintiffs ""plausibly allege[] that cable boxes are 
separate and distinct from Premium Cable Services. At the pleading stage, the cable box appears to be a product that could be 
sold separately and profitably because every user of Time Warner's Premium Cable Service is a potential purchaser of a cable

by the following defendants: United Egg Producers, Inc., United States Egg Marketers, Inc., Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., and Ohio 
Fresh Eggs. Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., also expressly states that it does not join in the summary judgment motion as to Winn-Dixie 
Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc., C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company, L.P,, v. Michael Foods, Inc., 
et al., Case No. 11-0510. As noted during the hearing on the motions, the defendants have not filed a motion for summary judgment against the Direct 
Purchaser Plaintiffs on the issue of liability. Nevertheless, the Court allowed the DPPs to file post hearing briefing, addressing 
the defendants' arguments on liability. "
1633,2," The Court notes that both the IPPs and the DAPs assert in their responsive briefing that the defendants' failure to raise any 
arguments regarding the standard which must be applied to the alleged instrumentalities of the conspiracy that are not formal 
components of the UEP program—such as the export program, the agreement to limit new construction, the chick-hatch 
reductions, the forced molts, and the coordinated slaughter of hens—should be interpreted as an implicit acknowledgement that 
these actions are per se unlawful. The Court does not see any such concession in Defendants' briefing; nor have Plaintiffs 
articulated a legal basis for finding an implicit concession. The Court has not been asked to determine what standard applies to 
these components of the conspiracy and, therefore, the Court will refrain from engaging this issue sua sponte. "
1637,3," The plaintiffs' opposition to the defendants' statement of material fact states that these facts are disputed, yet the argument and 
citations presented in support do not directly address the statements as articulated by the defendants. Both the IPPS and the 
DAPs argue that this statement about hen health and productivity is misleading, because they have proffered [**30]  evidence 
indicating that any efficiency increases were offset by reductions in flock size. This argument, however, addresses the ultimate 
question of how the fact-finder should evaluate the procompetitive aspects of the programs—the evidence identified by the 
plaintiffs does not challenge that the agreement could offer such a procompetitive benefit, and should therefore be considered 
under the rule of reason. "
1638,4," The IPPs argue that the ""Defendants' ability to point to plausible procompetitive benefits does not preclude the application of 
the per se rule"" and that even if the application of the per se rule results in an erroneous outcome in some cases, it is 
nevertheless appropriate in light of ""business certainty and litigation efficiency."" IPP Memo at 31 (citing Arizona v. Maricopa Cry. 
Med. Soc., 457 U.S. 332, 351, 102 S. Ct. 2466, 73 L. Ed. 2d 48 (1982), N. Tex. Speciality Physicians v. FTC, 528 F.3d 346, 360 
(5th Cir. 2008)). Here, the plaintiffs have not alleged that the defendants explicitly agreed to fix prices—rather they allege that "
1639,," the defendants entered into a series of interrelated agreements, all of which ultimately had the effect of reducing supply. The 
Supreme Court repeatedly has emphasized that the application of the per se rule is only proper in instances where there has 
been experience dealing with the specific challenged business practices at issue and where the Court can determine, from the 
face of the agreement, it is of the type which will always or almost always restrain trade. Leegin, 551 U.S. at 886-87 (""The per se 
rule is appropriate only after courts have had considerable experience [**35]  with the type of restraint at issue.""); Broadcast 
Music, 441 U.S. at 9; Maricopa County Medical Soc., 457 U.S. at 344."
1639,5," As noted supra, while not named in the defendant's motions, the Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs were allowed to submit post 
hearing briefing addressing the arguments regarding the applicability of the per se rule. The arguments raised are essentially the 
same as those put forward by the other plaintiffs groups—namely that the subjective purpose of the conspiracy was to reduce 
supply and that supply reduction conspiracies are per se unlawful. Consequently, the Court need not separately address them."
1639,6," While the term ""smoking gun"" is typically associated with the clearest, most direct type of evidence, its use in this context is 
somewhat misleading. A ""smoking gun,"" in truth, is circumstantial evidence of a shooting as it requires certain additional 
inferences, namely, seeing the post-trigger pulling, puffs of smoke and deducing the immediate preceding events. "
1640,7," While the IPPs state in their [**39]  brief that there is circumstantial evidence of a side agreement, they fail to provide any 
substantive opposition on this point. Rather, the focus of their argument is that they need not prove the existence of a side 
agreement in order to prove anticompetitive conduct. See IPP Br. at 40. This, however, is not responsive to the defendants' 
motion. Ultimately, for the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that neither the DAPs nor the IPPs have come forward with 
evidence to establish the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact regarding the existence of a side agreement to refrain 
from expanding and for this reason grants the defendants' motion on this point as to both plaintiffs groups."
1640,8," The DAPs acknowledge that the defendants did expand production via purchasing existing facilities. Again, there is no 
circumstantial evidence indicating that this decision was the result of an agreement, rather than motivated by individual 
economic incentives."
1640,9," The issue of conscious parallel behavior was not raised by the plaintiffs as a basis for dismissing the defendants' summary 
judgment motion. Nevertheless, the Court notes that the record does not appear to provide evidence supporting this [**40]  
theory. Demonstrating conscious parallelism requires showing the following: ""(1) the defendants' behavior was parallel; (2) the 
defendants were aware of each other's conduct and that this awareness was an element in their decision-making process; and 
(3) certain 'plus factors,' which must include that the actions were contrary to the defendants' economic interests, and that there 
was some motivation to enter into such an agreement."" Cosmetic Gallery, Inc. v. Schoeneman Corp., 495 F.3d 46, 53-54 (3d 
Cir. 2007) (citing Inter Vest, 340 F.3d at 165). Based upon the evidence highlighted by the DAPs, there is no evidence that the 
defendants were aware of each other's conduct and that this awareness was an element of their decision-making process. "
1642,10," In the omnibus reply briefing, the Defendants note that, at the time DPP counsel made the referenced statement concerning 
the DPPs continued intention to pursue a per se theory, the DAPs had not opted out of the DPP class. Even if the Court were to 
find that the DAPs were bound by Mr. Hausfeld's statements, this argument does not explain why the Court should find that the 
IPPs would also be so bound. "

1660,3," Although Honeywell claims that the ""in commerce"" requirement is not met because a number of the sales are to foreign airlines

(emphasis added). This means that a moving party's response ""shall contain ... in the case of any disagreement, specific

Corp., 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16680, 2002 WL 31006128, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 5, 2002). Local Rule 56.1(a) further warns that ""all 
material facts set forth in [the non-moving party's statement of additional facts] will be deemed admitted unless controverted by 
the statement of the moving party."" N.D. Ill. R. 56.1(a) (emphasis added). Here, Northshore [*12]  offers no record evidence 
rebutting the Class's allegation that ""[n]o non-assignment MCO contracts were signed between the date of merger and February 
10, 2000,"" PSOF ¶ 9, so the Court will treat that allegation as undisputed. See Curtis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 807 F.3d 215, 
219 (7th Cir. 2015) (""It is the litigants' duty to clearly identify material facts in dispute and provide the admissible evidence that 
tends to prove or disprove the proffered fact. A litigant who denies a material fact is required to provide the admissible evidence 
that supports his denial in a clear, concise, and obvious fashion, for quick reference of the court.""). Merely denying allegations on 
the grounds that they are ""vague and unsupported by the evidence cited"" does not meet Local Rule 56.1's requirements. See 
Ammons v. Aramark Unif. Servs., Inc., 368 F.3d 809, 817 (7th Cir. 2004) (district courts should mandate and enforce strict 
compliance with Local Rule 56.1)."
1665,11," One of the MCOs amended its contract with NorthShore effective January 1, 2000; but NorthShore signed the amendment in 
November 1999 before notifying the MCOs that NorthShore would provide services under the existing rates, terms, and 
conditions set forth in its (or Highland Park Hospital's) preexisting contract with the MCO. See PSOF ¶ 9; Def.'s Resp. PSOF ¶ 9."
1665,12," Again, NorthShore fails to properly respond to the [*13]  Class's Statement of Additional Facts. In response to the Class's 
allegation that ""[n]one of the MCO contracts which were renegotiated post-merger were signed prior to [one MCO] signing its 
contract on February 23, 2000,"" PSOF ¶ 11, Northshore states that it ""admits that a contract with [that MCO] was signed by [the 
MCO] on or about February 23, 2000, however the contract's effective date was January 1, 2000. NorthShore denies the 
remainder of this statement."" Def.'s Resp. PSOF ¶ 11 (internal citation omitted). Because NorthShore's response here does not 
contradict, but rather only tries to add more information—namely, that NorthShore and [one MCO] agreed to retroactively apply 
their renegotiated contract, compare PSOF ¶ 11, with Def.'s Resp. PSOF ¶ 11—the Court will treat the Class's contention as 
undisputed. Cf. Ammons, 368 F.3d at 817 (""In this case, several of Ammons' responses to Aramark's allegations admit to the 
allegation but then add other additional facts. These facts should have been included in a separate statement.""). "
1666,13," A First Amended Complaint had been filed a year earlier in November 2007. R. 22, Am. Compl."
1666,14," Paragraphs 16 and 33 of the Second Amended Complaint quote, but do not cite to, the FTC opinion affirming that NorthShore 
violated the federal antitrust laws."
1666,15," Back in December 2007, NorthShore moved to dismiss the Class claims as time barred, R. 32, but the previously assigned 
judge denied the motion, R. 77, because the face of the complaint did not establish the accrual date for the claims. "
1667,16," The Class alleges that Northshore illegally monopolized the relevant market for healthcare services (Count 1), Second Am. 
Compl. ¶¶ 42-50, or in the alternative, attempted to monopolize the relevant market for healthcare services (Count 2), id. ¶¶ 51-
56. For convenience's sake, the Court will refer to both counts together as the Class's ""Section 2"" claim."
1667,17," Alternatively, the Class asserts that, under the discovery rule, their claims did not accrue until the FTC filed its complaint 
against NorthShore on February 10, 2004. Pl.'s Resp. Br. at 12-14. According to the Class, the ""notorious opacity of hospital 
pricing"" prevented them from discovering their antitrust injuries until February 2004 when the FTC announced—via its 
complaint—""that th[e] merger might be anticompetitive ... ."" Id. at 14."
1667,18," The Class definition is broad enough to include any unlawful overcharges that the Class paid ""from at least as early as 
January 1, 2000 ... ."" R. 587, 12/10/2013 Class Certification Order (emphasis added). In its response brief, the Class does not 
explicitly point to any overcharges that class members paid before February 10, 2000, [*21]  but it does contend that 
""[NorthShore] may have raised a handful of prices in the 40 days after the merger."" See Pls.' Resp. Br. at 7. For this reason, the 
Court addresses whether claims based on any pre-February 10, 2000 overcharges are time-barred. See infra Section III.B. "
1668,19," NorthShore makes a last-ditch argument in its summary judgment brief, asserting that Section 16(i) does not apply to the 
Class claims because the FTC did not file its complaint ""during the four-year limitations period starting on January 1, 2000."" 
Def.'s Summ. J. Br. at 20 (emphasis added). To support this argument, NorthShore points to the last sentence in Section 16(i), 
which states ""[t]hat whenever the running of the statute of limitations ... is suspended hereunder, any action to enforce such 
cause of action shall be forever barred unless commenced either within the period of suspension or within four years after the 
cause of action accrued."" 15 U.S.C. § 16(i) (emphasis added). The obvious problem is that NorthShore's argument assumes that 
the four-year limitations period started on January 1, 2000. In other words, NorthShore attempts to bootstrap its § 16(i) argument 
to its accrual-upon-merger argument. So, whether NorthShore can prevail on its § 16(i) [*24]  argument, turns on when the 
Section 2 and Section 7 claims accrued—issues which the Court addresses next. See infra Section III.A.2. So there is actually 
no independent argument in NorthShore's favor based on this filing date of the FTC's complaint. "
1669,20," The discovery rule ""is read into statutes of limitations in federal-question cases ... in the absence of a contrary directive from 
Congress,"" Cada, 920 F.2d at 450, which is precisely the case here. In fact, the Seventh Circuit and the Northern District of 
Illinois have applied the discovery rule to federal antitrust claims. See In re Copper Antitrust Litig., 436 F.3d 782, 789-90 (7th Cir. 
2006) (analyzing whether the discovery rule applied to the plaintiffs' Sherman Act and Clayton Act claims); see also, e.g., Shuffle 
Tech Int'l, LLC v. Sci. Games Corp., 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 138741, 2015 WL 5934834, at *15 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 12, 2015) 
(acknowledging that the discovery rule could apply to a Section 7 cause of action); Nat'l Black Expo v. Clear Channel Broad., 
Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9783, 2007 WL 495307, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 8, 2007) (acknowledging that the discovery rule could 
apply to a Section 2 cause of action)."
1669,21," Heard acknowledges that courts differ on whether the continuing violations doctrine operates to toll an already-running 
limitations clock or instead to set an accrual date (that is, the start, or restart, of the limitations clock). 253 F.3d at 319 (""But the 
usual and it seems to us the correct characterization of the doctrine of continuing violation is that it is a doctrine governing 
accrual, not a tolling doctrine, because we don't want the plaintiff to sue before the violation is complete. Tolling rules create 
defenses; they are optional with the plaintiff; he can sue as soon as his claim accrues. We therefore delay the accrual date 
when, quite independent of the plaintiff's wishes, we want to delay his right to bring suit."" [*27]  (internal citations omitted)). "
1670,22," NorthShore asserts that Berkey is irrelevant: Berkey applies where ""a monopolist waits until sometime after it acquires a 
monopoly to charge an unlawful price,"" and here, NorthShore contends, ""no time lapse existed between the anticompetitive 
conduct (the [m]erger) and the alleged exercise of monopoly power (the alleged overcharges)."" Def.'s Summ. J. Br. at 11-12. To 
support this argument, NorthShore cites to the Second Amended Complaint, see id., which alleges that NorthShore exercised its 
monopoly power by increasing its prices ""immediately"" after, or ""coincident"" with, the merger, see Second Am. Compl. ¶ 16. But 
phrases like ""immediately"" and ""coincident"" must be interpreted in context—here, that ""context"" refers to a merger amongst three 
major northern Chicago hospitals. Sure, perhaps the merger formally took place on January 1, 2000, but mergers are not over 
and done with in a day. In fact, it took NorthShore six months just to equalize the hospitals' chargemasters. PSOF ¶ 13; Def.'s 
Resp. PSOF ¶ 13. So the Court declines to read the Class's [*30]  allegation that NorthShore ""immediately"" increased its prices 
""coincident"" with the merger as alleging that NorthShore increased its prices ""on January 1, 2000."" The Court also notes that in 
any event, Berkey held that a purchaser's claim does not accrue until ""the purchaser[] ... actually pays the [supracompetitive 
price]."" 603 F.2d at 295 (emphasis added). So the key issue is when the Class paid NorthShore's supracompetitive prices, not 
whether NorthShore ""immediately"" increased its prices on January 1, 2000. "
1671,23," As a reminder, to the extent that the Class argues that NorthShore increased its prices as of January 1, 2000 when it chose 
(subject to the MCO's consent) what contract would govern post-merger and that class members were harmed as a result of 
those supracompetitive price increases, the Court addresses those claims in Section III.B."
1671,24," To support this argument, Northshore relies on commentary from a leading antitrust treatise discussing the accrual rule for 
Section 2 claims: Customers of the monopolist are not injured until after the monopolist causes them injury through higher prices, which may 
occur later than the exclusionary practices creating the monopoly. For example, competitors are injured immediately by 
predatory pricing, but customers would not be injured until much later, when the predation has done its work and the 
monopolist raises its price. Once customers have reason to know of the violation and their damages are sufficiently 
ascertainable to justify an antitrust action, the statute begins to run against them. Phillip E. Areeda & Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application, ¶ 320c4 (3d & 
4th eds. and 2015 Cum. Supp.); see also Def.'s [*35]  Summ. J. Br. at 14. The problem is that this excerpt actually supports applying the discovery rule to postpone starting the limitations period until the 
Class knew (or had reason to know) that NorthShore had charged supracompetitive prices. As the treatise points out, the class 
members were not injured until after NorthShore ""cause[d] them injury through higher prices,"" which occurred once the parties' 
renegotiated contracts took effect. Areeda & Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their 
Application, ¶ 320c4. And even once the renegotiated contracts took effect, the Section 2 claims would not have actually 
accrued until the class members ""ha[d] reason to know"" that they paid supracompetitive prices for healthcare services. Id. "
1672,25," NorthShore asserts [*38]  that one letter it sent to one MCO put that particular MCO on notice that NorthShore was going to 
choose the ""more favorable"" contract to govern the parties' post-merger relationship. Def.'s Summ. J. Br. at 8. But that letter only 
implies that NorthShore and the MCO would utilize whichever preexisting contract was ""better,"" not that NorthShore was going 
to choose whichever preexisting contract charged higher rates. See Pls.' Resp. Br. at 5 n.3. "
1673,26," See also Heard, 253 F.3d at 320 (""In between the case in which a single event gives rise to continuing injuries and the case in 
which a continuous series of events gives rise to a cumulative injury is the case in which repeated events give rise to discrete 
injuries.""). "
1674,27," The Class interprets the holding in du Pont and the hold-and-use doctrine generally as part and parcel of the continuing 
violations doctrine. See Pls.' Resp. Br. at 23-24. But the hold-and-use doctrine applies where the defendant lawfully acquires 
assets, but then later uses those assets in a manner that inflicts anticompetitive injury. See E. I. du Pont, 353 U.S. at 597-98. 
The continuing violations doctrine, by contrast, applies where the defendant causes continuing and accumulating harm. Heard, 
253 F.3d at 319. "
1675,28," The plaintiff had alleged that the defendant DIC-Underhill ""abused its pre-eminent market position by posting performance 
bonds for building projects on which [*46]  it ha[d] applied for the concrete subcontract in exchange for which the prime 
contractor award[ed] it the job without soliciting competitive bids."" Julius Nasso, 467 F. Supp. at 1019. "
1677,29," It bears repeating that NorthShore claims that one letter it sent to one MCO put that MCO on notice that it would choose 
whichever contract—the MCO's preexisting contract with Northshore or its preexisting contract [*54]  with Highland Park 
Hospital—was ""more favorable"" to NorthShore. See Def.'s Summ. J. Br. at 8. But again, that letter only implies that NorthShore 
and that one MCO would utilize whichever preexisting contract was ""better,"" not that NorthShore was going to choose whichever 
preexisting contract charged higher rates. See Pls.' Resp. Br. at 5 n.3. "
1681,1," The Court also dismisses Melton's argument to the extent he claims federal law pre-empts the State's claims. While ""[o]n 
occasion, . . . the pre-emptive force of a statute is so 'extraordinary' that it 'converts an ordinary state common-law complaint into 
one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule,"" that is not the case here. Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams,

1686,5," The Second Amended Complaint separately discusses in detail a number of Dang family patents and applications, including 
their relationship to the '897 patent and the Aetna RFP response. Paragraphs 315 through 347 discuss the '511 patent, which 
differs from the '897 patent in that it focuses on pharmaceutical claims data. Paragraphs 348 through 378 discuss the '560 
patent, which focuses on the ""clean periods"" used to detect the end of a treatment group. Paragraphs 379 through 409 discuss 
the '333 patent. Paragraphs 410 through 420 discuss application number 10/106,626, which focused [*12]  on the ""shifting"" "
1687,," concept but which OptumInsight ultimately abandoned. Paragraphs 421 through 457 discuss the '216 patent, which was initially 
rejected but ultimately issued after OptumInsight amended its claims. Paragraphs 458 through 503 discuss the '290 patent, 
which CCGroup contends is essentially identical to claims of previous patents, except that the '290 patent is directed to systems 
rather than methods. Paragraphs 504 through 524 discuss the '869 patent. Paragraphs 525 through 537 discuss the '165 patent, 
which the examiner determined was not distinct from previous patents until OptumInsight amended its application to add 
references to a computer processor. Paragraphs 538 through 549 discuss the '433 patent, which was also initially rejected but 
issued after references to computer processors were added. Several of these patents were only issued after OptumInsight filed 
terminal disclaimers against enforceability beyond the expiration dates of earlier-issued patents. See, e.g., SAC ¶ 531. CCGroup 
contends that the invention described and offered for sale in the Aetna RFP response embodied or rendered obvious most if not 
all of the claims in the patents discussed above. See, e.g., id. ¶ 546. A chart comparing specific claims of the patents [*13]  at 
issue to language in the RFP response is attached to the Second Amended Complaint as Exhibit B."

1693,10," CCGroup does not challenge OptumInsight's submission of these declarations, and the Court agrees that they are appropriate 
for consideration at the pleading stage under the incorporation by reference doctrine because the Second Amended Complaint 
references and relies on them for the allegation that Symmetry engaged in fraud during the '897 reexamination. "
1695,11," The standard of review at this stage does not call upon to Court to determine whether a contrary interpretation would also be 
permissible, and the Court declines to do so."
1695,12," OptumInsight responds to CCGroup's challenge to its evidence by stating that ""[i]t is difficult to tell how seriously Plaintiff 
intends its 'Motion to Strike.'"" Reply at 15. Regardless of how seriously CCGroup may have intended it, the Court takes the legal 
standard for review at the pleading stage seriously. "
1696,13," OptumInsight argues for the first time in its reply that CCGroup's allegations [*44]  regarding the source code do not comply 
with Exergen's requirement that allegations be tied to specific claims of the patents at issue. Reply at 6-7. That standard was 
crucial to the Court's previous order and was the purported basis for CCGroup's amendment. If OptumInsight believes that the 
Second Amended Complaint did not sufficiently tie its allegations to specific patent claims, there is no reason it could not have 
raised that argument in its motion, and allowed CCGroup opportunity to respond. The Court deems such arguments waived. 
See, e.g., McMillan v. United States, 112 F.3d 1040, 1047 (9th Cir. 1997) (""This argument was raised for the first time in the 
plaintiffs' reply brief and has therefore been waived."")."
1696,14," OptumInsight notes that CCGroup ""omits the time and place at which the information was allegedly provided to Dorsey,"" Mot. 
at 25, but cites no authority holding that such detail is required in pleading knowledge or intent—the issue that the alleged 
provision of information goes to here. Under Rule 9(b), knowledge and intent may be alleged generally. "
1698,15," Even if this were not so, CCGroup has plausible alleged such knowledge as discussed below. "
1699,16," Counsel for OptumInsight suggested at the hearing that the Court had already considered this issue in its previous Order by 
treating Exergen as harmonizing the standards for inequitable conduct and Walker Process fraud. The harmonization at issue 
there was the sort of conduct before the USPTO that supports a claim, and whether the Federal Circuit's statement in 
Nobelpharma that ""inequitable conduct is a broader, more inclusive concept than the common law fraud needed to support a 
Walker Process counterclaim,"" 141 F.3d at 1069, remains accurate in light of Exergen and, more significantly, Therasense. See 
Order at 20 n.14. This Court did not at that time assume that Exergen's pleading standard for knowledge of material 
misrepresentation [*56]  by the person prosecuting a patent in the context of establishing inequitable conduct also applies in the 
context of a Walker Process claim to the separate issue of pleading knowledge of past fraud on the USPTO by the person later 
initiating litigation. "
1702,1," The moving defendants are United Egg Producers, Inc., United States Egg Marketers, Inc., Cal-Maine Foods, Inc., Rose Acre 
Farms, Inc., R.W. Sauder, Inc., and Ohio Fresh Eggs. Cal-Maine Foods is no longer a party to, and does not join the motion as 
to Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc., C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company, L.P., v. 
Michael Foods., Inc., et al., No. 11-00510."
1702,2," Because the motion with regards to the DAPs claims for damages from non-parties is being granted as unopposed, [*3]  see 
Section III, infra, the Court will not recount the full factual record relevant to that argument here."
1702,3," The DAPs filed their complaints later, between November 16, 2010 and January 25, 2011. "
1703,4," While the defendants' briefing generally only references the DAPs model, the motion itself is directed against both the DPPs 
and DAPs."
1703,5," While the DAPs contend that the conspiracy is ongoing, they seek to recover damages through the end of 2012. Their 
damages expert, Dr. Baye, uses a December 2012 end date for his analysis. "
1707,6," The plaintiffs repeatedly refer to the Arizona ""statute,"" but the Court assumes these are references to the Arizona regulation 
mandating that eggs sold or produced in the state comply with the 2008 UEP Guidelines. There has been no other argument or 
citation to a relevant Arizona ""statute,"" so the Court will interpret this to refer to the regulations cited by the defendants in their 
briefing. "
1708,7," The DPPs do present one argument on this point which merits some additional discussion. The DPPs contend that there are 
two ways to read the relevant regulation. The first is that, by mandating that producers comply with the UEP guidelines, the state "
1709,," of Arizona has delegated authority to the UEP to extra-legislatively amend the regulations by adopting new guidelines—
something which the UEP has done twice since the Arizona regulations were passed. The regulations, however, expressly 
foreclose this reading. The plaintiffs' general contention that the UEP guidelines are a ""living document subject to changes as 
new scientific information becomes available"" may very well be accurate, but this does not imply that the state of Arizona has 
abdicated rule making authority to the UEP. See DPP Exhibit 8 at 2. While the guidelines have been amended twice since 2008, 
the regulation in question indicates that these amendments are not covered by the definition of UEP [*28]  Certified Program for 
purposes of Arizona's rule."
1709,*," * * Alternatively, the DPPs argue that if the Court were to conclude—as it does—that the regulations simply adopted the 2008 
guidelines as the State's own, then a defendant's compliance with the UEP guidelines in force now would have nothing to do 
with compliance with the Arizona regulations, and therefore these regulations could not be invoked by the defendants as a shield 
against liability. While the DPPs correctly point out the wording of the regulation could lead to a somewhat confusing situation 
wherein the Arizona requirements of ""UEP Certification"" under the regulation differ from the requirements set out in the UEP's 
most recent guidelines, the Court finds that for present case purposes, this potential incongruity does not alter the ultimate 
conclusion. The plaintiffs have not disputed the fact that both the 2008 and 2014 guidelines include the three principle supply 
reducing practices challenged in this case: namely, cage space limits, the 100% rule, and restrictions on backfilling. 
Consequently, regardless of whether there are any other inconsistences between the Arizona regulations and the currently 
effective UEP guidelines, [*29]  Arizona has nevertheless mandated that, in order to sell or produce eggs in the state, the 
defendants would have to engage in these specified practices. "
1724,1," This exclusivity period is granted via the Hatch-Waxman Act, and has nothing to do with whether the drug is covered by a 
patent."
1724,2," It is a common practice for a brand manufacturer to market its own generic version of the drug when generic entry occurs. 
Unlike an ANDA filer, the brand manufacturer is not barred from entering the generic market during the 180-day exclusivity 
period to which the first paragraph IV filer is entitled. See Teva Pharm. Indus. Ltd. v. Crawford, 410 F.3d 51, 54, 366 U.S. App. 
D.C. 203 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (holding that 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) did not prevent the filer of the original NDA from launching its 
own generic during the 180-day exclusivity period)."
1724,3," An orphan drug is used to treat a rare disease or ailment. Because pharmaceutical companies may lack the financial incentive 
to develop such drugs, the Orphan Drug Act provides the brand manufacturer with a seven-year period of non-patent exclusivity. 
See 21 U.S.C. § 360cc(a). "
1725,4," In a reverse-payment settlement, ""a party with no claim for damages (something that is usually true of a paragraph IV litigation 
defendant) walks away with money simply so that it will stay away from the patentee's market."" F.T.C. v. Actavis, Inc. 133 S. Ct. 
2223, 2233, 186 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2013). Such agreements are subject to antitrust scrutiny under the ""rule of reason"" inquiry 
because such settlements, ""where large and unjustified, can bring with it the risk of significant anticompetitive effects."" Id. at 
2237."
1725,5," Generic manufacturer Apotex Inc. nonetheless filed a declaratory judgment action in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 
June 2006 alleging non-infringement, invalidity, and unenforceability of the '516 patent. Apotex Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., No. 2:06-
cv-2768, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 125859, 2011 WL 6090696, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 7, 2011). The District Court held that the patent 
was invalid [**13]  and unenforceable on November 7, 2011, a ruling which was upheld on appeal. Apotex Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 
500 F. App'x 959 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (per curiam). The District Court, in a separate opinion, also held that Apotex would not infringe 
the '516 patent. Apotex, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., No. 2:06-cv-2768, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43479, 2012 WL 1080148, at *1 (E.D. 
Pa. Mar. 28, 2012) "
1726,6," Other parties challenging the reverse-payment settlement agreements are a putative class of end-payors, generic competitor 
Apotex Inc., several retail plaintiffs, and the F.T.C., which originally filed suit in the District Court for the District of Colombia 
before being transferred to Judge Goldberg's docket. The FTC sued only Cephalon. Teva purchased Cephalon on October 14, 
2011, and on May 18, 2015, the F.T.C. settled with Teva for $1.2 billion. The remaining suits are consolidated for purposes of 
liability, and they have all been [**14]  stayed pending our ruling on the DPP class certification issue. "
1728,7," Despite [**23]  this conclusion, we recognize the thoughtful work of the District Court, which was diligently done even though 
there is a paucity of precedent on the numerosity issue. "
1729,8," Defendants raised two other challenges to the size of the class before the District Court and in a cursory manner on appeal. 
They argue (1) that named plaintiff King Drug Company of Florence, Inc. (""King Drug"") should not be included in the class 
because it went out of business before generic modafinil entered the market in 2012, and thus there is no way of knowing if it 
would have even purchased generic modafinil, and (2) that Drogueria Betances should not be included in the class because all 
of its brand modafinil purchases were made after generic entry. We see no need to question the inclusion of these two class 
members. King Drug presented testimony showing that it would have purchased generic modafinil instead of Provigil if it had 
been on the market. Similarly, the experts of both parties agreed that it takes several months before prices fall to competitive 
levels [**27]  after generic entry. Because Drogueria Betances made its brand modafinil purchases only one month after generic 
entry, it is conceivable that it paid an overcharge. "
1730,9," Nearly identical language is found in the Second Restatement of Contracts, which was pending approval at the time of In re 
Fine Paper Litigation. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 326 (""[A]n assignment of a part of a right . . . is operative as to 
that part to the same extent and in the same manner as if the part had been a separate right."")."
1730,10," HN17[
] Although normally ""Rule 23(a)(1) does not require a plaintiff to offer direct evidence of the exact number and identities of the class members,"" Marcus v. BMW of N.A., LLC, 687 F.3d 583, 596 (3d Cir. 2012), when the number of class 
members is so small that any deviation may impact the district court's numerosity analysis, plaintiffs must provide evidence of 
each class member's identity or risk having that member not counted. The declaration of the settlement administrator that there 
are three more class members is not enough in this case, where we are at the low end of what is deemed to be a sufficient 
number of class members. This is particularly true where all assignees — partial or otherwise — are large corporations whose 
identity is easily ascertainable. On remand, Plaintiffs will need to provide more evidence concerning these three potential class 
members if they wish to have them counted for numerosity purposes. "
1731,11," The superiority analysis required under Rule 23(b)(3) similarly calls for an inquiry into judicial economy and places great 
weight on whether the individual members can bring their own claims. However, superiority, unlike numerosity, considers 
alternatives to class actions other than joinder. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) (requiring an inquiry into whether ""a class action is 
superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy""); In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litig., 
391 F.3d 516, 533-34 (3d Cir. 2004) (""The superiority requirement 'asks the court to balance, in terms of fairness and efficiency, 
the merits of a class action against those of alternative available methods of adjudication.'"" (quoting In re Prudential Ins. Co. Am. 
Sales Practice Litig. Agent Actions, 148 F.3d 283, 316 (3d Cir. 1998))); Id. at 534 (finding superiority to be satisfied because 
""there are a potentially large number of class members in this matter . . . . [and] each consumer has a very small claim in relation 
to the cost of prosecuting a lawsuit. Thus, from the consumers' [**34]  standpoint, a class action facilitates spreading of the 
litigation costs among the numerous injured parties and encourages private enforcement of the statutes.""). Numerosity, of 
course, is a prerequisite to all class actions, while a finding of superiority is necessary only in a (b)(3) suit. "
1732,12," The third purpose behind class actions mentioned in Marcus, the HN20[
] due process concern of protecting the ability of 
individual members to bring their own claims, Marcus, 687 F.3d at 594-95, is not present in Rule 23(b)(3) actions where 
members have the right to opt out of the class and where the identity of all class members is ascertainable such that there will 
be no difficulties in ensuring that they receive notice of the representative action. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B)(v)."
1732,13," The dissent does not ""read the District Court's analysis [of the judicial economy factor] as turning upon a consideration of the 
late stage of the proceeding."" However, this analysis consisted of three sentences in a single paragraph, each of which focused 
on the late stage of the proceeding. King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 309 F.R.D. 195, 206-07 (E.D. Pa. 2015). 
We also note that the District Court's entire numerosity section spanned three pages, one of which is nothing more than a 
summary of the parties' arguments."
1732,14," The dissent cites several cases that it claims ""recognize that it is appropriate for courts to consider the stage of the 
proceedings when weighing judicial economy."" None of these cases are class actions though, which we again emphasize are 
the ""exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only."" Wal-Mart 
Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 348, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 180 L. Ed. 2d 374 (2011) (quoting Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 
682, 700-01, 99 S. Ct. 2545, 61 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1979)). "
1733,15," Weiss was abrogated on other grounds by Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 136 S. Ct.663, 193 L. Ed. 2d 571 (2016). However, 
its reasoning concerning the impropriety of ""premature certification decisions"" was reaffirmed in Richardson, 2016 U.S. App. 
LEXIS 12997, 2016 WL 3854216, at *4."
1733,16," The District Court also considered the effects on judicial economy if individual suits in separate jurisdictions would be filed 
absent class certification. However, HN25[
] the text of Rule 23(a)(1) envisions only two scenarios: joinder of all class members or a class action. Fed R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1) (inquiring whether ""joinder of all members is impracticable""). The possibility of 
individual suits filed in separate jurisdictions is not a consideration [**41]  that a district court should entertain in deciding 
numerosity vel non."
1733,17," In the District Court, Defendants never asked for discovery from unnamed class members. Defendants claim that a request for 
discovery of unnamed class members would have been futile because it is highly [**42]  circumscribed. However, the citations 
that they provide in support of this view make clear that this is merely a heightened standard, and if they could show a need for 
discovery from unnamed class members the District Court would allow it. See 5 Moore's Federal Practice § 33.20 (""Reasonable 
discovery . . . should be permitted from unnamed class members when the special circumstances of the case justify it.""); Clark v. 
Universal Builders, Inc., 501 F.2d 324, 341 (7th Cir. 1974) (""The taking of depositions of absent class members is — as is true of 
written interrogatories — appropriate in special circumstances.""). "
1734,18," The dissent suggests that we proclaim this rule ""without any citation to authority."" Of course, our dissenting colleague fails to 
provide any citation to authority to support a contrary rule. In fact, the only authorities that we can find to support the dissent's 
position are the District Court's opinion in this case, and another district court opinion from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania 
upon which the District Court here relied, In re Wellbutrin XL Antitrust Litig., No. 08-2431, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 90075, 2011 
WL 3563385, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 11, 2011). This is a matter of first impression for any court of appeals. Indeed, our Court has 
never even identified the factors that a district court should consider in its numerosity analysis despite the dissent's assertion that 
the District Court in this case ""properly considered every factor we have ever held to be relevant"" in this analysis. We cannot 
abdicate our responsibility to conduct a de novo review of legal issues. See In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 
305, 312 (3d Cir. 2008) (recognizing that although class certification decisions are reviewed [**44]  for abuse of discretion, 
""[w]hether an incorrect legal standard has been used is an issue of law to be reviewed de novo"" (internal quotation marks 
omitted))."
1734,19," We read Marcus's language about the ability ""to litigate individually,"" Marcus, 687 F.3d at 594, to refer to each plaintiff 
appearing on the record as a joined party, and not whether each individual plaintiff can litigate his or her own claim as the sole 
plaintiff. While the latter concern is certainly a policy justification for the class device generally, as we emphasize, Rule 23(a)(1) 
requires only the binary choice between class actions and joinder of all parties."
1734,20," Other considerations may be relevant to a district court in determining class members' ability and motivation to be joined as 
named plaintiffs. For example, the District Court here recognized that a fear [**46]  of retaliation may hinder the ability and 
motivation of a party to appear as a named plaintiff. In this case, the District Court noted that there was no proof of any fear of 
retaliation, and we do not disturb that factual finding on appeal. King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. Cephalon, Inc., 309 F.R.D. 
195, 207 (E.D. Pa. 2015)."
1734,21," HN29[
] A negative value claim is a ""claim[] that could not be brought on an individual basis because the transaction costs of 
bringing an individual action exceed the potential relief."" In re Baby Prods. Antitrust Litig., 708 F.3d 163, 179 (3d Cir. 2013). "
1735,22," HN30[
] While discovery from joined parties is not subject to the heightened discovery standard of unnamed class members, 
even in a non-class action a district court has the discretion to limit unnecessary discovery pursuant to Rule 26(b)(2)(C)."
1735,23," The dissent contends that we misread the District Court's analysis, and argues that ""the focus of the District Court's opinion is 
on joinder throughout."" Yet every reference to joinder that the dissent cites comes from portions of the District Court opinion that 
were not about the ability of the plaintiffs to litigate via joinder. Instead, these references are: ""[j]oinder of the absent class 
members would likely require additional rounds of discovery,"" which appears in the judicial economy section; ""[t]he considerable 
geographic dispersion of the parties would certainly present challenges to plaintiffs in attempting to coordinate the litigation if all 
class members were joined,"" which obviously is in the geographic dispersion section; and ""Plaintiffs have demonstrated by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the parties are sufficiently numerous so as to make joinder impracticable,"" which is in the 
conclusion of the numerosity analysis. Even a cursory look at the section on the ability and incentive of the class members to 
litigate reveals that the District [**49]  Court was focused on the alternative of individual suits, not on joinder. See King Drug, 309 
F.R.D. at 207 (""Two factors that may weigh against Plaintiffs are the financial resources of the class members and the parties' 
abilities to bring individual suits."") (emphasis added); Id. (""These prospective class members likely do not have the same 
incentive to engage in costly antitrust litigation on their own."") (emphasis added). To the extent that the District Court did properly 
consider the alternative of joinder, as the dissent contends, on remand the District Court has the opportunity to more clearly 
state this when it conducts its rigorous numerosity analysis. At this point, the references to ""individual suits"" and ""on their own"" 
prominently stand out when surrounded by the references to ""joinder"" in the other sections."
1735,24," Most of the dissent's possible reasons why the class members would not be likely to join as named plaintiffs — ""desire to have 
one's self and own law firm control the litigation, choice of favorable forum, familiarity with the local jurisdictions laws and 
procedures, [and] fear of being dragged into settlement"" — are equally applicable to the decision of whether to opt out of the 
class. See Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 813, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1985) (discussing [**50]  the 
importance of allowing opt outs because if a ""plaintiff's claim is sufficiently large or important that he wishes to litigate it on his 
own, he will likely have retained an attorney or have thought about filing suit, and should be fully capable of exercising his right 
to 'opt out'""). Moreover, these reasons do not show why joinder is ""impracticable""; they simply show that joinder may not be the 
preferred method of proceeding with the case. If a plaintiff wants to proceed individually, it has that choice. The plaintiff does not 
need to join the suit — just as it need not remain a member of a certified class — if it wants to control its own litigation, choose a 
more favorable forum, select a jurisdiction whose laws and procedures it is familiar with, or avoid being dragged into a 
settlement. Cf. In re Diet Drugs Prods. Liability Litig., 369 F.3d 293, 308 (3d Cir. 2004) (""By waiving an initial opt-out, the class 
member surrenders what may be valuable rights, in return for countervailing benefits.""). "
1736,25," The dissent makes the argument that if the class were not certified, then several individual judges would have to address what 
it terms ""the real issues before the Court."" Yet the only other issue before the Court is the Comcast predominance issue. If the 
class were not certified because of a failure to satisfy the numerosity requirement, there would be no Comcast argument, as 
predominance is a question that arises only in the class action context. Additionally, the fact that there is a ""key issue"" that the 
parties seek to litigate does not justify class status."
1736,26," Rule 23(b)(3) also states that ""a class action [must be] superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating 
the controversy."" This second requirement — superiority [**55]  — is not at issue in this appeal. "
1737,27," Plaintiffs argue that we should exercise our pendent appellate jurisdiction and review the District Court's grant of summary 
judgment on the global antitrust [**56]  conspiracy claim because reversal on this claim would moot the Comcast issue. The use 
of the pendent appellate jurisdiction doctrine ""is an exercise of discretion by a Court of Appeals and should be used sparingly."" 
United States v. Spears, 859 F.2d 284, 287 (3d Cir. 1988). If we were to reverse on the Comcast issue, we would deem it 
prudent to examine the global antitrust conspiracy claim. However, because we would affirm on predominance grounds, we do 
not deem the class certification order and the summary judgment order to be so ""inextricably intertwined"" that the exercise of our 
pendent appellate jurisdiction would be appropriate. CTF Hotel Holdings, Inc. v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 381 F.3d 131, 136 (3d Cir. 
2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we express no view on the merits of Plaintiffs' global antitrust conspiracy 
claim. "

the predominance question, this argument by Defendants is inappropriate at the class certification stage. It has nothing to do 
with whether common questions of law and fact predominate, and instead goes to the issue of liability. See Tyson Foods, Inc. v.

A. Nagareda, Class Certification in the Age of Aggregate Proof, 84 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 97, 107 (2009)). "
1742,1," As the Majority notes, the third underpinning, to ""prevent[] putative class representatives and their counsel, [**74]  when joinder 
can be easily accomplished, from unnecessarily depriving members of a small class of their right to a day in court to adjudicate 
their own claims,"" id., is not relevant to 23(b)(3) actions. See Majority Op. 34 n.12."
1742,2," The Majority asserts that the factors we should consider have not been previously set forth. But Marcus's recitation of the 
policies that animate numerosity provides a helpful standard from which the factors to consider are readily discernible. "
1744,3," The Majority's references to ""sunk costs"" are inapt. See Majority Op. 37, 39, 40. Sunk costs are costs that have already 
incurred and cannot be recovered. See Verizon Communs., Inc. v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 499, 122 S. Ct. 1646, 152 L. Ed. 2d 701 
(2002) (""'Sunk costs' are unrecoverable past costs . . . ."" (emphasis added)). The District Court's analysis did not consider sunk 
costs, but rather the relative costs, going forward, of joinder and class litigation. To determine the relative costs, going forward, 
of joinder and class litigation, one needs to know how much remains to be done under either alternative."
1744,4," The Majority instructs district courts to consider whether, in a hypothetical world, joinder would have been more efficient than 
the class mechanism. Cf. Majority Op. 41 (""In other words, without considering the late stage of the litigation, it should determine 
whether a class action would have been a substantially more efficient mechanism [**82]  of litigating this suit than joinder of all 
parties. . . . At the same time, the District Court is free to rely on its superior understanding of how the case has proceeded to 
date for the purpose of determining whether the class mechanism would have actually been a substantially more efficient use of 
judicial resources than joinder of the parties at the onset of the litigation."")."
1744,5," The Majority, citing references to ""individual suits"" in the District Court's opinion, posits that ""[e]ven a cursory look at the section 
on the ability and incentive of the class members to litigate reveals that the District Court was focused on the alternative of 
individual suits, not on joinder."" See Majority Op. 44 n.23. But the two concepts are not exclusive of each other, as the Majority 
itself recognizes in footnote 19, when it ""read[s] Marcus's language about the ability 'to litigate individually,' to refer to each "
1745,," plaintiff appearing on the record as a joined party, and not whether each individual plaintiff can litigate his or her own claim as 
the sole plaintiff."" See Majority Op. 42 n.19 (citation omitted). Litigation not pursued on a classwide basis is individual litigation, 
even if pursued via joinder, and the parties joined in a proceeding remain responsible for the individual litigation of their claims. 
See 7 Wright & Miller, supra, § 1652 (""Consequently, rights that are separate and distinct under the governing law are [**84]  not 
transformed into joint rights when plaintiffs join under Rule 20 in a federal court action; each plaintiff's right of action remains 
distinct, as if it had been brought separately."")."
1745,6," This assertion stems from the defendants' argument that ""[e]ach of the 16 absent class members has the ability and the 
financial incentive to file its own claim."" See Appellants' Br. 45. The Majority [**85]  adopts this speculation as fact, but it is mere 
argument and speculation."

1745,8, This case would not be appropriate for an MDL as it is ready for trial and pre-trial proceedings are largely completed.
1745,9," See, e.g., In re: Sci. Drilling Int'l, Inc., FLSA Litig., 24 F. Supp. 3d 1364, 1364-65 (J.P.M.L. 2014) (""Plaintiffs oppose 
centralization as unnecessary, stating that they recognize the overlap in the actions and they already have agreed to coordinate 
pretrial proceedings to avoid duplicative discovery and inconsistent rulings.""); In re: Standard & Poor's Rating Agency Litig., 949 
F. Supp. 2d 1360, 1361 (J.P.M.L. 2013) (""Plaintiffs oppose centralization and argue, inter alia, that the Panel has never 
centralized litigation of this type, that transfer to a distant forum will inconvenience the states, and that transfer is unnecessary in 
light of the historic cooperation among state attorneys general.""); In re Le-Nature's, Inc., Commercial Litig., 609 F. Supp. 2d 
1372, 1373-74 (J.P.M.L. 2009) (""Plaintiffs opposed to centralization argue, inter alia, that (1) the allegations pertaining to the 
bottling actions make up only a minimal part of the Trustee's case; (2) all active parties to the bottling actions have admitted that 
Le-Nature's perpetrated a systematic fraudulent scheme and, therefore, a large portion of the allegations set forth in the 
Trustee's action is insignificant to the bottling actions; [**87]  (3) the bottling actions are straightforward fraud cases that can 
readily be handled by their respective district courts; and (4) discovery can be coordinated in the bottling actions without 
centralization.""). "
1746,10," The Majority contends that this is no ""run-of-the-mill class action"" given the top-heavy distribution of the claims among the 
class members. See Majority Op. 48. But whether the class looks like other classes is not controlling as to whether the 
requirements of Rule 23 have been met. Rule 23 was ""designed to allow an exception to the usual rule that litigation is 
conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only."" Califano, 442 U.S. at 700-01 (emphasis [**88]  added). The 
plaintiff's burden under Rule 23 is merely to demonstrate compliance by a preponderance of the evidence—not to establish 
""proof beyond any doubt."" Reyes v. Netdeposit, LLC, 802 F.3d 469, 485 (3d Cir. 2015). Here, given the evidence the plaintiffs 
have adduced regarding, inter alia, the impracticability of joinder and the predominance of common questions of law and fact, 
and given the paucity of contrary evidence adduced by the defendants, I reiterate that nothing about this case cries out for 
anything but class treatment. "
1748,1," The DAPs include Kroger Co., Safeway Inc., Albertsons LLC, Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, Inc., H.E. Butt Grocery 
Company, Conopco, Inc., Publix Super Markets, Inc., Supervalu, Inc., Giant Eagle, Inc., Kraft Foods Global, Inc., Kellogg 
Company General Mills, Inc., Nestle USA, Inc., Winn-Dixie, Inc., Roundy's Supermarkets, Inc., and H.J. Heinz Company. "
1749,2," The defendants argue, as a preliminary matter, that consideration of the applicability of the Capper-Volstead affirmative 
defenses is somehow premature. They contend that the question of who qualifies as a producer for purposes of the statutory 
agricultural cooperative exemptions is complex and unsettled and therefore not appropriate for summary judgment. Any 
determination as to the scope of these exemptions, they argue, depends upon a prerequisite finding that the defendants entered 
into an unlawful agreement to restrain trade. The Court disagrees that such a finding would be required before addressing the 
issue of the applicability of Capper-Volstead, an issue that has been well known since the inception of this [*7]  litigation. "
1752,3," In short, the exemption was intended for those with the greatest economic risk, the farmer who had the most skin in the game."
1752,4," The plaintiffs also argue that Michael Foods and Morak were both large, multi-faceted corporations which, despite producing 
some eggs, functioned primarily as processors and distributors of eggs and other products from third parties. They contend that 
Capper-Volstead does not protect such vertically integrated agribusiness. The plaintiffs' argument is based upon Justice 
Brennan's concurrence in National Broiler, as well as United States v. Hinote, 823 F. Supp. 1350 (S.D. Miss 1993) and In re 
fresh & Process Potatoes Antitrust Litig., 834 F. Supp. 2d 1141 (D. Idaho 2011). Applying the reasoning of Justice Brennan's 
concurrence, the Mississippi District Court in Hinote held that two vertically integrated catfish producers were not covered by 
Capper-Volstead. The court pointed out that, despite growing some catfish in their own ponds, the defendants purchased much 
of their production from third parties-in [*18]  effect acting in a manner indistinguishable from traditional distributors or 
middlemen. Id. at 1358. More recently, in In re Fresh & Process Potatoes Antitrust Litigation, the District of Idaho similarly 
adopted Justice Brennan's reasoning. The court held that, protecting a vertically integrated producer under Capper-Volstead 
""would read 'the farmer' requirement out of the statute, ignore congressional intent, and create the potential for abuse."" Id at 
1154. While the reasoning in these decisions may be compelling to some, the Court need not rule on the issue, given the finding 
that R.W. Sauder fails to meet the statutory definition of a producer."
1752,5," These challenged entities consist of: Active Feed Company, Hoyleston Feed Store, English River Pellets, Brown Brothers 
Produce and Pilgrim's Pride. "
1753,6," The plaintiffs contend that the defendants' affirmative defenses based upon Section 455 of the Cooperative Marketing Act and 
Section 2 of the Clayton Act should be denied for the same reasons as with regards to Section I of the Capper-Volstead Act. 
Notably, both Capper-Volstead and the Cooperative Marketing Act use similar language when describing the entities that may 
form protected associations. See 7 U.S.C.A. § 455 (West) (""Persons engaged, as original producers of agricultural products, 
such as farmers, planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers, . . .""). The defend ants do not attempt to invoke any 
separate arguments in support of their affirmative defense under Section 455, as opposed to the Capper-Volstead claims. 
Consequently, having found that UEP cannot be a Capper-Volstead [*21]  entity, the Court likewise grants the plaintiffs' motion 
as the defendants' affirmative defense under Section 455 with regards to UEP. "
1756,1," This same alleged conspiracy was the subject of our opinion in ZF Meritor, LLC v. Eaton Corp., 696 F.3d 254 (3d Cir. 2012), 
where we explained the relevant market in detail. As that background is elsewhere available, we provide here a more limited 
overview."
1756,2," ZF Meritor began as simply ""Meritor"" in 1989, not becoming ""ZF Meritor"" until a merger in 1999. "
1757,3," Specifically, Appellants brought a monopolization claim against Eaton [**6]  under § 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 2, and 
three claims against both Eaton and the OEMs: a conspiracy to monopolize claim, id., and two claims for entering exclusionary 
contracts, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 14. Importantly, Appellants may still be characterized as ""direct purchasers"" in relation to Eaton for 
purposes of this suit, even though the OEMs exist as middlemen between Eaton and Appellants. In 2010, Appellees filed 
motions to dismiss the case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) in part for lack of statutory standing, arguing that 
because the putative class representatives (then Wallach and Tauro) did not directly purchase trucks from Eaton, they lacked 
standing under the so-called ""direct purchaser rule."" See Ill. Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 97 S. Ct. 2061, 52 L. Ed. 2d 707 
(1977) (allowing antitrust suits for damages only by plaintiffs who directly purchased items from the alleged violator). The District 
Court rejected this argument, determining that Appellants had statutory standing to sue under the limited co-conspirator 
exception to the direct purchaser rule, which allows an entity to sue its supplier and its supplier's supplier if (1) it sues both at 
once, and (2) the immediate supplier (i.e., the middleman) was so wrapped up in the conspiracy that it would be barred from 
seeking antitrust relief against [**7]  the top-level supplier in a suit of its own. Wallach v. Eaton Corp., 814 F. Supp. 2d 428 
(D.N.J. 2011); see also Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 602 F.3d 237, 258-60 (3d Cir. 2010); Howard Hess 
Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int'l, Inc., 424 F.3d 363, 378-84 (3d Cir. 2005). Appellees do not challenge this ruling on appeal."
1757,4," Performance Transportation Services, Inc. (PTS), a direct customer of the OEMs and a former putative class [**8]  
representative in this case, is in bankruptcy and is represented by Mark Wallach as its Chapter 7 Trustee. While this case bears 
Wallach's name, PTS no longer seeks to represent the putative class and was dropped as a litigant in the case when the 
putative class redefined itself in briefing before the District Court."
1757,5," It is beyond dispute that a validly assigned antitrust claim can give direct purchaser standing to an indirect purchaser. See, e.g., 
In re Fine Paper Litig. State of Wash., 632 F.2d 1081, 1090 (3d Cir. 1980)."
1757,6," Toledo Mack and JJRS's motions to intervene were brought as ""of [r]ight,"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a), and, in the alternative, 
""[p]ermissive[ly],"" Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). "
1758,7," Appellants argue, in the alternative, that if consideration is required, R&R's assignment was supported by such consideration. 
Because we conclude consideration is not required, we do not reach this alternative argument and do not opine on the District 
Court's disposition of it."
1758,8," The District Court had jurisdiction over Appellants' antitrust claims pursuant to 15 U.S.C. §§ 4 and 15(a) and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 
and 1337. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 to review the District Court's conclusions."
1758,9," The standing inquiry in this case centers on the validity of R&R's assignment of its antitrust claim to Tauro. The District Court 
effectively entertained a 12(b)(1) motion on this question and treated it as a question of Article III standing. But because the 
assignment is relevant to whether Appellants satisfy the direct purchaser rule, its validity is a question of statutory standing, not 
Article III standing. Hartig Drug Co. v. Senju Pharm. Co., 836 F.3d 261, 2016 WL 4651381, at *5-6 (3d Cir. 2016). Unlike Article 
III standing, statutory standing is inherently non-jurisdictional, and—contrary to Appellants' assessment at oral argument, Oral 
Arg. Tr. 18—challenges to it should be brought by way of a 12(b)(6) motion, a summary judgment motion, or arguments on the 
merits—not by way of a 12(b)(1) motion. See 836 F.3d 261, id. at *4; see also Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, 
Inc., 134 S. Ct. 1377, 1387 n.4, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014). We also disagree with the parties' suggestion at oral argument that we can infer the District Court addressed the validity of the 
assignment as a matter of statutory standing, rather than Article [**11]  III standing. Oral Arg. Tr. 18, 36. Such an inference is not 
plausible. The District Court recited and employed the doctrinal standard applicable to questions of subject matter jurisdiction, 
foreclosing the possibility that it was treating the issue as a non-jurisdictional question of statutory standing. Wallach v. Eaton 
Corp., 125 F. Supp. 3d 487, 491-92 (D.N.J. 2015). Moreover, because Appellees brought a 12(b)(6) motion in 2011, see 
Wallach, 814 F. Supp. 2d at 432, they were prohibited under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(g)(2) from bringing their current 
challenge to Tauro's statutory standing as a 12(b)(6) motion in 2014, accord Leyse, 804 F.3d at 320-21. Despite the District 
Court's procedural error in entertaining Appellees' statutory standing challenge as a 12(b)(1) Article III challenge, however, 
Appellants failed to object in the District Court or in their briefs on appeal, and, at oral argument, asserted that the District Court 
acted properly, Oral Arg. Tr. 17-19. Accordingly, we deem any such challenge waived and address the statutory standing 
question on the merits."
1758,10," While we have said that denials of motions to intervene as of right and by permission under Rule 24 for untimeliness are both 
reviewed for abuse of discretion, Mountain Top Condo. Ass'n v. Dave Stabbert Master Builder, Inc., 72 F.3d 361, 369, 33 V.I. 
311 (3d Cir. 1995) (reciting standard for motions to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a)); Del. Valley Citizens' Council for Clean 
Air v. Commonwealth of Pa., 674 F.2d 970, 974 (3d Cir. 1982) (same for motions to intervene by permission [**12]  per Rule 
24(b)), we have also noted that our review of denials of motions to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a) generally ""is more 
stringent than the abuse of discretion review accorded to denials of motions for permissive intervention,"" meaning we will 
reverse if the district court ""has applied an improper legal standard or reached a decision that we are confident is incorrect."" 
Harris v. Pernsley, 820 F.2d 592, 597 (3d Cir. 1987) (quoting United States v. Hooker Chems. & Plastics Corp., 749 F.2d 968, 
992 (2d Cir. 1984)). We need not delve into how this heightened standard might affect the ""abuse of discretion"" relevant to the 
District Court's denial of the intervention motions here because we conclude the District Court abused its discretion even under "
1759,," the more forgiving standard generally applicable to Rule 24(b) motions. See Brody ex rel. Sugzdinis v. Spang, 957 F.2d 1108, 
1115 (3d Cir. 1992) (recognizing that rulings on Rule 24(b) motions are reviewed more deferentially)."
1759,11," We acknowledge that the term and concept of ""federal common law"" may strike some as anathema to federal court 
jurisprudence in the wake of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S. Ct. 817, 82 L. Ed. 1188 (1938), but in some 
areas of the law, marked by pressing interests of the United States or by broad congressional statutes empowering federal 
courts to make governing rules of law, so-called ""federal common law"" still exists to provide direction, e.g., Tex. Indus., Inc. v. 
Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 641-44, 101 S. Ct. 2061, 68 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1981). Federal antitrust law historically has 
been one such area. See, e.g., Nat'l Soc'y of Prof'l Eng'rs v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 688, 98 S. Ct. 1355, 55 L. Ed. 2d 637 
(1978). But cf. Tex. Indus., Inc., 451 U.S. at 641-45 (indicating that while federal common law applies to some components of 
antitrust law, it does not apply to remedial provisions that Congress described with particularity). Here, we put aside the 
doctrinal debates that could be had because we are bound by our precedent, which identifies federal common law as the 
governing principle for assessing the validity of an assignment of a federal antitrust claim. Gulfstream III Assocs. v. Gulfstream 
Aerospace Corp., 995 F.2d 425, 437 (3d Cir. 1993) (Greenberg, J., concurring and speaking for the majority). "
1760,12," Appellees' reliance on In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc., 997 F.2d 1039, 1055 (3d Cir. 1993), for the proposition that we hew 
closely to state law so as to protect litigants' ""commercial expectations"" reflects, [**19]  at best, a misreading of that case. The 
discussion Appellees cite was our recitation of the Supreme Court's test for ascertaining when to apply federal common law in 
the first instance, id. (citing United States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 727-728, 99 S. Ct. 1448, 59 L. Ed. 2d 711 
(1979)), not a test for how to fashion federal common law thereafter. Here, Gulfstream already dictates that we apply federal 
common law, rendering the considerations in Columbia Gas Systems inapposite. "
1761,13," Indeed, the very cases upon which Appellees rely to advance their fifty-state survey approach cut in favor of applying the 
Restatement. As Appellees note, in Smith Land & Improvement Corp. v. Celotex Corp., 851 F.2d 86, 92 (3d Cir. 1988), we 
observed that ""[t]he general doctrine of successor liability in operation in most states should guide the"" district court in defining 
the federal common law relevant to that case on remand. While we left it to the district court to make that determination in the 
first instance, we did discuss the general precepts of successor [**21]  liability and, in doing so, referenced only treatises on 
corporate law, id. at 91, close cousins of the Restatement. Moreover, while Appellees cite to a recent Fifth Circuit case in which 
the court described its application of the federal common law of contracts as adhering to ""the core principles of the common law 
of contracts that are in force in most states,"" Excel Willowbrook, L.L.C. v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, Nat'l Ass'n, 758 F.3d 592, 597 
(5th Cir. 2014) (quoting Smith v. United States, 328 F.3d 760, 767 (5th Cir. 2003)), the court went on to identify those very 
principles by citing directly to the Restatement of Contracts, id. at 597 n.8."
1761,14," Rather than consider the Restatement or the proper source of federal common law, the District [**22]  Court noted that In re 
Fine Paper Litigation itself cited to a district court case called Mercu-Ray Industries, Inc. v. Bristol-Myers Co., 392 F. Supp. 16, 
18 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 508 F.2d 837 (2d Cir. 1974), which posited that consideration may be relevant to the assignment of an 
antitrust claim; upon inspection, however, the district court in that case merely noted that issues such as the giving of 
consideration were not even challenged in that case. In other words, Mercu-Ray Industries sheds no light on the federal 
common law of contracts. "
1762,15," We also recognize that the Restatement may lose some of its persuasive force if it can be demonstrated that there has been a 
fundamental shift in the status of the law on a given topic in the years since the Second Restatement's publication in 1981. We 
have not detected any such tectonic shift in the law of assignments at issue in this case."
1762,16," Appellees' strained argument that ""gratuitous"" and ""without consideration"" are inherently different is foreclosed by the 
Restatement's description of a gratuitous assignment, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 332 (defining a gratuitous 
assignment as any assignment ""unless it is given or taken . . . in exchange for a performance or return promise that would be 
consideration for a promise""), and by the definition of ""gratuitous"" in Black's Law Dictionary, Black's Law Dictionary 143, 816 
(10th ed. 2009) (defining [**25]  ""gratuitous"" as ""given without consideration in circumstances that do not otherwise impose a 
duty"" and ""gratuitous assignment"" as ""[a]n assignment not given for value""). "
1764,17," The relevant portion of the written assignment at issue in this case reads: R&R hereby conveys, assigns and transfers to Tauro all rights, title and interest in and to all causes of action it may have 
against Defendants, under the antitrust laws of the United States or of any State, arising out of or relating to R&R's 
purchases . . . of vehicles containing Class 8 transmissions which were subsequently resold to Tauro. This assignment 
includes R&R's status as a direct purchaser of all vehicles containing Class 8 transmissions . . . . J.A. 137 (emphasis added)."
1764,18," Our jurisprudence requires a district court to consider four factors when ruling on a Rule 24(a)(2) motion: whether ""(1) the 
application for intervention is timely; (2) the applicant has a sufficient interest in the litigation; (3) the interest may be affected or 
impaired, as a practical matter by the disposition of the action; and (4) the interest is not adequately represented by an existing "
1765,," party in the litigation."" Harris, 820 F.2d at 596. Because Appellees did not dispute the latter three factors, the District Court 
disposed of both the intervenors' motions solely on the timeliness factor. Wallach, 125 F. Supp. 3d at 495. Timeliness is thus the 
only issue presented to us on appeal. Although it may be that Toledo Mack and JJRS opt to withdraw their motions to intervene 
in view of Tauro's standing to proceed as a class representative, should they choose to persist in their motions and dispute the 
remaining factors on remand, nothing in our opinion should be taken [**35]  to suggest that the District Court may not take these 
factors into account in ruling on the Rule 24 motions."
1765,19," While we review the District Court's denial of the motions to intervene for abuse of discretion, ""[w]hether an incorrect legal 
standard has been used is an issue of law to be reviewed de novo."" In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., 552 F.3d 305, 312 
(3d Cir. 2008) (quoting In re Initial Pub. Offering Sec. Litig., 471 F.3d 24, 32 (2d Cir. 2006)). Whether the presumption applies 
pre-certification is just such an issue. "
1766,20," The District Court grounded its distinction between a putative and a certified class on a 1975 Supreme Court case in which the 
Court noted that ""[w]hen [a] District Court certifie[s] the propriety of [a] class action, the class of unnamed persons described in 
the certification acquire[s] a legal status separate from the interest asserted by the appellant."" Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 399, 
95 S. Ct. 553, 42 L. Ed. 2d 532 (1975). The Court in Sosna, however, was addressing whether a class action challenging certain 
Iowa residency requirements for divorce was moot once the named plaintiff had satisfied the residency requirement over the 
course of the litigation. Its pronouncements in the context of mootness did not address the interests that give rise to the 
presumption of timeliness we recognized in In re Community Bank and do not suggest that the interests of putative class 
members [**39]  seeking to intervene are so different from those of members of a certified class as to justify altering the 
presumption's application. "
1767,21," For example, Appellants point out that discovery was ongoing in some respects, summary judgment had not yet been briefed, 
the parties were a year away from trial, and that they would not request additional discovery; at most, they argue, ""intervention 
would have required [Appellees] to produce documents and possibly sit for two depositions."" Appellants' Br. 26-27."
1767,22," Although a different sequence than that we provided in In re Community Bank, 418 F.3d at 314, we opt here to address the 
reason for delay factor before the prejudice factor because our conclusions as to the former inform the latter. "
1768,23," Appellants make two additional observations, upon which we need not rely. First, they urge that the interrogatories and 
depositions were not [**48]  public documents, meaning Toledo Mack and JJRS had no way of being put on notice regarding 
their contents (and the concomitant risk to the class action) and further supporting a later date as the proper benchmark. While 
lack of access to these documents would be a legitimate additional reason to reject the interrogatories and depositions as the 
relevant moment in time, we need not and do not rely on this fact, which was not made plain in the record. Second, for the first 
time in their reply brief on appeal, Appellants assert that Toledo Mack and JJRS did not retain class counsel until after Appellees 
filed their response to Appellants' motion for class certification in late January 2015 (which included Appellees' challenge to 
Tauro's standing), implying that the proposed intervenors were ignorant of any risk to the litigation until that time. Appellees retort 
that Toledo Mack and JJRS fail to explain whether they had previous contact with Tauro's counsel before retaining him for the 
intervention motions that would have put them on notice of the risk to Tauro's standing and that counsel's knowledge of the 
potential risks to Tauro's standing should be imputed to Toledo Mack and JJRS [**49]  in any event. We decline to consider 
these arguments, as they are not based on facts in the record. "
1771,1," For purposes of this order, the Court assumes that [*3]  all well-pled allegations in Plaintiff's proposed First Amended 
Complaint [64-1] are true. This order cites to the redline of the First Amended Complaint, which Yankee attached to its motion to 
dismiss, see [72-1], because the redline makes it easier to identify which allegations VBR has added to the original complaint. "
1787,1," This request appears in Plaintiff's replies, which were filed in support of its Motion for injunctive relief."
1787,2," Plaintiff's allegation in its pleadings that ""Trademark advertises and markets itself using photographs of a house that JP Homes 
designed"" appears to refer to a house, other than the one being built by Trademark for the McWhorters, that was built using 
architectural plans different from The Martinique. "
1788,3," In its Motion, Plaintiff requests injunctive relief that ""includes an order that Defendants, and all those acting in concert with 
them, cease using all infringing plans and drawings, and an order enjoining the continued construction of the infringing house."" 
Pl.'s Mot. 2. Plaintiff further requests ""entry of a preliminary injunction that enjoins Defendants, and all those acting in concert 
with them, from acts of infringement and contributory infringement, including but not limited to (1) using [*7]  all infringing plans 
and drawings, (2) constructing or continuing to construct infringing structures, including the house under construction for the 
McWhorters."" Id."
1788,4," Plaintiff's Exhibit D also includes a June 13, 2016 letter from Plaintiff's counsel to the Copyright Office, which includes a 
""Request for recordation of Copyright Assignment,"" Pl.'s Mot. App. 19, as well as a Copyright Office Receipt acknowledging 
receipt of ""2 DCS"" forms, a cover letter from Plaintiff's counsel, and payment [*8]  with respect to ""The Mitchell"" on June 14, 
2016; however, the relevance in this case of any copyright by JP Homes for ""The Mitchell"" is unclear. See id. at 20. "
1792,5," Plaintiff's passing reference to ""unfair competition"" only appears on the first and ninth pages of its Complaint. The Lanham Act 
includes a statement of its purposes, which includes ""protect[ing] persons engaged in [commerce within the control of Congress] 
against unfair competition,"" 15 U.S.C. § 1127. According to Lexmark, the concept of ""unfair competition"" was understood to 
concern ""injuries to business reputation and present and future sales."" Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 134 S. Ct. at 1389-90. From this, the 
court concluded that in a suit for false advertising under § 1125(a), ""a plaintiff [*19]  must allege an injury to a commercial 
interest in reputation or sales."" Id."
1792,6," Trademark did not file a reply in support of its motion to dismiss to address whether Lexmark's standing analysis applies to 
Plaintiff's false advertising and unfair competition claim under the Lanham Act. Based on the reasoning in Lexmark regarding 
""unfair competition,"" Plaintiff's response to the motion to dismiss, and the manner in which Plaintiff pleaded its Lanham Act 
claim, the court concludes that Plaintiff's claim is one for relief under § 1125(a), even though Plaintiff refers to it as one for false 
advertising and unfair competition. The court makes this clarification because the Court in Lexmark made clear that it was only 
deciding ""the appropriate analytical framework for determining a party's standing to maintain an action for false advertising under 
[ § 1125(a) of] the Lanham Act,"" not the framework for determining standing for the parties' other claims under federal copyright, 
patent, and antitrust law, or North Carolina's unfair-competition law. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 134 S. Ct. at 1385 and n.2. "
1793,7," Although Trademark's motion does not address the zones of interest test for standing under the Lanham Act, the court 
determines that Plaintiff's alleged injury—HN12[
] loss of customers and damage to its business reputation—are [*23]  the type of injuries to commercial interests that the Lanham Act protects. See Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 134 S. Ct. at 1393. JP Homes is suing 
as a business engaged in commerce that is within the control of Congress and whose position in the marketplace has been 
allegedly damaged by Trademark's and Johnson's false advertising. See id. (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1127). Accordingly, Plaintiff's 
Lanham Act claim falls within the zone of interests protected by the statute. Id. "
1795,8," Trademark's and Johnson's motion to dismiss references 17 U.S.C. § 412, which provides as follows regarding 
registration [*31]  of a copyright: In any action under this title, other than an action brought for a violation of the rights of the author under section 106A(a), an 
action for infringement of the copyright of a work that has been preregistered under section 408(f) before the 
commencement of the infringement and that has an effective date of registration not later than the earlier of 3 months after 
the first publication of the work or 1 month after the copyright owner has learned of the infringement, or an action instituted 
under section 411(c), no award of statutory damages or of attorney's fees, as provided by sections 504 and 505, shall be 
made for— (1) any infringement of copyright in an unpublished work commenced before the effective date of its registration; or (2) any infringement of copyright commenced after first publication of the work and before the effective date of its 
registration, unless such registration is made within three months after the first publication of the work."
1795,17," U.S.C. § 412. HN15[
] Even if a plaintiff is precluded under this section from recovering statutory damages or attorney's 
fees for the defendant's infringement, it may still be entitled to an award of actual damages, the defendant's profits, and 
injunctive relief. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 502, 504. Thus, failure to comply with [*32]  section 412's registration requirement is not 
necessarily fatal to a claim for copyright infringement."
1795,9," JP Homes has pleaded that it submitted its application, fee, and deposit for ""The Martinique"" on February 2, 2016. See Pl.'s 
Compl. P 9. The issue raised by Trademark and Johnson concerns the timing of Plaintiff's registration for ""The Martinique"" in 
light of their contention that they received the plans from the McWhorters on October 13, 2015, a fact which is outside of the 
pleadings and cannot be considered by the court in ruling on the motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). "
1798,10," For support, Plaintiff relies on the following cases: Value Grp., Inc. v. Mendham Lake Estates, L.P., 800 F. Supp. 1228, 1234 
(D. N. J. 1992); Worlds of Wonder v. Veritel Learning Sys., Inc., 658 F. Supp. 351, 356 (N.D. Tex. 1986) (citing Apple Computer, 
Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240, 1254 (3d Cir. 1983)); and Entertainment & Sports Programming Network, Inc. v. 
Edinburg Cmty. Hotel, Inc., 623 F. Supp. 647, 656 (S.D. Tex. 1985). The Entertainment & Sports Programming Network opinion 
cited by Plaintiff was subsequently amended and superseded by Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, Inc. v. 
Edinburg Community Hotel, Inc., 623 F. Supp. 647 (S.D. Tex. 1985), which also concluded that irreparable harm is presumed 
when a copyright is infringed. "
1799,11," Plaintiff actually cited page 1324 of the New Jersey district court's opinion in Value Group to support its irreparable harm 
argument; however, this appears to be a typographical error, as there is no page 1324 in this opinion, and the court's analysis 
regarding irreparable harm in that case starts on page 1233."
1799,12," See Chacon v. Granata, 515 F.2d 922, 925 (5th Cir. 1975) (concluding that irreparable harm requires a showing that: (1) the 
harm to Plaintiff is imminent (2) [*42]  the injury would be irreparable and (3) that Plaintiff has no other adequate legal remedy)."
1799,13," As previously noted, JP Homes filed separate replies and reply briefs to the separate responses filed by (1) Trademark and 
Johnson, and (2) the McWhorters. Both reply briefs are substantially the same with respect to [*43]  Plaintiff's irreparable harm 
analysis. Accordingly, to avoid duplication, the court's citations to Plaintiff's reply brief herein will be to Plaintiff's reply brief to the 
McWhorters' response to Plaintiff's Motion for injunctive relief (Doc. 29), unless otherwise specified. Plaintiff also filed two 
separate appendices in support of its replies. The two appendices are the same, except that the appendix filed with respect to 
the McWhorters' response contains Vastano's supplemental declaration and exhibits, in addition to the declarations for Owens 
and Michelle Vastano. The court's citations to Plaintiff's reply appendix will likewise be to the appendix responsive to the 
McWhorters' response to Plaintiff's Motion (Doc. 30)."
1799,14," Plaintiff cited one additional case in its reply, Haas Outdoors, Incorporated v. Oak Country Camo., Incorporated, 957 F. Supp. 
835, 838 (N.D. Miss. 1997); however, the finding of irreparable harm in this case was based on the presumption already rejected 
by this court."
1799,15," The McWhorters contend that the claims and issues in this case involve ""heavily disputed factual contentions"" that will [*45]  
require ""detailed discovery, depositions, [and] expert witnesses."" McWhorters' Mot. to Strike 1-2. The McWhorters assert that 
they are entitled to develop fully their defenses, positions, and theories of law in advance of the trial of this cause. JP Homes 
responds that it is not opposed to the McWhorters' request to file a surreply but opposes the Motion to Strike. JP Homes also 
opposes the McWhorters' request to conduct discovery before filing their surreply because they have not indicated what 
additional discovery is needed to respond to JP Homes's Motion for injunctive relief, and any evidence they seek to support their 
affirmative defenses in response to JP Homes's Motion should be within their possession, custody, or control. Additionally, JP 
Homes contends that the liability portion of its claims on the merits is fairly straightforward and can be resolved without the need 
for discovery. JP Homes further contends that the McWhorters could have raised any concerns by conference after receiving it 
reply brief and appendix, rather than waiting eight days and then filing a motion to strike, and waiting thirteen days to confer. To 
avoid further delay, JP Homes requests that the court [*46]  require the McWhorters to file any surreply within three days of the 
filing of its August 9, 2016 response to the Motion to Strike. "
1801,16," According to Plaintiffs' reply brief, the McWhorters' house is 35% or 40% complete. "
1802,17," The court's decision not to address the remaining factors is not a comment on the strength or weaknesses of the parties' 
contentions. "
