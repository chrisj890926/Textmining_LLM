Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., USA, the latter incorrectly identified as Glenmark Generics Inc., USA. "

] Indeed, because the market power inquiry is merely a surrogate, the Supreme Court has explained that ""'proof of actual detrimental effects, such as a reduction of output,' can obviate the need for an inquiry into market power . . . ."" Ind. Fed'n 
of Dentists, 476 U.S. at 460-61 (quoting 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law ¶ 1511, p. 429 (1986)). A ""finding of actual, sustained 
adverse effects on competition"" may be ""legally sufficient to support a finding that the challenged restraint was unreasonable 
even in the absence of elaborate market analysis."" Id. at 461. However, the Motion for Summary Judgment addresses the 
definition of the relevant market, not whether direct proof of actual detrimental effects has obviated the need for Plaintiffs to 
define the relevant market. See ECF No. 1078 at 1 (noting that Plaintiffs seek summary judgment on ""the indirect side"" of the 
market power issue). "
49,5," In this Memorandum Order, reference to ""non-ezetimibe drugs"" includes all drugs other than Zetia and its AB-rated generic 
equivalents."
49,6," Throughout this discussion, the court describes each objection and aspect of the record referenced by either Defendant as 
""Defendants'"" objection or evidence. Dissecting which Defendant objected to or referenced a particular aspect of the record is 
unnecessary, as sustaining any single outcome-determinative objection will inure to the benefit of both Defendants. "
50,7, See supra Part IV.A. 
51,8, See infra Part IV.B.3.
51,9," Defendants take issue with this characterization. See ECF No. 1419 at 26; ECF No. 1423 at 30. The court reads the R&R's 
description of ""ordinary competition"" to simply refer to profit-maximizing activity that does not demonstrate constraints imposed 
by non-ezetimibe drug pricing. A showing of cross-price elasticity with non-ezetimibe drugs would have sufficed to defeat the 
Motion for Summary Judgment whether or not one categorized the supporting evidence as demonstrating ""ordinary competition,"" 
in the colloquial sense. Defendants did not make this showing. "
63,1," Nearly four weeks after Plaintiffs filed their reply brief in support of their Antitrust Motion, Defendants filed an evidentiary 
objection (which seeks to admit a supplemental declaration from Defendants' expert) and a request for leave to file a surreply, 
both in response to what they characterize as improper new evidence and arguments in Plaintiffs' reply brief. Dkt. Nos. 533, 534. 
Defendants did not confer with Plaintiffs before filing these documents, at least one of which is properly construed as a motion 
subject to Local Rule 7-3. HN1[
] ""Filing of surreplies is highly disfavored, as it typically constitutes a party's improper attempt 
to have the last word on an issue."" Smith v. United States, No. 2:13-CV-039-JAD-GWF, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42142, 2014 WL 
1301357, at *5 (D. Nev. Mar. 28, 2014). The arguments and evidence in Plaintiffs' reply to which Defendants object were directly 
responsive to Defendants' arguments, and therefore neither improper nor a basis for allowing leave to file a surreply. See 
Applied Materials, Inc. v. Demaray LLC, No. 5:20-CV-05676-EJD, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 236758, 2020 WL 8515132, at *1 (N.D. 
Cal. Dec. 16, 2020) HN2[
] (""[E]vidence submitted with a reply brief is not new evidence when it is submitted to rebut 
arguments raised in the opposition brief.""). Accordingly, Defendants' objection and motion for leave are DENIED."
63,2," Because Stevens fully participated in the briefing on the class certification motions before settling and is discussed extensively 
in the parties' analysis, references in this Order to Defendants include Stevens, except that any merits ruling on the arguments 
raised by Defendants does not apply to Stevens. Plaintiffs also alleged claims against five other trucking companies that settled 
before Plaintiffs moved for class certification: Western Express, Inc., Schneider National Carriers, Inc., Southern Refrigerated 
Transport, Inc., Covenant Transport, Inc., and Paschall Truck Lines, Inc. (collectively, the Settling Defendants). "
70,3," Defendants briefly dispute commonality and typicality as part of their argument that the existence of arbitration agreements 
precludes certification under Rule 23(b)(3) because common issues do not predominate. Dkt. No. 502 at 8. That argument will 
be addressed in connection with typicality and with the requirements of Rule 23(b). "
72,4," Plaintiffs have filed a motion for preliminary approval of their class action settlements with the Settling Defendants. Dkt. No. 
537. In assessing that motion, the Court addresses whether Plaintiffs adequately represent the interests of the class members in 
the broader settlement class. However, that is a separate inquiry from whether they adequately protect the interests of the 
Antitrust Class and the California Antitrust Subclass. "
74,5," The parties agree that California's Cartwright Act tracks federal law and that Plaintiffs' claims under both the Sherman Act and 
the Cartright Act are based on the same allegedly anticompetitive behavior and seek the same relief. Dkt. No. 485-1 at 13 n.3; 
Dkt. No. 502 at 7. The parties therefore have not addressed the claims separately, and neither will the Court. "
77,6," The Court therefore need not determine whether a class action would be superior to other available methods for fairly and 
efficiently adjudicating the controversy under Rule 23(b)(3), nor whether to appoint class counsel under Rule 23(g). "
78,1, The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. § 1337. 
79,2," Citations to the docket are indicated by ""R."" followed by the docket number or filing name, and where necessary, a page or 
paragraph citation."
79,3," The KSA Defendants and Acuity filed separate motions to dismiss, but raise some overlapping arguments in support of 
dismissal. Acuity Mot. Dismiss; KSA Mot. Dismiss. To the extent Defendants raise similar arguments, the Court addresses those 
arguments—and Force Partners' responses—together. If only one motion to dismiss raises a certain argument, the Court so 
notes in the Opinion. The Court notes that a significant portion of Acuity's motion to dismiss and reply briefs is contained in footnotes. Arguments in 
footnotes are typically waived. See Sanders v. JGWPT Holdings, Inc., 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97722, 2016 WL 4009941, at *10 
(N.D. Ill. July 26, 2016). Moreover, the Court's Standing Order, under ""Memorandum of Law Requirements,"" states that 
""[g]enerally, the Court will not consider substantive arguments contained in footnotes."" However, Acuity filed its briefs before this 
case was reassigned to this Court, so the Court will consider the arguments raised in footnotes in Acuity's briefs. And yes, the 
Court recognizes the irony of including this admonishment in a footnote, but given that it is merely a reminder to the parties for 
future briefs filed before this Court, and is unrelated to the substance of the Opinion, the Court finds it appropriate to note in this 
manner."
79,4," The Court accepts as true all of the well-pleaded facts in the FAC and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of Force 
Partners. Platt v. Brown, 872 F.3d 848, 851 (7th Cir. 2017). "
81,5, Force Partners mislabeled Count VII as Count VI. 
83,6," The third test courts sometimes apply is the ""quick look"" analysis. As the Seventh Circuit has explained, ""the quick-look 
approach can be used when 'an observer with even a rudimentary understanding of economics could conclude that the 
arrangements in question would have an anticompetitive effect on customers and markets,' but there are nonetheless reasons to 
examine the potential procompetitive justifications."" Agnew v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 683 F.3d 328, 336 (7th Cir. 2012). 
Under the quick-look analysis, if the defendant lacks legitimate justification for facially anticompetitive behavior, then the court 
condemns the practice without ado without resort to analysis of market power. Id. Force Partners does not argue that the Court 
apply the quick-look analysis here, so the Court does not address it substantively. See FAC. "
85,7," Although the Court would usually decline to consider an argument or case asserted for the first time in a reply, see Narducci v. 
Moore, 572 F.3d 313, 323 (7th Cir. 2009), the Court touches on it briefly because Force Partners argued in its Response that 
Jim and Ashley are individually liable because they conspired with Acuity, based on their relationship with Acuity's then-CEO. 
Resp. at 17 (citing FAC ¶ 74). "
86,8," The KSA Defendants do not argue that the FAC fails to allege that an agreement existed between Defendants; rather, they 
contend that the purpose of any such agreement was not unlawful. KSA Memo. Dismiss at 9-10. Nonetheless, Force Partners is 
correct that an agreement need not be explicit to support a Section 1 claim. Pl. KSA Resp. at 18 (citing, among other cases, 
Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764, 104 S. Ct. 1464, 79 L. Ed. 2d 775 (1984)). "
87,9," Acuity's arguments about the validity of the alleged agreement all relate to its exclusivity, which the Court addresses below, see 
supra Section II, as such arguments more properly align with Force Partners' Sherman Act Section 2 claim."
87,10," As Force Partners notes in response to Acuity's motion to dismiss, Acuity did not dispute that the market at issue plausibly 
was alleged, nor did it challenge the claims of market dominance and market power. Pl. Acuity Resp. at 4 n.1. A party waives an 
argument when it raises it for the first time on reply. See Narducci, 572 F.3d at 323. However, because the KSA Defendants 
raised these arguments in their opening motion to dismiss, the Court substantively addresses them. "
88,11," The KSA Defendants' motion to dismiss raises this argument in just one sentence, expanding upon the argument in reply. KSA 
Reply at 6-7. "
99,1," Unless otherwise noted, the facts are taken from the Amended Complaint, and are accepted as true for the purposes of this

the person's absence may: (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent 
obligations because of the interest. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19 "

131,4," Micron's CEO's statements were made in response to an investor analyst who asked, ""Pricing is going to continue to be weak 
until Micron and the DRAM industry overall cuts production. So . . . what will it take for that to happen?"""
131,5," For example, Plaintiffs allege that on October 27, 2016, Samsung executive Sewon Chun stated on a quarterly earnings call: 
""[W]e are expecting our growth rates to come down and be in line with market bit growth in DRAM next year. . . . Once again, as 
we have always mentioned, regarding DRAM, our focus is not to increase our market share but to maximize our profits."" "

28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir. 1994) (""We review only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly in a party's opening brief.""). 
Nevertheless, Plaintiffs' [**27]  claims brought under California's Cartwright Act, Unfair Competition Law, and the antitrust laws 
of five other states are all premised upon the existence of an antitrust conspiracy, and therefore rise and fall with the Sherman 
Act claim. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs' remaining claims for failure to plead an antitrust conspiracy. "
141,1, This matter can be decided on the memoranda submitted. Defendants' requests for oral argument are DENIED. 
144,2," PBTM also alleges that the Seahawks breached the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing by proposing an unreasonable 
settlement agreement as a condition of allowing PBTM to use its trademarks and by filing oppositions at the USPTO's 
Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (""TTAB""). Dkt. #47 at ¶ 78. There are no contractual provisions regarding these activities, 
however, and PBTM has apparently abandoned these aspects of the implied duty claim. "
147,3," In particular, PBTM alleges that defendant NFL Properties ""controls the licensing of NFL team trademarks,"" including those 
held by the Seahawks, and that the Seahawks and NFL Properties have conspired ""to restrain trade unlawfully and 
unreasonably"" ""in the market for distribution and manufacture of merchandise carrying trademarks for the teams of the National 
Football League (collectively ""Products"") within the Pacific Northwest (Washington and Oregon)."" Dkt. #47 at ¶¶ 52-53. "
148,4," PBTM argues that Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g) precludes defendants from challenging the adequacy of its antitrust injury allegations 
because they failed to raise the issue in their previous motion to dismiss. Dkt. #51 at 20-21. See ISE Ent. Corp. v. Longarzo, No. 
CV 17-9132-MWF (JCX), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228532, 2018 WL 5298692, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Apr. 16, 2018); 5D C. Wright & A. 
Miller Federal Practice & Procedure § 1385, Application of Rule 12(g) - In General (3d ed. 2017) (Rule 12(g) ""generally 
precludes"" a Rule 12 objection that could have been raised but was not). The Fourth Amended Complaint redefines the relevant 
market, however, materially changing the evaluation of consumer harm and anticompetitive effect. The motion to dismiss the 
new pleading was the first opportunity to challenge the adequacy of these allegations. Regardless, defendants raised the lack of 
consumer harm in their previous motion to dismiss. See Dkt. #30 at 25-26 (arguing that PBTM's allegations of consumer harm 
were ""cursory"" and failed to state a plausible claim that the licensing agreement injured competition). Rule 12(g) does not bar 
defendants' challenge to the allegations of consumer harm."
148,5," Under that analytical framework, a claim of anticompetitive effects will shift the burden to the defendant to show empirical 
evidence of procompetitive or neutral effects only where the Court has the information necessary to ""properly identif[y] the 
theoretical basis for the anticompetitive effects and [can] consider[] whether the effects actually are anticompetitive. Where, as 
here, the circumstances of the restriction are somewhat complex, assumption alone will not do."" Cal. Dental Ass'n, 526 U.S. at 
775 (1999). "
150,6," The December 2016 letter from NFLP's counsel stated, ""We firmly believe that any use of these marks without the permission 
of the Seahawks Club would violate the Legion of Boom Agreement, in addition to constituting infringement of the Seahawks 
Marks . . . ."" Id. at ¶ 14 (emphasis added). In response to PBTM's request for permission to use a ""12"" trademark on a 
Seahawks-related product, counsel for the Seahawks advised PBTM: ""[W]e contend that the application, registration and use of 
the PBTM trademarks on certain products and in certain promotional materials infringe our intellectual property rights . . . Please 
be advised that we cannot and will not consider approving these types of requests until our outstanding issues are resolved."" Id. 
(emphasis added). In a follow-up letter dated August 31, 2016, counsel stated: [Y]our assertion in the August 11th Letter that PBTM LLC or its affiliates intend to design, produce, advertise, distribute 
and/or sell products featuring a 12 would obviously be in violation of Paragraph 22 of the Legion of Boom Agreement and 
demonstrates PBTM's bad faith intent to violate the Seahawks intellectual property rights and/or misappropriate the 
goodwill inherent in the 12 Marks. Accordingly, be advised that Football Northwest will take all steps necessary to protect its 
contractual rights and its valuable intellectual property rights. Id. (emphasis added). "
151,7," Interspersed in defendants' case and controversy argument is the suggestion that the Court should abstain from hearing the 
dispute in favor of the administrative process before the USPTO. Dkt. #48 at 22; Dkt. # 49 at 13. The few cases cited are not 
persuasive in this context: if a stay pending resolution of the administrative proceedings is appropriate, defendants may raise 
that issue in a separate motion. "
162,1," UHS filed its complaint on October 19, 2021. "
165,2," HN6[

goods or services"" and ""consumer transaction as ""any transaction involving trade or commerce to a natural person, the subject 
of which transaction is primarily intended for personal, family, or household use""). "
168,3," The Court notes that, in their reply brief, Defendants raised a new argument that was not presented in their opening briefs 
(even though it could have been). See Teva Reply at 4-5 (arguing, in effect, that UHS failed to clearly allege that it purchased 
drugs). Because it was not raised until reply, the Court does not address it. "
176,1," The Court notes that the original proposal included the law firm of Labaton Sucharow LLP. All attorneys included in the 
proposal who were employed with Labaton Sucharow LLP have since joined the firm DiCello Levitt Gutzler. The attorneys 
involved in the proposal have represented that the DiCello firm fully supports the effort of being named interim class counsel in 
the instant action. Therefore, the Court does not believe the change in employment of certain attorneys will have any impact on 
their ability to represent the class. To avoid confusion, the Court will refer to the proposed arrangement as the ""DiCello/Quinn 
Proposal."" "
177,2," While the DiCello/Quinn Proposal contemplates the firms working together as interim class counsel, it is worth noting that 
Quinn conducted its own independent investigation, interviewing more than twenty witnesses and culminating in the filing of a 
complaint on behalf of its own client. See ECF No. 151 at 7, 14; see Wilson et al. v. Raytheon Tech. Corp. et. al., 3:22-cv-00062,

an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification may be granted a 180-day period of generic marketing exclusivity, during which time 
the FDA will not approve a later-filed ANDA based on the same NDA. See 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(B)(iv); see also Janssen 
Pharm., N.V. v. Apotex, Inc., 540 F.3d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2008)."
182,7," Hence, any reference in this Opinion to ""Teva's"" product is a reference to Watson's product as approved by the FDA. "
183,8," On February 21, 2019, UFCW Local 1500 Welfare Fund filed a class action antitrust complaint in this District on behalf of 
entities that indirectly purchased or provided reimbursement for the purchase of cinacalcet. (See C.A. No. 19-369 D.I. 1) On 
February 26, 2019, Cesar Castillo, Inc, filed a class action antitrust complaint in this District on behalf of direct purchasers of 
cinacalcet. (See C.A. No. 19-396 D.I. 1) On March 14, 2019, Teamsters Local 237 Welfare Fund and Teamsters Local 237 
Retirees' Benefit Fund filed an indirect-purchaser class action in the District of New Jersey. (See C.A. No. 19-1461 D.I. 1) On 
April 9, 2019, KPH Healthcare Services, Inc. filed a direct-purchaser class action complaint in the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania. (See C.A. No. 19-1460 D.I. 1) "
184,9," The EPPs filed their amended consolidated class action complaints on February 16, 2021. (D.I. 196) The parties then 
stipulated to allow the EPPs to file the second amended consolidated class action complaint to include another end-payor 
plaintiff, Teamsters Western Region & Local 177 Health Care Fund (""TWR""). (See D.I. 199) To avoid confusion, the Court will 
refer to the Plaintiffs' second amended consolidated class action complaints (D.I. 195, 202) as their ""amended consolidated 
class action complaints."" "
186,10," Also consistent with its previous decision, the Court finds that the reverse payment included (1) the release of Amgen's 
infringement claim for damages against Teva, thus allowing Teva to retain most of the revenues from its at-risk sales, and (2) the 
acceleration clause provided to Teva in the Amgen-Teva Agreement. Plaintiffs' allegation that the payment included ""an agreed 
entry date that provides Teva with exclusive market entry before other generic entrants"" is implausible, as the operative 
complaints allege that at least seven other generic manufacturers obtained the same entry date as Teva, leaving Teva with no 
""exclusive market entry."" (See D.I. 195 ¶¶ 139-46; D.I. 202 ¶¶ 135-42) "
187,11," Defendants' reliance on In re Lipitor Antitrust Litig., 868 F.3d 231 (3d Cir. 2017), is misplaced. (See D.I. 212 at 9) In Lipitor, the 
release of an infringement claim that had a ""high likelihood of success"" was found to support the allegation of a reverse 
payment. See 868 F.3d at 253. Lipitor did not, however, hold that the release of an infringement claim that was purportedly 
""weak"" could not also constitute a reverse payment (particularly in combination with other value given from the patentee to the 
alleged infringer)."
187,12," The value to Teva of the acceleration clause in the Amgen-Teva Agreement is that it allows Teva to re-enter the generic 
cinacalcet market ahead of their agreed-upon entry date, if another generic launches. Combined with the revenues and profits 
Teva was permitted to retain, the Court concludes — under the required ""holistic analysis"" (D.I. 177 at 11) — that Plaintiffs have 
sufficiently alleged a plausible ""large and unjustified"" payment from Amgen to Teva. The Court need not decide whether the 
acceleration clause on its own would satisfy the pleading standard. (See D.I. 212 at 11 n.7) Further, as the Court has previously 
concluded (and now adheres to), Plaintiffs' theory that the acceleration clause deterred other generics is not plausible. (See D.I. 
177 at 15-16) "
188,13," Of course, Teva's cessation of sales of its generic cinacalcet product (i.e., exiting the market) also had significant value to 
Amgen. In evaluating the consideration flowing to Amgen, however, this value is not included in ""B"" because it is (allegedly, and 
plausibly so) the prohibited ""delay"" in Plaintiffs' ""reverse payment for delay"" claim. That is, in assessing whether the amounts 
Amgen paid to Teva to ""delay"" Teva's entry (or delay Teva's ""permanent entry"" or ""re-entry"") into the market are ""large and 
unjustified,"" it does not matter what that delay was worth to Amgen."
188,14," While Defendants are correct (see, e.g., D.I. 212 at 13) that Lipitor, 868 F.3d at 253, involved a brand company delaying the 
generic entry of one drug by releasing infringement claims covering a different drug, there is no suggestion in Lipitor that settling 
patent infringement claims for the same drug would be immune from antitrust scrutiny. "
189,15," Defendants' references to a California statute and an FTC decision (see D.I. 212 at 14), while helpful to the Court's analysis, 
are not dispositive here, for reasons including that they are not binding authority. "
190,16," The case relied on by Plaintiffs, LePage's, Inc. v. 3M, 324 F.3d 141 (3d Cir. 2003), is inapposite. (See D.I. 222 at 27-28) 
LePage's does not concern a market allocation theory and does not involve market competition that had been restrained by 
existing contracts before the alleged antitrust conduct at issue took place. See also generally King Drug Co. of Florence, Inc. v. 
Smithkline Beecham Corp., 791 F.3d 388, 408-09 (3d Cir. 2015) (""Actavis does not stand for the proposition that parties must 
reach the most procompetitive settlements possible."")."
190,17," Given Plaintiffs' concession, the positions Amgen took during the Cipla action are not relevant to the Court's analysis. In any 
event, it appears that Amgen's advocacy of its interpretation of the Amgen-Cipla Agreement is subject to the Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine; the anticompetitive effects deriving from good-faith legal advocacy are not subject to antitrust liability. See Prof'l Real 
Estate Iny'rs v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 60, 113 S. Ct. 1920, 123 L. Ed. 2d 611 (1993) (""If an objective 
litigant could conclude that the suit is reasonably calculated to elicit a favorable outcome, the suit is immunized under Noerr, and "
191,," an antitrust claim premised on the sham exception must fail,""). Plaintiffs do not allege that the legal arguments Amgen made 
about the interpretation of the Amgen-Cipla Agreement were made in bad faith or were objectively unreasonable."
191,18," In addition, contrary to Plaintiffs' argument that ""if there is an absence of saying with prejudice, then it would be without 
prejudice"" (Tr. at 41), a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) that is silent as to prejudice is presumed to be with prejudice. See In re 
PHP Healthcare Corp., 128 F. App'x 839, 842 (3d Cir. 2005) (""[I]n the absence of a clear statement to the contrary, a dismissal 
pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) should be presumed to be made with prejudice.""). "
192,19," In their brief, Plaintiffs contend that the continued litigation and the subsequent at-risk launches by multiple generic 
manufacturers ""are factually irrelevant and cannot defeat the plaintiffs' monopolization claims."" (D.I. 222 at 21) However, during 
oral argument, Plaintiffs conceded that ""they are relevant."" (Tr. at 71-72) (""If we said something how they're irrelevant, then 
somebody got excited when typing something . . ."") The Court finds relevance in these real-world events. "
194,20," The situation in this case is readily distinguishable from that in the case cited by Teva. (See D.I. 214 at 17; see also Tr. at 34-
35) In Cottrell v. Alcon Labs., 874 F.3d 154, 168 (3d Cir. 2017), the Third Circuit reversed a district court decision but added it 
""might be inclined to agree with the District Court that the pricing theory was too speculative if it, in fact, had depended on these 
[drug pricing] presumptions."" In the district court litigation, the plaintiffs based their injury theory, in part, on the presumption that 
""Defendants would have reduced the price of a bottle of medication in accordance with the reduction in volume."" Id. The district 
court had rejected this premise, because it had ""no way of knowing whether Defendants would price their products [based on 
volume], particularly since the pricing of pharmaceuticals is complex."" Id. Here, by contrast, it is far less speculative to infer — on 
the bases of Teva's past sales and its bargaining for future sales — that Teva would have continued producing and selling its 
generic cinacalcet product in the absence of the Amgen-Teva Agreement."
194,21," Teva's reliance on Marian Bank v. Electronic Payment Servs., Inc., 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11560, 1997 WL 367332 at *4 (D. 
Del. Feb. 5, 1997), is misplaced. (See D.I. 214 at 18) There the court dismissed the plaintiff's claim as to one defendant because 
that defendant's participation in the conspiracy post-dated the period relevant to the plaintiff's claim. "
195,22," According to Defendants, the only state law claims that are not subject to the motion to dismiss are: the Florida consumer 
protection claim; the California consumer protection claim and antitrust claims as to concerted conduct; New York and 
Tennessee antitrust claims as to concerted conduct; and the Arizona, Maryland, and Oregon claims. (See D.I. 210 at 3 n.1)"
195,23," The 15 states are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah."
195,24," The issue of Article III standing in class action lawsuits presents an unsettled question on which courts, including in the Third 
Circuit, are split. See, e.g., In re Valsartan, Losartan, & Irbesartan Prods. Liab. Litig., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5908, 2021 WL 
100204, at *14 (D.N.J. Jan. 12, 2021) (finding no standing in states where named plaintiffs ""do not reside and were not injured""); 
Ponzio v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, 447 F. Supp. 3d 194, 223 (D.N.J. 2020) (""Plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims on behalf 
of unnamed plaintiffs in jurisdictions where Plaintiffs have suffered no alleged injury.""); In re Niaspan Antitrust Litig., 42 F. Supp. 
3d 735, 758 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (""[N]amed plaintiffs lack standing to assert claims under the laws of the states in which they do not 
reside or in which they suffered no injury.""); but see, e.g., In re Generic Pharms. Pricing Antitrust Litig., 368 F. Supp. 3d 814, 831 
(ED. Pa. 2019) (declining to dismiss case because ""state law claims of the named [plaintiffs] largely parallel those of the putative 
class members""); Gress v. Freedom Mortg. Corp., 386 F. Supp. 3d 455, 462 (M.D. Pa. 2019) (""Plaintiffs' capacity to state claims 
under the laws of other states on behalf of putative class members . . . is a matter to be decided under the rubric of Rule 23"" and 
is not issue of standing). "
196,25," The other appellate court cases cited by the EPPs do not address the disputed issue here. The Fourth Circuit decision in 
Mayor & City Council of Balt. v. Actelion Pharms. Ltd., 995 F.3d 123, 131 (4th Cir. 2021), addressed statutory standing, not 
Article III standing. The Sixth Circuit and Seventh Circuit decisions allowed named plaintiffs to assert the same federal law 
claims as the putative class members. See Fallick v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 162 F.3d 410, 423 (6th Cir. 1998); Arreola v. 
Godinez, 546 F.3d 788, 790, 795 (7th Cir. 2008). "
197,26," California's Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16720, ""applies only to a 'combination' involving 'two or more persons,' 
not to unilateral conduct."" Flagship Theatres of Palm Desert, LLC v. Century Theatres, Inc., 198 Cal. App. 4th 1366, 1386, 131

Donnelly Act ""must allege . . . concerted action by two or more entities."" Global Reinsurance Corp. U.S. Branch v. Equitas Ltd,

on reverse settlement agreement); Lipitor, 336 F. Supp. 3d at 421 (same)."
197,28," The EPPs filed their original complaint on February 21, 2019 (see C.A. No. 19-369, D.I. 1) and ""enclose[d]"" a copy of the 
complaint in letters sent to the attorney general ""on or about April 30, 2019."" (See D.I. 202 ¶ 274) The EPPs also provided a 
notice to the Hawaii attorney general ten days after filing their second amended complaint. (See D.I. 224 Ex. A) "
199,29," But see In re Aggrenox Antitrust Litig., 94 F. Supp. 3d 224, 253-54 (D. Conn. 2015) (finding that Hawaii's procedural 
requirements are not sufficiently part of its framework of substantive rights or remedies)."
199,30," Several courts have found that the Hawaii statute does not require dismissal for failure to comply with procedural 
requirements. See, e.g., In re Aftermarket Filters Antitrust Litig., 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 104114, 2009 WL 3754041, at *6 (N.D. 
Ill. Nov. 5, 2009); In re Propranolol Antitrust Litig., 249 F. Supp 3d 712, 728 n.14 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); Sergeants Benevolent Ass'n 
Health & Welfare Fund v. Actavis, PLC, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220574, 2018 WL 7197233, at *25 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 26, 2018). 
While the statute is silent on the proper remedy for non-compliance with its procedural requirements, the Court concludes that 
the EPPs have acquired no right to conduct class actions without affording the state attorney general the right of first refusal. It 
follows that their antitrust claims should be dismissed. See, e.g., Asacol, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 94605, 2016 WL 4083333, at 
*15; Lipitor, 336 F. Supp. 3d at 416; In re Chocolate Confectionary Antitrust Litig., 749 F. Supp. 2d 224, 232-33 (M.D. Pa. 2010); 
In re Flash Memory Antitrust Litig., 643 F. Supp. 2d 1133, 1158 (N.D. Cal. 2009)."
199,31," The Missouri statute defines ""person"" to include business entities. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 407.010(5)."
199,32," A Missouri state court has held that plaintiffs who purchase merchandise indirectly from defendants can seek damages under 
this statute, but has not addressed the issue of whether the statute authorizes claims of plaintiffs who purchase — directly or 
indirectly — merchandise for someone else's personal use. See State v. Polley, 2 S.W.3d 887, 891-92 (Mo. Ct. App. 1999) 
(consumer's home-repair materials and services purchased indirectly from construction business); Gibbons v. J. Nuckolls, Inc., 
216 S.W.3d 667, 669-70 (Mo. 2007) (consumer's automobile purchased indirectly from automobile wholesaler). Consistent with 
the Court's interpretation of the statute, these state court cases permit consumer-plaintiffs to proceed with claims if they have 
purchased (albeit indirectly) merchandise for their own personal use, not for someone else's personal use. "
200,33," Defendants also include Florida in this category. However, the Illinois Brick doctrine does not prevent the EPPs from bringing 
claims under the Florida Deceptive & Unfair Trade Practices Act (""FDUTPA""), Fla. Stat. § 501.201, et seq. See Mack v. Bristol-
Myers Squibb Co., 673 So. 2d 100, 110-11 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1996); In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litig., 290 F. Supp. 3d 772, 
819-20 (N.D. Ill. 2017). Thus, Illinois Brick does not provide a basis for dismissing the EPPs' unjust enrichment claim under 
Florida law."
200,34," Alaska allows only the state attorney general to bring antitrust claims on behalf of those indirectly harmed. See Alaska Stat. 
Ann. § 45.50.577(i). "
201,35," For the same reasons, the Court will not dismiss the unjust enrichment claims as duplicative where the EPPs have plausibly 
pled any statutory claim in a particular state. (See D.I. 210 at 19) "

and view[] those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff""). "
219,2, The parties agreed to consolidate the cases for pretrial purposes. 
220,3," By contrast, FSIS views ""terms such as 'U.S. (Species),' 'U.S.A. Beef,' and 'Fresh American Beef' . . . as geographic claims 
associated with animal raising and production,"" denoting ""that the cattle to which the terms are applied were born, raised, 
slaughtered, and prepared in the United States or in specific geographic locations in the United States."" 66 Fed. Reg. 41160, 
41160."
220,4," The dissent acknowledges this recent history but focuses on the broader historical context leading to federal regulation of the 
meat industry at the turn of the 20th century. Yet this more recent history significantly undercuts the dissent's conclusion that 
plaintiffs' claims should be allowed to proceed. Although not dispositive, it is certainly relevant that plaintiffs seek to impose—by 
way of New Mexico law—a similar country-of-origin approach to labeling that Congress specifically repealed in 2015."
220,5," Some of these cases apply the preemption provision of the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), 21 U.S.C. §§ 451-473, 
which is substantively identical to § 678. Compare § 678 (""Marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements in addition 
to, or different than, those made under this chapter may not be imposed by any [s]tate . . . .""), with 21 U.S.C. § 467e (""Marking, 
labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements . . . in addition to, or different than, those made under this chapter may not be 
imposed by any [s]tate . . . .""). "
221,6," The dissent agrees that the plain language of § 678 governs the express-preemption analysis. Yet in our view, the dissent's 
approach—under which it would adopt an ""equally plausible construction of the statute"" that disfavors preemption, Dissent 6—
would effectively invoke the inapplicable presumption against preemption. And notably, in beginning its purportedly plain-
language approach to this ""meaty question of statutory interpretation,"" the dissent focuses not on the text of § 678, but instead 
on the historical backdrop that prompted federal regulation of the meat industry. Id. at 1; cf. also Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., Inc., 
557 U.S. 167, 175-76, 129 S. Ct. 2343, 174 L. Ed. 2d 119 (2009) (""Statutory construction must begin with the language 
employed by Congress and the assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language accurately expresses the legislative 
purpose."" (quoting Engine Mfrs. Ass'n S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252, 124 S. Ct. 1756, 158 L. Ed. 2d 529 
(2004)))."
221,7," Indeed, as defendants point out, in alleging that the current labels are misleading, plaintiffs essentially seek to impose a 
labeling standard similar to the more restrictive approach to country-of-origin labeling that Congress implemented in 2008 but 
abandoned in 2015."
221,8, The district court relied in part on the Southern District of California's decision that the Ninth Circuit affirmed in Webb. 
222,9," This simple fact undermines plaintiffs' reliance on cases in which state-law claims survived preemption because those claims 
alleged conduct that violated the FMIA. See, e.g., Mario's Butcher Shop & Food Ctr., Inc. v. Armour & Co., 574 F. Supp. 653, 
656 (N.D. Ill. 1983). "
223,10," The dissent also relies on the states' concurrent jurisdiction, as well as the FMIA's requirement that labels be ""not false or 
misleading and . . . approved by the Secretary,"" to conclude that plaintiffs claims should not be preempted. § 607(d) (emphasis 
added). According to the dissent, the conjunction ""and"" in § 607(d) ""suggests that mere agency approval does not suffice to 
satisfy the statute."" Dissent 6. And the dissent interprets the states' concurrent jurisdiction as ""allowing states to enforce the 
[FMIA's] prohibition against misleading labels when the agency declines to do so."" Id. Yet the dissent's view overlooks the critical 
language of the FMIA's preemption provision, which prohibits states from imposing ""requirements in addition to, or different than, 
those made under this chapter."" § 678. And allowing plaintiffs' claims to proceed here would effectively allow New Mexico law to 
impose labeling requirements additional to or different than the labels that the FSIS has already approved as neither false nor 
misleading. "
224,11," Our preemption ruling is further supported by the executive order plaintiffs highlight in a letter of supplemental authority. See 
Fed. R. App. P. 28(j). Plaintiffs point to the portion of the order directing the Secretary of Agriculture to ""consider initiating a 
rulemaking to define the conditions under which the labeling of meat products can bear voluntary statements indicating that the 
product is of United States origin, such as 'Product of USA.'"" Aplt. Rule 28(j) Letter, July 21, 2021 (quoting Exec. Order No. 
14,036, Promoting Competition in the Am. Econ., 86 Fed. Reg. 36987, 36993 (July 9, 2021)). And although plaintiffs contend 
that this order ""directly supports"" their position that defendants ""are engaged in using voluntary deceptive practices to mislead 
consumers,"" it does nothing to overcome the preemption issue. Id. Instead, as defendants assert, the order's instruction ""to

preempted under [the] current rules."" Aplee. Rule 28(j) Letter, July 23, 2021."
224,12," We do not—as the dissent contends—""assert that beef raised and even slaughtered in other countries can legally be said to 
be a product of the United States of America merely because it was packaged here for retail sale."" Dissent 1. On the contrary, 
we offer no opinion on the FSIS's broad interpretation of the meaning of the ""Product of the U.S.A."" label. We simply hold that 
plaintiffs cannot use their state-law claims as a mechanism for bypassing federally approved labeling. "
225,13," In so doing, we express no opinion on the district court's alternative holding that the false-advertising claims would be 
preempted. "
226,1," Sinclair's work was hardly the public's first exposure to problems in the meat industry. In 1898, the industry came under fire for 
supplying rotten canned beef to American troops fighting in Cuba amidst the Spanish-American War. James Harvey Young, The 
Pig That Fell Into the Privy: Upton Sinclair's 'The Jungle' and the Meat Inspection Amendments of 1906, 59 Bulletin H. Med. 467, 
468-69 (1985). Soon-to-be President Roosevelt, a Colonel fighting as a ""Rough Rider"" in Cuba at the time, refused to eat the 
""embalmed beef."" Id. Moreover, at the dawn of the trust-busting era, scholars and journalists had long noted the ""Beef Trust's"" 
monopolistic efforts to raise consumer prices and reduce competition from small, independent cattle farmers. Id. at 468; see also 
generally Francis Walker, The 'Beef Trust' and the United States Government, 16 Econ. J. 491 (1906)."
226,2," The majority discusses more recent history, including a law in place from 2008 to 2015 that more tightly regulated country-of-
origin labeling and was Congressionally repealed following WTO proceedings and imposition of tariffs against the United States. 
(Op. at 7-8.) As the majority's own authorities make clear, however, Plaintiffs are not seeking to reimpose the same labeling 
regime established by the repealed statute. (Id.) For example, the statute affirmatively required disclosure of foreign beef's 
country of origin. Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-234, § 11002, 122 Stat. 923, 1351-53 (2008); 
see also Joel L. Greene, Country-of-Origin Labeling for Foods and the WTO Trade Dispute on Meat Labeling, Cong. Rsch. 
Serv., RS22955 at 4 (2015). On appeal, plaintiffs merely contend that New Mexico law prohibits ""Product of the U.S.A."" labeling 
for cattle that are born and raised in other countries. If Congress wishes to preempt such a claim, it is free to do so by enacting a 
new statute. Likewise, the USDA can promulgate a formal rule. See infra n.3 (explaining that mere agency guidance does not 
have the same preemptive effect as formal rules). "
227,3," Having established that FSIS approval does not necessarily render a label compliant with the FMIA, the question remains 
whether approval of defendants' labels in this case is sufficient. Defendants point only to the FSIS Policy Book for the proposition 
that their labels comply with the FMIA's regulatory regime. Policy Book, supra at 147. Several of our sibling circuits have held 
that mere agency guidance, as opposed to statutes or formal regulations, is not automatically entitled to preemptive effect. See, 
e.g., Good v. Altria Group, Inc., 501 F.3d 29, 51 (1st Cir. 2007); Wabash Valley Power Ass'n, Inc. v. Rural Electrification Admin., 
903 F.2d 445, 453-54 (7th Cir. 1990); Reid v. Johnson & Johnson, 780 F.3d 952, 962-65 (9th Cir. 2015); Fellner v. Tri-Union 
Seafoods, LLC., 539 F.3d 237 (3d Cir. 2008). Because the FSIS Policy Book is accompanied by a disclaimer that its contents 
""do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way,"" it is hard to derive Congressional or 
agency intent for such guidance to preempt state law. FSIS, Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, 
https://www.fsis.usda.gov/guidelines/2005-0003. "
228,," The majority cites several cases for the proposition that FSIS approval is dispositive that defendants' labels are not misleading. 
(Op. 11-15.) But these cases are all distinguishable because they did not rely on mere agency guidance to support a finding of 
preemption. See, e.g., Webb v. Trader Joe's Co., 999 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir. 2021). To the extent other courts find that FSIS 
approval based on guidance does preempt state law, we should decline to adopt that holding as contrary to the text and purpose 
of the FMIA."
228,4," Because I would reverse on the preemption conclusion, it is also necessary to discuss the district court's alternative holdings. 
The court's dismissal of plaintiffs' New Mexico Unfair Practices Act, unjust enrichment, and antitrust claims all depend at least in 
part on FSIS approval of defendants' labels. Because such approval is not conclusive that labels are fair, accurate, or lawful, I 
would reverse these dismissals and allow these claims to proceed as well. I concur with the majority that the district court 
properly dismissed plaintiffs' false advertising claim. "
238,1," The majority of the facts set forth are taken from the FAC and for purposes of ruling on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, the 
Court assumes the truth of the allegations pled and liberally construes all allegations in favor of the non-moving party. Manzarek 
v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008). "
239,2," The 2015 NDA and 2018 Amendment will be referred to collectively as, the NDAs. Furthermore, throughout the entire FAC, 
Plaintiffs allege XpandOrtho relied on the NDAs when divulging confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information and 
devices to Defendants. See, e.g., id. at 52, ¶ 176; 53, ¶ 181. The Court understands Plaintiffs plead reliance on the NDAs and 
will not restate these repetitive assertions in the Statement of Facts. "
240,3," Plaintiffs allege XpandOrtho's trade secrets include (but are not limited to): (1) geometry, dynamics, and kinematics of the XO1 
device; (2) the XO1 Animation and information regarding XO1 contained therein; (3) designs of prototypes using multiple 
actuators; (4) designs of sensors for soft tissue balancing devices; (5) benefits of certain characteristics of the XO1; (6) 
confidential portions of XpandOrtho's communications with the FDA respecting 510(k) certification; (7) methods of sterilizing the 
XO1 device; (8) manufacturing information for the XO1 device; (9) the wireless link between the controller and the radio module; 
(10) the custom circuit board input in the trial implant, controller, and radio module; (11) source code for the trial implant, 
controller, PC radio module, and the tablet PC GUI; (12) calibration processes, equipment, and software; and (13) the negative 
know-how contained in the history and results of XpandOrtho's development process (i.e., the design paths evaluated, as well as 
reasons for following certain design paths over others). Id. at 25-27, ¶ 84. Plaintiffs allege these trade secrets ""were developed 
by XpandOrtho in the course of its business at significant time, effort, and expense . . . ."" Id. at 28, ¶ 86. "
242,4," ""XpandOrtho is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exactech."" Id. at 6, ¶ 8. "
243,5," Despite this Order, the Court never received Exhibits G and O. However, because the Court will not engage in resolving factual 
disputes, the Exhibits at issue are not required to decide Defendants' Motion. See infra Part III.A.6-7; Part III.B. "
249,6," As established above, the Court will apply the heightened pleadings standard of Rule 9(b) only to Plaintiffs' claims for fraud, 
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and 
violation of the UCL. "
250,7," Defendants further note that Plaintiffs' fraud claim is also preempted by the Copyright Act ""because it relies on alleged harm 
that is equivalent to that in Plaintiffs' copyright claim—that Defendants misused and disclosed frames from the XO1 Animation."" 
Motion at 18 n.4. Defendants make this argument in a footnote with no further explanation or analysis. See id. Plaintiffs contend 
the argument fails because the harm resulted from Exactech's delay in acquiring XpandOrtho, and not from the use of the 
copyrighted images. Oppo. at 33 n.13. Given the dispute and reading the FAC in the light most favorable to the non-moving 
party, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs. See also Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 498 F. Supp. 3d 1296, 1309 (S.D. Cal. "

8883942, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 4, 2019)) (explaining that parties waive ""arguments raised only in footnotes""). "
252,8," First, Defendants suggest that the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing arises from the LOI 
and Defendants' alleged larger effort to delay or stop negotiations between XpandOrtho and Exactech. Motion at 21. Second, 
Defendants contend that the intentional interference with prospective economic advantage claim involves Defendants' alleged 
interference with XpandOrtho and Exactech's prospective relationship, which caused XpandOrtho to end discussions with 
Exactech and enter into the LOI with Defendants. Id. Defendants argue both of these claims rely on the LOI, and the LOI 
contains a forum-selection clause specifying Wilmington, Delaware as the exclusive venue for actions arising out of or related to 
the LOI.8Id. at 21-22. Plaintiffs take the position that Defendants waived their venue argument when they agreed not to challenge venue while seeking 
more time to respond to Plaintiffs' original complaint. Oppo. at 34. Plaintiffs explain Defendants' waiver also should apply to the 
FAC, because the original complaint involved the same parties and factual circumstances, and repeatedly mentioned the LOI. Id. 
Plaintiffs point out that even if Defendants did not waive their venue challenge, it should fail because Exactech was not a party to 
the LOI and did not consent to the forum-selection clause. Id. Defendants reply that their ""agreement not to challenge venue in response to Plaintiffs' original complaint does not apply to the 
FAC because Plaintiffs revised the fundamental basis for"" the claims at issue. Reply at 13. Defendants assert ""Plaintiffs never 
indicated that they would add the LOI as a basis for their claims when they requested a venue waiver."" Id. at 13 n.10. 
Defendants explain the original complaint based the applicable claims on the NDAs, but the FAC based them on the LOI, which 
is an entirely different agreement containing a forum-selection clause. Id. at 14. Defendants further argue Exactech is 
XpandOrtho's parent company and bound by the LOI. Id. at 13. Defendants contend Exactech cannot sue based on the LOI and 
then claim it is not subject to the LOI's forum-selection clause. Id. "

Electronically. ECF No. 45. The Court granted this Motion but did not receive the specified Exhibits. ECF No. 73. However, 
based on the screenshots of the XO1 Animation provided, and the Court's conclusion that it will not resolve factual disputes at

254,17, U.S.C.A. § 107(1)-(4).
254,12," Plaintiffs argue the use of the XO1 Animation is not transformative because as Defendants state in their Motion, the ""figures 
are used to 'illustrate the functionality of [an XpandOrtho] medical device."" Id. at 37 (citing Motion at 17). Plaintiffs also claim that 
copying the images was a shortcut so that Defendants would not have to ""creat[e] their own illustration or, pay[] to license an "
255,," illustration . . . ."" and therefore, the use was to save costs. Oppo. at 37. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants ask the Court to 
disregard the commercial nature of Defendants' use of the images, because ""a patent's primary function [is] to provide a limited 
monopoly on making, using, and selling the claimed invention for the owner's commercial benefit."" Id. Plaintiffs also claim the 
XO1 Animation is creative due to the included set of sequential illustrations, thus affording copyright protection. Id. at 38; see 
also FAC at 81, ¶ 286. Plaintiffs further argue the copyrighted work is not the twominute video as a whole, but ""the visible 
portions of the work that were submitted to the Copyright Office for registration."" Oppo. at 38. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants 
fail to explain how the cropping, resizing, and displayed modifications qualitatively distinguish the images used in the patent 
applications from the XO1 animation. Id. Finally, Plaintiffs claim Defendants make conclusory statements that there is no market 
for the XO1 Animation, and that given the patent illustrations industry and Defendants' lack of evidence to support this claim, the 
factor weighs in favor of Plaintiffs. Id. at 39. "

267,1," This background draws from the First Amended Complaint, which we refer to as the Complaint for ease of reference. Because 
the district court dismissed the Equal Protection Claim before the SmileDirect parties amended the complaint, we also recount 
factual allegations from the original complaint, as supplemented by the SmileDirect parties' Offer of Proof. "
268,2, The SmileDirect parties do not seek to resuscitate their Due Process claim on appeal. 
269,3," The Board Actors do not argue, and we therefore do not consider, whether they are a single entity incapable of conspiring 
within the meaning of § 1. See, e.g., N.C. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs v. FTC, 717 F.3d 359, 371-72 (4th Cir. 2013), aff'd on 
other grounds, 574 U.S. 494, 135 S. Ct. 1101, 191 L. Ed. 2d 35 (2015); Am. Needle, Inc. v. Nat'l Football League, 560 U.S. 183, 
191-92, 130 S. Ct. 2201, 176 L. Ed. 2d 947 (2010). "
277,1," According to Defendants, Plaintiffs erroneously named Cardinal Health, Inc. as a Defendant. The relevant distribution entity is 
Cardinal Health 200, LLC. "
278,2," The Providers argue that the Distribution Agreements often have one-sided termination clauses, meaning that distributors can 
terminate those contracts, but providers cannot. Defendants object that the Providers inappropriately supplemented the SAC 
through their brief opposing the motion to dismiss. Compare Agnew v. Nat'l Collegiate Athletic Ass'n, 683 F.3d 328, 348 (7th Cir. 
2012) (""[I]t is a basic principle that the complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss, nor can 
it be amended by the briefs on appeal.""), with United States ex rel. Hanna v. City of Chicago, 834 F.3d 775, 779 (7th Cir. 2016) 
(Rule 8 allows a plaintiff to add facts to the complaint ""by affidavit or brief—even a brief on appeal.""). Because this fact does not 
alter our analysis, we need not decide whether the Providers raised it too late. "
279,3," Technically, the Providers' cause of action is rooted in the Clayton Act, not the Sherman Act. Section 4 of the Clayton Act 
provides that ""any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws 
may sue ... and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained."" 15 U.S.C. § 15(a)."
279,4," The facts of Illinois Brick offer a useful illustration. There, the State of Illinois sued Illinois Brick, a manufacturer of concrete 
blocks, alleging that Illinois paid more for the concrete blocks than it would have absent a price-fixing conspiracy. Illinois Brick 
sold the blocks to masonry contractors, who sold them to general contractors, who sold their services to the State of Illinois. 
Because the State had not purchased the blocks directly from Illinois Brick, the State was not the proper party to bring suit."
279,5," Other circuits have reached the same conclusion. See Insulate SB, Inc. v. Advanced Finishing Sys., Inc., 797 F.3d 538, 542 
(8th Cir. 2015); Lowell v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 177 F.3d 1228, 1229-31 (11th Cir. 1999); Arizona v. Shamrock Foods Co., 729 
F.2d 1208, 1211-13 (9th Cir. 1984). "
280,6," Independent action does not violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act. See Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 760; Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 
550 U.S. 544, 553-54, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929 (2007) (citing Theatre Enters., Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., 
346 U.S. 537, 540, 74 S. Ct. 257, 98 L. Ed. 273 (1954)). "
281,7," Antitrust injury and antitrust standing are related but distinct concepts. The canonical case on antitrust injury is Brunswick v. 
Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, not Illinois Brick. See Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 487-89, 97 S. Ct. 690, 50 
L. Ed. 2d 701 (1977) (holding that mere economic loss does not amount to an antitrust injury under the antitrust laws). In "
282,," Brunswick, bowling alley operators alleged that a competitor hurt their businesses by acquiring struggling bowling alleys that 
otherwise would have gone bankrupt. The Supreme Court rejected their theory of antitrust liability, reiterating that the antitrust 
laws protect ""competition not competitors."" Id. at 488. ""The antitrust injury requirement ensures that a plaintiff can recover only if 
the loss stems from a competition-reducing aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior."" Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum 
Co., 495 U.S. 328, 344, 110 S. Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990)."
282,8," The Providers also cite McGarry & McGarry, LLC v. Bankruptcy Management Solutions, Inc., 937 F.3d 1056 (7th Cir. 2019), 
but that case is distinguishable. 937 F.3d 1056, 1063, 1065-66 (7th Cir. 2019) (concluding that plaintiff had ""just barely"" pleaded 
sufficient facts for Article III injury-in-fact, and in any event, plaintiff did not allege the type of injury the antitrust laws were meant 
to prevent). "
283,9," Furthermore, if the litigation were to proceed to the class certification stage, the Providers would not be adequate 
representatives of medical providers that purchase the Products from Cardinal. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4)."
283,10," Cf. Chi. Studio Rental, Inc. v. Ill. Dep't of Commerce, 940 F.3d 971, 978-79 (7th Cir. 2019) (concluding that plaintiff film studio 
""has pleaded an injury to itself, not an anticompetitive injury to the market""). "
284,11," See, e.g., Copperweld Corp. v. Indep. Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984) (equating the 
rule of reason with ""an inquiry into market power and market structure designed to assess [a restraint's] actual effect""); Ill. Tool

tying product). "
286,12," The only Cardinal-specific allegation is that Cardinal promotes BD's products over those of its in-house brand, Covidien. This

288,2," This court at times uses ""Inmar"" to refer to either Inmar, CMS, CCC, and/or CS. "
292,3," The parties' arguments focused on the admissibility of the transcripts of Balsiger's criminal trial testimony, which is addressed 
in this opinion. The parties did not specifically address at summary judgment the effect of conflicting statements, if any, between 
Balsiger's trial testimony and his deposition testimony. After review of the portions of the transcripts presented, this court is not 
able to weigh that testimony to make any finding as to whether any conflicts in testimony should affect this analysis. To the 
contrary, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, this court is compelled to consider Balsiger's 
testimony in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs. "
294,4," The Third Circuit in Flat Glass defined an ""oligopolist"" as ""a firm in a concentrated market."" 385 F.3d at 359. For example, in a market of one hundred sellers of equal size, an expansion in output of 20 percent by one of them will 
result in an average fall in output of only about .2 percent for each of the others, so a seller need not worry in making his 
pricing decisions about the reactions of his rivals. But if there are three sellers of equal size, a 20 percent expansion in the 
sales of one will cause the sales of each of the others to fall by an average of 10 percent—a sales loss the victims can 
hardly overlook. Id. at 359 n.10 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted) (quoting Richard A. Posner, Antitrust Law 56 (2d ed. 2001)). "
302,1," Dr. Strombom's opinion criticizing Mr. Saba's regression analyses as flawed and unreliable is not discussed, since Defendants 
do not dispute the close correlation that the regression analyses show. "
307,2," Defendants make this argument invoking requirement that the class be ""ascertainable."" But their objection is not that class 
membership cannot be determined with objective criteria, rather that this determination would be too onerous. The Second 
Circuit has expressly declined to incorporate a requirement of administrative feasibility into the ascertainabiltiy doctrine. In re 
Petrobras Sec., 862 F.3d 250, 264-65 (2d Cir. 2017). "
315,1," The Court has also received and considered the subsequent authorities submitted by the parties. (See Dkt. Nos. 32, 34-36.) "
316,2," AliveCor adopts in the alternative broader definitions of the relevant ECG-capable smartwatch market that it defines as ""all 
smartwatches"" or ""all ECG-capable wearable devices."" (Id. ¶ 35.)"
316,3," In the alternative, AliveCor alleges that the relevant market can be more broadly defined as ""all heart rate analysis apps for 
wearable devices."" (Id. ¶ 46.) "
318,4," In its request for judicial notice, Apple asks the Court to consider these documents under the doctrine of incorporation by 
reference. In reply, Apple appears to conflate judicial notice under Federal Rule of Evidence 201 and incorporation by reference. 
(See Dkt. No. 27, RJN Reply, 1:27-2:2.) Because Apple's request for judicial notice did not address whether judicial notice was 
proper under Rule 201, the Court will not consider whether the exhibits would be proper subjects of judicial notice under Rule 
201. "
319,5," This element of an antitrust claim need not be pled with specificity. See Cost Mgmt. Servs., Inc. v. Washington Nat. Gas Co., 
99 F.3d 937, 950 (9th Cir. 1996) (complaint ""need only allege sufficient facts from which the court can discern the elements of an 
injury resulting from an act forbidden by the antitrust laws"") (citation and quotation omitted). "
320,6," HN11[
] Antitrust law requires allegation of both a product market and a geographic market. AliveCor alleges the United States is the relevant geographic market for its hardware and software product markets. (Compl. ¶¶ 37, 47.) Apple does not 
challenge that allegation. "
321,7," The Court finds Pistacchio v. Apple Inc. distinguishable. In Pistacchio, the court concluded that the plaintiff had not adequately 
pled that the relevant market should be limited to the iOS platform. 4:20-cv-07034-YGR, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47071, 2021 WL 
949422, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 11, 2021). However, the plaintiff in Pistacchio did not allege an aftermarket theory, and the 
complaint contained far fewer allegations supporting the alleged relevant market. "
338,1," It is unclear what damage amount Mr. Camaisa is requesting for injury directly and proximately caused by PRA's actions. The 
only reference to injury in the Complaint is the loss of the $10 million Contingent Consideration, and therefore, the court treats 
this as the injury amount, for purposes of this Motion. Complaint ¶ 43. "
341,2," Mr. Camaisa could argue that the damages sought by ""more direct victims"" are of a different nature than those sought by the 
Shareholders and would not include any damages that would encompass the Contingent Consideration. However, this argument 
is meritless because Mr. Camaisa has failed to allege that PRA's antitrust actions are responsible for the Shareholders' harm. 
See Chemi SpA v. GlaxoSmithKline, 356 F. Supp. 2d 495, 502-03 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (holding that duplicative recovery was unlikely 
because Chemi had a unique injury of lost profits which other victims could not assert, as they could only claim increased 
prices). "
345,3," Granting Mr. Camaisa leave to amend is futile, because he can neither establish antitrust standing nor can he assert 
allegations to plead a claim of attempted monopolization. Indeed, at oral argument despite inquiry from the court, Mr. Camaisa's 
Counsel offered no explanation of how he could cure Mr. Camaisa's antitrust standing. Moreover, he offered no persuasive 
argument that he could amend the Complaint to cure the deficient relevant market definition without contradicting allegations that 
competition exists in the market, which includes competitors with the ability to acquire competing technologies. Mr. Camaisa's 
Counsel admitted that the allegations made in paragraphs 13, 37, 38, and 45 of the Complaint, are all true. These paragraphs 
directly address the competition within the market and the ability of PRA's competitors to acquire competing technologies. Mr. 
Camaisa's attorney stated they would not withdraw these paragraphs in the event they amended the Complaint. Accordingly, the 
court does not find it permissible to allow Mr. Camaisa leave to amend the Complaint to assert contradictory allegations about 
the relevant market. "
348,1," An assertion of jurisdiction based on ""CAFA does not change the traditional rule that the party seeking to remove the case to 
federal court bears the burden of establishing federal jurisdiction."" Evans v. Walter Indus., Inc., 449 F.3d 1159, 1164 (11th Cir. 
2006); Lowery v. Alabama Power Co., 483 F.3d 1184, 1208 (11th Cir. 2007). "
349,2," The Park is an ""age 55 or older"" mobile home park with 742 rental residential lots. Amended Complaint at 6. The Park's mobile 
homeowners are largely elderly persons over 65 years of age. Id."
349,3," The Court previously dismissed the Association's claims against Defendant Florida Manufactured Housing Association, Inc. 
based on a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal. (Docs. 35, 36)."
349,4," Although the Supreme Court in AU Optronics Corp. generally described CAFA, it dealt more specifically with provisions 
concerning a ""mass action"" under CAFA, which Defendants do not allege as the basis for federal jurisdiction in this case. See 28 
U.S.C. § 1332(d)(11)(B)(i). "
350,5," In pertinent part, Florida Statute section 723.075(1) provides that upon incorporation, a homeowners' association shall become 
a representative of all the homeowners in all matters relating to this Chapter, regardless of whether the homeowner is a member 
of the association. "
351,6," The court identified the relevant portions of Rule 23 to be the requirements that '""[o]ne or more members of a class may sue or 
be sued as representative parties on behalf of all members only if' numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of 
representation are met, and if the class meets other requirements and is certified by the court as a class after following certain 
notice procedures.'"" Id. at 158 (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)-(c)). "
352,7," ""The rule was amended once in 1993 to make minor, editorial changes."" Biza, Corp., 304 So.3d at 1232, n.4. "
353,8," The Eleventh Circuit held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1453(c)(1) because the remand 
was sua sponte, not on ""the motion of any party."" Ruhlen, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 6184, 2022 WL 701622, at *3. In citing to Holiday Haven, the Court notes that decisions of other district courts are not binding; nevertheless, they may be cited 
as persuasive authority. See Stone v. First Union Corp., 371 F.3d 1305, 1310 (11th Cir. 2004) (noting that, ""[a]lthough a district 
court would not be bound to follow any other district court's determination, the decision would have significant persuasive 
effects.""). "
354,9," Given the Court's determination that the Association's claim does not fall within the definition of a class action under CAFA, the 
Court need not reach the issue of whether the amount in controversy meets the requisite $5,000,000 in damages required under 
CAFA. "
355,10," Defendants state that they ""dispute the HOA has Article III standing because the antitrust claim does not fall within the narrow 
set of claims the HOA can bring on behalf of the homeowners under § 723.075(1) and Rule 1.222, but that dispute is for another 
day."" Defendants' Response at 3. The Court finds that the dispute is not only for another day, it is for another court as well. "
361,1," ""In determining any motion for summary judgment or partial summary judgment, the Court may assume that the material facts 
as claimed and adequately supported by the moving party are admitted to exist without controversy except to the extent that 
such material facts are (a) included in the 'Statement of Genuine Disputes' and (b) controverted by declaration or other written 
evidence filed in opposition to the motion."" L.R. 56-3. "
365,2," The Court acknowledges Innovative's warning that because Compass used Abbott's reported sales volume since 2013 instead 
of its installed base of systems, this number ""would overstate Abbott's installed base to the extent that some systems purchased 
since 2013 would have been subsequently traded in or otherwise discarded."" However, Innovative has provided no evidence of 
systems sold since 2013 being traded in or discarded and this number is notably close to Biosense's internal estimate. See 
RGDF ¶ 90. "
369,3," But it must be noted that Biosense does provide support for other reprocessed catheters regardless who did the reprocessing; 
that would include not exclude Innovative's reprocessed Biosense catheters. "
378,1," As the FTC notes, it does not directly enforce the Sherman Act. FTC Opp'n 10. Instead, the FTC challenges the 2017 
Agreement as a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Id. Courts treat these two actions as having no distinction, 
because violations of the Sherman Act are also ""unfair methods of competition"" that violate the FTC Act. FTC v. Ind. Fed'n of 
Dentists, 476 U.S. 447, 454, 106 S. Ct. 2009, 90 L. Ed. 2d 445 (1986)."
378,2," Endo cites the recent Supreme Court case AMG Capital Management, LLC v. FTC, 141 S. Ct. 1341, 209 L. Ed. 2d 361 (2021), 
for the proposition that the FTC cannot seek disgorgement of profit under § 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. 
Id. at 3. The FTC concedes this point in its reply and withdraws its request for monetary relief. FTC Opp'n 35. "
379,3, The Court notes that the present case does not involve a reverse-payment settlement. 
381,4," Though the FTC does not emphasize the last point, the Court notes that patent infringement is not a crime. A patent holder 
must exert its patent rights in civil litigation to prevent infringement. 35-U.S.C. § 281. Only a patent holder—not a licensee or 
even an exclusive licensee—has the right to sue for patent infringement. Id Therefore, Impax had no right to sue to protect its 
exclusive license. "
382,5," Some Circuits limit the Supreme Court's decision in Actavis solely to reverse-payment settlements. For example, the First 
Circuit has determined that the Supreme Court ""did not intend to disturb commonplace [patent] settlement forms."" In re Loestrin 
24 Fe Antitrust Litig., 814 F.3d 538, 544 n.4 (1st Cir. 2016)."
382,6," The FTC argues that if the 2017 Agreement is protected by the patent laws from antitrust liability, the Court's holding would 
create a ""loophole"" to the Actavis ruling. FTC Opp'n 28. The ""loophole"" would allow companies settling patent infringement suits 
with generics to, instead of ""agreeing to a reverse payment,"" enter a licensing agreement with indeterminant terms and then 
""modify the license to include anticompetitive terms."" Id 27-28. The. Court rejects this slippery-slope argument—if the FTC were 
alleging that the 2017 Agreement was a cleverly hidden plot to disguise a reverse-payment, the Court's analysis would change. 
But the FTC does not allege that. "
383,7," This consideration and the next consideration would likely have exclusively informed the Court's analysis pre Actavis. Pre-
Actavis, the Court would have determined whether the FTC plausibly alleged an agreement that ""threaten[ed] competition in 
areas other than those protected by the patent."" Studiengesellschaft Kohle, 670 F.2d at 1128. "
384,8," The FTC alleges that Endo has ""waived"" its right to exclude Impax. FTC Opp'n 17. While this Court disagrees, see Part III.C, 
infra, the Seventh Circuit has expressly approved of exclusive licensing agreements between two competitors where one lacks 
to right to exclude the other."
384,9," The FTC also attempts to analogize this case to Palmer v. BRG of Georgia, Inc., 498 U.S.. 46, 111 S. Ct. 401, 112 L. Ed. 2d 
349 (1990) and United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 330 (D.C. Cir 2001) (per curiam). See, e.g., 
FTC Opp'n 20, 24. Both these cases involve copyright law, not patent law, and so neither can assist the Court in determining 
what, if any, protection the patent laws provide from antitrust liability. "
392,1," The Noerr-Pennington doctrine is derived from two United States Supreme Court cases: Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference 
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523, 5 L. Ed. 2d 464 (1961) and United Mine Workers of America v. 
Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S. Ct. 1585, 14 L. Ed. 2d 626 (1965). "
393,2," Bardstown Capital asserts that the Land Development and Transportation Committee, a subcommittee of the Commission, first 
held public review of the development plans on December 10, 2009 and held other meetings on January 14 and 28, 2010. 
Bardstown Capital asserts that some of the neighboring homeowners attended these meetings and voiced their concerns and 
opposition to the development."
393,3," The record of the Jefferson Circuit Court action, 10-CI-06022, the action in which the homeowners originally filed an appeal 
from the zoning decision, is not before us in this case."
393,4," Bardstown Capital's complaint named Seiller Waterman, LLC, attorney Bill V. Seiller, and neighboring homeowners—Terry and 
Carolyn Mauney, Phillip and Bettie Stewart, and Elzie and Bridgette Watson. On April 21, 2017, Carolyn Mauney passed away 
and was not named as a party in the appeal to the Court of Appeals."
393,5," A malicious prosecution claim derives from the wrongful prosecution of criminal cases. In a civil context, the claim is more 
accurately characterized as a wrongful use of civil proceedings. Prewitt v. Sexton, 777 S.W.2d 891, 894 (Ky. 1989). "
394,6," The First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects ""the right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a 
redress of grievances"" and applies to state and local governments through the Fourteenth Amendment. Section 1 of the Kentucky Constitution provides in relevant part ""the right . . . of applying to those invested with the power of 
government for redress of grievances or other proper purposes, by petition, address or remonstrance."""
394,7," The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court's dismissal of Bardstown Capital's abuse of process claim, holding that it was filed 
outside the one-year statute of limitations period. The appellate court relied on DeMoisey v. Ostermiller, 2014-CA-001827-MR, 
2016 Ky. App. LEXIS 71, 2016 WL 2609321, *1 (Ky. App. May 6, 2016), an opinion depublished by this Court in its denial of 
discretionary review on December 8, 2016. The Court of Appeals held that ""the cause of action for an abuse of process claim 
accrues at the time the conduct complained of by the plaintiff occurred, not at the termination of the underlying litigation."" 2016 
Ky. App. LEXIS 71, [WL] at *14. Therefore, the court determined that the cause of action accrued on October 22, 2014 when 
Seiller Waterman filed a motion for extension of time to file supplemental briefs, the last action Seiller Waterman took in the 
zoning appeal. Consequently, Bardstown Capital's abuse of process claim included in its amended complaint in February 2017 
was filed outside the statute of limitations. The parties do not raise any issues regarding the abuse of process claim in this 
appeal. "
397,8," We note that the Court of Appeals recently addressed the Noerr-Pennington doctrine in Willow Grande, LLC v. Cherokee 
Triangle Association, Inc., 2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 97, 2020 WL 4910127, *1 (Ky. App. August 21, 2020). Relying on Stepner, 170 
S.W.3d 411, the Court of Appeals determined that ""the [Noerr-Pennington] doctrine generally provides immunity from legal 
action to persons who bring a zoning appeal to induce the passage or enforcement of law or to solicit governmental action."" 
2020 Ky. App. LEXIS 97, [WL] at *5. The Cherokee Triangle Association filed a motion for discretionary review in this Court on 
September 22, 2020. On February 9, 2021, we issued an order holding the Willow Grande case in abeyance pending final 
disposition of this case. "
398,9," See, e.g., Tennessee Code §§ 20-17-101-04 (the Public Participation Act encourages and safeguards ""the constitutional rights 
of persons to petition to speak freely, to associate freely, and to participate in government to the fullest extent permitted by law. . 
. ."" The Act provides that if legal action is filed in response to a person's exercise of their right to petition or freedoms of speech 
and association, that person may file a motion to dismiss the legal action.); Indiana Code §§ 34-7-7-1-10 (the anti-SLAPP law 
allows a party to use ""an act in furtherance of a person's right to petition or free speech"" that is ""in connection with a public issue 
or an issue of public interest"" as a defense to claims brought against them.); Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code §§ 27.001-
.011 (to protect the exercise of constitutional rights, Texas law allows a party to file a motion to dismiss in a legal action based 
on or in response to the party's exercise of their right to free speech, petition, or association). Additional states with anti-SLAPP 
laws include Georgia (Ga. Code § 9-11-11.1), Illinois (735 Ill. Comp. Stat. 110/15), New York (N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 70-a) and 
Oklahoma (Okla. Stat. tit. 12, § 1430)."
398,10," Some jurisdictions refer to immunity afforded to petitioners as Petition Clause immunity, ""reserving the name, Noerr-
Pennington, for antitrust cases."" See CSMN Invs., LLC v. Cordillera Metro. Dist., 956 F.3d 1276, 1283 (10th Cir. 2020). "

399,12," The Louisville Metro Planning and Zoning Commission is tasked with considering change in zoning requests. The Commission 
makes recommendations to the appropriate legislative body, here Louisville Metro Council, which has the final authority to 
approve or deny a change in zoning request. Metro Council voted to enact an ordinance that changed the zoning of the property 
at issue here on July 29, 2010."
399,13," Taylor involved a challenge to a planning and zoning commission decision pursuant to KRS 100.347(2). Because a zoning 
appeal from a legislative body is also a creature of statute, KRS 100.347(3), the Taylor court's designation of ""legislative grace"" 
is equally applicable in the context of subsection (3). "
400,14," As is evident by now, this case presents an important opportunity for this Court to address the longstanding Noerr-Pennington 
doctrine and its applicability in Kentucky zoning matters. We recognize that Seiller Waterman and the homeowners also claim 
that Bardstown Capital did not specifically plead a lack of probable cause, an essential element of a wrongful use of civil 
proceedings claim. See Mosier v. McFarland, 269 Ky. 214, 106 S.W.2d 641, 642 (Ky. 1937) (holding that a lack of probable 
cause is an essential element of a wrongful use of civil proceedings claim and ""must be alleged and proved . . . .""). Seiller 
Waterman and the homeowners suggest that the inadequacy of Bardstown Capital's complaint is the most direct basis for 
upholding the trial court's judgment. Given our ultimate conclusion that the Noerr-Pennington doctrine does in fact apply, and 
affords immunity to Seiller Waterman and the neighboring homeowners, we decline to address this argument."
400,15," In the litigation underlying Stepner, 170 S.W.3d at 413, Stepner failed to name all owners of a development property in his 
KRS 100.347(3) appeal in circuit court, leading that court to dismiss the appeal. "
415,1," For Count 1, the proper language is ""a conspiracy to allocate the market for senior executives"" or ""senior-level employees."" For 
convenience, I will use the term ""employees"" throughout this Order, but for instructions dealing specifically with Count 1 the 
language ""senior executives"" or ""senior-level employees"" should be used. "
417,2," Defendants' other cited case, Midwestern Waffles, Inc. v. Waffle House, Inc., 734 F.2d 705 (11th Cir. 1984) (per curiam), is 
similarly inapplicable. In that case, the Eleventh Circuit summarily affirmed a district court's grant of summary judgment on a 
market allocation claim. Id. at 709. A key issue was whether the alleged allocation was horizontal or vertical. The plaintiff, a 
Waffle House franchisee in Illinois, sued Waffle House for allocating territory in Alabama to specific restaurant operators. Id. at 
716-17. Waffle House has a unique business model. It owns and operates restaurants in some areas and grants franchisees 
exclusive rights to operate Waffle Houses in other areas. Id. The court had to determine whether Waffle House's owning and 
operating some restaurants made it a horizontal competitor of the franchisee-plaintiff or whether Waffle House's granting the 
plaintiff franchise rights meant that it operated vertically at a different level of the market. The court found that the vertical-
horizontal distinction was ""implausible"" in such a case. Id. It loosely defined the relevant market to determine whether the 
restraint was better analyzed under vertical or horizontal Sherman Act-analysis. Id. Its decision to define the relevant market was 
a response to a unique situation and does not establish a general rule for horizontal market allocation agreements. "
422,1," As the Court is proceeding on a Motion to Dismiss, it takes Plaintiff's allegations in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive 
Relief and Damages (the ""Complaint""), [ECF No. 1], as true. See Brooks v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Fla., Inc., 116 F.3d 
1364, 1369 (11th Cir. 1997). Moreover, the Court may properly consider the exhibits attached to the Complaint. Hoefling v. City 
of Miami, 811 F.3d 1271, 1277 (11th Cir. 2016) (""A district court can generally consider exhibits attached to a complaint in ruling 
on a motion to dismiss, and if the allegations of the complaint about a particular exhibit conflict with the contents of the exhibit 
itself, the exhibit controls."" (citation omitted)); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c) (""A copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a 
pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes."")."
422,2, The Complaint does not indicate whether YouTube's Content ID system is a free or paid service. 
423,3," This count is labeled in the Complaint as ""XII"", but the Court will construe it as ""XIII""."
423,4," In light of the Court's findings, it need not address Defendants' statute of limitations argument as it applies to these claims. "
424,5," Hannah v. Armor Corr. Health Servs., Inc., No. 19-CV-596, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88201, 2021 WL 1777881, at *6 (M.D. Fla. 
Mar. 8, 2021) (noting that a basis to reject the plaintiff's argument is the ""fail[ure] to cite any specific, persuasive authority in 
support [because] the Court need not develop [p]laintiff's conclusory arguments or address arguments unsupported by 
authority"")."
424,6," In its response, Plaintiff acknowledges that its Sherman Act and FDUTPA claims rise and fall together. See [ECF No. 21 at 17] 
(""For the same reasons the antitrust claims are legally and factually established, the FDUTPA allegations state a cause of 
action.""). "

assigning [contract, combination ... or conspiracy] a distinct meaning, courts have interpreted them collectively to require 'some

'a conscious commitment to a common scheme.'"" Id. (citing In re Baby Food, 166 F.3d at 117 and In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig.,

formulation of the general pleading standard. Twombly is also an essential guide to the application of that standard in the 
antitrust context, for in Twombly the Supreme Court also had to determine whether a Sherman Act claim alleging horizontal 
conspiracy was adequately pled.""). We apply the same pleading standards to a Section 1 and Section 2 conspiracy claim. See 
W. Penn Allegheny Health Sys., Inc, 627 F.3d at 99-100. If relying exclusively on direct evidence of conspiracy, ""the complaint 
must plead 'enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal' this direct evidence"" of illegality. In re Insur.,

rest on the circumstantial evidence of parallel behavior, the complaint's statement of facts must place the alleged behavior in 'a

449,14," ECF Doc. No. 157 at 15-19. Value Drug offers no argument as to why the settlement agreements are direct evidence of an 
overarching conspiracy despite pleading as much in the first amended class action Complaint. But Value Drug tells us it 
""addressed [our] concern"" about the judicial admissions made by Takeda and Par in other litigation by pleading the object of the 
conspiracy ""was to order the market for generic Colcrys"" and Watson and Amneal stood to benefit from this ordering by ensuring 
limited competition for 135 days after their launch. ECF Doc. No. 176 at 18. It did not. The statements detailed in paragraph "
450,224," (a)-(d) of the first amended class action Complaint all require an inference there is an overarching agreement among Takeda 
and the Generics. None of the statements ""explicitly manifest[]"" the existence of the agreement in question. While the 
statements may be direct evidence of the parties' motive to conspire, they are not direct evidence of the actual agreement. Value 
Drug does not plead direct evidence of a single, horizontal conspiracy."
450,15," A plaintiff may plead an anti-competitive conspiracy violating federal law through circumstantial evidence. See, e.g. In re Ins., 
618 F.3d at 321. But mere allegations of parallel conduct are not enough, nor are allegations of ""conscious parallelism."" Id. 
(""Parallel conduct is, of course, consistent with the existence of an agreement; in many cases where an agreement exists, 
parallel conduct—such as setting prices at the same level—is precisely the concerted action that is the conspiracy's object. But 
as the Supreme Court has long recognized, parallel conduct is 'just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive 
business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.'"" (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 554)). ""In order 
'to avoid deterring innocent conduct that reflects enhanced, rather than restrained, competition,' . . . and in order to enforce the 
Sherman Act's requirement of an agreement, the Supreme Court has required that 'a § 1 plaintiffs offer of conspiracy evidence 
must tend to rule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently."" Id. (further citations omitted). ""Some courts 
have denominated these facts, the presence of which may indicate the existence of an actionable agreement, as 'plus factors'"" 
and although not exhaustive, our Court of Appeals recognizes three such plus factors: (1) motive to enter the conspiracy; (2) 
evidence defendants acted contrary to their interests; and (3) evidence implying a traditional conspiracy. Id. (quoting Flat Glass, 
385 F.3d at 360). ""[P]lus factors are simply circumstances in which the inference of independent action is less likely than that of 
concerted action."" In re Generic Pharms. Pricing Antitrust Litig., 338 F. Supp. 3d at 448 (further citation omitted) (alteration in

451,25," We dismissed the Complaint without prejudice because the conspiracy as pleaded was implausible and belied an inference of 
concerted action. Id. at 20-25. Value Drug then pleaded Takeda and the Generics conspired to preserve a two-entrant market for 
as long as possible, with each Generic enjoying a defined period of exclusive sales. ECF Doc. No. ¶¶ 58, 60 (""Par even 
explained the logic behind the output-restriction conspiracy: ['] [A market with] a single branded drug (Takeda's Colcrys) and a 
single generic version (Par's authorized generic) only functions if the market for Colcrys-equivalent colchicine is limited to those 
two products. [] Although a drug market can maintain price stability with a single generic version of a drug on the market, 
multiple entrants often produce a market-wide price collapse with mass renegotiation and cancellation of supply agreements. [] 
The distribution agreement between Takeda and Par recognizes this dynamic and provides powerful incentives to ensure that 
the parties preserve the two-entrant market' . . . The conduct among Takeda, Par, Watson, and Amneal only makes economic 
sense if there was an agreement among the four of them to restrain their respective generic and authorized-generic output and 
prevent the price collapse that Par so vividly described.""). But we knew from the terms of the license agreements this would not 
occur - Watson and Amneal never stood to benefit from defined periods of exclusive sales. Rather, if and when Watson and 
Amneal entered the market, the very price collapse the conspirators conspired to avoid would occur. We found this admission 
belied a finding of concerted action. But now Value Drug pleads the theory it merely argued in opposing the Defendants' 
previous Motions to dismiss - namely, the conspirators wanted to stave off the ""third wave"" of ANDA filers for as long as possible 
to prevent an incremental price decrease which occurs when each additional generic enters the market, thereby reducing each 
sellers' market share and profits. Value Drug's amended Complaint no longer belies a finding of concerted action. Discovery will 
assist our analysis of this alleged circumstantial evidence."

agreements, containing the contingent launch provisions, are not direct evidence of an overarching conspiracy because it would 
require an inference from the agreements to conclude this, which is classic circumstantial evidence. We did not consider this

Quest, Phadia, and co-conspirators coerced third-party payers and primary care physicians to stop doing business with UAS. 
See Compl. ¶¶ 120-23; Pls.' Resp. 15-17. These vertical arrangements—between firms not competing with one another—do not

142 F.3d 90, 97-98 (2d Cir. 1998). Without weighing in on this issue, the Court will assume that supracompetitive pricing—
standing alone—may constitute evidence of anticompetitive effects. "

105 S. Ct. 2613, 86 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1985). And third-party payors and primary-care physicians still retained the power to decide 
whether to work with UAS—some simply chose not to. ""Even an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another 
does not, without more, state a claim under the federal antitrust laws."" Brooke Grp. Ltd. v Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 
509 U.S. 209, 225, 113 S. Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993). And it is ""often . . . difficult"" to assess whether misrepresentations

allegations may not show that the defendant's actions crossed the line between unfair and anticompetitive conduct."
466,6," The shared-monopoly allegations also overlook plaintiffs' alleged markets. As the Court has explained the markets for allergy 
testing and allergen immunotherapy are separate and distinct. See Part III.A.i, supra. Yet plaintiffs' coterie of villains includes (1) 
an allergy-test manufacturer, (2) an allergy-test consumer and service provider, and (3) board certified allergists who both refer 
patients for allergy tests and administer allergen immunotherapy. Plaintiffs do not allege that this conspiracy sought to 
consolidate power in one entity. Rather, they allege ""joint monopoly power in those markets"" by these alleged miscreants.

this case. In Taylor, the Fourth Circuit, noting the defendants were independent contractors, held that a group of farriers was not 
entitled to use the labor dispute exemption to protect their strike in favor of higher rates. Id. at 602-06. Unlike the jockeys, 
however, and like the fishermen in Columbia River Packers, the farriers provided not just labor but also a product -- horseshoes -

factor' into competition among rival producers of that second product."")."
529,9," To be sure, Pulse has shown injury-in-fact. It claims Visa's conduct caused it to lose PIN debit volume and revenue, and that 
Visa impeded its efforts to compete with its PINless products. These allegations of economic injury establish injury in fact. See, 
e.g., Energy Mgmt. Corp. v. City of Shreveport, 397 F.3d 297, 302 (5th Cir. 2005). But Pulse still lacks antitrust standing 
because of the lack of antitrust injury. ARCO, 495 U.S. at 343-44."

530,12," This also suggests that parties other than Pulse are better situated to bring suit and that Pulse therefore lacks ""proper plaintiff 
status."" See ARCO, 495 U.S. at 345-46 (noting that ""a competitor will be injured and hence motivated to sue only when a 
vertical, maximum-price-fixing arrangement has a procompetitive impact on the market,"" so the competitor's suit ""would not 
protect the rights of dealers and consumers under the antitrust laws"")."

531,15," Pulse obviously suffers injury-in-fact from the FANF, as it contributed to Pulse's losing volume and market share. These 
injuries are real harms that Visa allegedly intended to inflict. HN10[
] Allegations of economic harm are enough to establish 
injury in fact. See supra note 9. The district court plainly erred to the extent it concluded otherwise."
531,16," That is no longer the case. See State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3, 7, 118 S. Ct. 275, 139 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1997) (overruling

532,20," Conceding Pulse has lost volume and market share, Visa attributes those losses to business failures unrelated to Visa's 
conduct. Maybe, maybe not. But it is Visa which moved for summary judgment, and so Pulse gets the benefit of all reasonable 
inferences from the record. La. Crawfish Producers, 852 F.3d at 462. A reasonable jury could conclude from the record that 
Visa's policies deprived Pulse of the opportunity to compete for business from at least one major merchant. "
533,21," See also Norris, 500 F.3d at 467 (holding plaintiffs lacked standing because they were ""neither consumers nor competitors in 
the market attempted to be constrained""); TCA Bldg. Co. v. Nw. Res. Co., 861 F. Supp. 1366, 1380 (S.D. Tex. 1994) (""As a 
competitor for sales . . . in a market which the Defendants have allegedly monopolized, which has allegedly lost sales due to the 
Defendants' allegedly unlawful agreement to exclude competitors, no party is in a better position to vindicate the purposes of the 
antitrust laws than [the plaintiff]."")."
533,22," That is, no merchant or issuer could recover from Visa for Pulse's lost profits and market share. See, e.g., Den Norske Stats 
Oljeselskap As v. Heeremac V.O.F., 241 F.3d 420, 438 (5th Cir. 2001) (Jones, J., dissenting) (stating that had the majority 
reached the issue of antitrust standing, the plaintiff was a proper plaintiff because ""[t]here is no suggestion that any unnamed 
party can seek to recover for the same damages [the plaintiff] suffered"" (emphasis added)); see also Andrx Pharms., 256 F.3d at 
817 (finding a competitor had antitrust standing because his ""alleged injury [was] not measured by or derived from"" the injury 
suffered by ""consumer plaintiffs"")."
533,23," HN14[
] As the Third Circuit has explained, ""[a]n exclusive dealing arrangement is an agreement in which a buyer agrees to 
purchase certain goods or services only from a particular seller for a certain period of time."" ZF Meritor, 696 F.3d at 270. Such 
arrangements, while not always anti-competitive, ""may be used by a monopolist to strengthen its position, which may ultimately 
harm competition."" Ibid. (citing, inter alia, Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 327-29; 11 HERBERT HOVENKAMP, ANTITRUST LAW ¶ 1800a, at 
3 (3d ed. 2011))."
533,24," That also shows why Pulse is injured-in-fact by the agreements and why it's a proper plaintiff to challenge them. Though the 
agreements are with merchants and issuers (and so may harm them in some way), Pulse suffers distinct and direct harm 
because the agreements are allegedly designed to hurt Pulse's market share. See also 9 AREEDA § 1800, at 10 (""If the 
exclusive arrangement is anticompetitive at all, it is because the arrangement forecloses rivals from adequate sales outlets. 
Thus, the condition that makes tying or exclusive dealing anticompetitive in the first place is that customers lack sufficient 
options to purchase . . . elsewhere.""). "
534,25," Our cases also articulate a second, simpler test: a case should be reassigned ""when the facts might reasonably cause an 
objective observer to question the judge's impartiality."" In re DaimlerChrysler Corp., 294 F.3d 697, 701 (5th Cir. 2002) (cleaned 
up); see also Miller, 986 F.3d at 893 (characterizing second test as ""more lenient""). But the two tests are ""redundan[t]"" because 
""the second factor of the first test is virtually identical to the single question the simpler test asks."" Willey v. Harris Cty. Dist. Att'y, 
27 F.4th 1125, 1137 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting United States v. Khan, 997 F.3d 242, 249 n.4 (5th Cir. 2021)). So, we needn't apply 
the second test."
534,26," In one illustrative exchange, Pulse explained it needed discovery because ""we need to know exactly how Visa is implementing 
[the strategies] we're complaining about."" The court denied the request—first telling Pulse that it ""has no evidence"" that Visa 
uses the FANF to finance discounts on per-transaction fees, and then refusing to allow Pulse the chance to obtain that evidence: 
""No. You're not going to get discovery to find out that — You only suspect that it's below cost."""
534,27," The district court suggested that Pulse should be required to produce unilateral discovery because it is the plaintiff: ""since 
[Pulse] brought the lawsuit, it's going to have to show Visa what it's done before I make them reveal their records. They started 
it. They're going to have to take the lead in furnishing the data they have that reflects the injury they say they inflicted."" "
535,28," We have reassigned this district judge's cases before. See, e.g., Khan, 997 F.3d at 249 (reassignment where same judge 
sentenced defendant, was reversed, and on remand ""declined to reconsider the sentence in any respect, showing that he [wa]s 
adamant against further consideration of the substance of the record""); Miller, 986 F.3d at 892-93 (prejudicial comments and 
peremptory rulings justified reassignment); United States v. Swenson, 894 F.3d 677, 683, 685 (5th Cir. 2018) (reassignment 
warranted where judge did not explain discovery rulings and attributed counsel's mistakes to her sex); Shell, 602 F. App'x at 975 
(reassignment where judge ignored our instructions after an appeal, resulting in a second appeal); Latiolais v. Cravins, 574 F. 
App'x 429, 437 (5th Cir. 2014) (concluding judge's comments demonstrated it would be exceedingly difficult for him to put aside 
the views he expressed about the evidence). "
536,1," The Court also defines No Spill to include No Spill Inc. and NSIP Holdings, LLC where appropriate. See Doc. 317 at 51. These 
entities no longer exist and the distinction between those entities and No Spill, LLC is not relevant to the current motion. "
537,2," After closely reviewing the record, the Court determined that oral argument would not materially assist deciding the issues in 
this case."
537,3," The Court relies on alleged facts and grants all reasonable inferences in Scepter's favor. Additional facts are included 
throughout the order."
537,4," ""A district court may consider documents (1) referenced in a complaint that are (2) central to a plaintiff's claims, and (3) 
indisputably authentic when resolving a motion to dismiss without converting the motion to one for summary judgment."" Thomas 
v. Kaven, 765 F.3d 1183, 1197 (10th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted). ""If the rule were otherwise, a plaintiff with a deficient claim 
could survive a motion to dismiss simply by not attaching a dispositive document upon which the plaintiff relied."" GFF Corp. v. 
Ass'n Wholesale Grocers, Inc., 130 F.3d 1381, 1385 (10th Cir. 1997). The 2017 licensing agreement is central to Scepter's 
claims, and Scepter has not disputed the authenticity of the licensing agreement in the record. Therefore, the Court can refer to 
the licensing agreement even at the motion to dismiss stage. "
539,5," Antitrust standing is a pleading requirement that does not remove subject-matter jurisdiction when it is not met and is best 
addressed under the Rule 12(b)(6) framework. See Hartig Drug Co. Inc. v. Senju Pharm. Co., 836 F.3d 261, 270 (3d Cir. 2016) 
(""[S]tatutory standing is simply another element of proof for an antitrust claim, rather than a predicate for asserting a claim in the 
first place."" (citation omitted)). "
542,6," Scepter's other arguments are also unavailing. Scepter's lead argument for antitrust injury is that the magistrate judge found it 
when he granted leave to add counterclaims. Doc. 378 at 14-15. But this argument ignores that not all parties had the 
opportunity to participate in that briefing and ignores that the magistrate judge explicitly explained that his decision did not "
543,," prejudice presenting these issues to this Court under Rule 12(b)(6). Doc. 280 at 17. Scepter also makes repeated passing 
references to consumers paying higher prices for portable fuel containers because of Antitrust Defendants' activities. See, e.g., 
Doc. 317 at 70-77. Scepter cannot establish antitrust standing by referencing potential injury to consumers. See, e.g., Novation 
Ventures, LLC v. J.G. Wentworth Co., 156 F. Supp. 3d 1094, 1101 (C.D. Cal. 2015). Finally, in its opposition to dismissal, 
Scepter also argues that not only has it suffered antitrust injury, but it is at risk for future injury—being driven from the 
marketplace due to the pending patent enforcement litigation—and is thus still entitled to injunctive relief. Doc. 378 at 19. This 
argument merely reiterates Scepter's arguments that it has already been injured and moves them to a different timeframe. Even 
if the Court were to consider this new argument, this Court has held that the current patent-enforcement litigation is not an 
antitrust injury under Noerr-Pennington. Thus, future injury stemming from the litigation is not a risk of irreparable harm that the 
antitrust laws were designed to prevent."
543,7," Scepter's allegations are especially lacking with regards to GenNx360. Scepter has failed to articulate why GenNx360 is a 
necessary party for it to obtain equitable relief. Courts have been very reluctant to order post-merger divestiture at the behest of 
a private plaintiff. And even if the Court were to find that relief necessary, Scepter has pleaded no facts to show why the 
necessary divestiture would be Midwest Can from Argand rather than No Spill from GenNx/MWC and Argand. Scepter's own 
plea for relief suggests divesting No Spill from Antitrust Defendants rather than divesting Midwest Can. Doc. 317 at 77. "
544,," Therefore, the Court holds in the alternative that Scepter fails to state a Clayton Act claim against GenNx360 for this additional 
reason. "
546,8," Scepter tries to allege the licensing agreement ""set the floor for royalty rates for other industry participants."" Doc. 317 at 56. 
This statement is contradicted by the language of the agreement. Doc. 274-1 at 6. Therefore, Scepter has not properly alleged 
that the licensing agreement set a floor for the industry. GFF Corp, 130 F.3d at 1385 (""[F]actual allegations that contradict such a 
properly considered document are not well-pleaded facts that the court must accept as true."")."
546,9, The Court need not address Antitrust Defendants' other alternative arguments because it grants their motions.
546,10," Scepter tries to assert new facts in its opposition to dismissal, and it makes multiple requests in passing for leave to amend. 
See, e.g., Doc. 378 at 25 n.16, 43. The Court denies these requests for two reasons. First, this is not the proper way to seek 
amendment under the local rules. Scepter declined to amend its counterclaims as a matter of right within 21 days of Antitrust 
Defendants moving to dismiss under Rule 12(b). See Sinclair Wyo. Ref. Co. v. A & B Builders, Ltd., 989 F.3d 747, 777 (10th Cir. 
2021) (""[C]ounterclaims are distinct from other parts of an answer.""); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). Instead, Scepter chose to 
stand on its counterclaims as filed. Furthermore, under District of Kansas Rule 15.1, a party seeking leave to amend must so 
move by (1) setting forth a concise statement of the amendment or leave sought; (2) attaching the proposed pleading or other 
document; and (3) complying with the other requirements of District of Kansas Rules 7.1 through 7.6. D. Kan. R. 15.1. Scepter 
has failed to do that. Scepter is a sophisticated party and does not have any excuse for failing to comply with the Court's rules. 
Rewarding this half-hearted method of amendment would promote a ""wait-and-see"" approach to dispositive motion practice and 
converts the motions to dismiss into a trial [*32]  run. Second, even considering the plethora of new facts asserted throughout 
Scepter's opposition to dismissal, the Court has determined that adding such facts would not change its determination as to 
antitrust injury because the only facts relevant to antitrust injury are awareness of current and forthcoming safety standards and 
participation in a private standards-setting process. There is no allegation of misconduct. Thus, this case is still unlike Hynix. 527 
F. Supp. 2d at 1098. Therefore, amendment would be futile even if Scepter had complied with the rules. Grossman v. Novell, 
Inc., 120 F.3d 1112, 1126 (10th Cir. 1997) (citations omitted). "

existence of common question with respect to Title VII claims because they ""provide[d] no convincing proof of a company-wide 
discriminatory pay and promotion policy""); where the damages evidence was not consistent with the plaintiffs' theory of liability, 
see Comcast, 569 U.S. at 35 (holding that at the class certification stage, ""any model supporting a plaintiff's damages case must 
be consistent with its liability case""); where the evidence contained unsupported assumptions, see In re New Motor Vehicles 
Canadian Exp. Antitrust Litig., 522 F.3d 6, 29 (1st Cir. 2008) (criticizing the unsupported assumption that, absent the defendants' 
anti-competitive conduct, there would have been an influx of cars from Canada to United States sufficient to substantially 
decrease national prices); or where the evidence demonstrated nonsensical results such as false positives, i.e., injury to class 
members who could not logically have been injured by a defendant's conduct, see In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust 
Litig.-MDL No. 1869 (Rail Freight I), 725 F.3d 244, 252-55 , 406 U.S. App. D.C. 371(D.C. Cir. 2013) (vacating a certification 
order where the plaintiffs' expert evidence predicted that certain plaintiffs had been injured by a price-fixing conspiracy even 
though they operated under fixed-price contracts and were not exposed to overcharges caused by the conspiracy)."

565,11," Senne v. Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp. referenced Tyson Foods's rule that a district court may deny the use of 
admissible expert evidence to meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) only if ""'no reasonable juror' could find it probative of 
whether an element of liability was met,"" and then stated in passing that ""Tyson expressly cautioned that this rule should be read 
narrowly and not assumed to apply outside of the wage and hour context."" 934 F.3d 918, 947 & n.27 (9th Cir. 2019) (citing 
Tyson Foods, 577 U.S. at 459-60). But Tyson Foods contains no such limitation; rather, it declined to adopt ""broad and 
categorical rules governing the use of representative and statistical evidence in class actions,"" and indicated that district courts 
should evaluate the sufficiency of plaintiffs' evidence on a case-by-case basis, depending on the purpose for which the expert 
evidence is being introduced and the underlying cause of action. 577 U.S. at 459-60. Accordingly, we disapprove this dictum in 
Senne, 934 F.3d at 947 n.27. "
566,12," Because the Supreme Court has clarified that ""[e]very class member must have Article III standing in order to recover 
individual damages,"" TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2208, 210 L. Ed. 2d 568 (2021), Rule 23 also requires a 
district court to determine whether individualized inquiries into this standing issue would predominate over common questions, 
see Cordoba, 942 F.3d at 1277."
566,13," The dissent focuses on policy reasons why district courts should refrain from certifying classes that may include more than a 
de minimis number of uninjured class members. Dissent at 64, 75, 77-78. But we are bound to apply Rule 23(b)(3) as written, 
regardless of policy preferences. And contrary to the dissent's assertion, our conclusion that courts must apply Rule 23(b)(3) on 
a case-by-case basis, rather than rely on a per se rule that a class cannot be certified if it includes more than a de minimis 
number of uninjured class members, is consistent with the approach taken by our sister circuits. Dissent at 78. Neither of the two 
cases cited by the dissent, In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig.-MDL No. 1869 (Rail Freight II), 934 F.3d 619, 443 
U.S. App. D.C. (D.C. Cir. 2019) and In re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d 42 (1st Cir. 2018), adopted a per se rule. Rather, 
based on the particular facts of the cases before them, our sister circuits held that Rule 23(b)(3)'s predominance requirement is 
not satisfied when the need to identify uninjured class members ""will predominate and render an adjudication unmanageable."" In 
re Asacol Antitrust Litig., 907 F.3d at 53-54; see also Rail Freight II, 934 F.3d at 625 (holding that a district court did not abuse its 
discretion in denying class certification where the plaintiffs ""proposed no further way—short of full-blown, individual trials"" to 
determine the common question of whether class members were injured)."
566,14," Nevertheless, a court must consider whether the possible presence of uninjured class members means that the class 
definition is fatally overbroad. When ""a class is defined so broadly as to include a great number of members who for some 
reason could not have been harmed by the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct, the class is defined too broadly to permit 
certification."" Messner, 669 F.3d at 824; see also Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581, 596 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding 
that the class definition in a false advertising action was fatally overbroad where many members learned that the advertising was 
misleading before purchase or had never been exposed to the allegedly misleading advertisements); In re Asacol, 907 F.3d at 
55-58 (holding that the class did not meet Rule 23(b)(3) requirements because the plaintiffs' evidence showed that thousands of 
plaintiffs who were loyal to brand-name drugs would not have purchased the generic drugs that were the subject of the price-
fixing conspiracy). In such a case, the court may redefine the overbroad class to include only those members who can rely on 
the same body of common evidence to establish the common issue. See, e.g., Mazza, 666 F.3d at 596 (holding that false 
advertising ""class must be defined in such a way as to include only members who were exposed to advertising that is alleged to 
be materially misleading""). A court may not, however, create a ""fail safe"" class that is defined to include only those individuals 
who were injured by the allegedly unlawful conduct. See Ruiz Torres, 835 F.3d at 1138 n.7 (internal quotation marks omitted). 
""Such a class definition is improper because a class member either wins or, by virtue of losing, is defined out of the class and is 
therefore not bound by the judgment."" Messner, 669 F.3d at 825. But, ultimately, the problem of a potentially ""over-inclusive"" "
567,," class ""can and often should be solved by refining the class definition rather than by flatly denying class certification on that 
basis."" Id."
567,15," Econometrics is ""the application of statistical methods to economic data . . . to draw inferences about economic relationships

568,16," The dissent argues that Dr. Mangum's opinion is not persuasive because large retailers have bargaining power and can 
extract price discounts, promotional credits, and rebates. Dissent at 72-73. As the dissent concedes, Dissent at 73 & n. 5, Dr. 
Mangum took these issues into account (to the extent that the Tuna Suppliers provided relevant data). After doing so, Dr. 
Mangum ran the regression model using both gross and net prices and determined that his regression model continued to 
produce a statistically significant overcharge. Dr. Mangum therefore reasoned that discounts and promotions did not affect his 
pooled model or his conclusion of class-wide impact. Although the dissent argues that (in the dissent's view) Dr. Mangum did not 
consider price discounts, promotional credits, and rebates ""adequately,"" Dissent at 73 & n. 5, the persuasiveness of Dr. 
Mangum's analysis is not at issue at this phase of the proceeding."
568,17," Direct purchasers were grouped into categories called customer types, which included Retail, Club, Special Market, Food 
Service, Mass Merchandise, Discount, and e-Commerce."
568,18," According to Dr. Mangum, the purpose of this robustness test was to demonstrate that his regression model was sound. 
Contrary to the dissent's assertion, Dissent at 66, Dr. Mangum did not ""suggest"" that 5.5 percent of the class were uninjured. 
Rather, Dr. Mangum concluded that each class member was injured by supra-competitive prices, and used a different 
methodology for calculating damages for each member of the class. See infra at n.19. The Tuna Suppliers do not develop the 
argument that the results of this robustness test preclude certification of the class as currently defined. Therefore, we do not "
569,," address this issue here. See United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 140 S. Ct. 1575, 1578, 206 L. Ed. 2d 866 (2020); see also Tyson 
Foods, 577 U.S. at 460 (declining to reach a similar issue)."
569,19," Although the regression model primarily served as evidence of class-wide antitrust impact, Dr. Mangum used the overcharge 
derived from the regression model to estimate class-wide damages. This estimate was developed by multiplying the overcharge 
estimate of 10.28 percent by the appropriate sales volume for the defendants, adjusted by several pertinent factors. Dr. Mangum 
used the same method to estimate damages for each of the class representatives identified in the complaint. The Tuna 
Suppliers do not challenge Dr. Mangum's damages methodology. Thus, the dissent's contention that the court has created a 
""sweeping rule that gives a free pass to the intractable problem of highly individualized damages analyses"" misses the mark. 
Dissent at 74."
569,20," A Chow test is a statistical test designed to ""determine whether it is appropriate to pool potential subgroups when estimating 
the average effect of the alleged conspiracy."" Econometrics at 358."
569,21," Dr. Johnson's test attempted to show that Dr. Mangum's model was flawed because 169 direct purchasers could not rely on 
the model to show antitrust impact due to the fact (as Dr. Mangum subsequently explained) that some purchasers had no or too 
few transactions during the pre-collusion benchmark period to generate statistically significant results. Contrary to the dissent's 
claim, Dissent at 66, Dr. Johnson did not show that 28 percent of the class potentially suffered no injury. See infra Section IV.B. "
571,22," The Tuna Suppliers do not challenge the district court's gatekeeping function under Daubert, to ensure that Dr. Mangum's 
evidence was not ""statistically inadequate or based on implausible assumptions."" Tyson Foods, 577 U.S. at 459. And contrary to 
the dissent's argument, Dissent at 69, the district court did not merely determine that Dr. Mangum's evidence was admissible 
under Daubert. Rather, it subjected the evidence to a rigorous examination with full consideration of Dr. Johnson's critique. 
Therefore, the dissent's assertion that the district court committed the same error as the district court in Ellis is misplaced. 
Dissent at 68-69. "
572,23," See, e.g., Kleen Prods. LLC v. Int'l Paper Co., 831 F.3d 919, 929 (7th Cir. 2016); In re Urethane, 768 F.3d at 1263; Cordes & 
Co. Fin. Servs. v. A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc., 502 F.3d 91, 97, 107 (2d Cir. 2007); Hemmings v. Tidyman's Inc., 285 F.3d 1174, 
1188-89 (9th Cir. 2002); In re Linerboard Antitrust Litig., 305 F.3d 145, 153 (3d Cir. 2002)."
572,24," Although the Tuna Suppliers refer to Dr. Mangum's regression model as ""representative evidence,"" that term is imprecise. As 
explained in Tyson Foods, representative evidence generally refers to a sample that represents the class as a whole. See 577 
U.S. at 454-55. Thus, Tyson Foods concluded that each individual in a class could rely on exemplars of persons donning and 
doffing protective equipment to prove the amount of time each spent donning and doffing; this sample was claimed to be 
representative of all members of the class. See id. By contrast, a regression model analyzes available data to determine the 
degree to which a known variable, such as collusion, affected an unknown variable, such as price, while eliminating the effect of 
other variables."
572,25," To the extent the Tuna Suppliers challenged the model's inputs, the district court considered and rejected Dr. Johnson's 
critique that some of the model's inputs (i.e., the use of a cost index and Dr. Mangum's selection of time periods) rendered the 
model incapable of demonstrating class-wide impact. Cf. In re Lamictal, 957 F.3d at 194 (holding that the district court abused its 
discretion in certifying class because it failed to scrutinize each expert's data). "
573,26," As a threshold matter, the First Circuit held in New Motor Vehicles that the district court lacked federal jurisdiction over the 
plaintiffs' claims, but went on to provide its thoughts on certification of the class in the event the district court exercised its 
discretion to exert supplemental jurisdiction over the state damages claims. 522 F.3d at 17. "
574,27," The Tuna Suppliers do not ""specifically and distinctly"" raise the argument that the district court abused its discretion in 
resolving challenges to the inputs to the model which were raised below, such as Dr. Mangum's choice of benchmark period and 
use of cost indexes, so that argument is deemed forfeited on appeal. United States v. Kama, 394 F.3d 1236, 1238 (9th Cir. 
2005)."
574,28," Because the Tuna Suppliers' primary argument on appeal is that the DPPs failed to prove class-wide antitrust impact, we 
understand the Tuna Suppliers' reference to injury as referring to antitrust impact, an element of the class antitrust claims, not 
that the class members would not be able to prove that they suffered monetary damages. "
575,29," The Tuna Suppliers do not ""specifically and distinctly"" develop the argument that the district court failed to resolve the parties' 
dispute as to whether the evidence generated false positives. Kama, 394 F.3d at 1238. In any event, as explained above, Dr. 
Mangum rebutted these critiques by reference to the umbrella effect, and by claiming that Dr. Johnson's analysis was itself 
flawed because Dr. Johnson thought DPP class members had purchased non-defendant tuna, when they actually purchased 
tuna supplied by defendants. The district court did not abuse its discretion in resolving this issue by crediting Dr. Mangum's 
rebuttal."
575,30," Although Dr. Johnson argued that Dr. Mangum's pooled regression model was unreliable and so could not sustain a jury 
finding of antitrust injury to the entire DPP class, the evidence adduced at trial may nevertheless sustain a jury finding of antitrust 
injury to all or part of the class."
575,31," In any event, Dr. Mangum's proposal for calculating damages is a straightforward process of applying the class-wide 
overcharge to the Tuna Purchasers' net sales records. See supra n.19. That proposal does not give rise to a concern about 
individualized mini-trials to determine each class member's damage award. HN27[

off the occasional class member here or there through individualized rebuttal does not cause individual questions to 
predominate."" Halliburton, 573 U.S. at 276."

] The Supreme Court expressly held open the question ""whether every class member must demonstrate standing 
before a court certifies a class."" TransUnion, 141 S.Ct. at 2208 n.4 (emphasis omitted). Outside the class action context, the 
Supreme Court has held that each plaintiff must demonstrate Article III standing in order to seek additional money damages and, "
576,," therefore, a litigant must demonstrate Article III standing in order to intervene as a matter of right. Town of Chester v. Laroe 
Ests., Inc., 137 S.Ct. 1645, 1651, 198 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2017). But the Supreme Court has long recognized that in cases seeking 
injunctive or declaratory relief, only one plaintiff need demonstrate standing to satisfy Article III. See, e.g., Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 
U.S. 360, 366 n.5, 84 S. Ct. 1316, 12 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1964); Rumsfeld v. F. for Acad. & Institutional Rts., Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52

(2009). We have likewise applied this rule where a class sought injunctive or equitable relief. See Bates v. United Parcel Serv., 
Inc., 511 F.3d 974, 985 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc). HN30[
] We therefore overrule the statement in Mazza that ""no class may be certified that contains members lacking Article III standing,"" 666 F.3d at 594, which does not apply when a court is certifying a 
class seeking injunctive or other equitable relief. We do not overrule Mazza as to any other holding which remain good law. "

Moreover, it is not clear whether the activity identified is compensable, as courts apply a three-step inquiry to determine whether 
an activity should be compensated under the FLSA. See Alvarez v. IBP, Inc., 339 F.3d 894, 902-03 (9th Cir. 2003); see also

considers: ""(1) whether the activity constituted 'work,' (2) whether the activity was an 'integral and indispensable' duty, and (3)

of Mesa, 598 F.3d 1217, 1224 (9th Cir. 2010)). Importantly, courts determined donning and doffing protective gear may take a 
de minimus amount of time. See, e.g., Alvarez, 339 F.3d at 903-904 (""time spent donning and doffing non-unique protective gear 
such as hardhats and safety goggles is not compensable"" under the FLSA because ""[t]he time it takes perform these tasks vis-a-

694,7," Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits ""[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade or commerce."" 15 U.S.C. § 1. "
696,8," The parties dispute whether this case is a per se antitrust violation or if the Court should adopt a ""rule of reason"" approach. 
Plaintiffs contend this is a per se case and argue that those types of antitrust cases are routinely certified as class actions. 
Defendants argues this is not a per se case and that the rule of reason should apply. Neither party discusses how this analysis 
would impact class certification other than Plaintiffs claiming per se cases are routinely certified. ""When a restraint's negative impact on competition is immediately discernable and the restraint has no redeeming virtue, the per 
se mode of analysis applies."" Craftsmen Limousine, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 363 F.3d 761, 773 (8th Cir. 2004). ""The per se mode 
of analysis applies a conclusive presumption of illegality."" Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted). Under the rule of reason, 
""the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition, taking into 
account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint 
was imposed, and the restraint's history, nature, and effect."" Id. at 772-73. The Court notes that discovery is still ongoing in this case and thus it is premature to make this determination. Regardless of 
whether the per se rule or rule of reason applies, the Court finds class certification is appropriate. "
697,9," Defendants do not directly argue the Rule 23(a)(2) commonality requirement, but instead focuses their arguments on whether 
common questions predominate under Rule 23(b)(3). The Court will address these issues in more detail when analyzing the 
predominance element. "
698,10," Defendants' arguments are targeted specifically at the antitrust classes. For the same reasons discussed in this section, the 
Court finds Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the members of the MMPA Class."
698,11," Defendants do not dispute, and the Court finds, that Plaintiffs are represented by qualified counsel. "
699,12," Defendants also argue that Plaintiff Ryan Hendrickson (""Hendrickson"") is not a member of the class he purports to represent. 
Defendants contend that Hendrickson's brokerage ""is not affiliated with Keller Williams"" or any other Corporate Defendant and 
thus he is not an adequate class representative. (Doc. #553, p. 83.) Plaintiffs in response attach emails between Hendrickson 
and his brokerage which show that, at the very least, the brokerage represented to Hendrickson that it was a Keller Williams 
affiliate. At this stage of the litigation, the Court need not determine the actual affiliation of Hendrickson's brokerage. Defendants 
do not dispute that another named plaintiff, Jeremy Keel, used a Keller Williams affiliated brokerage and all Corporate 
Defendants are otherwise represented by a named plaintiff. "
700,13," Again, the parties' arguments appear to be targeted specifically at the Subject MLS and Missouri Antitrust Law-Subject MLS 
classes, not the MMPA Class. For the same reasons discussed above, the Court finds Plaintiffs have established the adequacy 
requirement for the MMPA Class. "
702,14," The Court previously determined that Dr. Schulman's opinions satisfy the Daubert admissibility requirement at the April 18, 
2022, oral arguments on Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification. (Doc. #733.) The Court's analysis in this section is focused on 
whether Plaintiffs, in part through the opinions of Dr. Schulman, can meet the Rule 23(b)(3) predominance inquiry regarding 
antitrust impact. "
704,15," Defendants also argue that a lack of de minimus offers, that is, buyer broker compensation offers that are very low, such as 
one cent, which would technically comply with the Challenged Rules, proves that sellers are responding to individual market 
forces other than the Challenged Rules. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the lack of de minimus offers could also prove that 
the Challenged Rules result in uniform commission rates to prevent steering, or that Defendants train their agents to use the 
threat of steering to persuade sellers to not make low offers. A jury may disagree, but the lack of de minimus offers does not 
defeat the predominance inquiry."
704,16," For the same reasons, the Court rejects Defendants arguments that Dr. Schulman ignores these supposed individualized 
incentives in his impact analysis. "
706,17," Defendants also argue that both Blades, 400 F.3d 562, and Nichols v. Mobile Board of Realtors, Inc., 675 F.2d 671 (5th Cir. 
1982) preclude class certification. Upon review of these cases, and for the reasons stated above, the Court disagrees and finds 
class certification is appropriate in this case. "
707,18," The ""Cooperative Compensation Rule"" refers to Section 2-G-1 of the NAR Handbook."
707,19," Defendants contend Dr. Schulman does not account for transactions that would have included offers of compensation in the 
but-for world or account for other market adjustments. The Court rejects this argument for the same reasons it rejected this 
argument regarding classwide impact. Plaintiffs' damages model is consistent with their impact theory, which is that buyer 
brokers only exist because of the Challenged Rules. If buyers had to pay, they would only do so in outlier circumstances, and 
would otherwise not use them. "
712,1, The facts described below are taken from the factual allegations in the Complaint.
712,2," The Court understands the term ""servicer"" to be a reference to the company that typically collects interest, principal, and 
escrow payments from a borrower of a loan."
712,3," The Court understands the term ""underwater"" to be a reference to a situation in which a borrower owes more on a loan than 
the property securing the loan is worth."
712,4," The Court understands the term ""unsecured"" to be a reference to a situation in which a borrower owes more on a loan than the 
property securing the loan is worth and, as a result, the property is no longer sufficient to secure the loan."
712,5," The Court understands the term ""foreclosure trustee"" to be a reference to the entity appointed to move a nonjudicial foreclosure 
process forward."
712,6," Although not stated explicitly, the Court understands that ADS may not have been the original trustee. "
714,7," The Novobilskis, in their Opposition, request that the Court issue a preliminary injunction. An opposition brief to a Motion to 
Dismiss is not the proper place to submit a request for a preliminary injunction. The Court advises any parties wishing to submit 
a request for a preliminary injunction to do so in a separate application or motion in compliance with C.D. Cal. L.R. 65-1."
714,8," Although SLS requests that this Court dismiss the entire case with prejudice, Reply at 6, SLS has failed to show why the 
general presumption in favor of leave to amend should not prevail in this case. For that reason, the Court grants the Novobilski's 
leave to amend with respect to all of their dismissed claims. "
719,9," The Court notes that the Novobilskis' Opposition does not discuss their negligent misrepresentation claim, which is an 
additional ground upon which to grant the Motion with respect to this claim. See C.D. Cal. L.R. 7-12; Walsh v. Nev. Dep't of 
Human Res., 471 F.3d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir. 2006) (concluding that plaintiff who failed to address issues raised in a defendant's 
motion to dismiss in his opposition brief ""has effectively abandoned his claim""). "

] A per se restraint is one that almost always tends to restrict competition. In other words, it has a manifest

invalidate it. Leegin Creative Leather Prods., Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U.S. 877, 885-87, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623

differs from any finding made in connection with class action certification, the ultimate factfinder's finding on the merits will 
govern the judgment."
751,6," While undefined by WOGCC rules, the Court understands ""the API number"" to refer to the American Petroleum Institute 
number, which is used as a unique identifying number for wells in the United States. That number is then used by the WOGCC 
to identify and track an oil and gas well that is described by location in the APD. "
752,7," The reference to the rule in the policy statement is confusing as the rule applicable before (and after) the 2019 rule change 
does not say what the policy statement represents."
752,8," The WOGCC defines ""Horizontal Well"" to mean ""a wellbore drilled laterally at an angle of at least eighty degrees (80°) to the

758,17," Anadarko relies in part on Comcast Corp., 569 U.S. 27. For the same reasons explained by the Tenth Circuit in the case In re 
Urethane Antitrust Litigation, 768 F.3d 1245, 1257-1258 (10th Cir. 2014), this Court concludes that Comcast does not control the 
resolution of the antitrust impact issue in this case."
758,18," These ""highly variable issues"" include: (1) the fact that the eastern portion was considered to be generally less proven and is 
far from developed minerals and lacks the necessary infrastructure; (2) variability in information and indications that the eastern 
section was not capable of being produced economically (e.g., formation thickness and water saturation); (3) operator variability 
including who had the right to drill particular Class Minerals and what ""operating paradigms"" and ""economic hurdles"" existed 
which would affect different operators differently; (4) variability as to the surrounding 30% royalty leases; and (5) variability of 
observed leasing outcomes. Doc. 190, pp. 26 - 34; Doc. 191-1, 190-2 & 190-3. The variables are also illustrated by maps shown 
in Doc. 212, p. 9."

S. Ct at 1049 (comparing class certification standards to standards for summary judgment and directed verdict). That does not 
appear to be the case on the current record, and any arguments that Plaintiffs' evidence fails to prove some elements required 
to show antitrust violation or antitrust impact can be addressed at summary judgment or at trial. "
760,20," A map of the Class Minerals owned by the class can be found in Doc. 212, p. 6. "
762,1," For reference, see MANUAL FOR COMPLEX LITIGATION FOURTH, Federal Judicial Center 2004, § 21.311. "
775,1," The lawfulness of this provision lies at the heart of Pacific Steel's federal Sherman Act claims. Going forward, the Court will 
refer to it as either the ""CMC-Danieli Exclusivity Provision"" or simply the ""Exclusivity Provision."" "
777,2," In support of its motion, CMC asks the Court to take judicial notice of Exhibit A, which is FABco, LLC's Original Verified Petition 
and Application for Temporary Restraining Order and Temporary and Permanent Injunctions, and supporting Affidavits, filed in 
the 101st Judicial District Court of Dallas County, Texas on August 4, 2016. See Dkt. No. 80. Pacific Steel has not opposed this 
request. The Court finds Exhibit A judicially noticeable because it is a matter of public record whose authenticity is not in dispute. 
See Harris v. Cty. of Orange, 682 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir. 2012). The Court takes notice of the existence of the document and 
the allegations made in it, but does not presume that those allegations are true. "
779,3," While the Complaint calculated CMC's market share as the percentage of rebar sales, the Amended Complaint now calculates 
market share as the percentage of rebar production capacity. See id. ¶ 131 (""CMC accounts for over 85% of the rebar produced 
from within the relevant geographic market[.]""). Pacific Steel contends that this change is immaterial because the relevant 
suppliers' sales and production capacity should be nearly identical. See Dkt. No. 91 (""In this case, the -- the sales and the 
production capacity are identical.""). This is because when you define a market based on the location of the relevant suppliers, all 
sales made by suppliers are counted regardless of the location of the customer making the purchase. See Merger Guidelines § 
4.2.2; see also id. (""Competitors in the market are firms with relevant production, sales, or service facilities in that region.) 
(emphasis added). The Court finds this factual allegation plausible and will analyze sales and production capacity 
interchangeably at this stage in the litigation. "
783,4," Pacific Steel appears to renew its argument that the per se rule should apply because the Exclusivity Provision is ""facially and 
nakedly exclusionary."" Opp. at 7-8. Its position is preserved for appeal, but nothing in its brief persuades the Court to revisit this 
issue. "
785,5," See Cascade Health Sols. v. PeaceHealth, 515 F.3d 883, 894 (9th Cir. 2008) (addressing ""bundling,"" which is when a firm 
sells a bundle of goods or services for a lower price than the seller charges for the goods or services purchased individually); 
Forsyth v. Humana, Inc., 114 F.3d 1467 (9th Cir. 1997) (insurance policy holders alleged that their insurer engaged in a ""classic 
kickback scheme"" with a third-party hospital, under which the insurer clandestinely negotiated a discount for its portion of the 
hospital charges incurred by its insureds but failed to pass along the savings in violation of the underlying health insurance 
policy)."
785,6," The Court is aware that the Eleventh Circuit has said that ""an exclusive dealing arrangement can be harmful when it allows a 
monopolist to maintain its monopoly power by raising its rivals' costs sufficiently to prevent them from growing into effective 
competitors."" McWane, Inc. v. F.T.C., 783 F.3d 814, 832 (11th Cir. 2015). Even assuming courts in this Circuit would find that "
786,," theory persuasive, and to the extent Pacific Steel seeks to advance it here, the Court notes that, for practical and evidentiary 
purposes, there is little (if any) daylight between whether the Exclusivity Provision (a) raises costs sufficient to prevent CMC's 
rivals from growing into effective competitors in the rebar manufacturing market; and (b) forecloses competition or entry into the 
rebar manufacturing market."
786,7," The Supreme Court has explained that market power is the ability to raise prices above those that would be charged in a 
competitive market, while monopoly power is the power to control prices or exclude competition. See NCAA v. Bd. of Regents of 
the Univ. of Oklahoma, 468 U.S. 85, 109 n.38, 104 S. Ct. 2948, 82 L. Ed. 2d 70 (1984); United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 
563, 571, 86 S. Ct. 1698, 1704, 16 L. Ed. 2d 778 (1966). The difference between the two is a matter of degree. Monopoly power 
under § 2 requires ""something greater"" than market power under § 1, and courts have described the distinction as ""substantial"" 
market power or an ""extreme degree"" of market power. See Epic Games, Inc., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172303, 2021 WL 
4128925, at *92 (collecting cases)."

share of 87% ""leaves no doubt"" that the defendants have monopoly power); Syufy Enterprises v. Am. Multicinema, Inc., 793 
F.2d 990, 996 (9th Cir. 1986) (finding market share of 60-69%, when coupled with other evidence of additional factors, adequate 
to support a jury determination of monopoly power); Epic Games, Inc., 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 172303, 2021 WL 4128925, at *93

787,10," The Court is of the view that a plaintiff seeking to establish a violation of the ""below-cost"" and ""loss leader"" sales provisions of

798,1," This account is based entirely on the allegations in PLS's complaint, which we must accept as true at this stage of the litigation. 
Ellis v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement & Power Dist., 24 F.4th 1262, 1266 (9th Cir. 2022). The complaint distinguishes 
between real estate ""agents"" and ""brokers,"" and uses the term ""real estate professional"" to refer to both collectively. Because 
this distinction does not affect our analysis, we use the term ""agent"" to refer to agents and brokers collectively. "
799,2," For example, PLS cites to this part of the complaint and states that ""competition from listing networks such as PLS that 
competed with the MLSs was eliminated."" In its reply brief, PLS argues that ""the graveyard of the MLS Defendants' former direct 
competitors—like PLS and the Top Agent Network—proves that Clear Cooperation actually succeeded at having [the] practical 
effect"" of ""driving those competitors out of business."""
799,3," PLS's claim is brought via the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 15, which provides a private right of action for enforcing the Sherman 
Act and other federal antitrust laws. "
802,4," PLS also argues that the Policy is an agreement to restrict output. Because we conclude that PLS adequately alleged a 
violation of the Sherman Act through its group boycott theory, we decline to address its alternative theory. "
803,5," Defendants do not seriously dispute that PLS has adequately alleged that they have market power. Defendants' only argument 
regarding market power is a single line in NAR's brief, which states: ""PLS's hazy, speculative allegations about market share do 
not plead the necessary evidentiary facts to support its claims about market power.'"" (Citation and quotation marks omitted). But 
NAR never explains why it believes PLS's allegations are inadequate, and ""a bare assertion does not preserve a claim, 
particularly when, as here, a host of other issues are presented for review."" Greenwood v. F.A.A., 28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.

newspaper advertising behaves much like a one-sided market and should be analyzed as such."" Id. "
805,7," In Amex, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs were required to define the relevant market even though they relied on 
direct evidence of an anticompetitive impact. See Amex, 138 S. Ct. at 2285 n.7. But the Court distinguished Amex, where the 
plaintiff complained of a vertical restraint of trade, from cases like this one, where the plaintiff complains of a horizontal restraint 
of trade. Id. Therefore, Amex did not disturb the Indiana Federation of Dentists rule. "
807,8," Rule 3(c)(1)(B) was amended in April 2021 to eliminate the ""or part thereof"" language because the advisory committee 
concluded that it contributed to ""the misconception that it is necessary or appropriate to designate each and every order of the 
district court that the appellant may wish to challenge on appeal"" rather than simply designating the judgment into which all of 
the district court's orders merge. Fed. R. App. P. 3(c) advisory committee's note to 2021 amendment. We quote the former language because the 2021 
amendment did not become effective until several months after PLS filed its notice of appeal. "
811,1," In a previous Memorandum Opinion, the Court outlined Plaintiffs' allegations against ROSS. See Thomson Reuters Enter. Ctr. 
GmbH v. ROSS Intel. Inc., 529 F. Supp. 3d 303, 307-10 (D. Del. 2021). That background is not repeated here, as the instant 
Memorandum Opinion focuses on ROSS's allegations against Plaintiffs."
811,2," The factual allegations in this section are taken primarily from ROSS's amended counterclaims and the parties' papers. At this 
stage, the Court must take ROSS's well-pled factual allegations as true. "
812,3," The Court denied the first motion to dismiss as moot, in light of subsequent filings. (See generally D.I. 160) "
813,4," The Court will address the two theories ROSS is pressing in connection with its § 2 claim. ROSS clarified in its briefing that it is 
not relying on the ""essential facilities doctrine"" (D.I. 38 at 2), and at the hearing, ROSS withdrew its ""refusal to deal"" claim (Tr. at 
43). ROSS had been pursuing a claim based on Plaintiffs' refusal to deal with ROSS. (See D.I. 38 at 17-19) (citing Aspen Skiing 
Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585, 105 S. Ct. 2847, 86 L. Ed. 2d 467 (1985)). The Court will dismiss that claim 
in light of ROSS's withdrawal of it. "
817,5," The Court need not and does not reach the issue of whether ROSS's allegations of copyright misuse would be sufficient to 
prevent the dismissal of Count VIII if the Court were to dismiss the federal antitrust claims. (See D.I. 38 at 19) "
823,1," The company's identity has since been publicly revealed as PepsiCo. While PepsiCo is not a party here, MarketPlace alleged 
""an exclusive third-party beverage company"" as one co-conspirator for the Section 1 conspiracy claim."
823,2, Host does not appeal the District Court's decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction over a third claim for tortious interference.

824,4," About four decades ago, around 100 years after the Sherman Act became law, the Supreme Court ""observed, the lower federal 
courts have been 'virtually unanimous in concluding that Congress did not intend the antitrust laws to provide a remedy in 
damages for all injuries that might conceivably be traced to an antitrust violation.'"" Associated Gen. Contractors v. Cal. State 
Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 534, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) (""AGC"") (quoting Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., 
405 U.S. 251, 263 n.14, 92 S. Ct. 885, 31 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972)). But that conclusion ""is inferred largely from the perception that 
the courts construing Section 7 between 1890 and 1914 perceived such a congressional intention and implemented it."" John F. 
Hart, Standing Doctrine in Antitrust Damage Suits, 1890-1975: Statutory Exegesis, Innovation, and the Influence of Doctrinal 
History, 59 Tenn. L. Rev. 191, 255-56 (1992). So too with Section 4 of the Clayton Act's direct-injury rule, which ""depends in turn 
on the proposition that the courts had adopted such a restriction between 1890 and 1914."" Id. In other words, because courts 
began to stray from the ordinary best meaning of the statutes, the courts concluded their preferred reading reflected the bills 
passed by Congress and signed into law."
824,5," A theory often ""stated elliptically and without analytical precision,"" meaning ""[m]any of the cases cannot be reconciled."" A. 
Douglas Melamed et al., Antitrust Law and Trade Regulation: Cases and Materials 1173 (7th ed. 2018). Leaving us with ""a 
murky and mushy analytical framework for . . . the standing of a private antitrust plaintiff."" Stephen D. Susman, Standing in 
Private Antitrust Cases: Where is the Supreme Court Going?, 52 Antitrust L.J. 465, 467 (1983). But see Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. 
Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 126-28, 134 S. Ct. 1377, 188 L. Ed. 2d 392 (2014) (In AGC, ""we sought to 
'ascertain,' as a matter of statutory interpretation, the 'scope of the private remedy created by' Congress in § 4 of the Clayton Act 
. . . . Later decisions confirm that [AGC] rested on statutory, not 'prudential,' considerations."" (quoting AGC, 459 U.S. at 529)). "
825,6," Determining when to dive into this analysis is similarly murky. Compare Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Vill. Supermarkets, Inc., 
806 F.3d 162, 171 (3d Cir. 2015) (""We begin with antitrust standing.""), with Lifewatch Servs. Inc. v. Highmark Inc., 902 F.3d 323, 
341 (3d Cir. 2018) (addressing antitrust standing after addressing the pled antitrust violation). But rather than getting lost, courts 
often ""assume the existence of a violation and then ask whether the . . . standing elements are shown."" Phillip E. Areeda & 
Herbert Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application, ¶ 335f (4th ed. 2014). And 
because we can dismiss solely for lack of antitrust standing, we begin there. See W. Penn, 147 F.3d at 269 (affirming the district 
court's dismissal for lack of antitrust standing)."

U.S. 398, 409, 124 S. Ct. 872, 157 L. Ed. 2d 823 (2004) (citing Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U.S. 585,

826,8," Host's speculations do not alter that conclusion. The Complaint references, anecdotally, that a pouring rights agreement ""at 
one airport, . . . resulted in the exclusion of three of four premium brands of bottled water."" (App. at 21). And ""[i]n another market 
study, 17% of respondents indicated it is essential that the water they purchase be natural spring water."" (App. at 22.) Taking 
both in the light most favorable to Host, we can infer: 1) that a market study was conducted at some airport, somewhere, 
sometime; and 2) in a separate study, around 1.7 of every ten consumers—perhaps at airports, perhaps not—really liked spring 
water. We cannot infer that the quality of non-alcoholic beverages at PHL under the PRA would not be comparable. Or much 
else for that matter. "
827,9," It is telling that the same competitive bidding process that resulted in the PRA also awarded Host the two retail concession 
spaces, (App. at 24-25) a process Host agrees was competitive. (Opening Br. at 15.) Understandably, as ""[i]t is well established 
that competition among businesses to serve as an exclusive supplier should actually be encouraged."" Race Tires, 614 F.3d at 
83; see also Menasha Corp. v. News Am. Mktg. In-Store, Inc., 354 F.3d 661, 663 (7th Cir. 2004) (competition to be an exclusive 
supplier ""is a vital form of rivalry, and often the most powerful one, which the antitrust laws encourage rather than suppress."")."
827,10," Host also alleged that MarketPlace's conduct violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act because it constituted an unlawful 
restraint of trade. But because Host has not adequately alleged an antitrust injury, Host's generic Section 1 claim fails."

whether the District Court erred in not analyzing the claim under the rule of reason. "

828,13," An illegal tying scheme requires that ""the seller possesses market power in the tying product market."" Town Sound, 959 F.2d

failed to plead that MarketPlace ""forced"" Host to ""purchase"" a separate ""product,"" we need not address whether a single airport 
can constitute a geographic market. See Town Sound, 959 F.2d at 477. Federal courts are not economists, and we should avoid 
an unnecessary ""ramble through the wilds of economic theory."" United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 609 n.10, 92

insufficiently pled that the Court does not rely on it as support for the statute-of-limitations analysis. That said, the Court finds the 
pay-for-delay cases sufficiently analogous to Humana's other allegations against Celgene, and accordingly, reliance on those 
cases for the statute-of-limitations analysis is appropriate. "

864,11," For his part, Aiyer moved to exclude evidence concerning interdealer trading and his trading activity with Katz related to the

exclude"" such evidence. App'x at 330. "
865,12, The government did not call Williams to testify.
865,13," Although Aiyer does not raise Juror No. 6's other allegations on appeal, we note that he further alleged that he agreed to the 
verdict ""based solely on the intimidation of five members of the jury""; that Juror No. 3 also stated that, at one point, ""he saw the 
facial expression on the defendant and the defendant['s] brother"" and later said ""they smile now, but they [won't] be smiling at

867,14," Although the district court denied Aiyer bail, see United States v. Aiyer, 500 F. Supp. 3d 21 (S.D.N.Y. 2020), this Court granted

868,15," ""[C]oncerted action [between competitors at the same level of the market] is usually termed a 'horizontal' restraint, in 
contradistinction to combinations of persons at different levels of the market structure, e.g., manufacturers and distributors, "
869,," which are termed 'vertical' restraints."" United States v. Topco Assocs., Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 608, 92 S. Ct. 1126, 31 L. Ed. 2d 515 
(1972). "
870,16," We are unpersuaded by Aiyer's suggestion that we have previously required courts to conduct a preliminary, ""sophisticated 
economic inquiry"" to determine whether a challenged restraint is properly characterized as per se unlawful. Aiyer Br. at 35 
(quoting Volvo N. Am. Corp. v. Men's Int'l Pro. Tennis Council, 857 F.2d 55, 71-72 (2d Cir. 1988)). As a threshold matter, we 
note that Volvo was a civil case, and thus, as discussed supra, is subject to different procedures for pre-trial determinations 
regarding sufficiency of the evidence. In any event, the substance of our decision in Volvo does not conflict with our analysis 
here. In that case, plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that a professional tennis council conspired to fix compensation for 
certain professional tennis matches. 857 F.2d at 71. The district court granted defendants' motion to dismiss as to this claim. 
See id. at 62. We reversed, but noted in dicta that ""[a]ssuming . . . appellants succeed in proving the foregoing allegations, . . . 
we express no opinion at this time as to whether [defendants'] conduct should be condemned as per se unlawful or, instead, 
should be analyzed under the Rule of Reason."" Id. at 71. We further explained that it was not immediately clear that the per se 
rule should apply in the context of that case because ""professional sporting events cannot exist unless the producers of such 
events agree to cooperate with one another to a certain extent, and that the antitrust laws do not condemn such agreements 
when coordination is essential if the activity is to be carried out at all."" Id. at 71-72. As discussed below, Aiyer does not-and 
cannot-argue that his conduct was essential to the functioning of the FX market. In any event, we did not suggest in Volvo that a 
defendant is entitled to a pre-trial determination on these issues in a criminal case. "
871,17," Relatedly, this long-standing principle also renders Aiyer's argument that the government ""showed no increased prices or 
reduced supply,"" Aiyer Br. at 45, unavailing. We reiterate that, in a per se case, resulting anticompetitive effects need not be 
proved. See, e.g., Copperweld Corp. v. Indep. Tube Corp., 467 U.S. 752, 768, 104 S. Ct. 2731, 81 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1984) 
(explaining that agreements subject to the per se rule ""are thought so inherently anticompetitive that each is illegal per se without 
inquiry into the harm [they have] actually caused""). "
872,18," Although Aiyer complains that the government's interpretation of this exception incorrectly requires the existence of a formal 
joint venture, we made clear in Apple that a ""similar productive relationship"" suffices as well. Id."
872,19," Aiyer's substantial reliance on civil cases applying the ancillary restraints doctrine or joint venture-related exception to the per 
se rule is therefore misplaced. For example, in In re Sulfuric Acid Antitrust Litigation, the Seventh Circuit determined that the rule 
of reason should apply to alleged misconduct where the defendants—which were affiliate firms—entered a joint venture with 
another company to supply sulfuric acid in the United States because ""the[ir] coordination [was] ancillary to (that is, supportive 
of) the legitimate business purpose of the venture."" 703 F.3d 1004, 1013 (7th Cir. 2012); see also Med. Ctr. at Elizabeth Place, 
LLC v. Atrium Health Sys., 922 F.3d 713, 719, 725-31 (6th Cir.) (assessing whether the ancillary restraints doctrine applied to 
alleged coordinated conduct among various hospitals where those hospitals' functions were governed by a joint operating 
agreement), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 380, 205 L. Ed. 2d 219 (2019); Polk Bros., Inc. v. Forest City Enters., Inc., 776 F.2d 185, 
188-90 (7th Cir. 1985) (concluding that, under Illinois law (which ""refers courts to federal antitrust law as a guide to questions of 
interpretation""), the rule of reason applied to an ""ancillary"" restraint stemming from ""a new venture—the building of a joint 
facility—that would expand output""). Simply put, such cases, which we assume arguendo were correctly decided and which do 
not bind this Court in any event, are distinguishable on their facts and inapplicable here. "
873,20," Aiyer's counsel also contended that ""any instruction on bid rigging was not necessary because there was no bid rigging 
proved."" App'x at 1059."
873,21," Although Aiyer generally argues on appeal that the district court ""could have instructed the jury to consider the reasonableness 
of [his] conduct,"" Aiyer Br. at 42, he is incorrect. As discussed supra, absent an applicable exception, the per se rule ""eliminates 
the need to study the reasonableness"" of a challenged restraint on trade. Leegin, 551 U.S. at 886 (emphasis added); accord 
Socony-Vacuum, 310 U.S. at 224 n.59. "
874,22," As described in detail in the district court's decision, see Aiyer II, 470 F. Supp. 3d at 392-400, the government's proof included 
compelling, direct evidence of a per se violation. Taking just one example, as described above, on January 8, 2012, Aiyer and 
Cummins realized that they had the same U.S. dollar—South African rand stop-loss order—to sell $25 million if the market price 
reached a certain low point. Once this situation was made known to Katz on a Bloomberg chat involving him, Aiyer, and 
Cummins, Katz wrote, ""why dont we drive [the price] down there and keep some,"" Gov't Supp. App'x at 464, which Cummins 
understood to mean, ""if you push it through now, it is likely that the market would bounce back and . . . you could make a profit 
selling higher if the market bounces higher,"" Gov't Supp. App'x at 81. Then, as Cummins testified at trial, the three co-
conspirators ""[w]ork[ed] together on the stop-loss."" Gov't Supp. App'x at 122. There was evidence introduced at trial that, 
through this coordinated effort, Aiyer, Cummins, and Katz lowered the market price for the South African rand, after which Aiyer 
wrote in the chatroom, ""wow tht went."" Gov't Supp. App'x at 465. Later that day, Aiyer wrote on Bloomberg chat, ""salute to first 
coordinated . . . zar effort,"" to which Katz replied, ""yep . . . many more to come."" Gov't Supp. App'x at 450. The evidence of 
criminal intent was further bolstered by Aiyer's prior comments on Bloomberg chat, such as telling Katz, ""u shud introduce me to 
the zar mafia,"" Gov't Supp. App'x at 395; writing that he ""want[ed] in to the zar mafia,"" Gov't Supp. App'x at 396; and that, 
""between [him and Katz] . . . we can ryun zar,"" Gov't Supp. App'x at 395; see also App'x at 1133 (Bloomberg chat where, in 
response to Katz's comment that ""conspiracies are nice,"" Aiyer writes, ""hahaha . . . prolly shudnt puot this on perma chat"")."
874,23," Aiyer does attempt to relitigate that, in connection with Russian ruble trading, his role was more akin to that of a supplier in a 
vertical relationship, such that his conduct should be assessed under the rule of reason. See Apple, 791 F.3d at 321 (explaining 
that ""the Supreme Court in recent years has clarified that vertical restraints—including those that restrict prices—should 
generally be subject to the rule of reason"" (citing Leegin, 551 U.S. at 882 and Khan, 522 U.S. at 7)). However, the jury heard 
arguments that this was not a horizontal price agreement among competitors and implicitly rejected those arguments as a 
factual matter with its verdict, and, again, Aiyer does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the verdict on 
appeal. "
876,24," To be clear, the exchange of price information is different from the primary restraint of trade at issue here—price fixing—
which, as noted, has consistently been held to be the quintessential per se violation under the Sherman Act."
876,25," Aiyer selectively quotes Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 592, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 
2d 538 (1986), to argue that the failure of the alleged scheme to affect prices in three years is ""strong evidence"" of a lack of 
intent to do so. Aiyer's Br. at 55. However, in his opening brief, he elides the key fact that the Supreme Court made this 
comment in light of evidence that the alleged conspiracy at issue had been ineffectual for around twenty years. See 475 U.S. at 
592 (explaining that an ""alleged conspiracy's failure to achieve its ends in the two decades of its asserted operation is strong 
evidence that the conspiracy does not in fact exist""). Thus, the strength of the inference here regarding the lack of a price effect 
(to the extent that could be proven) is not analogous to the factual circumstances in Matsushita. "
877,26," The district court noted, in ruling on the admissibility of certain defense exhibits, that ""witnesses could be re-called"" if the 
defense wanted to establish the necessary foundation for additional evidence on the intent issue by showing that the 
conspirators were ""aware of what was going on in the market."" Gov't Supp. App'x at 249. Aiyer did not recall any witnesses or 
otherwise establish such a foundation. "
878,27," Aiyer raises no arguments concerning that juror's post-trial podcast wherein he discussed his jury service. Accordingly, we 
consider any such arguments abandoned. See Cohen v. Rosicki, Rosicki & Assocs., P.C., 897 F.3d 75, 87 n.9 (2d Cir. 2018)."
878,28," We have clarified that ""[t]he requirements of 'strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence' do not demand that the 
allegations be irrebuttable; if the allegations were conclusive, there would be no need for a hearing."" United States v. Ianniello, 
866 F.2d 540, 543; accord Baker, 899 F.3d at 130-31. For example, in Ianniello, we found that a post-trial hearing was 
warranted based upon three affidavits from jurors that ""contain[ed] concrete allegations of inappropriate conduct [by the trial 
judge and a federal marshal] that constitute[d] competent and relevant evidence."" 866 F.2d at 543. "
896,1, The Court finds Judge Kocoras's reasoning in In re Brand Name persuasive and adopts it here. 
910,1," Alternatively, Defendants argue these claims must be dismissed because the alleged fraudulent communication supporting 
them ""occurred solely in the context of the mediation,"" and such confidential communications ""are off limits as a source of 
evidence."" ECF No. 48 ¶ 8. Defendants provide no authority from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals or this district to support 
this argument. See Defs.' Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 27, ECF No. 48-1. Because Par fails to state a claim for fraudulent 
inducement, the Court does not address this aspect of Defendants' argument. See infra Part IV.B.2-3. For the same reason, the 
Court does not address Par's responsive argument that the Mediation Agreement is ""outside the scope of the pleadings."" See 
Pls.' Resist. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 17, ECF No. 77. "
914,2," Hyler v. Garner explains the standard for rescission based on the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation. 548 N.W.2d at 870-71. 
Under Iowa law, the elements for fraudulent misrepresentation and fraudulent inducement are the same. See McIrvin, 2010 U.S. 
Dist. LEXIS 14723, 2010 WL 605651, at *9; compare Hyler, 548 N.W.2d at 871, with Whalen, 545 N.W.2d at 294. "
915,3," Defendants also argue the Court should dismiss any aspect of Plaintiffs' antitrust claims (Count I) predicated on conduct 
occurring prior to the effective date of the Settlement Agreement. ECF No. 48-1 at 33. Because the Court finds Plaintiffs fail to 
plausibly allege monopolization or attempted monopolization under federal or Iowa law, the Court does not address Defendants' 
alternative argument regarding Count I here. See supra Part IV.A."
915,4," Defendants do not offer alternative arguments supporting dismissal as to Par's defamation claims (Counts V and VI), false light 
claim (Count VII), intentional interference claims (Count VIII and IX), and civil conspiracy (XI). See ECF No. 48 ¶¶ 10-11. The 
Court does not address other bases to dismiss these claims. "
928,1," The Defendants are Robinhood Markets, Inc.; Robinhood Financial LLC; Robinhood Securities, LLC; and Citadel Securities 
LLC. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 42-49)."
928,2," The Plaintiffs are Angel Guzman, Burke Minahan, Christopher Miller, and Terell Sterling. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 23-41)."
928,3," The Court refers to Robinhood Markets, Inc.; Robinhood Financial LLC; and Robinhood Securities, LLC, collectively, as 
""Robinhood[.]"" Robinhood Financial LLC and Robinhood Securities, LLC are whollyowned subsidiaries of Robinhood Markets, 
Inc. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 42-45). "
929,4," A ""short"" seller borrows a security from a lender, believing the price of the security will decrease. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 108). It 
then sells the borrowed security to a buyer. (See id.). If the price of the security drops, the short seller buys the security back at a 
lower price and returns it to the lender. (See id.). The difference between the sell price and the buy price is the short seller's 
profit. (See id.). Conversely, the short seller loses money if the price of the security increases. (See id.)."
929,5," The ""Relevant Securities"" are certain stocks the Retail Investors believed would increase in price: GameStop (GME), AMC 
Entertainment (AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), BlackBerry (BB), Express (EXPR), Koss (KOSS), Nokia (NOK), Tootsie Roll 
Industries (TR), and Trivago NV (TRVG). (See [*23]  Am. Compl. ¶ 7). "
931,6," A call option gives the holder the right to buy the asset at a stated fixed price or the ""strike price."" (Am. Compl. ¶ 114). An ""in 
the money"" option has a favorable strike price because it is lower than the market price of a stock (id. ¶ 119), while an ""out of the 
money"" option has an unfavorable strike price because it is higher than market price for the underlying asset (id. ¶ 120). If an 
option expires while out of the money, the contract becomes valueless. (See id. ¶¶ 119-120, 140, 294)."
931,7," Another phenomenon known as a ""Gamma squeeze"" occurred as the prices of the Relevant Securities increased. (Am. Compl. 
¶¶ 114, 116). Options are priced based on a variety of risk variables, including one called ""Gamma,"" which increases as the 
option nears its expiration date or as the option approaches its strike price (i.e., ""being in the money""). (Id. ¶¶ 121, 123-26). 
When a security experiences a sharp price increase, the Gamma increases; stated differently, options that were previously 
unlikely to reach their strike prices before expiration become more likely to do so. (See id. ¶¶ 124-26). As the Gamma increases, "
932,," market makers hedge by purchasing more of the underlying security, which further drives the price of the security higher and 
creates a feedback loop as even deeper out of the money options approach their strike price. (See id. ¶ 126)."
932,8," FTDs can be strong indicators of naked short selling, which occurs when a short seller does not actually possess the security it 
is supposed to borrow, or of market makers taking on more short positions. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 162-63)."
932,9," Internal Robinhood documents show Robinhood actively monitored the actions of other broker-dealers. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 
196). "
933,10," Many of these brokerages reported that their clearing firm, Apex, was responsible for implementing the restrictions. (See Am. 
Compl. ¶ 195). Apex only imposed restrictions on January 28, 2021. (See id.)."
933,11," Private stock exchanges are known colloquially as ""dark pools"" or ""dark exchanges"" because they do not disseminate public 
quotations of securities prices. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 104-07). Through these private exchanges, institutional investors can discreetly 
buy or sell securities in large blocks, mitigating some of the price impacts that their buying or selling activity would otherwise 
have on a ""lit,"" or public, national securities exchange. (Id. ¶ 106)."
933,12," ""Short interests"" are defined as the number of shares of a security that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or 
closed out. (Am. Compl. ¶ 268). "
936,13," ""Upstream"" here refers to an earlier stage in the production or distribution chain, while ""downstream"" refers to a later stage. 
(Am. Compl. ¶ 305). "
938,14," The Court uses the pagination generated by the electronic CM/ECF database, which appears in the headers of all court filings. "
939,15," Other courts have also held that restraints involving securities trading platforms and market makers are vertical, not horizontal. 
See, e.g., In re Interest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litig., No. 16-mc-2704, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86732, 2018 WL 2332069, at *12 
n.8 (S.D.N.Y. May 23, 2018) (""Tradeweb was not a horizontal competitor of the Dealers, as it was a provider of electronic trading 
platforms, not a market maker. The label 'naked restraint,' which antitrust law uses in connection with horizontal competitors, 
therefore, does not fit."" (quotation marks and citation omitted)). "
940,16," In the November 17 Order dismissing the CCAC, the Court first examined whether Plaintiffs alleged parallel conduct between 
Defendants. (See Nov. 17, 2021 Order 32-35). This analysis was necessary because Plaintiffs previously alleged a ""hub-and-
spoke conspiracy"" involving horizontal relationships between multiple clearinghouses and brokerages. (Id. 34). Now, Plaintiffs 
have narrowed the Defendants to Robinhood and Citadel Securities, who are alleged to be important partners in a vertical 
relationship rather than competitors. As such, Plaintiffs no longer rely on allegations of parallel conduct, which require ""'plus 
factors' to make the parallel conduct 'more probative of conspiracy than of conscious parallelism.'"" Auto. Alignment & Body 
Serv., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 953 F.3d 707, 726 (11th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted). Still, ""[a] plus-factor analysis provides a way to organize circumstantial evidence that, in the plaintiff's view, reduces the 
probability that defendants were acting independently."" In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. Antitrust Litig., No. 18-cv-864, 581 F. Supp. 3d 
1029, 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11261, 2022 WL 199274, at *14 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 21, 2022) (alteration added). The Court thus 
continues to use the plus-factor framework to analyze Plaintiffs' allegations of circumstantial evidence."
940,17," Plaintiffs no longer rely on several other plus factors the Court previously rejected, such as actions against unilateral self-
interest (see Nov. 17, 2021 Order 38-39), the opportunity to coordinate and collude (see id. 39-40), and government 
investigations (see id. 47-48). (See Resp. 14-25). "
941,18," ""That Citadel Securities held short interests in the Relevant Securities is a reasonable inference to be drawn in Plaintiffs' 
favor."" (Nov. 17 2021 Order 36 (citing Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, Inc., 376 F.3d 1065, 1069 
n.1 (11th Cir. 2004))). "
945,19," Plaintiffs' cited cases do not provide support here. (See Resp. 21-22 (citing United States v. Seigler, 990 F.3d 331, 339 (4th 
Cir. 2021) (upholding inference that the defendant knowingly participated in a drug distribution conspiracy because of the 
familiarity between the coconspirators and the coded language they used); In re Urethane Antitrust Litig., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
69784, 2013 WL 2097346, at *11 (D. Kan. May 15, 2013) (holding the destruction of documents may be evidence of a 
conspiracy); United States v. Curtis, 635 F.3d 704, 717 (5th Cir. 2011) (finding statements imploring one not to go to the 
authorities were highly probative of a conspiracy); Belcher v. Atl. Cap. Realty, LLC, No. 6:08-cv-1989, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
152815, 2010 WL 11507399, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 17, 2010) (no discussion of concealment); United States v. Gacnik, 50 F.3d 
848, 852 (10th Cir. 1995) (finding the concealment of explosives was evidence of a conspiracy to manufacture explosives). "
946,20," Plaintiffs argue ""the decision to implement restrictions on purchasing only was arbitrary"" because ""[v]olatility is caused by both 
increases and decreases in a stock price."" (Resp. 25 n.20 (alteration added; emphasis omitted); see also Am. Compl. ¶¶ 361-
62). Why, then, would ""other broker-dealers, including Ally, Dough, Public.com, SoFi, Stash, Tastyworks and Webull implement[] 
purchasing restrictions"" but not sales restrictions? (Am. Compl. ¶ 195 (alteration added)). "
948,21," Plaintiffs insist ""it is premature for the Court to determine whether the per se or the rule of reason test applies at the motion[-
]to[-]dismiss stage."" (Resp. 13 (alterations added); see also id. 28-29). Not so. Courts routinely determine which test applies at 
the motion-to-dismiss stage. See, e.g., Quality Auto Painting Ctr. of Roselle, Inc., 917 F.3d at 1271-72; Jacobs v. Tempur-Pedic 
Int'l, Inc., 626 F.3d 1327, 1333-36 (11th Cir. 2010); In re Musical Instruments & Equipment Antitrust Litig., 798 F.3d 1186, 1191-
93 (9th Cir. 2015); Dickson v. Microsoft Corp., 309 F.3d 193, 205-206 (4th Cir. 2002); cf. PSKS, Inc. v. Leegin Creative Leather 
Prods., Inc., 615 F.3d 412, 417-20 (5th Cir. 2010) (using the rule of reason test at motion-to-dismiss stage); Total Benefits 
Planning Agency, Inc. v. Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield, 552 F.3d 430, 434-37 (6th Cir. 2008) (analyzing under both the per 
se and rule of reason tests at motion-to-dismiss stage). "
950,22," The Supreme Court has stated that ""the Sherman Act applies only to a 'restraint upon commercial competition in the marketing 
of goods or services.'"" Kalmanovitz, 769 F.2d at 156 (quoting Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 495, 60 S. Ct. 982, 84 
L. Ed. 1311 (1940)). And lower courts have ""observed that the purchase or sale of stock by investors does not fit easily within 
the definition of goods or services as used by the antitrust laws."" Id. (footnote call number omitted; citing Bucher, 452 F. Supp. 
1288). The court in Kalmanovitz held the sale of stock of a single company within the context of a takeover battle did not fall 
within the definition of section 1 of the Sherman Act. See id. In its reasoning, the Kalmanovitz court relied on two other lower 
court opinions: in Bucher, the court held an agreement to effectuate a tender offer was not an unreasonable restraint of trade 
even though it fixed the price of the company's shares to the shareholders' detriment, 452 F. Supp. at 1289; and in Schaefer, the 
court concluded the common law interpretation of ""restraint of trade"" never encompassed stock market manipulation and 
accordingly dismissed the plaintiffs' Sherman Act suit, 326 F. Supp. at 1191-92. See Kalmanovitz, 769 F.2d at 156. While the 
Kalmanovitz court noted ""a number of cases in which the antitrust laws have been applied to the securities industry[,]"" id. at 157 
(alteration added; collecting cases), Kalmanovitz, Bucher, and Schaefer caution against the creation of a market defined by the 
sale of certain stocks to investors. "
955,1," Because the case has already been transferred to this District, Defendants' argument that the case should be transferred to the 
Northern District of Illinois (Dkt. 49 at 19-22) is moot."
955,2," Whether a statute of limitations defense applies is for the arbitrator, not the Court, to decide. Zurich Am. Ins., 466 F.3d at 581 
(""Procedural questions which grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively not for the judge, but for 
an arbitrator to decide. So, too, the presumption is that the arbitrator should decide allegations of waiver, delay, or a like defense 
to arbitrability."" (quoting Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 84, 123 S. Ct. 588, 154 L. Ed. 2d 491 (2002))). "

1025,1," On August 11, 2020, I granted Novartis AG's motion to dismiss the same three counterclaims, as against it, under Rule 12(b)(2) 
for lack of personal jurisdiction."
1025,2," Because Lens.com dropped the antitrust counterclaims that were not transferred to the MDL, the antitrust allegations recounted 
are only those necessary to decide the motion to strike the fourth affirmative defense of Unclean Hands, which incorporates 
Lens.com's antitrust allegations. "
1026,3," Alcon has filed an unopposed request for judicial notice, in which it requests that I take judicial notice of the Notice of 
Recordation of Assignment from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which shows that the trademarks previously 
owned by Novartis AG have been assigned to Alcon, Inc. I can take ""judicial notice of official records of the United States Patent 
and Trademark Office."" Kaplan, Inc. v. Yun, 16 F. Supp. 3d 341, 345 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)."
1026,4," While generally limited to consideration of the facts as alleged in the complaint on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, courts may consider 
materials incorporated by reference in, or ""integral"" to, the complaint. United States ex rel. Foreman v. AECOM, 19 F.4th 85, 106 
(2d Cir. 2021). Where a plaintiff has omitted text or images found on a product package, a court may consider the full product 
package if: (1) the plaintiff relies on the package in framing its complaint, (2) the complaint clearly and substantially references 
the package, and (3) the authenticity or accuracy of the package is undisputed. Gordon v. Target Corp., 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
48769, 2022 WL 836773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); see also N. Am. Olive Oil Ass'n v. D'Avolio Inc., 457 F. Supp. 3d 207, 
220-21 (E.D.N.Y. 2020). Here, the U.S.-only packaging changes to the DACP and AOHG lenses form part of the basis for 
Lens.com's Lanham Act and GBL claims. Lens.com repeatedly references the U.S.-only packaging changes. While Lens.com 
does not explicitly allege that the U.S.-only packaging included the words ""For sale in USA only"" directly beneath the U.S. flag, 
the court so found that it did in its order on Alcon's preliminary injunction motion. And, finally, Lens.com does not object to 
Alcon's request that I consider this language and does not dispute the accuracy of Alcon's assertion that this language is found 
directly underneath the U.S. flag on the U.S.-only DACP and AOHG product packaging. "
1029,5," Because Lens.com does not allege in its counterclaims, or argue in its opposition, that Alcon ""intentionally set out to deceive 
the public"" through ""deliberate conduct...of an egregious nature,"" I do not address this alternative avenue for bringing an implied 
falsity claim. See Johnson & Johnson * Merck Consumer Pharms. Co. v. Smithkline Beecham Corp., 960 F.2d 294, 299 (2d Cir. 
1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). "
1030,6," Lens.com also alleges that the use of the ""CE"" symbol on Alcon products causes purchasers to reasonably believe that Alcon 
products bearing this symbol ""comply with all FDA regulations"" and ""may be lawfully sold in the United States."" Counterclaims ¶ 
260. This allegation is not plausible because Lens.com's alleges that the ""CE"" symbol is ""commonly understood"" to refer to 
whether the product complies with ""European Union legislation,"" not FDA regulations or the laws of the United States. "
1031,7," The lone case cited by Lens.com does not compel a different result. In Emco, Inc. v. Obst, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12118, 2004 
WL 1737355 (C.D. Cal. May 7, 2004), Diamond Blade Warehouse, Inc. (""DBW""), the seller of industrial cutting tools, including 
diamond blades, used the brand name ""Americut,"" along with images of an American flag, the Statute of Liberty, Mount 
Rushmore, and the Space Shuttle on its website and in a printed catalog as part of its marketing for one of its blades. Id. at *4. 
DBW's printed catalog referred to its ""factory"" in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. Id. The Americut blade, however, was not manufactured 
in the United States. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12118, [WL] at *5. Considering its statement about its factory, the ""Americut"" brand 
name, and the display of the symbols, the court held that DPW was barred by the unclean hands affirmative defense from 
bringing a false advertising counterclaim. 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12118, [WL] at *6. Here, by contrast, Lens.com does not 
premise its claim on any affirmative statements that Alcon's products are manufactured in the United States, no brand names 
are alleged to reference the United States, and there is only one symbol at issue—the U.S. flag—which includes the statement 
""For sale in USA only"" directly underneath. "
1033,8," WM Int'l, Inc. v. 99 Ranch Mkt. #601, 329 F.R.D. 491 (E.D.N.Y. 2019), cited by Alcon, does not support a contrary conclusion. "
1034,9," Estee Lauder, Inc. v. Fragrance Counter, Inc., 189 F.R.D. 269 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), on which Lens.com relies, does not compel a 
different result. There, after some discovery, the court made clear that the defendant had presented evidence, unlike any of the 
allegations here, that suggested the possibility that plaintiffs were ""directly attempting to misuse their trademarks for 
anticompetitive purposes."" Id. at 273. Moreover, Estee Lauder was decided before GEOMC and, rather than evaluating 
defendant's affirmative defense for plausibility, merely found that ""it is not possible to say that it appears to a certainty,"" that 
plaintiffs would succeed in defeating the defense. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). "

1065,1," The Directs' expert is Dr. Colin A. Carter. He has degrees from the University of California at Berkeley and is a Professor of 
Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California. The Indirects' expert is Dr. Russell W. Mangum III. He 
earned masters and doctoral degrees from the University of Southern California and is a Senior Vice President at Nathan

University of California at Berkeley and is President of The Brattle Group. Defendants' expert is Dr. John H. Johnson, IV. He has 
a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is CEO of Edgeworth Economics, LLC. The experts

1066,2," The ""Indirect Purchaser States"" are: Arizona, California, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, 
Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New 
Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, 
Wisconsin, or West Virginia. The Indirects seek damages for this class under the respective state laws. The Indirects also seek 
certification of a class for nationwide injunctive relief under federal law. "
1067,3," The ""Repealer Jurisdictions"" are: California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, 
Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode 
Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin. The End Users seek damages for this class under the 
respective state laws."
1067,4," The Court notes that the End Users seek certification of a class that is narrower in scope, both substantively and temporally, 
than the classes sought by the Directs and Indirects, and narrower than the classes the Court has approved in settlements the 
End Users have reached with certain defendants. The Court ordered a brief explaining this change, which the End Users 
provided. See R. 5569. Bottom line, the End Users believe their proof more closely fits a narrower class. See id. at 1. 
Defendants do not argue that this narrowing undermines any of the motions for class certification, so the Court has not focused 
on its significance in addressing them. "
1069,5," Defendants also argue that their expert has shown that Publix grocery did not suffer overcharges, and so any consumer who 
made purchases at Publix cannot be an adequate class representative. See R. 4213 at 57. Defendants similarly argue that the 
Indirects' class definition is overbroad because it ""sweeps"" in indirect purchasers who were not overcharged according to their 
expert's statistical analysis. The Court rejects these arguments for reasons discussed below regarding Defendants' arguments 
that Plaintiffs' experts improperly ""pool"" transaction data. "
1071,6," The vertical axis refers to ""RTC Broilers,"" which means ""ready to cook,"" which simply means the chicken has been slaughtered 
and prepared for sale as food."
1071,7," Agri Stats reported production information for Broiler producers who subscribed to the service. This information was published 
with producer names redacted. But Plaintiffs allege that Agri Stats intended for the information to be easily identified. Notably, 
Plaintiffs have discovered a copy of an Agri Stats report from Pilgrim's for which the numerical identifiers for each producer were 
over-written by hand with the producers' actual names. See R. 3971-3 at 27 (Figure 2). This evidence indicates Pilgrim's was "
1072,," able to de-anonymize the otherwise proprietary and confidential information of its competitors. Moreover, it is alleged that other 
supposedly anonymous data was easily understood by experienced industry players as belonging to particular producers 
because of the nature of the data itself. "
1073,8," Defendants do not challenge Carter's, or any of Plaintiffs' experts', credentials or qualifications. "
1075,9," See Behrend v. Comcast Corp., 655 F.3d 182, 216-17 (3d Cir. 2011) (Jordan, J. concurring) (""[The expert's] benchmark 
counties fail in that regard because he formulated his model at a time when Plaintiffs had four separate theories of antitrust 
impact, and so he did not select his benchmark counties to isolate the impact of reduced overbuilding. He chose them, as one 
would expect, to reflect the impact of other conditions in addition to reduced overbuilding. Consequently . . . once the District 
Court rejected Plaintiffs' other theories of antitrust impact—leaving only the reduced-overbuilding theory—[the expert's] model no 
longer fits Plaintiffs' sole theory of antitrust impact and, instead, produces damages calculations that are not the certain result of 
the wrong.""). "
1080,10," Urner Barry and Georgia Dock are two of the primary Broiler price indices. Part of Plaintiffs' allegations are that some 
Defendants conspired to manipulate the Georgia Dock index by submitting falsely inflated price reports."
1080,11," The facts of the Lamictal case in particular show that it has little relevance here. That case concerned the pending expiration 
of a pharmaceutical patent and a settlement agreement between the manufacturer that owned the patent and a potential generic 
manufacturer. The agreement had the effect of decreasing the availability of generic versions of the pharmaceutical. The market 
was characterized by individual sales to direct purchasers, priced through individual negotiations. These isolated transactions for 
a sophisticated chemical product bear little resemblance to the daily commodity market for a basic food product like Broilers. The 
other cases Defendants cite also concern markets bearing little resemblance to the market for Broilers. See, e.g., In re 
Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust Litig., 336 F.R.D. 5, 56 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (claim that aluminum producers restricted supply by 
intentionally complicating the administrative processes to dispatch aluminum from warehouses for individual shipments); Reed v. 
Advoc. Health Care, 268 F.R.D. 573, 577 (N.D. Ill. 2009) (allegation that hospitals conspired to suppress wages for nurses); 
Exhaust Unlimited, Inc. v. Cintas Corp., 223 F.R.D. 506, 508 (S.D. Ill. 2004) (claim that uniform rental and laundry companies 
conspired to charge customers sham ""environmental"" fees). "
1082,12," As noted earlier, Defendants also rely on this aspect of Johnson's opinion to argue that the Indirects' class definition ""sweeps 
in a great many class members that were demonstrably unharmed"" and thus is ""fatally overbroad."" R. 4234 at 52. They make a 
similar argument specifically with respect to Publix grocery and the Consumer class definition. See R. 4213 at 52. The Court 
rejects these arguments because, as discussed, the Johnson's unpooling analysis does not appear to produce an accurate 
picture of the market. "

1104,9," The emphasis here indicates an addition to the model instruction to address the facts of this case. The instruction as presented

1104,10," In its reply, Meta argues for the first time that even if Dor's statements were not knowingly false, BrandTotal violated its 
discovery obligations by failing to correct Dor's false statements, and that later representations by BrandTotal regarding the 
nature of its data collection were also false. Sanctions Reply at 11-12. BrandTotal had no opportunity to respond to these 
arguments, and no reason is apparent why Meta could not have raised them in its motion if it intended to pursue them. The 
Court therefore declines to consider them. "
1106,11," In 2017, when BrandTotal created some of the accounts at issue, the relevant provision read: ""You will not collect users' 
content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or 
scrapers) without our prior permission."" Dor TRO Decl. Ex. I at 2, § 3.2. BrandTotal suggests that was a narrower restriction but 
does not explain why that is so. See Defs.' MSJ at 10; Defs.' MSJ Reply at 9-10. To the extent BrandTotal's argument rests on 
the list of particular methods of automated collection included in the older version but omitted from the newer version, the Court 
finds that the use of ""such as"" to introduce the parenthetical plainly indicates that it is intended as an incomplete list of examples 
and not to limit the scope of the restriction. "
1107,12," Meta cites Sheppard, Mullin for the proposition that contracts may only be invalidated as contrary to public policy where they 
implicate express law, Pl.'s Opp'n to MSJ (dkt. 303) at 4, which is the opposite of what that case says."
1107,13," Vidal predated the Fourteenth Amendment, which through its guarantee of due process incorporates the First Amendment's 
Establishment Clause against the states, and would of course prohibit a state's common law from incorporating a particular 
religion. See Everson v. Bd. of Ed., 330 U.S. 1, 13-16, 67 S. Ct. 504, 91 L. Ed. 711 (1947). Other terms of the bequest at issue 
in Vidal remained the subject of litigation for more than a century, including a racial restriction that was ultimately held 
unconstitutional. See generally, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Brown, 392 F.2d 120 (3d Cir. 1968). "
1109,14," The parties' briefs do not cite any source to access the text of the CPRA, which was enacted through a ballot initiative 
submitted in 2019 and accepted by California voters in 2020. The Court takes judicial notice of the text submitted by the sponsor 
of

4,

available 
on 
the 
California 
Attorney 
General's

at 
https://oag.ca.gov/initiatives/search?combine=19-0021."
1109,15," The potential for automated access and collection of data from a social networking platform to weaken consumer privacy is 
fairly obvious: many users choose to share information with only certain people, and might reasonably expect that the platform 
would prevent other users from automatically recording that data and selling it to data aggregators or other third parties for 
commercial use. While BrandTotal's programs did not, at least for the most part, collect third-party personal information directly 
implicating such concerns, that privacy interest nevertheless reflects a valid public policy interest acknowledged in the CPRA 
and weighing against invalidating contractual prohibitions on unauthorized automated data collection."
1109,16," One provision of the CCPA (materially unchanged by the CPRA) that BrandTotal has not addressed requires businesses to 
disclose (among other information) ""[t]he specific pieces of personal information it has collected about that consumer . . . upon 
receipt of a verifiable consumer request from the consumer."" Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.110(a)(5), (b). If Meta collects information 
about what advertisements it has shown to particular users, that provision might require Meta to disclose that information to 
users who request it. But it is of little use to BrandTotal here because it creates a specific process for requesting and providing 
the data, rather than suggesting that users have a right to collect that data themselves, notwithstanding Meta's terms of use, by 
any means they see fit. "
1110,17," The report of BrandTotal's expert witness Dr. Wilcox—which BrandTotal does not cite in its arguments regarding section 
3.2.3—touches on some related issues, noting the difficulty of collecting automated data from ""walled garden"" websites that 
restrict access, Wilcox Report ¶¶ 44-49, and Meta's domination of the social media advertising market (but not any market for 
advertising analytics), e.g., id. ¶ 59, but does not provide the sort of market analysis that would be necessary to find Meta's 
conduct unreasonable for the purpose of the Sherman Act. Wilcox's ultimate conclusions, that ""the information BrandTotal 
collects from social media channels . . . is properly considered public information"" and that BrandTotal's ""are the same type of 
services that have been offered in the advertising industry for decades,"" id. ¶ 126, do not speak to whether section 3.2.3 of 
Meta's terms of use unreasonably restrains competition. As a media and marketing professor rather than an economist, Dr. 
Wilcox would likely not be qualified to offer opinions on a relevant market for an antitrust claim. "
1111,18," Even if BrandTotal had provided evidence to support the basic elements of a rule of reason claim, it would still face a hurdle in 
overcoming the general rule that the antitrust laws impose no requirement to deal with a competitor. BrandTotal asserts for the 
first time in its reply that the ""essential facilities"" doctrine applies, but again cites no evidence to support its contention that 
automated collection of data from Facebook is an essential facility. Defs.' MSJ Reply at 5-6."
1111,19," BrandTotal has not invoked the Cartwright Act, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 16700-70, California's closer analogue to section 1 
of the Sherman Act. "
1112,20," BrandTotal cites Kasky solely for its summary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Board of Pharmacy decision discussed below. See 
Defs.' MSJ at 22 (quoting Kasky, 27 Cal. 4th at 951). The issue before the California Supreme Court in Kasky was whether 
statements by Nike about the working conditions in its factories were commercial speech subject to diminished First Amendment 
protection if determined to be false or misleading, and thus properly within the scope of the state's consumer protection laws, 
which the court answered in the affirmative. That holding is of no use to BrandTotal here. "
1113,21," See, [**52]  e.g., Nat'l Abortion Fed'n v. Ctr. for Med. Progress, No. 15-cv-03522-WHO, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14485, 2016 
WL 454082, at *18-21 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 5, 2016) (issuing an injunction to enforce a confidentiality agreement based on the 
conclusion that the defendants knowingly waived their first amendment rights by entering the agreement, and that any public 
interest in disclosure of the information at issue was insufficient to compel a different result), aff'd, 685 F. App'x 623 (9th Cir. 
2017)."
1113,22," Saturday Evening Post was recognized as abrogated with respect to an unrelated holding regarding harmless error review in 
Glickenhaus & Co. v. Household Int'l, Inc., 787 F.3d 408, 426 n.12 (7th Cir. 2015). "
1114,23," The Court need not consider here whether a sufficiently powerful counterparty, such as another Fortune 500 company or a 
government entity, might have enough bargaining power to effectively negotiate the terms under which it accessed Meta's 
products. "
1115,24," Fagerstrom v. Amazon.com, Inc., 141 F. Supp. 3d 1051, 1068 (S.D. Cal. 2015), aff'd sub nom. Wiseley v. Amazon.com, Inc., 
709 F. App'x 862 (9th Cir. 2017), applied Washington rather than California law, which differs in its treatment of this doctrine."
1115,25," BrandTotal has not pursued a defense based on the advice it received at that time, that advertisements on Facebook did not 
fall within the scope of Meta's ""products"" for the purpose of section 3.2.3. See Burrell Opp'n Decl. Ex. 4."
1115,26," BrandTotal also argues that the sign-up page contradicts section 4 by stating that users ""'can opt out any time' from the 
'Terms, Data Policy and Cookies' referenced in the prior sentence."" Defs.' MSJ at 32. In context, that language clearly applies to 
receiving text messages, not to the terms of use. Martens Opening Report ¶ 64 (screenshot of the sign-up page, including the 
text: ""You may receive SMS Notifications from us and can opt out any time.""). "
1116,27," It is not entirely clear whether Meta is taking the position that even non-automated access by BrandTotal to public (i.e., non-
password-protected) portions of Facebook is a violation of section 3.2.3.'s prohibition against ""attempt[ing] to access data you do 
not have permission to access"" because Meta has revoked BrandTotal's access to its products. In light of the concerns raised by 
the Supreme Court in Packingham and the Ninth Circuit in hiQ, enforcing the terms of use in that manner would raise greater 
concerns. The Court declines to resolve that issue on the briefing the parties have provided, which did not focus on it. "
1118,28," There is perhaps some tension between this holding and the Court's holding below that UpVoice 2021 does not access Meta's 
servers for the purpose of the CFAA. Any such tension results at least in part from BrandTotal's waiver of arguments with 
respect to breach of contract. The Court does not reach the question of whether BrandTotal could have prevailed on the 
question of whether UpVoice 2021 breaches section 3.2.3 had it preserved that argument. "
1120,29," Formally, the Ninth Circuit held only that the plaintiff in hiQ raised ""serious questions"" that the CFAA did not preempt its 
tortious interference claim, which was sufficient to affirm the district court's preliminary injunction. 31 F.4th at 1201. The panel's 
statement that ""Van Buren . . . reinforces our conclusion that the concept of 'without authorization' does not apply to public 
websites,"" id. at 1199, however, is a clear expression of its view of the law that this Court is not inclined to disregard, and Meta 
has not argued that the Court should treat it as anything but binding. "
1121,30," The record suggests BrandTotal's Calix product uses the same relevant process as UpVoice 2021 to gather data, but 
BrandTotal has not sought summary judgment with respect to that product, and the Court declines to address the issue sua 
sponte. "
1124,31," While BrandTotal moves to exclude Dr. Prowse's opinions regarding BrandTotal's purported unjust enrichment, it did not move 
to exclude his opinions regarding Meta's losses. "
1125,32," If BrandTotal lacked any way to stop these previously installed programs from accessing Meta's servers, its ongoing 
 [**94] use of the data they collected might not violate the CFAA, which focuses on unauthorized access rather than 
misappropriation of information. But since BrandTotal has not contested Martens's opinions that it could have remotely 
deactivated all of these programs' ongoing proactive access to Meta's platforms, its decision to allow them to keep accessing 
those servers amounts to a violation, and the Court need not decide whether the outcome would differ if BrandTotal had no 
control over the ongoing access. "

department. She now is a federal geophysicist, and her work email address indicates that she works for the U.S. Department of 
the Interior. Plaintiff sought her involvement in the meeting as a ""stakeholder"" in his dispute with Defendant. ECF 2-10 at 1; ECF 
2027 at 9. "
1158,1," The individual defendants are Craig Brooksby, Tonya Newell, Carolyn Souther, and Lynn Pinder, and the LLC defendants are 
Avirta LLC, GG Irrevocable Trust, King Family Enterprises LLC, Maldives LLC, NC Bidding-2 LLC, Red Tree Holdings LLC, The 
Estates (UT) LLC, The Estates LLC, The Estates Real Estate Group LLC, Timbra of North Carolina LLC, and Versa Properties 
LLC. While the defendants vary as to who is responsible for each plaintiff's claims, the defendants have not differentiated 
between and among themselves as to whether injunctive relief is appropriate. For ease of reading, they will be referenced as a 
group, except in the few instances where specificity is required for clarity. The defendants will be individually listed and 
distinguished in the permanent injunction and money judgment, consistent with the verdict. "
1159,2," On no more than a handful of occasions during the relevant time, the Estates authorized a member to attend a foreclosure sale 
and bid on his or her own behalf when all acquisition assistants were unavailable. There was no evidence that the authorized 
member bid against any other Estates member at any of these sales. "
1160,3," As mentioned in footnote 1, because of somewhat different facts for each plaintiff, the defendants for this and other issues are 
not completely identical across plaintiffs."
1160,4," Extortion is wrongfully obtaining anything of value from another by threat, duress, or coercion to take illegal action. See, e.g., 
Harris v. NCNB Nat'l Bank of N.C., 85 N.C. App. 669, 675, 355 S.E.2d 838, 843 (1987). At the time of Ms. Souther's 
misrepresentations, the foreclosure bidding process had ended and an Estates member had the right to buy the plaintiffs' 
property and obtain a deed from the trustee. But the member had put up very little money, had not yet paid the purchase price, 
had no contractual obligation to complete the foreclosure purchase, and did not own the property. By lying about the status of 
the foreclosure, the member's agent, Ms. Souther, attempted to coerce the plaintiffs to pay the Estates member to abandon his 
or her bid under the guise of selling the property back to them. Estates members or their agents frequently approached 
homeowners after winning bids on foreclosed properties. While some no doubt behaved ethically when negotiating with 
homeowners, it is a fair inference that others, with the encouragement of the defendants, had no real intention of closing on the 
foreclosure sale at all. Extorting a homeowner was a safer bet than the risks associated with buying homes in foreclosure and 
flipping them. "
1162,5," In addition to the considerations set forth in eBay, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 imposes procedural requirements. In 
every order granting an injunction, the court must (1) state the reasons why the injunction issued, (2) state the injunction's terms 
specifically, and (3) describe in reasonable detail—and not by referring to the complaint or other document—the act or acts 
restrained or required. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1). "
1163,6," The Court addresses infra the plaintiffs' request to prohibit the defendants from operating http://www.estatestracking.com or 
any website that includes any mechanism to obtain information about how much a prospective bidder at a public foreclosure 
auction is willing to bid. "
1164,7," At the defendants' suggestion, the Court will not include the phrase ""including but not limited to"" in the injunction, as it may not 
be as specific as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d) requires."
1164,8," The Court understands that the trustees in charge of these two foreclosure sales have held all proceedings in abeyance 
pending this litigation so that no defendant has yet acquired a deed."
1164,9," The defendant Versa Properties, LLC won the rights to buy Mr. Williams' rights to his property as the high bidder at a public 
foreclosure sale. It then assigned those rights to the defendant Red Tree Holdings, LLC. Pls.' Trial Ex. 90. "

1166,12," Under North Carolina law, a tenant in common may force his co-tenant in common to sell real property in circumstances that 
are highly likely to apply here. Specifically, ""[a]ny person claiming real property as a tenant in common or joint tenant may 
petition to partition the property,"" N.C. Gen. Stat. § 46A-21(a), and this includes partition by sale. See § 46A-26. Partition by sale 
may be authorized if an actual physical partition cannot be made without substantial injury to any of the parties. See § 46A-
75(a); see also Ward v. Ward, 252 N.C. App. 253, 257, 797 S.E.2d 525, 529 (2017). The Gustafson property is a single-family

1166,13," The defendants have not objected to this relief because it would require action by Carissa. As they implicitly acknowledge in

1168,15," The evidence and statutes establish that the high bidder has a right to obtain a trustee's deed upon timely payment of the bid

1172,3," In addition to market concentration, plaintiffs argue that defendants sit atop the supply and distribution chain that ultimately 
delivers beef to the market. Their role is to purchase cattle from the nation's farmers and ranchers, slaughter, and pack cattle 
into beef, and sell beef to purchasers like plaintiffs. This gatekeeping role allegedly has enabled them to collusively control 
upstream and downstream beef pricing. "

1242,4," The Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit have repeatedly confirmed that antitrust principles equally apply to RICO cases. See, 
e.g., Cnty. of Oakland v. City of Detroit, 866 F.2d 839, 845 (6th Cir. 1989) (""Although we have focused primarily on the 
antitrust laws in the foregoing discussion, most of what we have said is applicable also to the treble damage provision of RICO, 
18 U.S.C. § 1964(c), a provision patterned directly on § 4 of the Clayton Act.""). "
1244,5," Several issues persist as to Plaintiffs' unopposed state-law claims, as they still do not have named plaintiffs. See, e.g., John A. 
Day, ""Made-Whole"" Made Fair: A Proposal to Modify Subrogation in Tennessee Tort Actions, 1 Belmont L. Rev. 71, 88 n.80 
(2014) (discussing possible intersections of statutes of repose and fraudulent-concealment statutes). Those issues will be 
addressed at the class-certification stage. Counts v. Gen. Motors, LLC, 237 F. Supp. 3d 572, 587 (E.D. Mich. 2017) (""[T]he 
question of whether the named Plaintiffs have standing to bring claims on behalf of the unnamed class members is analytically 
subsequent to the class certification analysis.""). "
1275,1," The FAC alleges ""Hawai'i has passed a bill banning the two [] harmful petrochemicals, avobenzone and octocrylene, which are 
toxic to human health, coral reefs and marine species,"" while Defendant argues the legislation ""actually failed to pass Hawaii's 
House."" (FAC ¶ 7; see Mot. at 4; Reply at 2.) As discussed infra Section III.A, the court limits its consideration of the status of 
this legislation on which Defendant seeks judicial notice to the undisputed facts; namely, that the legislation is pending in Hawaii 
and has passed Hawaii's Senate."
1275,2," The FAC defines ""Products"" as the thirty-five different products that Plaintiff asserts should be included in a class action. (Id. ¶

1280,3," In the Motion, Defendant ""recognizes that Courts generally defer ultimate resolution of these issues until class certification"" and 
""rais[ed] this issue now to preserve it,"" (Mot. at 14,) but in Reply argued ""[t]here is no reason to delay resolution of these 
issue[s],"" (see Reply at 12). Defendant's apparent change in position after Plaintiff filed the Opposition provides another reason 
for the court to follow recent Ninth Circuit precedent and defer this inquiry until class certification. Cf. Zamani v. Carnes, 491 F.3d 
990, 997 (9th Cir. 2007) (""HN12[

1281,5, Plaintiff's claims for injunctive relief are discussed separately infra Section III.F. 
1282,6," The court expresses no view as to the sufficiency of Plaintiff's asserted classes at this time. Defendant argues Mazza supports 
the proposition that California purportedly has ""no interest in 'applying California law to the claims of foreign residents concerning 
acts that took place in other states'"" as a matter of law. (Mot. at 16 (citing Mazza, 666 F.3d at 594); see also Reply at 13.) But 
this argument overlooks the detailed choice-of-law analysis the Ninth Circuit undertook ten years ago in reaching the conclusion 
that the application of California law on the facts presented was improper. See Mazza; 666 F.3d at 590-94 (choice-of-law 
analysis); id. at 594 (""Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we hold that each class member's consumer protection "
1283,," claim should be governed by the consumer protection laws of the jurisdiction in which the transaction took place."") (emphasis 
added). The court also notes the Ninth Circuit in Mazza reviewed the district court's ruling on class certification, not on a motion 
to dismiss. See generally id. "
1285,7," Defendant argues that the Center for Biological Diversity article (Exh. 1) is ""unpersuasive"" because it does not ""constitute[]"" or 
""reference"" any ""persuasive studies"" or ""scientific literature."" (See Mot. at 6.) As noted above, it would be premature for the court 
to weigh the persuasiveness of evidence at this stage. See, e.g., Gasser v. Kiss My Face, LLC, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 162165, 
2018 WL 4538729, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 21, 2018) (noting ""on this motion to dismiss, the Court must accept as true Plaintiffs' 
allegation"" that active ingredient in lotion was ""a synthetic ingredient that 'nourishes'"" without evaluating the truth of the contents 
of a website related to the active ingredient on which defendant requested judicial notice, because ""[w]hether the evidence will

1289,8," Because the parties do not specifically address any remedies other than injunctive relief in their motion papers, the court 
expresses no view as to the appropriateness of any remedy other than Plaintiff's sought injunctive relief."
1289,9," Plaintiff's reliance on Davidson to establish an inadequate remedy at law, (see Opp. at 14-15,) is not persuasive. Davidson did 
not address the adequacy of a plaintiff's remedy at law. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit in Davidson held, although it was a ""close 
question,"" that the plaintiff had adequately alleged she ""face[d] an imminent or actual threat of future harm"" where she had ""no 
way of determining whether the representation 'flushable' [wa]s in fact true""; ""regularly visit[ed] stores"" where the wipes were 
sold; and provided a plausible basis for her desire to purchase a particular product again in the future. See 889 F.3d 956, 970-
72. By contrast, Plaintiff purchased the Lotion once, but simultaneously alleges he ""intends"" and ""desires"" to purchase all or an 
undefined number of the thirty-five products listed in the Complaint ""again"" when their labels and advertising are ""lawful and 
consistent with the Products' ingredients."" (FAC ¶ 40.) It is not clearly alleged whether Plaintiff intends to purchase a product(s) 
again if Defendant removes the ""Reef Safe claim""; if Defendant removes octocrylene and avobenzone but retains the ""Reef Safe 
claim""; or which products Plaintiff ""intends to, desires to, and will purchase [] again."" "
1291,10," Defendant again cites Weiss as support. In Weiss, the court dismissed the plaintiff's claims because ""nothing in the labeling or 
marketing"" of the alkaline water at issue ""promise[d]"" that consumers would achieve the benefits on the packaging that related to 
the water itself. 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220863, 2018 WL 6340758 at *8; see 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 220863, [WL] at *5 (""[T]he 
Court finds that a reasonable consumer would read the Water's label to mean that the Alkaline Water, not the consumer, is 
perfectly balanced.""). Because Defendant here essentially restates its argument in Section III.C.2, Weiss fails to be persuasive 
here for the same reasons discussed above. "
1299,1, For readability of this Order the Court uses the word claims to refer to the causes of action within the Counterclaim. 
1300,2," At the hearing both parties presented and discussed information beyond the allegations in the Counterclaim which the Court 
declines to consider for purposes of ruling on the instant Motion to Dismiss."
1300,3," At least some of the alleged conduct could not plausibly impact all three of the relevant product and geographic markets. For 
example, the alleged trademark infringement is limited to a CoStar subsidiary's ads on Google for its own Internet CRE auction 
services, often for specific cities, that also used CREXi's mark. There are no plausible allegations connecting that trademark 
infringement with anticompetitive results in the other two product markets or any other geographic market. However, the Court "
1301,," does not need to address the relationship between each category of alleged anticompetitive conduct, product market, and 
hypothetical geographic market because each of these is a required element of CREXi's antitrust claims and each of them is 
based on deficient allegations."
1301,4," For the purposes of analyzing the sufficiency of CREXi's antitrust counterclaims, the Court ignores any factual disputes and 
generally finds it unnecessary to distinguish which specific subsidiary's website contained the CRE information because it is 
undisputed that they were all ultimately hosted by CoStar. The Court recognizes, however, that there may be significant 
differences in what CoStar is permitted to do contractually or otherwise when the CRE information is located on an independent 
broker's website that is hosted by a CoStar subsidiary. "
1320,1," Within the industry, this service is known as ""routing."" The term e-prescribing also encompasses a separate but interrelated 
service known as ""eligibility."" Eligibility involves the electronic transmission of a patient's benefit information from the patient's 
health insurer to a doctor. It is discussed briefly in part V; but save for this exception, e-prescribing, as used here, refers only to 
the routing market. This Opinion also uses the term doctor as shorthand for any medical professional authorized to issue 
prescriptions or any intermediary acting on a prescriber's behalf to facilitate an e-prescribing transaction, such as providers of 
electronic health records software."
1320,2," RelayHealth was named as a defendant in the original complaint but has settled the claims against it and is no longer a party. 
This Court approved the settlement on February 24, 2022. Order, ECF No. 202. "
1321,3," Although this exclusivity requirement is often absolute, some Surescripts loyalty agreements allow customers to use a 
competitor network for up to 10% of their e-prescribing transactions. See SAC ¶¶ 85-89."
1321,4," The Pharmacies invoke the following state antitrust laws: Ariz. Rev. Stat. §§ 44-1402-03; Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 16700, 
17200, et seq.; Conn. Gen. Stat. §§ 35-26-27; D.C. Code §§ 28-4502-03; Fla. Stat. § 501.204; 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 10/3; Iowa

1322,5," There is no requirement to identify in the complaint the legal theories that purportedly support the claims set forth. Reeves ex 
rel. Reeves v. Jewel Food Stores, Inc., 759 F.3d 698, 701 (7th Cir. 2014). The plaintiffs did so in the FAC, however, declaring 
that ""this is an action under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act . . . ."" Consol. Class Action Compl. ¶ 1, ECF No. 52. "
1323,," Consequently, the sufficiency of claims asserted in the FAC was assessed solely by reference to federal law; the plaintiffs did 
not attempt to argue that the claims were adequately alleged under state law theories."
1323,6," The defendants do not argue that the direct purchaser rule of Illinois Brick bars antitrust claims under any of the relevant state 
laws. Accordingly, the Court eschews any state-by-state analysis of whether the direct purchaser rule applies."
1323,7," Also of note, the Pharmacies here seek both damages and an injunction, but Illinois Brick only applies to suits for damages. 
See U.S. Gypsum Co. v. Ind. Gas Co., 350 F.3d 623, 627 (7th Cir. 2003) (""[T]he direct-purchaser doctrine does not foreclose 
equitable relief . . . .""). But see Apple Inc. v. Pepper, 139 S. Ct. 1514, 1520 n.1, 203 L. Ed. 2d 802 (2019) (implying that the 
question of whether Illinois Brick applies to actions for injunctive relief is unsettled); but see also Pepper, 139 S. Ct. at 1527 n.1 
(Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (""[I]t's hard to make sense of the suggestion that Illinois Brick may not apply to claims for injunctive 
relief.""). The defendants do not address the Pharmacies' claim for injunctive relief."
1323,8," The same can be said for the defendants' miscellaneous state law arguments. They simply address various state law theories 
of relief in piecemeal fashion and—even if accepted—would not foreclose any claim. See S-MTD at 27-30. The one exception to 
this is Surescripts' argument that the Pharmacies cannot pursue their claims under the laws of states within which no named 
plaintiff does business. Surescripts contends that ""[i]n a putative class action, where the class has not been certified, some 
named plaintiff must actually possess the requisite Article III standing; it is not sufficient that an absent putative class member "
1324,," may have standing to press one of the claims."" Id. at 26. Not so. ""Although courts . . . have held that claims brought under the 
laws of the states in which no named plaintiff purchased goods must be dismissed for lack of Article III standing, the trend has 
been to treat the issue as one of statutory standing that can be deferred until class certification."" In re Dealer Mgmt. Sys. 
Antitrust Litig., 362 F. Supp. 3d 510, 548 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (cleaned up; citations omitted). As Judge Dow observed, ""[t]his trend is 
consistent with recent Seventh Circuit caselaw holding that 'the question of who is authorized to bring an action under a statute 
is one of statutory interpretation; it does not implicate Article III or jurisdiction.'"" Id. (quoting Woodman's Food Market, Inc. v. 
Clorox Co., 833 F.3d 743, 750 (7th Cir. 2016)). Dismissal of state law ""claims"" at this juncture for lack of Article III standing is 
therefore not warranted."
1324,9," Putting aside the Illinois Brick issue, the state laws applicable to the Pharmacies' claims are consistent with federal antitrust 
law. See App. A to S-MTD 1-4, ECF No. 165-1 (collecting authority). Accordingly, the Court addresses the viability of the claims 
by reference to the Sherman Act. "
1325,10," Expounding on this principle from ZF Meritor, the Third Circuit in Eisai, Inc. v. Sanofi Aventis U.S., LLC explains that ""pricing 
[usually] predominates over other means of exclusivity . . . when a firm uses a single-product loyalty discount or rebate to 
compete with similar products."" 821 F.3d 394, 409 (3d Cir. 2016) (emphasis added). Surescripts points to this comment to claim 
the price-cost test must be applied here. S-MTD at 19. However, the ""loyalty discount[s]"" the Eisai Court was referring to were 
those that lower prices to at or below the competitive market rate, not discounts which, like here, merely lower supracompetitive 
prices to less supracompetitive ones. See Eisai, 821 F.3d at 409 (referencing ""equally efficient competitor[s]"" to imply the 
discussed discounted prices are market rate). Moreover, the Eisai Court expressly distinguished the pricing program at issue 
with the pricing program in ZF Meritor, which (unlike the Eisai program) required customers ""to repay all contractual savings"" if 
they violated the terms of the program. Id. at 406-07. Thus, Eisai does not benefit Surescripts' position. "
1326,11," This is admittedly reductive. For various reasons, e-prescribing may be more appealing to doctors than the traditional method 
of prescribing. Aside from providing the means to electronically generate and transmit prescriptions, e-prescribing may enhance 
patient care, increase administrative efficiency, and reduce medication errors. SAC ¶¶ 30-31."
1326,12," The prices in the foregoing example are used for illustration only; the Pharmacies do not allege rates for doctor-side incentive 
payments. They do, however, allege rates for pharmacy-side fees. As an approximation, the loyalty rate paid by pharmacies is "
1327,17," ¢, SAC ¶¶ 10, 107; the non-loyalty rate is around 20¢, see id. ¶¶ 69-70, 82-88, 126; and the market rate is about 3¢, id. ¶¶ 8, 
10, 157; while the pharmacy-side market shares reflect the aforementioned 80-10-10 split, id. ¶¶ 221, 225. Applying these 
figures instead of those used in the hypothetical would result in similar market incentives: a pharmacy incurs greater costs via 
the non-loyalty option (80x20¢ + 20x3¢ = $16.60) than the loyalty option (90x17¢ + 0x3¢ = $15.30). An issue with this pharmacy-
side calculation, however, is that it does not account for the downstream costs (i.e., the resultant business lost) pharmacies incur 
by foregoing 10 out of 100 e-prescribing connections. Such a figure cannot be reasonably teased from the Pharmacies' 
complaint. The overall point remains the same, however: it is plausible that Surescripts' pricing scheme perverts market 
incentives in a manner that excludes rivals on some basis other than efficiency. "
1328,13," Assume the hypothetical discussed previously represents the incentive payments a doctor could earn over the course of six 
months by choosing either the loyalty option ($7.20) or the non-loyalty option ($6.80). In order for an e-prescribing firm to 
compete with Surescripts on these terms, it would have to raise its incentive payments above the market rate, say from 10¢ to 
12¢ (80x6¢ + 20x12¢ = $7.20). Now imagine a doctor is presented with the same choice for the second half of a year but had 
already chosen the loyalty option for the first half. Given Surescripts' clawback provision, the non-loyalty option would require the 
doctor to payback the bonus incentive payments it earned over the previous half year (90x2¢ = $1.80). Thus, to entice a doctor 
to abandon Surescripts, an e-prescribing competitor would have to raise its incentive payments even further, from 10¢ to 21¢ 
(80x6¢ + 20x21¢ = $9.00 = $7.20 + $1.80). "
1329,14," Surescripts also argues that the Pharmacies fail to allege the existence of a conspiracy. The alleged contracts between 
Surescripts and RelayHealth would constitute direct evidence of a conspiracy and are therefore sufficient. See Am. Tobacco Co. 
v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 810, 66 S. Ct. 1125, 90 L. Ed. 1575 (1946) (A conspiracy is established by circumstances 
showing ""a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds . . . .""). Remarkably, Surescripts 
contends the Pharmacies ""affirmatively admit"" that the contracts do not constitute a conspiracy. S-MTD at 20 (citing SAC ¶ 292). 
Surescripts points to the following sentence in the Pharmacies' complaint: ""In addition to agreeing to . . . contracts in restraint of 
trade with Surescripts, RelayHealth conspired with Surescripts to unlawfully maintain Surescripts' monopoly . . . ."" SAC ¶ 292 
(emphasis added). Surescripts reads the ""in addition to"" phrase to mean that RelayHealth's contractual agreement was wholly 
separate from whatever the Pharmacies are claiming constitutes the conspiracy. Surescripts then highlights that no facts apart 
from those relating to the RelayHealth contracts connote a conspiracy. At the pleading stage, however, plaintiffs are afforded 
reasonable inferences in their favor, Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678; and Surescripts' strained reading of the complaint is neither 
favorable to the plaintiffs nor reasonable. Any ambiguity in the relied-upon sentence is alleviated just a few paragraphs later 
when the Pharmacies make clear that the RelayHealth contracts are central to the conspiracy claim: ""By engaging in the 
foregoing conduct [contracting], Surescripts and RelayHealth have intentionally and wrongfully conspired to monopolize in 
violation of the Sherman Act."" SAC ¶ 296. "
1330,15," RelayHealth internal documents claim ""Surescripts's 'dominant contracting strategy . . . was to prevent RelayHealth from 
competing with Surescripts.'"" SAC ¶ 158 (cleaned up). A 2012 executive memo from Surescripts ""explicitly stated, 'our 
[RelayHealth] contract prevents them from competing against us for core e-prescribing Routing.'"" Id. ¶ 159 (cleaned up). A 
Surescripts executive was quoted in 2013 as stating that ""the only benefit it received from the 2010 contract with RelayHealth 
was that the contract 'helped keep market share.'"" Id. ¶ 164 (cleaned up). "
1331,16," The distinction among the terms contracts, combinations, and conspiracies in section 1 is unimportant. United States v. 
Nunez, 673 F.3d 661, 664 (7th Cir. 2012). A ""'conspiracy' in section 1 is simply a pejorative term for a contract, both 'conspiracy' 
and 'contract' signifying an agreement, a meeting of minds."" Id. ""Courts use the words 'contract,' 'combination,' and 'conspiracy' 
interchangeably."" Procaps S.A. v. Patheon, Inc., 845 F.3d 1072, 1080 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Tidmore Oil Co., Inc. v. BP Oil 
Co., 932 F.2d 1384, 1388 (11th Cir. 1991)). "
1332,17," The characterization of RelayHealth as Surescripts' competitor does not change the analytical lens through which this claim is 
viewed. HN16[
] Only ""naked"" non-compete agreements between competitors are per se illegal. Polk Bros. v. Forest City Enterprises, Inc., 776 F.2d 185, 188 (7th Cir. 1985). ""Ancillary"" non-competes—ones that are a part of larger endeavors to 
promote new productions or products—are evaluated under the rule of reason. Id. at 188-89. "
1333,18," Neither Allscripts nor Surescripts challenge the ""combination or conspiracy"" element of the Pharmacies' section 1 claim. It 
should be noted, however, that even though the Pharmacies allege Allscripts only entered into its exclusive dealing arrangement 
in response to economic coercion, this is not dispositive. HN17[
] ""[A]cquiescence in an illegal scheme is as much a violation of the Sherman Act as the creation and promotion of one."" United States v. Paramount Pictures, 334 U.S. 131, 161, 68 S. Ct. 915, 
92 L. Ed. 1260 (1948); see MCM Partners, Inc. v. Andrews-Bartlett & Assocs., Inc., 62 F.3d 967, 973 (7th Cir. 1995) (""[T]he 
'combination or conspiracy' element of a section 1 violation is not negated by the fact that one or more of the co-conspirators 
acted unwillingly, reluctantly, or only in response to coercion.""). "
1334,19," The Pharmacies claim Surescripts' exclusive dealing arrangements generally ""foreclose well over 80% of the [doctor] sides of 
the routing and eligibility networks from potential competition"". SAC ¶ 227. They also claim ""Allscripts represented approximately 
25% of Surescripts' routing and eligibility transactions."" Id. ¶ 172. Combining the two figures, Allscripts argues only 20% of the 
alleged market foreclosure is attributable to it (25% of 80% equals 20%). "
1345,1," As ordered below, the parties are directed to again mediate their claims prior to trial in light of this Order. "
1346,2," The rates that Duke charges to North Carolina and South Carolina retail customers are regulated by the North Carolina Utilities 
Commission (""NCUC"") and the South Carolina Public Service Commission (""SCPSC""). "
1347,3," NTE contends that these extensions, which Duke admits were given so that it and FPWC would have more time to reach a deal 
on a renewal of the contract before a RFP process might be undertaken, are evidence of wrongful conduct. However, as 
discussed below, FPWC was not required to go through a formal RFP process and more importantly FPWC went through an 
extensive process to evaluate numerous competing bids — including NTE's — before choosing one of Duke's proposals. "
1348,4," NTE could have challenged Duke's FPWC rate with FERC in at least three ways. First, NTE had the right to file a complaint 
against Duke if it believed that Duke's contract with FPWC violated a FERC statute, rule, order, or other law. See 18 C.F.R. § 
385.206. Second, NTE could have intervened in Duke's request to file the rate, see 18 C.F.R. § 385.214, and, third, NTE could 
have protested the rate. See 18 C.F.R. § 385.211. And, if NTE was not satisfied with FERC's ruling on its challenge then it could 
seek rehearing or court review. See 16 U.S.C. 8251. FERC has the authority to not allow the rate to be filed or to set a just and 
reasonable rate if it finds that Duke's rate was unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential. See 16 U.S.C. § 824."
1348,5," NTE alleges that Duke failed to fully disclose its FPWC discounts and credits to FERC. While this appears to be incorrect on 
the merits, see Doc. No. 204-48 at Exhibit B, NTE ought not, having failed to take any action to challenge Duke's FPWC contract 
with FERC, be permitted to assert in this action its inadequate disclosure arguments (which if true could have been remedied 
before FERC accepted — or perhaps might not have accepted — the filed FPWC rate). "
1349,6," NTE initially argued that Duke's alleged refusal to settle the parties' dispute over the amount of payments due under the LGIA 
was part of its wrongful conduct, but at oral argument NTE abandoned that claim, conceding that Duke's settlement demands 
could not be the basis of a claim for exclusionary antitrust conduct or an unfair trade practice. See Doc. No. 228 at 86 (""I can't 
say that someone refusing to settle a lawsuit is a wrong. I'm not suggesting that.""). "
1351,7," Duke asks the Court to find that historical market share is irrelevant because its current market share is based on numerous 
contracts entered into long ago, which it argues are not relevant to the current market for new or renewing customers. Duke is 
plainly wrong on this point. It is universally true that market share is a snapshot in time reflecting transactions that occurred in 
the past and cannot predict the future with certainty. Thus, all market shares are by nature ""historical,"" and blanket acceptance 
of Duke's argument would always preclude the consideration of market share, in contravention of decades of established 
authority."
1351,8," Even a clear monopolist has an upper limit on its prices, which is ""as much as the market will bear."" See Berkey Photo, Inc. v. 
Eastman Kodak Co., 603 F.2d 263, 297 (2d Cir. 1979) (""A pristine monopolist, we have held, may charge as high a rate as the 
market will bear.""). "
1352,9," NTE argues that Duke intends to make up any discounts used to keep customers away from NTE by raising prices with other 
customers, but there is no reason to believe the same limitations to raising prices would not equally apply to all cities of similar 
sizes."
1352,10," NTE argues that this evidence regarding the number of bidders is undercut by evidence that Duke had only lost business to 
NTE in the relevant recent past. See Doc. No. 214-16 at 47. (Duke executive testifying that Duke lost only one customer to a 
competitor other than NTE). Therefore, NTE raises questions as to the actual practical viability of Duke's other ""competitors"" in 
the market. "
1355,11," HN11[
] And FERC has broad enforcement power, including authority to impose civil penalties of over $1 million per violation per day (see 16 U.S.C. § 825o-1(b); Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustments, 178 FERC ¶ 61,008, at P 8 (2022)). 
Therefore, ""Congress has given FERC the tools to police anticompetitive conduct in the market for transmission capacity."" 
Breiding v. Eversource Energy, 939 F.3d 47, 55 (1st Cir. 2019)."
1355,12," Moreover, since May 2020, the status of the Reidsville LGIA has properly been referenced as ""suspended,"" and NTE has 
failed to establish that the termination of the LGIA caused any harm to the competitive process because there is no evidence 
that any potential customer failed to do business with NTE because of the termination (or even considered the termination in 
deciding whether to choose NTE as its power provider). See Doc. No. 204-4 at 154; Doc. No. 204-8 at 190-192, 194-196; Doc. 
No. 204-40 at 270-271; Doc. No. 204-41 at 262. "
1356,13," To the extent that NTE asserts that Duke's alleged failure to disclose information in violation of FERC regulations is an 
independent exclusionary act, it is barred under Trinko for the same reasons discussed above. Indeed, as noted, NTE could 
have timely challenged Duke's price at FPWC (including any alleged failure to disclose information) but failed to do so. See 18 
C.F.R. § 385.206, 16 U.S.C. § 825e, 18 C.F.R. § 385.211(a)(1)."
1356,14," The Court also notes that FERC regulations specifically permit protests, complaints and interventions by competitors. If FERC 
can disallow a rate as too low, then it is clearly protecting competitors because customers with long term set rates are unlikely to 
be hurt by rates that are ""too low."" Also, while NTE points out that FERC cannot award ""money damages,"" it can overturn a rate, "
1357,," which should have the effect of supporting the competitive process by allowing NTE and other competitors to compete for 
business against a lawful rate."
1357,15," NTE argues that the determination of which cost measure is the proper standard to apply for predatory pricing is a ""jury"" 
question. However, NTE has offered no support for that proposition and the Court has not found any. In fact, multiple circuits 
explicitly hold the contrary. In MCI Communications, the Seventh Circuit noted there ""is no support.... for the proposition that a 
jury may simply choose the cost-based standard it feels is most appropriate."" Id. at 1112. Consequently, in MCI the court 
reversed the trial judge and held that the choice of a cost-based standard for evaluating claims of predatory pricing is a question 
of law to be decided by the court. Id. at 1111. Similarly, in Northeastern Telephone Co. v. AT&T, 651 F.2d 76 (2d Cir. 1981), the 
Second Circuit held that the cost standard used to determine whether a monopolist's prices were predatory was a ""legal 
question."" 651 F.2d at 87. In sum, there is no support for the proposition that the determination of the correct cost measure is a 
jury question. As such, the Court will address it as a question of law. "
1359,16," On March 22, 2022, a month after the expert report deadline, and on the eve of his deposition, Dr. Morris submitted a new 
analysis purporting to reallocate Duke's common fixed costs as part of his total average cost analysis. See Doc. Nos. 214-22. 
224-8. However, this belated evidence does not address whether any of those costs are incremental. Further, the Court declines 
to consider any portion of Dr. Morris' analysis that is untimely. See Doc. No. 187 (declining to consider untimely damages 
contentions)."
1359,17," NTE has also failed to establish the second prong of predatory pricing, which is that there is a ""dangerous probability"" that 
Duke would be able to ""recoup"" its losses from unlawful below cost pricing after it excluded its competitors. ""If market "
1360,," circumstances or deficiencies in proof would bar a reasonable jury from finding that the scheme alleged would likely result in 
sustained supracompetitive pricing, the plaintiff's case has failed."" Brooke Grp., 509 U.S. at 226. Here, Duke not only had a long 
term contract with FPWC that prevented Duke from raising prices during the contract, but also there is no evidence that FPWC 
would be able to charge improperly increased prices to other customers (where there would be similar bidding, negotiation and 
regulation) to make up for ""losses"" at FPWC."
1360,18," At oral argument, NTE somewhat changed the thrust of its sham litigation argument, asserting that Duke's initial inclusion of 
two of NTE's executives as individual defendants was wrongful even if the lawsuit itself was not a ""sham."" However, both of the 
individual defendants were voluntarily dismissed on October 31, 2019, only approximately three weeks after NTE removed the 
action to this Court, and there is no evidence that the brief inclusion of these defendants caused any competitive harm."
1360,19," The falsity of this statement is disputed by Duke, which argues that during the time the project was listed as canceled in 
OASIS, the LGIA had in fact been canceled by Duke (even though that status was later changed back to suspended in May 
2020). "
1364,20," NTE maintains that it has satisfied the proximate cause requirement because the causation standard is low and that it need 
only prove that Duke's ""conduct was a substantial cause of [its injury]"" or the injury was the type Duke's ""conduct was naturally 
likely to cause."" See Am. Rockwool, Inc. v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 640 F. Supp. 1411, 1444-46 (E.D.N.C. 1986); Ellis 
v. Smith-Broadhurst, Inc., 48 N.C. App. 180, 268 S.E.2d 271, 273-74 (N.C. Ct. App. 1980). However, the Court finds NTE's cited 
cases easily distinguishable. In Ellis, the court found that there was some ""evidence that [the customer] was influenced by the 
alleged misrepresentations in their initial rejection of plaintiff's policy and that even after plaintiff attempted to correct the alleged 
misrepresentations, [the customer] continued to rely upon the comparison made by defendants."" 48 N.C. App. 180, 184, 268 
S.E.2d 271. And in Am. Rockwool, Inc., there was no question that the customers had knowledge of the defendant's 
disparagement of plaintiff's product and false statements about its own product even though the customers disclaimed reliance 
on the information. In contrast, NTE has been unable to identify a single potential customer that would otherwise have 
purchased electricity from NTE who was aware of the OASIS posting or Duke's intervention in the NCUC proceeding. "
1365,21," Duke is similarly not entitled to summary judgment on its claim that the LGIA requires that NTE place into escrow the amount 
that Duke claims that NTE owes under the LGIA. The Court agrees with NTE that, fairly read, the language of Article 12.4. on 
which Duke relies is intended only to provide security for a transmission provider to continue service in the event of a payment 
dispute rather than, as Duke argues, to require NTE to pay all disputed amounts into escrow even though Duke is no longer 
being asked to provide services to NTE on the suspended Reidsville project. "
1366,22," And, in any event the LGIA was reinstated in May 2020 after FERC ruled that Duke could not terminate the LGIA without 
FERC's approval."
1366,23," In fact, it appears that several of the alleged breaches may have already been resolved by FERC's ruling reinstating the LGIA; 
access to books, records and other information during discovery; mediations involving senior executives; etc. At the pretrial 
conference in this matter the Court will determine which of NTE's specific allegations of breach of contract still require 
adjudication."
1366,24," Further, there are other policy implications of disallowing NTE's responsive claims for breach of contract. The Court is 
concerned that a rule stating that the filing of a lawsuit prohibits a party from claiming breach of contract where notice had not 
yet been given might create harsh and perhaps unfair consequences for a defendant surprised by a lawsuit (for example here 
where no period of cure is required if a breach cannot be cured). Such a defendant would, according to Duke, both be unable to 
assert any counterclaims for breach of contract for lack of notice, but would also lose the ability to file its contractual claims 
separately because they would be compulsory counterclaims under Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a) (assuming the claims arose from the 
same conduct, which would be likely). "
1367,25," The Court further notes with respect to NTE's claims for breach of contract that a number of them, including NTE's claims of 
lack of authorization for purchases and costs and the lack of specificity in calculating suspension expenses, are at the heart of 
NTE's defenses to Duke's breach of contract claims. Therefore, the Court will at the pretrial conference explore with the parties 
whether the substance of NTE's claims would be most cogently presented to the jury as defenses rather than separate claims for 
breach of contract. "
1373,1," Although the parties intend for the motions to apply to both cases, they are filed on the docket of the Deslandes case."
1373,2, The other two counts were previously dismissed with prejudice. 
1375,3," Local Rule 56.1 outlines the requirements for the introduction of facts parties would like considered in connection with a motion 
for summary judgment. The Court enforces Local Rule 56.1 strictly. See FTC v. Bay Area Business Council, Inc., 423 F.3d 627, 
633 (7th Cir. 2005) (""Because of the important function local rules like Rule 56.1 serve in organizing the evidence and identifying 
disputed facts, we have consistently upheld the district court's discretion to require strict compliance with those rules.""). At the 
summary judgment stage, a party cannot rely on allegations; she or it must put forth evidence. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(1)(A); see also 
Grant v. Trustees of Indiana Univ., 870 F.3d 562, 568 (7th Cir. 2017) (""As the 'put up or shut up' moment in a lawsuit,' summary 
judgment requires a non-moving party to respond to the moving party's properly-supported motion by identifying specific, 
admissible evidence showing that there is a genuine dispute of material fact for trial.""). Where one party supports a fact with 
admissible evidence (i.e., not complaint allegations) and the other party fails to controvert the fact with citation to admissible 
evidence (i.e., not complaint allegations), the Court deems the fact admitted. See Curtis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 807 F.3d 
215, 218-19 (7th Cir. 2015); Ammons v. Aramark Uniform Servs., Inc., 368 F.3d 809, 817-18 (7th Cir. 2004). This does not, 
however, absolve the party putting forth the fact of the duty to support the fact with admissible evidence. See Keeton v.

1451,10," Defendants separately argue that an arrest for possession of drugs — and alleged lies regarding possession that Krauel made

1451,11," In its opposition, Altria argues that determining class membership raises predominant individualized inquiries because class 
members are unlikely to have ""objective proof"" of purchases. Altria. Oppo. at 29-30. This argument is a variant on 
ascertainability that the Ninth Circuit has determined is no stumbling block to certification. Briseno v. ConAgra Foods, Inc., 844

because consumers do not generally save grocery receipts and are unlikely to remember details about individual purchases of a

1456,15," Poulos was recently distinguished by another judge in this District who, in certifying a RICO misrepresentation and omissions

1458,19," JLI argues that the Steroid Hormone Prod. Cases decision is inapposite because there, class purchasers did not know the 
product was illegal, whereas here, many youth purchasers knew they were illegally purchasing JUUL. However, the inclusion of 
consumers who knew the product was illegal did not preclude certification of the CLRA claim in that case. Id. at 157 (""And even "
1459,," if there may be some people who bought androstenediol products from GNC with the knowledge that the products were unlawful 
to sell or possess in California without a prescription—and there is no evidence in the record that there are—their existence 
would not defeat class certification."")."
1459,20," JLI also argues that ""overwhelming majority"" of JLI advertising content according to plaintiffs and their experts did not appeal 
to youth. That argument may be accepted by the trier of fact. For present purposes, it ignores Emery's and Pratkanis's 
admissible-for-class-certification opinions that the initial youth-directed campaigns (including the explicit marketing content, the 
use of social media and influencers, the design of device, and the flavors offered) laid the seeds for the subsequent exponential 
growth in youth use and despite that changing content, the USP in the marketing remained consistent. See generally Emery 
Report [Dkt. No. 1772-22]; Supplemental Emery Report [Dkt. No. 2439-9]; Pratkanis Report [Dkt. No. 1772-20]; Pratkanis Reply 
Report [Dkt. No. 2439-10]. JLI may dispute those opinions, but they are admissible at this juncture. "
1460,21," Altria also argues that it cannot be held liable for plaintiffs' Youth Class full refund model because it is not alleged to have been 
part of the Youth Access Scheme. But its liability for any Youth Class damages is a common, classwide issue. Altria will be free 
at summary judgment, trial and/or post-trial to argue that its liability for specific claims should be reduced or cut-off at a specific 
point in time."
1460,22," Altria will be able to argue on summary judgment and at trial that it should not be directly liable under RICO because its 
conduct did not cause harm to plaintiffs (although conspiracy liability could remain) and that it should not be liable because the 
conduct that injured plaintiffs was completed by the time Altria joined the alleged RICO enterprise. See, e.g., Oki Semiconductor 
Co., 298 F.3d at 774 (rejecting direct liability for conspirator who laundered funds after robbery (the event that caused plaintiff's 
harm, but noting conspiracy liability remained); United States v. Lothian, 976 F.2d 1257, 1262 (9th Cir. 1992) (""a defendant 
cannot be held [criminally] liable for substantive offenses committed before joining or after withdrawing from a conspiracy"" but 
conspiracy liability remains). "
1461,23," In his Reply Report, Singer argues that alleged double counting is a non-issue because he bases his model in part on survey 
respondents' answers that would not likely include purchases for resale that disclose average patterns. See Singer Reply Rep. ¶ 
141; see also id. ¶¶ 152, 155 (Singer limited his youth data set to users 18 years old and younger when they made their 
purchases)."
1461,24," JLI's argument that Singer did not test for consumer preferences between the 5% pods and the 3% pods (that accounted for 
8% of the pods in the class period) and that some material difference between the two products means that the 3% pod sales 
should be removed from the damage models is at most an argument for cross-examination."
1461,25," I refer to Altria's and the ODDs' arguments to as being made by ""defendants."" The RICO arguments are joined by the other 
two RICO defendants, Monsees and Bowen. Dkt. Nos. 2314, 2315. "
1462,26," The ODDs' reliance on Tanedo v. E. Baton Rouge Par. Sch. Bd., 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 152329, 2011 WL 7095434, at *9 
(C.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2011) is not persuasive. That case did not acknowledge Bridge's holding that first-person reliance was not 
required for RICO claims based on mail or wire fraud and addressed allegations that recruiter defendants failed to disclose the 
existence of a second set of recruitment fees that some class members ""may have been willing to pay [] for a chance to teach in 
the United States, to reunite with family members in the United States, or to leave the Philippines."" "
1463,27," Altria separately argues that because ""many"" class members started using JUUL products before Spring 2017 when Altria was 
alleged to have joined the conspiracy, and 97 out of 100 plaintiffs identified in Defendants' Appendix A started using JUUL 
products before Altria's December 2018 formal investment in JLI, few plaintiffs could have ""relied"" on anything Altria did. Altria 
Oppo. at 14. To the extent this is an attribution of damages argument, that is addressed above. To the extent Altria characterizes 
this as a failure of proximate cause, with respect to Altria's conduct, its reliance on Oki Semiconductor Co. 298 F.3d at 774 is 
inapposite. There, the Ninth Circuit concluded that the ""direct and proximate cause"" of plaintiff's loss was not the alleged co-
conspirator's acts of money laundering, it was the theft that occurred before, and therefore while the money launderer's role was 
""important"" it was not a ""substantial factor in the sequence of responsible causation."" Id. Here, while Altria is directly implicated 
in only three of the five interrelated racketeering schemes, its role is arguably a ""substantial factor"" in the sequence of 
responsible causation. "
1464,28," In Badella, the complaint's allegations centered wholly on affirmative misrepresentations necessarily made directly to each 
purported class member. 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 128145, [WL] at *7. Here, however, the nature of the scheme alleged implicates 
direct and indirect reliance, considering the manner in which plaintiffs contend JLI created viral social media campaigns as well 
as its more traditional media campaigns that (disputedly) focused on youth and conveyed the product as a high-tech lifestyle 
product without disclosing its dangers. "
1465,29," Altria cites a number of unremarkable cases holding that consumers who did not see misrepresentations until after suffering 
injury or who continued to purchase product after they learned of the fraud could not show that defendants' misrepresentations 
were a cause of their injury. Altria Oppo. at 21-22. As noted above, here injury occurs at the time a class member purchased a 
JUUL product and, as relevant for the California claims (but arguably not for the RICO claims), each of the proposed class 
representatives has testified that she or he saw JUUL marketing before their first purchase. Whether class members would have 
continued purchasing product but for their first purchases is a disputed matter subject to expert testimony as well as individual 
testimony. This argument presents no bar to certification and is more appropriately addressed on summary judgment, at trial, or 
post-trial. "
1466,30," As to the claims arising under California law, plaintiffs assert that because the alleged harm is overpayment for the product as 
a result of defendant's conduct, the doctrine cannot apply because class members did not engage in the same conduct. See, 
e.g., Casey v. U.S. Bank Nat. Assn., 127 Cal. App. 4th 1138, 1143 n.1, 26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 401 (Cal. App. 4 Dist. 2005) (""'The 
doctrine of in pari delicto dictates that when a participant in illegal, fraudulent, or inequitable conduct seeks to recover from 
another participant in that conduct, the parties are deemed in pari delicto, and the law will aid neither, but rather, will leave them 
where it finds them."" (quoting Smith ex rel. Boston v. Arthur Andersen L.L.P., 175 F. Supp. 2d 1180, 1198 (D. Ariz. 2001))."
1466,31," Dumas v. Major League Baseball Properties, Inc., 104 F. Supp. 2d 1220, 1223 (S.D. Cal. 2000), aff'd sub nom. Chaset v. 
Fleer/Skybox Intern., LP, 300 F.3d 1083 (9th Cir. 2002) (where there was no allegation of fraudulent conduct by defendants that 
caused plaintiffs harm, the fact that defendants' conduct — selling a pack of cards with a chance to win — might be construed as 
""illegal gambling"" under state law did not injure plaintiffs in their business or property to confer RICO standing); Adell v. Macon 
County Greyhound Park, Inc., 785 F. Supp. 2d 1226, 1239-40 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (""Hence, even if the chance to win that Plaintiffs 
paid for was illegal under state law, such illegality in and of itself would not transform Plaintiffs' gambling losses into civil RICO 
property losses,"" and noting plaintiffs ""fail to plead facts connecting the alleged rigging of any electronic bingo machine (i.e., the 
alleged fraudulent and dishonest conduct) to an injury suffered by them.""). "
1467,32," Finally, Altria argues that class members who continued to purchase JUUL after learning of the alleged fraud ""failed to 
mitigate"" their RICO damages. Altria Oppo. at 22 n.26. Altria acknowledges that the Ninth Circuit has not addressed whether 
mitigation is a defense to a RICO claim, id., and I will not consider this theory as a reason to deny class certification."
1467,33," In re Tobacco II Cases, 46 Cal. 4th 298, 93 Cal. Rptr. 3d 559, 207 P.3d 20 (2009)."
1467,34, The California Youth Class claim under the UCL requires a separate analysis below.
1467,35," Defendants contend and plaintiffs do not dispute that the three named plaintiffs put forward to represent the two California 
classes must eventually prove actual reliance on defendants' affirmative misrepresentations and the materiality of omitted 
information to have standing on behalf of the class under the fraud-based UCL, FAL and CLRA causes of action. Walker, 953 
F.3d at 630 (""The California Supreme Court interpreted this statute to mean that named plaintiffs, but not absent ones, must 
show proof of 'actual reliance' at the certification stage.'""). The ODDs argue that such actual reliance must be proved, as 
opposed to alleged, at the class certification stage. Plaintiffs, however, have adduced sufficient proof for this juncture. See supra 
(noting plaintiffs' reliance on named plaintiffs' interrogatory responses to support reliance at the class certification stage). While 
defendants point to deposition testimony in an attempt to show that C.D. and L.B. gave contradictory or inconsistent testimony 
about what they saw and relied on, those cites do not definitely resolve the question and create at most a dispute of material fact 
that can be explored at trial. "
1468,36," Disputes about how much social media content was from JLI or sponsored by JLI — or was the result of third-party conduct 
not under JLI's control — likewise do not defeat predominance. JLI will be free to cross-examine Emery or any of plaintiffs' other 
experts to determine whether they distinguish the impact of JLI-controlled or sponsored content from third-party content and, if 
not why not. As discussed at various points in this Order, the parties dispute whether Emery was required to separately analyze 
JLI's own social media content versus third-party content. Part of Emery's opinion supported by the references she relies on and 
her research is that a main purpose of corporate use of social media to introduce and market a product is to spur third-party 
content to create the viral response JUUL allegedly achieved."
1468,37," JLI relies on Colman v. Theranos, Inc., 325 F.R.D. 629, 644 (N.D. Cal. 2018). There, where an alleged securities 
misinformation campaign was at issue, the court declined to apply the presumption of reliance on multiple grounds. One was 
that the ""campaign"" lasted less than two years. Id. at 644. The court found that comparable to ""the roughly three-year campaign"" 
that was insufficient in Mazza v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 666 F.3d 581 (9th Cir. 2012); the 16—month advertising campaign that 
was insufficient in In re Clorox Consumer Litigation, 301 F.R.D. 436, 439 (N.D. Cal. 2014); the two-and-one-half-year advertising "
1469,," period in In re MyFord Touch Consumer Litig., No. 13-cv-03072-EMC, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 179487, 2016 WL 7734558, at *22 
(N.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2016); and the one-year class period in Ehret v. Uber Techs., Inc., 148 F. Supp. 3d 884 (N.D. Cal. 2015). 
However, in each of those cases, the Tobacco II presumption was rejected for a number of reasons beyond the mere duration of 
the advertising campaigns. For example, the Colman court also relied on the fact that plaintiffs offered ""little evidence to suggest 
that the nature of Theranos's publicity campaign warrants a presumption of exposure and reliance."" 325 F.R.D. at 644-45. Here, 
there is ample disputed evidence. In Ehret, the court did not rely solely on the duration of the campaign but also rejected the 
claim based on the manner in which Uber advertised the challenged 20% gratuity representations. Id. at 900-901 (no evidence 
class was ""highly likely"" to have been exposed where many Uber users may have never visited the website or blogs were the 
misrepresentation was made and even if they did the actionable language was not highly visible). Finally, the campaigns at issue 
in this case lasted at least four years (through Chandler's 2019 reach estimates), although defendants dispute the consistency of 
those campaigns and whether any USP flows from the different campaigns over those years."
1469,38," For example, JLI contends that Pratkanis admitted that later advertisements did not look like the earlier advertisements. JLI 
Oppo. at 33. But Pratkanis testified that even though words and terms changed in various advertisements (e.g., ""Vaporized"" was 
followed by ""Smoking Evolved"") the advertisements still carried the same implication that the product was ""good for your 
lifestyle"" and were still part of the ""overall marketing communications to drive home that what we have called the unique selling 
proposition."" July 15, 2021, Deposition Transcript of Dr. Anthony Pratkanis [Dkt. No. 2310-4] at 330-335. Defendants' cases 
recognize — assuming the trier of fact agrees with Pratkanis and plaintiffs' other experts — that where advertisements are 
""similar enough"" in the material aspects, the presumption of reliance can apply. See Opperman v. Path, Inc., 87 F. Supp. 3d 
1018, 1050 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (""if a plaintiff alleges a long-term advertising campaign, the advertisements at issue should be 
similar enough to be considered as part of one campaign, or the delivery of a single message or set of messages, rather than a 
disparate set of advertising content published in the ordinary course of commerce.""); but see Campion v. Old Republic Home 
Protec. Co., Inc., 272 F.R.D. 517, 538 (S.D. Cal. 2011) rejecting presumption of reliance where plaintiffs alleged defendants 
made different types of misrepresentations and the misrepresentations were made through materially different means). "
1471,39," Nor is this a case like Philips v. Ford Motor Co., 14-CV-02989-LHK, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 177672, 2016 WL 7428810, at *16 
(N.D. Cal. Dec. 22, 2016), aff'd, 726 Fed. Appx. 608 (9th Cir. 2018) (unpublished). There, looking not to the general mix of 
information in the marketplace but to defendant's own affirmative warning about the alleged defect plaintiffs sued over, the court 
declined to find a presumption of reliance sufficient for class certification under the CLRA. Other than the mid-2018 black box 
nicotine warning — the meaning and efficacy of which is disputed by plaintiffs — JLI points to no disclosures by JLI regarding 
the addictiveness of their particular product or disclosures regarding the way nicotine was delivered by their particular product 
that would undermine a presumption of reliance on JLI's own misrepresentations or the materiality of the information JLI omitted 
to disclose. "
1472,40," Defendants do not directly engage with plaintiffs' omission-based theory in support of certification of their California classes. 
Materiality for the omissions-based claim is established, for purposes of class certification, based on the same presumption of 
reliance sufficient for the misrepresentation-based claims. "
1473,41," Defendants argue briefly that online purchasers would not have been exposed to any product labelling prior to their online 
purchases and, therefore, the presumption of reliance cannot extend to them and they should be excised from the classes. JLI 
Oppo. at 37. Given the context and record in this case — especially considering that class members were typically repeat 
purchasers of a product whose sole purpose is the delivery of nicotine — that some online purchasers may not have viewed the 
package prior to one or more purchases is not significant at this juncture (although possibly relevant to damages or restitution). 
JLI's large item or one-time purchasing cases where the representations are not received until post sale are not persuasive. See 
Daniel v. Ford Motor Co., 806 F.3d 1217 (9th Cir. 2015) (where misrepresentations contained in documents provided post-sale); 
McCrary v. Elations Co., LLC, EDCV 13-00242 JGB OP, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8443, 2014 WL 1779243, at *11 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 
13, 2014) (excising online purchasers of supplement from class definition). "
1474,42," Defendants' reliance on In re Vioxx Class Cases, 180 Cal. App. 4th 116, 134, 103 Cal. Rptr. 3d 83 (Cal. App. 2 Dist. 2009) is 
perplexing. There, classwide materiality could not be shown given that the benefits of Vioxx for those with gastrointestinal risk 
outweighed the risks from cardiovascular death (and given the role of doctors in prescribing Vioxx that interrupted any showing 
of materiality as to the end consumer). Here, defendants do not identify any evidence — expert or otherwise — of a particular 
benefit to their product that outweighs the undisclosed risks challenged by plaintiffs. That an existing smoker might want to use 
JUUL to ween herself off cigarettes and decrease the health risks from traditional tobacco will obviously be important to those 
class members, but had the undisclosed risks that plaintiffs have shown been disclosed, those existing-smokers could have 
selected a different product to help them. "
1478,43," Plaintiffs will present class-wide proof of damages as to adult Class Members, using a price premium calculation methodology 
and class-wide proof of damages as to youth Class Members, using a full refund calculation methodology. Similar proof will be 
provided to the court for determination of restitution and/or disgorgement. Id. at 4-6."
1478,44," Under the proposed Claims Administration Protocol, plaintiffs propose that class members will submit information to 
substantiate their membership in particular classes and their right to compensatory damages, restitution, and/or disgorgement 
under the verdict. Id. at 7. "
1479,45," JLI points to studies that establish ""frequent product misidentification of e-cigarettes"" amongst consumers. JLI Oppo. at 61-62. 
There is no evidence that JUUL products — that to this point neither side has disputed have a very unique and obvious design 
— are included in that consumer confusion regarding brands of e-cigarettes. If such evidence is adduced, the claims process 
could address it in a number of ways."
1479,46, Altria relies on inapposite authorities outside the Ninth Circuit. Altria Oppo. at 31.
1479,47," In the alternative, plaintiffs request certification under Rule 23(c)(4) for any issues that can be resolved on a classwide basis. 
Defendants object to consideration of certification of discrete liability-only issues because plaintiffs fail to identify what issues 
would be appropriate for classwide resolution and certification of unspecified liability issues would be unlikely to materially "
1480,," advance dispositive of the litigation. I need not consider the Rule 23(c)(4) argument because I find that plaintiffs have satisfied 
the requirements for certification under Rule 23(b)(3)."
1480,48," Each defendant filed a joinder in JLI's Omnibus Daubert Motion. See Dkt. Nos. 2314, 2315, 2327, 2397. "
1482,49, JLI's arguments regarding Shihadeh's merits opinions about abuse liability are not appropriately addressed here. 
1483,50," JLI's cases regarding intent are particularly unhelpful as they discuss situations where intent is irrelevant, where the purported 
expert's intent opinions were not based on sufficient facts or expertise, or where intent was a question of fact for the jury. See, 
e.g., Stone Brewing Co., LLC v. MillerCoors LLC, No. 18-CV-00331-BEN-LL, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32010, 2020 WL 907060, at 
*4 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2020) (quoting In re Rezulin Prods. Liab. Litig., 309 F. Supp. 2d 531, 546 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)); In re Twitter, 
Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 16-CV-05314-JST, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 252718, 2020 WL 9073168, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 20, 2020). As the 
Court in Stone Brewing recognized, ""'courts in the Ninth Circuit have allowed such expert testimony about the actions and 
motivations of a party when based on industry experience and the review of record evidence.'"" 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 32010, 
2020 WL 907060, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2020) (quoting United Food and Com. Workers Local 1776 v. Teikoku Pharma USA, 
296 F. Supp. 3d 1142, 1194 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (allowing expert testimony about ""intent"" of parties based on a review of record 
evidence and public-facing statements made where an expert had insights due to experience in the industry)). "
1484,51," JLI does not explain why although USP is typically used to formulate and develop marketing campaigns (a point not disputed 
by plaintiffs), the same concept cannot be identified by analyzing the content of developed marketing campaigns based on the 
campaigns' actual consumer-facing advertisements and internal company records. The parties dispute whether Pratkanis 
considered actual, consumer-facing marketing materials and an adequate number of JLI internal documents as part of 
identifying the USP. To the extent that dispute exists — or as plaintiffs argue is merely a mischaracterization based on where in 
his Report Pratkanis listed his references — it can be explored on cross-examination. The full list of references and materials 
identified in his Report appears to be adequate at this juncture. "
1485,52," JLI relies heavily on a decision from this District, where Pratkanis was an expert on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission. 
Fed. Trade Comm'n v. DIRECTV, Inc., No. 15-CV-01129-HSG, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139192, 2018 WL 3911196 (N.D. Cal. 
Aug. 16, 2018). The court following a bench trial found that Pratkanis's ""social influence analysis"" was unpersuasive on the 
question of whether a reasonable consumer likely would be misled because Pratkanis did not perform empirical testing of how 
consumers perceived the challenged advertisements, did not analyze defendant's advertisements to determine their net 
impression, or do any content analysis that would support his approach generalizing his opinions to all of the advertisements 
over the eight-year period at issue. With respect to the advertisements that Pratkanis analyzed, the court found them not 
misleading because the ""true terms are adequately and accurately disclosed in the advertisements Dr. Pratkanis testified about."" 
2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139192, [WL] at *11-12. The main reason this case is not persuasive — in addition to the fact that the 
claims were tested under federal law — is that those conclusions were drawn on a full factual record following trial. Pratkanis's 
opinions were not excluded but were determined not to be persuasive to the trier of fact because only a ""small fraction"" of the 
challenged advertisements were analyzed and the FTC failed to ""articulate what common net impression is conveyed by the 
over 40,000 challenged advertisements (which spanned several different formats), or to explain how and why that impression 
would be likely to mislead a reasonable consumer."" 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 139192, [WL] at *5. The posture of this case, the 
amount of advertising campaigns considered by Pratkanis, and the need to consider case-specific content undermine JLI's 
reliance on that case. "
1487,53," Similarly, whether or not Emery was analyzing marketing materials presented to her during her deposition within the context of 
the MSA (that addressed youth-content akin to inclusion of cartoons) or more broadly testified that the specific materials did not 
on their face have broader youth-appeal can be explored on cross-examination."
1487,54," This is not contrary to the question addressed in Colgate where, on a motion to dismiss and in determining whether plaintiffs 
had adequately alleged instances of actionable misrepresentations and otherwise unfair conduct underlying their UCL claims, I 
rejected the theory that JLI could be liable based solely on third-party content under a ratification/agency theory. But see 
Colgate, 402 F. Supp. 3d at 760 (rejecting plaintiffs ""claim that JUUL ratified the unfair and unlawful conduct of third parties that 
were promoting and selling its products to minors and is vicariously liable for those acts""). The evidence and expert testimony 
presented by Emery arises in a significantly different posture and addresses a significantly different scenario in support of 
plaintiffs' youth marketing claims; that JLI is liable for its own youth marketing conduct that allegedly was intended to and did 
create a viral response particularly but not exclusively through social media channels. "
1488,55," For the Addiction-Risk survey under the traditional method, Singer calculated the average discount that consumers would 
require to make them indifferent between the increase in addictiveness from ""as addictive as"" to ""twice as addictive as"" as $6.01 
for a package of four JUULpods, whose retail price is $15.99. Id. ¶ 37. For the Safety-Risk survey under the traditional method, 
Singer calculated the discount a consumer would ""require to compensate for disutility experienced from the information 
communicated by the disclaimer,"" at an average discount of $3.98 for a package of four JUULpods, whose retail price is $15.99. 
Id. ¶ 39."
1488,56," Singer estimated damages using five elements — (1) the total number of electronic cigarette users under 18 years old, as 
reported by the [National Youth Tobacco Survey, conducted by the FDA]; (2) the proportion of total electronic cigarette users 
under 18 who used JUUL specifically; (3) the proportion of JUUL users under 18 who made their own JUUL purchases; (4) the 
average annual consumption of JUUL users under 18 who made their own JUUL purchases; and (5) JUUL product prices. Id. ¶ 
61. He gathered data response to items (2) through (4) from responses to a survey between 18 and 23 years old who indicated 
they used e-cigarettes before they turned 18 years old. Id. ¶ 62. "
1489,57," As a result of the revised survey, only 20% (as opposed to 40% in the prior round) of respondents ""appeared to express a 
preference for safety risk, relative to a product represented to be safe and healthy."" Id. ¶ 9 n.17."
1489,58," In allowing defendants to file supplemental reports responding to Singer's Reply Report, I instructed them that ""no briefing 
addressing the supplemental defense or Singer sur-reply reports will be allowed."" Dkt. No. 2496. Nonetheless, JLI referred to the 
Supplemental Reports by Murphy and Rossi in their Reply in support of the Omnibus Daubert. Plaintiffs objected to that, as well 
as to JLI's citation for the first time to eight of plaintiffs' merits reports, which were not referenced in plaintiffs' opposition to JLI's 
Omnibus Motion. Dkt. No. 2545. "
1490,59," JLI notes that the ""labels"" used for Singer's Addiction-Risk survey — asking about products ""a quarter as addictive"" or ""half as 
addictive"" relative to ""about 1 pack of cigarettes"" — are not used in plaintiffs' complaints or defined by Singer himself. JLI also 
contends that this concept of relative addictiveness was disclaimed by plaintiffs' nicotine expert Dr. Shihadeh. However, claims 
about undisclosed nicotine content and uptake are included in the operative class complaint. Moreover, the ""approximately 
equivalent to 1 pack of cigarettes"" was used by JLI on its packaging, presumably because it gave consumers who smoked 
cigarettes a readily understood comparison. Finally, Shihadeh was not opining on Singer's use of that concept for his addiction-
risk survey to estimate damages. Instead, he questioned the use of some kind of ""numerical scale"" for addictiveness. He 
admitted only that he could not fully evaluate those sorts of disclaimers without seeing the full context. July 22, 2021, Deposition 
of Alan Shihadeh (""Shihadeh Depo. Tr."") [Dkt. No. 2310-1] at 282-285. "
1491,60," Defendants' expert, Rossi, is relied on in this section of JLI's Omnibus Motion to argue that by using Qualtrics and Qualtrics' 
""proprietary Hierarchical Bayesian model,"" Singer did not have adequate control over to control the accuracy and reliability of the 
results. Rossi Report ¶¶ 147-148. Rossi's only opinion why that process produced unreliable results, however, is his opinion that 
""Dr. Singer's estimates of individuals' utilities exhibit irrationality and inconsistencies with market data."" Id. ¶ 148. But Rossi does 
not tie the evidence of irrationality and inconsistency to alleged deficiencies in the way Qualtrics administered the surveys or 
obvious deficiencies in Qualtrics' use of the Hierarchical Bayesian model. The alleged irrationality and inconsistencies JLI and 
Rossi discuss are alleged results of the design of the surveys and Singer's handling of the resulting data. "
1492,61," JLI's cases are readily distinguishable. See Kwan Software Eng'g, Inc. v. Foray Techs., LLC, C 12-03762 SI, 2014 U.S. Dist.

19."
1492,63," As Singer points out in reply, if JLI's claim that public perception of health risks of e-cigarettes has shifted over time, testing 
back in 2015 when the risks of e-cigarettes were less well-known and publicized would have likely led to greater damages. At 
most, Singer's current measures of assumed past behavior leads to more conservative damage estimates. Singer Reply Report 
at 16. "

Ed. 2d 392 (2014)) to indicate that the Seventh Circuit has ""eschewed"" the term ""antitrust standing"" in favor of ""proximate 
causation."" Because many of the cited cases use the term ""antitrust standing,"" in this analysis, both terms are held to refer to the

the October 2019 agreement she signed with Black. Opp. at 15. "
1534,15," As the Court notes in its opinion dismissing Black's FAC, such allegations suffer from a lack of ripeness, because the 
Complaint's allegations as to the fees it has incurred defending against Ganieva's action are not yet clear and definite. See, e.g.,

1536,17," The Seventh and the Ninth Circuits have so held. See, e.g., Sosa v. DIRECTV Inc., 437 F.3d 923, 942 (9th Cir. 2006); Int'l 
Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 734 Health & Welfare Tr. Fund v. Philip Morris Inc., 196 F.3d 818, 826 (7th Cir. 1999) (""Although the

anything in connection with its representation of Ms. Ganieva."" Mot. at 10 (emphasis in original). Limited as it is to historical 
payments, that studied construction does not eliminate the possibility of any understanding as to future payments."
1538,20," Wigdor separately urges that sanctions may be warranted based on the conversation in which—according to Mr. Gershenoff—
Mr. Carlinsky of Quinn Emanuel allegedly offered to drop the RICO claims against Wigdor with prejudice if Wigdor provided 
information connecting Ganieva to the Funder. Reply at 2-3. If credited, this account might support that Quinn Emanuel lacked 
factual conviction in its RICO claims against Wigdor—or, less troubling, that Quinn Emanuel regarded information about Ganieva 
and the Funder as so valuable as to be worth trading away these claims, In all events, Quinn Emanuel contests Mr. Gershenoff's 
account, Dkt. 66-1, and the Court cannot reliably resolve this swearing contest. "

1543,5," Asquith & Parak use the terms loan cost and loan price interchangeably. (ECF No. 414-10 at 32 ¶67, 32 ¶ 81). "
1549,6," Plaintiffs define a ""U.S. Stock Loan Transaction"" as ""a daily position involving the lending or borrowing of a stock listed on the 
NYSE, NYSE American, NASDAQ, NYSE Arca, or Bats exchanges, according to the CRSP U.S. Stock Database, at a Loan 
Cost that is positive on the date when the loan or borrow is initiated, except for any transaction made under an exclusive "
1550,," contract (i.e., contracts where the lender offers inventory to a broker dealer for a flat fee)."" (ECF No. 412 at 14 n.10). Plaintiffs 
define ""Loan Cost"" as ""the price of borrowing, reflected as an annualized rate, equivalent to either (1) for cash-collateralized 
transactions, the Federal Funds Open Rate, Overnight Bank Funding Rate, or other benchmark minus the rebate rate paid by 
the lender to the borrower; or (2) for non-cash collateralized transactions, the fee rate paid by the borrower to the lender."" (Id.) 
Defendants do not dispute or offer an opposing definition (see ECF No. 431), so the Court adopts these definitions for purposes 
of the Motion."
1550,7," Plaintiffs define a ""Hard-to-Borrow"" as ""one whose Loan Cost is more than 10 basis points above (1) for positions held prior to 
September 16, 2016, the Federal Funds Open Rate or (2) for positions held on or after September 16, 2016, the Overnight Bank 
Funding Rate."" (ECF 412 n.11). Defendants do not dispute or offer an opposing definition (see ECF No. 431), so the Court 
adopts these definitions for purposes of the Motion."
1550,8," For purposes of the Proposed Class, ""Defendant"" ""means any entity in which a Defendant or its parent, subsidiary, or wholly 
owned affiliate is a majority owner or holds a majority beneficial interest. Not included is any investment company or pooled 
investment fund (including mutual fund families, exchange-traded funds, fund of funds and hedge funds) in which any Defendant 
has or may have a direct or indirect interest, or as to which its affiliate may act as investment advisors, unless the Defendant or 
any of its affiliates is a majority owner or holds a majority beneficial interest in the fund. The term 'Defendant' does not 
encompass a Defendant acting as an agent or on behalf of an unrelated entity."" (ECF No. 412 at 14 n.12). "

1563,12," Plaintiffs have also asserted an unjust enrichment claim (ECF No. 73 ¶¶ 395-97), but acknowledge that that claim ""rises or 
falls with the antitrust claim,"" see IPERS, 340 F. Supp. 3d at 337, and argue that certification is warranted as to both claims for 
the same reasons. (ECF No. 412 at 17 n.19). Defendants do not dispute the similarity and do not separately address the unjust 
enrichment claim. (ECF No. 431). The Court similarly focuses on Plaintiffs' antitrust claim in analyzing the elements of Rule 23. "
1570,13," The exact end date differs between Plaintiffs' opening brief and their reply - their opening brief proposed February 22, 2021, 
whereas the reply proposed February 21, 2021. (Compare ECF No. 412 at 14 with ECF No. 469 at 44). Because Plaintiffs filed 
the Motion on February 21, 2021, the Court uses that date as the end of the Proposed Class Period. "
1575,*, This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not constitute binding precedent.
1575,1, SEI does not challenge the District Court's dismissal of its New York law claims its or request for a declaratory judgment. 
1576,2," Similar claims are being litigated by the parties in New York state court. See Advent Software, Inc. v. SEI Glob. Servs. Inc.,

could cause marketwide harm to other participants in the relevant market and their customers."" Op. Br. at 44. But as we 
explained, SS&C does not allege facts suggesting this harm is imminent or realistic. "
1578,4," SEI argues that, in reaching this conclusion, the District Court impermissibly substituted its own reading and ignored other facts 
alleged in its Second Amended Complaint. Not so. The Court, rather, followed where SEI's allegations lead it. "
1582,1," Unless otherwise indicated, citations to docket items refer to filings in Civil Action No. 1:20-cv-1076."
1582,2," J M Smith Corporation d/b/a Smith Drug Company and KPH Healthcare Services, Inc. a/k/a Kinney Drugs, Inc. filed the

Firefighters' Association. D.I. 136."
1582,4," Although the Retailers' actions have been consolidated, the Retailers have not filed a consolidated complaint. There are three 
operative complaints in the Retailers' action: No. 1:20-cv-1086, D.I. 1, filed by CVS Pharmacy, Inc., Rite Aid Corp., and Rite Aid 
Hdqtrs. Corp.; No. 1:20-cv-1087, D.I. 1, filed by Walgreen Co., The Kroger Co., Albertsons Companies, Inc., and H-E-B, L.P.; 
and No. 1:20-cv-1089, D.I. 1 filed by Hy-Vee Inc."
1582,5," To be precise, certain Plaintiffs claim that they are in certain instances the assignee of claims based on purchases made by 
various assignors. See, e.g., 20-1087, D.I. 1 ¶¶ 28-31. The fact that a purchase was made by a Plaintiff or its assignor has no 
bearing on the pending motions and, accordingly, for ease of discussion, I refer only to Plaintiffs in this Memorandum Opinion. "
1585,6," The allegations in the five operative complaints are largely the same and, therefore, following the parties' lead, I refer only to 
the Direct Purchasers' operative complaint unless a difference of significance among the complaints exists."
1585,7," The Retailers do not allege Handa's right to buy generic product from AstraZeneca. 20-1086, D.I. 1 ¶ 15; 20-1087, D.I. 1 ¶ 15; 
20-1089, D.I. 1 ¶ 15 . "
1586,8," The Direct Purchasers define their Class Period as being from August 2, 2015 ""until the effects of Defendants' conduct 
ceases."" D.I. 135 ¶ 43. The Retailers allege that they are ""absent class members"" of the Direct Purchasers' putative class ""[b]y 
virtue of their assignments [from various drug wholesalers],"" and they base their claims on purchases they made during the 
same time span covered by the Direct Purchasers' Class Period. See 20-1086, D.I. 1 ¶ 129; 20-1087, D.I. 1 ¶ 131; 20-1089, D.I. "
1587,1," ¶ 128. The End-Payors allege that their Class Period started on September 5, 2013 and continues ""until the anticompetitive 
effects of Defendants' challenged conduct cease."" D.I. 136 ¶ 223. The starting dates of the Class Periods have no bearing on 
the resolution of the pending motions. "
1588,9," The Retailers state in their brief that Smith Drug filed its complaint on August 3, 2019. D.I. 147 at 4. The complaint, however, 
was filed on August 2, 2019. See D.I. 1 at 67."
1588,10," The Retailers had alleged in their operative complaints that Defendants fraudulently concealed the Handa/AstraZeneca and 
Accord/AstraZeneca agreements and that this concealment should permit Plaintiffs to recover for the supracompetitve 
purchases of Seroquel XR® they made before August 2, 2015. 20-1086, D.I. 1 ¶ 130; 20-1087, D.I. 1 ¶ 132; 20-1089, D.I. 1 ¶ 
129. The Retailers, however, have withdrawn their fraudulent concealment allegations, see D.I. 147 at 4, and therefore I do not 
address Defendants' arguments regarding fraudulent concealment. "
1595,11," I use ""consumer protection"" throughout as shorthand for the set of state statutes under which the End-Payors bring their 
""Fourth Claim for Relief' titled ""Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices."" D.I. 136 ¶¶ 277-79. "
1604,12," Defendants also argue in their briefing that ""[i]f this case is to proceed past Rule 12(b)(6), the per se allegations should be 
dismissed, and rule of reason applied."" D.I. 138 at 21. As an initial matter, Plaintiffs do not bring any per se antitrust claim, so 
there is no claim to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). With regards to the ""per se allegations"" made in the operative complaints, ""[p]er 
se and rule-of-reason analysis are but two methods of determining whether a restraint is 'unreasonable,' i.e., whether its 
anticompetitive effects outweigh its procompetitive effects."" Atl. Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U.S. 328, 342, 110 S. 
Ct. 1884, 109 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1990) (footnote omitted); see Eichorn v. AT & T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 138 (3d Cir. 2001), as 
amended (June 12, 2001) (""Once there is the finding of antitrust injury, courts examine the alleged illegal conduct under one of 
two distinct tests: per se violation or rule of reason.""). The Third Circuit has explained that ""[t]he Federal Rules do not require a 
plaintiff to set out a legal theory at the pleadings stage, and courts have upheld a complaint against a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to 
dismiss even though the plaintiff appeared to rely on an inappropriate theory."" Andrews v. Monroe Cnty. Transit Auth., 523 F. 
App'x 889, 891 (3d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). Thus, even if Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs are attempting to invoke 
improperly an antitrust theory, I need not address this potential error now. See Bartholet v. Reishauer A.G. (Zurich), 953 F.2d 
1073, 1078 (7th Cir. 1992) (""[A] complaint need not identify a legal theory, and specifying an incorrect theory is not fatal.""). "
1608,1," Unlike Bard, the Court does not read AngioDynamics's motion as seeking to limit Ms. Sucy's testimony ""to the narrow subject 
matter of the 'use of Bard's Sherlock 3CG stylets pre-loaded with Bard's PICCs.'"" (Dkt. No. 292, at 4 (quoting Dkt. No. 255-1, at 
9)). "
1609,2," Ms. Sucy testified at her deposition that she does not intend to ""offer an expert conclusion based on [her] experience . . . of 
trying to load a Bard TLS Stylet into a Bioflow PICC"" and that her ""opinion was already formed."" (Dkt. No. 255-3, at 9). "
1610,3, AngioDynamics does not challenge these opinions.
1610,4," Bard represents that ""Dr. Feigal does not purport to resolve the question of whether safety concerns were Bard's only or even 
primary motivation for deciding not to launch the standalone stylet to the full market."" (Dkt. No. 293, at 6). "
1611,5," The Court does not address Bard's argument that AngioDynamics seeks to ""re-litigate an issue this Court already decided 
against AngioDynamics at summary judgment."" (Dkt. No. 298, at 11-12). "
1612,6," AngioDynamics also faults Dr. Scott Morton for failing to consider that Bard's submissions to the FDA ""addressed"" some of the 
safety and health risks associated with selling the 3CG stylet separately. (Dkt. No. 263-1, at 15-16). The fact that Bard received 
FDA clearance to market the 3CG stylet separately, however, is not determinative of what costs are associated with selling the 
stylet separately and any failure on Dr. Scott Morton's part to consider Bard's statements to the FDA does not necessarily render 
Dr. Scott Morton's opinion unreliable. "
1613,7," Since AngioDynamics's reasons for bringing this lawsuit are inadmissible, the Court rejects Bard's suggestion that evidence of 
AngioDynamics's strategy is necessary to refute an assertion by AngioDynamics that its motivations were altruistic."
1613,8," At the final pretrial conference, AngioDynamics stated that there are 116 documents on Bard's exhibit list on this issue. "
1614,9," AngioDynamics also argues that Bard's expert Dr. Bell should be ""precluded from speculating regarding the counterfactual 
situation"" in which AngioDynamics had developed a navigation-enabled TLS because Dr. Bell's calculation was exclusively 
based on Dr. Frankel's Benchmark 1 analysis, which this Court has excluded. (Dkt. No. 273-1, at 15). However, while Dr. Bell 
only performed his mitigation calculation as to Dr. Frankel's Benchmark 1 analysis, he expressly ""reserve[d] the right to calculate 
reduction in damages based on mitigation for other Indicators or measures of damages."" (Dkt. No. 290-13, ¶¶ 141-43 & n.261). "
1615,10," AngioDynamics does not seek to preclude evidence which is ""tethered to actual customer-based experience in the PICC 
market,"" such as evidence of a particular hospital's reliance on clinical evidence in connection with its purchasing decision. (Dkt. 
No. 280-1, at 5 & n.2)."
1615,11," At oral argument, counsel for AngioDynamics represented that AngioDynamics does not intend to call Stephanie Pitts to testify 
regarding particular hospitals' experience with BioFlo. "
1616,12," Accordingly, the Court does not rule on the admissibility of Ms. Rissler's opinions regarding clinical evidence and testing at this 
time. See infra Section IV.G. "
1617,13," Although Bard cites the deposition testimony of Scott Centea (AngioDynamics's 30(b)(6) deponent) as ""confirming that the 
interrogatory response was the universe of hospitals in dispute in this case,"" (Dkt. No. 323, at 4), Mr. Centea testified that he 
was ""sure there are other customers"" from which AngioDynamics lost sales ""that are not listed on [the supplemental 
interrogatory response],"" but that he could not ""name them,"" (Dkt. No. 323-8, at 4-5)."
1617,14," The Court notes that Bard has included Exhibits P-435 and P-438 on its own exhibit list as Exhibits D-570 and D-581, 
respectively. (See Dkt. No. 319-1, at 30)."
1617,15," To the extent Bard has a more specifically-tailored request under Rules 26 and 37, the Court will consider that at trial. "
1618,16," AngioDynamics will have to make a pretrial proffer of lost sales as part of laying the foundation for the admission of such 
statements. "
1620,17," The deposition testimony of Scott Centea, who is on AngioDynamics's witness list, further indicates that ""Matt Taylor told [Mr. 
Centea] that Brian [Williams] told [Mr. Taylor] that somebody at Swedish told him that Swedish had told Bard that they asked 
Bard for a single sterile stylet."" (Dkt. No. 265-17, at 5). While AngioDynamics posits that Mr. Williams's and Mr. Taylor's 
statements are business records which fall within the exception against hearsay in Rule 803(6), it is far from clear that that is the 
case. AngioDynamics has not indicated what ""records"" contain their statements, or if the statements were merely verbal reports."
1620,18," AngioDynamics also argues that such statements are admissible as non-hearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(C), without explaining 
how that rule applies here. (Dkt. No. 304, at 13). Rule 801(d)(2)(C) provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against 
an opposing party and ""was made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject."" Fed. R. Evid. 
801(d)(2)(C). The ""relevant inquiry"" under this rule is ""whether the person making the statements had the authority to speak on a 
particular subject on behalf of the party the admission is to be used against."" Penguin Books U.S.A., Inc. v. New Christian 
Church of Full Endeavor, Ltd., 262 F. Supp. 2d 251, 260 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citations omitted). For Rule 801(d)(2)(C), the 
individual ""must have had specific permission to speak on a subject,"" in contrast to Rule 801(d)(2)(D), where the individual ""only 
had to have general authority of the business area."" Id. "
1622,19," Bard also argues that Dr. Hay cannot rely on emails purportedly demonstrating customers' interest in pairing AngioDynamics's 
PICCs with Bard's TLS because ""isolated statements of preference are not a sufficient empirical demonstration concerning the 
adverse effect of the defendants' arrangement on price or quality."" (Dkt. No. 268-1, at 11 (quoting K.M.B. Warehouse Distribs., 
Inc. v. Walker Mfg. Co., 61 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir. 1995) (brackets omitted))). However, demonstrating an adverse effect on price 
or quality is not the only way to prove anticompetitive effects. See MacDermid Printing Solutions LLC v. Cortron Corp., 833 F.3d 
172, 182-84 (2d Cir. 2016) (noting that ""a plaintiff may demonstrate an adverse effect indirectly by establishing that the alleged 
conspirators had sufficient 'market power' to cause an adverse effect, 'plus some other ground for believing that the challenged 
behavior' has harmed competition""). And, as discussed below, Dr. Hay may reliably opine on the effect of Bard's tying policy on 
consumer choice."
1622,20," Bard argued for the first time at oral argument that Dr. Hay's testimony regarding consumer choice is the same opinion that the 
Court already excluded from Dr. Frankel. The Court precluded Dr. Frankel's testimony (concerning his damages calculations 
based on his Indicators 2, 4, and 6) in part due to his failure to conduct any analysis establishing that ""either the [interventional 
radiology] or non-navigation nursing market segments are sufficiently comparable to the navigation nursing market segment to 
serve as valid comparators."" AngioDynamics, Inc. v. C.R. Bard, Inc., No. 17-598, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109621, at *16-17, 2021 
WL 2403107 at *6 (N.D.N.Y. June 11, 2021). Putting aside that Dr. Hay's testimony concerns consumer choice in a market, not 
the calculation of AngioDynamics's damages, the Court notes that Dr. Hay also considered, as part of the unconstrained market, 
the market using Teleflex's TLS. (E.g., Dkt. No. 268-4, at 3). "
1623,21," The Court assumes familiarity with the factual background of this matter in general, and Dr. Frankel's opinions in particular, as 
set forth in the Court's prior rulings. AngioDynamics, 537 F. Supp. 3d 273 (summary judgment ruling); see also AngioDynamics, 
2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109621, 2021 WL 2403107; (Dkt. No. 219). The Court discusses only those portions of Dr. Frankel's 
opinions that are directly relevant to the instant motion. "
1624,22," On August 30, 2021, the Court permitted Bard to file a motion in limine with respect to whether Dr. Frankel's ""benchmark can 
only be applied to PICC sales to the 39 hospitals which Plaintiff has identified as having potentially lost sales,"" (Dkt. No. 216), 
and Bard has not raised the issues of lost midline sales or valved and unique PICCs in any of the multiple rounds of briefing 
regarding Dr. Frankel's opinions. Although Bard's challenges could have been raised much earlier, because the Court had not 
set a cutoff date for Daubert motions and in the interest of justice, the Court has considered Bard's arguments. "
1625,23, No Lexis cite available. 
1626,24," AngioDynamics also argues that such evidence is relevant to the fashioning of appropriate equitable relief in the event the jury 
finds Bard liable for an illegal tying arrangement. (Id. at 8-9). At oral argument, the parties agreed that this issue need not be 
decided now. "
1627,25," At oral argument, counsel for Bard argued that Ms. Rissler has never placed a PICC using TLS technology. (See also Dkt. No. 
300-2 at 114-15). AngioDynamics responded that Ms. Rissler nonetheless has experience manipulating guidewires found in 
PICCs, and also noted that she supervises the other AngioDynamics employees on whose testimony she relies."
1627,26," The Court notes that AngioDynamics has not responded to Bard's suggestion that the Sherlock TLS Wire Passage Tests 
documents may not have been produced. (See Dkt. No. 279-1, at 17 n.48). "
1628,27," The Court therefore does not address the parties' dispute about what evidence was provided to the FDA. Bard is free to 
explore this area with Ms. Rosecrans on cross-examination. "
1629,28," Counsel for AngioDynamics noted at oral argument that some documents reference Bard as ""BD."" "
1630,29," The Court notes that Bard has redacted one page of Ms. Paliobeis's deposition transcript, (Dkt. No. 270-3, at 13), and that 
AngioDynamics has submitted the same page unredacted, (Dkt. No. 294-3, at 20). The Court has approved Bard's redaction 
because the page contains Ms. Paliobeis's medical information; AngioDynamics is directed to respond to this issue in connection 
with a renewed motion to seal. Infra Section V.B. "
1631,30," Bard redacted ""sales numbers found in AngioDynamics' documents attached to Bard's Motion In Limine to Exclude Hospital 
Statements as Inadmissible Hearsay"" (Dkt. No. 265) and in Exhibit 8 to Bard's opposition to AngioDynamics's motion to preclude 
evidence regarding its efforts to develop its own TLS (Dkt. No. 290-9) out of ""an abundance of caution"" but does not seek to seal 
those numbers. (Dkt. No. 281-1, at 4 n.4; Dkt. No. 308-1, at 3 n.1). AngioDynamics should address whether it seeks to maintain 
these numbers under seal in its renewed motion to seal. "
1637,1," The Court acknowledges Plaintiffs' situation wherein IPCom first argued in its Reply that Rule 4(k)(2) did not apply. That said, 
the Court granted and takes into consideration the arguments Plaintiffs have made in their Surreply, which would alleviate any 
prejudice Plaintiffs may have experienced from new arguments IPCom introduced on Reply. In any event, Plaintiffs appears to 
have anticipated at some point that they may need to establish personal jurisdiction is proper in California, as their Amended 
Complaint makes several references to IPCom's connections to California and this District. See, e.g., AC ¶¶ 16, 22, 33, 81, 97."
1637,2," Although Touchcom did not involve a foreign patentee subject to § 293, the Federal Circuit nonetheless referenced § 293 when 
it interpreted Rule 4(k)(2) and expressly recognized that § 293 would provide jurisdiction over a foreign patentee.  [*15] See 
Touchcom, 574 F.3d at 1412 n.3 (""This malpractice suit . . . is not a case to which 35 U.S.C. § 293 applies, where jurisdiction 
over a foreign patentee is provided for proceedings affecting the patent."") (emphasis added). "
1638,3," Plaintiffs' assertion that a ""foreign patentee may be subject to jurisdiction in the E.D. Va. under Section 293 and elsewhere 
under Rule 4(k)(2)"" misreads the law. Surreply 3 (italics in original). The very authority which Plaintiffs cite in support of this 
proposition had remarked on the absence of ""binding precedent that establishes that a district court should . . . apply both 35 
U.S.C. § 293 ('the patent long-arm statute') and Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2) ('the federal long-arm statute') to a foreign patentee."" 
Tube-Mac, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 68630, 2020 WL 1911464, at *10. "
1639,4," When asked by the Court why they have filed their suit in California as opposed to any of the states where they are 
incorporated or headquartered, Plaintiffs responded that they ""sell a lot of products"" and ""have offices here"" in this district. 
Hearing Tr. 39:9-15. "
1640,5," Even if the Court were to consider these four meetings to be purposefully directed at California, the last of these meetings 
occurred nearly six years prior to the filing of the initial complaint and right before Plaintiff Motorola was acquired by Lenovo 
China. AC ¶ 53 n.1. This lengthy period between these purportedly related contacts and Plaintiffs' suit would cast further doubts 
on their propriety as jurisdictional contacts, specifically whether Plaintiffs' claims arise out of or relate to those meetings in San 
Francisco. Cf. Mattel, Inc. v. Greiner & Hausser GmbH, 354 F.3d 857, 866 (9th Cir. 2003) (acknowledging that defendant's 
contacts with the forum state ""must not have been weakened by the passage of time""). "
1645,6," IPCom's 2009 and 2014 FRAND declarations are attached to Plaintiffs' Opposition as Exhibits 112 and 115, both of which were 
incorporated by reference into the Amended Complaint. Compl. ¶¶ 149-155; see, e.g., Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., 899 
F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2018)."
1645,7," Plaintiffs, of course, may plead inconsistent or even contradictory allegations in successive pleadings. See, e.g., PAE Gov't 
Servs., Inc. v. MPRI, Inc., 514 F.3d 856, 860 (9th Cir. 2007)."
1645,8," Exhibit 4 to Plaintiffs' Opposition was incorporated by reference into the Amended Complaint at paragraph 67. See Opp. 4, 7."
1645,9," Exhibit 39 to Plaintiffs' Opposition was incorporated by reference into the Amended Complaint at paragraphs 66 and 78. See 
Opp. 7-8. "
1646,10," Plaintiffs also assert that ""even if [IPCom was directed to communicate with U.S. subsidiaries], whether to do so was IPCom's 
own choice."" Opp. 4. This argument—in addition to requiring difficult line-drawing semantics—does not overcome the fact that, 
regardless of whom it reached out to, IPCom was primarily seeking a worldwide license with Lenovo China. Reply 5-6."
1646,11," The Opposition briefly argues that jurisdiction may also be proper under the Paccar test, which permits the exercise of 
personal jurisdiction where the defendant ""committed the liability-producing acts while physically present in the forum state."" 
Freestream Aircraft (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Aero L. Grp., 905 F.3d 597, 606 (9th Cir. 2018) (citing Paccar Int'l, Inc. v. Com. Bank of 
Kuwait, S.A.K., 757 F.2d 1058, 1064 (9th Cir. 1985)). However, as discussed infra at Section III.C.4, the liability-producing acts 
for a Broadcom antitrust claim are the intentionally false promise to an SSO, the SSO's reliance in setting standards, and the 
subsequent breach by the patent holder. See Broadcom, 501 F.3d 297. Plaintiffs do not allege that any of these acts occurred 
while IPCom was physically present in the forum; IPCom's one physical visit to the United States in April 2018 did not result in 
IPCom asserting any licensing demand that could be treated as a ""subsequent breach"" of FRAND promises. See Compl. ¶¶ 64-
66. "
1654,1," We note in this connection that the antitrust laws confer a right of action on ""any person ... injured in his business or property,"" 
see 15 U.S.C. § 15, and that the Supreme Court has confirmed that both consumers, such as the insurers here, and 
competitors, such as Vasquez, fall within the scope of the law. See Assoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of 
Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 538, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983) (""[T]he Sherman Act was enacted to assure customers 
the benefits of price competition, and [the Court's] prior cases have emphasized the central interest in protecting the economic 
freedom of participants in the relevant market""). "
1655,2," We note, in this connection, that Vasquez alleges an alternative market, ""Southern Indiana,"" which he defines to include 
Morgan, Owen, Monroe, Brown, Greene, Daviess, Martin, Lawrence, Orange, and Washington counties. For present purposes, 
we focus on Bloomington, both because it is the smallest plausible market alleged and because the alternative market includes 
it. That said, the Southern Indiana market may turn out to be the best object of analysis as this litigation progresses and further 
facts emerge. Our present attention to the Bloomington market should in no way be taken to limit the parties to arguments about 
that market. "
1662,1," The Court in Scilex considered the same IcyHot® Lidocaine Patch Plus Menthol packaging as well as similar Aspercreme 
labels. 21-cv-1280-JST, ECF No. 90 ¶¶ 1, 18, 37-51."
1662,2," Sanofi also argues that ""[u]nder California law, absent an affirmative misrepresentation, a defendant's duty to disclose is 
generally 'confined to safety issues,'"" and no safety issues are alleged in the complaint. ECF No. 42 at 24 (citing Wirth v. Mars 
Inc., No. SA CV 15-1470-DOC (KESx), 2016 WL 471234, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Feb. 5, 2016) (emphasis added)). Because the Court 
finds that the complaint alleges an affirmative misrepresentation, it will not dismiss the complaint on this basis."
1662,3," Sanofi also makes an argument under New Jersey law to which Plaintiffs do not respond. ECF No. 42 at 24. Plaintiffs bring 
their state law claims under the laws of California, New York, and Illinois, but not New Jersey. Before making arguments under 
New Jersey law, Sanofi must first persuade the Court that New Jersey law applies. "
1665,4," Sanofi also argues that ""any purported defect of the Sanofi Products could have been discovered by Plaintiffs upon an 
inspection of the Products."" ECF No. 50 at 19. Because Plaintiffs have failed substantively to allege an implied warranty claim, 
the Court does not reach this argument. "
