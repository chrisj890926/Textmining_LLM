            "local-competition rules were invalid, most notably the one requiring that prices for interconnection and unbundled access be based on \"Total Element Long Run Incremental Cost\" (TELRIC) -- a forward-looking rather than historic measure. 3 See 47 CFR §§ 51.503, 51.505 (1997). The Court of Appeals agreed, and vacated the pricing rules, and several other aspects of the order, as reaching beyond the Commission's jurisdiction.  Iowa Utilities Board v. FCC, 120 F.3d 753, 800, 804, 805-806 [****13]  (1997). It held that the general rulemaking authority conferred upon the Commission by the Communications Act of 1934 extended only to interstate matters, and that the Commission therefore needed specific congressional authorization before implementing provisions of the 1996 Act addressing intrastate telecommunications. Id. at 795. It found no such authorization for the Commission's rules regarding pricing, dialing parity, 4 exemptions  [*375]  for rural LECs, the proper procedure for resolving local-competition disputes, and state review of pre-1996 interconnection  [***847]  agreements.  Id. at 795-796, 802-806. Indeed, with respect to some of these matters, the Eighth Circuit said that the 1996 Act had affirmatively given exclusive authority to the state commissions.  Id. at 795, 802, 805. [****14]  \n",
            "The Court of Appeals found support for its holdings in 47 U.S.C. § 152(b) ( § 2(b) of the Communications Act of 1934), which, it said, creates a presumption in favor of preserving state authority over intrastate communications.  120 F.3d at 796. It found nothing in the 1996 Act clear enough to overcome this presumption, which it described as a fence that is \"hog tight, horse high, and bull strong, preventing the FCC from intruding on the states' intrastate turf.\" Id. at 800.\n",
            "Incumbent LECs also made several challenges, only some of which are relevant here, to [****15]  the rules implementing the 1996 Act's requirement of unbundled access. See 47 U.S.C. § 251(c)(3) (1994 ed., Supp. II). HN3[] Rule 319, the primary unbundling rule, sets forth a minimum number of network elements that incumbents \n",
            "must make available to requesting carriers. See 47 CFR § 51.319 (1997). The LECs complained that, in compiling this list, the FCC had virtually ignored the 1996 Act's requirement that it consider whether access to proprietary elements was \"necessary\" and whether lack of access to nonproprietary elements would \"impair\" an entrant's ability to provide local service. See 47 U.S.C. § 251(d)(2) (1994 ed., sup. II). In addition, the LECs thought that the list included items (like directory assistance and caller I.D.) that did not meet the statutory definition of \"network element.\" See § 153(29). The Eighth Circuit rebuffed both arguments, holding that the Commission's interpretations [*376]  of the \"necessary and impair\" standard and the definition of \"network element\" were reasonable and hence lawful under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.(NRDC), 467 U.S. 837, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694, 104 S. Ct. 2778 (1984). See 120 F.3d at 809-810.\n",

            "3 TELRIC pricing is based upon the cost of operating a hypothetical network built with the most efficient technology available. Incumbents argued below that this method was unreasonable because it stranded their historic costs and underestimated the actual costs of providing interconnection and unbundled access. The Eighth Circuit did not reach this issue, and the merits of TELRIC are not before us.\n",
            "4 Dialing parity, which seeks to ensure that a new entrant's customers can make calls without having to dial an access code, was addressed in the Commission's Second Report and Order. See In re Implementation of the Local Competition Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 11 FCC Rcd 19392 (1996). In a separate opinion that is also before us today, the Eighth Circuit vacated this rule insofar as it went beyond the FCC's jurisdiction over interstate calls.  People of California v. FCC, 124 F.3d 934, 943 (1997).\n"
