             'Exhaustion' applies where a claim is cognizable in the first instance by an administrative agency alone; judicial interference is
             withheld until the administrative process has run its course.  'Primary jurisdiction,' on the other hand, applies where a claim is
             originally cognizable in the courts, and comes into play whenever enforcement of the claim requires the resolution of issues
             which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body; in such a case
             the judicial process is suspended pending referral of such issues to the administrative body for its views."" "

             Co., supra, took the position that shippers were entitled to have rates filed by carriers who were not parties to a conspiracy, even
             though the rates filed were the lowest which would be found to be reasonable.  The risk that future filings would be at the
             uppermost limits of the zone of reasonableness was too great, and damage from the conspiratorial filings was presumed to flow.
             Of course, when the agency is permitted to exempt from antitrust coverage rates filed cooperatively, the doctrine equally applies
             to an attack on the alleged conspiracy. United States Navigation Co. v.  Cunard S. S. Co., supra;  Far East Conference v. United

             Commission may hold hearings on the lawfulness of filed rates, § 204, and after hearings may itself set the applicable rate, §
             205. Cf.  49 U. S. C. § 15 et seq., 46 U. S. C. § 817. In view of this extensive regulation, Congress has provided that certain

  65 ,18    ," This conclusion is re-enforced by the Commission's disavowal of either the power or the desire to foreclose the Government
             from antitrust actions aimed at transactions which the Commission has licensed.  This position was taken both before the district
             judge below, and in a Supplemental Memorandum filed in this Court, page 8: ""Concurrent with the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice to enforce the Sherman Act, the Commission, of course, has
             jurisdiction to designate license applications for hearing on public interest questions arising out of facts which might also
             constitute violations of the antitrust laws. This does not mean, however, that its action on these public interest questions of
             communications policy is a determination of the antitrust issues as such.  Thus, while the Commission may deny applications as
             not in the public interest where violations of the Sherman Act have been determined to exist, its approval of transactions which
             might involve Sherman Act violations is not a determination that the Sherman Act has not been violated, and therefore cannot
             forestall the United States from subsequently bringing an antitrust suit challenging those transactions."" Nor was this position taken merely for the purposes of this litigation, for it has been the view of the Commission over a period of
             years.  See Report on Uniform Policy as to Violation by Applicants of Laws of United States, FCC Docket No. 9572 (1950), 1
             Pike and Fischer, Radio Regulation, Part III, 91:495; National Broadcasting Co. v.  United States, 319 U.S. 190. Since, as Mr.
             Justice Brandeis observed, the doctrine of primary jurisdiction rests in part upon the need for the skill of a ""body of experts,"" it
             would be odd to impose the doctrine when the experts deny the relevance of their skill. "

             Fe and Pennsylvania each obtained letter commitments from the trustees for the sale to each of them of 26% of the Western
             stock at a price of $ 100 per share. (Near the same time the Rock Island made a like offer to the trustees for 26% of the Western
             stock, but that offer was not accepted.) But a dispute arose -- and apparently still exists between the trustees and Pennsylvania -
             - with respect to the validity of those commitments.  Thereupon, Minneapolis offered the trustees $ 133 per share for the
             Western stock, but that offer was not accepted, and on May 26, 1955, the Santa Fe, acting, as the Commission found, ""on behalf
             of that carrier alone,"" agreed with the trustees for the sale by the latter and purchase by the former of all the Western stock held
             by the trustees at a price of $ 135 per share, and those parties on that date entered into a contract, accordingly, subject to
             approval of the Commission."
  79 ,4     ," The contract of June 28, 1955, between the Santa Fe and the Pennsylvania Company provided that it was without prejudice to

             the letter commitment of April 15, 1955, for the sale by the trustees to Pennsylvania of 26% of the Western stock; and that, in the

             appears that litigation was then, and is yet, pending by Pennsylvania against the trustees for the enforcement of the letter
             commitment of April 15, 1955. The contract also contained a covenant which, in essence, provided that (1) Western ""will continue to be operated as a separate

 143 ,6     ," A summary of the detailed provisions of the decree carrying out the direction and purposes of the court's opinion follows. Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were enjoined from acquiring additional General Motors stock except as stock or rights might
             be distributed to them as stockholders by General Motors. "
 144 ,      ," Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, on the one hand, and General Motors, on the other, were prohibited to have common
             officers, directors, or employees.  The former three were also restrained from nominating any person to be an officer or director
             of General Motors. Du Pont and General Motors were compelled to terminate, for as long as du Pont, Christiana, or Delaware own any General
             Motors stock, any agreement between them which (1) requires General Motors to purchase from du Pont a specified percentage
             of its requirements of any product (with certain time provisos), or (2) grants to either concern exclusive patent rights, or grants to
             du Pont preferential rights to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors. Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were restrained, for the same period, from entering into any joint business venture with
             General Motors and from knowingly holding stock in any business enterprise in which General Motors holds stock. The same
             restrictions were applied to General Motors. Du Pont was enjoined, again for the stock-holding period, from dealing with General Motors with respect to du Pont products on
             terms more favorable than those on which it is willing to deal with General Motors' competitors. The same restriction was placed
             upon General Motors in its dealings with du Pont. Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, and their directors and officers, and the members of the families of their directors and
             officers who reside in the same household with them, were enjoined from exercising their voting rights in General Motors stock
             owned by them or allocable to them under the decree, and from attempting to influence anyone voting General Motors stock. The vote on the General Motors shares owned by du Pont was ordered ""passed through"" to the stockholders of du Pont (subject
             to the prohibitions of the preceding paragraph), and the notification and proxy machinery necessary to effectuate this provision
             was outlined.  Provision was made for the appointment of a monitor of these voting procedures. A procedure was established whereby du Pont and Christiana might sell or otherwise dispose of their General Motors stock. Two separate provisions preserved the right of any party to apply to the court for modification of the decree in the event of a
             change of circumstances (such as the advent of legislative tax relief) and for further orders necessary for carrying out the
             judgment. Du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were directed to obtain from their officers and directors, and their families, written consents to
             be bound by the voting restrictions of the judgment. For the purpose of securing compliance with the judgment, the Department of Justice was authorized to conduct reasonable
             inspections of the records and interviews with the employees of du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware and to apply to the court for
             similar privileges as to General Motors upon a showing of good cause."

             natural rules which govern their use.  There is in fact no limit to their variety and application; the court of equity has the power of

             may be added  International Boxing Club v. United States, 358 U.S. 242, in which the Court accepted the District Court's finding
             that ""'The great evil'"" in the case ""'was the combination that Wirtz and Norris caused and created by joining up with Madison
             Square Garden.'""  358 U.S., at 256. "

             297-298. ""Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as its terms and the nature of the remedy prescribed plainly suggest, was intended for the
             protection of the public against the evils which were supposed to flow from the undue lessening of competition. . . . . . . . ""Mere acquisition by one corporation of the stock of a competitor, even though it result in some lessening of competition, is not
             forbidden; the act deals only with such acquisitions as probably will result in lessening competition to a substantial degree . . .
             that is to say, to such a degree as will injuriously affect the public. . . ."" "
 150 ,16    ," To the same effect, see  Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1; Lorain Journal Co. v.  United States, 342 U.S. 143;
             International Boxing Club v. United States, 358 U.S. 242; Maryland & Virginia Milk Producers Assn. v.  United States, 362 U.S.

 151 ,17    ," The Court should not allow itself to be led to a contrary conclusion by the language of  United States v. United States Gypsum
             Co., 340 U.S. 76, or Hartford-Empire Co. v.  United States, 324 U.S. 570. The Gypsum case says only that the District Court's
             conclusions should not be subject to reversal merely for gross abuse of discretion, and that this Court must intervene when the
             provisions of the decree are ""inappropriate."" I could not agree more, either with these views or with those expressed in the
             remarks that formed their preface: ""The determination of the scope of the decree to accomplish its purpose is peculiarly the responsibility of the trial court.  Its
             opportunity to know the record and to appraise the need for prohibitions or affirmative actions normally exceeds that of any
             reviewing court.""  340 U.S., at 89. In Hartford-Empire the opinion of the Court says ""it is unthinkable that Congress has entrusted the enforcement of a statute of
             such far-reaching importance to the judgment of a single judge, without review of the relief granted or denied by him.""  324 U.S.,
             at 571. These words, if given the reading they seem most readily to bear, are certainly unobjectionable, for our power to review
             the antitrust relief determinations of trial judges is not in doubt.  If this language is to be read to authorize de novo consideration
             here of all the details of a lower court's decree, then it marks a real aberration in this branch of the law.  Whatever respect such a
             view might once have deserved, it deserves none now, for our recent decisions have uniformly adopted the principle of appellate
             deference to trial court discretion.  See cases cited in notes 7 and 16, supra. "

             both had experienced declines in their respective market shares.  And the exclusive franchises involved in those cases

             consider abandoned."
 226 ,11    ," We reject the argument that § 11 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 21, confers jurisdiction over banks upon the
             FTC.  That section provides in pertinent part: ""Authority to enforce compliance with sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title [§§ 2,
             3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act, as amended] by the persons respectively subject thereto is vested . . . in the Federal Reserve
             Board where applicable to banks, banking associations, and trust companies; and in the Federal Trade Commission where
             applicable to all other character of commerce . . . ."" The argument is that since the FRB has no authority to enforce the Clayton
             Act against bank mergers, see note 22, infra, bank mergers must fall into the residual category of ""all other character of
             commerce"" and so be subject to the FTC.  However, there is no intimation in the legislative history of the 1950 amendment to §§
             7 and 11 that the FTC's traditional lack of jurisdiction over banks was to be disturbed.  Moreover, it is clear from the language of
             § 11 that ""banks, banking associations, and trust companies"" are meant to comprise a distinct ""character of commerce,"" and so
             cannot be part of the ""other character of commerce"" reserved to the FTC. The exclusion of banks from the FTC's jurisdiction appears to have been motivated by the fact that banks were already subject
             to extensive federal administrative controls.  See  T. C. Hurst & Son v. Federal Trade Comm'n, 268 F. 874, 877 (D. C. E. D. Va.

             corporate structure and no change in stockholder interests.  Shareholders of merging corporations surrender their interests in
             those corporations in exchange for their very different rights in the resulting corporation.  In an asset acquisition, however, the

             liabilities, and fiduciary rights and obligations of the merging firms.  In a merger, but not in an asset acquisition, there is the
             likelihood of a continuity of management and other personnel.  Finally, a merger, like a stock acquisition, necessarily involves
             the acquisition by one corporation of an immediate voice in the management of the business of another corporation; no voice in

             dissenting from a merger has the right to receive the appraised value of his shares . . . whereas no shareholder has a
             comparable right in an acquisition of stock. Furthermore the corporate existence of a merged company is terminated by a

             generally Note,  26 Col. L. Rev. 594-596 (1926). They were based not on a lack of substantive power under § 7, but on the
             enforcement section, § 11, which limited the FTC's remedial powers to ""an order requiring such person to cease and desist from
             such violations [of §§ 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act], and divest itself of the stock held or rid itself of the directors chosen
             contrary to the provisions of sections seven and eight of this Act."" 38 Stat. 735.  Faced with Congress' evident refusal to confer
             upon the FTC the ordinary powers of a court of equity, this Court held that unless the assets were acquired after the FTC's order
             of stock divestiture had been issued (which was the case in  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Western Meat Co., supra, where the
             Commission was sustained), the Commission could not order a divestiture of assets.  Compare Board of Govs. of Fed. Res.
             Sys. v.  Transamerica Corp., 184 F.2d 311 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1950), with  Federal Trade Comm'n v. International Paper Co., 241
             F.2d 372 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1956). Since under this Court's decisions the FTC was powerless even where the transfer of assets was
             an evasive maneuver aimed at defeating the FTC's remedial jurisdiction over stock acquisitions violative of § 7, a fortiori the
             Commission was powerless against the typical merger. See Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Elec. Co. v.  Federal Trade Comm'n, supra,
             at 595, 598-599. As part of the 1950 amendments to the Clayton Act, § 11 was amended to read: ""an order requiring such
             person to . . . divest itself of the stock, or other share capital, or assets, held . . . ."" 15 U. S. C. § 21. Whether as an original
             matter Thatcher, Swift and Arrow-Hart were correctly decided is no longer an open question, since they were the explicit premise
             of the 1950 amendment to § 7.  See State Bd. of Ins. v.  Todd Shipyards Corp., 370 U.S. 451, 458, p. 349, infra. The question of the FTC's remedial powers under § 11 of the Clayton Act is to be distinguished from that of its remedial powers
             under § 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U. S. C. § 45 (b).  In  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Eastman Kodak Co., 274
             U.S. 619, the Court, relying on Thatcher and Swift, held that the Commission had no power to order divestiture in § 5
             proceedings.  But cf. Gilbertville Trucking Co. v.  United States, 371 U.S. 115, 129-131;  Pan American World Airways v. United

 228 ,18    ," See note 1, supra, for text of amended § 7.  The original § 7 read in pertinent part: ""no corporation engaged in commerce shall
             acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in
             commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock
             is so acquired and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to
             create a monopoly of any line of commerce."" The passage of the 1950 amendment followed many years of unsuccessful attempts to enact legislation plugging the assets-
             acquisition loophole. See Note,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766-767, notes 3 and 4 (1952).  To be sure, the 1950 amendment was intended
             not only to enlarge the number of transactions covered by § 7 but also to change the test of illegality.  The legislative history
             pertinent to the latter point is reviewed in Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 315-323, and is not directly relevant to the present
             discussion. "

             said corporation.  Since the acquisition of stock is significant chiefly because it is likely to result in control of the underlying

             United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495 (No. 461, October Term, 1947), pp. 453-475.  As a result of the purchase, in
             its horizontal aspect, U.S. Steel controlled about 24% of the structural steel fabricating market in an 11-state western area.  This
             Court held that the acquisition could not be reached under § 7 of the  Clayton Act, see 334 U.S., at 507, n. 7, and did not violate
             the Sherman Act. It should be noted, however, that the Court regarded the 24% market-share figure proposed by the
             Government as a ""doubtful assumption"" and also pointed to ""unusual conditions"" tending to mitigate the anticompetitive effect of
             the acquisition.  334 U.S., at 529. Columbia Steel was repeatedly cited by Congressmen considering the amendment of § 7 as

             remark of Senator O'Conor's: ""The Court, in effect, said that the [Federal Trade] Commission was quite free to use the power
             which Congress had conferred upon it, so long as it confined the use of that power to ordering the divestiture of pieces of paper
             which happened to be worthless."" 96 Cong. Rec. 16433.  Senator O'Mahoney remarked, for example, that there was ""no doubt "
 230 ,      ," of the fundamental fact that an innocent defect in the drafting of section 7 of the Clayton Act back in 1914 had resulted in
             creating a great opportunity for escape by flagrant violators of the law."" 96 Cong. Rec. 16443.  After sharply criticizing this
             Court's decisions, the Senator continued: ""I take it the record is perfectly clear that what this bill purports to do is to correct an
             omission in the original Clayton Act. When the authors of the Clayton Act and the Congress which passed it enacted the bill into
             law they thought they were giving the Federal Trade Commission administrative authority to prevent monopolistic mergers . . . .""
             Ibid.  So also, Senator Kefauver observed: ""it would have been much better for the economy of the country to have repealed
             sections 7 and 11 of the Clayton Act rather than let this wide-open loophole to remain.  Most of the large and monopolistic
             mergers which have become detrimental to the free-enterprise system of our Nation have occurred by way of this plain evasion
             of the intent of the original Clayton Act."" 96 Cong. Rec. 16451."
 230 ,22    ," A cash purchase of another bank's assets would not seem to be a fully effective method of corporate acquisition. In other
             industries, a cash purchase of plant, inventory, patents, trade secrets, and the like will often directly enhance the competitive
             position of the acquiring corporation, as in Columbia Steel Co. But a bank desiring to increase its share of banking business
             through corporate acquisition would ordinarily need to acquire the other bank's deposits and capital, not merely its assets.  For
             more deposits mean more working capital, and additions to capital and surplus increase the lending limit.  A cash purchase, in
             effect, only substitutes cash for cash, since bank assets consist principally of cash and very liquid securities and loans
             receivable, and adds nothing to the acquiring bank's capital and surplus or to its working capital.  True, an exchange of its stock
             for assets would achieve the acquiring bank's objectives.  We are clear, however, that in light of Congress' overriding purpose, in
             amending § 7, to close the loophole in the original section, if such an exchange (or other clearly evasive transaction) were
             tantamount in its effects to a merger, the exchange would not be an ""assets"" acquisition within the meaning of § 7 but would be
             treated as a transaction subject to that section. We have not overlooked the fact that there are corporations in other industries not subject to the FTC's jurisdiction.  Chief among
             these are air carriers subject to the Civil Aeronautics Board and other carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Commission.
             Both agencies have been given, expressly, broad powers to exempt mergers and acquisitions in whatever form from the antitrust
             laws. See 49 U. S. C. §§ 1378, 1384; 49 U. S. C. § 5 (11) and (13).  Therefore, the exclusion of assets acquisitions in such
             industries from § 7 would seem to have little significance. Section 11 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 21, vests the FRB with authority to enforce § 7 ""where applicable to banks."" This
             provision has been in the Act since it was first passed in 1914 and was not changed by the 1950 amendments.  The Bank
             Merger Act of 1960, assigning roles in merger applications to the FDIC and the Comptroller of the Currency as well as to the
             FRB, plainly supplanted, we think, whatever authority the FRB may have acquired under § 11, by virtue of the amendment of §
             7, to enforce § 7 against bank mergers. Since the Bank Merger Act applies only to mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of
             assets, and assumptions of liabilities but not to outright stock acquisitions, the FRB's authority under § 11 as it existed before the
             1950 amendment of § 7 remains unaffected.  See, e. g., Transamerica Corp. v.  Board of Govs. of Fed. Res. Sys., 206 F.2d 163
             (C. A. 3d Cir. 1953). Nothing in this opinion, of course, limits the power of the FTC, under §§ 7 and 11, as amended, to reach any transaction,
             including mergers and consolidations, in the broad range between and including pure stock and pure assets acquisitions, where
             the acquiring corporation is subject to the FTC's jurisdiction, see 15 U. S. C. § 45 (a)(6), and to order divestiture of the stock,
             share capital, or assets acquired in the transaction, see 15 U. S. C. § 21. "
 231 ,23    ," See, e. g., statement of Assistant Attorney General Bergson: ""If it [§ 7] is to have any significant effect for the future, it is

             Co., there is virtually no time lag between the banks' furnishing competing financial institutions (small-loan companies, for
             example) with the raw material, i. e., money, and the institutions' selling the finished product, i. e., loans; hence the instant case,
             compared with Aluminum Co. in this respect, is a fortiori.  As one banker testified quite frankly in the instant case in response to
             the question: ""Do you feel that you are in substantial competition with these institutions [personal-finance and sales-finance
             companies] that you lend . . . such money to for loans that you want to make?"" -- ""Oh, no, we definitely do not.  If we did, we
             would stop making the loans to them."" (R. 298.) The reason for the competitive disadvantage of most lending institutions vis-a-
             vis banks is that only banks obtain the bulk of their working capital without having to pay interest or comparable charges thereon,
             by virtue of their unique power to accept demand deposits. The critical area of short-term commercial credit, see pp. 326-327,
             supra, appears to be one in which banks have little effective competition, save in the case of very large companies which can
             meet their financing needs from retained earnings or from issuing securities or paper."
 235 ,34    ," As one witness for the defendants testified: ""We have had in Philadelphia for 50 years or more the mutual savings banks offering 1/2 per cent and in some instances more
             than 1/2 per cent higher interest than the commercial banks.  Nevertheless, the rate of increase in savings accounts in "
 236 ,      ," commercial banks has kept pace with and in many of the banks exceeded the rate of increase of the mutual banks paying 3 1/2
             per cent. . . . ""I have made some inquiries.  There are four banks on the corner of Broad and Chestnut.  Three of them are commercial banks
             all offering 3 per cent, and one is a mutual savings bank offering 3 1/2.  As far as I have been able to discover, there isn't
             anybody in Philadelphia who will take the trouble to walk across Broad Street to get 1/2 of 1 per cent more interest.  If you ask
             me why, I will say I do not know.  Habit, custom, personal relationships, convenience, doing all your banking under one roof
             appear to be factors superior to changes in the interest rate level."" (R. 1388-1389.)"
 236 ,35    ," Consider the following colloquy between governmental counsel and a witness for the defendants: ""Q. What do you consider to be the area of a branch office? ""A. Well, there is no set rule on that.  We hope to have an area from 1 1/2 to 2 miles. ""However, we have opened branches directly in the communities where other banks are established, in fact, across the street
             from them because it is not only a question of getting new business, it's a question of servicing and retaining the accounts that
             we now have. . . . . . ""Q. And your business is not necessarily dependent upon it [the customer] being within a mile or two of a branch, is it? ""A. To a large degree, it is, because we found that we were losing deposit accounts regularly from our in-town offices because
             other banks were opening or had offices in other sections of the city; and in order to retain those accounts and to get additional
             business we felt it was necessary to establish branches."" (R. 1815.) As far as the customer for a bank loan is concerned, ""the size of his market is somewhat dependent upon his own size, how well
             he is known, and so on.  For example, for small business concerns known primarily locally, they may consider that their market
             is a strictly local one, and they may be forced by circumstances to do business with banks in a nearby geographic relationship to
             them.  On the other hand, as businesses increase in size, the scope of their business activities, their national reputation, the
             alternatives they have available to them will be spread again over a very large area, possibly as large as the entire United
             States."" (R. 1372.) (Defendants' testimony on direct examination.)"
 236 ,36    ," The figures for PNB and Girard respectively are: 54% and 63% of the dollar volume of their commercial and industrial loans
             originate in the four-county area; 75% and 70%, personal loans; 74% and 84%, real estate loans; 41% and 62%, lines of credit;
             94% and 72%, personal trusts; 81% and 94%, time and savings deposits; 56% and 77%, demand deposits; 93% and 87%,
             demand deposits of individuals.  Actually, these figures may be too low.  The evidence discloses that most of the business done "
 237 ,      ," outside the area is with large borrowers and large depositors; appellees do not, by and large, deal with small businessmen and
             average individuals not located in the four-county area.  For example, of appellees' combined total business demand deposits
             under $ 10,000, 94% originate in the four-county area.  This reinforces the thesis that the smaller the customer, the smaller is his
             banking market geographically.  See note 35, supra. The appellees concede that the four-county area has sufficient commercial importance to qualify, under Brown Shoe Co., supra,
             at 336-337, as a ""section of the country"" within the meaning of § 7.  See Maryland & Va. Milk Producers Assn. v.  United States,
             362 U.S. 458, 469; cf.   United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218, 226; Indiana Farmer's Guide Publishing Co. v.  Prairie
             Farmer Publishing Co., 293 U.S. 268, 279."
 237 ,37    ," Appellees suggest not that bank offices skirting the four-county area provide meaningful alternatives to bank customers within
             the area, but that such alternatives are provided by large banks, from New York and elsewhere, which solicit business in the
             Philadelphia area.  There is no evidence of the amount of business done in the area by banks with offices outside the area; it
             may be that such figures are unobtainable.  In any event, it would seem from the local orientation of banking insofar as smaller
             customers are concerned, see notes 35 and 36, supra, that competition from outside the area would only be important to the
             larger borrowers and depositors.  If so, the four-county area remains a valid geographical market in which to assess the
             anticompetitive effect of the proposed merger upon the banking facilities available to the smaller customer -- a perfectly good
             ""line of commerce,"" in light of Congress' evident concern, in enacting the 1950 amendments to § 7, with preserving small
             business.  See Brown Shoe Co., supra, at 315-316.  As a practical matter the small businessman can only satisfy his credit
             needs at local banks.  To be sure, there is still some artificiality in deeming the four-county area the relevant ""section of the
             country"" so far as businessmen located near the perimeter are concerned.  But such fuzziness would seem inherent in any
             attempt to delineate the relevant geographical market.  Note,  52 Col. L. Rev. 766, 778-779, n. 77 (1952). And it is notable that
             outside the four-county area, appellees' business rapidly thins out.  Thus, the other six counties of the Delaware Valley account
             for only 2% of appellees' combined individual demand deposits; 4% demand deposits of partnerships and corporations; 7%,
             loans; 2%, savings deposits; 4%, business time deposits. "

 238 ,40    ," See p. 331, supra.  We note three factors that cause us to shade the percentages given earlier in this opinion, in seeking to
             calculate market share.  (1) The percentages took no account of banks which do business in the four-county area but have no
             offices there; however, this seems to be a factor of little importance, at least insofar as smaller customers are concerned, see
             note 37, supra.  (2) The percentages took no account of banks which have offices in the four-county area but not their home
             offices there; however, there seem to be only two such offices and appellees in this Court make no reference to this omission.
             (3) There are no percentages for the amount of business of banks located in the area, other than appellees, which originates in
             the area.  Appellees contend that since most of the 40 other banks are smaller, they do a more concentratedly local business "
 239 ,      ," than appellees, and hence account for a relatively larger proportion of such business.  If so, we doubt much correction is
             needed.  The five largest banks in the four-county area at present control some 78% of the area banks' assets.  Thus, even if the
             small banks have a somewhat different pattern of business, it is difficult to see how that would substantially diminish the
             appellees' share of the local banking business. No evidence was introduced as to the quantitative significance of these three factors, and appellees do not contend that as a
             practical matter such evidence could have been obtained.  Under the circumstances, we think a downward correction of the
             percentages to 30% produces a conservative estimate of appellees' market share."
 239 ,41    ," Kaysen and Turner, supra, note 38, suggest that 20% should be the line of prima facie unlawfulness; Stigler suggests that any
             acquisition by a firm controlling 20% of the market after the merger is presumptively unlawful; Markham mentions 25%.  Bok's
             principal test is increase in market concentration, and he suggests a figure of 7% or 8%.  And consult note 20, supra.  We
             intimate no view on the validity of such tests for we have no need to consider percentages smaller than those in the case at bar,
             but we note that such tests are more rigorous than is required to dispose of the instant case.  Needless to say, the fact that a
             merger results in a less-than-30% market share, or in a less substantial increase in concentration than in the instant case, does
             not raise an inference that the merger is not violative of § 7.  See, e. g., Brown Shoe Co., supra."
 239 ,42    ," See note 41, supra.  It is no answer that, among the three presently largest firms (First Pennsylvania, PNB, and Girard), there
             will be no increase in concentration. If this argument were valid, then once a market had become unduly concentrated, further
             concentration would be legally privileged.  On the contrary, if concentration is already great, the importance of preventing even
             slight increases in concentration and so preserving the possibility of eventual deconcentration is correspondingly great.

             new bank opened in the Philadelphia four-county area.  That was in 1951.  At the end of 10 years, the new bank controlled only
             one-third of 1% of the area's deposits."
 240 ,45    ," The following colloquy is representative: ""Q. Mr. Jennings, what is the nature of competition among commercial banks? ""A. Keen, highly competitive. I think, from my own observation, that I have never known competition among banks to be keener
             than it is today. . . . ""Q. In what area does competition exist? . . . ""A. I think the stiffest, sternest competition of all is in the field to obtain demand deposits and loans. . . . ""Q. What form does the competition take? ""A. It takes many forms.  If we are dealing with the deposits of large corporations, wealthy individuals, I would say that most, if
             not all, of the major banks of the country are competing for such deposits. The same would hold true as regards loans to those
             corporations or wealthy individuals. ""If we go into the field of smaller loans, smaller deposits, the competition is more regional -- wide but nevertheless regional --
             and there the large banks as well as the small banks are after that business with everything they have. "
 241 ,      ," . . . . ""Q. What form does the competition take?  Is it competition in price? ""A. No, I wouldn't say that it is competition as to price.  After all, interest rates are regulated at the top level by the laws of the 50
             states.  Interest rates at the bottom level have no legal limitation, but for practical purposes the prime rate . . . furnishes a very
             effective floor.  I would say that the area of competition for interest rates would range between, let us say, the prime rate of 4 1/2
             and 6 per cent for normal loans exclusive of consumer loans, where higher rates are permitted. . . . . ""In the area of service charges, I would say that banks are competitive in that field.  They base their service charges primarily on
             their costs, but they have to maintain a weather eye to windward as to what the competitors are charging in the service charge
             field.  The minute they get out of line in connection with service charges they find their customers will start to protest, and if
             something isn't done some of the customers will leave them for a differential in service charges of any significance. ""I do not believe that competition is really affected by the price area.  I think it is affected largely by the quality and the caliber of
             service that banks give and whether or not they feel they are being received in the right way, whether they are welcome in the
             bank.  Personalities enter into it very heavily, but I do not think price as such is a major factor in banking competition.  It is there,
             it is a factor, but not major."" (R. 1940-1942.) It should be noted that besides competition in interest rates, there is a great deal of indirect price competition in the banking
             industry. For example, the amount of compensating balance a bank requires of a borrower (i. e., the amount the borrower must
             always retain in his demand deposit account with the bank) affects the real cost of the loan, and varies considerably in the
             bank's discretion. "
 242 ,46    ," Thus, arguably, the so-called failing-company defense, see International Shoe Co. v.  Federal Trade Comm'n, 280 U.S. 291,
             299-303, might have somewhat larger contours as applied to bank mergers because of the greater public impact of a bank
             failure compared with ordinary business failures.  But the question what defenses in § 7 actions must be allowed in order to avert

 248 ,29    ," It is true, as the Court points out (ante, p. 354), that Congress, in enacting the Bank Merger Act, agreed that the applicability of
             the Sherman Act to banking should not be disturbed.  See, e. g., 105 Cong. Rec. 8076 (1959).  But surely this alone provides no
             conceivable justification for applying the Clayton Act as well.  Apart from the fact that the Sherman Act covers many kinds of
             restraints besides mergers, one of the sponsors of the Bank Merger Act (Senator Fulbright) expressed his expectation that in a
             Sherman Act case a bank merger would not be subjected to strict antitrust standards to the exclusion of all other considerations:
             ""And even if the Sherman Act is held to apply to banking and to bank mergers, it seems clear that under the rule of reason
             spelled out in the Standard Oil case, different considerations will be found applicable, in a regulated field like banking, in
             determining whether activities would 'unduly diminish competition,' in the words of the Supreme Court in that case."" 106 Cong.
             Rec. 9711 (1960).  Moreover, this Court has recognized in other areas that it may be necessary to accommodate the Sherman
             Act to regulatory policy.  McLean Trucking Co. v.  United States, 321 U.S. 67, 83;  Federal Communications Comm'n v. RCA
             Communications, Inc., 346 U.S. 86, 91-92. See also  United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495, 527. And of course the
             Sherman Act is concerned more with existing anticompetitive effects than with future probabilities, and thus would not reach
             incipient restraints to the same extent as would § 7 of the Clayton Act. See Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294,
             317-318 and notes 32, 33. "
 249 ,30    ," In these respects a merger is precisely the contrary of what § 7 was originally designed to proscribe -- the secret acquisition of
             corporate control.  See the Court's opinion, ante, p. 338. "
 250 ,31    ," That the stock-acquisition provision was not intended to cover mergers is strongly suggested by the second paragraph of § 7:
             ""No corporation shall acquire . . . any part of the stock . . . of one or more corporations . . . where . . . the effect . . . of the use of
             such stock by the voting or granting of proxies . . . may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.""
             15 U. S. C. § 18. (Emphasis added.) After a merger has been consummated, the resulting corporation holds no stock in any
             party to the merger; thus there can be in this situation no such thing as a restraint of trade by ""the use"" of the voting power of
             acquired stock."

             to the concept of a ""line of commerce."" According to this interpretation the glass and metal container businesses, to the extent
             they compete, are in the same industry.  On the other hand, ""industry"" might also denote an aggregate of enterprises employing
             similar production and marketing facilities and producing products having markedly similar characteristics.  In many instances,
             the segments of economic endeavor embraced by these two concepts of ""industry"" will be substantially coextensive, since those
             who employ the same types of machinery to turn out the same general product often compete in the same market.  Since this is
             not such a case it will be helpful to use the word ""industry"" as referring to similarity of production facilities and products.  So
             viewed, ""interindustry competition"" becomes a meaningful concept. "
 274 ,3     ," The District Court found that the basic raw material used in the manufacture of cans, and the major cost factor bearing on their
             price is tin-coated steel (tin plate).  In some instances uncoated steel (blackplate) or aluminum is used instead of tin plate.  Other
             raw materials include soldering compounds, paints, varnishes, lithographic inks, paper and cartons for packaging.  Cans are
             rigid and unbreakable, can be hermetically sealed and are impermeable to gases.  They are lighter than glass containers, can be
             heat-processed faster, and are not chemically inert. Forty-nine members of the metal can industry are organized in a trade association known as the Can Manufacturers Institute
             which maintains a professional staff of three.  Acting largely through committees, it deals with various technical problems of the
             industry and carries out some promotional activities emphasizing the advantages of the metal can."
 274 ,4     ," According to the findings of the District Court, glass containers are made principally from sand, lime, and soda ash, and the
             major factor in determining their price is the cost of labor.  Glass containers are rigid, breakable, and chemically inert.  They can
             be hermetically sealed and, unlike many cans, can be easily resealed after they have been opened.  The industry recognizes
             two basic types of containers, the wide mouth and the narrow neck.  Members of this industry also have a trade association, the
             Glass Container Manufacturers Institute, which, through its 45 employees and its standing committees, carries on such activities
             as market research and promotion, technical research, package design and specifications, the development of standard testing
             and quality control procedures, problems of freight rates, labor relations, and liaison work with government.  In recent decades
             the expansion of the glass container industry has been more rapid than, and often realized at the expense of, the metal can
             industry.  During World War II, for example, substantial increments in the market served by glass container manufacturers were
             made possible by the short supply of tin plate. The third industry found by the District Court to be involved in this multi-industry competitive picture was the plastic container
             industry, which, though a relative newcomer, has enjoyed impressive growth since making its debut in the mid-1940's.  Its dollar
             sales volume is small compared with that of its metal and glass counterparts, but its growth has been and continues to be steady
             and rapid. "
 276 ,5     ," In 1952 Continental ran a series of advertisements emphasizing the following ""5 reasons why cans are an ideal container for
             baby foods:"" ""1. ECONOMICAL.  Baby food in cans is usually priced as low or lower than baby food packed in other containers. ""2. STERILE.  Processing sterilizes the inside, and light, dust and germs can't get into a hermetically sealed can. ""3. EXTRA SAFETY.  Cans are sealed to stay sealed until the consumer opens them. ""4. SHATTERPROOF.  Steel and tin won't break, shatter or chip. ""5. SAFE FOR LEFT-OVERS.  Food can be safely left in the can, just keep it covered and under refrigeration."" "
 277 ,6     ," Consumer preferences for glass or metal are often regional and traceable to factors other than the intrinsic superiority of the
             preferred container. For example, the one-way beer bottle was highly successful in Baltimore -- due in part to the efforts of ""a
             highly motivated leading brewer"" -- but failed to make headway in Detroit.  And though glass appears to have about 80% of the
             Nation's baby food business, as of the time of the merger cans had over 60% of the business west of the Mississippi.  According
             to one opinion in the record, all Canadian baby food moves in cans.  And an official of the Glass Container Manufacturers
             Institute reported to that body that pickles, preserves, and jams are packed in tin cans in Canada."
 277 ,7     ," Ford Sammis & Company, a firm of market economists, conducted for the Glass Container Manufacturers Institute market
             surveys of 28 different product classifications.  On the basis of over 3 1/4 million individual answers to questions asked in more
             than 12,000 personal interviews, Ford Sammis concluded the following: "
 278 ,      ," ""Every consumer product tends to standardize on a single type of container. Glass has become the standard, traditional
             container for a host of products, including catsup, salad dressings, salad oil, instant coffee, prune juice, mayonnaise, peanut
             butter, jams and syrup.  Other products have standardized on tin cans -- regular coffee, evaporated milk, dog food, and most
             fruits, vegetables and juices. ""However, no traditional market is ever secure for any type of container. Marketers are apt to try out new containers at any time,
             in their constant search for ways to increase sales. ""When this happens, the result is a period of container competition, which may run through one or more of three separate
             stages."""
 278 ,1     ," . Stage 1, according to the Sammis report, occurs when a new type of container is first introduced by a secondary brand. Thus
             ""[a] new container can become a potent sales force for a brand, if strong consumer preference exists (or is promoted) for that
             type of container. Recognizing this, secondary brands are constantly trying out new types of containers as sales incentive.
             While leading brands are ordinarily satisfied to maintain the status quo, secondary brands are willing to gamble to improve their
             positions."""
 278 ,2     ," . The second stage comes about in this manner: ""If a secondary brand increases its sales during the period when it is
             introducing a new type of container, the sales increase is usually attributed to the new container, by marketer and competitors
             alike.  Advertising, product changes or other factors may actually be more important than the new container, but circumstantial
             evidence points to the container. ""Leading brands are not prone to sit idly by while competitors cut into their share of the market.  They tend to cover competitors'

             cosmetics.  In assessing the likelihood that it could ""penetrate [the] tremendous market"" for soft drink containers Continental
             concluded ""assuming that the merchandising factors are favorable and that the product quality is well received, the upper limit on
             market acceptance will then be determined by price."" Continental also stated in an intercompany memorandum that in the fight
             between the beer can and the one-way bottle ""the key factor, in our estimation, is pricing,"" and concluded that a reduction in the
             price of one-way beer bottles was to ""be regarded as a further attempt on the part of the glass manufacturers to maintain their
             position in the one-way package field."" "

 280 ,10    ," Determination of market shares is made somewhat more difficult in this case than in the ordinary intraindustry merger because
             the indices of total production of the two industries are expressed differently, the metal container industry reporting to the
             Census Bureau in terms of tinplate consumed in manufacture, and the glass container industry in terms of units of containers.
             On the basis of figures and data supplied by the Census Bureau and the Can Manufacturers Institute the Government has
             derived a conversion factor showing the relationship between tinplate consumption and total containers manufactured, thereby
             permitting a comparison of the relative positions of the firms competing within the glass and metal container line of commerce. It
             would appear that the District Court relied on figures disclosed by application of this factor, since it found that American and
             Continental shipped approximately 38% and 33%, respectively, of the metal cans sold in the United States.   217 F.Supp., at
             773. Continental objects to the use of this conversion scheme, however, arguing that it ignores such considerations as size of cans
             and the returnable feature of some types of bottles. We are not persuaded.  Since different systems of statistical notation are
             employed by these industries, a common referential standard is an absolute prerequisite to a comparison of market shares.
             Consistent with this Court's declarations in other cases concerning the high degree of relevance of market shares to the effect of
             mergers on competition, we believe that slight variations one way or the other which may inhere in the use of a conversion
             formula should not blind us to the broad significance of the resulting percentages.  In the compilation of statistics ""precision in
             detail is less important than the accuracy of the broad picture presented."" Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S., at 342, n.

             production and sale of containers used for all purposes for which metal or glass containers may be used . . ."" (Brief, p. 18), it
             concedes the artificiality of this approach and, in so doing, itself rejects the market-share analysis adopted by the Court.  The

             regarding market shares simply because those traditional yardsticks are generally unavailable to measure the full consequences
             which an interindustry merger would have on competition."" (Brief, p. 22.) The test which the Government advocates is that it ""can satisfy its burden of showing that the merger may have the effect of
             substantially lessening competition by proving (a) the existence of substantial competition between two industries; (b) a high
             degree of concentration in either or both of the competing industries; and (c) the dominant positions of each of the merging
             companies in its respective industry."" (Brief, p. 22.) This approach, which has at least the virtue of facing up to its own logic,
             frankly disavows attention to a ""line of commerce."" The effect of the Court's approach is not markedly different from that of the
             Government's test, see infra, p. 476, and there is some suggestion in the last few pages of the Court's opinion that the Court
             appreciates this.  As discussed hereafter, however, there is nothing in the Court's opinion to support adoption of the "
 286 ,      ," Government's ""per se"" approach, and the facts developed in the District Court demonstrate that, so far as one can tell from this
             case at least, a per se approach to the problem of inter-industry competition is wholly inappropriate."
 286 ,7     ," If the competition between metal and glass containers is sufficient to constitute them collectively a ""line of commerce,"" why
             does their competition with plastic containers and ""other materials competing for the same business"" not require that all such
             containers be included in the same line of commerce? The Court apparently concedes that the competition is multilateral."

             to price changes, and specialized vendors.""  370 U.S., at 325 (footnote omitted).  While many of these factors weigh against the
             Court's conclusion that metal and glass containers should be combined in a single line of commerce, not one of them speaks for
             the Court's conclusion that they should be segregated from all other kinds of containers and together form a separate line of

             large part in drafting the bill, Hearings on H. R. 4995 before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 9,
             supplemented his oral testimony with a letter addressed in part to the proposed amendment: ""To amend the bill by inserting 'and brands,' after the words 'commodities of like grade and quality,' as suggested by Judge
             Watkins, although it may seem harmless at first sight, is a specious suggestion that would destroy entirely the efficacy of the bill
             against larger buyers. So amended, the bill would impose no limitation whatever upon price differentials, except as between
             different purchasers of the same brand. But where goods are put up under a private brand, there can only be one purchaser,
             namely the one for whom the brand is designed.  Neither Kroger nor any independent could use an A. & P. private brand of
             canned fruit, for example; and to so amend the bill would leave every manufacturer free to put up his standard goods under a
             private brand for a particular purchaser and give him any price discount or discriminations that he might demand. ""Under the Patman bill as it stands, manufacturers are still free to put up their products under private brands; but if they do so for
             one purchaser under his private brand, then they must be ready to do so on the same terms, relative to their comparative costs,
             for a competing purchaser under his private brand; and unless that equality of treatment is required and assured, the
             discriminations at which the bill is aimed cannot be suppressed."" Id., 2d Sess., at 469. "
 323 ,5     ," Borden argues that it spends large sums to ensure the high quality of its Borden brand milk on customers' shelves, inferring
             that there really is a difference between its own milk and the milk sold under private labels, at least by the time it reaches the
             consumer. Of course, if Borden could prove this difference, it is unlikely that the case would be here.  The findings are to the
             contrary in this case and we write on the premise that the two products are physically the same at the time of consumer
             purchase.  Borden's extra expenses in connection with its own milk are more relevant to the cost justification issue than to the
             question we have before us."
 323 ,6     ," The market acceptability test would hardly stop with insulating from inquiry the price differential between proprietary and private
             label sales.  That test would also immunize from the Act sales at different prices of the same product under two different
             producer-owned labels, the one being less advertised and having less market acceptability than the other.  And if it is ""consumer
             preferences,"" dissenting opinion, p. 648, which create the difference in grade or quality, why should not Borden be able to
             discriminate between two purchasers of private label milk, as long as one label commands a higher price from consumers than
             the other and hence is of a different grade and quality?  In this context perhaps the market acceptability test would be refined to
             preclude this differential on the grounds that Borden's customer, as distinguished from the consumer, will not pay more than his
             competitor for private label milk and therefore the milk sold by Borden under one private brand is really of the same grade and
             quality as the milk sold under the other brand even though ultimate consumers will pay more for one than the other.  Taking this
             approach, if Borden packed for one wholesale customer under two private labels, one having more consumer appeal than the "
 324 ,      ," other because of the customer's own advertising program, Borden must sell both brands at the same price it charges other
             private label customers because all such milk is of the same grade and quality.  At the same time, the customer buying from
             Borden under two labels could himself sell one label at a reduced price without inquiry under § 2 (a) because the milk in one
             container is no longer of the same grade and quality as that in the other, although both the milk and the containers came from
             Borden.  Such an approach would obviously focus not on consumer preference as determinative of grade and quality but on who
             spent the advertising money that created the preference -- Borden's customer, not Borden, created the preference and hence
             the milk is of the same grade and quality in Borden's hands but not in its customer's. The dissent would exempt the effective
             advertiser from the Act.  We think Congress intended to remit him to his defenses under the Act, including that of cost
             justification."

             been too much interested in [private label evaporated milk] . . . frankly if it was the same price as advertised or 15 cents or 25

 325 ,2     ," No suggestion is made that any of the private label brands involved in this case show significant commercial differentiation from
             one another.  It is possible, of course, that by extensive promotion private label brands could achieve consumer acceptance
             equivalent to that of a premium brand. In that situation, the products would still be economically different under the market test of
             § 2 (a) elucidated in this opinion, since the relevant comparison would exclude promotional efforts by persons other than the
             producer of the premium brand. Thus, promotional activities by customers of Borden in the present case could not affect the
             determination of ""like grade and quality"" with regard to sales by Borden.  Cf. Jordan, Robinson-Patman Act Aspects of Dual
             Distribution by Brand of Consumer Goods,  50 Cornell L. Q. 394, 406-407 (1965)."
 325 ,3     ," Cf. Chamberlin, The Theory of Monopolistic Competition 56 (8th ed. 1962): ""A general class of product is differentiated if any significant basis exists for distinguishing the goods (or services) of one seller
             from those of another.  Such a basis may be real or fancied, so long as it is of any importance whatever to buyers, and leads to
             a preference for one variety of the product over another.  Where such differentiation exists, even though it be slight, buyers will
             be paired with sellers, not by chance and at random (as under pure competition), but according to their preferences. "
 326 ,      ," ""Differentiation may be based upon certain characteristics of the product itself, such as exclusive patented features; trade-marks;
             trade names; peculiarities of the package or container, if any; or singularity in quality, design, color, or style. . . .  In so far as
             these and other intangible factors vary from seller to seller, the 'product' in each case is different, for buyers take them into
             account, more or less, and may be regarded as purchasing them along with the commodity itself."" See also Brown, Advertising and the Public Interest: Legal Protection of Trade Symbols,  57 Yale L. J. 1165, 1181 (1948): "". . . The buyer of an advertised good buys more than a parcel of food or fabric; he buys the pause that refreshes, the hand that
             has never lost its skill, the priceless ingredient that is the reputation of its maker.  All these may be illusions, but they cost money
             to create, and if the creators can recoup their outlay, who is the poorer?  Among the many illusions which advertising can
             fashion are those of lavishness, refinement, security, and romance.  Suppose the monetary cost of compounding a perfume is
             trivial; of what moment is this if the ads promise, and the buyer believes, that romance, even seduction, will follow its use?  The
             economist, whose dour lexicon defines as irrational any market behavior not dictated by a logical pecuniary calculus, may think it
             irrational to buy illusions; but there is a degree of that kind of irrationality even in economic man; and consuming man is full of it."""
 326 ,4     ," For example, a grocer testified in the proceedings before the Commission that: ""People are going into a grocery store to pick up groceries, the majority of the people buy something that is advertised that they
             have known for years or heard of for years or see highly advertised. They know it is a good product, they know it is fancy
             merchandise or best quality."" Another grocer testified that: ""A.  Some people say they want [Borden's] Silver Cow milk. In other words, for maybe a coupon on the side of the can or
             because they have been educated to want that brand. Some of them won't have anything but that.  Some of them won't have
             anything except Carnation, and some of them don't want anything except Pet. ""Q.  They don't care what price -- ""A.

 326 ,5     ," The results of a house-to-house survey conducted for Borden by National Analysts, Inc., indicated that consumers selected
             Borden's premium brand because of its superior quality.  Comparable studies have reached a similar conclusion.  Cf. ""Mom
             Feels Quality, not Ad Cost, Makes Brand Item Costlier, 'Good House' Reports,"" Advertising Age, Dec. 7, 1964, p. 30."
 326 ,6     ," Borden's Food Products Division maintained a staff of field representatives who inspected code-datings on cans of Borden
             brand milk in retail stores, in order to insure that older milk was sold first off the retailer's shelves.  A witness for Borden testified
             that the principal dangers of long storage were discoloration of the milk, precipitation of calcium and other minerals, and
             separation and hardening of fat from the milk. As a further precaution against sales of defective milk, Borden dispatched its milk
             to wholesalers and retailers under a first-packed, first-shipped rotation plan that occasionally involved high-cost shipments from
             distant plants or warehouses.  In addition, before shipment from a cold storage warehouse, Borden ""tempered"" its premium
             brand milk in order to prevent condensation on the cans, which might have resulted in rust to the cans and damage to the labels."
 326 ,7     ," As counsel for the respondent candidly stated on oral argument to the Court, ""The difference as to the private label brand
             packed by Borden is that, as to that product, the Borden Company washes its hands of it at the factory door."" "
 327 ,8     ," The Court's suggestion that the commentators are about equally divided upon the issue before us is somewhat misleading.  It
             is true that the members of the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws, Report, pp. 156-159 (1955),
             were sharply divided as to whether significant consumer preferences should be taken into account under the ""like grade and
             quality"" test of § 2 (a).  However, the very brief discussions of ""like grade and quality"" in Austin, Price Discrimination and Related
             Problems under the Robinson-Patman Act 39 (2d ed. 1959); Patman, Complete Guide to the Robinson-Patman Act 34-35

             consumer preferences, and the minimal discussion in Seidman is at best ambiguous, Price Discrimination Cases, reprinted in 2
             Hoffmann's Antitrust Law and Techniques 409, 427-428 (1963).  Those cursory treatments go no further than the view, with
             which I wholly agree, that no blanket exemption from § 2 (a) is available for private label brands. But that view in no sense
             disposes of the concrete issue presented in this case.  Commentators who have in fact focussed on the significance of
             consumer preferences uniformly favor inclusion of commercial acceptance in the test of ""like grade and quality."" Rowe, Price

 327 ,9     ," The Court's suggestion, ante, p. 644, that a difference in label alone would exclude the reach of § 2 (a) if a market test were
             accepted for ""like grade and quality"" is no part of the present case and has never been offered as a serious interpretation of § 2
             (a).  Nor is there any issue raised here as to whether, under a market test of § 2 (a), a dubious pricing and branding policy
             adopted by a seller could ""validate itself"" and escape the Act by creating precarious distinctions in grade or quality.  The price
             differential between Borden's premium and private label brands is concededly grounded upon a legitimate and stable market
             preference for the premium product.  Moreover, the Commission's willingness to engage in the exhaustive analysis of injury to
             competition and cost justification under its ""physical identity"" test of § 2 (a) demonstrates that the Commission's resources would
             be more than adequate to determine the level of commercial preference sufficient to negate a finding of ""like grade and quality""
             under a market test of § 2 (a)."
 327 ,10    ," Certain general language in the congressional reports may be taken, however, as supporting the interpretation that market
             factors are relevant in the construction of § 2 (a).  The Report of the House Committee on the Judiciary stated that the general
             object of the bill was ""to amend section 2 of the Clayton Act so as to suppress more effectually discriminations between
             customers of the same seller not supported by sound economic differences in their business positions . . . ."" H. R. Rep. No.

 327 ,11    ," The remarks of Representative Patman were even more offhand than the opinion of the Court indicates.  Prefacing the portion
             of his remarks quoted by the Court, Mr. Patman said, ""I only have a very short time, and I must finish my statement.  I have not
             time to discuss that feature . . . ."" "
 328 ,12    ," The predominant concern of Congress in enacting the Robinson-Patman amendments to the Clayton Act was to abolish the
             notorious price discriminations that infected the post-Depression economy, especially the blanket immunity then available for
             quantity discounts under § 2 of the Clayton Act. An obvious commercial evil at the time was the widespread practice of offering
             private label brands to favored customers at rates substantially lower than the rates offered to competing purchasers. The
             abortive attempt, vigorously opposed by Mr. Teegarden, to introduce ""and brands"" into the ""like grade and quality"" provision
             would have left that evil completely unremedied.  Cf. 80 Cong. Rec. 8234-8236 (rejection of amendments proposing the addition
             of ""and design"" and ""purchased under like conditions"" to the ""like grade and quality"" clause)."

             the finding of ""like grade and quality"" was either conceded by the respondent or not challenged.  In addition, in Hansen
             Inoculator, there was significant evidence that the private label product was in fact trading on the reputation of the premium
             product.  Further, in Hansen Inoculator, as in  Page Dairy Co., 50 F. T. C. 395, it is doubtful that even the labels on the two
             products were distinguishable.  In  Whitaker Cable Corp., 51 F. T. C. 958, the resale prices of both products were identical, so
             that no commercial preference could have been proved in any event.  Finally, in the first United States Rubber case and in
             Whitaker Cable Corp., there was substantial discrimination by the seller between various purchasers of the private label brands.
             In setting aside the order of the Commission in the present case, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit emphasized that in
             none of these cases was there any showing that the brand names affected the market price of the products sold."

 329 ,16    ," The Court's brief discussion of the adverse economic effect of the Fifth Circuit's ruling is concerned primarily with the
             supposed injury to secondary line competition.  The present proceeding arose as the direct result of the primary line injury
             caused to midwestern packers of private label evaporated milk when Borden expanded its plants in Tennessee and South
             Carolina to include private label operation, but the opinion of the Court nowhere discusses such competition. "
 330 ,17    ," It is not clear that the ""injury to competition"" and ""cost justification"" issues will be reached on the remand.  As the opinion of the
             Court suggests, ante, p. 646, the existence of price discrimination is an issue that remains open in the Court of Appeals.  If
             Borden is able to demonstrate that the price differential between its premium and private label brands is not a price
             discrimination, the inquiry by the Commission is at an end, and no issue of injury to competition or cost justification under § 2 (a)
             is reached.  Nothing in  FTC v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 363 U.S. 536, a case concerned only with territorial price discrimination,
             requires an equation in all circumstances between a price differential and price discrimination. So long as Borden makes private
             label brands available to all customers of its premium milk, it is unlikely that price discrimination within the meaning of § 2 (a) can

 331 ,20    ," The Commission concedes that there is no evidence in the record that Borden refused to sell private label milk to any
             customer who specifically requested it.  Borden's private label business in the period covered by these proceedings was
             substantial.  In 1957, Borden sold 4,300,000 cases of its premium brand evaporated milk and 1,100,000 cases of private label
             milk (government and export business excluded); net sales of these products were $ 27,600,000 and $ 5,700,000, respectively.
             A major source of Borden's private label business was provided by cooperative associations of wholesalers and retailers, so
             that, in fact, there was an opportunity for large numbers of small retailers to compete in the sale of private label brands of
             evaporated milk obtained from Borden.  One such group, whose purchases accounted for 11% of Borden's private label volume
             in 1957, had more than 1,000 retailer members.  Not all retailers, however, availed themselves of the opportunity to market
             private label milk. One wholesaler testified that, a year after his private label brand had been offered to the 600 retail grocers in
             his service area, only 50 of the grocers had become regular customers. "

 338 ,3     ," Since the evidence does not consistently distinguish between ""discount houses"" and ""referral services,"" based either on the
             variety of goods offered to the public or on the nature of the arrangement between the establishment and the franchised dealer
             which supplied it with cars, we shall hereinafter use the term ""discounter"" to embrace all such establishments. "
 339 ,4     ," One dealer, for example, paid its referral service one-third of the gross profit on each sale, up to $ 75, there being no fixed price
             at which the sale was to take place.  The same dealer earlier had paid a flat fee of $ 17.50 for every referral, whether or not the
             sale was consummated."
 339 ,5     ," At least one discount house actually purchased its cars from cooperative dealers, then resold them to its customers. In this
             situation, which in the trade is referred to as ""bootlegging,"" the customer does not receive a new-car warranty. General Motors,
             while disapproving of the practice, does not assert that it violates the ""location clause."" In those arrangements against which
             General Motors and the associations did direct their efforts, title to the new car passed directly from dealer to retail customer,
             who thus obtained a new-car warranty and service agreement. There must also be distinguished the ubiquitous practice of using ""bird dogs"" -- informal sources who steer occasional
             customers toward a particular dealer, in return for relatively small fees -- often a bottle of liquor.  This practice is not only deemed
             by General Motors not to violate the ""location clause,"" but has the corporation's endorsement as a desirable sales device."
 339 ,6     ," As the District Court found, 70% of the local Chevrolet dealers were located within five miles of one or more of the 23 discount
             house or referral outlets."
 339 ,7     ," There is evidence in the record that discount sales undercut the prices at which franchised dealers were able to, or chose to,
             compete.  Two purchasers of Chevrolets, one on referral and the other in a discount house ""sale,"" testified that they had
             ""shopped"" other dealers but found the discount and referral prices lower.  Dealers and their salesmen complained to General
             Motors about sales lost through inability to meet the discounters' price.  Moreover, the discounters advertised and actually
             provided auto loans at interest rates substantially lower than those offered by G. M. A. C., General Motors' financing subsidiary. There is also evidence that it was not just price itself which induced customers to purchase Chevrolets through the discounters.
             One customer testified that he preferred the discount house because he thereby avoided the haggling over price which seems
             an inevitable facet of purchasing a car in the orthodox way.  Others apparently assumed, without bothering to confirm by
             comparison shopping, that ""discount"" stores would offer lower prices.  This assumption was fed by discount house advertising
             which promised ""the lowest price anywhere"" and ""savings of hundreds of dollars."" "
 340 ,8     ," Dealer Biggs put the same sentiments into a letter to both Keown and Chevrolet's zone manager O'Connor, written on
             November 5, 1960.  The day before, in O'Connor's presence, Keown had challenged Biggs to justify his dealings with the
             discounters. Biggs wrote: ""We would be most reluctant to discard an account as good as this one without rather concrete
             assurance that it would not immediately be picked up by another Chevrolet dealer."" Two weeks later, O'Connor forwarded Biggs'
             letter to General Motors officials in Detroit."
 340 ,9     ," In Keown's words, ""We were seeking the assistance of the higher echelon officials of Chevrolet and General Motors in bringing
             about an end to the discount house sale of Chevrolets."""
 340 ,10    ," O'Connor's report, dated November 22, recounted that ""zone management"" had talked with the offending dealers ""in an
             attempt to have them desist,"" and that ""our Dealer Associations have formed a committee to call on the supplying dealers and
             have asked them and have attempted to persuade them to discontinue this practice."" Supported by a copy of dealer Biggs' letter,
             see n. 8, supra, O'Connor predicted that ""many dealers will cease this type of business if they had any assurance that the
             account would not be picked up by some other dealer, immediately upon relinquishment."""
 340 ,11    ," Roche wrote to those dealers who had complained directly to John Gordon, then president of General Motors.  On December
             29, 1960, a virtually identical letter went out to all General Motors dealers throughout the Nation, under the signature of the
             general sales managers for the respective divisions."
 340 ,12    ," One dealer testified that he abruptly terminated arrangements long maintained with two discount houses, despite the fact that
             one of these connections owed him $ 20,000 and the other $ 28,000.  In the preceding four weeks the latter had reduced its
             indebtedness by $ 52,000 and could reasonably have been expected to erase it completely within a few weeks.  The dealer
             anticipated that upon cancellation of the accounts these debts would become uncollectible.  His fears were justified.  The
             accounts were terminated.  The debts remained unpaid. "
 341 ,13    ," According to Francis Bruder, a dealer who had been doing business with the discounters since 1957, ""Cash told me that he
             felt certain that the other dealers would discontinue dealing with discount houses and referral services as well.  I left this meeting
             with the impression that every dealer who had been doing business with a discount house or referral service would soon quit."" This was precisely the impression General Motors had intended to implant.  As was explained in an inter-office memorandum to
             the general sales manager of General Motors' Chevrolet Division, ""[All dealers were talked to] in order that every dealer with
             whom the subject was discussed would know that a similar discussion was being held with all other dealers so that, if certain
             dealers should elect to discontinue their cooperation with a discount house, we might be able to discourage some other dealer
             who might be solicited from starting the practice."""
 341 ,14    ," The District Court characterized this December 15 meeting as the first between representatives of the three associations,
             pertaining to the problem of discount house and referral sales.  However, as we have previously noted, n. 10, supra, O'Connor
             reported to General Motors three weeks earlier, on November 22, that the three associations had formed a committee which
             already had called upon nonconforming dealers. The record does not enable us to resolve this factual conflict, nor is its
             resolution important.  On either version, the appellee associations entered into an explicit agreement to act together to eliminate
             the new mode of intrabrand competition. "
 342 ,15    ," The Government's complaint contains no reference to the ""location clause,"" and the Government concedes that its case was
             tried on a conspiracy theory, the defendants injecting the contractual issue by way of defense.  Trial counsel for the Government
             did advert to the clause in the District Court, but it does not appear that he challenged its validity, as construed, in the same
             sense that the Government does here.  See Trial Transcript, pp. 9, 17-18.  In light of our disposition of the case, we have no
             occasion to consider whether the Government's argument directed to the clause, as construed, is properly before us. "
 343 ,16    ," We note that, as in  United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29, 44-45, the ultimate conclusion by the trial judge, that the
             defendants' conduct did not constitute a combination or conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act, is not to be shielded by the
             ""clearly erroneous"" test embodied in Rule 52 (a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. That Rule in part provides: ""Findings of
             fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the trial court to judge of
             the credibility of the witnesses."" As in  Parke Davis, supra, the question here is not one of ""fact,"" but consists rather of the legal
             standard required to be applied to the undisputed facts of the case.  See  United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 194, n.
             9;  United States v. Mississippi Valley Co., 364 U.S. 520, 526, and cases there cited. Moreover, the trial court's customary opportunity to evaluate the demeanor and thus the credibility of the witnesses, which is the
             rationale behind Rule 52 (a) (see  United States v. Oregon State Med. Soc., 343 U.S. 326, 331-332), plays only a restricted role
             here.  This was essentially a ""paper case."" It did not unfold by the testimony of ""live"" witnesses.  Of the 38 witnesses who gave
             testimony, only three appeared in person.  The testimony of the other 35 witnesses was submitted either by affidavit, by
             deposition, or in the form of an agreed-upon narrative of testimony given in the earlier criminal proceeding before another judge.
             A vast number of documents were also introduced, and bear on the question for decision. In any event, we resort to the record not to contradict the trial court's findings of fact, as distinguished from its conclusory
             ""findings,"" but to supplement the court's factual findings and to assist us in determining whether they support the court's ultimate
             legal conclusion that there was no conspiracy. "
 344 ,17    ," The December letters to all dealers said only that ""in effect, in some instances"" the arrangements in question might violate the
             unauthorized location clause of the Dealer Selling Agreement.  No dealer was told, either by letter or in person, that its conduct
             violated the franchise agreement, and no dealer was warned that continuance of discount house or referral sales would result in
             termination of its franchise. Zone manager O'Connor did not regard his instructions from Detroit as authorizing him to go that far,
             and he was of the view that ""the general letter [to all dealers] didn't suggest any such thing."""
 344 ,18    ,We refer to this without considering whether General Motors could lawfully have taken such action.
 344 ,19    ," James Roche testified, ""It is not [General Motors'] practice to threaten dealers with termination of their franchise."" Good
             dealers and dealer locations, he said, are hard to come by.  In many dealerships, General Motors itself has invested substantial
             funds.  Therefore, said Roche, ""we would not want our people to go in and wave the franchise agreement, selling agreement,
             and threaten the dealer with termination in the event he didn't agree, after following -- after reading a letter he was violating our
             agreement and should change his practice.  Instead we expected that this would be handled on a sound, calm, sensible
             business-like approach."" HN3[

             vis-a-vis the discounters, it was stated that ""It would appear that one of the real hazards of condoning this type of operation is
             that discounted prices are freely quoted to a large portion of the public."" Moreover, we note that some discounters advertised
             that they would finance new-car purchases at an interest rate of 5 1/2%, a rate substantially lower than that available at
             franchised Chevrolet dealers through G. M. A. C., a subsidiary of General Motors Corporation.  See n. 7, supra.  Finally, it is
             conceded that General Motors is intensely concerned that each of its dealers has an adequate ""profit opportunity"" (see Finding
             17), a concern which necessarily involves consideration of the price realized by dealers. "

             extensive study of the retail grocery industry on a national scale, the Federal Trade Commission found that between 1939 and
             1954 the total number of grocery stores in the United States declined by 109,000, or 28%.  The entire decrease was suffered by
             stores with annual gross sales of less than $ 50,000.  During the same period, the number of stores in all higher sales brackets
             increased.  The Commission noted that the census figures, from which its data were taken, included an undetermined number of
             grocery firms liquidating after 1948 that merely closed their grocery operations and continued their remaining lines of business,

             Law and Economics,  74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 312, n. 261: ""There are serious problems connected with the use of this yardstick.  First, not every firm contributes equally to competition.  In
             particular, there may be a fringe of firms too small to be able to affect price and production policies in the market as a whole.
             Alternatively, certain firms may be marginal in the sense that their costs and financial situations preclude them from having
             much, if any, impact on market conditions; indeed they may be able to remain in operation only because excessive profits are "

             and the average population per grocery store increased from 695 to 1,439.  Additional opportunity for new stores in the area
             results from the geographical division of the city into numerous suburbs, as well as from the lack of specific store loyalty among
             new residents."
 360 ,14    ," Cf.   Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726. In criticizing a recent decision of the Federal Trade Commission, one commentator
             has stated, in terms applicable mutatis mutandis to the Court's decision in the present case: "". . . Any child alive in the 1950's could see that a restructuring of food retailing was then going on.  The business was adjusting
             itself, through market mechanisms that included merger, to vast and profound changes in the American way of life.  There is not
             a word in the FTC majority opinion that relates changes in the number of stores and chains to the proliferation of suburbs, the
             construction of shopping centers, and the final triumph of the supermarket -- an innovation in retailing that has since spread
             across the Western world.  The most important single cause of these changes was the automobile revolution . . . which not even
             the FTC can stop. . . . "". . . Plenty of living American men and women remember an era when virtually all groceries were sold through very small stores
             none of which had 'any significant market share.' Was this era the high point of competition in food retailing? Many little towns
             had, in fact, only one place where a given kind of food could be bought.  In a typical city neighborhood, defined by the range of a
             housewife's willingness to lug groceries home on foot, there might be three or four relaxed 'competitors.' If she did not like the
             price or quality offered by them, she could take her black-string market bag, board a trolley car, and try her luck among the
             relaxed 'competitors' of some other neighborhood."" Ways, A New ""Worst"" in Antitrust, Fortune, April 1966, pp. 111-112. In the present case, the District Court found that in the era preceding the rise of the supermarkets, ""the area from which the
             typical store drew most of its customers was limited to a block or two in any direction and if a particular grocery store happened
             to be the only one in its immediate neighborhood, it had a virtual monopoly of local trade."" Thus, the Court's aphorism in U.S. v.
             Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 363 -- that ""competition is likely to be greatest when there are many sellers, none of which
             has any significant market share"" -- is peculiarly maladroit in the historic context of the retail food industry. See also Hampe &
             Wittenberg, The Lifeline of America: Development of the Food Industry 313-372 (1964); Lebhar, Chain Stores in America 1859-

             addition, the overall market share of the top 20 firms in fact showed a slight decline between 1958 and 1960.  The statement in
             the concurring opinion in the present case, that ""All but two of the top 10 firms in 1958 were very probably also among the top 10
             in 1948 or had acquired a firm that was among the top 10,"" is based on conjecture.  The record demonstrates only that the top
             four firms in 1948 were among the top 10 firms in 1958; the record neither identifies the remaining six of the top 10 firms in 1948
             nor charts their subsequent history."

 361 ,17    ," Of these latter 119 chains, 66 went out of business altogether, 28 reduced their operations to a single store, and 25 were
             eliminated as separate competitors as a result of acquisitions by other chains."
 361 ,18    ," [****37] On the basis of these facts, one witness concluded: ""The apparent willingness and ability of grocers to expand and create new chain entities at the staggering rate of more than 17 a
             year, and the growth potential of new chains, precludes in my opinion the possibility that the retail grocery business in Los
             Angeles will become either monopolistic or oligopolistic in the foreseeable future.  It must be remembered that in 1953, only 10
             chains with as many as 10 stores each were operating in the area.  These chains are recognized as being among the best
             managed, most successful and most aggressive supermarket operators in the country.  They themselves have engaged in
             expansion programs of significant proportions since 1953.  Yet, 10 years later, instead of having swept aside all competition and
             being left alone to compete among themselves, these same 10 chains are now faced with the necessity of competing against no
             less than 14 new chains of 10 or more stores each, a significantly greater number of smaller chains and a host of successful
             single store operators, of whom many are affiliated with powerful voluntary chains or other cooperative groups. . . .  The growth "
 362 ,      ," of independents into chains and of small chains into larger ones . . . demonstrates convincingly that small concerns don't have to
             remain small in Los Angeles."""
 362 ,19    ," [****38] Data for 1960, the only year for which such figures are available in the record, reveal a comparable agitation of entry
             and exit among operators of single stores.  Although there was a net loss of 132 single-outlet stores in 1960, 128 new single-
             outlet stores opened during the year."
 362 ,20    ," As to Table 1 in the Appendix of the Court's opinion, this fact is obvious on the face of the table.  As to Table 2 in the
             Appendix, examination of the record discloses that each of the nine acquisitions listed as involving a single store represented
             purchases of single stores from chains ranging in size from two to 49 stores."

             a partnership of the Von der Ahe family in 1932, during the depression, with a food concession in a small grocery store.
             Shopping Bag operated 36 stores in Los Angeles at the time of the merger; it commenced operation as a partnership in a small
             grocery store in 1930.  So far as the record reveals, the competitive behavior of these firms was impeccable throughout their
             expansion, which took place solely by internal growth.  In discussing the success of comparable firms vis-a-vis the Sherman Act,
             Judge Learned Hand stated, ""The Act does not mean to condemn the resultant of those very forces which it is its prime object to
             foster: finis opus coronat.  The successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he wins.""

             Angeles market was only 4.2%, its sales in 1958 totaled $ 84,000,000.  Compare the Court's statement in Tampa Electric Co. v.
             Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 333-334: ""It is urged that the present contract pre-empts competition to the extent of purchases worth perhaps $ 128,000,000, and that
             this 'is, of course, not insignificant or insubstantial.' While $ 128,000,000 is a considerable sum of money, even in these days,
             the dollar volume, by itself, is not the test . . . ."""

             dictum, ante, p. 277, undercuts even that principle by confining it to cases in which competitors are obliged to merge to save
             themselves from destruction by a larger and more powerful competitor."

             not whether I can compete against them, but whether they can compete against me."" Another single-store operator testified, ""Competition in the grocery business is on a store-by-store basis and any aggressive and
             able operator like myself can out-compete the store of any of the chains because of personalized service, better labor relations,
             and being in personal charge of the store and seeing that it is run properly."" A third single-store operator testified, ""The chains in this area are good operators, but when they grow too large, they are
             actually easier to compete with from an independent's viewpoint.  If I had a choice, I would rather operate a store near a chain

             leading chains in the area began development in association with Certified Grocers, called the ""mother"" of the industry.  In some
             cases the cooperatives were able to offer even lower prices to their members than competing chains could obtain.  The District
             Court found that the cooperatives also provided their members with assistance in merchandising, advertising, promotions,

             the six largest firms increased from 32.1% to 35.4%.  The merger involved in Philadelphia Nat. Bank produced a single firm
             controlling 30% of the market, and resulted in an increase from 44% to 59% in the market share of the two largest firms in the
             market.  The Court's opinion is remarkable for its failure to support its conclusion by reference to even a single piece of
             economic theory.  I shall not dwell here on the barometers of competition that have been suggested by the commentators.  But it
             seems important to note that the present merger falls either outside, or at the very fringe, of the various mechanical tests that
             have been proposed.  See, e. g., Kaysen & Turner, Antitrust Policy 133-136 (1959) (horizontal merger with direct competitor is
             prima facie unlawful where acquiring company accounts for 20% or more of the market, or where merging companies together
             constitute 20% or more of the market; acquisitions producing less than 20% market control unlawful only where special
             circumstances are present, such as serious barriers to entry or substantial influence on prices by the acquired company); Stigler,
             Mergers and Preventive Antitrust Policy,  104 U. Pa. L. Rev. 176, 179-182 (1955) (acquisition unlawful if it produces a combined
             market share of 20% or more; acquisition permitted if the combined share is less than 5-10%); Bok, Section 7 of the Clayton Act
             and the Merging of Law and Economics,  74 Harv. L. Rev. 226, 308-329 (1960) (no merger by the dominant firm in an industry if
             its market share is increased by more than 2-3%; no merger by other large firms in the industry where the combined market
             shares of the two-to-eight largest firms after the merger are increased by 7-8% or more over the shares that existed at any time

             denied,  377 U.S. 978 (1964). See Recent Cases,  77 Harv. L. Rev. 1539, 1542 (1964)."
 384 ,4     ," For the proposition that the Commission must have express statutory authority to seek injunctions in the courts of appeals two
             cases are cited.  The first,  Humphrey's Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), has no relevance to our problem.  And
             the other,  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Eastman Kodak Co., 274 U.S. 619, 623-625 (1927), even though apposite, has been
             repudiated.  It held that in fashioning a final decree the Commission ""exercises only the administrative functions delegated to it "
 385 ,      ," by the Act,"" and, therefore, could not order divestiture of laboratories acquired through a stock purchase.  This view was rejected
             in Pan American World Airways, Inc. v.  United States, 371 U.S. 296, 312-313, nn. 17-18 (1963), the Court holding that ""the
             power to order divestiture need not be explicitly included in the powers of an administrative agency to be part of its arsenal of
             authority,"" citing Gilbertville Trucking Co. v.  United States, 371 U.S. 115 (1962)."
 385 ,5     ," Such a holding would especially interfere with the functions Congress has given the Commission in the merger field.  As THE
             CHIEF JUSTICE stated in Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370 U.S. 294 (1962), the Congress ""sought to assure the Federal
             Trade Commission and the courts the power to brake this force [business concentration] at its outset and before it gathered
             momentum."" At 317-318.  But without standing to secure injunctive relief, and thereby safeguard its ability to order an effective
             divestiture of acquired properties, the Commission's efforts would be frustrated.  As MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS said in  United
             States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S. 173, 186 (1944): ""The acquisition of a competing theatre terminates at once its competition. . . .  And where businesses have been merged or
             purchased and closed out it is commonly impossible to turn back the clock."" Here the plan of merger itself contemplates the sale of the acquired home delivery milk routes and certain milk plants.  In
             addition, Bowman has retained its cash and securities, with the intention ultimately to distribute them to its stockholders.  If
             consummation of the merger is not restrained, the restoration of Bowman as an effective and viable competitor will obviously be
             impossible by the time a final order is entered.  This is not unusual.  Administrative experience shows that the Commission's
             inability to unscramble merged assets frequently prevents entry of an effective order of divestiture.  E. g., Ekco Products Co.,
             Trade Reg. Rep. para. 16,879 (1964) (1963-1965 Transfer Binder), aff'd,  347 F.2d 745 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1965);  Foremost Dairies,

 389 ,2     ," On the contrary, the common view is that such authority is entirely lacking.  See, e. g., Kaysen & Turner, Antitrust Policy 258

 389 ,3     ," The Court's opinion asserts, in alleged demonstration of the ""ancillary powers"" which have been inferred on the Commission's
             behalf, that it may bring ""contempt actions in the appropriate court of appeals when the court's enforcement orders were
             violated, though it has no statutory authority in this respect."" The Court errs.  The Commission's powers in this respect are not
             ""implied."" The machinery by which the Commission procures compliance with its orders is, and always has been, spelled out by
             statute.  Until 1959, one could with impunity violate an FTC Clayton Act order.  Such an order was not final until the respondent
             sought judicial review and a Court of Appeals granted enforcement.  Disobedience thereafter was a contempt of court.  In the
             event the respondent did not seek review, the Commission was required to ascertain that he was violating its order and then
             proceed, pursuant to express statutory provision (15 U. S. C. § 21), to seek enforcement in the courts of appeals.  See 28 U. S.
             C. § 2112 (1964 ed.), authorizing the courts of appeals to promulgate rules for enforcement proceedings; and see, e. g., 1st Cir.
             R. 16.  Cf.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 70.  A violation thereafter constituted contempt of court.  The courts declined to infer any more
             convenient substitute for this three-step process.  See  Federal Trade Comm'n v. Henry Broch & Co., 368 U.S. 360, 365;
             Federal Trade Comm'n v. Ruberoid Co., 343 U.S. 470, 477-479. The statute was amended in 1959.  An FTC order under the Clayton Act is now final upon expiration of the time allowed
             respondent to seek judicial review.  If he does not appeal the order and violates its terms after it becomes final, the Government
             may proceed, pursuant to statute (15 U. S. C. §§ 21 (g) and (l)), to seek civil penalties of up to $ 5,000 per violation. In short, and contrary to the suggestion in the Court's opinion, the Commission's power to enforce compliance with its orders is
             and has been wholly statutory.  Nothing has been left to implication. "

 391 ,7     ," The Court declares that these materials are irrelevant because Congress had before it proposals to authorize the Commission
             itself to issue restraining orders pendente lite or to apply to the district courts for such relief.  But the fact that no one proposed
             and Congress did not consider providing that the Commission might have recourse to the courts of appeals merely emphasizes
             the extreme and extraordinary nature of the device which the Court today creates.  The plain fact, and the short answer, is that
             Congress refused to authorize preliminary restraints at the command of the Commission.  Its refusal to authorize such relief in
             the district courts demonstrates, a fortiori, that it would not create such a remedy in the courts of appeals. The Court also suggests that it would be improper to draw conclusions from congressional inaction.  The inference that I draw
             from congressional refusal to make preliminary injunctive relief available to the FTC is that such inaction confirms (a) that
             Congress in devising the statutory plan did not intend the Commission to have such power, and (b) that the relief sought is not
             consonant with the congressional plan for administering § 7.  In fact, this is not a situation where the agency went to Congress in
             the belief that its authority was unclear, or to remove doubts concerning it.  Compare  United States v. Speers, 382 U.S. 266,
             274-275;  United States v. du Pont & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 590;  Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 339 U.S. 33, 47-48. Here, there is
             no doubt that the agency sought additional powers, not clarification.  It admitted -- it asserted -- that it had no present authority to
             obtain preliminary relief (see Appendix to this opinion).  It sought what it confessedly did not have.  It sought this not once, but
             repeatedly, over a period of 10 years.  Congress did not grant its request.  Nor should we.  See Fribourg Navig. Co. v.
             Commissioner, 383 U.S. 272, 279-286;  Blau v. Lehman, 368 U.S. 403, 412-413."

             sources of United's market power were identified, the court pointed to ""the magnetic ties inherent in its system of leasing, and
             not selling, its more important machines"" and to the ""'partnership'"" aspects of leasing but not selling those machines.  110
             F.Supp., at 344. The leases assured ""closer and more frequent contacts between United and its customers than would exist if
             United were a seller and its customers were buyers.""  Id., at 343. A shoe manufacturer by leasing was ""deterred more than if he
             owned that same United machine, or if he held it on a short lease carrying simple rental provisions and a reasonable charge for
             cancelation before the end of the term.""  Id., at 340. The lease system had ""aided United in maintaining a pricing system which
             discriminates between machine types,""  id., at 344, discrimination which the court later said had evidenced ""United's monopoly
             power, a buttress to it, and a cause of its perpetuation . . . .""  Id., at 349."
 472 ,4     ," In its brief on appeal from the judgment and decree rendered in the Government's case, United recognized that ""the principal
             practices which the [District] Court stressed were that defendant offered important complicated machines only for lease and not
             for sale and that defendant serviced the leased machines without a separate charge."" Brief for Appellant 6, United Shoe "
 473 ,      ," Machinery Corp. v.  United States, 347 U.S. 521 (1954). United also said that ""evidently the Court below regarded the fact that
             United distributes its more important machines only by lease and not by sale as the basic objection to the system."" Id., at 170."
 473 ,5     ," The Court of Appeals affirmed this finding and we do not disturb it.  See also n. 16, infra.  We also agree with the courts below
             that in the circumstances of this case it was unnecessary for Hanover to prove an explicit demand during the damage period.
             See Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699 (1962)."
 473 ,6     ," The chronology of events with respect to this issue in the lower courts was as follows: After the pretrial conference, a separate
             issue which was thought might determine the action was set for trial pursuant to Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 42 (b).  The general
             question was whether, assuming that Hanover had paid illegally high prices for machinery leased from United, Hanover had
             passed the cost on to its customers, and if so whether it had suffered legal injury for which it could recover under the antitrust
             laws. After evidence had been taken on the issue, Judge Goodrich, sitting by designation, ruled that when Hanover had been
             forced to pay excessive prices for machinery leased from United, it had suffered a legal injury: ""This excessive price is the
             injury.""  185 F.Supp. 826, 829 (D. C. M. D. Pa. 1960). He also rejected the argument ""that the defendant is relieved of liability
             because the plaintiff passed on its loss to its customers."" Ibid.  In his view it was unnecessary to determine whether Hanover had
             passed on the illegal burden because Hanover's injury was complete when it paid the excessive rentals and because ""'the
             general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step'"" and to exonerate a defendant by
             reason of remote consequences.   Id., at 830 (quoting from Southern Pacific Co. v.  Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.S. 531,
             533 (1918)). The Court of Appeals heard an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (b) and affirmed.   281 F.2d 481
             (C. A. 3d Cir. 1960). Certiorari was denied.   364 U.S. 901 (1960). United preserved the issue and presented it again to the Court
             of Appeals in appealing the treble-damage judgment entered after trial of the main case.  The Court of Appeals adhered to the
             principles of its prior decision.  United brought the question here. "
 474 ,7     ," ""It is, however, contended that even if it be assumed the facts show an illegal combination, they do not show injury to the
             plaintiffs by reason thereof.  The contention is untenable.  Section 7 of the act gives a cause of action to any person injured in
             his person or property by reason of anything forbidden by the act and the right to recover three-fold the damages by him
             sustained.  The plaintiffs alleged a charge over a reasonable rate and the amount of it.  If the charge be true that more than a
             reasonable rate was secured by the combination, the excess over what was reasonable was an element of injury.  Texas &
             Pacific Ry. Co. v.  Abilene Cotton Oil Co., 204 U.S. 426, 436. The unreasonableness of the rate and to what extent
             unreasonable was submitted to the jury and the verdict represented their conclusion.""  243 U.S., at 88."
 474 ,8     ," Southern Pacific Co. v.  Darnell-Taenzer Lumber Co., 245 U.S. 531 (1918), involved an action for reparations brought by
             shippers against a railroad.  The shippers alleged exaction of an unreasonably high rate.  To the claim that the shippers should
             not recover because they were able to pass on to their customers the damage they sustained by paying the charge, the Court
             said that the answer was not difficult: ""The general tendency of the law, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step.  As it does not attribute
             remote consequences to a defendant so it holds him liable if proximately the plaintiff has suffered a loss.  The plaintiffs suffered
             losses to the amount of the verdict when they paid.  Their claim accrued at once in the theory of the law and it does not inquire
             into later events. . . .  The carrier ought not to be allowed to retain his illegal profit, and the only one who can take it from him is
             the one that alone was in relation with him, and from whom the carrier took the sum. . . .  Probably in the end the public pays the
             damages in most cases of compensated torts.""  245 U.S., at 533-534.  Adams v. Mills, 286 U.S. 397 (1932), is to the same
             effect.  See also I. C. C. v.  United States, 289 U.S. 385 (1933). Keogh v. Chicago & N. W. R. Co., 260 U.S. 156 (1922), is relied upon by United as stating a contrary rule.  There the Court
             affirmed a judgment on the pleadings in a shipper's action under the antitrust laws charging a conspiracy among railroads to set
             unreasonably high rates.  Because the rates had been approved as reasonable after a proceeding before the Interstate
             Commerce Commission, the shipper was held to have no cause of action under the antitrust laws. After giving this and other
             reasons for its judgment, the Court ended its opinion by saying that it would have been impossible for the shipper to have proved
             damages since no court could say that if the rate had been lower the shipper would have enjoyed the difference; the benefit
             might have gone to his customers. The Court, however, was careful to say earlier in its opinion that the result would have been
             different had the rate been unreasonably high, an approach confirmed by Mr. Justice Brandeis in  Adams v. Mills, supra. We
             ascribe no general significance to the Keogh dictum for cases where the plaintiff is free to prove that he has been charged an
             illegally high price.  It should also be noted that the Court, in speaking of the impossibility of proving damages, indicated no
             intention to preclude recovery in cases such as Chattanooga Foundry or  Thomsen v. Cayser, supra. That is where the matter stood in this Court when the issue came to be pressed with some regularity in the lower federal courts
             in treble-damage suits brought by customers of vendors who were charged with violating the Sherman Act by price fixing or
             monopolization. Some courts sustained the defense, both where the plaintiff complained of overcharging for materials or
             services used by him to produce his own product, e. g.,  Wolfe v. National Lead Co., 225 F.2d 427 (C. A. 9th Cir.), cert. denied,
             350 U.S. 915 (1955), and where the price fixing concerned articles purchased for resale, e. g., Miller Motors, Inc. v.  Ford Motor
             Co., 252 F.2d 441 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1958); Twin Ports Oil Co. v.  Pure Oil Co., 119 F.2d 747 (C. A. 8th Cir.), cert. denied,  314 U.S.
             644 (1941). Others, beginning with Judge Goodrich's 1960 decision in the case before us, deemed it irrelevant that the plaintiff
             may have passed on the burden of the overcharge. Recently, for example, the defense was rejected in the cases brought
             against manufacturers of electrical equipment by local utilities who purchased equipment at unlawfully inflated prices and used it "
 475 ,      ," to produce electricity sold to the ultimate consumer.  E. g., Atlantic City Electric Co. v.  General Electric Co., 226 F.Supp. 59 (D.
             C. S. D. N. Y.), interlocutory appeal refused,  337 F.2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1964). Concerning the passing-on defense generally, see Clark, The Treble Damage Bonanza: New Doctrines of Damages in Private
             Antitrust Suits,  52 Mich. L. Rev. 363 (1954); Pollock, Standing to Sue, Remoteness of Injury, and the Passing-On Doctrine, 32
             A. B. A. Antitrust L. J. 5 (1966); Note, Private Treble Damage Antitrust Suits: Measure of Damages for Destruction of All or Part
             of a Business,  80 Harv. L. Rev. 1566, 1584-1586 (1967)."
 475 ,9     ," The mere fact that a price rise followed an unlawful cost increase does not show that the sufferer of the cost increase was
             undamaged.  His customers may have been ripe for his price rise earlier; if a cost rise is merely the occasion for a price increase
             a businessman could have imposed absent the rise in his costs, the fact that he was earlier not enjoying the benefits of the
             higher price should not permit the supplier who charges an unlawful price to take those benefits from him without being liable for
             damages.  This statement merely recognizes the usual principle that the possessor of a right can recover for its unlawful
             deprivation whether or not he was previously exercising it. "
 476 ,10    ," Some courts appear to have treated price discrimination cases under the Robinson-Patman Act as in this category.  See, e. g.,
             American Can Co. v.  Russellville Canning Co., 191 F.2d 38 (C. A. 8th Cir. 1951); American Can Co. v.  Bruce's Juices, 187
             F.2d 919, opinion modified,  190 F.2d 73 (C. A. 5th Cir.), petition for cert. dismissed,  342 U.S. 875 (1951)."
 476 ,11    ," The Court of Appeals held that Hanover was entitled to damages only up to June 1, 1955, the date upon which Judge
             Wyzanski approved United's plan for terminating all outstanding leases and converting the lessee's rights to ownership.
             Because Hanover could have legally required United to convert from leasing to selling as of June 1, 1955, the Court of Appeals
             held it was not entitled to damages for United's failure to offer machines for sale after that date.  This determination has not been
             challenged in this Court. "
 477 ,12    ," Although the defendants in American Tobacco had been found guilty of conspiracy to restrain trade and of attempt and
             conspiracy to monopolize as well as of monopolization itself, the grant of certiorari was ""limited to the question whether actual
             exclusion of competitors is necessary to the crime of monopolization under § 2 of the Sherman Act.""  324 U.S. 836 (1945). After
             noting that ""§§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act require proof of conspiracies which are reciprocally distinguishable from and
             independent of each other . . . ,""  328 U.S., at 788, the Court determined that the jury could have found that the defendants had
             combined and conspired to monopolize,  id., at 797, and that it would be ""only in conjunction with such a combination or
             conspiracy that these cases will constitute a precedent,""  id., at 798. The Court stated that ""the authorities support the view that
             the material consideration in determining whether a monopoly exists is not that prices are raised and that competition actually is
             excluded but that power exists to raise prices or to exclude competition when it is desired to do so,""  328 U.S., at 811 (emphasis
             added), and quoted with approval from  United States v. Patten, 187 F. 664, 672 (C. C. S. D. N. Y. (1911)), reversed on other
             grounds,  226 U.S. 525 (1913), that for there to be monopolization ""it is not necessary that the power thus obtained should be
             exercised.  Its existence is sufficient."" The Court also said: ""A correct interpretation of the statute and of the authorities makes it the crime of monopolizing, under § 2 of the Sherman Act,
             for parties, as in these cases, to combine or conspire to acquire or maintain the power to exclude competitors from any part of
             the trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, provided they also have such a power that they are
             able, as a group, to exclude actual or potential competition from the field and provided that they have the intent and purpose to
             exercise that power.  See  United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 226, n. 59 and authorities cited. ""It is not the form of the combination or the particular means used but the result to be achieved that the statute condemns.  It is
             not of importance whether the means used to accomplish the unlawful objective are in themselves lawful or unlawful.""  328 U.S.,
             at 809. (Emphasis added.) The Court also welcomed the opportunity to endorse,  328 U.S., at 813-814, the following views of Chief Judge Hand in  Alcoa,
             148 F.2d., at 431-432: ""[Alcoa] insists that it never excluded competitors; but we can think of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace
             each new opportunity as it opened, and to face every newcomer with new capacity already geared into a great organization,
             having the advantage of experience, trade connections and the elite of personnel.  Only in case we interpret 'exclusion' as
             limited to manoeuvres not honestly industrial, but actuated solely by a desire to prevent competition, can such a course,
             indefatigably pursued, be deemed not 'exclusionary.' So to limit it would in our judgment emasculate the Act; would permit just
             such consolidations as it was designed to prevent. . . . . ""In order to fall within § 2, the monopolist must have both the power to monopolize, and the intent to monopolize. To read the
             passage as demanding any 'specific,' intent, makes nonsense of it, for no monopolist monopolizes unconscious of what he is
             doing."""
 477 ,13    ," Any view of the earlier law of monopolization which would attempt, erroneously in our opinion, to find a requirement of
             predatory practices must rely heavily on certain dicta in  United States v. United States Steel Corp., 251 U.S. 417, 451 (1920)
             (Mr. Justice McKenna for a four-to-three Court), and  United States v. International Harvester Co., 274 U.S. 693, 708 (1927) (Mr.
             Justice Sanford reiterating the dicta in U.S. Steel).  The commentators cited by United for the proposition that predatory
             practices were required prior to Alcoa-American Tobacco place major reliance on these dicta.  In any event, the cursory and
             conclusory nature of these writings clearly does not provide sufficiently strong proof of a prevailing opinion as to the law to have
             permitted the sort of justifiable reliance which alone could generate a prospectivity argument. "
 478 ,14    ," United makes the independent argument that Judge Wyzanski's decision in the Government's case so fundamentally altered
             the law of monopolization that it should not be held liable for damages prior to the date the decision was handed down, February
             18, 1953.  We reject this contention for the reasons set forth in the textual discussion of Alcoa-American Tobacco and the
             previous United cases. "
 479 ,15    ," United has also advanced the argument that because the earliest impact on Hanover of United's lease only policy occurred in
             1912, Hanover's cause of action arose during that year and is now barred by the applicable Pennsylvania statute of limitations.
             The Court of Appeals correctly rejected United's argument in its supplemental opinion.  We are not dealing with a violation
             which, if it occurs at all, must occur within some specific and limited time span.  Cf. Emich Motors Corp. v.  General Motors
             Corp., 229 F.2d 714 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1956), upon which United relies.  Rather, we are dealing with conduct which constituted a
             continuing violation of the Sherman Act and which inflicted continuing and accumulating harm on Hanover.  Although Hanover
             could have sued in 1912 for the injury then being inflicted, it was equally entitled to sue in 1955. "
 480 ,16    ," United also says that because Hanover's managers would have computed their capital costs differently, they would not in fact
             have decided to stop leasing machines and to begin purchasing them.  The District Court found, however, that Hanover, had it
             been given the opportunity, would have bought rather than leased the machines offered by United.  This finding, affirmed by the
             Court of Appeals, is supported by the evidence, and we do not disturb it. "
 483 ,1     ," I am not alone in this view.  See  Cole v. Hughes Tool Co., 215 F.2d 924, 932-933; Laitram Corp. v.  King Crab, Inc., 244
             F.Supp. 9, 18. See also n. 2, infra. "
 484 ,2     ," Neither, apparently, could Judge Wyzanski.  After the trial court in this action filed its opinion holding that the 1953 decree had
             condemned United's lease-only practice, United applied to Judge Wyzanski for a construction of his decree. While denying the
             application upon grounds of comity, Judge Wyzanski indicated a willingness to construe his decree if officially requested by the
             trial judge in the present case, Judge Sheridan.  During the course of the hearing before Judge Wyzanski, he made his own
             views clear to government counsel: ""Now that you are here, are you not aware from being here on previous occasions that the government never contended, and I
             never ruled, as Judge Sheridan supposes the matter was decided?"""
 484 ,3     ," 110 F.Supp., at 349-350. The language quoted by the Court, ante, at 486, n. 3, is not a statement of why the District Court in
             1953 ordered United to offer its machines for sale, but rather part of the court's answer to United's argument that it would be
             unfair to make United sell while its competitors continued only to lease.  110 F.Supp., at 350."
 484 ,4     ," ""When the applicable standard for determining monopolization under § 2 is applied to these facts, it must be concluded that the
             District Court and the Court of Appeals did not err in holding that United's practice of leasing and refusing to sell its major
             machines was determined to be illegal monopolization in the Government's case."" (Emphasis added.) "
 504 ,1     ," In its initial findings, handed down on  January 25, 1965, 239 F.Supp., at 76, the District Court concluded that Zenith had
             suffered actual damages of $ 16,238,872 as a result of the restraints imposed by the three pools upon Zenith's export business
             during the four-year damage period: Canada: Television $ 5,826,896 Radio"

 504 ,16    ," ,238,872 On April 5, 1965, the District Court entered partial judgment, awarding Zenith treble damages for patent misuse and treble
             damages with respect to Canada, but reserving jurisdiction for further hearings on damages in the English and Australian
             markets.  The further proceedings were held in October and November 1965, after which the District Court amended its findings
             on damages for England and Australia: England: Television $ 4,312,924 Radio "
 505 ,745   ," ,102 Australia: Television"
 505 ,223   ," ,508 Radio"
 505 ,24    ," ,952 Total"
 505 ,5     ," ,306,486 These revisions reflect the proof submitted at the further proceedings, showing that government embargoes in England and
             Australia, in effect until 1959 and 1960 respectively, precluded entry by Zenith into the English and Australian markets.  The
             District Court found, with respect to England, that because of the embargoes, Zenith's damages were zero for the first year of
             the damage period, 50% of the figure initially accepted by the court for the second year, 75% for the third, and 100% for the
             fourth.  With respect to Australia, the District Court adopted a similar 0-50-75-100% revision of the original figures used by the
             court in computing the damage findings of January 25, 1965."
 505 ,2     ," The record discloses that Zenith, HRI, and the courts below all considered the damage period to be the four years prior to the
             date on which Zenith filed its counterclaim. No argument was made that the counterclaim, in whole or in part, related back to an
             earlier pleading, thereby expanding the damage period to include years prior to 1959.  Cf.   Bull v. United States, 295 U.S. 247,
             262 and n. 10 (1935); Cold Metal Process Co. v.  E. W. Bliss Co., 285 F.2d 231 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1960), cert. denied,  366 U.S. 911
             (1961). Cf.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15 (c) (amended pleading relates back to date of original pleading if the ""claim or defense "
 506 ,      ," asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in
             the original pleading"")."
 506 ,3     ," During the proceedings before the District Court on April 2, 1965, the trial judge noted: ""Well, of course, Hazeltine Corporation
             wasn't a party to the lawsuit."" The court's reliance upon the stipulation as a basis for its decision to enter judgment against
             Hazeltine as well as HRI is reflected by the interchanges between the court and counsel for Hazeltine during those proceedings.
             An example is the following: ""Mr. Kayser [counsel for Hazeltine]: . . .  Could anyone really believe for a minute that if he had any thought of bringing the
             parent into this lawsuit that he would not have named them and that he would be relying on this stipulation which was intended
             to simplify and expedite the trial?  Would any lawyer who has been practicing for two years expect to hold somebody liable on a
             judgment when he didn't even name them?  He relied on some pretrial stipulation. ""The Court: You mean that pretrial stipulations are worthless?"" "
 507 ,4     ," There is some indication that the genesis of the stipulation was a pretrial conference, when a question was raised as to
             whether or not a subpoena served upon HRI could reach certain records of Hazeltine relating to the latter's foreign patents.
             Hazeltine, of course, argues that the stipulation's only purpose and effect were to facilitate discovery and trial by obviating the
             necessity of litigating whether or not Zenith could ""pierce the corporate veil"" between HRI and its parent."
 507 ,5     ," In its brief in this Court, Zenith seems to argue that Hazeltine is estopped to deny that it is bound by the stipulation.  Not only
             was HRI's counsel, Dodds, an officer of Hazeltine, but also Ruestow and Westermann, Hazeltine's general patent counsel and
             general counsel, were present during trial and failed to ""repudiate"" the construction allegedly given the stipulation by the parties
             at trial to the effect that it bound Hazeltine to any adjudication on the counterclaim. We find this theory untenable on the record of
             this case, for the references during trial to the stipulation are equally consistent with the interpretation advanced by Hazeltine
             that the stipulation merely eliminated the necessity for Zenith to perform the time-consuming task of piercing the corporate veil in
             proving its counterclaim against HRI.  Also, Ruestow and Westermann were called as witnesses during trial, and assuming they
             were present throughout the trial -- a fact which is neither proved nor disproved by the record -- their failure to repudiate Zenith's
             proposed construction of the stipulation is entirely consistent with the proposition that they were present only as witnesses, and
             not as authorized representatives for a person who might be bound by the litigation."
 507 ,6     ," Just as the alter ego issue was not litigated after Hazeltine had made its special appearance and while it had an opportunity to
             be heard, see supra, at 111, so the District Court evidently did not rely upon anything more than the stipulation as a basis for
             entering the injunction against Hazeltine as well as HRI.  The record does not support the contention, implicit in Zenith's brief,
             that when Hazeltine appeared to contest jurisdiction it was found by the District Court to be ""in active concert or participation"" "
 508 ,      ," with HRI and that, by entering its special appearance, Hazeltine consented to be bound by such a finding.  See generally Dobbs,
             The Validation of Void Judgments: The Bootstrap Principle (pts. 1 and 2),  53 Va. L. Rev. 1003, 1241 (1967)."
 508 ,7     ," Although HRI and Hazeltine were not parties to this prior litigation and did not enter the settlement agreement, HRI urged that
             all joint tortfeasors, including HRI and Hazeltine, were released from liability for injuries flowing from the pre-settlement acts of
             the pools. The 1957 release appears to be relevant only to Zenith's claim for injury to its Canadian trade; the embargoes in
             England and Australia were thought by the District Court to preclude any injury from acts of the English and Australian pools,
             and the embargoes were not lifted until well after the settlement was executed."
 508 ,8     ," The Court of Appeals did not disturb, nor do we, the findings of the District Court that HRI and Hazeltine conspired with the
             Canadian pool to deny patent licenses to companies seeking to export American-made goods to Canada.  Accepting these
             findings, we have no doubt that the Sherman Act was violated.  See, e. g., Timken Roller Bearing Co. v.  United States, 341 U.S.
             593, 599 (1951); Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 704 (1962). Once Zenith demonstrated
             that its exports from the United States had been restrained by pool activities, the treble-damage liability of the domestic company
             participating in the conspiracy was beyond question.  Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., supra. Cf.
             American Banana Co. v.  United Fruit Co., 213 U.S. 347 (1909);  United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 443
             (C. A. 2d Cir. 1945). Although patent rights are here involved, the same conclusions follow.  See, for example,  United States v.
             Line Material Co., 333 U.S. 287, 305-315 (1948);  United States v. Singer Mfg. Co., 374 U.S. 174, 196-197 (1963)."
 508 ,9     ," Zenith's burden of proving the fact of damage under § 4 of the Clayton Act is satisfied by its proof of some damage flowing from
             the unlawful conspiracy; inquiry beyond this minimum point goes only to the amount and not the fact of damage.  HN3[
             ] It is
             enough that the illegality is shown to be a material cause of the injury; a plaintiff need not exhaust all possible alternative
             sources of injury in fulfilling his burden of proving compensable injury under § 4.  Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide &
             Carbon Corp., supra, at 702 (1962); Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v.  International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 143-144 (1968)
             (concurring opinion). "
 509 ,10    ," Zenith's antitrust claim was asserted as a counterclaim in a patent infringement suit brought by RCA against Zenith and its
             subsidiary, the Rauland Corporation."
 509 ,11    ," The computation of damages, prepared by Zenith's experts and accepted by the District Court, see 239 F.Supp., at 76, reflects
             a comparison between Zenith's percentage share of the United States television market, ranging from 15.6% in 1959 to 21.7% in
             1963, and Zenith's actual share of the Canadian market during the same period, ranging from 3.1% in 1959 to 5.2% in 1961 and
             down to 3.2% in 1963.  Although we discuss only the measure of damages utilized for computing Zenith's injury in the Canadian
             television market, a comparable method was employed to determine Zenith's lost radio sales."
 509 ,12    ," On November 22, 1965, during the further proceedings held to consider damages for England and Australia, Zenith's
             executive vice-president and treasurer, Kaplan, testified: ""In Canada, our assumption was that we commenced the period starting June 1, 1959 as if we had a full blown organization, and
             had enjoyed the benefits of doing business there for years prior to that date."" "
 510 ,13    ," HRI's answer to Zenith's counterclaim did not plead a statute of limitations defense.  However, in the course of proceedings
             after entry of the District Court's initial findings of fact and conclusions of law, but before judgment, the trial court granted the oral
             motion of HRI's new counsel for ""leave to file"" defenses based on the statute of limitations and on the release given by Zenith
             pursuant to the 1957 settlement agreement.  The thrust of the former was primarily that the findings as to Canada had
             erroneously included damages resulting from conduct occurring prior to May 22, 1959.  The trial court, without further mention of
             these defenses, forthwith refused to set aside or amend the damage award as to Canada, thus either rejecting the statute of
             limitations defense or considering it to have been waived under Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 12 (h), as urged by Zenith in both the
             District Court and the Court of Appeals. Zenith itself had requested damages only for the four-year period prior to the filing of its counterclaim, and the findings of the
             District Court expressly limited the damages awarded to those occurring ""during the 4-year statutory damage period.""  239
             F.Supp., at 76. The Court of Appeals, although not purporting to pass on the statute of limitations defense, referred to the ""four
             year damage period"" and identified it as ""four years prior to the May 22, 1963, filing date of Zenith's counterclaim. 15 U. S. C.
             Sec. 15b.""  388 F.2d, at 35 and n. 4. The parties have not argued the matter here, and we make no further effort to penetrate the
             confusion surrounding this issue or to deal with the question of whether damage period injury from pre-damage period conduct is
             recoverable where an unwaived statute of limitations defense is properly asserted."
 510 ,14    ," On April 1, 1965, during the further proceedings held by the District Court before judgment, counsel for HRI stated: ""Now, what [counsel for Zenith] is really trying to sell this court is the idea that if he can show that these pools continued after
             1957 and, as he defines the pools, yes, yes, they did.  There is no question about it, that these arrangements in relation to
             patents -- that characterized necessarily as he characterizes them, but that these arrangements have continued and, so far as I
             know, are in existence today.  There is no question about that."" "
 511 ,      ," HRI does contend, however, that the ties between the Canadian pool and the Hazeltine companies were broken in December
             1965, when Hazeltine secured an early termination of its licensing agreement with CRPL.  See n. 25, infra."
 511 ,15    ," That Zenith failed to make a formal request for a CRPL license during the damage period can properly be attributed to Zenith's
             recognition that such a request would have been futile.  The pool had made its position entirely clear, and under these
             circumstances the absence of a formal request is not fatal to Zenith's case.  See Continental Ore Co. v.  Union Carbide &
             Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 699-702 (1962); Hanover Shoe, Inc. v.  United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 487, n. 5
             (1968)."
 511 ,16    ," In 1960, the Report of the Royal Commission on Patents, Copyright and Industrial Designs was published.  This Report
             described the magnitude of the risk taken by Zenith and its distributors in selling imported products in Canada: ""The portfolio in respect of which CRPL had the right to grant licences consisted of 5,000 patents, and in the absence of a
             licence from CRPL it is doubtful if anyone could sell in Canada a radio or television receiver. ""CRPL indicated that it does not grant a licence to any importer of radio or television receivers . . . .  It is particularly in respect of
             the policy of CRPL in precluding importers from bringing into Canada radio and television receivers that the complaint was made
             to this Commission. ""It was stated to be the policy of CRPL to enforce its patent rights against any person who sells in Canada an imported radio or
             television receiver which infringes any one or more of the patents in its portfolio . . . ."""
 511 ,17    ," This letter, brought to Zenith's attention by an ex-Zenith dealer, warned the Motorola dealer that his importation of American-
             made television sets and FM radios probably infringed pool patents. The dealer not only was cautioned that CRPL remained
             willing to litigate infringements, describing two recent and successful suits, but also was reminded of CRPL's policy against
             licensing imports: "
 512 ,      ," ""In closing, I wish to inform you that we would be most happy to issue a license to you to make or have made in Canada any
             equipment coming within the ambit of our patents."""
 512 ,18    ," HRI urges that the trial testimony as to Canada of each of two Zenith officers, Wright and Kaplan, was inconsistent with his
             own testimony on recall, inconsistent with the testimony of the other, and inconsistent with documentary evidence, and that we
             should therefore disregard their testimony.  It is true that the trial judge's views as to credibility are not completely impervious,
             but Rule 52 (a) admonishes due regard for the trial court's opportunity to assess the credibility of witnesses.  The Court of
             Appeals clearly took into account this evidence, and we see no adequate basis in the record for refusing to accept the testimony
             of the two Zenith officers as probative evidence.  See  United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co., 247 U.S. 32, 37-38 (1918);
             Walling v. General Industries Co., 330 U.S. 545, 550 (1947); Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v.  Linde Air Products Co., 339 U.S. 605,
             609-612 (1950);  United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 332 (1952);  Orvis v. Higgins, 180 F.2d 537, 539-
             540 (C. A. 2d Cir.), cert. denied,  340 U.S. 810 (1950);  Ruth v. Utah Construction & Mining Co., 344 F.2d 952 (C. A. 10th Cir.
             1965). HRI relies heavily in this respect on Zenith's annual reports for the years 1957-1962, but aside from the fact that these
             reports, except for 1962, were never admitted into evidence, we find them quite insufficient to undermine the credibility of Wright
             and Kaplan. "
 513 ,19    ," Wright testified that in mid-1955 a representative of the English pool had confirmed his understanding that ""the policy of the
             Pool . . . required that [radio and television] sets be made in England, and that nothing would be licensed if it was imported from
             abroad."" Wright further testified that the pool representative ""saw no possibility"" that this restrictive policy would be changed in
             the future.  Subsequently, during its dealings with its English radio distributor, Zenith was ""given to understand that television
             was just out of the question."""
 513 ,20    ," Because the embargo precluded any recovery by Zenith for the first year of the damage period, the trial court modified its
             initial measure of damages to reflect the time it would have taken Zenith, starting with the removal of the embargo, to build up its
             market share.  See n. 1, supra. "
 514 ,21    ," See American Banana Co. v.  United Fruit Co. 166 F. 261, 264 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1908), affirmed without specific reference to this
             issue,  213 U.S. 347 (1909);  Stearns v. Tinker & Rasor, 252 F.2d 589, 606 (C. A. 9th Cir. 1958); Volasco Products Co. v.  Lloyd

             Co. v.  American Sugar Rfg. Co., 166 F. 254, 260 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1908)."
 514 ,22    ," During trial, Wright and Kaplan testified that adjustments could be made by Zenith's English distributor in his shop to adapt
             Zenith television sets to the English transmission system.  However, the fair import of their testimony, both during trial and in
             November 1965 on recall, was that conversion of Zenith sets to the English system, whether done before shipment to England
             or in the distributor's shop, had in fact been carried out only occasionally in the past and was of questionable utility on a
             commercial basis.  Wright and Kaplan stated that Zenith could have manufactured a television set suitable for English use
             without appreciably more difficulty than Zenith faced in producing a new model for the American market, but the record does not
             indicate that Zenith took any steps in this direction before the end of the damage period, except in anticipation of the British
             changeover to the 625-line-per-second transmission system. "
 515 ,23    ," Paragraph C of the District Court's injunction prohibits HRI from ""Entering into, adhering to, enforcing or claiming any rights under any contract, agreement, understanding, plan or program, with
             any other person, company, patent pool, organization, association, corporation or entity which directly or indirectly restricts or
             prevents defendant-counterclaimant, Zenith Radio Corporation, or any of its subsidiaries, from exporting any electronic
             apparatus from the United States into any foreign market."""
 515 ,24    ," Section 16 provides: HN8[
             ] ""Any person, firm, corporation, or association shall be entitled to sue for and have injunctive relief, in any court of the
             United States having jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, . . .
             when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against threatened conduct that will cause loss or
             damage is granted by courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings . . . ."" (Emphasis added.) 15 U. S. C. § 26. "
 516 ,25    ," HRI informs us that Hazeltine, having obtained an early termination of its licensing agreement with CRPL, is now prepared to
             license any one or more of its Canadian patents ""with no restrictions on imports."" Since Hazeltine's abandonment of its
             participation in the Canadian pool occurred only after -- and, apparently, in response to -- the District Court's judgment and
             decree, we cannot agree with the suggestion that injunctive relief as to Canada has been rendered unnecessary and
             inappropriate.  See  United States v. Oregon State Medical Society, 343 U.S. 326, 333 (1952);  United States v. Concentrated
             Phosphate Export Assn., 393 U.S. 199, 202-203 (1968). Although HRI is free to attempt to demonstrate in the future that the
             need for injunctive relief with respect to Canada has been eliminated, or that a change of circumstances elsewhere justifies
             additional modifications of the injunction, see, e. g.,  United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633-636 (1953), we are not
             willing at this time to undertake a reappraisal of the injunction in light of post-trial developments."
 516 ,26    ," Having not disturbed the District Court's findings that HRI and Hazeltine were conspiring with English and Australian patent
             pools which refused to license imports, the Court of Appeals in any event should have sustained the injunction with respect to
             the English and Australian markets.  These findings, together with Zenith's demonstrated intent to expand its export business,
             were sufficient foundation for the conclusion that continued participation by HRI and Hazeltine in the English and Australian
             pools posed a significant threat of loss or damage to Zenith's business. "
 517 ,27    ," The District Court's injunction also included a paragraph barring HRI from continuing to coerce acceptance of its package
             license through the mechanism of offering a much lower royalty rate for those licensees who take a license on the entire
             package of patents rather than a license on merely a few of them.  Paragraph B enjoined HRI from ""Conditioning directly or indirectly the grant of any license to defendant-counterclaimant, Zenith Radio Corporation, or any of its
             subsidiaries, under any domestic patent upon the payment of the same or greater royalty rate than the rate at which licenses
             have been granted or offered to others under a group of domestic patents which includes said patent."" The Court of Appeals modified this paragraph in certain respects,  388 F.2d, at 39, but we do not disturb these modifications."
 517 ,28    ," The District Court concluded: ""Plaintiff's demands that royalties be paid on admittedly unpatented apparatus constitute misuse of its patent rights and plaintiff
             cannot justify such use of the monopolies of its patents, by arguing the necessities and convenience to it of such a policy.  While
             parties in an arms-length transaction are free to select any royalty base that may suit their mutual convenience, a patentee has
             no right to demand or force the payment of royalties on unpatented products.""  239 F.Supp., at 77. "
 519 ,29    ," The record and oral argument in Automatic Radio disclose no basis for the conclusion that Automatic Radio was forced into
             accepting the total-sales royalty rate by HRI's use of its patent leverage. "
 520 ,1     ," I find it unnecessary to consider the further question whether inclusion of such a provision should be held to violate the antitrust
             laws. "
 521 ,2     ," The Automatic Radio Court explicitly distinguished a number of cases of that kind, including  United States v. United States
             Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364 (1948), and Mercoid Corp. v.  Mid-Continent Investment Co., 320 U.S. 661 (1944). See  339 U.S., at

 521 ,3     ," Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U.S. 29 (1964), involved a different question: whether a royalty based solely upon use of the
             invention could be collected for use occurring after the patent's expiration."

 536 ,1     ," It is true that in its motion for leave to file its counterclaim, Zenith stated that the counterclaim arose out of conduct of HRI
             ""occurring since the filing of the answer"" in 1960.  On the basis of this statement, HRI argues that Zenith precluded itself from
             recovering damages resulting from pre-answer conduct.  This argument is not persuasive.  The counterclaim itself was not so
             limited, and Zenith made its position on damages absolutely clear by the opening of trial.  HRI was thereby given both ample
             notice of the substance of Zenith's claim and ample opportunity to respond, but made no effort during trial to do so. "
 537 ,2     ," Zenith similarly limited its claim for damages in the English and Australian markets to the years 1959-1963 and similarly sought
             to recover all damages suffered in those years without regard to the date of the conduct causing the damages.  HRI again did
             not plead or argue that Zenith was not entitled to its full damages during those years in the two markets, until it moved after trial
             to set aside the judge's findings and to reopen the proof so that it could show that Zenith's exclusion from the markets prior to
             1959 was a consequence of governmental restrictions and technical difficulties rather than of pool conduct."
 537 ,3     ," The District Court gave HRI five days to file its amendments to the pleadings ""nunc pro tunc as of"" the date of the argument on
             HRI's motion.  As a result, the defenses were technically filed prior to the entry of judgment and the taking of appeal, while the
             District Court still retained jurisdiction over the suit. "
 538 ,4     ," At the time HRI raised its defenses, the release on which it relied was not part of the record, although the record did contain a
             contract between the parties to the release in which they agreed to exchange releases, and frequent reference had been made
             during trial to the settlement of which the exchange of releases was a part.  The record also belied HRI's claim that the
             conspiracy had been dormant during 1959-1963, for it contained a letter written in 1962 from the pool to a distributor of Motorola
             products in Canada threatening infringement suits if he continued to distribute American-made products of Motorola. "
 539 ,5     ," On November 1, 1962, a consent decree was entered against the last defendant named in the Government action, which had
             been commenced on November 24, 1958, thereby terminating that action as to all parties.  See  Barnett v. Warner Bros.
             Pictures Dist. Corp., 112 F.Supp. 5, 7 (ND Ill. 1953). For purposes of the present suit against HRI, which was not a party to the
             Government action, the running of the statute of limitations was thus tolled until November 1, 1963 -- one year after the entry of
             the consent decree.  See 15 U. S. C. § 16 (b)."
 539 ,6     ," The Government suit was United States v. General Electric Co., Civil Action No. 140-157, which was brought in the Southern
             District of New York.  The complaint and the final judgment were introduced in evidence in the present proceedings as Plaintiff's
             Exhibits Nos. 44-47. "
 540 ,7     ," HRI does suggest that the 1955 amendment of § 16, see 69 Stat. 283, must be understood as an indication of Congress'
             approval of earlier cases in the lower federal courts confining the operation of § 16 (b) to parties defendant in Government suits.
             See text infra, this page and 337.  We are unpersuaded.  HRI can point to no direct evidence that Congress ever considered the
             issue now before us or voiced any views upon it; on the contrary, it appears that Congress left the matter for authoritative
             resolution in the courts.  The true thrust of HRI's argument is that we must find congressional approval of the earlier cases in
             Congress' silence when it re-enacted the statute.  We did not take such an approach, however, in Minnesota Mining & Mfg. Co.
             v.  New Jersey Wood Finishing Co., 381 U.S. 311 (1965), and  Leh v. General Petroleum Corp., 382 U.S. 54 (1965), and we do
             not do so here. "
 542 ,8     ," If the trial judge had passed upon the question, he well might have concluded that none of the damages sustained by Zenith in
             the Canadian market between 1959 and 1963 was a consequence of pre-1954 conspiratorial conduct.  The trial judge in effect
             found that, as to England and Australia, the effects of conspiratorial conduct were no longer felt by Zenith more than four years
             after the conduct had occurred, and there is no reason to infer that his findings would have been different in regard to Canada
             either in the present suit or in a suit brought in 1954.  But the trial judge made no such findings as to Canada, and we lack power
             to make them for him."
 542 ,9     ," Of course, these percentages are purely hypothetical.  They rest upon an assumption that, if Zenith had sued in 1954 for future
             damages in the Canadian market and had claimed that it would take 10 years for it to attain its full share of that market under
             free competitive conditions, then it would have proved that in 1955 it would have reached 10% of that share, in 1956, 20%, and
             so on.  In each year it would have recovered damages for that percentage of the share which it had not yet attained. "

             express provision in the release.  It enacts that ""[a] release by the injured person of one joint tortfeasor . . . does not discharge

 558 ,4     ," Though the Court of Appeals referred to state and federal court decisions that approved S&H's practice, our reading of its

             ] The Commission has described the factors it considers in determining whether a practice that is neither in violation of
             the antitrust laws nor deceptive is nonetheless unfair: ""(1) whether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been
             established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise -- whether, in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some
             common-law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or
             unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers (or competitors or other businessmen)."" Statement of Basis
             and Purpose of Trade Regulation Rule 408, Unfair or Deceptive Advertising and Labeling of Cigarettes in Relation to the Health
             Hazards of Smoking.  29 Fed. Reg. 8355 (1964). S&H argues that a later portion of this statement commits the FTC to the view that misconduct in respect of the third of these
             criteria is not subject to constraint as ""unfair"" absent a concomitant showing of misconduct according to the first or second of
             these criteria.  But all the FTC said in the statement referred to was that ""the wide variety of decisions interpreting the elusive
             concept of unfairness at least makes clear that a method of selling violates Section 5 if it is exploitive or inequitable and if, in
             addition to being morally objectionable, it is seriously detrimental to consumers or others."" Ibid. (emphasis added). "
 561 ,6     ," The Commission did explicitly decline to assess S&H's conduct in light of one leading antitrust case.  In United States v. Arnold,
             Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365, 379 (1967), this Court held that: ""Under the Sherman Act, it is unreasonable without more for a manufacturer to seek to restrict and confine areas or persons with
             whom an article may be traded after the manufacturer has parted with dominion over it.  White Motor [v. United States, 372 U.S.
             253 (1963)]; Dr. Miles [Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911)]. Such restraints are so obviously destructive of
             competition that their mere existence is enough.  If the manufacturer parts with dominion over his product or transfers risk of loss
             to another, he may not reserve control over its destiny or the conditions of its resale."" Arguably, S&H's practice is proscribed by this doctrine.  When the FTC declined to rely on this precedent, however, it did so not
             to turn to considerations other than those embedded in the antitrust laws, but instead to look for considerations less ""technical""
             and more deeply rooted in antitrust policy: ""We do not believe it appropriate to decide the broad competitive questions presented in this record on the narrow and technical
             basis of a restraint on alienation.  The circumstances here are much different from that where products are transferred to a
             dealer for resale.  They are complicated by the nature of the trading stamp scheme.  It is essential in this matter, we believe, and
             as we have heretofore indicated, to determine whether or not there has been or may be an impairment of competition.  Thus, we
             intend to look at the substance of the allegedly illegal practice rather than to decide the case by application of a technical
             formula."" 1 App. 175-176. "
 570 ,1     ," Topco, which is referred to at times in this opinion as the ""association,"" is actually composed of 23 chains of supermarket
             retailers and two retailer-owned cooperative wholesalers."
 570 ,2     ," In addition to purchasing various items for its members, Topco performs other related functions: e. g., it insures that there is
             adequate quality control on the products that it purchases; it assists members in developing specifications on certain types of
             products (e. g., equipment and supplies); and it also aids the members in purchasing goods through other sources. "
 571 ,3     ," The founding members of Topco were having difficulty competing with larger chains. This difficulty was attributable in some
             degree to the fact that the larger chains were capable of developing their own private-label programs. Private-label products differ from other brand-name products in that they are sold at a limited number of easily ascertainable
             stores.  A&P, for example, was a pioneer in developing a series of products that were sold under an A&P label and that were
             only available in A&P stores.  It is obvious that by using private-label products, a chain can achieve significant cost economies in
             purchasing, transportation, warehousing, promotion, and advertising.  These economies may afford the chain opportunities for
             offering private-label products at lower prices than other brand-name products.  This, in turn, provides many advantages of
             which some of the more important are: a store can offer national-brand products at the same price as other stores, while
             simultaneously offering a desirable, lower priced alternative; or, if the profit margin is sufficiently high on private-brand goods,
             national-brand products may be sold at reduced price.  Other advantages include: enabling a chain to bargain more favorably
             with national-brand manufacturers by creating a broader supply base of manufacturers, thereby decreasing dependence on a
             few, large national-brand manufacturers; enabling a chain to create a ""price-mix"" whereby prices on special items can be
             lowered to attract customers while profits are maintained on other items; and creation of general goodwill by offering lower
             priced, higher quality goods."
 571 ,4     ," The three largest chains are A&P, Safeway, and Kroger. "
 572 ,5     ," Topco was named in the complaint as the sole defendant, but the complaint clearly charged that its members, while not
             defendants, were coconspirators in Topco's violation of the Sherman Act. "
 573 ,6     ," Article IX, § 8, of the bylaws provides, in relevant part: ""Unless a member's membership and licensing agreement provides that such member may sell at wholesale, a member may not
             wholesale products supplied by the Association.  If a membership and licensing agreement permits a member to sell at
             wholesale, such member shall control the resale of products bearing trademarks of the Association so that such sales are
             confined to the territories granted to the member, and the method of selling shall conform in all respects with the Association's
             policies."" Shortly before trial, Topco amended this bylaw with an addition that permitted any member to wholesale in the exclusive
             territories in which it retailed.  But the restriction remained the same in all other cases. It is apparent that this bylaw on its face applies whether or not the products sold are trademarked by Topco.  Despite the fact
             that Topco's general manager testified at trial that, in practice, the restriction is confined to Topco-branded products, the District
             Court found that the bylaw is applied as written.  We find nothing clearly erroneous in this finding.  Assuming, arguendo,
             however, that the restriction is confined to products trademarked by Topco, the result in this case would not change."
 573 ,7     ," When the Government first raised this point in the District Court, Topco objected on the ground that it was at variance with the
             charge in the complaint.  The District Court apparently agreed with Topco that the complaint did not cover customer limitations,
             but permitted the Government to pursue this line on the basis that if the limitations were proved, the complaint could later be
             amended.  App. 141.  Topco acquiesced in this procedure, and both sides dealt with customer limitations in examining
             witnesses.  The District Court made specific findings and conclusions with respect to the totality of the restraints on wholesaling.
             In light of these facts, the additional fact that the complaint was never formally amended should not bar our consideration of the
             issue. "
 574 ,8     ," The District Court recognized that ""the government has introduced evidence indicating that some applications by Topco
             members to expand into territories assigned to other members have been denied,"" 319 F.Supp. 1031, 1042, but concluded that
             these decisions by Topco did not have an appreciable influence on the decision of members as to whether or not to expand.
             Topco expands on this conclusion in its brief by asserting that ""the evidence is uncontradicted that a member has never failed to
             build a new store because it was unable to obtain a license."" Brief for Appellee 18 n. 18.  The problem with the conclusion of the
             District Court and the assertion by Topco is that they are wholly inconsistent with the notion that territorial divisions are crucial to
             the existence of Topco, as urged by the association and found by the District Court.  From the filing of its answer to the
             argument before this Court, Topco has maintained that without a guarantee of an exclusive territory, prospective licensees would
             not join Topco and present licensees would leave the association.  It is difficult to understand how Topco can make this
             argument and simultaneously urge that territorial restrictions are an unimportant factor in the decision of a member on whether
             to expand its business. "
 575 ,9     ," It is true that in Sealy the Court dealt with price fixing as well as territorial restrictions.  To the extent that Sealy casts doubt on
             whether horizontal territorial limitations, unaccompanied by price fixing, are per se violations of the Sherman Act, we remove that
             doubt today."

             area of the law, it can, of course, make per se rules inapplicable in some or all cases, and leave courts free to ramble through

             the small chains acting independently and which by definition depends upon local exclusivity, permits the merchandiser to offer
             the public ""lower consumer prices on products of high quality"" and ""to bargain more favorably with national brand
             manufacturers""; such merchandising fosters ""the establishment of a broader supply base of manufacturers, thereby decreasing
             dependence upon a relatively few, large national brand manufacturers""; it also enables ""smaller manufacturers, the most
             common source of private label products, who are generally unable to develop national brand name recognition for their

 581 ,11    ," The national chains market their own private-label products, and these products are available nowhere else than in the stores
             of those chains. The stores of any one chain, of course, do not engage in price competition with each other with respect to their
             chain's private-label brands, and no serious suggestion could be made that the Sherman Act requires otherwise.  I fail to see
             any difference whatsoever in the economic effect of the Topco arrangement for the marketing of Topco-brand products and the
             methods used by the national chains in marketing their private-label brands. True, the Topco arrangement involves a
             ""combination,"" while each of the national chains is a single integrated corporation.  The controlling consideration, however,
             should be that in neither case is the policy of the Sherman Act offended, for the practices in both cases work to the benefit, and
             not to the detriment, of the consuming public. "

             under the contract; the assignability of the player's contract; and the ability of the club annually to renew the contract unilaterally,
             subject to a stated salary minimum.  Thus A. Rule 3 of the Major League Rules provides in part: ""(a) UNIFORM CONTRACT.  To preserve morale and to produce the similarity of conditions necessary to keen competition, the

 615 ,23    ," Thus, the 1906 amendment, see n. 20, supra, was intended to render ineffective certain evasive pleading tactics that had
             theretofore been employed to take advantage of the fact that under the Evarts Act an interlocutory appeal could be taken where
             only a nonconstitutional issue was at stake but not where a constitutional issue was involved.  See H. R. Rep. No. 542, 59th
             Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1906); 40 Cong. Rec. 1723 (remarks of Rep. Brantley); id., at 4856 (remarks of Sen. Bacon). "
 616 ,      ," The legislative history concerning the 1911 amendment, see n. 20, supra, indicates that the ""notwithstanding"" language was
             designed to ""remove any doubt"" that the limitation -- initially struck by the 1906 amendment -- on interlocutory appeals to those
             cases in which an appeal might be taken to the court of appeals after a final decree had been eliminated.  But this merely
             suggests an intent finally to resolve with even more specific language the problem of evasive pleading which had motivated the
             1906 amendment.  See S. Rep. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, p. 53 (1910).  Thus, in response to inquiry whether this
             amendment constituted ""a change in the existing law,"" Senator Heyburn, a sponsor of the legislation, said on the Senate floor,
             ""This is the existing law."" 45 Cong. Rec. 4001. As to the 1925 version of the interlocutory appeals provision, see n. 20, supra, the analysis prepared by the committee of this
             Court which drafted it explained that the ""notwithstanding"" language was ""eliminated as having no further application in view of
             the repeal of"" the provisions that had necessitated the initial 1906 amendment.  Hearing on S. 2060 and S. 2061 before a
             Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 12 (1924).  And if the addition of the
             ""notwithstanding"" language in 1911 did not establish court of appeals jurisdiction over interlocutory orders in Expediting Act
             cases, we fail to see how dropping that language in 1925 did so.  At the same time, elsewhere in the Judges' Bill, § 2 of the
             Expediting Act was carried forward without alteration.  See Act of Feb. 13, 1925, amending § 238 (1), 43 Stat. 938.  In doing so,
             it was stated: ""A direct review by the Supreme Court of an interlocutory or final judgment or decree of a district court may be had
             where it is so provided in the following Acts or parts of Acts, and not otherwise: (1) Section 2 of the Act of February 11, 1903, 'to
             expedite the hearing and determination' of certain suits brought by the United States under the antitrust . . . laws . . . ."" Ibid.
             (emphasis added).  Section 2, of course, has never contained a provision allowing appeal of interlocutory orders.  Moreover, Mr.
             Justice Van Devanter, a member of this Court's committee that prepared the bill, testified before the Senate Committee that the
             character of Expediting Act cases ""suggest[s] that they should go directly to the Supreme Court rather than through the circuit
             courts of appeals"" without any indication that an exception was being introduced for interlocutory appeals to the courts of
             appeals.  Hearing on S. 2060 and S. 2061 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 68th Cong., 1st

 616 ,24    ," Certainly the Court spoke fully cognizant of at least the amendment contained in the Judges' Bill of just four years before, see
             n. 20, supra, since all seven sitting Justices had been on the Court when its committee submitted the bill to Congress. "
 617 ,25    ," In Alkali Export Assn., the Court went on to say: ""[Extraordinary] writs may not be used as a substitute for an authorized appeal; and where, as here, the statutory scheme [the
             Expediting Act] permits appellate review of interlocutory orders only on appeal from the final judgment, review by certiorari or
             other extraordinary writ is not permissible in the face of the plain indication of the legislative purpose to avoid piecemeal
             reviews."" 325 U.S., at 203 (emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Court found that exigent circumstances associated with the District Court's denial of the defendant's motion to
             dismiss the action justified immediate review by common-law certiorari in the particular case.  Id., at 203-204. The Court in De Beers, stating that ""what is . . . said [in Alkali Export Assn.] applies in this instance,"" 325 U.S., at 217, granted
             review under the All Writs Act of a preliminary injunction, although normally review would have been to the court of appeals
             under what is now 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (a)(1). Of course, nothing we say today signifies a retreat from our previous statements

             may in fact lie from an injunctive order in a Government civil antitrust case; (2) that if an appeal from such an order cannot be
             taken under § 1292 (a), it may nevertheless be taken under § 1292 (b) since, the argument goes, the latter applies to all orders

             Brief for Petitioner 7-8.  Our discussion in Part I of this opinion is sufficient to dispose of petitioner's first contention.  As to the
             second argument, while the language of § 1292 (b) is unqualified on its face, the legislative history indicates that Congress was
             concerned only with orders of types other than those specified in § 1292 (a); in other words, § 1292 (b) was intended to
             supplement § 1292 (a), not to provide a substitute for it.  See n. 35, supra.  Moreover, it would be, to say the least, extraordinary
             for Congress to have resorted to such a subtle method of establishing for the first time in Government civil antitrust cases
             interlocutory appeals for orders of the type specified in § 1292 (a) without giving any hint whatsoever that this was its purpose."

 620 ,43    ," Nor can it be ignored that subsequent to both the 1948 revision which resulted in § 1292 (a) and the enactment of § 1292 (b),
             we have reaffirmed that a final judgment is an essential prerequisite to an appeal of an order issued in a government civil
             antitrust case since ""Congress . . . limited the right of review in such cases to an appeal from a decree which disposed of all
             matters, and it precluded the possibility of an appeal either to this Court or to a Court of Appeals from an interlocutory decree.""
             Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S., at 305 n. 9. Section 1292 was not, to be sure, specifically at issue in Brown Shoe.
             But in holding, as it did, that the District Court's decree was appealable only because it was ""final,"" id., at 306-309, the Court
             necessarily foreclosed the possibility of an interlocutory appeal to any court, and thus its remark concerning the preclusion of
             interlocutory appeals cannot be lightly dismissed. "
 621 ,44    ,The sole exception to this would be if the certified question had previously been considered by way of certiorari.
 621 ,45    ," Only if we were to dispose of a controlling question in such a way as to end all proceedings would the possibility of a
             subsequent appeal be foreclosed.  A threshold issue of jurisdiction might present such a controlling question; but even that type
             of issue will often not end an entire Government civil antitrust case which might involve a number of parties -- as is true in this
             case where the certified question relates to only one of the two defendants."

             (quasi in rem jurisdiction). "
 622 ,47    ," Other than threshold procedural issues, the question consistently sought to be raised on interlocutory appeal has been the
             propriety of orders granting or denying preliminary injunctions with respect to proposed acquisitions. See United States v. Cities
             Service Co., 410 F.2d 662 (CA1 1969); United States v. FMC Corp., 321 F.2d 534 (CA9 1963); United States v. Ingersoll-Rand
             Co., 320 F.2d 509 (CA3 1963). Although appeals of such orders would involve the merits of the antitrust actions, the fact is that
             permitting interlocutory appeal under § 1292 (b) would not bring these orders and the related evidence before the courts of
             appeals since they come within § 1292 (a)(1).  Cf. n. 41, supra.  Moreover, because of the need for speed if an acquisition is to
             be enjoined before accomplished, requests for such interlocutory orders must be determined after, at most, only an initial
             hearing and without full development of the record.  Consequently, appeals from such orders would not necessarily bring before
             the courts of appeals the lengthy records and numerous documents with which we have often been forced to deal after final
             judgment."
 622 ,48    ," See S. Rep. No. 2434, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2 (1958)."
 622 ,49    ," Of course, this problem would not exist if the interlocutory decision were reviewed immediately on certiorari in this Court; but,
             as we have already seen, this alternative entails serious problems of its own."
 622 ,50    ," In this respect, it must be recalled that interlocutory appeal under § 1292 (b) is subject to the decision of the court of appeals in
             the exercise of its discretion, to allow appeal of the question certified by the district court.  Thus, the effectiveness of § 1292 (b)
             in Government civil antitrust cases would be dependent upon the willingness of the courts of appeals to assume this new burden
             aware of the limited import of their decisions and of the fact that interlocutory appeals in such cases would represent only added
             work for them, since they would not otherwise consider any appeal. "
 623 ,1     ," It is true that several Justices over the years have expressed the desire that the antitrust cases come to us only by certiorari to
             the courts of appeals.  So far as I am aware the only opinion speaking for the Court containing that suggestion is United States

             before the district courts.  Many cases which are filed in the Federal district courts require the district judge to entertain motions
             at an early stage in the proceedings which, if determined, against the plaintiff, result in a final order which would then be
             appealable to the circuit courts of appeals of the United States.  However, such motions, if determined in the plaintiff's favor, are

 627 ,7     ," United States v. Ingersoll-Rand Co., 320 F.2d 509 (CA3 1963). The reasoning of the Third Circuit in this case was as follows:
             Section 1292 (a)(1) permits an appeal to a court of appeals of interlocutory injunctive orders ""except where a direct review may
             be had in the Supreme Court."" Since the Supreme Court has direct review in Expediting Act cases only from final judgments, it
             has none from interlocutory orders.  Hence, the exception in § 1292 (a)(1) does not bar court of appeals jurisdiction over
             interlocutory injunctive orders in Government antitrust cases.  The court then concluded: ""In fact, it is extremely difficult and requires doing violence to the language of the statute to escape the conclusion that
             interlocutory orders, such as the one at bar, are reviewable by a court of appeals excepting and only excepting those types of
             cases in which an interlocutory order is directly reviewable by the Supreme Court."" 320 F.2d, at 517. "
 634 ,1     ," Specifically at issue in the present litigation is U.S. Patent No.   2,900,304, issued August 18, 1959.  The patent embodies two
             types of claims -- (1) a method of curing humans or animals of external fungus diseases by administering ""an effective amount of
             griseofulvin"" to them internally and (2) a capsule, tablet, or pill containing an effective amount of griseofulvin."
 634 ,2     ," Specifically at issue in the present litigation is U.S. Patent No.   3,330,727, issued July 11, 1967.  This patent covers the

             than other dosage forms of the drug. "
 635 ,3     ," Although AMHO, Schering, and J & J could have manufactured bulk-form griseofulvin under Glaxo's patents, in practice they
             purchased the bulk form of the drug from ICI and Glaxo and themselves performed the processes to convert the drug to dosage
             form."
 635 ,4     ," See, supra, n. 1.  The Government contended that the ""method"" portion of the patent did not disclose how to practice the
             invention in that it failed to specify what is an ""effective amount"" of the drug.  See 35 U. S. C. § 112. The Government also
             argued that ICI's product claims were invalid because the dosage form that they covered did not specify an ""effective amount"" of
             the drug, did not specify the diseases that could be cured, and claimed a patent monopoly over a substance long in the public
             domain.  See 35 U. S. C. §§ 100 and 101."
 635 ,5     ," The case was decided on the basis of various motions concerning the merits and the relief.  Testimony was not received; the
             facts were developed in affidavits, exhibits, and interrogatories accompanying the motions."
 635 ,6     ," See n. 2.  The Government had sought to challenge the patent on the basis that the patent purported to monopolize a product
             long in the public domain, on the basis of prior disclosure, and on the basis of prior public use.  See 35 U. S. C. §§ 100, 101, 102

 637 ,7     ," The Government argued in the District Court: ""We submit that [ United States v.] Gypsum [333 U.S. 364 (1948)] should be understood more broadly to support challenge to
             any patent used by antitrust defendants in furtherance of their illegal program.  The importance of the Imperial patent to the
             defendants' scheme to violate the antitrust laws is plain.  It was, according to ICI's contentions, the reason for the patent pool
             agreement in the first place; Glaxo's grant of rights to ICI was paid for with the Imperial patent. Without the Imperial patent the
             defendants could not maintain their monopoly in the United States over the drug, for then anyone who could secure bulk form
             griseofulvin could make it up into pills and sell them without a patent to stop him; bulk form griseofulvin is, as ICI points out,
             unpatented.  The Imperial patent thus bolsters the effectiveness of the illegal restraint on alienation ICI imposes on the resale of
             bulk form griseofulvin: if a small drug company somehow manages to get the unpatented bulk form drug despite ICI's restraint
             on alienation designed to prevent it or anyone else from doing so, the defendants may still suppress the manufacture of the drug
             by threat of patent infringement suit.  In this context, vindication of the public interest in competition in unpatentable goods is
             doubly important -- for there is a double impediment to commerce -- the patent and the conspiracy."" The Government, throughout its brief in this Court, emphasizes the importance of the patents to the antitrust violation. ""In cases like this, the patents involved generally are of major importance in furthering the allegedly unlawful patent licensing
             practices; they give the defendants the power which enables them to impose the restraints of trade.  That is the situation here.
             The patents were essential to the appellees' scheme to violate the antitrust laws."" "

             because the acquiring firm was the most likely entrant. It is suggested that the District Court failed to consider whether Falstaff was an on-the-fringe potential competitor with influence
             on existing competition because the Government never alleged in its complaint that Falstaff was exerting a present
             procompetitive influence, never proceeded under this theory, and further failed to introduce any evidence to support this view.
             But this position merely ascribes an arbitrary meaning to the language of the complaint.  The Government in its complaint
             alleged that the acquisition violated § 7 because it eliminated potential competition; since potential competition may stimulate a
             present procompetitive influence, the allegation certainly encompassed the ""on-the-fringe influence"" that the District Court failed
             to consider, and the Government was not required to be more specific in its allegation. The Government did not produce direct evidence of how members of the New England market reacted to potential competition
             from Falstaff, but circumstantial evidence is the lifeblood of antitrust law, see Zenith Radio Corp. v.  Hazeltine Research, Inc.,
             395 U.S. 100 (1969); Interstate Circuit, Inc. v.  United States, 306 U.S. 208, 221 (1939); Frey & Son, Inc. v.  Cudahy Packing
             Co., 256 U.S. 208, 210 (1921), especially for § 7 which is concerned ""with probabilities, not certainties,"" Brown Shoe Co. v.
             United States, 370 U.S., at 323. As was stated in  United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., 378 U.S. 158, 174 (1964), ""potential
             competition cannot be put to a subjective test.  It is not 'susceptible of a ready and precise answer.'"" Nor was there any lack of circumstantial evidence of Falstaff's on-the-fringe competitive impact.  As the record shows, Falstaff
             was in the relevant line of commerce, was admittedly interested in entering the Northeast, and had, among other ways, see n. 8,
             supra, made its interest known by prior-acquisition discussions.  Moreover, there were, as my Brother MARSHALL would put it,
             objective economic facts as to Falstaff's capability to enter the New England market; and the same facts which he would have
             the District Court look to in determining whether the particular theory of potential competition we do not reach has been violated,
             would be probative of violation of § 7 through loss of a procompetitive on-the-fringe influence.  See  FTC v. Procter & Gamble
             Co., supra, at 580-581;  United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., supra, at 173-177;  United States v. El Paso Natural Gas Co.,
             376 U.S. 651, 660 (1964). And as for the contention that the Government did not proceed under this on-the-fringe influence view, the record is to the
             contrary.  At one point in the trial, the Government informed the trial judge that a deposition was being introduced into evidence
             ""to establish that Falstaff was a company that was on the wings or at the edge of the New England market. . . .  What I mean by
             that is that Falstaff was capable and interested in entering the New England market and would be waiting for the opportunity to
             develop, but that Falstaff, over the long term, would eventually or could eventually or was a likely entrant into the New England
             market, to use the terminology in FTC v. Procter & Gamble Company."" App. 124.  Further into its presentation of proof, the
             Government was introducing evidence of the trend toward concentration in the market, and stated: ""It is this concentration, your
             Honor, which, as we attempted to point out in our pretrial brief, makes potential competition. . . .  The concentration of sales
             within a small number of firms in New England.  This is what makes the potential competition . . . so very, very important to this
             market. . . .  In such a situation the potential entry of a fresh competitive factor is of extreme importance."" App. 170. That the on-the-fringe influence theory was one of the theories the Government was proceeding under was apparent to Falstaff.
             In its opening statement, Falstaff stated: ""Now, the Government has a theory which is, so far as the judicial determinations on the point are concerned, comparatively
             new.  You were handed the other day a portion of the record in FTC against Bendix-Fram Corporation, and you were handed at
             the same time a typed or otherwise reproduced copy of the opinion of Commissioner Elman of the FTC in that case. ""That opinion is not yet officially reported.  The case is on its way to an appeal . . . .  The Commissioner announced a theory
             upon which the Government relies and which they say lies within the ambit of this vague, undefined creature, potential
             competition.  What that decision, on appeal as I say, what that decision announces is the doctrine which is called the toe-hold
             doctrine, and it goes like this: ""If a producer of Product A is standing in the wings, as the Commissioner says, outside the market, merely standing there, but in
             a position to move into the market if he chooses.  He must remain there in the wings and forbear acquiring the producer of a like
             product within the market area. "
 651 ,      ," ""The Commissioner fancies that the mere presence of such a manufacturer or seller close to the market area had some effect
             which could fall within his ill-defined concept of potential competition.  And he found in Bendix-Fram that Bendix was in such a
             position.  He found that Bendix could have acquired a small company rather than Fram, a relatively larger one, beefed it up by
             expenditures of money which Bendix could afford, and develop it into a full-blown competitor within the market area.  I do not
             know whether that notion will gain substantial acceptance in the theory of antitrust law.  I do not know that it will have the
             approval of the Supreme Court if and when it ever reaches it.  I do know, however, that that is an entirely different situation [than]
             we have here. . . . . . ""If there is any sense to this total theory at all it must be that the acquiring company was in fact so closely located to the market
             served by the acquired company that its entrance into the market unilaterally, under its own steam, without motivation was a
             distinct threat to those who were competing in the market."" App. 182-183.  (Emphasis added.) Falstaff then proceeded to state why it felt that the on-the-fringe influence theory did not apply in this case. During its proof, Falstaff had both its expert witness on economics, App. 257, and an officer of Narragansett, App. 376, testify as
             to whether Falstaff's presence had a procompetitive effect, both stating that it did not."
 651 ,14    ," It is suggested that certain language in the Court's opinion in  United States v. Continental Can Co., 378 U.S. 441, 464 (1964),
             is to the contrary.  But there the merger was held proved prima facie anticompetitive because the acquiring and acquired
             companies were engaged in the same overall line of commerce in the same geographic market.  This notwithstanding, it is again
             only arbitrary to assume that the quoted language was not referring to the acquired company's on-the-fringe influence as a
             potential competitor for certain end uses for containers. "

             system was a prerequisite to entry.  The District Judge concluded that ""the credible evidence establishes that [Falstaff] was not a
             potential entrant into said market by any means or way other than by said acquisition.""  332 F.Supp. 970, 972. "

             beer between Falstaff and Narragansett will be eliminated."" (Emphasis added.) While it is true, as the majority asserts, that
             ""potential competition may stimulate a present procompetitive influence,"" see ante, at 534 n. 13, the complaint nowhere alleges
             that such a procompetitive influence occurred in this case."
 655 ,2     ," Significantly, the majority cites no evidence at all from the record indicating that firms within the New England market were
             deterred from anticompetitive practices by Falstaff's presence at the market fringe. Indeed, my Brethren concede that ""the
             Government did not produce direct evidence of how members of the New England market reacted to potential competition from
             Falstaff,"" ibid.  While the majority contends that there was ""circumstantial evidence"" relevant to determining whether there was a
             loss of procompetitive influence, the evidence it points to suggests only that Falstaff might have been perceived as a potential
             entrant -- not that this perception produced a present procompetitive effect.  In fact, the little evidence on the question which
             does appear in the record strongly suggests that Falstaff was exerting no procompetitive influence.  Thus, an economist
             testifying for the defense stated that, in his expert judgment, Falstaff's presence on the fringe of the market ""had no effect"" on the
             practices of firms within the market (App. 257).  Similarly, the director of marketing for Narragansett testified that those within the
             market did not view Falstaff as a threat and that it never occurred to them that Falstaff would attempt a de novo entry (App. 376). To be sure, this testimony may well have been biased and might properly have been discounted by the trier of fact. But it is
             harder to dismiss the documentary evidence showing continued vigorous competition after Falstaff's entry by acquisition. If
             Falstaff was exerting a substantial procompetitive influence by threatening entry, it would seem to follow that anticompetitive
             practices should have emerged when this threat was removed.  The majority nowhere accounts for the continuing absence of
             such practices."
 655 ,3     ," In its brief before this Court, the Government characterizes its cause of action as follows: ""The theory of the suit was that potential competition in the New England beer market may be substantially lessened by the

             Courts should not forget that such cases, the trials of which usually result in long and complex factual records, come here
             without the benefit of any sifting by the Courts of Appeals.  The absence of an opinion by the District Court has been a handicap

 657 ,6     ," This pressure continued during the post-acquisition period.  From 1964 to 1969, Narragansett's share of the market slipped
             from 21.5% to 15.5%, while Anheuser-Busch and Schlitz, two large national firms, increased their combined share from 16.5% to
             35.8%. "
 658 ,7     ," At trial, Falstaff argued that it was unlikely to make a de novo entry into the New England market since it had learned through
             experience that a strong, pre-existing organization of distributors was essential to success.  It is true that Falstaff sold most of its
             beer through independent distributors.  However, it should be noted that between 20% and 25% of its sales were made through
             company branches which Falstaff had established itself.  As might be expected, Falstaff's profit margin was significantly higher in
             areas where it used its own distribution facilities.  Moreover, Falstaff's assertion is belied by its own prior history.  As noted
             above, for years Falstaff had successfully expanded by purchasing failing breweries with weak distribution facilities and turning
             them into effective competitors."
 658 ,8     ," At trial, Falstaff also argued that the other Little recommendations which Falstaff did follow led to disastrous consequences, that
             Little's estimate of construction costs were unrealistic, and that the Little Report was premised on Falstaff's penetration of the
             mid-Atlantic as well as the New England market. "
 659 ,9     ," Dr. Horowitz' estimates were based on the assumption that Falstaff's profit margin would be $ 1.16 per barrel, which was the
             margin currently enjoyed by the company.  However, Anheuser-Busch and Pabst, two of the larger national breweries, both
             earned more than $ 2.50 per barrel in their modern plants."

             acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired and the corporation
             making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any line of
             commerce."" 38 Stat. 731. "
 660 ,12    ," The legislative history of the 1950 amendment was traced in detail in our opinion in Brown Shoe Co. v.  United States, 370
             U.S. 294 (1962). ""The deletion of the 'acquiring-acquired' test was the direct result of an amendment offered by the Federal
             Trade Commission.  In presenting the proposed change, Commission Counsel Kelley made the following points: this Court's
             decisions had implied that the effect on competition between the parties to the merger was not the only test of the illegality of a
             stock merger; the Court had applied Sherman Act tests to Clayton Act cases and thus judged the effect of a merger on the
             industry as a whole; this incorporation of Sherman Act tests, with the accompanying 'rule of reason,' was inadequate for
             reaching some mergers which the Commission felt were not in the public interest; and the new amendment proposed a middle
             ground between what appeared to be an overly restrictive test insofar as mergers between competitors were concerned, and
             what appeared to the Commission to be an overly lenient test insofar as all other mergers were concerned.  Congressman
             Kefauver supported this amendment and the Commission's proposal was then incorporated into the bill which was eventually
             adopted by the Congress.  See Hearings [before Subcommittee No. 2 of the House Committee on the Judiciary] on H. R. 515,
             [80th Cong., 1st Sess.] at 23, 117-119, 238-240, 259; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee on H.
             R. 2734, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. . . . 147.""  370 U.S., at 317 n. 30."
 660 ,13    ," To be sure, in terms of anticompetitive effects, the dominant firm's acquisition of another firm within the market might be
             functionally indistinguishable from a de novo entry, which § 7 does not forbid.  But ""surely one premise of an antimerger statute
             such as § 7 is that corporate growth by internal expansion is socially preferable to growth by acquisition.""  United States v.
             Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321, 370 (1963). Moreover, entry by acquisition has the added evil of eliminating one firm
             in the market and thus increasing the burden on the remaining firms which must compete with the dominant entering firm. "
 661 ,14    ," Thus, whereas the practical difference between entry by acquisition and entry de novo may be marginal in the case of a
             dominant entrant, see n. 13, supra, it is crucial in the case of a perceived potential entrant. If the perceived potential entrant
             enters de novo, its deterrent effect on anticompetitive practices remains and the total number of firms competing for market
             shares increases.  But when such a firm enters by acquisition, it merely steps into the shoes of the acquired firm.  The result is
             no net increase in the actual competition for market shares and the removal of a threat exerting procompetitive influence from
             outside the market."
 661 ,15    ," Still, even if the market is presently competitive, it is possible that it might grow less competitive in the future.  For example, a
             market might be so concentrated that even though it is presently competitive, there is a serious risk that parallel pricing policies
             might emerge sometime in the near future.  In such a situation, an effective competitor lingering on the fringe of the market --
             what might be called a potential perceived potential entrant -- could exert a deterrent force when anticompetitive conduct is
             about to emerge.  As its very name suggests, however, such a firm would be still a further step removed from the exertion of
             actual, present competitive influence, and the problems of proof are compounded accordingly -- particularly in light of the
             showing of reasonable probability required under § 7."
 661 ,16    ," However, if the acquired firm is strengthened to such an extent that it upsets the market balance and drives its competitors out
             of the market, the acquiring firm takes on the characteristics of a dominant entrant, and the merger may therefore violate § 7
             under that theory.  See supra, at 558-560 and n. 14. "
 662 ,17    ," Thus, in  United States v. Penn-Olin Chemical Co., 378 U.S. 158 (1964), for example, management testified that the company
             had no intention of making a de novo, nonacquisitive entry,  id., at 166, and in part on the basis of this testimony, the District "
 663 ,      ," Court found that such an entry was unlikely,  id., at 173. But we rejected this finding as irrelevant to the company's status as a
             perceived potential entrant since ""the corporation . . . might have remained at the edge of the market, continually threatening to
             enter,"" ibid., and so affected competition within the market."
 663 ,18    ," Public statements by management that the firm does not intend to enter the market may be relevant.  To the extent that such
             statements are believed by the firms within the market, they affect their perception of the firm outside the market as a potential
             entrant. But in that event, the statements of intent are admissible, not to show subjective state of mind, but, rather, as one of the
             objective factors controlling the perception of the firms within the market. "
 664 ,19    ," It might be argued that economic decisions are ""inherently subjective"" and that any attempt to derive objective conclusions
             from economic data is futile.  If this observation means that different people reach different conclusions from the same objective
             data, then the point must, of course, be conceded.  Similarly, if the point is that economic predictions are difficult and fraught with
             uncertainty, it is well taken.  As we recognized in United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, such questions are ""not . . .
             susceptible of a ready and precise answer in most cases.""  374 U.S., at 362. But although the factual controversies in § 7 cases
             may prove difficult to resolve, the statutory scheme clearly demands their resolution.  As this Court held years ago, in response
             to a similar argument: ""So far as the arguments proceed upon the conception that in view of the generality of the statute it is not
             susceptible of being enforced by the courts because it cannot be carried out without a judicial exertion of legislative power, they
             are clearly unsound.  The statute certainly generically enumerates the character of acts which it prohibits and the wrong which it
             was intended to prevent.  The propositions therefore but insist that . . . it never can be left to the judiciary to decide whether in a
             given case particular acts come within a generic statutory provision.  But to reduce the propositions, however, to this their final
             meaning makes it clear that in substance they deny the existence of essential legislative authority and challenge the right of the
             judiciary to perform duties which that department of the government has exerted from the beginning."" Standard Oil Co. v.  United
             States, 221 U.S. 1, 69-70 (1911). Section 7 by its terms requires the trial judge to make a prediction, and it is entirely possible
             that others may reasonably disagree with the conclusion he reaches.  But a holding that the fact of such disagreement requires
             the judge to delegate his decisionmaking authority to one of the parties would strike at the heart of the very notion of judicial
             conflict resolution.  While it may be true that different people see economic facts in different light, § 7 gives federal judges and
             juries the responsibility to reach their conclusions as to the economic facts.  And ""if justice requires the fact to be ascertained,
             the difficulty of doing so is no ground for refusing to try."" O. Holmes, The Common Law 48."
 664 ,20    ," The Government directs our attention to a case which dramatically illustrates the unreliable character of such evidence.  When
             the Government challenged Bethlehem Steel's acquisition of Youngstown Steel in a § 7 proceeding, Bethlehem vigorously
             argued that it would never enter the Midwestern steel market de novo.  But when the merger was disallowed, see  United States
             v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., 168 F.Supp. 576 (SDNY 1958), Bethlehem nonetheless elected to make a de novo entry.  See
             Moody's Industrial Manual 2861 (1966)."
 664 ,21    ," It is possible to imagine a small, closely held corporation which is not solely concerned with profit maximization and which
             through excessive conservatism or inertia would not seize upon an opportunity to expand its profits.  But such a corporation is
             exceedingly unlikely to become the defendant in a § 7 lawsuit.  Section 7 suits of this type are triggered when a firm tries to
             expand its market by entering hitherto foreign territory by acquisition. A firm caught in the act of expanding by acquisition can
             hardly be heard to say that it is uninterested in expansion. It is also possible that a firm might make a good-faith error as to the nature of objective market forces.  Thus, even though the
             objective factors favor entry de novo, the firm's managers might think that the same factors are unfavorable.  But as the objective
             evidence favoring entry becomes stronger, the possibility of good-faith error correspondingly decreases, so that if the objective
             forces favoring entry are clear, the chance of good-faith error becomes de minimis.  Moreover, the mere fact that a firm is
             presently making a good-faith error does not demonstrate that it will continue to do so in the future.  See supra, this page. "
 665 ,22    ," The distinction between subjective statements of intent and objectively verifiable facts is not unknown in other areas of the
             law.  See, e. g.,  Wright v. Council of City of Emporia, 407 U.S. 451, 460-462 (1972);  NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U.S.
             221, 227-228 (1963). Indeed, perhaps the oldest rule of evidence -- that a man is presumed to intend the natural and probable
             consequences of his acts -- is based on the common law's preference for objectively measurable data over subjective
             statements of opinion and intent.  Nor have we hesitated to apply this principle to antitrust law.  See, e. g., Utah Pie Co. v.
             Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 702-703 (1967);  United States v. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394 (1948). "

             his town at a price lower than that which it charged for bread delivered from its in-state plant to customers in an adjoining State.
             The Tenth Circuit held that Mead's activities were essentially local, and that if § 2 (a) applied to them it would exceed Congress'
             commerce power.  The Court (DOUGLAS, J.) unanimously reversed, stating that Congress clearly has power to reach the local
             activities of a firm that finances its predatory practices through multistate operations.  This language, however, spoke to the
             commerce power rather than to jurisdiction under § 2 (a).  In fact, Mead's did have interstate sales and its price discrimination

             issues and certain issues on the merits, and hence, under Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), no objection to reserving the
             jurisdictional issues until a hearing on the merits.  By the same token, however, there is no objection to use, in appropriate

 686 ,5     ," Indeed, we would have to sit as a Committee of Revision over Congress, shaping the law to fit our prejudices against antitrust
             regulations, to hold that ""in commerce"" as used in the Clayton Act was intended to provide less comprehensive coverage than
             the language of the Sherman Act. Prior to passage of the Clayton Act, labor union practices had been held by this Court to affect
             commerce and thus to fall within the reach of the Sherman Act, despite the fact that the union activities could not be regarded as
             being in the flow of commerce. Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U.S. 274, 300-301 (1908). See also Teamsters Local 167 v. United States,
             291 U.S. 293, 297 (1934); Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469 (1940); United States v. Employing Plasterers Assn., 347
             U.S. 186, 189 (1954). If the Court is right today in saying that ""in commerce"" as used in the Clayton Act is to be read more
             restrictively than the Sherman Act, then those who drafted the Clayton Act (including Louis D. Brandeis) to protect labor were
             needlessly concerned -- no express exemption of labor would have been necessary, since the ""in commerce"" language of the
             Clayton Act (if narrowly read) would not have supported judicial attempts to reach labor activities on an ""affecting commerce""
             theory.  The drafters obviously thought otherwise."
 686 ,6     ," The decision of the Court of Appeals on the Sherman Act issue, which remains intact by virtue of our limited grant of certiorari,
             held that petitioners and their alleged activities were sufficiently ""in commerce"" to support Sherman Act jurisdiction.  487 F.2d
             202, 205 (1973). The majority now holds, however, that petitioners and their alleged activities were not sufficiently ""in
             commerce"" to support Clayton and Robinson-Patman Act coverage.  In light of the latter holding, it is difficult to imagine the
             reception that Copp's Sherman Act claims will receive on remand. "
 687 ,7     ," Of course, in a limited range of Sherman Act cases, this Court has held that certain practices are per se violations of the
             antitrust laws; that is to say, these practices are conclusively presumed to be illegal without the need for any particularized
             inquiry into their effects.  See generally White Motor Co. v. United States, 372 U.S. 253, 259-262 (1963), and cases collected
             therein.  These cases may be viewed as limited exceptions to the individualized approach described in the text above. "

             J. Moore, Federal Practice para. 56.03, p. 2051 (2d ed. 1974).  Lack of jurisdiction of the court is a matter in abatement and thus
             is not usually appropriate for a summary judgment, which is not a substitute for a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction.  Id.,
             at 2052-2053. On the general propriety of discovery orders of this sort, see 4 id., para. 26.56 [6]; but ""[there] are cases . . . in which the
             jurisdictional questions are so intertwined with the merits that the court might prefer to reserve judgment on the jurisdiction until
             after discovery has been completed."" Id., at 26-191.  See also the discussion in n. 10, infra."
 688 ,9     ," The issue of whether there is subject-matter jurisdiction raises the question whether the complaint, on its face, asserts a
             nonfrivolous claim ""arising under"" federal law.  Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 199-200 (1962); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682-
             683 (1946). If such a claim is stated, the District Court is then empowered to assume jurisdiction and to determine whether the
             claim is good or bad, on the basis of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or cause of action.  Romero v. International
             Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S. 354, 359 (1959); Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. Northwestern Public Service Co., 341 U.S.
             246, 249 (1951). Such a dismissal is on the merits, not for want of jurisdiction.  Bell v. Hood, supra."
 688 ,10    ," It is sometimes said that where the district court's jurisdiction is challenged, that court has the power, either on its own motion
             or on motion of a party, to inquire into the facts as they exist for purposes of resolving the jurisdictional issue. Land v. Dollar, 330
             U.S. 731, 735 n. 4 (1947), and cases cited; Local 336, American Federation of Musicians v. Bonatz, 475 F.2d 433, 437 (CA3
             1973). On the other hand, if the jurisdictional issue is closely intertwined with or dependent on the merits of the case, the
             preferred procedure is to proceed to a determination of the case on the merits.  McBeath v. Inter-American Citizens for Decency
             Comm., 374 F.2d 359, 362-363 (CA5), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 896 (1967); Jaconski v. Avisun Corp., 359 F.2d 931, 935-936 (CA3
             1966). The cases cited for the proposition that a district court may inquire into jurisdictional facts on a motion to dismiss for want of
             jurisdiction are cases in which the jurisdictional issue was whether the plaintiff met the amount-in-controversy requirement.  That
             jurisdictional issue is sufficiently independent of the merits of the claim to warrant independent examination, if challenged.
             Where the jurisdictional issue is more closely linked to the merits, disposition of the jurisdictional issue on motion becomes
             inappropriate.  Thus in Land v. Dollar, where the complaint alleged that members of the United States Maritime Commission
             were unlawfully holding shares of Dollar stock under a claim that the stock belonged to the United States, the District Court
             dismissed on the ground that the suit was against the United States.  In affirming a reversal of that dismissal, the Court said:
             ""[Although] as a general rule the District Court would have authority to consider questions of jurisdiction on the basis of affidavits
             as well as the pleadings, this is the type of case where the question of jurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits."" 330
             U.S., at 735. This was true because if the plaintiffs prevailed on either of their theories on the merits (that the Commission was
             without authority to acquire the shares, or that the contract was simply a pledge of the shares rather than an outright transfer), "
 689 ,      ," then they would also prevail on the jurisdictional issue. And in the McBeath case, supra, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
             reversed a pretrial dismissal of a Sherman Act claim on grounds of lack of jurisdiction (for failure to show an effect on interstate
             commerce).  Relying on Land v. Dollar, it held that the issue of effects on interstate commerce was so intertwined with the merits
             of the claim that it was error for the District Court to dismiss without giving the plaintiff a full chance to prove his case on the
             merits. In cases such as United States v. Employing Plasterers Assn., 347 U.S. 186 (1954); Mandeville Island Farms v. American
             Crystal Sugar Co., 334 U.S. 219 (1948); and United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U.S. 218 (1947), this Court has reviewed
             ""interstate commerce"" issues in the context of dismissals of antitrust suits prior to trial on the merits.  Those dismissals, however,
             were based, not upon motions for summary judgment or for dismissal for want of jurisdiction, but rather upon motions to dismiss
             for failure to state a claim.  In such cases, of course, the allegations of the complaint must be taken as true.  Id., at 224. In the
             case now before us, the District Court clearly went beyond the face of the complaint and required respondents to produce proof
             of interstate effects. "

 700 ,1     ," The primary effect of the agreement seems to have been to inhibit the union from offering any other employer a more favorable
             contract. When asked at trial whether another subcontractor could get an agreement on any different terms, Local 100's
             business agent answered: ""No. The agreement says that no one will be given a more favorable agreement. I couldn't, if I desired, as an agent, sign an
             agreement other than the ones in existence between the local contractors and the Local 100. .  .  .  .  . ""Q. I see. So that's - in other words, once you sign that contract with the Mechanical Contractors' Association, that sets the only

 701 ,2     ," There was no evidence that Local 100's organizing campaign was connected with any agreement with members of the

             have been a prehire contract under § 8 (f), and it is not clear that the contractor argued that it was invalid for lack of a collective-
             bargaining relationship. The General Counsel's memorandum in Hagler Construction is plainly addressed to a different argument

 705 ,16    ," The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART argues that § 303 provides the exclusive remedy for violations of § 8(e),

             in the legislative materials."" Post, at 650.  In our view, these materials are unpersuasive. In the first place, Congress did not
             amend § 303 expressly to provide a remedy for violations of § 8(e). See Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of
             1959, §§ 704(d), (e), 73 Stat. 544-545. The House in 1959 did reject proposals by Representatives Hiestand, Alger, and
             Hoffman to repeal labor's antitrust immunity. Post, at 650-654. Those proposals, however, were much broader than the issue in
             this case. The Hiestand-Alger proposal would have repealed antitrust immunity for any action in concert by two or more labor
             organizations. The Hoffman proposal apparently intended to repeal labor's antitrust immunity entirely. That the Congress
             rejected these extravagant proposals hardly furnishes proof that it intended to extend labor's antitrust immunity to include
             agreements with nonlabor parties, or that it thought antitrust liability under the existing statutes would be inconsistent with the
             NLRA. The bill introduced by Senator McClellan two years later provides even less support for that proposition. Like most bills
             introduced in Congress, it never reached a vote."

             Garmon, 359 U.S. 236 (1959). But in cases like this one, where there is an independent federal remedy that is consistent with
             the NLRA, the parties may have a choice of federal remedies. Cf.  Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 176-188 (1967); Smith v.

             associate in unions and to induce other persons to accept or reject employment. Article 5154, however, referring to the
             preceding articles, provides: ""Nothing herein shall be construed to repeal, affect or diminish the force and effect of any statute
             now existing on the subject of trusts, conspiracies against trade, pools and monopolies."" The Texas antitrust statutes prohibit,

 706 ,19    ," In addition to seeking a declaratory judgment that the agreement with Local 100 violated the antitrust laws, Connell sought a
             permanent injunction against further picketing to coerce execution of the contract in litigation. Connell obtained a temporary
             restraining order against the picketing on January 21, 1971, and thereafter executed the contract - under protest - with Local 100
             on March 28, 1971. So far as the record in this case reveals, there has been no further picketing at Connell's construction sites.
             Accordingly, there is no occasion for us to consider whether the Norris-LaGuardia Act forbids such an injunction where the
             specific agreement sought by the union is illegal, or to determine whether, within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, there
             was a ""labor dispute"" between these parties. If the Norris-LaGuardia Act were applicable to this picketing, injunctive relief would
             not be available under the antitrust laws. See United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219 (1941). If the agreement in question is
             held on remand to be invalid under federal antitrust laws, we cannot anticipate that Local 100 will resume picketing to obtain or
             enforce an illegal agreement. "

             at 620. At that point it was apparent that the primary reason for the lawsuit was Connell's request for an injunction to stop the
             union's picketing. "
 711 ,8     ," If, contrary to the Court's conclusion, see ante, at 626-633, Congress intended what it said in the proviso to § 8(e), then the
             subcontracting agreement is valid and, under the view of the Board and those Courts of Appeals that have considered the
             question, Local 100's picketing to obtain the agreement would also be lawful. See, e.g., Orange Belt District Council of Painters
             v. NLRB, 117 U.S. App. D.C. 233, 236, 328 F. 2d 534, 537; Construction Laborers v. NLRB, 323 F. 2d 422 (CA9); Northeastern

             Connell would therefore have neither a remedy under § 303 nor one with the Board. It would seem necessarily to follow that conduct specifically authorized by Congress in the National Labor Relations Act could
             not by itself be the basis for federal antitrust liability, unless the Court intends to return to the era when the judiciary frustrated
             congressional design by determining for itself ""what public policy in regard to the industrial struggle demands."" Duplex Printing
             Press Co. v. Deering, 254 U.S. 443, 485 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  See United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U.S. 219. In my view,
             however, even if Local 100's conduct was unlawful, Connell may not seek to invoke the sanctions of the antitrust laws.
             Accordingly, I find it unnecessary to decide in this case whether the subcontracting agreement entered into by Connell and Local
             100 is within the ambit of the construction-industry proviso to § 8(e), and if it is, whether it was permissible for Local 100 to utilize
             peaceful picketing to induce Connell to sign the agreement."
 711 ,9     ," If Connell and Local 100 had entered into a purely voluntary ""hot cargo"" agreement in violation of § 8(e), an injured nonunion
             mechanical subcontractor would have no § 303 remedy because the union would not have engaged in any § 8(b)(4) unfair labor
             practice. The subcontractor, however, would still be able to seek the full range of Board remedies available for a § 8(e) unfair
             labor practice. Moreover, if Connell had truly agreed to limit its subcontracting without any coercion whatsoever on the part of
             Local 100, the affected subcontractor might well have a valid antitrust claim on the ground that Local 100 and Connell were
             engaged in the type of conspiracy aimed at third parties with which this Court dealt in Allen Bradley Co. v. Electrical Workers,
             325 U.S. 797. At the very least, an antitrust suit by an injured subcontractor under circumstances in which Congress had failed
             to provide any form of private remedy for damage resulting from an illegal ""hot cargo"" agreement would present a very different
             question from the one before us - a question which it is not now necessary to answer.  Cf.  Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381
             U.S. 676, 708 n. 9 (opinion of Goldberg, J.). On the other hand, the signatory of a purely voluntary agreement that violates § 8(e) is fully protected from any damage that
             might result from the illegal ""hot cargo"" agreement by his ability simply to ignore the contract provision that violates § 8(e). If the
             union should attempt to enforce the illicit ""hot cargo"" clause through any form of coercion, the employer may then bring a § 303
             damages suit or may file an unfair labor practice charge with the Board. See 29 U.S.C. § 158(b)(4)(B). Since § 8(e) provides that
             any prohibited agreement is ""unenforcible and void,"" any union effort to invoke legal processes to compel the neutral employer
             to comply with his purely voluntary agreement would obviously be unavailing. "

 732 ,17    ," The Secretary to the Federal Reserve Board described the investigation and the 1968 ""understanding"" in a 1972 letter to the
             Justice Department: ""The fact finding inquiry undertaken by Board staff into the relationship between Citizens & Southern and the other banking
             institutions referred to was begun in 1966 and continued into 1968. The principal focus of the inquiry concerned essentially two
             questions: (1) whether Citizens & Southern had unlawfully acquired a direct or indirect stock ownership in these banking
             institutions in excess of 5 per cent without first having secured the requisite prior Board approval; and (2) whether the banking
             institutions had unlawfully become subsidiaries of Citizens & Southern by virtue of the election of directors without first having
             received the requisite prior Board approval. The inquiry arose in 1966 out of information contained in Citizens & Southern's
             registration statement filed with the Board and in 1968 as a result of information supplied by the Comptroller of the Currency in
             connection with the merger of the Citizens and Southern National Bank and the Citizens and Southern Bank of Augusta. The
             inquiry referred to was not initiated as a result of any application filed with the Board for approval of an acquisition, merger, or
             consolidation transaction under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act. .  .  .  . ""The Board of Governors did not issue any order approving the relationships between Citizens & Southern and the other banking
             institutions under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act. .  .  .  . ""There was no determination made that approval of the Board under section 3 of the Bank Holding Company Act was required
             for Citizens & Southern to retain an ownership interest of 5 per cent or less in the banking institutions referred to or to maintain
             the relationships with those banks in circumstances where Citizens & Southern did not elect a majority of the directors of any
             such bank. There was an understanding reached between members of the Board's staff and representatives of Citizens &
             Southern that in those cases where Citizens & Southern purchased 5 per cent or less of the stock of a bank, in some instances
             furnishing a principal operating officer for such bank, as well as other employee benefits, Citizens & Southern would not be
             deemed to have control of a majority of the directors of such bank on these facts alone. Further, where the foregoing
             circumstances existed and where control of additional shares was purchased by the bank's executive officer, control of such
             shares purchased would not be attributed to Citizens & Southern so long as Citizens & Southern did not finance the purchase of
             such shares, directly or indirectly. Finally, it was understood that even though Citizens & Southern was responsible, directly or
             indirectly, in placing one or two directors on the boards of such banks, if that number did not constitute a majority of directors of
             such bank, the Board's staff would not consider that Citizens & Southern could reasonably be held to have control of a majority
             of the directors of such bank."" "

             Court considered this development and concluded that it would not lead to true competition among the defendant banks. The
             court explicitly found that the changes ordered would not affect the bonds of inter-bank consultation and cooperation which are
             at the heart of the correspondent associate program.  372 F. Supp., at 638, 643, and n. 8. "
 741 ,1     ," These computations consider the 5-percent defendant banks as completely separate entities (rather than as constituting a part
             of the C&S system as actually is the case), and of course, do not relate to competition as such but rather to the assignment of
             statistical proportions to the various entities involved."
 741 ,2     ," See n. 1, supra. "
 744 ,1     ," Relationships labeled ""correspondent banking"" may call for careful scrutiny as the sale of specialized services by the
             corresponding bank shades into ""consultation"" by the correspondent on every business decision of significance. Correspondent
             banking, like other intra-industry interaction among firms or their top management, provides an opportunity both for the kind of
             education and sharing of expertise that ultimately enhances consumer welfare and for ""understandings"" that inhibit, if not
             foreclose, the rivalry that antitrust laws seek to promote. As one commentator on commercial banking practices has observed: ""[C]ommunication, especially when it comes from those at the top of a power hierarchy, tends to facilitate conflict resolution.
             Perhaps a great deal should not be made of this, but competition is a form of conflict and, in the present context, conflict
             resolution is a form of restraint on competition."" Phillips, Competition, Confusion, and Commercial Banking, 19 J. of Finance 32,
             42 (1964). Since the relationship of C&S to the 5-percent banks goes well beyond ordinary ""correspondent banking,"" this case does not
             present an occasion for further examination of the lawfulness of these more limited interconnections among firms."
 744 ,2     ," The Consumer Credit Operating Bulletin, 7 App. E-1024 (DX-311), is illustrative. It explains what bank records should be
             established, the methods for arranging a repayment plan, and the procedures to be followed in perfecting a security interest. In
             addition, the manual sets forth C&S practice with respect to charges for late payments, extensions of repayment deadlines, and
             the notification of a borrower's employer about repayment delinquency. "

             further supported by the scope and outcome of the 1968 investigation of C&S undertaken by the Federal Reserve Board staff.
             The investigation was convened specifically to inquire into a possible violation of § 3. The staff was principally concerned with
             the pattern of ownership of the stock of the 5-percent banks, especially by C&S officers and employees. Ultimately the staff
             found this acceptable, so long as C&S did not finance the purchases. There is no indication, however, that the staff concerned
             itself with communications between C&S and the 5-percent banks with respect to such matters as interest rates, loan repayment
             policies, or other terms of business."
 748 ,13    ," There is little doubt that pent-up consumer demand for additional banks would sooner or later induce efforts to organize new
             ones. More questionable, however, is whether regulatory authorities would respond promptly to permit new entry. In general,
             regulatory policy has been thought to retard formation of new banking institutions. See Peltzman, Entry in Commercial Banking,
             8 J. Law & Econ. 11 (1965). "
 749 ,14    ," The record demonstrates that such a chain of events is possible. Citizens & Southern Bank of Stone Mountain, organized in
             1957 with C&S assistance, functioned as a correspondent associate from 1959 until 1970. At that time it declined an offer of
             acquisition by C&S and became independent of the C&S system. Appellees have argued that Stone Mountain represents a
             unique case because a majority of voting stock remained in the hands of a single family not intimately tied to the C&S system.
             This contention is not wholly supported by the record, since in his trial testimony Mr. Mills Lane, President of C&S from 1946 to
             1970, referred to three other banks having a similar structure of ownership. (2 App. 378-379, referring to Pelham, Fayetteville,
             Hogansville). The example of Stone Mountain does, in any event, demonstrate that sponsorship can occur under conditions
             ultimately leading to independence of the sponsored institution. "
 750 ,15    ," The District Court made no finding as to the relevant geographic market, accepting the Government's contentions arguendo in
             deciding the case. The Court apparently does the same. A report prepared by the Government's expert witness concluded that
             while the Atlanta Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area was too large to be considered an integral geographic market, the
             constituent counties of DeKalb and Fulton were ""reasonable geographic areas within which it is appropriate to analyze the
             competitive effects of the proposed mergers."" 4 App. E-83. This is an approximation, of course, since the same report revealed
             that a number of DeKalb residents use Fulton County banks, thus suggesting that in certain respects DeKalb and Fulton County
             banks compete for the same business. Accordingly, it appears that defining the geographic market to include both DeKalb and
             Fulton Counties would be justified under our cases. See United States v. Phillipsburg National Bank & Trust Co., 399 U.S. 350
             (1970); United States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U.S. 321 (1963)."
 750 ,16    ," Three of the 5-percent banks - Sandy Springs, Chamblee, and Tucker -- had deposits exceeding $15 million as of January 1,
             1970. North Fulton, Park National, and South DeKalb were smaller and more recently organized, but all have experienced "
 751 ,      ," vigorous growth. The average annual rate of deposit growth for the two years preceding January 1, 1970, was 102% for North
             Fulton and 50% for Park National, in contrast to a national average rate for all commercial bank deposits during the same period
             of slightly more than 10%. South DeKalb, organized in late 1969, had more than doubled its deposits from $ 1.5 to $ 3 million
             during the first half of 1970. 5 App. E-422, E-546."
 751 ,17    ," See n. 16, supra."
 751 ,18    ," Officers of both C&S and the 5-percent banks testified that they had not contemplated a severance of relations, but this
             testimony does not establish what would happen if the acquisitions were enjoined. Had the managements testified that they
             would not consider severance under any circumstances, such declarations of an intention to eschew a course dictated by
             economic self-interest would have to be viewed with skepticism. See United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 410 U.S. 526, 568-
             570 (1973) (MARSHALL, J., concurring in result). Whether the 5-percent banks would have been formed at all had their principals expected the Clayton Act to bar ultimate
             acquisition by C&S is a different question. I am not troubled by it for essentially the same reasons that have led me to conclude
             above that enjoining continuation of correspondent associate relationships would not deter sponsorship of de facto branches
             under state-law restrictions on de jure branching. See supra, at 143-144. "
 752 ,19    ," The record indicates that at the time C&S applied for regulatory approval of the acquisitions, its two largest competitors, First

             the Act precludes its application to programs sponsored by the states.  Sections 1 and 2 prohibit unlawful conduct by 'persons,'
             and the word 'person,' as defined in Section 7, in some connections at least, may include a state.  Georgia v. Evans, 316 U.S.

             and price of a commodity shipped in interstate commerce or otherwise restrain interstate competition through a mandatory
             regulation."""
 763 ,21    ," ""But it is plain that the prorate program here was never intended to operate by force of individual agreement or combination.  It
             derived its authority and its efficacy from the legislative command of the state and was not intended to operate or become
             effective without that command.  We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its
             purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature.  In a dual system of government
             in which, under the Constitution, the states are sovereign, save only as Congress may constitutionally subtract from their
             authority, an unexpressed purpose to nullify a state's control over its officers and agents is not lightly to be attributed to
             Congress. ""The Sherman Act makes no mention of the state as such, and gives no hint that it was intended to restrain state action or

             fact that state action was involved.  Each time his language was carefully chosen to apply only to official action, as opposed to
             private action approved, supported, or even directed by the State.  Thus, his references were to (1) ""the legislative command of
             the state,"" and (2) ""a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature,"" 317 U.S., at 350; and to (3) ""a

             and individual action (even when commanded by the State), on the other hand. "

             to follow a parallel price policy.  He said: ""Therefore, when a state compels retailers to follow a parallel price policy, it demands

             regulated by the States.  Congress was not so sure: ""Parker v. Brown dealt with a State commission authorized by State statute to enforce a program in conformity with, if not

             agricultural prices are a prime candidate for some collective scheme that interrupts free competition in order to bring badly
             needed stability; under the State's close supervision, as was the case in Parker, the scheme seems entirely reasonable.  I see
             no reason to disapprove the holding of Parker, therefore, and to the extent that the plurality, by stressing the identity of the state
             defendants in that case, intimates that a different result might have been reached had the raisin growers themselves been sued,
             I cannot agree. Neither can I agree with the dissent, however, that Parker must be taken to stand for the broad proposition that a State can
             immunize any conduct from the application of the Sherman Act. It is true, as the dissent points out, that there are statements
             arguably to that effect in Parker, but the opinion is hardly unambiguous on the point.  The Court also observed in that case that
             ""a state does not give immunity to those who violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it, or by declaring that their
             action is lawful."" 317 U.S., at 351. Moreover, if we must choose between Parker's more categorical statements and the
             seemingly contrary statements in Schwegmann and Northern Securities, see nn. 1 and 2, supra, I prefer the latter, as more in
             keeping with the actual holdings of those cases."
 774 ,6     ," MR. JUSTICE STEVENS states that there may be cases in which ""the State's participation in a decision [to adopt the
             challenged restraint] is so dominant that it is unfair to hold a private party responsible for his conduct in implementing it."" Ante, at
             594-595.  I agree that a defense based on fairness may be available.  I would not, however, rule it out in this case, as the
             Court'sopinion does.  The parties, like the court below, so far have addressed themselves only to the question whether
             petitioner's suit is completely barred by Parker v. Brown and the Michigan Public Service Commission's approval of the
             challenged tie-in.  I would confine our present decision to that question alone, leaving consideration of a fairness defense to the
             lower courts on remand, and making only these two further observations: First, I take it that a defense based on fairness would be a defense to a damages recovery but not injunctive relief.  The latter, of
             course, presents no danger of unfairness.  Moreover, as MR. JUSTICE STEVENS implies by his emphasis on not unfairly
             holding a private party ""responsible,"" the defense rests on the theory, not that the challenged restraint is legal, but that since the
             defendant has committed no voluntary act in implementing it, he cannot be said to have violated any law.  The same would not
             be true of acts following a judgment that the restraint is in fact illegal, and the state law to that extent invalid. Second, I would hope that consideration will be given on remand to allowing a defense against damages wherever the conduct
             on which such damages would be based was required by state law. Such a rule would comport with the theory that a defendant
             should not be held ""responsible"" in damages for conduct as to which he had no choice, by which I do not mean to rule out other
             possible grounds for such a rule.  See Posner, The Proper Relationship Between State Regulation and the Federal Antitrust
             Laws, 49 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 693, 728-732 (1974). It would also eliminate what seems to me the extremely unfair possibility that
             during a particular period -- and it could be a regulatory lag during which the regulatee was attempting to change the state
             mandate -- the regulatee could be required by state law to conform to a course of conduct for which he was all the while
             accumulating treble-damages liability under federal law. "

 775 ,3     ," The progenitor of that doctrine in this Court was Olsen v. Smith, 195 U.S. 332, a decision relied on by Parker to support the
             proposition that when a State, acting as sovereign, imposes a restraint on commerce, that restraint does not violate the Sherman
             Act. Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S., at 352. Olsen involved a challenge to the validity of a Texas law fixing the charges of pilots
             operating in the port of Galveston and prohibiting all but duly commissioned pilots from engaging in the pilotage business.  The
             Court rejected the argument that the Texas pilotage statutes were ""repugnant… to the laws of Congress forbidding combinations
             in restraint of trade or commerce,"" 195 U.S., at 339: ""The contention that because the commissioned pilots have a monopoly of the business, and by combination among themselves
             exclude all others from rendering pilotage services, is also but a denial of the authority of the State to regulate, since if the State
             has the power to regulate, and in so doing to appoint and commission, those who are to perform pilotage services, it must follow
             that no monopoly or combination in a legal sense can arise from the fact that the duly authorized agents of the State are alone
             allowed to perform the duties devolving upon them by law.  When the propositions just referred to are considered in their
             ultimate aspect they amount simply to the contention, not that the Texas laws are void for want of power, but that they are
             unwise.  If an analysis of those laws justified such conclusion -- which we do not at all imply is the case -- the remedy is in
             Congress, in whom the ultimate authority on the subject is vested, and cannot be judicially afforded by denying the power of the
             State to exercise its authority over a subject concerning which it has plenary power until Congress has seen fit to act in the
             premises."" Id., at 344-345."
 775 ,4     ," If Parker v. Brown, supra, could be circumvented by the simple expedient of suing the private party against whom the State's
             ""anticompetitive"" command runs, then that holding would become an empty formalism, standing for little more than the
             proposition that Porter Brown sued the wrong parties. MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN in a separate opinion today states that he sees ""no reason to disapprove the holding of Parker"" ante,
             at 613 n. 5, but then proceeds to do precisely that.  The holding in Parker was that ""[t]he state in adopting and enforcing the "
 776 ,      ," prorate program… imposed [a] restraint as an act of government which the Sherman Act did not undertake to prohibit."" 317 U.S.,
             at 352. MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN's position is that the Sherman Act does prohibit all state-imposed restraints which do not
             satisfy the Sherman Act's ""rule of reason"" -- a view quite different from the holding in Parker.  The fact that the result in Parker
             could have been reached by a different route -- by a holding, for instance, that the prorate restraint was ""reasonable"" within the
             meaning of the Sherman Act or was impliedly exempted by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 -- is simply
             irrelevant. I am puzzled by MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN's willingness to emasculate Parker, which the Court indicated to have continued
             vitality just this Term.  See Virginia Pharmacy Bd.  v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 770. It seems to me that such a
             step is inconsistent not only with the legislative history of the Sherman Act but also with well-settled principles of stare decisis
             applicable to this Court's construction of federal statutes.  See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671 n. 14. If those principles
             preclude the reconsideration of an antitrust exemption which is in every sense an ""aberration"" and an ""anomaly,"" Flood v. Kuhn,
             407 U.S. 258, 282, then a fortiori they preclude the re-examination of an exemption that coincides with a clear expression of
             congressional intent."
 776 ,5     ," A different approach is, of course, called for in interpreting this Court's summary dispositions of appeals.  See generally Hicks
             v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 345 n. 14; Port Authority Bondholders Protective Comm.  v. Port of New York Authority, 387
             F.2d 259, 262 (CA2)."
 776 ,6     ," California's argument began with a statement of the principle that the Federal Government and the States -- ""sister
             sovereignties,"" Supplemental Brief for Appellants 35 in Parker v. Brown, O.T. 1942, No. 46 -- are each ""supreme"" when
             legislating ""within their respective spheres."" ""The subject of Federal power is still 'commerce,' -- not all commerce, but commerce
             with foreign nations and among the several states."" Id., at 35-37.  Incorporating by explicit reference its preceding argument with
             respect to whether the Federal Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 pre-empted the California statute, id., at 38, and proceeding
             from the premise that the subject matter of the California law was intrastate commerce within the jurisdiction of the State,
             California contended that ""it should never be held that Congress intends to supersede or suspend the exercise of the police
             powers of the States unless its purpose to effect that result is clearly manifested."" Ibid.  California added that ""[s]uch an intent
             should be even more clear and express when it serves not only to suspend the police powers, but to subject the sovereignty of
             the State to the inhibition and penalties of Congressional action."" Id., at 38-39. The plurality's position today seems to be that because the State of California placed particular emphasis on the fact that the
             proscriptions of the Sherman Act, if applicable, would run directly against the State, California's argument in the first part of its "
 777 ,      ," brief was simply and solely that ""Congress never intended to subject a sovereign State to the provisions of the Sherman Act….""
             Ante, at 588.  Yet, as the preceding quotations show, California's argument in the first part of its brief dovetailed two interrelated
             themes: First, that state regulation of intrastate commerce was not pre-empted by the Sherman Act and, second, that the
             framers of the Sherman Act did not intend its proscriptions to run directly against the sovereign States.  It was the first of these
             themes that California deemed primary.  Near the close of the first part of California's brief appeared the following passage: ""To hold the State within the prohibition of the Sherman Act in the present instance would result in prohibiting it from exercising
             its otherwise valid police powers.  This Court has repeatedly and emphatically stated that 'it should never be held that Congress
             intends to supersede or by its legislation suspend the exercise of the police powers of the State, even when it may do so, unless
             its purpose to effect that result is clearly manifested.'"" Supplemental Brief for Appellants 47-48 in Parker v. Brown, O.T. 1942,

             of interstate commerce would clearly be void.  The question here is whether a state may itself undertake to control the supply
             and price of a commodity shipped in interstate commerce or otherwise restrain interstate competition through a mandatory
             regulation."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 63 in Parker v. Brown, O.T. 1942, No. 46. He then acknowledged that ""[i]t seems clear that Congress, when it enacted the statute, did not intend to deprive the states of
             their normal 'police' powers over business and industry….  For example, in the field of public utilities, a state can undoubtedly
             regulate rates without running afoul of the Sherman Act notwithstanding the fact that the rate regulation may embrace interstate
             commerce."" Id., at 63-64 (footnotes and citations omitted).  But, the Solicitor General continued, ""[a]lthough Congress plainly did
             not regard local laws in these fields as incompatible with the Sherman Act, we believe that the same cannot be said when the
             state statute is designed directly to control the competitive aspects of an industry in a manner which will have more than local
             effect."" Id., at 64-65.  This was the critical portion of the Solicitor General's argument, which sought to draw a delicate distinction
             between acceptable police power legislation, such as public utility regulation, and pre-empted police power legislation, such as
             that designed explicitly to suppress competition affecting interstate commerce. "
 778 ,9     ," The only exception is where the attempt to influence state regulation is a ""sham"" aimed at ""harass[ing] and deterr[ing]…

 779 ,10    ," The Court's reliance on Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, is misplaced.  There the Court held that a utility's
             discontinuance of service to a customer for nonpayment of bills was not ""state action"" sufficient to trigger the protections of the
             Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The petitioner had argued that because the State Public Utility Commission
             had approved that practice as a part of the respondent's general tariff, the termination was ""state action"" for Fourteenth
             Amendment purposes.  Id., at 354. The Court disagreed, holding as follows: ""The nature of governmental regulation of private
             utilities is such that a utility may frequently be required by the state regulatory scheme to obtain approval for practices a
             business regulated in less detail would be free to institute without any approval from a regulatory body.  Approval by a state
             utility commission of such a request from a regulated utility, where the Commission has not put its own weight on the side of the
             proposed practice by ordering it, does not transmute a practice initiated by the utility and approved by the Commission into 'state
             action.' At most, the Commission's failure to overturn this practice amounted to no more than a determination that a
             Pennsylvania utility was authorized to employ such a practice if it so desired.  Respondent's exercise of the choice allowed by
             state law where the initiative comes from it and not from the State, does not make its action in doing so 'state action' for
             purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment."" Id., at 357 (footnote omitted). This constitutional holding has no bearing on whether a utility's action in compliance with a tariff which it proposed is exempt
             from Sherman Act liability.  The latter is a question of legislative intent, not constitutional law, and must be answered on the
             basis of a separate line of authority -- namely, decisions such as Parker and Noerr which have construed the Sherman Act."
 779 ,11    ," I disagree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE's conclusion that Michigan's policy is ""neutral"" with respect to whether a utility should
             have a lamp-exchange program.  See n. 26, infra. Moreover, I think it is apparent that insistence on statutory articulation of a
             state ""purpose"" to regulate activities performed incident to the provision of a ""natural monopoly"" service will lead to serious
             interference with state regulation. See ibid."
 779 ,12    ," As the Court noted in Noerr, the scheme at issue in Parker required popular initiative.  365 U.S., at 137-138, n. 17. And as it
             further noted, Parker itself expressly rejected the argument that the necessity for private initiative affected the ""program's validity
             under the Sherman Act…."" Id., at 137. "
 780 ,13    ," The Court seems to indicate at one point that it would be improper to ""superimpose"" antitrust liability on state regulatory
             schemes aimed at suppressing competition and raising prices.  See ante, at 595 (""Unquestionably there are examples of
             economic regulation in which the very purpose of the government control is to avoid the consequences of unrestrained
             competition.  Agricultural marketing programs, such as that involved in Parker, were of that character"").  But some state
             regulation, the Court continues, aims not at suppressing competition, but rather at duplicating the effects of competition -- i.e.,
             keeping prices down.  With respect to state regulation of the latter type, the state scheme will not afford an exemption to the
             extent the regulated party is engaged in ""business activity in competitive areas of the economy."" Ante, at 596 (footnote omitted). This rationale will not bear its own weight.  If compliance with a state program aimed at suppressing competition in nonmonopoly
             industries -- i.e., raisin production -- cannot give rise to Sherman Act liability, then surely compliance with a state program aimed
             at controlling the terms and conditions of service performed incident to the provision of a ""natural monopoly"" product cannot give
             rise to treble damages. "

             See infra, at 639.  Even assuming, however, that Schwegmann conflicted with Parker, then surely the most significant aspect of
             that conflict is that Congress did not allow it to persist, as Schwegmann was soon legislatively overruled by the enactment of the

             a program."" Ante, at 584, 585.  This statement seems to suggest that the Court considers the specificity with which a state
             legislature deals with particular regulatory matters to be relevant in determining whether agency action respecting such matters
             represents a sovereign choice, entitled to deference under the Sherman Act. This suggestion overlooks the fact that Michigan's policy, far from being ""neutral,"" is, as announced in Mich. Comp. Laws §

             500. The District Court held that a § 2 violation had been proved.  Although the Court of Appeals did not reach this issue, a
             remand is unnecessary.  It is clear that neither the District Court's findings of fact nor the record supports the conclusion that § 2
             was violated.  The District Court found only that ""the defendants did combine or conspire to increase sales of prefabricated
             house packages by United States Steel Corporation by the making of loans to numerous builders containing the tie-in provision""

             ""increasing sales"" and ""increasing market share"" are normal business goals, not forbidden by § 2 without other evidence of an
             intent to monopolize.  The evidence in this case does not bridge the gap between the District Court's findings of intent to
             increase sales and its legal conclusion of conspiracy to monopolize.  Moreover, petitioners did not have a large market share or
             dominant market position.  See n. 3, infra. No inference of intent to monopolize can be drawn from the fact that a firm with a
             small market share has engaged in nonpredatory competitive conduct in the hope of increasing sales.  Yet as we conclude,

             Fortner contends that acceptance of the package by a significant number of customers is itself sufficient to prove the seller's
             economic power.  But this approach depends on the absence of other explanations for the willingness of buyers to purchase the
             package. See 415 F. 2d, at 68. In the Northern Pacific case, for instance, the Court explained: ""The very existence of this host of tying arrangements is itself compelling evidence of the defendant's great power, at least
             where, as here, no other explanation has been offered for the existence of these restraints.  The 'preferential routing' clauses
             conferred no benefit on the purchasers or lessees.  While they got the land they wanted by yielding their freedom to deal with
             competing carriers, the defendant makes no claim that it came any cheaper than if the restrictive clauses had been omitted.  In
             fact any such price reduction in return for rail shipments would have quite plainly constituted an unlawful rebate to the shipper.
             So far as the Railroad was concerned its purpose obviously was to fence out competitors, to stifle competition."" 356 U.S., at 7-8
             (footnote omitted). As this passage demonstrates, this case differs from Northern Pacific because use of the tie-in in this case can be explained as
             a form of price competition in the tied product, whereas that explanation was unavailable to the Northern Pacific Railway. "
 794 ,11    ," The Court in Northern Pacific concluded that the railroad ""possessed substantial economic power by virtue of its extensive
             landholdings"" and then described those holdings as follows: ""As pointed out before, the defendant was initially granted large acreages by Congress in the several North-western States
             through which its lines now run.  This land was strategically located in checkerboard fashion amid private holdings and within
             economic distance of transportation facilities.  Not only the testimony of various witnesses but common sense makes it evident
             that this particular land was often prized by those who purchased or leased it and was frequently essential to their business
             activities."" Id., at 7."
 794 ,12    ," ""Since one of the objectives of the patent laws is to reward uniqueness, the principle of these cases was carried over into
             antitrust law on the theory that the existence of a valid patent on the tying product, without more, establishes a distinctiveness
             sufficient to conclude that any tying arrangement involving the patented product would have anticompetitive consequences.""
             United States v. Loew's Inc., 371 U.S. 38, 46."
 794 ,13    ," ""Accordingly, the proper focus of concern is whether the seller has the power to raise prices, or impose other burdensome
             terms such as a tie-in, with respect to any appreciable number of buyers within the market."" 394 U.S., at 504. Professor Dam correctly analyzed the burden of proof imposed on Fortner by this language.  In his article in the 1969 Supreme
             Court Review, 25-26, he reasoned: ""One important question in interpreting the Fortner decision is the meaning of this language.  Taken out of context, it might be
             thought to mean that, just as the 'host of tying arrangements' was 'compelling evidence' of 'great power' in Northern Pacific, so
             the inclusion of tie-in clauses in contracts with 'any appreciable numbers of buyers' establishes market power.  But the passage
             read in context does not warrant this interpretation.  For the immediately preceding sentence makes clear that market power in
             the sense of power over price must still exist.  If the price could have been raised but the tie-in was demanded in lieu of the
             higher price, then -- and presumably only then -- would the requisite economic power exist.  Thus, despite the broad language
             available for quotation in later cases, the treatment of the law on market power is on close reading not only consonant with the
             precedents but in some ways less far-reaching than Northern Pacific and Loew's, which could be read to make actual market
             power irrelevant."" (Footnotes omitted.) "

             breach-of-contract claim was withdrawn by Continental during the course of the proceedings.  The parties eventually stipulated
             to a judgment for Maguire on its claim against Continental."
 805 ,10    ," There were two major dissenting opinions.  Judge Kilkenny argued that the present case is indistinguishable from Schwinn
             and that the jury had been correctly instructed.  Agreeing with Judge Kilkenny's interpretation of Schwinn, Judge Browning
             stated that he found the interpretation responsive to and justified by the need to protect ""'individual traders from unnecessary
             restrictions upon their freedom of action.'"" 537 F.2d, at 1021. See n. 21, infra."
 805 ,11    ," This Court has never given plenary consideration to the question of the proper antitrust analysis of location restrictions.
             Before Schwinn such restrictions had been sustained in Boro Hall Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 124 F.2d 822 (CA2 1942).
             Since the decision in Schwinn, location restrictions have been sustained by three Courts of Appeals, including the decision
             below.  Salco Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 517 F.2d 567 (CA10 1975); Kaiser v. General Motors Corp, 396 F.Supp. 33 (ED
             Pa. 1975), affirmance order, 530 F.2d 964 (CA3 1976). "
 807 ,12    ," The distinctions drawn by the Court of Appeals and endorsed in MR. JUSTICE WHITE's separate opinion have no basis in
             Schwinn. The intrabrand competitive impact of the restrictions at issue in Schwinn ranged from complete elimination to mere
             reduction; yet, the Court did not even hint at any distinction on this ground.  Similarly, there is no suggestion that the per se rule
             was applied because of Schwinn's prominent position in its industry.  That position was the same whether the bicycles were sold
             or consigned, but the Court's analysis was quite different.  In light of MR. JUSTICE WHITE's emphasis on the ""superior
             consumer acceptance"" enjoyed by the Schwinn brand name, post, at 63, we note that the Court rejected precisely that premise
             in Schwinn. Applying the rule of reason to the restrictions imposed in nonsale transactions, the Court stressed that there was ""no
             showing that [competitive bicycles were] not in all respects reasonably interchangeable as articles of competitive commerce with "
 808 ,      ," the Schwinn product"" and that it did ""not regard Schwinn's claim of product excellence as establishing the contrary."" 388 U.S..,
             at 381, and n. 7. Although Schwinn did hint at preferential treatment for new entrants and failing firms, the District Court below
             did not even submit Sylvania's claim that it was failing to the jury.  Accordingly, MR. JUSTICE WHITE's position appears to
             reflect an extension of Schwinn in this regard.  Having crossed the ""failing firm"" line, MR. JUSTICE WHITE attempts neither to
             draw a new one nor to explain why one should be drawn at all."

 808 ,14    ," Indeed, as one commentator has observed, many courts ""have struggled to distinguish or limit Schwinn in ways that are a
             tribute to judicial ingenuity."" Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 272.  Thus, the statement in Schwinn that post-sale vertical restrictions as
             to customers or territories are ""unreasonable without more,"" 388 U. S., at 379, has been interpreted to allow an exception to the
             per se rule where the manufacturer proves ""more"" by showing that the restraints will protect consumers against injury and the
             manufacturer against product liability claims.  See, e.g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932, 936-938 (CA3 1970) (en banc).
             Similarly, the statement that Schwinn's enforcement of its restrictions had been ""'firm and resolute,'"" 388 U. S., at 372, has been
             relied upon to distinguish cases lacking that element.  See, e.g., Janel Sales Corp. v. Lanvin Parfums, Inc., 396 F.2d 398, 406
             (CA2 1968). Other factual distinctions have been drawn to justify upholding territorial restrictions that would seem to fall within
             the scope of the Schwinn per se rule. See, e.g., Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. United States, 196 Ct. Cl. 35, 44-46, 449 F.2d 1374,
             1379-1380 (1971) (per se rule inapplicable when purchaser can avoid restraints by electing to buy product at higher price);
             Colorado Pump & Supply Co. v. Febco, Inc., 472 F.2d 637 (CA10 1973) (apparent territorial restriction characterized as primary
             responsibility clause).  One Court of Appeals has expressly urged us to consider the need in this area for greater flexibility.
             Adolph Coors Co. v. FTC, 497 F.2d 1178, 1187 (CA10 1974). The decision in Schwinn and the developments in the lower courts
             have been exhaustively surveyed in ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 2, Vertical Restrictions Limiting Intrabrand
             Competition (1977) (ABA Monograph No. 2). "
 809 ,15    ," One of the most frequently cited statements of the rule of reason is that of Mr. Justice Brandeis in Chicago Bd. of Trade v.
             United States, 246 U.S. 231, 238 (1918): ""The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition
             or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.  To determine that question the court must ordinarily
             consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was
             imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the
             reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts.  This is not because a
             good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the
             court to interpret facts and to predict consequences."""
 809 ,16    ," HN3[
             ] Per se rules thus require the Court to make broad generalizations about the social utility of particular commercial
             practices.  The probability that anticompetitive consequences will result from a practice and the severity of those consequences
             must be balanced against its procompetitive consequences.  Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a per se rule
             reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to
             identify them.  Once established, per se rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and to minimize the burdens
             on litigants and the judicial system of the more complex rule-of-reason trials, see Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356
             U.S. 1, 5; United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S. 596, 609-610 (1972), but those advantages are not sufficient in
             themselves to justify the creation of per se rules.  If it were otherwise, all of antitrust law would be reduced to per se rules, thus
             introducing an unintended and undesirable rigidity in the law."
 809 ,17    ," After White Motor Co., the Courts of Appeals continued to evaluate territorial restrictions according to the rule of reason.
             Sandura Co. v. FTC, 339 F.2d 847 (CA6 1964); Snap-On Tools Corp. v. FTC, 321 F.2d 825 (CA7 1963). For an exposition of the
             history of the antitrust analysis of vertical restrictions before Schwinn, see ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 6-8. "
 810 ,18    ," As in Schwinn, we are concerned here only with nonprice vertical restrictions.  The per se illegality of price restrictions has
             been established firmly for many years and involves significantly different questions of analysis and policy.  As MR. JUSTICE
             WHITE notes, post, at 69-70, some commentators have argued that the manufacturer's motivation for imposing vertical price
             restrictions may be the same as for nonprice restrictions.  There are, however, significant differences that could easily justify
             different treatment.  In his concurring opinion in White Motor Co. v. United States, MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN noted that, unlike
             nonprice restrictions, ""[r]esale price maintenance is not only designed to, but almost invariably does in fact, reduce price
             competition not only among sellers of the affected product, but quite as much between that product and competing brands."" 372
             U.S. 268. Professor Posner also recognized that ""industrywide resale price maintenance might facilitate cartelizing."" Posner,
             supra, n. 13, at 294 (footnote omitted); see R. Posner, Antitrust: Cases, Economic Notes and Other Materials 134 (1974); E.
             Gellhorn, Antitrust Law and Economics 252 (1976); Note, 10 Colum. J. L. & Soc. Prob., supra, n. 13, at 498 n. 12.
             Furthermore, Congress recently has expressed its approval of a per se analysis of vertical price restrictions by repealing those
             provisions of the Miller-Tydings and McGuire Acts allowing fair trade pricing at the option of the individual States.  Consumer
             Goods Pricing Act of 1975, 89 Stat. 801, amending 15 U.S.C.  §§ 1, 45(a).  No similar expression of congressional intent exists
             for nonprice restrictions."
 810 ,19    ," Interbrand competition is the competition among the manufacturers of the same generic product - television sets in this case -
             and is the primary concern of antitrust law.  The extreme example of a deficiency of interbrand competition is monopoly, where
             there is only one manufacturer. In contrast, intrabrand competition is the competition between the distributors - wholesale or
             retail - of the product of a particular manufacturer. The degree of intrabrand competition is wholly independent of the level of interbrand competition confronting the manufacturer.
             Thus, there may be fierce intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a monopolist and no
             intrabrand competition among the distributors of a product produced by a firm in a highly competitive industry.  But when
             interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check on the exploitation of
             intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product."
 810 ,20    ," The Court did not specifically refer to intrabrand competition, but this meaning is clear from the context."
 810 ,21    ," The Court also stated that to impose vertical restrictions in sale transactions would ""violate the ancient rule against restraints
             on alienation."" 388 U. S., at 380. This isolated reference has provoked sharp criticism from virtually all of the commentators on
             the decision, most of whom have regarded the Court's apparent reliance on the ""ancient rule"" as both a misreading of legal
             history and a perversion of antitrust analysis.  See, e.g., Handler, supra, n. 13, at 1684-1686; Posner, supra, n. 13, at 295-296;
             Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 270-271; but see Louis, supra, n. 13, at 276 n. 6.  We quite agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART's
             dissenting comment in Schwinn that ""the state of the common law 400 or even 100 years ago is irrelevant to the issue before us:
             the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional restraints in the American economy today."" 388 U. S., at 392. We are similarly unable to accept Judge Browning's interpretation of Schwinn. In his dissent below he argued that the decision
             reflects the view that the Sherman Act was intended to prohibit restrictions on the autonomy of independent businessmen even
             though they have no impact on ""price, quality, and quantity of goods and services,"" 537 F.2d, at 1019. This view is certainly not
             explicit in Schwinn,which purports to be based on an examination of the ""impact [of the restrictions] upon the marketplace."" 388
             U. S., at 374. Competitive economies have social and political as well as economic advantages, see e.g., Northern Pac. R. Co. "
 811 ,      ," v. United States, 356 U. S., at 4, but an antitrust policy divorced from market considerations would lack any objective
             benchmarks.  As Mr. Justice Brandeis reminded us: ""Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains.  To
             bind, to restrain, is of their very essence."" Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U.S., at 238. Although MR. JUSTICE
             WHITE's opinion endorses Judge Browning's interpretation, post, at 66-68, it purports to distinguish Schwinn on grounds
             inconsistent with that interpretation, post, at 71."
 811 ,22    ," In that regard, the Court specifically stated that a more complete prohibition ""might severely hamper smaller enterprises
             resorting to reasonable methods of meeting the competition of giants and of merchandising through independent dealers."" 388
             U. S., at 380. The Court also broadly hinted that it would recognize additional exceptions to the per se rule for new entrants in an
             industry and for failing firms, both of which were mentioned in White Motor as candidates for such exceptions.  388 U.S., at 374.
             The Court might have limited the exceptions to the per se rule to these situations, which present the strongest arguments for the
             sacrifice of intrabrand competition for interbrand competition.  Significantly, it chose instead to create the more extensive
             exception for nonsale transactions which is available to all businesses, regardless of their size, financial health, or market share.
             This broader exception demonstrates even more clearly the Court's awareness of the ""redeeming virtues"" of vertical restrictions."
 811 ,23    ," Marketing efficiency is not the only legitimate reason for a manufacturer's desire to exert control over the manner in which his
             products are sold and serviced.  As a result of statutory and common-law developments, society increasingly demands that
             manufacturers assume direct responsibility for the safety and quality of their products.  For example, at the federal level, apart
             from more specialized requirements, manufacturers of consumer products have safety responsibilities under the Consumer
             Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C.  § 2051 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V), and obligations for warranties under the Consumer Product
             Warranties Act, 15 U. S. C.  § 2301 et seq. (1970 ed., Supp. V).  Similar obligations are imposed by state law.  See, e.g., Cal.
             Civ. Code § 1790 et seq. (West 1973).  The legitimacy of these concerns has been recognized in cases involving vertical
             restrictions.  See, e.g., Tripoli Co. v. Wella Corp., 425 F.2d 932 (CA3 1970). "
 812 ,24    ," ""Generally a manufacturer would prefer the lowest retail price possible, once its price to dealers has been set, because a
             lower retail price means increased sales and higher manufacturer revenues."" Note, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 636, 641 (1975). In this
             context, a manufacturer is likely to view the difference between the price at which it sells to its retailers and their price to the
             consumer as its ""cost of distribution,"" which it would prefer to minimize.  Posner, supra, n. 13, at 283."
 812 ,25    ," Professor Comanor argues that the promotional activities encouraged by vertical restrictions result in product differentiation
             and, therefore, a decrease in interbrand competition.  This argument is flawed by its necessary assumption that a large part of
             the promotional efforts resulting from vertical restrictions will not convey socially desirable information about product availability,
             price, quality, and services.  Nor is it clear that a per se rule would result in anything more than a shift to less efficient methods of
             obtaining the same promotional effects."
 812 ,26    ," We also note that per se rules in this area may work to the ultimate detriment of the small businessmen who operate as
             franchisees. To the extent that a per se rule prevents a firm from using the franchise system to achieve efficiencies that it
             perceives as important to its successful operation, the rule creates an incentive for vertical integration into the distribution
             system, thereby eliminating to that extent the role of independent businessmen.  See, e.g., Keck, The Schwinn Case, 23 Bus.
             Law. 669 (1968); Pollock, supra, n. 13, at 608-610."
 812 ,27    ," Continental's contention that balancing intrabrand and interbrand competitive effects of vertical restrictions is not a ""proper part
             of the judicial function,"" Brief for Petitioners 52, is refuted by Schwinn itself.  United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U.S., at
             608, is not to the contrary, for it involved a horizontal restriction among ostensible competitors. "
 813 ,28    ," There may be occasional problems in differentiating vertical restrictions from horizontal restrictions originating in agreements
             among the retailers. There is no doubt that restrictions in the latter category would be illegal per se, see, e.g., United States v.
             General Motors Corp., 384 U.S. 127 (1966); United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., supra, but we do not regard the problems
             of proof as sufficiently great to justify a per se rule."
 813 ,29    ," The location restriction used by Sylvania was neither the least nor the most restrictive provision that it could have used.  See
             ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 20-25.  But we agree with the implicit judgment in Schwinn that a per se rule based on the nature of
             the restriction is, in general, undesirable.  Although distinctions can be drawn among the frequently used restrictions, we are
             inclined to view them as differences of degree and form.  See Robinson, supra, n. 13, at 279-280; Averill, Sealy, Schwinn and
             Sherman One: An Analysis and Prognosis, 15 N. Y. L. F. 39, 65 (1969). We are unable to perceive significant social gain from
             channeling transactions into one form or another.  Finally, we agree with the Court in Schwinn that the advantages of vertical
             restrictions should not be limited to the categories of new entrants and failing firms.  Sylvania was faltering, if not failing, and we
             think it would be unduly artificial to deny it the use of valuable competitive tools."
 813 ,30    ," The importance of stare decisis is, of course, unquestioned, but as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in Helvering v. Hallock, 309
             U. S. 106, 119 (1940), ""STARE DECISIS is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest
             decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its
             scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience."" "
 814 ,1     ," The franchised retailers would be prevented from engaging in discounting themselves if, under the Colgate doctrine, see infra,
             at 67, the manufacturer could lawfully terminate dealers who did not adhere to his suggested retail price."
 814 ,2     ," Given the Government's emphasis on the inhibiting effect of the Schwinn restrictions on discounting activities, the Court may
             well have been referring to this effect when it condemned the restrictions as ""obviously destructive of competition."" 388 U. S., at
             379. But the Court was also heavily influenced by its concern for the freedom of dealers to control the disposition of products
             they purchased from Schwinn.  See infra, at 66-69.  In any event, the record in Schwinn illustrates the potentially greater threat
             to intrabrand competition posed by customer as opposed to location restrictions. "
 815 ,3     ," Relying on the finding of the District Court, the Government argued: ""[T]he declared purpose of the Schwinn franchising system [was] to establish and exploit a distinctive identity and superior
             consumer acceptance for the Schwinn brand name as the Cadillac of bicycles, thereby enabling the charging of a premium
             price….  This scheme could not possibly succeed, and doubtless would long ago have been abandoned, if in the consumer's
             mind other bicycles were just as good as Schwinn's."" Brief for United States, O.T. 1966, No. 25, p. 36."

             244 U.S. 459 (1917). As far as the legislative history indicates, the sole purpose of § 16 ( § 14 in the original drafts) was to
             extend to private parties the right to sue for injunctive relief. The following passage, taken in its entirety from H. R. Rep. No. 627,
             63d Cong., 2d Sess., 21 (1914), demonstrates what Congress had in mind in enacting § 16: ""Section 14 authorizes a person, firm, or corporation or association to sue for and have injunctive relief against threatened loss
             or damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against "

             in violation of the Sherman antitrust law, may recover loss and damage for such wrongful act.  There is, however, no provision
             in the existing law authorizing a person, firm, corporation, or association to enjoin threatened loss or damage to his business or
             property by the commission of such unlawful acts, and the purpose of this section is to remedy such defect in the law.  This
             provision is in keeping with the recommendation made by the President in his message to Congress on the subject of trusts and
             monopolies."" See also S. Rep. No. 698, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 17-18 (1914)."
 829 ,6     ," In California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972), this Court held that harassing and sham state-
             court proceedings of a repetitive nature could be part of an anticompetitive scheme or conspiracy.  In Otter Tail Power Co. v.
             United States, 410 U.S. 366 (1973), one of the allegations was that the federal-court defendant had instituted and supported
             state-court litigation for anticompetitive purposes in violation of the antitrust laws. The District Court had enjoined the defendant
             from ""[i]nstituting, supporting or engaging in litigation, directly or indirectly, against cities and towns, and officials thereof, which
             have voted to establish municipal power systems…."" Jurisdictional Statement, in No. O.T. 1972, 71-991, p. A-115.  This Court
             vacated and remanded to the District Court for consideration, in light of the intervening decision of California Motor Transport, of
             whether the state-court litigation came within the ""mere sham"" exception announced in Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference
             v. Noerr Motor Freight, 365 U.S. 127 (1961). Those cases together may be cited for the proposition that repetitive, sham
             litigation in state courts may constitute an antitrust violation and that an injunction may lie to enjoin future state-court litigation.
             However, neither of those cases involved the injunction of a pending state-court proceeding, and thus the bar of § 2283 was not
             brought into play. Nothing that we say today cuts back in any way on the holdings of these two cases; what we must here decide is whether such a
             lawsuit may be enjoined by a federal court after it has been commenced, notwithstanding the bar of the Anti-Injunction Act.
             While we conclude that it may not, nothing in our opinion today prevents a federal court in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction
             enjoin from the commencement of additional state-court proceedings if it concludes from the course and outcome of the first one
             that such proceedings would constitute a violation of the antitrust laws. With respect to this future litigation, the injunction will
             prevent even the commencement of a second such action, and the principles of federalism do not require the bar of § 2283.
             This distinction is totally consistent with the realization that the true bona fides of the initial state-court litigation is often not
             apparent: ""One claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may
             emerge which leads the fact finder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused."" California
             Motor Transport, supra, at 513. Any ""disadvantage"" to which the federal plaintiff is put in the initial proceeding is diminished by his ability to set up the federal
             antitrust claim as an affirmative defense, reviewable by this Court under 28 U.S.C.  § 1257 (3), and his ability to sue for treble
             damages resulting from the vexatious prosecution of that state-court litigation."

             Petitioner 10-11, n. 7."
 830 ,8     ," MR. JUSTICE STEVENS in his dissent, see post, at 649-654, would conclude that since certain types of state-court litigation
             may violate the antitrust laws, an injunction of such litigation while pending is ""expressly authorized"" under the provisions of the
             Anti-Injunction Act.  But this conclusion does not at all follow from the premise that judicial decisions have construed the
             prohibition of the antitrust laws to include sham and frivolous state-court proceedings - a premise with which we do not at all
             disagree, see n. 6, supra. The conclusion is supportable only as a matter of policy preference, and not of statutory construction.
             Under MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' view, all a federal court need do is find a violation of the federal statute, then by the very force
             of that finding ""express authorization"" for the statute would be presumed.  But this approach flies in the face of our past
             decisions.  For example, in Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225, 227 (1972), the petitioner had alleged that the state courts ""were
             depriving him of rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments."" Under MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' syllogistic
             formulation, since the state-court action is a violation of § 1983, the express authorization would be readily found on the face of
             the statute.  However, the Court in Mitchum found no such ipso facto shortcut to the explicit prohibition of § 2283, but resorted to
             careful analysis of the legislative history in order to find evidence of congressional authorization. In short, MR. JUSTICE
             STEVENS' approach, which removes the bar of § 2283 from all federal injunctive statutes, is totally inconsistent with this Court's
             longstanding recognition that ""[l]egislative policy is here expressed in a clear-cut prohibition qualified only by specifically defined
             exceptions."" Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., 348 U.S. 511, 516 (1955). In reaching this conclusion, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS argues that the Anti-Injunction Act should be ""considered wholly
             inapplicable to later enacted federal statutes that are enforceable exclusively in federal litigation."" Post, at 659.  But this view is
             inconsistent with the approach adopted by the Court in Clothing Workers, supra. In that case, an employer had sought an
             injunction against a union in state court.  This Court found that the action before the state court was ""outside state authority,"" 348
             U.S., at 514, and that jurisdiction was vested solely in the National Labor Relations Board.  But the Court found that the
             exclusive federal jurisdiction was not sufficient to render § 2283 inapplicable.  See also Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive
             Engineers, 398 U.S. 281 (1970). We think MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' view tends to confuse the jurisdiction granted to federal courts by § 16 of the Clayton Act
             with the separate question of whether a court having such jurisdiction has also been ""expressly authorize[d""] to enjoin state-court
             proceedings.  Post, at 650-654.  But the question of whether an injunction against state-court proceedings has been ""expressly
             authorized"" under § 2283 never arises unless the federal court asked to issue the injunction has subject-matter jurisdiction of the
             case in which the injunction is sought.  Here the District Court is entirely free to proceed with the litigation on the merits of
             respondents' antitrust claim against petitioner, and to grant damages and such other relief as may be appropriate if it determines
             the issues in favor of respondents.  All that we conclude is that it may not include as a part of that relief an injunction against an
             already pending state-court proceeding. "
 831 ,9     ," Much of MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' dissenting opinion is an able brief for the conceded importance of the Sherman and Clayton
             Acts.  But however persuasive it might be in inducing Congress to lift the bar of § 2283 with respect to injunctions issued under §
             16, we do not believe it is persuasive in determining whether, under the present state of the law, Congress has in fact ""expressly
             authorized"" the injunction issued by the District Court here.  For example, MR. JUSTICE STEVENS laments that state-court
             proceedings may now become the vehicles by which an antitrust violator may put one independent businessman after another
             out of business.  See post, at 652-654, 657.  Federal courts are able to enjoin future repetitive litigation, see discussion of
             California Motor Transport and Otter Tail Power, supra, n. 6.  But even if one were to agree with this broad speculation, the
             solution is simple and straightforward.  If Congress determines that the use of state-court proceedings to foster anticompetitive
             schemes is of sufficient gravity, it may simply conclude that the need for greater antitrust enforcement outweighs the need to
             prevent friction in our federal system and amend § 16 to expressly authorize an injunction of state-court proceedings. No desire for more vigorous antitrust enforcement should cause us to lose sight of our role as judges in interpreting the explicit
             command of a congressional statute; for notwithstanding the rhetoric of the dissenting opinion, the conclusion that § 16 is an
             ""expressly authorized"" exception to § 2283 is no more than an ipse dixit. The ""explicit wording of § 2283,"" Atlantic Coast Line R.
             Co., supra, at 297, is lost on the dissent; the dissent's approach is the clearest form of judicial improvisation which the Court
             counseled against in Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., supra, at 514."

             This Act, enacted in response to wartime exigencies, expired in 1947. "
 833 ,*     ," I cannot agree with MR. JUSTICE STEVENS post, at 661-662 that the examples given in the quoted portion of California Motor
             Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, necessarily involve the use of the adjudicatory process in the same way that the state
             courts were being used in this case.  For example, there is no reason to believe that the Court's reference to the use of a patent
             obtained by fraud to exclude a competitor contemplated only one lawsuit. The case cited in connection with that reference,
             Walker Process Equipment, Inc. v. Food Machinery & Chemical Corp., 382 U.S. 172 (1965), held only that the enforcement of a
             patent procured by fraud on the Patent Office could state a claim under § 2 of the Sherman Act, where the monopolistic acts
             alleged included use of the fraudulent patent through a course of action involving both threats of suit and prosecution of an
             infringement suit. MR. JUSTICE STEVENS' quotation from California Motor Transport stops just short of the language that I consider critical to the
             instant case.  The Court's opinion continues: ""Misrepresentations, condoned in the political arena, are not immunized when used in the adjudicatory process.  Opponents
             before agencies or courts often think poorly of the other's tactics, motions, or defenses and may readily call them baseless. One
             claim, which a court or agency may think baseless, may go unnoticed; but a pattern of baseless, repetitive claims may emerge
             which leads the fact finder to conclude that the administrative and judicial processes have been abused.  That may be a difficult
             line to discern and draw."" 404 U.S., at 513. Since I believe that federal courts should be hesitant indeed to enjoin ongoing state-court proceedings, I am of the opinion that a
             pattern of baseless, repetitive claims or some equivalent showing of grave abuse of the state courts must exist before an
             injunction would be proper.  No such finding was made by the District Court in this case. "

             these courts are limited in their jurisdiction to the State, and, in our complex system of government, are admitted to be unable to
             deal with the great evil that now threatens us. ""…  The purpose of this bill is to enable the courts of the United States to apply the same remedies against combinations which
             injuriously affect the interests of the United States that have been applied in the several States to protect local interests. ….. ""…  The committee therefore deemed it proper by express legislation to confer on the circuit courts of the United States original
             jurisdiction of all suits of a civil nature at common law or in equity arising under this section, with authority to issue all remedial
             process or writs proper and necessary to enforce its provisions…."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2456 (1890).  Later the same day he said:
             [Congress] may 'regulate commerce;' can it not protect commerce, nullify contracts that restrain commerce, turn it from its
             natural courses, increase the price of articles, and therefore diminish the amount of commerce? ….. ""[The power of the 'combinations'] for mischief will be greatly crippled by this bill.  Their present plan of organization was adopted
             only to evade the jurisdiction of State courts. ….. ""Suppose one of these combinations should unite all, or nearly all, the domestic producers of an article of prime necessity with a
             view to prevent competition and to keep the price up to the foreign cost and duty added, would not this be in restraint of trade
             and commerce and affect injuriously the operation of our revenue laws?  Can Congress prescribe no remedy except to repeal its
             taxes?  Surely it may authorize the executive authorities to appeal to the courts of the United States for such a remedy, as courts
             habitually apply in the States for the forfeiture of charters thus abused and the punishment of officers who practice such wrongs
             to the public.  It may also give to our citizens the right to sue for such damages as they have suffered."" Id., at 2462.  Senator
             Sherman, 3 days later, discussing the rise of the ""combinations"" during the preceding 20 years, stated: ""…  The State courts have attempted to wrestle with this difficulty.  I produced decisions of the supreme courts of several of the
             States. ""Take the State of New York, where the sugar trust was composed of seventeen corporations.  What remedy had the people of
             New York in the suit that they had against that combination?  None whatever, except as against one corporation out of the
             seventeen.  No proceeding could be instituted in the State of New York by which all those corporations could be brought in one
             suit under the common jurisdiction of the United States.  No remedy could be extended by the courts, although they were eager
             and earnest in search of a remedy. ….. "
 836 ,      ," ""…  When a man is injured by an unlawful combination why should he not have the power to sue in the courts of the United
             States? It would not answer to send him to a State court.  It would not answer at all to send him to a court of limited jurisdiction.
             Then, besides, it is a court of the United States that alone has jurisdiction over all parts of the United States.  The United States
             can send its writs into every part of a State and make parties in different States submit to its process.  The States can not do
             that."" Id., at 2568-2569. Similarly, in the House debate Congressman Culberson, floor sponsor of the bill, had this to say during his introductory remarks: ""If Congress will legislate within its sphere and to the limit to which it may go, and if the legislatures of the several States will do
             their duty and supplement that legislation, the trusts and combinations which are devouring the substance of the people of the
             country may be effectually suppressed.  The States are powerless unless Congress will take charge of the trade between the
             States and make unlawful traffic that operates in restraint of trade and which promotes and encourages monopoly."" Id., at 4091. See Letwin, Congress and the Sherman Antitrust Law: 1887-1890, 23 U. Chi. L. Rev. 221 (1956)."

             occasioned by the evils which it was contemplated would be prevented, and hence not only the prohibitions of the statute but the

             of the congressional intent.  Congressman McGillicuddy, a member of the Commerce Committee, described the perceived need: "
 837 ,      ," ""Under the present law any person injured in his business or property by acts in violation of the Sherman antitrust law may
             recover his damage….  There is no provision under the present law, however, to prevent threatened loss or damage even
             though it be irreparable.  The practical effect of this is that a man would have to sit by and see his business ruined before he
             could take advantage of his remedy.  In what condition is such a man to take up a long and costly lawsuit to defend his rights? ""The proposed bill solves this problem for the person, firm, or corporation threatened with loss or damage to property by
             providing injunctive relief against the threatened act that will cause such loss or damage.  Under this most excellent provision a
             man does not have to wait until he is ruined in his business before he has his remedy."" 51 Cong. Rec. 9261 (1914). During consideration of the Conference Report Congressman Floyd described the scope of the § 16 remedy: ""[S]o that if a man is injured by a discriminatory contract, by a tying contract, by the unlawful acquisition of stock of competing
             corporations, or by reason of someone acting unlawfully as a director in two banks or other corporations, he can go into any

 838 ,21    ," The potential consequences of the plurality's view may perhaps best be illustrated by reference to a common-law decision that
             could not possibly survive scrutiny under the Sherman Act. In Nordenfelt v. Maxim Nordenfelt Guns & Ammunition Co., [1894]
             A.C. 535, the House of Lords held that a 25-year, worldwide covenant not to compete in the arms business was an enforceable
             bargain.  One of the parties to such a contract was therefore entitled to enjoin a breach of the agreement by another party.  If
             such common-law relief should be granted by a state court in a comparable situation, and if the plurality's interpretation of the
             statute were accepted, a federal court would be powerless to interfere with state proceedings to enforce such a judgment."
 838 ,22    ," The text of the statute is quoted in n. 4, supra."
 838 ,23    ," Rather surprisingly the plurality seems to regard Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., 348 U.S. 511, as supporting its
             position.  That case involved a construction of the portion of the Taft-Hartley Act that conferred jurisdiction on the National Labor
             Relations Board to obtain injunctive relief in certain situations.  The Court rejected the argument that the statute implicitly
             authorized similar relief for private parties: ""Congress explicitly gave such jurisdiction to the district courts only on behalf of the Board on a petition by it or 'the officer or
             regional attorney to whom the matter may be referred.' § 10 (j), (1), 61 Stat. 149, 29 U.S.C.  § 160 (j), (1).  To hold that the Taft-
             Hartley Act also authorizes a private litigant to secure interim relief would be to ignore the closely circumscribed jurisdiction given
             to the District Court and to generalize where Congress has chosen to specify.  To find exclusive authority for relief vested in the
             Board and not in private parties accords with other aspects of the Act."" Id., at 517. Since the statute did not expressly authorize the requested relief, it was obviously not within the ""expressly authorized""
             exception to § 2283.  The fact that the Court simply read the relevant statutes literally in that case supports my view that we
             should use the same approach here. In Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 398 U.S. 281, on which the plurality also relies, the union did not even
             argue that injunctive relief was expressly authorized by federal statute.  It unsuccessfully contended ""that the federal injunction
             was proper either 'to protect or effectuate' the District Court's denial of an injunction in 1967, or as 'necessary in aid of' the
             District Court's jurisdiction."" Id., at 284. That case is wholly inapposite to the issue presented today. "
 839 ,      ," The fact that these two cases provide the plurality with its strongest support emphasizes the dramatic character of its refusal to
             accept the plain meaning of the words Congress has written."
 839 ,24    ," ""But the power of the District Courts to issue an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court is questioned, since, by the
             Judiciary Act of 1973, 1 Stat. 335, it was declared that no writ of injunction shall be granted [by the United States courts] 'to stay
             proceedings in any court of a State.' But the act of 1851 was a subsequent statute, and by the 4th section of this act - after
             providing for proceedings to be had under it for the benefit of ship owners, and after declaring that it shall be deemed a sufficient
             compliance with its requirements on their part if they shall transfer their interest in ship and freight for the benefit of the claimants
             to a trustee to be appointed by the court - it is expressly declared, that 'from and after [such] transfer all claims and proceedings
             against the owners shall cease.' Surely this injunction applies as well to 'claims and proceedings' in State courts as to those in
             the federal courts…."" 109 U.S., at 599-600."
 839 ,25    ," The relevant portions of §§ 205(a) and (c) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 33, simply provided: ""SEC.  205. (a) Whenever in the judgment of the Administrator any person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or
             practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of section 4 of this Act, he may make application to the
             appropriate court for an order enjoining such acts or practices, or for an order enforcing compliance with such provision, and
             upon a showing by the Administrator that such person has engaged or is about to engage in any such acts or practices a
             permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order shall be granted without bond. .  .  . ""(c) The district courts shall have jurisdiction of criminal proceedings for violations of section 4 of this Act, and, concurrently with
             State and Territorial courts, of all other proceedings under section 205 of this Act."""
 839 ,26    ," ""In the first place, it is evident that, in order to qualify under the 'expressly authorized' exception of the anti-injunction statute, a
             federal law need not contain an express reference to that statute.  As the Court has said, 'no prescribed formula is required; an
             authorization need not expressly refer to § 2283.' Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. Richman Bros. Co., 348 U.S. 511, 516.
             Indeed, none of the previously recognized statutory exceptions contains any such reference.  Secondly, a federal law need not
             expressly authorize an injunction of a state court proceeding in order to qualify as an exception.  Three of the six previously
             recognized statutory exceptions contain no such authorization. Thirdly, it is clear that, in order to qualify as an 'expressly
             authorized' exception to the anti-injunction statute, an Act of Congress must have created a specific and uniquely federal right or
             remedy, enforceable in a federal court of equity, that could be frustrated if the federal court were not empowered to enjoin a
             state court proceeding.  This is not to say that in order to come within the exception an Act of Congress must, on its face and in
             every one of its provisions, be totally incompatible with the prohibition of the anti-injunction statute.  The test, rather, is whether
             an Act of Congress, clearly creating a federal right or remedy enforceable in a federal court of equity, could be given its intended
             scope only by the stay of a state court proceeding."" 407 U.S., at 237-238 (footnotes omitted)."
 839 ,27    ," See n. 11, supra. "
 840 ,28    ," Thus, the 1851 Act to limit the liability of shipowners, 9 Stat. 635, applied equally to ""preventing or arresting the prosecution of
             separate suits,"" see Providence & N.Y.S.S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., 109 U.S., 578, 596. The Interpleader Act, 28 U.S.C.§ 2361, in
             terms, applies equally to the ""instituting or prosecuting"" of other litigation.  In terms of the interest in federalism, since the
             injunction against litigation typically runs against the parties rather than the court, there is little difference between denying a
             citizen access to the state forum and denying him the right to prosecute an existing case to its conclusion.  In either situation, a
             federal injunction must rest on a determination that an important federal policy outweighs the interest in allowing a state court to
             resolve a particular controversy.  But when the federal policy does justify that conclusion, the timing of the state-court action
             should rarely be controlling."
 840 ,29    ," See n. 7, supra."
 840 ,30    ," It is true that when the Sherman Act was passed, Congress did not expressly address ""the possibility that state-court
             proceedings would be used to violate the Sherman or Clayton Acts."" Ante, at 634.  As the statute has been construed, however,
             it is now well settled that state courts can be used as the very instruments by which litigants, and the public, may be deprived of
             rights protected by the antitrust laws. When the state courts are so used and the antitrust laws thereby violated, the state
             litigation is as plainly a matter of federal legislative concern as if it had been expressly identified in the debates preceding the
             enactment of the 1890 statute."
 840 ,31    ," As already noted, supra, at 654-655, n. 23, there was no such express grant of jurisdiction to private litigants in either Clothing

 840 ,32    ," Indeed, Mr. Justice Black's opinion for the Court in Porter v. Dicken, 328 U.S. 252, seems to proceed on the assumption that
             the anti-injunction statute is inapplicable when the federal statute may be enforced in either a state or a federal court. "
 841 ,33    ," Cases in which § 2283 has been held to bar injunctive relief against state proceedings have seldom involved attempts to
             enforce federal statutes.  Indeed, some courts have held that any federal statute expressly authorizing equitable relief is within
             the exception from § 2283."
 841 ,34    ," It is worthy of note that only 5 of the cited statutes predate the addition of the words ""except as expressly authorized by Act of
             Congress"" to the anti-injunction statute in 1948 (fully 16 were enacted in the last 10 years)."

             overrule Toucey v. New York Life Ins. Co., 314 U.S. 118, ""the revised section restores the basic law as generally understood

 842 ,36    ," ""In some situations there could be, of course, a violation of a covenant not to compete without the breach of a fiduciary duty,
             as would be the case if Stoner had not been an officer and director of plaintiff.  In the present case, however, the acts of
             defendants in misappropriating the Lektro-Vend [machine] and their use of it to compete against plaintiff are intertwined, the
             latter being, so to speak, the means by which the former was brought to bear against plaintiff."" Vendo Co. v. Stoner, 58 Ill. 2d

 843 ,37    ," Indeed, a state court's conclusion that the breach of a covenant not to compete constitutes the violation of a fiduciary
             obligation as a matter of state law is not inconsistent with a federal-court determination that the litigation enforcing that covenant
             was ""conducted in bad faith"" as that concept is used in cases like Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 611. While the District
             Court did not specifically address the question involved in Huffman and Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, it had the following to
             say in addressing the extent of the Sherman Act violation: ""There is persuasive evidence that Vendo's activities in its litigation against the Stoner interests in Illinois state court were not a
             genuine attempt to use the adjudicative process legitimately.  Its theft of trade secret claim was clearly non-meritorious, and
             litigation of this claim might well be interpreted - considering the record as a whole - as an attempt to further harass the Stoner
             interests and limit the amount of aid Stoner could lend Lektro-Vend.  The attempt to enforce the covenants not to compete…
             appears to have been to lengthen the period for which the noncompetition covenants would run.  The purpose of this portion of
             the state litigation seems purely anticompetitive."" 403 F.Supp., at 534-535. The Court of Appeals implicitly affirmed, supra, at 646.  Thus while every state proceeding which clashes with the antitrust laws
             would not necessarily be motivated by a desire to harass or be conducted in bad faith, the findings indicate that such was the
             case here."

             Kansas City, Kan. (hereinafter Kansas), decided to develop its Public Levee as a metropolitan rail food terminal with wholesale
             and retail produce markets.  Kansas constructed, operated, and owned the market, financing the development with municipal
             revenue bonds. Another city, Kansas City, Mo. (hereinafter Missouri), also operated a rail food terminal within the same metropolitan area.
             Because Kansas believed that there was insufficient business in the metropolitan area to support both markets, it developed a
             plan to induce Missouri produce dealers to lease its facilities by offering cash payments and temporary reduction or abatement
             of rent.  These payments exceeded the amounts needed to compensate the merchants for the costs of moving, settlement of
             existing leases, and disruption to business.  Kansas adopted the payment plan by resolution, and its legality under Kansas law
             was sustained by the Kansas Supreme Court in a quo warranto proceeding.  State ex rel. Parker v. Kansas City, 151 Kan. 1, 97
             P.2d 104, 98 P.2d 101 (1939). The Missouri terminal was served by a number of railroads, but the Kansas terminal was served virtually exclusively by the
             Union Pacific Railroad.  As merchants moved from Missouri to Kansas, the Union Pacific's traffic necessarily increased while
             that of the other railroads shrank.  The United States charged that the effect of Kansas' concessions to merchants was to permit
             them to ship produce over the Union Pacific more cheaply than on the competing railroads serving the Missouri terminal and, in
             effect, amounted to a rebate from Union Pacific's tariffs.  The District Court permanently enjoined Kansas from giving cash or
             rental credits to Missouri dealers to move or for moving to Kansas. On appeal to this Court, Kansas argued that because the concessions were lawful under state law, it could not be enjoined from
             making them, and the United States argued that the municipality was a ""person"" within the meaning of the statute and therefore
             subject to the Act on the same terms as a private corporation.  See Brief for Appellants, O.T. 1940, No. 594, pp. 233-235, 244-

             permanent injunction against it.  Mr. Justice Roberts, in dissent, made the argument made by the cities here, that the statutory
             phrase ""every person"" was not sufficiently specific to justify the conclusion that Congress wished to subject municipal
             corporations and their officers to the criminal penalties for which the Act provided.  It is significant that the cities' argument was
             rejected in the context of the antirebate provisions of the Elkins Act, a statute which essentially is an antitrust provision serving

             terms of whether the challenged anticompetitive action was taken pursuant to state command.  Detroit Edison, an electric utility
             regulated by Michigan, was charged by an independent seller of light bulbs with antitrust violations in the operation of a program
             which provided light bulbs without extra cost to electricity customers. Detroit Edison, relying on Parker, defended on the ground
             that the light-bulb program was included in its rate filed with and approved by the State Public Service Commission and that
             state law required it to follow the terms of the tariff as long as it was in effect.  Cantor rejected the claim, holding that since no
             Michigan statutes regulated the light-bulb industry, and since neither the Michigan Legislature nor the Public Service
             Commission had passed upon the desirability of such a light-bulb program, the Commission's approval of Detroit Edison's
             program did not ""implement any statewide policy relating to light blubs"" and that ""the State's policy is neutral on the question
             whether a utility should, or should not, have such a program."" 428 U.S., at 585. THE CHIEF JUSTICE, while not joining all of the
             plurality opinion, agreed with this analysis.  Id., at 604-605. Cantor's analysis is not, however, necessarily applicable here.  Cantor was concerned with whether anticompetitive activity in
             which purely private parties engaged could, under the circumstances of that case, be insulated from antitrust enforcement.  The
             situation involved here, on the other hand, presents the issue of under what circumstances a State's subdivisions engaging in
             anticompetitive activities should be deemed to be acting as agents of the State."
 881 ,41    ," Petitioners argue that Goldfarb, like Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., supra, expresses a limitation upon the circumstances under

             suggesting that the State Bar, although a state agency by law acting in its official capacity, was somehow not a state agency
             because its official actions in issuing ethical opinions, see 421 U.S., at 791 n. 21, benefited its member-lawyers by discouraging
             price competition.  We think it obvious that the fact that the ancillary effect of the State Bar's policy, or even the conscious desire
             on its part, may have been to benefit the lawyers it regulated cannot transmute the State Bar's official actions into those of a
             private organization.  In addition to the decision in this case, every other Court of Appeals which has considered the immunity of
             state instrumentalities after Goldfarb has regarded it as having held that anticompetitive actions of a state instrumentality not
             compelled by the State acting as sovereign are not immune from the antitrust laws. Fairfax v. Fairfax Hospital Assn., 562 F. 2d

             distinguish Goldfarb on the ground that, although the State Bar was ""'a state agency for some limited purposes,' . . . the price

             which Congress in 1890 was well aware, see Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U.S. 529 (1890), is that political subdivisions are not
             as such sovereign. Certainly, nothing in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), even remotely suggested the
             contrary; we search in vain for anything in that case that establishes a constructional principle of presumptive congressional
             deference in behalf of cities.  Indeed our emphasis today in our conclusion, that municipalities are ""exempt"" from antitrust
             enforcement when acting as state agencies implementing state policy to the same extent as the State itself makes it difficult to
             see how National League of Cities is even tangentially implicated."
 882 ,43    ," ""While state legislatures exercise extensive power over their constituents and over the various units of local government, the
             States universally leave much policy and decisionmaking to their governmental subdivisions.  Legislators enact many laws but
             do not attempt to reach those countless matters of local concern necessarily left wholly or partly to those who govern at the local
             level."" Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 481 (1968). Although Avery concluded that the actions of local government are the actions of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth
             Amendment, state action required under Parker has different attributes.  Cf.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 667 n. 12 (1974)."
 882 ,44    ," Indeed, state policy may be contrary to that adopted by a political subdivision, yet, for a variety of reasons, might not render
             the local policy unlawful under state law. For example, a state public utilities commission might adopt, though we are not aware
             that the Louisiana PUC has done so, a policy prohibiting the specific anticompetitive practices in which the municipality engages,
             yet be unable to enforce that policy with respect to municipalities because it lacks jurisdiction over them.  (The Louisiana PUC, in
             litigation unrelated to this case, has been held to lack jurisdiction over municipal utility systems whether operating within or
             without the municipality. City of Monroe v. Louisiana Public Serv. Comm'n, No. 177, 757 -- Div. ""I"" (19th Jud. Dist. Ct., Sept. 14,
             1976).) If that were the case, and assuming that there were no other evidence to the contrary, it would be difficult to say that
             state policy fosters, much less compels, the anticompetitive practices. "
 883 ,      ," Louisiana Rev. Stat. Ann. § 33:1334(G) (West Supp. 1977) provides another illustration of the fact that a particular activity in
             which a subdivision technically has power to engage does not necessarily conform to, and may conflict with, state policy.
             Louisiana has authorized municipalities to create intergovernmental commissions as municipal instrumentalities jointly to
             construct and operate public services including utilities.  §§ 33:1324, 33:1331-33:1334 (West Supp. 1977).  Such commissions
             are, by definition, political subdivisions of the State.  § 33:1334(D) (West Supp. 1977).  Section 1334 (G) nevertheless provides
             that ""[n]othing in this Chapter shall be construed to grant an immunity to or on behalf of any [such] public instrumentality . . . from
             any antitrust laws of the state or of the United States."""
 883 ,45    ," We reject petitioners' fallback position that an antitrust claim will not lie for anticompetitive municipal action which, though not
             state directed, is lawful under state law. See Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384 (1951); Northern

             our Brother STEWART's dissent, post, at 438-440, likens judicial enforcement of the antitrust laws to a regime of substantive
             due process used by federal judges to strike down state and municipal economic regulation thought by them unfair.  That
             analogy, of course, ignores the congressional judgment mandating broad scope in enforcement of the antitrust laws and simply
             reflects the dissent's view that such enforcement with respect to cities is unwise. "
 884 ,47    ," While the majority and dissent disagreed in Otter Tail over whether the specific practices of which plaintiffs complained could
             be regarded as unlawful anticompetitive restraints in light of the existence of federal regulation, there was agreement that a
             lawful monopolist could violate the antitrust laws. Compare 410 U.S., at 377-382 with id., at 390-391, n. 7 (STEWART, J.,
             concurring in part and dissenting in part)."
 884 ,48    ," It may be that certain activities which might appear anticompetitive when engaged in by private parties, take on a different
             complexion when adopted by a local government.  See generally Posner, The Proper Relationship Between State Regulation

 884 ,1     ," The District Court did not, of course, make a formal finding of fact to this effect since the counterclaim was disposed of on the
             basis of pleadings.  Nonetheless, the District Court could reasonably conclude, as a matter of law, that these Cities are engaging
             in business activities which have as their aim the production of revenues in excess of costs.  It certainly is the case that the
             Cities are attempting to provide a public service, but it is likewise undeniable that they seek to do so in the most profitable way.
             The Cities allege in their complaint, for example, that they have ""been prevented from profitably expanding their businesses.""
             App. 14.  While it is correct that the Cities are ordinarily constrained from applying their net earnings as a private corporation
             would, this does not detract from their competitive posture and resulting incentive to engage in anticompetitive practices. "
 886 ,2     ," Our conceptions of the limits imposed by federalism are bound to evolve, just as our understanding of Congress' power under
             the Commerce Clause has evolved.  Consequently, since we find it appropriate to allow the ambit of the Sherman Act to expand
             with evolving perceptions of congressional power under the Commerce Clause, a similar process should occur with respect to
             ""state action"" analysis under Parker. That is, we should not treat the result in the Parker case as cast in bronze; rather, the
             scope of the Sherman Act's power should parallel the developing concepts of American federalism."
 886 ,3     ," I use the term ""proprietary"" only to focus attention on the fact that all of the parties are in a competitive relationship such that
             each should be constrained, when necessary, by the federal antitrust laws. It is highly unlikely that Congress would have meant
             to impose liability only on some of these parties, when each possesses the means to thwart federal antitrust policy."
 886 ,4     ," MR. JUSTICE STEWART's dissent, post, at 433-434, attempts to blunt this analysis by noting that the ""nongovernmental-
             governmental"" distinction was criticized in Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 61 (1955). I suggest no more, however,
             than what is obvious from our past cases: Petitioners' business activities are not entitled to per se exemption from the Sherman
             Act. This much ought to be quite clear from United States v. California, 297 U.S. 175 (1936), where the State operated a
             railroad, albeit without profit, and as a ""public function."" I cannot comprehend why the Cities here should be treated in a different
             manner.  The only authority which MR. JUSTICE STEWART cites to the contrary, Lowenstein v. Evans, 69 F. 908 (CCSC 1895),
             was a case in which a State's complete monopolization of the liquor industry was challenged as violating the Sherman Act. But
             in that circumstance the State clearly directed the creation of a monopoly, thus bringing the matter within the Parker rationale.
             Compare Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 360 (1934). "
 887 ,5     ," Such an ascertainment dovetails precisely with the law of Louisiana.  There it is recognized that the powers of a municipal
             corporation are both public and private: As to the former, the city represents the State, discharging duties incumbent upon the
             State; as to the latter, it represents pecuniary and proprietary interests of individuals, and is held to the same responsibility as a
             private person.  Hall v. Shreveport, 157 La. 589, 594, 102 So. 680, 681 (1925). A long line of Louisiana cases dealing explicitly
             with the subject of municipally owned electrical utilities holds that cities are to be governed by the same rules applicable to
             private corporations and individuals.  See Hicks v. City of Monroe Utilities Comm'n, 237 La. 848, 112 So. 2d 635 (1959); Elias v.
             Mayor of New Iberia, 137 La. 691, 69 So. 141 (1915); Hart v. Lake Providence, 5 La. App. 294 (1926); Bannister v. City of
             Monroe, 4 La. App. 182 (1926)."
 887 ,6     ," While I agree with the plurality that a State may cause certain activities to be exempt from the federal antitrust laws by virtue of
             an articulated policy to displace competition with regulation, I would require a strong showing on the part of the defendant that
             the State so intended.  Thus, I would not be satisfied, as the plurality and Court of Appeals apparently are, that the highest
             policymaking body in the State of Louisiana merely ""contemplated"" the activities being undertaken by the cities.  See ante, at

             anticompetitive activity.  Moreover, I would have the Cities demonstrate that the exemption was not only part of a regulatory
             scheme to supersede competition, but that it was essential to the State's plan.  Consequently, I do not disagree with the terms of "
 888 ,      ," the plurality's remand as such; I would simply ask for a stronger showing on the part of the Cities.  I join the judgment, however,

 888 ,7     ," In Cantor this mode of analysis effectively answered Detroit Edison's claim that it was required by state law to engage in the
             allegedly anticompetitive activities.  We ""infer[red] that the State's policy [was] neutral on the question whether a utility should, or
             should not, have such a program,"" 428 U.S., at 585 (opinion of STEVENS, J.) (emphasis added), 604-605 (opinion of BURGER,

 888 ,1     ," As the plurality acknowledges, ante, at 393 n. 8, Parker v. Brown did not create any exemption from the antitrust laws, but
             simply recognized that it was the intent of Congress that the Sherman Act should not apply to governmental action. It is thus
             hard to understand why the plurality invokes the doctrine that exemptions from the antitrust laws will not be lightly implied by
             subsequent enactment of a regulatory statute.  This rule, which effects the accommodation of two federal statutes and rests on
             the principle that implied repeals are not favored, has no relevance to the Parker doctrine, which is based on an interpretation of
             the Sherman Act itself. "

             the recipients of such services the most economical projects or structures.  Testing, calculating and designing the most
             economical and efficient structures and methods of construction is complex, difficult and expensive.  It is cheaper and easier to
             design and specify inefficient and unnecessarily expensive structures and methods of construction.  Consequently, if
             professional engineers are required by competitive pressures to submit bids in order to obtain employment of their services, the
             inevitable tendency will be to offer professional engineering services at the lowest possible price.  Although this may result in
             some lowering of the cost of professional engineering services it will inevitably result in increasing the overall cost and
             decreasing the efficiency of those structures and projects which require professional engineering design and specification work. ""(c) Experience has also demonstrated that competitive bidding in most instances and situations results in an award of the work
             to be performed to the lowest bidder, regardless of other factors such as ability, experience, expertise, skill, capability, learning
             and the like, and that such awards in the case of professional engineers endanger the public health, welfare and safety. ""(d) For the aforesaid reasons, the provisions of the NSPE Code of Ethics set out above are not, in any event, in unreasonable

 913 ,19    ," The Society also points out that competition, in the form of bargaining between the engineer and customer, is allowed under
             its canon of ethics once an engineer has been initially selected.  See n. 6, supra.  It then contends that its prohibition of
             competitive bidding regulates only the timing of competition, thus making this case analogous to Chicago Board of Trade, where
             the Court upheld an exchange rule which forbade exchange members from making purchases after the close of the day's
             session at any price other than the closing bid price.  Indeed, petitioner has reprinted the Government's brief in that case to
             demonstrate that the Solicitor General regarded the exchange's rule as a form of price fixing. Reply Brief for Petitioner A1-A28.
             We find this reliance on Chicago Board of Trade misplaced for two reasons.  First, petitioner's claim mistakenly treats negotiation
             between a single seller and a single buyer as the equivalent of competition between two or more potential sellers. Second, even
             if we were to accept the Society's equation of bargaining with price competition, our concern with Chicago Board of Trade is in
             its formulation of the proper test to be used in judging the legality of an agreement; that formulation unquestionably stresses
             impact on competition.  Whatever one's view of the application of the Rule of Reason in that case, see Sullivan, supra n. 18, at
             175-182, the Court considered the exchange's regulation of price information as having a positive effect on competition.  246

             bidding for all engineering work in foreign countries ""as required by the laws, regulations or practices of the foreign country.""

             Brooks Act, 40 U. S. C. §§ 541-544 (1970 ed., Supp. V), requires the Government to use a method of selecting engineers similar
             to the Society's ""traditional method."" See n. 6, supra.  The Society relies heavily on the Brooks Act as evidence that its ban on
             competitive bidding is reasonable.  The argument is without merit.  The Brooks Act does not even purport to exempt engineering
             services from the antitrust laws, and the reasonableness of an individual purchaser's decision not to seek lower prices through
             competition does not authorize the vendors to conspire to impose that same decision on all other purchasers."

             staying the operation of the Sherman and Clayton Acts to enable the States to adjust their statutes to South-Eastern
             Underwriters.  S. Rep. No. 20, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945); 91 Cong. Rec. 478 (1945).  Largely at the insistence of Senator
             O'Mahoney, it was amended on the floor of the Senate to provide that the Sherman and Clayton Acts would not be pre-empted
             at the expiration of the moratorium. Id., at 488.  The bill introduced in the House and reported favorably out of committee

             the bill, 91 Cong. Rec. 1481 (1945), and legislation permitting insurance companies to engage in practices constituting a
             ""boycott, coercion, or intimidation,"" which would remain subject to the Sherman Act, ibid. Senator O'Mahoney noted that the conference substitute would permit ""certain agreements which can normally be made in the
             insurance business which are in the public interest, but which might conceivably be a violation of the antitrust law,"" such as a
             ""rating bureau"" operating ""under the supervision and regulation of the State . . . ."" Id., at 1444.  But other practices constituting
             ""regulation by private combinations and groups,"" id., at 1483, would have to pass muster under the Sherman Act. "
 933 ,22    ," The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART advances the view, abandoned by petitioners in this Court, see supra, at
             546, that § 3 (b) applies only ""to the kinds of antitrust violations alleged in South-Eastern Underwriters . . . ."" Post, at 565.  The
             dissent refers to no statement, either in the Committee Reports or the debates, asserting that § 3 (b)'s only purpose was to keep
             alive the South-Eastern Underwriters indictment or purporting to restrict its scope to the practices specifically alleged therein.
             There is nothing in the proposal of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, identified by the dissent as the model
             for the Senate bill, S. 340, that evinces such a limited purpose.  The report accompanying the proposal stated in pertinent part: ""No exemption is sought nor expected for oppressive or destructive practices.  On the whole, insurance has been conducted on
             a high plane, with great benefit to the public, and if inconsistent procedures are found they must be eradicated.  Provision is
             made that the Sherman Act shall not now or hereafter be inapplicable to any act of boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" 90 Cong.
             Rec. A4406 (1944) (emphasis supplied). It is difficult to view this language as supporting the dissent's interpretation. It also is asserted that the ""boycott"" clause in the Senate bill was intended to apply only during the moratorium period, a fact
             which supposedly supports the dissent's narrow reading of the clause.  But the dissent concedes that ""[whatever] its initial
             impetus . . . , there is no indication that the provision was finally thought to be applicable only to the South-Eastern litigation.""
             Post, at 563-564, n. 20.  Moreover, neither the Committee Reports, see supra, at 546-547, nor the insurance commissioners'
             statement, quoted above, suggests an intent to suspend the operation of the ""boycott"" clause at any time.  Certainly Senator
             Ferguson disclaimed such an intent, stating he saw ""no reason for not changing the word 'section' to 'act,' because I am of the
             opinion that that was the intention of all concerned."" 91 Cong. Rec. 479 (1945).  There simply is no persuasive evidence of an
             original design merely to preserve the South-Eastern Underwriters indictment."

             Statutes, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 527, 543-544 (1947). "
 934 ,24    ," Even under petitioners' reading, certain cooperative arrangements among insurance companies may constitute a ""boycott""
             under § 3 (b) notwithstanding the applicability of § 2 (b) to activities that ""relate . . . closely to their status as reliable insurers,""
             SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, 460 (1969), and the adequacy of state regulation of the industry.  Hence,
             petitioners' line may not be as ""bright"" as they suggest. The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE STEWART also argues that the structure of the Act supports a restrictive reading of § 3
             (b).  We do not think the dissent's restatement of the holding in FTC v. National Casualty Co., 357 U.S. 560, 564 (1958), see
             post, at 557-558, n. 4, furthers resolution of the problem at hand.  It is not disputed that Congress intended that certain forms of
             ""regulation by private combinations and groups,"" 91 Cong. Rec. 1483 (1945) (remarks of Sen. O'Mahoney), remain subject to
             Sherman Act scrutiny, notwithstanding enactment of the type of ""prohibitory legislation,"" coupled with ""enforcement through a
             scheme of administrative supervision,"" that was deemed sufficient for § 2 (b) purposes in National Casualty Co.  In that case the
             Court rejected the Federal Trade Commission's argument that ""where a statute, instead of sanctioning a particular type of
             transaction, prohibits conduct in general terms and provides for enforcement through administrative action, there is realistically,
             in the absence of such enforcement, no 'regulation' in fact."" Brief for Federal Trade Commission, O. T. 1957, Nos. 435 and 436,
             p. 53.  The question that nonetheless remains is whether Congress intended to foreclose all Sherman Act protection for
             policyholders victimized by private conspiracies of insurers when a State has engaged in generally comprehensive regulation
             under § 2 (b).  We think the record does not support such a foreclosure. "
 935 ,25    ," ""[Even] where prices are rigidly fixed, the members of a cartel will be able to compete with each other with respect to product
             quality unless a homogeneous product is involved.  Indeed, even if the product is homogeneous there will be room for rivalry in
             such matters as promptness in filling orders and the provision of ancillary services.  An effective division of markets, by contrast,
             might substantially wash out all opportunity for rivalry."" Sullivan, supra n. 14, at 224-225."

             issue with the director of the state insurance division.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  Even if we assume that such a filing had been made,
             there is no suggestion that the State, in furtherance of its regulatory policies, authorized the concerted refusal to deal on any
             terms with St. Paul's policyholders. Although the dissenting opinion below noted ""that Rhode Island has exercised its right to regulate all material aspects of the
             business of insurance and that the actions complained of relative to withholding malpractice insurance were all part of such
             regulated business,"" 555 F.2d, at 14, this statement refers to the requirements of the proviso to § 2 (b).  The dissent did not
             argue that the agreement in question was within the contemplation of any state regulatory scheme."
 935 ,27    ," We have no occasion here to decide whether the element of state regulatory direction or authorization of the particular
             practice, absent in this case, is a factor to be considered in the definition of ""boycott"" within the meaning of § 3 (b), or whether it
             comes into play as part of a possible defense under the ""state action"" doctrine, as elaborated in Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341

 937 ,4     ," In the present case the District Court in an oral opinion held that various Rhode Island laws, including state antitrust statutes,
             made the federal antitrust laws generally inapplicable to the petitioners under § 2 (b).  That ruling was implicitly accepted by the
             Court of Appeals, and has not been questioned here.  See ante, at 540 n. 9. The legislative history in the Senate indicates that two kinds of state regulation were thought capable of suspending the federal
             antitrust laws under § 2 (b).  See 91 Cong. Rec. 1444 (1945) (remarks of Sen. O'Mahoney).  First, a State could enact its own
             antitrust laws. Senator Murdock explained that ""[insofar] as [the state laws] fail to cover the same ground covered by the
             Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, those [federal] acts become effective again"" after the moratorium. Ibid.  Second, a State could
             enact laws regulating various aspects of the business of insurance, such as rates and terms of coverage. Senator Ferguson
             explained that ""if the States were specifically to legislate upon a particular point, and that legislation were contrary to the
             Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, or the Federal Trade Commission Act, then the State law would be binding."" Id., at 1481.  See
             also id., at 1443 (remarks of Sen. McCarran and of Sen. Ferguson); id., at 1444 (remarks of Sen. White). This Court has had few occasions to consider the operation of § 2 (b).  In SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, the
             Court held that certain Arizona regulations protecting insurance company stockholders did not regulate the ""business of
             insurance"" within the meaning of § 2 (b) and thus did not pre-empt the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The case did not
             involve the antitrust proviso of § 2 (b), and hence did not decide to what extent a State must regulate the ""business of insurance""
             to pre-empt the federal antitrust laws. FTC v. National Casualty Co., 357 U.S. 560, is the only case in this Court involving that question.  There, the Court held that
             state statutes ""prohibiting unfair and deceptive insurance practices,"" id., at 562, pre-empted Federal Trade Commission
             regulations ""prohibiting respondent insurance companies from carrying on certain advertising practices found by the Commission
             to be false, misleading, and deceptive, in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act . . . ."" Id., at 561-562. Noting that no one
             had alleged that the state regulation was ""mere pretense,"" the Court rejected the FTC's argument that the state regulation was
             ""too 'inchoate' to be 'regulation' until [the State's statutory] prohibition has been crystallized into 'administrative elaboration of
             these standards and application in individual cases.'"" Id., at 564."
 937 ,5     ," In Senator Ferguson's words: ""There are certain things which a State cannot interfere with.  It cannot interfere with the application of the Sherman Act to any
             agreement to boycott, coerce, or intimidate, or an act of boycotting, coercion, or intimidation."" 91 Cong. Rec. 1443 (1945). "
 938 ,6     ," Most practices condemned by the Sherman Act can be cast as an act or agreement of ""boycott, coercion, or intimidation."" For
             example, price fixing can be seen either as a refusal to deal except at a uniform price (i. e., a boycott), or as an agreement to
             force buyers to accept an offer on the sellers' common terms (i. e., coercion).  Yet state-sanctioned price fixing immunized by § 2
             (b) was plainly not intended to fall within the § 3 (b) exception.  See 91 Cong. Rec. 1481 (1945) (remarks of Sen. Ferguson)."

             assured the Subcommittee that the Government did not intend to bring new prosecutions while Congress was considering
             legislation on the subject, but he insisted that the South-Eastern case should and would go forward because of the seriousness
             of the charges.  After quoting a portion of the Court's opinion set out in the text, supra, at 560-561, he stated: ""[That] case was not merely a price-fixing case, but involved very serious boycotting.  It involved boycotting by insurance
             companies of agents who would not belong to the association, and under the laws of the State in which the association
             operated, many of the acts alleged in the indictment would have been illegal."" Joint Hearing on S. 1362 et al. before the

             by state regulations. 91 Cong. Rec. 480 (1945).  To clarify its intent, the Senate amended S. 340 on the floor to make the
             antitrust laws expressly and fully applicable after the moratorium period.  Id., at 488."
 940 ,20    ," As the bill came out of committee, the boycott provision applied only to the section establishing a short-term moratorium. Id., at
             479.  A proposal to extend the boycott provision to the full Act was offered by Senator Murdock and accepted by Senator
             Ferguson, ibid., but was never ratified by the Senate. That the boycott exception was originally drafted only to keep the Sherman Act partially in effect during the moratorium suggests
             that the provision may have been initially intended to prevent interference with the prosecution of the defendants in South-
             Eastern Underwriters, who still faced trial following the decision of this Court.  Certainly, many Congressmen expressed their
             opposition to legislation that would free those defendants from liability.  See, e. g., 90 Cong. Rec. 6450 (1944) (remarks of Rep.
             Celler); id., at 6452 (remarks of Rep. LaFollette); Joint Hearings, supra n. 17, at 637 (remarks of Sen. Hatch).  On its face, the
             boycott provision removed any doubt about the Government's authority to continue with that prosecution.  Whatever its initial
             impetus, however, there is no indication that the provision was finally thought to be applicable only to the South-Eastern

             ] The exchange of price data and other information among competitors does not invariably have anticompetitive effects;
             indeed such practices can in certain circumstances increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less,
             competitive. For this reason, we have held that such exchanges of information do not constitute a per se violation of the
             Sherman Act. See, e. g., United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank, 422 U.S. 86, 113 (1975); United States v. Container
             Corp., 393 U.S., at 338 (Fortas, J., concurring).  A number of factors including most prominently the structure of the industry
             involved and the nature of the information exchanged are generally considered in divining the procompetitive or anticompetitive
             effects of this type of interseller communication.  See United States v. Container Corp., supra. See generally L. Sullivan, Law of
             Antitrust 265-274 (1977).  Exchanges of current price information, of course, have the greatest potential for generating
             anticompetitive effects and although not per se unlawful have consistently been held to violate the Sherman Act. See American
             Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, 257 U.S. 377 (1921); United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., 262 U.S. 371 (1923);
             United States v. Container Corp., supra."
 966 ,17    ," The possibility that those subjected to strict liability will take extraordinary care in their dealings is frequently regarded as one
             advantage of a rule of strict liability.  See J. Hall, General Principles of Criminal Law 344 (2d ed. 1960); W. LaFave & A. Scott,
             Criminal Law 222-223 (1972).  However, where the conduct proscribed is difficult to distinguish from conduct permitted and
             indeed encouraged, as in the antitrust context, the excessive caution spawned by a regime of strict liability will not necessarily
             redound to the public's benefit.  The antitrust laws differ in this regard from, for example, laws designed to insure that adulterated
             food will not be sold to consumers.  In the latter situation, excessive caution on the part of producers is entirely consistent with
             the legislative purpose.  See United States v. Park, 421 U.S. 658, 671-672 (1975). "
 967 ,18    ," Congress has recently increased the criminal penalties for violation of the Sherman Act. Individual violations are now treated
             as felonies punishable by a fine not to exceed $ 100,000, or by imprisonment for up to three years, or both.  Corporate violators
             are subject to a $ 1 million fine.  15 U. S. C. § 1 (1976 ed.).  The severity of these sanctions provides further support for our
             conclusion that the Sherman Act should not be construed as creating strict-liability crimes.  Cf.  Morissette v. United States, 342
             U.S. 246, 256 (1952); Sayre, Public Welfare Offenses, 33 Colum. L. Rev. 55, 72 (1933) (strict liability generally inappropriate
             when offense punishable by imprisonment).  Respondents here were not prosecuted under the new penalty provisions since
             they were indicted prior to the December 21, 1974, effective date for the increased sanctions."
 967 ,19    ," An accommodation of the civil and criminal provisions of the Act similar to that which we approve here was suggested by
             Senator Sherman in response to Senator George's argument during floor debate that the Act was primarily a penal statute to be
             construed narrowly in accord with traditional maxims: ""The first section, being a remedial statute, would be construed liberally with a view to promote its object.  It defines a civil
             remedy, and the courts will construe it liberally . . . . ""In providing a remedy the intention of the combination is immaterial. . . . ""The third section is a criminal statute, which would be construed strictly and is difficult to be enforced.  In the present state of
             the law it is impossible to describe, in precise language, the nature and limits of the offense in terms specific enough for an
             indictment."" 21 Cong. Rec. 2456 (1890). Although the bill being debated by Senators George and Sherman differed in form from the Act as ultimately passed, the
             colloquy between them indicates that Congress was fully aware of the traditional distinctions between the elements of civil and
             criminal offenses and apparently did not intend to do away with them in the Act."

             ] In a conspiracy, two different types of intent are generally required -- the basic intent to agree, which is necessary to
             establish the existence of the conspiracy, and the more traditional intent to effectuate the object of the conspiracy. See W.
             LaFave & A. Scott, Criminal Law 464-465 (1972).  Our discussion here focuses only on the second type of intent. "
 968 ,21    ," In so holding, we do not mean to suggest that conduct undertaken with the purpose of producing anticompetitive effects would
             not also support criminal liability, even if such effects did not come to pass.  Cf.  United States v. Griffith, 334 U.S. 100, 105
             (1948). We hold only that this elevated standard of intent need not be established in cases where anticompetitive effects have
             been demonstrated; instead, proof that the defendant's conduct was undertaken with knowledge of its probable consequences
             will satisfy the Government's burden. "
 969 ,22    ," Respondents contend that ""prior to the trial of this case, no court had ever held that a mere exchange of information which had
             a stabilizing effect on prices violated the Sherman Act, regardless of the purpose for the exchange."" Joint Brief for Respondents
             50.  Retroactive application of ""this judicially expanded definition of the crime"" would, the argument continues, contravene the
             ""principles of fair notice embodied in the Due Process Clause."" Ibid.  While we have rejected on other grounds the ""effects only""
             test in the context of criminal proceedings, we do not agree with respondents that the prior case law dealing with the exchange
             of price information required proof of a purpose to restrain competition in order to make out a Sherman Act violation. Certainly our decision in United States v. Container Corp., 393 U.S. 333 (1969), is fairly read as indicating that proof of an
             anticompetitive effect is a sufficient predicate for liability.  In that case, liability followed from proof that ""the exchange of price
             information has had an anticompetitive effect in the industry,"" id., at 337, and no suggestion was made that proof of a purpose to
             restrain trade or competition was also required.  Thus, at least in the post-Container period, which comprises almost the entire
             time period at issue here, respondents' claimed lack of notice cannot be credited. Nor are the prior cases treating exchanges of information among competitors more favorable to respondents' position.  See
             American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, 257 U.S., at 400 (""[Any] concerted action . . . to cause, or which in fact does
             cause, . . . restraint of competition . . . is unlawful""); United States v. American Linseed Oil Co., 262 U.S. 371, 389 (1923) (""[A]
             necessary tendency . . . to suppress competition . . . [is] unlawful""); Maple Flooring Mfrs. Assn. v. United States, 268 U.S. 563,
             585 (1925) (purpose to restrain trade or conduct which ""had resulted, or would necessarily result, in tending arbitrarily to lessen
             production or increase prices"" sufficient for liability).  While in Cement Mfrs. Protective Assn. v. United States, 268 U.S. 588
             (1925), an exception from Sherman Act liability was recognized for conduct intended to prevent fraud, we do not read that case
             as repudiating the rule set out in prior cases; instead Cement highlighted a narrow limitation on the application of the general
             rule that either purpose or effect will support liability. We do not understand respondents to be making the related claim that they relied on the several lower court cases exempting
             interseller verification for purposes of complying with the Robinson-Patman Act from scrutiny under the Sherman Act, see infra,
             at 452-453, and thus should not be penalized if those decisions turn out to have been incorrect.  Whatever the merits of such an
             argument, respondents would appear unable to invoke it since the initiation of their verification practices antedated those lower
             court decisions."

             probable effect of fixing or stabilizing prices.  Since we hold knowledge of the probable consequences of conduct to be the
             requisite mental state in a criminal prosecution like the instant one where an effect on prices is also alleged, a defendant's
             purpose in engaging in the proscribed conduct will not insulate him from liability unless it is deemed of sufficient merit to justify a
             general exception to the Sherman Act's proscriptions.  Cf. Cement Mfrs. Protective Assn. v. United States, supra."
 969 ,24    ," Respondents maintain that their verification practices not only were for the purpose of complying with the Robinson-Patman

 970 ,25    ," Although the Belliston court did not specifically refer to Cement's ""controlling circumstance"" exception, it adopted the rationale

             requiring, interseller verification when the veracity of the buyer was in doubt.  As we read that case, however, it simply reaffirms
             the teaching of Staley, and does not compel the further conclusion that only interseller verification will satisfy the good-faith

             concrete fact situations.  We note also that our conclusions regarding the proper interpretation of § 2 (f), see n. 30, supra, may

             somewhat imperfect matching between competing offers actually made and those allowed to be met.  Unless this requirement is
             to be abandoned, it seems clear that inadequate information will, in a limited number of cases, deny the defense to some who, if
             all the facts had been known, would have been entitled to invoke it.  For reasons already discussed, interseller verification does
             not provide a satisfactory solution to this seemingly inevitable problem of inadequate information.  Moreover, § 2 (b) affords only
             a defense to liability and not an affirmative right under the Act.  While sellers are, of course, entitled to take advantage of the
             defense when they can satisfy its requirements, efforts to increase its availability at the expense of broader, affirmative antitrust

             U.S. 61, and that A&P had not then satisfied its burden of showing that the prices were cost justified, or that it did not know that
             they were not. The Commission upheld the Administrative Law Judge's dismissal of Count III of the complaint."
 993 ,6     ," The Court of Appeals, like the Commission, relied on Kroger Co. v. FTC, 438 F.2d 1372 (CA6), for the proposition that a buyer
             can be liable under § 2 (f) of the Act even if the seller has a meeting-competition defense.  The Kroger case involved a buyer
             who had made deliberate misrepresentations to a seller in order to induce price concessions.  While the Court of Appeals in this
             case did not find that A&P had made any affirmative misrepresentations, it viewed the distinction between a ""lying buyer"" and a

             purchased upon terms not accorded to all purchasers on proportionally equal terms."" 15 U. S. C. § 13 (e)."
 995 ,12    ," Contrary to the respondent's suggestion, this interpretation of § 2 (f) is in no way inconsistent with congressional intent.  ""[The]
             buyer whom Congress in the main sought to reach was the one who, knowing full well that there was little likelihood of a defense
             for the seller, nevertheless proceeded to exert pressure for lower prices."" Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. FTC, 346 U.S.,
             at 79. Here, by contrast, we conclude that a buyer is not liable if the seller does have a defense under § 2 (b)."

             at 74. "
 996 ,14    ," A duty of affirmative disclosure might also be difficult to enforce.  In cases where a seller offers differing quantities or a
             different quality product, or offers to serve the buyer in a different manner, it might be difficult for the buyer to determine when
             disclosure is required."
 996 ,15    ," In Kroger Co. v. FTC, 438 F.2d 1372, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that a buyer who induced price
             concessions by a seller by making deliberate misrepresentations could be liable under § 2 (f) even if the seller has a meeting-
             competition defense. This case does not involve a ""lying buyer"" situation.  The complaint issued by the FTC alleged that ""A&P accepted the said offer
             of Borden with knowledge that Borden had granted a substantially lower price than that offered by the only other competitive
             bidder and without notifying Borden of this fact."" The complaint did not allege that Borden's second bid was induced by any
             misrepresentation. The Court of Appeals recognized that the Kroger case involved a ""lying buyer,"" but stated that there was no
             meaningful distinction between the situation where ""the buyer lies or merely keeps quiet about the nature of the competing bid.""
             557 F.2d 971, 983. Despite this background, the respondent argues that A&P did engage in misrepresentations and therefore can be found liable as
             a ""lying buyer"" under the rationale of the Kroger case.  The misrepresentation relied upon by the respondent is a statement
             allegedly made by a representative of A&P to Borden after Borden made its second bid which would have resulted in annual
             savings to A&P of $ 820,000.  The A&P representative allegedly told Borden to ""sharpen your pencil a little bit because you are
             not quite there."" But the Commission itself referred to this comment only to note its irrelevance, and neither the Commission nor "
 997 ,      ," the Court of Appeals mentioned it in considering the § 2 (f) charge against A&P.  This is quite understandable, since the
             comment was allegedly made after Borden made its second bid and therefore cannot be said to have induced the bid as in the
             Kroger case. Because A&P was not a ""lying buyer,"" we need not decide whether such a buyer could be liable under § 2 (f) even if the seller
             has a meeting-competition defense."
 997 ,16    ," Recognition of the right of a seller to meet a lower competitive price in good faith may be the primary means of reconciling the
             Robinson-Patman Act with the more general purposes of the antitrust laws of encouraging competition between sellers. As the
             Court stated in Standard Oil Co. v. FTC, 340 U.S., at 249: ""We need not now reconcile, in its entirety, the economic theory which underlies the Robinson-Patman Act with that of the
             Sherman and Clayton Acts.  It is enough to say that Congress did not seek by the Robinson-Patman Act either to abolish
             competition or so radically to curtail it that a seller would have no substantial right of self-defense against a price raid by a
             competitor."" "
 998 ,17    ," The facts of this case are thus readily distinguishable from Corn Products Co. v. FTC, 324 U.S. 726, and FTC v. A. E. Staley
             Mfg. Co., 324 U.S. 746, in both of which the Court held that a seller had failed to establish a meeting-competition defense.  In
             the Corn Products case, the only evidence to rebut the prima facie case of price discrimination was testimony by witnesses who
             had no personal knowledge of the transactions in question.  Similarly, in the Staley Mfg. Co. case, unsupported testimony from
             informants of uncertain character and reliability was insufficient to establish the defense.  In the present case, by contrast, the
             source of the information was a person whose reliability was not questioned and who had personal knowledge of the competing
             bid. Moreover, Borden attempted to investigate by asking A&P for more information about the competing bid. Finally, Borden
             was faced with a credible threat of a termination of purchases by A&P if it did not make a second offer.  All of these factors serve
             to show that Borden did have a valid meeting-competition defense.  See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S.,
             at 454."
 998 ,18    ," Because we hold that the petitioner is not liable under § 2 (f), we do not reach the question whether Borden might also have

             out that sustained enforcement of § 2 (f) . . . will serve to bolster the credibility of buyers' representations and render reliance
             thereon by sellers a more reasonable and secure predicate for a finding of good faith under § 2 (b)."" (Citation omitted.) But if
             neither a buyer nor a seller can be liable when the seller relies in good faith on the buyer's misrepresentations, then enforcement
             of § 2 (f) will not ""bolster the credibility"" of buyers. Thus, the derivative standard of liability adopted by the Court today is
             inconsistent with the premise underlying the Court's suggestion in United States Gypsum, see Note, The Supreme Court, 1977
             Term, 92 Harv. L. Rev. 57, 288, 291-294 (1978), and it eliminates one means of reassuring sellers that they may rely on buyer
             representations."
1000 ,3     ," Given this preface to Automatic Canteen, language in that opinion provides little support for the Court's adoption today of a
             derivative standard with respect to the buyer's meeting-competition defense.  Moreover, to the extent the majority believes its
             resort to literal construction of § 2 (f) forecloses further inquiry, it ignores the broader teaching of Automatic Canteen.  That case
             adopted a common-sense approach for interpreting the often ambiguous Robinson-Patman Act, tempering a ""merely literal
             reading of the language"" with considerations of ""fairness and convenience"" when necessary to achieve Congress' purpose.  346
             U.S., at 79, and n. 23. On that basis, Automatic Canteen allocated to the Commission the burden of production regarding a
             buyer's cost-justification defense, even though the Commission does not bear that burden in a proceeding against a seller. Id., at
             75-76; FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 44-45 (1948). Indeed, the Court's interpretation of § 2 (f) today, which places buyers
             in the litigating position of their sellers, may also be incompatible with Automatic Canteen's specific holding on the burden of
             production. "
1001 ,4     ," Because the Court reverses the judgment without remanding for further consideration and does not expressly reach the merits
             of the cost-justification issue raised by A&P, ante, at 85 n. 18, I need not address that issue either."
1001 ,5     ," Considering the recent admonition in United States Gypsum, supra, at 456 n. 31, that ""[the] case-by-case interpretation and
             elaboration of the § 2 (b) defense is properly left to the other federal courts and the FTC in the context of concrete fact

             the burden of persuasion, I do not understand Part IV of its opinion as purporting to modify in any sense what was said last Term
             in United States Gypsum about the scope of the meeting-competition defense for sellers."
1001 ,6     ," The Court's opinion creates the impression that Borden submitted only two proposals, ante, at 81-82, n. 15, 83-84.  In fact, A&P
             induced Borden to make a third proposal, even though the second was already more favorable than Bowman's. When Borden initially responded to Bowman's bid, the A&P representative rejected Borden's offer on the ground that it included
             milk sold in glass gallon containers, whereas other bidders supposedly had not included that item.  Actually, Bowman's bid had
             included glass gallons and A&P had subsequently decided against using glass containers.  87 F. T. C. 962, 979 (1976); App.
             73a-74a, 116a-118a, 257a-260a, 774a-775a.  The effect of forcing Borden to delete milk sold in glass gallons from the proposal
             without raising the overall bid, was to increase the savings to A&P on other products still covered because part of the promised
             savings had been derived from the sale of the cheaper glass gallons. See 87 F. T. C., at 979-980. In addition, while Borden was
             preparing a third proposal to reflect the deletion, A&P suggested that Borden make further price reductions, saying ""'sharpen
             your pencil a little bit because you are not quite there.'"" App. 118a.  As a result, Borden reduced its prices still further to yield
             additional savings of approximately $ 5,000 to $ 8,000.  The bid finally accepted by A&P incorporated these price reductions as
             well as those attributable to the deletion of glass gallons. See id., at 117a-118a, 123a-124a, 141a-142a. "

             insurance companies was threatened after that case, because of its holding that insurance companies are in interstate
             commerce.  The McCarran-Ferguson Act operates to assure that the States are free to regulate insurance companies without "
1016 ,      ," fear of Commerce Clause attack.  The question in the present case, however, is one under the quite different secondary purpose
             of the McCarran-Ferguson Act -- to give insurance companies only a limited exemption from the antitrust laws. The repeated insistence in the dissenting opinion that the McCarran-Ferguson Act should be read as protecting the right of the

             Pharmacy Agreements exempt from attack under the Commerce Clause.  It is the quite different question whether the Pharmacy
             Agreements are exempt from the antitrust laws. In short, the McCarran-Ferguson Act freed the States to continue to regulate and tax the business of insurance companies, in
             spite of the Commerce Clause.  It did not, however, exempt the business of insurance companies from the antitrust laws. It

             interpreted ""broadly."" Precisely the opposite is true. At the time Congress was considering one of the early versions of the Act, H. R. 3270, 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943), which
             would have wholly exempted from the antitrust laws ""the business of insurance or . . . acts in the conduct of that business,"" an
             amendment was introduced which would have exempted specific activities.  90 Cong. Rec. 6561 (1944).  The proponent of the
             amendment, Representative Anderson, explained that its purpose was to provide broader protection than provided by H. R.
             3270: ""But I say to this House that some legislation should be passed which asserts the right of the States to control the
             questions of risks, rates, premiums, commissions, policies, investments, reinsurance, capital requirements, and items of that
             nature.  It is for that purpose I have insisted upon bringing this at this time to the attention of the House.  If you pass H. R. 3270
             as it now stands and go back home and any of your insurance friends ask you what you did to safeguard the protection of "
1018 ,      ," insurance by the State, you must answer them in all truth that all you did was to pass a bill which provided antitrust protection for
             companies now under indictment."" The amendment was defeated.  90 Cong. Rec. 6562 (1944). Thus, Congress rejected an amendment which exempted specific activities of insurance companies (not including anything
             remotely resembling the Pharmacy Agreements in this case) which was perceived to be broader than H. R. 3270.  Since H. R.
             3270 was itself broader than the Act as eventually enacted, it necessarily follows that the exemption of the Act is narrower than
             the bills which would have exempted specific practices.  This pattern is consistent with the entire legislative history of the
             McCarran-Ferguson Act, which was characterized by a continual narrowing of the original blanket exemption."
1018 ,30    ," The dissenting opinion states that the ""compelling explanation"" for the lack of discussion of provider agreements in the
             legislative history was the congressional concern about fire insurance companies.  Post, at 234, n. 2.  However, input from all
             types of insurance companies was sought through the Insurance Commissioners of the various States ""because the
             Commissioners were aware of the chaotic condition which exists at the present time."" 91 Cong. Rec. 484 (1945) (remarks of
             Sen. Ferguson).  Moreover, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, whose concern was surely not limited to fire
             insurance, was certainly aware of provider agreements since it drafted model state enabling legislation to govern service-benefit
             health plans.  But this Association, which played a major role in the drafting of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, did not include
             provider agreements in its proposed bill exempting specific practices of insurance companies from the scope of the antitrust
             laws. 90 Cong. Rec. A4406 (1944).  Given this background, the failure of Congress to mention provider agreements, or anything
             in any way resembling them, suggests that Congress did not intend that provider agreements were to be exempt."
1018 ,31    ," The dissenting opinion states that the National Securities case recognized that the legislative history of the Act ""sheds little
             light"" on the meaning of the ""business of insurance."" Post, at 234.  In National Securities, however, the Court went on to state
             that the legislative history indicated that ""Congress was mainly concerned with the relationship between insurance ratemaking
             and the antitrust laws, and with the power of the States to tax insurance companies."" 393 U.S., at 458-459."
1018 ,32    ," One question not resolved by this legislative history is which of the various practices alleged in the South-Eastern
             Underwriters indictment Congress intended to be covered by the phrase ""business of insurance."" The indictment in that case
             had charged, for example, that the defendants had fixed their agents' commissions as well as premium rates.  It is clear from the
             legislative history that the fixing of rates is the ""business of insurance."" The same conclusion does not so clearly emerge with
             respect to the fixing of agents' commissions. The bills introduced before the South-Eastern Underwriters decision which would have totally exempted the insurance industry
             from the antitrust laws specifically included agreements regarding agents' commissions as an exempt practice.  E. g., H. R.
             4444, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. (1944).  Similarly, the bill proposed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners two "
1019 ,      ," months after the South-Eastern Underwriters case was decided would have also exempted agents' commissions.  90 Cong.
             Rec. A4406 (1944).  The subsequent bill that followed the approach of the NAIC and exempted specific activities, however, was
             limited to traditional underwriting activities and made no mention of agreements with insurance agents: § 4 (b).  ""On and after March 1, 1946, the provisions of said Sherman Act shall not apply to any agreement or concerted or
             cooperative action between two or more insurance companies for making, establishing, or using rates for insurance, rating
             methods, premiums, insurance policy or bond forms, or underwriting rules . . . ."" S. 12, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945). One inference that can be drawn from this pattern is that Congress was aware of the existence of agreements regarding agents'
             commissions, and chose not to include them within the exemption for the ""business of insurance."" On the other hand, the fact
             that the indictment in South-Eastern Underwriters had included a charge that insurance companies did boycott agents who
             insisted on selling other lines of insurance, together with the fact that § 3 (b) presumably removes an exemption that, but for its
             absence, would be conferred by § 2, suggests that the ""business of insurance"" may have been intended to include dealings
             within the insurance industry between insurers and agents. Even if it be assumed, however, that transactions between an insurer and its agents, including independent agents, are the
             ""business of insurance,"" it still does not follow that the Pharmacy Agreements also fall within the definition.  Transactions
             between an insurer and an agent, unlike the Pharmacy Agreements, are wholly intra-industry; an insurance agent sells
             insurance while a pharmacy sells goods and services.  Moreover, there are historical reasons why the Pharmacy Agreements
             should not be considered the ""business of insurance,"" whatever may be the status of agreements between an insurer and its
             agents.  See Part III-D, infra."

             enabling statutes regarded the plans as insurance.  These statutes typically authorized the plans to operate but did not specify
             whether or not they were insurance.  E. g., 1935 Ill. Laws, p. 621 (""An Act to provide for the Incorporation and Regulation of
             nonprofit Hospital Service Corporations""); 1939 Mich. Pub. Acts No. 109 (""An Act to provide for and to regulate the incorporation

             for the incorporation of certain persons as Group Hospitalization, Inc."").  This latter statute enacted by Congress also provided in
             § 7: ""This corporation shall not be subject to the provisions of statutes regulating the business of insurance in the District of
             Columbia, but shall be exempt therefrom unless specifically designated therein."" The Senate Report stated: ""This bill does not

             District of Columbia had been construed not to be engaged in the business of insurance. Group Health Assn. v. Moor, 24
             F.Supp. 445 (DC 1938). "
1020 ,      ," Indeed, courts have continued to hold that Blue Shield plans are not insurance even in States that have enacted enabling
             statutes.  E. g., Michigan Hospital Service v. Sharpe, supra.  In that case, the court specifically rejected the proposition that the
             existence of the enabling statute was sufficient to demonstrate that the plan was insurance. But even if certain aspects of a Blue Shield plan are the ""business of insurance,"" the Pharmacy Agreements in this case are not
             -- for all the reasons set out in this opinion.  It is to be emphasized that the question whether provider agreements like the
             Pharmacy Agreements in this case, or other aspects of insurance companies, were in 1945 or are now regulated by state law is
             irrelevant to the issue before the Court in the present case.  See n. 38, infra."
1020 ,35    ," Despite the fact that courts did not view plans like Blue Cross and Blue Shield as insurance at the time of the passage of the
             McCarran-Ferguson Act, the petitioners argue that Attorney General Biddle's remarks when testifying in the Joint Hearing before
             the Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1362, H. R. 3269, and H. R. 3270, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., 41-42
             (1943), indicate a congressional understanding that such plans were indeed insurance. The thrust of Attorney General Biddle's remarks was that this Court's decision in American Medical Assn. v. United States, 317
             U.S. 519, justified the indictment in the South-Eastern Underwriters case.  In the AMA case, the Court had held that a health-
             maintenance organization was engaged in ""trade"" within the meaning of the Sherman Act. Based on this decision, Attorney
             General Biddle expressed the view that the plan was insurance and that therefore the Court had already held that insurance was
             commerce.  Thus, he argued that the indictment in South-Eastern Underwriters was proper. It seems clear, however, why this testimony does not demonstrate that Congress believed that Blue Cross or Blue Shield plans
             are insurance.  First, the statement of the Attorney General that the plan in the AMA case was insurance was not accepted by
             Congress.  Senator Bailey rejected the characterization, pointing out that the Court had not referred to the plan as insurance.  To
             Senator Bailey, the plan was not insurance but a ""group cooperative movement."" (Indeed, the precise plan at issue was held not
             to be insurance in Jordan v. Group Health Assn., 71 App. D. C. 38, 107 F.2d 239 (1939).) But even if it can nonetheless be
             inferred that some Members of Congress may have agreed with the Attorney General that prepaid health plans are insurance,
             his testimony did not remotely suggest that agreements between an insurer and a third party fixing the cost at which goods and
             services will be purchased is also insurance. "

             1606, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, pp. 172-176 (1946), does not establish that Congress shared this view, let alone that provider

1021 ,37    ," This is not to say that the contracts offered by Blue Shield to its policyholders, as distinguished from its provider agreements
             with participating pharmacies, may not be the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of the Act."
1021 ,38    ," This conclusion is in no way affected by the existence of state enabling statutes regulating advance-payment medical-benefits
             plans at the time the McCarran-Ferguson Act was enacted.  E. g., 1937 Cal. Stats., ch. 882, as amended by 1941 Cal. Stats.,
             ch. 311; 1939 Conn. Pub. Acts, ch. 150; 1935 Ill. Laws, p. 621; 1936 Miss. Gen. Laws, ch. 177; 1939 Mich. Pub. Acts, No. 109;
             1938 N. J. Laws, ch. 719.  These statutes generally provided that the plans were not insurance.  See supra, at 226-227, and n.
             34.  Even if it is assumed that some state legislatures believed that these plans are insurance, however, it still does not follow
             that provider agreements like the Pharmacy Agreements in this case were considered by Congress to be the ""business of
             insurance."" Many aspects of insurance companies are regulated by state law, but are not the ""business of insurance."" Similarly, the enabling
             statutes in existence at the time the Act was enacted typically regulated such diverse aspects of the plans as the composition of
             their boards of directors, when their books and records could be inspected, how they could invest their funds, when they could
             liquidate or merge, as well as how they could purchase goods and services by entering into provider agreements. Provider agreements are no more the ""business of insurance"" because they were regulated by state law at the time of the
             McCarran-Ferguson Act than are these other facets of the plans which were similarly regulated. If Congress had exempted the
             ""business of insurance companies,"" then these aspects of the plans which are not themselves insurance as that term is
             commonly understood would nevertheless be arguably exempt. But since Congress explicitly rejected this approach, they are
             not within the exemption even though they are the subject of state regulation. This Court has implicitly recognized that state regulation of a practice of an insurance company does not mean that the practice
             is the ""business of insurance"" within the meaning of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  In both cases, SEC v. Variable Annuity Life
             Ins. Co., 359 U.S. 65, and SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S. 453, the challenged conduct was regulated by the State
             Insurance Commissioner, but this Court held that the practices were not the ""business of insurance."" "

1022 ,40    ," There is no principled basis upon which a line could rationally be drawn that would extend the McCarran-Ferguson Act

             even such provider agreements are the ""business of insurance"" is to ignore the language and purpose of the Act not to exempt
             the insurance industry as such from the antitrust laws. Moreover, exempting provider agreements from the antitrust laws would be likely in at least some cases to have serious
             anticompetitive consequences.  Recent studies have concluded that physicians and other health-care providers typically
             dominate the boards of directors of Blue Shield plans.  Thus, there is little incentive on the part of Blue Shield to minimize costs,
             since it is in the interest of the providers to set fee schedules at the highest possible level.  This domination of Blue Shield by
             providers is said to have resulted in rapid escalation of health-care costs to the detriment of consumers generally.  See

1023 ,2     ," The Court argues that the silence with respect to agreements between insurers and third parties, coupled with the fact that
             Congressmen did discuss horizontal agreements between insurance companies, establishes by negative inference that third-
             party agreements were not considered ""the business of insurance."" There is, however, a compelling explanation for the lack of
             mention of provider agreements.  As the Court has noted in several cases, see, e. g., SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U.S.
             453, 459 (1969); St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Barry, 438 U.S. 531, 538-539 (1978), the McCarran-Ferguson Act was a
             reaction to the decision in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 533 (1944). See infra, at 236-237.  That
             case involved an organization of fire insurance companies, and much of the congressional discussion accordingly concerned
             alleged abuses by and regulation of such companies.  See, e. g., 91 Cong. Rec. 1091-1092, 1479 (1945); 90 Cong. Rec. 6449-
             6455, 6527 (1944).  Indeed, health insurers did not even participate in the hearings on the Act.  See Joint Hearing before the
             Subcommittees of the Committees on the Judiciary on S. 1362 et al., 78th Cong., 1st Sess. (1943).  Since fire insurers paid their
             policyholders cash indemnities, these companies had no reason to contract with third parties for the provision of goods or
             services.  That fact fully explains the absence of discussion of such contracts in the congressional debates.  Such absence no
             more indicates a congressional intent to exclude provider agreements from the ""business of insurance"" than does the absence
             of any mention of health insurance companies indicate a congressional intent arbitrarily to exclude all health insurance from the
             ""business of insurance."" "
1024 ,3     ," S. 12, 79th Cong., 1st Sess. (1945), would have specified ""any agreement or concerted or cooperative action between two or more insurance companies for making, establishing, or using
             rates for insurance, rating methods, premiums, insurance policy or bond forms, or underwriting rules."" (Emphasis added.) See also § 4 (b) of a draft bill of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, 90 Cong. Rec. A4406 (1944).  A
             significant Senate floor debate with regard to such limiting bills is the following: ""MR. PEPPER.  Would it not be better that those agreements, if there are such that are legitimatized, be identified in the statute? ""MR. O'MAHONEY.  I quite agree with the Senator, and I endeavored to the very best of my ability to induce the committees of
             Congress to write into the law specific exemptions from the antitrust law, but I was unable to prevail in the Committee on the
             Judiciary and I was unable to prevail on the floor of the Senate."" 91 Cong. Rec. 1444 (1945). The Court challenges the conclusion that Congress intended to phrase the exemption broadly by referring to the legislative
             history of one obscure amendment to an early House version of the Act.  Ante, at 222-223, n. 29.  Closer examination of the
             short debate surrounding that amendment reveals only the Representatives' repeated expressions of their confusion over what
             the amendment meant.  See 90 Cong. Rec. 6562 (1944) (remarks of Reps. Summers, Hobbs, and Fernandez)."
1024 ,4     ," There can be no quarrel with the Court's statement, ante, at 220, and n. 24, that the McCarran-Ferguson Act was not intended
             to restore the law, in all respects, to what it had been before South-Eastern Underwriters.  But the principal differences between
             pre-South-Eastern and post-McCarran-Ferguson law are irrelevant for purposes of this case, and do not detract from the Court's
             oft-repeated statement that the purpose of the Act was to preserve state regulatory schemes as they existed before South-
             Eastern Underwriters. "
1025 ,      ," Before South-Eastern, insurance companies might boycott, coerce, and intimidate without violating federal antitrust statutes
             since insurance was not considered ""commerce"" and hence was beyond the reach of federal law.  For the same reason, even
             unregulated insurance transactions were free from antitrust attack.  Finally, Congress, because of the ""commerce"" problem,
             could not otherwise regulate insurance.  None of these elements survived the decision in South-Eastern, and none was revived
             by McCarran-Ferguson.  These differences between pre-South-Eastern and post-McCarran-Ferguson law were what Senator
             Ferguson had in mind when he answered ""no"" to Senator McKellar's question, cited by the Court, ante, at 220 n. 24, asking
             whether the effect of the Act was to re-establish the law as it stood prior to South-Eastern.  This is revealed by quotation of
             Senator Ferguson's full answer to Senator McKellar. ""MR. FERGUSON.  No.  I would say that subsection (b), at the bottom of page 2, would allow the provisions of the Sherman Act
             to apply to all agreements or acts of boycott, coercion, or intimidation, and subsection 4 (a) would suspend the application of the
             provisions of the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act, insofar as States may regulate and tax such companies, until certain dates
             or until Congress may act in the meantime in respect to what Congress thinks should be done with the business of insurance.""
             91 Cong. Rec. 478 (1945). These discrete differences between pre-South-Eastern and post-McCarran-Ferguson law are not applicable here, and do not
             conflict with the holdings of this Court's prior opinions that, with respect to state-regulated insurance practices not constituting
             boycotts, McCarran-Ferguson was intended to preserve pre-existing state insurance regulation. This analysis also explains, and renders irrelevant for this case, Congress' rejection of the ""total"" exemption bills cited by the
             Court, ante, at 218-219, and n. 21.  Those bills, unlike the one that passed, would have exempted boycotts and unregulated
             transactions.  It was this aspect of the ""total"" exemption bills to which the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
             objected.  See 90 Cong. Rec. 8482 (1944).  These bills were rejected not because of a decision to narrow the scope of the
             nonboycott activities to be exempted, but because Congress determined that the business of insurance should be exempted
             only where regulated by the States, rather than unconditionally. "

1026 ,9     ," Debate arose during this period as to whether service-benefit plans were technically insurance.  See ante, at 225-230.  Most
             state insurance commissioners ruled during the 1930's that the plans constituted insurance, and therefore had to meet the
             capital stock, reserve, and assessment requirements applicable to the commercial stock and mutual insurance companies which
             offered cash indemnity policies.  Eilers 101.  In addition, this meant that the plans were subject to special state taxation.  Ibid. "
1027 ,      ," Such holdings limited the feasibility of the plans at a time when they were widely perceived as being socially beneficial.
             Moreover, it was argued that these rulings were inappropriate to service-benefit plans, which were generally ""nonprofit,"" and
             often included guarantees by hospitals to provide services regardless of the financial state of the insurer -- potentially an
             adequate substitute for the cash reserves needed by indemnity plans.  Id., at 135-136, 239. Some courts, and even some Blue Cross-type organizations, attempted to surmount these barriers to effectuation of plans
             deemed to be in the public interest by arguing that the plans were not technically ""insurance"" subject to the jurisdiction of state
             insurance commissioners, and hence were not bound by the requirements of the stock and mutual insurance companies.  See,
             e. g., Jordan v. Group Health Assn., 71 App. D. C. 38, 107 F.2d 239 (1939). But see Cleveland Hospital Service Assn. v.
             Ebright, 142 Ohio St. 51, 49 N. E. 2d 929 (1943) (hospital service plans are insurance); McCarty v. King County Medical Service
             Corp., 26 Wash. 2d 660, 175 P. 2d 653 (1946) (same).  But contemporary commentators questioned the soundness of such
             views and argued that the plans should be treated as insurance, although as a special kind not subject to the traditional
             requirements.  See, e. g., Note, The Legal Problems of Group Health, 52 Harv. L. Rev. 809, 815 (1939); Comment, Group
             Health Plans: Some Legal and Economic Aspects, 53 Yale L. J. 162, 172 (1943). The 35 state enabling Acts governing service-
             benefit health plans reflected the States' agreement that the plans were ""a special type of insurance"" differing from the stock and
             mutual companies.  Rorem II, p. 534; Sinai 48.  This is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the vast majority of the state
             statutes, while relieving the plans of ""other"" insurance law requirements (primarily the reserve requirements and special
             insurance taxes), subjected their activities to the control of the state insurance commissioner.  The 1939 New Mexico Statute, for
             example, amended the State's Insurance Code by adding a new section entitled ""Non-Profit Hospital Service Plans."" The
             amendment subjected the plans, and in particular both their premiums and rates of payment to hospitals, to the approval of the
             Superintendent of Insurance, while exempting them from ""all other provisions of the insurance law."" 1939 N. M. Laws, ch. 66
             (emphasis added).  This approach was in accord with the commonly held view that such plans were forms of ""insurance,"" as
             reflected by the statements of numerous Congressmen in the congressional hearings on the proposed National Health Program,
             see infra, at 243.  And everyday meaning, rather than some technical term of art, is what Congress intended by its use of the
             word ""insurance"" in the McCarran-Ferguson Act."

             payment, ibid.; requiring that the contracts contain guarantees of services by the hospitals to policyholders despite financial
             difficulties of the insurer, Rorem I, p. 67; or even limiting the kind of hospitals with which contracts could be made, id., at 68. "
1029 ,15    ," Indeed, unions negotiating for drug-coverage plans have requested that the plans include contractual arrangements with
             pharmacies, in order to guarantee that the policy's promises are kept.  See Brief for Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. as
             Amicus Curiae 10-11. It might be argued that the drug-benefits policy could operate successfully without any agreement between Blue Shield and the
             pharmacies. The consumer could simply pay the pharmacist his full price, whereupon he would normally receive the drugs
             without hesitation.  Blue Shield could then reimburse the policyholder for the full price minus the $ 2 deductible.  This would not,
             however, be the policy bargained for in this case.  That policy guarantees provision of drugs upon a minimal $ 2 payment,
             without requiring the policyholder to advance the full price when the contingency of illness occurs -- a time when he may not be
             able to afford the out-of-pocket payment.  Moreover, such cash-reimbursement plans almost inevitably include payment ceilings,
             again distinguishing them from the full-coverage service plan bargained for in this case.  See discussion, infra, at 252, and n. 20."

             The key to Variable Annuity is that neither the agreement at issue nor any with which it was involved effectuated a transference
             of risk.  Id., at 71. That is not the case here, where the policyholder has successfully transferred his risk by trading his premium

             general rule has no application here unless one assumes what the respondents need to prove -- that the Pharmacy Agreements
             are outside the scope of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.  Reference to the cases under the Capper-Volstead Act is not helpful on
             the matter, as that Act limits its exemption to those who are ""engaged in the production of agricultural products as farmers,
             planters, ranchmen, dairymen, nut or fruit growers."" 42 Stat. 388, 7 U. S. C. § 291 (emphasis added).  As a result, this Court has
             held that agreements involving nonfarmers are not exempt. National Broiler Marketing Assn. v. United States, 436 U.S. 816
             (1978). As the Court emphasizes, however, the McCarran-Ferguson Act exemption was not written in terms of ""insurance
             companies,"" but extends instead to the ""business of insurance."" Hence, the participation of pharmacies does not automatically
             vitiate the exemption, as does the participation of nonfarmers in the Capper-Volstead ""analogy."" Nor is reference to the labor exemption helpful to the Court.  The quotation from Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657,
             665-666 (1965), cited by the Court, ante, at 232 n. 39, is in complete accord with what I would conclude here: ""[A] union [read
             'insurer'] may make wage [pharmacy] agreements with a multi-employer bargaining unit [a group of pharmacies] . . . .  But . . .
             [one] group of employers [pharmacies] may not conspire to eliminate competitors from the industry and the union [insurer] is
             liable with the employers [pharmacies] if it becomes a party to the conspiracy."" The labor exemption is a particularly poor
             analogy for the Court to stress because in yet another footnote, Pennington expressly approved a set of transactions virtually
             identical to those complained of in this case.  Here, respondents contend that Blue Shield adopted a uniform fee policy, even
             though it may have suspected that some pharmacies would not be able to compete if required to limit their markup to that
             demanded by Blue Shield.  There was, however, no additional evidence of a conspiracy among the participating pharmacies to
             drive out their less able brethren, which Blue Shield then joined.  This was precisely the set of circumstances held by the
             Pennington Court to be within the scope of the exemption: ""Unilaterally, and without agreement with any employer group to do so, a union may adopt a uniform wage policy and seek
             vigorously to implement it even though it may suspect that some employers cannot effectively compete if they are required to
             pay the wage scale demanded by the union.  The union need not gear its wage demands to wages which the weakest units in
             the industry can afford to pay.  Such union conduct is not alone sufficient evidence to maintain a union-employer conspiracy
             charge under the Sherman Act. There must be additional direct or indirect evidence of the conspiracy."" 381 U.S., at 665 n. 2. "
1033 ,      ," Thus, the approach taken by the Court today does not merely ""narrowly"" construe ""insurance"" in accordance with our general
             practice.  Rather, that approach actively discriminates between kinds of insurance, effectively confining ""insurance"" to traditional
             forms and effectively excluding forms that provide full-service coverage via provider agreements.  It thereby places a significant
             obstacle in the path of the latter."
1033 ,26    ," The Court argues, ante, at 232 n. 40, that provider agreements may have anticompetitive consequences which could lead to
             escalation of health-care costs.  The argument is not without force, but I must note that the very purpose of an antitrust
             exemption is to protect anticompetitive conduct.  The argument, therefore, is better directed to the legislature, which has the
             power to modify or repeal McCarran-Ferguson, rather than to this Court.  Referral to the legislators is particularly appropriate in
             this case, as the policy aspects may not be as one-sided as those painted by the Court.  There is authority for the proposition
             that provider agreements, far from increasing costs, constitute an effective means for reduction in health-care prices and
             premiums. Council on Wage and Price Stability, Employee Health Care Benefits: Labor and Management Sponsored
             Innovations in Controlling Cost, 41 Fed. Reg. 40298, 40305 (1976). And the argument that ""there is little incentive on the part of
             Blue Shield to minimize costs, since it is in the interest of the providers to set fee schedules at the highest possible level""
             overlooks the vital consideration that many if not most of these plans originate in collective-bargaining agreements where ""the
             consumer power and negotiating expertise of organized labor"" combine to ""reduce the unit price of health services."" Ibid.
             Control over provider agreements by state insurance commissioners constitutes a second ""incentive"" operating in the same
             direction.  See n. 18, supra.  Whether or not the potential anticompetitive impact of McCarran-Ferguson outweighs these positive
             effects on health-care costs is a judgment properly to be made by Congress. "

             in various circumstances where it is deemed necessary or sufficiently desirable.  It did not even enjoin blanket licensing with the
             television networks, the relief it realized would normally follow a finding of per se illegality of the license in that context.  Instead,
             as requested by CBS, it remanded to the District Court to require ASCAP to offer in addition to blanket licensing some
             competitive form of per-use licensing. But per-use licensing by ASCAP, as recognized in the consent decrees, might be even
             more susceptible to the per se rule than blanket licensing. The rationale for this unusual relief in a per se case was that ""[the] blanket license is not simply a 'naked restraint' ineluctably
             doomed to extinction."" 562 F.2d, at 140. To the contrary, the Court of Appeals found that the blanket license might well ""serve a
             market need"" for some.  Ibid.  This, it seems to us, is not the per se approach, which does not yield so readily to circumstances,
             but in effect is a rather bobtailed application of the rule of reason, bobtailed in the sense that it is unaccompanied by the
             necessary analysis demonstrating why the particular licensing system is an undue competitive restraint."
1047 ,28    ," Surely, if ASCAP abandoned the issuance of all licenses and confined its activities to policing the market and suing infringers,
             it could hardly be said that member copyright owners would be in violation of the antitrust laws by not having a common agent
             issue per-use licenses. Under the copyright laws, those who publicly perform copyrighted music have the burden of obtaining

             and an effective way to enforce those legal rights.  See Twentieth Century Music Corp. v. Aiken, 422 U.S. 151, 162 (1975). It
             takes an organization of rather large size to monitor most or all uses and to deal with users on behalf of the composers.

             inventory, but for which the network must still secure performing rights.  The networks accumulate substantial inventories of
             shows ""in the can."" And, as the Government has pointed out as amicus curiae: ""If they [the networks and television stations] were to discontinue the blanket license, they then would be required to obtain
             performance rights for these already-produced shows.  This attempt would create an opportunity for the copyright owners, as a
             condition of granting performing rights, to attempt to obtain the entire value of the shows 'in the can.' It would produce, in other
             words, a case of bilateral monopoly. Because pricing is indeterminate in a bilateral monopoly, television networks would not
             terminate their blanket licenses until they had concluded an agreement with every owner of copyrighted music 'in the can' to "
1057 ,      ," allow future performance for an identified price; the networks then would determine whether that price was sufficiently low that
             termination of the blanket license would be profitable.  But the prospect of such negotiations offers the copyrights owners an
             ability to misuse their rights in a way that ensures the continuation of blanket licensing despite a change in market conditions
             that may make other forms of licensing preferable."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24-25. This analysis is in no sense inconsistent with the findings of the District Court.  The District Court did reject CBS's coercion
             argument as to music ""in the can."" But as the Government again points out, the District Court's findings were addressed
             essentially to a tie-in claim; ""the court did not consider the possibility that the copyright owners' self-interested, non-coercive
             demands for compensation might nevertheless make the cost of CBS' dropping the blanket license sufficiently high that ASCAP
             and BMI could take this 'termination penalty' into account in setting fees for the blanket license."" Id., at 25 n. 23. "

1077 ,3     ," Relying on Bruce's Juices, Inc. v. American Can Co., 330 U.S. 743, 757 (1947), petitioner argues that this Court has previously
             accepted the automatic-damages theory.  In that case, the Court stated that if petitioner can show an illegal price discrimination
             under the Act, ""it would establish its right to recover three times the discriminatory difference without proving more than the
             illegality of the prices."" Ibid.  But that statement is merely dictum, since the only issue before the Court was whether a violation of
             § 2 (a) could be used as an affirmative defense to void a contract. "
1078 ,4     ," Respondent suggests that petitioner's inability to show that his favored competitors lowered their retail sales price should
             defeat recovery.  That argument assumes that evidence of a lower retail price is the sine qua non of antitrust injury, that the
             disfavored purchaser is simply not ""injured"" unless the favored purchaser has lowered his price.  If the favored purchaser has
             lowered his retail price, for example, the disfavored purchaser will lose sales to the extent it does not match that lower price.
             Similarly, if the disfavored purchaser matches the lower price, it will lose profits.  Because petitioner has not shown that the
             favored purchasers have lowered their retail price, petitioner is arguably foreclosed from showing that it lost either sales or
             profits.  Justice Cardozo seemingly adopted this position in ICC v. United States, 289 U.S. 385, 390-391 (1933), a case involving
             rate discrimination under the Interstate Commerce Act: ""If by reason of the discrimination, the preferred producers have been able to divert business that would otherwise have gone to
             the disfavored shipper, damage has resulted to the extent of the diverted profits.  If the effect of the discrimination has been to
             force the shipper to sell at a lowered price . . . damage has resulted to the extent of the reduction.  But none of these
             consequences is a necessary inference from discrimination without more."" Petitioner argues that is an overly narrow view of antitrust injury.  To the extent a disfavored purchaser must pay more for its
             goods than its competitors, it is less able to compete.  It has fewer funds available with which to advertise, make capital
             expenditures, and the like.  Although the inability of petitioner to show that the favored retailers lowered their retail price makes
             petitioner's argument particularly weak, we find it unnecessary to decide in this case whether such failure as a matter of law
             demonstrates no competitive injury. "
1079 ,5     ," Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555 (1931), is similarly distinguishable.  In upholding a jury
             verdict against respondents for a violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act, the Court observed: ""It is true that there was uncertainty as to the extent of damage, but there was none as to the fact of damage; and there is a clear
             distinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish the fact that petitioner had sustained some damage, and the "
1080 ,      ," measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix the amount.  The rule which precludes the recovery of uncertain damages
             applies to such as are not the certain result of the wrong, not to those damages which are definitely attributable to the wrong and
             only uncertain in respect of their amount. . . ."" Id., at 562. ""If the damage is certain, the fact that its extent is uncertain does not prevent a recovery."" Id., at 566. In this case, by contrast, the issue is not so much the amount of damages as whether petitioner has in fact been injured by an
             antitrust violation. "

             only association voicing the concerns of agents with regard to their representation of Equity members.  Until their voluntary
             resignation in late 1977, most of the petitioners were members of TARA.  The petitioners are now members of the National
             Association of Talent Representatives (NATR).  Unlike TARA, which functions only in the legitimate theater field, NATR also
             functions in the fields of motion pictures and television.  In those fields, agents operate under closely analogous agent
             regulations maintained by the Screen Actors' Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The history of the negotiations and disputes between Equity and TARA are described in the opinion of the District Court in the
             present case.  478 F.Supp. 496, 498 (SDNY)."
1089 ,8     ," The minimum, or ""scale,"" wage varies.  In August 1977, for example, the minimum weekly salary was $ 335 for Broadway
             performances, and $ 175 for performances off Broadway.  Scale wages are set by a collective-bargaining agreement between
             Equity and the producers, to which the agents are not parties.  When an agent represents an actor or actress whose
             professional reputation is not sufficient to demand a salary higher than scale, the agent hopes to develop a relationship that will
             become continually more remunerative as the performer's professional reputation grows, and with it the power to demand an
             ever higher salary. No agent is required to represent an actor or actress whom he does not wish to represent. "
1090 ,9     ," It is Equity's view that commissions in the industry are not necessarily related to efforts by the agents, and that an agent often
             functions as little more than an ""order taker,"" who is able to collect a percentage of a client's wages for the duration of a show for
             doing little more than answering a producer's telephone call.  Indeed, an agent may collect a commission on the salary of an
             actor or actress he represents even if the client obtains the job without the agent."
1090 ,10    ," Equity argues that this restriction is necessary because there is an incentive for agents to represent as many actors and
             actresses as possible -- and not necessarily to serve them all well -- because an agent receives a commission whenever his
             client is employed at a salary higher than scale, regardless of the extent of his involvement in obtaining employment for the
             client. "

1093 ,19    ," Even where there are union agreements with nonlabor groups that may have the effect of sheltering the nonlabor groups from
             competition in product markets, the Court has recognized a ""nonstatutory"" exemption to shield such agreements if they are

             Co., 381 U.S. 676. This nonstatutory exemption was described as follows in Connell Construction Co. v. Plumbers &
             Steamfitters, 421 U.S., at 622: ""The Court has recognized . . . that a proper accommodation between the congressional policy favoring collective bargaining
             under the NLRA and the congressional policy favoring free competition in business markets requires that some union-employer
             agreements be accorded a limited nonstatutory exemption from antitrust sanctions. . . . ""The nonstatutory exemption has its source in the strong labor policy favoring the association of employees to eliminate
             competition over wages and working conditions.  Union success in organizing workers and standardizing wages ultimately will
             affect price competition among employers, but the goals of federal labor law never could be achieved if this effect on business
             competition were held a violation of the antitrust laws. The Court therefore has acknowledged that labor policy requires tolerance
             for the lessening of business competition based on differences in wages and working conditions."" Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals in this case decided whether the nonstatutory exemption would independently
             shield the respondents from the petitioners' antitrust claims.  See n. 11, supra."

             employees.  See Musicians v. Carroll, 391 U.S. 99 (orchestra leaders who both lead an orchestra and play an instrument). "
1094 ,22    ," These consisted of a minimum scale for sidemen, a ""leader's fee,"" which was twice the sidemen's scale in orchestras of at
             least four, and an additional 8% for social security, unemployment insurance, and other expenses.  In addition, if a leader did not
             appear but designated a subleader, and four or more musicians performed, the leader was required to pay from his leader's fee
             1.5 times the sidemen's scale to the subleader."

             designed to cope with job competition and to protect wage scales and working conditions, 391 U.S., at 108, 109, 110, 113, it
             clearly did so sub silentio."
1094 ,24    ," Several cases before Carroll also upheld union regulation of the practices of independent entrepreneurs affecting the wages or

             Oliver, 358 U.S. 283 (Oliver I); Teamsters v. Oliver, 362 U.S. 605 (Oliver II).  In Milk Wagon Drivers, the Court held that the
             union had engaged in a ""labor dispute"" within the meaning of the Norris-LaGuardia Act when it attempted to organize
             independent ""vendors"" who supplied milk to retail stores.  There the union feared that the ""vendor system"" was designed to
             escape the payment of union wages and the assumption of union-imposed working conditions.  In Oliver I, the Milk Wagon
             Drivers decision was invoked to protect from state antitrust challenge a union's successful efforts to prescribe through collective-
             bargaining agreements a wage scale for truck-drivers, and minimum rental fees for drivers who owned their own trucks.  The
             union feared that driver-owners, whose fees included not only an entrepreneurial component but also a ""wage"" for the labor of
             driving, might undercut the union scale by charging a fee that effectively included a subscale wage component.  The Court
             stated that ""[the] regulations [embodied] . . . a direct frontal attack upon a problem thought to threaten the maintenance of the
             basic wage structure established by the collective bargaining contract."" 358 U.S., at 294. See also Oliver II, supra, at 606 (after
             remand to the state court)."
1094 ,25    ," Indeed, the District Court in Carroll, whose judgment was affirmed by this Court ""in its entirety,"" 391 U.S., at 114, drew
             parallels with the restrictions at issue in the present case.  The court noted that ""[apparently], similar abuses by booking agents
             existed in other fields too.  Edelstein v. Gillmore, 35 F.2d 723, 726 (2d Cir. 1929) (actors)."" Carroll v. AFM, 241 F.Supp. 865,
             892 (SDNY). "
1095 ,      ," The petitioners argue that theatrical agents are indistinguishable from ""numerous [other] groups of persons who merely supply
             products and services to union members"" such as landlords, grocers, accountants, and lawyers.  But it is clear that agents differ
             from these groups in two critical respects: the agents control access to jobs and negotiation of the terms of employment.  For the
             actor or actress, therefore, agent commissions are not merely a discretionary expenditure of disposable income, but a virtually
             inevitable concomitant of obtaining employment."

1095 ,27    ," The Court of Appeals found that ""the union cannot eliminate wage competition among its members without regulation of the
             fees of the agents."" 622 F.2d, at 651 (emphasis added).  Wage competition is prevented not only by the rule precluding
             commissions on scale jobs.  Actors and actresses could also compete over the percentage of their wages they were willing to
             cede to an agent, subject only to the restrictions imposed by state law."
1095 ,28    ," In many industries, unions maintain hiring halls and other job referral systems, particularly where work is typically temporary
             and performed on separate project sites rather than fixed locations.  By maintaining halls, unions attempt to eliminate abuses
             such as kickbacks, and to insure fairness and regularity in the system of access to employment.  In a 1947 Senate Report,
             Senator Taft explained: ""The employer should be able to make a contract with the union as an employment agency.  The union
             frequently is the best employment agency.  The employer should be able to give notice of vacancies, and in the normal course of
             events to accept men sent to him by the hiring hall."" S. Rep. No. 1827, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 13 (1947), quoted in Teamsters v.
             NLRB, 365 U.S. 667, 673-674. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have ruled that union demands for hiring halls are a mandatory subject of
             collective bargaining, and that strikes to obtain such provisions are protected activity.  See, e. g., Houston Chapter, Associated
             General Contractors, 143 N. L. R. B. 409, enf'd, 349 F.2d 449 (CA5); NLRB v. Tom Joyce Floors, Inc., 353 F.2d 768, 771 (CA9).

1096 ,30    ," As already indicated, the franchise fees are not segregated in any manner but merely deposited in the union's general fund."
1096 ,31    ," The respondents offer union hiring hall fees as an analogy in support of Equity's collection of franchise fees.  In that context,
             the respondents argue, without citation, that a union may impose reasonable fees upon employers to meet the costs of
             maintaining a union-run hiring hall. But even if the respondents' statement of labor law is correct, the analogy would not be
             persuasive.  Assuming that hiring hall fees are so imposed, the fees are borne by parties who directly benefit from the
             employment services of the hiring halls and are collected by the entities that provide them.  That is not true in the present case. The view expressed in the separate opinion filed today as to who are the beneficiaries of the franchising system will undoubtedly
             surprise the agents who brought this lawsuit.  Post, at 724. "

             the behavior of consumers with respect to personal health services. . . . ""Investment in costly health care resources, such as hospital beds, coronary care units or radio-isotope treatment centers is
             frequently made without regard to the existence of similar facilities or equipment already operating in an area.  Investment in
             costly facilities and equipment not only results in capital accumulation, but establishes an ongoing demand for payment to
             support those services. . . . ""A recently published study indicates that by 1975, over 67,000 unneeded hospital beds will be in operation throughout the
             United States. ""Hospital beds, though unused, contribute substantial additional costs to the health care industry."" 1974 Senate Report, at 39."

             hospitals, clinics and other medical care institutions and services are crowded into relatively tiny sectors, while large areas go
             poorly served or completely unserved.  Many rural communities are completely without a physician or any other type of health
             care service, while adjacent urban areas are oversupplied."" Ibid."

1121 ,13    ," In a new subsection, 42 U. S. C. § 300k-2 (b)(1) (1976 ed., Supp. IV), Congress made the finding that ""the effect of
             competition on decisions of providers respecting the supply of health services and facilities is diminished,"" causing ""duplication
             and excess supply of certain health services and facilities."" It added that where ""competition appropriately allocates supply
             consistent with health systems plans and State health plans,"" planning agencies should ""give priority . . . to actions which would
             strengthen the effect of competition on the supply of such services."" § 300k-2 (b)(3).  But, for ""health services, such as inpatient
             health services and other institutional health services, for which competition does not or will not appropriately allocate supply,""
             agencies should ""take actions . . . to allocate the supply of such services."" § 300k-3 (b)(2)."
1121 ,14    ," Significantly, the MAHSA health systems plan only called on insurers to create incentives to hold down the costs of care in
             existing institutions, and made no mention of a role for insurers in restraining unneeded hospital construction.  The plan calls on
             the ""reimbursement system [to] promote appropriate utilization of hospital services, provide positive incentives for efficient
             institutions, actively encourage utilization of less costly but equal quality alternatives to inpatient care, and develop uniform
             reimbursement programs."" App. 67a.  But it then asserts that ""[capital] investment in institutions [shall] be controlled by an
             appropriate review agency."" Ibid. "
1122 ,15    ," See n. 7, supra.  If it had done so, this case probably would not have arisen.  The state agency would have conditioned all
             hospital construction on issuance of a ""certificate of need."" See supra, at 385-386.  Parties pursuing hospital construction
             without a certificate of need would now be subject to legal penalties.  42 U. S. C. § 300m-2 (a)(4)(A) (1976 ed., Supp. IV). Missouri subsequently has established a state agency and enacted ""certificate of need"" legislation.  Mo. Rev. Stat. § 197.300 et
             seq. (Supp. 1980)."
1122 ,16    ," Congress knew how to give an HSA policy greater legal effect.  Under 42 U. S. C. § 300l-2 (e) (1976 ed., Supp. IV), HSA
             approval -- subject to review by the Secretary -- is required for expenditures of funds under certain federal programs."
1122 ,17    ," As noted supra, at 387-388, in 1979 competition was given a more prominent place in the thinking of Congress. "
1123 ,18    ," Nevertheless, because Congress has remained convinced that competition does not operate effectively in some parts of the
             health-care industry, e. g., 42 U. S. C. § 300k-2 (b) (1976 ed., Supp. IV), we emphasize that our holding does not foreclose
             future claims of antitrust immunity in other factual contexts.  Although favoring a reversal in this case, the United States as
             amicus curiae asserts that ""there are some activities that must, by implication, be immune from antitrust attack if HSAs and State
             Agencies are to exercise their authorized powers."" Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 11.  Where, for example, an
             HSA has expressly advocated a form of cost-saving cooperation among providers, it may be that antitrust immunity is
             ""necessary to make the [NHPRDA] work."" Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357 (1963). See 124 Cong. Rec.
             34932 (1978) (Rep. Rogers) (""The intent of Congress was that HSA's and providers who voluntarily work with them in carrying
             out the HSA's statutory mandate should not be subject to the antitrust laws. If they were, Public Law 93-641 simply could not be
             implemented"").  Such a case would differ substantially from the present one, where the conduct at issue is not cooperation
             among providers, but an insurer's refusal to deal with a provider that failed to heed the advice of an HSA."
1123 ,19    ," This holding does not, of course, suggest anything about the merits of the antitrust claim in this case.  These matters remain to
             be litigated on remand, where the court should give attention to the particular economic context in which the alleged conspiracy

             of the boiler; when the water level dropped below the probe, the fuel supply was interrupted.  Because water in a boiler surges
             and bubbles, the level intermittently would seem to fall slightly below the probe even though the overall level remained safe.  To
             prevent premature fuel cutoff because of these intermittent fluctuations, Hydrolevel's probe included a time delay that allowed

             be held liable for the deliberate torts of his agent.  Post, at 587.  But in fact, while there was a division of authority, many courts
             had made it very clear that principals could be held liable for torts analogous to the antitrust violations committed by ASME's
             agents. For instance, a treatise of that era noted that a ""considerable number of American courts"" had held the principal liable for the
             agent's fraud, though the agent acted solely for his own benefit, and praised a leading opinion for its ""singular ability and
             lucidity."" E. Huffcut, Elements of the Law of Agency § 155, p. 168 (1895).  Indeed, the author commented that the cases holding
             a principal liable when his agent acted with apparent authority and for the agent's sole benefit were ""too various to be referred to
             in detail."" Id., § 157. In holding a telegraph company liable for the fraud of its agent committed solely for his personal benefit, one court summarized
             the reasoning that became widespread during the last half of the 19th century: ""Persons receiving dispatches in the usual course
             of business, when there is nothing to excite suspicion, are entitled to rely upon the presumption that the agents intrusted with the
             performance of the business of the company have faithfully and honestly discharged the duty owed by it to its patrons, and that

             ] [3B]Thus, based on the agency law of the late 19th century, there is ample support for holding ASME liable,
             particularly since Congress intended that the antitrust laws be given broad, remedial effect.  See, e. g., Pfizer Inc. v. Government
             of India, 434 U.S. 308, 312-313 (1978). But, as we have made clear before, HN5[
             ] Victorian common law does not define the
             limits of the antitrust private action.  Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134 (1968) (refusing to apply
             the ancient defense of in pari delicto in antitrust cases).  We look to the general principles of the common law for guidance in

             679, 688 (1978), but our decisions are determined by the congressional intent that led to the enactment of the antitrust laws, a
             desire to enhance competition, see id., at 688, 691. Here, general agency principles would lead to a finding of liability if the
             violation in this case were a mere tort; and imposing liability on ASME in accord with those common-law principles honors the
             congressional intent behind the antitrust statutes. "
1137 ,7     ," Evidently, in recent years no Court of Appeals other than the Second Circuit has directly decided whether a principal can be
             held liable for antitrust damages based on an apparent authority theory.  But cf.  Truck Drivers' Local No. 421 v. United States,
             128 F.2d 227 (CA8 1942). The dissent cites several cases, stating that they appear to reject antitrust liability based on apparent

             reveals that they did not discuss the merits of an apparent authority theory of antitrust liability.  The dissent then dismisses other
             cases that also do not directly discuss the validity of the apparent authority theory, but that contain language approving apparent

             stated: ""A major reason for the continued success at M&M is a result of [James'] efforts and skill in influencing the various code making

             Hardin's response.  And certainly they will be encouraged to give responses a closer look in the future if ASME is subject to

1138 ,10    ," Permitting private plaintiffs to sue defendants like ASME will make that incentive especially powerful, because private suits are
             an important element of the Nation's antitrust enforcement effort: ""Congress created the treble-damages remedy . . . precisely for the purpose of encouraging private challenges to antitrust
             violations.  These private suits provide a significant supplement to the limited resources available to the Department of Justice

1138 ,11    ," The apparent authority rule is also consistent with the congressional desire that the antitrust laws sweep broadly.  Congress

             however, are not controlling here.  The Court expressly pointed out: ""Here it is not a question . . . of holding out an appearance
             of authority on which some third person acts."" 259 U.S., at 395; 268 U.S., at 304-305. In fact, it noted: ""A corporation is
             responsible for the wrongs committed by its agents in the course of its business, and this principle is enforced against the
             contention that torts are ultra vires of the corporation."" 259 U.S., at 395; 268 U.S., at 304. "
1139 ,13    ," The dissent argues, unconvincingly to us, that imposing antitrust liability on ASME will not advance enforcement of the
             antitrust laws. The dissent claims that the apparent authority rule will ""[encourage] plaintiffs to seek recovery from nonprofit organizations,
             rather than from the commercial enterprises that benefited from the violation."" Post, at 591.  Here, the dissent engages in
             ""curious reasoning,"" see ibid., because today's decision does not encourage a plaintiff to sue any particular defendant to the
             exclusion of others; it merely lists organizations like ASME among the possible defendants in cases similar to this one.  Indeed,
             although the litigation in this case ended with ASME as the only remaining defendant, it seems likely that, in general, a plaintiff
             will prefer to bring a corporate defendant like M&M (ITT) before a jury, rather than a nonprofit organization that understandably
             may appeal to a jury's sympathies and that may not provide so deep a pocket as a commercial enterprise. In addition, the dissent insists that ASME and other such organizations cannot take steps to reduce the likelihood that antitrust
             violations like the one that occurred in this case will take place in the future.  Post, at 591-592, n. 17.  Evidently ASME does not
             agree, because it has instituted new procedures specifically in response to this suit.  See n. 15, infra.  The dissent simply refuses
             to accept that ASME and other such organizations can react to potential antitrust liability by making their associations less
             subject to fraudulent manipulation."
1139 ,14    ," A majority of courts, however, have held corporations liable for punitive damages imposed because of the acts of their agents,
             in the absence of approval or ratification. See W. Prosser, Law of Torts 12 (4th ed. 1971).  E. g., Kelite Products, Inc. v. Binzel,
             224 F.2d 131, 144 (CA5 1955) (""[The] jury may in its discretion assess punitive damages against a corporate defendant for
             oppressive acts of its agent done in the course of his employment, regardless of actual authority or ratification""); Mayo Hotel Co.
             v. Danciger, 143 Okla. 196, 200, 288 P. 309, 313 (1930) (holding corporate principal liable for punitive damages, noting that ""the
             legal malice of the servant is the legal malice of the corporation"").  In fact, the Court may have departed from the trend of late
             19th-century decisions when it issued Lake Shore & M.S.R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101 (1893), requiring the principal's
             participation, approval, or ratification. See Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Holdfodt, 86 Ill. 455, 459 (1877) (""if the wrongful act of
             the agent is perpetrated while ostensibly discharging duties within the scope of the corporate purposes, the corporation may be
             liable to vindictive damages""); see also Pullman Palace Car Co. v. Lawrence, 74 Miss. 782, 803-805, 22 So. 53, 57-59 (1897);
             Goddard v. Grand Trunk R. Co., 57 Me. 202, 223-224 (1869). "
1140 ,15    ," Indeed, ASME has initiated procedures to protect against similar misadventures in the future.  After its experience with the
             Hydrolevel affair, ASME began issuing a publication containing all written technical inquiries pertaining to codes and their
             interpretations, a publication available through subscription.  See ASME Court of Appeals Exhibit Volume, p. 110; App. in Nos.
             79-7254, 79-7260 (CA2), pp. 784 and 804.  Apparently, ASME now gives its interpretations close scrutiny through the
             publication process.  According to the publication's foreword, ""[in] some few instances, a review of the interpretation revealed a
             need for corrections of a technical nature."" In those cases, ASME published ""a corrected interpretation . . . immediately after the
             original reply."" See Interpretations, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Foreword (No. 7: Replies to Technical Inquiries
             January 1, 1980, through June 30, 1980).  In addition, the readers are advised that ASME may reconsider its interpretation
             ""when or if additional information is available which the inquirer believes might affect the interpretation."" Ibid. ASME's new procedure illustrates that the standard-setting organization itself is in the best position to prevent antitrust violations
             committed by its agents acting with apparent authority, and therefore that the policies of antitrust and agency law call for
             imposition of liability upon ASME. "
1141 ,*     ," The District Court instructed the jury that it could find petitioner liable for the acts of its members only if they acted on behalf of
             the corporation within the scope of their actual authority or if the corporation thereafter ratified or adopted their acts.  Judge
             Weinstein refused to give the apparent authority instruction proposed by respondent.  Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals did not
             rest on the narrow ratification theory underlying the District Court judgment, but instead reached out to decide that petitioner is
             liable for the acts of its members if those acts are found to be within their apparent authority: the jury never found liability on that
             theory and the Court of Appeals went ""out of bounds."" I regard that aspect of the Court of Appeals' opinion and that part of the
             Court's opinion today as dictum not essential to support the result reached."
1141 ,1     ," The District Court entered a judgment against ASME in an amount in excess of $ 7 million -- a sum that would destroy many
             such organizations.  By contrast McDonnell & Miller, Inc., and Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co., commercial
             enterprises owned by International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., and the beneficiaries of the fraudulent conduct in this case,
             have settled for $ 725,000 and $ 75,000 respectively.  Curiously, the Court speaks of the ""wisdom"" of a rule that encourages
             such an inequitable result.  Ante, at 573.  The Court correctly notes that the Court of Appeals reversed the damages award "
1142 ,      ," against ASME and remanded for a new estimation.  Perhaps the final award against ASME will be substantially less than the $
             7.5 million judgment originally entered.  Yet there is no assurance of this."
1142 ,2     ," Although associations now are viewed as being within the scope of the antitrust laws, to my knowledge this is the first case in
             which the Court has held explicitly that a nonprofit, tax-exempt association is subject to treble-damages liability.  Cf. Areeda,
             Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" After Lafayette, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 435, 455 (1981) (footnote omitted) (""[Antitrust] liability does
             not necessarily call for a damage remedy. . . .  The Supreme Court may come to agree that antitrust liability may vary according
             to the remedies sought""). ASME refers to itself as a ""society."" I use the words ""organization"" and ""association"" interchangeably to describe a broad range
             of nonprofit, membership entities and tax-exempt organizations."
1142 ,3     ," Goldfarb ""properly left to the Court some flexibility in considering how to apply traditional Sherman Act concepts to professions
             long consigned to self-regulation."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 699 (1978)
             (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  See id., at 701 (stressing the need for ""elbow-room for realistic
             application of the Sherman Act"" to other than commercial enterprises)."
1142 ,4     ," The Court cites to several decisions, ante, at 575, n. 14, in which courts have levied punitive damages upon the principal for
             the ""unauthorized"" acts of an agent.  It is not clear that any of these decisions holds the principal liable upon the apparent
             authority of an agent acting without intent to benefit the principal.  None of them concerns the antitrust laws. None involves a
             nonprofit entity."
1142 ,5     ," ""[A] trades-union . . . might be held liable . . . but certainly it must be clearly shown in order to impose such a liability on an
             association of 450,000 men that what was done was done by their agents in accordance with their fundamental agreement of
             association."" Coronado Coal Co., 268 U.S., at 304. The Court refused to impose liability on the national union simply because it
             had the authority to discipline the local.  See Mine Workers, 259 U.S., at 395. Moreover, the Court indicated that this was not a
             case in which a theory of apparent authority might be applied -- despite the national union's power over the local and despite the
             support of the strike by the president of the national union: ""Here it is not a question of contract or of holding out an appearance
             of authority on which some third person acts."" Ibid.  The majority quotes this language, see ante, at 573, n. 12, but misses its
             point.  The Mine Workers Court well could have characterized the case before it as involving an exercise of apparent authority
             by the local union or the national president; it refused to do so.  See Truck Drivers' Local No. 421 v. United States, 128 F.2d 227,
             235 (CA8 1942) (viewing the holding in Mine Workers as rejecting an apparent authority theory of antitrust liability). "
1143 ,6     ," See United States v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp., 433 F.2d 174, 204 (CA3 1970); United States v. Cadillac
             Overall Supply Co., 568 F.2d 1078, 1090 (CA5 1978); United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 467 F.2d 1000 (CA9 1972). Accord
             Truck Drivers' Local No. 421 v. United States, supra, at 235 (union not liable for the antitrust violations of a local division: ""To
             bind the union in a situation such as this, actual and authorized agency was necessary; mere apparent authority would not be
             sufficient""). In United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., supra, for example, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled out liability on
             apparent authority by requiring that the agent hold a ""purpose to benefit the corporation."" Id., at 1006, n. 4. In light of the rule
             adopted by the Court today, it is ironic that the Court of Appeals in Hilton Hotels considered that its rule of liability was actually a
             broad one.  Although implicitly rejecting a rule of apparent authority, the court held that a corporation could be liable for the acts
             of its agents ""even when done against company orders."" Id., at 1004. The court argued that such an expansive rule of liability
             was justified in the case before it, involving a commercial enterprise, because the Sherman Act was ""primarily concerned with
             the activities of business entities."" Ibid.  A rule promoting corporate liability was supported further by the consideration that
             antitrust violations ""are usually motivated by a desire to enhance profits,"" ""involve basic policy decisions, and must be
             implemented over an extended period of time,"" and ""if a violation of the Sherman Act occurs, the corporation, and not the
             individual agents, will have realized the profits from the illegal activity."" Id., at 1006. None of these considerations in support of a
             broad rule of liability applies to the fraudulent, self-interested conduct of ASME members in this case.  Yet the Court adopts a
             rule of liability far broader than that stated by the Ninth Circuit with such care."
1143 ,7     ," In Lake Shore & M.S.R. Co. v. Prentice, 147 U.S. 101, 107 (1893), the Court held that ""[a] principal . . . cannot be held liable for
             exemplary or punitive damages, merely by reason of wanton, oppressive or malicious intent on the part of the agent."" In a
             generally similar context, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a principal was not subject to double damages under
             the False Claims Act, 31 U. S. C. § 231, for the fraud of an agent acting without intent to benefit the principal.  See United States
             v. Ridglea State Bank, 357 F.2d 495, 500 (1966) (""[The] present action is not primarily one for the recovery of a loss caused by
             an employee, but is one which, if successful, must result in a recovery wholly out of proportion to actual loss. . . .  [The] case
             calls for the application of the rule . . . that the knowledge or guilty intent of an agent not acting with a purpose to benefit his
             employer, will not be imputed to the employer"")."
1143 ,8     ," Hydrolevel argues that Continental Baking Co. v. United States, 281 F.2d 137, 150-151 (CA6 1960), and United States v.
             Continental Group, Inc., 603 F.2d 444, 468, n. 5 (CA3 1979), support an apparent authority theory of liability in antitrust cases.
             Yet in Continental Baking the court endorsed an instruction that included an ""apparent"" authority component on the theory that a
             corporation must ""answer for [an agent's] violations of law which inure to the corporation's benefit."" There was no such benefit in
             this case.  Moreover, in Continental Group the court simply affirmed an apparent authority instruction without comment, in a
             footnote, in a case presenting many other issues.  The agents in that case were clearly acting for the benefit of their
             corporations, and the court may have considered that the apparent authority instruction, if error, was harmless. "
1144 ,      ," In any event, the comparative paucity of authority on the question of apparent authority liability in antitrust cases simply
             underscores that the Court today is making new law.  It also is doing so needlessly as ASME was neither tried nor found liable
             on the basis of apparent authority."
1144 ,9     ," Relying on a novel public policy as to nonprofit associations, the Court makes little effort to ascertain the intent of Congress
             either through examining the legislative history or the common law then existing.  Indeed, the Court implies that the agency law
             of the 19th century and ""Victorian"" common law are irrelevant.  See ante, at 568-569, n. 6.  In seeking to understand the
             Sherman Act, this Court frequently has found it necessary to ""delve"" into the history of the common law both ""Victorian"" and from
             earlier eras.  See Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U.S. 1, 51-62 (1911). The Civil Rights Acts of the 19th century were
             also the work of a ""Victorian"" Congress, yet we have looked both to the legislative history and to the common law when
             interpreting those Acts.  See, e. g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967). "
1145 ,10    ," In Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 644, n. 17 (1981), the Court stated that the rules of common
             law in effect at the time the Act was passed were relevant to an inquiry into congressional intent: ""[It] is clear that when the
             Sherman Act was adopted the common law did not provide a right to contribution among tortfeasors participating in proscribed
             conduct.  One permissible, though not mandatory, inference is that Congress relied on courts' continuing to apply principles in
             effect at the time of enactment."" The contemporary case law is relevant precisely because ""Congress . . . did not intend the text
             of the Sherman Act to delineate the full meaning of the statute or its application in concrete situations.  The legislative history
             makes it perfectly clear that it expected the courts to give shape to the statute's broad mandate by drawing on common-law
             tradition."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S., at 688."
1145 ,11    ," ""Where a corporation or trustees are conducting a charity with funds devoted to that purpose, the charitable organization is not
             liable for the torts of its agents or servants, as 'it would be against all law and all equity to take those trust funds, so contributed
             for a special, charitable purpose, to compensate injuries inflicted or occasioned by the negligence of the agents or servants.'"" E.
             Huffcut, Elements of the Law of Agency § 161, pp. 176-177 (1895)."
1145 ,12    ," In describing the liability of the principal for the torts of the agent, the First Restatement of Agency, published in 1933,
             cautioned that it did not address ""any limitations upon liability because of . . . rules applicable to special classes, such as
             charitable organizations."" Restatement of Agency 458."
1145 ,13    ," The complete statement of the rule by Mechem is as follows: ""While . . . it is well settled that the principal is liable for the negligent act of his agent, committed in the course of his
             employment, it has been held in many cases, that he is not liable for the agent's willful or malicious act. . . . ""The tendency of modern cases, however, is to attach less importance to the intention of the agent and more to the question
             whether the act was done within the scope of the agent's employment; and it is believed that the true rule may be said to be that
             the principal is responsible for the wilful or malicious acts of his agent, if they are done in the course of his employment and
             within the scope of his authority; but that the principal is not liable for such acts, unless previously expressly authorized, or
             subsequently ratified, when they are done outside of the course of the agent's employment, and beyond the scope of his
             authority, as where the agent steps aside from his employment to gratify some personal animosity, or to give vent to some
             private feeling of his own"" (emphasis added, footnotes omitted). Although the concept of within ""scope of authority"" is not always easy to apply, it is beyond rational doubt that in this case the
             fraudulent activity of Hardin and James, on behalf of McDonnell & Miller, Inc., was not within the scope of any authority of
             ASME.  In addition, some courts have found that ""[a] purpose to benefit the corporation is necessary to bring the agent's acts
             within the scope of his employment."" See United States v. Hilton Hotels Corp., 467 F.2d, at 1006, n. 4. It is just such a purpose
             that was lacking in this case.  Indeed, the ""agents"" in this case were not acting simply for their own malicious purposes, they
             were acting on behalf of another principal with interests inimical to those of ASME.  It is far from clear under principles of agency
             law that Hardin and James are properly described as the ""agents"" of ASME when they act to serve a different principal and
             without any intention of benefiting ASME.  See Mechem § 67 (""A person may act as agent of two or more principals . . . if his
             duties to each are not such as to require . . . incompatible things""). "
1146 ,      ," The Court suggests that there was a division among the state courts on the question of the principal's liability for the malicious
             acts of an agent.  See ante, at 568-569, n. 6.  But there was no division in the federal courts, the courts charged with
             enforcement of the Sherman Act. In any event, surely the point is not whether every state court recognized the rule stated by this
             Court in Friedlander v. Texas & Pacific R. Co., 130 U.S. 416 (1889). Rather, if there was any uncertainty as to the liability of a
             commercial principal for the torts of an agent acting in the course of employment, how much clearer must it be that a nonprofit,
             voluntary association would not have been held liable in treble damages for the acts of an agent acting with apparent authority
             only."
1146 ,14    ," The Court notes that Friedlander was later overruled by Gleason v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co., 278 U.S. 349 (1929). The
             relevance of this fact to Congress' intentions is not clear to me.  There is ""no federal general common law."" Erie R. Co. v.
             Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 (1938). There is no federal general law of agency.  Rather we are engaged here in an exercise in
             statutory construction.  Cf. 21 Cong. Rec. 3149 (1890) (remarks of Sen. Morgan) (""It is very true that we use common-law terms
             here and common-law definitions in order to define an offense which is in itself comparatively new, but it is not a common-law
             jurisdiction that we are conferring upon the circuit courts of the United States,"" quoted in Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff
             Materials, Inc., 451 U.S., at 644)."
1146 ,15    ," The Court responds by citing to several state law decisions indicating that in some States a principal might have been held
             liable in punitive damages for the acts of an agent.  See ante, at 575, n. 14.  I believe the Court overstates the extent to which
             19th-century state courts imposed punitive damages on the principal for the deliberate torts of an agent.  See Mechem § 751; cf.
             Mayo Hotel Co. v. Danciger, 143 Okla. 196, 200, 288 P. 309, 312 (1930) (""There are . . . respectable authorities, some of them
             recent ones, definitely holding that a corporation cannot be subjected to exemplary damages because of the malicious . . . acts
             of its agents and servants where such acts are not authorized or afterwards ratified . . . .  Many of the state courts, and a
             majority of the federal courts, expressly adhere to that doctrine"") (emphasis added).  More significantly, the Court does not make
             clear which, if any, of the state decisions it relies upon held the principal liable for punitive damages upon the apparent authority
             of an agent acting without any intention of benefiting the principal.  I had thought that this was the question before us.  And again
             the Court misses the basic point: If the rule of liability adopted by the Court today would have seemed questionable in 1890 even
             as applied to a commercial enterprise, can there be any basis for believing that Congress intended such an extreme rule of
             liability to be applied to voluntary, nonprofit associations? "
1147 ,16    ," Damages were awarded against ASME in an amount of $ 7.5 million.  By contrast, McDonnell & Miller settled the suit for less
             than a million dollars.  See n. 1, supra.  The majority's contention that ""a plaintiff will prefer to bring a corporate defendant like
             M&M (ITT) before a jury,"" ante, at 574, n. 13, is not borne out by this case.  If the Court has some other case in mind, it does not
             cite to it."
1147 ,17    ," The Court's argument that the imposition of treble damages will advance antitrust enforcement has a hollow ring in the context
             of a membership, nonprofit organization. Organizations of this kind normally function through committees composed -- as in this
             case -- of volunteers who are not employees, serve only at infrequent intervals, and are virtually uncontrollable by what usually is
             a small headquarters staff. The Court suggests that voluntary organizations can ""take steps to reduce the likelihood that antitrust violations like the one that
             occurred in this case will take place in the future."" Ibid.  The Court then refers to ""new procedures"" adopted by ASME, and
             criticizes my dissent for refusing ""to accept that ASME and other such organizations can react to potential antitrust liability by
             making their associations less subject to fraudulent manipulation."" Ibid. It would be enlightening if the Court would explain how such an association can protect itself even from ""mere tort"" liability, see
             ante, at 569, n. 6, much less the treble-damages liability imposed in this case, in light of the Court's adoption of the apparent
             authority theory of liability.  Review procedures well may be helpful to prevent mistakes made in good faith on behalf of an
             association.  But no set of rules and regulations, and no procedures however elaborate, can protect adequately against fraud
             and disloyalty.  In this case, for example, if ASME had required approval by a review committee or even by its governing body
             before the release of each of the thousands of ruling letters, a member bent on fraud could forge evidence or otherwise
             circumvent most safeguards.  In practice, a rule of apparent authority can be a rule of strict liability as the Court today holds in
             this case.  In the context of a loosely structured, voluntary nonprofit association it may be wholly impractical to adopt any
             measures that will lessen substantially the likelihood of liability, and if there is liability the Court also would impose punitive
             damages. "
1148 ,18    ," The intersection of the law of agency and vicarious liability with the law of conspiracy makes this a complex case.  Yet the
             Court does not recognize this complexity.  It so expands the concept of vicarious liability as to leave little content, in this case, to
             the requirement in § 1 of the Sherman Act that antitrust plaintiffs demonstrate a contract, combination, or conspiracy.  Indeed,
             the Court never identifies who conspired with whom.  Did James -- acting for ASME -- conspire with Hardin -- acting for
             McDonnell & Miller, Inc., and Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.?  Or was it the other way around?  Could it be
             said, under the Court's theory, that James had conspired with himself -- as a double agent -- thereby committing both of his
             ""principals"" to an antitrust conspiracy?  In my view, it makes more sense to view the matter as a conspiracy between the agents
             of McDonnell & Miller, Inc., and Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.  The Court's theory makes possible
             ratification by ASME irrelevant.  In this light, ASME was as much a victim of this conspiracy as Hydrolevel."

1159 ,4     ," Judge Sneed explained his reluctance to apply the per se rule substantially as follows: The record did not indicate the actual
             purpose of the maximum-fee arrangements or their effect on competition in the health care industry.  It was not clear whether the
             assumptions made about typical price restraints could be carried over to that industry.  Only recently had this Court applied the
             antitrust laws to the professions.  Moreover, there already were such significant obstacles to pure competition in the industry that
             a court must compare the prices that obtain under the maximum-fee arrangements with those that would otherwise prevail rather
             than with those that would prevail under ideal competitive conditions.  Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit had not applied Kiefer-
             Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U.S. 211 (1951), and Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145 (1968), to
             horizontal agreements that establish maximum prices; some of the economic assumptions underlying the rule against maximum
             price fixing were not sound."
1159 ,5     ," Judge Kennedy's concurring opinion concluded as follows: ""There does not now appear to be a controlling or definitive analysis of the market impact caused by the arrangements under
             scrutiny in this case, but trial may reveal that the arrangements are, at least in their essentials, not peculiar to the medical
             industry and that they should be condemned."" 643 F.2d, at 560."
1159 ,6     ," Judge Larson stated, in part: ""Defendants formulated and dispersed relative value guides and conversion factor lists which together were used to set an upper
             limit on fees received from third-party payors.  It is clear that these activities constituted maximum price-fixing by competitors.
             Disregarding any 'special industry' facts, this conduct is per se illegal.  Precedent alone would mandate application of the per se
             standard. ""I find nothing in the nature of either the medical profession or the health care industry that would warrant their exemption from
             per se rules for price-fixing."" Id., at 563-564 (citations omitted)."
1159 ,7     ," Most health insurance plans are of the fee-for-service type.  Under the typical insurance plan, the insurer agrees with the
             insured to reimburse the insured for ""usual, customary, and reasonable"" medical charges.  The third-party insurer, and the
             insured to the extent of any excess charges, bears the economic risk that the insured will require medical treatment.  An
             alternative to the fee-for-service type of insurance plan is illustrated by the health maintenance organizations authorized under
             the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, 42 U. S. C. § 300e et seq.  Under this form of prepaid health plan, the "
1160 ,      ," consumer pays a fixed periodic fee to a functionally integrated group of doctors in exchange for the group's agreement to
             provide any medical treatment that the subscriber might need.  The economic risk is thus borne by the doctors."
1160 ,8     ," The record contains divergent figures on the percentage of Pima County doctors that belong to the foundation.  A 1975
             publication of the foundation reported 80%; a 1978 affidavit by the executive director of the foundation reported 30%."
1160 ,9     ," In 1980, after the District Court and the Court of Appeals had rendered judgment, both foundations apparently discontinued the
             use of relative values and conversion factors in formulating the fee schedules.  Moreover, the Maricopa Foundation that year
             amended its bylaws to provide that the fee schedule would be adopted by majority vote of its board of trustees and not by vote of
             its members.  The challenge to the foundation activities as we have described them in the text, however, is not mooted by these
             changes.  See United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629 (1953)."
1160 ,10    ," The parties disagree over whether the increases in the fee schedules are the cause or the result of the increases in the
             prevailing rate for medical services in the relevant markets.  There appears to be agreement, however, that 85-95% of
             physicians in Maricopa County bill at or above the maximum reimbursement levels set by the Maricopa Foundation."
1160 ,11    ," Seven different insurance companies underwrite health insurance plans that have been approved by the Maricopa
             Foundation, and three companies underwrite the plans approved by the Pima Foundation.  The record contains no firm data on
             the portion of the health care market that is covered by these plans.  The State relies upon a 1974 analysis indicating that the
             insurance plans endorsed by the Maricopa Foundation had about 63% of the prepaid health care market, but the respondents

             balanced against its procompetitive consequences.  Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a per se rule reflects
             the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify

             must fix the fee schedule."
1166 ,27    ," In that program the foundation performs the peer review function as well as the administrative function of paying the doctors'
             claims."
1166 ,28    ," In order to create an insurance plan under which the doctor would agree to accept as full payment a fee prescribed in a fixed
             schedule, someone must canvass the doctors to determine what maximum prices would be high enough to attract sufficient
             numbers of individual doctors to sign up but low enough to make the insurance plan competitive. In this case that canvassing
             function is performed by the foundation; the foundation then deals with the insurer. It would seem that an insurer could simply
             bypass the foundation by performing the canvassing function and dealing with the doctors itself.  Under the foundation plan,
             each doctor must look at the maximum-fee schedule fixed by his competitors and vote for or against approval of the plan (and, if
             the plan is approved by majority vote, he must continue or revoke his foundation membership).  A similar, if to some extent more
             protracted, process would occur if it were each insurer that offered the maximum-fee schedule to each doctor. "
1167 ,29    ," In this case it appears that the fees are set by a group with substantial power in the market for medical services, and that there
             is competition among insurance companies in the sale of medical insurance.  Under these circumstances the insurance
             companies are not likely to have significantly greater bargaining power against a monopoly of doctors than would individual
             consumers of medical services."

             the compositions covered by the license. But the blanket license cannot be wholly equated with a simple horizontal arrangement
             among competitors. ASCAP does set the price for its blanket license, but that license is quite different from anything any
             individual owner could issue.  The individual composers and authors have neither agreed not to sell individually in any other
             market nor use the blanket license to mask price fixing in such other markets."" Id., at 23-24 (footnote omitted). "
1168 ,33    ," It may be true that by becoming a member of the foundation the individual practitioner obtains a competitive advantage in the
             market for medical services that he could not unilaterally obtain.  That competitive advantage is the ability to attract as
             customers people who value both the guarantee of full health coverage and a choice of doctors. But, as we have indicated, the
             setting of the price by doctors is not a ""necessary consequence"" of an arrangement with an insurer in which the doctor agrees
             not to charge certain insured customers more than a fixed price. "

             among themselves according to an agreed-upon formula.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. American Society of
             Composers, Authors and Publishers, 562 F.2d 130, 135-136 (CA2 1977)."
1172 ,10    ," In this case, the foundations' maximum-fee schedules attempt to rectify the inflationary consequence of patients' indifference
             to the size of physicians' bills and insurers' commitment to reimburse whatever ""usual, customary, and reasonable"" charges
             physicians may submit.  In Broadcast Music, the market defect inhered in the fact that ""those who performed copyrighted music
             for profit were so numerous and widespread, and most performances so fleeting, that as a practical matter it was impossible for
             the many individual copyright owners to negotiate with and license the users and to detect unauthorized uses."" 441 U.S., at 4-5."
1172 ,11    ," In this case, the record before us indicates that insurers -- those best situated to decide and best motivated to inspire trust in
             their judgment -- believe that the foundations are the most efficient providers of the maximum-fee scheduling service.  In
             Broadcast Music, we found that the blanket copyright clearinghouse system ""[reduced] costs absolutely . . . ."" Id., at 21."
1172 ,12    ," The Court states that in Broadcast Music ""there was little competition among individual composers for their separate
             compositions."" Ante, at 355.  This is an irrational ground for distinction.  Competition could have existed, 441 U.S., at 6; see also
             562 F.2d, at 134-135, 138, but did not because of the cooperative agreement.  That competition yet persists among physicians
             is not a sensible reason to invalidate their agreement while refusing similarly to condemn the Broadcast Music agreements that
             were completely effective in eliminating competition. The Court also offers as a distinction that the foundations do not permit the creation of ""any different product."" Ante, at 356.  But
             the foundations provide a ""different product"" to precisely the same extent as did Broadcast Music's clearinghouses.  The
             clearinghouses provided only what copyright holders offered as individual sellers -- the rights to use individual compositions. The
             clearinghouses were able to obtain these same rights more efficiently, however, because they eliminated the need to engage in
             individual bargaining with each individual copyright owner.  See 441 U.S., at 21-22. In the same manner, the foundations set up an innovative means to deliver a basic service -- insured medical care from a wide
             range of physicians of one's choice -- in a more economical manner.  The foundations' maximum-fee schedules replace the
             weak cost containment incentives in typical ""usual, customary, and reasonable"" insurance agreements with a stronger cost
             control mechanism: an absolute ceiling on maximum fees that can be charged.  The conduct of the insurers in this case
             indicates that they believe that the foundation plan as it presently exists is the most efficient means of developing and
             administering such schedules.  At this stage in the litigation, therefore, we must agree that the foundation plan permits the more
             economical delivery of the basic insurance service -- ""to some extent, a different product."" Broadcast Music, 441 U.S., at 22. "
1173 ,13    ," Medical services differ from the typical service or commercial product at issue in an antitrust case.  The services of physicians,
             rendered on a patient-by-patient basis, rarely can be compared by the recipient.  A person requiring medical service or advice
             has no ready way of comparing physicians or of ""shopping"" for quality medical service at a lesser price.  Primarily for this
             reason, the foundations -- operating the plan at issue -- perform a function that neither physicians nor prospective patients can
             perform individually.  On a collective -- and average -- basis, the physicians themselves express a willingness to render certain
             identifiable services for not more than specified fees, leaving patients free to choose the physician.  We thus have a case in
             which we derive little guidance from the conventional ""perfect market"" analysis of antitrust law.  I would give greater weight than
             the Court to the uniqueness of medical services, and certainly would not invalidate on a per se basis a plan that may in fact
             perform a uniquely useful service. Affirmance of the District Court's holding would not have immunized the medical service plan at issue.  Nor would it have
             foreclosed an eventual conclusion on remand that the arrangement should be deemed per se invalid.  And if the District Court
             had found that petitioner had failed to establish a per se violation of the Sherman Act, the question would have remained
             whether the plan comports with the rule of reason. See, e. g., United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 441, n.
             16 (1978). "

1181 ,1     ,With petitioner Blue Shield of Southwestern Virginia.
1182 ,2     ," Petitioners contend that the contract between the county and Blue Shield must be read to bar payments for the services of
             nonphysicians.  Respondent counters that between 1962 and 1972 Blue Shield routinely reimbursed subscribers for
             psychotherapy provided by psychologists, and that this practice was revised in 1972 as a result of the alleged conspiracy. In
             addition, respondent notes that in 1973 the Virginia Legislature passed a ""freedom of choice"" statute, Va. Code § 38.1-824
             (1981), that required Blue Shield to pay for services rendered by licensed psychologists. See Virginia Academy of Clinical
             Psychologists v. Blue Shield of Virginia, 624 F.2d 476, 478 (CA4 1980). She argues that Blue Shield's obligations must be read
             consistently with that statute, at least until that statute was held invalid as applied in Blue Cross of Virginia v. Commonwealth,
             221 Va. 349, 269 S. E. 2d 827 (1980). This case arises on a motion to dismiss.  We therefore assume, as McCready has
             alleged, that but for the alleged conspiracy to deny payment, she would have been reimbursed by Blue Shield for the cost of her
             psychologist's services."
1182 ,3     ," Apparently Blue Shield inadvertently paid one of McCready's claims.  After the error was discovered, Blue Shield sought to
             obtain a refund from McCready for the amount paid.  649 F.2d 228, 230, n. 4 (1981)."
1182 ,4     ," A similar complaint was filed by the Virginia Academy of Clinical Psychologists (VACP) and its president against the same
             defendants.  The District Court addressed the motions to dismiss filed in each of the cases in a single opinion.  The court
             dismissed McCready's case -- thus giving rise to the appellate decision at issue in this Court -- but permitted the VACP case to
             proceed to trial.  Following trial, the District Court entered judgment for the defendants, Virginia Academy of Clinical
             Psychologists v. Blue Shield of Virginia, 469 F.Supp. 552 (1979), but the Court of Appeals reversed with respect to defendant
             Blue Shield, 624 F.2d 476 (CA4 1980). The opinion of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in the instant case states that
             the opinion in VACP ""should be read in connection with"" its own opinion.  649 F.2d, at 230. A brief recitation of the decision in
             the VACP case is thus helpful in understanding the precise nature of McCready's claim. In VACP, the Court of Appeals rejected the District Court's treatment of Blue Shield as a distinct entity for purposes of
             determining whether a conspiracy or agreement had been shown.  624 F.2d, at 479. The court found that ""the Blue Shield Plans
             are combinations of physicians, operating under the direction and control of their physician members."" Ibid. ""Blue Shield Plans are not insurance companies, though they are, to a degree, insurers.  Rather, they are generally
             characterized as prepaid health care plans, quantity purchasers of health care services.  [In] a real and legal sense, the Blue
             Shield Plans are agents of their member physicians."" Id., at 480 (citations and footnote omitted). With respect to the question whether the alleged Blue Shield combination was ""in restraint of trade,"" the Court of Appeals agreed
             with the District Court that the rule of reason was applicable, but held that the District Court had erred in finding no liability.  The
             Court of Appeals observed that psychologists and psychiatrists compete in the psychotherapy market, and that the decisions of
             Blue Shield ""necessarily dictate, to some extent,"" who will be chosen to provide psychotherapy. Id., at 485. Finding that Blue
             Shield's policy of denying reimbursement for the psychotherapeutic services of psychologists unless billed through physicians,
             was not merely a cost-containment device or simply ""good medical practice,"" as claimed by Blue Shield, the court held that Blue
             Shield had violated the Sherman Act.  Ibid. "

             exempt from the antitrust laws as part of the ""business of insurance."" In ruling on petitioners' motion to dismiss, the District Court
             concluded that respondent had adequately pleaded a boycott beyond the protection of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C.
             § 1013(b).  Respondent points out that on a full factual record the issue was resolved against the petitioners in VACP, 624 F.2d,
             at 483-484. The Court of Appeals did not address this question in the present case, however, and we do not reach it here."
1183 ,8     ," Addressing the ""target area"" limitation on antitrust standing recognized in several Courts of Appeals, see n. 14, infra, the court
             concluded that the policies underlying that limitation were not implicated by McCready's claim.  649 F.2d, at 231-232. The
             dissenting judge took a contrary view of the ""target area"" rule.  He emphasized that McCready had not described her injury ""as a
             design or goal of any antitrust violation,"" but ""rather as a consequence thereof."" Id., at 232. He viewed this as the determinative
             factor in the proper application of the ""target area"" test to the facts of this case: ""In determining who has standing to sue, the courts must look at who the illegal act was aimed to injure.  A bystander, who is not
             the intended victim of the antitrust violation but who is injured nonetheless, cannot sue under the antitrust laws. His injury is too
             remote."" Id., at 233. In addition, the dissent argued that McCready was not within the sector of the economy ""competitively endangered"" by the
             alleged violation, agreeing with the District Court that ""she operated in a market which was unrestrained so far as she was
             concerned."" Id., at 234. Finally, the dissent reasoned: ""The price of psychologists' services to her was not increased by any act of the defendants.  The fact that her Blue Shield
             contract . . . would not reimburse her for those services had nothing to do with the price she paid for the services, which . . . were
             not artificially inflated by an antitrust violation. . . . "". . . There is not even a claim that her psychologists' bills are higher than they would have been had the conspiracy not existed.""

             damage action, that plaintiff was damaged thereby are all the law requires"")."
1184 ,10    ," Permitting McCready to maintain this lawsuit will, of course, further certain basic objectives of the private enforcement scheme
             embodied in § 4.  Only by requiring violators to disgorge the ""fruits of their illegality"" can the deterrent objectives of the antitrust
             laws be fully served.  Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, 494 (1968). See Pfizer Inc. v. India,
             434 U.S. 308, 314 (1978); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 746 (1977). But in addition to allowing Blue Shield to retain a
             palpable profit as a result of its unlawful plan, denying standing to McCready and the class she represents would also result in
             the denial of compensation for injuries resulting from unlawful conduct. "
1185 ,11    ," If there is a subordinate theme to our opinions in Hawaii and Illinois Brick, it is that the feasibility and consequences of
             implementing particular damages theories may, in certain limited circumstances, be considered in determining who is entitled to
             prosecute an action brought under § 4.  Where consistent with the broader remedial purposes of the antitrust laws, we have
             sought to avoid burdening § 4 actions with damages issues giving rise to the need for ""massive evidence and complicated
             theories,"" where the consequence would be to discourage vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws by private suits.  Hanover
             Shoe, Inc. v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., supra, at 493. Thus we recognized that the task of disentangling overlapping
             damages claims is not lightly to be imposed upon potential antitrust litigants, or upon the judicial system.  See Hawaii v.
             Standard Oil Co., 405 U.S. 251, 264 (1972); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, supra, at 741-742. In addition, while ""[difficulty] of
             ascertainment [should not be] confused with right of recovery,"" Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.S. 251, 265 (1946), §
             4 plainly focuses on tangible economic injury.  It may therefore be appropriate to consider whether a claim rests at bottom on
             some abstract conception or speculative measure of harm.  See Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., supra, at 262-263, n. 14. But like
             the policy against duplicative recoveries, our cautious approach to speculative, abstract, or impractical damages theories has no
             application to McCready's suit.  The nature of her injury is easily stated: As the result of an unlawful boycott, Blue Shield failed to
             pay the cost she incurred for the services of a psychologist. Her damages were fixed by the plan contract and, as the Court of
             Appeals observed, they could be ""ascertained to the penny."" 649 F.2d, at 231. "
1186 ,12    ," We addressed two issues of ""remoteness"" in Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 395 U.S. 642 (1969). That case involved an alleged
             violation of § 2 of the Clayton Act, as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 13. Focusing on the substantive
             terms of § 2, we found no warrant in its ""language or purpose"" to engraft an ""artificial"" limitation on the reach of the remedy to
             bar what the court below had termed a ""fourth level"" injury.  395 U.S., at 648. We also rejected the claim that one form of
             damages claimed by the defendant was not the proximate result of the alleged violation.  Id., at 649. The Courts of Appeals have developed a more substantial jurisprudence on the subject of ""remoteness,"" formulating various
             ""tests"" as aids in analysis.  Among the tests employed by the lower courts are those that focus on the ""directness"" of the injury,
             e. g., Loeb v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F. 704, 709 (CA3 1910); Productive Inventions, Inc. v. Trico Products Corp., 224 F.2d
             678 (CA2 1955); Volasco Products Co. v. Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co., 308 F.2d 383 (CA6 1962); on its foreseeability, e. g., In re
             Western Liquid Asphalt Cases, 487 F.2d 191, 199 (CA9 1973); Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d 190, 220
             (CA9 1964); or on whether the injury is ""arguably . . . within the zone of interests protected by the [antitrust laws],"" e. g.,
             Malamud v. Sinclair Oil Corp., 521 F.2d 1142, 1152 (CA6 1975). See also n. 14, infra (""target area"" test).  The Third Circuit has
             concluded that ""§ 4 standing analysis is essentially a balancing test comprised of many constant and variable factors and that
             there is no talismanic test capable of resolving all § 4 standing problems."" Bravman v. Basset Furniture Industries, Inc., 552 F.2d
             90, 99 (1977). The Third Circuit has thus rejected the definitional approach, opting instead for an analysis of the ""factual matrix""
             presented by each case.  Ibid.  We have no occasion here to evaluate the relative utility of any of these possibly conflicting
             approaches toward the problem of remote antitrust injury."
1186 ,13    ," The traditional principle of proximate cause suggests the use of words such as ""remote,"" ""tenuous,"" ""fortuitous,"" ""incidental,"" or
             ""consequential"" to describe those injuries that will find no remedy at law.  See, e. g., South Carolina Council of Milk Producers,
             Inc. v. Newton, 360 F.2d 414, 419 (CA4 1966). And the use of such terms only emphasizes that the principle of proximate cause
             is hardly a rigorous analytic tool.  See, e. g., Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N. Y. 339, 162 N. E. 99 (1928); id., at 351-352,
             162 N. E., at 103 (Andrews, J., dissenting) (""What is a cause in a legal sense, still more what is a proximate cause, depend in
             each case upon many considerations. . . .  What we do mean by the word 'proximate' is, that because of convenience, of public
             policy, of a rough sense of justice, the law arbitrarily declines to trace a series of events beyond a certain point"").  It bears
             affirming that in identifying the limits of an explicit statutory remedy, legislative intent is the controlling consideration.  Cf. Merrill
             Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Curran, 456 U.S. 353, 377-378 (1982); Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National
             Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U.S. 1, 13 (1981); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 15-16 (1979). "
1187 ,14    ," In so arguing, petitioners advert to the ""target area"" test of antitrust standing that prevails in the Courts of Appeals for the First,
             Second, and Fifth Circuits.  See, e. g., Pan-Islamic Trade Corp. v. Exxon Corp., 632 F.2d 539, 546 (CA5 1980); Engine
             Specialties, Inc. v. Bombardier Ltd., 605 F.2d 1, 18-19 (CA1 1979); Calderone Enterprises Corp. v. United Artists Theatre
             Circuit, Inc., 454 F.2d 1292 (CA2 1971). Petitioners place special reliance on the following frequently cited formulation of the
             ""target area"" principle: ""[In] order to have 'standing' to sue for treble damages under § 4 of the Clayton Act, a person must be within the 'target area' of
             the alleged antitrust conspiracy, i. e., a person against whom the conspiracy was aimed, such as a competitor of the persons
             sued.  Accordingly we have drawn a line excluding those who have suffered economic damage by virtue of their relationships
             with 'targets' or with participants in an alleged antitrust conspiracy, rather than being 'targets' themselves."" Id., at 1295."
1187 ,15    ," Nor does the ""target area"" test applied by the Courts of Appeals ""'imply that it must have been a purpose of the conspirators to
             injure the particular individual claiming damages.'"" See Schwimmer v. Sony Corp. of America, 637 F.2d 41, 47-48 (CA2 1980),
             quoting Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Goldwyn, 328 F.2d, at 220."
1187 ,16    ," Petitioners borrow selectively from Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477 (1977), in arguing that
             McCready's § 4 claim is ""unrelated to any reduction in competition caused by the alleged boycott,"" because the injury she
             alleges ""is the result of the terms of her insurance contract, and not the result of a reduction in competition."" Brief for Petitioners
             16.  Extracting additional language from Brunswick, they argue that ""McCready would have suffered the identical 'loss' -- but no
             compensable 'injury' as long as her employer, which acted independently in an unrestrained market, continued to purchase a
             group insurance contract that did not cover the services of clinical psychologists."" Brief for Petitioners 16-17 (footnote omitted). "
1188 ,17    ," Nor do we think that her employer's decision to retain Blue Shield coverage despite its continued failure to reimburse for the
             services of a psychologist -- or indeed, her employer's unexercised option to terminate that relationship -- is an intervening cause
             of McCready's injury.  Although her employer's decision to purchase the Blue Shield plan for her benefit was in some sense a
             factor that contributed independently to McCready's injury, her coverage under the Blue Shield plan may, at this stage of the
             litigation, properly be accepted as a given, and the proper focus in evaluating her entitlement to raise a § 4 damages claim is on
             Blue Shield's change in the terms of the plan to link reimbursement to a subscriber's choice of one group of psychotherapists
             over another."
1188 ,18    ," 649 F.2d, at 236 (Widener, J., dissenting). "
1189 ,19    ," Brunswick held that a claim of injury arising from the preservation or enhancement of competition is a claim ""inimical to the
             purposes of [the antitrust] laws,"" 429 U.S., at 488. Most obviously, McCready's claim is quite unlike the claim asserted by the
             plaintiff in Brunswick for she does not seek to label increased competition as a harm to her.  Nevertheless, we agree with
             petitioners that the relationship between the claimed injury and that which is unlawful in the defendant's conduct, as analyzed in
             Brunswick, is one factor to be considered in determining the redressability of a particular form of injury under § 4."
1189 ,20    ," Or at the least, Blue Shield sought to compel McCready to employ the services of a physician in addition to those of a
             psychologist."
1189 ,21    ," JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting, is of course correct in asserting that the ""injury suffered by the plaintiff must be of the type
             the antitrust laws were intended to forestall,"" post, at 486.  But JUSTICE REHNQUIST's dissent takes an unrealistically narrow
             view of those injuries with which the antitrust laws might be concerned, and offers not the slightest hint -- beyond sheer ipse dixit
             -- to help in determining what kinds of injury are not amenable to § 4 redress. For example, the dissent acknowledges that ""a
             distributor who refused to go along with the retailers' conspiracy [to injure a disfavored retailer] and thereby lost the conspiring
             retailers' business would . . . have an action against those retailers,"" post, at 490.  The dissent characterizes this circumstance
             as a ""concerted refusal to deal,"" and is thus willing to acknowledge the existence of compensable injury.  But the dissent's is not
             the only pattern of concerted refusals to deal.  If a group of psychiatrists conspired to boycott a bank until the bank ceased
             making loans to psychologists, the bank would no doubt be able to recover the injuries suffered as a consequence of the "
1190 ,      ," psychiatrists' actions.  And plainly, in evaluating the reasonableness under the antitrust laws of the psychiatrists' conduct, we
             would be concerned with its effects not only on the business of banking, but also on the business of the psychologists against
             whom that secondary boycott was directed. McCready and the banker and the distributor are in many respects similarly situated.  McCready alleges that she has been the
             victim of a concerted refusal by psychiatrists to reimburse through the Blue Shield plan.  Because McCready is a consumer,
             rather than some other type of market participant, the dissent finds itself unwilling to acknowledge that she might have suffered a
             form of injury of significance under the antitrust laws. But under the circumstances of this case, McCready's participation in the
             market for psychotherapeutic services provides precisely that significance. "
1191 ,1     ," In addition to the antitrust claim, McCready's complaint asserts a claim for breach of contract under the principles of pendent
             jurisdiction.  App. 57-58.  She also alleges that Blue Shield's policy contravened state law.  Id., at 55-56."
1191 ,2     ," The Court explains that those subscribers, such as McCready, who did not yield to Blue Shield's coercive pressures suffer from
             Blue Shield's sanctions by way of increased costs in obtaining the services of a psychologist. Those subscribers who did yield to
             Blue Shield's pressure suffer antitrust injury indirectly because of suppressed competition in the psychotherapy market.  Ante, at
             483-484.  I do not understand the Court to conclude that Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977), would not bar recovery
             by a subscriber, as opposed to a psychologist, in the latter situation."
1191 ,3     ," The Court suggests a third theory -- that McCready has standing herself as a target of a concerted refusal to deal.  See ante, at
             484, n. 21; infra, at 490-491."
1191 ,4     ," In order to recover under this theory, it would seem that respondent must prove at trial that she actually refused to yield to the
             economic pressure created by Blue Shield's reimbursement policy.  If she decided to obtain the services of a psychologist rather
             than a psychiatrist without knowing of Blue Shield's policy, it cannot be said that her ""injury"" was proximately related to
             petitioners' alleged anticompetitive conduct.  If she discovered the policy only after she sought reimbursement, then it cannot be
             said that Blue Shield's policy had any effect on McCready's conduct as a consumer in the market for psychotherapeutic services.
             This, of course, is not to say that a person in all circumstances must have knowledge of a defendant's anticompetitive activities
             before one may challenge that activity.  One may not be a victim of economic pressure, however, if one acted obliviously to that
             pressure. "
1192 ,5     ," By excluding psychologists from the market, psychiatrists may well be able to increase their charges for psychotherapeutic
             services, which in turn, may raise the insurance rates charged by Blue Shield. McCready, however, alleges no such injury to
             herself on this theory."
1192 ,6     ," Because McCready obtained the services of a psychologist, it cannot be said that the psychologists were injured by the
             economic pressure Blue Shield placed on McCready and the class of subscribers she represents.  See ante, at 475."
1192 ,7     ," As pointed out by the Court, a concerted refusal to deal may take many forms.  Ante, at 484, n. 21.  I would agree that the bank
             could sue in the Court's hypothetical because, as conceded by the Court, the bank's ability to compete with other banks would
             be adversely affected.  By contrast, my disagreement with the Court is that it permits McCready to sue solely because of an
             injury to a level of the market in which she does not participate.  Moreover, McCready does not allege that petitioners' conspiracy
             adversely affected competition between psychologists and psychiatrists in such a manner as to adversely affect the price or
             supply of psychotherapeutic services available to her as a consumer. Thus, McCready's case is clearly distinguishable from that
             of the bank's in the Court's hypothetical. "
1193 ,8     ," If McCready's injury were truly ""inextricably intertwined"" with any injury actually suffered by the psychologists, the risk of
             duplicative recovery and the practical problems inherent in distinguishing the loss suffered by her from the loss suffered by the
             psychologists may mean that either subscribers or psychologists, but not both, may recover.  See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431
             U.S. 720 (1977)."
1193 ,1     ," ""Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue
             therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without
             respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a
             reasonable attorney's fee."" 15 U. S. C. § 15. "
1194 ,2     ," In Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, we held that antitrust injury was limited to ""'the type of loss that
             the claimed violations . . . would be likely to cause.'"" Id., at 489 (quoting Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 395 U.S.
             100, 125). I would expect that the alleged violation in this case would be most likely to cause knowledgeable members of the
             class of potential consumers of psychotherapeutic services to exercise either the first or the second option.  It is fair to assume
             that the third situation -- the one in which respondent finds herself -- would be ""unlikely"" to result."
1194 ,3     ," The subscriber may have to undergo more extensive treatment later if he forgoes treatment now and his illness worsens.  Any
             consequential economic injury, however, would no more constitute antitrust injury than the economic injury suffered by a
             consumer who decides to forgo a purchase on the ground that the price of the goods or services was fixed at an artificially high
             level."
1194 ,4     ," If treatment by a psychiatrist and treatment by a psychologist were fungible, then a subscriber who exercised this third option
             effectively would be paying twice for the psychotherapeutic service, once to the insurer in premiums and once to the
             psychologist in an unreimbursable payment.  But the subscriber's exercise of this option presumably indicates that treatment by
             a psychologist is more valuable to him than treatment by a psychiatrist. If that be true, the subscriber is in the same situation as
             any policyholder who desires a service for which he has not purchased insurance."
1194 ,5     ," If the subscriber would purchase a service that was covered by the Blue Shield policy, such as a surgical operation, then he
             would be reimbursed by Blue Shield for that payment.  If respondent's antitrust claim is that petitioners have engaged in an
             unlawful boycott, it therefore is manifest that respondent is not the boycottee.  For petitioners have not refused to deal with
             respondent -- they offer her the same coverage as any other subscriber or potential subscriber."
1194 ,6     ," Presumably, the charge (if any) of the referring physician would be reimbursable under the policy.  In any event, the complaint
             does not claim damages based on any such unreimbursed charge. "

1203 ,4     ," The court then turned to the Act's second requirement, that the challenged practices be ""regulated by state law."" The court held
             that that requirement had been met, as well, observing that New York had ""enacted a pervasive scheme of regulation and
             supervision of insurance,"" had prohibited ""the unfair settlement of claims,"" and had proscribed ""the conduct alleged in the
             complaint"" in its state antitrust law, the Donnelly Act, which by its terms applied to insurers. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 81-389,
             pp. 31a-32a.  Finally, the court determined that respondent had neither alleged a ""boycott"" on petitioners' part, nor offered
             evidentiary support for such a claim.  Id., at 33a-35a.  The court thus concluded that the Act's third requirement was satisfied in
             the present case, and that petitioners' actions were consequently ""exempt from application of the antitrust laws."" Id., at 36a."
1203 ,5     ," Since it reached this conclusion, the Court of Appeals did not definitively address the other holdings of the District Court.  See
             n. 4, supra. The court did note, however, that petitioner NYSCA did not itself ""appear to be regulated by state law in the manner
             § 2(b) requires."" 650 F.2d, at 390, n. 5."
1203 ,6     ," As noted by the Court of Appeals, id., at 395, n. 13, the decision below is contrary to that of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
             Circuit ""in a factually identical case."" See Bartholomew v. Virginia Chiropractors Assn., 612 F.2d 812 (1979). "
1204 ,7     ," As the Court explained: ""'It is characteristic of insurance that a number of risks are accepted, some of which involve losses, and that such losses are
             spread over all the risks so as to enable the insurer to accept each risk at a slight fraction of the possible liability upon it.' 1 G.
             Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law § 1:3 (2d ed. 1959).  See also R. Keeton, Insurance Law § 1.2(a) (1971) ('Insurance is an
             arrangement for transferring and distributing risk'); 1 G. Richards, The Law of Insurance § 2 (W. Freedman 5th ed. 1952)."" 440
             U.S., at 211 (footnote omitted). "
1207 ,8     ," The premise of the dissent is that NYSCA's Peer Review Committee actually constitutes ""the claims adjustor"" in these cases.
             See post, at 137.  From this premise the dissent reasons that since ""claims adjustment is part and parcel of the 'business of
             insurance' protected by the McCarran-Ferguson Act,"" post, at 138, it necessarily follows that the peer review practices at issue in
             these cases must enjoy the Act's exemption. The fatal flaw in this syllogism is that NYSCA's Peer Review Committee is not the
             claims adjustor.  As the Court of Appeals noted: ""Opinions of the committee are not binding unless the parties agree beforehand
             that they will be."" 650 F.2d, at 388. Thus in a case such as the present ones, ULL is perfectly free to disregard the Committee's
             evaluation.  Even if ULL were to act upon the Committee's opinion, the nonbinding nature of the Committee's evaluation means
             that, at most, peer review is merely ancillary to the claims adjustment process.  We see no reason that such ancillary activities
             must necessarily enjoy the McCarran-Ferguson exemption from the antitrust laws. Unlike activities that occur wholly within the
             insurance industry -- such as the claims adjustment process itself -- the ancillary peer review practices at issue in these cases
             ""involve parties wholly outside the insurance industry."" See Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S., at 231.
             Thus peer review falls afoul of the third Royal Drug criterion in a way in which pure claims adjustment activities cannot."
1207 ,9     ," This conclusion renders it unnecessary for us to address the questions whether the conduct challenged in respondent's

1209 ,2     ," Other commentators agree with this assessment of the importance of claims settlement: ""The adjustment (including payment) of claims represents the final act in the insurance process.  The payment of a claim by an
             insurance company brings the insurance contract 'to life' in a fashion far more vivid than does any other single act in connection
             with the purchase, issuance, and maintenance of the contract."" Butler, Loss Adjustment in Fire Insurance, in Property and
             Liability Insurance Handbook 219 (J. Long & D. Gregg eds. 1965). ""Claim administration is the last link in the process of insurance -- a process that begins with actuarial analysis and continues
             through sales, underwriting, investment, and policy service. . . .  [The] expectation of the policyowner that an insurer is willing to
             meet its obligations, through claims administration, is an important part in the decision to purchase insurance.  Indeed, it is the
             claim administration function that delivers on the product sold to the policyowner."" C. Cissley, Claim Administration: Principles
             and Practices iii (1980)."
1209 ,3     ," Apparently unable to discern the difference between a mere method of paying a claim and the more fundamental process of
             determining whether a claim is covered by the insurance agreement, the Court finds that petitioners' peer review procedure
             ""resembles the Pharmacy Agreements in Royal Drug."" Ante, at 131.  But the Pharmacy Agreement at issue in Royal Drug was
             simply a method of reimbursing policyowners for medication expenses.  The policyowners could obtain medication from
             participating pharmacies simply by paying the amount that otherwise would not be covered by the insurance plan.  The
             pharmacies thus constituted nothing more than in-kind dispensers of insurance payments; they played no role whatsoever in the
             more fundamental process of assessing the validity of a claim and determining the amount to be paid.  Peer review committees,
             which fulfill such a fundamental role, are thus quite unlike the arrangements considered by the Court in Royal Drug. "

             subcontract only with subcontractors who had not signed with the Unions."" Id., at 531 (emphasis added).  Again using the word

             they were rewarded with business they would not otherwise have obtained.  Thus, nonunion firms could not be considered
             victims of the conspiracy; rather, they appear to have been its indirect beneficiaries.  None are named either as defendants or as
             co-conspirators. The amended complaint also does not allege any restraint on competition in the market for labor union services.  Unlike the two

             previous price-fixing cases had involved agreements among sellers to fix sales prices, the Court readily concluded that the Act

             person, or is under contract obligation on his account, and the injury consists only in impairing the ability or inclination of such
             person to perform his part, or in increasing the plaintiff's expense or labor of fulfilling such contract, unless the wrongful act is
             willful for that purpose."" Thus, A, who had agreed with a town to support all the town paupers for a specific period, in return for a

             stopped the company's machinery, and a creditor could not recover against a person who had forged a note, causing diminution
             in the dividends from an estate.  1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55-56 (1882) (emphasis in original, footnote omitted). Similarly, in contract, the common-law courts drew a distinction between direct and consequential damages; the latter had to be

             616 (1975). The plaintiff in that case, a general building contractor, was coerced by the defendant union into signing an
             agreement not to deal with nonunion subcontractors. Similarly, in the McCready case, the plaintiff was the direct victim of
             unlawful coercion. As the Court noted, ""McCready did not yield to Blue Shield's coercive pressure, and bore Blue Shield's
             sanction in the form of an increase in the net cost of her psychologist's services."" 457 U.S., at 483. Her status was thus
             comparable to that of a contracting or subcontracting firm that refused to yield to the defendants' coercive practices and
             therefore suffered whatever sanction that coercion imposed.  Like McCready, and like Connell Construction Co., such a firm
             could maintain an action against the defendants.  In contrast, the Union is neither a participant in the market for construction
             contracts or subcontracts nor a direct victim of the defendants' coercive practices.  We therefore need not decide whether the
             direct victim of a boycott, who suffers a type of injury unrelated to antitrust policy, may recover damages when the ultimate
             purpose of the boycott is to restrain competition in the relevant economic market."
1230 ,45    ," Its brief merely echoes the Court of Appeals' description of its allegations: ""the Unions have been injured in their business, i.
             e., organizing carpentry industry employees, negotiating and policing collective bargaining agreements, and securing jobs for
             their members."" Brief for Respondents 25-26."
1230 ,46    ," Because of the absence of specific allegations, we can only speculate about the specific components of the Union's claim.  If
             the Union asserts that its attempts to organize previously nonunion firms have been frustrated because nonunion firms wish to
             continue to obtain business from those subjected to coercion by the defendants, its harm stems most directly from the conduct of
             persons who are not victims of the conspiracy. See n. 14, supra.  If the Union claims that dues payments were adversely
             affected because employees had less incentive to join the Union in light of expanding nonunion job opportunities, its damage is
             more remote than the harm allegedly suffered by unionized subcontractors. The same is true if the Union contends that
             revenues from dues payments declined because its members lost jobs or wages because their unionized employers lost
             business.  That harm, moreover, is even more indirect than the already indirect injury to its members, yet a number of decisions
             have denied standing to employees with merely derivative injuries.  See, e. g., Pitchford v. PEPI, Inc., 531 F.2d 92, 97 (CA3),
             cert. denied, 426 U.S. 935 (1976); Contreras v. Grower Shipper Vegetable Assn., 484 F.2d 1346 (CA9 1973), cert. denied, 415

1230 ,47    ," Indeed, if there is substance to the Union's claim, it is difficult to understand why these direct victims of the conspiracy have
             not asserted any claim in their own right.  The Union's suggested explanations of this fact tend to shed doubt on the proposition
             that these ""victims"" were actually harmed at all. ""Many unionized firms will respond to the alleged boycott . . . by setting up double-breasted operations or shifting more of their
             resources to the non-unionized part of their operations when double-breasted operations already exist.  In this manner,
             unionized subcontractors can avoid losing any business and, as a result, these subcontractors will not 'possess the classic
             economic incentive to file suit.' Alternatively, unionized subcontractors may simply not renew the collective bargaining agreement

             and take twenty years in order to get a result as to a single one of them.  The Judiciary Committee did not think it wise to do that
             sort of thing, because we were in earnest about the business, as I know my friend is."" 21 Cong. Rec. 3148 (1890). See also id., at 3149 (remarks of Senator Morgan opposing same amendment: ""There is as much harm in trying to do too much

             Response, 52 Antitrust L. J. 651, 664-665 (1983). For example, the House Report on the Clayton Act stated: ""The public is compelled to pay a higher price and local customers are put to the inconvenience of securing many commodities
             in other communities or through mail-order houses that can not be procured at their local stores.  The price is raised as an
             inducement.  This is the local effect.  Where the concern making these contracts is already great and powerful, such as the
             United Shoe Machinery Co., the American Tobacco Co., and the General Film Co., the exclusive or 'tying' contract made with
             local dealers becomes one of the greatest agencies and instrumentalities of monopoly ever devised by the brain of man.  It
             completely shuts out competitors, not only from trade in which they are already engaged, but from the opportunities to build up
             trade in any community where these great and powerful combinations are operating under this system and practice.  By this
             method and practice the Shoe Machinery Co. has built up a monopoly that owns and controls the entire machinery now being
             used by all great shoe-manufacturing houses of the United States.  No independent manufacturer of shoe machines has the
             slightest opportunity to build up any considerable trade in this country while this condition obtains.  If a manufacturer who is
             using machines of the Shoe Machinery Co. were to purchase and place a machine manufacturered by any independent
             company in his establishment, the Shoe Machinery Co. could under its contracts withdraw all their machinery from the
             establishment of the shoe manufacturer and thereby wreck the business of the manufacturer.  The General Film Co., by the "
1252 ,      ," same method practiced by the Shoe Machinery Co. under the lease system, has practically destroyed all competition and
             acquired a virtual monopoly of all films manufactured and sold in the United States.  When we consider contracts of sales made
             under this system, the result to the consumer, the general public, and the local dealer and his business is even worse than under
             the lease system."" H. R. Rep. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 12-13 (1914). Similarly, Representative Mitchell said: ""[Monopoly] has been built up by these 'tying' contracts so that in order to get one
             machine one must take all of the essential machines, or practically all.  Independent companies who have sought to enter the
             field have found that the markets have been preempted. . . .  The manufacturers do not want to break their contracts with these
             giant monopolies, because, if they should attempt to install machinery, their business might be jeopardized and all of the
             machinery now leased by these giant monopolies would be removed from their places of business.  No situation cries more
             urgently for relief than does this situation, and this bill seeks to prevent exclusive 'tying' contracts that have brought about a
             monopoly, alike injurious to the small dealers, to the manufacturers, and grossly unfair to those who seek to enter the field of
             competition and to the millions of consumers."" 51 Cong. Rec. 9090 (1914)."

             proscription is meant to guard is the use of power over one product to attain power over another, or otherwise to distort freedom
             of trade and competition in the second product.  This distortion injures the buyers of the second product, who because of their
             preference for the seller's brand of the first are artificially forced to make a less than optimal choice in the second.  And even if
             the customer is indifferent among brands of the second product and therefore loses nothing by agreeing to use the seller's brand
             of the second in order to get his brand of the first, such tying agreements may work significant restraints on competition in the
             tied product.  The tying seller may be working toward a monopoly position in the tied product and, even if he is not, the practice
             of tying forecloses other sellers of the tied product and makes it more difficult for new firms to enter that market.  They must be
             prepared not only to match existing sellers of the tied product in price and quality, but to offset the attraction of the tying product
             itself.  Even if this is possible through simultaneous entry into production of the tying product, entry into both markets is
             significantly more expensive than simple entry into the tied market, and shifting buying habits in the tied product is considerably
             more cumbersome and less responsive to variations in competitive offers.  In addition to these anticompetitive effects in the tied
             product, tying arrangements may be used to evade price control in the tying product through clandestine transfer of the profit to
             the tied product; they may be used as a counting device to effect price discrimination; and they may be used to force a full line of
             products on the customer so as to extract more easily from him a monopoly return on one unique product in the line."" Fortner I,

             that this particular land was often prized by those who purchased or leased it and was frequently essential to their business

             not necessarily imply that advertisers bought separate and distinct products when insertions were placed in the Times-Picayune
             and the States.  So to conclude here would involve speculation that advertisers bought space motivated by considerations other
             than customer coverage; that their media selections, in effect, rested on generic qualities differentiating morning from evening
             readers in New Orleans.  Although advertising space in the Times-Picayune, as the sole morning daily, was doubtless essential
             to blanket coverage of the local newspaper readership, nothing in the record suggests that advertisers viewed the city's
             newspaper readers, morning or evening, as other than fungible customer potential.  We must assume, therefore, that the

             in neither the Times-Picayune nor the States can be bought alone, one may be viewed as 'tying' as the other); no leverage in
             one market excludes sellers in the second, because for present purposes the products are identical and the market the same.""

             whether two separate products are in fact involved.  In the usual sale on credit the seller, a single individual or corporation,
             simply makes an agreement determining when and how much he will be paid for his product.  In such a sale the credit may
             constitute such an inseparable part of the purchase price for the item that the entire transaction could be considered to involve
             only a single product.  It will be time enough to pass on the issue of credit sales when a case involving it actually arises.  Sales
             such as that are a far cry from the arrangement involved here, where the credit is provided by one corporation on condition that
             a product be purchased from a separate corporation, and where the borrower contracts to obtain a large sum of money over and
             above that needed to pay the seller for the physical products purchased.  Whatever the standards for determining exactly when

1257 ,33    ," Professor Dam has pointed out that the per se rule against tying can be coherent only if tying is defined by reference to the

             se rule, have attempted to flee from that economic question by ruling that tying arrangements are presumptively harmful, at least
             whenever certain nominal threshold standards on power and foreclosure are met.  The weakness of the per se methodology is
             that it places crucial importance on the definition of the practice.  Once an arrangement falls within the defined limits, no
             justification will be heard.  But a per se rule gives no economic standards for defining the practice.  To treat the definitional
             question as an abstract inquiry into whether one or two products is involved is thus to compound the weakness of the per se
             approach."" Dam, supra n. 23, at 19."

             consequences, not on whether it can be labeled ""tying."" If the competitive consequences of this arrangement are not those to

1257 ,36    ," Testimony that patients and their physicians frequently do differentiate between hospital services and anesthesiological
             services, and request specific anesthesiologists, was provided by Dr. Roux, Tr. 17, 20 (May 15, 1980, afternoon session), Dr.
             Hyde, id., at 68-69, 72-74 (May 16, 1980), and other anesthesiologists as well, see id., at 64, 87-88 (May 15, 1980, afternoon
             session) (testimony of Dr. Charles Eckert); id., at 25-30, 33-34 (May 16, 1980) (testimony of Dr. John Adriani).  There was no
             testimony that patients or their surgeons do not differentiate between anesthesiological services and hospital services when
             making purchasing decisions.  As a statistical matter, only 27 percent of anesthesiologists have financial relationships with
             hospitals.  American Medical Association, Socioeconomic Characteristics of Medical Practice: 1983, p. 12 (1983).  In this respect "
1258 ,      ," anesthesiologists may differ from radiologists, pathologists, and other types of hospital-based physicians (HBPs).  ""In some
             respects anesthesiologists are more akin to office-based MDs (particularly surgeons) than other HBPs.  Anesthesiologists'
             outputs are more discrete, and these HBPs are predominantly fee-for-service practitioners who directly provide services to
             patients."" Steinwald, Hospital-Based Physicians: Current Issues and Descriptive Evidence, Health Care Financing Rev. 63, 69

             (""By 1957 the salaried anesthesiologist had become the exception.  Anesthesiologists began to establish independent practices
             and were able to obtain hospital privileges upon the same terms and conditions as other clinicians"")."
1258 ,37    ," Accordingly, in its conclusions of law the District Court treated the case as involving a tying arrangement. 513 F.Supp., at 542."
1258 ,38    ,Petitioners do not challenge these findings of the District Court and the Court of Appeals.
1258 ,39    ," One of the most frequently cited statements on this subject was made by Judge Van Dusen in United States v. Jerrold
             Electronics Corp., 187 F.Supp. 545 (ED Pa. 1960), aff'd, 365 U.S. 567 (1961) (per curiam).  While this statement was specifically
             made with respect to § 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C. § 14, its analysis is also applicable to § 1 of the Sherman Act, since with
             respect to the definition of tying the standards used by the two statutes are the same.  See Times-Picayune, 345 U.S., at 608-
             609. ""There are several facts presented in this record which tend to show that a community television antenna system cannot
             properly be characterized as a single product.  Others who entered the community antenna field offered all of the equipment
             necessary for a complete system, but none of them sold their gear exclusively as a single package as did Jerrold.  The record
             also establishes that the number of pieces in each system varied considerably so that hardly any two versions of the alleged
             product were the same.  Furthermore, the customer was charged for each item of equipment and not a lump sum for the total
             system.  Finally, while Jerrold had cable and antennas to sell which were manufactured by other concerns, it only required that
             the electronic equipment in the system be bought from it."" 187 F.Supp., at 559. The record here shows that other hospitals often permit anesthesiological services to be purchased separately, that
             anesthesiologists are not fungible in that the services provided by each are not precisely the same, that anesthesiological
             services are billed separately, and that the hospital required purchases from Roux even though other anesthesiologists were
             available and Roux had no objection to their receiving staff privileges at East Jefferson.  Therefore, the Jerrold analysis indicates
             that there was a tying arrangement here.  Jerrold also indicates that tying may be permissible when necessary to enable a new
             business to break into the market.  See id., at 555-558. Assuming this defense exists, and assuming it justified the 1971 Roux
             contract in order to give Roux an incentive to go to work at a new hospital with an uncertain future, that justification is
             inapplicable to the 1976 contract, since by then Roux was willing to continue to service the hospital without a tying arrangement."
1258 ,40    ," This is not to say that § 1 of the Sherman Act gives a purchaser the right to buy a product that the seller does not wish to offer
             for sale.  A grocer may decide to carry four brands of cookies and no more.  If the customer wants a fifth brand, he may go
             elsewhere but he cannot sue the grocer even if there is no other in town.  However, in such a case the customer is free to
             purchase no cookies at all, while buying other needed food.  If the grocer required the customer to buy an unwanted brand of
             cookies in order to buy other items which the customer needs and cannot readily obtain elsewhere, then a tying question arises.
             Cf. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S., at 7 (grocer selling flour can require customers to also buy sugar only ""if
             its competitors were ready and able to sell flour by itself"").  Here, the question is whether patients are forced to use an unwanted
             anesthesiologist in order to obtain needed hospital services. "
1259 ,41    ," An examination of the reason or reasons why petitioners denied respondent staff privileges will not provide the answer to the
             question whether the package of services they offered to their patients is an illegal tying arrangement. As a matter of antitrust
             law, petitioners may give their anesthesiology business to Roux because he is the best doctor available, because he is willing to
             work long hours, or because he is the son-in-law of the hospital administrator without violating the per se rule against tying.
             Without evidence that petitioners are using market power to force Roux upon patients there is no basis to view the arrangement
             as unreasonably restraining competition whatever the reasons for its creation.  Conversely, with such evidence, the per se rule
             against tying may apply.  Thus, we reject the view of the District Court that the legality of an arrangement of this kind turns on
             whether it was adopted for the purpose of improving patient care."
1259 ,42    ," Petitioners argue and the District Court found that the exclusive contract had what it characterized as procompetitive
             justifications in that an exclusive contract ensures 24-hour anesthesiology coverage, enables flexible scheduling, and facilitates
             work routine, professional standards, and maintenance of equipment.  The Court of Appeals held these findings to be clearly
             erroneous since the exclusive contract was not necessary to achieve these ends.  Roux was willing to provide 24-hour coverage
             even without an exclusive contract and the credentials committee of the hospital could impose standards for staff privileges that
             would ensure staff would comply with the demands of scheduling, maintenance, and professional standards.  686 F.2d, at 292.
             In the past, we have refused to tolerate manifestly anticompetitive conduct simply because the health care industry is involved.
             See Arizona v. Maricopa Medical Society, 457 U.S., at 348-351; National Gerimedical Hospital v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S. 378
             (1981); American Medical Assn. v. United States, 317 U.S. 519, 528-529 (1943). Petitioners seek no special solicitude.  See n.
             12, supra.  We have also uniformly rejected similar ""goodwill"" defenses for tying arrangements, finding that the use of
             contractual quality specifications are generally sufficient to protect quality without the use of a tying arrangement. See Standard
             Oil Co. of California v. United States, 337 U.S., at 305-306; International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S., at 397-398;
             International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S., at 138-140. See generally Comment, Tying Arrangements
             under the Antitrust Laws: The ""Integrity of the Product"" Defense, 62 Mich. L. Rev. 1413 (1964). Since the District Court made no
             finding as to why contractual quality specifications would not protect the hospital, there is no basis for departing from our prior
             cases here."
1259 ,43    ," In fact its position in this market is not dissimilar from the market share at issue in Times-Picayune, which the Court found
             insufficient as a basis for inferring market power.  See 345 U.S., at 611-613. Moreover, in other antitrust contexts this Court has
             found that market shares comparable to that present here do not create an unacceptable likelihood of anticompetitive conduct.
             See United States v. Connecticut National Bank, 418 U.S. 656 (1974); United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 351
             U.S. 377 (1956). "
1260 ,44    ," The Court of Appeals acknowledged that absent these market imperfections, there was no basis for applying the per se rule
             against tying. ""The contract at issue here involved only one hospital out of at least twenty in the area.  Under the analysis applied
             to a truly competitive market, appellant has failed to prove an illegal tying arrangement."" 686 F.2d, at 290."
1260 ,45    ," Congress has found these market imperfections to exist.  See National Gerimedical Hospital v. Blue Cross, 452 U.S., at 388,
             n. 13, 391-393, and n. 18; 42 U. S. C. §§ 300k, 300k-2(b); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 96-420, pp. 57-58 (1979); S. Rep. No. 96-96, pp.
             52-53 (1979)."
1260 ,46    ," As an economic matter, market power exists whenever prices can be raised above the levels that would be charged in a
             competitive market.  See Fortner II, 429 U.S., at 620; Fortner I, 394 U.S., at 503-504."
1260 ,47    ," Nor is there an indication in the record that petitioners' practices have increased the social costs of their market power.  Since
             patients' anesthesiological needs are fixed by medical judgment, respondent does not argue that the tying arrangement
             facilitates price discrimination.  Where variable-quantity purchasing is unavailable as a means to enable price discrimination,
             commentators have seen less justification for condemning tying. See Dam, supra n. 23, at 15-17; Turner, supra n. 21, at 67-72.
             While tying arrangements like the one at issue here are unlikely to be used to facilitate price discrimination, they could have the
             similar effect of enabling hospitals ""to evade price control in the tying product through clandestine transfer of the profit to the tied
             product. . . ."" Fortner I, 394 U.S., at 513 (WHITE, J., dissenting).  Insurance companies are the principal source of price restraint
             in the hospital industry; they place some limitations on the ability of hospitals to exploit their market power.  Through this
             arrangement, petitioners may be able to evade that restraint by obtaining a portion of the anesthesiologists' fees and therefore
             realize a greater return than they could in the absence of the arrangement.  This could also have an adverse effect on the
             anesthesiology market since it is possible that only less able anesthesiologists would be willing to give up part of their fees in
             return for the security of an exclusive contract. However, there are no findings of either the District Court or the Court of Appeals
             which indicate that this type of exploitation of market power has occurred here.  The Court of Appeals found only that Roux's use
             of nurse anesthetists increased its and the hospital's profits, but there was no finding that nurse anesthetists might not be used
             with equal frequency absent the exclusive contract. Indeed, the District Court found that nurse anesthetists are utilized in all
             hospitals in the area.  513 F.Supp., at 537, 543. Moreover, there is nothing in the record which details whether this arrangement
             has enhanced the value of East Jefferson's market power or harmed quality competition in the anesthesiology market. "
1261 ,48    ," While there was some rather impressionistic testimony that the prevalence of exclusive contracts tended to discourage young
             doctors from entering the market, the evidence was equivocal and neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals made any
             findings concerning the contract's effect on entry barriers.  Respondent does not press the point before this Court.  It is possible
             that under some circumstances an exclusive contract could raise entry barriers since anesthesiologists could not compete for
             the contract without raising the capital necessary to run a hospitalwide operation.  However, since the hospital has provided
             most of the capital for the exclusive contractor in this case, that problem does not appear to be present."
1261 ,49    ," While it is true that purchasers may not be fully sensitive to the price or quality implications of a tying arrangement, so that
             competition may be impeded, see n. 24, supra, this depends on an empirical demonstration concerning the effect of the
             arrangement on price or quality, and the record reveals little if anything about the effect of this arrangement on the market for
             anesthesiological services."
1261 ,50    ," If, as is likely, it is the patient's doctor and not the patient who selects an anesthesiologist, the doctor can simply take the
             patient elsewhere if he is dissatisfied with Roux.  The District Court found that most doctors in the area have staff privileges at
             more than one hospital.  513 F.Supp., at 541."
1261 ,51    ," LEdHN[17B][
             ] [17B] The effect of the contract, of course, has been to remove the East Jefferson Hospital from the market open to Roux's
             competitors. Like any exclusive-requirements contract, this contract could be unlawful if it foreclosed so much of the market from
             penetration by Roux's competitors as to unreasonably restrain competition in the affected market, the market for
             anesthesiological services.  See generally Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320 (1961); Standard Oil Co. of
             California v. United States, 337 U.S. 293 (1949). However, respondent has not attempted to make this showing."
1261 ,52    ," The record simply tells us little if anything about the effect of this arrangement on price or quality of anesthesiological services.
             As to price, the arrangement did not lead to an increase in the price charged to the patient. 686 F.2d, at 291. As to quality, the
             record indicates little more than that there have never been any complaints about the quality of Roux's services, and no
             contention that his services are in any respect inferior to those of respondent.  Moreover, the self-interest of the hospital, as well
             as the ethical and professional norms under which it operates, presumably protect the quality of anesthesiological services.  See
             Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, Accreditation Manual for Hospitals 3-10, 151-154 (1983). "
1262 ,53    ," See App. A to Brief for American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc., as Amicus Curiae."
1262 ,54    ," The claims raised by respondent but not passed upon by the Court of Appeals remain open on remand.  See n. 2, supra. "
1263 ,1     ," This inquiry has been required in analyzing both the prima facie case and affirmative defenses.  Most notably, United States v.
             Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F.Supp. 545, 559-560 (ED Pa. 1960), aff'd per curiam, 365 U.S. 567 (1961), upheld a requirement
             that buyers of television systems purchase the complete system, as well as installation and repair service, on the grounds that
             the tie assured that the systems would operate and thereby protected the seller's business reputation."
1263 ,2     ," Tying law is particularly anomalous in this respect because arrangements largely indistinguishable from tie-ins are generally
             analyzed under the rule of reason.  For example, the ""per se"" analysis of tie-ins subjects restrictions on a franchisee's freedom to
             purchase supplies to a more searching scrutiny than restrictions on his freedom to sell his products.  Compare, e. g., Siegel v.
             Chicken Delight, Inc., 448 F.2d 43 (CA9 1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 955 (1972), with Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania
             Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977). And exclusive contracts that, like tie-ins, require the buyer to purchase a product from one seller are
             subject only to the rule of reason.  See infra, at 44-45. "
1264 ,3     ," See n. 4, infra."
1264 ,4     ," Tying might be undesirable in two other instances, but the hospital-Roux arrangement involves neither one. In a regulated industry a firm with market power may be unable to extract a supercompetitive profit because it lacks control over
             the prices it charges for regulated products or services.  Tying may then be used to extract that profit from sale of the
             unregulated, tied products or services.  See Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 513 (1969)
             (WHITE, J., dissenting). Tying may also help the seller engage in price discrimination by ""metering"" the buyer's use of the tying product.  Cf. International
             Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S. 131 (1936); International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392 (1947).
             Price discrimination may be independently unlawful, see 15 U. S. C. § 13. Price discrimination may, however, decrease rather
             than increase the economic costs of a seller's market power.  See, e. g., R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 398 (1978); P. Areeda,
             Antitrust Analysis 608-610 (3d ed. 1981); O. Williamson, Markets and Hierarchies: Analysis and Antitrust Implications 11-13
             (1975).  United States Steel Corp. v. Fortner Enterprises, Inc., 429 U.S. 610, 617 (1977) (Fortner II), did not hold that price
             discrimination in the form of a tie-in is always economically harmful; that case indicated only that price discrimination may
             indicate market power in the tying-product market.  But there is no need in this case to address the problem of price
             discrimination facilitated by tying. The discussion herein is aimed only at tying arrangements as to which no price discrimination
             is alleged."
1264 ,5     ," Wholly apart from market characteristics, a prerequisite to application of the Sherman Act is an effect on interstate commerce.
             See, e. g., McLain v. Real Estate Board of New Orleans, 444 U.S. 232, 246 (1980); Burke v. Ford, 389 U.S. 320, 322 (1967). It
             is not disputed that such an impact is present here."
1264 ,6     ," The Court has failed in the past to define how much market power is necessary, but in the context of this case it is
             inappropriate to attempt to resolve that question.  In International Salt Co. v. United States, supra, the Court assumed that a
             patent conferred market power and therefore sufficiently established ""the tendency of the arrangement to accomplishment of
             monopoly."" Id., at 396.  In its next tying case, Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594 (1953), the Court
             distinguished International Salt in part by finding that there was no market ""dominance,"" 345 U.S., at 610-613, after a careful "
1265 ,      ," consideration of the relevant market.  Then, in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 6-8, 11 (1958), the Court
             required only a minimal showing of market power.  More recently, in Fortner II, supra, the Court conducted a more extensive
             analysis of whether the tie was actually an exercise of market power, considering such factors as the size and profitability of the
             firm seeking to impose the tie, the character of the tying product, and the effects of the tie -- the price charged for the products,
             the number of customers affected, the functional relation between the tied and tying product."
1265 ,7     ," A common misconception has been that a patent or copyright, a high market share, or a unique product that competitors are
             not able to offer suffices to demonstrate market power.  While each of these three factors might help to give market power to a
             seller, it is also possible that a seller in these situations will have no market power: for example, a patent holder has no market
             power in any relevant sense if there are close substitutes for the patented product.  Similarly, a high market share indicates
             market power only if the market is properly defined to include all reasonable substitutes for the product.  See generally Landes &
             Posner, Market Power in Antitrust Cases, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 937 (1981). Nor does any presumption of market power find support in our prior cases.  Although United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.,
             334 U.S. 131 (1948), considered the legality of ""block-booking"" of motion pictures, which ties the purchase of rights to
             copyrighted motion pictures to purchase of other motion pictures of the same copyright holder, the Court did not analyze the
             arrangement with the schema of the tying cases.  Rather, the Court borrowed the patent law principle of ""patent misuse,"" which
             prevents the holder of a patent from using the patent to require his customers to purchase unpatented products.  Id., at 156-159.
             See, e. g., Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., 320 U.S. 661, 665 (1944). The ""patent misuse"" doctrine may have
             influenced the Court's willingness to strike down the arrangement at issue in International Salt as well, although the Court did not
             cite the doctrine in that case."
1265 ,8     ," Whether the tying product is one that consumers might wish to purchase without the tied product should be irrelevant.  Once it
             is conceded that the seller has market power over the tying product it follows that the seller can sell the tying product on
             noncompetitive terms.  The injury to consumers does not depend on whether the seller chooses to charge a supercompetitive
             price, or charges a competitive price but insists that consumers also buy a product that they do not want."
1265 ,9     ," Cf. Areeda, supra n. 4, at 735; Ross, The Single Product Issue in Antitrust Tying: A Functional Approach, 23 Emory L. J. 963,

1266 ,10    ," The examination of the economic advantages of tying may properly be conducted as part of the rule-of-reason analysis, rather
             than at the threshold of the tying inquiry.  This approach is consistent with this Court's occasional references to the problem.
             The Court has not heretofore had occasion to set forth any general criteria for determining when two apparently separate
             products are components of a single product for tying analysis.  In Times-Picayune Publishing Co., the Court held that
             advertising space in a morning newspaper was the same product as advertising space in the evening newspaper -- access to
             readership of the respective newspapers -- because the subscribers had no reason to distinguish among the readers of the two
             papers.  345 U.S., at 613-616. In Fortner I, the Court, reversing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, rejected the
             contention that credit could never be separate from the product for whose purchase credit was extended.  394 U.S., at 506-507.
             The Court disclaimed any determination of ""the standards for determining exactly when a transaction involves only a single
             product."" Id., at 507. These cases indicate that consideration of whether a buyer might prefer to purchase one component
             without the other is one of the factors in tying analysis and, more generally, that economic analysis rather than mere
             conventional separability into different markets should determine whether one or two products are involved in the alleged tie. "

             finds no contradiction in the record. "
1268 ,13    ," The Court of Appeals disregarded the benefits of the tie because it found that there were less restrictive means of achieving
             them.  In the absence of an adequate basis to expect any harm to competition from the tie-in, this objection is simply irrelevant. "

             examination, Ronwin named all seven members in his original complaint.  Apparently, three of the original defendants to this
             action did not join, for reasons not apparent, the petition for certiorari in this Court.  There is no claim that these members of the
             Committee failed to participate in or dissented from the actions of the Committee."
1276 ,2     ," The procedure in Arizona is not unique to that State.  In recent years, the burgeoning number of candidates for admission to
             practice law and the increased complexity of the subjects that must be tested have combined to make grading and
             administration of bar examinations a burdensome task.  As a result, although the highest court in each State retains ultimate
             authority for granting or denying admission to the bar, each of those courts has delegated to a subordinate committee
             responsibility for preparing, grading, and administering the examination.  See F. Klein, S. Leleiko, & J. Mavity, Bar Admission
             Rules and Student Practice Rules 30-33 (1978)."
1276 ,3     ," The parties disagree on the wording of the Rules at the time Ronwin took the bar examination. The disagreement centers
             around the effective date of some amendments promulgated in 1974.  Petitioners contend that the amendments took effect
             before Ronwin took the February 1974 bar examination; Ronwin submits that they became effective in March 1974.  Ronwin
             concedes that the Supreme Court order amending the Rules provided that the amendments would become effective in January
             1974.  Notwithstanding this directive, he argues that Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 12-109 (1982) provided that amendments to the
             Supreme Court's Rules may not become effective until 60 days after publication and distribution.  Since the Supreme Court
             released the amendments on January 11, Ronwin submits that the earliest possible effective date was March 12. LEdHN[2B][

             proceedings in state courts.  By its terms, the statute did not limit the jurisdiction of the Arizona Supreme Court to establish the
             terms of admission to practice law in the State.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 32-275 (1976)."

1277 ,5     ," According to Ronwin's complaint, the Committee announced before the February examination that the passing grade on the
             test would be 70, but it assigned grades using a scaled scoring system.  Under this system, the examinations were graded first
             without reference to any grading scale.  Thus, each examination was assigned a ""raw score"" based on the number of correct
             answers.  The Committee then converted the raw score into a score on a scale of zero to 100 by establishing the raw score that

             of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 361 (1977), the Court noted that HN4[

             interest of the States in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of

1280 ,19    ," Ronwin's complaint, see supra, at 565, focuses on the grading formula as the means used to ""restrain competition."" He
             describes it as follows: ""The Defendants did not grade on a Zero to One Hundred (0 to 100) scale; rather they used a ""raw score"" system.  After the raw
             scores were known, the Defendants picked a particular raw score value as equal to the passing grade of Seventy (70).  Thereby "
1281 ,      ," the number of Bar applicants who would receive a passing grade depended upon the exact raw score value chosen as equal to
             Seventy (70); rather than achievement by each Bar applicant of a pre-set standard."" App. 10. Apparently Ronwin was trying to describe a ""procedure commonly known as test standardization"" or ""scaled scoring."" See Brief
             for State Bar of California as Amicus Curiae 7.  This method of scoring, viewed as the fairest by the Educational Testing Service
             (ETS) for the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), see S. Duhl, The Bar Examiners' Handbook 61-62 (2d ed. 1980), published by
             The National Conference of Bar Examiners, is described as follows: ""In addition to the 'raw' scores (number of correct answers), ETS reports a 'scaled' score for each applicant.  In a series of tests,
             such as the MBE, which are intended to measure levels of competence, it is important to have a standardized score which
             represents the same level of competence from test to test.  The raw score is not dependable for this purpose since the level of
             difficulty varies from test to test.  It is not possible to draft two tests of exactly the same level of difficulty.  Scaled scores are
             obtained by reusing some questions from earlier tests which have been standardized.  A statistical analysis of the scores on the
             reused questions determines how many points are to be added to or subtracted from the raw score to provide an applicant's
             scaled score. Thus a particular scaled score represents the same level of competence from examination to examination."""
1281 ,20    ," Although the Court of Appeals recognized the similarity between this case and Bates, it found the facts in Goldfarb v. Virginia
             State Bar, supra, to be more analogous.  The court's reliance on Goldfarb was misplaced.  As the dissent of Judge Ferguson
             noted, Goldfarb involved procedures that were not approved by the State Supreme Court or the state legislature. In contrast,
             petitioners here performed functions required by the Supreme Court Rules and that are not effective unless approved by the

             Committee complied with this Rule.  For purposes of determining the application of the state-action doctrine, it is sufficient that
             the Rules contained an enforceable provision calling for submission of the grading formula. Moreover, the Rules contained a
             review procedure that allowed an aggrieved applicant to bring to the Supreme Court's attention any failure of the Committee to
             comply with the filing requirements in Rule 28(c) VII B.  The record reveals that Ronwin, in fact, alleged in his petition for review
             in the Arizona Supreme Court that the Committee had not filed its grading formula within the time provided in the Rule.  The

             Arizona Supreme Court.  Contrary to the Solicitor General's suggestion, our reasoning in Boulder supports the conclusion we
             reach today.  In Boulder, we reiterated the analysis of JUSTICE BRENNAN's opinion in Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light

             state-action immunity, but only ""to the extent that they [act] pursuant to a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state
             policy."" Id., at 54; see also Lafayette, supra, at 411-412 (opinion of BRENNAN, J.).  Consistent with our reasoning in Boulder,
             our decision today rests on our conclusion that the conduct Ronwin complains of clearly is the action of the State.  Bates is
             explicit authority for this conclusion. "

             more clearly defined than the role of that court in Bates.  In that case, State Bar Committee members were not appointed by the

             purpose of reducing the total number of lawyers admitted to practice, the court knew and approved the number of applicants.
             This was the definitive action.  There is nothing in the state-action doctrine, or in antitrust law, that permits us to question the
             motives for the sovereign action of the court. "

             retain full authority over, and responsibility for, the bar admissions process."
1284 ,30    ," The dissent states, post, at 591-592, n. 15, that we ""advanced the theory that the relevant 'state action'"" was the State
             Supreme Court's denial of Ronwin's postexamination petitions filed with the court.  (Emphasis supplied.) The dissent is
             inaccurate.  Our holding is based on the court's direct participation in every stage of the admissions process, including retention
             of the sole authority to admit or deny.  The critical action in this case was the court's decision to deny Ronwin admission to the
             Bar.  The dissent's suggestion that the Arizona Supreme Court never made this decision simply ignores Arizona law.  The
             Arizona Supreme Court has stated on several occasions that it, and not the Committee, makes the decision to admit or deny
             admission to applicants.  In Application of Burke, 87 Ariz., at 338, 351 P. 2d, at 171-172, the court stated: ""[It] is not the function of the committee to grant or deny admission to the bar.  That power rests solely in the Supreme Court. . . .
             The committee's bounden duty is to 'put up the red flag' as to those applicants about whom it has some substantial doubt.  If
             such doubt exists, then its recommendation should be withheld.  The applicant may feel that any questions raised as to his
             character or qualifications are without substance.  In such case, he may apply directly to this court for admission.  In the final
             analysis -- it being a judicial function -- we have the duty of resolving those questions, one way or the other. . . ."" (Emphasis
             supplied.) In a similar vein, the court stated in Application of Levine, 97 Ariz. 88, 92, 397 P. 2d 205, 207 (1964): ""If the committee fails to recommend the admission of an applicant, he may challenge the committee's conclusions by an original
             application to this Court. . . .  This Court will direct the committee to show cause why the applicant has been refused a favorable
             recommendation and on the applicant's petition and the committee's response, using our independent judgment, de novo
             determine whether the necessary qualifications have been shown."" See also Application of Kiser, 107 Ariz. 326, 327, 487 P. 2d 393, 394 (1971). Thus, the Arizona Supreme Court repeatedly has affirmed its responsibility as the final decisionmaker on admissions to the Bar.
             The dissent, relying on the absence in the record before us of a specific order of the court at the time Ronwin was not admitted,
             nevertheless would have us hold that the Committee rather than the court made the final decisions as to admissions and denials
             of the applicants who took the examination in February 1974.  If the dissent were correct, there would have been no valid action
             with respect to those who took that examination since, under Arizona law, the Committee had no independent power to act.
             Ronwin's complaint makes no such extreme averment, and certainly this Court will not assume that the Supreme Court of
             Arizona failed to discharge its responsibility.  Moreover, as we have noted, supra, at 576-577, Ronwin's claims were specifically
             rejected by the court. "
1285 ,31    ," It is true, of course, that framing examination questions and particularly the grading of the examinations involved the exercise
             of judgment and discretion by the examiners.  This discretion necessarily was delegated to the Arizona Committee, just as it
             must be unless state supreme courts themselves undertake the grading. By its Rules, the Arizona Supreme Court gave
             affirmative directions to the Committee with respect to every nondiscretionary function, reserving the ultimate authority to control
             the number of lawyers admitted to the Arizona Bar.  Ronwin avers a ""conspiracy to limit the number"" of applicants admitted.  He
             makes no claim of animus or discriminatory intent with respect to himself. Ronwin apparently would have us believe that grading examinations is an exact science that separates the qualified from the
             unqualified applicants.  Ideally, perhaps, this should be true.  But law schools and bar examining committees must identify a
             grade below which students and applicants fail to pass.  No setting of a passing grade or adoption of a grading formula can
             eliminate -- except on multiple choice exams -- the discretion exercised by the grader.  By its very nature, therefore, grading
             examinations does not necessarily separate the competent from the incompetent or -- except very roughly -- identify those
             qualified to practice law and those not qualified.  At best, a bar examination can identify those applicants who are more qualified
             to practice law than those less qualified."
1285 ,32    ," JUSTICE STEVENS' dissent states that ""[any] possible claim that the challenged conduct is that of the State Supreme Court is
             squarely foreclosed by Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773 (1975)."" Post, at 589.  At issue in Goldfarb was a Sherman
             Act challenge to minimum-fee schedules maintained by the Fairfax County Bar Association and enforced by the Virginia State
             Bar.  In Goldfarb, state law did not refer to lawyers' fees, the Virginia Supreme Court Rules did not direct the State Bar to supply
             fee schedules, and the Supreme Court did not approve the fee schedules established by the State Bar.  To the contrary, the
             court ""directed lawyers not 'to be controlled' by fee schedules."" 421 U.S., at 789. Thus, even though the State Bar was a state
             agency, the Court concluded that ""it cannot fairly be said that the State of Virginia through its Supreme Court Rules required the
             anticompetitive activities of either respondent."" Id., at 790. As is evident from the provisions in the Arizona Supreme Court Rules,
             this case arises under totally different circumstances, although the relevant legal principles are the same.  The dissent's reliance
             on Goldfarb simply misreads the decision in that case."
1285 ,33    ," The dissent relies on Boulder, arguing that the ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy"" does not exist in
             this case.  Post, at 594-596.  What the dissent overlooks is that the Court in Boulder was careful to say that action is not ""exempt
             from antitrust scrutiny unless it constitutes the action of the State of Colorado itself in its sovereign capacity, see Parker, or
             unless it constitutes municipal action in furtherance or implementation of clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state
             policy, see City of Lafayette. . . ."" 455 U.S., at 52. Thus, unlike the dissent here, JUSTICE BRENNAN in Boulder was careful to
             distinguish between action by the sovereign itself and action taken by a subordinate body. The dissent also cites Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S. 579 (1976), and California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal
             Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97 (1980), as presenting situations analogous to the action of the Arizona Supreme Court.  This
             argument overlooks the fundamental difference between this case and the several cases cited by respondent.  In each of those
             cases, it was necessary for the Court to determine whether there had been a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state
             policy because the challenged conduct was not that of the State ""acting as sovereign."" Here, as we have noted above, the
             Arizona Supreme Court, acting in its sovereign capacity, made the final decision to deny admission to Ronwin.  See n. 30, supra. "
1286 ,34    ," The amicus curiae brief of the National Conference of Bar Examiners points out that many States have bar admission
             processes like those at issue in this case.  See Brief for National Conference of Bar Examiners as Amicus Curiae 1, 2, 8.
             Typically, the state supreme court is the ultimate decisionmaker and a committee or board conducts the examinations pursuant
             to court rules.  It is customary for lawyers of recognized standing and integrity to serve on these bodies, usually as a public duty
             and with little or no compensation.  See S. Duhl, The Bar Examiner's Handbook 95, 99 (2d ed. 1980).  In virtually all States, a
             significant percentage of those who take the bar examination fail to pass.  See 1982 Bar Examination Statistics, 52 Bar
             Examiner 24-26 (1983).  Thus, every year, there are thousands of aspirants who, like Ronwin, are disappointed.  For example, in
             1974 (the year Ronwin first took the Arizona bar examination), of the 43,798 applicants who took bar examinations nationwide,
             10,440 failed to pass.  44 Bar Examiner 115 (1975).  The National Conference of Bar Examiners, in its amicus brief, cautions
             that affirmance of the Court of Appeals in this case could well invite numerous suits.  It is no answer to say that, of course, such
             suits are likely to be frivolous.  Ronwin, who failed the bar in 1974, has been litigating his claim for a decade on the basis of a
             complaint that basically challenges the motive of the Arizona Committee.  His claim is that the grading formula was devised for
             the purpose of limiting competition.  If such an allegation is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, examining boards and
             committees would have to bear the substantial ""discovery and litigation burdens"" attendant particularly upon refuting a charge of
             improper motive.  See Areeda, Antitrust Immunity for ""State Action"" after Lafayette, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 435, 451 (1981). Moreover,
             Ronwin has brought a suit for damages under the Sherman Act, with the threat of treble damages.  There can be no question
             that the threat of being sued for damages -- particularly where the issue turns on subjective intent or motive -- will deter ""able
             citizens"" from performing this essential public service.  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814 (1982). In our view, as the
             action challenged by Ronwin was that of the State, the motive of the Committee in its recommendations to the court was
             immaterial.  We nevertheless think, particularly in view of the decision below, that the consequences of an affirmance should be
             understood.  The consequences of reversal by the Court today will have only a limited effect.  Our attention has not been drawn
             to any trade or other profession in which the licensing of its members is determined directly by the sovereign itself -- here the
             State Supreme Court. "

             the allegations of respondent's current complaint are taken as true then the fact that respondent failed the bar examination
             would have provided an adequate ground for the dismissal of respondent's complaint without any review of respondent's
             allegations.  Even if it were the case that the Arizona Supreme Court reviewed petitioner's complaint on its merits, all that would
             indicate is that the court has declined to exercise its power of revision with respect to petitioners' alleged anticompetitive policies.

             allegation that the challenged policy was adopted by the court; at most the court has permitted it by accepting the
             recommendations of petitioners.  Yet as Bates and Goldfarb make clear, the challenged policy must be required by the
             sovereign. The fact that the court retained the power to disapprove of the examination procedure adopted by petitioners is no
             different from the fact that the Virginia Supreme Court retained the power to disapprove of the fee schedules set by the bar
             association in Goldfarb.  Similar powers of revision were held insufficient to justify immunity in Lafayette, Cantor, and Midcal. "
1292 ,17    ," While the majority's disavowal in its note 30 is quite unequivocal, at other points in its opinion, see ante, at 576-577, and in its
             ultimate statement of its holding, see ante, at 582, it does seem to rely on the denial of respondent's petition for review.  If that
             truly is critical for the majority, then it would follow that an individual in respondent's position who did not file a petition for review
             would be able to mount an antitrust challenge free from the immunity barrier the majority erects.  If it indeed is that easy to

             address it, though that requires no more than brief reference to the Court of Appeals' opinion: ""Defendants contend for the first time on rehearing that the Committee's grading formula 'was submitted to the Court, reviewed
             by the Court, and accepted by the Court.' In response, Ronwin has tendered to this court what purports to be the letter the
             Committee filed with the Supreme Court on February 8, 1974 pursuant to Rule 28(c) (VII)(B).  If, as Ronwin alleges, the
             Committee scored the examination to admit a pre-determined number of applicants, the letter does not so advise the court.
             Accordingly, if the letter presented to us constitutes the submission to the Supreme Court, it cannot be the basis for a clearly
             articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy. Although dismissal might have been proper if the facts were as defendants
             now argue for the first time on rehearing, those facts were never brought to the district court's attention.  Dismissal was therefore

             the complaint was not sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.  See Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157-158, n.

             given, it may become apparent that the anticipated passing grade should be adjusted in order to provide roughly the same
             measure of competence as was used in prior years.  Thus respondent's burden of proving the conspiracy he has alleged

             inconsistent with the goals of the Sherman Act. Thus petitioners' claim of antitrust immunity arises in the least defensible context: ""[As] a general proposition . . . state-sanctioned anticompetitive activity must fall like any other if its potential harms outweigh its
             benefits.  This does not mean that state-sanctioned and private activity are to be treated alike.  The former is different because
             the fact of state sanction figures powerfully in the calculus of harm and benefit.  If, for example, the justification for the scheme
             lies in the protection of health or safety, the strength of that justification is forcefully attested to by the existence of a state
             enactment. . . .  A particularly strong justification exists for a state-sanctioned scheme if the State in effect has substituted itself
             for the forces of competition, and regulates private activity to the same ends sought to be achieved by the Sherman Act. Thus,
             an anticompetitive scheme which the State institutes on the plausible ground that it will improve the performance of the market in
             fostering efficient resource allocation and low prices can scarcely be assailed."" Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428 U.S., at 610-

             Crescent Amusement found violations of §§ 1 and 2 by film exhibitors affiliated (in most cases) by 50 percent ownership.  The
             exhibitors used the monopoly power they possessed in certain towns to force film distributors to give them favorable terms in
             other towns.  The Court found it unnecessary to view the distributors as part of the conspiracy, id., at 183, so the Court plainly
             viewed the affiliated entities themselves as the conspirators. The Crescent Amusement Court, however, in affirming an order of
             divestiture, noted that such a remedy was appropriate when ""creation of the combination is itself the violation."" Id., at 189. This
             suggests that both Crescent Amusement and Yellow Cab, which cited the very page on which this passage appears, stand for a
             narrow rule based on the original illegality of the affiliation. The dissent misconstrues a later passage in Crescent Amusement stating that divestiture need not be limited to those affiliates
             whose ""acquisition was part of the fruits of the conspiracy,"" 323 U.S., at 189. See post, at 780-781.  This meant only that
             divestiture could apply to affiliates other than those who were driven out of business by the practices of the original conspirators
             and who were then acquired illegally to increase the combination's monopoly power.  See 323 U.S., at 181. It did not mean that
             affiliates acquired for lawful purposes were subject to divestiture."

             condemned because of the absence of corporate integration."" 288 U.S., at 377. Appalachian Coals, however, validated a
             cooperative selling arrangement among independent entities. The statement that intracorporate relationships would be subject to
             liability under § 1 is thus dictum.  The statement may also envision merely the limited rule in Yellow Cab pertaining to

             distinction between unilateral and concerted conduct.  Followed by the Seventh Circuit below as well as by other Courts of
             Appeals, this test sets forth various criteria for evaluating whether a given parent and subsidiary are capable of conspiring with
             each other.  See n. 2, supra; see generally Ogilvie v. Fotomat Corp., 641 F.2d 581 (CA8 1981); Las Vegas Sun, Inc. v. Summa

             control of its day-to-day operations, separate officers, separate corporate headquarters, and so forth.  At least when a subsidiary
             is wholly owned, however, these factors are not sufficient to describe a separate economic entity for purposes of the Sherman
             Act. The factors simply describe the manner in which the parent chooses to structure a subunit of itself.  They cannot overcome
             the basic fact that the ultimate interests of the subsidiary and the parent are identical, so the parent and the subsidiary must be
             viewed as a single economic unit."
1313 ,19    ," Because an ""agreement"" between a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary is no more likely to be anticompetitive than an
             agreement between two divisions of a single corporation, it does not matter that the parent ""availed [itself] of the privilege of
             doing business through separate corporations,"" Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U.S. 134, 141 (1968).
             The purposeful choice of a parent corporation to organize a subunit as a subsidiary is not itself a reason to heighten antitrust
             scrutiny, because it is not laden with anticompetitive risk."
1313 ,20    ," For example, ""[separate] incorporation may reduce federal or state taxes or facilitate compliance with regulatory or reporting
             laws.  Local incorporation may also improve local identification.  Investors or lenders may prefer to specialize in a particular
             aspect of a conglomerate's business.  Different parts of the business may require different pension or profitsharing plans or
             different accounting practices."" Areeda, 97 Harv. L. Rev., at 453. "
1314 ,21    ," Sunkist Growers provides strong support for the notion that separate incorporation does not necessarily imply a capacity to
             conspire. The defendants in that case were an agricultural cooperative, its wholly owned subsidiary, and a second cooperative
             comprising only members of the first.  The Court refused to find a § 1 or § 2 conspiracy among them because they were ""one
             'organization' or 'association' even though they have formally organized themselves into three separate legal entities."" 370 U.S.,
             at 29. Although this holding derived from statutory immunities granted to agricultural organizations, the reasoning of Sunkist
             Growers supports the broader principle that substance, not form, should determine whether a separately incorporated entity is
             capable of conspiring under § 1."

             incompatibility of an intracorporate conspiracy with § 1 is sufficient to refute the dissent's suggestion that Congress intended to
             incorporate such a definition.  See post, at 784-787.  Moreover, it is far from clear that intracorporate conspiracies were
             recognized at common law in 1890.  Even today courts disagree whether corporate employees can conspire with themselves or
             with the corporation for purposes of certain statutes, such as 42 U. S. C. § 1985(3).  Compare, e. g., Novotny v. Great Am. Fed.
             Sav. & Loan Assn., 584 F.2d 1235 (CA3 1978) (en banc), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 442 U.S. 366 (1979), with
             Dombrowski v. Dowling, 459 F.2d 190 (CA7 1972). And in 1890 it was disputed whether a corporation could itself be guilty of a
             crime that required criminal intent, such as conspiracy. Commentators appear to agree that courts began finding corporate
             liability for such crimes only around the turn of the century.  See generally Edgerton, Corporate Criminal Responsibility, 36 Yale
             L. J. 827, 828, and n. 11 (1927); Miller, Corporate Criminal Liability: A Principle Extended to Its Limits, 38 Fed. Bar J. 49 (1979);
             Note, 60 Harv. L. Rev. 283, 284, and n. 9 (1946). Of course, Congress changed that common-law rule when it explicitly provided
             that a corporation could be guilty of a § 1 conspiracy. But the point remains that the Sherman Act did not import a pre-existing

             mere acquisitions. Indeed, the irony of the Court's approach is that, had it been adopted in 1890, it would have meant that § 1
             would have no application to trust combinations which had already been formed -- the very trusts to which Senator Sherman was
             referring. I cannot believe that the Court really intends to express doubt as to whether the Congress that passed the Sherman Act thought

             it suggests that the requirement has evidentiary significance: combinations are more likely to signal anticompetitive conduct than
             is unilateral activity: ""In any conspiracy, two or more entities that previously pursued their own interests separately are combining
             to act as one for their common benefit.  This not only reduces the diverse directions in which economic power is aimed but
             suddenly increases the economic power moving in one particular direction."" Ante, at 769.  That is true, but it is also true of any
             ordinary commercial contract between separate entities, as can be seen if one substitutes the word ""contract"" for ""conspiracy"" in
             the passage I have quoted.  The language of the Sherman Act indicates that it treats ""contracts"" and ""conspiracies"" as
             equivalent concepts -- both satisfy the multiplicity-of-actors requirement -- and yet one of the most fundamental points in antitrust
             jurisprudence, dating at least to Standard Oil, is that there is nothing inherently anticompetitive about a contract.  Similarly, an
             agreement to act ""for common benefit"" in itself is unremarkable -- all agreements are in some sense a restraint of trade be they
             contracts or conspiracies. It is only when trade is unreasonably restrained that § 1 is implicated.  The Court's evidentiary concern
             lacks merit."

             accomplished by a prohibited combination to suppress price competition if each customer, although induced to do so solely by a
             manufacturer's announced policy, independently decides to observe specified resale prices.  So long as Colgate is not
             overruled, this result is tolerated but only when it is the consequence of a mere refusal to sell in the exercise of a manufacturer's
             right 'freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.'"" Id., at 44 (quoting Colgate, 250

             will ultimately attract the courts.  If conduct of a single corporation which restrains trade were to violate Section 1, a forceful
             weapon would be available to the government with which to challenge conduct which in oligopolistic industries creates or
             reinforces entry barriers.  Excessive advertising in the cereal, drug, or detergent industries, annual style changes in the auto
             industry, and other such practices could be reached as soon as they threatened to inhibit competition; there would be no need to
             wait until a 'dangerous probability' of monopoly had been reached, the requirement under Section 2 'attempt' doctrine.  Nor
             would a single firm restraint of trade rule be overbroad.  It would in no way threaten single firm activity -- setting a price, deciding
             what market it would deal in, or the like -- which did not threaten competitive conditions."" L. Sullivan, supra n. 9, § 114, at 324

             communities.  All of the stores are managed as a unit by one individual, the founder of the business who sets policy, does all the
             buying, decides on all the advertising, sets prices, and hires and fires all employees other than family members.  The fact that
             each store is operated by a separate corporation should not convert a family business into a cartel. . . .  If there is, as a practical
             matter, an integrated ownership and management, this small business is a single firm.  And a single firm cannot compete with
             itself.  Hence it cannot restrain price competition with itself, or divide markets with itself, or act as a common purchasing agent
             for itself or otherwise restrain competition with itself, regardless of how many separate corporations the single firm may, for
             reasons unrelated to the act, be divided into."" L. Sullivan, supra n. 9, § 114, at 326-327."
1323 ,26    ," Thus, the Court is wrong to suggest, ante, at 771-772, 774-776, and n. 24, that Yellow Cab could reach truly unilateral conduct
             involving only the employees of a single firm."
1323 ,27    ," If the rule of Yellow Cab and its progeny could be easily circumvented through, for example, use of unincorporated divisions
             instead of subsidiaries, then there would be reason to question its efficacy as a tool for rational antitrust enforcement.  However,
             the Court is incorrect when it asserts, ante, at 770-771, 772-774, that there is no economic substance in a distinction between
             unincorporated divisions, which cannot provide a plurality of actors, and wholly owned subsidiaries, which under Yellow Cab
             can.  If that were the case, incorporated subsidiaries would never be used to achieve integration -- the ready availability of an
             unincorporated alternative would always be employed in order to avoid antitrust liability.  The answer is provided by the Court
             itself -- the use of subsidiaries often makes possible operating efficiencies that are unavailable through the use of unincorporated
             divisions.  Ante, at 772-774.  We may confidently assume that any corporate parent whose contingent antitrust liability exceeds
             the savings it realizes through the use of subsidiaries already utilizes unincorporated divisions instead of corporate subsidiaries.
             Thus, it is more than merely a question of form when a decision is made to use corporate subsidiaries instead of unincorporated
             divisions, and the rule is not that easily circumvented. "

             are needed.  Thus 'concerted action' by two 'legal persons' which is limited solely to the internal management of a single firm
             does not restrain competition; but 'concerted action' by two 'legal persons' which erects barriers to entry by another separate
             firm, a competitor or potential competitor, can be a restraint of trade""); see also Willis & Pitofsky, supra n. 9, at 38-41.  The
             Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws made the same point in 1955: ""The substance of the Supreme Court decisions is that concerted action between a parent and subsidiary or between
             subsidiaries which has for its purpose or effect coercion or unreasonable restraint on the trade of strangers to those acting in
             concert is prohibited by Section 1.  Nothing in these opinions should be interpreted as justifying the conclusion that concerted
             action solely between a parent and subsidiary or subsidiaries, the purpose and effect of which is not coercive restraint of the
             trade of strangers to the corporate family, violates Section 1.  Where such concerted action restrains no trade and is designed to
             restrain no trade other than that of the parent and its subsidiaries, Section 1 is not violated."" Attorney General's Committee

             no local competitors, were to deny advertising to a local business because the latter advertised in a rival newspaper, the
             integration between the two corporations, however close in terms of ownership or management or both, would not protect them
             from a charge of conspiracy to restrain trade. . . .  [The] concerted action here involved is not merely carrying on the business of

1343 ,29    ," ""It is clear from the evidence that were it not for the NCAA controls, many more college football games would be televised.
             This is particularly true at the local level.  Because of NCAA controls, local stations are often unable to televise games which
             they would like to, even when the games are not being televised at the network level.  The circumstances which would allow so-
             called exception telecasts arise infrequently for many schools, and the evidence is clear that local broadcasts of college football
             would occur far more frequently were it not for the NCAA controls.  This is not a surprising result.  Indeed, this horizontal
             agreement to limit the availability of games to potential broadcasters is the very essence of NCAA's agreements with the
             networks. The evidence establishes the fact that the networks are actually paying the large fees because the NCAA agrees to
             limit production.  If the NCAA would not agree to limit production, the networks would not pay so large a fee.  Because NCAA
             limits production, the networks need not fear that their broadcasts will have to compete head-to-head with other college football
             telecasts, either on the other networks or on various local stations.  Therefore, the Court concludes that the membership of
             NCAA has agreed to limit production to a level far below that which would occur in a free market situation."" 546 F.Supp., at

             maximum and actual price which will be paid to the schools appearing on ABC, CBS and TBS.  NCAA has created the
             mechanism which produces a uniform price for each national telecast, and a uniform price for each regional telecast. Because of
             the NCAA controls, the price which is paid for the right to televise any particular game is responsive neither to the relative quality
             of the teams playing the game nor to viewer preference. ""In a competitive market, each college fielding a football team would be free to sell the right to televise its games for whatever
             price it could get.  The prices would vary for the games, with games between prominent schools drawing a larger price than
             games between less prominent schools.  Games between the more prominent schools would draw a larger audience than other
             games. Advertisers would pay higher rates for commercial time because of the larger audience. The telecaster would then be
             willing to pay larger rights fees due to the increased prices paid by the advertisers.  Thus, the price which the telecaster would
             pay for a particular game would be dependent on the expected size of the viewing audience. Clearly, the NCAA controls grossly

             defined -- the NCAA television restrictions have reduced output, subverted viewer choice, and distorted pricing.  Consequently,

             product.  If, as the NCAA argues, see supra, at 111-112, all television programming is essentially fungible, it would not be

1350 ,      ," intercollegiate football. See 546 F.Supp., at 1310-1311. Moreover, the District Court's finding that there would be more local and
             regional telecasts without the NCAA controls means that Northwestern could well have generated more television income in a
             free market than was obtained under the NCAA regime."
1350 ,63    ," Indeed, the District Court found that the basic reason the television plan has endured is that the NCAA is in effect controlled by
             schools that are not restrained by the plan: ""The plaintiffs and other CFA members attempted to persuade the majority of NCAA members that NCAA had gone far beyond
             its legitimate role in football television. Not surprisingly, none of the CFA proposals were adopted.  Instead the membership
             uniformly adopted the proposals of the NCAA administration which 'legitimized' NCAA's exercises of power.  The result was not
             surprising in light of the makeup of the voting membership.  Of approximately 800 voting members of the NCAA, 500 or so are in
             Divisions II and III and are not subjected to NCAA television controls.  Of the 275 Division I members, only 187 play football, and

             local or regional markets would get more exposure if the plan is enjoined, enhancing their ability to compete for student athletes. "
1353 ,1     ," Television plans with similar features have been in place since 1951.  The 1951-1953 plans were submitted to the Antitrust

             litigation, has apparently never taken the position that the NCAA's television plans were unlawful. "
1354 ,2     ," This litigation was triggered by the NCAA's response to an attempt by the College Football Association (CFA), an organization
             of the more dominant football-playing schools and conferences, to develop an independent television plan.  To the extent that its
             plan contains features similar to those condemned as anticompetitive by the Court, the CFA may well have antitrust problems of
             its own.  To the extent that they desire continued membership in the NCAA, moreover, participation in a television plan
             developed by the CFA will not exempt football powers like respondents from the many kinds of NCAA controls over television

1369 ,      ," preclusion principles to conclude that a state judgment approving settlement of state antitrust claims barred a subsequent
             federal antitrust claim. Although our decision today indicates that the Court of Appeals should have looked in the first instance to
             state law to determine the preclusive effect of the state judgment, the same holding would result if application of state preclusion
             law suggests that the settlement bars the subsequent federal claim and if there is no exception to § 1738 in these
             circumstances.  Cf.  640 F.2d, at 487, n. 5 (noting that state law gives preclusive effect to consent judgment).  We, of course, do

1369 ,3     ," THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes that preclusion rules bar the splitting of a cause of action between a court of limited jurisdiction and
             one of general jurisdiction, and suggests that state requirements of jurisdictional competency may leave unclear whether a state
             court action precludes a subsequent federal antitrust claim. Post, at 388-390.  The rule that the judgment of a court of limited
             jurisdiction concludes the entire claim assumes that the plaintiff might have commenced his action in a court in the same system
             of courts that was competent to give full relief.  See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24, Comment g (1982).  Moreover,
             the jurisdictional competency requirement generally is understood to imply that state court litigation based on a state statute
             analogous to a federal statute, e. g., a state antitrust law, does not bar subsequent attempts to secure relief in federal court if
             the state court lacked jurisdiction over the federal statutory claim.  Id., § 26(1)(c), Illustration 2.  Although a particular State's
             preclusion principles conceivably could support a rule similar to that proposed by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 390-391, where
             state preclusion rules do not indicate that a claim is barred, we do not believe that federal courts should fashion a federal rule to
             preclude a claim that could not have been raised in the state proceedings. "

             general jurisdiction of the state, A brings his action for the damage to his car in a justice's court, which has jurisdiction in actions
             for damage to property but has no jurisdiction in actions for injury to the person.  Judgment is rendered for A for the damage to
             the car.  A cannot thereafter maintain an action against B to recover for the injury to his person arising out of the same collision."" See also 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure § 4412, p. 95 (1981), stating that the ""general
             rule"" in state courts is that ""[a] second action will not be permitted on parts of a single claim that could have been asserted in a
             court of broader jurisdiction simply because the plaintiff went first to a court of limited jurisdiction in the same state that could not
             hear them."" The holding in Lucas v. Le Compte, 42 Ill. 303 (1866), is similar to this ""general rule,"" but that holding was based on
             a construction of an Illinois statute, Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 59, § 35 (1845), which (a) has been repealed, see Act of Apr. 15, 1965,
             1965 Ill. Laws 331, and (b) had a broader preclusive effect than general Illinois res judicata doctrine has.  Clancey v. McBride,
             338 Ill. 35, 169 N. E. 729 (1929), involved the same circumstances as the above-quoted illustration from the Restatement.  The
             court resolved the case, however, without reference to the limited jurisdiction of the justice's court, by concluding that injury to
             the person and injury to property are distinct legal wrongs that can be the subject of separate lawsuits."
1372 ,4     ," By contrast, when a federal court construes substantive rights and obligations under state law in the context of a diversity

             relevant state law is ambiguous. "

1380 ,1     ,The City is located in both Eau Claire and Chippewa Counties.
1380 ,2     ," The complaint also alleged violations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U. S. C. § 1251 et seq., and of a common-
             law duty of a utility to serve.  The District Court dismissed these claims, and they are not at issue in this Court. "
1381 ,3     ," Midcal was originally brought as a mandamus action seeking an injunction against a state agency, the California Department of
             Alcoholic Beverage Control.  The State played no role, however, in setting prices or reviewing their reasonableness, activities
             carried out by the private wine dealers.  445 U.S., at 100-101. The mere fact that the state agency was a named defendant was
             not sufficient to alter the state action analysis from that appropriate to a case involving the state regulation of private
             anticompetitive acts.  See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference, Inc. v. United States, post, at 56-57. "
1382 ,4     ,There is no such order of the Department of Natural Resources at issue in this case.
1382 ,5     ," The Towns also rely on Wis. Stat. Ann. §§ 66.076(1) and 66.30 (1965 and Supp. 1984) to argue that the State's policy on the
             provision of sewage services is actually procompetitive.  This claim must fail because, aside from the fact that it was not raised
             below, the provisions relied upon do not support the contention.  First, it is true that § 66.076(1) permits certain municipalities,
             including towns, to operate sewage systems.  The provision is simply a general enabling statute, however, not a mandatory
             prescription.  In addition, subsection (8) of § 66.076 incorporates into the enabling statute all of the limitations of § 66.069,
             including the power to limit the area of service.  Thus, § 66.076(1) does not express a procompetitive state attitude. Nor does § 66.30 aid the Towns.  It is a general provision concerning all utilities -- not just sewage systems -- that permits
             municipalities to enter into cooperative agreements.  The statute is not mandatory, but merely permissive.  Moreover, even
             assuming two municipalities agreed pursuant to this section to cooperate in providing sewage services, the result would not
             necessarily be greater competition.  Rather, the two combined might well be more effective than either alone in keeping other
             municipalities out of the market. "
1383 ,6     ," Nor does it help the Towns' claim that the statutes leave to the City the discretion whether to provide sewage services.  States
             must always be free to delegate such authority to their political subdivisions."
1383 ,7     ," Requiring such a close examination of a state legislature's intent to determine whether the federal antitrust laws apply would be
             undesirable also because it would embroil the federal courts in the unnecessary interpretation of state statutes.  Besides
             burdening the courts, it would undercut the fundamental policy of Parker and the state action doctrine of immunizing state action
             from federal antitrust scrutiny.  See 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 212.3(b) (Supp. 1982)."
1383 ,8     ," Our view of the legislature's intent is supported by Town of Hallie v. City of Chippewa Falls, 105 Wis. 2d 533, 314 N. W. 2d 321
             (1982), in which the Supreme Court of Wisconsin rejected the Town of Hallie's challenge under state antitrust laws against the
             City of Chippewa Falls in a case quite similar to the one at bar.  There, the Town of Hallie argued that the City's refusal to
             provide it with sewage treatment services, the requirement of annexation, and the City's conditioning of the provision of
             treatment services on the acceptance also of sewage collection and other city services, violated the state antitrust laws. The
             State Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that the legislature intended the City to undertake the challenged actions.  Those
             actions therefore were exempt from the State's antitrust laws. Analyzing §§ 66.069(2)(c) and 144.07(1m), the court concluded
             that the legislature had ""viewed annexation by the city of a surrounding unincorporated area as a reasonable quid pro quo that a
             city could require before extending sewer services to the area."" Id., at 540-541, 314 N. W. 2d, at 325. Although the Wisconsin Supreme Court's opinion does not, of course, decide the question presented here of the City's immunity
             under the federal antitrust laws, it is instructive on the question of the state legislature's intent in enacting the statutes relating to
             the municipal provision of sewage services. "
1384 ,9     ," Among other things, municipal conduct is invariably more likely to be exposed to public scrutiny than is private conduct.
             Municipalities in some States are subject to ""sunshine"" laws or other mandatory disclosure regulations, and municipal officers,
             unlike corporate heads, are checked to some degree through the electoral process.  Such a position in the public eye may
             provide some greater protection against antitrust abuses than exists for private parties."
1384 ,10    ," In cases in which the actor is a state agency, it is likely that active state supervision would also not be required, although we
             do not here decide that issue.  Where state or municipal regulation by a private party is involved, however, active state
             supervision must be shown, even where a clearly articulated state policy exists.  See Southern Motor Carriers Rate Conference,

             South-Eastern Underwriters Assn., 322 U.S. 533 (1944), for the proposition that ""if exceptions are to be written into the Sherman
             Act, they must come from Congress, and not this Court."" Id., at 561. The dissent apparently finds some significance in the fact
             that no federal statute expressly exempts the petitioners' collective ratemaking activities from the antitrust laws. See post, at 70. The dissent's argument on this point, of course, does not suggest that compulsion should be a prerequisite to a finding of state
             action immunity. Instead, the logical result of its reasoning would require us to overrule Parker v. Brown and its progeny, for the
             state action doctrine is an implied exemption to the antitrust laws. After over 40 years of congressional acquiescence, we are
             unwilling to abandon the Parker doctrine. JUSTICE STEVENS relies primarily upon United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters, supra, and Georgia v. Pennsylvania R.
             Co., 324 U.S. 439 (1945), in the first section of his dissent.  Neither of these cases, however, has any bearing on the scope of
             Parker immunity. In South-Eastern Underwriters, supra, the Court held only that the ""business of insurance is interstate
             commerce,"" Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U.S. 205, 217 (1979), and thus is subject to the Sherman Act's
             proscriptions.  The Court did not suggest that, because of congressional silence, state regulation could not immunize insurance
             companies from the federal antitrust laws. Instead, it reasoned that Parker did not protect the insurance companies because ""no
             states authorize combinations of insurance companies to coerce, intimidate, and boycott competitors and consumers in the
             manner . . . [there] alleged."" 322 U.S., at 562. In Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., supra, the Court was concerned with whether
             Congress intended to immunize a federal regulatory program from the antitrust laws. See n. 21, infra."
1395 ,19    ," In holding that the States were free to regulate ""domestic commerce,"" the Parker Court relied upon congressional silence.
             There are, however, some statements in the legislative history that affirmatively express a desire not ""to invade the legislative
             authority of the several States. . . ."" H. R. Rep. No. 1707, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1890).  See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., 428
             U.S. 579, 632 (1976) (Stewart, J., dissenting). "
1396 ,20    ," As we hold today in Hallie v. Eau Claire, ante, at 46, the second prong of the Midcal test is inapplicable to municipalities.
             Although its anticompetitive conduct must be taken pursuant to a clearly articulated state policy, a municipality need not be
             supervised by the State in order to qualify for Parker immunity. See ante, at 46."
1396 ,21    ," The dissent argues that a state regulatory program is entitled to Parker immunity only if an antitrust exemption is ""'necessary .
             . . to make the [program] work. . . .'"" Post, at 74 (quoting Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., supra, at 597). This argument overlooks
             the fact that, with the exception of a questionable dictum in Cantor, supra, the dissent's proposed test has been used only in
             deciding whether Congress intended to immunize a federal regulatory program from the Sherman Act's proscriptions.  See, e. g.,
             Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U.S. 341, 357 (1963). In this context, if the federal courts wrongly conclude that an
             antitrust exemption is ""unnecessary,"" Congress can correct the error.  As the dissent recognizes, however, the Supremacy
             Clause would prevent state legislatures from taking similar remedial action.  Post, at 67.  Moreover, the proposed test would
             prompt the ""kind of interference with state sovereignty . . . that . . . Parker was intended to prevent."" 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner,
             Antitrust Law para. 214, p. 88 (1978).  Therefore, we hold that HN3[
             ] state action immunity is not dependent on a finding that
             an exemption from the federal antitrust laws is ""necessary."" "
1397 ,22    ," HN6[
             ] Under the Interstate Commerce Act, motor common carriers are permitted, but not compelled, to engage in collective interstate ratemaking. 49 U. S. C. §§ 10706(b)(2) and 10706(d)(2)(C).  It is clear, therefore, that Congress has recognized the
             advantages of a permissive policy.  We think it unlikely that Congress intended to prevent the States from adopting virtually
             identical policies at the intrastate level. "
1398 ,23    ," Contrary to the Government's arguments, our holding here does not suggest that a State may ""give immunity to those who
             violate the Sherman Act by authorizing them to violate it."" Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S., at 351; see Schwegmann Bros. v. Calvert
             Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384 (1951). A clearly articulated permissive policy will satisfy the first prong of the Midcal test.  The
             second prong, however, prevents States from ""casting . . . a gauzy cloak of state involvement over what is essentially a private
             price-fixing arrangement."" Midcal, 445 U.S., at 106. This active supervision requirement ensures that a State's actions will
             immunize the anticompetitive conduct of private parties only when the ""state has demonstrated its commitment to a program
             through its exercise of regulatory oversight."" See 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law § 213a, p. 73 (1978)."

1399 ,25    ," The Mississippi statute stands in sharp contrast to the Colorado Home Rule Amendment, which we considered in Community
             Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U.S. 40 (1982). In Boulder, the State Constitution gave municipalities extensive powers of
             self-government.  Id., at 43-44. Pursuant to this authority, the City of Boulder prohibited a cable television company from
             expanding its operations.  The Court held that because the Home Rule Amendment did not evidence an intent to displace
             competition in the cable television industry, id., at 55, Boulder's anticompetitive ordinance was not enacted pursuant to a clearly
             articulated state policy. This holding was premised on the fact that Boulder, as a ""home rule municipality,"" was authorized to
             elect free-market competition as an alternative to regulation. Id., at 56. In this case, on the other hand, the Mississippi Public Service Commission is not authorized to choose free-market competition.
             Instead, it is required to prescribe rates for motor common carriers on the basis of statutorily enumerated factors.  Miss. Code
             Ann. § 77-7-221 (1972).  These factors bear no discernible relationship to the prices that would be set by a perfectly efficient and
             unregulated market.  Therefore, the Mississippi statute clearly indicates that the legislature intended to displace competition in

             (1984), aff'd, post, p. 606.  Dismissing Sedima as the resurrection of the discredited requirement of an organized crime nexus,
             and Bankers Trust as an emasculation of the treble-damages remedy, the Seventh Circuit rejected ""the elusive racketeering
             injury requirement."" 747 F.2d, at 394, 398-399. The Fifth Circuit had taken a similar position.  Alcorn County v. U.S. Interstate
             Supplies, Inc., 731 F.2d 1160, 1169 (1984). The requirement of a prior RICO conviction was rejected in Bunker Ramo Corp. v. United Business Forms, Inc., 713 F.2d 1272,
             1286-1287 (CA7 1983), and USACO Coal Co. v. Carbomin Energy, Inc., 689 F.2d 94 (CA6 1982). See also United States v.
             Cappetto, 502 F.2d 1351 (CA7 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 925 (1975) (civil action by Government). "
1449 ,7     ," When Congress intended that the defendant have been previously convicted, it said so.  Title 18 U. S. C. § 1963(f) (1982 ed.,
             Supp. III) states that ""[upon] conviction of a person under this section,"" his forfeited property shall be seized.  Likewise, in Title X
             of the same legislation Congress explicitly required prior convictions, rather than prior criminal activity, to support enhanced
             sentences for special offenders.  See 18 U. S. C. § 3575(e)."
1449 ,8     ," The court below considered it significant that § 1964(c) requires a ""violation of section 1962,"" whereas the Clayton Act speaks
             of ""anything forbidden in the antitrust laws."" 741 F.2d, at 488; see 15 U. S. C. § 15(a).  The court viewed this as a deliberate
             change indicating Congress' desire that the underlying conduct not only be forbidden, but also have led to a criminal conviction.
             There is nothing in the legislative history to support this interpretation, and we cannot view this minor departure in wording,
             without more, to indicate a fundamental departure in meaning.  Representative Steiger, who proposed this wording in the House,
             nowhere indicated a desire to depart from the antitrust model in this regard.  See 116 Cong. Rec. 35227, 35246 (1970).  To the
             contrary, he viewed the treble-damages provision as a ""parallel private remedy."" Id., at 27739 (letter to House Judiciary "
1450 ,      ," Committee).  Likewise, Senator Hruska's discussion of his identically worded proposal gives no hint of any such intent.  See 115
             Cong. Rec. 6993 (1969).  In any event, the change in language does not support the court's drastic inference.  It seems more
             likely that the language was chosen because it is more succinct than that in the Clayton Act, and is consistent with the
             neighboring provisions.  See §§ 1963(a), 1964(a)."
1450 ,9     ," It is worth bearing in mind that the holding of the court below is not without problematic consequences of its own.  It arbitrarily
             restricts the availability of private actions, for lawbreakers are often not apprehended and convicted. Even if a conviction has
             been obtained, it is unlikely that a private plaintiff will be able to recover for all of the acts constituting an extensive ""pattern,"" or
             that multiple victims will all be able to obtain redress.  This is because criminal convictions are often limited to a small portion of
             the actual or possible charges.  The decision below would also create peculiar incentives for plea bargaining to non-predicate-
             act offenses so as to ensure immunity from a later civil suit.  If nothing else, a criminal defendant might plead to a tiny fraction of
             counts, so as to limit future civil liability.  In addition, the dependence of potential civil litigants on the initiation and success of a
             criminal prosecution could lead to unhealthy private pressures on prosecutors and to self-serving trial testimony, or at least
             accusations thereof.  Problems would also arise if some or all of the convictions were reversed on appeal.  Finally, the
             compelled wait for the completion of criminal proceedings would result in pursuit of stale claims, complex statute of limitations
             problems, or the wasteful splitting of actions, with resultant claim and issue preclusion complications."
1450 ,10    ," The Court of Appeals also observed that allowing civil suits without prior convictions ""would make a hash"" of the statute's
             liberal-construction requirement.  741 F.2d, at 502; see RICO § 904(a).  Since criminal statutes must be strictly construed, the
             court reasoned, allowing liberal construction of RICO -- an approach often justified on the ground that the conduct for which
             liability is imposed is ""already criminal"" -- would only be permissible if there already existed criminal convictions.  Again, we have
             doubts about the premise of this rather convoluted argument.  The strict-construction principle is merely a guide to statutory
             interpretation.  Like its identical twin, the ""rule of lenity,"" it ""only serves as an aid for resolving an ambiguity; it is not to be used to
             beget one."" Callanan v. United States, 364 U.S. 587, 596 (1961); see also United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 587-588 "
1451 ,      ," (1981). But even if that principle has some application, it does not support the court's holding.  The strict- and liberal-construction
             principles are not mutually exclusive; § 1961 and § 1962 can be strictly construed without adopting that approach to § 1964(c).
             Cf.  United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U.S. 422, 443, n. 19 (1978). Indeed, if Congress' liberal-construction
             mandate is to be applied anywhere, it is in § 1964, where RICO's remedial purposes are most evident."
1451 ,11    ," Even were the constitutional questions more significant, any doubts would be insufficient to overcome the mandate of the
             statute's language and history.  ""Statutes should be construed to avoid constitutional questions, but this interpretative canon is
             not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature."" United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675, 680
             (1985). "
1452 ,12    ," The decision below does not appear identical to Bankers Trust.  It established a standing requirement, whereas Bankers Trust
             adopted a limitation on damages.  The one focused on the mobster element, the other took a more conceptual approach,
             distinguishing injury caused by the individual acts from injury caused by their cumulative effect.  Thus, the Eighth Circuit has
             indicated its agreement with Bankers Trust but not Sedima.  Alexander Grant & Co. v. Tiffany Industries, Inc., 742 F.2d, at 413.
             See also Haroco, Inc. v. American National Bank & Trust Co. of Chicago, 747 F.2d, at 396. The two tests were described as
             ""very different"" by the ABA Task Force.  See ABA Report, at 310. Yet the Bankers Trust court itself did not seem to think it was departing from Sedima, see 741 F.2d, at 516-517, and other
             Second Circuit panels have treated the two decisions as consistent, see Furman v. Cirrito, 741 F.2d 524 (1984), cert. pending,
             No. 84-604; Durante Brothers & Sons, Inc. v. Flushing National Bank, 755 F.2d 239, 246 (1985). The evident difficulty in
             discerning just what the racketeering injury requirement consists of would make it rather hard to apply in practice or explain to a
             jury."
1452 ,13    ," Given the plain words of the statute, we cannot agree with the court below that Congress could have had no ""inkling of [§
             1964(c)'s] implications."" 741 F.2d, at 492. Congress' ""inklings"" are best determined by the statutory language that it chooses,
             and the language it chose here extends far beyond the limits drawn by the Court of Appeals.  Nor does the ""clanging silence"" of
             the legislative history, ibid., justify those limits.  For one thing, § 1964(c) did not pass through Congress unnoticed.  See Part II,
             supra.  In addition, congressional silence, no matter how ""clanging,"" cannot override the words of the statute."
1452 ,14    ," As many commentators have pointed out, the definition of a ""pattern of racketeering activity"" differs from the other provisions
             in § 1961 in that it states that a pattern ""requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,"" § 1961(5) (emphasis added), not that
             it ""means"" two such acts.  The implication is that while two acts are necessary, they may not be sufficient.  Indeed, in common
             parlance two of anything do not generally form a ""pattern."" The legislative history supports the view that two isolated acts of
             racketeering activity do not constitute a pattern.  As the Senate Report explained: ""The target of [RICO] is thus not sporadic
             activity.  The infiltration of legitimate business normally requires more than one 'racketeering activity' and the threat of continuing
             activity to be effective.  It is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce a pattern."" S. Rep. No. 91-617,
             p. 158 (1969) (emphasis added).  Similarly, the sponsor of the Senate bill, after quoting this portion of the Report, pointed out to
             his colleagues that ""[the] term 'pattern' itself requires the showing of a relationship . . . .  So, therefore, proof of two acts of
             racketeering activity, without more, does not establish a pattern . . . ."" 116 Cong. Rec. 18940 (1970) (statement of Sen.
             McClellan).  See also id., at 35193 (statement of Rep. Poff) (RICO ""not aimed at the isolated offender""); House Hearings, at 665. "
1453 ,      ," Significantly, in defining ""pattern"" in a later provision of the same bill, Congress was more enlightening: ""[Criminal] conduct forms
             a pattern if it embraces criminal acts that have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of
             commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events."" 18 U. S. C. § 3575(e).
             This language may be useful in interpreting other sections of the Act.  Cf.  Iannelli v. United States, 420 U.S. 770, 789 (1975)."
1453 ,15    ," Such damages include, but are not limited to, the sort of competitive injury for which the dissenters would allow recovery.  See
             post, at 521-522.  Under the dissent's reading of the statute, the harm proximately caused by the forbidden conduct is not
             compensable, but that ultimately and indirectly flowing therefrom is.  We reject this topsy-turvy approach, finding no warrant in
             the language or the history of the statute for denying recovery thereunder to ""the direct victims of the [racketeering] activity,""
             post, at 522, while preserving it for the indirect.  Even the court below was not that grudging.  It would apparently have allowed
             recovery for both the direct and the ultimate harm flowing from the defendant's conduct, requiring injury ""not simply caused by
             the predicate acts, but also caused by an activity which RICO was designed to deter."" 741 F.2d, at 496 (emphasis added). The dissent would also go further than did the Second Circuit in its requirement that the plaintiff have suffered a competitive
             injury.  Again, as the court below stated, Congress ""nowhere suggested that actual anticompetitive effect is required for suits
             under the statute."" Ibid.  The language it chose, allowing recovery to ""[any] person injured in his business or property,"" § 1964(c)
             (emphasis added), applied to this situation, suggests that the statute is not so limited. "

             they should no longer do business with Soler.  Id., at 98-99. "
1480 ,7     ," The District Court found that the arbitration clause did not cover the fourth and sixth counterclaims, which sought damages for
             defamation, see n. 6, supra, or the allegations in the seventh counterclaim concerning discriminatory treatment and the
             establishment of minimum-sales volumes.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 83-1569, pp. B10-B11.  Accordingly, it retained
             jurisdiction over those portions of the litigation.  In addition, because no arbitration agreement between Soler and CISA existed,
             the court retained jurisdiction, insofar as they sought relief from CISA, over the first, second, third, and ninth counterclaims,
             which raised claims under the Puerto Rico Dealers' Contracts Act, the federal Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act, the
             Sherman Act, and the Puerto Rico competition statute, respectively.  Id., at B12.  These aspects of the District Court's ruling
             were not appealed and are not before this Court."
1480 ,8     ," Soler relied on P.R. Laws Ann., Tit. 10, § 278b-2 (Supp. 1983), which purports to render null and void ""[any] stipulation that
             obligates a dealer to adjust, arbitrate or litigate any controversy that comes up regarding his dealer's contract outside of Puerto
             Rico, or under foreign law or rule of law."" See Walborg Corp. v. Superior Court, 104 P.R.R. 258 (1975). The Court of Appeals
             held this provision pre-empted by 9 U. S. C. § 2, which declares arbitration agreements valid and enforceable ""save upon such
             grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract."" 723 F.2d, at 158. See Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465
             U.S. 1 (1984). See also Ledee v. Ceramiche Ragno, 684 F.2d 184 (CA1 1982). Soler does not challenge this holding in its
             cross-petition here."
1480 ,9     ," As the Court of Appeals saw it, ""[the] question . . . is not whether the arbitration clause mentions antitrust or any other particular
             cause of action, but whether the factual allegations underlying Soler's counterclaims -- and Mitsubishi's bona fide defenses to
             those counterclaims -- are within the scope of the arbitration clause, whatever the legal labels attached to those allegations."" 723
             F.2d, at 159. Because Soler's counterclaim under the Puerto Rico Dealers' Contracts Act focused on Mitsubishi's alleged failure
             to comply with the provisions of the Sales Agreement governing delivery of automobiles, and those provisions were found in that
             portion of Article I of the Agreement subject to arbitration, the Court of Appeals placed this first counterclaim within the arbitration
             clause. Id., at 159-160. The court read the Sherman Act counterclaim to raise issues of wrongful termination of Soler's distributorship, wrongful failure to
             ship ordered parts and vehicles, and wrongful refusal to permit transshipment of stock to the United States and Latin America.
             Because the existence of just cause for termination turned on Mitsubishi's allegations that Soler had breached the Sales
             Agreement by, for example, failing to pay for ordered vehicles, the wrongful termination claim implicated at least three provisions
             within the arbitration clause: Article I-D(1), which rendered a dealer's orders ""firm""; Article I-E, which provided for ""distress unit
             penalties"" where the dealer prevented timely shipment; and Article I-F, specifying payment obligations and procedures.  The "
1481 ,      ," court therefore held the arbitration clause to cover this dispute.  Because the nonshipment claim implicated Soler's obligation
             under Article I-F to proffer acceptable credit, the court found this dispute covered as well.  And because the transshipment claim
             prompted Mitsubishi defenses concerning the suitability of vehicles manufactured to Soler's specifications for use in different
             locales and Soler's inability to provide warranty service to transshipped products, it implicated Soler's obligation under Article IV,
             another covered provision, to make use of Mitsubishi's trademarks in a manner that would not dilute Mitsubishi's reputation and
             goodwill or damage its name and reputation.  The court therefore found the arbitration agreement also to include this dispute,
             noting that such trademark concerns ""are relevant to the legality of territorially based restricted distribution arrangements of the
             sort at issue here."" 723 F.2d, at 160-161, citing Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977). The Court of Appeals read the federal Automobile Dealers' Day in Court Act claim to raise issues as to Mitsubishi's good faith in
             establishing minimum-sales volumes and Mitsubishi's alleged attempt to coerce Soler into accepting replacement by a Mitsubishi
             subsidiary.  It agreed with the District Court's conclusion, in which Mitsubishi acquiesced, that the arbitration clause did not reach
             the first issue; it found the second, arising from Soler's payment problems, to restate claims already found to be covered.  723
             F.2d, at 161. Finally, the Court of Appeals found the antitrust claims under Puerto Rico law entirely to reiterate claims elsewhere stated;
             accordingly, it held them arbitrable to the same extent as their counterparts.  Ibid."
1481 ,10    ," Soler suggests that the court thereby declared antitrust claims arising under Puerto Rico law nonarbitrable as well.  We read
             the Court of Appeals' opinion to have held only the federal antitrust claims nonarbitrable. See id., at 157 (""principal issue on this
             appeal is whether arbitration of federal antitrust claims may be compelled under the Federal Arbitration Act""); id., at 161 (""major
             question in this appeal is whether the antitrust issues raised by Soler's third counterclaim [grounded on Sherman Act] are subject
             to arbitration"").  In any event, any contention that the local antitrust claims are nonarbitrable would be foreclosed by this Court's
             decision in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S., at 10, where we held that the Federal Arbitration Act ""withdrew the power of
             the states to require a judicial forum for the resolution of claims which the contracting parties agreed to resolve by arbitration."""
1481 ,11    ," In this Court, Soler suggests for the first time that Congress intended that claims under the federal Automobile Dealers' Day in
             Court Act be nonarbitrable. Brief for Respondent and Cross-Petitioner 21, n. 12.  Because Soler did not raise this question in the
             Court of Appeals or present it in its cross-petition, we do not address it here."
1481 ,12    ," Following entry of the District Court's judgment, both it and the Court of Appeals denied motions by Soler for a stay pending
             appeal.  The parties accordingly commenced preparation for the arbitration in Japan.  Upon remand from the Court of Appeals,
             however, Soler withdrew the antitrust claims from the arbitration tribunal and sought a stay of arbitration pending the completion
             of the judicial proceedings on the ground that the antitrust claims permeated the claims that remained before that tribunal. The
             District Court denied the motion, instead staying its own proceedings pending the arbitration in Japan.  The arbitration
             recommenced, but apparently came to a halt once again in September 1984 upon the filing by Soler of a petition for
             reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. § 1101 et seq. "
1482 ,13    ," We therefore have no reason to review the Court of Appeals' construction of the scope of the arbitration clause in the light of
             the allegations of Soler's counterclaims. See n. 9, supra; Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S., at 15, n. 7. Soler does suggest that, because the title of the clause referred only to ""certain matters,"" App. 52, and the clause itself
             specifically referred only to ""Articles I-B through V,"" ibid., it should be read narrowly to exclude the statutory claims.  Soler
             ignores the inclusion within those ""certain matters"" of ""[all] disputes, controversies or differences which may arise between
             [Mitsubishi] and [Soler] out of or in relation to [the specified provisions] or for the breach thereof."" Contrary to Soler's suggestion,
             the exclusion of some areas of possible dispute from the scope of an arbitration clause does not serve to restrict the reach of an
             otherwise broad clause in the areas in which it was intended to operate.  Thus, insofar as the allegations underlying the statutory
             claims touch matters covered by the enumerated articles, the Court of Appeals properly resolved any doubts in favor of
             arbitrability. See 723 F.2d, at 159."
1482 ,14    ," The Court previously has explained that the Act was designed to overcome an anachronistic judicial hostility to agreements to
             arbitrate, which American courts had borrowed from English common law.  See Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U.S.
             213, 219-221, and n. 6 (1985); Scherk v. Alberto-Culver Co., 417 U.S. 506, 510, and n. 4 (1974). "

             Franchise Investment Law, Cal. Corp. Code Ann. § 31000 et seq. (West 1977).  While the dissent in Southland Corp. disputed
             the applicability of the Act to proceedings in the state courts, it did not object to the Court's reading of the arbitration clause
             under examination. "

             arbitration panel selected to hear the parties' claims here is composed of three Japanese lawyers, one a former law school dean,
             another a former judge, and the third a practicing attorney with American legal training who has written on Japanese antitrust
             law.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 83-1569, p. 26; Brief for International Chamber of Commerce as Amicus Curiae 16, n. 28. The Court of Appeals was concerned that international arbitrators would lack ""experience with or exposure to our law and
             values."" 723 F.2d, at 162. The obstacles confronted by the arbitration panel in this case, however, should be no greater than
             those confronted by any judicial or arbitral tribunal required to determine foreign law.  See, e. g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 44.1.
             Moreover, while our attachment to the antitrust laws may be stronger than most, many other countries, including Japan, have
             similar bodies of competition law.  See, e. g., 1 Law of Transnational Business Transactions, ch. 9 (Banks, Antitrust Aspects of
             International Business Operations), § 9.03[7] (V. Nanda ed. 1984); H. Iyori & A. Uesugi, The Antimonopoly Laws of Japan
             (1983). "
1487 ,19    ," In addition to the clause providing for arbitration before the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association, the Sales Agreement
             includes a choice-of-law clause which reads: ""This Agreement is made in, and will be governed by and construed in all respects
             according to the laws of the Swiss Confederation as if entirely performed therein."" App. 56.  The United States raises the
             possibility that the arbitral panel will read this provision not simply to govern interpretation of the contract terms, but wholly to
             displace American law even where it otherwise would apply.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20.  The International
             Chamber of Commerce opines that it is ""[conceivable], although we believe it unlikely, [that] the arbitrators could consider Soler's
             affirmative claim of anticompetitive conduct by CISA and Mitsubishi to fall within the purview of this choice-of-law provision, with
             the result that it would be decided under Swiss law rather than the U.S. Sherman Act."" Brief for International Chamber of
             Commerce as Amicus Curiae 25.  At oral argument, however, counsel for Mitsubishi conceded that American law applied to the
             antitrust claims and represented that the claims had been submitted to the arbitration panel in Japan on that basis.  Tr. of Oral.
             Arg. 18.  The record confirms that before the decision of the Court of Appeals the arbitral panel had taken these claims under
             submission.  See District Court Order of May 25, 1984, pp. 2-3. We therefore have no occasion to speculate on this matter at this stage in the proceedings, when Mitsubishi seeks to enforce
             the agreement to arbitrate, not to enforce an award.  Nor need we consider now the effect of an arbitral tribunal's failure to take
             cognizance of the statutory cause of action on the claimant's capacity to reinitiate suit in federal court.  We merely note that in
             the event the choice-of-forum and choice-of-law clauses operated in tandem as a prospective waiver of a party's right to pursue
             statutory remedies for antitrust violations, we would have little hesitation in condemning the agreement as against public policy.
             See, e. g., Redel's Inc. v. General Electric Co., 498 F.2d 95, 98-99 (CA5 1974); Gaines v. Carrollton Tobacco Board of Trade,

1488 ,20    ," See n. 19, supra.  We note, for example, that the rules of the Japan Commercial Arbitration Association provide for the taking
             of a ""summary record"" of each hearing, Rule 28.1; for the stenographic recording of the proceedings where the tribunal so
             orders or a party requests one, Rule 28.2; and for a statement of reasons for the award unless the parties agree otherwise, Rule
             36.1(4).  See App. 219 and 221. Needless to say, we intimate no views on the merits of Soler's antitrust claims."
1488 ,21    ," We do not quarrel with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Art. II(1) of the Convention, which requires the recognition of
             agreements to arbitrate that involve ""subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration,"" contemplates exceptions to arbitrability
             grounded in domestic law.  See 723 F.2d, at 164-166; G. Gaja, International Commercial Arbitration: New York Convention I. B.2

             Gaja, supra, at I.D., n. 43 (same).  And it appears that before acceding to the Convention the Senate was advised by a State
             Department memorandum that the Convention provided for such exceptions.  See S. Exec. Doc. E, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 19
             (1968). In acceding to the Convention the Senate restricted its applicability to commercial matters, in accord with Art. I(3).  See 21
             U.S.T., at 2519, 2560. Yet in implementing the Convention by amendment to the Federal Arbitration Act, Congress did not
             specify any matters it intended to exclude from its scope.  See Act of July 31, 1970, Pub. L. 91-368, 84 Stat. 692, codified at 9 U.
             S. C. §§ 201-208.  In Scherk, this Court recited Art. II(1), including the language relied upon by the Court of Appeals, but paid
             heed to the Convention delegates' ""frequently [voiced] concern that courts of signatory countries in which an agreement to
             arbitrate is sought to be enforced should not be permitted to decline enforcement of such agreements on the basis of parochial
             views of their desirability or in a manner that would diminish the mutually binding nature of the agreements."" 417 U.S., at 520, n.
             15, citing G. Haight, Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards: Summary Analysis of Record

             to arbitrability grounded in express congressional language; here, in contrast, we face a judicially implied exception.  The utility
             of the Convention in promoting the process of international commercial arbitration depends upon the willingness of national
             courts to let go of matters they normally would think of as their own.  Doubtless, Congress may specify categories of claims it
             wishes to reserve for decision by our own courts without contravening this Nation's obligations under the Convention. But we
             decline to subvert the spirit of the United States' accession to the Convention by recognizing subject-matter exceptions where
             Congress has not expressly directed the courts to do so. "

             excuses for non-performance, and the like.  It has a place also in the determination of the simpler questions of law -- the
             questions of law which arise out of these daily relations between merchants as to the passage of title, the existence of

             that a plaintiff in an antitrust suit could not be barred from recovery by proof that he had engaged in an unrelated conspiracy to
             commit some other antitrust violation.  Similarly, in Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 377 U.S. 13 (1964), we held that a dealer whose
             consignment agreement was canceled for failure to adhere to a fixed resale price could bring suit under the antitrust laws even

             that the private action will be an ever-present threat to deter anyone contemplating business behavior in violation of the antitrust
             laws. The plaintiff who reaps the reward of treble damages may be no less morally reprehensible than the defendant, but the law
             encourages his suit to further the overriding public policy in favor of competition.  A more fastidious regard for the relative moral

1512 ,1     ," When Berkeley's charter amendment was passed in 1972, Article XI, § 3(a), of the California Constitution read: ""For its own government, a county or city may adopt a charter by majority vote of its electors voting on the question.  The charter
             is effective when filed with the Secretary of State.  A charter may be amended, revised, or repealed in the same manner.  A

             are the law of the State and have the force and effect of legislative enactments."" This provision was construed to require that charter amendments be approved by concurrent resolution of both houses of the
             state legislature. Birkenfeld v. City of Berkeley, 17 Cal. 3d 129, 137, n. 2, 550 P. 2d 1001, 1007, n. 2 (1976). "
1513 ,2     ," The 1972 charter provision permitted individual adjustments of the across-the-board rent ceiling only on a unit-by-unit basis,
             and only after a hearing on the particular unit whose rent was to be raised.  The California Supreme Court found that this
             limitation ""put the [rent control board] in a procedural strait jacket,"" and ""unnecessarily [precluded] reasonably prompt action"" on
             meritorious petitions by landlords. Birkenfeld, supra, at 171, 172, 550 P. 2d, at 1031, 1032. "
1514 ,1     ," Rice held that a ""state statute is not pre-empted by the federal antitrust laws simply because the state scheme might have an
             anticompetitive effect."" 458 U.S., at 659. Rice involved a challenge to a California statute which effectively allowed liquor
             distillers to control distribution of their products in the State.  The Court concluded that because such vertical nonprice restraints
             are not per se illegal under the Sherman Act, see Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977), the statute
             was not pre-empted. 458 U.S., at 661; see also Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117 (1978); Joseph E. Seagram
             & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U.S. 35 (1966). In contrast, Berkeley's Rent Stabilization Board fixes prices for rental units in the
             city.  Unlike nonprice restraints, price fixing has traditionally been held to be per se illegal under the Sherman Act. See Dr. Miles
             Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911). "
1515 ,2     ," The Court would distinguish Schwegmann and Midcal based on the role of private parties in setting prices.  Ante, at 268-269.
             The Court characterizes the statutory restraints imposed in those cases as ""hybrid, in that nonmarket mechanisms merely
             enforce private marketing decisions."" Ante, at 267.  In this case, the Court argues, Berkeley's landlords have no control over the
             prices they charge.  Ibid. True, in both cases private parties, rather than the State, were largely responsible for setting the prices that retailers had to
             adhere to.  However, the lack of state supervision over price-fixing activities was only relevant to whether the challenged statutes
             were immune from antitrust liability under Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943), see Midcal, 445 U.S., at 105; neither decision
             drew the distinction the Court today creates between ""unilateral"" and ""hybrid"" governmental restraints.  In both cases the
             challenged statute was found invalid simply because it compelled private parties to charge fixed prices for their products,
             conduct which the Sherman Act forbids. See Schwegmann, 341 U.S., at 389; Midcal, supra, at 103. The Court's ""distinction""
             ignores the fact that price fixing has the same deleterious effect upon the competitive market whether prices are set by an
             administrative body or by private parties.  Thus, regardless of whether Berkeley's landlords have some role in setting the prices
             they must charge, the coercive effect of the city's Ordinance results in concerted action violative of the Sherman Act. "
1516 ,3     ," At that time, the State Constitution required the legislature to approve city charter amendments.  See Birkenfeld v. City of

1529 ,6     ," The Sherman Act does reach conduct outside our borders, but only when the conduct has an effect on American commerce.
             Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 704 (1962) (""A conspiracy to monopolize or restrain the
             domestic or foreign commerce of the United States is not outside the reach of the Sherman Act just because part of the conduct
             complained of occurs in foreign countries"").  The effect on which respondents rely is the artificially depressed level of prices for
             CEPs in the United States. Petitioners' alleged cartelization of the Japanese market could not have caused that effect over a period of some two decades.
             Once petitioners decided, as respondents allege, to reduce output and raise prices in the Japanese market, they had the option
             of either producing fewer goods or selling more goods in other markets.  The most plausible conclusion is that petitioners chose
             the latter option because it would be more profitable than the former.  That choice does not flow from the cartelization of the
             Japanese market.  On the contrary, were the Japanese market perfectly competitive petitioners would still have to choose
             whether to sell goods overseas, and would still presumably make that choice based on their profit expectations.  For this reason,
             respondents' theory of recovery depends on proof of the asserted price-cutting conspiracy in this country."
1529 ,7     ," Respondents also argue that the check prices, the five company rule, and the price fixing in Japan are all part of one large
             conspiracy that includes monopolization of the American market through predatory pricing. The argument is mistaken.  However
             one decides to describe the contours of the asserted conspiracy -- whether there is one conspiracy or several -- respondents
             must show that the conspiracy caused them an injury for which the antitrust laws provide relief.  Associated General Contractors
             of California, Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 538-540 (1983); Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., 429 U.S. 477, 488- "
1530 ,489   ," (1977); see also Note, Antitrust Standing, Antitrust Injury, and the Per Se Standard, 93 Yale L.J. 1309 (1984). That showing
             depends in turn on proof that petitioners conspired to price predatorily in the American market, since the other conduct involved
             in the alleged conspiracy cannot have caused such an injury."
1530 ,8     ," Throughout this opinion, we refer to the asserted conspiracy as one to price ""predatorily."" This term has been used chiefly in
             cases in which a single firm, having a dominant share of the relevant market, cuts its prices in order to force competitors out of
             the market, or perhaps to deter potential entrants from coming in.  E. g., Southern Pacific Communications Co. v. American
             Telephone & Telegraph Co., 238 U. S. App. D. C. 309, 331-336, 740 F.2d 980, 1002-1007 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1005
             (1985). In such cases, ""predatory pricing"" means pricing below some appropriate measure of cost.  E. g., Barry Wright Corp. v.
             ITT Grinnell Corp., 724 F.2d 227, 232-235 (CA1 1983); see Utah Pipe Co. v. Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685, 698, 701,
             702, n. 14 (1967). LEdHN[7B][
             ] [7B]There is a good deal of debate, both in the cases and in the law reviews, about what ""cost"" is relevant in such cases.  We need not resolve this debate here, because unlike the cases cited above, this is a Sherman Act § 1 case.  For
             purposes of this case, it is enough to note that respondents have not suffered an antitrust injury unless petitioners conspired to
             drive respondents out of the relevant markets by (i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their products, or (ii) pricing below
             some appropriate measure of cost.  An agreement without these features would either leave respondents in the same position
             as would market forces or would actually benefit respondents by raising market prices.  Respondents therefore may not
             complain of conspiracies that, for example, set maximum prices above market levels, or that set minimum prices at any level."
1530 ,9     ," We do not consider whether recovery should ever be available on a theory such as respondents' when the pricing in question is
             above some measure of incremental cost.  See generally Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices Under
             Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697, 709-718 (1975) (discussing cost-based test for use in § 2 cases).  As a
             practical matter, it may be that only direct evidence of below-cost pricing is sufficient to overcome the strong inference that
             rational businesses would not enter into conspiracies such as this one.  See Part IV-A, infra."

             1953.  NUE Complaint para. 52; Zenith Complaint para. 39."
1533 ,14    ," During the same period, the number of American firms manufacturing television sets declined from 19 to 13.  5 App. to Brief
             for Appellant in No. 81-2331 (CA3), p. 1961a.  This decline continued a trend that began at least by 1960, when petitioners'
             sales in the United States market were negligible.  Ibid.  See Zenith Complaint paras. 35, 37."
1533 ,15    ," Respondents offer no reason to suppose that entry into the relevant market is especially difficult, yet without barriers to entry it
             would presumably be impossible to maintain supracompetitive prices for an extended time.  Judge Easterbrook, commenting on
             this case in a law review article, offers the following sensible assessment: ""The plaintiffs [in this case] maintain that for the last fifteen years or more at least ten Japanese manufacturers have sold TV
             sets at less than cost in order to drive United States firms out of business.  Such conduct cannot possibly produce profits by
             harming competition, however.  If the Japanese firms drive some United States firms out of business, they could not recoup.
             Fifteen years of losses could be made up only by very high prices for the indefinite future.  (The losses are like investments,
             which must be recovered with compound interest.) If the defendants should try to raise prices to such a level, they would attract
             new competition.  There are no barriers to entry into electronics, as the proliferation of computer and audio firms shows.  The
             competition would come from resurgent United States firms, from other foreign firms (Korea and many other nations make TV
             sets), and from defendants themselves.  In order to recoup, the Japanese firms would need to suppress competition among
             themselves.  On plaintiffs' theory, the cartel would need to last at least thirty years, far longer than any in history, even when
             cartels were not illegal.  None should be sanguine about the prospects of such a cartel, given each firm's incentive to shave
             price and expand its share of sales.  The predation recoupment story therefore does not make sense, and we are left with the
             more plausible inference that the Japanese firms did not sell below cost in the first place.  They were just engaged in hard
             competition."" Easterbrook, The Limits of Antitrust, 63 Texas L. Rev. 1, 26-27 (1984) (footnotes omitted)."
1533 ,16    ," The alleged predatory scheme makes sense only if petitioners can recoup their losses.  In light of the large number of firms
             involved here, petitioners can achieve this only by engaging in some form of price fixing after they have succeeded in driving
             competitors from the market.  Such price fixing would, of course, be an independent violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. United
             States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150 (1940). "
1534 ,17    ," The predators' losses must actually increase as the conspiracy nears its objective: the greater the predators' market share, the
             more products the predators sell; but since every sale brings with it a loss, an increase in market share also means an increase
             in predatory losses."
1534 ,18    ," The same is true of any supposed excess production capacity that petitioners may have possessed.  The existence of plant
             capacity that exceeds domestic demand does tend to establish the ability to sell products abroad.  It does not, however, provide
             a motive for selling at prices lower than necessary to obtain sales; nor does it explain why petitioners would be willing to lose
             money in the United States market without some reasonable prospect of recouping their investment."
1534 ,19    ," Respondents also rely on an expert study suggesting that petitioners have sold their products in the American market at
             substantial losses.  The relevant study is not based on actual cost data; rather, it consists of expert opinion based on a
             mathematical construction that in turn rests on assumptions about petitioners' costs.  The District Court analyzed those
             assumptions in some detail and found them both implausible and inconsistent with record evidence.  Zenith Radio Corp. v.
             Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 505 F.Supp., at 1356-1363. Although the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's finding
             that the expert report was inadmissible, the court did not disturb the District Court's analysis of the factors that substantially
             undermine the probative value of that evidence.  See 723 F.2d, at 277-282. We find the District Court's analysis persuasive.
             Accordingly, in our view the expert opinion evidence of below-cost pricing has little probative value in comparison with the
             economic factors, discussed in Part IV-A, supra, that suggest that such conduct is irrational. "
1535 ,20    ," The Court of Appeals correctly reasoned that the five company rule might tend to insulate petitioners from competition with
             each other.  723 F.2d, at 306. But this effect is irrelevant to a conspiracy to price predatorily.  Petitioners have no incentive to
             underprice each other if they already are pricing below the level at which they could sell their goods.  The far more plausible
             inference from a customer allocation agreement such as the five company rule is that petitioners were conspiring to raise prices,
             by limiting their ability to take sales away from each other.  Respondents -- petitioners' competitors -- suffer no harm from a
             conspiracy to raise prices.  Supra, at 582-583.  Moreover, it seems very unlikely that the five company rule had any significant
             effect of any kind, since the ""rule"" permitted petitioners to sell to their American subsidiaries, and did not limit the number of
             distributors to which the subsidiaries could resell.  513 F.Supp., at 1190. "
1536 ,21    ," We do not imply that, if petitioners had had a plausible reason to conspire, ambiguous conduct could suffice to create a triable
             issue of conspiracy. Our decision in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U.S. 752 (1984), establishes that HN5[
             ]
             conduct that is as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, without more, support even an
             inference of conspiracy. Id., at 763-764. See supra, at 588. "
1537 ,1     ," The Court adequately summarizes the quite fact-specific holding in Cities Service.  Ante, at 587. In Monsanto, the Court held that a manufacturer's termination of a price-cutting distributor after receiving a complaint from
             another distributor is not, standing alone, sufficient to create a jury question.  465 U.S., at 763-764. To understand this holding, it
             is important to realize that under United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300 (1919), it is permissible for a manufacturer to
             announce retail prices in advance and terminate those who fail to comply, but that under Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &
             Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911), it is impermissible for the manufacturer and its distributors to agree on the price at which the
             distributors will sell the goods.  Thus, a manufacturer's termination of a price-cutting distributor after receiving a complaint from
             another distributor is lawful under Colgate, unless the termination is pursuant to a shared understanding between the
             manufacturer and its distributors respecting enforcement of a resale price maintenance scheme.  Monsanto holds that to
             establish liability under Dr. Miles, more is needed than evidence of behavior that is consistent with a distributor's exercise of its
             prerogatives under Colgate.  Thus, ""[there] must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility that the manufacturer and
             nonterminated distributors were acting independently."" 465 U.S., at 764. Monsanto does not hold that if a terminated dealer
             produces some further evidence of conspiracy beyond the bare fact of postcomplaint termination, the judge hearing a motion for
             summary judgment should balance all the evidence pointing toward conspiracy against all the evidence pointing toward
             independent action. "
1538 ,2     ," Dr. DePodwin summarizes his view of the harm caused by Japanese cartelization as follows: ""When we consider the injuries inflicted on United States producers, we must again look at the Japanese television
             manufacturers' export agreement as part of a generally collusive scheme embracing the Japanese domestic market as well.
             This scheme increased the supply of television receivers to the United States market while restricting supply in the Japanese
             market.  If Japanese manufacturers had competed in both domestic and export markets, they would have sold more in the
             domestic market and less in the United States.  A greater proportion of Japanese production capacity would have been devoted
             to domestic sales.  Domestic prices would have been lower and export prices would have been higher.  The size of the price
             differential between domestic and export markets would have diminished practically to the vanishing point.  Consequently,
             competition among Japanese producers in both markets would have resulted in reducing exports to the United States and
             United States prices would have risen.  In addition, investment by the United States industry would have increased.  As it was,
             however, the influx of sets at depressed prices cut the rates of return on television receiver production facilities in the United
             States to so low a level as to make such investment uneconomic. ""We can therefore conclude that the American manufacturers of television receivers would have made larger sales at higher
             prices in the absence of the Japanese cartel agreements.  Thus, the collusive behavior of Japanese television manufacturers
             resulted in a very severe injury to those American television manufacturers, particularly to National Union Electric Corporation,
             which produced a preponderance of television sets with screen sizes of nineteen inches and lower, especially those in the lower
             range of prices."" 5 App. to Brief for Appellants in No. 81-2331 (CA3), pp. 1629a-1630a."
1538 ,3     ," The DePodwin Report has this, among other things, to say in summarizing the harm to respondents caused by the five
             company rule, exchange of production data, price coordination, and other allegedly anti-competitive practices of petitioners: ""The impact of Japanese anti-competitive practices on United States manufacturers is evident when one considers the nature of
             competition.  When a market is fully competitive, firms pit their resources against one another in an attempt to secure the
             business of individual customers.  However, when firms collude, they violate a basic tenet of competitive behavior, i. e., that they
             act independently.  United States firms were confronted with Japanese competitors who collusively were seeking to destroy their
             established customer relationships.  Each Japanese company had targeted customers which it could service with reasonable
             assurance that its fellow Japanese cartel members would not become involved.  But just as importantly, each Japanese firm
             would be assured that what was already a low price level for Japanese television receivers in the United States market would
             not be further depressed by the actions of its Japanese associates. "
1539 ,      ," ""The result was a phenomenal growth in exports, particularly to the United States.  Concurrently, Japanese manufacturers, and
             the defendants in particular, made large investments in new plant and equipment and expanded production capacity.  It is
             obvious, therefore, that the effect of the Japanese cartel's concerted actions was to generate a larger volume of investment in
             the Japanese television industry than would otherwise have been the case.  This added capacity both enabled and encouraged
             the Japanese to penetrate the United States market more deeply than they would have had they competed lawfully."" Id., at
             1628a-1629a. For a more complete statement of DePodwin's explanation of how the alleged cartel operated, and the harms it caused
             respondents, see id., at 1609a-1642a.  This material is summarized in a chart found id., at 1633a."
1539 ,4     ," In holding that Parts IV and V of the Report had been improperly excluded, the Court of Appeals said: ""The trial court found that DePodwin did not use economic expertise in reaching the opinion that the defendants participated in a
             Japanese television cartel. 505 F.Supp. at 1342-46. We have examined the excluded portions of Parts IV and V in light of the
             admitted portions, and we conclude that this finding is clearly erroneous.  As a result, the court also held the opinions to be
             unhelpful to the factfinder. What the court in effect did was to eliminate all parts of the report in which the expert economist, after
             describing the conditions in the respective markets, the opportunities for collusion, the evidence pointing to collusion, the terms
             of certain undisputed agreements, and the market behavior, expressed the opinion that there was concert of action consistent
             with plaintiffs' conspiracy theory.  Considering the complexity of the economic issues involved, it simply cannot be said that such
             an opinion would not help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine that fact in issue."" In re Japanese Electronics
             Products Antitrust Litigation, 723 F.2d 238, 280 (1983). The Court of Appeals had similar views about Parts VI and VII."
1539 ,5     ," I use the Third Circuit's analysis of the five company rule by way of example; the court did an equally careful analysis of the

             311. "
1540 ,      ," In discussing the five-company rule, I do not mean to imply any conclusion on the validity of petitioners' sovereign compulsion

             insurers in making alternative benefits determinations: ""The problems associated with third party programs are many, but I believe the 'Indiana Plan' [i. e., the policy of refusing to
             submit x rays] to be sound and if we work together, we can win this battle.  We are fighting an economic war where the very
             survival of our profession is at stake. ""How long can some of the leaders of dentistry in other states be so complacent and willing to fall into the trap that is being set
             for us.  If only they would take the time, to see from whence come the arrows that are heading in our direction.  The Delta Dental
             Plans have bedded down with the unions and have been a party to setting up the greatest controls that any profession has ever
             known in a free society. . . . ""The name of the game is money.  The government and labor are determined to reduce the cost of the dental health dollar at the
             expense of the dentist. There is no way a dental service can be rendered cheaper when the third party has to have its share of
             the dollar. ""Already we are locked into a fee freeze that could completely control the quality of dental care, if left on long enough."" FTC

1549 ,2     ,Respondent no longer makes any pretense of arguing that it is immune from antitrust liability as a labor organization.
1553 ,3     ," Because we find that the Commission's findings can be sustained on this basis, we do not address the Commission's
             contention that the Federation's activities can be condemned regardless of market power or actual effect merely because they
             constitute a continuation of the restraints formerly imposed by the Indiana Dental Association, which allegedly had market power

1555 ,4     ," It is undisputed that lay claims examiners employed by insurance companies have no authority to deny claims on the basis of
             examination of x rays; rather, initial screening of x rays serves only as a means of identifying cases that merit further scrutiny by
             the licensed dentists serving as consultants to the insurers. Any recommendation that benefits be denied or a less expensive
             course of treatment be pursued is based on the professional judgment of a licensed dentist that the materials available to him --
             x rays, claim forms, and whatever further diagnostic aids he chooses to consult -- are sufficient to indicate that the treating
             dentist's recommendation is not necessary to the health of the patient. There is little basis for concluding that, where such a
             divergence of professional judgment exists, the treatment recommendation made by the patient's dentist should be assumed to

             an individual voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a
             limited range of issues.  In either case such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions."" The District Court found that respondents, as political lobbyists, are the second type of political figure described by the Gertz

             the purposes of our discussion we assume that the moving party has met initially the requisite evidentiary burden."
1570 ,5     ," This requirement in turn is qualified by Rule 56(f)'s provision that summary judgment be refused where the nonmoving party

             defendants in libel and defamation actions in addition to the constitutional protections embodied in the substantive laws."" Calder
             v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 790-791 (1984). "
1574 ,1     ," The Court's holding today is not, of course, confined in its application to First Amendment cases.  Although this case arises in
             the context of litigation involving libel and the press, the Court's holding is that ""in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the
             judge must view the evidence presented through the prism of the substantive evidentiary burden."" Ante, at 254.  Accordingly, I
             simply do not understand why JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting, feels it appropriate to cite Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783
             (1984), and to remind the Court that we have consistently refused to extend special procedural protections to defendants in libel
             and defamation suits.  The Court today does nothing of the kind.  It changes summary judgment procedure for all litigants,
             regardless of the substantive nature of the underlying litigation. Moreover, the Court's holding is not limited to those cases in which the evidentiary standard is ""heightened,"" i. e., those in which
             a plaintiff must prove his case by more than a mere preponderance of the evidence.  Presumably, if a district court ruling on a
             motion for summary judgment in a libel case is to consider the ""quantum and quality"" of proof necessary to support liability under
             New York Times, ante, at 254, and then ask whether the evidence presented is of ""sufficient caliber or quantity"" to support that
             quantum and quality, the court must ask the same questions in a garden-variety action where the plaintiff need prevail only by a
             mere preponderance of the evidence.  In other words, today's decision by its terms applies to all summary judgment motions,
             irrespective of the burden of proof required and the subject matter of the suit. "
1575 ,2     ," Writing in dissent in Matsushita, JUSTICE WHITE stated that he agreed with the summary judgment test employed by the
             Court, namely, that ""'[where] the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party,
             there is no 'genuine issue for trial.'"" 475 U.S., at 599. Whether the shift, announced today, from looking to a ""reasonable"" rather
             than a ""rational"" jury is intended to be of any significance, there are other aspects of the Matsushita dissent which I find difficult
             to square with the Court's holding in the present case.  The Matsushita dissenters argued: "". . . [The] Court summarizes Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., supra, as holding that 'courts should not permit
             factfinders to infer conspiracies when such inferences are implausible. . . .' Ante, at 593.  Such language suggests that a judge
             hearing a defendant's motion for summary judgment in an antitrust case should go beyond the traditional summary judgment
             inquiry and decide for himself whether the weight of the evidence favors the plaintiff.  Cities Service and Monsanto do not stand
             for any such proposition.  Each of those cases simply held that a particular piece of evidence standing alone was insufficiently
             probative to justify sending a case to the jury.  These holdings in no way undermine the doctrine that all evidence must be
             construed in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. ""If the Court intends to give every judge hearing a motion for summary judgment in an antitrust case the job of determining if the
             evidence makes the inference of conspiracy more probable than not, it is overturning settled law.  If the Court does not intend
             such a pronouncement, it should refrain from using unnecessarily broad and confusing language."" Id., at 600-601 (footnote

             Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate because there was ""controverted evidence in the
             record . . . which affords more than merely colorable substance"" to the petitioners' allegations.  387 U.S., at 84. Dombrowski
             simply cannot be read to mean that summary judgment may be granted if evidence is merely colorable; what the case actually "

             in the remedy each section provides means that certain considerations relevant to a determination of standing under § 4 are not
             relevant under § 16.  The treble-damages remedy, if afforded to ""every person tangentially affected by an antitrust violation,""

             other factors in addition to antitrust injury, such as the potential for duplicative recovery, the complexity of apportioning damages,
             and the existence of other parties that have been more directly harmed, to determine whether a party is a proper plaintiff under §
             4.  See Associated General Contractors, 459 U.S., at 544-545; Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720 (1977). Conversely,
             HN10[
             ] under § 16, the only remedy available is equitable in nature, and, as we recognized in Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co., ""the

             the passage of the Clayton Act are scarce, those that were made are consistent with the House and Senate Reports.  For
             example, in this excerpt from a provision-by-provision description of the bill, Representative McGillicuddy (a member of the
             House Judiciary Committee) stated: ""Under the present law any person injured in his business or property by acts in violation of the Sherman antitrust law may

             prove his case.  There is no provision under the present law, however, to prevent threatened loss or damage even though it be
             irreparable.  The practical effect of this is that a man would have to sit by and see his business ruined before he could take
             advantage of his remedy.  In what condition is such a man to take up a long and costly lawsuit to defend his rights? ""The proposed bill solves this problem for the person, firm, or corporation threatened with loss or damage to property by
             providing injunctive relief against the threatened act that will cause such loss or damage.  Under this most excellent provision a
             man does not have to wait until he is ruined in his business before he has his remedy.  Thus the bill not only protects the
             individual from loss or damage, but it relieves him of the tremendous burden of long and expensive litigation, often intolerable.""
             51 Cong. Rec. 9261 (1914) (emphasis added). Representative Floyd described the nature of the § 16 remedy in these terms: ""In section 16 . . . is a provision that gives the litigant injured in his business an entirely new remedy. . . . . HN12[
             ] "". . . [Section] 16 gives any individual, company, or corporation . . . or combination the right to go into court and enjoin

             damages. . . .  [So] that if a man is injured by a discriminatory contract, by a tying contract, by the unlawful acquisition of stock of
             competing corporations, or by reason of someone acting unlawfully as a director in two banks or other corporations, he can go

1595 ,11    ," Respondent finds support in the legislative history of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 for the view
             that Congress intends the courts to apply § 7 so as to protect the viability of small competitors. The Senate Report, for example,
             cites with approval this Court's statement in United States v. Von's Grocery Co., 384 U.S. 270, 275 (1966), that ""the basic
             purpose of the 1950 Celler-Kefauver Act [amending § 7 of the Clayton Act] was to prevent economic concentration in the
             American economy by keeping a large number of small competitors in business."" S. Rep. No. 94-803, p. 63 (1976).  Even if
             respondent is correct that Congress intended the courts to apply § 7 so as to keep small competitors in business at the expense
             of efficiency, a proposition about which there is considerable disagreement, such congressional intent is of no use to Monfort, "
1596 ,      ," which has conceded that it will suffer only a loss of profits, and not be driven from the market, should Excel engage in a cost-
             price squeeze. See n. 10, supra."
1596 ,12    ," Most commentators reserve the term predatory pricing for pricing below some measure of cost, although they differ on the
             appropriate measure.  See, e. g., Areeda & Turner, Predatory Pricing and Related Practices under Section 2 of the Sherman
             Act, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 697 (1975); McGee, Predatory Pricing Revisited, 23 J. Law & Econ. 289 (1980) (reviewing various
             proposed definitions).  No consensus has yet been reached on the proper definition of predatory pricing in the antitrust context,
             however.  For purposes of decision in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986), for example,
             we defined predatory pricing as either ""(i) pricing below the level necessary to sell their products, or (ii) pricing below some
             appropriate measure of cost."" Id., at 585, n. 8. Definitions of predatory pricing also vary among the Circuits.  Compare Arthur S.
             Langenderfer, Inc. v. S. E. Johnson Co., 729 F.2d 1050, 1056-1057 (CA6) (pricing below marginal or average variable cost
             presumptively illegal, pricing above such cost presumptively legal), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1036 (1984), with Transamerica
             Computer Co. v. International Business Machines Corp., 698 F.2d 1377 (CA9) (pricing above average total costs may be
             deemed predatory upon showing of predatory intent), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 955 (1983). Although neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals explicitly defined the term predatory pricing, their use of the term is
             consistent with a definition of pricing below cost.  Such a definition is sufficient for purposes of this decision, because only below-
             cost pricing would threaten to drive Monfort from the market, see n. 9, supra, and because Monfort made no allegation that
             Excel would act with predatory intent.  Thus, in this case, as in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., supra,
             we find it unnecessary to ""consider whether recovery should ever be available . . . when the pricing in question is above some
             measure of incremental cost,"" 475 U.S., at 585, n. 9, or whether above-cost pricing coupled with predatory intent is ever
             sufficient to state a claim of predation.  See n. 11, supra."
1596 ,13    ," See also Brunswick, 429 U.S., at 489, n. 14 (""The short-term effect of certain anticompetitive behavior -- predatory below-cost
             pricing, for example -- may be to stimulate price competition.  But competitors may be able to prove antitrust injury before they
             actually are driven from the market and competition is thereby lessened""). "
1597 ,14    ," The Court of Appeals may have relied on the District Court's speculation that the merger raised ""a distinct possibility . . . of
             predatory pricing."" 591 F.Supp., at 710. This statement directly followed the District Court's second observation that Monfort did
             not raise such a claim, however, and thus was clearly dicta."
1597 ,15    ," Even had Monfort actually advanced a claim of predatory pricing, we doubt whether the facts as found by the District Court
             would have supported it.  Although Excel may have had the financial resources to absorb losses over an extended period, other
             factors, such as Excel's share of market capacity and the barriers to entry after competitors have been driven from the market,
             must also be considered. In order to succeed in a sustained campaign of predatory pricing, a predator must be able to absorb
             the market shares of its rivals once prices have been cut.  If it cannot do so, its attempt at predation will presumably fail, because
             there will remain in the market sufficient demand for the competitors' goods at a higher price, and the competitors will not be
             driven out of business.  In this case, Excel's 20.4% market share after the merger suggests it would lack sufficient market power
             to engage in predatory pricing. See Williamson, Predatory Pricing: A Strategic and Welfare Analysis, 87 Yale L. J. 284, 292
             (1977) (60% share necessary); Areeda & Turner, Williamson on Predatory Pricing, 87 Yale L. J. 1337, 1348 (1978) (60% share
             not enough).  It is possible that a firm with a low market share might nevertheless have sufficient excess capacity to enable it
             rapidly to expand its output and absorb the market shares of its rivals. According to Monfort's expert witness, however, Excel's
             postmerger share of market capacity would be only 28.4%.  1 App. 66.  Moreover, it appears that Excel, like the other large beef
             packers, operates at over 85% of capacity.  Id., at 135-136.  Thus Excel acting alone would clearly lack sufficient capacity after
             the merger to satisfy all or most of the demand for boxed beef. Although it is conceivable that Excel could act collusively with
             other large packers, such as IBP, in order to make the scheme work, the District Court found that Monfort did not ""assert that
             Excel and IBP would act in collusion with each other in an effort to drive others out of the market,"" 591 F.Supp., at 692. With only
             a 28.4% share of market capacity and lacking a plan to collude, Excel would harm only itself by embarking on a sustained
             campaign of predatory pricing. Courts should not find allegations of predatory pricing credible when the alleged predator is
             incapable of successfully pursuing a predatory scheme.  See n. 17, infra. It is also important to examine the barriers to entry into the market, because ""without barriers to entry it would presumably be
             impossible to maintain supracompetitive prices for an extended time."" Matsushita, 475 U.S., at 591, n. 15. In discussing the
             potential for oligopoly pricing in the beef-packing business following the merger, the District Court found significant barriers to
             entry due to the ""costs and delays"" of building new plants, and ""the lack of [available] facilities and the cost [$ 20-40 million]
             associated with refurbishing old facilities."" 591 F.Supp., at 707-708. Although the District Court concluded that these barriers
             would restrict entry following the merger, the court's analysis was premised on market conditions during the premerger period of
             competitive pricing. Ibid.  In evaluating entry barriers in the context of a predatory pricing claim, however, a court should focus on
             whether significant entry barriers would exist after the merged firm had eliminated some of its rivals, because at that point the
             remaining firms would begin to charge supracompetitive prices, and the barriers that existed during competitive conditions might
             well prove insignificant.  In this case, for example, although costs of entry into the current competitive market may be high, if
             Excel and others in fact succeeded in driving competitors out of the market, the facilities of the bankrupt competitors would then "
1598 ,      ," be available, and the record shows, without apparent contradiction, that shut-down plants could be producing efficiently in a
             matter of months and that equipment and a labor force could readily be obtained, 1 App. 95-96.  Similarly, although the District
             Court determined that the high costs of building new plants and refurbishing old plants created a ""formidable"" barrier to entry
             given ""the low profit margins in the beef industry,"" 591 F.Supp., at 707, this finding speaks neither to the likelihood of entry
             during a period of supracompetitive profitability nor to the potential return on investment in such a period."
1598 ,16    ," See Koller, The Myth of Predatory Pricing: An Empirical Study, 4 Antitrust Law & Econ. Rev. 105 (1971); Miller, Comments

1598 ,17    ," Claims of threatened injury from predatory pricing must, of course, be evaluated with care.  As we discussed in Matsushita
             Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., the likelihood that predatory pricing will benefit the predator is ""inherently uncertain:
             the short-run loss [from pricing below cost] is definite, but the long-run gain depends on successfully neutralizing the
             competition. . . . [and] on maintaining monopoly power for long enough both to recoup the predator's losses and to harvest some
             additional gain."" 475 U.S., at 589. Although the commentators disagree as to whether it is ever rational for a firm to engage in
             such conduct, it is plain that the obstacles to the successful execution of a strategy of predation are manifold, and that the
             disincentives to engage in such a strategy are accordingly numerous.  See, e. g., id., at 588-593 (discussing obstacles to
             successful predatory pricing conspiracy); R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 144-159 (1978); McGee, Predatory Pricing Revisited,

             we stated in Matsushita, ""predatory pricing schemes are rarely tried, and even more rarely successful."" 475 U.S., at 589.
             Moreover, the mechanism by which a firm engages in predatory pricing -- lowering prices -- is the same mechanism by which a
             firm stimulates competition; because ""cutting prices in order to increase business often is the very essence of competition . . . [;]
             mistaken inferences . . . are especially costly, because they chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect."" Id.,
             at 594. "
1599 ,1     ," Whether or not it so intends, the Court in practical effect concludes that a private party may not obtain injunctive relief against a
             horizontal merger unless the actual or probable conduct of the merged firms would establish a violation of the Sherman Act. The
             Court suggests that, to support a claim of predatory pricing, a competitor must demonstrate that the merged entity is ""able to
             absorb the market shares of its rivals once prices have been cut,"" either because it has a high market share or because it has
             ""sufficient excess capacity to enable it rapidly to expand its output and absorb the market shares of its rivals."" Ante, at 119-120,

             the courts to protect small businesses . . . only against the loss of profits from practices forbidden by the antitrust laws."" Ante, at
             116 (emphasis added).  By emphasizing postmerger conduct, the Court reduces to virtual irrelevance the related but distinct

             was still in its incipiency.  Congress saw the process of concentration in American business as a dynamic force; it sought to
             assure the Federal Trade Commission and the courts the power to brake this force at its outset and before it gathered
             momentum."" Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 317-318 (1962) (footnote omitted)."

             sections 13, 14, 18, and 19 of this title, when and under the same conditions and principles as injunctive relief against

             64 N. Y. 2d 504, 520, 479 N. E. 2d 779, 788 (1985). In Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574
             (1986), we recognized that predatory pricing schemes are ""rarely tried, and even more rarely successful."" Id., at 589. In this
             case, the possibility of success is practically nonexistent, because liquor retailers are limited to a single outlet.  ABC Law § 63.5
             (McKinney 1970).  In any event, § 101-bb forbids not only predatory pricing, but all price competition among retailers."
1613 ,6     ," A simple ""minimum markup"" statute requiring retailers to charge 112 percent of their actual wholesale cost may satisfy the
             ""active supervision"" requirement, and so be exempt from the antitrust laws under Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943). See
             Morgan v. Division of Liquor Control, Conn. Dept. of Business Regulation, 664 F.2d 353 (CA2 1981) (upholding a simple markup
             statute).  Section 101-bb, however, is not a simple minimum markup statute because it imposes a markup on the ""posted bottle
             price,"" a price that may greatly exceed what the retailer actually paid for the liquor. As we have explained, supra, at 339-340,
             Bulletin 471 permits wholesalers to reduce the case price -- the price actually paid by most retailers -- without reducing the bottle
             price.  The New York Court of Appeals expressly held that Bulletin 471 ""is consistent with Alcoholic Beverage Control Law §
             101-b(3) which does not mandate any price ratio between scheduled case and bottle prices."" J. A. J. Liquor Store, Inc. v. New
             York State Liquor Authority, supra, at 523, 479 N. E. 2d, at 790. We may not ""construe a state statute contrary to the
             construction given it by the highest court of a State."" O'Brien v. Skinner, 414 U.S. 524, 531 (1974). Appellees nevertheless argue
             that invalidation of Bulletin 471 does not require invalidation of § 101-bb.  Appellees contend that § 101-bb does not prevent the
             SLA from establishing a relationship between case price and bottle price; indeed, Rule 16.4(e) establishes such a relationship.
             Brief for Appellees 24-25, n. 37.  Invalidation of Bulletin 471 alone, however, would not prevent wholesalers from selling large
             quantities at low prices in one month, and then requiring retailers to charge abnormally high markups by raising bottle prices in
             subsequent months.  See supra, at 340.  We cannot accept appellees' suggestion that such unsupervised price fixing should be "
1614 ,      ," tolerated as a reasonable accounting method or as a hedge against inflation.  See App. to Juris. Statement 101A (advertising a
             guaranteed 31.3 percent markup on liquor purchased in August 1984 and sold in September 1984).  We thus have no occasion
             to consider whether a simple minimum markup statute would be entitled to antitrust immunity under Parker v. Brown. LEdHN[6B][
             ] [6B]Some States completely control the distribution of liquor within their boundaries.  E. g., Va. Code §§ 4-15,
             4-28 (1983).  Such comprehensive regulation is immune under Parker v. Brown because the State substitutes its own power for
             ""unfettered business freedom."" See New Motor Vehicle Bd. of Cal. v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 439 U.S. 96, 109 (1978)."
1614 ,7     ," In a concurring opinion, Judge Jasen argued that the State actively supervises the liquor-pricing system.  J. A. J. Liquor Store,
             Inc. v. New York State Liquor Authority, supra, at 526-529, 479 N. E. 2d, at 792-794. Judge Jasen noted that the SLA can
             respond to market conditions by permitting individual wholesalers to depart from their posted prices, ABC Law § 101-b(3)(b),
             and by permitting individual retailers to sell below the statutory definition of ""cost,"" § 101-bb(3), ""for good cause shown."" Bulletin
             471 itself was issued by the SLA in response to market conditions.  Moreover, the state legislature frequently considers
             proposals to alter the liquor-pricing system.  Neither the ""monitoring"" by the SLA, nor the periodic reexaminations by the state
             legislature, exerts any significant control over retail liquor prices or markups. Thus, the State's involvement does not satisfy the
             second requirement of Midcal."
1614 ,8     ," The same considerations lead us to reject appellees' contention that there is no ""contract, combination . . . , or conspiracy, in
             restraint of trade."" 15 U. S. C. § 1. HN10[
             ] Where ""private actors are . . . granted 'a degree of private regulatory power' . . . the regulatory scheme may be attacked under § 1"" as a ""hybrid"" restraint.  Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U.S. 260, 268 (1986) (quoting
             Rice v. Norman Williams Co., 458 U.S. 654, 666, n. 1 (1982) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment)).  See Schwegmann Bros.
             v. Calvert Distillers Corp., 341 U.S. 384 (1951). Our decisions reflect the principle that the federal antitrust laws pre-empt state
             laws authorizing or compelling private parties to engage in anticompetitive behavior.  See also Northern Securities Co. v. United
             States, 193 U.S. 197, 345-346 (1904) (plurality opinion); 1 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law para. 209, pp. 60-62 (1978).
             That principle squarely governs this case."
1614 ,9     ," Section 2 of the Twenty-first Amendment provides: HN12[
             ] ""The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or
             possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby
             prohibited."" "
1615 ,10    ," The dissenting opinion concedes that ""neither the House of Representatives nor the state ratifying conventions deliberated
             long on the powers conferred on the States by § 2."" Post, at 353.  It nevertheless maintains that the Senate debates ""clearly
             demonstrate an intent to confer on States complete and exclusive control over the commerce of liquor."" Post, at 354.  We find no
             such clear demonstration of congressional intent.  It is true that Senator Blaine, the Senate sponsor of the Amendment, at one
             point stated that the purpose of § 2 was ""to restore to the States . . . absolute control in effect over interstate commerce affecting
             intoxicating liquors. . . ."" 76 Cong. Rec. 4143 (1933).  At another point, however, Senator Blaine appeared to advance a
             narrower interpretation: ""So, to assure the so-called dry States against the importation of intoxicating liquor into those States, it is
             proposed to write permanently into the Constitution a prohibition along that line."" Id., at 4141. The dissent also maintains that the behavior of the States following ratification supports the view that States have power to enact
             laws governing the pricing of liquor free of the strictures of federal antitrust policy.  One commentator is quoted as saying that
             the States adopted ""'bold and drastic experiments'"" in price control. Post, at 357, quoting De Ganahl, Trade Practice and Price
             Control in the Alcoholic Beverage Industry, 7 Law & Contemp. Prob. 665, 680 (1940). In the next paragraph, however, this writer
             states that ""[because] the experiments came at a time when neither the fair-trade law nor the constitutional law on liquor was
             settled . . . there is uncertainty as to the validity of much of this legislation."" Ibid.  When the Twenty-first Amendment was
             adopted, it was far from clear that the federal commerce power extended to intrastate retail sales of liquor. See A. L. A.
             Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 542-548 (1935) (holding that the commerce power does not extend to
             intrastate sales of poultry, even when the poultry has been shipped across state lines).  The Miller-Tydings Fair Trade Act of
             1937, 50 Stat. 693, moreover, permitted States to authorize agreements prescribing prices for the resale of specified
             commodities, including liquor. Even after the passage of the Miller-Tydings Act, price control laws were not as universally
             popular as the dissent implies.  In 1940, for example, only 18 of the 45 ""wet"" States had price stabilization provisions written into
             their alcoholic beverage statutes, De Ganahl, supra, at 680, while in 17 States the State itself monopolized sales of liquor,
             Shipman, State Administrative Machinery for Liquor Control, 7 Law & Contemp. Prob. 600, 601, n. 5 (1940). "
1616 ,11    ," There is no indication that the purpose of Bulletin 471 is to protect small retailers. The Bulletin states that its purpose is to
             prevent ""a situation during post-off periods which resulted in what became known as a 'two bottle' price."" App. to Juris.
             Statement 71A.  Although there is no precise explanation of ""two bottle pricing"" in the record, the caption of Bulletin 471 is
             ""Unlawful Discrimination and Price Scheduling -- Bottle Price During Post-Down."" Ibid.  This suggests that the SLA was
             concerned with ensuring that wholesalers charge the same price to all retailers, and not with the relationship between the
             retailer's actual cost and the required markup. "
1617 ,12    ," We have no occasion in this case to consider whether the State's interest in protecting small retailers ever could prevail
             against the federal interest in enforcement of the antitrust laws."
1617 ,13    ," It is far from certain that the New York Legislature intended to promote temperance, or that the retail price maintenance
             system actually decreases consumption. Section 101-bb, like other sections of the ABC Law, recites that it is enacted ""for the
             purpose of fostering and promoting temperance."" ABC Law § 101-bb(1) (McKinney 1970).  This statement is not supported by
             specific findings, or by evidence in the record.  In Midcal, we accepted the California Supreme Court's rejection of a similar
             declaration of legislative purpose.  445 U.S., at 112-114 (discussing Rice v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd., 21 Cal. 3d
             431, 457-459, 579 P. 2d 476, 493-494 (1978)). The legislative Report accompanying § 101-bb does not suggest that the
             amendment was aimed at decreasing consumption. Rather, the Report focuses on the need to protect small retailers. New York
             State Legislature, Senate Excise Committee, Final Report 30, 37 (Mar. 1971).  The Report does express concern over the
             increase in liquor consumption during the years between 1964 and 1971.  Id., at 16.  But the Report recognizes the Moreland
             Commission's finding that higher prices do not reduce consumption, and states that ""because of the multiplicity of factors
             involved and lack of data on specifics, the Committee is unable to determine what portion of such increase is attributable to any
             particular factors."" Id., at 14. "

             fear does not possibly justify adopting a rule of per se illegality. Retail market power is rare, because of the usual presence of
             interbrand competition and other dealers, see Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36, 54 (1977), and it should
             therefore not be assumed but rather must be proved.  Cf. Baxter, The Viability of Vertical Restraints Doctrine, 75 Calif. L. Rev.

             unless it is designed to enforce a contractual obligation of one of the parties to the contract.  The dissent appears to accept this
             assumption.  See post, at 739-741, and n. 3, 744-746.  It is plainly wrong.  The classic ""ancillary"" restraint is an agreement by
             the seller of a business not to compete within the market.  See Mitchel v. Reynolds, 1 P. Wms. 181, 24 Eng. Rep. 347 (1711);
             Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 188(2)(a) (1981).  That is not ancillary to any other contractual obligation, but, like the
             restraint here, merely enhances the value of the contract, or permits the ""enjoyment of [its] fruits."" United States v. Addyston

             (hereinafter Bork) (vertical arrangements are ancillary to the ""transaction of supplying and purchasing""). More important than the erroneousness of the dissent's common-law analysis of ""naked"" and ""ancillary"" restraints are the
             perverse economic consequences of permitting nonprice vertical restraints to avoid per se invalidity only through attachment to
             an express contractual obligation.  Such an approach is contrary to the express views of the principal scholar on whom the
             dissent relies.  See 7 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law § 1457c, p. 170 (1986) (hereinafter Areeda) (legality of terminating price cutter
             should not depend upon formal adoption of service obligations that termination is assertedly designed to protect).  In the precise
             case of a vertical agreement to terminate other dealers, for example, there is no conceivable reason why the existence of an
             exclusivity commitment by the manufacturer to the one remaining dealer would render anticompetitive effects less likely, or the
             procompetitive effects on services more likely -- so that the dissent's line for per se illegality fails to meet the requirement of
             Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., supra, at 59, that it be based on ""demonstrable economic effect."" If anything, the
             economic effect of the dissent's approach is perverse, encouraging manufacturers to agree to otherwise inefficient contractual
             provisions for the sole purpose of attaching to them efficient nonprice vertical restraints which, only by reason of such
             attachment, can avoid per se invalidity as ""naked"" restraints.  The dissent's approach would therefore create precisely the kind of
             ""irrational dislocation in the market"" that legal rules in this area should be designed to avoid.  Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite

             horizontal, and not upon whether it is the product of a horizontal agreement.  Post, at 745-747, and n. 10.  That is of course a
             conceivable way of talking, but if it were the language of antitrust analysis there would be no such thing as an unlawful vertical
             restraint, since all anticompetitive effects are by definition horizontal effects.  The dissent quotes a statement of Professor
             Areeda as supposed adoption of its definition of horizontal restraint.  Post, at 745-746, n. 10, quoting Areeda § 1457d, p. 174.
             That statement seems to us to be, to the contrary, Professor Areeda's attempt to explain a peculiar usage of the term
             ""horizontal"" in Cernuto, Inc. v. United Cabinet Corp., 595 F.2d 164, 168 (CA3 1979), noting that (even though Cernuto did not
             involve a horizontal restraint) the use of the term ""horizontal"" was ""appropriate to capture the fact that dealer interests opposed
             to those of the manufacturer were being served."" Areeda § 1457d, p. 174.  The dissent also seeks to associate Judge Bork with
             its terminological confusion.  See post, at 746, n. 10, quoting Bork 288.  What the quoted passage says, however, is that a
             facially vertical restraint imposed by a manufacturer only because it has been coerced by a ""horizontal cartel"" agreement among
             his distributors is in reality a horizontal restraint.  That says precisely what we say: that a restraint is horizontal not because it
             has horizontal effects, but because it is the product of a horizontal agreement. "

             becomes primarily horizontal in nature in that one customer is seeking to suppress its competition by utilizing the power of a

             recalcitrant automobile dealers not to deal with discounters, the Supreme Court noted that in fact these restraints were induced
             by the dealers seeking to choke off aggressive competitors at their level, and found a per se violation, rejecting the suggestion
             that only unilateral restraints were at issue.  So here, if [the manufacturer and the sales representative acted at the
             nonterminated dealer's] direction, both the purpose and effect of the termination was to eliminate competition at the retail level,
             and not, as in GTE Sylvania, to promote competition at the manufacturer level.  Accordingly, the pro-competitive redeeming
             virtues so critical in GTE Sylvania may not be present here."" 595 F.2d, at 168 (footnote omitted). As we said in General Motors: ""The protection of price competition from conspiratorial restraint is an object of special solicitude under the antitrust laws.  We
             cannot respect that solicitude by closing our eyes to the effect upon price competition of the removal from the market, by

             distribution policy.  Thus, the court's implicit theory was that an agreement arose when the manufacturer bowed to the
             complainer's will.  In that situation, the 'horizontal' characterization is appropriate to capture the fact that dealer interests
             opposed to those of the manufacturer were being served."" Areeda, supra, at 174 (footnotes omitted). See also R. Bork, The Antitrust Paradox 288 (1978): ""A restraint -- whether on price, territory, or any other term -- is vertical, according to the usage employed here, when a firm
             operating at one level of an industry places restraints upon rivalry at another level for its own benefit.  (This definition excludes
             restraints, vertical in form only, that are actually imposed by horizontal cartels at any level of the industry, e. g., resale price
             maintenance that is compelled not by the manufacturer but by the pressure of organized retailers.)"""
1641 ,11    ," The two critical facts that had not yet been determined by a jury in the Cernuto case are perfectly plain in this case.  As
             Professor Areeda explained: ""The Cernuto case was decided on summary judgment which accepted the plaintiff's view of the facts.  But two facts critical for
             the court will often be obscure.  First, was it the manufacturer's purpose to eliminate price competition as such? Let us assume
             that termination was not based on such completely independent grounds as non-payment of bills.  Even so, the existence of an
             inevitable price effect does not establish a purpose to control prices in a forbidden way.  A purpose to facilitate point-of-sale
             services or to protect minimum economies of scale could induce a manufacturer to limit intrabrand competition.  Notwithstanding
             price effects, such limitations are lawful when reasonable and not subject to automatic condemnation.  Indeed, termination of
             one dealer in order to grant another exclusive distribution rights in an area is generally lawful.  Nevertheless, so long as the
             manufacturer is not implementing his own interest but that of the complainer, the vice of eliminating 'horizontal' competition with
             the complainer's rivals seems equally present when the complainer thereby succeeds in eliminating horizontal competition with
             respect to customers or territories. Second, was the manufacturer coerced or was he indulging his own preferences?  As we
             have seen, this question cannot be answered in the abstract.  The court correctly acknowledged that the manufacturer might
             also be implementing his own unilateral vision of optimal distribution without regard to the complainer's desires and held that no
             illegal agreement would arise if that were the case."" Areeda, supra, at 174-175 (footnotes omitted)."
1641 ,12    ," ""Let us defer for the moment problems of proof and assume that a manufacturer does not wish to terminate the plaintiff dealer
             but does so to placate the complaining dealer, who would otherwise cease handling the product.  This manufacturer would
             rather keep both dealers but, when forced to choose between them, concludes that terminating the plaintiff hurts him less
             (considering sales lost, transaction costs in finding and perhaps training a replacement, and any spillover effects upon his
             relations with other dealers) than losing the complainer's patronage. ""The present situation is Colgate in reverse.  In Colgate, it was the supplier who was controlling the dealer's behavior.  Here a
             dealer is conditioning his patronage in a way that controls the manufacturer's behavior.  The agreement concept seems parallel.
             But the economic effects can be very different.  From the policy viewpoint, it can matter greatly whether manufacturer or dealer
             interests are being served.  The former is more likely to seek efficient distribution, which stimulates interbrand competition; the
             latter is more likely to seek excess profits, which dampen interbrand competition.  Accordingly, antitrust policy can be more
             hospitable toward manufacturer efforts to control dealer prices, customers, or territories than toward the efforts of dealers to
             control their competitors through the manufacturer. ""Of course, manufacturer and dealer interests are not necessarily antagonistic.  Like the manufacturer, dealers might also
             believe that restricted distribution increases dealer services and sales and thus strengthens interbrand competition.  However,
             this objective seems unlikely when the manufacturer is forced to violate the distribution policy he thinks best.  Although he might
             be mistaken about what his optimal distribution policy ought to be, he should be presumed a better judge of that than coercing
             dealers who always desire excess profits unnecessary for efficient distribution."" Areeda, supra, at 167-168 (footnotes omitted). "

             justification for a per se rule against vertical price restraints, see ante, at 725-726, our opinion in Sylvania was quite different.  As
             we stated then: ""The market impact of vertical restrictions is complex because of their potential for a simultaneous reduction of intrabrand
             competition and stimulation of interbrand competition.  Significantly, the Court in Schwinn did not distinguish among the
             challenged restrictions on the basis of their individual potential for intrabrand harm or interbrand benefit.  Restrictions that
             completely eliminated intrabrand competition among Schwinn distributors were analyzed no differently from those that merely
             moderated intrabrand competition among retailers."" 433 U.S., at 51-52 (footnotes omitted). In the following pages, we pointed out that because vertical nonprice restrictions imposed by manufacturers may serve to
             advance interbrand competition, the restriction on intrabrand competition should be subject only to a rule of reason analysis.
             Along these same lines, we explained that ""economists also have argued that manufacturers have an economic interest in
             maintaining as much intrabrand competition as is consistent with the efficient distribution of their products."" Id., at 56. Thus,
             although the majority neglects to mention it, fostering intrabrand competition has been recognized as an important goal of "
1643 ,      ," antitrust law, and although a manufacturer's efficiency-enhancing vertical nonprice restraints may subject a reduction of

             manufacturer-imposed vertical nonprice restraints, id., at 54, causes nothing but economic harm.  As one commentator has
             recently stated: ""Intrabrand competition can benefit the consumer, and it is therefore important to insure that a manufacturer's motive for a
             vertical restriction is not simply to acquiesce in his distributors' desires to limit competition among themselves.  The Supreme

             there is no indication that the assignment was a mask for resale price maintenance.  Since Feldman had the exclusive right to
             sell Murray Biscuit's products to the Certified account, Morrison had no business selling to Certified at any price."" Id., at 1439
             (emphasis added). Judge Posner thus made it clear that although Morrison had been terminated pursuant to a valid vertical nonprice restraint, a
             terminated dealer might prevail if it could prove that the nonprice agreement was ""a mask behind which the illegal price fixing
             continued."" Ibid."

             advanced by the defendant are legitimate, or are mere pretext to disguise a per se illegal agreement with the nonterminated
             dealer to maintain resale prices.  It is the Court's duty under Monsanto to decide whether sufficient evidence was presented for a
             jury to make that determination."" McCabe's Furniture, Inc. v. La-Z-Boy Chair Co., 798 F.2d 323, 329 (CA8 1986), cited ante, at

1644 ,18    ," Although at trial respondent had asked the jury to find that it had acted independently, see n. 15, supra, and accompanying
             text, respondent has not disputed, either in the Court of Appeals or here, the jury's finding of an agreement.  (Respondent has,
             of course, contended that no agreement was reached requiring some level of resale price maintenance.  As I have argued,
             though, such an agreement is not needed to invoke the per se rule in a case such as this.) Respondent did argue before the
             District Court for an instruction explaining that ""it must be shown that the manufacturer agreed with the complaining dealer to
             terminate the existing dealer and that, in so agreeing, the manufacturer shared with the complaining dealer the same desire of
             eliminating price competition for the complaining dealer."" 1 Record 151. Respondent later objected to the court's decision not to
             give this instruction, 1 Record 54, 22 Record 1599, but the court in fact had quite carefully explained to the jury that ""what a
             preponderance . . . of the evidence in the case must show in order to establish the existence of the required combination,
             agreement, or understanding is that Sharp and Hartwell knowingly came to a common and mutual understanding to accomplish
             or to attempt to accomplish an unlawful purpose."" Id., at 1584-1585. "
1645 ,19    ," The Court instructed the jury: ""The Sherman Act is violated when a seller enters into an agreement or understanding with one of its dealers to terminate
             another dealer because of the other dealer's price cutting. Plaintiff contends that Sharp terminated Business Electronics in
             furtherance of Hartwell's desire to eliminate Business Electronics as a price-cutting rival. ""If you find that there was an agreement between Sharp and Hartwell to terminate Business Electronics because of Business
             Electronics' price cutting, you should answer 'yes' to question number 1. ""Sharp, on the other hand, contends that it terminated Business Electronics unilaterally, not as a result of any agreement or
             understanding with Hartwell, but because of Business Electronics' sales performance.  If you find that Sharp did not terminate
             Business Electronics pursuant to an agreement or understanding with Hartwell to eliminate price cutting by Business Electronics,
             then you should answer 'no' to question number 1."" 22 Record 1587. Respondent had asked for an instruction requiring the jury to consider circumstantial evidence as proof of a motivation to
             eliminate price competition only if such evidence could not ""equally be interpreted to show that Sharp terminated Business
             Electronics Corporation for other business reasons and not pursuant to any agreement with Mr. Hartwell to fix resale prices of
             calculators."" 1 Record 148. Respondent objected to the failure to give this instruction, id., at 54, and also objected, more
             specifically, to the instruction that was given on the ground that ""it allows the jury to find against the defendant even if they do not
             believe that Sharp cared about [Business Electronics'] price cutting or if they believe that Sharp had a dual motive in making the
             termination."" 22 Record 1599. The instruction quoted above, though, makes it highly unlikely that the jury would have found for
             petitioner although finding respondent's motives to be mixed ones. "
1646 ,20    ," Thus, the Courts of Appeals decisions cited by the majority as supporting its view, see ante, at 720, n. 1, are, in fact,
             consistent with the rule that a naked intent to eliminate price competition is per se invalid.  Each of the opinions contains a
             discussion that distinguishes between, on the one hand, an agreement between manufacturer and dealer to eliminate a price-
             cutting competitor based solely on an intent to eliminate price competition, and, on the other hand, an agreement between
             manufacturer and dealer to eliminate a price-cutting competitor that is grounded not only in an antipathy to price competition, but
             also in a purpose to implement a procompetitive system of vertical nonprice restraints.  See McCabe's Furniture, Inc. v. La-Z-
             Boy Chair Co., 798 F.2d, at 329-330; Morrison v. Murray Biscuit Co., 797 F.2d, at 1439-1440; Westman Commission Co. v.
             Hobart Int'l, Inc., 796 F.2d 1216, 1223 (CA10 1986). Moreover, none of these opinions proposes the rule that the majority
             sanctions today: that an agreement as to some level of resale price maintenance is necessary for invocation of the per se rule in
             these situations. "

1714 ,3     ," Ingraham, like most of our Eighth Amendment cases, involved the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, and it therefore is
             not directly controlling in this Excessive Fines Clause case. The insights into the meaning of the Eighth Amendment reached in
             Ingraham and similar cases, however, are highly instructive. We left open in Ingraham the possibility that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause might find application in some civil
             cases. See 430 U.S., at 669, n. 37. The examples we cited as possibilities -- persons confined in mental or juvenile institutions --
             do not provide much support for petitioners' argument that the Excessive Fines Clause is applicable to a civil award of punitive
             damages. In any event, petitioners have not made any argument specifically based on the Cruel and Unusual Punishments
             Clause. LEdHN[3B][
             ] [3B]There is language in Carlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524, 546 (1952), suggesting that the Bail Clause may be implicated in civil deportation proceedings. The Court there held that ""the Eighth Amendment does not require that bail be
             allowed"" in such cases, but the opinion in that case never addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment applied in civil
             cases: the Court held that the Bail Clause does not require Congress to provide for bail in any case, but prohibits only the
             imposition of excessive bail. Carlson provides petitioners with little support for another reason as well. Bail, by its very nature, is
             implicated only when there is a direct government restraint on personal liberty, be it in a criminal case or in a civil deportation
             proceeding. The potential for governmental abuse which the Bail Clause guards against is present in both instances, in a way
             that the abuses against which the Excessive Fines Clause protects are not present when a jury assesses punitive damages."
1714 ,4     ," The same basic mode of inquiry should be applied in considering the scope of the Excessive Fines Clause as is proper in other
             Eighth Amendment contexts. We look to the origins of the Clause and the purposes which directed its Framers. ""The applicability
             of the Eighth Amendment always has turned on its original meaning, as demonstrated by its historical derivation."" Ingraham, 430
             U.S., at 670-671, n. 39. We emphasize, however, that this historical emphasis concerns the question of when the Eighth
             Amendment is to be applied; as the Court's jurisprudence under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause indicates, its
             approach has not relied on history to the same extent when considering the scope of the Amendment. See Trop v. Dulles, 356
             U.S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion) (""The Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that

1715 ,7     ," Petitioners have come forward with no evidence, or argument, which convinces us that the word ""fine,"" as used in the late 18th
             century, would have encompassed private civil damages of any kind. Indeed, the term ""damages"" was also in use at the time the
             Eighth Amendment was drafted and ratified, and had a precise meaning limited to the civil context. Cunningham defined
             damages as follows: ""in the Common law it is a part of what the jurors are to inquire of, and bring in, when an action passeth for
             the plaintiff: . . . [Damages] comprehend a recompence for what the plaintiff or demandant hath suffered, by means of the wrong
             done to him by the defendant or tenant."" 1 Cunningham, supra; see also 1 Tomlins, at 498 (same); 1 Bouvier, at 360 (same).
             The dichotomy between fines and damages was clear. There have been cases which have used the word ""fine"" to refer to civil damages assessed by statute. As the partial dissent
             notes, two cases decided 70 years after the Excessive Fines Clause was adopted considered the term ""fines"" to include money,
             recovered in a civil suit, which was paid to government. See Hanscomb v. Russell, 77 Mass. 373, 375 (1858); Gosselink v.
             Campbell, 4 Iowa 296 (1856). These cases, however, provide no support for petitioners' argument that the Eighth Amendment is
             applicable in cases between private parties. As to the partial dissent's reliance on the Bard, post, at 290, we can only observe: Though Shakespeare, of course, Knew the Law of his time, He was foremost a poet, In search of a rhyme. "

             They were payable to [the private litigant]."" 62 Selden Society, at 463. The only overlap between the two might occur in the Assize of Novel Disseisin, in which the court could grant the recovery of
             land and chattels, and might amerce the defendant as well. Id., at 156; see generally 2 Pollock & Maitland 44-56, 523-524. But
             even in this action, the amerciable offense is one to the Crown, for every disseisin was a breach of the peace, as well as an
             improper possession of another's property. Id., at 44. Along these lines, see 62 Selden Society, at 478-479 (""In comparison with

             amercements were not large, see McKechnie 287; 2 Pollock & Maitland 513, being placed in the King's mercy meant, at least
             theoretically, that a man's estate was in the King's hands, and it was within the King's power to require its forfeit. See 62 Selden
             Society, at 463; McKechnie 71-72 (one called to the King's service who did not go was in mercy, and his estate was subject to "
1718 ,      ," forfeiture). Amercements also resembled a form of taxation, particularly when used against entire townships. See Pleas for
             Gloucester xxxiv."
1718 ,16    ," According to Pollock and Maitland, after the court found a person to be in the King's mercy, and that person obtained a pledge
             for the payment of whatever sum was to be amerced, the court would go on to other cases. At this point the person had not yet
             been amerced. ""At the end of the session some good and lawful men, the peers of the offender (two seem to be enough) were
             sworn to 'affeer' the amercements. They set upon each offender some fixed sum of money that he was to pay; this sum is his
             amercement."" 2 Pollock & Maitland 513; see also Pleas for Gloucester xxxiv. This procedure indicates that amercements were
             assessed by a ""jury"" different from that which considered the case."

1718 ,18    ," So, for example, when the House of Lords placed certain limits on the types of cases in which exemplary damages could be
             awarded, Lord Devlin's extensive discussion mentioned neither Magna Carta or the Excessive Fines Clause of the 1689 Bill of
             Rights, nor did it suggest that English constitutional or common law placed any restrictions on the award of exemplary damages
             other than those discussed above. Rookes v. Barnard, [1964] A. C. 1129, 1221-1231. In fact, Lord Devlin recognized that his
             suggested alterations were a departure from the traditional common-law view. Id., at 1226. We find it significant that other
             countries that share an English common-law heritage have not followed the decision in Rookes, and continue to allow punitive or
             exemplary damages to be awarded without substantial interference. See, e. g., Uren v. John Fairfax & Sons, [1967] A. L. R. 25, "

1719 ,19    ," In Weems, Justice McKenna continued his writing for the Court: ""[Constitutions] are not ephemeral enactments, designed to
             meet passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, 'designed to approach immortality as nearly as
             human institutions can approach it.' The future is their care and provision for events of good and bad tendencies of which no
             prophecy can be made. In the application of a constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of
             what may be. Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and
             power. Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas. Rights
             declared in words might be lost in reality."" 217 U.S., at 373."
1719 ,20    ," Among the first cases to make explicit reference to exemplary damages was Huckle v. Money, 2 Wils. 205, 95 Eng. Rep. 768
             (K. B. 1763), where the court refused to set aside a jury award of # 300 where the plaintiff's injury would have been
             compensated by # 20. Upholding what it referred to as an award of ""exemplary damages,"" the court noted that ""the law has not
             laid down what shall be the measure of damages in actions of tort; the measure is vague and uncertain, depending on a vast
             variety of causes, facts, and circumstances,"" and declined to ""intermeddle"" in the damages determination. ""[I]t must be a glaring
             case indeed of outrageous damages in a tort, and which all mankind at first blush must think so, to induce a Court to grant a new
             trial for excessive damages."" Id., at 206-207, 95 Eng. Rep., at 768-769. Another case decided that year stated the applicable
             principle with particular clarity: ""Damages are designed not only as a satisfaction to the injured person, but likewise as
             punishment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future and as a proof of the detestation of the jury to the
             action itself."" Wilkes v. Wood, Lofft 1, 18-19, 98 Eng. Rep. 489, 498-499 (K. B.). Other English cases followed a similar
             approach. See, e. g., Roe v. Hawkes, 1 Lev. 97, 83 Eng. Rep. 316 (K. B. 1663); Grey v. Grant, 2 Wils. 252, 253, 95 Eng. Rep.

1720 ,21    ," In United States v. Halper, 490 U.S. 435 (1989), we held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment places
             limits on the amounts the Federal Government may recover in a civil action, after the defendant already has been punished
             through the criminal process. While our opinion in Halper implies that punitive damages awarded to the Government in a civil
             action may raise Eighth Amendment concerns, that case is materially different from this one, because there the Government
             was exacting punishment in a civil action, whereas here the damages were awarded to a private party. We noted in Halper that
             nothing in our opinion ""precludes a private party from filing a civil suit seeking damages for conduct that previously was the
             subject of criminal prosecution and punishment. The protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are not triggered by litigation
             between private parties."" Id., at 451 (emphasis added). We left open the question whether a qui tam action, in which a private
             party brings suit in the name of the United States and shares in any award of damages, would implicate the Double Jeopardy
             Clause.  Id., at 451, n. 11. We leave the same question open for purposes of the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause."
1720 ,22    ," Because of the result we reach today, we need not answer several questions that otherwise might be necessarily antecedent
             to finding the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause applicable to an award of punitive damages, and that have not been
             briefed by the parties. We shall not decide whether the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines applies to the several
             States through the Fourteenth Amendment, nor shall we decide whether the Eighth Amendment protects corporations as well as
             individuals."
1720 ,23    ," Petitioners claim that the due process question is within the ""clear intendment"" of the objection it has made throughout these
             proceedings. Our review of the proceedings in the District Court and the Court of Appeals shows that petitioners' primary claim in
             both of those courts was that the punitive damages award violated Vermont state law. Petitioners also argued that the award
             violated the Eighth Amendment. We fail to see how the claim that the award violates due process is necessarily a part of these
             arguments. HN8[
             ] We shall not assume that a nonconstitutional argument also includes a constitutional one, and shall not stretch the specific claims made under the Eighth Amendment to cover those that might arise under the Due Process Clause as
             well. Although in particular cases we have applied the doctrine petitioners advance, see Braniff Airways, Inc. v. Nebraska Bd. of
             Equalization and Assessment, 347 U.S. 590, 598-599 (1954), this is not a case where a respondent is making arguments in
             support of a judgment. See Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital, 463 U.S. 239, 244, n. 6 (1983); Dandridge v. Williams,
             397 U.S. 471, 475-476, n. 6 (1970). In the absence of a developed record on the issues relevant to this due process inquiry, we
             shall not stretch the ""clear intendment"" doctrine to include this case, as we do not think that the due process question is ""only an
             enlargement"" of the Eighth Amendment inquiry. Although the due process analysis of an award of punitive damages may track "
1721 ,      ," closely the Eighth Amendment analysis suggested by petitioners, we shall not assume that to be the case and shall not attempt
             to decide the question in the absence of a record on the due process point developed in the District Court and the Court of
             Appeals."
1721 ,24    ," The law of punitive damages in Vermont is typical of the law in most American jurisdictions. The doctrine has long standing.
             As far back as 1862, the Supreme Court of Vermont noted that the law on exemplary damages was ""long settled in this state.""
             Nye v. Merriam, 35 Vt. 438, 446. A Vermont jury may award punitive damages only if the evidence supports a finding that the
             defendant acted with malice, see, e. g., Appropriate Technology Corp. v. Palma, 146 Vt. 643, 647, 508 A. 2d 724, 726 (1986), or
             ""malice or wantonness shown by the act,"" Rogers v. Bigelow, 90 Vt. 41, 49, 96 A. 417, 420 (1916). Punitive damages awards
             may be set aside if grossly and manifestly excessive. See Glidden v. Skinner, 142 Vt. 644, 648, 458 A. 2d 1142, 1145 (1983).
             The Vermont Supreme Court has declined to adopt a rule of proportionality between compensatory and punitive damages,
             Pezzano v. Bonneau, 133 Vt. 88, 92, 329 A. 2d 659, 661 (1974), but does not allow punitive damages to stand when an award
             of compensatory damages has been vacated, Allard v. Ford Motor Credit Co., 139 Vt. 162, 164, 422 A. 2d 940, 942 (1980).
             Once a plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence of malice, evidence of ""'the defendant's pecuniary ability may be considered in
             order to determine what would be a just punishment for him.'"" Lent v. Huntoon, 143 Vt. 539, 550, 470 A. 2d 1162, 1170 (1983),
             quoting Kidder v. Bacon, 74 Vt. 263, 274, 52 A. 322, 324 (1902). The $ 6 million in punitive damages in this case apparently is the largest such judgment in the history of Vermont; there have
             been other substantial jury awards, however, in the State. See, e. g., Coty v. Ramsey Associates, Inc., 149 Vt. 451, 546 A. 2d
             196 ($ 380,000 in punitive damages), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1236 (1988). "
1722 ,25    ," We have never held expressly that the Seventh Amendment allows appellate review of a district court's denial of a motion to
             set aside an award as excessive. Although we granted certiorari in two cases in order to consider the issue, in both instances we
             found it unnecessary to reach the question when we decided the case. See Neese v. Southern R. Co., 350 U.S. 77 (1955) (even
             assuming appellate review power under the Seventh Amendment, Court of Appeals was not justified in reversing denial of new
             trial on the particular facts of the case); Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co., 393 U.S. 156, 158 (1968) (same). In light of the result
             we reach today, we follow the same course here."
1722 ,26    ," This is particularly true because the federal courts operate under the strictures of the Seventh Amendment. As a result, we are
             reluctant to stray too far from traditional common-law standards, or to take steps which ultimately might interfere with the proper
             role of the jury. "

             certain demands, including divestiture of certain supermarkets in northern California and an agreement to ""hold separate"" the
             two firms until American Stores satisfied all of the consent order's conditions. American Stores agreed to the consent order, and

1753 ,9     ," The FTC found: ""'The city's purchase of CJA legal services for indigents is based on competition.  The price offered by the city is based on
             competition, because the city must attract a sufficient number of individual lawyers to meet its needs at that price.  The city
             competes with other purchasers of legal services to obtain an adequate supply of lawyers, and the city's offering price is an
             element of that competition.  Indeed, an acknowledgement of this element of competition is implicit in the respondents' argument
             that an increase in the CJA fee was 'necessary to attract, and retain, competent lawyers.' If the offering price had not attracted a
             sufficient supply of qualified lawyers willing to accept CJA assignments for the city to fulfill its constitutional obligation, then
             presumably the city would have increased its offering price or otherwise sought to make its offer more attractive.  In fact,
             however, the city's offering price before the boycott apparently was sufficient to obtain the amount and quality of legal services
             that it needed.'"" 272 U.S. App. D. C., at 278, 856 F.2d, at 232. The Court of Appeals agreed with this analysis: ""The Commission correctly determined that the CJA regulars act as 'competitors' in the only sense that matters for antitrust
             analysis: They are individual business people supplying the same service to a customer, and as such may be capable, through a
             concerted restriction on output, of forcing that customer to pay a higher price for their service.  That the D. C. government, like
             the buyers of many other services and commodities, prefers to offer a uniform price to all potential suppliers does not alter in any
             way the anti-competitive potential of the petitioners' boycott. The antitrust laws do not protect only purchasers who negotiate
             each transaction individually, instead of posting a price at which they will trade with all who come forward.  Nor should any
             significance be assigned to the origin of the demand for CJA services; here the District may be compelled by the Sixth
             Amendment to purchase legal services, there it may be compelled by the voters to purchase street paving services.  The reason
             for the government's demand for a service is simply irrelevant to the issue of whether the suppliers of it have restrained trade by
             collectively refusing to satisfy it except upon their own terms.  We therefore conclude, as did the Commission, that the petitioners
             engaged in a 'restraint of trade' within the meaning of Section 1."" Id., at 281, 856 F.2d, at 235 (footnote omitted). "

             conduct.  See, e.g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society, 457 U.S. 332, 350-351 (1982)."" Id., at 15-16, n. 25.  The Court
             of Appeals overlooked the words ""in part"" in that footnote, and also overlooked the statement in text that ""there must be a
             substantial potential for impact on competition in order to justify per se condemnation."" Id., at 16.  As the following paragraph
             from its opinion demonstrates, the Court of Appeals incorrectly assumed that the per se rule against price fixing is ""only"" a rule of
             administrative convenience: ""The antitrust laws permit, but do not require, the condemnation of price fixing without proof of market power; even the per se
             rule, as the Commission acknowledges in its brief, is only a rule of 'administrative convenience and efficiency,' not a statutory
             command.  FTC Brief at 39; see Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 15 n. 25 (1984). While the rule may
             occasionally be overinclusive, condemning the ineffectual with the harmful, there is no known danger that socially beneficial
             arrangements will be prohibited, for price-fixing agreements rarely, if ever, have redeeming virtues.  As for the hapless but
             harmless, as Professor Areeda has noted, defendants charged with conspiring to fix prices 'have little moral standing to demand
             proof of power or effect when the most they can say for themselves is that they tried to harm the public but were mistaken in
             their ability to do so.' VII P. Areeda, Antitrust Law para. 1509 at 411 (1986)."" 272 U.S. App. D. C., at 295, 856 F.2d, at 249. "

             always premised on the existence of price-fixing power which is likely to be exercised adversely to the public.  Moreover,
             toleration implies a burden of continuous supervision for which the courts consider themselves ill-suited.  And even if power is
             usually established while any defenses are not, litigation will be complicated, condemnation delayed, would be price-fixers
             encouraged to hope for escape, and criminal punishment less justified.  Deterrence of a generally pernicious practice would be

             of the pre-boycott rates of compensation and the fact that the Trial Lawyers enjoyed no other effective means of making
             themselves heard are irrelevant to the proper analysis.  Compare ante, at 421-422. "
1761 ,2     ," I disagree with the Court that the government's interest in employing the per se rule here is a substantial one.  The per se rule's
             conceded service of the goals of administrative efficiency and judicial economy cannot justify its application to activity protected
             by the First Amendment. ""The First Amendment does not permit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency."" Riley v. National
             Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 795 (1988). See also Schneider v. State, 308 U.S. 147, 161, 164 (1939). Insofar
             as the per se rule is thought warranted by a speculation that even relatively small boycotts or those without market power might
             nonetheless inflict some measure of economic harm, see ante, at 434-436, the rule can be applied in ordinary antitrust cases
             where First Amendment freedoms are not implicated.  In such cases, ""'the conceivable social benefits [of the conduct under
             scrutiny] are few in principle, small in magnitude, [and] speculative in occurrence.'"" Ante, at 434, n. 16 (quoting 7 P. Areeda,
             Antitrust Law para. 1509, pp. 412-413 (1986)).  But where an expressive boycott is at issue, the same cannot be said; the First
             Amendment establishes that the social benefits involved are not ""small in magnitude"" or ""speculative in occurrence."" Hence,
             even if it were possible that a boycott without market power might cause anticompetitive effects -- a dubious proposition, since "
1762 ,      ," by definition market power is the ability to alter prices -- the government still should be required to proceed under the rule of

             communicate with the government, it still would be subject to the per se rule. The instant case is different: there is a genuine
             question whether the SCTLA boycott involved any economic coercion at all.  That is why a showing of market power is
             necessary before the boycott can be condemned as an unfair method of competition. "

             Commission's duty was to prevent the continuance of this unlawful action by an order directing that it cease and desist therefrom
             and divest itself of what it had no right to hold.  Further violations of the Act through continued ownership could be effectively
             prevented only by requiring the owner wholly to divest itself of the stock and thus render possible once more free play of the
             competition which had been wrongfully suppressed."" FTC v. Western Meat Co., 272 U.S. 554, 559 (1926) (McReynolds, J.). The suggestion that continuing ownership of stock unlawfully acquired might constitute a ""further violatio[n] of the Act"" would
             cast some doubt upon the utility of American's distinction between mandatory and prohibitory injunctions even were we inclined

             dissolution of the company for its participation in the sugar trust, relying upon two theories: that dissolution was appropriate
             because the company had violated the terms of its charter by entering the trust, and that dissolution was appropriate under the
             state antitrust laws. The Court of Appeals agreed that dissolution was appropriate on the first ground, and so declined to reach
             the second.  Id., at 626, 24 N.E., at 841. Judge Finch, writing for a unanimous court, began the opinion by announcing, ""The judgment sought against the defendant is
             one of corporate death."" Id., at 608, 24 N.E., at 834. He then said that although the ""life of a corporation is indeed less than that

             ensuing opinion bristles with the rhetoric of moral condemnation; when characterizing the corporation's defense, for example,

1802 ,16    ," There is a common core to present-day and early 20th-century understandings of the distinction between dissolution and
             divestiture: ""As applied in both early and more recent antitrust cases, 'dissolution' refers to an antitrust judgment which dissolves or
             terminates an illegal combination or association -- putting it out of business, so to speak.  'Divestiture' is used to refer to
             situations where the defendants are required to divest or dispossess themselves of specified property in physical facilities,
             securities, or other assets."" Oppenheim, Divestiture as a Remedy Under the Federal Antitrust Laws, 19 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 119,
             120 (1950). Nevertheless, for at least the past four decades dissolution and divestiture have been treated as interchangeable terms in
             antitrust law.  See United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 366 U.S. 316, 330, n. 11 (1961) (terms are to a ""large
             degree interchangeable""); see also Oppenheim, 19 Geo. Wash. L. Rev., at 121 (recognizing technical distinction between terms,
             but treating them as interchangeable nonetheless). During the first decades of this century, however, ""dissolution"" was the favored term for a remedy that put an end to an unlawful
             combination and ""divestiture"" was rarely mentioned in the antitrust context.  The early 20th-century treatise writers seem to have
             spoken exclusively in terms of dissolution. See, e.g., W. Thornton, A Treatise on the Sherman Anti-Trust Act § 372 (1913).  Not
             surprisingly, all of the legislative history cited by the parties to this case refers to dissolution, not to divestiture. Yet even without using the term ""divestiture,"" Congress could and did recognize the appropriateness of a divestiture remedy in
             merger cases: § 11 of the Clayton Act expressly authorizes the FTC to order a defendant corporation to ""divest itself of the stock
             held . . . contrary to the provisions of sectio[n] seven . . . of this Act."" 38 Stat. 735.  Indeed, the term ""divestiture"" appears to have
             entered the antitrust vocabulary as a consequence of FTC proceedings against alleged violators of § 7 of the Act.  See, e.g.,
             Arrow-Hart & Hegeman Electric Co. v. FTC, 291 U.S. 587 (1934); FTC v. Western Meat Co., 272 U.S. 554 (1926). Use of the
             term in those cases is unsurprising, for the text of the Act suggested that ""divestiture,"" rather than ""dissolution,"" was the remedy
             being sought. By 1944, Justice Douglas was using the two terms in close proximity, see United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U.S.
             173, 188-189 (1944) (Sherman Act case), although it is at least arguable that his usage preserved the technical distinction that
             was to be generally elided less than a decade later.  Cf.  Swift & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 311, 319 (1928) (referring to
             ""divestiture of the instrumentalities"" in a case raising both Sherman Act and Clayton Act claims).  It would appear that, as the
             moral conception of dissolution lost favor and divestiture decrees became paradigmatic of dissolution remedies, the two
             concepts were collapsed into one another."

             to itemize the various remedies which might be available in a § 16 suit.  Moreover, while divestiture might be the appropriate
             remedy in every § 7 case prosecuted by the FTC, there is no reason to believe that the same would be true in private § 7 cases.

             a maximum resale price may actually protect consumers against exploitation by the dealer acting as a local monopolist.  The
             manufacturer acts not out of altruism, of course, but out of a desire to increase its own sales -- whereas the dealer's incentive,
             like that of any monopolist, is to reduce output and increase price.  If an exclusive dealership is the most efficient means of
             distribution, the public is not served by forcing the manufacturer to abandon this method and resort to self-distribution or
             competing distributors. Vertical, maximum price fixing thus may have procompetitive interbrand effects even if it is per se illegal
             because of its potential effects on dealers and consumers. See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 159 (1968) (Harlan, J.,

             production and exclusive distributorship stages.  This approach is incorrect.  For example, in Albrecht itself the Court identified

             Court's use of those terms -- what is critical is that he had standing to bring a § 1 action as the victim of a vertical conspiracy to
             underprice his sales.  Finally, the Court contradicts its own contrived model when it admits that vertical maximum-price-fixing

             activity inherently is fraught with anticompetitive risk.  It deprives the marketplace of the independent centers of decisionmaking
             that competition assumes and demands.  In any conspiracy, two or more entities that previously pursued their own interests
             separately are combining to act as one for their common benefit.  This not only reduces the diverse directions in which economic
             power is aimed but suddenly increases the economic power moving in one particular direction.  Of course, such mergings of
             resources may well lead to efficiencies that benefit consumers, but their anticompetitive potential is sufficient to warrant scrutiny

             the case against them: a legitimate functional discount will not cause any substantial lessening of competition. The concept of "

             implications of wholesaler discounts must follow the logic of the Standard Oil complaint, and likewise assumes that this logic
             exposes to liability any seller who fails to monitor the resale prices of its wholesaler. Id., at 204. Indeed, Rowe's own discussion
             suggests one defect in his argument: legitimate wholesaler discounts will usually be insulated from liability by an absence of
             evidence on the causation issue. Id., at 203-204. In any event, nothing in our opinion today endorses a theory of liability under

             Commission held, however, that § 11341(a) authorized it to foreclose resort to RLA remedies for modification and enforcement

             The petition raises three issues: (1) whether § 11341(a) authorizes the ICC to foreclose employee resort to the RLA; (2) whether

             argued that in light of the alternative ground for decision offered by the ICC on remand from the Court of Appeals, see n. 2,
             supra, the meaning and scope of § 11341(a) was no longer material to the dispute.  The union respondents reassert their
             mootness argument in their brief on the merits.  Brief for Respondent Unions 18. We disagree.  The Commission predicated the analysis in its remand order on the correctness of the Court of Appeals'
             interpretation of § 11341(a).  Thus, our definitive interpretation of § 11341(a) may affect the Commission's remand order.
             Agency compliance with the Court of Appeals' mandate does not moot the issue of the correctness of the court's decision.  See,

             Commission on remand does not end the controversy between the parties.  The parties retain an interest in the validity of the "

             that the exemption relieving airlines from the operation of the antitrust laws when certain transactions were approved by the Civil

             authorize the municipality to engage (1) in specifically ""economic regulation,"" post, at 388, (2) of a specific industry, post, at 391.
             These dual specificities are without support in our precedents, for the good reason that they defy rational implementation. "
1922 ,      ," If, by authority to engage in specifically ""economic"" regulation, the dissent means authority specifically to regulate competition,
             we squarely rejected that in Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34 (1985), as discussed in text.  Seemingly, however, the dissent
             means only that the State authorization must specify that sort of regulation whereunder ""decisions about prices and output are
             made not by individual firms, but rather by a public body."" Post, at 387.  But why is not the restriction of billboards in a city a
             restriction on the ""output"" of the local billboard industry?  It assuredly is -- and that is indeed the very gravamen of Omni's
             complaint.  It seems to us that the dissent's concession that ""it is often difficult to differentiate economic regulation from
             municipal regulation of health, safety, and welfare,"" post, at 393, is a gross understatement.  Loose talk about a ""regulated
             industry"" may suffice for what the dissent calls ""antitrust parlance,"" post, at 387, but it is not a definition upon which the criminal
             liability of public officials ought to depend. LEdHN[6B][
             ] [6B] Under the dissent's second requirement for a valid delegation of Parker immunity -- that the authorization to regulate pertain to a
             specific industry -- the problem with the South Carolina statute is that it used the generic term ""structures,"" instead of conferring
             its regulatory authority industry-by-industry (presumably ""billboards,"" ""movie houses,"" ""mobile homes,"" ""TV antennas,"" and every
             other conceivable object of zoning regulation that can be the subject of a relevant ""market"" for purposes of antitrust analysis).
             To describe this is to refute it.  Our precedents not only fail to suggest, but positively reject, such an approach.  ""The municipality
             need not 'be able to point to a specific, detailed legislative authorization' in order to assert a successful Parker defense to an
             antitrust suit."" Hallie, 471 U.S., at 39 (quoting Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389, 415 (1978))."
1922 ,5     ," The dissent is confident that a jury composed of citizens of the vicinage will be able to tell the difference between ""independent
             municipal action and action taken for the sole purpose of carrying out an anticompetitive agreement for the private party."" Post,

1923 ,      ," the vicinage.  Ordinarily the allegation will merely be (and the dissent says this is enough) that the municipal action was not
             prompted ""exclusively by a concern for the general public interest,"" post, at 387 (emphasis added).  Thus, the real question is
             whether a jury can tell the difference -- whether Solomon can tell the difference -- between municipal-action-not-entirely-
             independent-because-based-partly-on-agreement-with-private-parties
             that
             is

             municipal-action-not-entirely-
             independent-because-based-partly-on-agreement-with-private-parties that is unlawful.  The dissent does not tell us how to put
             this question coherently, much less how to answer it intelligently.  ""Independent municipal action"" is unobjectionable, ""action
             taken for the sole purpose of carrying out an anticompetitive agreement for the private party"" is unlawful, and everything else
             (that is, the known world between the two poles) is un-addressed. The dissent contends, moreover, that ""the instructions in this case, fairly read, told the jury that the plaintiff should not prevail
             unless the ordinance was enacted for the sole purpose of interfering with access to the market."" Post, at 396, n. 9 (emphasis
             added).  That is not so.  The sum and substance of the jury's instructions here was that anticompetitive municipal action is not
             lawful when taken as part of a conspiracy, and that a conspiracy is ""an agreement between two or more persons to violate the
             law, or to accomplish an otherwise lawful result in an unlawful manner."" App. 79.  Although the District Court explained that ""it is
             perfectly lawful for any and all persons to petition their government,"" the court immediately added, ""but they may not do so as a
             part or as the object of a conspiracy."" Ibid. These instructions, then, are entirely circular: An anticompetitive agreement becomes
             unlawful if it is part of a conspiracy, and a conspiracy is an agreement to do something unlawful.  The District Court's
             observation, upon which the dissent places so much weight, that ""if by the evidence you find that [COA] procured and brought
             about the passage of ordinances solely for the purpose of hindering, delaying or otherwise interfering with the access of [Omni]
             to the marketing area involved in this case . . . and thereby conspired, then, of course, their conduct would not be excused under
             the antitrust laws,"" id., at 81, see post, at 387, n. 2, is in no way tantamount to an instruction that this was the only theory upon

1927 ,1     ," Construing the statute in the light of the common law concerning contracts in restraint of trade, we have concluded that only
             unreasonable restraints are prohibited. ""One problem presented by the language of § 1 of the Sherman Act is that it cannot mean what it says.  The statute says that
             'every' contract that restrains trade is unlawful.  But, as Mr. Justice Brandeis perceptively noted, restraint is the very essence of
             every contract; read literally, § 1 would outlaw the entire body of private contract law.  Yet it is that body of law that establishes
             the enforceability of commercial agreements and enables competitive markets -- indeed, a competitive economy -- to function
             effectively. ""Congress, however, did not intend the text of the Sherman Act to delineate the full meaning of the statute or its application in
             concrete situations.  The legislative history makes it perfectly clear that it expected the courts to give shape to the statute's broad
             mandate by drawing on common-law tradition.  The Rule of Reason, with its origins in common-law precedents long antedating
             the Sherman Act, has served that purpose. . . .  [The Rule of Reason] focuses directly on the challenged restraint's impact on
             competitive conditions."" National Society of Professional Engineers v. United States, 435 U.S. 679, 687-688 (1978) (footnotes
             omitted). We have also confined the Sherman Act's mandate by holding that the independent actions of the sovereign States and their
             officials are not covered by the language of the Act.  Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341 (1943). "

             recognizes that all elements of a bargain -- quality, service, safety, and durability -- and not just the immediate cost, are
             favorably affected by the free opportunity to select among alternative offers.  Even assuming occasional exceptions to the
             presumed consequences of competition, the statutory policy precludes inquiry into the question whether competition is good or

             expansive language and the absence of any express incorporation of common-law immunities, we have, on several occasions,
             found that a tradition of immunity was so firmly rooted in the common law and was supported by such strong policy reasons that
             'Congress would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish the doctrine.' Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 555 (1967).""
             Id., at 637. Nevertheless, the Court refused to find a firmly established immunity enjoyed by municipal corporations at common
             law for the torts of their agents.  ""Where the immunity claimed by the defendant was well established at common law at the time
             [42 U. S. C.] § 1983 was enacted, and where its rationale was compatible with the purposes of the Civil Rights Act, we have
             construed the statute to incorporate that immunity. But there is no tradition of immunity for municipal corporations, and neither
             history nor policy supports a construction of § 1983 that would justify"" according them such immunity. Id., at 638. See also Will v.

             are not . . .""). "
1930 ,5     ," Contrary to the Court's reading of Hallie, our opinion in that case emphasized the industry-specific character of the Wisconsin
             legislation in explaining why the delegation satisfied the 'clear articulation' requirement.  At issue in Hallie was the town's
             independent decision to refuse to provide sewage treatment services to nearby towns -- a decision that had been expressly
             authorized by the Wisconsin legislation.  471 U.S., at 41. We wrote: ""Applying the analysis of Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389 (1978), it is sufficient that the statutes
             authorized the City to provide sewage services and also to determine the areas to be served."" Id., at 42. ""Nor do we agree with the Towns' contention that the statutes at issue here are neutral on state policy. The Towns attempt to
             liken the Wisconsin statutes to the Home Rule Amendment involved in Boulder, arguing that the Wisconsin statutes are neutral
             because they leave the City free to pursue either anticompetitive conduct or free-market competition in the field of sewage
             services.  The analogy to the Home Rule Amendment involved in Boulder is inapposite.  That Amendment to the Colorado
             Constitution allocated only the most general authority to municipalities to govern local affairs.  We held that it was neutral and did
             not satisfy the 'clear articulation' component of the state action test.  The Amendment simply did not address the regulation of
             cable television.  Under home rule the municipality was to be free to decide every aspect of policy relating to cable television, as
             well as policy relating to any other field of regulation of local concern.  Here, in contrast, the State has specifically authorized
             Wisconsin cities to provide sewage services and has delegated to the cities the express authority to take action that foreseeably
             will result in anticompetitive effects.  No reasonable argument can be made that these statutes are neutral in the same way that
             Colorado's Home Rule Amendment was."" Id., at 43. We rejected the argument that the delegation was insufficient because it did not expressly mention the foreseeable
             anticompetitive consequences of the city of Eau Claire's conduct, but we surely did not hold that the mere fact that incidental
             anticompetitive consequences are foreseeable is sufficient to immunize otherwise unauthorized restrictive agreements between
             cities and private parties."
1930 ,6     ," The authority to regulate the ""'location, height, bulk, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures,'"" see ante, at
             371, n. 3 (citation omitted), may of course have an indirect effect on the total output in the billboard industry, see ante, at 373-
             374, n. 4, as well as on a number of other industries, but the Court surely misreads our cases when it implies that a general
             grant of zoning power represents a clearly articulated decision to authorize municipalities to enter into agreements to displace
             competition in every industry that is affected by zoning regulation. "
1931 ,7     ," A number of Courts of Appeals have held that a municipality which exercises its zoning power to further a private agreement to
             restrain trade is not entitled to state-action immunity. See, e. g., Westborough Mall, Inc. v. Cape Girardeau, 693 F. 2d 733, 746
             (CA8 1982) (""Even if zoning in general can be characterized as 'state action,' . . . a conspiracy to thwart normal zoning
             procedures and to directly injure the plaintiffs by illegally depriving them of their property is not in furtherance of any clearly
             articulated state policy""); Whitworth v. Perkins, 559 F. 2d 378, 379 (CA5 1977) (""The mere presence of the zoning ordinance
             does not necessarily insulate the defendants from antitrust liability where, as here, the plaintiff asserts that the enactment of the
             ordinance was itself a part of the alleged conspiracy to restrain trade"")."
1931 ,8     ," No such agreement was involved in Hallie v. Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34 (1985). In that case the plaintiffs challenged independent
             action -- the determination of the service area of the city's sewage system -- that had been expressly authorized by Wisconsin
             legislation.  The absence of any such agreement provided the basis for our decision in Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U.S. 260, 266-
             267 (1986) (""The distinction between unilateral and concerted action is critical here. . . .  Thus, if the Berkeley Ordinance
             stabilizes rents without this element of concerted action, the program it establishes cannot run afoul of § 1""). "
1932 ,9     ," The instructions in this case, fairly read, told the jury that the plaintiff should not prevail unless the ordinance was enacted for
             the sole purpose of interfering with access to the market.  See n. 2, supra.  Thus, this case is an example of one of the ""polar
             extremes,"" see ante, at 375, n. 5, that juries -- as well as Solomon -- can readily identify.  The mixed motive cases that concern
             the Court should present no problem if juries are given instructions comparable to those given below.  When the Court describes
             my position as assuming that municipal action that was not prompted ""exclusively by a concern for the general public interest"" is
             enough to create antitrust liability, ibid., it simply ignores the requirement that the plaintiff must prove that the municipal action is
             the product of an anticompetitive agreement with private parties. Contrary to our square holding in Fisher v. Berkeley, 475 U.S.
             260 (1986), today the Court seems to assume that municipal action which is not entirely immune from antitrust scrutiny will
             automatically violate the antitrust laws."
1932 ,10    ," ""There are many obstacles to discovering conspiracies, but the most frequent difficulties are three.  First, price-fixers and
             similar miscreants seldom admit their conspiracy or agree in the open.  Often, we can infer the agreement only from their
             behavior.  Second, behavior can sometimes be coordinated without any communication or other observable and reprehensible
             behavior.  Third, the causal connection between an observable, controllable act -- such as a solicitation or meeting -- and
             subsequent parallel action may be obscure."" 6 P. Areeda, Antitrust Law P 1400, at 3-4 (1986). See also Turner, The Definition of Agreement under the Sherman Act: Conscious Parallelism and Refusals to Deal, 75 Harv. L.

1932 ,11    ,As the Court previously has noted:
1933 ,      ," ""In 1972, there were 62,437 different units of local government in this country.  Of this number 23,885 were special districts

             number of counties, municipalities, and townships, most of which have broad authority for general governance subject to
             limitations in one way or another imposed by the State.  These units may, and do, participate in and affect the economic life of
             this Nation in a great number and variety of ways.  When these bodies act as owners and providers of services, they are fully
             capable of aggrandizing other economic units with which they interrelate, with the potential of serious distortion of the rational
             and efficient allocation of resources, and the efficiency of free markets which the regime of competition embodied in the antitrust

             ] [15B]Courts usually have considered the relationship between price in one market and demand in another in
             defining the relevant market. Because market power is often inferred from market share, market definition generally determines
             the result of the case. Pitofsky, New Definitions of Relevant Market and the Assault on Antitrust, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1805, 1806-
             1813 (1990). Kodak chose to focus on market power directly rather than arguing that the relationship between equipment and
             service and parts is such that the three should be included in the same market definition. Whether considered in the conceptual
             category of ""market definition"" or ""market power,"" the ultimate inquiry is the same -- whether competition in the equipment
             market will significantly restrain power in the service and parts markets."
1971 ,16    ," The United States as amicus curiae in support of Kodak echoes this argument: ""The ISOs' claims are implausible because
             Kodak lacks market power in the markets for its copier and micrographic equipment. Buyers of such equipment regard an "
1972 ,      ," increase in the price of parts or service as an increase in the price of the equipment, and sellers recognize that the revenues
             from sales of parts and service are attributable to sales of the equipment. In such circumstances, it is not apparent how an
             equipment manufacturer such as Kodak could exercise power in the aftermarkets for parts and service."" Brief for United States

1972 ,17    ," It is clearly true, as the United States claims, that Kodak ""cannot set service or parts prices without regard to the impact on the
             market for equipment."" Id., at 20. The fact that the cross-elasticity of demand is not zero proves nothing; the disputed issue is
             how much of an impact an increase in parts and service prices has on equipment sales and on Kodak's profits."
1972 ,18    ," Although Kodak repeatedly relies on Continental T. V. as support for its factual assertion that the equipment market will
             prevent exploitation of the service and parts markets, the case is inapposite. In Continental T. V., the Court found that a
             manufacturer's policy restricting the number of retailers that were permitted to sell its product could have a procompetitive effect.
             See 433 U.S. at 55. The Court also noted that any negative effect of exploitation of the intrabrand market (the competition
             between retailers of the same product) would be checked by competition in the interbrand market (competition over the same
             generic product) because consumers would substitute a different brand of the same product. Unlike Continental T. V., this case
             does not concern vertical relationships between parties on different levels of the same distribution chain. In the relevant market,
             service, Kodak and the ISO's are direct competitors; their relationship is horizontal. The interbrand competition at issue here is
             competition over the provision of service. Despite petitioner's best effort, repeating the mantra ""interbrand competition"" does not
             transform this case into one over an agreement the manufacturer has with its dealers that would fall under the rubric of
             Continental T. V. "

             information such as the longevity of product use and its potential resale or trade-in value."
1973 ,21    ," To inform consumers about Kodak, the competitor must be willing to forgo the opportunity to reap supracompetitive prices in
             its own service and parts markets. The competitor may anticipate that charging lower service and parts prices and informing
             consumers about Kodak in the hopes of gaining future equipment sales will cause Kodak to lower the price on its service and
             parts, canceling any gains in equipment sales to the competitor and leaving both worse off. Thus, in an equipment market with
             relatively few sellers, competitors may find it more profitable to adopt Kodak's service and parts policy than to inform the
             consumers. See 2 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law P404b1; App. 177 (Kodak, Xerox, and IBM together have nearly 100% of

             ] [21B] The dissent urges a radical departure in this Court's antitrust law. It argues that because Kodak has only an ""inherent""
             monopoly in parts for its equipment, post, at 489-490, the antitrust laws do not apply to its efforts to expand that power into other
             markets. The dissent's proposal to grant per se immunity to manufacturers competing in the service market would exempt a vast
             and growing sector of the economy from antitrust laws. Leaving aside the question whether the Court has the authority to make
             such a policy decision, there is no support for it in our jurisprudence or the evidence in this case. Even assuming, despite the absence of any proof from the dissent, that all manufacturers possess some inherent market power
             in the parts market, it is not clear why that should immunize them from the antitrust laws in another market. The Court has held
             many times that HN6[

             acumen can give rise to liability if ""a seller exploits his dominant position in one market to expand his empire into the next.""

             (1938). Moreover, on the occasions when the Court has considered tying in derivative aftermarkets by manufacturers, it has not
             adopted any exception to the usual antitrust analysis, treating derivative aftermarkets as it has every other separate market. See
             International Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U.S. 392, 92 L. Ed. 20, 68 S. Ct. 12 (1947); International Business Machines Corp. v.

             because the tie here ""does not permit the manufacturer to project power over a class of consumers distinct from that which it is
             already able to exploit (and fully) without the inconvenience of the tie."" Post, at 498. Beyond the dissent's obvious difficulty in
             explaining why Kodak would adopt this expensive tying policy if it could achieve the same profits more conveniently through
             some other means, respondents offer an alternative theory, supported by the record, that suggests Kodak is able to exploit some
             customers who in the absence of the tie would be protected from increases in parts prices by knowledgeable customers. See
             supra, at 475-476. "

             have provided any evidence refuting respondents' theory of forced unwanted purchases at higher prices and price
             discrimination. While it may be, as the dissent predicts, that the equipment market will prevent any harms to consumers in the
             aftermarkets, the dissent never makes plain why the Court should accept that theory on faith rather than requiring the usual
             evidence needed to win a summary judgment motion."

1979 ,33    ," Kodak claims that both Continental T. V. and Monsanto support its free-rider argument. Neither is applicable. In both
             Continental T. V., 433 U.S. at 55, and Monsanto, 465 U.S. at 762-763, the Court accepted free-riding as a justification because
             without restrictions a manufacturer would not be able to induce competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of
             investment of capital and labor necessary to distribute the product. In Continental T. V. the relevant market level was retail sale
             of televisions and in Monsanto retail sales of herbicides. Some retailers were investing in those markets; others were not,
             relying, instead, on the investment of the other retailers. To be applicable to this case, the ISO's would have to be relying on
             Kodak's investment in the service market; that, however, is not Kodak's argument. "
1982 ,1     ," That there exist innumerable parts and service firms in such industries as the automobile industry, see Brief for Automotive
             Warehouse Distributors Association et al. as Amici Curiae 2-3, does not detract from this point. The question whether power to
             control an aftermarket exists is quite distinct from the question whether the power has been exercised. Manufacturers in some "
1983 ,      ," markets have no doubt determined that exclusionary intrabrand conduct works to their disadvantage at the competitive
             interbrand level, but this in no way refutes the self-evident reality that control over unique replacement parts for single-branded
             goods is ordinarily available to such manufacturers for the taking. It confounds sound analysis to suggest, as respondents do,
             see Brief for Respondents 5, 37, that the asserted fact that Kodak manufactures only 10% of its replacement parts, and
             purchases the rest from original equipment manufacturers, casts doubt on Kodak's possession of an inherent advantage in the
             aftermarkets. It does no such thing, any more than Kodak's contracting with others for the manufacture of all constituent parts
             included in its original equipment would alone suggest that Kodak lacks power in the interbrand micrographic and photocopying
             equipment markets. The suggestion implicit in respondents' analysis -- that if a seller chooses to contract for the manufacture of
             its branded merchandise, it must permit the contractors to compete in the sale of that merchandise -- is plainly unprecedented."
1983 ,2     ," Even with interbrand power, I may observe, it is unlikely that Kodak could have incrementally exploited its position through the
             tie of parts to service alleged here. Most of the ""service"" at issue is inherently associated with the parts, i. e., that service
             involved in incorporating the parts into Kodak equipment, and the two items tend to be demanded by customers in fixed
             proportions (one part with one unit of service necessary to install the part). When that situation obtains, ""'no revenue can be
             derived from setting a higher price for the tied product which could not have been made by setting the optimum price for the
             tying product.'"" P. Areeda & L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis P426(a), p. 706 (4th ed. 1988) (quoting Bowman, Tying Arrangements
             and the Leverage Problem, 67 Yale L. J. 19 (1957)). These observations strongly suggest that Kodak parts and the service
             involved in installing them should not be treated as distinct products for antitrust tying purposes. See Jefferson Parish Hospital
             Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2, 39, 80 L. Ed. 2d 2, 104 S. Ct. 1551 (1984) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in judgment) (""For
             products to be treated as distinct, the tied product must, at a minimum, be one that some consumers might wish to purchase
             separately without also purchasing the tying product"") (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted); Ross, The Single Product Issue

1985 ,3     ," The Court insists that the record in this case suggests otherwise, i. e., that a tie between parts and service somehow does
             enable Kodak to increase overall monopoly profits. See ante, at 479-481, n. 29. Although the Court does not identify the record
             evidence on which it relies, the suggestion, apparently, is that such a tie facilitates price discrimination between sophisticated,
             ""high-volume"" users of Kodak equipment and their unsophisticated counterparts. The sophisticated users (who, the Court
             presumes, invariably self-service their equipment) are permitted to buy Kodak parts without also purchasing supracompetitively
             priced Kodak service, while the unsophisticated are -- through the imposition of the tie -- compelled to buy both. See ante, at
             475-476. While superficially appealing, at bottom this explanation lacks coherence. Whether they self-service their equipment or not,
             rational foremarket consumers (those consumers who are not yet ""locked in"" to Kodak hardware) will be driven to Kodak's
             competitors if the price of Kodak equipment, together with the expected cost of aftermarket support, exceeds competitive levels.
             This will be true no matter how Kodak distributes the total system price among equipment, parts, and service. See supra, at 495.
             Thus, as to these consumers, Kodak's lack of interbrand power wholly prevents it from employing a tie between parts and
             service as a vehicle for price discrimination. Nor does a tie between parts and service offer Kodak incremental exploitative power
             over those consumers -- sophisticated or not -- who have the supposed misfortune of being ""locked in"" to Kodak equipment. If
             Kodak desired to exploit its circumstantial power over this wretched class by pressing them up to the point where the cost to
             each consumer of switching equipment brands barely exceeded the cost of retaining Kodak equipment and remaining subject to
             Kodak's abusive practices, it could plainly do so without the inconvenience of a tie, through supracompetitive parts pricing alone.
             Since the locked-in sophisticated parts purchaser is as helpless as the locked-in unsophisticated one, I see nothing to be gained
             by price discrimination in favor of the former. If such price discrimination were desired, however, it would not have to be
             accomplished indirectly, through a tie of parts to service. Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 13(a), would
             prevent giving lower parts prices to the sophisticated customers only ""where the effect of such discrimination may be
             substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce, or to injure, destroy, or prevent
             competition with any person who either grants or knowingly receives the benefit of such discrimination, or with customers of
             either of them . . . ."" Ibid.; see, e. g., Falls City Industries, Inc. v. Vanco Beverage, Inc., 460 U.S. 428, 434-435, 75 L. Ed. 2d 174,
             103 S. Ct. 1282 (1983). That prohibited effect often occurs when price-discriminated goods are sold for resale (i. e., to
             purchasers who are necessarily in competition with one another).  E. g., FTC v. Morton Salt Co., 334 U.S. 37, 47, 92 L. Ed.
             1196, 68 S. Ct. 822 (1948); see P. Areeda & L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis P600, p. 923 (1988) (""Secondary-line injury arises

             Although the Sixth Circuit did hold that the genuine substance of an anticompetitive lawsuit creates a rebuttable presumption of
             objective reasonableness, given the facts of that case -- in which the antitrust plaintiff had presented strong evidence that the
             defendants' lawsuit, which followed a long and unsuccessful lobbying effort, had been motivated solely for the anticompetitive
             harm the judicial process would inflict on it -- that modest reservation was probably wise. Evidence of anticompetitive animus in
             Westmac was in fact so great that Chief Judge Merritt thought that the plaintiff had successfully rebutted the presumptive
             reasonableness of defendants' lawsuit. The delay from the defendants' combined lobbying and litigation attack had allegedly
             sent the plaintiff into bankruptcy, and memos from one defendant to its attorney had stated, ""'If this [lobbying activity] doesn't
             succeed, start a lawsuit -- bonds won't sell,'"" 797 F.2d at 318, and (in a statement repeated to a codefendant), ""'if nothing else, "

             order to injure competition in the cigarette market as a whole, Brown & Williamson must be able to create a real possibility of

             $ 2.91/M in 1972 to $ 8.78/M in 1981, an increase of over 200%. In 1982, the industry became much more aggressive on the

2071 ,14    ," One of the purposes of broadening the Clayton Act's competitive injury language in the Robinson-Patman Act was to provide
             more effective protection against predatory price cutting. As the Attorney General's National Committee to Study the Antitrust
             Laws explained in its 1955 report: ""In some circumstances, to be sure, injury to even a single competitor should bring the Act into play. Predatory price cutting
             designed to eliminate a smaller business rival, for example, is a practice which inevitably frustrates competition by excluding
             competitors from the market or deliberately impairing their competitive strength. The invalidation of such deliberate price slashes
             for the purpose of destroying even a single competitor, moreover, accords distinct recognition to the narrower tests of 'injury'
             added to the price discrimination provisions of the Clayton Act through the 1936 Robinson-Patman amendments. The
             discrimination provisions in the original Clayton Act were feared by the legislators as inadequate to check the victimization of
             individual businessmen by predatory price cuts that nevertheless created no general impairment of competitive conditions in a
             wider market. To reach such destructive price cuts endangering the survival of smaller rivals of a powerful seller was an express
             objective of the liberalizing amendments in the 'injury' clause of the Robinson-Patman Act."" Report of the Attorney General's
             National Committee to Study the Antitrust Laws 165-166 (1955) (footnotes omitted). "
2073 ,15    ," In finding an absence of actual supracompetitive pricing, the Court also relies on the testimony of Liggett executives, who
             stated that industry prices were fair. Illustrative is the following exchange: ""Q I want to know -- yes or no -- sir, whether or not you say that the price you charged for branded cigarettes, which is the same
             price you say everybody else charged, was a fair and equitable price for that product to the American consumer. ""A It's what the industry set, and based on that it's a fair price."" App. 396. The problem with this testimony, and testimony like it, is that it relates to the period before the price war, as well as after, see id.,
             at 392, when there is no real dispute but that prices were supracompetitive. (""The profits in the cigarette industry are the best of
             any industry I've been associated with, very much so."" Ibid.) Some of the testimony cited by the Court, for instance, is that of an
             outside director who served only from 1977 or 1978 until 1980, see 64 Tr. 51-56, cited ante, at 237; his belief in the
             competitiveness of his industry must be viewed against the ""substantial evidence suggesting that in recent decades, the industry
             reaped the benefits of prices above a competitive level"" to which the majority itself refers, ante, at 213. The jury was, of course, entitled to discount the probative force of testimony from executives to the effect that there was no
             collusion among tobacco manufacturers, App. 397-398, and that they had appeared before a congressional committee to vouch
             for the competitive nature of their industry, id., at 623-631. The jury was also free to give greater weight to the documentary
             evidence presented, the inferences to be drawn there-from, and the testimony of experts who agreed with the textbook
