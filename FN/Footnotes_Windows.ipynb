JUSTICE MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of this  petition.   Dissent by:  WARREN  Dissent MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, dissenting. This is no ordinary case.  It is of utmost importance to millions of investors, and concerns practices which have an  impact on the entire economy of the Nation.  It presents for consideration basic principles of  antitrust law  not  previously decided by this Court, and, consequently, is not controlled by precedent.  It comes here without  representation of the public interest by an agency charged with enforcement of the antitrust laws. This case draws into question the legality under the Sherman Act of the practice of the New York Stock Exchange  in adopting rules fixing minimum rates for the commissions charged by Exchange members for the purchase and  sale of securities on the Exchange.  Petitioners brought this action pursuant  [****2]   to § 4 of the Clayton Act, 38  Stat.  731,  15 U. S. C. § 15 , derivatively on behalf of five mutual fund investment companies of which they are  shareholders and representatively on behalf of other shareholders against the New York Stock Exchange and five  of its member firms.  Their complaint charges that the practice of the Exchange in fixing minimum commission rates  for transactions in securities listed on the Exchange constitutes a price-fixing conspiracy under  § 1  of the Sherman  Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended,  15 U. S. C. § 1 . They sought treble damages, a declaratory judgment, and an  injunction, the effect of which would be to restrain the Exchange from interfering with the rights of individual  Exchange members to set their   [*955]   own competitive rates of commission.  The District Court granted summary  judgment for the Exchange and member firms.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\n",

JUSTICE DOUGLAS on July 12,  1974, granted. MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion.   Dissent by:  DOUGLAS  Dissent MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting. Cargill, desirous of acquiring control of petitioner, made a cash offer for all of petitioner's common stock. Petitioner  thereupon filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to enjoin that tender  offer, alleging that acquisition of control of petitioner would violate § 7 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended,  15 U. S. C. § 18 . That court issued the injunction stating in a detailed opinion its view that the acquisition of stock  control by Cargill raises serious antitrust issues. The sole question here is whether Cargill's attempts to take over Missouri Portland will be enjoined, pending the  outcome of a trial on the merits of Missouri Portland's claim that a merger of these two companies would violate the  antitrust laws. The District Court granted such an injunction,  375 F.Supp. 249 , but the Court of Appeals  [****2]    reversed.   498 F.2d 851 . Missouri Portland sought and received a stay of the Court of Appeals' mandate, thus  reinstituting the injunction issued by the District Court.  Today the Court vacates that stay. The Court treats the case as if we were in the sensitive  First Amendment  field where relatively minor restraints may  have a \"chilling\" effect on an important constitutional   [*920]   right. But as I read the Constitution and  Bill of Rights ,  a corporation has no constitutional right to merge, consolidate, or acquire the assets of another company.  The old  Court in the days of \"substantive due process\" built an expansive corporate  Bill of Rights  by reading \"liberty\" in the  Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment  as including the \"liberty\" to exploit people, our resources, and our\n",

Dissent by:  REHNQUIST  Dissent  [**256]   JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting. This case presents the question whether a victim of alleged discrimination may have his right to sue totally  extinguished by a prior suit to which he was not a party and in which a consent decree was entered before his  cause of action even accrued.  Because I think the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit erred in holding that a  district court cannot entertain a suit challenging practices allegedly mandated or permitted by a prior consent  decree, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. In March 1974, consent decrees were entered in two suits alleging race discrimination in the city of Jackson's hiring  and promoting practices in its Police Department.   United States  v.  City of Jackson , Civil Action No. J-74-66(N) (SD  Miss.);  Corley  v.  Jackson Police Dept ., Civil Action No. 73J-4(C) (SD Miss.).
